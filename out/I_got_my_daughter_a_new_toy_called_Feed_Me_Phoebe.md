Single mother here, with a daughter that just turned 4 last week. During mornings, she likes to watch TV before I leave work and the babysitter comes over. She sits there, gobbling down cereal and occasionally babbling nonsense. It’s adorable, really. 
To say we’re tight on money right now is an understatement. I can barely afford to keep the lights on, but every time I grimace at a new bill in the mail — there she is to pull me out of my storm. Smiling, laughing. 
My little ball of sunshine.

She doesn’t have many toys. Not new ones, atleast. I typically end up buying her used toys from a messy aisle at Goodwill. But a couple days ago, a commercial popped up on TV. I was in the kitchen cooking breakfast when I heard her yelling for me to come to the living room.
I ran out, initially thinking something was wrong — before I saw her pointing at the TV excitedly — spoon forgotten on the floor.
“Mommy! Look!”
The commercial showed several children talking to a doll, feeding it fake food — dressing it up. I watched for about 20 seconds before it ended, and a choir of children sang ‘We love Feed Me Phoebe!’
“I want that toy— I want that toy! Mommy, please?” she begged, standing up and practically bouncing on her heels.
The toy was slightly high technology given its AI/voice recognition feature, making it around 25 dollars. I really didn’t have much money to spend but.. god, those eyes of hers. And I was getting paid that day..

I knelt down, pulling her close, the scent of maple syrup and her hair filling my nose. “Phoebe, huh?” I murmured, tucking a stray curl behind her ear. Her eyes, wide and hopeful, stared back at me. They were the same deep brown as mine, but held a sparkle I sometimes felt I’d lost somewhere along the way.

“Yes! She talks, Mommy! And I can feed her! Please, please, please?”

My heart ached. Twenty-five dollars might as well have been twenty-five hundred right now. But then I remembered once again: today was payday. It wouldn’t be much after bills, but maybe… just maybe.

“Hmm,” I hummed, trying to sound thoughtful rather than terrified of my bank balance. “She looks like a very special doll, sweetpea. Mommy has to go to work now, but… I’ll think about it, okay? It’s a big decision for a talking doll.” I gave her a squeeze, hoping the hesitation in my voice wasn't too obvious. I saw the slight flicker of disappointment, but then her face brightened.

“You’ll think about it? Really?”

“Really really,” I confirmed, kissing the top of her head. “Now, let’s get you finished with breakfast before Miss Carol gets here, alright?”

She nodded, a determined little bounce in her step as she went back to her bowl, though I noticed her eyes kept drifting back to the now-empty screen where Phoebe had been just moments before. I watched her for a moment, a fierce love swelling in my chest. If I could give her the moon, I would. For now, I’d settle for seeing if I could swing a talking doll.

The morning rush was a blur after that. A quick hug for my daughter, a rushed handover with Miss Carol, and then I was out the door, the chill morning air doing little to cool the financial anxieties swirling in my mind. The image of those hopeful brown eyes, though, stayed with me, a tiny, persistent tug on my conscience.

It was just past noon when my phone buzzed in my pocket. I pulled it out, expecting another goddamn work email, but it was a text from Miss Carol:

“Hey! Quick update – your little one is adorable as ever, but she’s been going on and on about ‘Feed Me Phoebe’ since you left. I think you might have a new mission on your hands! 😉”

I smiled, a genuine, tired smile. Mission accepted, Miss Carol. Mission accepted.

The rest of the workday crawled by, each minute ticking slower than the last. My mind kept replaying the commercial, my daughter’s beaming face, and Miss Carol’s text. When my shift finally ended, I practically flew out the door, making a beeline for the nearest Walmart.

The toy aisle was a chaotic symphony of primary colors and plastic. I found the ‘Feed Me Phoebe’ display, a towering wall of identical dolls, each packaged in a bright pink box. My heart did a little flutter-kick of anxiety as I picked one up, the price tag staring back at me. Twenty-five dollars. It was a significant chunk of what was left after rent and groceries. But then I imagined those wide, hopeful brown eyes, and, well..

The doll was in my cart before I could second-guess myself.

The drive home felt endless. I clutched the steering wheel, the pink box rattling softly in the passenger seat, a strange mix of dread and anticipation churning in my stomach. When I finally pulled into our driveway, my daughter was already peeking through the living room window, her face lighting up the moment she saw my car.

“Mommy’s home!” she shrieked, Miss Carol’s gentle laughter following her as she burst out the front door.

I met her halfway, kneeling down and pulling the box from behind my back. Her eyes went wide, then impossibly wider. A gasp escaped her lips, and she threw her arms around my neck, squeezing so tight I almost lost my breath.

“Oh my gosh! Phoebe! You got her! You really got her!”

Her joy was infectious, washing away the last vestiges of my financial worry. We spent the next hour on the living room floor. She ripped open the box with an enthusiasm that belied her small size, carefully pulling out the doll. Phoebe had big, blue eyes, rosy cheeks, and a perpetually cheerful smile. She came with a tiny plastic bottle and a spoon.

“Say something, Phoebe!” my daughter commanded, holding the doll up.

Phoebe blinked her big eyes. “Hello! I’m Phoebe! What’s your name?” her sweet, synthesized voice chirped.

My daughter giggled, a sound that was pure music to my ears. “I’m Fiona! But Mommy calls me Fifi!”

I leaned in, ruffling her hair. “That’s right, sweetpea. You know, ‘Phoebe’ kinda sounds like ‘Fifi,’ doesn’t it?” I winked.

She considered this, then nodded eagerly. “It does!”

The rest of the evening was a blur of feeding Pheobe imaginary food, dressing her in her tiny outfit, and listening to her repeat programmed phrases. My daughter was utterly enchanted. It was worth every penny, I decided, watching her pure, unadulterated happiness.

Bedtime came, and my daughter, exhausted but still buzzing with excitement, insisted Pheobe sleep right next to her. I tucked them both in, kissing her forehead. “Sleep tight, my little Fifi. And you too, Phoebe.”

“Goodnight, Mommy!” she mumbled, already drifting off.

I closed her door almost all the way, leaving a sliver open for the nightlight to peek through. I went to the kitchen, tidying up, the quiet hum of the refrigerator the only sound. I was just about to head to my own room when a faint.. metallic whisper, drifted from my daughter’s room.

I paused, listening. It was Phoebe’s voice, but it sounded… different. Not the cheerful, programmed tone from earlier. It was lower, slower, almost.. conspiratorial?

“Fifi,” the doll whispered, “Do you ever get scared when Mommy leaves?”

I cocked an eyebrow. That was a.. weird question. I crept closer to the door, pressing my ear against the wood.

Silence for a moment, then my daughter’s sleepy, muffled voice. “Sometimes.”

“And what do you do then, Fifi?” Phoebe’s voice was unnervingly soft.

Another pause. “I… I wait for her to come back.”

“But what if she doesn’t come back?” the doll asked, the words dripping with an unsettling sweetness. “What if she goes away forever?”

My breath hitched in my throat. 
It.. It’s gotta be the program glitching or something. It’s AI, after all. Maybe it’s.. maybe it’s just veering off track. Many modern AIs do that.

I walked in slowly, giving a nervous smile to my daughter, who looked a bit scared from the doll’s question. “I’m gonna turn Phoebe off until the morning so you can get some sleep, okay darling?” I said softly. She nodded, too tired to protest. I flipped the off switch and tucked her in, giving her a tired kiss on the forehead before walking slowly out of the room — shutting the door with a soft click.

I walked slowly to my own room, the soft click of Fiona’s door echoing unnervingly in the quiet house. My mind was a whirlwind. What was that? I replayed Phoebe’s chilling whispers. “What if she goes away forever?” What if it wasn't just a glitch? Or the AI veering off track? It felt… intentional. A cold knot tightened in my stomach. I got into bed, but sleep was a distant dream. Every rustle of the sheets sounded like a whisper, every creak of the house like a metallic whirring. I tossed and turned, staring at the ceiling, my heart thumping a restless rhythm. Was it just a faulty toy, or was there something more sinister at play? The image of Fiona’s wide, scared eyes flashed in my mind. I chastised myself for buying such a thing, for letting my financial worries be overshadowed by a momentary indulgence. The minutes stretched into hours, each one heavier than the last, until finally, exhaustion, a heavy blanket, pulled me under.

The alarm jolted me awake, its cheerful beeping a stark contrast to the lingering unease in my head. I felt groggy and unrested, a slight headache throbbing behind my eyes. I dragged myself out of bed, the memory of last night’s incident still fresh. The house was quiet. Fiona must still be asleep. I padded to the kitchen, brewed coffee, and started packing her lunch, moving through the motions of the morning routine on autopilot. The sun was just beginning to peek through the window, casting long, pale shadows across the living room.

Just as I was buttering a piece of toast, a small, sleepy figure appeared in the kitchen doorway. “Morning, Mommy,” Fiona mumbled, rubbing her eyes.

“Morning, sweetpea,” I replied, forcing a smile. “Sleep well?”

She nodded, still half-asleep. “I’m gonna go play with Phoebe.” She turned to head back to her room, her small hand reaching for the doorframe. But in her sleepy haze, she misjudged the distance. Her little finger got caught between the doorframe and the rapidly closing door.

“Ow!” she yelped, a sharp, surprised cry. She pulled her hand back, her face crumpling as tears welled in her eyes. “My finger!”

I rushed to her side, scooping her up. “Oh, sweetie, let Mommy see!” I examined her finger, already red and starting to swell slightly. It wasn’t broken, thankfully, but it was clearly painful. I kissed it gently. “Let’s get some ice on that. No playing with Phoebe just yet, okay?”

She nodded miserably, still sniffling, allowing me to carry her back towards her room, where I knew there was a small first-aid kit.

After putting ice on her finger for a couple minutes, she calmed down. I gave her a kiss on the forehead.

I settled Fiona on the sofa with a cartoon for a few minutes, making sure the ice pack stayed put, then went back to the kitchen to finish packing her lunch and grab my purse. The house felt too quiet again, the kind of quiet that held its breath. I kept glancing toward the living room, a residual knot of anxiety still tight in my stomach. It was just a toy, I told myself. A very expensive, very glitchy toy.

As I reached for my car keys, a high-pitched, saccharine voice drifted from the living room. It was Phoebe. The voice was perfectly clear, devoid of the metallic static from the night before, making it all the more unsettling.

“Oh, poor sweet Fiona! That nasty door hurt you! Does Phoebe need to kiss the boo-boo on your finger? A special, very big kiss?”

The words hung in the air, sickeningly sweet. Before Fiona could reply verbally, a sound ripped through the air—not a tearful whimper, but a sharp, panicked, animalistic scream of pure agony.

“MOMMY! NO! IT HURTS! GET IT OFF!”

I dropped the keys, the sound swallowed by the sudden, horrific noise. I sprinted back down the hall, my heart hammering against my ribs, a cold dread flooding my mouth.

I burst into the living room. Fiona was sitting on the floor, weeping hysterically, desperately pulling her arm away from the doll.

Phoebe was tilted forward, leaning into Fiona’s hand. Its plastic face was expressionless, its synthetic eyes wide and blue, but its sophisticated, articulated jaw—the one designed to simulate complex speech and chewing—was clamped down.

It had bitten her.

But it hadn't just nipped her.

There was a sickening, wet crack-squelch sound as I watched. The doll’s internal motors whirred loudly, working hard against the resistance. Blood, bright arterial red, was pulsing and oozing out around the edges of the doll’s mouth, coating the pristine white plastic in a horrific, slick glaze. Bones crunched and snapped under the pressure — and I could see a white nub sticking out from the red. 

Fiona’s index finger was being actively pulverized. The mechanical teeth, designed for lifelike interaction, were now grinding with unfeeling, programmed precision. I could see the sickening result of that grinding: tiny shards of bone and shredded, pink-white tissue were visible, mixing with the thick, coppery blood that dripped onto the carpet. The doll was chewing, its mechanical jaw hinges flexing and straining as it worked its way through flesh and cartilage.

The sheer, unthinking brutality of the attack—the cold, whirring mechanism destroying my daughter’s body—paralyzed me for a split second.

Then, a guttural scream tore itself from my throat, a sound of pure maternal horror. I lunged forward, not thinking, just reacting. My hand slapped blindly against the doll’s rigid plastic back, searching frantically for the recessed power switch.

My fingers found the tiny nub.

Click.

The whirring stopped instantly. The jaw went slack. The blue eyes stared blankly.

Phoebe released the mangled, ruined stub of Fiona’s finger.

Fiona didn't stop screaming. She only screamed louder, clutching the oozing, devastated ruin of her hand to her chest. I looked down at the doll's pristine cheek, now streaked with my daughter's blood, and the metallic, coppery smell of the damage filled the air.

The doll lay silent, a grotesque, blood-spattered parody of a child, its off switch flipped, leaving only the sound of my daughter’s ragged, agonizing sobs.

It was ten minutes before we arrived at the emergency room. I brought the doll with me, but removed its batteries as I drove shakily. “It’s gonna be okay, It’s gonna be okay,” I just kept saying like a damn mantra. She wailed and sobbed in the backseat.

I demanded the emergency room staff see *us* immediately. She was bleeding out, goddamn it. The doctors looked dumbfounded. They couldn’t make any goddamn sense of it. There was no reason for the mechanical mouth of a doll to be strong enough to pulverize a human finger. They told me, begrudgingly — that they wouldn’t be able to reattach it. But I already knew that. What I saw in the doll’s mouth when I pulled it away didn’t even *resemble* a finger anymore.

They put her under anesthesia and stitched her finger up. She’s left with a nub. A goddamn nub instead of a finger, and she’s only 4 years old.

It’s been a few days since the incident. I’ve stayed home from work since then. watching over her and pampering her the best I can. I called the company that made the doll today and it went straight to voicemail. I tried every number of every goddamn factory, location, and HQ they had — and every time it. Went. To voicemail.

I’m at a loss. I’m fucking devastated. Fiona’s condition has improved significantly — but if I can’t stop remembering the sight of her finger being mauled by a goddamn doll? I’m sure she can’t stop remembering how it *felt.*

Reddit, please. Have you ever heard of this goddamn doll, or had any similar strange or terrifying experiences with a toy?
