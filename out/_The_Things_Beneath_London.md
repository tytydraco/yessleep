I’ve always loved the Underground. There's something about it that's nostalgic, like a secret world buried beneath the city, with its rhythm. But I've learned to be careful about what you fall in love with, because sometimes, the deeper you go, the darker the things hiding there get.

It happened one cold evening. I'd been working late, the usual routine. The last train home. Empty stations, echoing footsteps. It was the kind of silence that made you feel like you were the only person left in the world.

I was just about to board the last train when I noticed them. At first, it was a vague feeling—like a slight itch on the back of my neck. Maybe a bug, perhaps a draft. But then that feeling became sharper, like a needle pricking my skin. I swatted at it, irritated, but it didn’t go away. It felt like something was following me. Something that wasn’t quite right.

I tried to brush it off, but when I looked around, I saw them. Mosquitoes. They weren’t the usual ones that buzz lazily around in the summer. These were different. Bigger. Darker. Their wings made a sound that felt heavier than anything that small should be able to make. They circled the station in a slow, deliberate pattern. Not random, like mosquitoes usually are, but calculated. Intentional. There were more than a few, and they seemed to be watching me.

I tried to ignore it at first. Mosquitoes are pretty common, right? But these... they weren't acting like normal insects. They didn’t scatter when I swatted at them. They didn’t seem to be leaving me alone. I felt something crawl under my skin, an itchy, burning sensation that didn’t make sense. I looked at my arm. There were already dozens of bites. Swollen, red, angry. But I didn’t have time to dwell on that. I just needed to get out.

I pushed through the turnstiles and headed for the platform. But then, I wasn’t alone anymore. A few of the station workers were standing nearby. Their faces were pale and tired. One of them, an older man, noticed me looking and glanced around nervously.

“You should be careful,” he said quietly, almost like he was talking to himself. “They’ve been multiplying in the tunnels. It’s worse than before. They breed down there—and it’s not just the mosquitoes.”

I stared at him, confused. “What do you mean?”

He looked away, his eyes darting to the shadows. “They’ve been evolving. Growing. More aggressive. They’re adapting to the heat, to the damp. They’re becoming something else. Something meant to live down there now. And it’s not just them. It’s everything. The whole system’s changing.”

I felt a chill run down my spine. “Evolving? In the tunnels?”

The old man nodded slowly, his gaze flicking nervously to the dark corners of the station. “It’s the heat from the trains, the moisture. The deeper you go, the more you feel it. Those tunnels? They’re more than just old railway lines. They’ve become something else. And those mosquitoes? They're not the only things that adapted.”

Before I could ask more, the last train pulled into the station. He gave me a sharp look and turned away, disappearing into the shadows. I didn’t get the chance to ask him anything else.

I tried to shake off his words, but the feeling of dread only deepened. When I stepped onto the train, the atmosphere was different. The air felt thicker, the buzzing around me louder. I glanced out the window, my reflection warping as the train jerked forward. The lights flickered in the tunnels. And then, another bite.

But this time, it wasn’t just a single prick. It felt deeper. Like something was crawling under my skin. The sting burned like it was digging in. And the worst part? I could feel them moving, burrowing deeper. I couldn't stop it. They were inside me.

I started to panic. I pushed my way through the train, desperate to get to the door, but the tunnel seemed to stretch out of control. The train kept moving, but I wasn’t sure it was even taking me anywhere anymore. I didn’t know if I was still in the Underground. The station, the workers, the train—they all blurred together into one sickening, feverish dream.

By the time I reached the platform again, I was dizzy, and shaking. The mosquitoes were still biting, their wings buzzing in a low, sinister hum. I managed to make it to the surface, gasping for air. But the bites didn’t stop. My skin was on fire, crawling with an itch I couldn’t shake. Even outside, in the cold London air, they wouldn’t leave me alone.

I still hear them. Every night. The buzz of their wings, crawling under my skin. I don’t know what happened down there, or what the workers knew, but I feel... different.

Some say the mosquitoes aren’t just biting anymore. They’re changing us in tiny ways.  
Passing things in their saliva.  
New infections, maybe.  
Maybe something else.

You can still ride the Underground safely.  
Mostly.

Just... don’t take the last train.  
And if you feel a sharp prick on your skin and you’re alone in the carriage,  
**don’t scratch it.**

They can smell blood.  
They can feel heat.  
They can *follow movement*.

The tunnels are their world now.  
We’re just passing through.
