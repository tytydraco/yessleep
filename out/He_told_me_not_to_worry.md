“Good afternoon, Mr. Doe I will be your surgeon for today’s operation. You can call me Doctor Jack.” He told this to me as he strolled into the surgery room with practiced confidence. He wore blue smock over his scrubs and lab coat. He had a pair of boxy glasses with gold wire frames. The clean glasses reflected the light of the room preventing me from seeing more of his features stowed away behind them. Dr. Jack’s other features that should have shown closer to his mouth were covered by a surgical mask and cap. I turned my head to respond to his kind greeting.

“Good afternoon to you as well Doctor Jack.” I barely managed to speak coherently through the throbbing pain in my abdomen. He noticed my discomfort and did his best to reassure me, as futile as it was.

“Do not worry Mr. Doe the procedure will begin shortly. This will be a very quick procedure that will leave you feeling new soon after. Just to be sure I have all the correct information, you are here for the appendectomy, correct?” The shooting pain that originated from my torso made it hard to string together whole thoughts, but the softness in his voice put me at ease. Now that I am a little more put together and the doctor has moved close enough that I can finally study his other facial features. His eyes were light blue. Not normal blue though. That color brought me back to a time in my childhood, but at what moment? Ah that’s it, they remind me of the bright blue sky on a clear summers’ day on the beach. The way the Doctor eyes were shaped made me feel that he never stopped smiling. He had deep crow’s feet from years of life that he could not seem to shake despite his high paying position. Something felt wrong though, but I could not quite put my finger on it. Did he truly walk over to me or was it something more? Why were the lines from his constant smile cut so deep into the contours of his face? What could make him want to smile that much? I shifted in discomfort as my gaze met him. Why was he looking at me like this? Oh, he is waiting for an answer.

“Yes, Doc that’s what I’m here for.” The growing pain starts to dig its way to the front of my brain. Part of the back of my gown had opened and I could feel the creeping coldness of the rigid steel table underneath me. As my thoughts are running while through my head I start to realize, where is everybody else? Like, are there usually nurses or something to help with surgeries? Even in television shows there are at least one or two nurses to help. There was no one here though. Just me and the Doctor which felt strange. My train of thought was swiftly interrupted by his words.

“Do not worry Mr. Doe, everything will be okay.” Those words didn’t sit well with me. They almost seem false. He didn’t give me much time to think about it though because he promptly put on the mask for anesthesia over my face and nose. My heart began to race as even more thoughts about what may have truly been happening here.

“I am going to administer the administer the anesthetic now. Please count with me if you can.” Something in him changed, something was wrong now. It must be the adrenaline in my system. I can see these changes in him now. Like he stopped hiding the truth from me. As if his true colors are starting to show themselves to me. His eyes are no longer calming blue, but now they look like the eye of a hurricane. So gentle at its center until you hit its outer edges. There is nothing you can do in a hurricane at, well at least not one this strong. His eyes now filled me with dread as I realized he was a force I could not overcome. His smile turned unnoticeably until now into this dark and gruesome smile. No longer mean happiness, at least not in the same way.

“5...” I could see pleasure overcame his face. What about this whole experience that was pleasing to him? It couldn’t be, could it? Not what I think it is.

“4…” He is supposed to be one of the good guys though. Why does he want to do this to me? Is he really going it…

“No Mr. Doe, I am not like that. I am not evil, and I am not going to kill you. You get to keep the thing you call a life. I just need something from you in return.” I began to fight the anesthetic to stay awake. As I began to struggle, I realized that I was strapped to the table. As I tried to move my hands, I realized that they were so tight that I could even wiggle in the slack of the cuff. There was nowhere for me to go. I feel like a mouse stuck to a glue trap.

“Mr. Doe please do not make this harder than it needs to be. As I said earlier, it’s a simple procedure. All I need from you in return is to borrow that husk of flesh you call home. Well, more like what you keep in there. You say I am what you might call an entrepreneur. The only issue is my products of choice happen to be difficult to come by, but you my friend are ripe for the picking.” What does he mean? Is he harvesting me? Like my organs? Why is it getting hard to see? Oh, it’s the lights they are getting brighter. My breathing is shallower. This must be it.

“And 1. Goodnight John and thank you for your sacrifice.”
