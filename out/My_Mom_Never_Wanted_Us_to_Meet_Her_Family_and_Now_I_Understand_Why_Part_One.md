"Mark!" My mother called from the kitchen. "Mark, come in here!" I paused the movie that was playing on Netflix and came into the kitchen, not knowing what to expect. In my mind, I thought that she was upset because I didn't take out the trash, or that I didn't wash the dishes right, but when I saw the expression that she wore, and the fact that she was holding onto a piece of paper, my heart sank. I now thought it was my report card. "Mark, sit down, I need to go over this with you," My mother continued, pointing at the dining table. I sat down then, bowing my head a bit, eyes fixating on my hands as they trembled.

"Mom, if this is about that F I got in photography, I can explain." I said, not looking up at her. "Mr. Smith gave me an F because I keep taking pictures of the ground and screwing around in class. I'll try my best to-" My mother slipped the piece of paper in front of me then, sitting down thereafter, and allowed me to take a good look at it. Thankfully, it wasn't my awful report card. Instead, it was a letter saying that her father, the last living relative of her side of the family, was dead, and that we had inherited his farmland in Minnesota. "Oh, *shit*, Grandpa died?"

"Yes, Frank finally kicked the bucket," My mother replied flatly. I looked up at her then and cocked my head to the side, unsure of why she had so much bluntness to her voice. I had never met the man in my entire life, nor did I hear a *single word* about him, so I had no way of knowing why my mother hated him so much. "And now we own that fucking farm."

I smiled and said lightly, "You speak about this as if you were talking about some sort of *vermin* dying." My mother scowled in response to this and snatched the letter away, getting up from the table. She paused for a moment then, spat on it, and ripped the paper up, throwing it into the trashcan by the refrigerator afterwards. Neither of us said anything for a few moments, and then I asked, "Mom, why are you being so aggressive right now?"

"Frank is- *was*\- the worst human being I have ever known. You and your father would *never* understand what he was or what I saw him do." was the reply. "That man was the scum of the earth. Complete and utter *trash*," My mother looked over at me then and gave a small, wry smile, going on to say, "Just like that report card that came in the mail today." I felt a jolt of fear rip through my spine when I heard that, fear so strong that it cut off my ability to speak. "Fix that shit or you're going to be sent to that farm *alone* to live amongst the filth," I nodded, standing up to leave the kitchen. I was just about to go to my room when my mother stopped me by saying, "We're *not* done here yet. *Sit back down*." I sat back down, almost robotically, bowing my head again. *The apple doesn't fall far from the tree,* I thought, my eyes tearing up. *Especially nowadays.... She hasn't spoken nice to me or acted normally since I was in middle school....* "Anyway, we own the farm now and I have to figure out what to do with it."

"You mentioned filth earlier," I said meekly. "So I'm assuming old pops-" 

"Don't you *ever* call him that again!" My mother snapped viciously. A bit of her spit flew into my eye and since I was too afraid to move, I didn't wipe it away.

"My apologies... But, since you mentioned filth, I would assume that he was some sort of hoarder or plainly didn't clean?"

"Nasty old man he was."

"So, that's a *yes*?"

"*What* is your *point*?"

"Get the farm demolished if it's such a health hazard." I said. "Or clean it and sell it to someone." 

"Well, aren't you *so* smart!" was the response. "Oh, yes, I would love to just bulldoze the whole fucking place and dig up the...! Mark, I'm not asking you for advice. I am just telling you about what is going on." *Dig up the what?* I thought. *What could possibly be on that farm?*

*"*When are we heading out to the property?" I then asked, trying to refrain from crying, shaking, and pissing off mommy dearest. "Or are you not-"

"*That* is none of your concern!"

"Ok.... Well, um... Whenever you feel like telling me, just give me a knock on my bedroom door and I'll pack my stuff." I said. "I'll be toeing the line in twenty-five-"

"Shut up with that JROTC bullshit and go to your room!" My mother hollered, pointing towards the living room. *Note to self: don't use JROTC jargon around mommy dearest, even though she was the one who pressured me to join.* I thought, getting up from the table. My body, which was tense with fear, locked up for a second, leaving me unable to move, something that made my mother even more angry. "HURRY UP!" My next thought was then, *Jawohl, mein Kammandant,* and I forced myself to unfreeze, rushing to my room. I shut the door and locked it, proceeding to have a bit of a breakdown which consisted of crying, shaking, and muttering to myself about what happened. After about fifteen minutes of this, I collected myself and sat down at my desk, where I began to start my AP history homework, looking up information about Napoleon. I tried my best to concentrate but found this to be fruitless- the mystery behind what happened at that farm my grandfather owned kept eating at me. Eating at my soul, to be honest, and such a thing made me open a new tab and search for any news about messed up farms in Minnesota. If the evilest man ever created ran a farm and it was as disgusting as my mom put it, there had to be some leads to what happened and if anyone had made any reports. 

I waited for the search results to pop up, and when they did, most of the articles were about major farms that had accidents or E. coli outbreaks. It was all the usual stuff that you would hear about on the news. But, after flipping through some pages, I hit a lead that made me physically sick to read. It was a forum post about a guy in Minnesota who passed by a farm and saw an elderly man dragging what looked to be a broken wheelbarrow filled with severed body parts. 'It was starting to turn to nighttime,' the guy wrote. 'And I was driving down a dirt road after work. The road was bordered by a tree line for several miles until it hit an open area of corn fields. There was a farm up ahead that appeared to be falling apart and filled with what looked like junk, and when I got close to it, I saw an old guy dragging a broken wheel burrow. He stopped as I passed and when I looked at him, I saw what appeared to be a few arms and legs sticking out the sides. I thought I was just tired and was seeing things, but when I got home and told my wife about it, she said "I don't think you were imagining things. There have been horror stories circling around since I was a kid about that farm and how the owner is a cannibal. You're lucky that he didn't ditch the wheel burrow and start running at the car."' 

"Jesus *Christ*!" I muttered, gagging. "Jesus... Jesus Christ *almighty*...." I spun around in my chair and faced the bed, hunching over, my elbows resting themselves upon my knees. I then rubbed my eyes, took a deep breath, and returned to the computer screen, scrolling down to see a bunch of comments from people who lived in Minnesota who spoke of the same things that the guy's wife did, but with more information added on to it. Apparently, the farm was originally owned by a man named Sylvester Kosky, a Russian immigrant who had come to the United States in 1949. He had a wife, whose name was unknown, and a son in 1950, whose name was Franklin, and a daughter in 1952 named Silvia. Both parents and Silvia were known to be regular people, but Franklin was remembered as a problem child that had a tendency to mutilate and kill farm animals. This murderous habit was what linked him to the death of his sister in 1969, since her body had signs of torture by electrocution and was cut into pieces that were spread across the farm, but the police dropped him as a suspect because Franky-boy had the alibi that he was at the movies at her time of death. His friend George later backed him up and brought out two movie ticket stubs that had the exact date and time of the murder. "George, you're a fucking *asshole*," I said, shaking my head, continuing to read, finding that three years after this murder, both of his parents disappeared and were never found. "George, you're not just an asshole now, you're a little *bitch*, because you prevented this-"

"Mark," My father's voice said through the door. "Can I come in?" *Fuck,* I thought, closing the tab. *Dad's home from work and if he sees me looking up shit about some crazy guy killing people, he's going to push for another psyche- eval on me. I can't go to that damn therapist again.... She smelled like mothballs and kept slurping tuna-noodle salad at me.*

*"*Yeah," I said, trying to sound nonchalant. My father opened the door and came into the room, a disappointed look on his face. I watched him sit down on the bed and he sighed, clearly about to give me the stereotypical, 'I'm not mad, just disappointed' talk. "Buddy, your mom.... She.... She said that some of her medical marijuana was gone from the bag. Do you know where it went?" 

"Mom thinks I'm smoking her grass?" I said, still feeling angry at George and his dumb ability to let murderers get away with things. "Where the hell did *that* come up from?" 

"She said that your grades have been failing and that it might be from taking her marijuana," My father said, his face gaining a concerned expression. "So... Are you taking it or *not*? You can be honest with me." 

"Give me a piss test and I'll show you that I'm not," I said bluntly. "But that's not what I'm concerned about right now-"

"What could a teenager be concerned about? Your life is *easy*," was the reply. "You don't pay bills or buy groceries or pay a mortgage. All you are expected to do is go to school, do whatever you do *after* school-"

"JROTC." I said. "I do that afterschool because mom wants me to. She said it would make me a man."

"Regardless, you do all that, come home, do your schoolwork, eat dinner, and go to bed. There is *no way* that you have other things to be concerned about." 

I clenched my jaw for a moment and said, "Did mom tell you about what happened recently?" My father shook his head, furrowing his brows. "Her dad died and we inherited the farm."

"Mark, Grandpa Frank died in a car accident twenty years ago and the farm was given to your Aunt Lacey," My father said, now appearing more concerned and somewhat frustrated with me. "Your mom told me that."

"She *lied*." I stated promptly. "She lied because she doesn't want people to know what happened on that damn farm." 

"I'm starting to think that you are high *right now*, Mark." 

"If you don't believe me, look in the kitchen trash." 

"I'm not digging in the trash to feed into-"

"I'm telling you, look in the kitchen trash."

My father quickly stood up and stormed out of the room, going into the kitchen. He was gone for about five minutes and then came back, his hands empty. "Didn't find *anything*, Mark. You're grounded for a year. No phone, no computer unless you're doing schoolwork, and no time off on weekends. When the weekend comes, you're joining me at work to help with construction." For context, he was a welder for a local construction company that was, at the time, renovating the town library. "Give me your phone." I handed him my phone and said nothing as my father left, slamming the door behind him. A few minutes passed and I heard my parents talking in the living room, and then my mother yelling about how I was a no-good junkie who was probably not only smoking weed but also crack. *I see what you did,* I thought. *You told dad the weed thing so then he could come in here, question me about it, hear about the letter, get prompted to go find the letter, find nothing, and then cut off all of my ability to contact people so no one finds out about the farm. That's so fun, right?* 

"I have to make a plan now," I said. "I have to make a plan on how I'm going to expose this depravity and get an investigation going on the farm.... And, maybe get old mom-'o arrested if she's linked to stuff too." I honestly couldn't give two shits and a brick about her trying to keep this a mystery at that point. Justice had to be made. 

Three hours passed and I started to smell dinner. I quit my research- I hadn't really found anything else on the forum, so I didn't exactly feel any urgency to keep going at that time- and went to the door, only to find that it was locked from the outside. *Oh, great, she locked the door while I wasn't paying attention,* I thought. *That's amazing.* "Is Mark joining us for dinner?" I heard my dad's voice say from the kitchen. 

"Let him starve," My mother replied. "He could loose a couple of pounds anyway. Probably gained that weight from smoking all of that dope." The messed-up part about this comment was that I wasn't even fat- I had actually gained a lot of muscle from doing weightlifting after school. "Hank, we have to do something about him,"

"Like?"

"Send him away to a boarding school."

Boarding school my ass. I remembered what she said earlier about sending me to that farm by myself to be amongst the filth, and I knew that's where her mind was going. "Honey, if that's what you want to do, then we'll do it. I'll support you every step of the way. He needs to get clean and get back to being a functioning member of society." My father said. 

"I suggest we send him in a few weeks." My mother suggested. "I know of one in my hometown." 

"Great.... I'll let you take care of that." was the reply. *Of course, he wants to do whatever she is suggesting to keep the beast at bay,* I thought. *I just wish he knew where exactly she's intending on sending me to..... Looks like I have to plan faster than I thought.*
