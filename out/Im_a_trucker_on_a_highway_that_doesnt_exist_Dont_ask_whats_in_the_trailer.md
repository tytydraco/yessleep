As you might remember, I ended my last post with a delightfully heroic announcement. I was going to save Tiff, defy the road, and risk my very life to do so. As befits the commencement of any noble quest, I started my journey in the same way as any fearless hero.

I tried to get somebody else to do the work for me.

“Randall―” I began.

“I get the impression you're about to say something I won't like.”

“―we need to rescue the stranded truckers.”

“Thought so.”

“There has to be something we can do to get them out. Tiff doesn’t even have a vehicle anymore. She says her old one broke down, but maybe we can haul her a car.”

“We’re not in the business of handing free cars to non-employees.”

“I’ll buy it,” I said.

“Maybe she can share with Al.” The *other* driver stuck on Route 333. The one still driving.

“This isn't funny.”

“Of course, it isn't funny!” Randall slammed his hands on the desk and shot to his feet. “I find nothing humorous in you messing with things you have no idea about.”

“Maybe if you answered more of my questions, I *would* have more of an idea! You don’t get to hand us an obscure employee handbook then expect us to be good little soldier boys who follow your every order without ever giving us any explanations at all."

“Yes, actually. I do get to expect that. That’s what the extremely generous salary is for.”

“Oh shove off. Money doesn’t let you treat us like crap.”

“Oh?”

I think it was his smirk that did it. Randall was fuming as much as me, but he still managed a satisfied smile as if to say, *You’re stuck. You know it. You won’t leave.* And he was right. Nowhere else paid this well, not for a college grad. I’d moved my whole life to California. I absolutely couldn’t go back now…

But that smirk.

“Find a new driver.” I stormed out of the office.

For any of you who’ve fantasized about doing the exact same thing at your current job, I can assure you it feels every bit as good as you imagined and more. I kept expecting the horror of what I’d done to hit, but it didn’t. Instead, I seethed on my drive home. I seethed as I heated up dinner in the microwave, and I seethed as I went to bed. 

It had been so long since I’d cared about anything, that I forgot how strong it could feel.

I woke up at one AM to a screaming cell phone.

Those of you who’ve read this far have probably noticed my attempts at sleep often get interrupted―faceless men watching me, exes licking my face, the likes. If you’re bored of this repeated occurrence, I’d just like to add my signature to that ballot. At what age did eight hours of healthy sleep become such a wildly unrealistic request?

I was so groggy I didn’t even bother to check the caller ID before picking up. Big mistake.

“We need you to come in,” Randall said. “*Now*.”

“It’s the middle of the night.”

“This is an emergency.”

I cussed him out. “If you’ll remember, I quit less than ten hours ago.”

“You're not still going on about that are you? You didn't quit. You just stormed out. Look, I apologize for whatever it is that made you so ticked earlier, alright? We good? Now, stop throwing a fit and get yourself to the terminal.”

“I'm not coming in.”

I hung up on him mid-sentence.

If I weren’t so tired that probably would have felt almost as phenomenal as walking out. At least until the point that Randall called again. 

I declined. He called again. I declined. He called―I kid you not―twelve more times. *Twelve.* Probably, I should have blocked him at that point, but I still wasn’t thinking straight. The thirteenth time, I finally picked back up.

“Stop!”

“*Please*.” Randall’s tone was different now. He’d lost his usual superior edge. There was only desperation. “Brendon, this isn’t a game. Come in tonight, right now, and I'll include a ten thousand dollar bonus on your next paycheck.”

My finger hovered above the hang-up button. “Not a bonus,” I said. “A yearly raise.”

“That's not how promotions work here.”

“It wouldn't be a promotion. You would be rehiring me. I already quit remember?”

Randall cussed me out. It felt good to hear him so undeniably lose his cool. “Fine! You win. You’ll get your rehiring bonus. Just come in.” His tone lowered. “Okay, but we're not really redoing the paperwork for you to be fired and rehired. That's just excessive."

“It is.”

Did I feel like a sell-out? A little. But at least Randall was pissed. My grand defiance for authority had lasted barely eight hours, and I now knew my ego was worth a scant ten grand―more than I’d thought actually.

Student loans really are no joke.

As soon as I reached the truck yard, Randall handed me a cup of coffee and a set of keys.

“The trailer’s already hooked up. You don’t even need to take it far tonight, just get it onto Route 333, and then you can sleep for a few hours if you want.”

“Where am I going?”

Randall exhaled. He handed me a map, something he’d never done before (I hadn't even known maps of Route 333 existed), and showed me where I was headed.

“But that’s at least five days from here. That’s a ten day haul. I only brought one set of clothes.”

“I threw some of mine in the cab.” When I tried to interrupt, he held up his hand. “And *yes,* it’s one with AC.”

There was that at least.

“What’s in the trailer?” I asked.

He didn’t even respond, just raised an eyebrow, back to his usual condescending self. That was fair I supposed. I *had* agreed to take the job again, and I knew the rules. No peeking.

Obviously, I’d asked the other drivers about what we were hauling. They were more than happy to offer up knowledge like best pullouts for a quick nap, what diners fried the best bacon, and how to avoid running into the things with zippers on their stomachs. Any time I tried asking about our cargo though?

The mood changed. Their faces darkened. They sobered.

“Sometimes not knowing a secret can drive you mad,” Deidree confided in me once, “but sometimes it's knowing the secret that does it. In this job, you have to figure out which it is.”

I didn’t trust that management always had our best interests in mind, but I did trust the other drivers. I gave up asking what we were hauling. I let myself stop wondering. If I could live with not knowing that probably meant it was the latter of Deidree’s options: finding out would be the worse alternative.

That night though, driving through massive redwoods beneath a starry sky, I wasn’t sure. The not knowing. The *wondering*. It was going to kill me.

I was so distracted, it took me almost by surprise when my rig sputtered, slowed then stopped. By now, I knew to expect this interruption. It happened every trip down Route 333. The exact location would vary, but it always happened in the redwood section. 

Per usual, I clicked start on the stopwatch I’d begun carrying. Somewhere around a minute fifty-five, I stopped it. There was no point in keeping track of the time anymore.

I already knew I’d been stalled for too long.

*Control your breath. Don’t panic. Close your eyes. Hide.* 

This hadn't happened since my interview, but I’d always known this was a possibility. The other drivers talked about multiple minute time outs happening to them, and none of them had ever gotten hurt. All I had to do was crouch in between my seat and the sleeper bed, shut my eyes, and ignore the very real fact that these things had my scent.

The footsteps began. They scurried around my rig. Occasionally, things would tap or knock on the metal. Something yanked at the door handles. They stayed shut. At one point the entire truck shuddered as if a dozen bodies were slamming themselves against one side in an attempt to tip it. The truck stayed put.

It would get worse I knew. That’s what had happened the first time. The footsteps had increased steadily, until I could hear nothing else, and then the engine had started― except the footsteps didn’t get worse. Instead, the scurrying calmed down. 

The forest dwellers were still out there. I could hear the pitter of feet, but it was calmer, less frantic. Was this some sort of a trick? Did they think I couldn’t hear them and would open my eyes?

A moment later I knew that theory was wrong. They weren’t trying to hide. They were trying to quiet down enough to speak with me. 

“Give it to us.”

The voice wasn’t a voice exactly. It was the rustle of leaves, the snap of branches underfoot, and the tinkle of windchimes, all somehow combined in a way that formed words.

I held my breath.

“We smell you, He Who Dwells on Stone. Your odor has presented itself here once before, in our domain. We demand an audience.”

I kept still. Was there anything in the employee handbook about actually speaking with them? I didn’t think so, but maybe I’d missed it. *Maybe you should really read the whole thing, Brendon.*

The strange not-voice seemed to sigh. “Speak with us, or we slash your tires.”

A pretty convincing argument in my opinion. “What do you want?” I asked.

“The thing you carry in your moving device. Relinquish possession of it to us.”

“Interesting proposition. Unfortunately, the cargo isn’t really mine to begin with, so I’m not really in a position to hand anything over. I’m sure you understand.”

“Relinquish it, and we will allow you open passage through our lands for the rest of your travels. Do not, and we will tear apart your machine.” *Also* a pretty convincing argument.

“What is it?” I asked.

“That is not an answer one life force may give another.”

“K, so like you don’t know.”

“Of course we know,” the thing said defensively.

“Really? Because it sounds like you’re bluffing right now.”

“*We know!*” 

The thing calmed itself down. “Relinquish your load and we will allow passage to all of your kind for the next generation.”

I remembered the man skewered on the hood of his truck. These things weren’t bluffing. They could kill us and *easily* too. How many people would I save over a generation if I agreed?

And yet…

I didn’t know what was in my cargo, but I did know these things killed humans for merely looking at them. If they wanted my haul, it couldn’t be for anything good.  

So I did the only thing I could think to do. I stalled.

“How about a clue?” I asked. “Surely, you can give me a clue of what I’m hauling.”

It couldn’t, it informed me. So I pushed. The thing got more and more frustrated. I got more and more anxious. The footsteps grew restless again. They began circling my truck, looking for a way in. One of them―I got the impression it was the one speaking to me― scratched at the door. It slammed against the window. The sound of cracking glass.

“You are merely attempting to waste our time,” the forest thing accused.

“That is the plan. Yes.”

It slammed the glass again. More cracking. *Bad. Real bad.*

I could practically sense the creature drawing back, preparing for a third and final strike, about to break in―

The engine roared to life. I whooped and scrambled for the front. Just before I uncovered my eyes though, I realized the footsteps were still there, circling my truck. 

They hadn't left.

I didn’t consider. I didn’t allow myself time to think up a secondary plan. I just leapt into my seat, threw the car in drive, and slammed my foot on the gas―all without looking. 

The truck lurched forward. I forced my eyes to stay closed for *two, four, six* seconds, before letting them spring open. A turn was coming up. I jerked the wheel to the left but not in time to avoid the low hanging branches that battered against my front windshield. I retook control, never slowing once, and never glancing in the rearview.

I'd escaped. 

It was only a couple hours later, when I was well into the desert and far enough to feel comfortable, that I finally pulled to the side of the road to survey the damage. The driver window had splinters running through it. There were dents along the skirt of the freight carrier, but it was otherwise intact.

I circled to the back to make sure everything was still locked and secure. It was.

*Everything’s fine. Get some sleep. You’re fine.* 

And then, as often happens just after the movie protagonist says, “It’s all good, guys,” I was immediately disabused of my delusions of safety.

Something was crying.

I pressed my ear to the metal of the freight. Sure enough, inside the container, faint but audible, was a little girl’s sobs.

“Hello?” I asked. “Do you need help?”

The crying cut off. I waited another ten minutes with my ears pressed to the container, but the crying never started again. The thing stayed silent.

It would have been easy. For the sake of my sanity, I could have chalked it up to imagination. I was sleep deprived and in shock, and of course I’d heard crying. It was my own inner child acting out from revulsion at this entire stressful situation. That’s what it was.

But it wasn’t.

I’d learned something, though *what* I now knew, I wasn’t totally sure. Was the thing in the cargo bay a person? A creature? A child?
