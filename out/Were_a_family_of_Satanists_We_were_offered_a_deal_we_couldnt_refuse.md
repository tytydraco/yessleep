[part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/dDb9H2jCGA)
Prayer had crossed our minds. A lot had at this point. 

And in a small bid for normalcy- I hoped for just one more day of nothing but my family. If there is a God- would that be too much to ask for? 

My head throbbed as I willed myself up. My blanket was hot to the touch, weighed with sweat- and my first instinct was to look over, checking on my son and wife. 

"Honey?"

I mutter to the empty space. 

I blink away my tired state. Miranda is a lot of things- certainly no morning person. And so, I got up. Dragging the curtain along, letting in the sunlight. Letting it lay on my spot of our unmade bed. 

I catch something at the corner of my eye. 

Peaking- just quick enough to almost miss him. 

*Tommy?*

I swear I heard a giggle. 

I follow. A small smile creeping up on me. Is it out of character for Tommy to want to play? Yes. But yeah... maybe there *is* a God. I'm going to try and enjoy my day with my family. 

The hallway is littered with clay- one of Izzy's projects no doubt. And in the distance, I hear Justin- just downstairs in conversation with who I'm assuming is Matt- guess he decided to pay us a visit. That's okay- he's important to Justin. He's family too. 

Tommy peaks the corner again, a fleeting smile then small steps down the staircase. 

"Tommy? Whatchu doin buddy?", I asked, holding back my chuckle at his odd behavior. 

I pass Izzy's room. The last of the clay leads- you guessed it- to her door. Covered in sketches of our family- not a single stick figure- *portraits*. Much to her talents. 

I can make out the sound of wet clay being maneuvered. It's a faint moist recurrence- constant and an indicator of my little girl's happiness. So I open the door, just taking a peak at her masterpiece. 

"Sweetheart? What are you working on so early?", I forced myself to maintain a casual cadence- despite the sight in front of me. 

She didn't respond. 

But I certainly get my answer. 

*"Nothing daddy! Just got a bit inspired"*, Tommy chirps. 

My hand grips the doorknob. I'm not sure why- I wasn't going to run from my own daughter. I suppose it was just the duplicity of the scene I was beholding. The sun shined through- dancing all through Izzy's room from the window- just over her bed. A few rays hitting her latest creation. 

She's sculpted me before- I told myself. She's memorized my features, and interpreted them without much effort. In an admiration, she'd immortalized me.

This.. was different.

Like I said- Tommy answered my question. Or rather- Tommy's voice. So innocent in delivery. I'm holding that innocence in my very hands. I'm knelt, I'm hunched over in an expression akin to horror, a friend of grief. My jaw stretched in the wet clay, there's a palpable dread- maybe it was the sight of me stuck in a silent scream- or maybe I was simply projecting. 

Tommy's head- just his head- fits perfectly in my hands. I'd never imagine such a thing, but it's done so well, so to scale- with perfect proportions, for a moment I had to consider if I wasn't the copy, gazing at the original. 

*"What's wrong daddy?"*

Tommy speaks once more. 

It's movements are fluid- human. And my daughter is on her knees, her fingers placing finishing touches on my jawline. She moves with a frustration, trying to get the stubble right. 

"N- nothing dear", I smile, "what should I make for breakfast?"

*"Toast please!"*, Tommy screeches, hyper and boyish. Not my Tommy- but close enough to urge me to slowly close the door. The scene- the sunlight on Izzy's head- her back to me in concentration. My mortified existence pleading before her in the warm glow of a new day... I seal the scene away as best as I can. 

And I follow my son downstairs- his giggles still leading me.

Tommy sounds far, probably in the basement.

"Dad? Can you please tell mom it's not my turn to do dishes? I did then yesterday remember?", Justin called. He must've heard my steps down the stairs. 

Even though I was certain Tommy was below us, I take a quick detour into the kitchen.

Justin shoots me an annoyed look. Stood at the sink, as he claimed- he's... washing dishes.

I stare at the soapy liquid as he spoke. 

"It's Izzy's turn, Matt's waiting for me in the living-room." 

"And he'll continue waiting until you finish those dishes- I'm sure your boyfriend can handle a bit of distance", my wife teases, swaying in her blue sundress, sizzling something at the stove. 

"Dad? Please. Can you take over?", Justin complains. 

"No... no... listen to- listen to your mother", I mutter. 

"Fuck", he sighs.

"Language", my wife warns. 

"Sorry..." He mumbles. 

I would've taken over my son's task. Really I would've.

But the tint of the soapy water- made me think twice. It's the deep- deep red. Thicker than any water I've seen, almost fighting his movements. And clotting on the surface. 

I took a step towards him, the liquid glistens with light from the kitchen window, and a small summer breeze wanders into our home from the fluttering curtains beside our son. 

His lettermans jacket was rolled to his elbows. His forearms showing off bone. Flesh peeling off and sinking in meaty clumps. Two hands, surfacing from the liquid- scrape at what's left of his skin. And he didn't react- the task was an ordinary inconvenience- 15 minutes of his life he'll never get back. And nothing more. 

I almost wish there was pain in Justin's face. It would led me some camaraderie. But no, he carries on. Every movement sways the bits of flesh dangling from his red, soapy bones. And the hands that claw at it- almost as if being drown by him- they don't relent. Fighting for breath. 

"Dear? You slept in today", She said, turing to me. 

My eyes dart from our son, immediately grateful at the sight of my wife. Potent in her normality- she's gorgeous- she's mundane in every way and it shamefully shields me from the image of our son. His flesh still splashing into the background. 

*Scrape... drop... scrape...* 

"Morning... h-honey", I offered, planting a soft peck on her cheek. She smiles- radiant, truely. 

"Hungry?"

"No.", I responded. 

I'm not sure why I lied- I'm starving. But I lie anyway. 

She narrows her eyes- playful but I'm not fooling her in the slightest, "you realize dieting doesn't mean skipping meals"

"Dads dieting? Why?"

"Watching his figure. I'm not opposed", she smirks turning back to the stove. 

"Ew", Justin comments 

*Scrape... drop... tare*

"By the way, dear", Miranda starts, "Matt is in the living-room, poor boy is still awkward around you so go easy on him"

"Yeah", Justin agreed. 

"... I will"

"Good. He told me he's nervous about seeing you. I told him that won't be a problem. Don't make me look bad", She warns, before offering once more. "Are you *sure* you're not hungry dear?"

"No. No thank you, I'll be back- I need to find Tommy" 

I claimed, walking out of the kitchen. 

They don't stop me- I'm not sure what I expected from them. But I'm relieved either way. 

Tommy's giggle rose once more. Still in the basement. And at the moment, I can't stand the feeling of my baby boy not in my hands. 

Alone. 

"Mr Crowley?"

I pause, not having noticed the boy on our couch. 

"...who?", I ask, wandering to my own living-room as I I'm trespassing. 

The couch is facing away from the door, facing the TV. 

The screen is static. A white noise. 

I creep over to the boy, who continues to speak, "Mr Carter...", he mutters. 

No no... that felt intentional- whatever he just addressed me as. 

I expected the worst. And I wasn't disappointed. There's the lingering of rust in the air around him. Metallic, and completely overpowering. He's sat back, a polite smile on his face. The same way he would on any other day. 

He tried to stand, I told him to sit, he listened. 

"Matthew. Why are you here so early?", my tone comes out more stern than I intend- pure panic dressed in authority. 

"Mr Carter. I... I meant to borrow Justin for the day.", he starts, "I'm- I know you have your concerns because... I'm a year older but, I promise I care deeply for your son and-"

"*Stop talking*", I ordered. Gathering a small breath. 

It's not the worst thing I've seen all morning- maybe that's just cause he wasn't a kid of mine. I saw Matt as family- I remember thinking that- I guess from my reaction alone, that's not entirely true. 

The couch is stained with red. 

Matt has no arms. Bloody stubs cutting off just above his elbows. Gesturing subtly as if his limbs are still attached. 

There's a reason I asked him to sit back down- I didn't believe he could actually stand- his knee is completely twisted. Bending the wrong direction, sticking out awkwardly. My eyes flow it's movements as he speaks. 

"Did I say something wrong Mr Carter?"

"..." 

"Mr Carter?" 

"Are you... feeling alright, son?", I asked him. 

He took a moment to respond. As if feeling through his own body- deciding if he felt any real pain. 

"I'm fine, Mr Carter. I'm here alone because I got a little light headed after helping Mrs Carter with breakfast."

"...you helped her?"

"She said she needed some... special ingredients? I told her its no problem. I'm happy to help!"

...

"Yes...Matt, you may- you may borrow Justin for the day", I said softly. 

Maybe it was guilt. Pity? 

But meeting the sockets where is lively eyes used to be, I have a clear answer. 

Fear.

"Oh really? *Thank you- thank you- thank you, Mr Carter!* I promise I'll take good care of Justin today. We'll stay out of trouble- and I'll be a perfect gentleman. I'll-"

"I'm glad he has you, Matthew", I interrupt him. I mean the sentiment- as startling as this whole interaction is... honesty brings comfort. 

He gives me one last smile- ear to ear with no bad intent, it reaches the sockets where his eyes should be and there's a slight flush to his cheeks, matching the rivulets of blood flowing down them.

"Thank you, Mr Carter"

"...you're welcome, Matthew", I mumble, wandering around the couch, out of the room with no other words exchanged. 

The little will I have left, drags me towards the giggles of my boy. And so- I walked down the hall, to the very last door. It creaked open.

...

And so do my tired- *tired* eyes. 

My arms wrenching from their sockets in absolute- numbing agony. 

My head rises, my chest letting in a tight breath. Coming out in shutters and coughs. Echoing in the empty pews. Bouncing off of every cold concrete wall. 

The fading into silence. 

My vision clears. 

Turns out I do have an audience. 

They're sat in those very pews. Just three of them- not much but, really the only audience that matters. 

I weakly smack my lips, wetting my tongue for the act of speaking. 

The wait in silence, until I croak, "My babies... my children"

The phrase lingers unclaimed by them for a few long seconds. 

Then, unanimously-

"Hi dad", the oldest says

"Hi daddy", the two younger siblings say in unison. 

It's somber. But its a welcome sight. They're sat right by each other- hands interlocked- I'm assuming in comfort. 

I haven't even taken in my state. 

How I hang from a wooden plank, strung up by my arms- wrists bound by chains, and spread apart at if to inflict the most possible discomfort. 

"...how are you f-feeling dad", Izzy asks. 

I look to her, only for a moment, the weight of my own head being too much to carry for long. 

"I'm... honey... what happened?", I ask. 

And It seems nobody is in a hurry to answer- I suppose that's no issue, it's not like I'm in any rush to get anywhere myself. 

"He doesn't remember", Tommy says. 

"He *never* remembers.", Izzy asserts. 

"We'll just- we'll just remind him", Tommy reasons. "...again"

"No.", Izzy protests, getting on her feet. Her steps are frantic, her sobs muffled as she walks down the aisle, out the door, all the while mumbling, *"I'm so sorry- I'm sorry- I'm s-sorry"*

"You should comfort her", Tommy suggests.

"I will... first we h-have to deal with dad", Justin says, a clear effort put in at keeping his voice even. 

"You know you're not good at this part.", Tommy counters, placing a gentle hand on his brother's shoulder. "I'll handle it. You... will be more useful with our sister- she needs you more"

Justin's head lowers, bobbing with uncertainty. He glances to me. And I see my younger self in his somber stare. I see the man I was when I bought my first house with Miranda- he's a carbon copy- with a soul that couldn't be a greater deviation. In the best possible way. 

"Yeah... yeah you're right", Justin mumbles, getting up, sorting out his flannel shirt and walking out, a quick swipe at his cheeks and chin for good measure. 

The door let's in a weak- early morning light, then shuts us back into the dimmer interior. The grim, restless state of an empty place of worship. 

"Dad?", Tommy speaks up. 

My eyes meet his. 

I take a ragged breath, "Tommy..."

He shows a shallow grin, "I don't remember the last time anyone called me that."

My eyebrows furrow at his claim. And I listen as he continues. 

"How are you feeling?"

Poor timing on my part- a harsh cough leaving my lips, echoing the empty space, and earning a flash of sympathy from Tommy's features. 

"I'm fine son. Now that you're here", I rasp. 

"You don't- notice anything different about us?", he asks. 

I let my head hang, putting all my weight on my arms, just to rest my neck as I respond, "You're my babies. You'll always be-", I choke back another cough. 

He says nothing to interrupt. Probably waiting for me to finish my claim. But I simply stare at my legs, dangling above the ground. Atrophied and delicate in their permanent rest. I doubt I can still walk. It's been- 

It's been too long. 

"...do you remember?", he asks again. 

And I weakly shake my hanging head, "...no"

Tommy takes a small breath. 

"Mormus.", he mutters a name that forces me to lift my head, "They never left us alone... we tried- *you* tried. You tried to protect us. You tried to keep us, and in the years to come, your knuckles were bone white from your grip on Izzy, Justin, Mom and I. You fought. For two years."

"..."

"You did consult a priest. Against all our beliefs as a last resort. They... they weren't much help. They claimed God was punishing us for our lifestyle. They called child protective services- which... is what ironically ended up shutting down this church. Glass houses and all that", he explains.

My boys demeanor. His awkward- almost overthought movements and monotonous voice. He's older- sure. But that's my Tommy. Still to this day. 

"When everything failed. We turned to darker stuff." He  clears his throat, swallowing his discomfort, "the final straw was when Mormus tried to take me. Permanently. And you took the leap. You forsake anything and everything holy"

"Sounds..." 

"Sounds like you?", Tommy guesses, "I'd agree. You had tunnel vision, dad."

...

"Did it work?"

"...in a way", Tommy mutters, glancing at his hands on his lap, "manic is the best way to describe it. You... pulled us from our beds one night. You asked us to trust you. And we performed a sort of... ritual. A pentagram. Candles. Blood- the whole works."

"That's... I don't believe in-"

"You don't. But you were desperate. We all were and nobody else was helping. For a moment there- it felt like God himself left us to our own devices" 

"Did he?"

"He did." 

I let out a shuttering sigh. "What went wrong"

"Nothing. You were offered a deal. By the figure in the candlelight. Your soul- and we'll get a place in hell. With no such suffering- it has it's conditions but... it felt like our only option- we had no chance at heaven." 

"How do you know?"

"Everything in that book is true. Word for word. The kind and the cruel. All of it. There's plenty of innocent people that won't see God. Justin for example- he had no chance. It was really a choice between suffering in hell or comfort"

"I took the deal.", I rasp matter-of-factly. 

"You took the deal, dad. And... we... we went to bed.", he lets out a quick humorless chuckle, "We didn't even see you leave. You were just gone the next morning. And mom- mom, *she* couldn't comfort us in her grief stricken state. Izzy... Justin... that whole day we drowned in our own tears. But we could feel Mormus' presence was long gone. Chased away by an evil that swore to protect us", he wipes away a tear before it falls. 

"Later on... we found out that this deal has been offered to Satanists in the past. Keep your family in dalmatian or forsake them and... well nobody knows what happens because Satanists would always choose their families. It's built into the belief system- Mormus... the mockery of an angel... was just a pawn", Tommy's sure in his words. 

"...it feels like-...I made the right choice, sweatheart", I whisper.

"Are you sure?", Tommy challenges. A deep sadness in his eyes. And his question does linger. 

I chose to protect them. 

I chose to leave them. 

"How's your mother?", I ask. 

"...mom... she's... she's good", Tommy says. 

And for the first time since I've laid eyes on my little boy, I know he's lying to me. 

For my own good. 

My Miranda is gone. For whatever reason, she was ripped from her children. And if Tommy thinks that reason might just break my resolve? I won't push further. I'll believe the lie. I'll take solace in the thought of her, swaying in her sundress- laying cradling Tommy against her chest. Everything she was. In all her magnificence. 

The doors push open once more. Two sets of steps coming back in.

Despite my desire to see them, my head won't left anymore. I can feel my strength diminishing. 

"He's... almost gone again.", Justin's voice says, "we should... we should do the thing." 

His voice has a quiver. But is determined. 

Three sets of steps walk towards me, stopping just a few steps away.

"Daddy? I... I'm- I'm getting honored. For my g-grants. My art scholarships. I'm... I'm helping kids like me. Who have one way to express themselves, and want nothing more than to build a life out of it.", Izzy says. 

"...that's my girl", I whisper. 

I hear a whimper or two. The attempt at a response, but ultimately nothing. 

"Dad? Matt and I adopted a few months ago.", Justin sniffles. "Triplets. They were just born... they're the b-best thing that has ever happened to me. And I... promise... I won't let them down."

"...what are my grandbabies names?"

"...Miri... Mickie... Saint" 

"Tell them they're grandpa...", I take a greedy breath, softly gasping at the air around me. My request left lingering in the tension. 

"I know, dad.... I tell them everyday", he promises. 

My harsh breaths take over the silence. 

And my chest burns with everything I could say- but can't force out. 

But Miranda and I...raised smart kids. I'm sure they know everything I could tell them. 

"Now... sleep... dad", They all say in a quiet unison. 

And I feel whats left of my muscles relax. My eyelids slowly gaining a heft. Hanging on the wooden plank, that's crossed with the one bolted to the ceiling. A crucifix. The devil has a sense of humor.

"We'll see you again. Next year. We'll be back.", Justin assures. 

"Until then... have peaceful dreams.", Izzy whispers, "... they are peaceful... right?"

I will myself to gain one more blurry image of my children, all stood in concerned anticipation for an answer. 

"Yes, Sweetheart. They're... peaceful", I promise, falling back into the abyss of my mind. 

Mormus wasn't going to take my children. 

And I'd make the choice to sink into the same abyss over and over again until time collapses.

For them? I would burn the world. 

Or at the very least- burn my soul.
