I’m sorry I haven’t updated. I thought I wasn’t going to have to.

The other night, after the incident in the basement, I threw out the book. I threw it straight into the Dumpster and didn’t look back. I assumed that was the end of it. I went to my pet sitting with a clear mind and hopeful outlook.

The rest of the day went great! That immense exhaustion I was feeling wore off with each passing hour. I felt free. I even went into the basement to finish my laundry. No knocking. No sense of someone watching me. Scout hasn’t growled or barked or whined. I had a great night’s sleep, too, and woke up rejuvenated.

I went out for breakfast. I completed other chores. I took Scout for a walk. All that silly paranoia and stress over a book. It was just a book. The more I pondered it, the more naive I felt. I couldn’t believe I let a book dictate my emotions and actions like that.

Everything was going fine. I foolishly thought—even though this sounds absolutely insane—that I had beat whatever that book had done to me, whether it was just my mind making mountains from molehills, or if it magically was some shadow monster unleashed in my home. I thought I won.

I had never been more wrong.

When I got home from picking up dinner yesterday night, what waited for me on my coffee table as if I hadn’t touched it since the day before?

The book. *The book.* Wide open.

I dropped the bag with my sub and chips, and my entire body froze.

I slowly approached it, and even though I had left off on page nine, it was open to page eight.

*There’s nothing you can do to get away.*

*There’s nowhere to go that it won’t follow.*

An array of curse words met the tip of my tongue, but none broke through my lips. Before I could begin to process the absurdity of the situation, I realized something else.

Scout didn’t greet me when I came in. She hadn’t even made an appearance.

I strode across the living room, my eyes glued to the book as I passed it, and called for my dog. I checked my room. Not there. I checked the kitchen. Nope. I checked the bathroom. Nothing.

I continued to call her, louder each time. Small, rapid footfalls finally answered, ascending the staircase from the basement.

I opened the basement door and up flew Scout, through the door and into my room. She jumped on the bed and curled up, her ears down, tail tucked. I called for her softly and extended my hand, asking how she got down there in the first place as if she’d actually reply, and she *retreated*. She got up and scurried to the other side of the mattress. Being down there for a bit must’ve spooked her. I had parked my car in the garage and thought maybe I left the door open by mistake. Scout is a curious girl…

But what would make her act this way toward me? She’s always happy to see me when I get home.

My head snapped toward the coffee table, to the book.

I went to it, stared at the words, and then snatched it and sat on the couch. I flipped to page ten, a sudden determination overwhelming me.

It’s just a stupid book! It has no power. I didn’t know how it got back into my house, but I wasn’t going to let it control me. Not anymore.

*How did it come to be?*

*It’s everywhere and nowhere.*

—

*It searches for a being to call its own*

*You’re lost in a land you can’t escape.*

—


*A reflection that walks without a mirror.*

*It isn’t you, and yet, it is.*

—

*What it is doesn’t elude you.*

*It could be your neighbors, your family, and your friends.*

—

*It’s closer than you think.*

*It’s here to stay.*

—

*All it needs is your name.*

My eyes were fixed on the final page, that final sentence that differed from the rest of the book. A single line. Six words.

*All it needs is your name.*

A burst of anger shot through me, and I threw the book. It collided with a wall opposite me, leaving silence, save for my heavy breaths, in its wake.

I paced the room, nails digging into my scalp.

*It’s just a book.* But if I tossed it, it would just come back, right? Like before? What should I have done? What did any of it mean?

Scout whined.

I hurried to my bedroom where she was just lying there, whining. I went to pet her, and she retreated again, cowering as if I was some sort of stranger.

Then, the knocking arose again. It was crisp and clear, but it was far enough away that I couldn’t pinpoint where it was coming from until I saw I hadn’t closed the basement door from when Scout ran up.

I walked into the doorway and peered down at the figure in the darkness. It was still, silent, and featureless. It was the first time I had faced it head-on.

“What do you want?” The question was quiet. The fists I balled weren’t.

It didn’t respond.

“What do you want!” My voice reverberated off the walls. “What do you want! What do you want! What do you want!” Each time, I got louder, more demanding, more desperate. Tears pricked my eyes. “What do you want from me!”

“Alice?”

I whipped around to find my roommate in the living room, a look of pure horror on her face. The moment was short-lived as my stomach hardened at a terrible realization…

*My name.*

I turned back to the foot of the staircase. The figure was gone. I backed away and closed the door slowly, feeling almost manic.

*My name.*

*My name. My name. My name.*

I said nothing to my roommate. I went into my room, shut my door, and climbed into bed, still wearing the jeans and sweatshirt I had on all day.

I suddenly felt defeated, defenseless, worried.

I left my light on. Not the unicorn light–no. The overhead light. I’m so tired. I’m so scared. I’ve never been this scared in my life. Scout’s at the end of the bed. She hasn’t taken her eyes off me. The floorboards have been creaking again, and there was a sound akin to something dragging along a wall.

It was midnight when the footsteps stopped outside my door.

—

*Ignore the knocking at your door.*

*Keep the light on, and it’ll stay away.*

*You’ll hear a familiar plea and scream and cry.*

*Don’t give in.*

*Don’t search for it.*

*It has already found you.*

*There’s no use hiding.*

*It knows where you are.*

*The day is your friend.*

*For shadows reside only in the dark.*

*Once you let it in, it’ll never leave.*

*Don’t close your eyes; don’t fall asleep.*

*When it has caught you, praying won’t help.*

*You’ll never see the light of day again.*

*There’s nothing you can do to get away.*

*There’s nowhere to go that it won’t follow.*

*The shadow will remain in yours.*

*The closer it creeps, the weaker you’ll become.*

*How did it come to be?*

*It’s everywhere and nowhere.*

*It searches for a being to call its own*

*You’re lost in a land you can’t escape.*

*A reflection that walks without a mirror.*

*It isn’t you, and yet, it is.*

*What it is doesn’t elude you.*

*It could be your neighbors, your family, and your friends.*

*It’s closer than you think.*

*It’s here to stay.*

*All it needs is your name.*
