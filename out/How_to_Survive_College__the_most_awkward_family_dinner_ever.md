You’re all going to find out some stuff about Grayson [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/103p0s3/how_to_survive_college_im_becoming_bffs_with_the/).  Personal stuff.  I’m not entirely sure I should be sharing it like this but at least this is anonymous, right?  I am going to ask for one thing, though.  I know wild speculation is pretty much the norm for all of you and I do appreciate it - it’s so helpful to have other ideas to consider, after all.  Also sometimes I need to be able to laugh about everything that’s going on.  But for certain things regarding Grayson, I don’t want to hear anything but respect for his situation.  You’ll know what I’m talking about when you get there, trust me.

Nothing but respect.

Or I’ll stop updating you about anything that involves him.  You’ll never see me type out his name ever again.

Got it?

Okay.

I finally went to dinner with Grayson.

(if you’re new, [start here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/rnauck/how_to_survive_the_holidays/), and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/s75n1c/how_to_survive_college_index/))

I’d been guilting myself into giving him an answer with little success.  I guess I’d rather live with the self-loathing about my own indecision than do anything to actually relieve it.  However, something happened that forced me to make a decision.

Daniel needs help.  Desperately.  And we haven’t found any solutions for him yet.

I really am better at doing things for other people than for myself.

We’ve been keeping in touch with him via group text.  He updates us about the scratching at the door every time he hears it… which is most nights.  I think he’s staying up late enough to hear it, sends us a text about whether he thinks it’s louder than before or anything else he notices, and only then he goes to bed.  We’ve tried a few things to dissuade the larva but with no success.

I tried opening one of the other doors in the hallway but it was locked and when I shook and pounded on it, nothing answered.  We considered breaking one open, but we decided against that in case it was another steam tunnel situation and we’d wind up somewhere weird.  It’s still on the list of things to try, but we have some other options to get through first.

One of those being the insecticide route.  It took four tries.  Maria was the one who succeeded.  There wasn’t anything physically impeding us from throwing a bucket of chemicals on the thing.  It was that weird sluggishness of our thoughts that got in the way.  Like everything slowed down and started skipping over the actions we needed to take.  And when I tried to figure out what I was there for, I managed to look back and then - bam - I was back at the start of the hallway and the larva was far in the distance.

Maria managed to pull through, though.  I had argued about her going into the hallway at all, but she’d snapped that it was only right that she help, and *besides*, that thing wasn’t dangerous to us.

“It’s not dangerous until it gets a facefull of chemicals,” I muttered.

But then she’d grabbed the bucket and stormed off down the hallway and after that I didn’t have much of an argument.  She succeeded in remembering what she needed to do on her second attempt.  Got the insecticide right in its face.

Aaaaaaand nothing happened.

So we’re still looking for answers.  I did put up a charm bundle on his door, and my own for good measure.  And Maria’s.  I called Tyler and asked if he’d send me a couple.  Told him that it’d make my mom feel better.

I didn’t actually tell my mom I was doing this.  She’s a bit sensitive about the inhuman and maybe it’d make her feel better or maybe it’d remind her of how dad just… vanished, out there in the fields.  I don’t know and I’m not gonna find out.

Not much time had passed after the failed poisoning attempt and we were diligently trying to figure out what to try next (we’re thinking fire, but we want to make sure we can get away with a) smuggling it in and b) use it without setting ourselves on fire in the process) but Daniel was silently cracking under the strain.  He could only be brave for so long and then one day, he snapped.

Fortunately, the way he handled his mental breakdown was by showing up at my dorm crying.  Someone recognized him in the lobby and knew they’d seen him hanging out with me before, so they let him up to my floor.  That’s how I was sitting there, minding my own business with the dorm door open, then suddenly he was there in the doorway sobbing messily.

Cassie is aware of the situation, as I had to reassure her that I wasn’t about to “make bad dating choices” (her words, not mine) again when I started spending half the night at his dorm.  Once he was inside our room, she quietly excused herself to fill up the eclectic kettle for tea and shut the door behind her.

I didn’t get a word out before Daniel was yanking his sleeves up and shoving both arms in my direction, palms up.

“It’s getting worse!” he said.  “Look.  Look!”

Scratches.  He wasn’t drawing blood, but he was scratching.

“I didn’t even realize I was doing it until the hour was up,” he continued.  “I was sitting there, listening to the scratching, and then it got quiet and I looked down and my arms were all red and they hurt.  How can I just - just *sit there* and not realize what I’m doing!?”

“Uh, the inhuman has a way of messing with you-”

“I know!” he howled.  “But what do I do about it?”

He collapsed onto our futon and buried his head in his hands.  He took a deep breath and then another.  I awkwardly handed him a box of tissues, even though he’d stopped crying.

“I might have an idea,” I said.  “Maria can keep figuring out the whole gasoline thing and I can follow up on this.”

He eyed me suspiciously.  I can’t blame him.  His life is literally on the line, if I were him I’d want to be absolutely certain the people saying they’d help me weren’t just trying to make me feel better.

“I know someone that might have access to more information,” I continued.  “I’ll see if I can get them involved.”

“And what do I do?” he asked hollowly.  He sounded hopeless.

“Keep making your log of what is happening every night.  We know what the pattern is, so let’s see if we can find a crack in it.  If it keeps getting worse… we’ll try tying your hands down for the night.”

He was worried enough that he didn’t even try to make the obvious joke (and I stg I don’t want to see it in the comments).  Somewhat reassured, he left just as Cassie was returning with the water.  She stepped aside to let him pass and then put it on to boil anyway, raising an eyebrow at me and waiting for an explanation.

“I need your help picking out an outfit,” I sighed, picking up my phone.  “Something nice.  Like… church nice.”

Then I texted Grayson that I’d like to take him up on that offer of dinner.

There aren’t any rich people where I grew up so I had no idea what to expect when Grayson picked me up the next evening.  He was also dressed nicely in a button-up shirt, which I guess it might be weird to dress up for dinner at your own house, but maybe he suspected that I’d be dressed up and didn’t want me to feel out of place.  Or maybe that’s just what you do when you’re the son of a university president.  Either way, it cemented in my mind what I was expecting to find.  A big house.  A yard with a cobblestone driveway and marble statues flanking the entrance.  A dinner prepared by a hired chef.

The reality was underwhelming.  My expectations had been set way too high. Certainly, it was the nicest house I’ve ever been in, but it certainly wasn’t a mansion.  Just an old brick house with slate shingles, a well-tended yard with tasteful landscaping (and Grayson said they did hire someone to take care of that), and a two-car garage with new but practical cars.  The interior featured a lot of brickwork and wood floors.  My house back home has wood floors, but they’re old and in desperate need of resurfacing after years of abuse from a family full of kids.  Grayson’s house looked like it’d been installed yesterday.  The rest of the house was similarly perfect, immaculately clean and decorated in a tasteful, but unassuming sort of way - the kind of interior you’d expect to see in a magazine article.  ‘Farmhouse chic - 101 ways to look rustic but also stylish and spend a lot of money in doing so.’  That sort of thing.

“Only the first floor is like this,” Grayson whispered to me as I stood there awkwardly in the entryway, afraid to touch *anything.*

“Do you get guests a lot or something?” I whispered back.

He nodded, but didn’t reply, because his dad was coming in to greet us both.

His dad… well, my mental image was of someone tall (which now in retrospect is a stupid assumption because Grayson is short) and imposing, deceptively strong and maybe wearing glasses on a nose that has a hint of being broken in the past.  The kind of person that appears respectable but could throw down if it came to it.  In short, the kind of person that could run a university full of monsters.

I was wrong on that as well.

His dad is a dumpling.  A watery dumpling.

He tottered over to us and seized my hand, forcing out a thin smile and saying it was good to meet me.  He’d heard so much from Grayson.  He called me by name, but the name he used was ‘Luke’.

Behind him, Grayson shot me an apologetic smile over his dad’s shoulder.  Then his dad released my hand and before I could say anything, he meandered back the way he came, saying he’d check to see if the pork was done yet.

“I, uh, had probably better go with him,” Grayson said.  “I actually do all the cooking.”

“*Luke?*” I hissed.

“He, uh, well.”  Grayson blew out a nervous breath.  “You’ll see.”

I wandered around downstairs as much as I dared while Grayson finished up in the kitchen.  I could hear him talking to his dad, mostly telling him to put things down and stop helping.  Finally, Grayson reemerged and announced everything was ready.

They have two dining tables.  Like.  Who has two tables?  But I guess that’s what happens when you have a largish house and there’s a dining room.  We were eating at the kitchen table, which was significantly less formal than the dining room and I was quite grateful for that.  I didn’t really want to eat in a room with a hammered tin??? ceiling and wood panel walls and the portraits of former university presidents staring at me.  I get the feeling that the room is reserved for the important guests, the ones that donate lots of money to have buildings named after them and stuff.  I got to sit at the kitchen table, which was separated from the actual kitchen by a half wall, and I was very grateful for that.

Grayson led most of the conversation.  He made sure to pause every now and then and let his dad say something.  It quickly became apparent why Grayson was so reluctant to talk about his family and why he wanted me to see it in person.

There’s something wrong with Grayson’s dad and no, it’s not normal medical something wrong.  I think that might be easier.  At least you could understand it and there’d be a prognosis and a timeline to expect.  This… it’s like he’s only present when talking about the university.  Grayson gently reminded him of who Ashley was and he followed along for a little while, then started calling me ‘Alice’ which I suppose is closer than ‘Luke’.

But when Grayson mentioned his classes?  His dad changed.  His eyes grew sharp and he sat up straighter.  He no longer looked like a dumpling, squashed in on himself with his head hunkered between his shoulders.  He smiled and asked me if I was enjoying mine, so I told him I was majoring in geology.

“Oh, then you’ve taken the introductory class with Professor L,” he said.  “And this semester… you’d be in the class that covers dinosaurs, right?”

I said that I did, though I admitted it could be dry at times.  He laughed.

“You can say it’s boring,” he chuckled.  “I keep telling him to abandon the slideshow presentations, but he has his system all worked out… ah well.”

He continued on that track for a little while, asking about my general education requirements and if I was getting good help from my advisor.  I said that Professor L. actually looked my schedule over and he nodded thoughtfully, distracted for a moment.  I felt a little bad.  I might have gotten the advising office in trouble.

Then Grayson changed the topic to something going on in town, outside of the university’s influence, and his father shriveled up again, nodding absently.  His mashed potatoes fell off onto the plate and he put an empty spoon in his mouth without noticing.

“I’m going to go get dessert,” Grayson said abruptly.  “I’ll be a moment.  It’s in the basement fridge because I ran out of room upstairs.”

This was my chance.  I took a deep breath.  As soon as I heard Grayson’s steps on the stairs, I looked at his dad and asked my question.

“Do you know anything about a scratching in the dorms?” I asked, trying to sound casual, even though my heart was pounding.  “A friend of mine says there’s something scratching at his door every night.”

Again, that shift.  This time, however, his dad got up from his chair.  He walked over to where I was sitting, frozen in shock and confusion.  There was a wild, dark look on the man’s face.  His features were strained, like every muscle in his body had gone tight all at once.

“You… heard… *nothing*,” he hissed, towering over me.

I remembered Daniel’s sobbing.  His hopeless, hollow stare.  I *made* myself remember.

“Please,” I whimpered.  “My friend is going to die.”

The president’s hand shot out and seized my shoulder.  His knuckles dug into my skin like marbles.

“He has to kill it.”

Then his gaze shifted.  He wasn’t looking at me any longer.  He was looking somewhere else, his stare still fixed on my face, but he didn’t see me.  He was somewhere else, somewhere far away.  His eyes were wide and his breathing was short, panicked gasps.  He reminded me of a fish, tossed up onto land, convulsing and flailing to find its way back home.

“Before it gets too big.”

What was I doing?  I started to panic.  There was something clearly wrong with Grayson’s dad and I’d agitated him, I’d awakened *something* and I couldn’t undo it.  I regretted coming here.  I regretted asking.

The only way out was through.  I had to find out what I came here for.

“I was told it couldn’t be killed,” I gasped.

“It’s the only way.”

I stared pleadingly up into his watery gray eyes, bloodshot and peeled open as far as they could go.  I felt like my shoulder would crack under his grip.  Desperately, I looked about, wishing Grayson would return and save me from my own mistakes.

Wait.  The laundry lady had said I couldn’t stop it and I assumed that was just her low opinion of me, but what if… what if she were speaking literally?

“I was told… *I* couldn’t kill it,” I said.  “Is.. is my friend the one that has to do it?”

“Before it gets too big,” he whispered.

Then he let go, walked back to his seat, and sat back down with a huff, like a balloon deflating.  I sat there for a moment more, heart racing, and then I looked up and Grayson was standing in the doorway, holding a cheesecake in front of him with both hands.  The expression on his face told me that he knew what had just happened.

No one talked much for the rest of dinner.

Grayson took a winding route back to campus when he drove me home.  I thought he wanted to talk, but he was quiet for a good long while and finally, when we were on main street heading towards campus again, I broke the silence.

“Is it… okay if I ask where your mom is?” I ventured.

I’m not sure why I asked that. I guess… I wanted to know if he was alone in dealing with this.  I guess… I’m worried for him.

But his jaw went tight.

“She’s not in the picture,” he said, in that evasive way that people use when they don’t want to say ‘messy divorce’ outloud.

I didn’t pry further, because I think I know a little bit about what that feels like.  When dad vanished, there was a small contingent in town that wasted no opportunity to announce that *they* believed he’d bailed on us.  Nevermind that mom was scared, my younger siblings were confused, and I just wanted to scream and scream until the world around me stopped and I was finally left with silence.  So I’d be damned if I opened my mouth and said a single word about Grayson’s situation and became anything like them.

“He’s getting worse,” Grayson said, his hands tight around the steering wheel.

“Do you know who did this to him?” I asked.

“The rain,” he whispered.  “The rain did it.”

Then we were pulling up just outside my dorm and I awkwardly said goodbye and I went to my room, feeling like I’d done something terrible.  Like I’d hurt him through my carelessness, through my stupidity, that he’d shared something very painful with me and I took advantage of it to get my own questions answered.

I’d call myself selfish if I wasn’t trying to save Daniel.

I just hope it was worth it. [\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)
