It was a long time ago when me and my friend where outside. He never let me visit his house. Don't know why. He never even told me where he lived. But one day he decided to bring me to his house. So we were walking on this street. Going to his car. We drove in a forest. It wasn't that bright. All the trees made it look dark. I felt very uncomfortable there, so I asked him why we are driving to the forest. So he told me that we just drove by it and won't stop here. He told me his house was outside of it. Right in that moment I started feeling more comfortable. But suddenly I realised that behind the forest are many cornfields and there couldn't be houses. So I asked him about that. He told me that there was his house. Right at the cornfields.

As we arrived I felt uncomfortable since his house seemd very old and wasn't in a very good state. So we went there inside. He rang the doorbell. I could hear some screams there and was very afraid to go there. I asked him about those so he told me not to worry. Since his house is big the parents scream a lot to hear each other. This made me feel better. So his father opened the door. He didn't welcomed me. Nor did he smiled. Just a cold looking face staring at me. He didn't had a t-shirt on or something. Just his naked belly. So we went in there. He had blood on his hands. So I asked my friend about that. He told me that they have animals they use for food. 

We where going to the table in the living room to eat. There was spiders. And a door that was closed with huge chains. I didn't wanna ask him about it since his dad was still in the room. His mom didn't came to say hello or so. He told me his mom was just going to sleep since she was working the whole night so I ignored. I could hear noises below me. Didn't think much of it. Then his das arrived with the food. It was steak. I enjoyed it. Wasn't that bad. My friend told. After the food we where going to his room. In his room he told me that his parents would never let him in the basement. I asked him if the basement was the door with the chains and he confirmed that. So he told me he wanted me to come with him to his basement. He just found an small entrence. It was a hole that was dug behind his wardrobe. This made me feel even more uncomfortable. So we closed the door with his key so nobody could come inside of the room. We heared footsteps. It was his dad. He came up and screamed frightened why we were closing the doors. My friend told him that we wanted to not get disturbed and him to show me his room. His dad just went away.

So we crawled in the hole. It was big enough so both of us could fit in it without a problem. We just needed to crawl at the begining. Afterwards we could just walk. It was like a hallway going downwards. There where very bad stairs made out of dirt. It was creepy and very frightening that there was a place like that. We used his phone torch for lighting. Then as we reached the bottom we saw a door. Luckily it wasn't locked and there was a small window.

As we looked through the the window we saw a room. With red light. It wasn't that bright. Suddenly we saw something. We couldn't trust our eyes. There were humans. And they were tied up by chains. Full of blood. Everywhere blood. The red light made the blood almost invisible on the walls. It was so brutal. Even to that day I couldn't imagine what I saw. Even he didn't knew that. Right after that we heared some locks opening. It was the locks of the basement door from before. And who came in? It was his dad! He went to the people and said:„ you are the next!“ He went to a guy with a axe and a knife. We saw him cut everything out of his body. He also said that his flesh would have a better taste if the victim experienced fear. That was enough for us. We went back up but as I looked back I saw his dad following us. My adrenaline went up. He screamed wait!! We ran as fast as we could. Then we got up.

His dad couldn't fit through the hole so nobody got hurt expect the people in his basement. We got outside. But as we were back in his room his father started screaming so loud that he was about to kill us. He started smashing the door with the axe. The only escape left was the window. His room was in the 1. Floor so we couldn't just jump. There was only one way left to exit. This way was the most brilliant Idea I ever had. So there where much clothes in his wardrobe. We didn't had the time to use them for making a rope. But there was a good Idea. We got the clothes and hung ourselves on a metal pipe that was stretching out. By that we could reach the tree and climbed down. We managed to escape. His father got arrested. They told us that they couldn't send news out since they don't want to make the people living in that area get frightened out of it and go away. So we kept it as a secret. It turned out that the mother was also a victim. He would sexually abuse her. Even the rest of the victims where abused. Also kids died and even two year olds. I hope nobody have to experience what we did. My friend lived with me the rest of his life. It was a very weird experience and I can't sleep very well since this event.
