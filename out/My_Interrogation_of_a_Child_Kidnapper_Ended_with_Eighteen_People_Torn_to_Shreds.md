It was hard not to look at the pale, doughy man sat across from me with utter contempt. Hatred, even. 

His entire frame seemed to roil and bubble with each shuddered and exasperated breath. Beads of sweat cascaded down his bald head, rounding his jiggling jowls and the folds of his neck, dampening the tightly buttoned collar of his too-small dress shirt. 

He fiddled with the handcuff encased around his pudgy wrist, fondling it with his sausage fingers. He’d raise the cuffed arm slightly, exposing a swiftly growing puddle of condensation in the space where his hairless forearm had rested on the metal table. 

That slick sheen of sweat caused his pallid skin to glow under the halogen lights above our heads. 

Edwin Tallor. The sick fuck looked like a giant soft boiled egg. 

Tallor had been on the department’s radar for a good while - he had a few priors for lewd behavior in his younger days, had been caught skulking around outside the middle school. There was even a local rumor in St. Clare that he’d run around in the middle of the night with an undersized children’s private school uniform barely fitted over his fat frame, yelling excitedly about the school year and all the friends he hoped to make.

I know it’s best not to judge a book by its cover, but you could tell just by looking at the guy. Something upstairs wasn’t right. 

The problem with these cases is making something stick. You’ve gotta track these pieces of shit for weeks, months. Following their perverted digital footprint, ensuring you got all the hard evidence you possibly could of their despicable tastes. A fake profile, an Internet chat room. 

It didn’t take much for our officer to coax Tallor into exposing himself, speaking freely of all the little girls he’d done things to. What he wanted to do to her (a 13 year old, by the fake age we’d listed on the profile and reiterated repeatedly during our talks with Tallor), providing visual aids all the while.

 We finally kicked the motherfucker’s door in at 6:30 that morning, and it had been worse than we could’ve imagined.

The worst part wasn’t Tallor’s questionable taste in art; the cartoon drawings and black and white photos of children that adorned his walls. It wasn’t the gigabytes upon gigabytes of illicit material we found on Tallor’s devices once we’d dragged him out of the dingy apartment, handcuffed and blubbering like a plate of flan.

The worst part was the girl he’d been on top of when that door splintered to bits. A pale mountain of flesh in skidmarked tightey whiteys, straddling an unconscious, waifish thing on a dirty mattress. 

As of now, several hours later, she still hadn’t woken up. 

Which brought us to this moment. Tallor stared off into space, still sweating despite the room’s near frigid temperature, still pawing at his handcuffed wrist. I slapped the table, hard. The sound of flesh on cold metal reverberated through the room. 

Tallor jumped, handcuff rattling, chair nearly falling over backwards. He seemed to jiggle faster now, like the fear and adrenaline elicited a physical response. 

“Listen Edwin…” I started, my voice a low growl. “We’ve got you dead to rights. We’ve got your messages with our agent, the one that you thought was a 13 year old.” Tallor’s white face reddened with shame.

“You were on top of that poor girl, we’ve looked at your computer… We can sit here and play with ourselves for all I care. But if you’ve got any interest in making things even a little better for yourself, now’s the time to start cooperating.”

Tallor kept his eyes downcast, fixed on the floor. His shaky breathing the only response to my tirade.

The truth was, we did need the fat man to start spilling his guts. So far, we hadn’t been able to find any information on the girl while she remained in his unconscious state. She didn’t match the physical description of any missing kids in any local municipalities. 

Until she came to, Tallor was our only shot at getting *anything*. 

“The girl!” I shouted. “Where did she come from? Who is she?” 

A grimace crossed Tallor’s face. His round head began to shake from side to side. Finally, he spoke. 

“I guess… she’s still asleep then.” The large man’s voice was soft and meek, with an otherworldly effeminate quality. 

I raised an eyebrow. 

Suddenly, he snapped his face forward to lock eyes with me. “Is she here? Is she at the hospital?” His voice became frenzied, eyes going wild. Tallor made a move to stand, shifting the entire table as he did so. The veins in his neck bulged as his eyes darted around the room.

I jumped to my feet, rushing over and grabbing his free arm to force him back down. “Hey!” I screamed. “Sit your fucking ass  down motherfucker.” His arm was damp with sweat and felt malleable, like wet clay.

Tallor did as he was told, but that manic look didn’t leave his eyes.

“Please, please.” He murmured as he returned to a seated position. “You have to keep her mouth covered. Keep her… keep her eyes closed. Keep her restrained.”

I sneered at him in disgust, fighting the urge to rear back and rearrange some of his teeth.

“Because…” Tallor continued, his voice catching in his throat. “If she wakes up, everyone’s going to die.” 

I scoffed, unable to help myself. “Is that a threat?”

“Please sir.” He continued pleading his case. “Please. You have to believe me. I know I’ve been bad. I know I’ve been a bad man. But that girl…”

Tears welled in Tallor’s eyes. 

He was crazier than I thought. I figured my usual strong arm approach wasn’t gonna do me any good. I needed him to start spewing. Hopefully I’d be able to get my licks in later on, once the situation was a little more under our control.

“Listen Edwin…” I released my grip on his arm and made my way back to the other side of the table. Tallor cradled his shiny head in his free hand. “We want to help her. We want to figure out what’s going on, who she is. She’s been taken to the hospital, we have officers with her and doctors working. We’re all hoping she wakes up.”

Tallor began shaking his head. I continued. “I’m not gonna insult your intelligence: It’s not looking good for you. But listen. You tell us what happened, a bit about her, that cooperation could help *you* in the long run. I know you can tell us who she is, Edwin. What’s her name?” 

Tallor began mumbling to himself. “If she’s at the hospital, then maybe I’m… maybe she won’t…” “Hey, hey.” I interrupted. “Edwin, come on. Focus.” 

Tallor still kept his eyes averted, but he spoke clearly. “Once I met her, once I saw her, I just couldn’t… I mean, I’ve never been able to… They’re just so beautiful when they’re like that. Like her. That’s all I’ve ever wanted.”

I sucked my teeth, keeping my comments and my hands to myself. 

“Serlana.” The word left his mouth after a beat. I waited for him to continue. He didn’t.

“What is that? What does that mean?”

“It’s her name.” The egg-man finally answered. “Thats her name. She’s not… she’s not right. She’s not from this… place.”

“Jesus fucking Christ…” I muttered. 

“Didn’t you people notice?” Tallor continued. “When you took her. When you got her to the hospital. Her skin, it’s so grey. Her arms and legs, her fingers. They’re longer than ours. Maybe at first, maybe you can’t see it. But the lounger you look at her. And her mouth, her teeth… Her eyes.”

I thought about what he was saying. Truth told, I hadn’t looked that closely at the girl when we’d rescued her from Tallor’s clutches earlier in the day. The scene had been an absolute madhouse, and she had been quickly shuffled into an ambulance. To what I could recollect, her skin certainly hadn’t been vibrant and glowing. But she’d been living in hellish conditions for god knew how long. No one would look healthy under those circumstances. 

 But elongated digits and limbs? An… unnatural mouth? Tallor was off his fucking rocker. 

“She’s not like us. *They’re* not like us.” I ran my hand over my face in confused exasperation.

Tallor continued. “Thats why I had to keep her sedated, keep her eyes covered. Because if I didn’t, she’d be able to call out to… her. Her mother…” 

Tallor let the words hang in the air a moment.

“I shouldn’t have taken her. I just… when we talked, when we spoke, I fell in love. I’ve always wanted to love a girl like her. But when I saw what she was, met her mother… I should’ve left it alone.”

My mouth contorted into an expression of disgust and further confusion as Tallor slowly raised his head, a look of pure anguish on his face. Anguish, or fear? 

“Haven’t you ever done anything stupid for love?”

I couldn’t help it. I nearly leapt over the table and grabbed Tallor by the scruff of his shirt with one hand and wrapped the other around his pudgy neck. “I don’t love little girls, you sick fuck.”

The fat egg man wriggled like jello as his cold sweat flopped in all directions.

I glanced up at the interrogation room’s camera. I really didn’t need another incident like this going on my record. I’d always had trouble keeping my cool when it came to pieces of shit like Tallor. Slapping them in cuffs and sending them on their way after a comfortable interview never felt like punishment enough. 

I tightened my grip as he sputtered. 

“No more games, no more fucking bullshit. I tried to hear you out, and you’re hitting me back with some nonsense. Let’s focus on the parts that make sense. You ‘talked.’ When, where, how? You met this girl’s mother?  Get your shit together and tell me the whole fucking story.” 

Tallor swallowed, hard. “Detective, please.” He softly wheezed out the words. “Please just call them. The hospital, wherever she is. Tell them to keep her eyes and mouth covered. Keep her sedated. Please. I’ll tell you the whole story, just please.” 

I shook my head, not loosening my grasp on his neck. “Talk first.” He bared his teeth in a frustrated grimace, but shook his head - best he could while being strangled - ‘yes.’

I let him go, returning to my seat. Tallor rubbed his neck, letting out a few hacking coughs. I upturned both palms and spread my arms, gesturing in front of me. A silent command to begin.   

Tallor sighed, rubbing a clammy hand over his face. A wave of hot air that stunk like milk wafted over me. 

“We messaged on one of those… those Internet chat sites. An art forum. That was a place where I liked to…” His sentence trailed off as his white skin turned flush. 

“Well I was on there a lot. And she, we both commented on the same photo. She replied to a comment that I left. The drawing it was… It was a naked… girl.”

Disgust oozed from every one of my pores.

“I can show you…” Tallor offered lamely. “Later.” I sternly replied. “Keep talking.”

He shook his head. “Well , the comment I left was a heart. And saying how beautiful I thought the picture was. *SHE* answered me. She replied to *ME*. Telling me how… how she could look like that.”

I scoffed. “Sick fuck…” I muttered under my breath. 

Tallor grimaced but kept on, immersing himself in the story. 

“I sent her a message. In her inbox, a DM. She answered back. From the beginning, I could just tell that something about her was…. It was different. It wasn’t right.

“Her profile picture on the forum, it was just a black square. If you enlarged it though, it was like you could make out this faint outline. I don’t know how to describe it, detective. I could tell that it wasn’t a black jpeg, solid color. It was a picture *of* something. Somewhere. I don’t know what…” 

“I stared at that picture a lot. Before she and I actually met. When we’d message and the chat was open, I stared at that void. It was like something… something emanated from it. Even though it was just a picture on my screen.”

The fat man stopped speaking and cocked his head slightly, shifting the blobbed rolls of his neck. I leaned forward in my chair, awaiting his next move.

Tallor shut his eyes hard, and resumed after a pregnant pause. “Something was there, but I guess now I’ll never know what it really was. I can see it though, when I close my eyes tight like that. The something. It’s like… a call, a hypnotic song from… From somewhere else?” He phrased the end of his statement like a question.

I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t intrigued by the psycho fuck’s babbling, but the story was getting a bit long in the tooth. 

“Let’s stay on topic, Tallor. Get back to you and her. The messages.”

Tallor silently shook his head in affirmation, then went on.

“When I messaged her the first time, since her picture was… That, I asked her her age. Asked her if … you know, if she really could look like the girl in that drawing.

“She answered back almost immediately. Like she was waiting for it. Said she was 14. And her name was Serlana. I’d never heard a name like that before, detective. I asked where she was from, what it meant. She never told me. 

“Serlana would use these words that were just wrong and… and strange. She’d tell me about her house, where she lived with her mother and. How it was so cold, and made of concrete. And that it was infested with ‘skrells.’ The ‘korak’ was rising and that meant her mother was having a difficult time.

“It was like she was from some made up foreign country that didn’t actually exist. And she’d never explain what any of the things like that that she talked about meant. One night… she messaged me nearly 20 times in a row, nonstop, saying the same thing over and over. ‘Tyvirk won’t stop screaming.’”

My jaw hung slack in disbelief. “Edwin…” I started. “It sounds like this kid was fucking with you. Talking nonsense and saying weird things. How did you find out who she really was? Where she lived? Why buy into this shit?” 

Tallor scratched the top of his fleshy head. “Thats what I figured, detective at first. I mean… I’ll be honest here, all of our cards are on the table, right? She’s not… well Serlana wasn’t the first…. Girl I ever spoke to. And even with all of the strangeness, the reason I got so wrapped up was… Was when I *saw* her. The first picture she sent me. That first night.

“I asked her what she looked like. Told her I liked… pretty girls, like her. I sent her some photos of myself first and… well, eventually she answered. The first picture she sent was blurry, out of focus. Barely recognizable. A grey smear on a stark black abyss. I asked her to hold the camera steady. Told her how badly I wanted to see her. The next image was more clear…”

Tallor trailed off again. The fat piece of shit was clearly having a hard time keeping his thoughts organized. 

“In that picture, I could see her. Serlana in all her beauty. Her skin was pallid, grey. Her arms seemed to bend at an unnatural angle, like she wasn’t really sure how to hold the camera for a selfie. Wild hair was unbrushed and frayed in all directions. But it was her face that drew me in. Her eyes, they were tinted yellow. Slightly bloodshot, and rimmed with deep black bags. Cheeks sunken and boney. Her gaze was startlingly intense… her black and yellow eyes bore a hole right into the camera. But there was still a… A youthfulness to her, detective.

“Something about her was *wrong* but I could see a girl. A girl who needed something.”

I blew air out my nostrils in disgust. “What happened next? Get to the part where you kidnapped her like the sick fuck you are.”

Tallor stared into space  , not even seeming to absorb what I said. “I could sense this need in her eyes, defective. A want for something that you can’t really place or describe. Something… Taboo? Unearthly? I just… something about it. I felt like I related to her. I’ve always felt different too…”

“Don’t start with that ‘poor me’ shit,” I interrupted. “You’re not getting any sympathy from me. You’re a pedophile, Tallor. If this were a proper country you’d be strung up in the middle of the street downtown.” 

The egg fuck actually *smiled*, sad and weak. It was everything in me not to leap across the table again, 

“I know how everyone feels. I’m not a moron. But I felt like she and I just had this instantaneous connection… we’re both not right.

“I told her I thought she was beautiful, and how she looked sad and lost. And like she needed someone. She told me she did. Told me about her house and her mother and how awful things were. We got to talking almost every day. 

“I guess the specifics don’t all *really* matter. You can check my phone to see for yourself. We sent each other pictures… We poured our hearts out. She told me how sad she was, how rotten life was. That she lived in the dusk and the grey and that she wanted to meet  a man who could take her away from the V’krell and the chothyns… away from her mother. 

“It makes no sense detective, she’s speaking terrifying nonsense, spending me ominous photos. But I couldn’t get her out of my mind. I needed her. I didn’t think her mother could be *that* bad….”

I could sense that the grand tale was reaching some sort of climax. I furrowed my brow and kept my comments to myself this time.

Tallor’s skin glistened with sweat like a roasting pig as he continued on.

“I finally told her I needed to meet. To really *see* her. She told me she was ready. The address she gave me… It was that old cemetery , just outside of St. Clare in Forest City. The abandoned crematorium… I went anyway. I know no one lives there.”

An intense look suddenly crossed Tallor’s face, like something inside of him hardened. He narrowed his eyes and held my gaze in a way that put me on edge. In a moment it was like a switch flipped and he turned the tables on the room’s energy.  

“Detective, can you seriously say you’ve never wanted something  you weren’t supposed to have?  And you wanted it to be true so badly that you were gonna get it no matter how the reality of the situation looked?”

I tried to stay firm in my response, but I felt sweat suddenly forming on my brow. “I’m the one interrogating you, Edwin. Finish your fucking story.”

Tallor nodded. “I drove there on a Saturday. It was hazy, overcast. The air was dry and freezing. I saw my breath when I got out of the car. That old cemetery, it’s still got a fully accessible parking lot. It’s overgrown and the cement’s all cracked, but you can get in. You can enter into this other world. Forgotten death. I saw the crematorium looming behind the overgrown bushes and trees on the untended grounds, as I walked up the winding dirt path from the parking lot. 

“The path cut through the graveyard itself, and plenty of dirt caked and weather-beaten gravestones jutted up from the sea of vines and wild grass. There wasn’t a single sound in the air, detective. The birds and the animals and all, they abandoned that place too. ‘Why couldn’t it have been some other girl?’ You’re thinking that, right? Why did it have to be her? Because it did. 

“Emptiness should’ve surrounded me on all sides, but it felt like something was there. Again, just this hypnotizing and ominous pull. The place had been left behind by all of us, and turned into something it shouldn’t have. Halfway between the parking lot and the crematorium, I saw her.”

I was practically on the edge of my seat now, sweat ice cold and squinting with disbelief. Waiting with bated breath to hear what Tallor would say next.  

“She sort of… crawled out from the grass. The side of the path, the actual gravesites. On all fours, she wriggled into the dirt. Her strange limbs and awkward proportions looked more pronounced in person. She didn’t look nearly as…. As human. As normal. All she wore was a ragged brown dress, looking almost like a potato sack. No shoes, no jewelry. Slowly, she rose to her feet and turned to face me. Wild, greasy hair hung over her face, but I could still make out those yellow tinged eyes.

“You probably think I was terrified, detective. But in that moment, honestly… I still wanted her.

“I asked if it was her… if *she* was Serlana. She didn’t say anything at first. Just stared at me and smiled really wide. Wider than a person can. ‘Don’t you wanna meet mother?’ Her voice was… not what I expect. Gravelly and distant. I took a step toward her, trying to close the gap. I couldn’t help myself, I just… I reached out and grabbed her.”

Tallor’s eyes took on a manic quality as the story continued.

“The second I did that, she opened her mouth in a giant O and let out this agonizing, ear splitting scream. Thinking about it even now, it makes my head hurt. It wasn’t a noise that a human being could make, detective. I kept hold of her arm, but I stumbled. And then I felt it. This great rumbling in the earth, like… like some giant creature moving. 

“I looked up and saw it. Well, sort of. From further up the path. Some giant dark shape was beelining for us. It shuddered and shook and it was almost like I couldn’t focus on it even as I stared right at it. But it was massive. And it was coming straight for me. There was this smell, this… damp, earthy and organic stink. Right in the back of my throat so I could taste it. I should’ve just taken off, I should’ve run away… but… I wanted her. I wanted Serlana.

“It’s like I said before, detective. About wanting something so bad that you’d do anything…. Nothing in that moment made any sense except the feelings I’ve always carried with me. I thought I loved her…

“I thought fast. I yanked Serlana by the arm and dragged her with me as I ran. I couldn’t hear but I *felt* the thing gaining. Mother. There was a rusted and bent gap in the iron bars that lined the cemetery along the dirt path. I dove through, and somehow we fit. I think it threw the thing off. We kept moving, into the tall grass and trying not to trip over headstones. Serlana scratched and clawed at me, but she wasn’t strong enough. I glanced back again to see the frantic shape bounding over the iron bars. 

“I had an idea. I suddenly stopped in my tracks and grabbed Serlana’s neck with my free hand. I strangled her, hard as I could. I squeezed her neck with all my might. Her cry was cut short, turned to a whimper. And it stopped. I turned to see that her… Mother had stopped again in its tracks. It was still some black and shimmering blur, but it wasn’t racing toward me anymore. 

“I’m not stupid, detective. I understood. I looked into Serlana’s eyes. A twisted and hateful expression had crossed her face as strangled cries scraped her throat. I knew I could love her. I kept my hand around her neck, and bashed her head into one of the tombstones. Two, three times. Til her eyes closed and her jaw went slack. Til it was safe to let go of her throat. I didn’t want to kill her….

“I didn’t look back at her mother again. I was terrified that one wrong move would be the end. Cutting off that sound seemed to work. It was like… I’m not sure if that’s the way they communicated? Or if Serlana was the one giving her mother the orders… she had certainly been telling the truth about her mother being a difficult person to live with. I took the long way out of the cemetery and wrapped Serlana up with some duct tape I had in the trunk. We went home. 

“I know you’re judging me. But… She was mine. She’d called me there. Even encountering her mother, even all the wrongness and weirdness… she was mine! I needed her. I’d never meet another girl like her. When I got her back to the apartment, I kept her on a steady diet of Xanax and other sedatives. I didn’t want to risk what would happen if she woke up… but I loved her so much. Our time together, it really was paradise. Then you guys kicked in my door… even having Serlana wasn’t enough, I guess. I wanted more. Fell for your little trick.

“I have no idea what they are, detective. I’ve told you everything I can. She’s probably awake by now, and everyone at that hospital is probably dead.”

Tallor went silent, and stared at me expectantly. 

I had let him rant uninterrupted for all that time and sat in stunned and silent disbelief now that the story had come to an end. What the fuck was I supposed to say?

Almost as if on cue , the sound of my cellphone’s ringtone suddenly cut into the room, disturbing the silence. I instantly knew before I picked up the call that something wasn’t right. It just couldn’t be.

I clicked answer. I was immediately met with the sounds of screaming, and pure chaos. The call had come from my partner, Nielsen. He’d taken the girl over to the hospital. He’d been waiting for her to wake up. 

But on the other end, I didn’t immediately hear him. I heard people screaming, sirens blaring. Anarchy and insanity. 

Then, Nielsen’s shaky and panicked voice. “Brannew…” he mumbled. “Alex…?” It was all I could muster. His first name. “It’s that girl, it’s…” Nielsen trailed off, sounding lost and terrified. “I don’t know what happened… She woke up, and then she started… screaming. Almost like her jaw unhinged and this awful noise spewed out. A whine that pierced our ears.” There was that same spacey and tinny quality to his voice. 

“Alex…” I interrupted, trying again. “What’s wrong? Are you okay? Are you hurt?”

“Her mother.” He answered. “It came here. There’s so… so  much blood, Tony. It’s like when your shower backs up and you stand in that inch of water ….”

“Alex!” I yelled, trying to gain control. I kept my eyes locked with Tallor, my expression twisting into anguished rage. “Alex, you gotta tell me what happened to you. And what… what did she… It… What did it look like? What *was* it?!”

“I don’t think I have a face anymore.” Nielsen’s sole response. I heard more screams, more panic and horror as the line went dead.

My entire body trembled as I placed the phone on the metal table. Tallor had a look of genuine sympathy, mixed with fear, plastered on his fat mug. “I tried to tell you…” he offered lamely. 

I shook my head but said nothing. Shock and disbelief overtaking me.

“Detective we… We don’t know when it’s coming here. Whatever it is, we… We could call the national guard. We could call *someone*. We can get away!”

I ran my hand over my face, frustration and fear building. Tallor had been telling the fucking truth. That was the only option. I just *knew* now that he was right. Those things *would* be coming here, whatever they were. Serlana and her mother. They hadn’t gotten what they wanted to begin with, and now we’d pissed them off even more. Maybe we still had the chance to get away.

I stood, walking over to Tallor as I readied the handcuff keys to set him free. A flash of hope crossed the egg man’s face.

I stopped. I stared at him, in all his foul and pasty repulsiveness. A disgusting pedophile who’d caused all of this. I thought about everything he’d said that day. Everything he’d done. The way his body had looked, hunched over the girl as we yanked him off. The reason we’d been onto him in the first place. All those photos, all those kids. Everyone he’d hurt, participated in the hurting of. 

The man who’d wanted a little girl so badly that he stole one from a monster.

I put the keys back in my pocket. 

Tallor’s face sunk. He knew, instantly. His mouth fell agape in terror, eyes opened wide. “No…” he murmured, repeating the word as it rose to a scream. “No detective please!” Tallor made to stand, the metal interrogation table shifting and scraping on the concrete floor as he did so. 

I said nothing, beelining for the door as fat fingers grazed the back of my shirt, iron willed and ignoring Tallor’s desperate pleas. The man had screwed with forces far beyond our comprehension. He’d cost god knew how many people their lives that day.

I heard it as I was slamming the interrogation room door shut, locking it behind me. A piercing wail in the distance. A sound like knitting needles being driven into my ear drums. I cupped my ears with my hands as the noise quickly became unbearable even from this distance.

I heard screams too, and the thumping clawing steps of gargantuan legs. A crash and splintering wood as the front door of the station was blasted through. The sounds intensified. My colleagues yelling in terror, sharp claws rending into flesh. And that damn siren’s cry, an organic alarm guiding these horrible things where they needed to go. 

Serlana rounded the corner first. She looked different than she had this morning when we’d pulled her from her captivity. Haggard sure, but more determined. Wide yellow eyes frantic and focused. She hobbled toward me on spindly legs, gesturing at me with her bony fingers as her mouth grew wider and wider. The source of the horrible noise, coming deep from the back of her throat. It looked like the corners of her mouth were upturned in a malicious smile. 

I felt a rumbling from behind her, as a twisted and lumbering shadow was cast from around the bend in the hallway. A smell wafted to my nostrils as the mother grew closer, filling the room. A scent like a predator, the cat house at the zoo. Animalistic and metallic. It smelled like the jungle. 

I held my hands up frantically to Serlana , screaming at her to stop, unsure if she’d be able to hear me over her own droning wail. Or even understand me if she could.

The grey girl tilted her head quizzically and closed her mouth. The encroaching shadow from beyond the wall came to a dead stop. 

Serlana stared at me with those yellow eyes, silently commanding me to speak. 

“In there.” I pointed to the door behind me. My ears were ringing, I could barely hear my own voice even as I spoke. I could faintly make out Tallor’s muffled cries , the sound of a fat and wet palm desperately slapping against the inside of the door.

Serlana looked at the door, then back to me. 

“The man. The one that… The one you’re looking for.”

Something crossed over the girl-thing’s face. A glint of understanding.

They weren’t human, sure. And who knew what their intentions had been in the first place. But at the core, I couldn’t get that image out of my head. A creature, hunched over and taking advantage of someone weaker. Serlana wasn’t the monster in that scene. 

I’d said all I could. My fate was in their hands now. Whatever the fuck these things were, whatever was waiting around that corner, I had no shot against it if they decided they wanted to rip my face off too. 

An eternity passed as I waited. 

“Close your eyes.” Serlana’s voice was ragged and chalky. Strangled, like the words didn’t come naturally at all. She didn’t sound like a little girl. 

A smile too wide for her face grew to split the skin as she continued. “Mother doesn’t like it when they see.”

With that, she opened her mouth into another giant O and that awful wailing started again. 

What choice did I have?

I closed my eyes. Covered my ears to drown the sound out best I could. 

I felt that rumbling again, heard giant footsteps slamming closer. A wave of nausea passed over me as that jungle stench got even closer. A hulking and threatening presence lingered near me for several moments.  Serlana’s mother deciding my fate. Part of me wanted to open my eyes. See what kind of hideous monstrosity this thing was. A morbid curiosity to see something that humans weren’t meant to. 

You know what they say about curiosity.  

I didn’t hear them tear the door off its hinges, didn’t hear Tallor’s desperate and pathetic cries of agony as whatever the *fuck* the mother was tore into the fleshy egg man and ripped him to shreds, stringing his organs up like Christmas lights. It was all drowned out by Serlana’s agonizing cry.

I wondered if they felt satisfaction? Revenge? Or were they just feeding some kind of hunger?

The way I looked at it, these things came from some place adjacent to ours , a place we’re not supposed to know about. They cast the lure and Tallor bit. But he was a little too smart, a little too much of a monster himself. Made theirs’ and all of our lives a little more terrible. 

It took a moment for me to realize that the rumbling and the screaming had stopped. My ears were ringing once again. The entire world moved in slow motion.

I didn’t look into Tallor’s room. 

I stumbled through the hallway and around the corner, vision blurred. The entire station had been ripped apart. 

I dropped to my knees and vomited as I exited the open wall of the station where the front doors used to be, and into the grey daylight of winter. Mass chaos and commotion played out all around me, people screamed and cried, sirens wailed, there was a coppery and blood drenched haze hanging in the atmosphere where Serlana and her mother walked their path of destruction. 

I took a deep, deep breath.

The air smelled like freedom.
