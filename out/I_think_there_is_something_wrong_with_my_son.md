Me (35F) and my husband (40M) have always wanted a child. But because of my fertility issues we started to think adopting as an option.

I have always wanted to have a family. I grew up in an abusive household with my 3 other siblings. My mother died in childbirth when i was 8. I ran away at 13, after my father set our house on fire. I don’t really remember anything else about my childhood. My therapist said it was some sign of a “trauma”

As I was driving home from work one night, I noticed a little boy standing on the side of the road. I stopped the car and asked him where his mother was. He said he didn’t know. I took him to the police station and they said they found no records of the boy or his family.

 After talking with a social worker, I adopted the boy. His name was Howard and he was 5 years old. I know, weird old name for a little boy. I was beyond excited to give a home to him, not knowing it would be the worst mistake of my life.

Howard was polite and kind. He never acted out or anything. It’s like he was a 60 year old grandfather in  a body of a 5-year old.

After a month of him living with us, my husband had a psychotic breakdown and left us. One night he just packed up his things and left. The whole time of him packing he just yelled at me “what the fuck are you talking about” over and over again. I got terrified and didn’t even try to call him ever again. I got the divorce papers in the mail next week.

So now it was just Howard and I. Great. Never seen myself as a single mother. At this point his politeness had started to creep me out. He was never uncomfortable. He never had a cold. He was okay with everything I asked him to do. I told him not to watch TV. He said okay and picked up his colouring book. I told him to go to bed. He never picked up a fight.

 Another weird thing was he never ate his food. I am busy and we don’t eat together. I just find the full plate at the table everyday. I never bother to ask him about it. And I don’t know if I want to.

The next day things got really weird. I was sitting on the couch with him, watching TV. The whole night he just sat there and stared at me. I saw him looking in the corner of my eye. Even when I turned my head to his direction he didn’t flinch nor say anything.

Over the course of the next month I noticed him staring at me sometimes. When I did laundry he was peeking in the crack of the door just staring at me.

I also had noticed a change in his look. Small changes. His hair got darker. He suddenly has freckles, like I do. He started to look more familiar every day but I didn’t know who he looked like.

Then he started saying things out of pocket. I was washing the dishes and he came up to me and said 

“Why did you leave me?”

I asked him what he was talking about. I never left you. 

He never answered or explained what it meant.

He asked that from me probably 5 times everyday. I really started to get scared and tried to find someone who could help him.

As I fell asleep on my couch, I woke up at 3 am. I felt like someone was staring at me. I looked around without moving and guess what there he was standing in the corner. Howard, with eyes wide open just staring at me. He noticed that I was awake and he walked up to me and yelled at me “WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME” 

I quickly got up, I was shaken up and in shock and scared. He just looked at me and went to his room. I didn’t sleep all night. Next morning I tried to talk to him about it but he didn’t answer, he just looked at me.

I tried to look for the police report they wrote about him, while they were asking the questions the night I found him. When I couldn’t find it I started searching every box I had. I came across an old picture book. I went through it. There were pictures of me and my parents and siblings. I was about to pass out when I noticed it. Oh fucking hell. There it was, a picture of 10 year old me, with a little boy standing next to me. My baby brother. He had the same brown hair and freckles. He looked exactly like Howard.

Just as I looked at the picture closely, I smelled gasoline. I look behind me and Howard was standing there with a match on his hand and a creepy smile on his face.

“Why did you leave me, sister?” Howard said as he dropped the match to the gasoline pool on the floor.
