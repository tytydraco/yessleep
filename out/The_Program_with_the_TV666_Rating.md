One day on June 6, 2006. I was watching TV Early in the morning on 3:33 AM, and as a show was finishing another program came on. For the first 10 or 15 Seconds, it was just nothing but blackness, I didn’t know what was going on, so i reached for the remote to turn it off, until the TV-Rating popped up on the Top-Right corner and it caught my eye. "TV-666" I was confused, I thought it was some prank or something, until text popped up that said;

 "The Following you’re about to see will cause extreme damage to your psychology, as it is leaked footage of Hell! You have been warned……. Turn off the TV Now!" And then at the bottom was a 5-Second countdown. And when I read that, I just laughed "Oh no!!! Footage from Hell!!! How scary!!!" And I reached for the remote to turn it off until I saw the Countdown finish and text popped up that said "Too Late, from this point onwards you will not be able to turn off your TV until it is finished." Then I pressed the power button and it didn’t work; "What the fuck!?" I said, confused, am I really not able to turn off my TV? And then…..it began……….It was indeed footage of hell, it showed nothing short of absolute depravity and horror as I saw people torturing each other, eating each other and raping each other in the most graphic and violent ways imaginable and unimaginable as they looked completely unrecognisable, they weren’t humans, but looked like different species, like the Post-Human species from the book, All Tomorrows as the footage also showed people falling into Hell as they were turned into unique post-Human Species and forced against each other. It was madness I couldn’t comprehend, and the sounds was that of screaming, and high pitched, deep fried sounds and frequencies, as well as a voice loudly explaining stuff like "The Unknowable" and What the Perfect Parasite that controls and consumes everything is, as well as giving the date when the apocalypse will happen. It was too much… it was madness, while I was edging closer and closer to going into an extreme seizure I tried pulling out the the TV plug but it still remained on, I started to scream in pain for the next footage as the footage faded to black, and text popped up that said "The End". 

That was the last thing I saw before I went into a seizure that lasted for several hours. When I woke up, I was in a hospital, and the doctors told me that I was found by a neighbour who knocked on my door to see if I was okay, when I was still in that seizure and called an ambulance, and for the rest of the month I wasn’t able to move my entire body properly, and from 2006 into 2007, I wasn’t able to move my legs. As a result of the seizure I suffered from major Brain damage and i got diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses, mostly due to the broadcast I saw, and I spoke to everyone about it, including my therapist and while they do listen, they don’t think it’s true. But I know, I saw it, and when the world ends, they’ll realise that I’m right.
