\*Journal was found in the basement of an abandoned school. Document has been permitted for public viewing after it was deemed ‘inconsequential.’

Entry #1. 9:31am

*I’m starting this journal because something is off at my school, and no one else is acknowledging it. Perhaps I’m going crazy, and if so, let this be a testament to the downfall of my mind. I suppose it is proper to begin with introductions. It is 12.18.41, Northern Michigan. My mother would tell me one shouldn’t tell the world the name of their school, and so I won’t. My name is Alexander, and I will not tell you my last name. I don’t know you, and I probably wouldn’t like you if I did. To whomever it may concern, if you are reading this journal, something terrible must have happened, God bless America, signing out.*

 Entry #2. 9:45am

*It may be no more than a figment of my mind, or such, but I can almost swear there is some sort of smell, almost burning my nostrils. It is almost sweet; it reminds me of something that had gone rancid much too long ago and had been left out to fester in the air for much too long. I am looking around to see if other faces reflect this, but I can’t seem to discern if they are working on a particularly hard math problem or if they can tell too.*

 Entry #3. 10:01am

*Curiously much like those in Britain, air raid sirens have just begun their sickly hum. It is not terribly loud, but my professor’s face seemed to drain of blood. In truth, I didn’t know we had sirens this far out and this rural. The more I think of it, the less it makes sense. As much I hope it to be a drill, I can’t imagine as to the circumstances that could have led to an air raid over two hours from the city.*

Entry #4. 10:30am

*The sirens have stopped. Our teacher covered the windows with blackout curtains and turned off the lights. He seemed vary solemn as she elucidated that this was in fact not a drill. Out of a box tucked away in an old corner closet, caked in dust, and the color of oak, he pulled out an old set of gas masks. He slammed the box onto a table devoid of students. And sat back down. To the class, he said sternly, “no one will talk. No one will walk. You will sit still and under no circumstances open the curtains. No matter what I say.”*

Entry #5. 10:45am

*I suppose since there is nothing else, I can do, I will describe the room I have found myself stuck in. I am surrounded by gray brick, the classroom as one door on the right side, and one to the left. The doors are a dark wood, with a long grain that seems to watercolor the wood with black and darker browns. The floor is wooden, boards laid in an interlocked pattern that seems almost random in its uniformity. It is in this room I am taught my sciences: chemistry, maths, biology, and the occasional presentation on our health, physical descriptions of the body, and your mind can fill in the rest. To the back of the room is a large counter that sits below the blacked-out window that stretches the same length. There are five tables, one I find myself at with 3 other people, and the rest have five each. Excluding of course, the one my teacher slammed the box on.  The tables appear as the same wood as the doors, dark, with the long-stretched grain. The teacher doesn’t have a table to sit at, for such he paces back and forth silently in front of the chalkboard dusted with white over the greenish black surface.*



*The longer I look at him, the more different that normal he seems. His face is getting paler and more strained by the minute. His eyes seem to dart around frantically, as if he is looking for a place to rest his eyes but can’t, and his hands fidget at his sides. He is tall, with short blackish-gray hair, almost the color of metal that has been left in the fireplace for a minute, and his brow is sturdy and argumentative. As I write this, I find looking at him is leaving me with a sick pit in my stomach, that sickly sweet smell I mentioned earlier is growing stronger in the air, so I suppose it may just be the smell. Perhaps something died under the floorboards and the janitor is yet to clean it. No one else seems to notice.*

Entry #6. 11:00am.

*At about 10:55 his eyes shot up and he froze. He remained like this for minutes before he seemed to relax and said we should open the window and let some light in. he walked over to the window, and swung open the curtains, to reveal the windows caked in some dust like substance from outside. No light was let it par from the spare rays that were able to fight through the dust and cast rays on the floor. Seemingly unphased by the dust caked windows, he pulled a chair from the empty table, and sat at the front of the classroom, staring at the ground in silence. Even now no one dares speak. The silence is unlike anything I’ve ever heard, which I suppose makes sense, but still, I find it unnatural. It’s the kind of silence that burrows into your ears and leaves them desperate for a pencil to drop, or a foot to clamp on the ground, to no avail. As I write this, its even as if the pencil I write with makes no scratch or draw against the rough paper.*

Entry #7 12:00pm

*The silence continued for about 45 minutes. At 11:47am, the silence was broken by a single drop of blood. The offender was our professor. As everyone staired at him, and the crimson stain on the floor, we watched in growing discomfort as his hand dug deep into the side of his cheek. His fingers were white with effort, and the veins in his arm seemed to bulge out. As he dug deeper and deeper a squelch seemed to pierce the silent classroom. It sounded like squeezes a saturated sponge, and the water hitting the sink basin in thick drops, or perhaps the sound of walking in soiled shoes. Slowly he wiggled his hand around, driving his fingers deeper into his now dripping blood flesh. The skin around seemed to slog down, holes slowly forming in places untouched by his hand. His skin discolored crimson and green and grays, decayed and rotten in appearance. As the plague spread to his eye lids and forehead, he suddenly stood up, his skin now no longer taught against his musculature.*



 *He announced to the classroom “will everyone please line up according and grab a gasmask, put it on as instructed by the slip in the mask, and sit back down. Under no circumstances should your gasmask be removed.” And he fell to the ground, suddenly writhing. His fingers seemed to break and deform under his skin, and his skin seemed to liquify over his body. The sweet smell grew stronger and stronger as his body seemed to rapidly decompose, exposing bone, and organ tissue. Eventually he stopped moving and laid still. His body was ravaged, but it could still be made out as his by his clothes that remained whole. As one could guess, the classroom erupted out of their seats, tearing gasmasks from the box, and many students ran directly to the doors. The doors are locked. Why are the doors locked?*

Entry #8 12:45pm

*The gasmask is hard to breath in. the air that the filters let through is dust caked and still smells oddly sweet. The goggles are tinted dark and hard to see out of. Many of my classmates have seemed to succumb to the same illness or whatever it was that brought our professor to his end. It begins with the pacing. The victim will begin to pace around the room and fidget without end. Eventually they will begin to mumble and mutter about keeping the windows closed, and that we just need to remain calm. But we all know that it won’t. one by one it is catching up to all of us.*



*After the restlessness, come the urge to open the window. They often will dart to it, saying we just need to let some light in. we all hold them back, as we don’t know what’s out there, and our teachers departing words still seem overly important. If we do one thing, I believe we shouldn’t open the windows. After they are forcibly sat back down, or removed from the window area, they will begin picking away at their skin. The picking eventually turns to digging and digging turns ripping away at their flesh. Eventually they all fall to the floor, and writhe until they slowly stop moving, and after a brave classmate, (who later soon succumbed himself) checked their pulse, we determined they were dead. The atmosphere in the classroom is thick with tension. Still, no one dares to speak, other that the afflicted. Of course, in the gasmasks makes it none the easier.*

Entry #9. 1:31pm

*I suspect this will be my final entry. I am the only one left, and I feel something wrong in my gut. The sense of restlessness, the need to move around and do something about my situation. Being that there can be nothing worse than my current situation, and that there is no one to stop me, I imagine I will open the window. I hope whatever I find is better than the deaths I have witnessed everyone else suffer. The last person to die hurt the worst. Holding my little brother back from the window; watching him dig and scrape away his sinew and flesh from his very bones hurt more than even death itself.*



*The worst was his screaming. Out of everyone else who died, he was the only one that screamed as he died. Unlike the others, he truly seemed in pain when he died. If I survive this, I don’t this I could bare to tell my parents of his death. I can only imagine my mother breaking down in front of me, or whatever is left of me. The urge to move is becoming unbearable. I have been thinking for a while what I want to record my final words as, but I know it would be a lie. In truth, I know my final words will most likely just be some form of rambling about the windows, or staying calm, and I suppose its better than it being something stupid. This is Alexander, signing out, God bless America.*
