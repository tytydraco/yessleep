On the morning of June 10, 1995, Detroit police responded to an emergency call placed by a security guard from a defunct warehouse. The caller reported multiple dead bodies and one survivor who would not speak.



When law enforcement arrived, they immediately noticed that extremely loud music was playing. The volume was so significant that they were able to hear it from the street inside their patrol car. The officers identified the song as “The Safety Dance” by Men Without Hats, and noted that it played on a continuous loop during the entirety of their time on the scene.



Upon entering the warehouse, officers quickly realized that the security guard had underplayed the severity of the situation. 



Within the warehouse were several dead bodies, each of them severely mutilated, at least three of which had been “disarticulated” per the incident report.



Based on the mutilation and the presence of what officers believed to be Satanic imagery in the victims’ clothing, style, and even tattoos, officers operated under the assumption that the murders were ritualistic and likely occult in nature. 



The officers located the only survivor, a visibly ill male approximately 18-22 years of age. The man kept his face covered with his hands. No matter what the officers said or did, the youth would not remove his hands from his face.



The survivor was otherwise responsive. He rose to his feet when instructed, complied with a search when prompted, and followed commands and instructions as directed.



When officers asked his name, however, all he did was laugh.



In fact, when asked any question whatsoever, he laughed without answering.



The sequence of events that followed this discovery remains murky at best. 



However, at some point the youth dipped into a bow. He then paused, as if waiting for a response.



None came. 



He bowed a second time.



Finally, one of the responding officers bent down, asking if the youth was feeling all right.



In response, the youth laughed yet again. Then he straightened up and slid forward, leading with his right foot.



He then again.



Roughly ten seconds later, he fatally attacked the officer.



Due to the sheer ferocity of the attack, the youth fled the scene.



The youth was taken into custody by AHH approximately two hours later. Agency personnel were already in the area due to inmate #10 and were therefore uniquely prepared to identify, track, and capture a second anomaly.



Upon being apprehended, however, the inmate immediately bowed to personnel.



The Agency now understand that this bow is the opening move in the entity’s attack, which staff have dubbed the Copycat Game.



At the time, however, staff had no way of knowing what was happening. Shortly after the inmate initiated his game, personnel nearly died. T-Class Agent Christophe W. managed to distract the entity until appropriate field restraints were devised and implemented onsite. Shortly thereafter, both the inmate and inmate #10 were taken into Agency custody.



Please note:



THIS INMATE MUST BE FULLY RESTRAINED AT ALL TIMES!



Even when restrained, the inmate constantly attempts to initiate his game. If initiation is successful, any personnel at the other end of the interaction are in critical danger.



This danger stems largely from the complexity of the inmate’s game. Rather than simple actions, the inmate presents complicated dance-like routines that are, bluntly, difficult or even impossible for participants to successfully mimic. Given that the consequence of unsuccessful mimicry is an exceedingly violent death, initiation of the Copycat Game must be avoided at all costs.



It is important to note that the inmate suffers critically obsessive behavior regarding initiation of the Copycat Game. Nothing stops these attempts. Even while restrained in perfect darkness with no ability to move and no visual or auditory stimulation whatsoever, the entity constantly attempts to perform his opening move. This presents substantial ongoing danger to any and all staff who come into contact with him. 



The entity presents as a young male between the ages of approximately 17-23. He is 5’5”, with a muscular build. His skin appears decayed, with discolored flesh that is patchy. He has no eyes. In place a nose he possesses a snout-like structure with an large open wound where a nose would normally be. 



Due to his uncorrectable obsessive behavior and the critical threat he poses to personnel, the Agency has long held the opinion that this inmate should be submitted for termination at the earliest opportunity.



On December 8, 2024, research staff assigned to AHH-NASCU developed a method of destruction. Specifically, this method renders the inmate “mortal” while reducing his inhuman strength to manageable levels.



Due to a shortage of appropriate training opportunities for field agents, Commander Rafael W. requested permission to use the inmate’s termination as a training exercise for newly commissioned staff.



The interview recorded below was conducted as part of the Agency’s attempt to determine what, if any, behavioral modification could be imposed — in other words, to see if the inmate is, for lack of a better term, salvageable.



After reviewing the interview and all other pertinent information, Administration determined that rehabilitation is not possible, and proceeded to approve the inmate’s destruction.



Permission was granted to utilize the inmate’s termination as a training exercise. The exercise was scheduled for December 10, 2024 with Commander Rafael W. And T-Class Agent Christophe W. assigned as trainers.



The interviewer notes her strong disagreement with the inmate’s sentence and believes that rehabilitation was not only possible, but probable. 



On the advice of Commander Rafael W., the interviewer played “The Safety Dance” directly prior to the interview to help elicit a response. Given that the song was playing during the inmate’s initial discovery, the commander reasoned that the song was perhaps meaningful to the inmate and might therefore facilitate an opening for conversation.



The inmate’s reaction was unexpected.





**Interview Subject: The Dancer** 

**Classification String: Uncooperative / Destructible / Gaian / Constant / Critical / Daemon** 

**Interviewers: Rachele B. & Christophe W.**

**Interview Date: 12/10/24**









*I hate that motherfucking song. I hate it. Turn it off! TURN IT OFF!*



Thank God. Thank *you.*

  


Okay, so, long story short: I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.



You know what got me there? Dance.



I just wanted to dance.



My whole life, that is the only I wanted to do. Laugh if you want. Tons of people did. Little Twink wants to be a ballerina. Whatever. I’ve heard it all, and all of it is wrong.



Dancing takes strength like you wouldn’t believe. Check out a dancer if you don’t believe me. Really, check them out and thank me later. But before you thank me, ask yourself if you really think you have what it takes to beat their ass. 



You know what, I’ll just tell you the answer: You don’t.



That was my childhood - dealing with a bunch of losers who couldn’t last a minute shuffling around in Dance Dance Revolution even if they wanted to trying to bully the shit out of me. I had to bully them back. I always won, which they never expected even after I kicked the asses of the ten friends that tried before them. I didn’t get it. I still don’t. The only thing I can come up with is they only ever saw what they expected to see. When they looked at me they saw a dance fanatic who was five foot five if he stood on his tiptoes, so what they expected was an easy target.



The problem is, I’m anything but easy and anything but a target.  



Anyway, I grew up, got the hell out of that small town, and escaped to the big city.



If I were more eloquent, I’d try to describe the sights and the sounds and the sheer exhilaration that comes when you finally have a life. 



I’d try to describe the friends, too. What it meant to have friends — more than friends, a community — after growing up as a target. All I can say is I finally found people who looked at me, saw me, and wanted me around. People who didn’t see me as a target.



So I found a group. I fell in hard and had the time of my life. Drinks, drugs, girls, boys night life, day life, even work, I loved all of it because it was my life. I finally had a life, and I loved it.



I loved dancing most.



I’m a dancer, even now. That’s the only part of me that’s still here: The dancing.



My first memory is waltzing across my mom’s bedroom. I was so small that my crib was still in the corner. What I’d give to wake up there, right in the middle of that memory, and have a second chance to do all this over.



Anyway, like I said, I found a good group. The best kind of group at the best time, where half of them are already there when you arrive and the other half come in after you. And we just went for it every free minute. Parties, raves, practices, rehearsals, choreography, bouncing ideas off each other, collaborating. Building our community by making art.



Like I said, I was having the time of my life. 



That’s what was I was doing the night it went to hell - having the time of my life.



My friends were all incredible people. Jodie was the most incredible. Talk about a soul connection. That girl was my one and only cosmic bond. More than a friend, more than a sister. A platonic soul mate. I miss her.



The only thing I don’t regret about that night is being able to help her.



So yeah, Jodie was incredible. But not all of Jodie’s friends were incredible. You know what I mean? And because she was so incredible, those people just orbited her. The closest to greatness they’d ever come, maybe? I don’t know.



Anyway, all those not-incredible people showed up on the regular. It was okay when they were just, like, participating. Hanging out or whatever. Fine. The problems came when they started hijacking our shit.



And they did that a lot.



That’s why that night turned into a wrong place, wrong time situation:



Because the not-incredible people crashed our party.



It was just a regular party. Basically a dance night, not quite a rave. Someone had rigged a speaker system inside an old warehouse and abused the speakers by playing all kinds of 80s shit.



It was fun, though. Just a regular dance night, all music and movement and expression. How it’s supposed to be. The kind of atmosphere artists of any stripe really get into.



The problem with most of the Not-Incredibles is none of them were actually artistic. Whenever they came to these events, they inevitably got bored.



That’s what happened: Two of Jodie’s Not-Incredibles got bored.



Honestly, I get it. If you don’t like to move, if you can’t let go and just express yourself, if you can’t get out from the weight of your own self consciousness, if you can’t lose yourself without losing awareness of the people around you — then dancing isn’t all that fun.



And I’m trying to be a dick, but trust me — those guys couldn’t do any of that.



And after a little while, they kind of split off from the group and vanished into the back.



I noticed. I didn’t want to notice. I didn’t bring them. I didn’t like them. They weren’t my responsibility.



But when you grow up being a target, your situational awareness rockets through the roof. And there was something about the way they were moving that made me uneasy.



So I watched them.



They kept coming back to the floor, only to vanish into the back again. Back and forth, back and forth. Then they started getting this ugly, shiny kind of smile that I’ve learned to distrust with every fiber of my being.



So the next time they crept away, I followed.



I found them in the very back, behind a wall of old machinery. They were laughing over this homeless dude passed out on the floor. He’d been there so long there was dust in his hair. His hands were covering his face, which was weird. But not the weirdest thing. He was skinny but huge, six feet, maybe even a little more. And he was dressed ridiculously. I mean, *ridiculous.* He was wearing this tattered old suit with a cummerbund and tailcoat and a top hat. Stains everywhere, frayed hems, even moth-eaten spots. He didn’t just look homeless. He looked stupid. I kind of understood why the not-incredibles were laughing so hard.



I went up to see what they were doing, as casually as I could. But they barely even noticed me. They were too busy fucking with the guy. Toeing him, stepping on his feet, his fingers, poking his hat.



Finally the guy sat up, still covering his face with his hands, and started to whine. He sounded like a sick dog.



Not-Incredible Number One squatted down, covered his face with his own hands, and pretended to cry.



“What the hell are you guys doing?” I asked.



They started laughing.



The guy on the floor whimpered and rolled onto his back. He kept his face covered, but kicked his feet in the air like an overturned turtle.



Not-Incredible Number Two copied him, laughing so hard he was gagging.



Then the guy sat up. The Not-Incredibles dragged him to his feet. He flopped around like a puppet, still covering his face.



By that point, I already had a terminal case of the creeps.



Before I could say anything, they hauled him off, heading straight for the dance floor.



No one was particularly pleased when they interrupted, but they were too excited to notice. “Look at this!” they kept saying. “Watch! This is awesome!”



Because there’s nothing else you can do when a bunch of losers hijack your party, everyone stopped and watched as the homeless guy kicked his feet into the air.



Not-Incredible Two did the same, laughing his ass off.



Then the homeless guy leaned forward in this big, exaggerated stretch. He still kept those hands plastered to his face.



Not Incredible Two copied him.



After that, Mr. Homeless turned around to face the rest of us right as the motherfucking Safety Dance started to play.



God, I hate that song. I hate it.



As I watched, he swept into this low, deep bow without uncovering his face.



“Come on!” said Not-Incredible Two. “He wants to play with all of us! Group game!”



As if on cue, Mr. Homeless extended one leg.



And unfortunately, everyone was just drunk enough and just mean enough to and just curious enough to play along, including me.



So we all copied him.



Then he extended the second leg.



We all followed suit.



People around me started laughing. I didn’t. Not because I was a prude or anything, but because this whole thing was grossing me out.  I grew up in an area with a lot of homeless people. I knew some of them by name. This was just…gross.



It was fucking gross.



Mr. Homeless pulled another move, a ridiculous sort of slide. The kind that would normally require jazz hands, except of course he couldn’t use his hands because they were still clamped to his face.



Not-Incredible Two copied the move along with all the rest of us, but Not-Incredible One lost it and fell down laughing.



Instantly, Mr. Homeless’s hands dropped from face, revealing something awful, like a decaying snout, empty eyes, like something dying.



And he jumped at Not Incredible one like a bear and tore his face off.



I’m used to being a target.



The corollary to being a target is instantly intuiting how to become less of one. Sometimes you accomplish that by fighting. Occasionally you do it by running.



Sometimes, you do it by playing along.



So, while other people were screaming and running for the doors, I stood my ground and watched.



I wasn’t the only one. About twelve of us stayed put, including Jodie. I don’t like making assumptions, but after checking everyone who stood their ground, I’d bet a lot of money that they were all used to being targets, too.



The homeless guy covered his face again and shuffled back to the front of the room. When he bent forward, I copied him. So did Jodie. So did the others who stayed put.



Nobody who broke and run even saw the move, let alone copied it. 



Mr. Homeless went after each and every one of them.



And goddamn if it didn’t look like he was having fun.



He lumbered towards some of them like Frankenstein, arms out, shuffling forward. He pounced on others like a jaguar, and launched himself through the air like he was Batman.



It was terrifying. But it was *so* terrifying and *so* violent it almost didn’t feel real.



It was insane. He tore off a bunch of heads. He popped some arms off like a mean kid pulling wings off a fly. One girl, he bent her backward til she snapped in half like a graham cracker. 



Your brain comes up with weird, weird shit when you’re in crisis, and that’s what mine came up with when I watched him snap her: *A human graham cracker*. A full on s’more, if you want to count the stuff that came out of her when she broke. 



Once he finished off all the runners, Mr. Homeless shuffled back to the DJ table and pulled another move.



The thirteen of us who’d kept our heads — figuratively at first, now literally — copied the move.



And the next one.



And the next one.



And the next one and the next one and the next one, even after the stench of blood and open guts started rising around us like a cloud. Even after the blood puddles leaked across the floor and soaked our shoes.



The blood puddles actually took out the next one. He was copying just fine — better than me, if we’re being honest — but he slipped on the blood. Slipped and fell into a kind of half-split.



Mr. Homeless froze, hands still plastered to his face.



And then he jumped. Jumped and crunched that poor kid’s chest in like a hollow chocolate bunny. Some of him — blood, guts, bone shards for all I know — splattered all over my face.



Mr. Homeless straightened up, stomped a couple more times for good measure — to repeat the metaphor, very much like a kid double-tapping a roach he just squashed — and marched back to the table, where he dropped to a squat and raised his elbows.



We followed suit.



The longer it went, the harder it got.



I won’t say he was trying to make us do anything complex, necessarily, but when your brain’s already fried and the adrenaline is making you want to puke and you’re covered in sweat and your feet keep coming really close to slipping on your friend’s blood or some high school kid’s tongue, a lot of simple things start feeling pretty complex.



To this day, I don’t know what was worse: The way he covered his face when we were all playing correctly, or the horror underneath when he came for someone who literally stepped out of line.



We all made it past the complicated one-off moves. I guess he figured those were too easy because he started pulling routines. Like, short multi-step dance routines. He was choreographing for us.



That’s when I started thinking I might actually make it out of this alive.



Routines are just dances. And I can dance. I don’t even have to think. I just can.



The next person to be eliminated didn’t even misstep. She just melted down. Had a screaming panic attack. The choreographer killed her so quickly I think she kept screaming for a second or two after she was dead.



After that, the routines got weirder and a lot harder. At one point, we lost four people in as many turns.



The gleeful destruction of their bodies made me throw up. But at least I threw up in between turns.



My vomit nuked the guy next to me. He slipped and fell on my bile. He didn’t even have time to look at me before that thing leapt down on him and smashed his head like a pumpkin. My God.



Then there were six of us left.



Then five.



The next person died because she tried to attack him. I don’t know what she was thinking. Maybe — and the only reason I’m saying this is because it occurred to me — maybe she thought we were trapped in a bubble of magic or something, and if she jumped and hit him just right it would exert the same force he did whenever he hit one of us. Feet smashing ribcages, hands punching heads and guts into pulp. I was starting to think maybe that had been the answer all along: 



Not play along, but fight.



She launched herself at him, even caught him around the waist, and was dead before he even stumbled.



What he did to her was awful. It rained pieces of her for ten seconds at least. One of her teeth got stuck in my hair.



Her attempt must have pissed him off, because the copycat routine after that came after that was hard. Practically a full dance in and of itself.



Two people lost that round.



He killed the first one quick, but not quickly enough to keep the second one from crying. Maybe the crying upset him. Maybe he was just disappointed that the other one died so fast. Either way, he made sure that the second one died slowly.



And then it was just me and Jodie.



I was exhausted, and so was she. I saw everything I felt mirrored in her: Sweat-soaked clothing, tense muscles, tears and gore smeared on our clothes, our faces, drying in our hair.



But she was even worse off than I was. Way worse, because she was shaking.



And I knew that if that fucker pulled another complicated copycat routine, that she would lose.



So while he slowly and gleefully dismembered the last loser, I grabbed Jodie’s hand and ran.



It was almost dawn. I saw through the windows. The sky was that shimmering pale gold — not light, exactly, but borderline illumination — you only ever get on perfect summer mornings. That gave me hope. God damn me, that perfect golden light made me think we were home free.



As that fucking song settled into yet another loop, the choreographer burst into another routine. I was right. It was long. It was complicated. 



And because I was running, I’d already lost.



But it was such a long copycat routine that he was still going…and Jodie and I had already made it halfway across the warehouse.



We reached the door, and I looked back just in time to see the choreographer come bounding across the floor.



I shoved Jodie outside. She collapsed on the sidewalk with a sob, cracking her knee. Even after everything, the sound her knee made when it collided with the concrete made me shudder. Thinking about it still makes me shudder.



Dawn broke, spilling sunlight across the street like shimmering syrup.



The choreographer pulled me back into the warehouse. The door swung shut as Jodie screamed.



I braced myself to be crunched like a hollow chocolate rabbit or smashed like a bug or cracked open like a pumpkin or turned into a rain of gore.



None of that happened.

The choreographer grabbed my hands and pulled me close, touching that rotting snout to my nose.



Then he shrank.



The snout receded. His eyes swelled into being inside those desiccated sockets. His skin grew back — not healthy, but at least it looked alive instead of like a papery mummy — and I wasn’t looking at a monster anymore. Just a tired dude who could have been anybody or nobody.



With genuine horror, I realized that this guy had, in fact, been nobody.



Just some unlucky fucker out for fun on a Friday night who ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time.



Just like me.



He turned and ran.



I tried to follow. When I made it outside, Jodie screamed and squirmed away. No one’s ever looked at me the way she did. With horror, with hate.



I caught my reflection in the window. But it wasn’t my reflection. It was the choreographer’s.



I thought surviving til dawn meant I won. 



That’s not how it works, though. Surviving til dawn just means you trade places with the winner. That’s why I always make my games unwinnable. It’s better to be dead than to become this.



My life’s been over ever since.



It’s been over longer than I even got to live.



Talking to you is nice. It’s so nice to talk again. Really it is, even about this. But as soon as we’re done talking, I’m going to go right back to being that.



To pulling moves and planning how to kill you when you can’t pull one back.



To feeling the joy that comes from making you play along until I get tired of you and trick you into losing. It’s like a drug. An addiction. Only worse, because it’s just me. 



It’s me.



It wasn’t supposed to be this way. I just wanted to go to a party. I just wanted to have fun.



I just wanted a life.



Instead I ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time.



\* \* \*



I don’t even know where to begin with this.



I learned that the Agency has been trying to kill this boy for a long time, but they couldn’t figure out how. And messing up those attempts led to a lot of maimed and dead personnel, so they pulled back.



But they finally figured out a way to neutralize him on December 8, and went all in on the death sentence.



They had me interview him on December 10, but didn’t tell me why until after it was done. I couldn’t believe it when they told me. After that interview, how could they possibly think about killing him?



I said as much. They said they would take it under advisement. I really thought the evaluation would take more than a few hours.



So when Christophe came to escort me downstairs maybe four hours after that interview, I didn’t think much of it. He was in —not exactly a good mood — but something approximating it.



“Had a good day?” I asked.



He shrugged. “I got to help number 19 today. I told you, helping is my favorite part of my work.”



“It’s really important to you to have all the pretty girls think you’re awesome, huh?”



“Yes. But not as important as having the unpretty one think so.”



It took a second for that to sink in. “Really?”



“Why are you offended?” The imitation of my voice was so top tier I couldn’t even be mad. “You should be flattered.”



“You know what? I think I am.”



As we descended, music started thumping through the floors. By the time we descended two flights of stairs, the walls themselves were shuddering.



Christophe held open the door and ushered me into the room beyond, although it was less of a room and more of an arena.



The music was so loud it practically blasted me off my feet. It was so loud I couldn’t even recognize it. Field staff were swarming everywhere. I recognized the commander, Gabriella, and a few other staff I knew by face but not name.



“What is this?” I asked.



“Training arena. Go up,” said Christophe quietly. “Before they see you looking.”



I followed him to a row of seats. Love was in one, Mikey in another. He was pale and shaking, coated in sweat. 



Love smiled when they saw me, but tears had soaked through the blindfold they always wore. “They told me I had to participate,” they yelled over the music. “But Gabriella stopped them. Isn’t that good of her?”



I looked down into the arena and saw the Dancer huddled in the middle, quivering, face covered.



At that moment, I finally placed the music:



The Mortal Kombat theme song.



I finally realized what was happening.



Just as I started to panic, Charlie marched in and shut off the music. “What the hell is going on in here?”



Relief flooded me. Charlie was good. Charlie would stop this. Charlie was like me. Charlie liked me. He cared about the inmates. He’s the reason there’s a psych program at all. He’s the only reason things have gotten better.



One of the agents I didn’t know grinned widely. “What does it look like? Come play with us, Charlie.”



I was so sure that Charlie would yell at him.



Instead he smiled, shrugged out of his jacket, and bounded down into the fray.



“What the hell?” I whispered. “What is he doing?



“He was a commander too. The youngest one ever,” Mikey said. “Til he fucked up.”



“But he— he isn’t like them. He’s why—he helps—”



“He’s one of them. Have you forgotten who they are?” Mikey asked. “Or who *you* are? Because trust me, they haven’t.”



I rounded on Christophe. “Why did you bring me here?”



“Because they told me to. I am supposed to explain to you what they are doing to him, why they do it, what ways were right and which were wrong, and then I am to go down and correct their mistakes. But I am doing none of those things today.”



No sooner had the words left his mouth then the agents down below got started.



It was horrific. Like playing soccer with a human instead of a ball.



It was violent. Extremely so. But extreme violence is bizarrely mundane in the flesh. It goes quickly, it looks somehow nondescript, even fake. If you’re not looking closely, you can actually miss it.



Until the blood starts spilling, anyway.



It took ten seconds for blood to spill, and another thirty before the inmate screamed.



That’s when Christophe shot up and bounded down into the arena.



The other staff backed off, sending up a chorus of approving howls and cheers. Like he was the star player in a ballgame.



They fell away as Christophe approached the Dancer. I was confused; while I couldn’t see his face, nothing in his body language indicated that he was about to kill anyone.



The Dancer looked up at him and nodded.



Christophe nodded back.



For half a second, I felt hope.



Then he lunged and broke his neck.



As the Dancer crumpled to the floor, everything and everyone fell silent.



Then—



“What the hell?”



A new chorus rose, but no cheers — only disappointment, confusion, and anger. 



The commander stalked forward. “Did you misunderstand the purpose here tonight?”



“No.”



“Are you sure? Do you realize you just interfered with a training experience?



"What did I tell you, Raffa?” It was the field agent who invited Charlie to *come play.* “Either someone’s teaching your old dog new tricks, or he’s so old he’s just forgetting.”



“I am not forgetting anything. I am remembering where I am, and what I am dealing with.”



Silence again, but worse.



“I told you,” Mikey breathed. “He’s the only one who cares what happens to us. No matter how many times they try to beat it out of him, he is the *only one*.”



“All right,” Christophe said briskly. “The target has been terminated. Training is over. Good night.”



He spun around and stalked away, beckoning us to follow. Love got up first, tears streaming from under their blindfold. Then Mikey. Then me.



“No!” The commander’s voice shattered the silence. “Stay! All of you!”



I started to obey, but Christophe whirled around. His face was so contorted he didn’t even look like a man.



Then he shoves me forward and shepherded us out.



As soon as the door shut, Mikey said, “They’re going to send you back downstairs.”



Christophe shrugged. For the first time since I met him, he looked exhausted. “They will do what they will do when they like.”



“Then what’ll happen to us?”



“You will be fine.”



“Me? Yeah, probably.” He jabbed a thumb back at me and Love. “What about them?”



Christophe didn’t answer. 



He walked us all to our respective rooms without a word.



I was last. As he started to leave, I told him, “Thank you.”



He didn’t answer, but I heard him settle in at the front of the hall.



That was two days ago. 



I was only let out of my room this afternoon. No one’s explained why. I don’t expect them to.



There’s not much more to say.



I haven’t seen the commander since. I’ve seen Charlie but he’s being curt, which is so uncharacteristic as to be frightening. Christophe, Mikey, and Love are all still here, which was a relief.



Most of the field staff have departed, although Gabriella stayed behind. Most significantly, all the T-Class personnel are still in their cells. I’ve been told there’s no estimate on when they’re going back into the field.  



The only reason I’m not panicking is I have a full interview schedule for the next two weeks. 



After that, I don’t know.
