*Transmission Received*

Hey, David here again. I'm back from my spacewalk, and I think some of you may have seen my replies. Especially that DSEG Employee. Fuck you.

I saw something I thought might be of significance. The ship's thrusters have been hijacked. I thought it was a bumpy liftoff, but it was them clamping remote controls onto the fucking thrusters!

I don't even think I can take them off either. They're stuck, and I can't get enough force on the thrusters in space, because if I slip, I'm dead! This cord is not strong enough to keep me tethered!

I'm still slowly approaching the black hole, and I think I'll just.. give up.

There's no avoiding my fate, I'll be killed by this thing, and if I'm not, Lord help me. I've prayed constantly, and the Lord has done nothing.

I'm not usually religious, but I need His help. I don't want to die. I just wanted enough money to bail out my false sentence. I didn't kill Jacob, whoever's hearing this. He was my best friend, why would I kill him?

Am I going to die? Because that bastard framed me? Because of the corrupt judge that took the bribe?

I'll be damned if I let myself die scared. I was able to smuggle some whiskey onboard, Jack Daniels to be specific. I.. should I drink it? Should I be drunk my last hours? I don't know.

I might go for another spacewalk, but I don't want to go back out there. I'm so close to the black hole now that I can feel the pull in my organs.

I think I'm nearing its event horizon. I can't escape. Radio signals may not function properly. I'm sorry, but it's unlikely I'll be able to supply an update after this.

To the person asking me to tell what's on the other side, I don't think there is one. Maybe it's a void. but as I get closer, I can't help but see faint moving objects. Almost like clouds..

Maybe they are clouds. Maybe it's a gateway to another world. That would be better.

That's what I'm telling myself, at least.

My family used to have this song that we'd sing if we were scared.

How did it go..?

I can't remember.

I can't remember anything.

I.. think the black hole's gravity is getting to me.

I need to think. Think, goddamnit.

I keep getting alerts. My first message got through. You all have been so helpful. I want to thank you, and I just wanted to say, I appreciate you all.

I need to get myself together. I can't panic now.

This shit's getting to my head.

The black hole is so.. enticing. I see shapes in it, more than clouds. I see outstretched arms, ready to embrace me. I think I want to go in.

I'm going to do it.. I need to do it.

**Ship Console Opened. Manual Override Active.**

**Main Thrusters Engaged**

I'm going in.

Into the depths of this godforsaken void.

Goodbye.
