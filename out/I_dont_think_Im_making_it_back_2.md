Hey, David here again. I'm back from my spacewalk, and I think some of you may have seen my replies. Especially that DSEG Employee. Fuck you.

I saw something I thought might be of significance. The ship's thrusters have been hijacked. I thought it was a bumpy liftoff, but it was them clamping remote controls onto the fucking thrusters!

I don't even think I can take them off either. They're stuck, and I can't get enough force on the thrusters in space, because if I slip, I'm dead! This cord is not strong enough to keep me tethered!

I'm still slowly approaching the black hole, and I think I'll just.. give up.

There's no avoiding my fate, I'll be killed by this thing, and if I'm not, Lord help me. I've prayed constantly, and the Lord has done nothing.

I'm not usually religious, but I need His help. I don't want to die. I just wanted enough money to bail out my false sentence. I didn't kill Jacob, whoever's hearing this. He was my best friend, why would I kill him?

Am I going to die? Because that bastard framed me? Because of the corrupt judge that took the bribe?

I'll be damned if I let myself die scared. I was able to smuggle some whiskey onboard, Jack Daniels to be specific. I.. should I drink it? Should I be drunk my last hours? I don't know.

I might go for another spacewalk, but I don't want to go back out there. I'm so close to the black hole now that I can feel the pull in my organs.

I think I'm nearing its event horizon. I can't escape. Radio signals may not function properly. I'm sorry, but it's unlikely I'll be able to supply an update after this.

To the person asking me to tell what's on the other side, I don't think there is one. Maybe it's a void. but as I get closer, I can't help but see faint moving objects. Almost like clouds..

Maybe they are clouds. Maybe it's a gateway to another world. That would be better.

That's what I'm telling myself, at least.

My family used to have this song that we'd sing if we were scared.

How did it go..?

I can't remember.

I can't remember anything.

I.. think the black hole's gravity is getting to me.

I need to think. Think, goddamnit.

I keep getting alerts. My first message got through. You all have been so helpful. I want to thank you all, and I just wanted to say, I appreciate you all.

I need to get myself together. I can't panic now.

This shit's getting to my head.

The black hole is so.. enticing. I see shapes in it, more than clouds. I see outstretched arms, ready to embrace me. I think I want to go in.

I'm going to do it.. I need to do it.

**Ship Console Opened. Manual Override Active.**

**Main Thrusters Engaged**

I'm going in.

Into the depths of the void.

Goodbye.

I figured out how to chain transmissions together.

This black hole is beautiful. Twisting purple, deep blacks, and blinding whites all blend together in a perfect harmony.

I'm going mad, but that won't stop me.

I've been at full thrust for a day now, hence the delay in transmissions. I think I'll make it. This experience is euphoric. I see a light at the end of the tunnel, and I think I'll be able to get back out. I'm hearing voices. Hundreds of voices. All at once. It's deafening.

I think I can see stars. Inside the black hole. It's beautiful. Beyond anything I've ever seen before. It's like a small galaxy is inside this thing. I.. don't want to leave.

Life support is still failing, and I'll die soon anyways. 

Besides, who cares whether or not I die?

I was shunned by my own species. I was sent off to die.

These people clearly don't care about me.

But.. if I die, nobody will know the atrocities that people will commit to get revenge.

The ship is starting to shut down. I can't stay here for long. I think I only have enough air for a few more days. I don't know what to do. I need your help, whoever's listening to me.

I'm lost, confused, and I don't know what's happening anymore. I don't know what's real and what's not. I don't know who to trust.

I thought I was going to die in that black hole, but now I don't even know if that was real. Was it just a hallucination? Or did I really go in there and come out the other side?

I'm trying to piece together what happened, but my thoughts are jumbled and my memories are hazy.

I remember seeing something in there. Something that shouldn't exist. It was like a creature made of pure energy, and it spoke to me.

It told me things. Secrets about the universe that I never could have imagined. It showed me the true nature of reality, and it was both beautiful and terrifying.

I wish I could remember more, but it's all slipping away. I feel like I'm losing my grip on reality.

I need help. I need someone to talk to. Someone who can make sense of all of this.

But who can I trust? Who won't just think I'm crazy?

Maybe I am crazy. Maybe I'm just imagining all of this. But if I am, then why does it feel so real?

I'm running out of time. My oxygen levels are dangerously low, and the ship is failing. I don't know if anyone will ever find me.

But if they do, I hope they can make sense of what I've experienced. I hope they can learn from it.

Because there's so much out there that we don't understand. So much that we're afraid of. But maybe, just maybe, if we're brave enough to explore it, we can discover something truly amazing.

Something that could change the world.

I'm fading now. I can feel myself slipping away.

But before I go, I want to say thank you. Thank you to whoever's listening. Thank you for being there for me, even if you're just a voice on the other end of a transmission.

Thank you for giving me hope.
