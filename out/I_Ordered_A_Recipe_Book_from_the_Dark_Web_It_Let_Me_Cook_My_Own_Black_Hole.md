Hello, I'm Nathan. I live alone on the outskirts of a sin city nearby ; the very city that once had a lot of inhabitants but now reports of people missing every day. And not just that ; people's pets were the first ones to vanish, one after the other. It took just a year for the city as a whole to lose its pet and stray dog populations.

And I'm the reason for it all. I don't know where I'm headed next, but I certainly am, and I never wished to do this ; and still don’t. I just obey, and I have no other option but to constantly obey. Although I had a dog, I have no human companion as such. I was too fond of YouTube and had this dream to have a five-figure channel. I was a happy-go-lucky kind of person, always looking for new ideas, new things to try and share with people. But what I'm about to tell you is going to change your view of the dark web forever. Before I begin, I request you never to search for this recipe book and even stop browsing the dark web altogether.

I was a YouTuber, but I no longer am. I used to review odd stuff from the dark web; my audience was in thousands, not more. One fine day, I was browsing through the dark web for products when I came across a link that blinked in colors. The caption read: “Cook your own black hole ; order today!!”

It was too comical yet attractive to resist. Stuff like that would make my viewers laugh and would be unique for me to review. So, I clicked the link without any hesitation and bought it.

It took three weeks to arrive.

Now, I want to let you all know that I never unbox anything live on my channel, nor do I make a video of the unboxing process until I’m sure that the thing I’ve ordered is actually what it is and not something else.

So first, I unboxed the book. It was just a thin book with a small package attached to it. However, it was strangely lit, as if it were emitting light of its own ; as if it could make and emit light. In that package was a shiny powdered substance; it was too shiny, as if emitting its own light, and the book had instructions to cook.

I couldn’t control my laughter at first; however, I had to prepare it no matter what. I ordered two of those books anyway ; the first to prepare it without recording and the second for my viewers. It’s always wiser to order two, just in case you get a damaged package.

The instructions to prepare were simple:

Open the package, boil some water, and empty the powder into it. A gelatinous substance will be formed in half an hour. Let it cool and immediately apply it to both of your eyes.

I was playful ; too playful to resist all that, and eventually, I performed it accordingly.

The moment of truth was near. I applied the substance to my eyes, and complete silence followed. It was like light was being sucked out of my eyelids, and there was no sound ; just a deafening hum, followed by a strange vibration running throughout my body. And it still does.

No matter what I did, I couldn’t open my eyes for many hours ; I couldn’t keep count. My dog’s constant bark guided me to my bedroom where, because of the shock and tiredness, I fell asleep without realizing it.

When exactly I woke back up isn’t known to me, but when I did, everything felt normal at first, although there still was a strange hum and vibration around me. I opened my eyes, and right upon opening them, I saw two perfectly circular black orbs emerging out of them and merging. A wave emerged that stretched me and the surroundings for quite some centimeters, and then the most horrific thing happened. My dog was sucked inside it. It was immediately gone, and the light around me bent. I could barely see anything anymore,  it was too dim, too dark to see. Just an eerie hum and lasting vibration, as if someone was messing with the sun’s brightness, as if someone was regulating it.

I was startled and so scared that I couldn’t think of doing anything but die. I could see the orb having turned into a black hole, too eerie to look at. It was so dark that it felt like it was spewing out darkness. My heartbeat skyrocketed, and I felt too alone and numb. But I had to look for an answer; perhaps I had left something unread in that booklet.

I somehow managed to get out of my room. It was so dark, and it still is, like light was being constantly sucked upon approaching me from all sides. The booklet was strangely lit, just like the powdered substance that came with it. It always was like that, from the moment it arrived.

Since I took it for a mere joke, I hadn’t read the instructions in full. But upon opening the “Dos and Don’ts” section, my breath caught. It was as follows:

Dos:

Feed it every day.
Always obey it; it will anyway make you obey because it’s linked to you.

Don’ts:

Don’t ever stare at it.

The eerie hum, the haunting and bone-chilling vibration, along with the news, sent multiple chills up my spine and throughout my entire body thereafter.

On the next page, it was specifically mentioned that the black hole is attached to you, and thus it can’t and won’t consume you since it’s in sync with your very being.

And there I had my answer, the only way to kill it would be to end myself. But that wasn’t something I wished to do. Something was making me give up that decision, and it still does. Perhaps it’s the black hole itself latched to my thoughts, guiding me.

It’s been two years already, and the black hole keeps consuming. I’m feeding it too. It’s really slow but has consumed a lot of things. I can’t tell you which city or country I live in, and anyway, I’m frequently changing my location these days.

I once tried staring into it; it looked as if it was growing bigger and I was getting inside it,  as if it was sucking me in. Since then, I have never looked at it.

The extra package that I ordered is my only source of light now. It’s the only thing, alongside the remnants of the first one, that sheds some light.

Just some days ago, I put my hand into it for a few seconds. I took it to see dead and wrinkled skin, my nails also curled and seemed dead. It was probably because I had entered space without a spacesuit.

Oops, I forgot to tell you all that I'm invisible; no light touches me, and no thanks to the black hole. I'm really very sorry to you all, but soon I'm coming for you. I don't know where I'm headed next, maybe some other country, most probably on a container ship. If I accidentally find and consume you, please don't mind, no hard feelings.

I'm not visible on infrared cameras either, for the black hole keeps me invisible. Duh!!
