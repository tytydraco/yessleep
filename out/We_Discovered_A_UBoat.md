As I sat there in the Coast Guard ship's infirmary, I felt thankful that I was still alive.

I along with the surviving members of the fishing boat I worked on, were being questioned about the deaths of four of our friends.

Although it happened a week ago, it still feels like a nightmare...

*"So, help me understand how four of your friends ended up dead?"*

*"I already told you, I don't know!"*

*"Oh, I think you know so start from the beginning and tell me exactly what happened 2 days ago, on that fishing boat..."*

Okay, my name is *Ann* (not my actual name of course) and for several years, I've been working on a fishing boat, called *The Aurora.*

*The Aurora* is larger than your average fishing boat with a crew consisting of 20 men and 10 women, including myself.

Anyway, a week before this tragic incident occurred we were informed about a fishing job off the coast of the *Bermuda Islands* which would have given me and the rest of the crew, a very big paycheck.

We arrived off the coast of the *Bermuda Islands,* 5 days later.

The first day out the sky was clear and the waters were relatively calm. 

That all changed though, on the 2nd day out...

See that day, started out like any other day until a very powerful storm began to approach us producing massive waves that nearly capsized our boat.

It was about 2 hours later when the storm finally subsided.

While we were all on deck assessing the damage, a guy by the name of *Jules* began shouting, *"Look guys, isn't that a submarine over there?!"*

We all gathered around *Jules* to see what he was talking about.

Sure enough off in the distance, we spotted what appeared to be an older model submarine.

We all stood there in amazement as we decided what to do next...

It was then decided that several of us would board the submarine, in hopes of maybe salvaging it.

As we got closer, *Joe* who was an expert on old submarines said, *"That's a U-Boat, the Germans used them during WW1 and 2."*

Anyway, it was decided that 5 of us would board the U-Boat, including *Joe* and me.

Opening the hatch proved to be a difficult task though, due to the formation of rust but somehow, we managed to pry it open.

Once the hatch was open, we boarded the U-Boat and were immediately hit with this god-awful stench causing me and the rest of the crew to lose our lunch.

Walking through the bowels of the U-Boat, I noticed that surprisingly, it wasn't dank but, it was cold and very dark.

Luckily though, we brought our flashlights with us.

As we explored different parts of the U-Boat, something felt off. 

I also got the feeling that we weren't alone.

Just at that moment, confirming my worst fears, something began to bang violently against the hull causing it to reverberate throughout the bowels of the U-Boat.

I covered my ears in an attempt to block out the frightening sound.

Soon enough though, the sound was then replaced with big band music and this, of course, freaked out us the hell out.

And the whispering in German...

We needed to leave.

Just as we were about to leave though, some unseen force began to grab us one by one.

I could hear the screams as each of my crew was being snatched away but there was nothing I could do for them.

I felt so helpless.

Somehow though, I managed to escape and shouted at the others on *The Aurora* to help me.

Once I was safely back on the boat, we contacted the Coast Guards and in a very calm voice, I explained to them what had happened.

We remained there until the Coast Guards arrived leaving *The Aurora* behind.

After nearly 3 hours of being interrogated, I was finally cleared of any wrongdoing 9which was a relief to me).

That was several days ago...

Anyway, the reason why I'm sharing my story here is that I need your help... 

I've been seeing *Joe* and the others everywhere, so I think they're still alive and I'm going back to get them...
