I’m twenty-eight, and I live in Shard End. The streets here are flat, dull, lined with council houses and cracked pavements. Streetlights flicker on at the same hour every night, but they feel like they’re lying, like they turn off when you look the other way. I’ve lived here my whole life, and I’ve always thought the city was empty. Not people-empty—something else.

It started with coke. Just a line at first. A mate’s flat in Digbeth. White powder on a glass table, the smell sharp, almost metallic. The first hit made the city alive. Every brick, every lamp post, every person seemed to pulse in rhythm with me. I could feel it in my veins: the whole of Birmingham bending to me. It was brilliant… until the edges started to blur.

I began seeing them in the streets. Shadows that didn’t belong. Just at the corner of my eye. A man or a woman—I couldn’t tell—but always watching, stretching impossibly along brick walls. Sometimes, when I turned, they were gone. Sometimes, I swear, they mimicked me. Walking like me, laughing like me, slower, wrong. Learning.

Cocaine didn’t just sharpen my senses—it made them lie to me. I could feel the city breathing. The houses whispered, the streetlights hissed. Every car passing me seemed to have eyes in the headlights, following me home. I’d slam my door and the shadows would be inside my flat before I’d even turned the lock.

The paranoia got worse. My friends noticed. They said I was distant, twitchy. My mum cried and said I looked like a stranger. I didn’t care. I could hear the whispers now. Soft, patient, like someone speaking inside my skull. It wasn’t words—it was suggestions. “Go outside. Go down there. Look at them. Watch.” I would obey, because I couldn’t stop myself.

I started wandering. Nights bled into mornings. I roamed the streets of Shard End and Yardley, through the canals near Washwood Heath, past abandoned warehouses and burnt-out cars. People crossed the road when they saw me. I smiled at them. Sometimes I swore they spoke to the figure, not me.

The figure—whatever it was—appeared fully one night on Barn Lane. I had been staring at the canal water, lines running through my nose, heart hammering. And it was there. Pale, thin, eyes black and empty, smiling in a way that didn’t fit any human face. It didn’t move. Just watched. And somehow, I knew it wanted me to do things I couldn’t explain, things I wouldn’t admit to myself.

I tried to stop. Tried to sleep. But sleep became a trap. I dreamt of streets bending into impossible angles. Of my flat stretching taller, narrower. Of my reflection in the mirror moving before I did, smirking, whispering. I’d wake with scratches on my arms, bruises that weren’t there before. My furniture shifted. My floorboards groaned with footsteps I didn’t make.

One night, I blacked out. Woke up in a warehouse near Bordesley Green. Empty, walls covered in graffiti that squirmed and twisted when I blinked. And there it was again, sitting cross-legged, smiling at me with those hollow eyes. My own voice echoed back at me. “Do it. Do it now.”

I ran. Or maybe I didn’t. Time no longer made sense. Days and nights became streets. Shadows followed me everywhere. And every shadow I passed seemed to multiply, twisting and writhing into shapes that shouldn’t exist. Faces formed in the brickwork—my face, my mum’s, my mates’. They laughed at me when I ran.

I started talking to the figure. Arguing. Begging. Sometimes it answered. Not with words, but thoughts, impulses I couldn’t resist. It made me snort more. Made me step further into alleys, into darkness, into memories I wanted to forget. The streets of Shard End became a maze I couldn’t escape. The figure moved inside my skull, whispering, learning, mimicking.

Shard End stopped being a place. It became a mind. A breathing, thinking, twisting labyrinth. I can feel the figure in every brick, every crack, every flickering light. It’s patient. It’s learning. And I know it wants me to disappear completely—to melt into the city, to become another shadow that whispers and guides the next victim.

I can’t sleep. If I close my eyes, the city breathes through me. Pavements crawl beneath my feet. Lamp posts twist into arms. Windows watch. Doors open to rooms I’ve never entered. And everywhere I go, the figure waits, mimicking me perfectly, smiling as it repeats my thoughts before I even have them.

I see other figures now. Shadows in the shapes of my friends, my family, strangers I passed on the street. They whisper in the same voice as the figure, teasing me, calling me, laughing. Sometimes they vanish, leaving only echoes of my own voice. Sometimes they move ahead of me, showing me paths I’m too scared to follow—or too compelled to resist.

The city bends around me. Canals split into impossible paths. Brick walls stretch up endlessly. Streetlamps form shapes I recognize—my own face staring back, smirking. People pass by, but when I look, their faces melt into the figure’s pale, hollow stare.

I’ve stopped trying to leave. There is no leaving. Every street, every building, every alley is part of the labyrinth now. The figure is patient. Waiting. Learning. I can feel it in my veins. Not the cocaine. Something older. Something alive. Something that feeds on my fear, on my obsession, on my mind.

I can’t run anymore. I can’t hide. I can’t even close my eyes. Because if I do, Shard End swallows me completely.

And the figure smiles.

Because now… it owns me.
