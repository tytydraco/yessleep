If I tell you, they'll come back. 

They already found me and took it. Now I only have what's in my head to try and convince the world of the horror I saw. 

Hopefully it's enough that you'll believe me, but appropriately vague so I stay alive. If I could be quiet about it, I would. But I can't, so don't bother me about that either.

Okay, here goes.

The video came from a local secondhand store. I don't buy VHS or DVDs ever; I was looking for jeans. But the faded masking tape and the even more decayed movie title called to me from adolescent days, when my dad used to record movies off cable. 

We'd watch them over and over, none more so than Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Even with his clumsy edits - I never saw the shaman guy pull the heart out of that guy - we loved it. 

So I picked up the tape because somebody had written Doom on it in a big, thick sharpie just like dad used to. I figured the Temple of part had simply worn away. 

I couldn't have been more wrong.

After digging up my parents’ VCR, which I had inherited, I watched the first episode of Everyone's Mom. In Russian, it's called Мама каждого, but the show isn’t Russian. 

At least, I don't think it is. The dialogue spoken by the actors - I guess that's what they were or thought they were - is in something else. I couldn't figure out what.

So, Episode One, all based on what I remember.

The VCR tracking clears up the beaten tape decently. A white band continually rains across the scene, a kitchen set up like any western sitcom. A middle aged woman in an apron puts on oven mitts and winks at the camera before a man and two young girls rush in with the same complaint. They're asking “What's for dinner?” or maybe “When will it be ready?”

These people are the woman's tv family. She is Everyone's Mom, but I don't understand how yet. She is attractive but not overly made up. There's firmness beneath her red blouse, and the apron, an athlete once upon a time, perhaps. 

Some kind of admonishment is hurled from her thin lips. The girls sulk. So does the dour husband. That's the joke. Or so I think.

The rest of the episode unfolds, and seems to be about the husband saying something at work, something that is not well received by his fellow workers at a machine shop. His boss speaks to him but the husband is secretly defiant. 

After a stern but not unkind lecture from his boss, the husband scoffs and lights a cigarette. As he is leaving the shop, he hesitates, and glances back. Real terror grips his expression. The scene cuts away roughly, back to the kitchen.

Everyone's mom receives her humble husband. Their conversation sounds serious. 

She places a strange box on the kitchen table. It's completely dark, not painted black, but like the empty depths of space, devoid of stars. He stares into the abyss of the box's surface. His skin visibly pales. If its acting, then the husband is the best in the world. 

His TV wife says something with apparent gravity. He flinches as she leaves and turns off the light. The man is left in the kitchen with the box, darker than the dark. At last, he sighs and takes it with him. 

A rough cut makes me think of a commercial break, and the way my dad would sit by the VCR, carefully excising advertisements with his finger on the record button.

When the static subsides, the kitchen is lit by a fabricated sunrise. Everyone's mom turns from the sink with a breakfast tray. She almost curtsies when she places it on the table. Her husband staggers in slowly, fatigued, uncomfortable.

Her dialogue is short, a question.

He reveals the box, carefully hidden at his side, away from the audience. With what care he can manage - his hands tremble - he sets the cursed object beside the tray. 

Everyone's mom resumes setting up for breakfast. I think she asks if he's hungry. He gasps and passes out on the floor, but not before his head strikes the seat of a chair.

The shot cuts to a close-up of Everyone's mom's face. She shakes her head and smirks, dropping some line, a joke no doubt, according to the laugh track. Her image freezes and the credits roll.

End of episode one.

Strange, peculiar, and mildly disturbing. I figured it was just cultural differences and the obvious language barrier. Totally understandable. I popped out the tape and played video games. 

The tape stayed on top of the VCR for the better part of a month. I didn't think about it until I saw her at the outlet mall. She walked out of a furniture store while I waited in line for a hotdog from a food truck.

It couldn't be her. That's what I thought. I resumed waiting. But then she answered her cell and smiled. Even behind thick sunglasses, those big teeth and wire lips were a remarkable coincidence. 

Too remarkable. I left the line. I knew I was right when I got close enough to hear her speaking that language, whatever it is. The call ended and she paused to hit a vape. That's when she saw me watching. Her eyebrows shot up. 

“Yes?” she asked, without an accent. “Got a problem?” Her show looked like it came from the 80s at the latest. Yet she appeared strong and almost youthful, maybe younger even. She'd certainly kick my ass.

“Sorry, I don't mean to stare. Uh, are you from a TV show? Were you in a TV show called Everyone's Mom?”

“I don't know what the fuck you are talking about!” she shrieked in a way that said she knew exactly what the fuck I was talking about.

“Look,” I said, “I'm not trying to upset you. I found an old tape, with your show. Kind of a crazy coincidence to see you in Bridal Veil Lake. The show doesn't look Canadian. Where was it filmed?”

She took off her sunglasses, put them in her purse, and then dropped said purse. Without preamble, she raced across the corridor of the outdoor mall where we stood, near an Old Navy, and punched me in the face. 

I fell backwards and tasted blood before I hit the ground. “What the hell, lady? Are you nuts or something?” She came at me again and tightened her fist inside my t-shirt, twisting the material until I couldn't breathe.

She berated me in her language, and belted me again. Security guards showed up but didn't do anything except watch. Yet their presence was enough for her to let go. She spat on me and went right to the nearest guard.

“Sex assault,” she said, pointing backward at me while she walked away. I hadn't resumed breathing normally to deny it. The guards took this silence as confirmation.

They moved in and grabbed my arms, dragging me up to standing. I shrugged them off and just booked it. I'm a pretty good runner when the direction is away from trouble and psycho bitches.

I didn't know what to do next. Laying low, working from home, avoiding the mall seemed like prudent choices. It didn't take long to give in to the urge to watch more of the tape.

Episode 2

Once again, she winks at the camera. Her casual joy wavers when her daughters enter, arguing about something to do with their faces. Make-up, I figure, but I am wrong.

The matter is settled by the entrance of their father. All of them rush to his comfort, pulling out his chair, bringing coffee, and unfolding a newspaper. They fawn over him. It's a classic extortion attempt by a TV family. Or would be if the man didn't appear so grim. He barely has the energy to pick up his cup, and drools when he finally does coordinate sipping.

TV dad mutters something and is watched closely while he leaves for his job. The girls resume fighting. After an establishing shot of their school, they enter a locker filled hallway, still arguing. They keep pointing at each other's faces, and at their own. 

Some boys enter and talk but the girls ignore them completely. They all go to class where another exhausted looking man, a teacher, sits at a desk. A prolonged lecture ensues. The sisters appear enthralled and deeply affected. By the end of it, they look at one another and point at their own faces. 

They laugh, and embrace, having reached an end to their argument.

Everyone's mom mops the floor. The girls race in excitedly and slip. A cheesy fast forward effect is used to slide them across the screen with cartoonish speed and sound effect - whoosh! 

Mom shakes her head at the muddy streak across the freshly cleaned floor. She tosses down the mop and goes to her daughters in the living room. The girls are upside down on the couch. A laugh track suggests the humour.

Incomprehensible dialogue is exchanged but it ends with the girls tapping a finger to their cheek as if they want a peck from mom. Instead, she brings out the creepy ass box from the previous episode.

The sisters nod and intertwine their fingers. They carry the box together, upstairs, presumably to their room. 

I drop my beer when they scream. It's so loud, I'm confused about the source. It's a little like when advertisements used to jack up the volume to shock viewers. It works. I'm fucking unnerved but I have no idea what's being sold.

Everyone's mom rolls her eyes, says a one liner, I guess, and heads upstairs. Laughter and clapping erupts when she freezes and the credits roll.

There's no introduction to the next episode. The screen erupts with snow and it clears on the girls’ disfigured faces. But only for a second or two. It switches again to their unfolding hands. Inside is an eyeball - their eyeballs. They smile at one another. They smile. They laugh. They smile. Each sister is missing an eye. 

They give an eye to the box. They're about to touch it, to open it. 

End of episode two

The tape stopped and ejected on its own. I didn't move for a while. Hell, I couldn't get my fingers to stop white knuckling the recliner's arms. 

What the fuck had I seen? It looked real. Maybe that was the show? Like maybe it was meant to mess with viewers’ expectations of genre? Some kind of art piece. Sure, that could be it. I couldn't convince myself. 

It looked real. Really real. But what did I know about ripped out eyeballs? Those girls wouldn't be smiling about that. Thus, I concluded, it must be fake.

Yet, I still hadn't moved. 

And I didn’t. Not until the tape put itself back into the VCR, and started playing again.

“Christ, no!” I leapt and pulled the plugs on everything. I didn’t want to see any more. I’d been inside too long, I decided. 

Nothing had come from the incident at the outlet mall. The security guards probably watched the footage and saw how she’d attacked me without any visible provocation. 

No point in calling the police about it. I’d probably have a pretty good case for assault, but would likely be villainized in court. Nobody would believe I hadn’t said something filthy or sexist to her first. 

In the late afternoon, I walked to the secondhand store where I’d gotten the tape. There are a lot of these places surrounding the tourist area of Bridal Veil Lake. They’re basically pawn shops without any hope of redemption; shopkeepers underpay for the items, and never give them back. Desperate tourists return to the casino to continue gambling or pay off another predatory lender. 

This one was called Stefan’s.

I went inside. Heat and humidity mixed with mothballs and dust clung to the inside of my nostrils. The rattling fans above the teenage cashier provided mild relief.

“I bought a tape here,” I said to the girl.

She didn’t look away from her phone. “Uh-huh.”

“A VHS tape. It, uh, was a weird show from… I don’t know… like Russia but not Russia. It wasn’t labelled. I thought it was Temple of Doom…”

“We don’t buy old VHS tapes,” she said, again without looking at me. 

“But I bought it from here.”

“We don’t sell old, unlabelled VHS tapes. Like, what would be the price even?”

“I think I paid two bucks,” I pointed out. 

She sighed. “Do you have the receipt?”

I couldn’t remember getting one. “No. I…”

“Then how can I help you, sir?”  

There were no other customers in the poorly lit aisles of old appliances and broken toys. I never did find a decent pair of jeans here. I doubted the legitimacy of Stefan’s.

“Someone took my money for this tape,” I said.

“Do you want your money back?”

“No, I… it’s the tape, and what’s on it… it’s…look, is there a manager here?”

“Stefan!” the girl practically screamed in my face. “This guy wants to talk to you about a tape or something.”

“A what?”  The question came from some back room, surprisingly close but where exactly I never found out.

“A tape!”

Finally, I heard shuffling and footsteps and out walked none other than the TV dad from the show. He looked grayer and a little wrinkly but nowhere near the age I would expect. The same lacklustre energy suffused his dour expression and slumped posture. Despite the overwhelming heat, he wore a cardigan.  

“What can I help you with?” he asked in perfect, unaccented English. 

“Taking my break,” the girl said before I could answer. She pushed through the front door and lit up a smoke without breaking eye contact with her phone.

“Um, I bought a tape a while ago, and…” I still had swelling and bruises from my first encounter with an Everyone's Mom cast member. “There’s a show, and I was wondering if you could tell me about it.”

His faded blue eyes regarded me. “Everyone's Mom,” he admitted. “Yes, but how did you get it?” 

“I bought it from your store, sir,” I said.

“Oh? How odd. It must have got on the shelf by mistake.” He held out his hand.

“I don't have it with me,” I said.

“Oh.” He retracted his hand and looked sad until a sudden thought seemed to give him some energy. “You could bring it. You have it at your home, yes?”

“I do, but-”

Stefan started to get excited. He took my hand and squeezed gently. “Yes, bring it back here. I don't know how it got on the shelf. It should never have been on the shelf, and who sold it? That's a wonder. We don't sell unmarked tapes. So you will bring it back and-” 

His verbal torrent ceased when he caught the empty space where his employee had been smoking. She'd sold it to me. I remembered now. Thinking she'd been found out, she took off before Stefan could fire her or worse.

“She did it. She sold you the tape, and kept the money.”

“Look, it was only two dollars. I'll bring it back.”

He shook his fist at the empty space. “She knows we don't sell unmarked VHS tapes.”

“Which is probably why she did,” I said, forgetting completely the purpose of coming into the store. “She thought you wouldn't miss the tape, and, well, I guess you didn't before I told you.”

“I'll get her,” Stefan said quietly, almost to himself. 

I didn't understand. But that was nothing new. “I'll get it now. Don't worry.” As soon as I stepped onto the sidewalk, I realised my total failure to discover anything more about the show. Hell, I didn't even mention the fact Stefan’s TV wife had beaten me up. Surely, that had to be relevant information to him. 

Whatever. I would get the disgusting arthouse tape, give it back to him, and be done with the whole ordeal forever. 

Before I got to the corner, Stefan stuck his head out the door, and shouted, “Don’t watch it!”

I grinned sheepishly. “Sorry, I watched some already. I thought it was Temple of Doom.”

“Oh…”  He seemed to think about it. “Don’t watch more! Don’t watch the end! Don’t watch it. Don’t…” His voice trailed off as he went back inside his store.

I walked home briskly, fully intending to get this man his tape without watching anymore. But it was already playing when I got inside, and I couldn’t seem to look away from the horror. 

Episode ???

The sisters have no eyes. Their noses have been removed. They smile broadly so it’s evident a number of their teeth are gone as well. Both girls, by this point in the series, appear to have entered adulthood, so I know it’s not episode three or even the third season of the show. It’s definitely the same girls though, the ones who gleefully gave up an eye to the mysterious box on the kitchen table.

Stefan drinks with his right hand because the left one is missing. He must have picked up a fake one between this time and our meeting. I just never noticed.

Everyone’s mom is leading a family meeting. The subject matter is grim and directed at Stefan. She tugs at the ends of her hair, which is grey. There are prominent wrinkles around her eyes, more than what I saw at the outlet mall. She taps his forearms and asks him something sweetly. He reluctantly nods and starts to cry as he rolls back his sleeve.

The girls clap their identical stumps. 

Their TV mom produces a butcher’s knife and brings it to Stefan. I turn away before I can see the cut. Pain erupts from his lips and I know it isn’t acting. It’s real. It’s real. What the fuck is going on? 

When he begins to whimper, I finally look back to find him holding a strip of his own skin. He grits his teeth and opens the box. I can’t see what’s inside, but whatever is there tugs at the strip of flesh until Stefan can close the lid again. 

Everyone’s mom is happy. The girls are happy. Stefan is coated with sweat and vomits on the floor. 

That’s when his TV wife looks at the camera and drops her trademark one liner before the conclusion of the show. There’s applause, of course, and the frozen image fades to credits in this later season. I watch them without hope of decoding it. But then, at the end, there’s a drawing.

End of episode ???

I couldn't find anything to write with or on. What I remember is a bull-headed monster with its hands over a fire. That's enough for Google; it led me to a name. What I read is terrifying but I didn't have time to get deep into it because that's when they opened my door.

It was locked. I never leave it unlocked. It was locked! It isn't fair. 

Everyone's mom and dad walked in, and were followed by a crew. A dozen or so people silently filed into the apartment, carrying crates and tools. I sat on the floor, closed my eyes, and tried to imagine it away.

She took the tape and hit me with it. “Who gave you this?!”

“I bought it,” I said, but too quietly. I don't think she heard. 

“Kill him,” she said. 

I didn't have time to scream. They all grabbed my arms and legs and pinned me to the floor. She watched while they readied their saws for my dismemberment and disposal. 

“Please! No! Stop!” 

I searched for Stefan and found him near the door, leaning against one of the crates. 

The electric saw was about to cut into my neck. “Molek! Please! Molek! Molek! Molek!”  That’s the name of the bull headed monster, according to Google.

The name made the crew flinch and hesitate. 

“Molek! Molek! Molek!”

Her swift kick took out a molar, which I spat on my chest.

“Stop saying that,” she said. 

“Molek!” I said louder. “Please.” I have no idea what the name meant or why it should make her even madder, but I sure as hell wasn't about to be quiet to ease the process of my murder.

Stefan shouted something, finally, in the language they used from the tape. She shouted back and they argued a little before he came and knelt down beside me.

“Do you want the box?”

I knew what box he meant, and I certainly didn't want it, but the alternative - a painful death - was no kind of choice either. Or so I thought. I should have chosen death. Then I never would have seen it or the last daughter. Then I'd be free.

Regrettably, I nodded.

Stefan argued some more with everyone's mom but she relented fast. He gripped my shoulder. He smiled, genuinely happy for the moment. “The show was made for this. So that we might show others the way. I didn't think it would work. You are the first to choose God over death.”

Lucky me. 

“Bring out the box, mother,” Stefan said to who I thought was his wife.

A hairline away from death had put me into a daze. I asked, like it mattered, “She's not your wife?”

Stefan beamed, and smiled. “She's my mother.” He gestured to the crew. “She's everyone's mother.” He laughed. “You will understand soon.”

From where it came, I didn't see, but there the midnight box sat on the floor beside me. 

She knelt down, and seemed less angry. “Forgive me. I had begun to give up hope there would ever be another.”

“That’s okay-”

“Sh! Not you,” she snapped. “You are nothing yet. Not until you give something you can never get back.” To my continued astonishment, she unbuttoned her shirt, revealing patches of scar tissue beneath prosthetic breasts. Her real ones were gone, and then I knew why.

I opened the box, and looked inside.  Somehow the darkness within is even darker than the exterior. It seemed alive, though nothing could be seen. It watched me. It waited.

“What should I give?” I asked her. “What does it want?”

The rest of the crew had taken out their phones and begun to record. 

“God wants everything,” she said. “But you aren't ready. We all begin small.” She plucked the tooth from my shirt, and held it out between me and the emptiness of the box. 

“Molek?” I asked. I don't know why. It was just a tooth. I could live without it. Yet, I hesitated. Something other than the fear of pain and dying warned me against giving anything to it. A primal wariness of something known in human DNA but consciously forgotten. This is the enemy.

“This is god,” she said. “Put it in. You will know.”

I took my molar and reached for the box. 

She seized my wrist hard and fast. “Drop it in, you fool. God takes what is given, accidentally or not. You want to give your whole hand, your arm?”

I don't know why I looked at Stefan at that moment. I did. He touched the prosthetic hand with his remaining one. Our eyes met. He tried to smile encouragingly but it faltered quickly and he resumed staring at nothing.

She let go. I dropped the tooth. It disappeared into the box without a sound. There'd be the soft impact of an object hitting the interior bottom of any ordinary box. I guess I wished I'd heard such a sound. Maybe then I could convince myself that all of this was somehow a trick.

It wasn’t. It isn't. 

One of the crates brought in by the crew jostled slightly. Then a bell began to tingle inside.

Everyone’s mom stood up and clapped her hands once. “Open it!” she ordered. 

Stefan appeared more uncertain. “Must we? It's a lot for him already and-”

His mom slapped him without hesitation. Crew members unlocked and opened the lid of the crate. They tipped it up slowly, presenting the last of two daughters to me.

The sight bolted me to the floor. So little of her is left. None of her facial features - teeth, hair, ears - remain. All four limbs are gone. Scars from repeatedly stripped flesh mar the entirety of her, every inch. They have suspended her by the torso in the crate with heavy cords. I don't even know how I knew it was her.

“God, no,” I said. This couldn’t be real. “How could you? How could you?” I began to accuse them all.

“You don't understand,” Stefan said. “She gave everything willingly, for her mother.”

“For us,” she corrected acidly. Stefan wilted. “And now she will give again, for you, initiate, to hasten your understanding of god.”

Before I could react, she brought a knife out and gouged a length of skin from her daughter's shoulder. The torso writhed in the cords. That empty mouth stretched and offered a muted scream. Tears streamed from hollow eye sockets. I started to retch on the floor.

Mom fed the flesh to the box. 

Stefan brought me a wet cloth while the crew rather mundanely packed everything, including the last daughter, up. Mom took the box. 

They left my apartment without saying goodbye. Stefan said, “You will understand by morning.” He tried to smile again but couldn't manage to be genuine. He followed the rest to the stairwell exit.

I sat in my chair for a while. I got a beer from the fridge. It's like I wanted to freak out but too much had happened. I was overwhelmed. Hollow would be an accurate description. The part that could feel no longer functioned.

“I should call the police,” I said to the empty apartment. That's when I noticed the tape was gone. Mom and her cult had taken it with them. 

Stefan’s shop disappeared too. I went the next day. They'd even scrubbed the sign till nothing remained. 

But did I know by morning?

Yes. Kind of. 

I'm forty-three years of age. I had the grey hair and sagging muscle tone to prove it. I fell asleep in my chair that night. When I woke up, I felt the difference immediately. No lower back pain, no tension in my hips. 

I could have cartwheeled like a child into the bathroom, and then I saw why: I’m a forty-three year old man. I now look to be in my early teens. On the plus side, I was able to freak out finally, which I did, alternating between shrieks of insanity and cautious joy. 

On the extreme downside, I can only work from home and interact with precisely no one. No one would believe who I really am. People that look like me are literal children. I have no community except one, and, like I said, Stefan’s is gone. I don't know where they are, and I am very afraid I'll find them. Or they'll find me… many years from today, when I've aged again, and the price seems low.

I have given a molar. It's gone. For good. 

What would you give for more time? 

The price will be higher, much higher, next [time](https://www.reddit.com/u/APCleriot/s/1FL8RX29A2).
