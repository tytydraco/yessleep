A dear friend of mine wrote these journal entries, and I have taken the liberty of sharing them. This story does not deserve to waste away inside her small, hand-bound journal, so I thought it best to transcribe every word she wrote and share them here. I figure this is the right audience, so please don’t let this story waste away. I can’t express how important this is to me.

It would have been better for her to share these herself, in fact I doubt she planned for these to ever be shared at all. Just more notes to herself, another hobby that I never understood. Yet, it's just too important not to bring to light.

Please, read this. Only these notes will ever lead to justice.

**07.10.2012 - SUNDAY \[08:24 AM\]**

Everyone was excited for the trip. We had been planning this for months, collecting our minimum wage pays and throwing them all towards our supplies. Making lists of who would bring what, what we would eat through our trip, what we would do when we got there… There was so much planning, I was honestly worried we would hardly even feel as though we were resting.

Laura was the one who suggested it – Laura, the wonderful, always bright Laura. She is my best friend, the person closest to me, the person that hears about every twist and turn in my life. She is nurturing by nature and had been the one to organise this entire trip for the lot of us. She had found the campsite online, and figured it looked nice enough. It was an out of the way, beautiful place, surrounded by water and accessible by ferry. The photos she had showed us all seemed so surreal. I can’t speak on behalf of everyone else, but I know I’m excited to make it there.

We left about an hour ago, and in my boredom, I decided it was the perfect time to write this entry—to track my thoughts and get them onto paper. It helps me vent — in this case, it helps me stop my hands from trembling with both nerves and sheer excitement. I can’t quite remember the last time we had a chance to get out like this, especially all as one group. It’s nice to get away before we have to dive back into lectures and exams. I’ll give credit where it’s due — Laura had a great idea with this trip.

Before we left, the conversation had come as to where exactly we were going. As it turns out, most of my group are far more proactive than I was, but that surely wasn’t much of a surprise. In a time where the internet was starting to become part of everyday life, my friends were always attached to a device – always researching something new and indulging in their peculiar interests. I’m not faint of heart, but whenever they come to me with the latest in their ‘scary stories’ and strange made-up creatures, I do feel like I’m glancing over my shoulder a little too often. Last week, Oliver was telling me about some tall guy that roamed the woods. I don’t remember the name, but I just remember him mentioning something about pages pinned to trees. Real weird stuff. It baffles me that they spend their time looking at it all.

They could show me all sorts of creatures, all sorts of poorly edited photos, but not until I saw these things with my own eyes would I ever believe them. There was no better proof than my own sight. Clearly, this lot didn’t even need half of that to get going on something fantastical.

Oliver was really into it. Mysterious creatures and places, looking into the circumstances behind them – the apparent ‘evidence’ that proved them all true. He enjoyed it, which to me was unimaginable, but he liked it. What made it more shocking was that his girlfriend, Mia, another joining us on our adventure, was absolute petrified of it. She was easily frightened, worried about just about everything she heard. I’ve always assumed it relates to her vivid imaginations. Out of everyone, she would be able to picture these beings so clearly. Unlike her partner who dwells on his computer whenever he has a free moment, she would paint or write, indulging in lighter, more creative hobbies. Her mind is beautiful, as is she, so to be plagued with images of online horror doesn’t do her any favours.

Oliver had been the one to bring up the research he had done. When we interrogated him on why exactly he felt the need to do so, he only tried to convince us that it was 'an urge he couldn’t resist.' We all knew he was just looking for something to scare us with.

**OLIVER:** There’s only a few mentions of this place anywhere, seriously. I found a newspaper and that was about all.

**CHASE:** What? Disappointed we’re not walking into a ghost town?

Chase. The tall, stoic man that he is. Well, maybe not quite stoic, but he certainly has a face you (or rather I) don’t want to look away from. He’s playful, though not too much as to be annoying. He has fun, he teases, plays around. He was just someone who was easy to get along with, though he didn’t try to please everyone at his own detriment. I shouldn’t be surprised that the hearts in my eyes made me blind to any flaws he likely possesses, but in my eyes, he really was incredible.

Chase shared some level of interest in this rising culture, though of course, no one came close to competing with Oliver’s obsession. Chase would never shut him down or belittle him about his interests, only giving playful and teasing comments, poking and prodding at the man to rile him up. Nonetheless, Chase’s comment did garner an unimpressed look.

**OLIVER:** Actually, it’s much better than that. Ghosts wouldn't explain anything that's happened on this island. They don't even come close.

This caught Mia’s attention, in fact, the whole group stood together now, Miles having joined us after he finished packing his bag into his car. He’s not exactly a people person, but we got along with him. He was rude at times, more often than you would think of someone who calls himself a friend, but his attitudes were usually tolerable. We had known him long enough to know when his out of pocket remarks were to insult or were just a result of his nihilistic aura. Still, he was never quite clear on if he really enjoyed this topic of conversation – the supernatural or the unexplainable. So, when he chimed in about the island, it came as a surprise to everyone.

**MILES:** Isn’t this the place those two guys went missing? They never found them right? Two friends?

**OLIVER:** Uh… yeah. The wife of one of them was the one to report it. Apparently she never recovered from the disappearance.

**MIA:** They just… disappeared? What happened?

I remember Mia’s expression as she spoke. She looked petrified. Too bad it was too late to turn back from the trip. Oliver, chose to hold his tongue, however Miles had not been as considerate.

**MILES:** No one knows. Isn’t that obvious? If they knew, they would say they were murdered or mauled, not just missing.

Mia looked offended. Hell, I was offended. I was a second off of asking the same question.

**MILES:** Most people think there’s a serial killer that lives on the island. Other people think it’s animal attacks or monsters or whatever else they can think of.

Everyone was intrigued, leaning in to listen to more. It wasn’t like Laura knew any of this before booking. Unlike Oliver, and apparently Miles too, she didn’t have any interest in the stories people made up, let alone believe any of them, even now. Her and I were alike in this sense. We would entertain the group. Of course, they could look into whatever they wanted to. It had never bothered us. However, we just knew where to draw the line. We didn’t believe it. If those men had gone missing, they likely just got lost and were left to the mercy of the elements, or perhaps it was an animal attack, and the bodies were just too far gone to find. Regardless, Laura had decided based on Mia’s pale face, that that was where our conversation would end.

**LAURA:** Alright everyone. Enough speculating. We need to get going if we’re going to make it before night.

It was at that point that we all dispersed, our conversation interrupted. Mia and Oliver would travel together, Chase and Miles paired up too, leaving Laura and I as the last pair.

**LAURA:** Ellie, could you grab the last bag?

It was right beside me anyway, and after the bag was heaved into the tray on the back of her Ute, we could get ourselves settled in and comfortable for our trip.

We still have about an hour to go before we make it to the ferry, and then another half an hour from there to the campsite. I might take a nap and pass some more time. Can’t wait to get there!
