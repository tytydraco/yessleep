I Was Hired to Watch an Abandoned mansion—The Rules They Left still haunt me.

It all started with an ad on the internet, buried deep in a forgotten corner of a job board. I had no real intention of responding to it when I clicked, but there it was: "Overnight Caretaker Needed" $500 for a night’s work, light duties, no experience required. I was desperate, so I applied on impulse. Two hours later, I received an email with just a time and an address: Avery Estate, 9 PM. Instructions will be provided upon arrival.

The estate was about an hour’s drive outside of town, nestled in the woods, almost hidden behind a veil of thick branches and vines. The house itself was enormous, but not in a welcoming way. It loomed in the night like something out of a gothic novel—tall, dark, and imposing. The front door stood ajar, a single dim light flickering inside.

I hesitated at first, but I needed the money. I pushed the door open and stepped inside. The air smelled stale, musty, like the house hadn’t been aired out in years. The wooden floors creaked beneath my weight as I moved cautiously through the hall. Nothing moved, nothing stirred. Just the faint hum of the house’s aged structure.

The entryway was barren—no furniture, no warmth. But there, in the center of the room, was a small table, and on it, a sheet of paper, weighted down by a heavy brass key.

I reached for the paper, the cool metal of the key cold in my hand. The note was scrawled hastily in a hand I didn’t recognize, but the words were clear:


Caretaker Rules – Follow Exactly

1. Lock the front door as soon as you enter. Use the silver key hanging on the hook by the door. It’s the only one that works. If the key is missing, leave immediately. Do not look back.

2. Do not enter any room with a lit candle. If you see a candle burning, close the door immediately and lock it. Wait until 3:33 AM. before unlocking it again.

3. Every hour on the hour, wind the grandfather clock in the parlor. If the clock stops, leave the house. Do not take anything with you.

4. Ignore any knocking you hear. It doesn’t matter if it comes from a door, a window, or even the walls. Do not acknowledge it.

5. Avoid the west wing after midnight. If you hear footsteps coming from that direction, go to the kitchen and wait. Do not investigate.

6. If you see her, don’t run.** She doesn’t like it when you run.

7. The job ends at 6:00 AM. At 5:59, leave through the back door. Do not look behind you. If you feel cold air on your neck, run.


The last line made my stomach twist, but I pushed the feeling aside. It was just an odd list of instructions for some rich person’s house, I assumed. Maybe they were just paranoid or superstitious. But I wasn’t about to back out now.

I turned around and found the silver key hanging on a hook by the door, just like the note said. It was old, worn, but unmistakable. I took the key and looked at the door behind me, and then glanced back at the brass key. It didn’t seem to serve any purpose now, so I pocketed it as a curiosity.

I started my rounds as instructed. The first rule seemed simple enough—lock the door as soon as you enter. I felt silly for even worrying about it, but I did it, locking the door behind me with the silver key. I moved deeper into the house.

The second rule was the first one that made me uneasy. Do not enter any room with a lit candle. It seemed random, but I kept my eyes peeled for any candles. As I passed one of the rooms, I saw a soft glow from the crack in the door. I crept closer and peeked inside.

A small, flickering candle sat on an old oak table, casting long shadows across the room. I swallowed. The second rule was clear. I wasn’t supposed to be in here.

I slowly stepped back, gently closing the door. I turned the lock with a quiet click and moved on, leaving the candle burning inside. My heart was pounding a little faster now, but nothing seemed too out of the ordinary. After all, this was probably just some rich person’s eccentric rules. Right?

The hours passed with nothing too strange happening, just a couple more flickering candles in random rooms. I kept following the rules—locking doors, staying away from lit candles, and minding my business as much as I could. 

Then, at 11 p.m., I reached the grandfather clock in the parlor, standing tall and foreboding against the wall. It was a thing of beauty, all brass and dark wood, but its ticking was unsettling, too loud in the silence. I checked the time: 11:00 PM on the dot. I had to wind it.

I pulled open the glass case around the clock and grabbed the small winding key. As I twisted it, the clock groaned, the gears turning reluctantly. When I finished, I checked the time again. It had barely moved. Strange. I made a mental note to check it again at midnight.

By 12:15 a.m., I was starting to feel like I was just wasting time. No one had shown up, and the house remained as still as a tomb. The silence was deafening, and yet, I was becoming more aware of how often I was checking the time. Something about the quiet unnerved me.

Then it happened.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

It was soft at first, the sound echoing from behind one of the walls. I froze, my mind racing. The fourth rule flashed in my head: Ignore any knocking you hear." I shook my head, telling myself it was just the house settling. I stepped forward, my footsteps slow and deliberate, trying to push the unease out of my mind.

But then, the knocking grew louder.

*Knock. Knock. Knock.*

It was coming from the wall behind me, distinct, too deliberate. I should’ve listened to the rule and ignored it, but it was too much. I turned around.

Nothing.

I swallowed hard. It was nothing. Just the house, the old pipes, the wind. I turned back around, ready to leave, but that’s when I heard it again:

Knock. Knock. Knock.

I covered my ears, fighting the urge to stare in the direction it had come from. I wasn’t supposed to acknowledge it. The rules said not to, but it felt like the walls were closing in.

I moved on, finally making my way to the kitchen. I had to breathe. But as I entered the room, the door slammed shut behind me. I whirled around, my breath shallow. I stood there, staring at the door for what felt like an eternity, the rules echoing in my head.

I checked the time—3:33 AM. I could have sworn it was just midnight. I’d broken the knocking rule, but the next one hit me like a brick to the skull: Avoid the west wing after midnight.

I’d passed the west wing earlier, but now that I was closer to it, I could hear faint footsteps coming from behind the door. Panic surged through me. My heart thudded against my ribs.

 a sudden scratching noise came from the direction of the west wing. It was faint, almost imperceptible at first. I froze, holding my breath. The footsteps from earlier hadn’t stopped. They had only grown fainter, but now they were accompanied by this strange, unsettling sound, like something—or someone—was dragging itself across the floor.

I tried to follow the rule. Avoid the west wing after midnight. I didn’t investigate. But the scratching... It felt like it was calling me. Something deep in my bones told me to go check, but I pushed it aside, refusing to break the rules. Still, the sound lingered in the back of my mind, gnawing at me like a rat in the walls.

By 4:30 AM, I was pacing the hallway, jumping at every little sound. The house was creaking, groaning, the windows rattling with each gust of wind. I checked every door. Every room. I even peeked inside a few with the faintest glow of candles, but the moment I saw that light, I turned away and locked the doors behind me as instructed. But the house seemed more oppressive now. Every step I took felt heavier.

Then, at 5:00 AM, the door to the west wing creaked open. I hadn’t touched it. It had simply opened, and for a split second, I thought I saw the shadow of a woman flicker inside. I stumbled back, my breath catching in my throat. The air grew colder, sharper. I felt a presence, an intangible force that seemed to be drawing closer. The scratching, now louder, echoed from within. My instincts screamed at me to leave, to break the rules and run.

But I couldn’t. I wasn’t done yet. The clock was ticking down, and I was still bound by the rules.

It was 5:45 AM now. I moved back into the parlor to check the clock one more time, the ticking now louder than ever. The time read 5:45. I only had 15 minutes. But the house was closing in on me. My heart raced, my mind frantic. I thought I saw something move in the shadows, but when I looked closer, nothing was there.

Then, I heard it—a voice. It came from the west wing, a faint whisper, soft but unmistakable.

“Run.”

I froze. My heart thudded in my chest, the cold sweat trickling down my spine. I had to go. The rules said not to look back. The terror was overwhelming. I was seconds away from breaking.

The clock struck 5:59 AM.

Without thinking, I ran.

My feet hit the floor hard as I bolted down the hallway. The cold air from the back door hit me as I flung it open, stumbling into the night. My breath came in ragged gasps, my legs burning as I sprinted. The gravel crunched underfoot, the trees around me bending and twisting in the wind. I didn’t dare look back, but I felt a presence behind me, chasing me. The house seemed to breathe with me, its windows dark and empty, the door I had locked now standing wide open.

I threw my car door open and put the pedal to the floor. I didn’t stop driving until the distant glow of the city lights was visible on the horizon. Only then did I dare to slow down. My legs trembled, my body exhausted, but I didn’t stop. I couldn’t stop.

And I didn’t look back.

I sat in my car, still shaking, the events of the night replaying in my mind. My phone buzzed on the passenger seat. For a split second, I thought about ignoring it—another rule I’d follow long after leaving the house. But curiosity got the better of me.

The notification was an email.

“Subject: Payment Confirmation.”

My breath hitched. I opened it.

"Thank you for completing your shift at the Avery Estate. $500 has been deposited into your account."

That was it. No apology, no explanation—just cold, clinical confirmation. I refreshed my banking app, and sure enough, the money was there.

But something was off.

The email came from an address I didn’t recognize, something generic like caretaker@jobsportal.com. The sender field didn’t link to a company. It felt… anonymous, almost like it didn’t want to be found.

For a brief moment, I thought about replying, demanding answers. But as my fingers hovered over the keyboard, I remembered the house, the knocking, the whispers.

No.

Whatever had just happened, I didn’t want to know more. The money was there, and I wasn’t about to ask questions that might drag me back into whatever nightmare I’d barely escaped.

I closed the email and deleted it from my inbox, along with every trace of that job. But even as I sat there, trying to convince myself it was over, a single thought kept gnawing at me:

Who—or what—paid me, and did I want to know?
