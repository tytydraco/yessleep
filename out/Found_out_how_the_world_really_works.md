I decided to do a little urban exploring to get my mind off my mother in law's cancer.  She had been sick for half a decade, and it had made homelife dreary.  I was there for my wife, but there was only so much I could do comfort her as she was always one to deal with this stuff on her own.  You can only get told to fuck off so any times before you start to take the advice.  My wife liked company but preferred to grieve on her own as she felt it fostered self-sufficiency.  Weather I agreed or not, this did give me time to pursue my own hobbies such as acting like exploring abandoned buildings like I was fifteen again.

I hopped over the rusted gate and ran into the decrepit building to avoid any chance of getting caught.  I'm not sure why my interests became so morbid after her mom got ill.  Maybe this was my subconscious way of coping.  Perhaps my mother-in-law meant more to me than I realized.  Whatever the reason, I had gotten past the point being afraid of anything and felt I had to keep upping the stakes of my explorations to keep myself from thinking too much.  So, on I went to use danger as a form of escapism.

I was looking through rooms in order to find any freaky mysteries buried by the hospital to give this more of a video game vibe.  I managed to break open what looked like an old chief of medicine's office.  Just the normal stuff; carved pentagrams, swastikas, insults, 666 and a bunch of other symbols that looked like they came from an eighties metal album.  A bit disappointed, I decided to sit for a bit.  Many of these buildings didn't scare me at all and I needed a break as I came here straight from work and haven't had time to rest or eat.  I've explored enough to know where the most important "secrets" in these places hide.  It all came through the heart of the facility.  Where the "heart of the building" was depended on the specific facility.  Factories were a mystery due to the excessive number of nooks and crannies, Homes, despite their size, might have been worse, with schools and offices you just had to search the right desk, but hospitals were always the chief of medicine's office.  I guess there were to many unstable patience to put it anywhere else.  Scrambling thru files, I was about to just head home when I saw something interesting.

I picked up a folder with the symbol of a circle and lines standing around it.  I removed a document and from what I read, there happened to be a special group in this hospital.  A cult, I figured.  There was a make- shift map on the back, which made me think there must have been something pretty cool in this room.  I didn't find this in the trash, it was in a drawer I had to jimmy open which told this might have been an urban explorer's dream come true.  (You learn fast what is useful.)

I took a map of the hospital and followed the instructions from the document which led me to the third floor towards the end of the hallway.  I made my way to the destination only to find a wall.  Thinking the wall might be hallow, I began to punch and hit the wall with anything I could find.  However, the wall was solid with no sign of paint or anything that would imply something used to be here.  That didn't stop me, as I have become an expert on finding hidden entrances.  One of the reasons I brought the map was to navigate these hard-to-find areas.  I figured the entrance to this room might have been on the other side near the stair-well.  I went around to the stairs and found that the room on the other side of the building.  There was a secret entrance on the side of the stairs opposite the hallway I was in.  wanting to feel the thrill of uncovering a cool conspiracy, I climbed in the entrance hoping I might make a difference in this world.

I found myself in a pitch-black room that smelled like a large janitor's closet.  I searched around until I found a sign of light, or a breeze that could indicate a way out.  I found a door and made my way out and found myself in what felt like a small gymnasium.  I heard a small yelp and headed for the sound.  I had been exploring so much that stuff that should have terrified me, such as screams or signs of crimes, only intrigued me and pushed me forward.  I turned a corner to find a room with a small light in it.  I shoved my way in like I've been there before.

I saw a small group of people, some men and some women, who were surrounding a shaking patient patient.  I wondered if I walked into one of those live procedures that med students would watch.  For a brief moment, I thought I entered a part of the hospital that was still in operation and was about to leave when I noticed that the "patient" was awake.  I yelped, causing the group to turn around.  I started to run, but the door slammed shut with the leader standing right behind me.

"You can't leave yet!"

"wha.....wha...."

"Please, have a seat!"

As he turned to walk away, a seat materialized behind him.  Not knowing what to do, I sat hoping that if I cooperated, I wouldn't be in the "patience" place.  I could maybe leave and call the authorities.

"I know what this looks like.  You think we're monsters who are getting are rocks watching a man suffer!  A cult of hedonists with no motive but smile in the face of another's pain!"

"Uhhhhhh....."

"I assure you, we're not monsters, and we don't enjoy this.....We have to do this!"

"So, you're addicted?!!"

"The world depends on this man's suffering!!"

I wanted to run for the hills but thought I wouldn't get very far.  I sat still, trying not to panic.

"I know it's crazy, but we have seen things.  As bad as the world is, if we don't keep this man in pain, the chaos revealed will be so much worse.  And it doesn't happen fast.  It will be a gradual turn.  It won't be an explosion......more like a corrosion......a steady stream of mis-events that eventually leads to our destruction."

"Why do you think this?!  How does this work."

I say, trying to stall as long as I can.

"It's difficult to explain, but every person, whether it be positive or negative, releases energy.  The energy of an individual interacts with another's energy, which creates cohesion or friction that keeps the world in balance.  This is why some people love each other while some that can't stand a person.  Every unlikeable person as well as every town favorite serves a purpose.  That being said, most people don't have enough energy to have a noticeable effect on their own.  Their energy just comes off as normal human interaction, and the ones who are deemed more emotional and likeable cause a small reaction and are mixed in the sea of energy created by every person.  However, some people produce enough energy to really make difference.  Cult leaders, dictators, and visionaries of all stripes can use that energy to control the wave of energy.  This is, to, doesn't worry us, as most rarely ever discover their abilities, but a very rare few produces enough to affect the world all on their own.  For these people, their thoughts and opinions don't just carry more weight but creates a force that doesn't require appealing to societies emotions.  Their energy effects the abstract energy of others and create a domino effect of influence which can be mirrored by anyone without having any idea they are being influenced.  It is almost like a possession.  The ones who have the righteous religious status must be worshiped, while the ones who are malevolent must be despised, for this creates a balance of good and evil that keeps us a moral check.  The ones who the most energy is not able to control it.....it must be controlled for them.  This is David Echlin.  He is what we call "a negative unified force".  His torture brings stability that we, otherwise, wouldn't have!"

"What stability!!??  The world is in chaos!!  If this were real, I think you guys found the wrong person!"

"The level of chaos we'd have without this man's pain would be astounding!  You think the political chaos is bad now?!  Imagine riots that can actually bring down countries!  Imagine what comes up after is basically a black hole that just destroys.  No one would believe in anything anymore!  Everything would be about trying to destroy.  What we have now is not chaos!"

"How do you know this?!  This is redi....."

"We've all had experiences with our doubt!  This wouldn't just happen all at once!  It always starts out with a relatively small incident.......Maybe someone gets shot.......Maybe his family or friends take exception to that and attempt revenge.......Maybe that retaliation hits the wrong person causing a political group to think it was a hate crime which in turn causes a bit of protests which causes an extremist group to act out, leading to riots from the protesters.  Maybe the protesters get careless and injure a general in the crowd.  Maybe this causes the police and military to get involved..........This chaos would be much worse than what we've experienced the last few decades."

"This is a huge claim!"

"Come on!  We aren't monsters!  We've all wanted this man to be free, but have experienced some of these mild calamities.  There just isn't a way around it!"

"I don't know."

I hear a woman interject.....

"I came here two years ago.  I rescued him and took him to a shelter.........I got a call from my mother that my sister had been committed.......My sister has always had problems, so I figured it was a coincidence.  My sister tried to eat one of the nurses and she didn't make it, so my sister was put on trial.  She originally got a light sentence due to her mental state but was changed to the death penalty the next day.  We were all confused at the sudden change of heart, but the judge wouldn't hear it.  He said this cultish behavior has to stop they put her to death the next week.  This made my sister's case the fastest execution in modern US history.  This caused an extremist church to bomb the state house, which caused a far-left group to react and shoot the pastor of their church.  This the first time I've heard about political violence in my city, and the groups are normally on the opposite side of this issue.  my town started splitting up into factions and I began to feel like I was in an actual civil conflict.  I remembered what this group had told me and decided to give their theory a try.  I found Dave and promised him a meal at my place.  I drugged him, put him in car, and brought him back here.  The next couple days I saw both groups disband, people in the town loose interest their factionalism, and my sister's sentence was cleared as a mistrial.  My family was awarded half a million dollars for the mistake.  Maybe it was naive, but I became a believer pretty quick, and even more so once I saw what happened when the others went through similar trials."

"So, you are a part of this now?!!"

"That's part of the deal.  You make the choice than you torture him.  I torture him mentally.  He thinks I'm his lover who's also a prisoner, and every few months I make him think we're escaping only to bring him back here.  I hate it but using my energy to keep his in check is now my biggest priority."

"But......!"

The leader chimes in......

"And now you're a part of it as well!  You have seen him and, whether you like it or not, must partake in his torture!"

"........"

"Now come!  You need to take in your duty!"

He grabbed my hand and pulled me to what appeared to be an aberration made by the art department of the exorcist.  He was bloody, pale, and missing teeth.  His hair was mangy and missing clumps.  The man wasn't even shaking.  It was like he felt reserved to his fate.

"Now please!  Make the choice!  How will you torture him?  How will you utilize your negative spirit?!  We'll give you twenty minutes."

The group walks into a side door and leaves me to my decision.  I wasn't about to get inducted in this cult!  I didn't care if I were risking my life, I needed to save a human from a fate worse than death.  I grabbed the knife off the table, cut his ropes, and tried to pull him up.

"Come on!  I'm getting you out of here!"

The man could barely stand after being tied up for so long and I had to act as a crutch.   We made our way to the door I came from.  I had to be cautious as I wasn't sure if the cult had back up in the hallway I came from.  I peeked out and noticed a couple robed members at the end of the hall.  They were hard to make out in the dark, but I could see them and luckily, they were on the opposite side I came from, so I shuffled with this dude toward our exit.

I was curious as to why their security was this lax, considering the nature of their crimes.  I guess entropy really takes its toll.  We made our way in the stairwell to the main hospital where we sat for a few minutes.

"How long have you been in here?"

"I.....don't know."

He seemed listless.  I couldn't blame him.

"Are you from this area?"

"I'm not sure.  I've been here for years.  I barely remember what happened the day I was taken.  I don't have much a grasp on time anymore."

"These guys really do this to you all these years?!"

"It's been rough.......I .......It hasn't all been brutal........Sometimes I get a week off to recover, but I think that's so I can feel the pain fresher.  They pretend to be my friend than crack me a bunch than I wake back on the table."

We sat there for thirty minutes just talking about his situation and where he wants to go.  I received a text from my wife.......her mom's health took a turn for the worse.  She wasn't texting like she normally did.  She told me she might take her own life.  Just as I was about to message her, my brother texted me about how most of the houses on his block are foreclosing and his neighbors are becoming homeless.  His house is safe, but people are demanding to stay there.  He is contemplating leaving as the neighborhood is becoming chaotic.  At this point, my anxiety had gone to over-drive.  I'm not superstitious, but the coincidence was ridiculous.

"C'mon!  Let's get a move on."

I helped him up when I got a ping on my phone.  My wife tried to kill herself.  It was then that superstition took hold.......but......this guy isn't getting tortured because my family is in pain.  I couldn't do that to anyone no matter the cost.  If this thing was real, I'll just kill myself.  I took us thru the hole that led back to the main hospital when I received another text.

My brother got stabbed by his wife........This was understandable........she was stressed.  

We were walking in the hallway that led to the exit and I got a text from my wife's sister.  My wife, apparently, had a contagious blood disease that had begun to infect the hospital.  Their family was quarantined.  

"Hey wait!  There was odd security.....Lets go back this way."

I had taken the dude back to the room.  The cult was standing there waiting.

"You were quicker than most.  Most people spend, at least another twenty minutes pretending they're going to save him while they make up their mind."

"Shut up!  This is horrific!"

"We've all had to make the decision.  It cannot continue if a newcomer doesn't make the choice."

The members pull the fella up and tie him.

"Now.......You must make the next move....."

He hands me a knife.

"The first cut must be the most painful."
