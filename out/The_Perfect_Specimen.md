My Genius Friend Is Conducting Sinister Experiments

I always knew there was something a little off about Miles. Even as kids, he had this unnerving intensity, like he saw the world differently from the rest of us. While I was playing soccer and worrying about passing my math tests, Miles was tinkering with circuits and scribbling complex equations in his notebook. “I’ll change the world someday,” he’d say with that sly grin of his. Back then, I believed him.

But as I stood in front of the crumbling building that housed his so-called lab, I wished I’d never believed in him at all.

The place was decrepit, the kind of building you crossed the street to avoid. The windows were shattered or boarded up, and the single light above the steel door flickered ominously. The air smelled faintly metallic, like blood or rust. I hesitated, gripping the note Miles had sent me.

“Come see what I’ve been working on. You’ll be amazed.”

It had been years since we’d spoken, but curiosity—or maybe guilt—had driven me here. I pushed the door open, and immediately, a wave of nausea rolled over me.

The stench inside was suffocating—a mix of rot, chemicals, and something sweet and cloying that turned my stomach. The flickering fluorescent lights barely illuminated the room, but what I could see made me want to turn and run. Tables lined the walls, each one covered in a grotesque assortment of tools and...parts. Limbs, organs, and other unidentifiable things were scattered like a butcher’s leftovers. Glass jars filled with murky liquid lined the shelves, their contents bobbing and twitching as though alive.

“Miles?” I called out, my voice shaking.

“Ah, you’re here.”

His voice came from the shadows, calm and cold. Miles stepped into the light, and I barely recognized him. His face was gaunt, his cheeks hollow, and his eyes—once bright with curiosity—were dark and calculating. He wore a lab coat smeared with stains, and his hands were gloved, though the gloves were torn in places, revealing scarred, pale skin.

“Miles,” I stammered, “what...what is all this?”

He smiled, a slow, eerie grin that made my skin crawl. “This, my friend, is progress.”

I took a step back, my eyes darting to the tables. On one, something moved—a creature, barely humanoid, its body a patchwork of mismatched skin and muscle. Its chest rose and fell in shallow, labored breaths, and its eyes—milky and unfocused—rolled in its sockets.

“You’re experimenting on...on people?” I whispered, horrified.

Miles laughed, a harsh, grating sound. “People? No, not people. Not anymore. They’re prototypes. Imperfect models. But you...” He stepped closer, his gaze boring into me. “You’re perfect. The missing piece.”

“What are you talking about?” I asked, my voice rising in panic.

“You wouldn’t understand,” he said dismissively. “You’ve always been so limited. But don’t worry—I’ll show you. I’ll make you better.”

I backed away, but the room seemed to close in around me. Something brushed against my leg, and I looked down to see a grotesque creature dragging itself across the floor. Its face was a twisted mockery of humanity, and its gnarled fingers reached for me.

I kicked it away and ran for the door, but Miles moved with terrifying speed. He slammed the door shut and stood in front of it, blocking my escape.

“You shouldn’t have come here,” he said, his voice low and menacing. “You’ve seen too much.”

“Miles, please,” I begged, my voice shaking. “This isn’t you. You don’t have to do this.”

“Oh, but I do,” he said, his expression softening into something almost tender. “You don’t understand. This is bigger than you, or me, or anyone. I’m creating a new world, and you’ll be the foundation.”

Before I could respond, he pressed a button on the wall. The room filled with a low hum, and hidden panels slid open, revealing cages. My breath caught in my throat as I saw what was inside.

Creatures—dozens of them—twisted and malformed, their bodies writhing as if in agony. Some were barely recognizable as human, their limbs stretched or fused in unnatural ways. Their eyes glowed faintly in the dim light, and they all turned to look at me.

“You’re insane,” I whispered, backing away.

“Insane?” Miles repeated, laughing again. “No, my friend. I’m a visionary. And soon, you’ll understand.”

He lunged at me, and I bolted, knocking over a tray of instruments in my desperation. A scalpel skittered across the floor, and I grabbed it, holding it out in front of me like a weapon.

Miles stopped, his grin widening. “Do you really think you can stop me?”

Before I could answer, something grabbed my ankle. One of the creatures, its gnarled fingers wrapped around me, its grip impossibly strong. I screamed and kicked, but it held fast, dragging me toward one of the tables.

“Miles, stop this!” I begged, tears streaming down my face.

He loomed over me, a syringe in hand. The liquid inside glowed a sickly green, pulsing like it was alive.

“This won’t hurt,” he said, his voice almost soothing. “Not for long, anyway.”

I thrashed and screamed, but the creature pinned me down. Miles leaned in, his eyes gleaming with twisted delight as he plunged the syringe into my arm.

Pain—searing, unrelenting—shot through my veins. My vision blurred, and the last thing I saw was Miles’ face, inches from mine.

“Don’t worry,” he whispered. “You’re going to be beautiful.”

Darkness consumed me, but somewhere in the distance, I heard his voice:

“The perfect specimen...at last.”
