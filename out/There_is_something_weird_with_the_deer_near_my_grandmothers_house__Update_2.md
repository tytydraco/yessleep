Update 2 : December 17th

Okay, so it's currently been two days since my last post, and I really wish that I could say that I have more answers or at least any solid information about the deer. But I haven't been able to find anything that would explain this whole phenomenon.I have, however, been able to witness this strange deer event myself.

Last night, I decided that I *had* to go see the deer for myself, and I am not exaggerating when I say that it was an unsettling thing to see.I grabbed a flashlight, opened the back door, and took only a couple steps outside. And there they were; about three of them were huddled up against a tree in the backyard. I shined my flashlight at them, and it didn't seem to faze them at all.

I never noticed how big deer were, and being able to see them up close was a rather surreal and almost uncanny experience.I had attempted to try anything to gain their attention. I threw a small rock in their direction, and I had even started to yell at them, but all of my attempts were useless. They just stood there, and the only way I could describe the whole thing was as if you pressed pause on a movie or a video game. But, the deer themselves looked normal,there was nothing physically weird or off about them. *They just don't move.*

Besides that, the only other new information that I have is that I've been trying to find what species of deer they are. I think that finding out what type of deer they are will be my next step. Tonight, I'm planning on trying to photograph the deer. Hopefully, once I get a photo of them, I’ll upload it here, and maybe then you guys can help give me any suggestions. But so far, the only species that they seem to resemble is the white-tailed deer, which makes sense because they are Native to the area my grandmother lives in.

We both have been going back and forth all day about this whole thing. This morning she offered that if I wanted to leave early, I could, but I feel inclined to stay and attempt to figure out what could be causing these strange occurrences. I’ve also suggested to my grandmother that she should reach out to someone and get professional help from an animal behavior scientist or anyone who can possibly explain what may be going on.

I just have so many questions, but I have no clue on where to even start. I might try to talk to the surrounding neighbors and see if they have any information on this whole event. I wonder how widespread this thing even is, Is it just in the area? or are similar cases popping up throughout the whole state?But for now, I’ll try to at least gather as much information as I can and update at least every one or two days. And again, I appreciate any advice or suggestions that you guys have.
