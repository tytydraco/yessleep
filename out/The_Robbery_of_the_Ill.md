Well,you have made it to the gynecology and obstetrics clinic even before anyone!
This is your first time ever-regarding coming to the clinic WAY before all the other nursing students.You have set up your uniform nicely,badge on your pocket near your top part,pens nicely set up,notepad in your other pocket and your phone in your pants.
It is only 07:30 and you are there with your...ehhh...acquaintance Ophelia.
Ophelia seems so distant and trusting of you.
Oh would you look at that!The other students of your group came.Well that was one thing you hated for SO LONG.If only you could be alone.
Oh that would be great,wouldn't it?

It is 07:40 and all the nursing students of your group are already in the professor's lounge.
And also,you have forgotten to do something...haven't you?
Oh you little...ding ding DING!Would you look at that?The bell rang for the hospital.

You don't feel much but you excuse yourself to go to the bathroom after you are assigned a ward to go to.Well...silence.Then you hear it-BAM BAM!Screams fill the hall and you notice the door to the D&C ward breakroom open.So inviting...but...where are the other students?Just...where are they?
You have a surge of contained panic but then you hear the old anesthesiologist getting shot in the head,the anesthesia team also was shot in the head.You were really squeamish at these things but that wasn't the time for you to panic.
Or to vomit.
You did see the prison guard for the lady that was brought here kind of wounded.
Her kneecaps had bullet holes all over.
You really didn't hear what the guard said but you know that you should defend the ward.The gynecology clinic must be defended at all costs.

Well,it is 08:29 and you saw the robbers.
But you felt they never wanted to come for the money.But the vault hidden in the anesthesiology consult room was in danger.
You had to,you had to!But the armed robbers saw you.RUN MY LITTLE LAMB AND HIDE!I LOVE A GOOD CHASE!And you saw him curl his lips in a smile.Ewwwwww,you were disgusted but there is no time to vomit.You cornered one in the exit of the sterilization hall.Somehow...YOU TOPPLED A VENDING MACHINE.
That woman that said that she loved a chase...you recognized her.Like a lamb with the knife.You had your life on the line and you have to defend the ward at all cost.

The patients!YOU STUPID FEEBLE MAN!GO SEE THEM.GO!
You run to the D&C and...these robbers left them...they had...been impaled.Are these people psychos?All of these ladies are as old as their mothers.Not a single one of them left alive to see tommorow.

It is 10:21.And you have survived.Somehow.Lucky man.It is fucking carnage here.Blood is the least amount of your worries but who would do something...what did you really forget?Oh yes,sleep and dignity-the only vices you willingly gave up so that you could come to practice on time.Oh poor thing...nobody was spared.Nothing.Well you did find your fellow nursing students.Barely alive that is.You did find Ophelia,only she had a bloated face and Ecotox gas leaking out of her mouth.

It is 11:56.How are you alive,my dear nursing student?How...nevermind.You found your dearest crush of them all...Kirjana.
She had a surface slash type of stab wound and some small cuts on her neck.
Nothing serious.
But...blood kept coming out of her uterus so you took the tampons held in the OR and you put one in her.Oh dear god...what is that?How is it alive?How?You see some endometrial dysplasia and Kirjana is begging you to help her.
You did see this done in real life 800 times so you memorized it by now.

You have induced Kirjana in anesthesia mixing fentanyl and midazolam in small amounts and got to work.You have disinfected her genitalia and opened the sterile instruments and got to work.You were done and scraped off the endometrium like it seemed was necessary.

Kirjana wakes up.Groggy from the anesthesia and murmurs something.The procedure took 10 minutes.Who are you?Why did you come here?Why am I here?-said Kirjana.
I am Blagoja,I saw your medical history . Don't worry-there is nobody for me to tell this to.
You are the only one left,that I know of.
