Hi my name is Lita. I'm sixteen years old and for the last month and a half my sister Ellan has been sending me strange messages over text. The messages weren’t too strange at first, just some dark jokes here and there. I didn’t think too much about it at the time but then they started becoming more and more common in Ellan’s texts. She eventually started sending news articles about people just having horrific things done to them. I started becoming concerned since this was really out of character for her and I told her so but she just responded with 
“you need to see this to understand”

I was kinda weirded out by this response but whatever I guess. This week however the messages started to get really out of hand as Ellan started sending videos and photos people being killed in horrific ways that just looked way too real to be fake. I’m not going to go into detail about what the videos and photos showed as just thinking about it makes me sick. I asked Ellan why the hell she is sending me these photos and videos of what is basically gore and why she was looking at that stuff in the first place. You know what her response was
“I don’t know, why are you upset by this?”

What the actual hell? After that message she continued to send me more and more of these videos. I asked her to stop sending me this fucked up stuff time after time. But of course she didn’t stop. The only responses from her would 
“No”
“You need to see this so you'll understand”

I honestly started thinking she hated me or had some weird ass addiction to gore cause there was really no other reason to be doing this. Not knowing what else to do I went to my mom and told her about this. She was reasonably freaked out and tried to get a hold of my sister but she couldn’t. So she called her husband and explained the situation to him to which his response was 
“Huh that’s weird I’ll try and talk to her about it”

 At this point my mom asked me to block her as she didn’t want me seeing those videos anymore. But I couldn’t block my sister. I loved her after all and it was clear she wasn't doing alright. I convinced my mom to take me to her house so we could check on her. When we got to her house we knocked on the door but there was no response. We waited a few minutes before knocking again, still no response. Eventually my mom knocked on the door while saying
“Ellan it’s me and Lita are you home?” 

We waited a few more minutes and were about to go when the door opened and Ellan was there to greet us.
“Hi guys” Ellan said meekly while looking down, clearly avoiding eye contact with us.
“Sorry to leave you two hanging like that”
“Don’t worry about it” mom said while embracing her as tightly as possible

Ellan led us inside and we all sat down in the living room. I expected her house to be at least a little messy but it was clean. It was so clean that the place hardly looked like it’d been lived in. At the very least I expected Ellan to look a little rough but she looked fine and well put together as always.
“I think you know why we're here darling” mom said while fidgeting with her hands
“No I don’t?” Ellan responded looking genuinely confused
“The videos and photos you’ve been sending me Ellan” I blurted out 
“What videos” Ellan looked even more confused
“The videos of those awful things happening to people”
Ellan laughed when I said that
“what?” her voice darkened when she said that
Mom chimed in stopping Ellan from derailing the conversation
“Ellan we’re all very worried about you and we love you but something here isn’t right you shouldn’t looking let alone sending those videos to your sister”
“I have no idea what you’re talking about” 

Ellan looked even more puzzled than before. I pulled out my phone and went to our text conversation and showed her what she’d sent me.
“You honestly don’t know what I’m talking about” I said harsher than I meant to

Ellen’s face went pale as she scrolled through the messages 
“N-no I swear to god I didn’t send these to you, my god I wouldn’t even look at this stuff myself”
Ellan paused for a moment before continuing
“Lita I don’t know who sent you this but I swear it wasn’t me”
“What do you mean was phone number hacked or something” Mom asked with hopeful relief in her eyes
“I guess my number was hacked and I somehow didn’t know, my god i’m sorry that you had to see all that Lita if I’d only known sooner”
“Ellan it’s okay it’s not your fault” I said as a wave of relief came over me
Mom, Ellan, and I hugged it out and Ellan changed her phone number. We stayed for a little longer to make sure Ellan was alright. But while on the drive home I couldn’t help but think about the many inconsistencies in my sister’s story of being hacked. Why didn’t she hear about what was happening from her husband after my mom called him?  Wouldn’t she have gotten my messages of me asking her why she was sending me all these horrific things? And why did she not answer my mom's calls? I pushed these thoughts away as we drove home. It was all figured out after all and there was no reason to harp on it. Over the next few days everything went back to the way it was. I went to school, talked to my sister now and then and just enjoyed life. Well that was until yesterday when I checked my messages and somehow Ellan’s old phone number showed up with a new message.
“You need to see this so you can understand”
