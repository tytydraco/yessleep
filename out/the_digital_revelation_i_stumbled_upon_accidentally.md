Yesterday I was looking through r conspiracy, and this post came to my attention at first I taught yes it's just an interesting music video but what is the 08 number. Now I have a lot of time throughout the day so I got into this unimportant thing so I went to their channel and they uploaded a new video that seems to have a hidden message the number in this video is 46. it's been in my head since.  
That is not all I also find out that they have an Instagram account it's just as cryptic highlights of the profile are 80 BC which in reverse spells cb 08 remember 08 is the number from the first video so they must be connected. Nothing much else to see on Instagram they have a couple of posts u can catch themself. More importantly, when I reached the second video the fleshes seem to be a Morse code message which I guess we will have to wait for someone to translate. The name of the channel is crash codex which would be right for the level of cryptic things with them.  
we could say that in this digital age, there are a lot of secrets and revelations crash codex stands as a testament to the power of hidden messages and the will of humans to find answers. perhaps the truth is beyond our grasp and that is its message but I can't say for sure.  
But there's a shadowy undertone beneath the surface of their content. Despite their obvious desire to convey something significant, their message remains hidden, almost intentionally obscured. Like a puzzle with missing pieces, it leaves me with a sense of both intrigue and frustration, wondering if you're just scratching the surface or if there's an even deeper layer  
look how fitting the name "Crash Codex" was for its enigmatic series of events. The very title is telling to promise a journey through codes and cryptic puzzles. anticipation and unease settled within me as I saw that videos held a deeper meaning  
what could be 80 BC if we don't reverse Instagram sign 80 bc we get 80 bc which might be a massage in itself. if we take a look at what happened in 80 bc we find out that  
Sertorius invades Hispania and sets up his own regime, beginning the Sertorian War 80-72. Maues, King of the Sakas, conquers Gandhara and Taxila. as of knowledge from Google. now they don't seem to be anything special with that just war and stuff. but I do strongly believe that other numbers do have something more to tell but you see for that I can wait with you. Because as of right now 3 videos have been published and only 2 of them contain any significant massage especially the second one remember in the end it can just be something unimportant but you have the choice to make up your mind about it. that is the first thing I am shering here hope will find it interesting.
