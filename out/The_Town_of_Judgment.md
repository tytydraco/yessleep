I’m struggling to find the proper start to this story. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when everything started. Memories aren’t always linear, and I can’t help but feel like I’m piecing together a puzzle made of wrong pieces. However, this story has to be written. It has to be read. If not, I fear that all we went through will be for nothing.

  


In lieu of finding a beginning, I think it’s fair to say that this story begins at a restaurant called The Red Duck Cafe.

  


The Red Duck was a dive. It survived off of a steady stream of locals with an inclination towards alcoholism. The dusty parking lot in the front of the building was filled with rusted pickups and a collection of motorcycles.





It was an old wooden building with a sloping porch and a faded exterior. One of the front windows was broken, then fixed with nothing more than cardboard and tape. Half of the neon signs flickered unsteadily, the other half didn’t turn on at all. 

  


The only mixed drinks that were served at The Red Duck were the ones with the recipe in the title. Tap beer was two dollars at happy hour and the entire place smelt like frying oil and cigarettes. It wasn’t the kind of place I frequented, but it was where my newest client had requested, we meet at.

  


It was around seven o’clock when I found myself sitting at a table inside the bar. I waited patiently with a gin and tonic sitting in front of me. I watched the bubbles rise to the surface and pop, thinking about very little at all.

  


The bartender, an older man with a long beard, was the only other inhabitant of the bar at that time. He stood behind the bar, cleaning the classes. As always, he had a rather bored expression as if there were a million things he’d rather be doing. In the background an old Johnny Cash song played on the radio.

  


When the door opened, a tall, dark-haired man walked into the bar. He glanced around with his hands in his pockets before his eyes fell onto me. He walked up to my table without any hesitation and sat down.

  


“You must be Alvaro,” I said as I offered my hand.

  


He shook it, “call me Varo,” he replied with a half-smile. His voice was rougher than I expected from a man his age. He couldn’t have been older than thirty-five, but his voice was harsh and weathered like the voice of someone much older and rougher. 

  


“You’re Ronnie?” He asked when I failed to introduce myself. 

  


“That’s me,” I said. People were always a bit surprised when they met me, that’s what I get for choosing a boy’s name, I suppose. 

  


“Thanks for meeting with me,” Varo said as he stretched slightly. “I know it’s late, I work odd hours,” he explained. As he spoke, I noticed a strange scar across the side of his throat, it was white against his skin. I tried not to stare for too long.

  


“It’s no problem,” I said. Afterall, it was my job. 

  


After a few moments, the bartender took Varo’s order and returned with a glass of whiskey. Varo sipped the drink, hesitating to tell me what it was that he was asking me to do.

  


After a moment of waiting I said, “if you need someone found, you’re going to have to give me a little bit of information.”

  


“Right,” he nodded quickly, running his hand through his hair. He seemed nervous but I had to remind myself that not everyone is used to talking about people disappearing. Sometimes it was hard to talk about.

  


Varo finally met my eyes and asked, “you like Phoenix?”

  


I shrugged. “It’s better than a lot of places,” I said. 

  


He nodded in response and sipped his drink. At last, Varo asked, “what kind of cases do you typically work on?”

  


“Minor things mostly,” I admitted. “Cheating wives, husbands with second families, that sort of thing…sometimes I’ll work on a missing persons case, but that’s rare.” Being a private investigator was hardly as glamorous as it seemed on the big screen. 

  


Varo hesitated for a moment before saying, “have you found anyone?”

  


I nodded. “Yeah,” I said. “A couple months ago a family hired me to find their son. I found him living with a bunch of other kids at some trap house outside of town. Before that, I was hired to find a man’s wife. She was across the country, living with an ex-boyfriend.”

  


“How do you find them?”

  


“Phones, usually. They can be tracked easily, but sometimes people ditch their phones if they don’t want to be found.”

  


“Then what do you do?”

  


“If I have access to their personal computer, I might be able to narrow down the places they would go. People are pretty predictable for the most part.”

  


“What if you can’t use their computer?”

  


“I have my ways,” I said with a smile.

  


Varo didn’t return the smile.

  


“Most people have a handful of locations that they would consider disappearing to. A vacation spot or a town they lived in before. Like I said, people are predictable. And they’re messy. Usually, people slip up by paying for something with a credit card or contacting someone from their old life.”

  


“What if someone was taken?” There was an intensity to his expression that led me to believe this was no longer a hypothetical.

  


“It gets more complicated,” I said. “If there’s reason to believe that someone was abducted, usually the police get involved. Sometimes I can help, but ultimately, I’m not law enforcement and I have my own restrictions.”

  


Varo looked genuinely disappointed to hear this explanation.

  


“But it doesn’t mean that I can’t help.” I paused for a moment. “Instead of talking in hypotheticals, can you just explain what it is you want me to do?”

  


Varo let out a long sigh and scratched the back of his head, nervously. “My sister stopped responding to my calls,” he said so quietly I almost didn’t hear him.

  


“How long ago?”

  


“Two days.”

  


“Could her phone be dead?”

  


“No, she’s good with her phone. She never lets it die like that.”

  


“What about being out of cell service, she’s not camping or anything, is she?”

  


Varo gave a small smirk. “No, my sister isn’t the outdoor type.”

  


I thought. My mind spun with questions and thoughts; however, I didn't want to overwhelm him. “Did anything significant happen leading up to her…loss of contact?” I didn’t want to say ‘*disappearance’*.

  


“She got into a heated argument with my mother. She left that night, and I haven’t heard from her since.” There was a clear worry in his eyes, a look I knew all-too-well.

  


“Are you asking me to find your sister?”

  


Varo hesitated before saying, “I am.”

  


“I’ll need some information from you in order to do what I do,” I said. “Let’s start with her name, her address, and a cell phone number.”

  


I sat with Varo for a few hours at the Red Duck, learning about his sister, Luciana Delgado. She was a liberal arts student studying in Albuquerque. She had a few days off from school, so she went home to visit their mother in Las Cruces. It was shortly after that when she disappeared. 

  


I dug into Lu’s case the moment I got home. It seemed like a pretty straight forward case at first. A young college kid getting in a fight with her mother–*she’s probably at a friend's place*. If I knew then what I know now, then I would have known that I was going about this whole case wrong.

  


From what I found, Lu left Las Cruces, and eventually New Mexico as a whole. Somewhere on the other side of the Texas border, her phone had shut off. However, just before it lost signal, a singular call was made. The call had been made to a local towing company.

  


After compiling all the information I had, I scheduled a second meeting with Varo to share what I had found. Again, we met up late in the evening at The Red Duck Cafe. I walked inside to be met with the familiar smell of stale smoke and spilled beer.

  


“Why wouldn’t she have found a charger and recharged her phone by now?” He asked. Once again, we were the only two people in the bar. 

  


“I don’t know but the phone hasn’t been turned on since she called the towing company. I think it would be safe to assume that she had car problems and had to get a tow. Likely, she’s still in Judgment. It’s just a little east of the Texas border. It looks pretty remote, about an hour off the interstate, so it's possible she hasn’t been able to charge her phone.”

  


Varo gave a short, stiff nod. He looked even more uncomfortable then when I saw him before. He kept spinning his glass of untouched whiskey in a circle on the table. Dark bags were under his eyes and his dark hair was a mess, as if it hadn’t been brushed in days. 

  


“I tried calling the tow company,” I continued. “But the call didn’t go through. The line was busy both times I called.”

  


“Why the hell would Lu drive an hour off the interstate to a random town,” Varo said. “It doesn’t make sense that she would go that way.”

  


I gave a small shrug. Lots of family members failed to see the connections. “Maybe she has friends in that direction. Lots of young people go to friends’ houses after an argument with their parents. Do you know her friends?”

  


“No,” he admitted quietly. “But I think she has friends who live closer than Texas.”

  


I nodded. “I’ll call the towing company in Judgment once they open again,” I said.

  


“Thanks,” Varo ran a hand through his hair and glanced around the bar. “But I think I should just go down there myself.”

  


“Would you like someone to go with you?” I asked



 

Looking back, I have no idea why I offered that. I wasn’t friends with Varo, and I didn’t know his sister personally. Sure, he was paying me, but I was a private investigator, not a bounty hunter. I rarely traveled with clients.

  


Despite this, there was an odd draw to town of Judgment, Texas. I think I had started to feel this draw the moment I had searched its name. In the moment, however, I told myself I was being a good person–a good Samaritan–by helping Varo find his sister.

  


Upon looking into the towing company Lu had called, I found that there was little information online about Judgment. So little, in fact, that it was boarding on suspicion. Why would a town not be labeled on Google Maps?

  


“You’re willing to go all the way to Texas?” His eyes met with mine and I knew I couldn’t take back my offer.

  


“Sure,” I said. “I don’t think I would mind leaving Phoenix for a bit.”

  


Upon hearing what I offered, something in Varo’s demeanor shifted and he asked, “I’ll pay for the gas, lodging, and food, if you’d be willing to take your car.”

  


“That sounds like a deal. I’ve never been to Texas.” Or at least that was what I had thought at the time.

  


Less than twenty-four hours later, I picked up Varo from The Red Duck. He tossed a black duffle bag into my trunk and climbed into the passenger seat. He rolled down the window the second he sat down. I apologized for the lack of AC, and he waved it off, asking if he could light a cigarette.

  


I let him. I had never been a smoker myself, but I didn’t mind the smell. Something about it reminded me of a time I couldn’t remember. 

  


Varo let a cloud of blue smoke out of his mouth as I accelerated into the interstate. According to my GPS, it would take nearly eight hours to reach Lu’s last known location. Judgment was only a few minutes past that. Varo and I had already agreed to take the drive-in shifts. I would start us off, leaving Phoenix and heading south towards Tucson.

  


The radio played a rather mediocre playlist of the top 40s from the early 2000s. I wasn’t really listening to it, but the noise filled the silence between Varo and I. 

  


I didn’t know Varo well. Outside of discussing his missing sister, we hadn’t spoken much. Taking an eight-hour road trip with a stranger wasn't exactly how I planned to spend my weekend, but I was interested to know about what the tiny town of Judgment held. I hoped we would be returning with Lu by the end of the weekend. 

  


“What do you expect your sister to say when we find her?” I asked.

  


“I don’t know,” he blew out another cloud of smoke. It scattered across the dashboard like fog in a valley. “I don’t expect her to be happy with me.”

  


“It’s none of my business but what was the fight between her and your mother about?”

  


Varo shrugged. “It could have been anything. My mother is a devout Catholic, my sister is a liberal arts student.” he said.

  


I smirked. “Has she ever done something like this before?”

	



“No,” he said. “She has a good group of friends in Las Cruces from what I hear. She fights with my mother sometimes, but she never just leaves. Not like this. And not to a tiny town in Texas.”

  


I agreed it was odd. From everything he was saying, it didn’t add up. However, I had been investigating for long enough to know that one person’s perspective of something was always limited. There was likely something Varo was missing.

  


In Tucson, I gave up my position as driver in an attempt to sleep for a bit. Varo took over after we stopped at a truck stop. He got back on the interstate, lit a cigarette, and cracked open an energy drink. I gazed out my window at the dark desert skies. 

  


The mountains around Tucson couldn’t be seen in the dull light, but I was familiar enough with the area to know they were there. The interstate was illuminated in a way only an interstate could be. The lights of the cars reflected off of navigational signs and the freshly painted lines in the road. 

  


I let my eyes close as I leaned back in my seat. I thought about the map we were following and the little dot which symbolized Judgment. It wasn’t long before a strange dream met me in my sleep.

  


*I was breathing hard, harder than I ever had in my life. Tears streaked my face and my feet were bloody, but I kept running. I ran across the rough, desert ground until I found pavement. I wanted to collapse there. Everything hurt. There was so much blood, too much blood. But I had to stay awake. I had to get help. I had to tell someone–anyone–what was happening to me.*

  


*I cried in joy and relief as I saw a car barreling towards me. I waved, attempting to flag down the driver. The car didn’t stop until after it collided with my body.*

  


I woke up with a jump. Varo, who had been fumbling with his lighter, looked over at me. 

  


“Sorry,” I said, not knowing if I had been having a dream or simply a memory. It was a weird sensation.

  


“I’m going to pull off at the next gas station,” he said, ignoring my sudden jolt.

  


“Why? We just left that truck stop.”

  


“Yeah, like three hours ago. I have to piss.”

  


*Three hours*. I considered that in silence as he veered off the road and up an exit. Varo parked the car beside the building and left in a hurry. I remained seated. I didn’t have to go in and I certainly was in no mood to make small talk with any other late-night travelers.

  


Varo walked back outside, pulling the hood of his sweater up over his head. He ducked into the car and backed out. 

  


“Have you been to Texas before?” I asked. 

  


“I was born in Texas,” he said without explanation. 

  


“Really? Why’d you leave?” I asked.

  


He looked surprised by this. “My family moved,” he said simply. “There’s not much to see where we’re going. Just more desert.” He took a drink from his drink.

  


I nodded; I had assumed as much. “Do you plan on stopping? I don’t mind driving again.”

  


“I planned to stop in Las Cruces,” he said. “Is that alright?”

  


“Yeah, that’s perfect. How far are we from there?”

  


“About an hour.”

  


“Are you stopping to see your mother?”

  


“No,” he said quickly. “We’ll fill up and trade places again. I just want to make it to Judgment. I’ll get us a hotel when we arrive there.”

  


I didn’t argue. It made sense to me. Instead, I glanced out the window and began to wonder about Lu’s strange disappearance near Judgment.

  


Hours passed, eventually we made it to Las Cruces. Varo pulled into a gas station on the outskirts of town. I got out and stretched while he filled up the old car. I walked into the convenience store and bought myself a cup of coffee. The man at the counter stared at me in a way that made my stomach feel strange.

  


As I was attempting to swipe my card, he said, “don’t go mistakin’ the wolves for sheep, miss.”

  


I blinked. “Sorry, what?”

  


“Ya need to enter your pin,” he said.

  


“Oh,” I typed in my pin number, grabbed my coffee, and left. 

  


Despite the warmth of the air outside, there was something cold inside my gut. For the first time, I began to feel uneasy. I pushed those feelings aside and told myself that I was just tired, that was all. 

  


I took over for the remainder of the drive. I sipped my coffee, realizing only then how terrible it was. Beside me, Varo reclined his chair slightly and kicked his heavy boots onto the dashboard. I figured he would fall asleep like that but to my surprise his eyes remained open, focusing on the world outside the car.

  


For a while I drove in silence, assuming that Varo would eventually fall asleep. He never did.

  


“How’d you become a PI?” His voice surprised me.

  


“I went to college for criminal justice…I’ve always been interested in that kind of stuff,” I said simply. “After school I decided to pursue a career as a private investigator. Learning the truth about things has always been important to me.” I left out my reasons for this. Not everyone wanted to hear about my less-than-perfect childhood.

  


He nodded. “Did you study in Arizona?”

  


“No,” I said. “I actually lived in Denver for a while before I moved to Phoenix.”

  


“Why did you move?”

  


I hesitated before saying, “I had an…abnormal childhood. I don’t remember much of it…the doctors say it was amnesia. I moved to Denver as soon as I was old enough to leave foster care. After Denver, I found Phoenix, and I guess I’ve been there ever since.”

  


Varo said nothing for a long time. I wondered if I had over shared. Most people didn’t want to hear about foster care and childhood amnesia. It was really a bit of a mood killer.

  


“That sounds like a difficult childhood,” he said at last. I could feel his eyes on me as I drove.

  


“Yeah,” I admitted. It was weird how the night could make you admit things you would never say in the day. “I think not knowing made me want to help other people know.”

  


“So, you truly don’t remember your childhood?”

  


“Not before the age of about fifteen,” I said. “At first, they told me my memories would resurface, but at this point, it’s been too long. I don’t think I’ll ever remember who I was…where I was raised.” 

  


Typically, when I thought of the lost time, I felt very little at all. It was so long ago; I often couldn’t bring myself to grieve my memories. However, in the dim light of the car, I felt an unfamiliar pressure behind my eyes. It was as if the highway was hypnotizing me to *feel*.

  


The sun was just a spark on the eastern horizon by the time we made it to the exit for Judgment. So far, Varo was right about western Texas, there wasn’t much to see. 

  


For the most part, it looked similarly to eastern New Mexico, an expanse of rugged hills. Small brush covered the ground in many areas, providing cover for all manner of desert wildlife. In the distance, mountains guarded the horizon.

  


The exit leading off the interstate was hardly an exit at all. The mile-marker sign had been run over and there was no sign to signify any lodging or gas. I only knew where to turn off because of the GPS I had programmed with Lu’s last known coordinates.

  


I followed the directions off the interstate and onto what looked to be a county road. However, much like the exit, it was unmarked. If this was a red flag, I wouldn’t have known it at the time. I was too busy feeling an overwhelming sense of indigestion, or at least that’s what I thought it was. 

  


“I…I need to pull over,” I said suddenly as I swerved onto the shoulder of the road. Before Varo had a chance to respond. I put the car in park and practically launched myself out of my seat. 

  


I retched on the side of the road, grasping the car’s bumper for support. When I had finished, I found that Varo had gotten out of the car to check on me. He hesitated with a disgusted look on his face.

  


“What’s wrong?” He asked.

  


“I…” again, I threw up. For once I was thankful for the desolate nature of the desert. No one drove by as the contents of my stomach were emptied onto the dusty road.

  


Without a word, Varo handed me a napkin. I accepted it with a nod of thanks and cleaned myself up.

  


“I’ll drive for a little while,” he said as he walked to the driver's side and sat down. “Judgment isn’t far. Do you think you’ll be alright until we stop again?”

  


“Yeah,” I said as I collapsed into the passenger seat. “That was weird. I’ve never been sick like that from driving–it must have been the food.”

  


Gas station food didn’t exactly have the best rap. Likely, the burrito I had grabbed from our last stop had gone bad.

  


Varo pulled the car back onto the road without a word. 

  


“Sorry about that,” I said. I was embarrassed. 

  


“Don’t be,” he said. “It could be the elevation. Drink some water.”

  


The elevation didn’t seem like it would have changed much since Las Cruces. If anything, it would have made more sense for it to go down. However, I did as Varo suggested.

  


“If this town is as small as it seems, we shouldn’t have a problem finding your sister,” I said.

  


“How small did it say it was?”

  


“That’s what’s weird…it doesn’t look like there’s a town out here at all. I mean it’s not listed on Google Maps.”

  


“Then how do you know it’s here?”

  


I gave a small laugh. “Yellow pages. I looked up the number Lu had called and traced it to a towing company called Judgment Auto and Towing. They had nothing listed online other than their number. So, I ended up searching for anything with the name ‘Judgment’ from around this area, that’s when I found it listed as a town.”

  


“That’s strange,” he said. His dark eyes were glued to the distant mountain on the horizon. “It must be really small.”

  


I shrugged. “I guess. Or maybe it’s a bit of a ghost town.”

  


“It could happen. A lot of towns were built off of mining but when gold couldn’t be found, they shrank considerably.”

  


I nodded. I knew all about ghost towns. Anyone who spent any time in the southwestern United States had heard about them. It wasn’t a stretch to say that Judgment was likely dying if not nearly dead. Possibly there weren't even enough people who lived there to warrant listing it as a true town.

  


“At the very least,” I began. “It will be a place to start.” 

  


I stared at the dusty landscape and found it hard to think about a young woman willingly staying out there. What was Lu doing in a landscape like this? Would there even be a hotel to stay in?

  


I wondered about what I would find when we reached Judgment as I gazed out my window. After leaving the interstate, we had been steadily climbing in elevation. We were by no means in the mountains, but the elevation had been increasing slightly throughout the drive.

  


The road was windy, but seemingly for no reason other than to be confusing. It wasn’t long before I found myself disorientated. We were going north? South? I was typically skilled with directions, but the sky had turned a hazy shade of white and I could no longer see the sun.

  


After about a half hour of driving, I saw a giant rock formation on the horizon. It wasn’t a mountain or a mesa, but rather a large monolith-like structure that rose from the earth like a finger pointed up. It was white instead of the sandy color of the earth. I felt an odd sensation in my chest and suddenly, I was overcome with a memory.

  


*I saw the light of day, but it was just a sliver of it. On my hands and knees, I crawled toward the narrow exit of the coven. Rocks scraped my bare skin but I was determined to make it out. I had to make it out. Behind me, the cave echoed with a noise that made me sick, a dull clicking sound.*

  


*I crawled until I could pull myself out of the cave. The hole was barely large enough for me to fit through, but I managed. My palms were slick with blood as I pulled myself out of the hole in the earth and into the scorching bright light of day.*

  


*A sob overtook me as I collapsed onto the ground. I stared up at the giant monument that now towered over me.*

  


I came back to reality with a jolt, realizing that tears had been streaming down my face. The car was pulled off on the side of the road and Varo was staring at me with a strange expression.

  


“Are you alright? What happened?” He asked.

  


“I don’t know,” I said as I breathed heavily. “I had…a memory.” I stared ahead at the giant stone spire. Deep dread settled in my chest.

  


“Are you…good?” He raised an eyebrow. 

  


I must have looked like a mess. A few minutes ago, I was puking up my guts on the side of the road, now I was sobbing in the passenger seat. *Some PI I am*, I thought.

  


“Yeah,” I said. “I…I think I’ve been here before.”

  


A dark expression crossed Varo’s face. “If you want, I can turn around and drop you off at the nearest town.”

  


“No, no,” I said, coming back to reality even further. I shook off the strange sensations. “The nearest town is over an hour away. We’re so close. I…I think I might just be confused.”

  


With a bit of hesitation, Varo pulled back out onto the county road. I stared ahead.

  


“What is that thing up there?”

  


“A rock formation,” Varo said with a dismissive shrug. 

  


Despite his calm demeanor, I was drawn to his hands. They grasped the steering wheel with intensity. His tan skin looked white from the death-grip he had on the car.

  


I noticed that the road we were on was headed directly towards the monolithic stone. Varo could have been right. It could have just been a rock formation. However, I had seen Arches National Park and Monument Valley. 

  


While the giant stone ahead of us could have easily been a similar formation, there were no others around it. It was a lone rock, jutting into the skies. Its white stone looked unnatural against the dusty, tan landscape.

  


Despite the nausea in my gut and the strange memory I had, I told myself it was nothing. There was no possible way that I had been here before. This was far from where I had been found on the side of the road. I had never set foot in Texas let alone a strange desolate town called Judgment.
