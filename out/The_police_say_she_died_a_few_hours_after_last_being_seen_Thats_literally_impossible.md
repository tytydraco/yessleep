Considering that so many of you have experienced strange events, I decided it was best to post here and maybe see if anyone can help me out

Around 3 pm yesterday, my roommate Sally informed me that she was headed off to go clubbing. I think she was intending to meet someone there, as she had cleaned up in a way I haven't seen before. She ended up going dressed in dark jeans and a nice blouse, compared to the normal holed jeans and t-shirt when going to previous clubs. 

A few hours before she was to leave, I head a scream from her room

"Bad cat! Bad cat!"

When I came in the room, she was in a tank top and short pajama pants. One thing I noticed right away was her legs. Her normally thick black hair was gone, showing her pale skin. It was a look I hadn't been used to for almost two months. For the winter, she doesn't shave. After all, her legs would be covered. But because she was planning on wearing a short dress, she had saved. Unfortunately, her cat clawed up the dress. 

"Damnit, guess I'll be wearing the jeans and blouse" she sighed. 

A few hours later, she said goodbye and went out the door.

That is the last time I saw her alive.

20 minutes later, I went to bed, and when I woke up in the morning, I went to check on her. But she wasn't home.

She had texted me once, an hour after I went to sleep. 

“Snow”

I wasn’t sure what to make of it. Yes, it had snowed last night. But what does that have to do with anything? She hadn’t given me any context. I checked to see if she had left a voice message or even tried ti call me, but there was nothing. 
 
I called her phone, but there was no response. After hanging up, her mother called me. "Do you know where Sally is? We were supposed to meet for brunch." I told her that she wasn't home, and I was also looking for her. 

We ended up calling the police, and within a few hours she was officially declared a missing person. 

I was part of the search party which found her. Me, a police officer; and a search dog were walking a few miles off a popular trail in the woods when we found her body. 

“Come, quick!” He shouted. The dog sniffed her, and then ran a few meters away from us before stoping. He pointed his heat to distance, like he wanted us to come with him. 

But before I could come over, another party reached us. That parties officer took the dog by the leash and walked him away. 

I won't describe the details, but there is something I must note: the bottom of her pants had been torn; and so I saw her legs: they were covered in thick black hair.

How is this possible? 

Less than 48 hours ago, her legs were freshly shaven. Should I tell someone? I haven’t said anything yet because I worry people might think I’m lying or crazy.
