Question: If the love of your life were dead, how far would you go to see them again? Break the law? Sacrifice yourself? Kill? Most of you, I’m sure, would do at least two of the above.

I didn’t believe in ghosts, an afterlife, or any of that until Emma came into he ER that night. The words that hissed from her mouth, “I can help you talk to Hannah again,” bounced around my skull as I sat behind my steering wheel, frozen, trying to decide what to do next.

And those words are what pushed me to go back inside the ER and talk to her. 

I walked back in and, after a few moments, noticed a faint humming. Amid the noise and movement, someone was humming *Frère Jacques*. I looked around, but no one was facing me. Still, the tune lingered in the air, faint and off-key, like a broken music box playing in my head.

Out of context this specific song might not mean anything to you but it’s the song that Hannah’s dad used to sing to her when she was a baby. 

I kept on toward Emma’s room. The closer I got, the louder the humming grew, needling into my skull.

I turned the corner into her room and Emma’s eyes met mine. She sat upright,  perfectly still, her gaze fixed one me. “Ryan’s planning on burning the jacket. He’s buying lighter fluid right now,”.

“How do you know that?” I asked.

My phone rang, no number, no name, a blank screen. but it was ringing. 

“Answer it,” Emma instructed.

I picked up, and Emma’s voice came through the line. She was talking to Ryan. I don’t know how, it was her voice, her words—but she was still sitting there in front of me, staring, her mouth perfectly still.

I shouted into the phone, demanding Ryan tell me where he was. “He can’t hear you,” she said as their conversation continued through the phone. “Be quiet and listen,” she said. 

“Drop the lighter fluid,” I heard her say to Ryan. 

“Why should I listen to you?” He pushed back.

A deep, uneven laugh crawled through the speaker. The tone of Emma’s voice shifted, older now, rougher, like someone else had taken hold of her throat. “If you burn the jacket” An Old Man’s voice said “Emma burns.” 

Ryan went quiet, I could only hear him faintly breathing on the other end. “Who are you?” he said weakly. Then the phone cut out.

“He won’t try and burn it now,” Emma said. Emma said. She smiled, and her face folded strangely, as if someone else were wearing a mask of her.

I stood there, a dozen questions lodged in my throat. I asked anyway. One: Where is the jacket from? Two: What do you mean I’ll talk to Hannah again?

“It’s from a thrift store,” Emma said “Hidden Gems. Not far from here.” 

Then she leaned forward, the restraints binding her to the bed taut, catching her against her own weight. “Put the jacket on, don’t fight it,” she rasped, “and you’ll see her again.” She stayed in place, her stare pinned me where I stood. 

The sterile white lights above flickered wildly. The heart monitor crackled and screamed static. In between the burst of lights I saw Emma changing. 

One moment, Emma. The next, an Old Man. His skin looked wet, riddled with gooey open sores. Folds of flesh hung loose on his face, like a snake shedding its skin. She was switching back and forth with every flicker of the lights until it stopped and the room went dark.

There was a few seconds of silence, then I realized someone was right next to me, breathing in my ear. Their hot breath brushing my face. I jumped and the lights came back on. Emma was in the bed, her restraints still on. I knew what I had to do.

—

The overhead bell stretched through the impossibly quiet thrift store when I stepped inside. No one in sight. “Hello?” I called out. 

I took a few more steps in. Whispering drifted through the air. I froze, scanning the aisles. The words were too soft to catch, slipping through like wind between walls. “Hello?” I called again. 

Someone was watching me. I could feel it. I turned slowly, checking every direction. No one.

I heard another whisper. Someone was in here with me. I could feel them, even if I couldn’t see them.

I continued on. The scent of stale mildew and old clothes hung in the air. I stopped when I noticed a tag hanging from a pair of shoes. Written in black sharpie on the tag: “William: 10/21/21”. 

Right then something moved on the clothing rack across from me. I caught a glimpse of what looked like a shadow between the clothes.

“Can I help you?” I jumped and spun around. A lady stood behind the front counter where no one had been moments before. It was odd, unsettling, but she was smiling at me and looked pleasant enough.

I needed answers, so I came up with the best story I could. I told her Emma had been in recently, that she’d gone to the hospital because something on a jacket had made her sick.

“Oh,” she said. She asked me my name and introduced herself as Agatha. 

“Do you remember selling it?” I asked. 

“A jacket made her sick?” She said skeptically. 

“Yes,” I said. Holding her gaze.

She reached for a long overcoat hanging nearby and walked toward me. “That sounds pretty unbelievable, if you ask me.” Before I could respond, she draped the heavy coat over my shoulders. “Feel sick yet?” she teased.

I felt crazy—but I knew I wasn’t. I knew what I’d seen.

Then the coat tightened. A faint vibration rippled across my chest. Agatha’s expression changed. Her lip curled, exposing brown rotting teeth, something I hadn’t noticed before.

The thrift store lights dimmed, their steady hum slipping into a low, pulsing rhythm, like a heartbeat echoing through the walls. 

The coat constricted, clinging tighter, as if it were alive. My skin began to burn, as though sandpaper were grinding against it. I screamed for help, but Agatha didn’t move. She just watched.

I blinked and the store was gone. 

In its place: a narrow hallway, walls yellowed and peeling. I had been transported somewhere, somehow. 

I immediately heard faint cries nearby. I started toward the sound. I thought to myself, *I should stop*. But my legs wouldn’t obey. My mind screamed to stop, but my body moved on. It was as though my body and mind were disconnected. I was like a puppet on a string.

As I passed a mirror, I caught my reflection. My stomach dropped.

It wasn’t my reflection looking back at me, but a man I didn’t recognize. The only familiar thing was the overcoat Agatha had placed on my shoulders. 

I continued on against my own will,  turned the corner where the cries were coming from and froze.

A man was standing over a woman, his hands clenched around a butchers knife. He brought it down again and again into her chest, the sound dull and wet, like a shovel striking mud.

I wanted to scream, to run, but I couldn’t. My feet were rooted to the spot.

Then the man stopped and lifted his head. No face. Just smooth featureless skin where features should have been, like someone had erased them. Even without eyes, I could feel him staring at me.

I stumbled back, trying to get away. But before I could, he was on me. The knife swung upward, driving into my jaw. A rush of heat and pain flooded through me.

The lights flickered and I was suddenly back in the thrift store, trembling on the ground as I ripped the overcoat off. My skin stung as I yanked it away from my body.

Agatha stared down at me. “So the jacket made her sick?” she mocked. 

I frantically felt my jaw, searching for the wound. 

“That death wasn’t yours,” Agatha said. She picked the overcoat off the ground and read aloud. “It was Michael’s.” She turned the tag around for me to see: “Michael: 06/21/71”

“What was that? What’s happening?” I demanded.

“Thank God you got it off in time, otherwise it would’ve bound itself to you,” Agatha said. 

A fierce burn ran across my chest. I lifted up my shirt and my skin was scarped raw in several places.

“These clothes need a new home. I’m here to facilitate a way for them to live on.” She continued, “None of them are priced. They're tagged with names and dates. Just as Emma’s jacket was.” A chill washed over me. 

“Why is this happening?” I asked. 

“Because it does,” she said simply. “It doesn’t have to involve you. But I think you want it to.”

Maybe I didn’t need Emma’s jacket, maybe I just needed Agatha. “Can you help me see Hannah again?”

“No,” she said. 

“But the Old Man told me he could,” I said.  

“Well then that’s the deal he made with you. I don’t make the decisions, I balance the books.”

Her eyes stayed fixed on me, like she was staring into my very being. I felt her inside my head, wading through my thoughts like cold water rushing into my skull.

“If you want to know who’s responsible for her death, he can show you that too.”

It’s hard for me to talk about this. But I should. It’s what led me here. Hannah was killed in a hit-and-run. She went for a jog and never came back. They never found the car. Whoever did it got away with murder. This could be my chance to find them.

That’s when my phone rang. No number, no name, but it was ringing. I answered and *Frère Jacques* hummed faintly on the other end. “Ryan’s at home now,” The Old Man’s craggy voice whispered. He gave me the address. “Go. Before it’s too late.”

And I did. 

I can’t tell you the rest of what happened. Not here. But what I can say is that none of this is my fault. It was self defense. And everything I’ve done, everything I’m going to do, is for Hannah. 

What I will tell you is this: I have the jacket now.
