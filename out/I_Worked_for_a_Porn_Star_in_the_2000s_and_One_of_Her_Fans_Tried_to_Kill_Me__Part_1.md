Porn is the only thing where if you do it one time you’re called a “star.” 

Roxi D’Angelo was in fact a porn star and by about a million different strokes of luck, good and bad, she and I were close in 2008, the year she died. 

We met at a strip club in Fort Lauderdale. I moved there right after college because it was the only place I could get a job - working for a company which sold yachts cheap and as fast as they could. They seemed to know The Great Recession was coming. 

I knew no one in the state of Florida. I passed my sad, lonely nights in the many strip clubs of Fort Laudy.

I recognized Roxi the second I saw her. She had just performed in a scene on one of the “reality porn” sites that dominated the 2000s. I asked her for a private dance.

She was flattered and surprised I recognized her. She then immediately said I “looked like I knew how the internet worked.” Based on how surprised she was when a guy recognized her from the world’s most-popular porn site at that time, I had a feeling she did not really know how the internet worked. 

That’s how it all started. I kept coming back for dances and her star kept ascending despite her always referring to herself as an underdog.

Well, the underdog thing was somewhat true. Roxi didn’t look like a stereotypical pornstar. She had dark hair, short, small breasts, and a chubby face. She also had the greatest butt most people had ever seen in 2008, even on the internet. 

One of the little moments where I won over Roxi was explaining ass was like ribeye steak - no one realized it was secretly the best cut until 2005, and now its popularity, and price, were skyrocketing. 

Roxi made me a deal - she would give me free lapdances and a small percentage of the cash of her website subscriptions if I could run her Myspace page and answer her fan club email. She was legitimately becoming a star, and couldn’t manage it on her own anymore. 

The job wasn’t as interesting or as gross as you would assume. Most of the guys who emailed her were just lonely and wanted to talk. Yes, plenty of psycho pervs, but it wasn’t the majority and those were just a simple delete.

It was when Roxi got Twitter that everything started. Within an hour of starting the account, another account RockyDennisNephew immediately started to flame Roxi’s account. The messages were simple and straightforward though. 

Roxi needed to respond to his email. Immediately. Check her junk box. His emails always showed up there. 

Roxi’s junk box was indeed full of Rocky’s emails. Every day.It was like Jack Torrance in The Shining. 

*Roxi - I believe in fate. I had a vision of you before I saw you. I saw a life that has us together where we will find the success you have always dreamed of. I’m rich. I’m fit. I’m charming. I can give you a different life. A better life. No more doing what you’re doing. You’ll just be doing that for me ;).* 

*When you are ready, I’ll be waiting. I can wait forever.* 

*xoxo*

*Benjamin*

I shrugged it off. This psycho simp bullshit wasn’t nearly as unique as *Benjamin* thought it was. I deleted all of his messages in the junk file. I deleted them when they came in the next day. And the day after that. 

I didn’t think about Rocky until a few months later when he tweeted at Roxi’s account just with just the words “I see you.”

My blood ran cold. For a second I thought he was talking about me, but then it clicked. Roxi had gone out to Las Vegas for her first big porn industry appearance. Some award show. 

I called her. She didn’t answer. She never answered. I texted. Emailed. *Nothing*. 

She eventually replied a couple days later. She sent me a text. She was fine. 

She called me that week. She was back in Miami. She needed to check something on the Myspace account herself, but she was locked out and didn’t know what to do. 

I went to Roxi’s place. Modest duplex. By the airport. Reminded me of the places I rented in college with friends. 

She let me in. She was fucked up. This wasn’t out of the ordinary. It shouldn’t be hard to believe a girl in porn had a drug problem. 

Her computer was on the living room coffee table. She retreated to her bedroom and closed the door. I knew the drill. 

I got to work on her computer. I was immediately thrown off. Her social media profiles weren’t on the screen - it was a folder, open with endless large thumbnails taken inside her condo. 

The pictures were creepy. They were poorly lit. Taken with a shitty camera. They were all of Roxi in various states of undress, with cuts all over her body - blood hot and red all over the screen. 

The images kept getting more and more intense and bloody and dark and another figure started to appear in them. A man wearing a gray and white rabbit mask, holding a knife. 

I recognized the mask. It was exactly the same one which was in Roxi’s first scene. It was some stupid shit around Easter so she had dressed up like a rabbit for about 45 seconds before things got going. 

It was a man in the rabbit mask in these photos, and he was cutting Roxi, and he was tying her up with zip ties. 

Obviously the images were disturbing, but I figured they were for some kind of fetish thing. Until I noticed the date and time on them - they were from just a few minutes before I arrived. 

Then I saw him for the first time in the reflection of the blackness of one of the photos on the screen - he was standing behind me - wearing the same rabbit mask, same knife in hand. 

I stood up and turned to look at the figure. It was a man. He was tall. He was strong. He had dark eyes inside that mask. 

“So are you the one who hasn’t been responding to my emails?” He asked.

I didn’t know how to respond to that. I didn’t have much time anyway. 

“Turn around. Put your hands behind your back,” he instructed. 

I looked at the knife in his hands. I could tell he wasn’t afraid of using it. I obeyed. I wanted him to feel in control. I’d go along to start and figure it out from there. 

I heard and felt him walk up behind me. The zip ties snatched my hands together. 

He pulled me back and held me close to him. It was the strongest grasp I had ever felt. 

“I’m in control,” he whispered into my ear.

\-

He was in control. He sat me down in a chair in the corner of the living room and started setting up video equipment - a large tripod and camera aimed at the heart of the room. 

I just sat there and watched him move methodically and meticulously, all while wearing that stupid rabbit mask. It would have looked funny and stupid had I not been scared out of my mind. 

My mind raced. Trying to think of a way to get out of the situation. I also tried to think about what Roxi was doing. She had went back into her bedroom when I came in. She was probably just in there zonked out, maybe not even knowing what planet she was on and what was happening. Maybe she thought this was a shoot or something and didn’t realize how dangerous this guy was. 

None of it was good though. That I could feel. 

I developed a strategy, quickly. I wasn’t going to try and plead with him. That never worked. I was going to be his friend. 

“Hey Benjamin,” I started in, stopping him in his tracks, I think he didn’t realize he had signed off on his email with his real name, at least once. 

Just that one word - his name seemed to catch Benjamin’s attention. 

“I saw in your messages, you use a lot of quotes from sci-fi movies in your emails, and saw some stuff on your Twitter,” I started in on Benjamin. 

I could tell he was listening. I was underneath his skin. He kept setting up whatever kind of camera thing he was doing, but he took in what I said, and started responding. 

“Do you like hypotheticals?” I asked Benjamin as I watched him open up a case which was filled with varying lengths of knives. 

Just the sight of that made my voice crack and stopped me from talking anymore for a few seconds, but I was eventually able to keep going. 

“Would you rather fuck a woman that looked like Alien or Predator?” I asked, drawing a little laugh out of Benjamin. 

Benjamin didn’t answer, but I felt like I had earned some admiration from him. At least that’s what I hoped. 

He walked back up to me and dropped down so we were face-to-face - his eyes tiny and dark through the holes in that mask. 

“You’re going to do what you’ve always wanted to do. Thank me later,” Benjamin said right in my face. 

I didn’t like the way that sounded at all. I didn’t like that Benjamin walked out of the room and into Roxi’s room right after that.   


The image of Benjamin carrying Roxi’s body out of her bedroom will forever be sealed into my brand like a horrific cattle brand. She was naked now, bloody, and loose, just hanging from his arms. 

I looked away as he carried her into the heart of the room. My stomach begging me to throw up, but fighting it back. Somewhere deep inside of me at that point I knew I needed to start being strong and to start fighting, even though I was horrified, and maybe worse, heartbroken. 

Benjamin stopped right in front of me and set Roxi’s body down on the coffee table, her face right in my line of sight. I started to break down and cry. 

I got close with Roxi. She wasn’t just some pornstar fantasy to me the way she was to Benjamin and the world of internet men at large. 

Roxi and I shared a lot of drunken nights. I’d come to her place, help her with her online stuff, we’d drink all the way through and have these endless conversations about life. Mostly her’s. 

I wish I could tell you Roxi’s story and how she ended up being who she became, but I can’t truthfully, because I got so many different versions. Roxi’s backstory changed at least four different times. 

The path that led her there wasn’t important. My guess was it was pretty predictable from what I could glean from what showed up most-consistently in her stories - missing dad, drugs, foster care, sexual abuse. What mattered most was Roxi was funny, she was quick, she was genuine, and down to earth. Surprisingly a tomboy, who was an all-leaguesoftball pitcher before she dropped out of high school. 

Now she was nothing but a dead piece of meat laying in front of an incel psychopath and I had a feeling where said incel psychopath wanted to take this all. I was going to do my best not to do it. 

“Another hypothetical?” I asked as I forced myself to look away from Roxi. 

Benjamin let out a deep breath, but he didn’t say no, which gave me some hope. 

“Next year’s Super Bowl halftime show…

“I don’t like football,” Benjamin spat back. 

“*Halftime show*.”

Benjamin exhaled and started paying attention to Roxi’s body. 

“So…next year’s Super Bowl halftime show is either you masturbating to completion, or taking a shit, to completion. Which do you pick?” I asked, somehow getting my voice to be a little playful. 

Benjamin laughed a little bit as he took out a make up kit and turned his attention to Roxi. I could only look for a second and don’t even need to describe what he started doing. 

“Take a shit, just take a bunch of laxatives and knock it out,” Benjamin answered while working. 

“Yeah, but if you pick that, people are gonna think you have a small or weird dick,” I rebutted. “Like if you have a good dick, this is the chance for the whole world to see your dick.”

Benjamin stopped what he was doing abruptly. 

“Are you saying I have a weird dick?” Benjamin said and moved his gaze to me like a hungry snake. 

“No. No. No,” I backtracked. 

Benjamin was back staring into my eyes. He gave me a cold look for a good 10 seconds, silent. 

Then he broke out with a little laugh. He slapped me on the shoulder like a teammate. 

“I’m fucking with you, man,” Benjamin said with more awkward laughter. 

Then he turned his attention to my arms, still zip-tied behind my back. 

Then he yanked me over to the coffee table where Roxi’s body was. He held me up there above her, forced me to look down at her bloodied and dead face - still and haunting. 

“Are you ready?” Benjamin whispered into my ear. 

I was not ready. I didn’t have a choice though. Benjamin took off the zip tie on my wrist and dropped my hands down onto Roxi’s. 

“Isn’t this what you’ve always wanted?” Benjamin went on. 

Not necessarily, but I didn’t say that. All I wanted was to change some of the decisions I made on my path that led me to being where I was at that moment. 

The rabbit mask came around from the side. Benjamin was sticking it right in my face. 

“I want you to re-enact that first time,” Benjamin whispered deep into my ear, his hard teeth scraping the soft cartilage of my ear. 

“Why don’t you want to?” I asked back. 

“I. Want. To. Watch,” Benjamin gave his final answer. 

I was ready to die at that point. I came to terms with it. I wasn’t going to do the awful awful thing Benjamin wanted me to do.

*Then I felt Roxi’s hand squeeze mine.*
