Just a heads up, this is a long read. For a bit of context, I'm a high schooler, obviously. I won't mention my school's name at any point during this information dump, as I don't want people looking into things. But after what I've been through, I simply couldn't bear to keep quiet. The thought of it's driving me insane.



Picture this: first quarter of of 11th Grade. I'm not exactly a fan of school, mainly because of the fact that I have to be around people my age (you know how kids are nowadays). But I got through it for the most part. Like many, I had quite a few teachers, some more likeable than most. A handful of them were very constructive, and I feel that I benefited from them. Some less so. I sure as hell know my math teacher was the latter. I mean, I would be pissed all the time, too, if I taught geometry at nine in the morning. For the most part, the year was shaping up to be a good one. To be honest, I still kind of felt like I was being thrown around in high school, what with the 'fend for yourself' kind of vibe. You're older, mature, you can do stuff on your own, that sort of thing. I missed middle school. Still do. Even if it's the prelude to your supposed 'golden years' of school, and is nothing compared to what's to come, I had a lot more friends back then. And, y'know, subjects were actually possible, I suppose. That was cool, too.



I'm probably getting off-track. Pouring my personal thoughts on school agenda wasn't what prompted me to write this, so let me digress. Just gives you a little bit of insight as to what kind of guy I am. Not too keen on people, blah blah.



Anyway, first week of school went great. A majority of my classmates got along, and I made a friend or two. I believe this is a point of chronological key interest because our principal spoke at orientation, albeit briefly. He was always fun, and I admired him since my freshman year when I met him. He's the kind of guy to find humor in basically every situation, and no matter how you conversed with him, he'd always find a way to make it an uplifting learning experience. If anything, he should've been one of my teachers... sigh. I don't want to call him by his real name, so let's say his name was Mr. Rutledge.



So, jump to second month of school. I get the gist of things, I familiarize myself with the academic material, and life felt like it always had. Normal. Hectic, but normal.

God, I wish the same could've been said for this one group of kids. Out of everyone in my school, they were the one friend group no one knew much about. They were secretive, always moving somewhere else if there was a bunch of students around (can relate), and hardly talked to anyone that wasn't in their little posse. If you could even call it that. I mean, they vaped, had a tattoo or two; you can infer what they were like. I'm also ninety percent sure they stole from people, according to witnesses. And not, like, money, or valuables. The WEIRDEST stuff you could think of. Expo markers, thumbtacks... hair? Needless to say, I think I'd rather run into a wanted fugitive over them. These guys were major league weirdos.



I'm walking down the hall one day, fifth period. It was a relatively easy school day. I had little 'power chats', as I like to call them, with my friends between classes. Wish I could say their actual names, so I'll call them by our fun little nicknames. My best friend, Iron Eye (he got a black eye from a baseball, became a whole inside joke. It was funny. Sometimes I carried a baseball in my bag and pretended like I was gonna throw it at him), Ridge, and Jared. No, that wasn't his actual name, we straight up just called him that. 

My friends walk off to the next class. I like to daydream. A lot. So, I'm standing there, staring thinking about something. I don't exactly remember what it was, but when I snapped out of it, one of the girls from Weirdo Squadron was right next to me, mere inches from my face. I could feel her breath on the tip of my snout, which caused me to accidentally scratch her face with a fingernail. Apparently I thought that there was a bug on my nose, or something of the sort, which led to my use of insect self defense. (I hate bugs, always have. It's a phobia I've had since I was little.) She yelps, cusses at me, and storms off. I never figured out what she wanted. Maybe she was doing a routine weirdness check for all I know.

I get through the rest of the day like normal. I wanted to reach out and apologize, going as far as to stay at school a bit later than intended. This girl was nowhere to be found. Oddly enough, I never saw the weirdo kids, either. Word must've gotten out that I was out for blood. Or insects.



The next day, I finally spot the girl and her group at lunch. They were sitting in the very corner of the cafeteria, their backs up against the wall as they ate and talked. I make my way over, and as they catch sight of me, I feel my confidence fading. "Hey," I said, "Sorry for what happened yesterday, you kinda spooked me."

"Sure, whatever," she says, "Never knew why they let mutts like you into schools in the first place." Um, okay, racist. Way to ruin our first verbal interaction all year.



Now, for further context - I'll keep it brief, I swear - we're one of those all-inclusive schools where just about anyone can apply if they have a clean track record. In spite of this, I was one of three animal-folk students at the school, the other two being a pair of seniors. All I knew is that they were brothers, both canids, like me. Golden retrievers, I think. I only ever got to talk to them once. Typical 'hey, hi' conversation.



I felt my jaw tighten out of anger as I stared at this \*bitch\* and all her friends. They looked like street rats, honestly. Their faces were unkempt, even for teenagers. They wouldn't be caught dead wearing anything normal. 



"Excuse you, but that wasn't nice. I'm here to apologize, and you're just gonna insult me? Sounds to me like I should've stayed a stranger." I scoffed, a scowl probably visible on my face. As soon as I said that, this big guy roughly twice my size and muscle mass stands up, gets his chest right in my face, and, for whatever reason, strikes an elaborate pose. Y'know, like the dudes in that one anime. I'm not sure if he was trying to be intimidating or not, but it sure as hell worked. For reference, I'm the shortest male in my school (fox genes 'n stuff. 5'1, thanks, dad). I felt my ears pin against my head, my tail between my legs. Honestly, I'm not ashamed to admit I was genuinely afraid of him. He was about the most normal-looking guy in the group, and that's saying something. If you saw this guy, you'd have probably thought he was a gym bro. He was abnormally built for a guy his age. Then again, he might've been held back, so I can't say for certain.



The rest of that day was absolute shit. My friends ask me what could've happened to make me act so pitifully like that. I grumble, shrugging it off with a lie by saying that we had come to terms with our differences. I still hadn't gotten over it, but I slapped on a reassuring smile and called it a day.

Just before history class, I go to get my textbooks from my locker. Upon revealing its contents I was so familiar with, there was \*nothing\* there. Okay, so we're dealing with theft now. Cool. I later had to explain to Mrs. Andsted that I had lost my textbooks, and, after a brief scolding, she lets me borrow one of hers for the class.



As I was trying to wrap my head around the who, how, and why, I bump into weirdo bitch again. She has a dead serious look on her face, doesn't say a word. Just stares.

"Hey!" I exclaim, "Did you steal from my locker? Dude, I need those." Apparently she's amused by my dilemma, replying with a cryptic, "They vanished? How quaint. I hope you find them, lest (intelligible) finds you." I have literally no idea what she said towards the end. If I don't hear something right, chances are no one else can. My big-ass ears can attest to that. Someone talking behind my back? I hear that shit. I can't hear a pin drop per se, but I have significantly better senses than a human does. I'm convinced she was speaking gibberish. These kids had to be sick in the head, dude.



I can't exactly cover every single thing that happened in detail, so here are some major things that occurred that week:

\- Mr. Rutledge didn't come into work on Tuesday. Starting the 12th of November, no one reports of seeing him since. Can't contact him. His colleague fills in for him. School doesn't give a shit. I did.

\- Another kid's locker was reportedly broken into/vandalized, same thing that happened to me. I talked to him later that day, said he found a note in his locker. Oh, \*he\* gets something, but I don't even get an explanation.

\- On Thursday, in the middle of the day, something on campus explodes. What they found in the parking lot were singed papers and books. MY stuff. All my notes, supplies, everything, gone. Weirdo bitch, probably. They also found peculiar symbols drawn on the sidewalk in red chalk. Like, something you'd find in a history museum. Dumbass wannabe gangsters.

They eventually found out who was trashing the lockers. What I didn't expect was that none of the weirdos were involved, at least, to my knowledge; the culprit was a kid from my chemistry class. He gets two weeks suspension, and he had to pay for the property damages. He was always a fun guy. Why he of all people would mess with us like that was beyond me. I never saw him again, and he never came back to school.



Another two weeks later. Staff has yet to find and/or get in touch with Mr. Rutledge. They decide to report his disappearance to the police, because Mr. Rutledge was always open and honest. If he were to have left town, he'd have let the faculty know. And then he'd probably post about the trip on Facebook, talking about how great of a time his family was having. Fall Break was already over.

I didn't find out much past that, likely because they wanted to keep the situation under wraps. I'd ask about Mr. Rutledge every now and then, but my teachers' guesses were as good as mine. My friends were starting to get worried, too. The school just didn't feel the same way, even if his colleague had similar experience.

Well, we get through the school week. They don't find Mr. Rutledge. I celebrate my birthday that month with friends (I turned eighteen). It's the holidays, we have a sleepover at my house. We ended up watching a Star Wars movie, we talked. I don't particularly enjoy big celebrations. Didn't even bother for a cake this year.



The next day, I get a call from Ridge. She's sobbing uncontrollably, something I'd never known her to do. It sounded horrifyingly genuine. "Ridge, what's wrong?" I ask, stuttering a bit. It was about nine-thirty in the evening.

"I-It's Jared! He's dead! They-" she sniffles, "They found him in his room... his arms were gone, his throat was cut."

I nearly dropped my phone. As I slid off my bed, I stumbled a bit trying to move around. "Wh- what're you talking about?" I scoff.

"I-I don't know, but... okay, so I went to Jared's house to talk with him for a little while. His grandmother recently passed away, and h-he's been a little unmotivated lately. When I found him, he w-was lying in a pool of blood on the carpet. I..." By this point, Ridge was in hysterics, and it was clear I had to go over there to see things for myself. Concealing my panicked state, I tell my mom I'm gonna drop in with Jared. Not a school night, so she doesn't care too much.



I ran a few blocks before my asthma kicked in. I'm a great runner, I swear. I only feel like I'm dying after about three to four-hundred yards. By the time I reached Jared's house, the paramedics and a few police cruisers were parked outside. I had to pinch myself to know I wasn't having some foul nightmare. I crossed the street and walked over to Ridge, putting an arm around her. She flinched, but calmed down at the sight of me. "I'm sorry," I said solemnly. She said nothing, responding with a hug. We meet up with Jared's parents, feeling just as distraught as they were.

After talking about it with my mother over the phone, I walk home. It was pitch black outside, and foggy, even for an autumn night. I felt queasy. I'd known Jared since 5th Grade, and my world felt anything but normal now. I told myself that it truly, truly couldn't get any worse than this. This was a new low in my life.

And knowing my luck, it was all downhill from here. On the way back, I saw two figures walking in a similar direction. Just by their clothing, I recognized them. Weirdo kids. I could've sworn there was a third person walking beside them at some point, but it was too dark to ascertain. The city had yet to fix some of the street lamps in our neighborhood.



In my state of mixed emotions, I decided to follow them. I'd never seen them in my neighborhood before, so they must've lived across town somewhere. It made it all the more strange as to why they'd be here. I carefully trailed several feet behind them, staying out of their line of sight. I could overhear them talking about 'what they did with the pissbaby from yesterday'. Said they'd stashed them with the others. Now, I knew these guys were outlandish delinquents, but I didn't take them for criminals. Yet, with a feeling that they were responsible for what's been going on, I could do anything but turn back.



I followed them for a while, noting that they looked back every so often. My mom was blowing up my phone with texts wondering why I wasn't back yet, so I had to put my phone on silent. It was a quarter 'til eleven. I was convinced I was lost at this point, but all I could do now was stealthily follow. So I did. They turned down one more street, basically a dead end. I waited a while before coming after them, creeping around fences and trees. Now, at a first glance, this was just a normal cove; two houses, a car parked at the curb. I was in a part of town I'd never seen before. I lost sight of the weirdo kids, and everything was telling me to give up now. But I just knew something was up. I've always minded my own business, but this had gone too far. I was too perplexed and infuriated to care about anything else at the time.

I got to the end of the street and approached the fenceline that bordered a forest, basically. After a lengthy inspection, I descried a small opening carved from the base of the fence. It was pretty rudimentary, but even I hadn't noticed it, the way it was tucked away at the side. I was probably trespassing at this point, but I didn't give a shit. It looked big enough for an average person to crawl through, so I did.



The \*very\* moment I made my way towards the other side, I picked up an odoriferous smell. The scent was foreign, pungent. The only way I could describe it was that it smelled like a mixture of mildew, curdled milk, and probably a decomposing animal's remains. I had to stop and steel myself before pressing on into the wooded area. A fact about me that my friends know all too well is that I am not good with direction. You could probably list three methods of getting somewhere not even half a mile away, and I'd still end up taking a wrong turn. It's most likely why I suck at geography.



I walk around the woods for close to ten minutes when I spot a wooden structure up ahead. This hut looked decades old, having a dilapidated foundation, ruined shingles, and probably an infestation. I wanted to turn back so badly, but there was no way I could. With whatever courage I could muster, I slowly made my way over, trembling with each step I took. Opening the door revealed a small, cabin-like room that could've fit a single bed at most. Nestled between the back wall and the floor lie a cellar entrance. I narrowed my eyes, confused as much as the next guy.



Okay, I typically don't use such coarse language, but if I'd never had a 'the fuck' moment, it was now. First of all, I've seen way too many horror films to know where this was going (thanks, Iron Eye), but if these kids were to have gone anywhere, it was down there. Now, we don't have a basement, or anything of the sort. In fact, I've never in my life had to go down into even a storm shelter. Guess there's always an opportunity to try something new.



I ever so slowly stepped into the hut, squatting down to open one of the cellar doors. That's when I started to hear voices coming from down there. The smell got even stronger, if that was possible, and I began to feel an otherworldly presence. Ever heard of Pandora's Box? This might as well have been something like that. The people down there, who's voices I could coherently recognize, were chanting in what sounded like another language. One of them sneezed, and they stopped to say in English, "Bless you," before resuming. I felt inclined to investigate further. Peeking my head down into the cellar, I managed to see about half of the group. From what I could tell, the group encircled, I kid you not, a pentagram drawn on the floor. Holy shit. Scanning my eyes around further, I could see a tall figure standing in the center. Still as a statue, it stared down at the floor as the group continued to chant. Suddenly the weirdo girl stood facing the stairs, and, just as I was about to pull back, she looks up at me and shouts in English: "Someone's here!"



I felt my heart stop for a second, I was so scared. I heard the figure's neck snap 180 degrees to face me, which was enough of a sign to get the hell out of there. I slammed the cellar shut, jumped to my feet, and quickly closed the door behind me before darting in the opposite direction.



If you didn't know, my least favorite season is autumn. Not because of the allergies or anything like that. I actually enjoy the cold air. No, my reason to loathe the season is because of the leaves. We have a bunch of trees in our yard, so I typically volunteer my time raking all the leaves with my mom. In that forest of magnolia and birch leaves, I couldn't escape the sounds of crunching beneath my feet. I ran faster than I ever did before, which only made my position more obvious. I didn't dare to turn back, but I could hear the group of kids trailing a decent distance behind me. All I had to my advantage was that it was dark. At least, I think I had something going for me. I couldn't tell who that seventh person was, but they definitely weren't human. And not, like, \*me\* not human. This was some sort of demonic entity. I remember it having charcoal black skin and horns, its only discernable facial detail being its pure white eyes.



I ran as far as I could until I started hearing less and less activity from the (hopefully) distant group. I wasn't sure how much farther the forest stretched on for, so to save my stamina and conceal my presence, I found a bush beside a magnolia tree and squeezed my body between the foliage. I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. As a Christian, I don't believe in ghosts, but demons are a whole 'nother story. In an attempt to get my emotions under control, I began mouthing the Lord's Prayer, shutting my eyes tightly before crying myself to sleep as quietly as I could. I legitimately thought that I was going to die, that no one would ever find me or hear from me again, like Mr. Rutledge.



I wake up in a cold sweat not long after I fell asleep. The forest was filled with a deathly silence, one so significant that you can actually hear your own thoughts, if that makes sense. No crickets, no owls, nothing. I rose to my feet from my hiding spot, my legs having fallen asleep. I wiped my damp face with a sleeve and stretched up against a tree. At the time, I really needed to urinate, so I figured 'huh, well, I could just go here'. I untied my sweatpants and started peeing on the base of a tree. After a few seconds, I heard a sound echo from the direction of the hut, my ears perking. Words would fail to do it justice, but it sounded as if dozens of voices shouted a collective, bloodcurdling scream at the top of their lungs in unison. I have no doubt in my mind that anything remotely similar to such a noise would effortlessly instill fear within any person. I stopped pissing out of fear and tied my drawstring, desperately glancing around to find the source. And there, just a ways over a creek, stood the figure. If it weren't for its glaring, impossible white eyes, I wouldn't have seen it. Making direct eye contact with it flooded my mind with what felt like other people's memories, but only ones of suffering and agony. I had to've witnessed hundreds, but from what I remember in the visions (not in any particular order) I think I saw a guy get blasted in the chest by a firing squad, a woman being hanged, and, to my surprise, Jared's death. His had to have been the most vivid, like I intentionally experienced every passing second, every detail, as they slit his throat and severed his arms. I could've sworn I felt pain, too.



I strongly believe no single person should ever deserve to have seen what I saw. In fact, I think it might have rocked my mental stability, if it hadn't been devastated already by what's transpired. When I felt the influx of memories fading, in my dazed state, I saw the creature charging at me, leaping from tree to tree every few feet. My eyes ached. "Fuck," I slurred, trying to get away. My knees felt weak, and it took everything in me not to trip on even the miniscule tree roots that littered my path. I'm not sure how long I ran for, but I finally left the forest, finding myself in an open field next to what appeared to be a desolate road, a dim gas station in the distance. With basically nowhere to run at this point, I turn to see the creature slowly approaching me, as if I was being stalked as prey. "What do you want?" I cried, almost certain I wouldn't get an answer.



Its voice was faint, like it was a phantom (sort of was, anyway). I saw its blood red mouth open to speak. It started speaking, but its speech was too fast for me to even understand. As it chanted under its breath, what I got from it was "He who (something) finds mercy in Beel, that which the Heavens ignore" (which I think is probably short for Beelzebub. Eesh.) It went on for minutes on end, so I covered my ears. I'm just surprised that it even spoke in English, this beast. Hatred presents itself in many forms. Coming to my senses, I take a deep breath and yell "I rebuke you, Satan! The Lord testifies against thee, that you may waive your dark reign! God be my refuge!" I don't know what I said exactly, but it was something like that. I think we both might've been in some deep shit, honestly. Well, he more so than I.



In that moment, I could actually \*feel\* the hate it exuded. It got so heated that it rushed me at breakneck speed. I felt it slash my arm with its claws, causing me to gasp and fall back. As blood dripped down my shirt sleeve, I suddenly got a burst of adrenaline. I retaliated, throwing a punch or two at its chest. Never have I ever had to physically harm someone before, even if this thing was evil. Its bare, black flesh felt like rubber, and, after my assault, it, too, had retreated a ways. "I-I'm sorry!" I raised my voice. I'm not sure why I apologized to a messenger of Satan, but I felt bad for hurting another being nonetheless. The creature snarled at me before charging headfirst at me once again. I was scared, but I felt ready. It easily grabbed me, picked me up, and ran my back into a chain link fence. I felt the pain radiate through my spinal cord, but it wasn't enough to fell me, apparently. I grabbed its horns, using them to slide my body out of its grip before I opened my jaw and bit its neck as hard as I could. It let out a screech so loud that I went deaf for a second, but I never let go. My mouth tasted of blood and treachery, and I had to keep from throwing up. I grunted as I pulled back, ripping out a good chunk of its throat. The damage had been done, and was substantial enough that it backed off. I felt myself slip out of its grip. My waist burned, and my ribs felt weak.



I spit out as much flesh as I could once it dropped to the ground, gasping for air. It was miserable and sickening, watching it die. And to be used in such sick rituals, too. It wasn't at fault. Those kids were. I cried and got on top of the demon, shaking it as if to get its attention. It suddenly lost its complexion completely, revealing a face I hadn't seen in a while - Mr. Rutledge. I screamed and kicked myself off of him, my breath still weak. "S-Sir, are you alright?" I ask, catching my breath. On closer inspection, he was already dead, possibly long before I had bitten his neck. He had numerous stab wounds scattered about his chest, and two dislocated shoulders. I got on my knees and prayed over the corpse, both for the forgiveness and salvation of us both. I felt shaken, but better.



It took hours to get back home. Again, y'know, bad at direction. I found my mother sitting in the kitchen with my aunt, whom I guess she called shortly after I didn't come back. I cried in my mother's arms and explained what happened, knowing she wouldn't believe me. She did. After I showered and got cleaned up, I gargled whatever oral solutions I could to get that taste of death out of my mouth.



So, life's gone back to normal... kind of. I haven't seen the Weirdo kids in weeks, and neither has anyone else. Probably skipped town to continue their satanic depravity. The authorities found Mr. Rutledge's corpse in that field and broadcasted it on the news. I hate that I can't tell anyone I know about what's happened. I suppose this is all between me, God, and whoever's decided to read all this. Whether or not you want to believe it is up to you. All I ask is, please, don't be led astray. There's a lot of horrible people out there who simply don't know the Lord, some going as far as to act against him, much like my former "classmates". I'm not saying you have to convert to Christianity, or even ask Jesus to be your savior, though it'd be a good decision, if you ask me. He's helped me get through whatever the hell's happened in the past couple months.









Anyway, that's my story. This all took place last year. I think I feel better now, though we still miss Jared. I know he's in a better place now, at least. I hope Mr. Rutledge can forgive me for what I did. I even have a girlfriend now.

Also, I accidentally cut my finger yesterday, and my blood was black, kinda like ink. Anyone know what I should do? Do I have, like, AIDS or something? lol
