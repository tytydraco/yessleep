In our town, there are two types of jobs for graduating seniors. 

Since college isn't an option. 

Physical. So, laborers. Those types of people. But there's also the *adult*, adult jobs. Like the guys who come to fix your light fixture or try to sell you a house. 

Then there's working at the TV studio. Which, obviously, is the better option. 

Redrum Studio was responsible for a multitude of local TV channels and shows, dominated by the one and only talk show broadcasted across town, known for its… odd selection of guests. 

On air every morning between 7 and 9, and then later at night for adults, call it a televised circus. I was twelve years old  when the show first started. 

I remember the first guest being a real life vampire. Conrad Myers, a shy looking kid who kept his head down for most of the interview, awkwardly nodding and barely moving his lips in answer to questions. He didn't look like a vampire, reddish dark hair sprouting from a hood, and narrow features, a lazy eye that couldn't seem to find the camera. 

I didn't believe he was a vampire until he drained a rabbit on camera, and I was sent to my room by my horrified parents. Conrad didn't want to do it. When he was asked to prove himself by the grinning host, he shook his head. But the audience insisted, booing him until a live rabbit was brought on stage. The crowd, egged on by the host, started to chant. 

*Eat the rabbit!*

*Eat the rabbit!*

*Eat the rabbit!*

Conrad had been forced to his feet, and I remember thinking the people were being far too rough with him, handling him with special gloves and 'bite-proof' jackets. The camera zoomed on his face, as the boy shrunk back, shaking his head rapidly. His eyes were wide. Frightened. The host started to tease him, laughing that he couldn't be a *real* vampire, if he didn't feed. That sent him to his knees, his frenzied eyes finding the camera. 

*Please*. 

He was begging the audience, and us at home. He was pleading with us to stop. But that just gave the audience incentive to throw things at him, full cans of soda hitting him in the face and exploding on the stage. I think we all saw something snap inside Conrad. Mom turned to me, her expression twisting. I could tell she was itching look back at the screen. Her gaze had been captured by the boy on camera, who stopped cowering under his hood. "Bellamy, go to your room." 

Mom's breathy voice barely registered in my mind. I watched Conrad seemingly lose all of his dignity, his humanity, right on camera. I had grown up reading about vampires. I knew of Dracula and Nosferatu, the fictional manifestations of the popular myth of a bloodsucking humanoid. This boy, however, was neither of those things. 

There were no glowing eyes, or pale skin, no real vampire attributes except razor sharp insisors he was trying to hide with the sleeve of his jacket. I watched him in awe, attempt to stumble off stage, before the rabbit's throat was sliced right in front of him. 

Mom was already reaching for the TV remote when Conrad's expression went flat, his body suddenly relaxing, shoulders slumping.

Our whole town watched this boy drop to his knees in startling claret, empty eyes finding the camera, lips twisting into a manical grin, before bending down, his body primed like an animal, fingernails curling, clawing at the rabbit's fur in a predatory grasp. 

Mom started to scream, but it was too late to grab the remote, or cover my eyes. Conrad ravaged the animal on live television. Blood stemmed around him, pooling across the stage and dripping down his face and chin. His eyes didn't find the camera– or they did, but I was seeing an abyss, oblivion staring back. 

It is a myth that vampire's eyes glow red. In reality, they lose all color in their iris' completely, reduced to twin caverns carved into their face. A real life vampire was on stage, and nobody was freaking out. He was snarling, crawling back on his knees with the severed head still stuck between his teeth, when guards approached him, hauling the boy to his feet. He didn't fight back when they slammed him to the ground. Instead, he buried his head in his arms. 

I could see his trembling body. They were torturing him, the audience laughing at his apparent panic attack, when he clutched at his throat, mouthing, *Stop! Please!*

"But you're a vampire!" The host laughed, rolling her eyes. "Vampires don't get scared!" 

Mom told me to go to my room, and I was halfway out of the lounge, my heart catapulting into my throat, when I twisted around, mesmerised by the glimmer of red stretched across the stage, like a brand new plush carpet. 

The host was standing in it, smears decorating her bare legs and the bottom of her heels, as she clapped wildly, lips stretched into a grin. "There you have it!" she said into her mic, "We have a real life vampire!" 

That is when I made the conscious decision that out of the options I had after graduation, I would never choose the studio. The guests over the years got more and more freakish, and I started to wonder where they were coming from. 

Conrad was definitely a vampire, modelled into a celebrity-like status across town. The following year, Zach, the zombie boy, and Sunny, the cheerleader who couldn't die. All of these kids became regulars, performing every week like real circus freaks. And every time I found myself watching this stupid show, I started to realize that my town was under its manic trance, and that included me. I would never fall under its spell. That is what I told myself. No matter what happened, I would never give myself to this studio. 

But then Mom died. Dad left me halfway through my junior year for a twenty five year old, leaving me with pretty much nothing. So, what did I do? 

I sold myself to Redrum. 

Or more appropriately, I applied for a job working behind the scenes. I wasn't surprised when I got an interview. These guys looked for recent graduates. Fresh faces. What did surprise me, however, was the test I had to take after my initial interview. 

The man who conducted my interview was nice enough. He told me I was a potential candidate, and would be put through a test. I found myself in a small classroom like setting. The desk at the back had my name in neat letters printed on a sticker, and I took my seat.

There were four other candidates, with all of them being recent graduates. 

A smartly dressed woman entered the room, handed out test papers, and then left. A voice over the intercom told us that we had 20 minutes to complete the test. The questions started off normal enough. I was asked to write my name. 

Bellamy Winslow. 

Age: 18. 

*Q1. In your own words, please write in detail why you want to pursue a career at Redrum studios.*

I wrote three paragraphs of BS, describing how inspired I was as a kid, and my dream to work behind the scenes. I glanced up, mid writing, to see the guy in front of me giving me an odd look, his brow raised. I noticed he'd written one word. His name. Kai. He'd doodled spiders all over the margins. With a quiet scoff, he turned back to his test. The girl behind me, with a pen sticking out of her mouth, offered me a sarcastic smile when I scanned the room. I didn't realize the scratching of my pencil on paper had been so loud. 

*Q2. Can you name three of our most popular guests?*

The tap, tap, tapping of another guy's pen was slowly starting to drive me mad. I wrote down Conrad the vampire, Zach, the zombie boy, and Jessa, the girl made of stone. All of them were memorible from the audience's reaction. Even after Mom grounded me from watching it, I had still watched Zombie Boy slurp up human intestines on stage. The intestines were from a dead person, was what we were told. But my stomach still danced, watching this dead boy forking them up like noodles. 

The memory made me feel nauseous, and I shifted in my chair, my mouth watering. I avoided pasta for years after watching his vacant eyes peering through the camera, stiff jaw struggling to chew, scarlet and spew spilling down his chin, like congealed spaghetti sauce.

Urgh. 

*Q3. On a scale from 1-10, what is your pain tolerance?* 

That was a question I was not expecting. I had to think about it, chewing on my pencil. I scribbled down 5. I could deal with pain. If it meant spilling scalding coffee all over myself in a rush, or dealing with violent guests. 

The guy in front of me was still scribbling spiders when I lifted my head. 

*Q4. What would you give to work for us?*

**Two dollars, and a McDonald's voucher for a double cheeseburger**, I joked, before scribbling it out, and writing, *I will give my all to be the best I can be, and to strive even further.*

*Q5. Do you have any medical conditions?* 

Nope. I scribbled out the **No** option. 

*Q6. Are you **SURE** you do not have any medical conditions?* 

Yes. 

Questions seven to ten were brow raising, demanding my sleep schedule, and if I was taking any drugs (prescribed and not prescribed) 

But it was question eight that sent my mind plunging. 

**Q8. How susceptible are you to outside influences?**

Suddenly, it was like the world had stopped. Movement in front of me, a guys head dropping into the desk. They were like dominos, crashing down one by one. There was no panic, no crying out. 

Pencils slid from fingers that had gone limp, bodies following suit. Something was screaming at me to get up, to lurch up from my chair. But I couldn't move. 

My eyes were glued to the question. *Am I susceptible to outside influence?* 

The words and letters had a meaning, color, a taste, as the question itself contorted on the paper like it was alive. The words tasted like… apples. Candy apples. The room filled with the aroma, and all I could think about then was candy apples. Red candied ones that I had to bite into. 

Bite into… 

Bite.

I opened my mouth, feeling along my upper insisors with my free hand. 

I was partially aware of my own pencil dropping to the ground and rolling under my desk. I could feel something wet and warm, drool, sliding from my mouth and pooling down my chin. There were more questions appearing beyond 10, but I couldn't read them. They were too fast for my brain, my hand already moving to scribble down answers, the sound grazing my foggy mind. There was a clock on the wall. I found myself staring at it, slack jawed. 

Something was dripping on the desk, seeping across the top of my paper. 

Quarter past midnight. 

I blinked, shaking my head of fog. 

Then again. 

But I walked into the test at 7:30. 

I was so tired, my eyes heavy and drooping. I dropped my pencil, which was suddenly back between my fingers. 

"Thank you for completing the test."

Jerking my head up, I swiped drool from my lips and chin. 

The smartly dressed woman was standing in front of us. She nodded at us. "You may leave."

I was on my feet, and heading toward the door before her words could register in my mind. When cold air slammed into me once I was outside, I managed to regain my thoughts. 

I pulled out my phone. 

2am. 

Exactly. 

The others seemed to be in a daze around me. "Did anyone else blank out during the test?" one of the guy's spoke out loud, but we were already scattering. 

His words were still stale in my mind when I was walking home. I was three blocks away from my house, and yet somehow, I felt far away. Like I was walking on air. 

Something rushed past me, a cloud of exhaust fumes flying in my face, and I stumbled back, reality starting to blossom into fruition. I was half awake, dried drool on my chin, and my body aching. My steps weren't steady, clumsy and topsy turvy, like I had just jumped off of a carnival ride. Looking around, I was sure I wasn't far from home. 

But every step seemed to slow down, like the world was grinding to a halt. Another look at my phone, but it wasn't in my hand. I was just staring at thin air. 

*But… where was my phone?*

My hand looked… weird. Too many fingers, and then too little. I wiggled my index, peering closer. Then my pinkie. It looked funky, like part of it was missing. 

I could taste something in my mouth suddenly, a tangy and metallic tinge at the back of my throat and coating my teeth. Blinding light in my eyes, but I was still standing frozen, gingerly running my tongue over my bloody lips. In short flashes, I felt arms wrapping around me. But I didn't move. 

I didn't know how. My whole body was paralyzed, because I had been mindlessly chewing on my own severed pinkie. 

I blinked again, and I was sitting cross legged on ice cold metal flooring, being violently thrown around the back of a van. It's weird. Like I could control time, jumping forwards with a blink. Except every time I jumped forward, reality became harder to make out. Time twisted around me, dragging me through seconds, minutes, hours, days? 

Weeks. 

Months. 

There was a specific room that was mine. But I don't remember speaking, or having coherent thought inside this room. I remember there was a simple bed, a desk, and a mirror. I broke the mirror twice. I didn't sleep. Couldn't fucking fall asleep. Could **NEVER** fall asleep. 

Days blurred into one, and every time I caught my reflection, I could no longer recognise myself. I remember my first time out of that room, that I thought was endless, and would last forever. 

It was after time had stopped for me, and I was only aware that I wasn't… myself. I knew my name, but only because I had been told it multiple times. "Bellamy." They told me, when I was strapped down under bliding light, squirming underneath the masked man's gloves delving inside the cavern cut into my torso and my skull. 

Sometimes, I wondered if I was dreaming– or having an out of body experience, maybe. But when I moved, my shadow was different. 

My whole body was different, a writhing, slimy thing erupting from my flesh. Sometimes these things moved. 

Like branches, waving at me. They killed three men in white, even when I was strapped down, snaking around their necks and squeezing, twisting, until the head was popping off like a bottle cap. 

The men in white didn't like how… unpredictable these things could be. 

So, they sliced them away, one by one, severing them from the root right under my skin. Soon after, they came back, this time embedded inside my blood. The men in white tested me,  cutting I to me, only for this thing, this sentient being entwining my blood and bone fought back. Not like a waving branch this time. 

I saw its shadow in dazzling white light illuminating my mutilated torso underneath blood spattered blankets. This time I could sense it slithering under my skin, rippling in my blood. I liked to play a game with myself, timing how long it would take for me to pass out from the tests I was put through. My shortest time was 7 seconds. I think it was. I passed out before the numbers could fully form. 

I wasn't awake for a number of the procedures, but when I was, I wished myself dead, that the scalpel slicing me open for the tenth time, would finally puncture something important. 

Unluckily for me, it didn't. I was moved to a different room. This one had a single chair, and a glass screen in front of me. 

I forget my name again when they forced me down, pinning my wrists. 

"Bellamy." the nurse told me, when I asked her, my head cocked, thoughts still dancing from my morning cocktail. 

Her smile was friendly enough until she turned and placed down a single soda can in front of me. I hadn't seen a can of soda in… I had no idea. I started to move, an impulse forcing me from the chair. But the velcro straps held me down. The nurse shook her head, and in the corner of my eye, a group of masked people carefully watched me through the sheet of glass, armed with iPads. 

They asked me to use the can without my hands.

First, I thought they were fucking with me. So, I forcefully toppled myself over. 

But that just earned me a sharp electroshock of pain running across my skull. I didn't even notice the strange metal pads glued to the back of my head. The nurse, still with a wide smile, told me once again to grab the can of soda without the use of my hands. And I did. I don't remember much. What I do remember, is that paticular nurse being carried out of the room, the remnants of her glued to a stretcher. 

The room was a lot redder than I remembered, and it was raining. 

Something wet dripped onto my face, but I was too busy slurping from the can. It tasted good. Fuck. Bubbly soda running down my throat. I burped, and something fleshy and red hit the floor. The soda had a weird taste. Maybe diet? 

Not long after that, I was meeting others like me. The nurse told me to be nice. Apparently, I was the only one who did not suffer neurological trauma. 

I met the others over McDonald's served to us in a lounge area complete with a cafeteria. I was chewing on a burger when they each took their seats. I recognised all of them. The candidates from the test. But, just like the nurse told me, they had been severely altered. 

The guy who scoffed at me, doodling spiders all over his paper, was silent. There was a scary looking bandage wrapped around his neck. I could make out slight smears of red leaking through. 

I didn't comment, biting further into my burger. The others were… overly giggly. The girls burst out laughing in intervals, while another guy, followed suit, like he was copying them. But then I started picking at my fries, and so did he, mirroring my exact actions, his fingers grasping at imaginary food. His expression mimicked mine, my wide eyes, curled lips, the confusion riddled in my brows. 

When someone did speak, which was rare, he copied them, the exact curl on their lip and the tone of their voice. The nurse asked if we wanted dessert, and he mimicked her, almost instantly, blood seeping from his nose. His eyes resembled a childs, wide and curious. 

It was almost like this guy was learning. 

The last boy seemed the least with it. His head was cocked at an unnatural angle, eyes heavy and half lidded, and when I was really taking him in, I could see stitches lining across his forehead. The boy's eyes were hollowed out, and yet his smile was somehow genuine. I think. 

"Fry?" 

He offered me one with a wide, toothy smile. 

His teeth were bright red, still wet. 

That day, I think I met my family. 

Especially when we made our first (and last) guest appearance on the town's talk show. 

The stage lights were too bright.

Next to me, Ethan's hands were trembling in his lap, exactly where he had been told to put them. I had no idea there was a certain etiquette on talk shows. We had to sit sandwiched together, the girls with their legs crossed, and the guys hands in their laps. They had cleaned up pretty well, satin dresses for the girls, and suits and ties for us guys. The hands in your lap thing was probably a polite thing. 

In our case though, it was probably for *other* reasons too. I could see the way the shadowy audience were looking at us. Their narrowed eyes felt like knives slicing into me. The talk show host's smile was too big, too many teeth, a lipsticky grin treating us like we were feral. She was even more terrifying up close, and I was already overstimulated from the lights blinding me, the loud pop music bursting from the speakers. 

I kept glancing over to Ethan, who I was told to keep an eye on. His leg was moving up and down. 

"Next on the show," the host trilled to the cameras in front of us, "We have five miracles! They went viral across town after showing… unique abilities!" 

My turn to speak. 

Hands in your lap to avoid complications. 

Was what they told us before coming on stage.

"So, why don't you guys spill the juicy details, hmm?" 

Camera two fell on me, and I pulled my lips into a cheesy grin. "Well," I wiped my hands on expensive pants, slicking them over rich material. "We were born with this thing and we found each other, like… fate!" The teleprompter said [LAUGH] and I did, albeit shakily. 
Tee and Ruby were told not to laugh, because their laughter did bad things. 

In the corner of my eye, their heads were bowed, no doubt hiding their giggles. 

*Fate.* I thought dizzily, swiping my clammy hands up and down my pants. 

I was still inside that room of concrete, counting my breaths and waiting for the next razor sharp slice down the back of my head and torso. I could still feel the tough velcro straps holding me down, the ground rumbling beneath my feet every time a scream clawed from my throat, and masked figures looming over me, prodding and poking until something inside me snapped, ignited, coming to life. The chair I was forced into. Four walls of pristine white smeared in mesmerising red, and a single empty soda can sitting in front of me. 

"Fate." I told the shadowy faces in front of me, my body starting to contort beneath me, phantom blood trickling down my face. It was wet and sticky. I could still see the soda can hitting the wall, and my knees slamming into cold porcelain. *Don't go off script* the voice in my ear warned. But it wasn't… fate, I thought, my own foot starting to *tap, tap, tap*– Johnny lay a hand on my leg, telling me with eyes that had made the audience squirm, it was okay. 

But it wasn't… okay.

They dragged me into a van in the middle of the night, after I mutilated myself. I was drugged until I couldn't think straight, my body sliced and purged until I no longer felt human.

They ripped Ethan's voice out, stripped the girls of their minds, Kai of his soul.

Johnny had half of a fucking brain. 

*Fate.*

A shrill scream rang out suddenly, and I jerked my head up, only to see the host's severed head rolling across the stage. The others started laughing. Not just the girls, their laughter already rumbling the ground beneath us. Kai, setting the front row alight with a single swipe of his hand. Johnny sat back, head cocked, blank eyes on camera 2, the girl's erupting into hyena giggles.

Giggles that turned physical in the air, beginning a manic dance across the stage, and delving into the audience to feast. I watched Ethan jump up, his shadow looming over me, both arms flinging out and tearing off heads, filleting the panicked hoard rushing to  get out, geisers of sharp red splattering plush seats. The vivid glow of fire tearing through the screaming hoard finally woke me up. I was seeing color. 

Blood seeping across the stage, staining my brand new shoes. 

Unbelievably to me, the camera's kept rolling. 

They filmed everything. 

I knew I would join them soon enough, massacring the people who turned me. 

But first, I was just going to sit, with my hands in my lap. 

Just like they told me. 

… 

Presently, we're far away from that nightmare town. I'm currently inside a sort of… institute. For young monsters. They picked us up when we managed to escape what was supposed to be a televised execution. Every day, I learn a new thing about what exactly they tried and I guessed succeeded, in turning me into. I have therapy sessions every week (sometimes with a real life mermaid! Or merpeople, there are more than one) where we learn what we are. 

Thank you for reading. I know it was a lot, but I'm encouraged to write down my experiences. It's a form of therapy.
