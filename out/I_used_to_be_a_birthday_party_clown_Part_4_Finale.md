Let me just start by saying this:

If you ever find yourself Googling “how to kill a demon clown” at 3:17 a.m. with blood on your face and a balloon dog in your hand — it’s already too late.

So here’s how my finale started: well I hope this is the finale. 

I woke up in the bathtub of my Motel 6.

Fully clothed.

Covered in glitter.

Someone had written “LAUGH, LAUGH, DIE” on the mirror in what I hope was red lipstick and not clown blood. (Because that stains. Ask Greg. Oh… wait.)

I staggered to my feet like a baby deer on meth, grabbed my Christmas bat, and opened the bathroom door—

Balloon animals. Everywhere.

Snakes. Giraffes. A very offensive balloon sculpture that looked suspiciously like my ex.

And right in the center of the room: a single clown shoe.

Still warm.

Then the TV turned itself on again. No static this time.

It was playing old birthday party footage.

Mine.

From 1996.

Little me, sitting there in a Ninja Turtles shirt with a fun loving grin, while a very familiar clown performed tricks in the background.

Chuckles.

Not the one I played. The original.

The one from the stories.

The one who disappeared after that party and was never seen again.

Until now.

Because the camera zoomed in on him, and he looked straight into the lens… and winked.

TV: “See you soon, birthday boy.”

I screamed. 

Then the ceiling above me cracked—

And a full-sized clown dropped through it like a nightmarish piñata.

Boom. Right on the motel floor.

He rose slowly. That smile stitched into his face like someone used dental floss and cruelty.

From somewhere deep in his chest, he let out the creepiest, raspiest, “HOOOOOONK.”

I did the only thing I could.

I threw salt in face (shout out one of the honk-honkers for the idea!) Then swung my bat of holiday terrors at him and yelled: “NO MORE PARTIES!”

He caught it. Twirled it. Snapped it over his knee.

He cocked his head and flashed that fucked up smile on his face then suddenly, I wasn’t in the motel anymore.

I was standing in a circus tent.

The circus tent from my nightmares, where the audience is just mannequins in party hats and the cotton candy smells like formaldehyde.

I turned in slow circles.

Spotlights flicked on one by one, blinding.

Then he appeared in the center ring.

OG Chuckles, holding Greg’s face like a hand puppet.

“You’re the last one,” he said, voice like a balloon deflating through a harmonica.

“Last what?” I shouted.

“The final Chuckles” he said. “The last one, the star of tonight’s show.”

Then came the clowns.

Hundreds.

From trapdoors, shadows and under the bleachers.

Laughing.

Dancing.

All in sync like a satanic flash mob.

I ran out of the ring. Through the funhouse maze. Past the mirrors but instead of my reflection they showed tombstones with my name on them and instead of something nice or cute all I got for a header was “HE DIED AS HE LIVED. SCREAMING.”

But you know what?

Something snapped in me then.

Maybe it was the years of trauma.

Maybe it was the glitter in my lungs.

Maybe I just finally had enough of this goddamn haunted circus.

I turned around. Picked up a juggling pin and I charged.

I fought through the clowns like a man possessed by sugar, vengeance, and two decades of unresolved trauma.

I knocked over a clown with stilts.

Ripped the wig off another.

Kicked a mime in the balls. (Yes, they made a sound. It was glorious.)

Then it was just me and Chuckles.

He lunged.

I ducked.

Grabbed his oversized tie and yanked him. face first into a flaming pie.

He screamed.

Ran in circles. 

Face melting.

Then BAM! He exploded into confetti.

The tent collapsed around me.

Ashes fell like snow.

I crawled out into the night.

Somewhere, an old calliope wheezed its final tune.

And then… silence.

I think the show has finally come to an end, boys and girls.
