It was a simple dare: go and sit in the chair in the old dollmaker’s house. The house was scheduled to be destroyed as part of some wholesale renovation of the neighborhood; the old houses doomed to be torn down to make way for new, sleeker models. The dollmaker had died a decade prior, and the house hadn’t seen a single new tenant since. Something about the place was universally though unidentifiably disagreeable, unwholesome both within and without, and of course a local legend about it was eventually formed.  

The sole remaining piece of furniture in the house was a simple wooden chair, which faced a wall in the man's bedroom – a wall upon which strange lyrics in an unknown language had been written sometime during the latter, possibly senile years of owner’s occupancy. The language was unidentifiable, and therefore thought to be gibberish; the insanely scrawled ravings of a man who had always been a little off-kilter, even during his saner days.  

The cause of his death was said to be natural, but to sensationalize and propagate the legend, it was suggested that he'd actually been murdered by his dolls – none of which were ever found. 

I of course didn't believe it, and gladly accepted the challenge to enter the derelict house, sit in the singular chair, and recite the wall-scribbled nonsense  - at the promise of a burger upon my return.  

Suspecting nothing, confident that I’d complete the “challenge” without issue, I entered the perpetually unlocked house, found the vacant room with its yellowed wallpaper and unshaded window, and sat in the chair. Only absent-mindedly did I notice the valleys of scratches in the armrests, as if fingernails had streaked across the wood in some panicked frenzy. I was simply too focused on the weird writing on the wall, which was definitely in a language—or an imitation of one—I’d never seen before. 

I spoke the rhythmically metered words to the best of my ability, expecting nothing. But then, in a flash of brilliant crimson, I felt myself suddenly and wholly *dissolved* into the air, as if the fiery light had swept through and disinterested me. Only an instant later, I found myself standing in a long and dark corridor, which was lined with pictures of strange figures posed oddly, disconcertingly; and all their faces were gone – scraped or etched away.  

Before I could move in either direction down the hall, one of the frames began to shake, and suddenly fell from the wall. The glass shattered upon impact, the sound of which was unusually and unnervingly loud in the doubly vast corridor. 

But the activity of the picture was not over: a black thing began to thickly bubble up from the shards of glass, and the image therein seemed to be at the core of this Stygian substance. Soon, the substance took form, solidifying and lightening; and before long there stood a woman, clothed in the same simple white dress she’d been wearing in the framed picture. But unlike the picture, she had a face – quite a beautiful one; white and luminous as a newly risen moon, with eyes like two calm, abyssal seas, and shoulder length sable hair. 

But just when I was about to greet her, something horrible happened.  

Her face burst open, flesh-flaps blowing outward, revealing a pest-infested skull—grinning hideously, evilly; the visage of a maniacal fiend. Things that weren't quite bugs yet bore a horrific, otherworldly resemblance to them squirmed and squelched with verminous excitement from the hollows between her facial bones -a brownish-green assemblage of sepulchral parasites.  

She started towards me, shambling down the dark corridor, bumping into the walls and knocking loose the pictures and wall sconces. Her blood-stained clothes slowly melted away like the wax off a candle, revealing a naked, sickeningly emaciated body; as if she’d gone without water and sustenance for days, *weeks*, leaving her pallid skin dehydrated and taut. Weirdly, she was sexless, and her stomach was likewise devoid of a navel. (These minor observations I only recalled later.) 

I inched backwards, my legs moving stiffly as if mired in slime. With each sconce she knocked over the light in the hall diminished, growing dimmer and gloomier by the minute. The flames of the loosened candles were snuffed by the molten darkness that seemed to bubble up from between the floorboards; some residue of—or relative to—the same stuff that had brought her to life. Shadowy emanations rose to ankle-length, obscuring the floor beneath me. Where they touched the tears in my jeans I felt a coldness, as of a whipping winter wind.  

When a solid wall stopped my backwards progress, I screamed—thinking myself trapped with no way to escape the pale-skinned nightmare. Its body lurched and spasmed, convulsing mid-step, as it drew nearer and nearer. The facially embedded bouquet of vile frothing pests throbbed with new glee at the prospect of my devourment.... 

My eyes scanned the vast grey walls, the shadow-clung ceiling, the dirty carpeted floor; but I saw nothing with which to defend myself, no item or object to use as a weapon. Ten feet. Six, three. Corpse slime and bile, intermingled into a sickening green sludge, leaked from its misaligned jaw. Its eyes—or rather, the pits where they would’ve been—burned with a deathly fire; the sorcerous blue embers of a necromantically reared lich. Eldritch insects entered and exited those pits at random, their carapaces gleaming in the infernal light. 

I raised my hands and closed my eyes, hoping to shield myself from the imminent attack, whilst also hoping that the end would be quick, painless; a swiftly dealt blow, rather than some slow, agonizing violence. I didn’t want to see or feel it, just wanted the terror to end.  

Just when I smelled her hot, infinitely putrid breath, and felt the radiance of Hadean heat from her feverous body, I heard a voice—distant and meek, but oddly soothing. It spoke my name, softly and comfortingly; and when I opened my eyes, I saw a small, wispy sphere of light behind the creature, a few paces down the hall. Sensing a spirit or presence of salvation in that luminous orb, I mustered up a little courage—rekindling for the moment my animus to survive—and pushed away the face-less, malevolently grinning monster.  

She—it—fell to the side, catching the wall with one of her bloodied, claw-like hands, and hissed venomously at me; but I was already rushing away towards the light, which had started to hover away. Following it, with that lich-like horror on my heels, I rounded corner after featureless corner in the ceaselessly shifting and maddeningly indistinguishable halls. Always the light stayed a little ahead of me, just out of reach. And she, as tireless as she was malignant, pursued me without pause—hissing and shrieking all the while.  

Finally, the light led me to a door with a surface embossed with the décor of a hand clutching a hammer, which had seemed to appear seemingly out of nowhere—merely coming to sudden existence at the end of a long and nigh lightless corridor. The orb of light went *through* the door, and assuming that this meant I could open it—since there hadn’t been any other doors—I quickened my pace with arms outstretched.  

And just as I had thought, I burst through, and without even taking a moment to inspect the room, turned and slammed the door shut. The horror beyond crashed into the door and proceeded to beat upon it savagely, but the frame and the door itself held; and I knew, somehow, that she would not be able to cross that particular threshold.  

For the moment, I was safe.  

Turning around, I saw that the light had changed. Rather than retain its former orb-like shape, it had expanded to become a sort of cloud-form of light, brilliantly luminous and tinged with a golden hue. Its radiance slowly filled the room, illuminating the sparsely and anciently furnished office space. There was a desk strewn with long, yellowed papers to my left; a bookcase loaded with old, virtually indistinguishable books—their covers long since faded—sat to my right; in the front of the room (beyond the still-expanding light-cloud) was a long work table, upon which had been placed several strange figures: wood and clay sculptures of hideous, monstrous things—small simulacra of the most unsettling creatures I’d ever seen.  

But what chilled me to my core and brought forth a pervasive, mind-unshackling dread was the familiarity of the last figure. Standing there atop its little wooden base, arms outstretched in an unmistakably hostile embrace, was that ghastly woman; that lich-like, taut-skinned fiend who had tirelessly pursued me through the winding corridors.  

And at that moment I knew that I had, somehow, invoked or conjured her from the picture in the hall, which had undoubtedly been her vessel—her prison—for who knows how long. And, venturing further in my speculations upon the unreal, I guessed that these idols acted in some way as anchors of those framed horrors; vessels to which they could be bound, or otherwise ensorcelled – should they ever be freed from the pictures.  

I shuddered at the idea of setting free those other horrors whose true images were represented by the figures on the table: demons and incubi and malformed, twisted abominations out of some warlock’s black and profane reverie. God only knows how I hadn’t summoned them in my recitation of those sorcerous lyrics upon the wall, back at the home. Perhaps each required its own invocation or spell. Regardless, I knew that I had to destroy the idol, that I couldn’t allow that hideous nightmare to freely roam the halls- lest some poor soul stumble upon the chair, and tragically find himself transported to this cold, Tartarean otherworld. 

The goldenly beaming light then hovered a little over the table, and subsequently focused itself into a columnar scope; highlighting a bundle of tools. Gripping a small mallet that sat near to those abhorrent sculptures, I prepared myself for the destruction of the idol – and any ramifications of the act. I smiled to myself at the irony; the mallet had probably been used in some fashion to construct the horrible thing, and here I was about to destroy it with the very same tool. The providential light, apparently having accomplished what it’d set out to do, dissipated into the ether; somberly illuminating the room. Despite its utter lack of any anthropomorphic quality, I sensed that there’d been a human quality about it – that it had, in some earlier state, been a person. Whom? I couldn’t say, and have only a loose, unverifiable idea now... 

As if sensing the imminent undoing of its physical anchor to the mundane world, the undead avatar of that evil image howled from outside the door, throwing its piercing voice into the cold air. Its insane shrieking only compelled me onward; and with a mighty swing I brought the mallet down onto the figure, smashing it to splinters.  

A dire and baleful tension filled the air, and I briefly felt as if I would lose consciousness from a sudden sense of intra-cranial pressure. But then, as abruptly as it had come, the feeling left me; and the foreboding tension evaporated, and the room was silent.  

It wasn’t until a fragment of the destroyed figure fell to the floor—the impact echoing loudly in the curiously vaulted ceiling—that I noticed the horror had stopped screaming.  

With the mallet still gripped tightly in my hand, I moved to the door and placed my trembling free hand on the knob. With the mallet poised to strike, I threw open the door – and found myself facing the sallow wall of the old home.  

I spun around, but instead of finding the cold, cobweb-draped atelier, with its old books and moldering furniture and worktable, I instead saw the barren and sunlit room I had entered seemingly hours before. And there, immediately beneath me, was the chair, with its nail-clawed armrests.  

Somehow, I’d been transported back to the regular world.  

I’d won against the nightmare.  

But still, something felt odd, *I* felt strange in a way that wasn’t quite physical, but subtler than that. A vague tension seemed to smolder beneath my scalp, as if there existed a new, previously absent layer between my brain and skull. It wasn’t alarming, so much as unfamiliar; but even as I noticed it, I grew more accustomed to it, and before long I was almost comforted by it. As if it acted as a protective, insulating layer against….I could not and still cannot say what. 

It's a strange thing, but oh well. What harm could there be?
