It started with the mirrors. A crack appeared in the bathroom. It snaked across the surface, frozen like a lightning bolt. Mom said it was a bad omen. I laughed it off. She stopped using the bathroom mirror. Her reflection, it seemed, became a stranger she couldn’t trust.

Mom had quirks. Salt lines on windowsills. A broom upside down behind the door. A jar of pennies buried in the backyard. I didn’t question it. It was Mom being Mom.

Then it escalated. Cracks spread to all reflective surfaces. Not just mirrors—windows, glass frames, the TV. Mom covered them with sheets. She muttered, "They’re watching." I asked, "Who’s ‘they’?" She wouldn’t answer. Her look mixed pity with fear. 

Hours, she paced. Her hands scrubbed raw. Furniture moved in bursts. One night, at the kitchen table, she carved loops into the wood. A dull knife in hand. Spirals formed. They seemed alive under dim light.

“Mom, what’s this?” I asked, voice trembling.

“Keeping them out,” she whispered. “They’ll seep through the cracks.”

I started feeling it too. The air turned heavy. Corners stretched deeper than they should. Shadows shifted when I blinked. Silence wrapped the house.

One night, a sound woke me. A soft tap echoed in the hallway. I followed it. Mom crouched near a mirror. The sheet lay aside. She stared at her reflection. Her fingers tapped the glass.

“Mom?” I whispered.

No response. Her eyes stayed wide, locked on her reflection. Her real hand tapped. Her reflection’s hand stayed flat. Then it blinked.

I froze, breath caught. Mom turned. Her face pale, gaunt. “Do you see it?” she asked, trembling. “It’s not me. It’s them.”

I wanted to deny it. I saw it too. The reflection smiled, cold and lifeless. I pulled her away. I covered the mirror. But the damage was done. The house, a trap now.

The patterns spread. I found them everywhere. On walls. On floors. On my shoes. I scrubbed, sanded—they returned, intricate and sprawling. Watching eyes pressed through every crack. Even in empty rooms, they were there.

Mom became frantic. She drew loops on paper, hands moving without pause. I tried stopping her. She screamed. Her voice, guttural, wasn’t hers.

“If I stop, they’ll take us,” she cried. Her grip bruised my arm. “They’re halfway here!”

I couldn’t understand. Was she insane? Or was the house infected? Whispers came from walls. Dreams plagued me. Smiling reflections, teeth too many.

One night, she stood in front of the largest mirror. The sheet gone. She spoke to it, voice urgent.

“I did what you asked,” she pleaded. “Leave him alone.”

“Mom!” I grabbed her, pulling her back. The mirror cracked further. I saw my reflection. Its eyes weren’t mine. A hand pressed the glass. Cold brushed my arm.

Mom screamed. Pure terror. “It’s too late,” she sobbed. “They’re here.”

By morning, she vanished. The front door stood open. All mirrors shattered. I searched. She was gone. The house empty, except for patterns. They etched every surface.

I see them now. Shapes move in cracks. They wait, watching. My reflection smiles, not at me. For me. It knows something I don’t.

Mom’s gone. But I think I’ll find her soon. The cracks spread. The whispers grow louder. They’re almost [through](https://www.reddit.com/r/t5_d30zcz/s/94aaHDNy1m).
