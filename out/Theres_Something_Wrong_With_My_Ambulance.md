Hey so I kinda stumbled upon here from a mix of podcasts and suggestions from friends to talk about this whole issue on here. I honestly can’t tell how many of you are having experiences like mine or just making things up as “scary stories” for those podcasts I mentioned but I have to put this into writing. I need to get it out somewhere.
See, I’m a little embarrassed to admit how shaken I am by this whole thing. Let me give you some important context before we start swimming up shits creek.
Im an EMT. I got certified through a scholarship from my college, and worked as a volunteer on campus for a few months. It’s about what you’d expect from a college, lots and lots of intox calls and kids who took too many edibles, plus a healthy mix of genuine injuries caused by alcohol, edibles, or harder drugs. We don’t get more than 4 or 5 calls on the average weekend night, but it’s still pretty exciting and a good community.
Anyway, this summers my first real job as an EMT. I’m working for a big private EMS company in Massachusetts, getting paid a solid amount of money, but that’s also just because we run IFTs. 

For those of you who don’t know much about EMS, there’s basically two kinds of ambulances: 911, the ones that you think of when you think of an ambulance, and IFT, or inter-facility transfers. 911 trucks are the ones where you have gun shot wounds and cpr and all that excitement, IFT trucks are basically just Ubers for people who either can’t drive or need some sort of monitoring while they’re driven from one hospital to another, or to their nursing home or dialysis or whatever. Basically our whole patient population is people you’d picture when you think of lots of health issues and very limited mobility- bariatrics and geriatrics. 
Anyway, I run IFT so we get paid well cause we have insurance for all our patients, so the EMS company makes good money off them. The people actually saving lives on 911 trucks, the actual heroes of EMS, get paid like… 25% less. Welcome to the hellish nightmare that is the American healthcare system.
Alright, I’ll hop off my soap box and talk about the nightmare I’ve been experiencing inside the nightmare of healthcare. 

It started with what should have been a nice shift. Mid-July, temperature in the mid 70’s, in a nice new ambulance with good AC and a nice partner, a guy named Chacha who I’ve worked with a few times and get along with well. He’s sharp as a tack- moved to the US from Kenya, where he grew up, for college and is working as an EMT while applying to med school. He wants to be a neurosurgeon and I have no doubts he’ll make it. 

Anyway, I rolled up to base around 9:45, tapped my employee ID against the scanner to open the garage door, tucked it into my pocket, and started checking out our ambulance for the day, number 99. I made sure all our meds were up to date, and we were all set on gas, oil, and oxygen. The basics. Chacha rolled in a few minutes later, dapped me up, and we got going.

The issue started with our very first patient. See, Cha and I switch off every 3 patients, meaning you spend 3 driving then 3 in the back with the patient and so on and so forth until the end of shift. On the average 12 hour shift you’d have 5 or 6 patients, so we usually only make it through one cycle. 
We radiod dispatch our usual “Brigham Ambulance 99, you have EMT Harlow and EMT Chacha on until 22:00 tonight.” 
Dispatch responded right away. “Good morning 99, glad to have you boys on today. I have a patient ready on arrival at the Northshore Medical center going down to a rehab in Boston, the address is on your tablet. No needs no precautions.” Pretty standard for us, although we did roll our eyes at the hour long drive to start our morning, but it meant we’d probably burn a couple hours on this patient alone. We radioed dispatch to say “99 received, we have Northshore” and hit the road.

After a quick stop at Dunkin, we rolled into the Northshore parking lot around 10:30, pulled out our stretcher, and went in. I waved a sarcastic salute to Mitch, our liaison who sits at the desk at Northshore, and we took the elevator up to our patients floor. As we walked in, we had to walk down the hall to the nurses station for a report and paper work, and we walked past a handful of patient rooms. I have a bad habit of peeking into the rooms as we walk past them, mostly just out of boredom but I also like to tell myself that one of these days I’ll catch a patient in an emergency and run in like a superhero to save the day.
But back to reality. I looked into 800 and saw an old man sleeping, and then looked into 802 and I nearly jumped, only managing to avoid it because I knew it’d be embarrassing while at work, not to mention putting on a face of confidence is 90% of EMS work. 

In 802 I saw an old woman, I guessed around mid-80s, sitting in the chair in the corner of her room. Not in the hospital bed, not in the bathroom, on the chair for visitors, wearing only a hospital gown. As soon as I looked into the room she locked eye contact with me, and the whole time had a huge, blank stare, and I could tell she wasn’t all there, but not in the usual way. I’ve had a lot of patients with dimentia or Alzheimer’s, and they have a way of trying to put on a polite smile, like they’re embarrassed to realize they’re confused but don’t want to be rude by making it obvious. This woman’s smile, on the other hand, showed me she was completely aware of where she was, and although I couldn’t tell you why I thought this, I immediately felt some malice behind that smile. “You’re here to pick me up!” she called out, and I politely replied “Haha, maybe! We’ll see what the nurse says” to which she replied “you’re picking me up.” I let out a polite chuckle and my partner and I continued wheeling our stretcher down the hallway. I looked back at Cha to see if he had picked up on the weirdness to that conversation, but he had his head down and an air pod in, focusing on a soccer game on his phone. 

I don’t know what it was, but as I stood at the nurses station waiting to meet with our patients nurse, it was like I couldn’t stop shivering. I felt something was very wrong with the interaction I just had, and the fact that I couldn’t tell what was so wrong about it made it far worse. I’d had dozens of bizarre interactions with old people at this job, hell just a couple days ago a patient on this floor insisted I was her husband and would “recognize her as soon as they let her change out of her hospital gown!” For some fucking reason though, I knew this wasn’t that old people confusion. I had this intense gut feeling that there was something very wrong with this woman. 
That nervousness combined with my zoning out as I thought about the interaction resulted in me jumping in response to a folder being slapped down next to me. I actually physically shook in response to the sudden noise, and spun around to see the obvious cause of it- the nurse had come to give report. I was embarrassed about it, not only cause she caught me off guard but because she was a very sweet middle aged nurse I’d met a couple times, and she jokingly said “didn’t mean to wake you!” Which made us both awkwardly chuckle. 
“No worries, just a long shift, gotta get your naps in somewhere right?” I said, which got a polite chuckle from her. “You’re here for Brittany, right?” She asked.
I double checked the name on my tablet. “Yep, Brittany Saldare. We have the floor number but no notes.” (If it’s not obvious, all the patient names are changed from their actual identities. With all this bullshit the last thing I need is a HIPPA breach.)

She gave me a quick report, pretty basic stuff. “Okay, Mrs. Saldare is a sweet 84 year old, pretty far from “all there” mentally. Not alert or oriented, she’s nodded or shook her head once or twice but hasn’t spoken to us. DNR DNI, copy of her MOLST is in the folder. Advanced Alzheimer’s, had an unwitnessed fall at her hospice care and they had her come here just to get checked out. Nothing broken, ct, X-ray, and mri were all what we expect from an old lady. I think her not being able to talk meant they got spooked she might be in a lot of pain and just not communicating it, but she also has zero mobility so I don’t really know how she fell in the first place. We assumed it was out of bed but they said they found her in the hallway. Anyway, she’s good to go. Quiet and immobile but chill.”
I nodded as I typed basically everything the nurse said into the narrative section on my tablet. “Sounds good. We have an address in Boston for a rehab, but she doesn’t have any injuries from the fall?” 
“Oh yeah, we were confused too. The coordinator called over and got confirmation, it’s a rehab but one floor is hospice care, they have like 5 patients that are all very, very, very wealthy. Like, private nurses and doctors for each room wealthy.” 
I laughed, “Jesus, every hospital everywhere is severely understaffed but old people on DNR DNI orders have private doctors. What the hell.” 
“Right? Like… it’s not like they’re gonna do anything if you die.” 
We both laughed, I asked for a couple signatures for my paperwork to confirm I got report from the hospital and patient care had been transferred, and I told the nurse I was all set. She started to walk away when I called after her “oh sorry one last thing, what’s her room number?”
She turned around and called out “802” with a polite smile. 
“I- okay. Thanks.” 

I dropped my tablet and the folder of paperwork on the back of the stretcher and put on a pair of gloves before leading Cha to the room. “She’s immobile, so we can just drag the sheets to move her. Not oriented so take it slow.” 
“Sounds good bro” cha replied, AirPod still in listening to his soccer match.
“Who’s winning?” 
“France.”
“Who do we want to be winning?”
“Not fucking France.” He said, looking up to half smile.
“Ah I’m sorry bro” I said with a slight laugh. “Let’s meet Mrs. Brittany.”

I mentally prepared myself for that bizarre smile again, but was caught even more off guard when we walked into her room and the corner chair was empty. I knocked on the door to her room, a politeness everyone is taught in EMT school, and quietly called out “Hello Brittany, we’re here to take you down to Boston!” She didn’t respond which felt weird based on her just talking to me a couple minutes before, but the nurse said she was nonverbal so I thought maybe I imagined the whole thing somehow? I had worked a lot recently, but I really hoped I hadn’t gotten to the point of hallucination. 

That thought completely vanished from my mind as we turned the corner into her room and I saw her sitting in the hospital bed. She was the exact woman I had seen sitting in the chair, although I was glad to see the smile was gone. She looked like she was asleep, sitting peacefully with her eyes closed, breathing through her nose.

She looked just like a thousand other patients I had had before, but it terrified me to know that I had absolutely never seen her before I looked into her room a few minutes before. I ran a few mental laps trying to figure it out, because I just knew she had been in that chair. How could I recognize her? I couldn’t have hallucinated her exact appearance without ever seeing her before. But if that was her, that’s even more troubling than if I’m hallucinating, because just one look at her told me she could not have walked to the chair, and especially not walked back to the bed in the few minutes we were talking to her nurse. 

I swallowed my fear to try to avoid Cha noticing my weirdness, and gently rubbed her arm through the sheets before saying “Hello, Mrs. Saldare? We’re here to take you to rehab.” Trying my best to sound confident and polite, in spite of the fear still coursing through my veins. She didn’t open her eyes, just continued to slowly breathe through her nose, but she nodded her head twice.

Cha and I quickly got her ready to go, adjusting her bed height to match our stretcher, putting down the hand rails, and grabbing the sheet under her. We made eye contact and I said “on three. One. Two. Three.” At which point we both lifted her up, Cha pulling her towards him and onto the stretcher while I pushed her away from me and off the bed. As we lifted her, her head rolled towards me as if her neck was made of rubber, and I swear to god for just a millisecond that horrible, blank smile was back. 

Cha and I know eachother pretty well, and when I didn’t immediately walk around the bed to buckle her into the stretcher, instead pausing for a second to look at her, waiting to see if the smile would return, he said “You good bro? I’m tryna get her going so we can stop for lunch on the way outta Boston.” 
“Yeah.” I replied “sorry just, yeah, let’s just get moving.”

I strapped her onto the stretcher and we rolled her out of the hospital, loading her into the back of our ambulance and getting ready to go. Cha climbed in the front seat and leaned his head back to the small rectangular window between the driver/passenger seat and the patient compartment. He called out “you all set?” And I replied “yep, let’s get going.” He confirmed the address with me and I double checked it in the tablet before he replied “okay. 55 minutes with current traffic.” 
“Sounds good” I replied, before settling into the seat next to the stretcher and beginning to look through her paperwork from the hospital while I typed it all into the tablet. Her file was pretty standard, nothing much that the nurse left out other than a fucking ton of painkillers. I remember thinking to myself “Well I guess that explains why she’s practically comatose, I’ve never seen someone on that many opioids without ODing”. 

I sat there in silence as we began to drive, just quietly tapping away at my tablet, crossing my T’s and dotting my I’s, saying the classic EMS prayer of “please don’t get me sued and please don’t die while I’m responsible for you” for about the first ten minutes of driving. Suddenly, out of nowhere, I was hit with this immense sense of dread. My chills returned, and I realized with my head buried in the paperwork, I hadn’t looked at my patient in a few minutes. Suddenly I became acutely aware that she was looking at me. It was like all my senses were suddenly firing in overtime, and I just knew that the second I lifted my head from the tablet I’d be met by that god awful smile again. I had these battling feelings of “holy fuck I need to never look up” and “if I don’t look up right now something awful will happen” that continued to wrestle for control until I eventually was able to calm down and convince myself I was over reacting. “You’ve driven a hundred old ladies before, you’re getting in your own head” I thought to myself, internally chuckling at how silly it was to be so scared of a woman who couldn’t even move. 

I half smiled at myself for conquering my fear, and the second I lifted my head, the smile I saw wiped mine clean off. Brittany was awake, staring directly at me, and had that terrifying smile back. It was like there was no thought behind it, a slack jawed smile that somehow simultaneously flexed every muscle in her neck and face into a horrific attempt at a smile that couldn’t be less comforting. I sat there for a beat, just holding eye contact with her, before I finally swallowed the dry spit in the back of my throat and said “H-hi Brittany. How are you doing dear?” 
She responded with a disgusting whistling breath from the back of her throat, like a harsh wind through thin branches, and I swear I could see her yellow, rotten teeth shake. The whistling turned into an almost hiccuping sound as she let out a “Hu-hu-hoo!” With that nightmarish smile not leaving as she attempted to speak.
“Brittany? Can you breathe okay?” I asked, trying to justify this insane behavior however I could. Maybe her airway was blocked? Maybe she needed to be put on oxygen? Just as I tried to comfort myself with these thoughts, they were cast out as she began to cough.

“Honey, are you okay?” I asked as she continued to cough. After maybe ten seconds that horrible feeling overtook me again. 
I realized what it was just a second later. She was coughing, but it was like she was just mimicking a coughing sound. Every time she coughed it was exactly the same. A strong, phlegmy noise like she was trying to clear her throat. The same exact noise over and over. After another beat I realized the other reason it was fucking me up- she wasn’t moving at all. Usually when someone coughs, especially in a coughing fit like this, their core flexes and they sort of bend over, not to mention you usually change the shape of your mouth to that O shape as you cough- her mouth remained flatly open, which somehow was less comforting than her nightmarish attempt at a smile. 

She sat perfectly still, not moving at all as she continued these violent, identical coughs. I didn’t know what to do, all my training flew out the window and I just stared at her, completely unsure how to react. She stopped coughing abruptly and her smile returned for just a moment, her teeth gone from yellow to a grimy, disgusting black, like a long abandoned pool covered in a dozen layers of algae and bacteria. 

I felt myself frown. With my more than a thousand hours of EMS experience across my time as an EMT and working in an ER before that, I’ve gotten incredibly good at putting on a confident face, but I just couldn’t hold it up anymore. I was fucking terrified by this woman. And then she spoke.

“Hello Harlow.”

I was stunned. I didn’t know how she could know my name, I didn’t expect her to talk, I had no fucking clue how to respond. I just stared blankly at her, equally scared, confused, and surprised.

“Harlow?” She said again, turning her head sideways like a dog trying to understand an unfamiliar word from its master. Suddenly I was the one who couldn’t speak.

I paused for far longer than politeness would allow, but by god I just knew that if I responded something horrible would happen. I couldn’t hold it in any longer. “Hi Brittany” I said, my voice barely above a whisper as it croaked past my lips. 

“You’ll have to speak up Harlow, I’m hard of hearing honey. Brittany said, and I swear I could watch the blackness shrink back from her teeth and into her gums as her smile seemed to become more human like. 

“I… hi. Hi ma’am. How are you feeling?” I asked, summoning up all my strength to put my practiced fake confidence face back on.

“Oh, like I’ve slept a thousand years.” She said, with an awful, deep, guttural laugh that was absolutely unprompted from that bizarre sentence. 

“Oh. That good?” I asked, again desperate to find some footing in this awful conversation.

“Just fantastic.” She said, her voice becoming more normal. Just then, my phone buzzed from my front pocket. “Girlfriend?” She asked.

“Maybe,” I said. “Sorry I’d put it on mute but dispatch and the field supervisor sometimes call our cell phones.” 

“No worries.” She replied, and for a flash her teeth turned black again “I wouldn’t want you to leave your girlfriend waiting” 

“I’m sure it’s nothing” I said. Trying to create some normality, I asked “are… what medications are you taking?” Turning to my tablet as if i was asking for work, but I could feel how the awkward question hung in the air, an obvious attempt to change the subject.

“We both know that’s in my paperwork Harlow” she said. “Now. We haven’t seen eachother in so long, how are you?” 

I felt the air go cold in the back of the ambulance. I knew, I mean I absolutely knew that I had never seen this woman before in my life. But she was so fucking certain she knew me. I just didn’t know what to say as I grappled with the thought, but I finally settled on the most obvious answer: she was confusing me with some other EMT. 

Old patients like her probably take ambulance rides a couple times a month, and besides I’m a pretty default looking person. Tallish blonde white guy isn’t exactly a rare breed, especially in northeast mass. Besides, she probably just saw my employee ID and that was how she figured out my name. Suddenly I was incredibly embarrassed to have made this into such a big deal. I mean sure the teeth were freaky, but I also could definitely have just imagined that thanks to how high my adrenaline was. Besides, I’ve had old patients with botched plastic surgeries that looked far weirder than her when they smiled- 80 year old skin doesn’t look good with 30 years of Botox and a stroke or two mixed in. 

I finally felt like I had reached the shore and tied up each of the loose ends I was spooking myself with by imagining. I also knew my sleep schedule was pretty fucky at this point- I’d slept maybe three hours the night before? I’d let myself stay up much too late listening to some stupid scary story podcasts and was probably just getting way, way, way too far into my own head. 

After all these mental gymnastics, I finally replied “oh, I’ve been good. Really enjoying this job. How have you been dear?” And I could tell my fake confidence voice was back to nearly 100 percent.

“Oh I’ve been good. Sick of the hospital though.” She replied, her mouth hanging open awkwardly at the end of the sentence.

“Yeah I bet. I’m glad we’re taking you to a rehab instead.” I replied, with a polite smile.

“Oh dear me too. You’re so sweet. Now how is that girlfriend of yours?” 

I realized she almost definitely was thinking of someone else’s girlfriend, so I tried to makeup a generic enough story to not embarrass her by making her realize I’m not the person she thought I was “she’s, she’s good. Hard at work!” 

“Oh good. What’s she doing for work?”

I realized that hopefully meant she didn’t know much about the girlfriend she was thinking of, so I just answered honestly. “She’s interning just outside of DC for her local government. She lives down there and we’re long distance outside of the school year.” 

“Oh how sweet. I’m so impressed you kids can do long distance like that. What’s her name again?” She asked, sounding completely innocent, and I felt that all my paranoia was nothing more than unwarranted fear.

Despite this, I still couldn’t decide if I should be honest. I struggled with it because I felt bad lying to this sweet seeming old lady, but my anxiety was still pounding in my head like a war drum. I finally folded. “Laurel.” I answered, honestly.

“Oh Laurel, what a sweet name!” She said, smiling. Her smile was still not right, but better than earlier. I studied her teeth and saw none of that black film remaining. “We must be getting close now, aren’t we?” Brittany asked me.

“I uh…” I leaned forward slightly, getting an awkward diagonal angle out the side window of the ambulance. I saw a handful of nondescript buildings pass by, realized I had absolutely no clue where we were, and replied “yeah, probably not much farther.” With a slight smile.

“Okay deary. I think I’ll get some shut eye and get ready for our big day!” She said, and for a glad that black film returned to her teeth. 

“Oh, okay. Can I get you an extra blanket or anything, or are you okay?”

“Im just fine deary. Thank you Harlow.” She relied before laying back down and almost instantly returning to her state before our conversation, eyes shut and breathing quietly through her nose. 

I sat for a moment thinking about the bizarreness of the whole interaction, and suddenly realized the blanket had come down slightly and her shoulder was now revealed. I leaned forward and adjusted it, and as I did so I felt a sharp poke into my hip from my pocket.

I sat back onto the seat and dug in to see what it was, pulling at the rectangular piece of plastic before flipping it over and staring blankly at my own smiling face, wrapped up in a small blue rectangle on my employee ID
