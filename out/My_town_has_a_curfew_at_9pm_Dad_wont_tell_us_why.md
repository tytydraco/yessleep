I remember my first night here, unpacking my belongings with my brother, Johnny. He was the first to notice the big red envelope in the mail that said, in all caps: MANDATORY SAFETY PROGRAM.

Johnny and I were far too young and inexperienced to comprehend the contents of that envelope, so naturally, we passed it on to our father. As he began reading, thinking it wasn’t anything too concerning, his expression abruptly shifted from tired and uninterested to shocked and revolted. He exclaimed out loud, "Curfew at 9pm?! For all citizens?" Then my brother, who had always been the curious type, asked him, "Dad, what’s a curfew?"

"It means you boys can’t stay out later than 9pm, and neither can anyone else. At least for the next year or so…" my father replied, sounding strained.

"But why is that?" I asked, intrigued and visibly upset.

"I don’t know," my father answered, evidently lying while keeping a straight, serious face. Despite the repeated questions we asked him during our stay in the town of Skinvalley, he kept his answer limited to just this one phrase: "You stay out late, you won’t come back." I heard him say it so much that it’s still deeply engraved in my memory.

As the weeks turned into months and the months into years, my brother and I reached the age of 16. And believe me when I say it, after 5 years of living with this curfew, we gradually began to give into it. One day, the curiosity mixed with that rebellious feeling only a teenager can possess, and the boredom of our ridiculous town got the better of my brother.

At first, I didn’t notice anything. Nothing seemed out of place. It felt exactly the same, and that’s probably the scariest part. In most cases, you don’t notice it before it’s too late. Some won’t be able to accept it, others can’t understand the phenomenon, but only those who act upon it turn out victorious—victorious in this case being the equivalent of survival.

My father made a big mistake—not telling us the truth left us unprepared.

He gradually attempted to persuade me with the idea that the curfew wasn’t real.

"Jake, aren’t you sick of this lie that’s been plaguing our town? Aren’t you ready to see the real world?" Johnny spoke in his usual tone.

"You know very well there’s a reason we can’t go outside."

"Is there really one, brother? Have you not noticed our father keeps it a secret? Has it not occurred to you that perhaps there is no secret?"

That really put me off, but I quickly recovered with a confident answer: "Our father is doing the best he can to protect us, and I believe in him."

The next day, Johnny began to lose his patience, and when he realized I couldn’t be talked into it, he resorted to plan B: eating me.

I was watching TV when I heard a knock on my door. It was Johnny, of course. He came to finish off his mission, and he would have very well accomplished it if I hadn’t noticed one small detail—Johnny never once knocked on my door! As he made his way into the room, I greeted him with a question: "Hey, bro, you’re here to wish me happy birthday?"

He quickly played along with it: "Yes, of course. I even have a present for you," he smirked widely, and that’s when I was sure this wasn’t my brother. My birthday was due in 8 months!

"Before you give it to me, I really ought to go to the bathroom."

After excusing myself to the toilet, I headed for the garage, picked up Dad’s gun, and loaded it with the special bullets he kept for "hunting." I said my prayers and went to look for my father. I checked every inch of the house, including the basement, but he was nowhere to be found.

"To hell with this!" I exclaimed aloud, and that’s when I felt a tap on my shoulder.

"Jake, are you ready for my surprise?"

I instantly went into survival mode, my heart pounding fast with adrenaline. I took a couple of steps back, pulled the safety off, and shot the monster in its head. It finally revealed its true form: a distorted humanoid appearance with unnaturally long limbs, patchy fur, elongated claws, and a pair of glowing red eyes. No doubt, this was a skinwalker.

It shrieked loudly at me. Instead of covering my ears, I shot it another 7 times in the head. It didn’t die, but it was certainly affected. I managed to make a run for the garage to get my only hope of survival: a bullet coated in white ash. I knew my father had one somewhere, because it all made sense now. Dad had told us stories about skinwalkers. He told us how they could be defeated, but he never once mentioned that they were real.

I broke open the glass cabinet with the emergency supplies and grabbed the bullet. Only one bullet, so I had a single chance to survive. I had to get the perfect shot. I took a deep breath and waited for the skinwalker to come in. As soon as he saw me, he charged at me, but I shot him right in the head.

I couldn’t believe it—I had slain a skinwalker. I broke down in tears, realizing that this meant my brother was certainly gone forever. I sat there for what seemed like an eternity until, from the door, emerged my father.

I was so happy to see him, I ran to hug him. "Dad, I’m sorry I had to… It was Johnny. He got replaced by a skinwalker, just like in your stories. I couldn’t—"

He interrupted me with a finger to my lips. "Shush now, Jake. It’s time you and I take a walk outside."

He smirked morbidly.

"No, no! This can’t be… you too, father…"

He returned to his original form and began breaking my body apart. He started to eat the meat off my legs and left me to rot there until he was hungry again.

In the meantime, I saw that same envelope Johnny found in the mail the very first day we got here, and so I read it:

This is not a joke. This is a mandatory safety program for all residents:

In the town of Skinvalley, both humans and skinwalkers live in peace, thanks to an agreement between the mayor and the skinwalker community. After 9pm, the town belongs to the skinwalkers until sunrise. Any human that fails to respect the agreement can be hunted down and replaced. We beg you to respect the curfew!

"Why didn’t Dad just tell us… If only my brother hadn’t been so stupid…"

The skinwalker is trying to convince me to go outside, but I’d rather be its food than let another skinwalker replace me. That would only allow them to hunt my friends, too. As I’m writing this, my time has probably come to an end. He’s losing his patience, and I think the taste of human meat will make him finish me off.

I was right—he’s coming right now. If anyone ever finds this, I discovered their weakness. I know how to end the curfew. You just have to…
