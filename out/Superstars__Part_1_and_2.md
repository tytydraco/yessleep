Scene 1 - The Motel

The only light that flickered in that dark, empty, and cold street was the motel sign on the other side of the road. I gazed at the asphalt, wet from the recent rain, slippery even. I wanted to cross to the other side. I needed to, if I wanted to get to that motel. Would I slip if I tried to cross it? Would I hurt myself? Drop on my head? No one around to help me. I grinned at the thought.

As I stepped onto it, I saw my reflection in the puddle, another light on the corner, a car entering the dark street. I stepped back reluctantly. I waited for the car to pass, and it did, fast. I wished I had crossed before I saw it coming. What if it hadn’t seen me and just hit me? Would the driver stop to help? Or just flee? It didn’t matter. I was still unsure if I should cross the street. That motel looked decayed, but it was better than some alley. I stepped onto the slick asphalt.

Already on the other side and on my way to the motel, I sighed, not in relief, but regretting nothing had happened again. I couldn’t slip. It looked so wet and slippery. Guess these shoes saved me today.

The shoes, an old pair of Superstars I had since forever. They looked battered and worn. They were supposed to be white with red and blue stripes on the side, but now they were yellow, and the straps were all darkened. I didn’t care. It could be worse.

Why was I thinking about my shoes in this situation? I asked myself as I walked toward the motel. The big motel sign started flickering faster as I approached. As I stepped into the parking lot, the “O” turned off in “MOTEL” with an electrical short circuit noise. An ominous sign? I wished.

I crossed the parking lot into the reception, a big no vacancies sticker on the bulletproof glass, and a fat guy snoring inside. Just my luck.

I turned around. The drizzle had started again, thin, light, cold. I shivered, starting to feel a little desperate and out of options.

“Hey! Who’re you?” said a voice behind me. I turned around and saw the big fat guy, not snoring anymore. No, now he was leaning against the counter behind the glass.

“Want a room or what?”

I gazed at him, not sure if he was just stupid from just waking up, or stupid at any other hour of the day. I flicked my eyes to the sticker on the glass, then back at him.

“Oh, that? Never mind that. It's just to keep people from bothering me, unless they REALLY need a room.”

I couldn’t hide the incredulous look on my face as I sneered at the old fuck. “I REALLY need a room,” I finally said.

“Your ID and the money…” he said, pointing at the other sticker on the glass. $40 dollars per night.

“I have the money. Just don’t have any ID on me…”

He raised his fat eyebrow and grinned, leaning forward a bit. “That won’t do, sir…” he said slowly, with a tone that made it obvious he was plotting something stupid in his fat brain. “You wake me up and don’t even have an ID?” he said, yawning, without even covering his fat mouth.

My hope for a warm bed started diminishing again as I looked around, the cold crawling inside my jacket.

“But I’m feeling benevolent today. If you’re generous enough to make a donation to this charity work I’m doing…”

As if this obese mammoth could do any good to anyone.

I slammed $100 on the counter and passed it through the small hole at the bottom of the glass, separating us.

“Room 103,” he said, passing back the keys while licking his lips and looking at the money like it was some fat burger.

I inserted the key into the keyhole of room 103's door. I turned it, it clicked. I flicked the handle and opened the door; it creaked as I pushed it all the way open. I stepped inside and closed the door behind me, it creaked again until it shut completely. I pressed the light switch, illuminating room 103.

The floor was uneven, made of wooden planks. The ceiling too. On the walls, there were carpets with stains and mold, some peeling off here and there. The bed looked old, this would be a creaking symphony at night. At least the sheets looked clean.

On the wall, there was an old TV holder, but no television, just the promise of it. I finally stepped farther into the room, and with each step, the floor let out a new creaking note. What if the wood broke under my next step? Created a hole in it? Nah, I’d hurt myself and have to live with the consequences.

What if hands started pulling me into the hole? Would I try to resist? No, they’d pull me deeper, drown me. My heart beat faster. I couldn’t breathe. The hands dragging me down, deeper and deeper into… hell?

I finally took a breath, remembering I wasn't that lucky.

I opened the bathroom door. It was surprisingly clean. Old, but clean. I still wouldn’t risk taking a bath in it. Dropping on my head? Sure. Hit by a car? Cool. Hands from hell pulling me into a sinkhole? Awesome. But catching some nasty disease and rotting in a disgusting hospital bed? Nuh-uh. I’d rather die. I chuckled at the irony.

I heard a strange noise the moment I sat down. Aside from the bed creaking, as I expected, it made me think of this old kettle I had when it started whistling, only lower, with less pressure, coming from the wall. I ignored it. Wasn’t in the mood to go prowling.

I took off my Superstars before crawling under the, seemingly clean, sheets. I couldn’t sleep. Anxiety was too overwhelming. I hadn’t gotten hit by that car. I hadn’t slipped on the asphalt. At least I thought I could sleep and just fast-forward a few hours of my life.

What I wouldn’t do for a cigarette right now. Go back out there in the cold and ask one from the fatso? That I wouldn’t do. So I just stayed put.

My thoughts flickered to the bathroom door as I imagined a hand crawling out of it, a putrid, skeletal hand followed by a head staring at me. No eyes in those sockets. I felt something icy and wet sliding beneath my sheets. I turned my head the other way and looked at the curtains. Eyes behind them stared through the small cracks.

I shivered. The hair on my arms stood up.

Just my imagination.



Scene 2 - The Fire

Somehow, I had fallen asleep, but it felt like I woke up immediately. Screams echoed outside, the sound of people running, loud thuds, and doors slamming.

I jumped out of the bed, it protested with a loud creak. I flung open the door, and a shirtless man in his mid-40s immediately shouted at me, “Hey! Get your ass outta there!”

I froze, confused. Why should I?

Then the smell hit me, something so familiar it knocked the breath out of me. It took me back years ago, to some random weekend on the beach, lighting a fire at night, roasting marshmallows. That smell of dried wood burning.

Fire.

I snapped back to reality.

“Are you deaf? Get outta there, you crazy fiend!” the man yelled again. This time, I ran.

I sprinted toward him, toward the edge of the parking lot, and by the time I reached the small crowd gathering there, I was panting. I turned around, and just as I did, room 102 exploded. The one right beside mine.

“Oh my God!” an old woman cried out.

“I was the first to catch the whiff of fire and ran out here,” said a scrawny figure in eyeglasses standing next to me, a little to proud of himself. “Didn’t see anyone come outta that room. You think there were people inside?” he added.

I ignored him. I couldn’t care less. The only thing on my mind was that my Superstars were in flames, I’d forgotten to put them on in the rush.

It was already late afternoon by the time they managed to recover two scorched bodies from room 102. According to the documents found in their car and the fat asshole’s testimony, they were an old couple in their 60s. Rumor had it they were traveling across the state to surprise-visit their daughter. They’d decided to sleep at the motel instead of pushing through the night because of the earlier rain and fog. Supposedly, they were only a few hours away from their destination.

I didn’t get a look at the bodies, but some said they died peacefully, choked by gas leaking from the heating system and smoke in their sleep, before the fire got to them. I kept wondering: if they hadn’t stopped at all, would the fat bastard have put me in room 102 instead of 103? Death by fire didn’t thrill me, but dying peacefully in my sleep, not even realizing I was dying? That had a certain elegance. I grinned.

The papers wouldn’t have liked me much though, no sad, shocking headlines for someone like me. Not like the old couple.

I saw it all unfold from a bench in the motel’s parking lot, from the explosion, to the firemen arriving minutes later, putting out the fire, and eventually pulling the meat off the stove. By the time they were done, most of the guests had already bailed. Grabbed their crap and disappeared. The fire only affected two adjacent rooms, 101, and mine. Plus that scrawny guy’s place.

“Are you related to the victims?” an officer asked, walking up.

“No, but I was in the room next to them, 101,” the scrawny guy answered, a little too enthusiastically for someone surrounded by burnt corpses.

“Did you manage to take everything of value when you left your room?”

“Yes, sir! As soon as I caught the sniff of fire I grabbed everything and, ”

“Good! Then you can move along now.” The officer cut him off like a butcher carving pork. I chuckled as the guy whimpered and shuffled away.

“And how about you?” the officer asked, now turning to me.

“I’ve got something valuable in there I hope to recover,” I said, trying to sound vague but sincere.

He gave me a long look. “Which room were you in again?”

“103.”

“There’s no one booked in 103, according to the guest list we pulled from reception. May I see your ID?”

Fuck. The fat bastard not only ripped me off, now he was tossing me into trouble too.

“It’s one of the things in my room that I hope to recover,” I replied, keeping my voice steady.

Somehow, it worked. He didn’t press. “This’ll probably take a few more hours before they clear the building,” he said, turning away to rejoin the other officers.

“I’ve got all the time in the world,” I muttered.

I waited. For a few more hours. And then a little more than that. The firefighters finished sealing the gas leak and set up a perimeter, tape and makeshift fences, with help from the cops. Surprisingly, no news trucks showed up for live coverage. The cockroaches usually love this kind of garbage.

There were a few reporters, though. Hovering, asking dumb questions.

The only one who noticed me was this old vulture, looked like a skeleton with melting wax for skin. I could almost see through him. Not true... but I wished it was.

“Hey, fella, I see you’ve been sitting here a while. Were you staying at the motel when the explosion happened?” He leaned in with a mini microphone, like this was some juicy exposé.

“Look, I’m just waiting for the officers to clear the place so I can try to recover some things from my room.”

His eyes lit up. “Ah, so you were in one of the affected rooms? Did you notice anything strange? Your information could help the police, you know. Help figure out why the room blew up.”

“What good would it do to know the why? The two old sobs are already barbecued.”

His eyes widened. He gasped. Like I’d slapped him with a dead cat. He turned around and hobbled away on those creaky bones.

That’s when I noticed the officer from earlier looking at me again. Not just him, some of the others too.

Trouble.

I wasn’t leaving without my things. Namely, my Superstars. Scorched or not, they were mine.

But I wasn’t in the mood to be scrutinized, not by cops, and definitely not by some bony-ass journalist with a handheld mic and a guilt complex.
