Dear diary,
Hello! It's nice to meet you. I'm sorry if that sounds weird but I like to say hello to things even if they can't say it back. Today was my 21st birthday and it was the best birthday ever! I'm moving into my flat tomorrow and I've got a job interview too at that new coffee shop. I am really sad that I'm leaving the home that me, my sister and my brother grew up in but I'll only be down the road. My two younger siblings have already said that they want a sleepover at the flat once it's done and I've happily said yes. Oh! Mom's calling for the cake, I hope it's chocolate. Bye!

-it seems she didn't write in it again for two days-

Hello again,
Something weird is going on and it's creeping me out. After going to bed two nights ago, I woke up and was ready to pack my stuff but when I went down stairs, everyone was preparing for a party. I asked if this was a going away party but my dad laughed slightly and said 'No, this is your birthday party. Your going away party is tomorrow silly.' This confused me, a lot. I just nodded and walked into the kitchen and looked at the date, March 19th. That couldn't be right, surely. I asked if the dates had been mixed up because today should be the 21st, I should be in my flat, I should be waiting at my laptop to see if I nailed the interview. This isn't right.

-The next entry was more bizarre-

No... No. I looked on the internet for whatever is happening to me and in stories, people write about other people being in a time loop. Is this happening to me? Am I in a time loop? Then why aren't my journal entries disappearing? Why am I remembering everything?!? Aren't people in time loops meant to forget the day? I haven't! I've had 3 birthdays so far, I've got the same gifts, the same cake, the same friends and family come over! Do they know? I'm fucking scared right now. I guess this day 3 of the time loop, I'll write again soon.

-The next couple of entries were the same thing until this next entry-

I can't do this anymore. I've repeated the same day 7 times and it's all the same. I only changed a few things, instead of chocolate, I asked for a vanilla cake. Mom was surprised but she agreed, I told dad I wanted the party in the front garden and he happily moved everything, hell I even told my sister and brother if I didn't like the gifts, they could have them! They were over the moon of course but I knew what they were. It's a 'new' morning I guess and... I can't do this. I'm gonna go to the bathroom and end it all. If this stops the loops, I'm sorry for I've put you guys through, I will always love you all.

-the next page showed it had water stains on them-

I can't die. I CAN'T FUCKING DIE! I tried to kill myself yesterday, hell I think I did! I cut my wrists and it hurt, a lot. I lied in the tub until darkness took me but then... I woke up. I gasped as I sat up, the marks on my wrists were gone, there was no blood on the floor or the bathtub. I might try other ways of ending it, maybe there is a way. I need to find a way out. I'm losing my mind.

-a few more pages had ramblings in them about trying different ways of dying but with no success, the next page was different as it had blood stains on it-

I've killed them. I just walked down stairs, grabbed a knife and... Killed my family. I first cut dad's throat, he struggled a bit but that stopped, mom didn't struggle however, she just cried. Then my siblings, I took care of them quickly... Everyone will arrive for the party soon so I'll end it here. 

-the next page had blood and water stains-

I'm sorry! IM SO SORRY! I'm never gonna hurt my family again. Madness had taken over me yesterday and I just... Snapped. I woke up with a gasp, I quickly checked on everyone and they were alive! I looked odd but I gave a big hug and apologized so much, they asked me what happened so I told them I had a dream about hurting them which made me break down more. They hugged me for felt like hours and everything felt normal again. I asked if we could just watch movies and eat popcorn all day and we happily did, even my brother and sister were happy to eat sweets and watch movies. It is almost midnight and everyone is fast asleep downstairs, I might join them.

-the next few pages explained that each time she woke up, she changed her party. She said they went to the pool, bowling, to the pub and many other places. The next page was a change of pace.-

Since I'm stuck in this loop, I'm just gonna call my friends and ask them to meet me at my house. 
It's been a few hours and I had a great time with my friends, I know I ditched my own party but I've already had so many. We had an amazing meal, we went into the woods and we had a camp fire. I also admitted my feelings to Jason, I've had a crush on him since I was 16  and... He also admitted he liked me too, we even kissed. We took a group photo on my phone, hoping it will save. I guess I'll find out tomorrow. It's tomorrow and luckily, it did save. I'm kinda glad I remember, I wish someone else was with me in this loop then I wouldn't feel lonely.

-the next few entries were about her hanging out with her friends and doing fun things like visiting their hideout in the fields, going drinking at night and even one page was talking about how she slept with Jason.-

I don't know how long it's been, days, months, years? I've never felt so lonely, I know I have my friends and family around but... It's not them, not the real them. Not to me. I might just stay here, in my room for a few loops, by myself. 

-they reached the middle of the journal where there was one last entry-

I'm leaving, I don't know how or where but I'm leaving. If you find this journal, my name is ----- ------ , I am 20 years old (probably older because of this fucking loop) and I'm stuck in a time loop! Please help me. I don't care how or where, I want out.

-Her dad was the one who found the journal but not his daughter, they have been searching for years but there's one problem...it's only the 20th of March, 2023.-
