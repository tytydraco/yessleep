To start, I work from home. Which means of course my days very often just... blur together. Wake up, coffee, laptop, meetings, yada yada yada, you get it. The apartment always stays quiet enough that I can hear the refrigerator cycle on and off, and my downstairs neighbors either shouting or turning their tv volume too far. But for recounting the events I have to say nothing had ever gone missing here. 

Yesterday morning, my toothbrush was in the kitchen sink. 

See, I always keep it in the mirrored cabinet, top shelf, blue cup, always facing bristles out. Why? No clue, just how I always do it. So seeing it laying flat in the sink felt extremely wrong. I stood there for a long time, trying to remember if I’d been half asleep or distracted or maybe even if I remembered sleep walking or something. I laughed it off, figuring the stress from the holiday season had just worn me down so much that I was losing it. 

All day though, little things felt slightly misplaced. My desk chair wasn’t tucked in all the way. The toilet paper was off the roll and sitting behind the toilet. My refrigerator light bulb was sitting on the eggs. I told myself this is what happens when you don’t leave the house enough. Your brain just crashes. I kept thinking of all those documentaries I'd seen talking about how insane stress and solitude can make you. 

So to get a good laugh out of it all last night, I set my phone up on the dresser, angled toward the hallway. I honestly believed that I'd most likely just see myself getting up. Wandering around. Carrying out my day to day habits while asleep, like on auto pilot. Maybe subconsciously I also wanted proof that nothing was happening. 

I feel like I slept poorly, but the recording went for the whole night. 

For most of the night, I just tossed and turned in the bed. But at 2:17 a.m., something moves at the ceiling vent. Slowly opening it, turning the rectangle sideways and at and angle to pull it into the ceiling. 

A thin, almost nude man drops down without a sound, unfolding himself slowly like one of those circus performers with extra joins. He’s extremely emaciated and lanky, maybe a little over six feet tall. He's close enough to the camera to tell that he doesn't actually have any eyes, only clumped scar tissue. He stands very very still, head tilted, listening. I remember feeling frozen to my seat when I first watched the video back. 

He moves through my apartment with a patience that scares me. Like a silent turtle. He walks out of my bathroom with my toothbrush, turns it in his fingers, smells it, then presses it briefly to his tongue before placing it to the floor. He does this with other things too occasionally when passing where the camera can see him. Some knives, medicines, and random decorations. He returns to my room then sniffs my shirts and pants before laying them back on the laundry basket. 

Then he stands in the corner of the living room and just stands still. He's painfully still. He doesn’t sway. He doesn’t fidget. He just waits, facing the wall. Hours pass on the timestamp, and he doesn’t move at all. 

At 3:41 a.m. I wake up to use the bathroom.
On the recording, he reacts instantly, sliding backward into the hall closet with an impossible speed. The door doesn’t open, his body drops to the floor silently and slides under. It looked like how mice or other small creatures can fit through far smaller holes. 

I pass the closet on my way back, rubbing sleep from my eyes, completely and utterly unaware. He doesn’t come out until I’m back in bed, once again oozing out from under the door. 

At 6:12, three minutes before my alarm is scheduled to go off, he moves again. This time he crawls up the wall in a spiderlike fashion. He disappears into the vent the same way he came out, soundless and careful. Placing the vent back on. 

The alarm goes off. I wake up. I enter the bathroom, then return to my phone and end recording. I found the recording while drinking my coffee, sitting by my front door where I'm writing this now. I watched it twice. There are no glitches. No cuts. No explanation that makes me feel better. 

I have alerted the police and have already gotten most of my things packed and moved into my friends house. This is the cops problem now. Although, I haven't been able to find my toothbrush, and for some reason that really bothers me.
