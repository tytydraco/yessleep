The first thing I noticed when I woke was the absence of seagulls, every coastal morning of my life had started with them putting on a display of annoyance but here, there was nothing. Just the slow, heavy breathing of the ocean.

We moved quietly, gathering our gear without trying to wake the locals we crashed with. The salt pouch Kanoa had given me sat heavy in my pocket, if for nothing else, I figured it would be a good souvenir.

The canteen below smelled faintly of last night’s fish and woodsmoke. Kanoa was already there, leaning on the counter with a mug in one hand. He didn’t greet us, just nodded once before finally speaking.

“I suggest you dive fast and you come back faster. Get what you’re here for and get the hell out of there.”

Mara tried for a smile, leaning an elbow on the railing. “Oh, we’ll be fine, but I’m glad to know you care, big guy!”

Kanoa didn’t smile back. His gaze was fixed on her, unblinking. “If the water is warm where it shouldn’t be, you need to get out of there as fast as you can."

Thomas frowned. “You mean… currents?”

Kanoa shook his head. “I mean what I said.”

“Warm water happens all the time,” I cut in. “Thermoclines, hot vents, all kinds of stuff. Not exactly a red flag.”

“That’s not the kind of warmth I’m talking about,” Kanoa said quietly. “It’s not from the earth, it’s from something else.”

Mara raised an eyebrow. “Something else? Like what, underwater volcano gods?”

Kanoa’s expression didn’t change. “You joke now but when it wraps around your legs, when it feels like it’s breathing against your skin, you’ll remember what I told you.”

A silence stretched. Even the gulls seemed to have stopped calling for a moment.

Mara’s smile faltered.

“I’ve fished these waters my whole life,” Kanoa said. “The sea can be dangerous in a hundred ways you can see coming. This one, you won’t, It feels wrong before you even know why.”

Thomas tried to laugh but it came out thin. “Alright, point taken. Warm water, turn back. Got it.”

Kanoa’s gaze swept over each of them in turn.

Kanoa seemingly more agitated cut back in "you all aren't from around here, you have no idea what you're up against. Truth be told, even my people don't know exactly. We've all been raised on a million different stories and legends but we all know that the music in your ears when you're under water leads to death."

From there we left and went outside, I still remember that the sky was a pale, bruised pink and the way the sea stretched flat and still toward the horizon. 

The boy from the night before was crouched near a coil of rope, watching us.

“You’ll see them,” he whispered as I passed.

I stopped. “See who?”

“The wives. They’ll look at you like they’ve been waiting a long time.”

Before I could answer, one of the women from the canteen stepped out of a doorway, seized the boy by the arm, and pulled him inside. She didn’t look at me once.

The skiff was loaded with tanks, fins and the recovery bag for the drone. As we untied, Mara called to Kanoa from the bow with a friendly wave.

“If we’re not back by lunch, send someone after us!”

Kanoa stood on the dock, arms crossed. “If you’re not back by lunch, I'll know you're not coming back."

Julian laughed but it was an uneasy laugh.

We motored out past the headland, the village shrank into a cluster of leaning rooftops and the jungle beyond looked almost black under the morning light.

I glanced back one last time. Kanoa was still on the dock, a still, dark figure against the pale water. Even from that distance, I could tell his eyes were following us.

I turned and my crew was ready to head for the dive of our lives. 

If only we knew how on the nose that phrase would be.
