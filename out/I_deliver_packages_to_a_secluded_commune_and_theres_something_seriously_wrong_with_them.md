I've been a delivery driver for 4 years now, but just a couple of weeks ago, I was given a new area to service. This place was rural, and I mean *really* rural. We're talking one-stoplight towns and fields that stretch for hours in every direction. I'm surprised we even deliver this far out. As someone who loves the solitude of the countryside, I didn't mind the change.

In my new area, I found myself delivering packages to a small commune tucked away between the middle of nowhere and a cornfield. In the span of just two weeks, I'd made five deliveries to this place.

They were about three feet tall, two feet wide, and two feet deep. They had markings on the outside, but not with pen or pencil or anything. It looked like someone took a great big magnifying glass and held it over the package on a sunny day, burning the symbols into the cardboard with a shaky hand.

Every day I've had one of those packages on my delivery truck, animals would get to actin strange. A lot of folks have dogs in this part of the Great Plains, most of them friendly little furballs that run up to my truck with great big slobbery grins. When I have those commune packages, though, even the friendly dogs growl at my delivery truck. I even parked close to a couple cows once, and they all took off like I grew twenty feet and charged at 'em.

The weirdest part is the little sounds the packages sometimes make. Just three days ago, I was delivering one of those packages. It fucking talked to me. It whimpered, "help me," in the same disoriented way my little cousin Ann would say after she woke up from her surgeries. The packages don't talk very often— just enough to make me question if I'm going a little bit insane. I do know there's not anyone inside them or anything because the packages are pretty light, so it must just be a recording or something.

Every time I deliver one of them packages, everyone in the commune is out, waitin' to receive it. They always wait in front of the house it's addressed to like chickens outside a coop. Some of the younger kids start jumping up and down when they see my truck, great big grins cracking cross their faces and little eyes glimmering with excitement. The adults don't hide their enjoyment either— they're usually laughing and clapping with glee when they catch sight of my truck.

Curiosity got the better of me, so I decided to ask around in the neighboring town. At one of my next stops, there was an old man sitting out on his porch, rocking back and forth in his creaky chair. I handed him his delivery, exchanged pleasantries, and decided to bring up the commune.

"Do you know anything about that commune down yonder?" I asked, trying to sound casual.

He squinted at me, tobacco pipe in hand, his thick country accent putting my college-tainted southern twang to shame. "Well now, folks 'round here say that place ain't quite right. They don't talk with us, and we just leave 'em be. Best not stick yar nose where it don't belong, son."

I thanked him and drove off.

Yesterday, I stuck my nose where it don't belong. The commune got another one of those packages, and I wanted to see what was inside. I don't normally give a shitdick about people's packages, but when the fucker starts begging for help, well, I get invested. 

I hatched a plan. Yesterday, I decided to save their package for last and deliver it at night. Everyone in the commune was out waiting (do they have nothing better to do?) when I delivered it around 8 PM. I drove my truck away like normal, down around a bend in the road and a dip between the hills. I parked it and ran the mile along the edge of the cornfield back up to the commune. When I got close enough, it was pretty clear that they were all gathered in the main house, where all the packages were addressed to. I could see shapes moving in the window, and every other house's lights were turned off. 

I crept up to the big house and poked my head up to a window. There were no walls in the entire house— just one massive, primordial room. The floors, walls and ceiling were covered in those strange burn markings that were on the packages. It looked like someone gave the entire place one big, intricate henna tattoo that those wannabe preppy girls were always on about.

The people of the commune looked downright silly. The motherfuckers could have been klan members, only some of them were clearly black skinned. They all wore head-to-toe bleach white robes, like togas made from thin sheets that were pinned up all helter skelter with safety pins. Every single one of them, including a babe in its mother's arm, had on a pointy white hat. Their feet, though, were bare. I thought I left the no shoe thing back in West Virginia, though I guess some things must be cross-cultural.

They were singing in latin. Never in my life did I think I would use my fuckoff high-school latin class, but the good Lord has a way of putting the right person in the right place for things to make sense at the right time.

They were shouting, "BEZUUL! BEZUUL! BEZUUL! SUME HOC SACRIFICIUM!". At first I wasn't really sure what Bezuul meant, but I put it in Google translate right then and there and realized it must have been a name. They were saying "Bezuul, take this sacrifice".

They started shifting, going in circles around one another like a cool new honky tonk I'd learn late into a Saturday night bar run. I could see the package in the middle of the floor between their spinning robes, and that fucker was shaking like a leaf in a thunderstorm. One man stopped his gangly dance, approaching the package with a bejewelled dagger outstretched. He sliced it open in a fluid motion, the others seeming to dance faster and harder than I thought was possible. I guess if you get enough of these packages, you get pretty darn good at the dance that goes with it.

He peeled back the cardboard, revealing a wooden box underneath. He had to put a hand on it to steady the shaking thing. Taking the dagger, he pried open the wooden box.

Everyone screamed, nearly startling me outta my skin.

"Veni ad nos, Bezuul," they chanted, over and over. This time I knew Bezuul was a name, so they were telling Bezuul to "come to us". They continued dancing and chanting with an inhuman frenzy, spinning in circles and waving their arms.

A young woman, the one who had the babe earlier, dropped to her knees next to the dagger man in the center of the room. She stretched out flat, face up, splaying out her arms and legs in a way that lined up with the burn markings on the floor.

Suddenly, the markings pulsed white with energy, filling the room with an industrial glow. I couldn't quite make out what was in the box next to her, but I could see them both shaking in rhythm with the pulsing white energy that coursed through the burn marks.

The woman stood up, everyone else fell down.

Her eyes were now the color you see when you peer into the bottom of a well. Not just black, but empty. She surveyed the room, gaze coming to a rest on the box.

She spoke with a gravelly voice that could not be her own.

"Very good. My people, I am almost ready. I am almost strong enough to take form in this realm," she uttered, speaking slowly, "finish the ritual, feed me the demon."

The man took the dagger, plunging it into the wooden box. Hundreds of voices filled my ears, screaming together in discord. 

He reached in, removing a writhing, wrangling girl's doll. Stepping onto the box, he pinned the squirming thing to the ceiling with the dagger, matching it up with the henna lines.

The woman laid down again, same as before, also matching up with the lines. As soon as she lay, a black goo began dripping from the doll. It stretched toward the woman's face, as if reaching for her empty eye sockets. The goo made contact with her, and immediately the doll went limp.

When she was finished sucking goo out of the doll with her eyes, the woman stood back up.

"One more demon, one more meal, and I will rise. Your loyalty over the past decade will not be forgotten. I will be the first spirit to rise since ancient times, since our ways were forgotten. My people, rejoice tonight, for it is nearly finished."

She collapsed, limp on the floor.

I had seen enough devil worship. I took off toward the cornfield, but I was too slow. I heard the door open behind me, and someone shouted, "HEY!"

The moment I realized I'd been spotted, my heart leapt into my throat, and my legs started movin' without any conscious thought. The cold sweat that had been forming on my brow now streamed down my face in warm splotches as I sprinted toward the cornfield, the tall stalks offering my only chance at escape.

As I plunged into the field, my shoes sunk into the muddy earth, and I could hear the cult member's footsteps pounding behind me. Their white robes and hats made them appear like ghosts in the moonlight. Panic swelled in my chest as the stalks closed in around me, slicing at my face and arms.

My lungs burned with effort. I could hear their rabbid chase, growing closer and closer, their cries sending shivers down my spine.

"Find him!" one of them hollered, "Don't let him escape!"

Their barks spurred me on, each footstep slapping against the wet soil with a feverish determination. I couldn't afford to falter now. If they caught me, I knew my fate would be worse than anything my soggy assbrain could imagine. I struggled to orient myself, desperately praying to everything holy for a break in the endless sea of green.

Suddenly, a glint of moonlight caught my eye— the familiar shape of my delivery truck. Relief washed over me, rolling through my limbs and into my stomach. The cult members were still hot on my heels, and I was only moments away from escape.

As I swerved toward the truck, I fumbled for my keys, my fingers trembling with adrenaline. I could hear the cult members closing in, their cries echoing through the night. I threw open the driver's side door and leapt in, my hands shaking as I jammed the key into the ignition.

The engine roared to life just as the first of the cult members broke through the cornstalks, his eyes wild with fury. I slammed the truck into gear and stomped on the gas, mud spittin' from beneath the tires. 

My heart pounded in my ears, my breath coming in ragged gasps as the reality of my narrow escape set in. Good Lord. What the hell am I gonna do when the next package comes in? Should I quit my job before then? No one's going to believe me.
