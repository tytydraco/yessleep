Look, I understand. What I am about to recount may not be original or outstanding, given the very nature and purpose of this platform, however, this was a real experience that left a real mark on my soul. Just like you, I used to hear it many times, you know, the usual: they are among us, in another dimension, invisible most of the time and even that their number surpasses that of the world's population.

One thing that I have learned about them is that they can be classified according to the elements they operate in, and as a former fishing enthusiast, I had the unfortunate experience of encountering one of them in a lake near one of my previous addresses.

Nothing ever happened on that lake before everything started in 1984, at least from my perspective. I often took my little boat to fish just to spend some time and think about random things or whenever I was too lazy to buy food at the nearest store. One night, I just lied on the shore near the lake, much aware of the incoming rain, trying to relax after a long day at work. As soon as the first drops of rain landed on my face, I stood up and was struck by the view of something that did not belong where it floated. Right in the middle of the lake where the waters are of course the deepest, a small cabin was floating, mildly agitated by the increasing wind. I could tell that there were no poles underneath, since it was turning around itself and slowly drifting away like an empty boat. Visible from its unique and opened windows, there was a dim light that might have come from a candle. I almost called out to whoever dwelled in such a strange habitat, but at that point, the rain had matured and I had to find shelter in my house. It took me hours to realize that there was no possibility to rationalize what I had just witnessed or even tell it to friends without them trying to convince me that I had hallucinated, therefore, I decided to head back to the lake, under the rain, but equipped with a camera this time. Unfortunately, the house seemed to have disappeared a long time before I arrived at the shore.

Remaining positive about what I saw, I decided to keep watch, waiting for another opportunity to present itself. I waited for days, tiring myself with some investigation that I did not enjoy anyway and eventually gave up after over a week, choosing to stick to the one purpose that always brought me to the lake: relaxing. One night, I decided to spend some time fishing in the middle of the lake, equipped with my radio and a bucket full of water besides me in the boat, under the watch of a stunning full moon. I had never caught so many fish before in my life to the point that the bucket was full, therefore, my plan was to return to my house, empty the bucket and then come back for more. However, the moment I turned the boat around, heading to the shore, something was slowly drifting towards me from my right. The more it got close, the more I refused to acknowledge what I was actually seeing, trying to stick to something that made sense.

It was a bed. A entire bed, nicely made and all white, dressed with silk white sheets from which a very pleasant perfume seemed to emanate.

My first intention was to wait until the bed was within reach, so that I could inspect it, while also having bitter regrets about not having my camera, but, call it fear or instinct, the more it got close to the boat, the more I felt uneasy, sensing that something was certainly not right about the phenomenon. Was it the bed or something else that caused that feeling? I am still wondering to this day, because soon after, a long, pale, seemingly human arm emerged from the waters and landed on the bucket. Gripped by an instant panic, I stood up, almost forgetting that I was on a boat in the middle of the lake. I made several steps backwards and still had enough time to witness the strange arm lift the bucket and rapidly plunge it in the waters, before I ended up falling into them myself. 

The shore was the only thing I was thinking about, so I just swam my vision fortunately helped by the moonlight. No matter what that being was, it seemed massive, from the pale body mass I could glimpse while underneath the waters. The creature did not try to do anything. I did not feel any pull or any hand grabbing my leg, so I just continued making progress in absolute panic, alternating from swimming below and above the water surface. When I almost reached the shore, something even stranger occurred, almost paralyzing me in my momentum. Each time I was completely underwater, I could see about 5 shadows, 5 persons standing on the shore completely immobile and just watching me trying to save my life, but every time my head was out of the water, there was not a single soul on land. I decided to ignore the strange occurrence and crawled my way out of the water and looked behind me when I felt safe enough, only to see my boat overturned with no sign of the bed or the mysterious being.

What on earth was that thing? I asked myself glad to be on land, unaware that I could have been the first known casualty of some kind of legend from the area. 

According to the knowledge I gained, doing subsequent research about my encounter, it bears a name I refuse to mention and it is said to manifest in, on, or near the waters, by creating sceneries that should not normally occur, like a freaking bed in the middle of a large body of water. Also, touching that bed would have been the end of me. Many did not believe me when I shared my experience, and many disappeared as a result, but at least I tried to warn. So now you also know as well, if you are swimming somewhere during the night and anything seems off, do not try to make sense of it, even if it is in your own swimming pool. Storm out of the water!
