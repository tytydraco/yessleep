Not a noise. Not a flicker on a screen. It’s a visual anomaly, like someone cut a hole in the world and filled it with the snow from a dead television channel.

I don’t remember when it showed up; maybe it’s always been there. But I remember the first time I really noticed it. A month after I moved in, I was watching something on TV when it caught my attention. In a corner of the apartment that usually goes unnoticed, blending into the white-painted bricks, there’s a patch of space that’s just… static.
At first, I thought it was a trick of the light or maybe some dust in the air catching the glow from the TV. But no. It was something else entirely. Every time I look at it for more than 30 seconds, or try to properly inspect it, I get overwhelmed with intense nausea. So, I’ve taken to ignoring it. It doesn’t show up on any of my cameras, so I can’t document it.

I’ve shown it to friends when they visit, and the moment they see it, they try to leave as quickly as possible. They never want to come back.
It’s been the same for weeks now. No change, no expansion, no flicker of movement like I feared, just static. Still and unsettling, as if it’s frozen in time. A scar on the fabric of reality, suspended in place. I’ve tried to ignore it, but there’s a weight to it now, a pressure that hangs in the air, filling the room with an invisible tension I can’t quite place.
I’ve caught myself staring at it for too long a few times, waiting for it to do something. Anything. But it never does. It stays still, just like the first time I noticed it. I’ve gotten used to the nausea when I try to look directly at it. The way my body reacts feels almost instinctual, like my mind is telling me, don’t look too closely. But I can’t help it. Sometimes, when I’m alone, I’ll stand there, looking at it, waiting for a change. But nothing does. It’s just... static.

The only movement is the occasional shift in the air, a subtle, imperceptible pulse that makes my skin crawl. I can’t shake the feeling that whatever this thing is, it’s tied to something deeper, something that doesn’t belong in this world at all. I can’t tell if it’s part of the apartment or part of me now, like I’ve somehow been tethered to it.

Maybe it’s God’s blind spot.

I’ve thought about covering it, putting a picture over it, or a shelf, or even a curtain, something to block my view. But something about that feels wrong. I can’t stop thinking about it. The more I try to push it out of my mind, the more it creeps in, sneaking into my thoughts when I’m not paying attention.

Since first noticing the static, I’ve been having this recurring dream. I’m in my lounge, watching the static when it disappears with my blink. At first, I’m filled with an overwhelming joy, relieved that it’s finally gone from my life. But it’s not that the static disappeared; it’s that I’ve been transported to a different room entirely. A small four-by-four room still with the white-painted bricks of my apartment. There’s a single chair in the center, almost inviting me to sit.
As soon as I do, the static appears once again, opening up before me. Through the void, I see another version of myself, trapped underwater. I’m struggling to swim upwards, but invisible hands are dragging me down—tugging at my skin and hair. I fight and fight, but it’s no use. I drown. My body sinks deeper and deeper, pulled toward a glowing light at the bottom of the abyss.
The view shifts. I see police pull my bloated, waterlogged body from a local lake. My skin is pale and swollen, eyes bulging.

I then jolt awake in my bed.

Even when I’m awake, the dream haunts me. Each time I close my eyes, I’m back in that room, trapped with the chair, staring at the void. The more I try to pull away, the more it pulls me in.
The worst part is, I think I know where it’s leading.
I don’t know when it will happen, but I can feel the moment coming. Soon, the static will swallow me whole, just like it swallowed that version of me in the water. I’ll blink, and this time, I won’t wake up. I’ll be the one drowning.
And maybe... maybe when they find my body, they won’t just pull me out of the lake. Maybe this time, the static will follow.
