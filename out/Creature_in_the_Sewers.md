At night, I was walking home along a deserted street. In my hands, I held my smartphone and was watching a new video. The cool night air brushed against my face, and the streetlamps flickered intermittently as I focused entirely on the screen.

Completely absorbed in what was happening on the screen, I didn’t notice the asphalt giving way beneath my feet. At first, I didn’t even realize what had happened. I fell through the ground. I grabbed the edges of an open manhole with my hands and one foot. My smartphone, still playing the video, tumbled down. A splash marked its landing in the sewer waters. My hands and legs ached from the impact, while my other leg dangled inside the shaft. I could feel the cold metal biting into my skin, and the echo of dripping water surrounded me.

I cursed. I didn’t want to lose my phone.

A dim light glowed below. On one side of the shaft, metal rungs descended. I moved over and began climbing down to retrieve the phone.

The metal rungs were wet. My boots slipped several times. The stench of the sewer filled my nostrils.

About halfway down, another smell joined the stench of the sewer. It reminded me of something… like a rotting, unknown decay. A shiver ran down my spine as I tried to steady myself against the damp wall.

Reaching the bottom, I looked around. In the dim glow of the lamp overhead, I saw a tunnel stretching further. Its floor was submerged in dirty liquid. On the other side, a hollow in the wall revealed something that made my blood run cold. A heap of human corpses. Some were missing arms and legs, others were only partial bodies, torn at the edges as if someone had devoured them. The stench of rot I had noticed earlier emanated from them. I stumbled backward, my heart hammering, unable to tear my eyes away from the grisly sight.

As I stood in horror staring at the pile of bodies, splashes of dirty liquid sounded behind me.

I turned in terror and saw a tall and skinny figure standing in the twilight of the tunnel, about thirty feet away.

The hairs on my head bristled with even greater fear. It was not human. Its bald head tilted to one side. Two fires glowed in its eye sockets. Long arms with elongated fingers and claws reached forward as if it were preparing to pounce on its next victim — and it seemed that this time, the victim was me. A cold sweat ran down my back as adrenaline surged through my veins.

I lunged and scrambled onto the metal rungs, climbing frantically. I don’t remember how I made it all the way up. It felt like I had soared to the top.

Lying on the asphalt, I caught my breath. Suddenly, a searing pain shot through my leg. I spun around and saw a long, blue claw clutching my leg just above my boot. It stretched out from the sewer hatch. The creature’s bald skull emerged from inside. Fiery lights in its eye sockets glared at me with hatred. The terrifying claw began dragging me toward the open hatch. I screamed in horror and kicked wildly, trying to break free. A few of my strikes hit their mark and distracted the creature for a moment. Its claw released me.

I got to my feet and ran.

In the following days, I avoided that street, returning home by other routes. I was left with a wound on my leg, as if from a burn. It took a long time to heal and left a prominent scar in its wake.

I bought a new phone. My old device had perished irretrievably in the sewer tunnel’s filth — or so I thought… until recently.

Strangely, I received a message from my old, drowned phone number.

It read:  
*"I’m hunting you."*
