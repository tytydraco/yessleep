for privacy reasons i will be calling them alex  


my cousin lives in another city and i visit alex from time to time i noticed their weird behavior this usually starts at midnight sometimes i think they're crazy they scream so loud all of a sudden and it freaks me out and they keep talking to me about random stuff alex assumes they were given the soul of dead people and tells me all about it for example Nikola Tesla they tell me that they have a duty to complete and save humanity and also other historical figures  


for some reason alex despises people of certain countries that i wont be mentioning and being racist towards them and tells me that they need to get rid of these people and their countries  
alex has a weird habit of taking pictures of dead animals and tells me that dead animals are so pretty  
at night while I'm sleeping they stare at me just standing there doing nothing but staring at me it kinda creeps me out but i try to ignore it

 they walk in their sleep and i hear them talking about really weird stuff one time i heard them talking about a plan to kill somebody i don't remember alex telling me about they talked about how they would stab that person many times in the heart and cut their head off and do other horrific things i was so shocked hearing this the next day i really wanted to know who is that person alex was talking about but i was too scared to ask them  
also i found in their room a glass of red liquid it looked like blood but i was trying to convince myself that it might just be some red paint or something and when i asked them about it they told me with a creepy smile that its blood and they asked me if i wanted to try it i thought they were joking and that its just fake blood so i said yes and drank it it tasted salty and weird i still don't know what was that thing i drank but i hope its not someones blood  
alex really hates their neighbors they always talk bad about them and tells me that they are horrible people alex tells me that they wish the neighbors were dead and when i asked them why they said that i wont understand i insisted on knowing why as i was so curious but they get mad every time i ask that question  


alex has a really weird diet they love meat so much and i mean SO MUCH i think it is the only thing they eat they hate other food that any person would eat they don't eat fruits or vegetables or sweets or anything else just meat i once asked them why they dont eat anything other than meat they said that everything else that humans eat tastes bullshit and one time i told them to try some ice cream and i told them that it tastes really good but alex seemed to be really disgusted by the ice cream and said that they would never eat something like that    
I'm staying at my cousins for the rest of the week, what should i do?
