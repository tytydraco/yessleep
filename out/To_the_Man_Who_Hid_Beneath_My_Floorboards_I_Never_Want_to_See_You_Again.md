I live in a modest apartment on the top floor of an old building, with nothing above me but a dusty attic. When I moved in, I thought I was finally escaping the chaos of my old shared place. The neighborhood was quiet, my neighbors kept their distance, and the attic overhead felt reassuring, like a buffer between me and the night sky.

I first noticed something strange one evening as I was drifting off to sleep. In the silence, I heard cautious footsteps directly above my ceiling. The attic was supposed to be sealed off, so I told myself it was probably rats, maybe a stray cat. But the next night, at the exact same time, the footsteps returned. Soft creaks, the sound of fabric brushing against wood,like a body trying to move silently. Feeling uneasy, I questioned my landlord. He insisted: “No one has accessed that attic for years, it’s locked and empty. Probably just the old wood settling.”

I wasn’t convinced. I propped a chair under the attic hatch. It was secured with a heavy, rusted padlock. Yet the following night, I woke to a gentle groan of hinges. The hatch had shifted. The padlock still hung there, but slightly angled, as if it had been opened and carefully put back. My heart hammered so violently I felt dizzy.

The next morning, I bought a small camera and positioned it high on a wardrobe, aiming it at the hatch. That night, the noises came again, subtle and measured. At sunrise, I replayed the footage with trembling hands. The hatch lifted a fraction. A pale, grimy hand emerged through the crack, groping in the darkness as if searching. Not an animal’s paw, this was unmistakably human. Someone was up there, suspended in eerie silence, watching me sleep below.

I called the police immediately. They promised to send a patrol and urged me to leave the apartment. But it was late, and the idea of stepping into the night felt worse. I grabbed a kitchen knife, barricaded my door, and sat on my bed, trembling and listening.

Around 3 a.m., I heard a scratching sound, this time beneath my bed. My blood turned to ice. The attic was above, not below, how could anyone be under my floorboards? I pressed my ear to the wood. The sound repeated. Something was crawling, slithering in a space that shouldn’t exist. I remembered reading that the building once had another level that was later sealed off. Could there be a hidden crawlspace, just large enough for a desperate, deranged person to nest in?

I wanted to run, but fear held me in place. Suddenly, the noises crept toward my front door. I heard it strain and creak as something tried to force it open. I dialed emergency services, voice shaking, pleading for help. They said the patrol was close, told me to stay calm.

Then, the pounding on the door stopped. Silence. Agonizing minutes passed until the police arrived. They searched my apartment thoroughly. Nothing. The hatches were closed, no sign of a break-in. I was half-crazed, begging them to check the attic. Finally, they forced the lock. Inside, they found old boxes, scraps of food, a filthy blanket, and my name carved into a beam. Tacked to a wall were candid photos of me taken from outside my own building, at different hours. The officers looked unnerved. They found no alternate exits, no tunnels. Just a cramped space that reeked of stale sweat and something sinister.

I fled that same morning to a friend’s place. The next day, I returned briefly for my belongings. In my mailbox was an unmarked envelope. Inside was a single Polaroid: me, standing in my living room the night before, talking to the police. The photo had been taken from inside my apartment.

Somehow, he had outsmarted me, eluded the authorities, and watched me from every angle, above, below, through walls I once thought solid. I’ll never know how he slipped in and out unseen, never learn his name. But to the man who lurked beneath my floorboards and in my attic, if you ever read this, know that I would rather lose my mind than ever meet you face-to-face. Don’t ever come back. Not ever.
