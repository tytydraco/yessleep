Fear had turned to misery, and misery to depression.

Weeks had passed, and my life had turned into something else entirely. I was a shell of my former self. I was fearful when this began, when my husband wasn't my husband. Now, I was just an empty vessel.

Any hope I had of things going back to how they were, of my Jay being himself again, had turned to numbness. My emotions had drowned out, leaving me feeling like a bloodless corpse. And yet, it hurt to see him there. A part of me screamed and clawed within, watching my husband hanging limp, ropes tied around his wrists, binding him to the wooden beam of this chamber I found myself in.

Maya watched him with a wild look in her eyes. There was something about that woman; something that I couldn't place. It was like a spider staring down a fly that had given up fight. She had bags under her eyes from the sleepless nights and days she had spent with Jay.

Jay took in a breath, wheezing. He spat down onto the rough floor of the tiny chamber.

"Chudail...." He breathed out.

The word seemed to excite Maya, as it always did these past weeks.

The Hindi word meant, "Demoness". After the long rituals she performed on him, Jay would often had fits of madness. His outbursts first terrified me. His howls sounded inhuman. The first time I had to witness the ritual, I fainted. It wasn't something a person should have to witness.

When Maya looked upon Jay the first time after I drove her home from the airport, she was quick to want to take him to her 'Aashram"- a monastery for healing. She even arranged for some help to bring Jay with us. Desperate for help, I accepted.

"Take this." Maya had said, handing me a tiny white pill. "It will help keep your head clear."

I complied.

"You must be strong. What's coming is hard, this month will be difficult and you will need to be patient." She said, putting a hand on my shoulder.

"What's wrong with him?" I asked her as two men helped carry a weary Jay out of a car at the Monastery.

"It's..." She said, looking onto him. "It's hard to say exactly, but it's not a possession. There is no such thing. It's very....strange."

I looked around the Monastery, and surprisingly, it was very dull. It wasn't far from us- a basement in a warehouse. By dull, I mean there was nothing to indicate that this was a monastery. It was just tiny maze of rooms with the same dusty floor. There was no religious imagery of any kind. Nothing at all.

There was a dining hall where everyone ate on the floor next to a tiny, contained fire, where meat was seared. From what I learnt about Hinduism the past couple of days, the priests are usually forbidden to eat meat. This was odd to me at first but I accepted it as a lack of knowledge on my part. My ideas about the world and my reality had been shattered completely, I was beyond questioning things. Not even questioning what animal the meat was from.

There was a sleeping area with mattresses on the floor. The walls were bare, and the only entertainment in there was cleaning up from time to time. I was allowed to leave, and I would get out everyday or so to get some fresh air and maybe get some groceries. Maya had asked me to limit my mobile usage at first. I rarely used my phone at all. There was no signal down here. The little time I would get with my phone was when I was outside. I would often update Jay's family but that was mostly about it. My mother in law was disappointed and even concerned by the work Maya had been doing, but I refused to give up just yet. Eventually, I cut contact with her after she became irritable.

At nights, I heard whispers from where Jay slept- the middle round room of the monastery, where he was tied up on Maya's orders. I was tempted to check in on him, but Maya had warned me against it. She told me that whatever entity had made its way into our lives was especially violent at night. The pill Maya handed me helped with the nightmares. My mind would swim in the blackness, thoughtless and void of any feeling until the morning.

Maya's loud chanting and drumming in the morning usually woke me up. Jay watched her as she did her ritual next to him. She had never touched him, but it looked like whatever she did hurt him. Sometimes her chants would make him cry, sometimes it made him laugh frantically. The ritual was always done in the early hours, while it was still dark outside.

The rest of the day just passed by normally. There would be people down there other than her and me, people who came in to see Jay. Sometimes a man who looked like a lumberjack came in. He was tall, with thick arms and had a southern drawl. He would check Jay, much like a doctor would, and then leave. Sometimes there were people who just came him and spoke to him. I wasn't allowed to speak to him unless Maya was present in the room. Often times, these people would leave in tears. Not from sorrow, not from fear, but tears that signified that something about them had changed.

The pills were numbing my emotions by the day, and I went about my tasks as if a thrall- a puppet. But the human mind can only go on in ignorance so long, and one morning after a particularly dull ritual session, I asked Maya what her religious beliefs were.

"It's not that simple." Maya said, "Religion is ancient." She smiled at me.

"I just want Jay to be okay." I said, "But I don't know what's going on anymore."

Maya laughed and kissed my forehead, ducking from the flames where the tiny, lean carcass roasted. Looking at it killed my appetite. I stuck to a loaf of bread.

"We will be fine Becky." She said, sipping from her glass of red wine. "We are making good progress."

I sat quietly for a while, staring at my bread.

"Jay told me that something happened in India..." I began to say.

"Hah!" The woman interrupted me. "Something traumatic I'm sure. The man does carry a lot of guilt about something. But don't worry, tomorrow we'll ask him about it."

Maya offered me some wine, but tonight I declined.

"You look worried." She said, those predatory eyes glaring at me. "You shouldn't. Things will get better. Trust me...I'm a friend." She repeated the same phrase I had heard many times the time I was with her.

That night I left for bed early, while I heard Maya whisper to herself as she drank alone.

I woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of bells and the smell of smoke. There was nothing.

I had dreamt. Maya lay in her bed, passed out drunk.

"Chudail..." Jay's words from that morning rang in my head. I couldn't tell if it was directed at her or both of us.

Jay was laying on the floor, his mattress taken away from him. I looked at him, still numb.

Many nights, I had considered talking to him and many nights I did refuse myself the opportunity. Tonight wasn't going to be any different.

"Becky?" Jay whispered weak.

I turned around and slowly made my way to the sleeping room. I wasn't supposed to talk to him.

Maya was dead asleep, and I considered maybe this one time I would disobey her. But then, after all this work we had done, I didn't want to ruin it.

I gave in.

By the light of a lantern, I could see Jay's bruised wrists. I felt a part of me hurt, but a part of me dulled by the numbness.

"Becky... I missed you. I want to leave. I don't feel like myself anymore."

He coughed.

"There's someone else fighting for control, and it isn't... I can't let anything happen to you. I don't know what to do and..."

I couldn't bring myself to speak, so I listened.

"Listen to me..." He began to speak, his voice hoarse.

"What happened in India?" I asked, finally.

His eyes widened in fear.

"I don't know." He said. "I... I saw a man on the dirt road when I was driving to my village. It was the middle of nowhere and he just stood there. He waved for me to stop my car and... I did."

Jay paused, hesitant. I realized that I was beginning to feel something, it was my anxiety coming back.

"It wasn't human." Jay said, fearful, " It had deep circular pits for eyes.. It asked me....if I could help carry the dead."

Fearful and confused, I stared at his expression, unable to determine what he was talking about.

"I said yes. I was so scared."

Jay looked at me, eyes too tired for tears.

"Becky...I..." Jay began to speak.

My mind began to zone out, my returning feelings beginning to overwhelm me. And while I sat there, staring at my husband in this chamber, I could only think of the same thought over and over again, against my will.

*Maya is a friend.*
