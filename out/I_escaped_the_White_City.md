I never thought that I would be writing this. 


Looking outside my window, I see people! Actual people living their lives, unafraid of the world around them!


For many years, I have known fear—or, to better put it, the feeling of immense apprehension—like the weight of an ocean upon your back. It was a vast darkness, unfathomable. Yet its focus was on me and my minuscule existence. 


I’m rambling, I know. Forgive me. I just needed that breath. One of my firsts in a free world.


My name doesn’t matter, but I was born in what is now known as the White City. Cloistered within a country your eyes have likely passed over without a second glance. It’s in every single map. In plain view for all to see. Do not be fooled. 


Do not go. 


The capital city—some call it the city of the dead. Its leaders want you to call it the White City. I am still afraid, still healing, so for now I’ll refer to it as such.


When I was a child, my country was verdant and filled with culture. The streets flowed with the artistry of my people. Life in my country was free and untroubled. For a time it remained this way, and we got too comfortable. 


We were unprepared when peace left us.


It was the middle of the day. The gentle waters from the mountains flowed past the surrounding houses. There was calming music playing on the radio in our kitchen. Birds were chirping and the city streets were busy with the gentle bustling of my people.


Then the birds stopped their song. 


I didn’t notice it at first. The radio in the kitchen was drowning out some of the ambient noise with its gentle outpouring. 


When that was silenced too, the lack of birdsong hit me. 


I walked towards the windows and stood in shock at the sight before me.


To my eyes, it seemed like all the birds in the world were taking off in fast flight. Up and out. Escaping imminent danger.


I heard my father’s voice coming from the kitchen. 


“ Odd… the radio signal is out. Must be some wind messing with their signal. Does anyone else hear that gale outside?” 


“It’s not the wind,” my mother said, coming from the laundry room and standing by me.


“It’s the birds.” 


Then the tremors began. 


They shook the entire city with such force that most of the buildings came down like broken toys. Countless years of architectural triumph were laid to waste by the thrashing of the world. 


The quakes went on and on intermittently for five hours. 


Thankfully, our home was in a sturdy stone building with no tall ones surrounding us so we were mostly unscathed, save for a few bumps and bruises. 


The tallest buildings in the city skyline all fell to earth. 


As the tremors shook us, dark clouds moved in. From them came the rains and lightning storms. A torrential downpour, like God was trying with all his or her might to drown us. Perhaps God knew. Or maybe God just wanted to see how far we’d stray to save ourselves.


The rain turned the rubble into a churning mass that swelled the streets with dead bodies and debris. The runoff turned into a brown red flow of destruction. 


The showers lasted several days without stopping. Thankfully we had a wood stove and some non-perishable foods to last us some days but, we were running low. 


My father had tried desperately to tune to any signal he could on the radio, hoping to receive instructions from our government. All he heard was dead static. Phones were down and the old television we had just showed a churning of fuzzy nothingness whenever we switched it on. 


No news. No reassurance. Just that damn static—its relentless buzzing every time we tried to reach out into the world drove us mad. Made us fearful.


Our neighbors were scared as well. People began to go out and search the rubble for lost loved ones. Everyone on the streets gathered their supplies. Days passed like this with no other form of authority or direction. People were beginning to get paranoid and irrational with each other. During these days, my parents and I rarely left our home. 


But one day, as the sun was setting, a voice sounded in the city. 


Amplified on some sort of speakers that could be heard on every street was the sound of our president’s oily intonations. 


“People of ————, witness our rebirth.” 


The thought of his voice sends a dread through my soul so deep that I have trouble breathing. 


His was the voice of our damnation. The herald of our sorrow. 


That is all I will say for now. 


I need time. 


I just wanted to tell someone that the people of my city existed. 


We suffered. 


And some lucky few… like me, survived.
