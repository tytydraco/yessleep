The light from my open blinds shot me like a bullet. I flew up and for the first time as an adult, fell out of the bed. Disoriented, I turned to where the monstrosity resided only to see the back wall of my room. I breathed a sigh of relief and lay my head against the night stand. It was that moment where the events of the prior day rang true enough to talk through with Keeley. Despite how outrageous the details were, all we had was each other. I reached back and grabbed my phone to check the time, only to see a dissapointing message from Keeley. 

'Got called into work and took an Uber. Call you when I get off.' 

Frustration erupted in my chest but I sustained myself from damn near having a panic attack. After getting dressed I bolted downstairs to find the first aid kit where I left it. To be honest, I'm skeptical if she even opened it. Even her radio sat upright, untouched. I didn't have to work until tomorrow so I spent the day at home, half-assing self made chores until the sun began to fall. Keeley worked at a call center and her hours were generally sporadic, working dusk 'till dawn. If she got called in, I knew it was gonna be a long wait. A wait I was not willing to withstand. At around 10:00 P.M., I couldn't take it anymore. 

I dialed the number for her work place and irritably talked my way through some automated A.I. bullshit to reach a representative. The only one of her bosses I've ever met was a woman named Veronica, so I jumped through some hoops until she was on the other side of the line. 

Once I knew it was her, I didn't waste a second. 

"Hello, my name is Kameron Myers. My sister, Keeley Myers, should be there and a family emergency has occurred." 

I waited a beat, expecting Keeley to be summond. 

"Oh, hey, Kameron. Keeley actually isn't scheduled for work today," said Veronica. 

I rolled my eyes at the delay. 

"Yes, I know that, she was called in. Could you please connect me with her?" 

The silence went too long for my liking. 

"Kameron...I'm her supervisor. If anyone was gonna call her in, it'd be me. I never called her." 

Anger, fear, and desperation. That's as accurate as I can be for the feelings that ran through me. I lowered my phone, ignoring the sounds of Veronica frantically asking if everything was okay. Keeley had rented out a house about ten miles east from mine and I planned on being there as soon as possible. My keys were upstairs so I sprinted up to my desk to grab them. As if on cue, my phone rang before I could head back down. Once I saw Keeley's name, I answered without thinking. 

"Hello? Keeley?" 

The line was silent for about 15 seconds. I looked at my phone screen a couple times to make sure the call was ongoing but it seemed to be holding on. Finally, I heard my sister's voice. 

"Hey, Kam." 

I could tell she had been crying and still was a bit. 

"I have alot to say, so can you listen?" 

"Why did you lie?" I immediately retorted. "You said we'd talk, and you-" 

"Shut up, Kameron," said Keeley, pushing through tears. "I said we'd talk today and we are, but it's mostly gonna be me. I need you to listen, so can you? Please?" 

I breathed for a moment, considering how to proceed. After a few seconds, I figured it best to see what she had to say. 

"Okay," I whispered. "Go on.

"Whatever we saw yesterday, the building... is it," she began. "It feeds on us by showing us what weakens us. For all we know, we could've been wandering in the woods when we saw what we saw. No halls. No office. No anything. It exists to torture beings like you and me. It exists as a... a concept, an idea. It can be anything." 

Her voice broke at the end. 

"The only reason I know as much as I do, is because of the bite on my shoulder. Its like an infection, but not in the sense we understand it as. My right arm is as good as rotted at this point. I can hardly move it. That black notebook I found when we first got there? That was the exact journal I kept after mom left. Except sick replies to everything I wrote had been edited in. Then, after you left, as I was reading, the room changed while my attention was on the book. When I looked up, I was in that white room. Only there was a mirror in front of me." 

She went silent momentarily, presumably to compose herself. 

"That was the first time I saw mom. She was wearing the same thing I was and matching every movement I did. She was my reflection. I got closer to the mirror questioning everything I was seeing and then...nothing. It looked like she moved on her own towards me, but the next thing I knew, I was waking up on the floor. That thing was in the corner of the room above you. With the torn face. I know you didn't see it then but you have seen it, right?" 

My heart beat faster. I know what I saw, but the moment I say it out loud is when I can't go back. I didn't want to admit it. 

"I...I think I saw her before I got the door open...and I had a nightmare last night. Look, Keeley, we don't know what we saw. We could've caught something in the woods or maybe we were sick? I don't know, but please, just slow down. Who told you all of this?" 

"No one, really," she replied quickly. "I just understand...ever since that bite when you picked me up. It's as if part of me was trapped there and still is. As I said before, it's an infection, but in my head too. I didn't want you to see my shoulder because the moment it happened, I knew what it wanted. It had to infect me to be able to follow me. I only saw it because it pulled part of me into its world. I didn't know if it could get to you, so I had to get away." 

"Well if what you're saying is true, how could it get to me if I wasn't bitten?" 

"We're twins, Kam," she said, choking up again. "We have special connections. Have you seen or felt anything since being away from me all day? That dream you had...how sure are you that it was even a dream at all?" 

"Keeley, that's ridiculous. I know it's..." 

I trailed off as my vision wandered over to my bed. I slowly walked over and looked at the top of the frame at the end, and two scratch marks were present where the creature had it's claws positioned. I know for a fact they weren't there before. I slowly breathed and closed my eyes tight, hoping what I was experiencing currently was a dream. Yesterday, I was looking forward to another outing with my sister. My best friend. 

Now, I'm facing this. 

"Okay...so...if it wasn't...what does that mean?" I said, lowly. 

"You didn't answer my question from before," she said. Have you seen or felt anything being alone all day? 

"Um...no...no, I don't think so." 

I heard her let out a sigh of relief. 

"Then what I thought is right. If you're not around me, it can't hurt you. So you'll be safe as long as I go." 

A feeling of dread washed over me. 

"Whoa....go? Keeley what are you talking about?" 

"It's coming," she replied. "Strange things have been happening all day. I'm not fighting it. I don't know what it wants me for, or where it's gonna take me, but you can't be around me. It's not safe. Our connection allows them to get to you. I'm calling now because it won't be much longer. Even if you leave immediately, it'd be too late." 

My keys were still laying on the desk. Making quick enough movements to be efficient, but avoiding making too much noise, I slid them in my pocket and started my way downstairs. I didn't want her to panic knowing I was coming. I thought of questions to ask to keep her talking. 

"So, of it's too late, why even call? What's the point?" 

"Three reasons, specifically," she whispered. 

I chuckled, trying unsuccessfully to keep the mood light. "You must've put quite a bit of thought into this," I replied closing the door behind me and going to open my car. 

"You could say that," she replied. Her voice was raspy from crying and all I could hear was her persistently fighting tears. What she said next stopped me in my tracks, my grip finding it's place on the driver-side handle. 

"What was it that mom said to you before she left? When you caught her about to walk out of the door that night?" 

I stood for a moment, thinking back to that night. I was eight and had just woken up to go get something to drink from the kitchen. I exited the hall and there she was, suitcase in hand standing in by the open front door. I called to her and she slowly turned to me. I was young but I knew what she was doing. I asked her where she was going and to this day, it pains me that this is the last thing I heard my mother say. I slowly opened the door as I spoke. 

"...I'm going away for just a bit. Take care of your sister for me, okay?" 

"Huh..." said, Keeley, inquisitively. "Well, you have, Kameron. But now, it's my turn to take care of you. By making sure this stays away. The first reason I called is because you're all I have left. These are my last moments and you're who I wanna hear. That's my most selfish one I guess." 

I backed out of the driveway and started on the way to Keeley's house. 

"The second reason was to let you know some of what I know so if this doesn't work, you at least have an idea of what's going on. The third...is because I need you to know I'm not crazy. I have to prove to you what's going on." 

"What do you mean?" I replied, focusing on keeping my car on the road as I approached 80 MPH. 

"I have something for you to hear. I'm gonna put you on speaker." 

Some shuffling came about as the audio changed. After a second, I heard what she was talking about. The feedback droning I heard in my dream and back at the building was coming through the phone now. When it first chirped up it almost made me swerve off of the road. The sound continued for about 10 seconds before Keeley came back on. 

"That has been ringing throughout my house all day. I heard it at your place first, but I knew it wanted me. Everytime I tried to ignore it and sleep, I'd open my eyes and that thing would be a little bit closer. Just watching me. I couldn't take it anymore. I was telling the truth when I said I took an Uber, but I just came straight here. The sound even came out of the car speakers. I kept telling myself maybe the radio was broken but then that voice came back." 

I knew what she was talking about. I could still see the face from my dream, miming out the words. 

"When I got home it was still happening. The voice speaks every now and again. Sometimes remarking how there are 'intruders on the premises'. Other times..." 

Keeley trailed off and I heard silence. 

"Footsteps," she whispered, voice shaking. "I've been sitting in my closet for a while now, too terrified to come out. I just want it to be quick, whatever happens. It's getting closer. I think she's in the hall." 

I was still about 5 minutes out. 

"Just stay quiet, Keeley. Maybe she won't find you." 

"Sometimes it isn't the voice that plays over the feedback," she said quietly, ignoring me. "It's audio from some old home videos of ours, all before mom left. That day dad filmed us playing in our new pool. Mom seemed so happy...what changed? Maybe...maybe that's where I'll go. Maybe this a chance to start over. She's outside the door, Kameron. I think I hear her singing." 

I heard her sniffle and let out a slight giggle. Her tears seemed to be of joy. I think this is when it got ahold of her, but I can't be sure. 

"She was such a beautiful singer." 

When Keeley finished her sentenced, her voice became further away as she was putting her phone down. 

"No! Keeley! KEELEY! I'M ALMOST THERE, OKAY? DO NOT OPEN THE DOOR! YOU HAVE TO FIGHT! KEELEY!" 

I could see the road to turn on to Keeley's house about a quarter mile up. The distorted feedback flooded my ear without warning and I jumped and dropped my phone. Scampering, trying to find it, the sound of a car horn forced my head up. 

I had drifted into the left lane and was flying towards a head-on collision. Frantically, I swerved back into my lane and that's the last thing I remember before losing control of the car. 

My vision was severely blurred as I came to. White walls met me and I began to panic but a hand in mine brought me down. A pair of eyes towered over me as I focused harder and could finally make out the face of a nurse. I saw her turn away and gesture to someone else but my hearing was just now becoming decipherable. Feeling I was slipping away once more, I closed my eyes as I heard my name. 

"Kameron...Kameron, are you there?" 

When I awoke again, a different nurse was in the room. I was a little closer to Earth this time around. She didn't notice me at first, her face buried in a clipboard so I attempted to raise my arm but could only muster a few fingers. Finally, I found myself and my left arm slowly lifted. This caught the her attention. 

A few hours later, I was filled in on what happened. 

After losing control, I veered off the road and crashed into a tree. Luckily, no one else was involved but me. The person I almost hit stopped immediately and rushed back to find me unconscious. They're who called the ambulance. I recieved a concussion and had broken my right leg. When I awoke the first time, it had been 16 hours since the wreck. The second, 28 hours had passed. I was perpetually monitored due to my concussion and still had to wait another week for swelling to go down and have my cast applied. When I was coherent enough, I began asking for Keeley. I knew she was my emergency contact and became confused as to why she hadn't been mentioned. The doctors refused to give me a straight answer. Eventually, the door opened and another nurse came in. Her tone was solemn. 

"Mr. Myers, there's someone here to see you. Is it okay for them to ask you some questions? It's about your sister." 

I raised up what I could manage and nodded. After a moment, a woman wearing a light khaki jacket over a black dress entered the room. She looked at me warmly and stopped at the end of the bed. Her hair was dark red and done up in a loose ponytail. 

"Hello, Kameron," she said, her smile waning into one of regret. "I'm Detective Brynn Saunders. If you're comfortable and willing, I'd like to ask you a few things about your sister, Keeley. Would that be okay?" 

"Where is she?" I replied sharply. 

Saunders looked down and then back to me. 

"An attempt to get ahold of Ms. Myers was made shortly after your arrival. She did not answer. The next morning, her boss called the police stating she hadn't shown up for her scheduled shift and was worried because you had called the prior night thinking she was there and hung up abruptly. A couple officers went to her house and she wasn't home. As of now, your sister has been missing for 30 hours." 

She paused, allowing me to take the information in. The events of the last couple nights felt unreal, but the reality was sinking in faster than I'd like it to. 

"Your car was found against a tree off the same road she lived on. I just wanna know if you spoke with her before you wrecked...okay? I want to help." 

"Do you think someone took her?" I asked, fighting the burning sensation starting in my throat. "What all did you find in her house?" 

Saunders sighed a bit and made her way to my left side of the bed. 

"Kameron, what I'm about to tell you may soun-" 

"Just tell it plain, please." I cut her off. I tried to sit up more but with my leg elevated, I couldn't move much. She moved closer and placed her hand on the panel attached to the railing increasing the incline a few inches before letting off. 

"Better?" She asked. 

"Uh...yea," I replied looking up at her. 

"The only trace of your sister was in the main closet off the living room," she continued. "There was some torn fabric in the corner, possibly from a shirt, and scratch marks along the wall. Also, her phone was laying on the ground. Currently, it is with us as evidence. 

Her eyes narrowed. 

"I'll be candid with you and confess we know you were on the phone with her when you wrecked." 

I breathed for a moment thinking of what to say. Saunders never broke eye contact, patiently awaiting my reply. 

"Yea...yea, I was," I stammered. "She...had been seeing this guy at her work. I never met him. We were close but she was uncomfortable sharing that part of her life with me. I wasn't told much about him. Last thing I found out was a couple of weeks ago she said he was becoming clingy, overly possessive so...she broke it off." 

Saunders nodded along to my made up on the spot story. 

"Like I said, I don't know his name. Maybe ask around at her work." 

The detective pursed her lips and turned briefly back to the door. I could tell she didn't quite believe me but I didn't need her to for the time being. I just wanted her out. For one second, I thought I'd get my wish as she turned and walked towards the exit of the room, only to turn her head slightly towards me in a last ditch effort to get under my skin. Her hand clenched noticeably on the doorknob before her eyes met mine once more. 

"I'm sorry about your father," she said. "Although...your file does mention a still living mother, Priscilla Myers. Could it be possible Keeley ran away to find her?" 

"Keeley wouldn't make eye contact with mom even if she was a foot in front of that bitch," I quickly retorted. "She is not family. She's poison, and I'll thank you to never bring her name up to me again." 

Saunders smirked and turned away. As she pushed through the door, I could almost see the look of distrust on her face as she spoke. 

"I'll be in touch, Kameron." 

None of that mattered to me. Now that I knew Keeley was gone, I had to find a way to get to her. A work friend brought me home after having my cast put on. After grabbing Keeley's radio and my own, I went and got a cheap replacement for my phone that was destroyed in the wreck. Once I logged all accounts in, I checked the map. We had pinned the exact spot but now only a small smudge took place of the original sighting. I didn't care. 

I was able to obtain a rental, and drove it to the same spot me and Keeley dropped off my car before bounding off to a hell we could never predict. The crutches I carried made the journey all the more painstaking, but I was determined to see what lay ahead. Drenched in sweat, I surveyed what I thought was where we had discovered the building. I hobbled to a midpoint of where we had been only to find a small area unencumbered by trees. I could barely make out something in the center. 

The pain in my leg rising, I pushed through to find something of nostalgic familiarity sitting in the grass. It was white, wooden, and the paint had chipped away as a facade to time. My reflection in the mirror it held pulled no punches. I couldn't help but smile a bit as I stared. It was a vanity set that dad had bought mom, maybe a month before she left. I remembered it because I'm the one that helped him put it together. A click came from the top most drawer as it unlocked and opened about an inch. A smirk forced its way on my face. 

"No...I'm not doing this your way," I whispered. 

Without another thought, I punched into the center of the mirror, glass shattering over the desk and the dirt. I picked up the biggest piece I could see. After placing Keeley's radio on the vanity, I sliced my right hand with the glass, allowing blood to rain over it, assuring a part of me remained. I turned back, ignoring the pain and dampness as I gripped my crutches. I reached down with my left hand and raised my own radio from my belt to my lips. 

"You know where to find me." 

I am not blind to the fact that Detective Saunders thinks I killed Keeley. I know she's gonna question locals and find out where we went. She's gonna want to follow up with me. Unfortunately, I'm gonna be elsewhere. 

Around 2am, my radio issued static that woke me up from it's place on the nightstand, the red light on top signaling a reply. Slowly, I limped my way downstairs. The source of the noise lay on my kitchen table. Keeley's radio, covered in dirt, grass and my blood sat upright calling me to it's position. Without hesitation, I sat down at the chair nearest to it and the button let off on it's own. The air around me grew cold, and then seemed flutter. 

A shift. 

To somewhere else. 

Keeley said she had called me because I was what she wanted to hear in her last moments. Well, she was all I had. So, whoever finds this, these are my final words to this world. I'm not even sure if what I'm writing will make it out. It's getting unrealistically dark in my house and there are multiple figures staring at me from the corners. Everything is vibrating. I think my cabinets are upside down. I hear muffled screaming from them. 

I don't know what is going to happen. If Keeley has been taken somewhere, I have to find her. If I die at the end of this, then that's okay too. Nothing is left for me without my sister here. There is rumbling from outside. I've tried the lights, and they do not work. I can barely see the hand in front of my face. 

There's definitely something coming for me, and I have no plan to fight it. Keeley, if I find myself alive in the next few moments, I'm gonna search for you until my mind is gone. 

For whoever is reading this, these are my final moments of this world: 

I am sitting at my kitchen table as the low hum of feedback from an intercom speaker echoes throughout my home.
