The first time I heard the hum, it was in the dead of night. Snow had blanketed the town in a heavy, sound-dampening hush, and the only noise in my house was the soft ticking of the clock on the mantle. I was drifting somewhere between sleep and wakefulness when it started. A low, mournful melody, barely audible but impossible to ignore. 

At first, I thought it was the wind howling through the eaves, but this was different. It wasn’t random. It was deliberate, rhythmic, almost... human. 

 

I sat up in bed, holding my breath, straining to listen. The hum seemed to be coming from inside the house. My heart started to race as I fumbled for the lamp on my nightstand, but as soon as the light flickered on, the sound was gone—like it had been swallowed by the darkness itself. 

I told myself it was nothing, just a trick of a half-dreaming mind, but when I went to the window, I froze. There were footprints in the snow, starting at the edge of the woods and leading straight to my house. They stopped abruptly beneath my bedroom window, as if whoever—or whatever—had been out there had been watching me. 

 

The next morning, the town was buzzing with the news: Mrs. Avery, my neighbor two doors down, was missing. Her house was locked up tight, her car untouched in the driveway. The only thing anyone noticed was an odd sound, like faint humming, drifting around her property. 

Now, I can’t stop hearing it. The hum follows me everywhere I go, growing louder and closer, as if it's waiting for me to figure out what it wants, or to take me, too. 

At first, I thought I was going mad. A sentient hum that wants to take me? It made no sense; but as the missing persons reports kept flooding the bulletin boards—I knew something had to be happening. 

\*\*\* 

On the sixteenth of August, the mayor held a press conference. I’m flipping through channels when I spot her familiar face on channel 7. I listen in. 

“Madam Watson, what's happening with all these missing people?” a reporter queries. “We want answers!” 

The mayor responds, “There is an ongoing police investigation, and we are working hard to find your loved ones and bring them home safe.” 

The camera zoomed in on the mayor’s face, her calm demeanor faltering as the crowd’s frustration erupted in a storm of shouts. “Bullshit!” someone screamed from the back, their voice cutting through the noise. “You’ve been saying that for two weeks!” 

The mayor’s expression shifts. She seems uncomfortable, like she’s holding something back. 

A flurry of shouting ensues before the station cuts to commercial. I take the remote and shuffle my thumb around until I feel the power button. I turn it off and head to bed. 

 

I lay there, silent. The moon casts a soft shadow on the backend of my room. I drift away to sleep, when suddenly—I hear it. I can’t pinpoint where it’s coming from; it’s like a surround sound speaker turned to the lowest volume. The hum is soft, yet eerie. I stand up, listening closer. I still don’t know where it’s coming from. I decided to investigate, so I equip myself with a flashlight and an old, dull kitchen knife. I hesitated at the edge of the woods, my flashlight beam barely penetrating the thick darkness ahead. Every instinct screamed at me to turn back, but the hum—the cursed hum—pulled me forward. It was as if I had no choice 

 

The footprints continued well into the woods. Animals howling and snow breaking under my boots keep my mind off the god-awful hum in the background. Continuing, I see that the footprints veer off the trail into the denser, wilder area of the forest. As I pressed deeper into the woods, I felt the hum crawling under my skin. My head throbbed, my vision swam, and for a moment, I thought I heard my name woven into the melody. The footprints—almost unnatural in size—led me to a small opening. Inside was a quaint cabin, but it felt wrong. It looked ancient, yet new at the same time. The wood was plentiful with cracks, yet the hinges were freshly oiled. The door was slightly ajar, as though it was inviting me in. Stepping in the clearing, the hum was deafening. It smothered my mind in darkness. I raised my flashlight and stepped forward, the crunching snow becoming a haven from the hum. Then—I saw it—movement inside. I stood there a moment. “Should I have gone back?” I whisper to no one. I was in too deep now. I enter the cabin, the floorboards a symphony under my weight. I clear the cabin, but no one is inside. Looking deeper, I see musical instruments: a piano, its keys yellowed with age, an old 6-string with one string snapped, and a gramophone; gleaming flawlessly despite the state of the cabin. On the platter lay an aged record, its label faded. I extend my hand—now trembling—to pick it up, but the hum grows. It’s no longer an organized melody, it's a scream. It's a fighter jet taking flight in my mind. I stumble back, my hands grasping my head in pain. Something moved in the shadows, a flicker just beyond the reach of my flashlight. 

“No,” I muttered, my voice shaking. I turned and bolted, nearly tripping over the doorway in my haste. 

The hum receded as I ran, fading to a faint, almost soothing drone that nestled in the back of my mind. 

When I finally stumbled into my bed hours later, the hum was still there, dormant but present, its rhythm a sinister lullaby. Sleep came, but peace did not. 

\*\*\* 

I stood in line at the mayor’s office, humming softly under my breath without realizing it. The realization jolted me, and I clamped my mouth shut. 

When my turn came, the secretary gestured for me to enter. Inside, Mayor Watson sat behind a massive oak desk, her expression unreadable. 

“What can I do for you?” she asked, her tone clipped. 

I dove straight in. “I need answers about the disappearances. The hum—what is it? I know you’re hiding something.” 

Her gaze sharpened, but she didn’t react immediately. “That’s a dangerous assumption,” she said, leaning forward. “And one I suggest you keep to yourself.” 

“I hear it,” I said, my voice shaking. “The hum. Everyone who’s heard it is gone. What’s happening to me?” 

Her face tightened, and for a moment, she seemed to weigh her words carefully. Finally, she sighed. 

“My great-grandfather created it,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “A song. He wanted it to be perfect, but... it became something else. It feeds on curiosity, draws people in. It always leads to the same place.” 

“The cabin,” I said, the word falling from my lips like a stone. 

Her expression darkened. “No one who goes there comes back. And every time... it gets stronger.” 

I shuddered, the hum growing louder in my mind, as if reacting to her words. She stood abruptly, her gaze hard. 

“You shouldn’t have come here,” she said, her voice final. “Leave, before it’s too late.” 

 As I walk to the exit, the hum grows louder in my head, reverberating off my skull. I exit, trying to ignore the intensity. 

It continues back home. My body began to move on its own. I tried to fight it. My mind screamed for control, but my body no longer obeyed. Each step toward the cabin felt like sinking deeper into quicksand—inescapable, suffocating. The hum swelled, a living thing coiling tighter around my thoughts. 

When I reached the clearing, the cabin stood waiting, its crooked frame illuminated by the pale moonlight. My vision blurred, the edges of reality folding in on themselves. I could feel it—the hum wasn’t just sound anymore. It was inside me, rewriting me. 

The door creaked open as if it had been expecting me. The gramophone gleamed in the center of the room, its brass horn catching the faint light. My hand reached for the record, trembling but purposeful, as though it no longer belonged to me. 

When the needle touched the vinyl, the hum erupted into a symphony—haunting, beautiful, and devastating all at once. It was everything: joy, despair, love, and terror, woven into a melody that consumed me. My body sagged, and for a moment, I felt weightless, as if I were dissolving into the music itself. 

I wasn’t alone. Shadows emerged from the walls, faint outlines of those who had come before me. Their eyes glowed faintly, their mouths moving in unison to the hum. I tried to scream, but no sound came. 

They weren’t trapped. They were the hum. 

My vision faded, but I could still hear the song, now clearer than ever. It whispered promises, beckoning others. It wasn’t just music—it was a message, a signal. And I was its newest voice. 

The next morning, the hum began again, faint but insistent, drifting over the town. Another would hear it soon. Another would follow. 

And I would be waiting.
