The first time I heard the hum, it was in the dead of night. Snow had blanketed the town in a heavy, sound-dampening hush, and the only noise in my house was the soft ticking of the clock on the mantle. I was drifting somewhere between sleep and wakefulness when it started—a low, mournful melody, barely audible but impossible to ignore. 

At first, I thought it was the wind howling through the eaves, but this was different. It wasn’t random. It was deliberate, rhythmic, almost... human. 

I sat up in bed, holding my breath, straining to listen. The hum seemed to be coming from inside the house. My heart raced as I fumbled for the lamp on my nightstand, but as soon as the light flickered on, the sound was gone—swallowed by the darkness itself. 

I told myself it was nothing, just a trick of a half-dreaming mind. But when I went to the window, I froze. There were footprints in the snow, starting at the edge of the woods and leading straight to my house. They stopped abruptly beneath my bedroom window, as if whoever—or whatever—had been out there had been watching me and then vanished into the woods. 

The next morning, the town buzzed with news: Mrs. Avery, my neighbor two doors down, was missing. Her house was locked up tight, her car untouched in the driveway. The only clue anyone noticed was an odd sound—like faint humming—drifting around her property. 

Now, I can’t stop hearing it. The hum follows me everywhere I go, growing louder and closer, as if it's waiting for me to figure out what it wants—or to take me, too. 

At first, I thought I was going mad. A sentient hum that wants to take me? It made no sense. But as the missing persons reports flooded the bulletin boards, I knew something had to be happening. 

\*\*\* 

On the sixteenth of August, the mayor held a press conference. I was flipping through channels when I spotted her familiar face on Channel 7. I leaned closer, listening. 

“Madam Watson, what is happening with all these missing people?” a reporter demanded. “We want answers!” 

The mayor responded, “There is an ongoing police investigation, and we are working hard to find your loved ones and bring them home safe.” 

The camera zoomed in on the mayor’s face. Her calm demeanor faltered as the crowd’s frustration erupted in a storm of shouts. 

“Bullshit!” someone screamed from the back, their voice cutting through the noise. “You’ve been saying that for two weeks!” 

The mayor’s expression shifted. She looked uncomfortable, as though she were holding something back. 

The station cut to a commercial. Frustrated, I turned off the TV and went to bed. 

\*\*\* 

I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. The moon cast a soft shadow across my room. Just as sleep began to claim me, I heard it again. The hum. Soft yet insistent, it seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. 

I stood, grabbed a flashlight, and, on impulse, a dull kitchen knife. My hands trembled as I stepped into the snow. The footprints from the previous night were still there, leading into the woods. 

The footprints continued well into the forest. The sounds of animals howling and the crunch of snow beneath my boots kept my mind off the god-awful hum in the background. The trail veered off into the denser, wilder part of the woods. As I pressed deeper, the hum crawled under my skin. My head throbbed, my vision swam, and for a moment, I thought I heard my name woven into the melody. 

The footprints—almost unnatural in size—led me to a small clearing. At its center stood a cabin, quaint but wrong. It looked ancient, yet new at the same time. The wood was riddled with cracks, but the hinges gleamed like they had been freshly oiled. The door was slightly ajar, as though inviting me in. Stepping into the clearing, the hum became deafening, smothering my mind in darkness. I raised my flashlight and stepped forward, the crunching snow beneath my boots the only sound I could cling to. 

Then I saw it—movement inside. I froze. “Should I have turned back?” I whispered to no one. But I was in too deep. I entered the cabin, the floorboards groaning under my weight. 

Inside, the air was heavy, oppressive. I cleared the cabin but found no one. My flashlight revealed musical instruments scattered about: a piano with yellowed keys, an old six-string guitar with one snapped string, and a gramophone—gleaming flawlessly despite the cabin’s decrepit state. On its platter lay an aged record, its label faded. 

My hand trembled as I reached for it. The hum grew louder, no longer a melody but a scream, a fighter jet taking flight in my mind. I stumbled back, clutching my head. Something moved in the shadows, a flicker just beyond the beam of my flashlight. 

“No,” I muttered, my voice shaking. I turned and bolted, nearly tripping over the doorway in my haste. 

The hum receded as I ran, fading to a faint, almost soothing drone that nestled in the back of my mind. 

When I finally stumbled into bed hours later, the hum was still there, dormant but present, its rhythm a sinister lullaby. Sleep came, but peace did not. 

\*\*\* 

I stood in line at the mayor’s office, humming softly under my breath without realizing it. The realization jolted me, and I clamped my mouth shut. 

When my turn came, the secretary gestured for me to enter. Inside, Mayor Watson sat behind a massive oak desk, her expression unreadable. 

“What can I do for you?” she asked, her tone clipped. 

I dove straight in. “I need answers about the disappearances. The hum—what is it? I know you’re hiding something.” 

Her gaze sharpened, but she didn’t react immediately. “That’s a dangerous assumption,” she said, leaning forward. “And one I suggest you keep to yourself.” 

“I hear it,” I said, my voice shaking. “The hum. Everyone who’s heard it is gone. What’s happening to me?” 

Her face tightened, and for a moment, she seemed to weigh her words carefully. Finally, she sighed. 

“My great-grandfather created it,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “A song. He wanted it to be perfect, but... it became something else. It feeds on curiosity, draws people in. It always leads to the same place.” 

“The cabin,” I said, the word falling from my lips like a stone. 

Her expression darkened. “No one who goes there comes back. And every time... it gets stronger.” 

I shuddered, the hum growing louder in my mind, as if reacting to her words. She stood abruptly, her gaze hard. 

“You shouldn’t have come here,” she said, her voice final. “Leave, before it’s too late.” 

As I walked to the exit, the hum grew louder in my head, reverberating off my skull. I tried to ignore its intensity, but it followed me home. 

By the time I reached my front door, my body moved on its own. My mind screamed for control, but my body no longer obeyed. Each step toward the cabin felt like sinking deeper into quicksand—inescapable, suffocating. The hum swelled, a living thing coiling tighter around my thoughts. 

When I reached the clearing, the cabin stood waiting, its crooked frame illuminated by pale moonlight. My vision blurred, the edges of reality folding in on themselves. I could feel it—the hum wasn’t just sound anymore. It was inside me, rewriting me. 

The door creaked open as if it had been expecting me. 

The gramophone gleamed in the center of the room, its brass horn catching the faint light. My hand reached for the record, trembling but purposeful, as though it no longer belonged to me. 

When the needle touched the vinyl, the hum erupted into a symphony—haunting, beautiful, and devastating all at once. It was everything: joy, despair, love, and terror, woven into a melody that consumed me. 

My body sagged, and for a moment, I felt weightless, as if I were dissolving into the music itself. 

I wasn’t alone. Shadows emerged from the walls, faint outlines of those who had come before me. Their eyes glowed faintly, their mouths moving in unison to the hum. I tried to scream, but no sound came. 

They weren’t trapped. They were the hum. 

My vision faded, but I could still hear the song, now clearer than ever. It whispered promises, beckoning others. It wasn’t just music—it was a message, a signal. And I was its newest voice. 

The next morning, the hum began again, faint but insistent, drifting over the town. Another would hear it soon. Another would follow. 

And I would be waiting.
