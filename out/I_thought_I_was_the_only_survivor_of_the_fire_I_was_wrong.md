The cheerful hum of conversation echoed through the corridors, accompanied by the occasional clink of wine glasses. 

The sitting room was adorned with flowers and delicate decorations, brilliant silver tinsel wrapped around the handsome tree. 

The dazzling gold star stood proudly at the very top, gazing down upon the sequined fur coats and smart tuxedos. 

Mother stood at the summit of the elaborate marble steps, Lily by her side, radiant smiles lighting their faces. For once, my younger sister looked genuinely happy. 

Her pale, sickly features shone with newfound hope, a sudden ray sunlight illuminating a world usually shrouded in shadows. 

 A loud peal of laughter rand out as Father scooped her up and swung her around gently. 

Such a pure melody, Lily's laughter. 

If only I had been fortunate enough to hear it more... 

Just once more... 



"The house looks very different now."

I gasped, the sudden whisper pulling me back to the cold, gloomy present. 

I peered around the large garden we were standing in. The overgrown weeds and the monotonous patterns the frost had created on the cracked paving stones brought a sense of isolation. 

A place that was left behind as the world kept moving forward. 

My aunt, who the voice belonged to, was staring at the ancient, but magnificent building in front of us, my cousin behind her. 

Her words kept echoing in my ears. It was true. 

The ramshackle maze of walls before me was not the home I walked my first steps in. 

It couldn't be. 

But it was. 

And it terrified me. 

"Hazel." I heard my aunt call my cousin. 

"Let's go inside, it's cold out here." 



The inside of the house only proved to be much colder, the musty scent of mud and cheap air freshener meeting my nose. 

I found myself holding my breath, my wary mind taking control. 

Shadows of the lavish, but tragic past hung about every hallway, hiding behind every stone pillar. 

A large, gold-framed portrait hung above the dusty, cold fireplace. 

My mother's face smiled at me, my father wearing his usual tight-lipped grimace, but his eyes betrayed his joy. 

Sitting on his knee, in a crisp white pinafore, was my sister, Lily. 

With her blonde locks in braids and her wide grin, she was a miniature version of the older girl next to her. 

Eleanor Hilton. Me. 

I sighed, gazing at myself. I looked so happy, so free, so ignorant of the tragedy waiting to happen. 

Why did everything have to change? 

Why did our picture-perfect world have to fall apart that night? 

That tragic night... 



"Eleanor!" My father's voice was filled with panic and fear. 

Smoke. Smoke everywhere. 

My mother cradling Lily as I tried to make my way across the room, stumbling over several pieces of upturned furniture. 

The curtains were blazing, shining a bright orange, along with the sheets, the carpets... 

All I could see were flames. 

Suddenly, my father's arms were around me and we were running. 

I heard strangled screams and realized with a start that they were mine. 

Running to the door, we thought we could make it. 

We could make it. We would make it.

We *had to* make it...

The last thing I remembered was seeing a flaming pillar a few inches above us. 

My father's wail. That was the first time I saw him cry. 

And the last. 



A sob startled me back to reality, and with a shock I realized that yet again, they were mine. 

I reached out to the portrait, desperate to touch the faces of my family, needing to feel their skin on my finger tips. 

Just once more... 



The doorbell rang out, and I withdrew my arm. 

I found my self wondering how the doorbell still worked after all these years, as I heard voices in the corridor. 

A man and woman, both quite distinguished, carrying an air of wealth about them. Aristocrats. 

"The house is lovely, Mrs. Brookes." The woman had a sophisticated drawl in her voice. 

"Yes indeed, with a few renovations, it would be a glamorous holiday home for us." The man, who I assumed to be her husband, placed his hand on her shoulder, a smile on his youthful face. 

My aunt shook the gentleman's hand. 

"I'm glad you like it, sir. Would you like to see the grounds?" 

As they all walked outside, I followed after them, trying to decide what to say. 

For some reason, neither my aunt nor the couple spared me a glance, not even bothering to be introduced to me. I sighed. I had lost the bright spark in my eyes, since that night.  
My hair let loose to grow at its own will, the golden colour having somehow become a platinum blonde. I didn't know that was possible, but I couldn't bring myself to care anymore.

I didn't look important, so I didn't blame them for skipping me over. 

I watched Hazel as she hurried after them.

I paled in comparison to her, with her lovely skin and brown hair,  
Which was sad in its own way, for when she was younger, she used to hope to look like me.

Swallowing the lump in my throat, I thought about how I was the rightful owner of the house, now that my family was... no more. My mind repeated the times where I'd heard my aunt arguing with my father about how she deserved at least half of the property.   
He never gave in.

Stopping my spiraling thoughts, I called out to my aunt, but she was too far away to hear. 



They approached the family graveyard, where the remains of the Hiltons were buried. 

Once considered the wealthiest, luckiest family in this part of the country, and now only charred  bodies remained. 

Left behind, along with the rest of the luxuries and wealth. 

My aunt stopped at the graves. My mother's, father's... Lily's... 

"It was truly a tragedy. The fire." She murmured solemnly. "It's been years now."

"No one survived?" The gentleman's quiet tone. 

My aunt took a deep breath, and I sighed, waiting to be acknowledged as the sole, unfortunate survivor. 



"No."  


My heart stopped. 

"W-What do you mean? Aunt Petunia, I did!" My shrill shriek rang out.   


The gentleman and lady sighed as they walked off with my aunt, leaving me behind. 

Why didn't she answer my question? 

Now as I thought back, I realized she didn't utter a word to me the whole trip.   
I knew she despised the fact that my father didn't sign anything for her in his will, but I never thought she'd take it out against me.

I ran towards her, yelling her name. 

She didn't even turn back. No one did. 



I gasped, tripping over a grave as I tried to run. 

Gazing down at the cracked old gravestone, I noticed that there were four. 

I counted my mother's, father's, Lily's... Why were there four? 

Did someone else die? 

No, no one else did. There was no one but them in the house that night. 

I peered down at the grave beneath my feet, my breath fogging the cold air as I wiped frost from the stone.

The lettering was old. Cracked. Almost mercifully faded.

Almost.

**Eleanor Hilton.**

The world tilted.

No.

That wasn’t possible. I remembered the heat, the smoke, my father’s arms around me as we ran. I remembered *living*.

I opened my mouth to scream, to tell them they were wrong—to tell them I was right here—

But no sound came.

My aunt stood by the other graves, her voice distant and calm.

“No one survived,” she said again.  


And this time, I understood.

The fire didn’t spare me.  


It only let me linger.
