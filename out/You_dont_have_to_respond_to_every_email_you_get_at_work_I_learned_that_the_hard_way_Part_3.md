Part 2 \^  
  
We took a few moments to regain our composure then we slowly continued our way to the campsite, careful of the noise each step would make as we pushed through to our destination.  
  
We knew we were getting close when we encountered a smell. Not the heavy, rotten musk of the sasquatch, but the charred and sickly smell of Boyd’s burned remains.  
  
Eli, the oldest of us, requested a break before we entered our old campsite. I don’t think it was to catch his breath, as much as it was the fact that he had lost 2 acquaintances and a family member over the course of 10 hours. Going back to the site where the charred remains of Boyd lay was just too much for him in this moment. Especially since we both knew the forest animals and insects would have started to strip Boyd of his flesh by now.  
  
I sat on the ground next to Eli and rested my hand on his shoulder. We didn’t need to speak. I’ve lost friends and family before, granted not in ways as sudden and incredibly stupid as offering a sasquatch a cigarette, but I understood nonetheless.  
  
Kenny on the other hand pressed on. The shame of his exposed secret lay heavy on him, as it should, and he wanted to be alone, away from the judgement of others.  
  
After a few minutes of reflection Eli and I stood up and dusted ourselves off, ready to continue our journey ahead when he heard Kenny scream.  
  
“HELP!”, he shouted, “Fucking Bear trap got me!”  
  
Eli and I both shared a look of regret. With everything we had gone through since waking up, we had forgotten completely about the bear traps. In fairness, it had been a hell of a day.  
  
We sprinted to the campsite and found Kenny sitting on his ass, his leg caught in the iron grip of the trap. The serrated edges of the trap sinking deeper with each of his movements. Blood trickled from the wounded leg in steady streams staining the ground under him crimson. It was clear his leg was broken in at least one place. Kenny wasn’t going to be walking out of this forest.  
  
Eli and I worked to pry the trap open, but each time we pulled the jaws a centimeter Kenny would scream and beg us to stop. After two attempts the heavy musk of the sasquatch returned. Kenny’s eyes grew wide and he begged us not to leave him. He reached for us as we stood up and backed away. Tears ran down his cheeks.  
  
Eli and I again rubbed dirt and pine needles on us and jumped into a nearby bush and waited. It wasn’t long before the sasquatch showed up. Kenny went silent and stared at the hulking brute as it approached him. The giant reached out one massive hand and picked Kenny up by the torso, pinning his arms at his sides. His legs dangled out from under the grip of the massive hand, one of the legs bent at an awful angle where the bear trap, still attached to the leg, had bitten him.  
  
Eli and I watched this from the nearby bush, when we realized we had made a terrible mistake. We were laying on top of a fire ant colony. Searing pain shot up our legs as the army of ants crawled out from their hive and worked their way from our feet up towards our torsos. The pain was immense. It took all the willpower in the world not to scream and brush them off of me. They slowly worked their way up my legs onto the trunk of my body, then my back, then my neck, soon they were crawling deep into my ears and nose. My brain was screaming to get them off of me, to run and scream and blow my nose and strip off naked, but still Eli and I remained motionless, remained silent and let the swarm of insects wash over us. The only other choice was death.  
  
The Sasquatch, still holding Kenny aloft in one hand, took his free and placed it over Kenny’s head. It closed its fingers around Kenny’s head and ripped upward as if it was uncorking a wine bottle. Kenny’s head was pulled off effortlessly and brought a small section of spine along with it. Kenny never made a noise.  
  
The monster dropped both pieces of what was Kenny and started sniffing the air. Searching.  
  
At this point he fire ants had nearly completely covered Eli and I, I could feel my skin starting to stretch in my legs and arms as I swelled up. I took a sideways glance at Eli and his face was so swollen I could barely recognize him, but we remained resolute in our silence.  
  
The beast milled around the campsite, playing with its fresh kill and taking a few generous bites out of the man it had killed the day before. It looked as if it had given up searching the area and was about to leave when –  
  
SNAP  
  
The beast had stepped into another one of the dormant bear traps. The animal howled in a combination of pain and untethered primal rage. The trap didn’t slow him (Her?) down at all. The beast pried the trap off of its foot easily and then snapped it in two. It then, in an awesome show of pure strength uprooted a nearby small tree and broke that in half as well.  
  
The animal then began to walk in a small circle around the campsite testing its injured foot, huffing and puffing in a blinding rage periodically beating its chest.  
  
After what felt like an eternity, we lost sight of the beast and eventually the accompanying smell dissipated. At that point we felt secure enough to leave the bush. We scrambled out like mad men, jumping around, stripping our clothes and slapping off the insects as quickly and quietly as we could. Still neither of us, dared to utter a sound.  
  
We looked like hell. Covered from head to toe in dirt, scrapes, bruises, slick with sweat and swollen beyond all recognition. Each step we took was agony, but the worst part was the itching. Our entire bodies itched incessantly. We scratched our arms, legs and bellies so hard they began to bleed which just attracted more mosquitos and gnats.  
  
I won’t lie to you, there were a few times when I contemplated screaming out and letting the beast of the forest take me, but I quickly brushed those thoughts aside. One other thing that really sucked, at this point I had begun to figure that I probably wasn’t going to get paid for any of this shit. What a kick in the nuts that was.  
  
We moved slowly and steadily through the woods leaving behind the campsite that had become the final resting place for two of our party members.  
  
We didn’t talk and took short rests often, both to regain our energy and to listen to the woods around us for any sign of the ‘Squatch.  
  
We slept that night in a thick bush, taking turns sleeping so we could wake the other person in case of danger or if they started snoring.  
  
We continued on in the morning, dropping unnecessary items from our packs as we travelled. Eli dropped the tent, sleeping bags and most of the food which we opened before discarding in the hopes it would draw the creature away from us. I dropped nearly all of my equipment with the exception of bear mace as a last line of defense and the food and water I would need to stay alive.  
  
We moved more quickly than we did the day before riding high on adrenaline and the hopes that we could soon put all of this behind us and because of that we made great time. We were almost back to Eli’s cabin by midday.  
  
We were within 200 yards of the cabin when the smell returned. We gathered what little energy we had left and sprinted towards the cabin.  
  
I could hear the pounding of the heavy footfalls in behind me. The ‘Squatch was gaining ground fast. Pure adrenaline pumped in my veins. All I could focus on was the small wooden shack in the distance, getting closer with every step. I wanted to turn around and look, to see how close my killer had gotten, but I didn’t. I couldn’t afford any wasted movement or energy. I just had to focus on the cabin in the distance.  
  
Thud  
  
Thud  
  
Thud  
  
Silence.  
  
All I could hear was the footfalls of two men running through the forest and our own heavy breathing.  
  
I immediately knew what had happened. It had taken to the trees. I couldn’t resist any longer. I had to look. The terror of anticipating certain death was too much to take. I slowed my pace slightly and glanced behind me – nothing. I looked to the left and right – nothing on either side. I tried looking up in the treetops but the canopy was too thick to allow to see more than a few meters high.  
  
Eli had pulled ahead of me and I focused on his backpack, that was my new target. Catch up to the man in front of me. Don’t be the guy at the end of the line that get picked off first.  
  
I was laser focused on that backpack. My vision narrowed, everything else in the forest didn’t matter. All that mattered to me was following that ratty JanSport bag to safety. My breathing steadied. The pain in my legs seemed to numb. Everything seemed to move in slow motion. Insanely, I thought, “Wow so this is what a runner’s high is? I guess they aren’t full of shit”  
  
Then my field of view was blocked by a giant hairy arm that swooped down in front of me and grabbed Eli’s backpack and thrust him up into the air. Eli squealed like a pig as he was pulled into the air, legs kicking. Luckily, he was a quick thinker and immediately slipped out of the backpack. He fell about 8 feet back down and crashed into the forest floor.  
  
I stopped to help him up and we carried on. The cabin was now about 100 yards from us.  
  
80  
  
60  
  
40  
  
I felt myself being lifted off the ground and immediately tried to slip out of my backpack but the straps were too tight. I was lifted higher and higher into the trees until I came face to face with what had been hunting us for 3 days straight. Its yellow eyes bore into me from under its protruding and hairy brow. It opened its mouth revealing rows of large, flat teeth designed for pulverizing bone. Its noxious breath stung my eyes and made them water.  
  
The beast took a sharp inhale then screamed in my face, I would describe it to you, but I’ll just say it blew out both of my eardrums which instantly made me dizzy and made my ears leak a clear fluid.  
  
In a dizzy haze I pulled out my last line of defense, the bear mace, and unleashed it on my attacker’s face. Instantly the monster dropped me, sending me 30 feet to the forest floor which pretty much destroyed my left ankle. I remember Eli helping me up and us running the last 40 yards to the cabin. I remember hearing the monster’s pained howls and hearing it retch and gasp for breath, but mostly I remember the pain.  
  
When we reached the cabin Eli laid me down on the couch and handed me his shotgun. He meanwhile walked over to the fireplace and pulled down an assault rifle he had mounted above it as if it was a Christmas wreath.  
  
“You know how to use it?” he asked me, pointing to the shotgun in my hands.  
  
I nodded.  
  
Eli, took cover behind the wall next to the main window peaked out, “I think we’ll be alright in here,” he said, probably more to bolster his own confidence than mine, “I’ve got enough guns and ammo in here to invade Iraq”  
  
I looked around the cabin. He really did. The cabin was decorated in a style I would call “Prepper Chic” there were ammo cannisters stacked in one corner. Bottles of water in another corner. There were enough canned goods and peanut butter to last a decade and enough moonshine to get an entire army drunk. If you were ever to have a last stand against a crazed Sasquatch, you could do much worse than Eli’s shack.  
  
I rolled off the couch and crawled my way over to the kitchen where the moonshine was stockpiled. I took a bottle, uncorked it and took a couple swigs. Wasn’t good as morphine would have been, but I needed something for the pain.  
  
Eli looked over at me and smiled, “Pretty good, huh? Make it myself. Just don’t light up a cigarette now or it’ll have you burping flames,” he again peeked out the window, “HEY! Get away from my truck!” He opened fire through the window screaming like someone who has watched too many war movies, but has never been to war.  
  
Next, I heard the sound of wrenching metal, no doubt the sasquatch doing something terrible to Eli’s truck. Eli confirmed this a moment later, shouting, “Oh! OH! What are you doing to my truck!”  
  
Eli reloaded and kept firing at the beast. If he had half decent aim, the animal should have nearly 30 rounds in it my now, but it didn’t seem to be slowing down in the slightest.  
  
Then there was a crashing sound and broken glass exploded into the cabin. I looked up at Eli and he was no longer there. I followed the trail of broken glass and found him dead on the other side of the cabin. The Sasquatch had ripped the tire off of his truck and thrown it at him, caving in his chest.  
  
Now it was just me and the sasquatch. Mono y mono. I went over my options.  
  
Try to shoot it like Eli, then die.  
  
Try to fight it one-on-one like Kenny and Milton, then die.  
  
Try to offer it a cigarette like Ross, then die.  
  
Hell, Boyd didn’t even get to lay eyes on it and he died! I thought back to that night. Hiding in the tent listening to the whoops and hollers of the beast as it ran circles around our camp. I thought of Boyd’s body twitching as it lay in the dirt before catching fire.  
  
The fire!  
  
As the fire grew that night the monster receded deeper and deeper into the woods. I had my answer.  
  
I took several bottles of the moonshine and started making Molotov cocktails, sipping as I worked. The entire time I could hear the monster walking circles around the house. Grunting, sniffing the air.  
  
When I was happy with the firebombs I had, I light a rag on fire with the gas stove, then crawled over to the busted window and started lobbing them out into the surrounding forest. Then I crawled back over to the kitchen to make more and repeat the process.  
  
There isn’t a Hollywood ending to this story. I didn’t take down the Sasquatch avenging my fallen comrades. There was no love story. I just did millions of dollars of environmental and property damage, then when it became nearly too smokey in the cabin for me to breath, I army crawled out of the cabin. Got into my truck that was still parked there and drove away, blindingly drunk.  
  
Hell, I couldn’t even get anyone to believe me. When I drove myself to the nearest hospital, they had me arrested for driving there drunk. It was the perfect cherry on top of a shitty weekend.  
  
I wish I could say I learned something, that there was some greater message to this story, but I don’t think there is. Unless the message is: You don’t have to answer every email you get at work.
