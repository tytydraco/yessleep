I’m not sure how to start this so I’ll just start with some backstory. My name is James, I have a fairly decent relationship with everyone in my family, except for my uncle. My uncle pretty much hated me from birth. My mom told me that on my first birthday he apparently joked about getting bored of me and to get rid of me as a one year celebration. As a kid I tried to always get on his good side but as I got older I just gave up and decided it was better off to accept that he’s naturally an asshole.

Anyway, about a week ago my uncle has passed away due to suicide, it’s also worth mentioning that for close to a year before this event, he had pretty much cut contact with everyone he knew. Nobody knew if he was struggling with his mental health so it came as a shock to everyone, except me, I didn’t really care. Fast forward a few days later, My uncles lawyer comes to the house and in short basically tells me my uncle left me his house for inheritance. I was surprised when his lawyer told me this, to the point where I actually asked if he had the right person. My uncle didn’t leave a single person anything, not family, friends or anyone at all, but of all people he gave ME his house? I was still living with my mom at the time since I had just come out of a college dorm and was looking for a place so I wasn’t gonna complain about free housing. My uncles house is actually a good house so even more reason to accept.

So after I had been living in the house for 3 days i started to settle in fully. But yesterday I had woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of a light knocking sound from my bedroom floor. Below my room is a basement so obviously my first thought was to check there. I go to the basement, nothing wrong, I go back to the bedroom and the tapping has stopped. I was tired so I shrugged it off and went back to sleep. In the morning, I walked out of my room and was going to make myself a coffee, like I usually would most mornings. To get to my kitchen I have to walk past the basement door, so that’s what I did. But as I’m walking past, I notice the door is fully open, like handle against the wall kind of open. I swear I had closed it, granted I was half asleep but there was no way in hell I’d leave a door leading to a creepy basement wide open. I closed the door and went to make my coffee. 

It’s been a few hours since then and I had just got home from getting some groceries. First thing I notice when walking through the front door is the sound of a metal clanking sound…guess where it’s coming from. The fucking basement. I place the bag of groceries on the kitchen counter and walk to the basement, door is open, I walk down and follow the sound. I end up turning a corner that leads to some pipes and a dead end but as soon as I turned the corner, the sound had stopped. But I noticed something else. There was red writing on the wall that said “help us”. I had never noticed this writing before since I hadn’t lived here long enough to see the whole basement, only reason I’ve had to go down there is just to check out the knocking sound and this metal clinking sound. After that I just had a weird feeling, like I was being stalked kind of feeling, so I just wanted to get out of the basement. As I was walking to the door of the basement, the door just slammed shut, like full on slammed right in front of me. I didn’t know what to do, I just stood there for a moment, frozen in place. Eventually I got over the shock and just quickly made my way out of the basement.

Back to present time of writing this. I have just been watching a video on YouTube, one of those scary ones, this one in particular was talking about cults and demonic stuff. Eventually in the video my town was mentioned and apparently there’s some kind of urban legend of a group of people who supposedly participated in demonic rituals and some really weird/creepy shit, and then out of nowhere would either disappear or commit suicide. It’s currently 2:43 am as I’m writing this so I’ve had a full day going on before writing this, and all day I’ve noticed sounds, objects being misplaced and doors opening or closing. I’m not saying my uncle was involved in some shady shit but I’m also not putting it past the guy. My theory is the old bastard had cursed this home maybe? I really don’t know what to do, I don’t know much about this stuff so anyone who could either give advice or help me understand it would really help, I’ll keep updates on anything that happens.
