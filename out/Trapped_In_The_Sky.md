I used to love climbing onto the roof. It was a small flat one, part of an old storage shed behind my house. Nothing fancy. But from up there, I could see the whole neighborhood—the trees swaying, the rooftops stretching out, the sunset casting everything in gold. It was my escape.

I’d bring my phone, take pictures, record videos. Sometimes I’d just talk—about school, my family, my thoughts. Stuff I wouldn’t say out loud otherwise. The roof was my quiet place. Until it wasn’t.

One day, I climbed up like always, snapped a picture of the view, and turned to climb down. But the ladder was gone.

I blinked. No. Not gone. It was there. But when I reached for it, my hand passed right through. Like it was a mirage.

I looked around, confused. The backyard was below me, my house right there. Everything looked normal. So I tried again—reaching, stepping forward—only to find myself back on the roof.

It didn’t matter what I did. Jump? Landed back on the roof. Climb? The ladder just looped me back up. Yell for help? My voice didn’t even carry. I was stuck.

The sun crept lower, the sky darkening. My phone had no signal. No messages went through. The battery percentage refused to drop. Time felt…wrong.

Then, at exactly 7:00 PM, I heard it.

Footsteps.

They circled the house below—slow, deliberate. Something was down there. I peered over the edge. Nothing. But the sound kept moving.

And then—scraping. Claws? Nails? I don’t know. I backed up as the noise shifted. It was climbing.

I barely had time to hide behind the old vent before it reached the roof.

It wasn’t human.

A tall, faceless shape, smooth like glass but shifting, writhing, like its skin wasn’t solid. But the mouth—that was the worst part. A sphere for a head, ringed with jagged, moving teeth. Saw-like. Grinding.

It sniffed the air. Listened. Then it started searching.

I held my breath. It knew I was here. But somehow, it didn’t find me. Not that night.

The next night, it came back.

Every night, 7:00 PM. Each time, it got smarter. Moving faster. Learning. Climbing quicker. I barely survived.

I lost track of time. Days? Weeks? I didn’t age. I didn’t starve. I didn’t sleep. Just an endless loop of day and night, of hiding, of running. I almost thought I’d beaten it.

Then I woke up somewhere else.

A white room. Fluorescent lights. My body felt wrong. Heavy. My hands—wrinkled. My reflection—unrecognizable.

They told me I’d been trapped for 13 quintillion years.

A temporal glitch. A recursive pocket of warped reality. A phenomenon so rare it only had a name because it had happened twice before—in the 1700s.

Recursive Chrono-Liminal Apex Entrapment Disorder.

Or R.C.L.A.E.D for short.

They showed me the files.

Elias Whitmore. 1698-1711. A boy who loved climbing trees and rooftops. Told his sister he felt “trapped in the sky” before vanishing. Villagers heard footsteps on the rooftops for years.

Marguerite Delaunay. 1702-1715. A girl who sketched landscapes from her attic. One night, she screamed from above—but when her family looked, she was gone. Her last drawing showed a faceless figure with jagged teeth circling her house.

No bodies. No traces. No one in their villages even remembered them after they disappeared.

Something—that thing—erased them. Like they never existed.

And now?

The organization that found me—the K.A.P.D.—is trying to bury the case. They won’t let me talk. My family doesn’t remember I was ever born. My house doesn’t exist anymore.

But I remember. I remember all of it.

And I know one thing for sure:

It’s still out there.
