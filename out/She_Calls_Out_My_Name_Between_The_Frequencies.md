My name’s Ethan Cross. I’ve been the voice in the dark for WXDN 108.3 FM for just over six years now; host of the late-night segment we call *Midnight Hour*. It’s not a flashy show, never made the top charts or got syndicated. We don’t get sponsors knocking on our door, and we sure as hell don’t trend online.

*But that’s never really been the point.*

*Midnight Hour* was built for the ones who live between days; you know the insomniacs, the long-haul truckers cruising through empty highways, the janitors polishing silent halls in empty buildings, the third-shifters who never quite adjusted to the rhythm of the sun. People who don’t belong to the daylight anymore, if they ever did.

They call in with the strangest stories. Some talk about lights in the sky, others about things they’ve seen at the edges of the woods or dreams that bled into waking. A few just want someone to talk to. *Anyone.* They all have that same tone in their voice; the quiet weariness of someone who’s been up too long with thoughts they can’t put down. I always let them talk. I figured that’s what the show was for. I never judged. Not even when someone swore their cat was speaking Latin in the middle of the night, or when one old woman insisted the moon was following her car. Ghost stories, conspiracies, confessions. it’s all welcome after midnight.

The thing about being a voice on the radio is… *no one really knows you*. They hear your tone, your cadence. But not your life. Not the parts that matter. And maybe that’s what I liked most about it. I could be whoever they needed me to be. A skeptic. A believer. A friend.

*But behind the mic… it’s just me.* And I’ve always been a solitary kind of man.

I didn’t plan on it. Life just curved in that direction, quiet and steady. One friend stopped calling. Then another. My father passed. My sister moved states away. The last woman I loved left a note on the kitchen counter and took the record player. The silence afterward stretched long, and I never quite found the edges of it. So, I gave it all to the radio. I gave my nights, my voice, and every inch of space I had inside me that was too hollow to fill with anything else.

Over time, the show became more than a job. It became the place I lived. My own private little orbit. I got used to the low hum of the equipment, the blinking red light on the phone panel, the comfort of my coffee going cold at 3 a.m. It was a kind of peace, the kind you make with yourself when there’s no one else around.

I always imagined that if anything were to happen to me, it’d happen right there in that booth. Not from anything dramatic or poetic. I wouldn’t choke mid-call or announce a haunting and drop dead. No headlines, no myths. Just a man going quietly into the dark, with his headphones on and the *on-air* sign still glowing.

*I’d be forgotten, eventually*. Another faint voice in the static.

And honestly… I thought I’d made peace with that.

But everything changed the night when *the static spoke my name*.

It was a Tuesday. 2:14 a.m. The kind of hour that doesn’t feel real. Time curls inward on itself, and everything starts to hum like an old fluorescent bulb on its last breath. The station lights flickered once, briefly, like even they were getting tired of me. I took another sip of my lukewarm coffee, grimaced, and set it down next to the soundboard with a gentle clink. The night had been dragging. Not in the peaceful, meditative way, but slow and sticky like wading through molasses with a full coat on.

I’d just hung up on a guy convinced the moon was hollow and that NASA had faked tides to cover it up. He sounded more tired than convinced, like he didn’t believe it either but needed someone to listen anyway. There was that familiar silence afterward; the kind that settles in the bones, stretches out its limbs in the absence of sound. I let it linger a second too long. Then the phone panel lit up.

*Line 3.*

That was odd. I rarely used Line 3. Usually kept it muted. It had a weird crackle in the signal. Engineering couldn’t ever fix it. I remember joking once that it sounded like ghosts lived in there. No one laughed though.

But tonight, it was blinking.

Steady. Patient.

I pressed the button, my finger hovering for just a beat too long before I spoke.

“You’re on *Midnight Echo.* Who’s this?”

Static. Not silence *just static*. Like something trying to claw through a wall of noise. At first, it was faint, barely audible. Then something came through it. Not words, not yet *just breathing*.

Raspy. Uneven. Like someone gasping through a pillow of snow. Then:

“…Ethan.”

I sat up straighter. I didn’t recognize the voice. It was soft, but strained. Young. Feminine. I cleared my throat.

“Uh… yeah. Who am I speaking to?”

A beat. Then the line shifted. A subtle pop in the frequency. And the next words came like a knife sliding through paper.

“Do you remember the pine tree behind your mother’s house?”

My stomach dropped.

I hadn’t spoken about my mother on-air. Not once. Not in six years. I keep that part of me behind the glass wall of the studio, behind the curated voice and the quiet late-night charm. I never even mentioned where I grew up. But that pine tree?

*It was real.*

Big, crooked thing, planted before I was born. It stood guard over our backyard like an old soldier. After my mother died; *car crash*, seven years old, too young to know how grief works there was a storm. Torrential rain, like the sky had cracked open. It tore down fences, power lines, even pulled a section of roof off the neighbor’s shed.

*But the pine tree never moved.*

It was the only thing that didn’t fall. I felt my mouth go dry. My pulse throbbed somewhere in my ears. I stared at the mic like it might offer me an answer. The air in the booth turned heavy, damp.

“Who is this?” I asked. A little sharper this time.

The line buzzed again. Not like interference more like a whisper trying to form but failing.

Then, faintly: “I’m cold.”

A sound barely more than a breath. But I heard it. I *felt* it. And then... nothing.

The line went dead. No click. No dial tone. Just the low, oppressive hush of the room pressing in from all sides. The kind of silence that leaves a ringing in your ears. I stared at the blinking panel for a long time. Five seconds. Ten. I don’t know. Just sat there, listening to my own breathing and the subtle tick of the second hand on the wall clock above the mixing board. My hands were still resting on the console, but they felt far away, like I wasn’t sure they belonged to me.

*That was weird*... I thought. But this kind of stuff happens. I merely chalked it up to a prank.

A weird one, sure, but not unheard of. Over the years, *Midnight Echo* had attracted its fair share of night-dwelling oddballs. People who wore tinfoil hats not ironically, who talked about reptilians and haunted interstates and government mind control through television static. I’d learned to expect the strange. It came with the time slot. But her voice… it lingered.

Even after I signed off for the night and stepped outside, even as the heavy studio door clunked shut behind me and the city buzzed in the distance, I felt her. Like she’d pressed her fingers not just on my skin but against the back of my eyes. She stayed with me in the silence between headlights, in the flicker of the hallway bulb outside my apartment. I told myself to forget. I didn’t.

The next night, 2:14 a.m. on the dot, Line 3 lit up again.

It blinked once. Then again. Steady as a heartbeat.

I stared at it longer this time. Something inside me twisted. I could’ve let it ring. I could’ve ignored it, blamed a glitch, filled the segment with reruns or ambient jazz until the hour slipped past.

But curiosity is a sick kind of hunger. And mine had teeth.

I reached for the switch, pressed it down slowly.

“You’re on *Midnight Echo.* You’ve reached Ethan.”

Static answered me. But this time, it was heavier more aggressive. Grainy, violent. Crackling like a thunderstorm had been caught in an old cassette tape and was now unraveling through the wires. My headphones hissed with it.

Then, her voice.

“Why did you stop playing piano?”

I went still. The kind of stillness that isn’t just physical, but emotional. Mental. Like something deep inside you locks up, refuses to go further. I hadn’t touched a piano in over ten years. Not since the accident anyway. Not since the blood on the asphalt, the shattered glass in my palm, the awful silence that followed where music used to live. I’d never spoken about it on air. Never let it leak through the polished persona, the late-night charm, the half-joking tone I used to deflect real memories. I didn’t even keep photos of those days anymore. No one knew about that night. No one should’ve known.

She spoke again, her voice warping now, pulled through some broken speaker on the edge of the world.

“You used to play her favorite song. Before the crash.”

My blood ran cold.

Her favorite song. Claire’s. I used to play it every Sunday afternoon on the baby grand in the den while she folded laundry in the next room, humming off-key, like it was just another ordinary day that would never end. But it did.

In one terrible moment, everything beautiful inside me collapsed.

I yanked off my headphones, breath ragged, fingers trembling like brittle leaves. The silence of the studio was suddenly unbearable, thick and full of ghosts. I reached for the switch, killed the line, the buzz, the sound everything.

“Who is this?”

Static came from the other end But I could still feel her raspy voice.

It didn’t echo in the room. It echoed in me. In my ribs. In the places I had long buried and forgotten, the ones I’d poured whiskey over for years just to keep quiet.

That night, I went home and prepared my meal mechanically; the flavors dull against the hollow ache inside me. After swallowing the last bite, I moved to my bed. The radio in the corner crackled to life, a low static hum filling the room. A voice, strained and trembling, began to speak through the haze.

“—reports flooding in from all cities… unprecedented seismic activity… skies ablaze with an unnatural fire… authorities urging everyone to seek shelter… this is not a drill.”

“Honey, we need to go. Soon.”

“Mom, it's fine. It’s the same bullshit as yesterday.”

“We can't afford to take chances—not anymore.”

“Is Dad ready?”

“Yes, sweetheart. They’re all just waiting on you.”

“Alright... I’ll grab the bags. “

Meeting them at the front door, dad already had the truck running, headlights cutting through the mist. Mom clutched her coat a little tighter around her shoulders, and my sister looked at me with worried eyes. 

“Got everything?” Dad asked, already reaching for the bags in my hands.

“I think” ... Just as I was about to shut the door behind us, a small tug on my sleeve stopped me.

“Where’s Mr. Buttons?” Rachel’s voice was barely a whisper.

I turned. She looked up at me, her eyes wide and scared, clutching the hem of her coat. “I forgot him,” she said. “He’s on my bed.”

Mom frowned. “Sweetheart, we don’t have time—”

“I know, I know. But she can’t sleep without it. I’ll be quick, I promise.” I backed toward the stairs. “Go on—I’ll meet you at the bunker.”

As they disappeared into the night, I turned and ran. The house groaned like it knew I shouldn’t be here. I always used to put others before me and have been doing it since I was born. I never objected to it either, I always accepted it. As I walked toward Zara’s room, I saw Mr. Buttons…..his fluffy bear arm pointed out to the balcony. 

Outside the sky gloomed an orange glow. I walked towards the balcony of my old house and I stood frozen. The wood beneath my feet creaked faintly. The air around me felt thick, almost liquid. Time seemed to twist around me, slipping away like water through my fingers. Below, crowds of people were frozen in place, yet they moved backward in slow, disjointed motion, their faces etched with confusion and despair.

*Oh God. It’s happening.*

Suddenly, the sky shattered open in violent fire. The sound of trumpets blasted through the air deep, relentless, overwhelming. My mind scrambled to summon the prayers I had learned by heart since childhood. But the words dissolved before they reached my lips. My tongue felt swollen, heavy paralyzed by an unseen force. Silence filled the void where my prayers should have been.

*I’m not a good Christian. I’m not worthy.*

Then, like a storm of wrath, angels descended immense and terrifying, bringing destruction in their wake. Fear clenched my heart, tears threatening to spill, but beneath the fear was a quiet relief. My family was safe. At least they were safe. And deep down, I knew I had never been among God’s favorites. Not truly. I was indeed destined for hell.

*Then, just as the world crumbled around me, I woke.*

The dream I stopped having after a long time. Maybe it’s her. Maybe she’s stirring it all up. Pulling old ghosts into the light.

*“Get out of my fucking head.”* I whispered

The next morning, I sat at my desk for hours, sifting through years of broadcast logs old paper records, archived tapes, forgotten notes scribbled in the margins of segment rundowns. I even dusted off the crumpled schematics of the phone system we hadn’t used since they upgraded our equipment in 2013. The station had digitized everything but somehow left the analog tapes behind.

Line 3 hadn’t been wired for inbound calls for years. It was supposed to be dead cut off after the fire that gutted our northern relay tower in the winter of 2009. I still remember the headlines: *Local Station Tower Burns Overnight — Cause Unknown.* The fire was blamed on an electrical fault, though some old-timers talked about self-sabotage.

I’d forgotten about it until that night, when I found an old sticky note inside a technician’s manual:

“Line 3 still live. Bad feed. Don’t patch. Static’s too thick; feels wrong. Haunted as hell.”

I remembered the guy who left that note. Kevin something. He used to joke that Line 3 had a mind of its own. “Static’s not just interference,” he said once. “It’s memory with nowhere to go.” I thought he was full of it. A burnout with too many ghost stories in his back pocket.

I didn’t go back on air the next night. Couldn’t bring myself to. I made up some excuse, called in sick. Sat alone in the station’s control room with just the dull red glow of the “ON AIR” sign buzzing overhead like a dying heart monitor.

*But Line 3 lit up anyway.*

The sound came through without me even touching the receiver.

*“You’re leaving me here.”*

The voice was raw, frayed around the edges. Like it had been scraped against metal. Like the static itself was chewing on her.

I didn’t answer. My throat locked. My fingers hovered over the console, unsure whether to pick up or pull the plug.

“Please… the static is getting worse. I can’t hold on much longer.”

Her voice broke halfway through, glitching in and out like a warped tape spool unraveling. I could hear something behind her words too—an ambient pressure, almost like wind trapped inside an engine.

I stayed silent. Not because I didn’t want to answer. But because I couldn’t. I didn’t know *how* to speak to her without collapsing.

Then her tone shifted.

“Do you remember that night in your garage? You were sixteen. You almost did it. You had the bottle and the pills.”

The color drained from my face.

I gasped. *She was right.*

No one knew about that. I never said a word. Not to my family. Not to the few friends I had back then. Not even to a therapist. It was a memory buried so deep I thought I’d sealed it for good.

That night, I’d sat in the corner of the garage with the engine turned off, holding a bottle of my mother’s painkillers and a warm bottle of gin I’d stolen from the pantry. It was December. The light above me flickered. I remember the shadows it made—how the rafters looked like they were closing in.

And then... something stopped me. Not fear. Not guilt. Just... a whisper. Not even a voice, really. More like a feeling that curled around me, firm and invisible, like a hand on my shoulder saying *“Not yet.”*

The line screeched an inhuman, ear-splitting sound that cut through the console and into my skull like a blade. I winced, my hands flying to my ears.

Then, softer:

*“I stopped you.”*

My whole body went cold. I leaned into the mic and whispered, “Who are you?” But there was only static. Endless, trembling static like the sound of someone trying to scream underwater.

*Was I losing my mind? No…. This feels too real.* I started researching. Not casually, not out of curiosity but obsessively, like a man trying to outrun a noose tightening around his neck. Sleep became optional. Food was an afterthought. Every waking moment I wasn’t at the station, I spent in front of my laptop or buried in dusty boxes in the archives.

I dug through every audio archive from the station’s history. Recordings no one had touched in decades. Half-erased tapes, corrupted digital files, forgotten reels with scribbled labels like *“UNCONFIRMED”*, *“TOO MUCH STATIC”*, or simply *“DO NOT AIR.”*

Some were just white noise. Others… weren’t.

Here and there, I heard voices. Distorted, broken transmissions always in the dead air between segments, often just before the hourly station ID. They would rise like bubbles in boiling water. Quick phrases. Gasped names. Laughter that didn’t belong to anyone in the room.

Old DJs had a name for it: *“The space between frequencies.”*

A thin band of audio no one intentionally broadcasted to, but where *something* always seemed to live.

I tracked down every former staff member I could find most had long left the business, a few refused to speak to me. But there was one a former engineer named Ritchie Barnes. He agreed to meet, but only at a dive bar forty miles out of town, well past dark. He was already a few drinks in when I got there. His hands trembled. His eyes were bloodshot, glassy. He wore two wedding rings.

“Line 3?” he slurred, taking a long pull from his whiskey. “Yeah. I remember Line 3.”

I asked what he meant. He didn’t answer right away. Just stared at the melting ice in his glass before finally muttering:

“She called me. My wife. Two years after the funeral. She said she missed me. Said she was cold.”

I thought he was joking until I saw the tears start to fall. Slow, quiet, like something leaking from a cracked pipe.

“I unplugged every goddamn cable in that booth after that,” he said. “It still rang for weeks.”

I left the bar shaken, clutching the napkin he'd scribbled on a time, a date, and the words *"Check the logs. She's louder on stormy nights."*

I needed answers. Not speculation, not folklore. I needed *truth*. So, I did something I hadn’t done since my mother’s funeral. *I went back to the pine tree.*

It stood behind the house I grew up in, just beyond the property line, where the woods began. When I was a kid, I thought it was the tallest tree in the world majestic, indestructible. But now, it looked different. Older. Gaunt. The needles were sparse, bark peeling. It was gray and skeletal, but rooted. And at its base, half-buried in the damp earth and dead pine needles, I found something strange. A corner of plastic glinting under the faint light of my phone’s flashlight. I knelt, brushed the dirt away with trembling fingers, and pulled it out.

*A cassette tape*.

Wrapped in faded plastic. No case. No explanation. Just a label, worn but still legible:

*“For Ethan. From Her.”*

My stomach dropped. The handwriting was delicate curling, precise familiar. My mother used to label her recipe cards like that. But she’d been dead for over a decade.

I held the tape in my hand, and for the first time since this all began, I felt something deeper than fear.

*Recognition.*

I brought it to the station that night. I didn’t tell anyone not my producer, not the night manager, not even the security guard who always nodded half-asleep at the front desk. I waited until the building emptied, until even the humming vending machines felt too loud, too alive.

With shaking hands, I slid the cassette into the ancient broadcast deck we kept more for decoration than use. The deck creaked like it remembered things I didn’t. I hit play, bracing for silence.

At first, that’s exactly what I got. A suffocating stillness that filled the booth, thick enough to feel.

Then static low and distant, not like the usual kind. This felt like wind screaming through wires, like grief through teeth. And then…*Her voice*. Clearer than ever…..Almost human.

“I’m in between. Not alive, not gone. I held onto your grief, your voice, your sin. You kept me here. But I’m fading now, Ethan.”

My throat tightened. The booth, already cold, felt like it had sunk beneath ice. I stood there, paralyzed. Her words echoed through me, stirred something I’d buried deep. She sounded… tired.

I didn’t know what to say. So, I spoke from somewhere raw and bleeding, a place I hadn’t touched in years.

“Who are you?”

There was a pause. Long. Endless. A silence so thick I could hear my own pulse, slow and thunderous. I thought she might be gone. That I had lost her again whatever *she* was.

Then:

“I’m what’s left when no one says goodbye.”

And just like that, the room changed.

The air shifted, heavy with something ancient and sorrowful. My breath came out in little clouds. The booth’s lights dimmed to a faint flicker, and every monitor buzzed like angry bees.

Then on the glass wall of the studio, the one that separated me from the recording room…. *I saw her*.

Just a flash. A reflection that wasn’t mine.

She stood behind me long dark hair hanging like drapes around a pale, unblinking face. Eyes like mist. Lips moving, whispering words I couldn’t hear. Not yet.

Then everything went black.

The tape stopped. The lights died. The static swallowed the silence whole.

*And I was alone. Or maybe I never had been.*

They found me the next morning, collapsed in the booth with my head resting against the glass. The cassette deck had long since stopped, the tape spooled out like entrails across the console. I was cold to the touch, my lips cracked, my skin pale. I was dehydrated, disoriented, barely responsive. They said I talked in my sleep for hours muttering fragments of her voice: *pine trees, songs, static, sorrow.* Words that made no sense to anyone else, but felt like a language only I remembered.

They called it a breakdown. Stress. Sleep deprivation. Paranormal suggestion, if they were feeling poetic.

WXDN shut Line 3 down permanently. Or at least, they tried. Tore the wiring out, sealed the feed behind a wall panel like it was some old wound they were too afraid to examine.

But every few weeks, the red light returns. 2:14 a.m., exactly. Always 2:14. Just a soft, steady blink like a heart that refuses to stop beating.

I don’t answer anymore. I tell myself I won’t. But I’ve caught myself standing in the hallway outside the studio, hand hovering near the switch. Listening. Waiting.

Sometimes, buried in the white noise between late-night commercials, I hear her humming. Just a few notes. My mother’s lullaby the one she used to sing before the pills, before the sirens, before the quiet house. Before the silence became something alive.

*She said I never said goodbye.*

But how do you say goodbye to something that was never fully here to begin with? Something that grew inside the spaces you forgot to grieve between childhood and loss, memory and invention?

*I don’t know what’s real anymore. I don’t know if I ever did.*

Last week, I woke up with soil under my fingernails and pine needles in my bed. My front door was locked from the inside.

Yesterday, I found a second cassette on my kitchen counter. No label this time. Just my name, scrawled in handwriting I swear I haven’t seen since I was sixteen.

I haven’t played it yet.

But I keep hearing it in my dreams. A voice, just behind the static, whispering;

"*Let me in.*"

The worst part?

*I think I already did. Line 3 is on again and I feel her standing behind me.*

I hope you understand the importance behind Goodbyes.
