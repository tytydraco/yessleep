The first shot sounded wrong.

Not because the rifle misfired. The round went clean, the recoil sat the way it always did in my shoulder, and the deer dropped like someone cut a string. It was a good shot. Ethical. Quick. The kind you tell yourself you’ll always take so you can sleep later.

What sounded wrong was everything after.

No second echo. No birds popping up mad from the brush. No squirrel barking at me like I’d personally ruined its day. Even the wind seemed to swallow itself.

I stayed kneeling behind my little hump of deadfall, watching the deer through my scope like I didn’t trust my own eyes. Ten seconds. Twenty. I counted to sixty because I didn’t know what else to do.

I remember thinking, stupidly, that the woods were holding their breath.

Then my ears caught it.

Not a sound. The absence of sound. Like someone shut a door on the whole forest.

I eased the safety on and stood. The ground was slick with last night’s frost. My boot soles did that crunchy leaf thing that makes you feel loud even when you’re trying to be a ghost. I scanned left to right.

The deer lay on its side in a patch of pale ferns, the white underside showing where it had rolled. It wasn’t a monster buck. It wasn’t even close. I wasn’t trophy hunting. I just wanted meat in the freezer and an excuse to sit somewhere my phone couldn’t reach me.

My phone was still in my chest pocket anyway. Old habit. It buzzed once on the walk in and I almost turned around. I’d told myself “no work, no texts, just a morning.” I’d even left my travel mug on the kitchen counter like a symbol of commitment, and I regretted it the second my fingers went numb.

I’d walked in before dawn, following orange flagging tape I’d tied to branches like breadcrumbs. I tie it every so often, not on a perfect schedule. I’m not that organized. I want to say every fifty yards, but it’s probably less. Sometimes it’s “that looks like a good branch, do it here,” because I’ve gotten turned around before and I hate admitting that too.

Now the light was the dull gray you get under thick clouds. No sun. Everything looked like a charcoal drawing someone kept smudging.

I should’ve been happy. I should’ve been grateful.

Instead I felt watched in a way that made my shoulders tighten and my jaw go hard without me noticing.

I approached the deer slowly, rifle angled down, eyes flicking from tree to tree. Every hunter has that moment, walking up on an animal, where you get a small dose of guilt. You murmur something. You touch the flank. You thank it, even if you don’t say the words out loud.

I didn’t get to do that.

When I was ten steps out, the deer’s ear twitched.

Not a death twitch. A deliberate, listening twitch.

I froze.

The deer’s side rose. Fell. Rose again.

My stomach went cold, and it had nothing to do with the weather. I brought the rifle up, thumb finding the safety by muscle memory, and I did the thing you’re not supposed to do with a downed animal. I aimed at its head.

The deer’s eyes were open. Too open. Not glazed. Wet and sharp.

And they weren’t looking at me.

They were fixed on something behind me.

I turned slow because my brain wanted to keep pretending it was nerves and nothing else. I didn’t want to give it the satisfaction of snapping around.

The brush thirty yards back was thick. Young pines. Saplings tangled through old logs. A place deer vanish into like smoke.

Something was standing in it.

At first it looked like a person in dull clothes. Another hunter. Some guy in brown Carhartt who’d wandered too close. My brain tried to hand me that explanation because it was the only one it liked.

Then it leaned forward, and the “clothes” moved with it like skin.

It wasn’t tall in a dramatic way. It was tall in the practical sense. Like something built wrong and forced to stand anyway. Too long in the torso. Arms hanging a little too low. Knees bending like the joints were in the wrong place but it had learned to fake it.

Its head was down, half-hidden by branches, and I caught a shine at its throat. Wet. Like spit.

I couldn’t see its face clearly, but I saw enough.

No eyes where eyes should’ve be. Just a smooth, dark plate of skin. But there were pits in it. Shallow thumbprint depressions arranged where eyes might be, as if something had pressed from the inside and left dents.

And it was holding something.

A strip of orange flagging tape.

Mine.

It lifted the tape between two thin fingers and let it flutter. It didn’t wave it like a person. It just watched it move. Studied it, almost. Like it was learning what air did.

My mouth dried out so fast my tongue felt like paper.

“Hey,” I called, because I’m an idiot and because my voice was the only thing in the world that still belonged to me. “You lost?”

The sound of my own words felt like breaking a rule.

The thing tilted its head. Not curiosity. More like it was lining itself up with my voice.

Then, from its throat, it made a noise that hit my ribs like a punch.

It wasn’t a growl. It wasn’t a scream.

It was my own “Hey,” thrown back at me, but wrong. Like it had been recorded underwater and played through a blown speaker. The pitch was off. The timing was off. The end of the word dragged too long, like someone pulling a finger across glass.

I took one step back without meaning to.

The deer on the ground made a sound too. A soft, breathy “huh,” like it was trying to speak.

I snapped my eyes down.

The deer’s mouth was open.

Its jaw moved.

Not chewing. Not twitching.

Mimicking.

It made that same awful “Hey,” barely audible. Like a whisper pushed through lungs that shouldn’t have been doing anything anymore.

My hands went numb around the rifle.

I backed up again, and my boot caught a root. I stumbled, caught myself, and that little clumsy movement must’ve been enough.

The thing in the brush shifted its weight.

And the silence in the forest deepened. Heavy. Total.

I didn’t think. I raised the rifle and fired.

The shot cracked through the quiet like tearing cloth. Branches burst. Pine needles puffed into the air. The thing didn’t flinch like a person. It moved like a reflex. It folded backward into the brush, and for half a second I saw the underside of its arms.

Not fur. Not sleeves.

Skin stretched thin and pale, with faint lines like healed scars.

Then it was gone.

I stood there breathing hard, rifle still up, ears ringing, throat burning. My whole body felt like it was trying to leave through my mouth.

The deer on the ground was still looking at me.

Its jaw moved again, slow and lazy.

“Hey,” it whispered, in my voice.

I didn’t do the careful, respectful thing. I didn’t reach for my knife.

I shot it again.

That second shot was messy. I hate that I did it. I hate the sound it made. But the moment the bullet hit, the deer went still in a way it hadn’t been before, and the forest gave me small scraps of normal back. A distant crow. A faint stir of wind.

The feeling didn’t leave, though. It stayed like pressure behind my eyes.

I looked toward the brush where the thing had been. Nothing. Just saplings and shadow.

My tape fluttered in its hand in my mind, and I suddenly understood something that made my stomach flip.

It hadn’t been lost.

It had been following me in.

I forced myself to move. I grabbed my pack, cinched it tighter, and started backing away from the deer. I couldn’t bring myself to drag it. Not then. Not with that thing close. I told myself I’d come back with someone else. With daylight. With noise. With a second pair of eyes that weren’t mine.

I headed for the tape line that led out.

The first ribbon was still tied to a low branch, bright against the gray woods.

The second ribbon was gone.

I stopped so hard my knees locked.

The tape didn’t just fall off. I knot my tape like I knot my boots. Hard. Mean. I can still feel the habit in my fingers.

I moved to the third marker.

Gone too.

That cold numbness in my hands came back thicker, like my blood had turned to creek water.

I turned in a slow circle, trying to spot my original landmarks. The crooked birch. The stump with the split top. The rock that looked like a kneeling dog. I’d noticed them on the way in, little brain-notes you make without thinking.

Everything looked the same when you were scared. Every tree became a stranger.

A sound came from deeper in the woods.

A branch snapping, careful. Measured.

Then my own breath, mimicked a few beats behind me.

I spun toward it, rifle swinging up.

Nothing.

Then a whisper from my right, close enough that it raised the hair on my neck.

“Hey.”

It wasn’t loud. It wasn’t even aggressive.

It was conversational. Like someone trying to get your attention in a grocery store aisle because you dropped your keys.

I pivoted right.

Still nothing.

The voice came again, farther away now, and higher. Like it was learning range. Learning what distance did to sound.

“Hey.”

My eyes burned from not blinking. My jaw clenched so hard it ached. I started walking faster, boots crunching, trying not to run because running makes noise and noise means direction.

Another branch snapped.

Closer.

Then the woods went quiet again, sudden and brutal, like someone flipped a switch.

No wind. No birds. No far-off road hum. Nothing.

Even my footsteps sounded muffled, like the ground was swallowing them.

That’s when I heard it behind me.

Not a voice.

Breathing.

Wet. Patient.

I whipped around and fired without aiming, a panic shot into the trees, and something answered me from the brush, not with a scream but with a hard, dry thud, like a fist hitting a trunk.

The thud hit again. Again. Again.

It wasn’t random.

It was moving tree to tree, matching my line, staying behind me.

Herding me.

I ran.

I hate admitting that because every hunting show and every tough-guy story says you don’t run. You keep calm. You assess. You act.

But I ran, because I could feel the thing’s attention like a hand between my shoulder blades.

The ground pitched downhill and my foot slid on wet leaves. I caught myself with my left hand on a tree and kept going, lungs burning, pack bouncing. Branches slapped my face. My rifle snagged on a vine and jerked and for a second I thought, ridiculously, “I paid too much for this sling for it to break right now.”

A sound to my left. Fast. Too fast for a deer.

I turned my head and it was there for a heartbeat, just enough for my brain to take a picture.

Not in the open.

Half-hidden behind a trunk, leaning out like a kid playing hide-and-seek.

The smooth face. The thumbprint pits.

And a grin.

Not lips. Not teeth.

A split in its face that opened and closed, showing something pale inside like the soft underside of a tongue.

The grin made my stomach drop because it meant it knew what it was doing.

I fired at it. The bullet hit bark. The thing pulled back out of sight like it had never been there.

I turned forward and ran harder.

The trail I’d walked in on should’ve intersected a shallow creek. A little ribbon of water with muddy banks. I was counting on it because I could use it as a guide, follow it until I found the wider cut that led toward the service road.

I burst through ferns and saw the creek.

Relief hit so hard it almost made me laugh.

Then I saw orange tape tied to a branch over the water, dangling like bait.

I didn’t tie tape there.

The knot was wrong. Loose. Sloppy.

A small splash came from the creek, and something pale slid under the surface like a hand withdrawing.

I froze at the bank, rifle up, every nerve screaming not to step closer.

Behind me, a voice whispered, almost fond.

“Hey.”

I spun, and the thing was closer now, fully out of the brush, standing between two trees like it had always belonged there.

It held more tape in one hand. A whole fistful. My path, taken apart.

And it took one slow step toward me.

I raised the rifle and shouted, “Stop!”

The forest swallowed the word. My voice sounded thin. Like it didn’t have authority out here.

The thing’s grin opened.

And it said, clearly, in my voice but cleaner now, practiced:

“Stop.”

It took another step.

My finger tightened on the trigger.

The rifle clicked.

No bang.

My breath hitched so hard it hurt.

I had chambered a round. I know I did. I felt it. I heard it. Unless I’m losing my mind, which was a thought I hated having right then.

But the bolt was open.

Someone had opened it.

Me? No.

My hands were on the stock. Always had been.

The thing tilted its head and the pits in its face caught the gray light like bruises.

Then it moved.

It didn’t charge like an animal. It didn’t sprint like a person.

It folded forward and came at me in quick sliding steps, like its feet didn’t need traction. Like it was being pulled.

I dropped the rifle and reached for my sidearm, but I wasn’t fast enough.

Something slammed into me from the side, hard. Not the creature’s body.

A branch.

A whole dead limb swung like a club, whipped by something I didn’t see, and it caught my ribs and knocked the air out of me.

I went down on one knee, hands scrabbling for balance, pain blooming hot and immediate. When I tried to inhale, my left side seized and gave me a shallow, ugly wheeze instead of a full breath.

The thing was on me.

Not pinning me. Not wrestling.

Just close. Too close.

Its hand came up and touched my cheek with the lightest pressure, like it was checking my skin the way you check the ripeness of fruit.

Cold fingers. Dry. Almost powdery.

I smelled it then.

Not rot. Not blood.

That sharp clean smell you get when you split fresh wood, mixed with something metallic.

The creature leaned in, and the split in its face opened wider.

A wet sound rolled out and a voice came with it. Mine, layered over something else like two recordings playing at once.

“Don’t run.”

My heart kicked so hard I saw spots.

I shoved at it more out of panic than strength, and my palm hit its chest.

It felt wrong under my hand. Not fur. Not muscle.

Like tight stretched leather over something hollow.

The thing’s hand snapped down and grabbed my wrist.

Its grip was immediate pain. Not crushing bone, but digging in, pinching, like it knew exactly where nerves sat close to skin.

I yanked back and it came with me smooth and effortless.

Then it did something small and cruel.

It leaned toward my ear and whispered, very softly, in my own voice:

“Hey.”

I jerked away, and as I did, something sliced across my forearm.

I didn’t see a claw. I didn’t see teeth.

It was like it had a thin edge hidden somewhere, a sharpened piece of itself.

Blood popped warm against the cold air.

Fear turned into a kind of furious panic.

I slammed my elbow into its face, into that smooth plate, and felt the impact travel up my arm like hitting a wall. The creature’s head barely moved.

But it let go.

I rolled backward into the creek bank, mud soaking my pants, and I clawed for my dropped rifle, fingers slipping on wet leaves. My injured forearm burned when I flexed it, and my hand wanted to cramp shut like it was already trying to protect itself.

The thing stepped back, watching me. Patient. Like it knew time belonged to it.

My hand found the rifle. I yanked it up, jammed the bolt forward, and for a split second it didn’t want to close. Something was in the chamber.

Orange tape.

A tiny strip, shoved in there like a joke.

My breath came out as a sound I didn’t recognize.

I ripped the tape free, tossed it, slammed the bolt down, and fired from the ground.

This time the shot hit.

The creature jerked, not from pain, but from surprise. It stumbled a half-step, and the split in its face opened and closed rapidly like a mouth trying to form words.

It didn’t bleed.

Instead, a dark smear appeared where the bullet hit, like bruised sap seeping through bark.

The smell hit me again, stronger. Fresh-cut wood and pennies.

The creature made a noise that wasn’t my voice. The first sound it made that felt like it belonged to it.

A low vibrating hum that made my teeth ache.

Then the forest went quiet in one violent gulp.

Everything stopped.

And the thing smiled wider.

Because now it knew I could hurt it.

And it was excited.

It turned its head slightly, listening, like it was hearing something I couldn’t.

Then it stepped back into the trees smooth as smoke and vanished.

The silence held.

I lay there in the mud breathing in short careful pulls because anything deeper sent a knife of pain through my ribs. I kept the rifle up, aimed at the spot where it had disappeared, waiting for it to come back and finish the job.

It didn’t.

Not right away.

After a long minute, sound returned in tiny doses. A distant bird. A faint rustle of leaves. My own ragged breathing loud in my skull.

I forced myself to stand. My legs shook. My left side felt like it had been hit with a bat. My forearm was slick and warm, the cut longer than I’d thought, not deep enough to kill me but deep enough to make my grip unreliable.

I didn’t go for the deer. I didn’t even look back toward the clearing.

I followed the creek because at least water doesn’t lie about where it’s going.

Every so often behind me I’d hear it.

A branch snap.

A soft wet inhale.

And once, so faint I almost convinced myself it was in my head:

“Hey.”

Not close.

Not far.

Just enough to let me know the game was still on.

I made it out of the woods with blood drying on my sleeve and mud up to my knees, and I didn’t stop moving until I saw the dull shine of my truck through the trees.

Even then, I didn’t feel safe.

Because when I reached for the door handle, I saw something tied to it, fluttering in the cold air.

A bright strip of orange tape.

Knotted wrong.

Loose.

Waiting.

I grabbed the handle anyway and my hand slipped, slick with blood, scraping my knuckles raw against the cold metal. The pain made me gasp, and the sound felt loud enough to point an arrow right at me.

From somewhere in the tree line behind my truck, my own voice whispered, friendly as a neighbor trying to get my attention in a parking lot:

“Hey.”
