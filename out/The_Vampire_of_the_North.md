Baking in the sun, cold beer, and my children playing in the yard. What more could a man ask for? Late thirties enjoying my early retirement, with my beautiful queen and my precious children. I did a couple tours in Iraq and some other mind bending black ops mission. My award for being the perfect boot licking American hero. Hundreds of innocent bystanders' blood soaked deep into my soul. But hey, early retirement with the white picket fence in the suburbs aren't too bad. 

In my early days I was recruited into a special classified group. The code name for the group was Expunge. The name said it all. When America needed something handled—silent, quick, and destructive—we were the ones they called. I was the medical specialist of the group, but that didn’t mean I wasn't extensively trained on how to kill. The leader of the group was Hugo, former CIA agent and real smartass. The guy knew his shit I will give him that. Diligent strategic mastermind is what most people would say. That best way I could describe Hugo, is an intelligent, cunning, courageous guy who was willing to put his life on the line for you. 

The shitstorm I'm in right now boils down to a blood pact between us. 

It was a gloomy Saturday morning. I was cooking some eggs and bacon for my little kids.

RING RING RING

Unknown number calling. I got a little weary but picked up. 

“Hey buddy it’s been a while” 

I hesitated but hastily spat “Hugo? What do you want? My wife is out of town and I'm watching the kids for the weekend not the time.”  

Hugo states “Woah so feisty Archie. Just let us in, we are waiting outside”.

I hung up. I quietly creep up to the peephole. Sure enough, Hugo was right at the door with a grin from ear to ear. He was accompanied by a younger lanky kid. Kid couldn't be older than twenty.

I swing open the door and usher them in. 

Hugo strolls in. "Nice place, Archie. Even got the white fences. 401k holding up?"

I scowl. "You can't just show up after years—and with a kid?"

I glared at him getting more visibly frustrated. 

“Hugo, I'm retired. You show up with some random kid at my doorstep.”

Hugo smirks. "Called first—made sure your wife wasn’t home. And the kid? Not ordinary. His name is Quincy. Sniper prodigy. Yakzu clan. Don't talk much." Quincy just nods at me, pitch black eyes staring me down. I’ve heard rumors about the Yakzu clan. The clan took territory in Tokyo Japan and was known for training the best assassins. Very cruel method of training, normally kids would be enrolled by age seven. The only thing I know for sure about the clan, was to graduate once you hit age 16 you must kill your instructor or be killed. 

I stated “So you’re bringing kids into your shit. Using the young naive brats as killing machines huh?”

Quincy was dozing off then snapped his head back. Quincy proudly says, “I am here on my own will, and I am no child.”

Hugo laughing then says “Working for a new organization, DHA. Demon Hunting Association”. 

I tilt my head in a confused look. “What the fuck did you just say?”

Hugo sits down, “Yeah Demons, monsters, the invisible men, all fucking real. That's why I'm here. I need someone good, someone I trust, a reliable helping hand, not scared of shit.

Monsters how is that even possible this had to be some mind fucking thing to get me to say yes.

I state “Nope not a chance in hell. I’m retired Hugo, no amount of money will bring me back out for this fucked up game you’re playing”. 

Hugo smirks, “You owe me a favor, forgot about the blood pact”

I state, “Fuck, seriously Hugo”.

 “Dead serious ole buddy”.

I state “okay let me call my parents to watch the kids this weekend. You get three days out of me Hugo that’s it, you understand me”.

Hugo pulls out his hand, “Clear as a whistle. Only take two days and you will be back in time to live out your boring family man life”.

I regrettably shook his hand. After a couple minutes of begging my parents, they finally agreed to watch the kids. I say a quick goodbye to my children, still in bed, and head off with Hugo and Quincy. I sent out a text to my wife telling her the situation, she knew this was always a possibility of me getting called back into duty. She understood and told me she loves me and to be safe. She knew the truth about the man I was, the unspeakable things I endured, but she accepted me and loved me for who I was. God, I miss her so fucking bad.

I state, “Okay Hugo give me some details about what you got me wrapped up in this time”. 

Hugo laughing says, “Don't shit yourself Archie, take a look at this”. 

He throws me back a brown folder with writing that states, Vampire of the North. I examine the details of the target. Furio Gomez, 8 foot 3, 240 pounds, skin white as the snow. Just recently came across the government's radar for gruesome murders publicly displayed. Location, small college town in Connecticut. That was the whole folder. Absolutely nothing to go on, almost a wild goose chase at this point. I keep quiet the whole drive. Wondering if such creatures exist.

We arrived at a private hangar, and I saw a familiar face next to the jet. 

I quickly hop out of the car and see my old buddy from the unit.

“Jazz you motherfucker, how have you been?” As I go in for a hug.

“I’ve been better, my boxing career is on the downhill, but other than that, same old shit.”

I knew Jazz from the old unit with Hugo. He was my closest friend during that time, saved my ass more than I can count. I was a little surprised he stayed in the unit for so long, he was a known hothead. Very impulsive, had a sense or moral obligation of justice. 

We all load in the jet. Jazz begins reading the file.

“Vampire? What is this bullshit code name?”

An older man walks in. Smell of alcohol reeks onto the jet. He is wearing a raggedy bomber vest with camo cargo pants. 

“Not a code name son, the real fucking deal.” he states

Jazz scoffs. "No such thing. This is the real world."

The older man swigs from his flask. "Not for long."

Hugo stands up gathering everyone's attention, “Alright everyone this is Jack. He has been in this business for years, he has valuable insight. Now let me state this off, the vampire is real and very deadly.”

My eyes widen as I begin to question this whole operation. Jazz is speechless—surprising for the mouth he had on him. The jets begin to take off. I lean back in my chair, dozing off.

As soon as we land, we all quickly load up in a limo-tinted black SUV. The first stop is an abandoned motel on the outskirts of town. An old, run-down place. I follow behind the group as we head for room 21. The DHA is very fruitful in supplies when we arrive. They have everything we need to execute this mission. We quickly load up on our gear. Hugo gives us a recap of the plan.

For this night, we will stake out in the town. We will be separated into three groups at specific vantage points. The only objective is to recon and gather intel. The first group is Hugo and Jazz. They will be stationed at the top of the parking garage. The second group is Quincy and me. We are located on the top of a hotel. That leaves the veteran, Jack, to be on ground zero, patrolling. We will be scoping out a huge park in the middle of town. Hugo says we will find him hunting in the park late at night.

We all load up together and drive off before dusk. I am sitting next to Jack on the ride.

"Have you ever dealt with a vampire before?" I mutter.

Jack scoffs. "The young ones, yeah. Not the big boys, though—little rarer and smart."

"You think the one we are after is old?"

Jack's demeanor quickly switches. "This abomination? Probably a few hundred years old. Why do you think they sent a crew out here for extermination?"

It makes sense that the stronger ones would be older. But that means they are smarter. Gruesome killings are not just for fun, he wants us to know he is here. My nerves shoot throughout my legs as we approach the town.

We first drop Jack at the park. I tell him, "Best of luck."

Jack snaps back, "Just another payday for a greedy man."

Jack is also the least geared-up out of all of us. He wears a huge dark green coat, bringing only a 1911 handgun and a sawed-off shotgun. The confidence that man has is unobtainable by most.

Quincy and I arrive at our destination. As we hop out of the car, Jazz looks at me.

"Be careful out there, Archie."

I nod in agreement.

Quincy and I stagger up to the entrance. Quincy is carrying a briefcase with his disassembled Remington 700 XCR Bolt-Action Rifle. We are greeted by a short man with slick black hair. He welcomes us and leads us to the back with an elevator separated from the public. He glances at us one last time and says, "Happy hunting, gentlemen."

As we ride up to the top floor, I question how strong of ties this organization has within the world. We get to the top. The sun begins to set. The atmosphere around us turns bleak and bitter. We set up.

Hugo over the line: "We're all set up, gentlemen. Let's set up the cameras and be alert."

We waited a couple of hours, watching the nightlife of the drunk college students downtown. I try to start a conversation with Quincy. "So, how'd you end up in this line of business?"

He shrugs his shoulders in annoyance. "The DHA enlisted me after I graduated."

I peck, "Good paycheck, I bet. What's the reason you joined, though?"

Quincy, "Doesn't matter. I kill. It's what I was born to do."

I muttered under my breath, “Really insightful.”

Quincy quickly rebuttals, “I was raised to be the best. My childhood was filled with training and killing, it’s the only thing I know in life.”

It is really depressing seeing how robotic this kid is. Bad parents who would have thought.

About an hour goes by. I pick up a young, intoxicated college woman walking toward the park by herself. The park is empty. We haven't seen a soul enter or leave for the past two hours. I nudge Quincy to keep his sights on her. She is stumbling around, barely on her two feet. I radio over to the others, telling them the situation. The woman makes it to the edge closest to Hugo and Jazz. There's a bathroom. She stumbles in.

I keep zooming in on the entrance, waiting for her to leave. In a flash, a black shadowy figure sweeps in. It was so fast. I radio over, alerting everyone that something is in there with her. My gut begins to sink. I knew my instincts were not off—I saw it.

Hugo over the line: "All eyes on the bathroom."

Minutes go by. I don't know what to expect. Then a dark creature from hell slowly walks out. Its pale skin is covered in blood. The prince of darkness ready to reckon hell on Earth. We all hear a scream of utter terror erupt from the bathroom. It is the woman. She is still alive.

I overhear Jazz on the comms. "Fuck, Hugo, we have to go in. She's alive."

They begin to bicker at each other over the line. I look over to the parking garage and see Jazz starting to scale down, making a run for the park.

Hugo over the line: "Jazz, get the fuck back here. You're putting the mission in jeopardy."

Quincy over the line: "Target is still in view. I have a shot. Do I take it, Hugo?"

Hugo: "No. Everyone stays back. We do not engage."

Jack is completely silent.

I see Jazz bolting in a full sprint, about to intercept the vampire.

I say, "Hugo, we have to do something. Make a call."

Hugo angrily says, "Everyone stay the fuck back. We do not engage."

Jazz says, "Fuck you, Hugo. I'm not going to stand there and watch a poor woman die to this thing." I see Jazz throw his earpiece to the ground.

Hugo: "God dammit, Jazz."

I bite my lip, preparing myself for the anticipation of Jazz going head-to-head with this beast. I look at Quincy and say, "You have to take the shot before Jazz gets there, or he is as good as dead."

He shakes his head. "Don’t engage."

All I can do is sit back and watch.

Jazz closes the distance quickly, sprinting straight at the creature. The vampire turns its head unnaturally fast, locking eyes with him. For a moment, it doesn't move, as if intrigued by this human charging straight at it.

Then, in the blink of an eye, it vanishes from where it stood.

"Where the fuck did it go?" I hiss over the radio, scanning wildly.

Quincy tightens his grip on the rifle, adjusting his sightline. "Lost visual. Shit."

Jazz skids to a stop in front of the bathroom. He looks around frantically, weapon raised. The woman’s scream echoes out again, raw and desperate.

Then—

A blur.

The vampire slams into Jazz from above, sending him flying across the pavement like a ragdoll. He crashes into a park bench with a sickening crunch.

"JAZZ!" Hugo’s voice explodes in my earpiece. "Fuck! Fuck! Move in! Jack, get in there now!"

Jack is already sprinting from the other end of the park, shotgun in hand. I see him pump the sawed-off as he barrels forward.

"Quincy, take the shot!" I shout.

"I don’t have a clear—"

The vampire is on Jazz in a second, clawed fingers wrapping around his throat. It lifts him like he weighs nothing, tilting its head, studying him. Jazz thrashes, struggling, but the thing barely acknowledges him. Then, slowly, it bares its fangs.

A deafening gunshot rings out.

The vampire’s head jerks sideways as a crimson mist burst from its skull. But it doesn’t drop Jazz.

Quincy curses. "That should’ve killed it!"

Jack reaches them first, raising the shotgun point-blank. He pulls the trigger.

The blast tears into the vampire’s chest, sending it stumbling backward. Jazz drops to the ground, gasping, clutching his throat.

"Move!" Jack roars, pumping another shell into the chamber.

The vampire recovers unnaturally fast, turning its gaze toward Jack. Its black, lifeless eyes seem almost amused.

Then it vanishes again.

"Eyes on!" Hugo barks. "Where did it—"

Too late.

Jack was thrown to the bushes in a fierce manner.

I radio over, “Jack, do you copy? Fuck Hugo.”

Hugo said, "Everyone just remain calm."

I look over at Hugo, leaning on the edge of the roof. I glance back at the bathroom, seeing Jazz crawling, slashed to hell and back.

I radio over, "Hugo, I’m moving in. Fuck your orders—this whole operation is sideways."

Hugo shouted, "Archie, sit your ass down and—AHHHHHH."

My ears perk up. I yell at Quincy, "Eyes on Hugo!"

I look through my binoculars. I see Hugo’s corpse dangling over the side. I gasp in concern. Then I see the Vampire of the North raise his hand, slitting Hugo’s throat in one motion. In a second, Quincy lets off a shot. It hits the beast in the shoulder, and he falls back into the shadows.

"Oh fuck, Quincy, this is bad. I’m moving in on Jazz and Jack."

I saw the first sign of emotion from Quincy. His voice trembled. "Okay, I will watch your back."

Something finally struck a chord in the kid. I rushed down the elevator and hit the button for the ground floor. I couldn’t even process Hugo’s death at the moment. I ran in the direction of the park, ringing out on the comms, calling for Jack. I get no answer. 

I arrive at the bathrooms. Jack’s body is nowhere to be found. Jazz, barely conscious and in bad shape, looks up at me.

"Archie, get the hell away—it’s a trap."

I disregard what he says and begin patching up his wounds. None of them were deep puncturing wounds, more like slashes. The wind starts to pick up speed. The feeling of despair lingers around me. I glance behind, seeing red eyes staring back. I step back, unholstering my pistol. The beast rushes toward me. I let off three shots. In a second, the vampire's claws are pinned inside my right arm. The thing grins at me, flashing his bloody fangs.

The vampire speaks. "Silly, silly humans. I can’t wait to taste you." His jaw gapes open, edging closer to my neck.

Then Quincy lets off a direct hit to the vampire’s chest. He backs up into the bathroom, holding cover. Hiding in the shadows.

The vampire snickers, "I will kill you first and then leave your friend on top of the roof for dessert."

I swallow my fear and begin to stand up, noticing my injuries but not bothered by the pain. I slowly pick up my handgun and begin to aim at the vampire. Then the thing rushes toward me. In a flash, Jack appears, holding his shotgun, blowing the vampire's lower torso to shreds.

Jack says, "Miss me, motherfucker?"

He pulls out his 1911, letting shots ring out. The vampire is tanking most of the bullets until Quincy lets off another shot, hitting the side of its face. That sure put the thing in a sour mood. The vampire was still extremely agile after all the bullets it had endured. I notice the sun quickly rising above us. The vampire's skin begins to scorch and lets out a roar of agony. Then it takes off in the opposite direction, leaving no trace.

I collapse to ground and let out a sigh of relief.

Jack pats me on the back and points towards Jazz.

Jack and I were able to get Jazz out of there safely and patch him up. It was too late for the woman. The vampire left her in a pool of her own blood. She didn’t deserve that fate. She had so much life left in her.  

We all gathered back at the safe house. Jazz was resting—it would probably take a couple of weeks for his injuries to heal. Jack, Quincy, and I debated on continuing the mission without Hugo. Jack was accomplished enough to take over the operation. Quincy urgently agreed to keep working on the mission. Then it just left me.

Hugo was my boss for a couple of years, but he was more of a friend to me. The way his body just dangled on side, nonresponsive shook me to my core. I wanted revenge. This vampire has probably been terrorizing people for hundreds of years. It needed to be put down for good.

This was only day one. We had already lost our captain. We should just call it a day, lick our wounds, and let another team take over. I have no obligation to stay. Hugo’s dead. The blood pact means nothing anymore. I can just go back to my wife and children and live out my life.

I can’t go back. I have to finish what we all started. It’s been a couple of days since day one. Jack found out where he lives. We are going there tonight. We will end it—for Hugo, the poor college student, and everyone who has been killed by him.

I miss my wife, but this must be done.

Fucking Vampire of the North.

If you don’t hear an update from me, then you know what happened.
