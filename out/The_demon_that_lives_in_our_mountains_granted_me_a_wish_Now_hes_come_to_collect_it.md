The villagers say a demon in our mountains grants wishes, but not for free.

People here are all religious and superstitious. 

Our region is well known for its folklore legends. Beings, good or evil, that inhabit the mountains, valleys, or large forests.

My favorite is the story of the spirit called “Koziar”. A devil-like demon that resides in our mountains. 

He bears the look of a mountain goat, with yellow gazing eyes that see through your soul. 

His hooves clatter on the mountain rocks in a melody that sounds like the clicking of bones. 

Koziar hides his true self behind a charming, patient facade.

Soon, you would tell him all your darkest secrets and desires. He has the power to loosen anyone's tongue. 

The Koziar will then make you a proposition. He could make anything you wished come true. 

You wouldn’t have to give anything in return, but if you wanted your agreement to be overturned. He would silence you, blind you, and deafen you to the world.

Nearby, a king lived in a castle long ago. He didn’t have a fondness for criminals. Any minor crime would be punished in the way of the Koziar. 

Gouging your eyes, pulling your tongue out, and pouring molten wax into your ears. 

He would then send the criminals to wander.

The people from the surrounding villages would often find them still running in the mountains, making inhumane sounds. That’s how the legend of Koziar was born.

Not so long ago, I was at one of my neighbours' houses. We played cards and drank. The time passed so fast that I barely noticed the sun had gone down. 

I stood up, my whole world spun around, my vision blurred, and I started falling. 

We decided that it was time to put the bottle down. He helped me dress up, and I walked out of the front door.

I thought I had walked the distance to my house, but wherever I looked, I only saw dark and tall rocks. I stumbled upon a small path that led up into the mountain. 

I sat on one of the rocks nearby and decided to cool off for a second. I was about to get up, but then I heard some faint cluttering. 

It sounded like an ossuary choir playing the parts of their fallen comrades as instruments. 

The melodic cracking of bones, the legends talked about.

I looked up, and a mountain goat was standing above me. 

His hair was as dark as the night. His horns glowed under the starlight, and his eyes shone through the dark like sulfur. 

I jumped up. Cold sweat formed on my back, my feet started shivering, and I was breathing heavy.

“Hello, dear traveler, what are you doing all the way up here?” His voice was soft and soothing. My feet stopped shivering almost immediately, and I was able to catch my breath.

“You’re not real.” I whispered to myself.

“Oh, I’m real. Can’t you see me standing in front of you? Can’t you hear my voice speaking to you?”

I thought I was seeing things. I stood looking at it silently.

“I’m not an illusion, my friend, and I know you know I’m not one. I’ve been with you your whole life. Even if you didn’t know it.”

“I was deep inside of your heart, seeing all the troubles that you’ve experienced, all the misfortunes that the world laid on you.”

“I can see how you were not treated well again. You wanted to enjoy a simple night with your friend, drinking your favorite drink over a deck of cards, and your own brain and stomach decided to turn on you. Conspire against you. Let me help you, my friend.”

He tapped his hoof three times. A delicate sound echoed each time through the mountains.

My vision cleared, I regained my balance, my head stopped thumping, and my stomach felt fine again. 

Unfortunately, I was not drunk anymore, but I felt well again, almost like I hadn't drunk any alcohol.

“Who are you? Explain yourself!” I yelled out at that thing with confusion in my voice.

The creature standing on the rock mesmerized me. It made me feel like I was talking to a caring mother and the devil himself.

“You know who I am. You always knew who I was.”

“My name is unspeakable by the vocal cords, unwriteable in any human language, but the people in your village gave me a name long ago.”

“That name is Koziar, and perhaps you can tell that I already know your name, my dear friend, so no need to introduce yourself.”

“Thank you for helping.”

“No need for thank yous, my friend. I will gladly do anything to ease your troubles.”

I felt like I could trust him with anything. That he would fix all my misfortunes. I only had to tell him. 

“Please don’t hesitate. There’s no reason to. It’s only us standing here. You and me. Anything you need will be fixed.”

“There’s this woman I’m in love with. Her name is Hana. I’ve been in love with her for the past 40 years. Ever since we were children, I couldn’t take my eyes off her.” 

“She is and always was beautiful. Her eyes are blue as the mountain creek, her golden hair shines in the sun, and her skin is soft as the forest's moss.”

“She smiles like an angel, and her voice is like music to your ears.”

“Unfortunately, she’s married to another man. A carpenter from our village. He’s a good man. Everyone respects him, but I can’t. He took the love of my life from me.”

“Not a day passed by that I didn’t think of her.”

“What’s your wish then, my friend?”

“My wish is for her to fall in love with me.”

“Your wish shall be granted, but remember what happens if you decide to reverse it.” His voice now sounded rusted and crackling.

Koziar then got down on four legs, bleated, and quickly ran away.

I stood there for a moment, dazed like I woke up from a vivid dream. 

I didn’t know if what I saw was real.

When I walked into my living room, I hung my coat and went to bed, not even taking my clothes off.

Soon after, I was fast asleep, dreaming. 

My whole village was burning down, people were running around screaming, children, men, and women alike. Hana stood next to me. Her eyes glowed like the Koziars.

I screamed out for Koziar to take it all away, and then I woke up in complete darkness. I couldn’t see, hear, or speak. 

I tried to feel around myself, but there was nothing around. I tried to run, but the ground turned to mud and I kept falling.

I woke up in a pool of sweat. A fading sound of hooves knocking on rock echoed in my head. I could still feel the mud on my hands, but when I looked down, they were clean. 

I managed to calm myself down, but I still wasn’t sure if my encounter with the Koziar yesterday was a hallucination or reality.

I was eating lunch in my kitchen when I heard loud and frantic knocking at the door. One of my friends from the village was standing outside panting.

“Come. Hana’s husband died, and she’s asking for you. She won’t let anyone else comfort her.” He said, trying to catch his breath. I stood in the doorway, bewildered.

As we ran to their house, my neighbour explained that Hana’s husband didn’t wake up this morning. 

Hana hasn’t stopped crying since she found him, and she is asking for me and refusing any comforting from her sons or her mother.

When I came into the house, she immediately ran to me and tried to hug me.

She looked at me with her beautiful eyes, but I saw a shade of yellow glowing in that blue ocean. Her pupils bore a strange shape. I hesitated, but then I decided to embrace her.

I could feel her tears running down my shoulder, but the longer I held her, the more she calmed down. Soon after, she stopped crying.

I held onto her tighter, and she tightened her squeeze back. 

Was this the work of the Koziar? Did he make my wish come true? Was I not dreaming last night? 

Either way, Hana stood here now, with a look of love in her face.

When she let go, she was smiling with that beautiful smile of hers, holding onto my hands. 

I looked around me. Her family and other townsfolk standing in the room were staring at us in bewilderment and concern. I could feel their eyes stabbing through me.

One of Hana's sons thanked me for helping them, but said that they would like to resolve this matter privately. 

Hana started protesting, but her mother dragged her away to the other room.

I walked out the door, trying not to stare at anybody so that I wouldn’t have to see the disapproving looks in their eyes.

I felt the warmth rise and fall over my body. I felt bad for what her family had to go through, but did it really matter? Hana was mine now.

Warnings of Koziar were forgotten. The idea that this unbelievable reality, this gift he blessed me with, could somehow turn against me was not possible.

I woke up early the next morning. I looked out the window, rubbing my eyes, but the sun was not rising yet. I could remember a strange noise waking me up, but I couldn’t hear anything now.

I was about to go back to sleep, but then I heard it again, a faint knock on the door. 

I opened them, and on the other side stood Hana. Her whole face lit up.

“What are you doing here?”

“I couldn’t wait to see you, my love.” She pushed the door open and hugged me. Hugged me the same way she did the day before.

She felt warm, her hair smelled like I remembered, and I could feel her body pushing against mine.

We stayed like this for a few minutes. I told her to come inside.

I took her hand and sat her at my kitchen table. She watched my every move with that loving gaze as I fixed us coffee.

“My family was against my decision. They didn’t want me to come here to you, but I rebelled. I knew I had to rebel.”

She kissed and embraced me.

The evening came, and Hana realised she didn’t have any clothing for the next day. I was an old bachelor, and I had given out all the clothing from my late mother.

“I’m afraid we have to go back to my old house, my love.”

“I’m afraid so too.”

We walked down to her house, and Hana knocked. Her son opened the door. For a second, he had a look of relief, until he saw me standing behind Hana. 

They argued for a while. He didn’t want to let me in. Hana managed to persuade him, but he said I couldn’t go any further than the kitchen. 

We decided to agree on this. Hana said she would soon be back and ran into her old bedroom.

While I was waiting for Hana, her other son came out of his room. Once he saw me standing in their kitchen, he froze for a second. His face twisted in anger.

“What is he doing here?!” He yelled at his younger brother.

His brother tried to answer his question, but before he could finish, he turned to me and started walking towards me.

“What have you done to our mother?! You put a spell on her, you goddamn devil!” He screamed out.

A feeling of dread filled my mind. Hana and his younger brother tried to tell him to stop, but he got closer and pushed me against the wall. 

He now stood before me, digging into my chest with his finger, screaming in my face.

I could see the tiredness in his eyes, the big black bags under them. His breath smelled, and he looked unclean. 

He didn’t have it in him to take care of himself now after his father's passing and his mother's departure.

He was screaming in my face, but in his eyes, I now saw more hurt than anger. For a second, I started feeling bad for him. I now felt like a perpetrator of all of his problems.  

“Maybe I should make Hana return and let the family grieve.” Quickly passed through my mind, but then I felt his fist strike my face.

I could feel my ears ringing, and an iron taste of blood formed in my mouth. A dull pain pulsated in my left temple.

My eyes quickly darted over the room. There was a pan sitting on the kitchen stove.

I picked it up and struck him over the head.

He fell to the ground. A pool of red blood poured out of his head. His eyes were open, but his stare was blank. The smell of iron filled the room. 

I murdered her child.

The pan had his blood on the back. I slowly dropped it on the floor.

The younger boy grabbed hold of his brother and tried to wake him back to life, but Hana rushed to my side, making sure I was okay.

He was screaming out his brother's name, shaking his lifeless body. 

Tears were pouring down his face as he hugged his brother's corpse. Whispering to him, calling to god to bring him back. I don’t think he was aware we were still in the kitchen.

His shirt was now soaked with blood. The cries turned into faint, quiet sobs.

I looked at Hana, but there were no tears. Only the usual look of love now mixed with concern.

I took her hand, and we ran. When we got to my house. I opened the door and sat down at my table, panting.

“Oh, how they hurt you, my love. Why would anyone want to harm such a sweet man like you?”

“Those evil men. I will never forgive either of them. Good thing you hurt that bastard. I’m proud of my strong and courageous man.”

I opened a bottle of brandy and sat down. With each drink, I started to realize what had happened. 

I have killed a man. My dream of Hana being mine has been fulfilled, but at what cost?

I didn’t feel bad for her husband dying, but I didn’t mean to bring death on her family by my own hand.

Hana didn’t talk much, while I continued to drink my problems away. 

I was glad she came to my rescue first, but her not being moved by her son's dying was unnatural.

She just sat there across from me, looking deep into my eyes with love, or at least what seemed like love.

She started humming a melody. One from my childhood that my mother used to sing before I went to bed. The drink slowly eased its way into my brain, and I started to relax. 

I could hear dogs barking from the village. They were louder today.

Somewhere in the distance, a mountain goat bleated.

I was almost falling asleep, but then I heard a strange noise.

I ignored it at first, but it kept getting louder. I thought I heard my name called out.

I looked out my window, and there was no one around, but every second the noise kept getting louder.

Now I was sure someone was calling for me. The ground thudded rhythmically.

I rushed to the window again and saw my entire village with fire torches coming to my house. I ran to the door and bolted it shut. Standing next to it, my legs shaking, trying to catch my breath.

I knew why they came.

A banging on the door echoed through the house.

“Come out, we will break the door down if we have to.” I didn’t answer.

“What’s going on, my love?” Hana whispered and came to my side.

The look of love was now gone from her eyes, and so was the blueness. They now glowed sulfurishy yellow. Her pupils deformed into square-like shapes.

She looked excited. Happy with her work.

I froze and stood next to the door in fear.

Then the second bang came. This time, I didn’t hesitate and quickly took off through the back door. My vision had blurred, I was breathing hard, trying to run as fast as I could.

I didn’t take Hana with me. Whatever she has become, it was not the woman I once loved.

For a second, I could hear thumping far in the distance, but as I ran into the forest, it slowly faded away.

The adrenaline stopped, and I realized how exhausted I was. I saw a cave going inside the mountain.

I fled into it, sat down, and wept.

“I want to take my wish back!” I yelled out.

The clattering of the hooves echoed through the cave. The darkness was pierced by two glowing yellow balls approaching closer.

A demonic voice spoke.

“Haven’t seen you in a while, my friend.”

“I told you everything comes with a price.” 

“I think you owe me something now.”
