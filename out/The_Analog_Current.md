I've been seeing the same number sequence everywhere for 17 days.

It started after I installed that research database extension for my thesis. Nothing special - just a Chrome plugin to help organize academic papers. The university librarian recommended that database.

That night, my database search history showed queries I never made: "Florensky computing theories" "analog current in computational systems" "Committee for Technological Integration"

I assumed it was malware at first. Ran three different scans that found nothing. The extension had good reviews and was officially recommended by our department. I noticed the coordinates in my files: 52°45'56.9"N 23°54'18.4"E

They were embedded in the metadata of PDFs I downloaded. Then they appeared in the margins of a scanned document. Also, in the references of a research paper I was reviewing. The same coordinates, pointing to somewhere in Białowieża Forest on the Poland-Belarus border.

I'm a computer science grad student researching Soviet computing history. Nothing exciting. Nothing that should have drawn attention.

I found an obscure reference to Pavel Florensky in the footnotes of a paper about early Soviet science. He's known as a theologian and philosopher, but this mentioned his work on "alternative computational theory." I requested some of his papers through interlibrary loan out of curiosity.

The journal was in Russian, but I could make out diagrams of strange computational systems that used light, water, even plant growth as processing mechanisms. Not digital - analog. Continuous rather than discrete. The mathematics was elegant, advanced for the 1930s when Florensky was writing.

The final entry, dated January 1937, was brief and unexpected for me: "The natural world is the primary computer."

I knew Florensky had been executed in Stalin's purges, but his computing work wasn't mentioned in any of my sources. I photocopied several pages and continued my research.

That night I had trouble sleeping. I kept thinking about those diagrams - they reminded me of something I'd seen in a modern paper on biocomputing. When I finally did sleep, I had vivid, detailed dreams about mathematical formulas and forest patterns.

When I woke, I found my photocopies in a specific pattern arranged on my desk. Must have done it before sleeping, though I didn't remember. I searched for Florensky's computing theories online and found a single result, a blog called "Innovation Hangar" with articles about forgotten technological approaches. The site seemed legit, with researched notes on waht they call alternative computing methods.

The articles had references to other researchers I'd never heard of - Sedlak, Kossak, someone named Malysheva. They discussed computational properties in organic materials and natural systems that mainstream science had apparently abandoned.

I noticed something odd in the text formatting, like inconsistent spacing that didn't seem random. When I extracted just those spaces and analyzed the pattern, they formed fragments that seemed to me like warnings:

"Some knowledge wasn't meant to be digital" or "Narrowed our thinking to ones and zeros."

I emailed the site admin asking about Florensky. No response yet.

Three days later, my laptop blue-screen crashed while I was transcribing the journal. When it rebooted, all my research files were corrupted. The file structure was intact but the content was garbled. Was smart to run recovery software and it found patterns in the corruption that were statistically not too probable, like too structured to be random data loss.

I printed my remaining photocopies to continue working. That's when I noticed something strange. Certain paragraphs appeared highlighted - highlighting I hadn't made. When I checked the original photocopies, the highlighting wasn't there.

I compared the printed version with the originals character by character. The highlighted sections all referenced something called "material algorithms" and "piezoelectric properties in organic compounds." I convinced myself it was a printer glitch or that I was seeing patterns where none existed.

I was wrong.

That night I had another detailed dream about mathematical formulas and forests. When I woke, I found I'd written coordinates in my research notebook: 52°45'56.9"N 23°54'18.4"E. Białowieża Forest in Poland. The last primeval forest in Europe.

I couldn't stop thinking about those coordinates. I searched them online and found an obscure Polish research paper about unusual growth patterns in the oldest trees there. The paper discussed "computational properties of natural systems," but the publisher retracted it three days after it was published.

The next morning, I got mail from a Proton address, something similar to:

"Stop your research, FLR work was classified for a reason. Committee's searching."

I tried tracing the email (good luck doing this with Proton). Headers were manipulated, bouncing through multiple anonymous relays. IP search led nowhere, of course. 

That afternoon, I noticed a black sedan parked outside my apartment. A couple of guys sat inside. They remained there for three hours, then left. I told myself it was unrelated - probably just campus security or something mundane.

My devices continued behaving strangely and slowly. Apps wouldn't open. My cursor would move between clicks as if programmatic AI-agent was installed. Browser would navigate without my input.

I started noticing things in everyday technology. Patterns in the static between radio stations. Brief glitches in digital displays that seemed to form recognizable symbols; information hiding in plain sight like in the spaces between digital signals.

I've been having more dreams about forests and math. I saw a blurry man arranging papers on the forest floor, complex diagrams like those in Florensky's journals.

"Afraid of what can't be controlled," he said without looking up. "Digital is discrete. Countable. Controllable. Analog is infinite. Free. Continuous"

He folded a sheet of paper and creased it deliberately.

"The medium becomes the message," he said. "Paper remembers the patterns imposed on it. Like trees remember in their rings. Like water remembers in its flow."

I woke to find my work table filled with folded papers I don't really remember making. Complex patterns. Mind maps. Outforms. Volvelles. I saw writing on a blank page. It wasn't there when I'd last checked, but it didn't appear as I watched. It was simply there, as if it had always been there and I'd somehow missed it:

"The digital giants build on controlling information flow. They can't control what they can't digitize. They can't digitize what they don't understand."

This post may as well be a warning. I believe there's a reason certain technological approaches were abandoned. Not because they failed, but because they couldn't be simplified, categorized and overlooked. Because they operated on principles beyond that binary logic that today's Internet is built upon.

I found mentions similar to that committee in some of declassified 1970s documents. It seems to be a joint effort by governments and early tech firms. Their goal was to standardize computing research using digital methods that would be easy to centralize. Researchers who "resisted" seemed to disappear from academic records and serious publications.

The black sedan is back outside. I've seen it three times this week.

I'm not going to Białowieża. Instead, I'm heading to the university's deep storage archives. The sub-basement level where they keep the pre-digital records. No cameras there and no networks. It's where I hope to see the old Soviet scientific journals that never got digitized.

Those coordinates weren't really pointing to a forest. When mapped to the library's decimal system, they correspond to a specific location in the stacks. A section that hasn't been accessed in decades according to the checkout records.

If you've read this far, be careful what you search for. Digital leaves traces. They're monitoring specific keywords and patterns.

If I don't post again, remember: the pattern matters more than the medium. Information exists beyond digital encoding. The oldest systems still operate, hidden in plain sight. I'll leave what I find in places where digital and analog systems intersect - the transition spaces where one system bleeds into another.

The analog current never stopped flowing. It seems that they just taught us not to see it.
