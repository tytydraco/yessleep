It was about 10 pm when the lights cut off. My grandma lit the candles and asked all of us to sit at a big wooden table in the dining room, then she closed all of the doors tightly. Me, my two sisters and mother sat on uncomfortable chairs next to each other, facing grandma. I always knew  there was something wrong with this old, slavic woman but I never tried to complain about it with my mother. Though I think she knowed it too. Grandma believed in every urban legend about our little town in the east of Poland. She loved to scare us with the weirdest monsters and about a week ago I found seriously unsettling sketches in the drawer in her bedroom. The drawings were showing something like.. mythological monsters, but drawn in the scariest way I have ever seen.

I had no idea what did she want to *show* us today, but everytime she wanted to tell us some urban legends, she made sure that it was dark, and that we all sat together in the dining room. The thing is, she also always made sure that all windows and doors were closed. This time she only closed the doors.

-For tonight, i prepared something special for us. - said grandma. -I know that none of you actually enjoys my stories, so this will be the last urban legend I will tell you. Is that alright?



Everyone nodded happily. That's right, grandma's stories were never really interesting, so no one never paid attention to what was she saying.

Grandma smiled back at us and started her story.

*So there is this terrible creature that lives in the lake behind our house. It has been there since i remember. It was the 60s when it decided to come out for the first time. I was washing the dishes in the kitchen when i saw it outside the window - about three meters tall, long, skinny arms and yellow skin. It knocked on the glass, exactly three times. I closed my eyes and just started praying, hoping for it to go away. And it worked.*

*The second time I saw it was twenty years later, it knocked on the window three times again. I remember I left it open, so it was able to come in. I cannot describe the horrible things it did to my mother. I only remember I saw her lying in the pudle of blood with her own guts pulled out.  The last thing that she told me before dying was that I needed to draw it and never look at it again, and never let anyone see the drawing.*

*I drew the creature from memory quickly after mother's death and hid it, but shortly after I decided to test something. I thought, what happens if someone sees the drawing? so i bought a cat and forced it to stare directly into the sketch. I was suprised when nothing happened in next few days, but after exactly one week, I heard a knock on the window. And another one. Three knocks on the window. After that I found the cat, lying in the dining room just like my mother.*

*I did this again a few times, with few more cats and dogs, just to make sure. And it worked everytime.*



I already knew what was going on. I remembered the time when i saw one of the awful drawings. Exactly a week ago. Grandma stopped saying anything, she was just sitting there, grinning at me. Tears covered my eyes when I heard exactly three knocks on the window behind my back. I closed my eyes and started praying, and when I opened my eyes again, everything was okay.



Except my whole family was sitting dead on their chairs, with guts pulled out of their bodies.

Even my grandma.
