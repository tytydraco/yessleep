My dear friends and loved ones and citizens of the world, I implore you to maintain your composure in this grave situation. I have encountered these abominable creatures on numerous occasions before, and I am well-versed in the tactics required to evade them. Please heed my instructions closely, and we may just emerge from this ordeal with our lives intact.

It matters not if you are walking, running, or sitting; you must not cease your movement. Even the slightest indication of your awareness could spell your doom. Allow me to paint a picture of these ghastly entities for you: they are towering bipeds, their forms adorned with razor-sharp teeth and an imposing build. Though their appearance may deceive you, they possess immense strength, capable of rending mountains with a flick of their hand. And their speed... let me tell you, I once had to push my car to the brink of destruction just to barely evade one of them.

But enough of my digressions. If you have heeded my warnings thus far, then you must not start running under any circumstances. The slightest change in your motion will alert them to your presence, and they will not hesitate to eviscerate you. You must instead walk home, no matter how long it takes. Keep moving until you reach the safety of your abode. But do not let your guard down, my friends. These creatures take great care to preserve their prey for their twisted feast.

Upon arriving at your home, you may think yourself safe. You are not. You must avoid any indication of your knowledge of their presence, even if they stare directly into your eyes. Do not grant them the satisfaction of your terror. Simply go about your business as if they were not there. Remember, I am following you. But alas, I must impart some grim news: one of these fiends has infiltrated your sanctum. I have only informed you of how to survive their attacks, not how to eliminate them.

If you happen to possess a firearm, a precise shot to the head may suffice to end its existence. If not, then you must take a different approach. Send a message to our family group chat with these words: "Good day, family! I invite you to join me on an excursion today. Who is interested in a drive? ðŸš—ðŸŒž" Then, call the authorities immediately. They may not be able to destroy these creatures, but they can certainly buy you the time you need to flee and never stop fleeing the consequences may be worse than death if you get caught, and trust mee no god can save you once you are caught, for once you are caught there will only be pain and suffering beyond compare and, I urge you, my dear companions, to remain vigilant. These creatures are not of our world, and they will stop at nothing to claim us as their prey. But if you follow my instructions closely, we may just make it out of this alive.
