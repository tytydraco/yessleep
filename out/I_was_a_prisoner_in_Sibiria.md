Camp 207, Siberia.

The cold was a living thing there. It bit through the skin and into the bone. Every breath burned like glass. We were told to dig foundations for new barracks, but the earth we struck was not earth at all. It was frozen history, layer upon layer of things the snow was supposed to hide.

At first, it was bones. Long bones, yellow with age, still wrapped in rusted chains. We tried to pretend they were animal, but animals do not wear shackles. Sometimes we found scraps of uniforms, buttons, boots with feet still inside. Someone whispered that this camp had been built over another one. The guards laughed. They said to keep digging.

By the second night, no one was laughing. The frost made our shovels ring like bells. Sparks jumped when the steel struck ice. The air was too still, too heavy, like the ground was holding its breath. Then we found a skull that still had hair frozen to it. I dropped my shovel and couldn't pick it up again for a long time.

On the third night, the wind died completely. You could hear your own heartbeat. We were still digging when something pale moved in the pit. A hand - stiff, white, with skin like ice reached up and caught the edge of my shovel. I pulled. It didn't let go. Another hand grabbed my ankle. The cold went through the fabric, through the skin, straight into the bone.

Someone screamed. Then we all did.

The ground began to whisper. Not the wind - not even sound. It was like the ice itself was speaking, voices seeping through the cracks, dozens of them, maybe hundreds. They knew our names. They spoke them softly, like old friends greeting each other after a long separation.

"Dig with us", they said.

I don't know how long it lasted. The guards fired their rifles into the pit, but the echoes sounded wrong like the shots were swallowed before they could reach the air. When morning came, the pit was filled again. Not with soil. With men. The same men who had been digging beside me. Their faces were calm, eyes open, staring at the grey sky. Their hands still clutched the shovels. They looked like they had just kept working through the night.

The guards said nothing. They told us to move the camp farther east, where the ground was softer. No one argued.

That was years ago. Decades, maybe. Time doesn't work the same way here. But every October, when the cold starts to return, I hear it again - the scrape of metal under the ice, slow and steady, like a heartbeat. If I listen closely, I can hear them calling. My name. Their voices are patient now. They've had plenty of time to wait.

I know that one day, when the frost is deep enough and the ground starts to crack again, I'll go back to the pit. I'll take a shovel. And this time, I won't stop.

"Dig with us", they'll say.

And I will.
