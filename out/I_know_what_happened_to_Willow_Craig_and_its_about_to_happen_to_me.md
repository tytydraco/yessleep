I worked for the FBI, and this is the investigation that cost me everything. I wish I could say that this case is classified. I wish I could say I could get in trouble for publicizing it. 

It would then mean that there was information about the case left, information that needed to be protected. Information that could protect people. On June 11th we received a call to investigate a missing person's case, a woman by the name of Willow Craig.

“She disappeared! She's… she's just gone I-I don't, I don't…” The husband, Michael Craig, stammered desperately on the phone. The 911 operator tried their best to call him down and tell them what happened, but Michael only repeated that Willow “disappeared”. 

Me and my partner Valerie were immediately dispatched to investigate. Talking with a confused and grieving family is difficult, one of the most difficult things you can do, as a detective or otherwise. 

Me and Valerie did our best to console Michael and his and Willow’s children Nathan and Sarah. We asked them rudimentary questions like when they saw her last, if they had any idea where she might have gone. 

This line of questioning seemed to agitate the family, and they clarified repeatedly that Willow wasn't “missing”, she disappeared. When Valerie asked them what they meant, they showed us something incredibly bizarre. 

Willow was no longer in any of the family photos, not removed from them like it was edited, rather it was as if there was never a person there to begin with. 

Pictures of the family grouped together now had a noticeable empty space, some with Michael awkwardly wrapping his arm around nothing. It got even stranger when they showed us family videos without her in them at all. 

Videos of the husband and children talking and laughing with nobody, them paying attention to an empty chair, an empty towel at the beach, a car being driven by itself. 

A particularly unnerving example was a video of the two kids when they were younger running through the sprinkler. The family claimed that Willow was the one holding the camera, and sure enough, you could see the shadows of everyone there except for the person recording. 

Just the shadow of the camera floating in midair. Me and Valerie watched Michael’s wedding video in utter perplexity as his father in law walked nobody down the aisle, read his vows to nobody and stood teary eyed and lovingly smiling across from nothing. 

He walked down the aisle, hand in hand with hollow air as everyone cheered. The most bizarre video by far was the videos Michael took of his wife in the hospital, about to have their first born. 

Michael and the nurses conversed with an empty hospital bed, a slimy red baby materialized in the nurses hands out of thin air, the newborn floated above the hospital bed being cradled by a non-existent mother. 

It didn't end there though, all of her personal belongings and documents remained, but they were devoid of any evidence they had ever belonged to someone. 

All of her clothes looked brand new, dresses and pants Michael said she's worn for years now seemed like they had never been worn at all, they even still had tags on them. 

They showed us her driver's license, birth certificate, credit card and any type of physical documents that might mention her. As you'd expect, it was all erased. They showed us her social media profile, and account with no username linked to an email that just read “            @email” 

They showed us more, and it all followed the same frightening theme. Willow Grace has disappeared. Entirely. Me and Valerie were at a loss for words, she gave me a frightened look that said, what do we do? 

We told the family the best thing we could do was start a search party, all we needed was a physical description of Willow and the place they last saw her.
“I last saw Willow-” Michael began. He froze. “I… I don't remember.”

“What about you kids? Do you know where you last saw mom?” Valerie asked Nathan and Sarah. Before the kids could open their mouths, Michael interrupted.

“I don't remember what she looks like!!” He shouted in fear.
“You're serious?” I asked. However strange all the evidence we'd been shown so far, a husband not remembering even a single detail of his wife's appearance was the most unbelievable.

“Her hair is… long?” Nathan said with uncertainty. “I remember I would brush it but… I don't remember what it looked like.”
“Whenever I try to remember what Mom looks like, it's like trying to think of a new color, my brain won't let me.” Sarah chimed in. 

I was dumbfounded, the three people closest to her in this woman's life can't even remember even so much as her hair color. I felt awful about it, but there wasn't much me nor Valerie could do. 

We assured the family we'd find her, and returned to the bureau with what we discovered. To make a long story short, the investigation went absolutely nowhere. 

All the extended family members, coworkers we questioned had a similarly difficult time describing her appearance. She supposedly worked at a pharmacy, her coworkers and boss remember her name, but couldn't for the life of them describe her personality or appearance. 

As we suspected, all camera footage of her place of work contained odd moments of customers being rang up and given medication by nobody. On July 9th, after only a few weeks since her disappearance, the bureau decided that it was a fruitless effort. 

We can do a lot of things, but we can't find someone who seemingly never existed. All we had was the word of the people who knew her, and a series of unsettling photos and videos. 

I felt bad about leaving that poor family with nothing, no leads or hope that Willow would be found, or if she could even be found. However, I would be lying if I said that the reason this case kept me up at night was purely because of sorrow. 

Curiosity gnawed at my bones like a colony of termites. What on earth happened to that woman? Did she ever even exist? I had to know. I couldn't use the Bureau's resources, and I didn't know where to even begin from where we left the investigation. 

I took a day off, and decided to go back to Craig's. I wanted to try to search for something, anything we might have missed. As I drove to the house, I mulled over everything about the case. 

Why had the people who knew her forget practically everything about her, yet still remembered her name and relationship to her? When interviewed about this, Sarah said something along the lines of “it's like a tugging at my heart, I just know”. 

I personally haven't met with the Craigs since the beginning of the investigation, and I strained to think of their pained expressions, their choked words, their… my heart sank into my stomach as I recalled the investigation. 

I realized that when I tried to place the Craigs appearances in my mind, I blanked. I remembered their names, their words, but not their expressions, their voices, or their appearance. 

I accelerated my car, going past the speed limit to reach Craig's house as soon as possible. The feeling of your memory of something fading is indescribable. I don't remember what the videos we watched looked like, but I remember writing them down, and the feeling they gave me. 

I pulled up to the house, it was late in the afternoon, and the lights of the house were all off. I hurriedly walked to the front door and rang the doorbell.
“Mr. Craig? Michael?” I shouted. 

Dead silence. I rang the doorbell again, and again. I didn't hear voices, nor footsteps, nothing. I was chilled to the bone, had they disappeared too? Maybe I could see if someone, or something took them. I kicked at the door, it didn't budge at all. 

I felt flustered for even thinking I had the gumption to kick it down. I went around to the window and smashed it in with a stone. It was a rather secluded suburban neighborhood in the afternoon, so nobody really noticed. 

I crawled through the window and into the kitchen, and noticed immediately that something was off. The smell of the house was clean, too clean. Every home has a certain smell to it, the people who live there imprint their very presence on the atmosphere, making the home feel lived in. 

This house felt hollow. Though there were objects around that implied people lived there, they were uncannily neat, like a movie set. I walked to the living room and turned on the light. 

My heart began racing as soon as I processed what I was seeing. The living room was full of odd framed photos, consisting of simple landscapes or empty rooms, not a person in them.

“Michael!” I shouted. The only response was my own echoed voice. I climbed the stairs and entered the master bedroom. The bed was made, the carpet was spotless, everything was perfect. 

I searched the closet, the neatly assorted clothes of Michael now perfectly matched the clothes of his wife, untouched, unworn. I went out into the living room and spotted the USB that contained the family videos. 

What unsettled me is that all the devices, tv remotes and cables were all neatly placed on the floor, still wrapped like they had never been used. I was already convinced that the same thing that happened to 

Willow happened to Michael, Nathan and Sarah, but I needed to see the videos again to make sure. After grabbing the USB I heard a loud thud. I was used to the dead silence, and jumped from the sudden noise. It came from downstairs. 

“Who's there?” I shouted. I immediately heard scampering. “Hey!” I yelled. I rushed down the stairs, the scampering noise immediately ceasing as soon as I was on the first floor. “Who's here? I heard you!” I hollered, scanning the dining room and kitchen. 

I widened my eyes when I looked down the hallway opposite of the kitchen. At the end of the hall, a door was opened that wasn't open when I entered. I cautiously approached the door, and was greeted with a dark and foreboding staircase down into the basement. 

I don't know what compelled me to venture down, maybe it was the knowledge that I would get charged with breaking and entering, maybe it was the guilt and curiosity that plagued me. 

I flipped the light switch at the top of the stairs, and the light didn't turn on, which was odd because it worked the last time I was here. I guess I would have to use my phone flashlight. 

The once dusty old basement was now cold and clinical, devoid of life. I scanned the basement, surveying the storage boxes no doubt full of untouched items. 

I turned around to look under the stairs when I spotted something hairy out of the corner of my eye. When my flashlight scanned up at the wall, my heart nearly rocketed out of my body. 

Clinging to the basement wall, was an enormous, hairy red tarantula. When I say enormous, I'm talking at least three meters long, taking up the entire wall. I stood in frozen silence for a few moments, then my shock slowly died down. 

The tarantula didn't move, so my rational brain assumed that it was just a prop or decoration for Halloween.
“Jesus Christ…” I said, breathing a heavy sigh of relief. Then it twitched, thump thump thump, the sound of its many legs adjusting its position on the wall caused vibrations through the whole room. 

My face went pale. There was no way, there is no way that thing is real. I frantically thought. Then it rushed across the wall, scampering impossibly fast. Thump thump thump. It climbed away from my light and into the darkness of the basement.

“FUCK!!” I screamed, fully processing that the tarantula was a real, living thing. I frantically ran up the basement steps, down the hall and bashed open the front door. I got in my car and started breathing heavily. 

I wanted to drive home, I wanted to drive far away and never go near that house again, but I hesitated. I sat in the car for a while, thinking about what had just happened. What on earth was that thing? Is it related to Willow’s disappearance? 

I opened my glovebox and eyed the revolver stashed within. I bit my lip and grabbed it, my curiosity overpowered my fear, and I stepped out of the car and walked back up to the house. 

To my shock, the front door was closed and locked again, even though I just came out. I walked around to the window I had broken, only to find that the glass was completely repaired.

“The fuck?” I whispered. I didn't care to question it too much, given the amount of crazy shit that's happened so far. I broke the window for a second time and crawled in. 

Sweat dripped down my neck when I approached the basement door, I froze in place when I heard the familiar thumping of the beast's movement down below. I took a deep breath, and slowly crept down the stairs, revolver in one hand and flashlight in the other. 
Thump thump thump. I jumped back in surprise when the giant tarantula crawled into view, now on the floor. I didn't want to fire my weapon if I didn't need to, I simply stared at the massive creature with a mixture of fear and astonishment. 

It was then that I heard the worst sound I could possibly hear. Thump thump thump. The crawling noise of the massive tarantula, only the one in front of me wasn't moving, the noise was coming from the hall behind me. 

I whipped around and was immediately met with a second, equally huge, equally terrifying tarantula speeding down the stairs after me. I'm not proud of the noise my vocal chords produced at that moment, I didn't think a scream that loud was even possible for me to make. 

I didn't even think to use my gun, I just stood there in pure terror. The tarantula ran into me headfirst, its large hairy body slamming into my chest, and knocking me down the stairs. 

I landed on my back. The wind was knocked out of me, and I dropped my phone, though I retained a strong grip onto my gun. I didn't have time to think before both of the massive tarantulas surrounded me. 

I felt their disgusting hairy legs scratch at my skin, yelped as they pummeled their many legs repeatedly into my stomach, head, legs and arms. I desperately tried crawling away, only to feel their massive, powerful legs press down on my back, pinning me to the ground. 

The feeling of these revolting creatures touching me with sharp hairs and beating me with their strong limbs was unbearable. I screamed in agony when I felt both of the tarantulas nuzzle my back before plunging their fangs deep into my flesh. 

I felt venom inject into my body, and I started to go numb almost immediately. Hot saliva dribbled out of my mouth, I felt like throwing up. I grit my teeth and focused, tightening my loosened grip on the gun. 

I haphazardly pointed it back and shot. I don't think I hit them, but it clearly surprised them as they finally left me alone and scampered away.
“God! Fuck!!” I screamed. The pain was unbearable, I could feel the venom coursing through my veins, I thought for sure I would die. 

I sat up and scanned the basement, the two tarantulas had scampered into a corner of the room. I aimed my gun and shot at both of them. They frantically crawled to the other side of the room as I shot, hairs flew off as a few shots made contact with their body. 

The bullets didn't seem to affect them, and I already ran out. I gathered my strength and stood up, I wobbled and nearly fell over, as I couldn't feel my legs. I need to get out of here now. I went to grab my phone, thank god it landed flashlight side up. 

I clumsily walked to the stairs and began to climb up, but as I climbed I saw the tarantulas doing something odd. In trying to escape me, they huddled to a corner of the room and began to move a heavy wardrobe up against the wall. 

My mouth fell open when I watched them push the wardrobe aside, revealing a massive hole in the wall. The two beasts crawled into the hole and even managed to pull the wardrobe back into place. I didn't have time to think about the oddly intelligent and dangerous monsters escaping, I needed to get to a hospital. 

Aching and weak, I dragged myself up the stairs and stumbled down the hall. When I reached the outside door I immediately collapsed in the front yard. I could barely keep my eyes open, the venom made my head spin and I eventually passed out. 

I woke up in the hospital, shocked that I was still alive. The pain and numbness still rang through my body, but not enough to keep me from moving. I was about to get up when a nurse entered the room.

“Oh! You're finally awake.” The nurse greeted me. She came over and picked up a clipboard. “So, you were found passed out in front of an abandoned house, you had a lot of bruises and four stab wounds-” The nurse began, I cut her off.

“Abandoned? No, no it belongs to Craig's.” I informed her.
“The Craigs…?” The nurse asked.
“You know, like Willow Craig? The missing woman.” I answered. The nurse didn't seem to know what I was talking about. 

“Ugh whatever, where's my phone?” I asked. The nurse pointed to the table next to me, and there was my phone, wallet, and clothes, neatly folded. I needed to call the bureau, I needed to tell them what I found, that the rest of the Craigs went missing. I rose out of bed, and the nurse stopped me.

“You need to lay down sir, you haven't recovered from your injuries, and we haven't fully identified your condition.” The nurse pleaded. I paused.
“What do you mean you haven't fully identified it?” I inquired. The nurse looked at my back wounds and soured her face.

“Well… we haven't seen anything like it.” She answered. I examined myself, I was covered in bruises from the brutal beating of the tarantulas, some sharp red hairs still stuck in my skin. I twisted around and looked at my back. Though they were bandaged up, I could tell the bite wounds were gruesome.

“Look, I need to call the bureau. Hand me my phone at least.” I requested. The nurse handed me my phone and I immediately felt something off. The phone felt brand new, and when I turned it on I nearly fainted. My phone wallpaper was a photo of me and my brother posing while on a hiking trip. 

I was no longer in the photo. I jumped out of bed in a panic. No no no no, this can't be happening. The nurse urged me to stop but I stormed past her, I grabbed my clothes and wallet and ran to the bathroom, locking the door behind me. I quickly dialed my partner Valerie, in a panic I couldn't think of who else to call.

“Mark?” She answered. I felt relieved that like Willow, at least my name remained in people's memory.
“Valerie! I'm vanishing like Willow Craig. I need you to type out everything I say, we need to reopen the Willow Craig case. The rest of the Craigs went missing and I-” I hurriedly spoke, before Valerie interrupted me.

“Woah slow down! What are you talking about? Who's 
Willow Craig? I don't think I was a part of that case.” She stated. My eyes widened.
“What do you mean? You were on the case with me.” I responded. Valerie went silent.

“Mark… I don't remember any case I've done with you, even though I know I have. I-” She stammered. “I can't even remember your face, what's going on?”
“Listen to me Valerie, you can only remember my name and general aspects about me. It's the same thing that happened to Willow Craig.” I reiterated.

“I told you already, I don't know any case about Willow Craig, I just searched our records and couldn't find anything.” Valerie notes.
“What? That doesn't make any sense, we-” I stopped. I realized at that moment what was happening. 

I dropped my phone and ran out of the bathroom, I barged past the nurses and sprinted down the halls. Ran from the hospital, and fell to my knees outside. Valerie didn't remember Willow Craig's name, her case file wasn't in our records anymore, she'd been completely erased. 

It didn't matter that they remembered my name, they'd eventually forget that too, and any record of it would be wiped away. I write this from a public restroom, not that it matters since this document will probably disappear as well. 

Those spiders, monsters, whatever they were, I feel their venom running through me. It stings, it scratches under my skin. I realized that the red hairs in my arms aren't stabbing into them, but growing out of them. 

I can feel my skin scraping against my bones and reshaping my body. My arms and legs are lengthening, my teeth and fingernails are falling out, I don't know how much time I have left. 

I don't how, and I don't know why, but I'm sure those tarantulas were Willow and Michael Craig. Their identity and any evidence of it was erased from existence, I can only assume that included their poor children. 

I'm even beginning to forget their names. I had to scroll up on my own writing to remind myself. Hell, I forgot my own name a while ago. I called myself Mark earlier, I don't know if that's my name, it just sounds right. 

Willow, Michael, Nathan, Sarah, I'm so sorry. I suspect there's more of them, more people who underwent this transformation and became lost to the world. I suspect there's many friends and loved ones out there who were wiped from the minds of everyone around them. 

Oh god. I can feel my insides shifting, my bones break and my blood gushing inside. It hurts so much. Four new limbs slowly began growing out of my torso. Writing this to you all is my final desperate action. 

Though it may be impossible, please remember me. I don't expect anyone to go down there, to try and find a way to put a stop to it, I don't know if you even can. I'm going to lose myself with so many unanswered questions, but I do know one thing. 

I know what happened to Willow Craig, and it's about to happen to me.
