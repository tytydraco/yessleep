Hey everyone, I've been thinking about some "folklore" (if you can call it that, urban legend may be a better term?) and all the memories surrounding it that I can recall from my childhood, and I'm curious if anyone else, especially in the pacific northwest has heard of any of this. I'm talking about the "Rotting Runners" phenomenon, (I don't know what you may refer to it as, that's just my name for it.) and of the two or three people in town who know about them, my dad was by far their biggest fan for some reason. He's the one trying to "spread the word" to neighbors, and probably the only reason those two/three people here know what I'm talking about. But only topically, not direct experience.

We lived in Looking Glass, Douglas County OR at the time. Nice and rural but not too lonely, neighbor's aren't too far. Every now and then we would hear loud bangs outside when we were either in the house or outside, and I always thought it was people shooting their guns, as that was something us and our neighbors did sometimes. But sometimes the bangs were much closer and would shake the house. But instead of my dad (single parent) being alarmed that someone is trying to murder us, he'd say something like "they're back kiddo, wanna say hi to em'?" before rushing outside with a paint scraper and the happiest smile I've ever seen him smile. He doesn't smile like that anymore. 

Usually I'd be too afraid and just stay inside while he went out and did whatever he did. Sometimes I went out with him. The first time I went with him after hearing one of these bangs, he was looking up at the sky smiling from ear to ear, looking around like a kid on a easter egg hunt. There were two more distant bangs in the distance that echoed strongly. after hearing this my dad turned to me and said "you hear that boy? We got more family than you think!"
I remember him turning and looking towards the sky and taking off his glasses a one point. He started laughing and grabbed me by the hand very strongly and said something like "you're going to grow up to be as fast as strong as they are you know that right? My baby boy, there they are!"

My eyes adjusted to the sunlight after walking under tree shade for a while, but when they did adjust, I could see what he wanted me to see. Way out in the distance there were two very small, almost unnoticeable dots moving quickly in the sky, falling downwards but with a noticeable curve. Slowly getting closer to the ground while their path straightened out. Once they were about a mile away I could make out more details but only barely for a short time. They went from a black dot to something more dark brownish. From a dot to something more... spindly? Lanky?
They disappeared quickly into the trees a few hills away with two very loud bangs. Dad tightened his grip as he began walking faster, barley giving me a chance to process anything that happened as he said "you believe in angels boy?" I said yes. "You ever seen an angel?"

After a while of walking towards where we saw these things, it started to smell. Bad. We live in the country and my dad owns animals, and I'd help him out as a kid so I was used to the smell of rot and shit and general gross stuff. But this was something else. It was like torture trying to hold my breath to avoid the smell only to have to take a huge breath after. Dad though, still had a huge smile on his face as he didn't even react. Eventually after being in my own world of trying to dissociate enough to ignore the smell, I was snapped out of it by dad loudly exclaiming "holy shit! My loves! My babies!" 
I was jolted enough to take another gross breath before finally seeing what he was so excited about.

Smashed against the trees were these patches of... something. I don't know if it was meat, or what. It was too hard to distinguish what I was even looking at. These patches of something incredibly foul hanging off the branches and bark, holding on by some kind of disgusting black fluid. On the surrounding ground there was more strewn-about remains of dark, foul fleshy looking material and in the branches were these snags of hair. Some of the hair was brown and some of it was black but there was a lot, and it was caked with more foul smelling fluid. 
"Daddy was is it?" I asked. I didn't think he'd heard me so I started to ask him again, but before I could he cut me off.

"I told you Alec they're angels. This is our family, our friends, and they're running to see us! It's nice to have someone who wants to be with you so much they'll run from high heaven just to say hi for a little bit." He almost cried.
 To little child-brained me, I just took this as it came. For some reason I felt myself getting excited, happy at the things he was saying. I looked up at him. 
"Can I say hi too if I go to heaven?"

He didn't bother to look at me to answer as he stared at the rotting pile of... something's against the damaged trees, and all over the ground. "There's no such thing as hell bubba."

As I was taking in what he said, he gave me a push on the back and said "go boy go! You gotta train for when you're big and strong!" 
I stumbled around for a bit with a confused smile on my face as I ran around playfully, arms flailing while I ran into trees and pretended to explode, making "pshhhhh" explosion sounds as I got up over and over again running and pretending to crash into trees. Dad loved it. He'd look at the rot, then back at me, back at the rot, and back at me. I could tell he was crying, but I could tell it was happy tears. He was loving it. "Go boy go! Go boy go!"
