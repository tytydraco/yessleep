I finally decided to come on here and share my 13 year horror story with you. I'm just going to break everything up into short stories and I'm only going to tell the scariest of the scariest since so many things happened almost daily. 

This house was a older house in a lower to middle class neighborhood. It had a long driveway and a separate brick garage in the back about 30 ft from the house. Between the house and garage there was a clothes line hanging up. It's believed to be on a native burial ground but I can't confirm nor deny that.

I've always been connected to the other side and sensitive to seeing, hearing and smelling spirits. 

( Stories aren't in a particular order ) 

One day I was about 5, my mom was standing outside grilling and I could see her from the window. It was an old window that you had to use a stick or something to hold most of the windows up, not this one though, this one had a lock on it. Anyways, I'm a short kid so I was holding onto the window seal to see out of it. The window was up. I wasn't jumping or kicking or any sudden movements and the window unlocked and slammed down on my fingers. Bruised my hands up but luckily nothing was broken. 

There was the basic foot steps, the TV would constantly and I mean constantly turn itself on and off, there was 3 knocks on the back door and no was was ever there, you could hear voices when no one was home & my dog was petrified of the garage. He would rather stand outside in the rain and snow than go into the garage. 

I would have the most vivid and disturbing dreams in this house. Stuff that I don't want to  talk about because I legit have to talk about them in therapy. Just to sum everything up I was ALWAYS in danger and always running from something. 

One night I was up hella late and it was pitch black in my room and I saw a fucking face creep up from behind the screen to around it. From what I remember it was pale and not too happy looking. I screamed because of how long I saw it and how slow it was moving towards me. Then it disappeared right front of my eyes. 

One night I saw what I would call demons in the back yard by my swing set and I saw all kinds of weapons that idk if they even exist in real life, no guns tho and I saw something chewing on the swing set. The next day I went outside there were tons of bite/scratch marks that wouldn't have gotten there otherwise bc of the location. At first my mom thought I was talking about actual men in the backyard and not ghosts so she got out her Glock and got into shooting position lol. 

Oh for whatever reason idk if I just had an over active imagination or what but I swear my stuffed animals with the plain black eyes used to move in my room. I'm not talking about moving from one spot to another when not looking, I'm talking about turning their heads and literally moving towards me. It was always at night in my dark room. It got so bad that I eventually didn't sleep with stuffed animals. 

One night not long after my GMA died, I was laying awake looking up at the ceiling and I was sleeping in my mom's queen bed with her. There was a small drawer dresser to the left of the room, the queen size bed in the middle of the room, a long floorboard heater on the right wall with a window and right in front of the bed there was a big mirror dresser with about 3 feet of space from the dresser to the corner of the wall. Idk what caught my attention but I looked into the corner and lost it at what I was seeing. I saw a pale woman sitting in the corner leaned against the wall with long black hair and a blank expression. I screamed so loud my mom jumped out the bed. 

One time my mom got home w some groceries and put them on the stove and it was turned off and everything caught on fire. 

My neighbor used to say she could see things walking the border of our property lines from her bedroom window. 

Throughout the years the earth would unearth what we are pretty positive were human bones. 
 
Let me tell possibly the scariest night of all, that was the night we tried to finally leave the house. 
So my mom and I were packing up a uhaul all day and at this point it was now 11pm-1am. We finished packing the truck and told the guys that helped us move that they could go ahead and go to the other house in the next city while we deal with the last few things we needed to pack in our car. My mom was very aware of the bad spirits there, so she told me to wait in her car. I watched from the front seat as my mom had a literal tug-of-war with the door. I watched it swing back and forth at least 3 times before my mom could shut the door completely. As she put her key in the lock the patio light above her head literally exploded and shattered above her head. Now we were in pitch dark. My mom ran to her car (that never had any issues at this point) and tried to start it but the battery was somehow dead! She had to run through my backyard to the neighbors house to get a jumper cable so we can leave. The feeling I had was horrible because it truly felt like whatever was on that land was trying their hardest to keep us there. Once my mom got the car jumped we officially left and never returned. 
That was 10 years ago now and from what I can tell the house has switched between owners at least 4 times now. 

I was genuinely terrified of that house growing up and I believe it contributed to the years of bad mental health after leaving. I have more stories from the other homes I've lived in if I ever feel like writing them out.
 That's all I feel like typing for now. Ty for your time.
