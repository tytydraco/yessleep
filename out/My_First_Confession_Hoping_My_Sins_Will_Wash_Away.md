Hey, I can hear your folks playing that large piano over there. Fine tune, I must say. It’s called an organ, right?

Oh right. Sorry. I should start with the traditional phrase.

Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

A terrible sin. 

I feel like everyone knows what I’ve done. I’ve seen people, walking down the street, just stop whatever they’re doing when I’m near, and just stare at me. Just freakin’ stare at me. Even people who I don’t know or who are not from around these parts just stop and stare at me.

And they won’t stop. It’s been a month and they won’t stop. I’ve even seen people follow me. Once, I saw a guy turn around the corner with his pickup while I was driving to the grocery store. I panicked after he followed me for maybe four blocks or so. After that, I turned and drove through an obscure part of town. That’s when he stopped following me.

It all started when my eight-year-old daughter, Danielle, told me she saw mommy with another man at the mall two months ago. I didn’t believe her at first because I knew my wife better than anyone else, especially since we’ve been together for 21 years. We loved each other very much and were devoted to each other.

However, on that very day, I did take my daughter to the mall because she needed new shoes for gym class. That’s when I saw my wife, Arlene, with another guy. I don’t recall her telling me about it except that she would be busy today.

I brushed it off at first because there was no way that she would cheat on me. But I had to be sure. So, I took my daughter to the mall’s indoor playground and told her to play around and not to leave until I got back.

She’s such a sweet little thing, my daughter.

Anyways, I followed them around. They had coffee with some pastries at the local bakery, visited the religious section at the bookstore, and even hung out at the small community garden just outside the mall.

After a few hours, I saw Arlene hug the man and they said their farewells. I followed the man and saw him stop by the small communal Christian shrine in the gardens. He kneeled down and started praying while holding those beads in his hands.

At that time, relief sort of washed over me, you know. I couldn’t believe that this guy would ever commit adultery, let alone with my wife.

Then I kept seeing this guy always hanging around near my house. Washing his car, mowing the lawn, wearing his robes before walking to the church. He’s always there!

I didn’t like that at all. And neither did Danielle. She said that this guy is always bothering her. That he always offers her lollipops and cookies. That he and his daughter always invite her into their house.

It’s funny, I never talked to my wife about it. I probably should have.

But something was wrong with that man. I know something is wrong. There has to be.

When Danielle told me that she saw him with mommy again, I snapped. In the middle of the night, I took my daughter’s advice. I grabbed my gas canister and my lighter, poured gas on his lawn in the shape of a pentagram, poured gasoline around his house, then set it ablaze.

That night, the whole neighborhood was burning bright. I could feel the heat all over my face. I ran away while hearing the horrifying sounds of screaming in the house. I regretted my decision right away. But not enough to confess my crime to anyone.

The next day, Father, that’s when everything started to go wrong for me. It began with seeing Arlene crying over the news of our new neighbors being burnt alive in their own home. The news anchor reported that a satanic cult called the Black Robed Tribe was responsible for this heinous crime, given their iconic signature: a pentagram burned into the ground.

Ignoring the news, I questioned my wife if she knew those people. Arlene claimed that they were her cousin, Marcus, and his daughter, Gabrielle. They had moved here from Italy, hoping to start a new life. Marcus wanted to continue his path as a bishop of the Catholic faith.

I replied to her, saying that I didn’t believe her. I told her that our daughter had seen her cheating on me with another man and that this same man was harassing our daughter.

The reaction from my wife baffles me to this day. She told me that we have no daughter. She insisted that she had only met him at the mall and had informed me about it. She even showed me text messages on my phone to confirm her story.

After that, she left the house in such wrath and in such tears. I was left in a confused state, you know.

I remember turning around to watch the TV and contemplate my actions when I saw my daughter—or not my daughter—Danielle, or rather her face pops up on TV. The news anchor claimed that she had been the leader of this cult for 47 years. Her face looked the same as my eight-year-old daughter. But what I remember most is that I thought I saw the face on the TV move her eyes towards me. And it started to form a smile.

I figured I must have been imagining things.

My wife has not returned to me since that day. I haven’t seen my daughter either. She must have taken her. I hope they're both doing okay. I tried reaching them by phone, but all I get is voicemail.

Ever since then, you remember that I mentioned to you about people just staring at me. Well, that’s when it started. Recently, these people have started pointing at me too. They seem to be mouthing something to me, not saying a damn word.

I keep hearing the flapping of large wings all around me during my rare visits to the grocery store. It’s louder than my radio put to the max. Once, I even saw this large pristine white feather fall from the sky onto the hood of my car. I looked up, seeing no bird in the sky. Not even a cloud or plane. Just nothing.

Today, it got worse. The flapping sounds got so loud, so intense. It’s deafening. But there’s nothing in the sky. The feathers become more frequent now. It’s like wherever I go, the road is paved with them. I brought one to you so you can see.

Give me a second, I will get it out of my pocket. Wait. No. It’s not there.

Anyways, these people who point at me, people whom I know or don’t know, now say something to me. I think they keep saying "judgement day" or something. I don’t know, Father, it’s really freaking me out.

Now they’re starting to follow me. I ran into your church, hoping to find sanctuary. But I feel that I will have to own up to my mistakes. I keep delaying it, but I can’t anymore.

Father, you have known me for a long time. Ever since I was a child. You also know that I am an agnostic person, even though I was brought up by a loving Christian family. So, it’s very rare for me to come to church.

I feel lost. Astray. Somehow I feel manipulated, deceived. I don’t know why. Maybe because I am so weak.

Father, what should I do?

Maybe I should run away. That’s it! That’s the answer, right?

Father?

I didn’t realize how long I’ve been talking. Your folks stopped playing the organ.

Father, are you okay? Why are you growling?

You know what Father, I uh, I better go.
