The octagon is silent. I know the crowd is crowing, but I can't hear the voices and noise over the blood rushing through my ears. He's on his back, and I dive on top of him. He squirms away, and on to his feet. I go in for the kill. A hand flashes out that I didn't expect. I drop. I can hear the jeers now....

Alarm clock rings. It's 11 am. I get up, but I'm not really sure why. Sleep seems appealing, but fuck it. There's gotta be something to do.  
  
I go to the gym. The sour smell of sweat-stained shirts and man-taint feels like a version of home. Eduardo is talking to me but I'm mostly ignoring the words. Just... hitting. The bag, the sparring partner, whatever is in front of me.  
  
Soaked in sweat. Waiting for a call about a new fight, but none were coming. The last one was enough to scare away potential suitors. Eduardo had stopped talking to me, for the most part. My career was drifting away...

Night falls. Booze and flirting. I try, and fail, to find company for the night. Apparently there's not much appeal to a losing fighter without any prospects of success or growth. Who'da thunk?  
  
Alarm rings. 9 am. I reek of vodka and sweat. It's hot as fuck in my apartment, and I'm almost sure it's because the power company has stopped my service. Ah well. The ring is calling, as it were.  
  
The gym is popping, filled with young men who are filled to the brim with piss and bile. Men like I once was. I start hitting the bag to warm up.  
  
A guy walks up to me. He's quiet (silent, even), and just hands me a card. This fucking weirdo. Probably some gay shit. But I take a look at the card. At this point, even gay shit could get my AC turned on....  
  
It says "Hit or Be Hit," and has an address. I pretend to myself like it's bullshit and there's no way I go to this fucking place. But I'm too tired to even fake it any longer, and I know I'll show up.

I wish it was something menacing and foreboding. That would at least make it cool. Instead, it's just a fucking door to a warehouse. The knob turns, and I step inside.  
  
This place is dimly lit. There are heavy bags, and speed bags, and a ring in the corner, brushed up against the wall. There are a few fighters hitting bags. The air is heavy and has a fucking taste that is similar to almonds and asshole. I hesitate, but a guy in a black robe with a COVID mask on makes a gesture towards the far wall. A blackboard has a list of gym rules. Rule number 1: "Hit or Be Hit." Rule number 2: "Don't fuck with the staff."  
  
Seems simple enough. So I walk up to a heavy bag to do a little warm-up, assuming that there would be more to this once I got going.  
  
The bag.... wasn't shaped right. It was lumpy. The "Everlast" logo was misspelled, and it looked cheap and poorly maintained.  
  
I hit it. Again. And again. And again. And then, it made a noise. I jumped out of my fucking skin, realizing that a sound came from the bag. I looked around, and then back at the bag. And saw that it was fucking bleeding onto the mat.

The fucking bag.... I don't know what to do. This isn't how gyms work. A staff member points to the bag and pantomimes punching.  
  
"What the fuck? What kind of shit are you fuckers in to?"  
  
He points to rule #1. I calm down, because what the fuck else am I supposed to do? I hit the bag again. And it fucking moans.  
  
"What the fuck is going on in this goddamn place?"  
  
The staff member speaks for the first time. "You can quit, if you want. But quitters get hit."  
  
"Fuck you."  
  
And then the staff converges on me. They grab me, and I don't react. I don't know how to react. The other fighters start to come towards me. And they start hitting.  
  
Three men. Experienced, by their method and their resignation. The tattoos and style, the blank looks on their faces. They beat the everliving shit out of me.  
  
Then the staff drops me. The first one points towards the ruleboard again. So, I hit the bag. And ignore the bruise. And the weeping. And the blood falling to the mat. Until the bell rings, and the staff points towards the door. And I leave.  
  
I know for goddamn sure I'm going back.

I wake up at 7am. I'm ready. The blood in my ears is silencing the sound from outside. I start with a run.  
  
It's 10 am. I'm soaked in sweat. I'm ready for the gym.

The door is more welcoming today. I enter without hesitation.  
  
The staff nods. I nod. The bag is there, and I go right in to my warmup. The heavy bag shifts. And moves. And leaks. And I ignore it.  
  
"Wham. Wham, wham." I hit and the bag leaks and makes sounds and I keep going. My hands get faster and faster. The damage done to the bag... if it was a person, it would be hamburger meat by now.  
  
Time for the speed bag.  
  
The bag is strange. Vertical. Looks the same as the heavy bags, but arranged a bit differently. The bag doesn't just moan. It screams. Muffled, but after the first strike it's unmistakable. It's a voice. And it snaps me out of the routine. I look at the bag. It's shifting and straining. This is a fucking person. I know it, and I start to panic. What kind of place is this? I feel stronger.... faster.... but this is too far. I stop hitting. I start to hyperventilate. The staff member, I think it's the same one from before, comes over and points to the rules.  
  
"Fuck you, this is sick."  
  
I try to pull the bag down. I'm desperate to prove that what I'm hearing isn't in my head. That it's a real person in there. I NEED to prove it. And shut this fucking place down. I pull at the chain that holds the speed bag in place. The staff start to congregate towards me. I don't remember crying, but afterwards my cheeks were wet and my eyes were bloodshot. What I DO remember, is getting the shit beat out of me. By the other fighters there. I remember the blank stares. And the way they ignored me as I begged and stuttered and bled and finally lost consciousness.  
  
I woke up in my bed. Bruised, but alive.

Today is the day I fix this shit. Or at least expose it. I go back to my normal gym.  
  
"Eddie, what the fuck do you know about the 'hit or be hit' gym?"  
  
He looks at me with suspicion. "What the fuck, vato. I thought you were better than that. Get the fuck outta here."  
  
Stunned, I stare at him. I've known him for years. My entire life, really. "Entrenador, I dunno what the fuck is going on. I need your help."  
  
"I can't help you anymore. Hermano, you gotta figure this out. But until then you gotta go."  
  
His eyes were watery. He said lo siento, and pushed me out the door.  
  
I cried. Until I realized I was at the door to the Gym. And I knew, I was going to fix this. So Eddie would let me back. And the bags would stop crying.

The door doesn’t feel welcoming anymore. It feels like a promise.  
  
I walk in. No hesitation.  
  
The staff nods. I don’t nod back.  
  
I walk past the bags, past the ring, past the chalkboard with the rules. I don’t look at them. I know what they say.  
  
I go to the locker room. I’ve stashed a knife there. One I taped to the underside of a bench. Just a little blade. But it’s sharp. Sharp is enough.  
  
I come back out. The first staffer — the one who pointed the first time — meets my eyes. I know what he’s thinking.  
  
I point at the bag. The speed bag. The one that screams.  
  
He nods.  
  
I go to it. I look around. The other fighters are training, pretending not to notice.  
  
I hit the bag once. It screams.  
  
I whisper, “I’m sorry.” Then I pull the knife and cut the straps.  
  
The bag drops like a body. The staff move in — fast.  
  
I slice at one of them. Not clean. Not deadly. Just enough to back him off. The bag is moving. Trying to breathe. I cut it open.  
  
A face. Eyes swollen shut. Mouth sewn, but still somehow screaming. It’s a man. It’s a child. It’s me. I don't know. I don’t care. I pull him free.  
  
The staff close in again. But something’s different now.  
  
One of the other fighters stops. Then another. They’re watching. One steps forward. Drops his gloves.  
  
The staff hesitate. For the first time, I see fear in their eyes.  
  
I scream, hoarse, blood in my throat: “THEY’RE PEOPLE. THEY’RE FUCKING PEOPLE.”  
  
And now there are four of us. Then six. Then the staff back off. No one speaks. The gym is silent. We carry the man out.  
  
The bell never rings.  
  
—  
  
It’s been two weeks. I haven’t found the gym again. The address on the card leads to a storage facility now.  
  
Eddie still won’t let me back in. But he nodded at me when I walked past yesterday. That’s something.  
  
I haven’t fought since. I don’t think I will.  
  
But I train. I write. I remember.  
  
The bags are still crying.  
  
But not in my hands.
