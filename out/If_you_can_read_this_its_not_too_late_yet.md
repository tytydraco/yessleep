  

if you are reading this then you need to follow my exact instruction to the T. it knows your there, it hasn't gotten through yet but it's trying.

it won't kill you but the fate you will suffer is unimaginably worse, so you need to follow the following rules to prevent further invasion. I’ve spent the last 20 years of my life preventing it from entering the mortal world, however, its evolving and learning. It knows it cannot get past me. So being the persistent bastard it is, its locked onto you as a new target. You know how you put something down and then when you looked where it was, damn... its not there anymore… “huh.. must of misplaced my wallet” you thought… or how you were sure you heard something at your window, or saw something dart away out of the corner of your eye. Nope. Its getting to you and your minds degrading faster than you realise… today its hearing footsteps a room away... tomorrow its thinking you’re a potted plant in the Kardashian house or a hummin bird in the Arctic. don’t have much time. 

OH and before I forget, don’t anger it, when it gets angry your sanity will be the thing to kill you… and that’s just no way to go.

In order not to succumb to it, Please find the list of instructions under this and execute them doing **exactly** as they say.

**!FINISH READING THE RULES BEFORE STARTING TO FOLLOW THEM!**

**1.** lock all doors and windows without making any noise. close your curtains. you must not be able to see the moon, stars or any of the outside tonight.

**2.** remove anything that is your favourite colour from your room. if you are not sure if something counts as the colour remove it anyway. you can't take this risk, it can hide in these items, and use them to link itself to you and that is the last thing you want. if the walls, floor, roof, or any furniture or appliances in your bedroom are this colour, remove them if possible, worst comes to worst move your bed to another room. if your bedframe is in this colour, buy a new one or just sleep on your mattress but it is vital you sleep in your usual home in a bedroom. that's where it knows you are at night.

**3.** go around your home. if any paintings seem gone or swapped places, any furniture seemed moved, whatever you do, do. not. put. it. back. it is making itself comfortable. you cannot aggravate it. if you have been noticing things being moved or something not where you left it and you moved it back in the past 6 hours, it's too late to stop it. refer to rule 0 after setting your affairs in order. you have until nightfall

**4.** get a candle without scent and a flashlight and put the torch under your pillow, and the candle behind your curtains. this has no purpose past throwing it off its game… it has a very peculiar aversion to small amounts of wax. get a sharp knife, no shorter than 8cm long and keep it with you at all times but never hold it in your dominant hand.

**5.** proceed with your day as if you have no idea it's there. go to bed as normal. if it finds out you know, it's over. if you start to hear what sounds like a low gurgling growl at any point during the day, it's got you, refer to rule 0 and follow it do this asap. you may say goodbye very briefly. you will hear harsh wind and screeching getting closer and louder if you have not done rule 0 in time… do not wait over 2 hours.

**6.** lay in bed as if sleeping but at no point allow your mind to drift. do not loose focus. do not fall asleep. if you fall asleep and are still self-aware once awake, no matter how briefly you fell asleep, it's to late, execute rule 0 immediately. it can't reach you unless you sleep, but you will enrage it if it knows you faked it. if you open your eyes if you so much as even go to get out of bed, it will know. if you hear the gurgling guttural growl again and screeching within your room after giving away your cover, you have under 10 seconds to act out rule 0. you enraged it.

**!RULE 0!**

take the knife you put in your room earlier today and slit you wrists neck and then stab yourself in the right eye in this **EXACT** order: right wrist short ways, right eye, neck, left wrist long ways.

when told to do this. you must. death is the best alternative now.

if the sun rises in the morning and you have not had to do rule 0, and still know who and what you are, congratulations and well done! it couldn't use you as a gateway anymore. it didn't cross over. you're now safe again. for now. I wish you luck as you are now like a beacon in its eyes, and it will **never** stop following you.
