People think life moves linearly. From one point to another. We move almost unconsciously, and feel that we are lucky to lazily sleep through life until one morning we don’t wake up. Until the day we fall from a ladder, until the day we are shot. The day where it all comes crashing to a halt and we are told to be thankful. Thankful for the time we were given to waste. The time we never truly understood the value of. I was able to grasp this from a young age, the universe has experienced an infinite amount of sunsets before we were here, and so it will when we are not. No one seemed to grasp that, not really. People like to say they do. They like to write books and go on podcasts and promote their way of life. ‘The grass is always greener’ was the way that I had taken to rationalizing it to myself. I had known since I was little that I didn’t feel the same way about things that everyone else did. Big things didn’t seem as big to me and the little things passed right in front of my eyes without so much as a second glance.  
  
“How has the new dosage been working for you?” my mind was cloudy, unable to pull the words apart from each other at first. “James?”  
  
“I’m sorry?” I said, still untangling her question.  
  
“How has the new dosage been working? Still spacing out?” Dr Fleming asked while scribbling onto her yellow legal pad.   
  
“So far so good, the dreams stopped a while ago so I think that’s progress.” I said, timidity in my voice. Fleming jotted more notes down on the pad before meeting my eyes and addressing me again.   
	  
“What about the visions? You mentioned to me before that you had been having…” her voice trailed off as she flipped back a few pages in her notes. “Lapses? Seeing things in the corners of your eyes that weren’t really there, the Olanzapine was meant to treat those as well.” She touched the tip of the pen to the page but waited for my response to move it.   
	  
“Nothing. They stopped almost immediately.” That wasn’t a complete lie, after a few days my daughter had stopped standing behind bushes or in check-out lines, but so did most things. I lost all attention to detail, I broke the promise I had made to never sleep through life again. To stop drifting in and out of true consciousness.   
	  
The rest of the meeting continued in that manner, call and response. I think she had noticed my eyes staring at the wall clock just above her shoulder but she never mentioned it. I started to think she wanted the meeting to be over just as fast as I did. It ended the same way all of the others had, the time would run out, we’d stand up, shake hands as she led me to the door always saying the same thing.   
  
  
“Life works out differently for everyone, progress is slow for everyone, especially given the circumstances. Just remember that blaming yourself doesn’t fix anything.” She said the exact same words in the exact same cadence at the end of every session, even over annunciating the word fix the same way every time. Muscle memory of the vocal cords is what I had chalked it up to. I knew that therapy would never truly work for me, for that, I would need to be fully honest and I didn’t feel like prison would suit my lifestyle.   
	  
Before stepping onto the crowded street, I pulled my hoodie over my hair to preserve its current state. I wasn’t sure why I always did this, I worked alone most days so there was no need to keep up a fresh appearance, yet I still found myself engaging with this pseudo-ritual every time the sky decided to open up. I turned at the intersection of Third Avenue and Lex. I stared at my shoes as I stepped through the standing water that had accumulated on the pavement. After the one turn it was a straight shot to work, I was thankful they didn’t force me to take leave or worse make me go to an out of the way therapist in another borough. Almost in the same way as the hood, every time I reached the sliding glass doors, I took a moment to read over the gold painted lettering across the front.   
  
  
***New York County Medical Examiner***  
  
	  
I walked past the empty front desk, cataloging how many times the new guy was late in his first month. Today made eleven if I was counting correctly. I punched in the code on the security tablet and pushed open the now unlocked double doors marked NY County Morgue. Most people didn’t last long in this room, something about being around too much death I think. Most people only intern here for credit hours but not me. I liked it. The dead don’t talk as much as everyone else. I had barely taken my hoodie off when the sound of the loading door buzzer went off. I checked the video feed still being displayed through monitors older than most of the people that come across the slab.  
	  
“Budget something or other” I mutter to myself as I unlock the door for the two EMT’s waiting with a covered stretcher. The doors at the back of the room opened gently as one of the EMT’s wheeled in the stretcher, dragging it behind him with considerable force.   
	  
“Brought a floater for you, been stuck in the Hudson for at least a week. The fish and bacteria did a number on the flesh before we got to him.” The EMT holding the door said. His tone is more nonchalant than most would have expected, but when confronted with death on a daily basis you either deal with it or you don’t. They hoisted the covered figure onto the cold metal table–permanently stained with equal parts disinfectant and dead tissue–with a loud squelching noise as they let him drop. I swear I saw one of them gag before putting the mask of bravado back on. The skin had turned gray, pocked with several shallow and deep craters in the skin, some large enough for me to put my head through. The face was stuck with the mouth in a permanent ‘O’ shape. The eyes, or where the eyes used to be are now black craters that allowed me to get a peek inside of the skull.   
	  
“His car was run off the Washington bridge, we had boats trolling for whatever had broken the barrier before we found him. The current took him several miles away from where we found the car.” one of the men said, not taking his eyes off of the cadaver. At that moment the radios on their chests hummed in sync. A string of numbers and locations that I did not have the training to understand. They gave each other the same grave look before jogging out of the loading bay doors. I pulled off my hoodie and sweatpants so I was now only wearing the sterile scrubs I should have come in wearing. I slid on a pair of blue nitrile gloves and picked up a fresh and sterilized scalpel, holding it up to the green-tinted fluorescent lighting to ensure sanitization. The process normally starts with an outer examination but with how long the body had been in the water, any signs of foul play were swept into the Atlantic. I pushed the blade into the chest to make the first incision. But, nothing. The razor sharp scalpel refused to puncture the skin. I pushed harder and harder, eventually standing on the tips of my toes but still the skin remained intact. The scalpel snapped at the handle, the blade flying back over my hand and slicing the glove open before I had time to react.   
	  
I dropped the now bladeless knife and ripped off the glove. Blood flowed steadily from the hairline slice. Dark viscous red dripped from my wrist onto the floor, creating a pseudo record of my frantic pacing as I tried to recall where the basic first aid was kept. I cursed at myself for not remembering one of life’s most basic necessities. You’d figure in a room full of medical equipment, band-aids wouldn’t be hard to find. I jogged back over to my desk and groped around the bottom drawer until my fingers wrapped around the red plastic handle. Pulling it into my lap, I bumped the bottom of the desk, sending my still filled bottle of Olanzapine crashing to the floor like an overpriced maraca. It’s amazing how fast fight or flight kicks in once you know what to do. I popped the latches of the kit and quickly found the peroxide. I didn’t feel a thing when I casually dumped half the bottle onto my trembling hand. The bandage went on just as quick, and within a few moments my hand was now tightly wrapped and disinfected. I leaned back against the wall and allowed myself to take a deep breath. Despite how well-cleaned the morgue is, touching the wrong thing with an open wound can give you a fast pass to the autopsy table. Necrosis is not a fun way to go.   
	  
My eyes shot open as I came to a realization. The skin never broke. At least I never saw it break. Skin can get tough when exposed to the elements, but not tough enough to break a scalpel. I stood up, ready to re-examine the body. Only now, the table was empty. My heart quickened, ready to check to make sure all of the locks were functioning properly, to check the security cameras to see who was just here. I hadn’t heard anything open, but I could have easily been paying attention to bandaging my hand. But who would want a body? My eyes darted around the room again, only now instead of looking for a first-aid kit, I was looking for a six-foot, two-hundred-fifty pound dead man. In less than a heartbeat, I found him. Standing on both legs staring at me from the corner with his hollow eye sockets and mouth agape. I fell back to the ground, clenching my eyes shut, wanting, wishing that this was another delusion. But, when I opened my eyes again, he was less than a foot from my face, allowing me to get a deeper look into his eye sockets. Almost like a black hole, they seemed to pull in all of the light into an endless chasm no one has ever explored.   
	  
“James…” his gravelly voice trailed off. I clenched my eyes shut again, not from wanting this to be real but from his putrid breath, it knows my name. I opened my eyes and began to slowly shift away, crawling backwards by my wrists. Eventually when I had enough room, I scrambled to my feet, never taking my eyes off of it. It cocked its head like a confused dog before stepping towards me.   
	  
“I don’t know what you are…” my voice was barely above a whisper. “But you have the wrong person!” I shouted.  
	  
“No…” his voice sounded like nails on a chalkboard, gravel in a blender. Saltwater damage to the larynx from all that time in the water. “Confess…” he finally said, pointing at me. My eyes found the bottle of Olanzapine on the floor. I lunged for it, rolling my ankle in the process. I heard a loud pop from it but I didn’t care. Ankles can be fixed. I popped the top of the bottle and poured two pills into my hand.   
	  
“That won’t get rid of me…” he said, finally more than one word allowed me to hear the slight twinge of a Boston accent in his voice.   
	  
“You’re not here!” I screamed. I took both pills and swallowed hard before closing my eyes again and counting backwards from three. A trick courtesy of Dr. Fleming. When I opened my eyes he was still there, staring at me from across the room. He slowly approached, hand extended.   
	  
“Confess…” he said again, now grabbing my hand. It felt as if it had been engulfed in flames, I pulled it back to me, snatched it back really. Skin had been eroded at once. In its place atop the red and bloody fatty layer of skin was a thick and translucent slime that coagulated at the tips of my fingers.   
	  
“What do you want me to do?” I shouted again, my voice breaking. “What does ‘confess’ mean?”   
	  
“Cassie…” his voice trailed off again. In one moment a lightbulb went off. My daughter. Why does he want me to talk about my daughter? It was an accident. If he knows her name he should know that; right?   
	  
“She was an accident!”  
	  
“No…” He grabbed my forearms and once again it burst into flames. Acid burned away the top layer of skin, leaving me unable to process anything other than the fire and brimstone that now replaced my arm. I mustered all the strength I could to rip my arm away, doing my best to block out the pain and focus on the situation at hand.   
	  
“What the hell are you?” I yelled at the top of my lungs, hoping against hope that either the new receptionist still wasn’t here or that this was all in my head. Please let this not be real. Let this all be some elaborate hallucination, let this be the guilt I never felt finally rearing its head. Let this be something other than real.   
	  
“you…know…what…I…am.” he forced his hand to my forehead and I felt my eyes roll back into my skull. I wasn’t in the morgue anymore. I wasn’t anywhere anymore. I was both motionless and being pulled by an invisible current. Everything around me was as black as a night sky washed out by street lights. Devoid of any life. At once a thousand explosions went off in my head. The inky darkness was replaced by blinding white lights. My ears filled with a deafening high pitched wail. I instinctively tried to cover my ears but I couldn’t move my arms, I couldn’t move anything. All of a sudden, it was gone. All of it replaced by the sound of a manufactured top ten hit. Replaced by tires scraping along a paved road. I opened the eyes I had tried to clench shut from the blinding light and found myself sitting in the driver’s seat of my old Mercury Montego. Our Mercury Montego. To my right sat Sarah, and Cassie poking up from the back seat, her arms perched on the center console. Both of them sing along to the radio. It didn’t take more than five seconds for me to register where I was, when I was. This was the night I decided I was done. The night after I discovered the reason behind Sarah’s lack of attention recently. Her constant texting, her sudden short temper. I was a fool, really. I should have seen it coming, I should have figured it out sooner. She was cheating on me. She had decided that I wasn’t enough.   
	  
“...till death do you part.” we had both said ‘I do.’ It turned out that only one of us had actually meant it. I watched helplessly as my arms yanked the steering wheel harshly to the right. The two-lane road we took our weekly drives on was dotted with large oak trees along the shoulders. Going even as low as fifty would still be a quick way to go for everyone in the car. Despite having no control over most motor functions, I felt everything. I felt my heart drop in one last second of remorse. I heard both of them scream, unable to comprehend what’s happening but knowing it isn’t going to end well. I felt the car crumple against the tree, shattering the windshield as Cassie was thrown through the glass and into the tree. Sarah died on impact, at least that’s what the coroner would tell me a few weeks down the line.   
	  
In less than a heartbeat, I was back in the morgue, staring up at the eyeless man as he pulled his hand away from my forehead. Only this time there was no burning sensation. There was nothing at all. I felt a pit form in my stomach before I emptied my stomach across the linoleum floor. Tears, real tears, formed for what felt like the first time. I collapsed onto the ground, unable to cope with what I had done. The last six months I had seen it as righteous. I had intended to go out with them but it looked like the universe had other plans.   
	  
The sound of a rolling maraca started from a few feet away but drew closer. I looked up to see the bottle of Olanzapine rolling to a stop in front of me. I looked up and the eyeless man was gone. No longer in front of me but also not on the operating table. Simply vanished into the aether. I popped the top off the Olanzapine and let myself fall into an endless void. I confessed, and this was my reward.
