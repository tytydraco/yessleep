I’m sending this out to the year 2023 in hopes someone can help me. But to understand, you need to know my story. It all started on that fateful day. An innocent red button was in my mailbox. I thought it was just another prank toy, or it was sent to the wrong address, so I threw it out. Fast forward to the next day. It appears again. Throw it out. Again. This time, I keep it. At this point, it’s night. I decide to go to bed and deal with it in the morning.

It was gone.

The button had disappeared overnight. I was vastly confused for a while. Then I got scared that somebody broke in. But no, everything but the button was untouched. I put it out of my minis and didn’t think about it for a few months.

Fast forward 3 months.

The button is back. This time, I can’t resist pressing it. After all, it was just a toy. It couldn’t do anything to me, right?

I pressed it.

I woke up in some unknown place filled with clouds that seemed to constantly change shape and color constantly. I noticed that whatever I thought seemed to happen. If I thought about something, it would appear. I think I first thought it was just a dream. So, I laid on my back and looked up. It was a starry night, just like I used to see out camping with my family. A sight ruined by the city lights.

It took me about 8 hours to realize that a dream would have ended by now. I pinched myself and felt  it completely. I still wasn’t convinced this was real, but I started exploring anyways. I saw a door. The same door to my childhood home.

I opened it.

I saw the universe. Everything all in one place and at one time. It was overwhelming. 

I woke up again, this time on normal ground. Except it wasn’t normal. There was no technology in sight. It seemed like I went back in time. But that’s not possible, right? I told myself I was dreaming again. How very wrong I was.

I asked a local what the year was. They responded (rather rudely) that it was 1704. 

How was this possible? Surely I was dreaming, but it felt real.

I closed my eyes. They stayed closed. The noises of the village around me started to slowly fade away. After 15 minutes, I opened my eyes.

I was in space.

I was still able to breathe and control myself somehow. I think this, at the craziest of times, was the moment I realized I wasn’t dreaming. I looked down.

Earth.

Every action I had made, every thought I’ve ever had all seemed insignificant compared to the giant planet in front of me.

But something was different. 

It seemed too small, felt like I could reach out and grab it. And so I did. And I *felt* the presence. I felt the people. I felt everything. From the richest to the poorest to the politicians to the cashiers. Then I closed my eyes.

15 more minutes, I’m back on earth. I close my eyes. Search through my mind for the information that I know is there. The date.

Today is October 18th, 2024.

The city I’m in is modern, but not too modern. I find an old newspaper. I didn’t even realize they still made paper newspapers. I looked at the headline.

BREAKING NEWS: ALL ELECTRONICS IN THE WORLD HAVE FRIED DUE TO EARTHS ORBIT BEING SHIFTED DUE TO SUPERNATURAL FORCES

Then it hit me. I touched the earth. I moved it. I may not have been intending to move it, but I did. And now society is reset because of me.

I had to fix this. 

Searching through my head I go. Closing my eyes. Searching for the exit. It takes less time now. It only takes 5 minutes. 

I see myself, about to touch the earth. And I can’t stop myself. I just doomed the earth. Oh god no. I close my eyes. I’m back in the cloud place. If I can’t stop myself from moving it, I’ll reverse the earth to before it happened.

Minute by minute, I start building a control room. It doesn’t take that much effort. I just think what I want and it appears. After 6 hours, it’s ready. I reset the earth to before I touched it. All is well.

At this point, I’ve realized I can control the world. So, I start having a bit of fun.

Some exploration of space here and there, some impersonating of politicians, and some alternate universes where I can do anything I want without messing up my world.

One year goes by.

Two years. 

5 years.

10 years. 

I’m tired of this now. I rarely go onto earth anymore. Most of my time is spent lying down, just thinking. So I decide to do just that.

One month goes by, I don’t even notice.

6 months.

5 years.

100 years.

Only after 100 years have passed I’ve realized that I’ve been lying down and thinking for 100 years straight. Time flies, I guess. 

More exploring of earth.

500 years.

More thinking.

1500 years.

Exploring space.

5250 years.

At this point, I’m bored out of my mind, there’s nothing to do, and being the ruler of everything is being boring. I’ve started a religion, the worlds largest religion. The one thing I can’t seem to do is get more people.

89,072 years.

I’ve tried everything to not be bored.

518,412 years.

Finally, as a last resort, I try suicide.

But it doesn’t work. Of course it doesn’t work. Nothing that I actually need will ever work. Of course not. 

 7 million years.

So, here we are now. I’m sending this to 4 different time periods. 2023, 2761, 2321 and UE809, or as you would call it, 98251983.

Someone help, or it might be the end of us all.
