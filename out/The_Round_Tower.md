As the tour guide led us through central Copenhagen, my mind wasn’t on the history she shared or the gorgeous architecture and pastel colors of the surrounding cityscape. Rather, my thoughts rested with my jittery hands on the circular wooden ring box in my jacket pocket.

I’d been tempted to custom order it with *Liam & Otto* engraved on its walnut exterior. But, if Otto saw it, he’d know exactly what it was, and I couldn't risk ruining the surprise.

Otto had grown up in Copenhagen, and we’d met while he was studying abroad in Chicago. We’d hit things off right away. Before long, we’d moved in together, and Otto was in the process of obtaining dual citizenship.

This was only my second excursion back to his home country, following a quick trip to meet his family. This time, we’d reserved nearly a week to see an array of attractions. Most were familiar to Otto, but he enjoyed revisiting them with me and agreed to an English-language tour that went through several prominent locations.

I couldn’t wait for the guide, a woman named Clara, to bring us to the final destination: the famous Round Tower, or *Rundetaarn*. Otto had named it long ago when I’d asked him for his favorite place to visit in his hometown. Once we reached the Round Tower’s observation platform, I’d kneel and open the box, revealing the rose gold ring held securely within its inner velvet cushion. It was a family heirloom, and a valuable one at that, and I was about to put it to good use. 

Naturally, I was nervous – too nervous to grasp more than bits and pieces of what Clara was saying: something about zany local legend concerning a creature whose name translated literally to “saggy-long-breast,” and rumored sightings of an ominous entity called a “helhest.” Rather, all I could think of was, *what if Otto says no*?

Of course, I knew that was unlikely. We loved each other, and we’d discussed getting married before, at least as a hypothetical. But we’d never firmly made the commitment. What if it was too soon, and my surprise proposal left Otto with cold feet?

*It’s too late to turn back now,* I reminded myself. I had everything I needed – a perfect ring, a perfect location, and, most importantly, certainty in the love we had for each other. Now wasn't the time for hesitancy. No, I'd see this through to the end, no matter what.

If only the tour was a little less morose. As if Clara’s monologues about weird fairy creatures hadn’t already done enough to rob the atmosphere of the romantic mood I’d hoped for, she now described how dozens of human remains from centuries past had recently been excavated underneath a commonly-used bus stop in the city center and at a nearby construction site. In recent years, Copenhagen had become somewhat of a “cemetery city,” as Clara put it.

Finally, the red and yellow brick structure of the Round Tower came into view. Clara led me, Otto, and the other eight members of our group inside, where we promptly found ourselves at the [bottom of its famous spiral ramp](https://www.rundetaarn.dk/en/virtual-tour/).

As Clara explained, the spiral ramp wrapped around the building’s hollow core 7.5 times, and was built – at the direction of King Christian IV in the 1600s – wide enough to permit a horse and carriage to haul books and astronomy equipment to the top.

I gripped Otto’s hand as we began the ascent. *Just a little longer, and this man will be my fiancé*, I told myself.

We soon passed the entrance to a gallery space and gift shop, which had once housed a university library. Clara, in her apparent dedication to expounding on the topics *least* appropriate for the occasion, took the opportunity to point to a small door a little further up the tower.

“Here,” she said, “you will find the first of two privies used by the astronomers who once worked here. The other one is at the top, just below the observation deck. The shafts underneath each privy connect and drop waste into a holding tank underneath the building. This tank lacks any outdoor ventilation and, thus, would expel quite a stench into the tower. In 1921, the holding tank was finally emptied, having taken many decades to fill up.” 

We continued up the ramp. The rotating path was not particularly steep, but it was long and repetitive, and I soon felt a mild burning sensation in my knees.

Fortunately, we soon made it to the small staircase that led to the rooftop observation platform. My heart fluttered with the knowledge that I had mere moments to wait before asking Otto the most important question of my life.

Noticing that Otto looked sweaty, I asked him how he was doing, and if he needed to take a break before proceeding further. “No, no, I’m fine,” he responded. “Let’s just keep going. We’re so close to the top now, and the view up there is breathtaking.”

As I began to follow him up the final set of stairs, I reached into my jacket to grip the ring box once more. As I did so, a boisterous group of sightseers appeared ahead of me. They were descending and, judging by the clumsy way they staggered downwards, were to some degree inebriated.

“*Undskyld*,” mumbled a burly man as he lost his footing and slammed into me. Grabbing a handrail, I barely managed to keep from falling. However, the force of the impact sent the ring box flying out of my pocket. I watched, helplessly, as its round structure rolled down the surface of the spiral ramp. 

“Excuse me,” I muttered to the tourists behind me as I flew past them in maddening pursuit. By this point, the ring box had accelerated out of sight, having sped off in the ramp’s counter clockwise direction.

I sprinted as fast as I could, nearly losing my balance in the process. As I ran, my surroundings whirled by in a blur, blending together into one continuous image of endless white walls and smooth brick surface.

I spotted the box, only for it to quickly tumble once again out of sight. *I’ll get to it soon,* I thought. I had to be near the bottom by this point, after all. 

Nonetheless, the ramp kept going. Leaning a hand against the inner wall, I stopped to catch my breath. I’d circled the building at least 10 times by this point. How was that even possible?

It dawned on me that a few things had changed about the tower. There was a green, hazy quality to the light emanating from outside that hadn’t been there before and, most perplexingly of all, there didn’t seem to be any other visitors.

“Hello?” I called out. My voice echoed through the corridor, but I heard no response. Where had everyone gone?

I peered out a window, hoping to confirm that I was close to the ground. But, instead, all I could see was a thick, opaque fog of the same murky green light.

I started to panic. I felt like I was trapped. What if there was no way out?

With the Flip phone I’d brought along for the trip displaying no signal, I saw no other option but to continue to descend. This time, I counted each rotation of the tower as I did so.

*Thirty-one…thirty two…* I eventually found myself whispering after seemingly passing through the exact same setting for over an hour. By this point, I was thirsty, sweaty, and exhausted. I collapsed against the inner wall and tried to think.

*What the hell was happening, and how do I get out of here?* My panicked mind considered several ideas – staying in place and hoping someone found me; going back up, though that would entail backtracking at least the same distance I’d already descended; or, if it came to it, even tying my clothes into a rope and trying my luck climbing out of one of the windows.

Before I could decide what to do, I felt the ground tremor. The rumbling increased in intensity as something heavy approached from above.

A deep, animalistic snarl rang out, followed by several snorts. The shadow of a large creature appeared and, moments later, its dark form entered my sight. At first glance, it looked like a horse – a very large one at that, such that it needed to lower its head to fit under the ceiling.

But, strangely, it only had three legs: one in the front, and two in the back. Missing, too, was an out layer of skin. Instead, it burst forward with its bones fully exposed.

One look at its diabolical stare and razor sharp teeth convinced me that it did not mean well. The high-pitched scream it rang out – one that sounded more like a child in agony than a horse – sent a sense of panic down my spine.

All at once, white, bony forms began to protrude from the white walls around it. Bones – those of human arms, legs, and, most commonly, skulls – began to spill out. Upon hitting the brick floor, they bounced and rolled downwards, towards me.

I’d seen enough. My flight instincts sent me hurrying away. I didn’t look back, even as I could hear a cacophony of noise, including the heavy thuds of the creature’s gallops, rapidly closing in on me.

The bones reached me first. My foot landed on one, sending my off balance. Before everything turned to black, I remember a sense of weightlessness as I barreled downwards, into the air, and a feeling of intense pain as I tumbled against the hard surface below.

When I came to, the first thing I noticed in my fuzzy vision was the wide smile spread across her round face. With bright blue eyes, she examined me curiously.

“H-hello?” I asked. As my sight slowly readjusted, I examined my surroundings. I was still in the Round Tower. Thankfully, the demonic horse no longer appeared to be pursuing me, and I seemed to have finally reached the bottom.

Only, the entrance door had been replaced by an open gap in the wall. Through the gap, I saw that the outside consisted not of a bustling city street but, rather, a pastoral landscape of lush trees and tall grass on a hill that overlooked a murky green river.

When I turned back to the woman, I realized that she had no ordinary appearance. Her pointy ears extended into the air behind her head, and a stream of thick, yellow liquid slowly poured from her nostrils down her chin and onto the floor. Warts covered her tattered face, and the few teeth that remained in her mouth were chipped and discolored. It took me a moment to realize that she was completely naked, as her gigantic, voluptuous breasts, which dangled mere inches above the ground even as she stood upright, concealed much of the front of her body. 

*What the fuck*, I thought, utterly dumbstruck.

She let out a strange, frog-like croak as she leaned over me and lowered her head close to mine. I felt her hot breath, and the moisture from the pool of her snot that dripped from her onto my shirt. As she puckered he lips as if to kiss me, her crinkly, discolored breasts rubbed against my shirt, leaving behind a thick trail of a sludgy, dark liquid.

“No, no, no, no, no,” I yelled as I scrambled away from her. She remained still, her expression a mixture of puzzlement and betrayal. “Sorry, um, lady, I, uh…where am I?”

She seemed to think for a second, then approached me slowly, her massive, wrinkled gazongas wobbling with each step. She spoke Danish in a growly voice. From the rudimentary lessons Otto had given me, I managed to grasp the first two words - *jeg vil*, meaning “I want” – but couldn’t follow the rest.

“Mam, um, I don’t speak Danish, sorry. I’m just looking for a way out of here, and for…”

She loudly cleared her throat, which seemingly prompted her to sneeze the gooey contents of her nose all over me, and spoke again. “I want…you…to sleep…with *me*,” she croaked. “Do this, and you may…drink.” She cackled as she lifted and displayed one of her breasts.

*Oh god, no.* “Um, l-look, ma’am,” I stuttered, confounded by the whole situation, “No, I, um, I don’t want that.”

She frowned. “Don’t…want?”

“No, I don’t. Please, I just need to find my ring, and to get the hell out of here.”

“Ring…ring? Like…this ring?” She removed the wooden box from underneath her left breast. Scuff and scratch marks littered its exterior, and the lid had been ripped apart – as if torn up by someone unaware of how to open it. But, inside, I could see the one thing I needed: the ring itself.

“Yes, that’s mine. Please give it back.”

She waved a finger at me. “I find ring. I keep ring.”

“No. It’s mine.”

“Sleep with me. Then, I give you ring.”

“***NO.***”

This visibly upset her. *I’m not making any progress,* I thought. Sure, she *did* repulse me for a multitude of reasons, but I wasn’t gaining anything by letting her understand that. I tried another approach.
	
“Look, lady, I can tell that you’re a lovely, beautiful woman, and if there’s anything I can do for you *other than sleeping with you*, I’ll happily do it for you. *Later*. Right now, I just need the ring. For God’s sake, I’m about to propose with it.”

Her face grew red. “You…you love…*another*?”

“Lady, I just *met* you, and I’m not even-”

Her wailing cut me off. “If you want ring…then take ring!” I watched, my jaw dropped, as she threw each of her gargantuan breasts over her shoulder and sprinted *upwards*, back the in towards the top of the tower.

“For fuck’s sake!” I exclaimed, realizing that I once again needed to traverse the spiral ramp.

Even as many questions remained unanswered – like where I was, how I got there, and how to get back to Otto – I knew exactly what I had to do next. Even as pain resonated through my exhausted muscles, I mustered the strength to run after her and get my ring back.

As I chased her, the light steadily lost its greenish tint, and I started to feel like I was returning to a reality I’d once left. Best of all, around the seventh rotation, I spotted an end-point: the staircase to the observation platform where this all began.

She was fast, but I was faster, and I’d nearly caught up to her when she turned to face me. Just before I collided into her, she muttered an indecipherable phrase and blew some kind of grainy, blueish powder onto me.

At first, I felt like everything around me had grown larger. The lady somehow became a little taller than me, then much taller; simultaneously, the distance between us stretched out farther. That’s when I realized what was happening: I was rapidly *shrinking* in size.

The lady, meanwhile, kicked open a small door by the staircase. “Oh no you fucking don’t!” I shouted as she held the engagement ring over the seat to the upper privy.

“You want?” she screeched. “You take!” She let go.

I’d come this far. The ring meant *everything* to me. I wasn’t going to give up now. So, I leapt for it.

As I flew past the grotesque form of my laughing tormenter, my mind processed the nature of the prank she’d pulled on me. A grown man had little to fear about diving head-first into a primitive toilet. He couldn’t fit into it, after all. One shrunk to my current size, however…

When several tourists found me later that afternoon, I wasn’t a pretty sight. The lower half of my body was somehow stuck in the waste shaft under the lower privy, halfway up the tower. I was covered in blisters, bruises, and remnants of centuries worth of shit.

Two police officers managed to pull me out. As I waited for a medic, they questioned me about what had happened and mentioned the possibility of a minor vandalism citation.

For a moment, I considered recounting what had really occurred, from the three-legged horse, to the embittered elfen woman, to my slide down the filthy, antiquated pipes of the tower’s waste disposal system. How the ring had slipped from my grasp and fallen down to the enclosed holding tank far below, and how I’d barely managed to climb back up through the shaft that led to the lower privy. But, instead, I just asked for Otto.

The officers relented. They stepped out and let Otto in. A wave of relief spread through me when I saw him. To my surprise, he hugged and kissed me without hesitation.

“But Otto, I look like shit, and I’m literally covered in it.”

“I don’t care,” said Otto, who continued to embrace me. He had tears in his eyes. “To me, you’re as beautiful as ever. When you disappeared, I assumed the worse, and I’m so glad that you’re okay.”

“I’m so sorry Otto.”

“Don’t be, babe. I love you.”

“It’s not just…I lost something important, something I was going to give to you. I tried as hard as I could to retrieve it, but I failed.”

“It’s okay,” he replied. “Whatever it is, what matters most is that we’re together again.”

It was now my turn to tear up. “You must have so many questions about where I was, and what happened to me.”

“I do, but they can wait now that I know that you’re safe. Liam, there’s something important I was going to ask you when we reached the rooftop. Can I ask you now, or would you rather me wait until you’ve had a chance to clean up?”

*No way, surely this can’t be what I think it is,* I thought to myself, as a smile spread across my face. “Sure, babe. You can ask me now.”

Otto got to his knee and opened a square-shaped blue velvet box. He held out the ornate diamond ring inside of it and asked, “Liam, will you [marry me](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeaceSim/)?”
