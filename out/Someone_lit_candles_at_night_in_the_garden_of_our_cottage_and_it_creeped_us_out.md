First of all: What I'm writing will sound crazy, but please believe me: It happened exactly like this and I am still in the middle of it. Or actually: We are. We, that is my husband Chris (31) and me, Elise (29). After a stressful last year (we both started new jobs and moved into our first home together), we decided a few weeks ago to accept the forever pending invitation from Chris' relatives in Denmark (his mother is half Danish) and spend two and a half weeks in a little vacation home on a fjord.

I don't know how familiar you are with the landscape here, I know I wasn't. To make it short: It's ridiculously idyllic, like something out of a Scandinavia travel brochure. Our cabin is part of a cottage area, as there are many here (the Danes love to spend the summer in their cozy wooden houses by the water); a small wooded area with about ten a little shabby but charming cabins spread out over it. Each of them has a small overgrown garden with a hut for firewood, faded garden furniture or an old swing of children who have long grown up. The gravel paths between the cottages here are named after native bird species: Skylark Path, Crane Path, Bittern Path. A narrow trail leads to the fjord, a large lake with a small pebble beach. Heather grows on the shores and dunes an old lighthouse looms within the distant dunes.

Our first few days here were spent getting comfortable and exploring the area. The nearest town is about four miles away, a small village with a supermarket, bakery and not much else. 

We bought local food and had dinner on the small terrace surrounding the cottage, we walked for hours along the fjord and collected shells and stones we thought might be amber. In the evening, we fell into bed dead tired and happy.

That is, until the day before yesterday. In the middle of the night, at maybe about three or four, I woke up because I had to pee. The bathroom is right next to the bedroom, and there was no need to turn on any lights in the hallway because there was a bit of moonlight coming into the house through retrofitted skylights. When I finished and stepped back into the hallway, I saw a light outside in the corner of my eye and reflexively turned my head. You see, we're alone in the cottage area right now, except for an older Danish couple a few cottages over, so I was a little startled. I thought maybe I could see the lighted window of a neighboring building where someone had arrived without us noticing. But when I stepped closer to the window, I saw that there was a candle burning in our garden. It stood on top of a man-sized tree stump, the flame flickering in the wind coming constantly from the fjord. 

For some reason, I suddenly felt ice cold. I took a step back and scanned the garden, but there was no one to see or hear. I went back into the bedroom and woke Chris. I said, "There's a candle burning in the backyard and it's kinda creeping me out." I realized I sounded scared and laughed a little. It was weird but nothing that warranted fear, right? Chris was sleepy and a little annoyed and shuffled over to the window. "Hmm, that's weird," he said bluntly. "And stupid - who would light a candle in the woods in the middle of summer?" He put on his sandals, went into the garden and blew out the candle. "Okay, back to bed," he mumbled while trotting back inside. And that could have been that.

Unfortunately, it wasn't. The next morning, we slept late; only around ten did I go into the kitchen to make coffee. While I was standing at the counter, my eyes fell into the garden and onto the tree stump. The candle was gone. I left the can of coffee powder and went outside, thinking maybe the wind blew the candle over and it fell. But it wasn't lying in the dry grass nearby either.

At the breakfast table, Chris and I were mock wondering if we'd had too much Danish beer the night before, if we'd imagined it all. It was another sunny summer day and the cold I had felt during the night felt far away. We spent the day on the beach as usual.

In the evening, we played cards for a few hours and went to sleep. That night it was Chris who woke up. As he told me later, he had been thirsty and had snuck into the kitchen. From there he saw it: A candle was burning on the patio table where we had been sitting in the evening. A candle that definitely hadn't been there a few hours ago. That was when Chris called me and woke me up. The tenseness in his voice worried me because he is usually a very easygoing guy. "Another one," was all he said, pointing outside when he saw me coming around the corner. 

We felt kind of scared, but at the same time didn't quite know what to make of it. It seemed like a weird prank to go to the trouble of quietly lighting candles at night to scare tourists. Chris stepped out onto the patio and extinguished the candle, and after that we got our cell phones and started a Google search: Was there some weird Danish custom of welcoming new neighbors by putting up candles? We thought it unlikely, especially since we had no immediate neighbors, but figured there must be an easy answer. But our search turned up nothing and as we were really knackered we eventually went back to bed.

Chris fell asleep within minutes, but I lay awake for a while wondering if it could be Chris was playing tricks on me. It didn't seem very likely. He seemed really annoyed the night before and he really appreciated his sleep. Still, I took it upon myself to pay attention to see if he might have had something to do with it.

I noticed that I perceived our little cottage village differently after that. What had seemed idyllically remote to me before now seemed almost eerie. As we walked to the fjord, past the gardens of empty cottages, I wondered if they were really as abandoned as they seemed. Had the curtains there also been drawn on the first day? Had the light blue bicycle always been parked in the driveway? I had the feeling of seeing suspicious things everywhere. Chris and I didn't talk about the candles that day; maybe we thought if we stubbornly ignored what was happening, it would scare us less.

That night, I couldn't sleep. The cottages are made entirely of wood, they constantly crackle and creak, and I lay still and listened. Next to me lay Chris, breathing in and out quietly. But there was another sound, soft and distant. At first I thought I was imagining it because it was so quiet, but when I sat up I was sure: every five seconds I heard some kind of drop, water on metal, like a tap dripping into the sink. I overcame myself and stood up quietly. I carefully walked around the bed and into the hallway; the dripping was indeed coming from the kitchen, apparently we hadn't turned off the faucet properly. I rolled my eyes inwardly because that everyday sound had scared me for what felt like half an hour.

But when I entered the kitchen and peeked around the corner into the living room, I froze. A candle was burning on a side table next to the fireplace.

I wondered where the bloodcurdling scream came from, until I realized that it was mine. It was a sound I had never heard before, because I had never been so afraid. I ran back toward the bedroom, from which Chris shot out, white in the face. "We have to get out of here!", I yelled at him, grabbing our shoes and the car keys.

In the car we thought about where we could go. The small town nearby already seemed deserted during the day, nothing would be open there at night. The only store we could think of was a tiny 7-Eleven store at a gas station halfway down the road, which we had passed several times before. Relieved, we found that it was indeed open. We rushed out of the car into the small store, where a young man was lounging behind the counter playing on his cell phone. Astonished, he looked up and stared at us; we must have literally looked like we were on the run, out of breath and in our sleeping clothes. Chris and I looked at each other. We had no plan whatsoever, we just wanted to be somewhere that didn't feel like we were the last people on earth. The clerk said something in Danish and repeated it in English when he saw we didn't understand. "You alright?" he asked moderately interested. "Yeah, sure, we just came from a motto party," I answered, realizing how stupid that must sound. But the guy didn't seem surprised. He nodded and started clicking around on his phone again.

Chris and I strolled aimlessly through the rows. Slowly, my heart started beating a little slower again and I tried to get a clear thought. "Someone was in the cabin," I whispered to Chris, and the thought made me shudder. Chris who was only wearing boxers and an old t-shirt nodded and stared back at me, tired and confused. In that moment, I felt terribly sorry for him, who had needed this vacation so badly. Suddenly I was absolutely sure he had nothing to do with any of this.

To calm myself down, I continued to roam the rows, looking at the food without actually seeing much. Old country songs were playing on the radio and it was pitch black outside, the window panes reflected as much as if you were looking in a mirror. I stopped in front of the magazine rack. The selection was small, there were two dailies, a few women's and car magazines and, in the row in the middle, an old book.

I reached for it and opened it. The cover was dark brown leather and the pages were yellowed. It had many short chapters, each beginning on the right page and illustrated with a drawing on the left. I kept turning the pages, but couldn't read anything as the text was in Danish. The bookmark, a red ribbon, was in the middle, by a text titled "Fyrtårnet." My eyes wandered to the picture next to it. The drawing showed a lush garden with berry bushes and wild flowers. In the middle, a stone rose from the tall grass, and on it, my blood froze, stood a small candle.

I took the book and carried it to the guy behind the counter. "What's this?", I asked breathlessly, setting it down in front of him. I must have seemed like a lunatic, but I didn't care. The guy lazily looked up and at the book, puzzled. "How should I know?" he asked, hesitantly flipping open the cover. "It's yours, it was on the magazine shelf," I said, but he just shrugged. "It's a storybook of Danish sagas," he said, looking up. "Why do you ask?" I opened to the bookmarked page. "What does it say?", I asked him. I noticed Chris stepping up beside me. He looked at the drawing and found the candle. I heard him draw in air sharply, a horrible little sound.

"The title means "The Lighthouse"," said the guy, whose name, I now saw on a small pin on his vest, was Jakob. "It's a pretty well-known fairy tale around here. Some say it's actually a true story about the lighthouse down on the beach." 

I asked him to share it with us, so Jakob told us the story of the lighthouse keeper and his son. The keeper's wife and mother of his son, Jakob said, had died in a heavy storm, and so the son was all the father had left. Every night the two of them played a game. While the father shone the lighthouse into the darkness ashore, the boy lit a candle at home and placed it in the window that could be seen from the lighthouse. Thus the son saw the light of the father, and the father saw the light of the son. They repeated that night after night until one day, misfortune struck the family again. The son fell asleep at the window sill and forgot to extinguish the candle. The flame spilled onto the wood and a little later the whole house was on fire. The father saw the fire from the distance, but by the time he had made it home, it was too late. His son had already perished in the flames.

Many years later, when the father was old and frail, one night he discovered a candle in his garden. The next night, he found another candle, this time a bit closer to the cottage. The third night, a third candle appeared, this time inside the house.

The father was sure that the candles were warnings sent to him by the spirit of his son. He left his home behind, and sure enough, mere minutes later a thunderstorm came up and a lightning strike set the hut on fire. It burned down completely, but thanks to his son, the father had a few more years to live.

„So yeah, that's that“, Jakob said, awkwardly scratching his head. He obviously and understandably felt uncomfortable telling fairy tales to two complete strangers in the middle of the night.

Then suddenly the embarrassed grin disappeared from his face and he stared at me, his gaze blank and distant. "You need to go home," he said in a voice that sounded nothing like his own. My heart stopped. I turned to Chris, whose eyes were still fixed on Jakob. "Sorry, what?" he asked him, his voice almost pleading, as if he wanted to believe he had misheard. 

Jacob blinked and shook his head slightly, his grin slowly resurfacing. "I have to close up here soon and the next guy won't be here till seven, so you'll have to leave, sorry," he mumbled, already reaching for his phone again.

I took Chris by the hand and pulled him out of the store. "We have to get back!", I yelled, realizing that I sounded absolutely histerical. "I know this is crazy, but I know I'm right. Tonight was the third night, the third candle, we have to get to the cottage!" 

Two and a half miles never felt so long. The car flew across the road and the black of the night had turned to a dark blue. Soon it would be dawn. We approached the wooded area and I almost expected to see flames rising above the canopy. But as we turned into the narrow forest path leading to our cabin, everything was quiet. We ran inside and rushed into all the rooms, unsure what we were looking for. Nothing was out of the ordinary, everything seemed to be fine. 

Chris and I almost collided in the kitchen. Our eyes met and I saw myself in his distorted face: he looked like a maniac, rushed, anxious, his underwear sweaty through despite the cool night. I almost had to laugh with relief. In our circle of friends me and Chris are known as the rational couple, the ever sensible ones. And now here we were, like straight out of a bad horror movie. Whoever had set us up got us good.

We put on something warmer, got two beers from the fridge and sat down on the shore of the fjord. The sun was rising on the horizon, turning the water bright orange. It was breathtakingly beautiful. We stared off into the distance, our gazes simultaneously landing on the lighthouse. And then it was Chris who finally let out a snort of laughter. I joined in until I couldn't breathe and my stomach hurt. Tears were running down our faces.

Chris took a sip of beer and looked at me. "Congratulations, that was really good," he said, raising his bottle. "What do you mean?", I asked, still smiling. "Your prank, everything - I completely fell for it, like a gullible idiot," he said.

I stopped smiling. "That wasn't me, Chris" I said. "Seriously, I didn't do any of that." I could tell he didn't believe me. He grinned at me, expecting me to join in any second. I didn't join in, and I could slowly see the doubt creeping into his eyes. 

My cell phone buzzed and we both jumped. On the screen I saw it was Maddie, my best friend from home. She obviously hadn't considered what time it was here in Denmark. I picked up and immediately sensed that something was wrong. Maddie's breathing was irregular and I heard she was crying. "Elli“, she said, her voice trembling, „I'm so sorry, your house... something must have caught fire... it burnt down. There was nothing they could do.

You need to come home."
