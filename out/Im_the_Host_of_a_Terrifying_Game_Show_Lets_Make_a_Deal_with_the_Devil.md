Season 2 Finale
 
“You look worried Bruce,” my producer jokes, moments before going live. “Even for you.”

This gets a chuckle from the crew.

“Quiet on the set!”

I’m already shaking in my shoes. Not a good sign. Working for the Devil is extremely stressful. And dangerous. And certainly not for the faint of heart. Why I took this gig is beyond me.

(Cue creepy music)

“Going live in five…four…three…”

I get the nod.

(Cut to camera one)

“Greetings Hell Beings and hell raisers. Welcome to the Season 2 finale of….”

(Cue the audience)

“LET’S MAKE A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL.”

I wave my arms in the air.

The audience jumps to their feet. 

Someone heckles.

“Alright. Knock it off.”

I serve up my best game show-host grin. It looks as fake as this cheap Hollywood studio.

“As you probably know, my name is Bruce Davie, and I’m the host of…”

(Cue audience)

“LET’S MAKE A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL.”

There’s a disturbance in the audience. A crew member forcefully removes someone. The commotion settles, and I get the go-ahead.

“Phew! A feisty crowd tonight!”

My painted-on smile takes up the entire screen. So does my gleaming bald head.

“Now I know what you’re thinking. What’s the Devil got in store for us this evening?”

The audience rumbles.

I shrug.

“Honestly, I wish I knew!”

This is true. But I’m sure it has something to do with me spending an eternity in Hell. It’s right there in my contract, which runs out after this episode. 

(Cut to camera two)

“So, without further ado, let’s bring out tonight’s contestants, shall we?”

The audience roars.

“And yes, you heard me correctly. Tonight, for the first time ever in this show’s defamatory history, we’ve got two contestants!”

Audience is on their feet, whooping and hollering.

(Cut to camera three)

(Cue music)

A middle-aged couple promenade towards the podium. They’re dressed like cowboys, and walk with a sense of purpose.

(Split screen)

“Welcome, both of you.”

More like: Welcome to your funeral.

“Tell us a wee bit about yourselves, why don’t you?”

(Cut to camera four)

The woman speaks first. Her hair is amber, her complexion as pale as light beer.

“Well, Bruce. My name is Tammy. I’m a stay-at-home mom. This here’s my partner, Tex. He owns his own gun shop. We live in Austin Texas, with three beautiful children, who are with us here tonight.”

She points.

(Cut to overhead camera)

Two tall boys and a young girl, each dressed head-to-toe in denim, stand and bow.

The audience applauds.

(Split screen)

The other contestant approaches the microphone. He’s as tall as an ivory tower, with a voice like a banjo.

“Howdy Bruce. Good to be here.”

He tilts his cowboy hat. His square jaw and rugged good looks give Chuck Norris a run for his money.

I salute them.

(Cut to camera two)

“Well then, now that we’re finished with the formalities, I do believe it’s time to…”

(Cue audience)

“BRING OUT THE DEVIL.”

(Cue creepy music)

(Cue pyrotechnics)

The stage fills with fire and brimstone. Pentagrams slice through the air. The Devil appears suddenly, dressed in a shiny new devil suit, tailored specifically for tonight’s show. It’s jet-black, and leaves little to the imagination. His pitchforked tail follows closely behind him as he approaches the podium.

(Cut to Camera five)

The Devil wraps his arms around the two contestants, kisses them both on the cheek.

Tex, clearly perturbed, winces, then grudgingly wipes his cheek.

The Devil snarls, then looks him up and down.

“Looks like everything isn’t bigger in Texas,” the Devil teases. Suddenly, he’s grown over eight-feet tall, and is looming over the tall Texan. 

(Cut to camera three)

The bright lights and furious makeup make me look like a cartoon.

“What an exciting night this promises to be!”

Tammy steps forward.

“You bet it is, Bruce. We’ve watched every episode. We just love…”

(Cue the audience) 

“LET’S MAKE A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL.”

(Cut to camera three)

“Of course!” Damion boasts. “This is Hell’s most popular show. And for good reason.”

He slaps the woman’s backside with his tail, then raises his eyebrows mockingly.
The cowboy puffs out his chest, fists clenched, daring him to touch his wife again.

“Woah, easy there pardner.”

Damion nudges Tex. 

Tammy is flushed. “Don’t mind Tex. He’s the jealous kind.”

“Oh really?”

Damion’s tail is now shaped like a lasso. With it, he snags Tammy and pulls her close. Her face turns tomato-red. 

The cowboy grunts, pulling it off with one strong swoop. 

The audience boos.

The Devil snickers.

I feel sick. If this is to be my last episode (or final day on Earth), I don’t want it spoiled by this denim-clad dude whose hat is bigger than his brains, or by Damion, who seems extra feisty tonight. Even for him.

(Cut to camera one)

I clear my throat.

“Tell us, Tammy and Tex…no, tell all of Hell…what it is your beating hearts desire?”

The audience is on the edge of their seats.

(Split screen)

The Texans exchange doubtful looks. 

The wife takes charge.

“Well Bruce,” Tammy says. “We don’t want anything that might get us killed. 
Being from Dallas, we were raised with some common sense.”

The audience hisses.

(Cut to camera five)

The husband steps up.

“That’s right, Bruce. Simply put, we want to be famous for a day. That’s it. Then we can write a book and live off the royalties.”

The audience erupts into a frenzy of catcalls.

(Cut to camera three)

The Devil’s eyebrows touch the top of his head. His voice slithers like a snake.

“Is that so?”

My heart plummets. These Texans are flirting with disaster. If they’d stuck to the script, they might be safe. They were supposed to ask for a lifetime’s supply of Super Bowl tickets. Easy-peasy. Who do these cowpokes think they are? Do they really think they can outsmart the Devil?

“Well then,” I say, shakily. “I’m sure Damion can arrange that.”

I raise my arms.

“What does the audience think?”

The audience goes ballistic.

(Cut to camera three)

The Devil, still towering over the Texans, leans into the camera.

“Famous, eh?”

His lips smack against his face. When he touches the dude’s shoulder, the cowboy swipes his arm away.

The audience boos. Someone tosses an egg onto the podium, narrowly missing the contestants.

“Woah! Easy does it!” I spurt out.

All hell breaks loose.

(Cut to overhead camera)

The crew gets busy, disposing of both the egg and the agitator.

(Cut to camera one)

I wipe my sweaty forehead.

“Tough crowd.” 

The audience hoots.

The Devil sneers.

“SILENCE!”

Flames flash across the room. 

People shriek, including me.

(Close up of Damion)

The Devil, boasting his gambler’s grin, turns to the contestants.

“Yes, yes. You WILL be famous. But just for one day.”

The audience roars their approval.

I shudder. Never in all my years, have I felt so much animosity from an audience. I’ll be lucky to make it out alive.

(Split screen)

“Sounds like the Devil has a plan.”

I try to sound cheerful. But cheerfulness is the opposite of how I feel.

(Cut to camera one)

“Tell us Damion…and all of Hell…what you’ve got cooked up?”

The audience leans in. 

(Cut to camera three)

The Devil winks at Tammy.

“Well, I do believe it’s time for those two cowpokes to become famous. Am I correct?”

The audience jumps to their feet, chanting: “FAMOUS.… FAMOUS…. FAMOUS.…”

(Split screen)

Tammy looks pleased. Her partner, on the other hand, is showing concern. His 
shoulders are tense, he’s swallowed his bottom lip.

Damion dazzles the audience.

“Famous, y’all shall be.”

He snaps his fingers.

BAM.

The studio goes dark. 

Someone in the audience screams. 

Tammy gasps. 

Tex grunts.

(Cut to camera one)

I shrug. 

Is this Damion’s latest trick? Or did they finally cut the power? We give the impression that this show is hugely popular; but in truth, outside of Hell, this show is a dud. Cable and internet companies avoid us like the plague.

(Cut to overhead camera)

The contestants vanish under a cloud of fog. 

A flaming pentagram floats across the stage.

“Well, isn’t that just dandy!” 

The Devil points to the large screen behind the audience. 

“Mister and Missus Cowpoke are about to jump the falls!”

He snaps his fingers, then he disappears. 

My legs go weak. My heart is beating irregularly again. I still don’t know he does it. How any of this works. Suddenly, I’m alone on stage, shaking in my fine Italian boots, while the audience grows rowdier by the second. 

Cameras mounted on drones are pointed at Tammy and Tex, who are trapped inside a large, steel barrel, with Niagara Falls looming below them. 

Damion flies across the falls, lands next to Tammy and Tex.

He taps the barrel.

“Ain’t she a beauty?”

The audience hurrahs.

The barrel is unlike anything I’ve ever seen. Although it’s huge, and probably weighs a ton, it barely contains the two Texans, who are kicking and screaming, cursing up a storm.

“Get me the hell out of here!” Tammy’s voice rips through the noise of the falls. “NOW!”

Damion frowns.

“You wanted to be famous. Am I right?”

The audience chants, “FAMOUS…. FAMOUS.… FAMOUS….”

Tex pokes his head out of the barrel, cowboy hat and all.

“Now wait one minute, Damion. That’s unfair. We wanted fame. Not death.”

The Devil chuckles.

“The two are synonymous, am I right?”

The audience agrees.

Damion checks his watch.

“Well then...”

He slams the lid shut. 

That’s the end of the Texans, as far as I’m concerned.

(Close up of Damion)

“Whatcha think? Should they jump the falls?”

The audience shouts, “JUMP…. JUMP…. JUMP….”

(Cut to camera two)

My insides are melting. I’m petrified. You’d think working with the Devil would get easier over time. You’d be dead wrong.

“Looks like the people have spoken!” I hear myself say.

The audience continues their chant.

(Cut to overhead camera)

“Excellent,” Damion says, fiddling his fingers.

He looks over the cliff, and makes a sour face.

“Wowsers. That’s a long way down!”

“JUMP…. JUMP…. JUMP....”

“And so much water!”

(Cut to camera one)

My worried-sick face appears on the screen. 

I straighten up. 

“Once they jump, Tam and Tex will surely be famous!”

Except of course, they won’t be famous. Not in this world anyways. They’ve been duped. Why these people sign up to die is beyond me. Perhaps we’ve reached a spectacular level of stupidity in human evolution. 

(Cut to overhead camera)

Damion’s lips stretch across his reddened face, his arms flex like a weightlifter.

“I’ll give them a helping hand.”

He rolls the giant barrel to the very edge of the cliff, ignoring the banging and hollering coming from within the steel coffin.

“Tammy, Tex…” His lips stretch into a snarl. “Prepare for fame!”

The audience is on their feet.

Damion shoves the barrel over the edge.

(Split screen)

The barrel tumbles down the falls, disappearing into the fast-moving water.

The audience holds its breath.

(Cut to spy camera)

Inside the barrel, the Texans are shrieking. Their heads and arms and legs collide. Chunks of puke pour across Tammy’s sickening face, who’s calling Tex every name in the book, and it’s a big book. Meanwhile, Tex is like a frog in a blender. His face is green, his nose is broken; blood is leaking from every orifice.  

There’s a loud crash as the barrel plunders underwater.  

(Cut to overhead camera)

The barrel resurfaces, traveling dangerously downstream.

The audience is back on their feet, fist-pumping.

(Split screen)

What troubles me is how the pedestrians and tourists, crowding the streets, remain oblivious. To them, this is nothing out of the ordinary. Nobody watches, or even takes a pic. I’m starting to suspect foul play. Somehow, Damion is controlling this. He’s using dark magic. A spell. Maybe none of this is real. Except of course, it is real. 

(Cut to camera one)

I’m trembling.

“What a jump!” my voice ricochets off the studio walls. “They’ll be famous in no time!”

The audience chants:

“FAMOUS…. FAMOUS…. FAMOUS….”

(Closeup of the Devil)

“Yes, yes. An excellent jump, I must say.”

He peaks over the edge.

“Looks like they could use some help.”

(Cut to overhead camera)

Damion flies towards the barrel, which is bouncing off rocks and debris.

(Cut to spy camera)

Blood. So much blood in such a tight space. Tammy’s hair is in disarray. Her face is beyond repair. Tex swallowed his hat. One of his eyeballs is bouncing like a Superball. His left arm is flapping nonsensically. It isn’t attached. 

(Cut to camera four)

The Devil scoops up the barrel, then flies to shore. When his feet touch the ground, he shakes off the water, cat-like, then glares at the camera.

“What a jump!”

He cranks open the lip.

(Split screen)

Tammy spills out. So does Tex’s left arm.

The audience gasps.

Damion applauds.

“Such valor and swagger!”

(Cut to camera five)

Tammy is flopping fish-like, barely clinging to life. Her mouth is full of blood and brains.

The Devil puts his foot on her head.

“SAY CHEESE.”

From out of nowhere, a photographer appears.

SNAP.

Damion, looking pleased with himself, is suddenly holding a newspaper.

(Closeup of newspaper)

The headline splashes across the screen: IDIOTS JUMP THE FALLS.

(Cut to camera four)

Damion shoves the newspaper in front of her face. 

“Looks like Tammy and Tex are famous.”

Tammy's eyes twitch. Clearly, she needs medical assistance. I’m surprised she’s still alive. Her husbands brains are splattered across the inside of the barrel. The very sight of this makes me gag.

Tammy tries to speak, but fails. Her eyes are filled with rage.

Damion tosses the leftover arm into the water, then shrugs.

“Sorry about your hubby.”

(Cut to camera two)

With wobbly knees, I face the audience.

“Looks like the barrel got the best of Tex!”

The audience bellows.

I continue to talk involuntarily. 

“Gosh dolly. Look at all that blood!”

“MORE BLOOD…. MORE BLOOD…. MORE BLOOD….”

I find myself chanting along. 

Suddenly, my vision blurs. I clutch my chest. Maybe I’ll suffer a heart attack on live TV. Hell waits for no one, I suppose.

(Cut to camera four)

Tammy spits blood on Damion’s boot.

“Devil be damned.” I blurt.

Damion’s face twists into a ball of fury.

“Now, now, Tammy. That wasn’t very nice.”

He crushes her fingers with his boots.

Tammy yelps.

“I was gonna save your long-limbed partner over there,” he points. “Not anymore!”

The audience is bloodthirsty. Paper airplanes and rotten eggs whizz past me. I duck just in time.

(Closeup of contestant)

Tammy’s tongue is leaking from her bloodied face. She’s missing her front teeth.
Damion digs his spiky heel deep into her blood-soaked abdomen.

“I reckon you’ll need medical assistance.”

He snaps his fingers.

Suddenly, they're back in the studio. 

Damion is as happy as a filthy pig. Next to him is Tammy, who’s caked in blood and gore. Her corpse-of-a-husband spills from the gigantic steel barrel, taking center stage. 

(Cut to overhead camera)

The contestant’s children rush the stage. They’re delirious.

The crew hurry out and drag them aside, along with Tammy, who's rushed to the hospital, where she will certainly die.

“Now that’s what I call speedy service!”

My voice appalls me. So does this job. If only I’d listened to my mother, and got into politics.

Damion snaps his finger, then disappears under a plume of dusty smoke.

(Cut to camera one)

“Well, there you have it folks. That’s the last you’ll see of Tammy and Tex. But fret not, they had their moment of fame…in Hell!”

The audience is tossing trash onto the stage.

I narrowly dodge a projectile.

“Hope you’ve enjoyed Season Two as much as I did.”

I hated it.

“And, unless the Devil strikes me down,” and he very-well might, “I hope to see you this Fall, for Season Three of…”

(Cue the audience)
