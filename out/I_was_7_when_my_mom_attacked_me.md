Since i can remember my mom has always been sick. Sometimes she would get a little better but that didn't last long most of the time. The worst part is that it was almost a secret. No one dared to talk about it in our family. No one talked about anything really. So as a child you really don't know how to navigate that. As my mom had to go more and more to the hospital, our family grew more and more apart. So when the attack happened eventually, i was alone.

It was the beginning of December and the air was cool and crisp. I was cycling home from school after we had our Saint Nicolas party in class. Its a holiday in my country that is quite similar to Santa Claus, only he is dressed differently and has a horse named "Badweathertoday". Roughly translated. So my bag was full of Biscoff's and chocolates and i was excited to go home and try them. 

Since no one really talked about the problems in our family, i would eat to keep my grieve/fears under control. My dad knew this so he locked our 'candy cabinet' to keep me from getting fatter than i already was. So getting candy from school was like a little secret to keep in my room. Although it would always be gone by the next day. 

My mom's birthday was the day after Saint Nicolas but since she was so sick we couldn't really do anything fun for her. We tried to keep her company but as young kids my brother, sister and i really didn't know how to entertain her for longer than 5 min. I was eager to get my candy out and eat it under the covers of my bed so i was trying to make up and excuse to go to my room. But my mom was smart.  
"So, anyone got any presents from Saint Nicolas in school today?" she tried to sound cheerful but her face didn't match the excitement she was trying to give. She was too exhausted to even force a smile. Her hospital bed was arranged in the living room for better access and me and my siblings were scattered across the room doing our own thing. 

"Well?" 

I tried to avoid her eyes and was acting busy with a piece of dust I've found on the floor. Like it was interesting

"Katy? Not one piece of candy from school?"

Dammit i was caught. I looked back at her and i saw a little grin forming on her face. Even her little smile lines were showing around her eyes. But her eyes were still dull and she looked tired. I gave her a cheeky smile back. "Maybe..."

"Lets see what you have!"

As i was getting the goods from my schoolbag i heard my sister yelling "Me too! I've got like 20 candies!" My sister is 3 years older than me and we were always very different. She was outgoing and the life of the party. While me and my brother, who is 5 years older, were more timid. We were more like my dad who kept his cards close to his chest. While my sister was more like my mom, before she got sick that is. 

When i came back to show my mom what I've got from school my brother looked up from his Gameboy. His eyes worried and sad. I could tell he was thinking about mom a lot. Since her diagnosis his face became more mature and serious. Only his friends saw his fun side. When he could forget. 

Mom picked 3 little pieces of chocolate out of the bag and gave them to me. "Don't tell dad." She said with a wink. "I'll keep the rest to save for later"

I opened my eyes and it was dark. My curtains blocked out almost all of the light. The only light coming through was a small line from the street lights that settled on my door. I heard some rumbling in the hallway and looked at my alarm. One of those big red ones that serves a double purpose as a nightlight since it shines so bright that it gave this corner of my room a red hue. 01:30, i wondered who was making noise this late. The rumbling stopped and i fell asleep again. 

The next day, my moms birthday, i noticed she was acting different. She was moody, agitated and would snark at us for using too much butter and making a little mess when we ate. Something she's never done before. I figured maybe she was mad because she was sick again on her birthday. I tried to remember a year where she wasn't but i couldn't. 

After a few days her demeanor never changed. Always moody and frustrated about little things that didn't matter. After about a week we tried avoiding her altogether. That made her even more frustrated. She would snark at us the moment we came home from school. So my siblings and i spend most of our time in the garden playing or in our rooms. 

2nd week of December is when things started to go downhill with her. She became weaker and weaker and i couldn't understand why. Her mood never wavered and became sort of expected from her. She became mean and vicious. Her words were like the bullies at school. "Do you really need to eat that? You can go without food for a couple of days with that belly!" No one ever said anything. Afraid her fire might shift onto them. I started crying and went to my room. I've found a mini snickers i saved in the bottom drawer of my nightstand. I sighed a breath of relieve and moments later i fell asleep crying with a mouth covered in chocolate.

*I can't breath.* 

*Why can't i breath?*

*Why is my chest heavy?* 

I opened my eyes and was surrounded by darkness. I tried looking at the alarm but something is blocking its light. The weight on my chest became heavier and with the shift the red hue came back.

"Get the fuck out of my house now! Who the fuck do you think you are?!"

The red hue marked her face. It was angry and pale. I could feel the weight shifting from my chest to my neck. Heavy, so heavy. My face became warm and my ears started to pop.

*I can't breath*

"Why are you here? You don't belong here! Get the fuck out of my house! Get the fuck out of my house!" 

Her grip tightened and suddenly i was wide awake. I started clawing at my neck to get the weight off but she was using her whole body weight to keep me down. I started kicking my feet, or trying to, and started punching her naked body. But i was 7 and she was a grown up. I didn't stand a chance. 

Her face still angry, the red hue was starting to fade. She released her grip around my neck. *I can breath.* The red hue came back and i could see her standing up. She turned around and grabbed my leg. With a swift pull she dragged me off the bed. She was using such force it was like she was never sick at all. Before hitting the ground my right leg was caught on my nightstand. I could feel a sharp sting and it started to feel warm. Before i can check she grabbed my shoulders and put them against the side of the bed.

"Tell me who the fuck you are right now!"

The room became engulfed in light and i could see my dad standing in the doorway. So shocked he couldn't move. When his shock settled and he realized what was going on he pulled her back and she lost her grip on my shoulders. I saw my chance and crawled my way to the bathroom across the hall and locked myself in. I took the little kids stool i used to go pee and put it in front of the mirror. My lips and neck were purple. My shoulders red. I looked down and saw the small gash in my leg. Blood flowing and forming a waterfall that dripped off the stool onto the bathroom floor. I couldn't feel it. I could only hear my mom screaming at the other side of the door.

I crawled into the corner of the tiny bathroom and put my head against the wall to rest. I was tired and it was hard to breath. The lights began to fade and everything went black.

"Katy sweety, do you need a hand?"

*I know that voice*

"Katy?"

When i opened my eyes i was met with a familiar face. Normally very stern but right now all i could see was worry in his eyes. "I'm fine grandpa" I could see him looking at my neck and leg and his expression changed. His eyes were sad. "Lets get you back to bed, but first we'll fix that leg of yours! What do you think?" He lifted me up and put me onto the sink. He started rummaging through the cabinets and after a few seconds he's found the emergency kit. Carefully he bandaged my leg and tried to clean up the now dried up blood off of my foot. I started to look around and noticed the door was broken. The hinges were crooked and the lock was laying on the ground next to the toilet. 

He picked me up and carried me to my room. The room wasn't covered in a light red hue anymore. It was almost fully lit from the blue and red lights coming from outside. Grandpa put me on my bed and immediately turned around to cover the lights more with my curtains. But there were still stripes of blue and red going all over my room. When he turned again i could see he was almost crying. I asked what was wrong but he just sighed and pulled the covers over me leaving my face out. 

"Nothing hunny, we're okay."

He was lying. The grown ups always lie. No one ever tell me anything.

"I'll be in the hall if you need me."

The next few weeks were weird. Mom still didn't recognize me or my siblings but it was fine since i only saw her on the weekends when we could visit the hospital. She was always mean and confused. I didn't recognize her either.

She never said sorry. She didn't remember. But i remember.

  
Christmas came and she was allowed to stay at home for the holidays. She was more pale than usual. Dad settled her on the hospital bed in the living room and told me to come closer. As i approached her bed i could see her turning her head in my direction. Her little smile lines appeared around her eyes. But her eyes looked more sad than ever. She gave me a smile and took my hand to pull me closer and up onto the bed with her. 

I was confused, was she going to be mean again? Is she going to hurt me? She pulled of her headscarf and put it loosely around my neck. "This is for you Katy, I'm not going to need it any time soon" 

"Why not?" I asked.

"You know" She hesitated and rubbed her hairless head to scratch an itch the scarf gave her. "You know i love you and I'll always be with you, right?" 

I nodded. Still confused by the change of behavior. She pulled me closer and onto her lap so my head could rest on her shoulder. 



"*Wij zijn twee vrienden. Jij en ik. Twee dikke vrienden. Jij en ik. Wij zijn er altijd voor elkaar al worden we meer dan honderd jaar. Wij zijn twee vrienden. Tot de laatste snik, snik, snik"*

  
*"We are two friends. You and me. Two biggest friends. You and me. We'll always be there for each other even if we are older than one hundred. We are two friends. Until our last breath, breath, breath.*"

Cancer took my mom away. It took her brain, her dignity, her hair, her breasts, her skin, her light in her eyes. But it never took her memories for long. The good and the bad. The little smile lines around her eyes were proof of that. She was warm, kind, sensitive, smart and caring. Cancer made her into a monster that little me didn't recognize. But now she's safe, pain free and i had the chance to say goodbye forever. We didn't get to be more than one hundred together but we'll have forever when the times comes. Thank you for reading. Hug your mom for me.
