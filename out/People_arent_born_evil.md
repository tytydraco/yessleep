That's what I always believed.   

I'm no philanthropist, and I know all healthy humans are born with   

the ablity to kill, but the thing is - There's no concepts in the minds of babies.   

Newborns and toddlers alike don't understand what's good and evil anyway, hell  

, they don't even get life and death. That's why you don't take young kids to funerals.   

What would the point even be ? You may dress your kid up in finest black, yet   

they'll just run around frantically. That's how my parents raised me.   

I was a good kid. I cried a lot, but I was never a nuisance in public spaces.  

It usually took my mom less than a minute to calm me down, and i never  

threw tantrums. I only cried when i fell down, or hurt myself in some way.  

That's what's interesing in the topic of child killers. "Monkey see, monkey do"   

as the saying goes, and mimicking our parents is a key feature of human development.  

What the fuck have those kids had to be succumbed to, to be able to raise a knife and  

kill with cold blood ? Surely, a big portion of people will just shrug and tell You  

"Oh, it's just domestic abuse" or "His head wasn't right" but I always thought of it  

as ignorant. Going back to the "good vs evil" topic - What does it mean to You ?  

Of course, You think you know it, right ? Killing's bad, rape's bad, stealing's bad...  

yaddi, yaddi, yadda... But, imagine there's a tribe, somewhere deep in Africa  

or South America, and to become a man, a boy has to rape a girl. For us, it's shocking  

, for them , it's a sign of manliness. Even us, westerners, differ in what's good or bad for  

us, even in the slightest. Killing a person who hurt your dog, for example -   

some would call it overkill, some, i believe, would even torture the person.   

And we, as adults, pour those things into little kid's heads. That's why i always   

thought a certain kid from my block was...weird.   

  

I live in a small, Polish town in the south-west, and for the sake of this story, i'll   

be using english variants of the names. My next door neighbors were  

Agatha - a slightly overweight, extremely friendly middle aged woman, Tom -  

a towering, muscular man with a giant beard, deep in his 40's and Sebastian - their son.  

He's always given me the creeps. Especially his eyes. Bright, blue eyes, almost fake looking.   

I despise babies and toddlers, especially how they stare at you. He, unfortunatelly, took  

staring at people as his hobby. He,too,never cried, not even on a plane

,never in my life have I heard even a "wah" come out of him.  He never seemed to like me too much, though.   

Not that he laughed at me, called me names or hysterically ran when he saw me.  

He just, fell dead silent whenever i was close. As all babies do, he coo'd, laughed   

or babbled sometimes. Then i waltz in and ? Silence. dead silence.   

For the most part, that were the only oddities about him - Just an  

unordinary kid, in an ordinary house with ordinary parents.  

The year he turned three, was when it all started.   

Sebastian had a huge talent for drawing. Whatever he scribbled onto paper with his  

crayons, was way above his level of development. My mom still has my drawings  

from childhood, and loves to show them to any girl i bring home, or my friends, so   

they can have a free laugh, and i can sit there, embarrased. As you can imagine,   

they were stick figurines with "realistically" , in my childhood mind, drawn eyes.  

Sebastian's drawings weren't ultrarealistic too, yet, sure as hell, they did not look   

like a toddler drew them.  Everytime he was drawing something, he would stay  

as quiet, as in my presence.  Most of his drawings featured things a kid would draw normally. 

Animals, him and his family and all that.   

But then, i started to notice a strange pattern.   

I was the one to take care of Sebastian most. Agatha and Tom trusted me with their lives  

, and, well, Sebastian must've been their life, as he was with me almost every weekend.   

I understood them, though. They wanted to feel young and free again, and the fact, they did  

not bring their creepy kid to any place they went ? Angels in disguise.   

He loved drawing under my supervision. The first picture i was shown, was of a black puppy  

, from what i've deduced , a labrador.   

Two weeks later, i saw him walking a dog. A black labrador puppy.   

My eyes went wide, but i thought, hey, he brought the picture home, his folks saw it  

, and they thought "It must be his dream dog !" and bought it. They were always   

extremely spontaneous, and very well-off. They sometimes joked around, how i'll   

get their car in their will, since i love BMW's so much.   

But i still could not shake off the feeling that something was wrong.   

Years passed, and his drawings seemed to match the future every time.   

He was at my hosue again. Polite and quiet as can be.   

This time, he drew hismelf, me and his parents in front of an amusement park.   

As a coaster nerd, i instantly recognised it to be Heide Park in Soltau, Germany.   

Two weeks later, i was invited for a trip to a theme park.   

'Please, Energylandia...God, fucking, please, Energylandia !" - i thought to myself.  

But we went to Soltau. I needed a moment when i stepped out, seeing the same rollercoaster   

he drew. This time, he gave the picture to me. Neither Agatha or Tom had the opportunity   

to see it, yet, they still took us there. To goddamn Heide Park.   

I did not sleep that night, nor did i do the next one. Thank god it was the weekend, and i could  

take naps in the day. I thought of all the drawings i saw.   

When he drew a puppy, he got an identical one two weeks later  

He drew his dad in a broken car, two weeks later, he had a fender-bender on a parking lot.   

He drew a solar eclipse, two weeks before it was announced on TV  

and the damn amusement park.  There were other drawings, but it seems my mind completely  

rejected their significance not to drive me completely crazy.   

This year, he turned 10 years old, and since being invited to his birthday, on which

,i was one of the only guests, i haven't seen him. 

Days turned into weeks, then suddenly, their house, once  

so full of life, went dead. The lights were off, nobody responded to my calls, and the car was gone. 

They went out a lot, but this time, i didin't get an invitation, nor did Sebastian come to my door to be babysat. 

I was worried, and absolutely terrified.   

after falling asleep at 3PM again, and having a vivid nightmare i decided "fuck it".   

I would go there, and do anything to get in the house. As i went out, holding a hammer in hand, 

which could help me break in, if they did not respond, i was shivering. 

I knew i could see anything. From an empty house, to all three suffocated in a gas leak.   

I started banging on the door, calling their names out. As my strikes began to hurt, i swung  

the hammer at their door, and kicked it in. Still, no effect. But then i heard it. Crying.   

Sebastian was crying, fucking hell, he was wailing like an injured animal.   

Creepy or not, he was like a little brother to me. I shouted, telling him to be calm  

as i'm coming in. I ran to their backyard, smashing their glass backdoor to pieces and running in. 

I dropped the hammer, and covered my mouth. There laid Agatha and Tom. Spread eagle on the floor, dead. 

Flesh wounds eminating with dark red, dry blood, as Sebastian sat on the floor and cried. 

He did not even care to look up at me. 

I walked up to them, tears in my eyes as well. He hugged my leg, apologising. With a trembling hand, 

he handed me his drawings, and confessed. 

Before he drew something, it would appear in his dream. He just had to draw it.   

I turned the page, and stared at it in shock. The picture depicted Agatha, held down by three men. 

One was taking a swing at her arm with an axe, as the other two held down the screaming, crying woman.   

Tom was sitting on a chair, right in front of it all. Tied up, beaten, and cut up.   

His wife was also injured. she had various cut wounds, bruises, and was missing an ear.   

\-I d-drew that..a week ago..- he sniffled. -I..i just..didin't want them to suffer ! I'm sorry !-   

He cried and screamed, as he held my leg tighter.   

I was about to faint, as i dragged him away from his parents' corpses.   

I looked him dead in the eyes.   

\- Where..are You in the picture ?- i asked.   

He stopped crying, looked at me with his tear struck face and said.  

\- i don't know.- As he too, collapsed.  

I called the cops. Of course, it was days and days of running to and from   

the station for questioning and interrogations.   

They almost immediatelly denied the fact i could be the killer, they found Sebastian's   

fingerprints on the bodies and knife, and i had an undeniable alibi.   

Of course, i never mentioned the pictures, as the last thing i wanted, is to be locked away   

somewhere, with crazy fucks. The kid was not so lucky. I cried a lot during the next   

six days, sleeping for about 12 hours total during it all.   

A day later, exactly two weeks after he made the drawing, and one week after i discovered  

what he has done - Sebastian died of a seizure attack.   

People aren't born evil. But some are born psychic.
