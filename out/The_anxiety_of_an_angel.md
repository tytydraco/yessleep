Our ancestors feared death. They knew of its lingering presence. Of its inevitable touch. But they found comfort in the presence of a life after death. However, the uncertainty of it all prevents the fear from going away. The fear of death, or better yet, extinction, is an evolutionary trait. One that is prevalent in every living being to ever exist. The most primal instinct of a living being is to breed to prevent the extinction of its species with the preservation of life being needed to complete that generational task.

After the birth of a child, they cling first to their mother for love and care then they meet the father. The mother cares for her offspring while the father gathers food and supplies needed for the survival of their family. Together, they live as one family. Either they create more or they don’t. What’s important is that they reproduced and kept the bloodline flowing.

But what if this generational responsibility that all of us share presents itself as a curse? That God did not strip us of our eternal life and bliss after our banishment from the Garden of Eden. That the curse of Eden *was* the existence of man. For the only way to enter the pearly gates of heaven was to kill every being in existence to ascend as one. For the fruit did not give knowledge but life. All that died and will die, will never be able to enter paradise for the people who mourn them continue to breathe the breath of life. And that the wait for annihilation is met with pain grander than the cosmos tenfold.

Christ comes not in the form of divine light and hope. He comes bearing the face of apocalypse. All that is and was shall come face to face with the wrath of its maker. The earth shall be covered in jagged spikes, the air be hotter than flames, the water as rotten as a corpse, and life unprosperous. And through all of that, all the souls that waited for extinction shall ascend to heaven.

But to end it all is to be merciful. And that, our God has never been. Moses and I both agreed. Yet we continued to write of it to appease his prideful nature. We prayed day in and day night to be spared from the pain of death. We passed it as it was so that those who read believed. It was a gamble that gave us millennia of stability. Moses passed yet I remained. For a reason unclear, God returned me to Eden and blessed me. He did not grant me eternal life. He gifted me divinity. He turned me into an angel. I am outside of life and death. Or so I thought…

Christ came in many forms, most notably of a great war. I knew for God told me so himself. He was many several figures. He opposed and antagonized himself. He depleted every country of its resources and purposefully plunged them into chaos and anarchy. Then he burned it all with the weapons made by men with the intent to destroy fellow men. Christ then took on the role of the Anti-Christ. He began to give the mark of the beast. He persecuted and executed those who did not receive his mark. In an act of “loyalty” to Christ, many of those who believed chose to sacrifice themselves not knowing that the entrance to Heaven is blocked by existence.

Then he left. Removing what is needed to survive. All that he left was a plague that prolonged life for centuries but made its victims feel the burning of every sun in the cosmos. They all died a slow and horrible death. Wandering the earth, hearing their screams. I was not affected yet hearing the cries for help of man has turned me into a husk of my former self.

Then one day, the sky turned blue and the air became breathable again. Grass grew, and Trees rustled. But the sun scorched the land enough to burn the skin. Then, God banished me from the Garden of Eden. I thought that it was my time to ascend to paradise. But then I realized, I was never let back in in the first place. I was just spared from the effects of his “salvation”. He gave me everlasting life but also everlasting hunger. He cursed me to have a corrosive touch that would rot the food that I held. He planted trees brimming with leaves but provided no shade. I was spared from the torment of death but forced to live the hardships of life, alone in this empty world. Silent and eerie. God turned me into an anchor to prevent the souls of the dead from ever ascending to heaven. Then left me to rot here alone, even after the sun expands and explodes.

Death was once my fear but now is my goal. For without my release, the souls of those who left can never be free. Life as a treasure exists no more. Salvation is not divine; it is annihilation and genocide. Forever shall we suffer so long as life remains, may it be a fly. Disobedience was not the sin for the sin was the gift of life. God wanted us to eat the fruit, for he was the snake that lied.
