I used to work at a reputable audit firm and the events of my last night there still haunts me.
 
It's been two days since the incident, and I can't shake the feeling of being watched. Each passing night, the shadows in my room seem to grow darker and have more substance to them.
  
My fellow coworkers, I fear I am running out of time but if you come across this post, heed my warning. You need to leave that place now!  
  
It happened on the night of September 2nd, around 11 PM. Anyone passing by the office building would have noticed the dim lights on the third floor, illuminating against the dark surrounding buildings. My colleague, Awais, and I were the only ones working late, due to an audit deadline. Was it our negligence or laid-back attitude that led us to this situation or was it the client sending the data just an hour earlier? Truth be told, both sides were to be blamed. 
  
The sound of fingers striking laptop keys echoed across the empty floor. Both of us were surviving on caffeine at this point, evident from the scattered paper cups on the table.  
  
In the midst of reviewing my calculations, a faint scraping sound caught my attention. As soon as I looked up from my laptop, it abruptly stopped. I quickly scanned the dimly lit office but found no source of the sound. To my right, Awais seemed too absorbed in his work to have noticed it. Convinced that I had simply imagined it, I turned back to my laptop screen, only to hear it again, faint but distinct.  
  
The sound came near Awais. As I turned towards him, he burst into laughter.  
  
"You should have seen your face," Awais said, struggling to contain his amusement.  
  
With a sigh, I slumped back into my chair. Work had really fried my brain.  
  
"You know what? Let’s call it for the night,” I said. “I mean, you could wrap things up by pulling an all-nighter but our Boss is most likely not going to approve the over-time.”
  
Awais nodded in agreement.
 
“Today’s your last day here. Might as well start enjoying life a bit, huh?”
 
We both chuckled.  
  
As we began packing up, Awais paused and asked, “Have you heard from Asjad? He left the company a week ago, and we haven’t heard a word from him.”  
I shook my head. A week wasn’t a long time, however, we both were good friends with Asjad. Him suddenly going silent and not answering our calls was very unlike him. 
  
"You think the rumours are true?"  
  
I paused for a moment and then shook my head in disbelief.  The firm had a wild grapevine network and, sometimes, absurd rumours surfaced through it - particularly the ones claiming that people who left never really made it out.
 
"Asjad not answering our calls had to have a logical explanation, rather than some absurd rumour. He had mentioned that his phone was giving him all sorts of trouble before he left," I stated.  
  
"Sure, but what about Sarah and Ahmed?"  
  
Sarah and Ahmed were definitely a peculiar case. They both had plans to move to China, so it was possible they hadn’t yet found the time to reach out. However, that was about three months ago. With Sarah expecting a child in a few months, they were probably caught up in all of that.
  
I turned picked up my bag, turned around and raised my arm.
 
“Buddy, you speculate all you want, I’m heading out. Don't worry about such stuff. The grapevine is notorious for childish and absurd claims.”  
  
Awais wasn’t convinced but he didn’t say another word.  After that, we shook hands firmly.
 
Awais picked up his bag and headed towards the elevator. He stepped inside and glanced back, “You coming?”
 
“You go on, just want to reminisce about the last four years.”
 
Awais nodded and the elevator doors slid shut. As I stood by the elevator, I took in my surroundings. The old overflowing cabinets, the attendance recorder – each sight sending a rush of memories.  
  
"Never thought I'd witness this day, especially not after four years of being here."  
  
The elevator had arrived and I stepped into it. The doors closed, and the descent began. The floor numbers gradually ticking down from three.
  
The elevator jolted and came to a sudden stop. Odd, the firm’s elevator was horrendously slow and most likely had no functioning safety features. Surely, I couldn’t have reached the ground floor this quick. I looked at the elevator panel, only to find the lower portion of "2" and the upper portion of "1".  
 
The doors still hadn't opened. I repeatedly pressed the buttons and even attempted to brute force the doors open, but to no avail. I reached for my phone to call the night security guard, hoping he could open them from the outside. Just as I lifted my phone, the elevator doors slid open to a dark corridor.
  
Glancing back at the panel, I noticed that it still displayed the same numbers as earlier. I tapped the panel and pressed the buttons, but nothing happened.  
  
Frustrated, I adjusted the strap of my bag and stepped out of the elevator. As soon as I did, the doors closed shut. I turned around, only to see the elevator panel indicating that the elevator was descending to the ground level.  
  
"You've got to be kidding me."  
  
The corridor was unfamiliar; It didn't match any floor layout I had seen in the firm. With my phone's flashlight, I scanned the dark corridor and spotted a partially open door at the far end. In a last, desperate attempt, I pressed the elevator button, but it remained fixed on the ground level. Admitting defeat, I slowly approached the door at the other end.  
  
I carefully pushed the door open, my body on high alert for reasons I couldn't quite explain. Sweeping the room with my phone’s light, I found empty workstations and chairs. I scanned the area, moving the beam from one workstation to another. In all my four years at the company, I had never seen this room before. I searched for a light switch but there was none. No windows either. Odd.  
  
As I approached the first workstation, I noticed the name ‘Akhtar Ali’ taped to the desk, accompanied by a photo of a man in his late thirties. Strangely enough, I had never seen or met him in the office before. I directed my flashlight towards the adjacent desk, where the name 'Parveen Nabil' was written - another unfamiliar person.  
  
Something was off. I hurried past each table; each taped with a name tag and a picture of a person. As I reached near the end of the table, one name stopped me in my tracks. There was no mistaking it. Moving closer, I confirmed that 'Asjad Bashir' was written there, accompanied by a picture taken on his last day of work. I moved the light next to it and saw Sarah and Ahmed’s picture was also present.  
  
I took a step back from the table, shocked at what I had just seen. Why was the office maintaining some bizarre memorial for all the staff members who had left?
  
There was one final desk next to Asjad's. I stepped toward it, a shiver running down my spine at what I saw. The desk had my name taped on and even more unsettling was that the picture of me was the one Awais took a couple of hours ago, after everyone had left.  
  
"What in the world is going on?" I muttered.  
  
At the far end of the room stood another door. I approached it cautiously and pushed it open. Immediately, a horrendous, rotting stench invaded my nostrils, making me gag. Covering my nose, I took a step forward but tripped over something and stumbled to the floor. My phone flew several feet away, its light casting long shadows across the room As I slowly rose, I noticed an arm lying next to my feet. Startled, I stood up, only to be confronted with a horrifying sight.  
  
The floor was covered in dried blood. From the ceiling, several chains with meat hooks dangled from the ceiling. Countless bodies hung from them, their mouths impaled on a hook. Dismembered limbs littered the floor, adding on to the nightmarish slaughter room.
  
What in God's name was I witnessing? Trembling, I retrieved my phone, a lifeless head came into view and the was unmistakable. It was Asjad Bashir. The corpse had begun to decompose but the face was still recognizable.  
  
Next to a pile of bones and corpses, another door led somewhere, dim light leaking from beneath. I quietly made my way toward it, pressing myself against the dirty walls and peered through the crack. Inside, a huge, obese figure stood about seven feet tall and looked to weigh over 500 pounds. He stood with his back to me, which was covered in scars and stitches. Gripping a massive meat cleaver, he was busy dismembering a lifeless figure on a table before him. With each swing, limbs fell off, and blood sprayed in all directions. 
  
"Gotta love it when the little fishy swims right into my hands," he rasped, a cruel chuckle escaping his throat as he turned and looked me right in the eyes.
  
Shocked and terrified, I jumped away from the door as it exploded into splinters. The man had thrown his cleaver with monstrous strength. I quickly hid behind the pile of bodies.
  
"Oh boy, oh boy, looks like the little fishy swam away. I do love me some good hide and seek."  
  
In the darkness, I made out a giant silhouette retrieve his weapon and then slip into the memorial room. Gathering what little courage I had, I quietly entered the butcher's room hoping to find a means to escape. The room was a blood-splattered chaos. In the center stood a large table, with limbs on it from the previous victim. I frantically searched the room for a key, a button, anything that could help me escape.  But there was nothing.  
  
"I don't want to die… I don't want to die," I muttered, my voice trembling. 
  
At that moment, I noticed a large finger hanging on a cleaver keychain from one of the walls. I quickly grabbed it only to be alerted by booming footsteps, behind me.  
    
"Well, well, the little fishy has strayed too far from the fishing net."  
  
A giant hand yanked me upright and spun me around. I came face-to-face with one of the ugliest faces I had ever seen, grinning back at me. I struggled to break free from his grip, but he was too strong.  
  
"Oh, the little fishy is putting up a fight. I do love me some strong fish."  
  
He flashed a toothy grin and threw me onto the table. Placing his enormous hand on my neck, he began to strangle me.  
  
"Now, playtime is over, fishy. Time to die."  
  
He brought his face closer to mine, a sadistic smile spreading across his lips. I clawed at his hands, but his grip tightened. I gasped for air and that made the man laugh. 

Summoning my last ounce of strength, I clenched the cleaver keychain tightly and drove it into his eye with all my might.  
  
The man howled in agony and stumbled back. Coughing and gasping for air, I scrambled to my feet and then sprinted out of the room.  
  
"You piece of shit, I'll skin you alive!" roared the butcher.  
  
I took out my phone and illuminated my path with its light. Hastily finding the door to the memorial room, I entered it. The room was now a mess, with overturned tables and broken chairs. I exited the memorial room, rushed down the corridor, and reached the elevator. I frantically pressed the buttons but there was no response.
 
"Come on, come on!"  
  
Despite multiple attempts, the elevator remained motionless. I heard a loud explosion behind me, signalling that the man had entered the memorial room. Just as despair began to set in, I remembered the giant finger I had picked up. I used it to press the elevator button, and to my relief, I heard the elevator gears move and the panel showed that the elevator had begun its ascent.  
  
The elevator doors opened. The light from the elevator shone in the corridor and I saw him running towards me.  
  
"Get back here, you little fish!"  
  
He raised his cleaver and hurled it towards me. I used the finger and slammed the ground-floor button. The doors closed shut just in time, saving me from being sliced in half.   
  
The elevator descended and stopped at the ground level.  
  
The doors opened, revealing the reception area of the office, with the night security guard sitting there. As he saw me, he quickly stood up and approached me.  
  
"What happened to you? You're a complete mess, and what's with all the blood?" he asked, bewildered.  
  
I struggled to form any words. I then bolted out of the front door and ran, not even bothering to call a taxi. I needed to distance myself from that place and everything I had witnessed.  
  
On reaching home, I immediately locked all the doors and barricaded myself in my room.
 
During all this, I noticed a single text message notification on my phone. It was from Awais.
  
"So… you got away. For now :)”
