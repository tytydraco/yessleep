When I held Levi in my arms for the first time and saw his eyes connect with mine, something inside me had changed. The metamorphosis of a man’s body and mind when holding his newborn for the first time is extraordinary. The lifeforce of a father and child, flesh and flesh, deploys an inseparable magnetization that only the strongest love can create. I was him; he was me.

Love took on a whole new meeting the day he was born. Never before had I felt a sensation so powerful, a sensation that would inspire a civil man to spill blood for the protection of their child. I loved him more than I loved myself. I would have died a thousand agonizing deaths if it meant Levi would feel no pain. When Levi disappeared, I died an agonizing death every hour of the day and continued to do so for the past twenty-five years, each death more painful than the last. Misery.

Seeing the parents at the park playing with their kids, smiles and laughs filling the air—it infuriated me. My emotions were misplaced and unjust. I was jealous and had no right to be angry. Their families knew no pain and seeing them take their lives for granted made me want to get on my soapbox and beg them to enjoy every moment with their children. They could never know what real love felt like until they lost what they assumed would be a permanent fixture in their life.

The blood stain on my shoe symbolized the purity and strength of my love. God, did it feel good to love again. I slid my fingers across my stained shoe and rubbed them together, meditating on the sensation of my fingers sliding with ease. It made the bond between Levi and I feel stronger. The parents back at the park may have never seen a love so strong which would have explained their off-putting reactions. I didn’t want to live in a world where a man couldn’t protect his son from a psychopath willing to cause harm to a man holding his precious boy. That man knew no love and I am saddened that he had to find out what real love felt like.

Levi was balling in the back seat repeatedly asking if I had killed that man, shouting that I shouldn’t have hurt him. I felt awful that I had elicited such emotions from him, but he was too young to understand the difference between vengeance and justice. In vengeance, there is no love, unlike in justice.

Through Levi’s wails and tears, a smile slowly grew on my face. I became excited at what Levi was going to think of me as soon as he calmed down and rationalized the situation. I was going to be Super-Dad. The best dad ever, the strongest dad in his world, protecting him from trouble all around. Since the moment I felt his skin on mine, all I wanted was to be his superhero, and that’s what I had just become.

The hypnosis from the center lines on the highway dragged me deeper into thought. One million lines away was Kelsey’s house. One after the other, I counted them knowing the higher the number got, the closer I was, the closer we were, to having our family back.

“Hey, Levi?” I said looking back at him through the rearview mirror.

Levi continued to sniffle and pout.

“Buddy, when we get to mommy’s, let’s not tell her what happened in the park. Ok, bud?”

Levi refused to look at me. It was going to be a long ride.

When Kelsey and I got divorced, it was hard, but when she decided to pick up her life and move five hours away, it was even harder. I didn’t understand her reasoning. I tried explaining that if she moved away, Levi was going to have a difficult time acclimating to such a disjointed life with his parents living in two different states when the police inevitably found him. Watching her hope demise was painful and every reason I gave her to stay close to me was about to come to fruition in a grand ‘I told you so’ moment.

The sun was going down and my heart began to palpitate as soon as we arrived in Kelsey’s town. I had no idea what I was going to say or how she would react to Levi’s grand reveal. Like me, she was probably living a semi-normal life, wearing an attractive mask that exuded happiness, hiding the darkness underneath to get her through her days. With Levi, we would rip her mask off her face and gift her all the smiles and happiness she deserved.

We pulled into Kelsey’s driveway. The walls of my throat were nearly bound together in anxiety. My breathing sputtered and my chest tightened as I got out of the car to let Levi out. With each step we took towards her door, Levi dragged behind pulling me back. He appeared to be more nervous than I was. I knocked on the door.

My blood pressure, beating like a drum behind my ears, drowned out my knocks as I stood on Kelsey’s front porch in agonizing anticipation. I held my breath as I heard the fumbling of the locks from the other side of the door. Levi squeezed my hand tightly.

The door opened. I was with my family.

My breath was stolen from my lungs seeing Kelsey again. She looked stunning, absolutely divine. The only wrinkles that had found her face were the ones framing her screaming mouth as she hit the floor with excitement. The wrinkles quickly disappeared under the concealment of her left hand as she used her right one to scoot herself away from Levi and I. Her shoeless, socked feet slipped on the floor trying to back away.

I quickly jumped through the door and shut it behind me to turn down the volume of Kelsey’s screams from the outside. Her actions were warranted, but the sounds were alarming. The public didn’t know about Levi’s return, and the last thing we needed was snooping neighbors ruining our family reunion.

“Babe…” I said trying to get her attention. Hysteria was filling the room. I needed her to calm down. “Babe, I know it’s a miracle! I couldn’t believe it either!”

Kelsey rose to her feet and started running away. I knew she was taken off guard, but I wished she could have calmed down enough to understand how her actions were making Levi feel. The poor kid was terrified. I lunged toward Kelsey and grabbed her from behind. To hug her again thawed the frost in my heart and filled it with warm vitality. I could feel myself becoming whole again.

Her arms and legs were flailing as I carried her over to the couch. When I sat her down, she began screaming for help until I threw myself on top of her, covering her mouth and restraining her, hoping I could calm her down. She continued fighting with me, digging her nails into my skin. I didn’t know how much longer I could hold on to her. From across the room, Levi stood in the corner shaking.

Underneath my hand, Kelsey’s screams faded into cries. Her body loosened up, wearing herself out under my restraint. Inside her chest, I could feel her heart beating in synchrony with mine. It was like we were in love again.

“Honey,” I said, “I’m going to take my hand from your mouth, ok? Can you promise not to scream?”

Kelsey shook her head.

Slowly, I removed my hand from her mouth. Our eyes connected. I could feel her breath on my face. It had been so long since being that close to her that I wanted to bathe myself in the moment.

“I know this is tough. I was surprised too.” I said.

“I don’t know what to say.” Kelsey said.

“There’s nothing to say, but there’s a lot we need to figure out.” I turned to Levi, “Buddy, come on over. Come say hi to mommy.”

Levi, a little shaken, walked over to the couch and sat between Kelsey and me.

“I missed you, mommy.” Said Levi.

Kelsey stroked Levi’s hair, “I missed you too baby.”

My eyes began to well up watching Kelsey bury her face into Levi’s shoulder, wrapping her arms around him in a motherly embrace. I rubbed Kelsey’s back with one arm and pulled Levi in with the other. For the next ten minutes, we sat in silence and cried together as a family.

Sitting on that couch was magical. The decades spent falling into a dark, eternal hole had come to an end, and together we could have filled the pit with new memories. With each minute that passed by, I pulled my family in just a little tighter and felt the rekindling of love get a little stronger. I was never going to let them go.

“Where did you find him?” Kelsey asked.

“I didn’t find him, babe. He found me. I tried calling you. Why didn’t you answer?”

“I just…I just didn’t think it was real.”

“Believe me, I know what you mean. I knew this day was going to come. I knew he was out there somewhere. I knew without a doubt he would come back and bring us back together.”

“What should we do?”

“I have no idea. This has all been a lot to take in. It’s been driving me completely mad. I think we just need to take everything a day at a time and get accustomed to our new lives.”

Levi looked at Kelsey and crawled into her lap, “Does this mean you and daddy are back together again?”

I chuckled as he stole the question right out of my mouth. Kids have no grace with their words. Although his delivery was much more blunt than mine, I stared at Kelsey waiting for her response.

“Of course, baby.” she said, kissing Levi on the forehead.

I wish there was a mirror around to see what a genuine smile looked like on my face when Kelsey answered Levi. When she saw my smile, she placed her hand on top of mine. I turned my hand over and laced my fingers with hers and moved in for a kiss. Her velvety lips pressed up against mine made twenty-five years of my miserable life disappear. All of the sleepless nights, the painful cries, the vicious arguments, the crippling loneliness—it all ventured off into a place of non-existence. I was happy.

I was never a religious man, but having my family sit with one another, shrouding each other with love made me think a God was out there somewhere casting its almighty fortune onto us. Perhaps God felt my terrible pain and undying hope that Levi was out there somewhere in the universe and by his almighty hand, God gave Kelsey and I a second chance at happiness.

“Hey, babe?” Kelsey said, “I’m going to go use the restroom. Do you need anything when I’m done? I bet you’re starving.”

“No, my love. All I need is you and Levi.”

As Kelsey stood up, I grabbed her lovely face and gave her a kiss. She dragged her hand across my chest as she walked away and went upstairs to the bathroom. I was living in a dream. While she was gone, I rocked Levi back and forth in my arms thinking about what the future held. I thought our lives together were a closed book, but it had been reopened with thousands of pages of chapters yet to be written. All the birthdays that were stolen from us, the sporting events, the graduations—there was far too much to be excited about for my tired mind to comprehend.

I sat there waiting for Kelsey thinking about her offer. Food did sound good. It certainly wasn’t too late for us to go out and have our first family meal in two decades. Just the mere idea of our server asking if we’d like crayons and a coloring mat for Levi made my smile even wider. Kelsey had been gone for a while and I know how nauseous I felt when Levi came knocking at my door. I went to go check on her.

Her stairwell was covered in pictures of her life, but not one frame had a picture of Levi. I knew she had lost hope. I couldn’t wait for us to add family pictures to her collection. When I got to the top of the stairs, I heard whimpering from behind the bathroom door.

I knocked on the door, “Sweetie, are you alright in there?”

Kelsey shrieked from behind the door, “Get the fuck away from me!”

“Babe, what’s wrong?” I was entirely confused.

“Oh my God, he’s at the door. He’s at the door!”

Kelsey was violently crying. I beat on the door.

“Kelsey, what’s going on in there?”

“Please,” Kelsey said, “Please help me.” Her last word faded out into her cries.

“Kelsey, open this door right now!”

“Get the fuck out of my house you lunatic!”

Her words began to cut deep. I had no idea what was happening, but Kelsey was scaring me. Down the stairs I saw the lower level illuminated with red and blue flashing lights. I couldn’t believe what she had done. I was not going to let them take Levi away from us. I started kicking at the door.

“Open this God damned door right now, Kelsey.”

I would not allow her to tear this family apart.

“Open the fucking door!”

I had lost my family once, and I wasn’t losing them again.

“I need you, Kelsey! Levi needs us!”

If she didn’t need me, I didn’t need her.

“Don’t do this to me, Kelsey!”

If she had it in her cold heart to do this to me, to get me taken away from Levi, she was about to see what I was going to do to her. I kicked the door, cracking it by the frame. The terror in her cries rattled through my brain. I kicked the door once more, her screaming masking the sound of it breaking open. She was crouched next to the toilet with her phone, still on the line with 911, in her hand. She was helpless.

I ripped the towel rod off the wall as she begged for mercy. She didn’t deserve my mercy. She deserved me and Levi. If she didn’t want to be a mother again, she could have said something. Her poor judgement led to this. I raised the rod over my head, my grip so hard my knuckled began to swell. None of this was my fault.

“If you don’t need a life with me and Levi,” I said to Kelsey, her eyes red with fear, “Then you don’t deserve life at all.”

…

The last thing I remembered from the bathroom was being deafened and sharp pins and needles shooting through my legs. The ride in the ambulance was all a blur. When I woke up in the hospital the doctor said I had been shot five times. He said it was a miracle that I had survived, but at that point, I was used to miracles.

After some recovery and gaining my lucidity, I was visited by the police. They informed me that the man in the park perished due to head trauma. I explained the situation and claimed self-defense, but they weren’t buying it. As for the scene I caused at Kelsey’s house, I will be the first to admit I became a little aggressive at the thought of her taking Levi away from me, but from what I understand, she is totally fine. A little rattled, but fine.

It was a hard pill for me to swallow when the police showed me videos from the park carrying around a child-sized mannequin dressed in Levi’s old clothes. Even more alarming was the recording Kelsey took of me talking to her in a child’s voice. All the evidence got me put in this miserable psychiatric hospital.

None of it makes sense to me. It had to have been made up. Kelsey had to have framed me. Levi was there. Levi is still here. I demand an appeal immediately. I have no life, no freedom, nobody to love me. All I have is Levi. He still comes to see me every night. Last night, he gave me this knife to help me escape.
