When my boss called and told me I was getting shipped to Tasmania for two weeks, I wanted to fucking lose it. Five years crushing it for this company and I should be on a yacht in Saint-Tropez. Now I’m on a plane to some backwards island.

David Stone-Ross , this billionaire “philanthropist” (Wanker)  who used to be a finance bro and is now a tech tycoon, went and played Indiana Jones in Ghana at one of his investments. 

When he saw Dr. Kieren Van De Berg filming his new doc about modern slavery in mines, he decided he was going to start a mine using AI and no human labour.

Then, while the cameras were rolling, David declared that by 2040 all mines would be out of Africa and he’d find older mines in other continents to reuse with AI and “new tech.”

I’m sorry but the guy is a flowering brassica. I nearly got fired for calling a client a cabbage, so that’s what I have to lean on now in these nonsense times.

After landing, I’m picked up by some miserable-looking bloke. The weather’s not terrible. The drive from Launceston is okay. Nice trees and shit. Whatever. It’s getting pretty dark only 5:30, but it’s like being back in London. I already miss the city. I need a pint. Many, to be fair.

The driver is an alleged mute. I’ve tried talking, but it doesn’t compute. Funny people, the Australians. The road gets narrower and it feels like we’re in a coffin of black trees. We hit some gravel road and start heading down a gorge, fucking terrifying. Fair play to the lad, though. He can drive.

My boss decides to call and tell me the mine accommodation is still being built, so he’s put me in an Airbnb in the town next door. A driver will pick me up in the morning. Hope it’s not this chatterbox.

The worst thing is, I actually like my job. I’m a data analyst, usually for deep tech. I know what I’m doing there. I know nothing about mines. I also know nothing about this shithole.



As we drive down the gorge, we get back onto what looks like a freshly tarmacked road. It looks like smoke ahead, but the driver doesn’t care as we drive through it for what feels like forever.

“Can you see, mate?” I yell from the back. … “Good chat, mate.”

Once we turn off the road, the smoke seems to disappear behind us and it looks like we’ve just arrived on a different planet. Holy shit. Probably as beautiful as Marbella after a couple cheeky ones.

Tiny little coastal shacks, all in uniform, spread across the bayside. As we drive down the hill I can see the start and end of the town, but the moon reflects perfectly off the water.

“This it?” I ask.

“St Forsyths,” the driver says, then hands me my suitcase like he wants me gone. Good to see he was saving his voice for the big performance.



My shack is fine. I walk in, looking for a key, I guess they don’t need them when the town’s only fifty people. I have a shower, get my pulling shirt on, and head down to the pub I saw when we drove in.

Walking by the bay is nicer than walking through Hyde Park, I’ll give it that. Maybe it won’t be bad after all. The other side of the bay is just bush. The only lights I can see are in this little village.

It’s pretty cold, and as I hide under my two jackets, I can hear people laughing from the bar and music faintly playing as I get close.

‘The Abel Dodge.’ Pfft. What a terrible name for a pub. I prefer the classics like *Prince of Wales* or *Constitution*. Those are my locals.

When I walk into this older brick-style tavern, I can see a fire going and can still hear the laughing. I wait at the bar.

“Hello?” I yell.

Nothing.

I ring the little bell behind the bar that’s clearly for last call. Still nothing.I can still hear people talking and laughing but I can’t fucking see anyone.

It’s not a big place.  I open the door out the back and see a staircase.They must all be upstairs.

As I go up, the noise gets louder.

 It takes me into this old hall-type room. What the fuck?

There’s a big black box speaker sitting on a stand. All that noise I heard is coming from here.

I look around the room, it’s just me and this 90s boombox. I walk to the window and see a few houses down the road with their lights on.

I walk back down the stairs and try again at the bar. The only two rooms are the bar and upstairs. The music keeps playing, but it feels like it gets louder as I leave.

Probably just dehydration at this point.



I start to walk back to the end of St Forsyths to my place to call it a night. It’s a Sunday, so maybe the pub’s closed, but someone was using it for music. Honestly, I don’t care. I’m too tired for this nonsense.

As soon as I walk away, something catches my eye. I look up behind me to see a man staring at me, smiling, from the upstairs room at the bar. He’s wearing a nurse’s outfit. Not scrubs  the older style only women would wear. White hat. Apron.

This lunatic is smiling at me in a fucking dress.



I’m done.

I turn around and go back to the bar, but the door’s locked.This time the music’s off.

I try to find another way in but see the building only has one entrance. I’m back on the road, looking up at the window, he’s gone. The light is off.



I walk home, defeated and confused.

 My phone has no connection. I haven’t slept.

I crash on the bed.

Fuck this place.



**2 a.m.** I wake up to a howling outside. I’m groggy and lost my bearings.

I run to the lounge in just my boxers and look out the window.

Fuck. Here he is again.

This idiot in the nurse costume is behind the gate, standing knee-deep in the bay, howling like a fucking direwolf.

Not having this for my first day.

I grab an old can of lentils from the pantry, run outside, and throw it directly at him. It connects, but he only moves a little while laughing.

“This is actually getting too much. Mate, can you fuck off?” I yell.

He starts singing some song about ships and a lighthouse. WTF?



I decide to run at him but he jumps in the water and swims off. It’s so dark I can’t see the prick.

I run inside, get my phone, and try calling emergency services. As I’m getting through with the very shit signal I have, I see a shadow in the other bedroom.

I slowly walk over, fucking shitting it.

The nurse sits on the spare bed, staring at me. Clothes drenched. Smiling. Dead eyes.

As soon as he looks up, he jumps towards me with his dead eyes and crazy smile. I fall back  but as I fall, he gets stuck on the kitchen table.

I’m able to run out of the room and into the street, screaming for help.



I see a light on in the shack down the road. I run, knocking on the door. Knock again.

Nobody in.

I open the door and see nothing but a recording of TV playing. There’s no furniture. Nothing.

I look out the window and see the maid man running at me. He looks familiar, but he’s so fucking out of it it’s hard to know.

As he’s walking down the street singing, I crawl out the window and hide behind the gate as he passes.

I can see a light in the bush behind the houses, waving like someone’s trying to get my attention.

As soon as I go to quickly get over the road, the fucking smiling nurse jumps from around the corner and grabs my ankle.

“Got you,” he says, smiling through his dead eyes.

Not today.

I kick him in the head and sprint  like I’m back on the pitch, through the woods up the hill.



I run so fast I can’t see the crazy behind me until I hear:

“Dan… Dan… over here.”

Wait. Who the fuck knows me?

Hiding behind a tree, a man comes out and grabs me quickly.

“Dan, you need to follow me.”

“William?” I gasp from running, but also from shock. William worked with me for several years until he left for a promotion in Singapore.

“Wait, what—”

“I can’t explain right now, but if you follow me we can make it to the morning.”



We run down an old track and climb under a wired fence that Will digs a hole under,  we crawl then he fills it back in.

He takes me into a little house tent made of sticks and tarpaulin with old furniture.

“Here. Sit here.”

“Where the fuck am I, Will?”

“Tasmania,” he quips, looking out of the bivouac.

“What the fuck is that thing?”

“It’s Jared,” he says.

“Who the fuck is Jared?”

“Remember? He was a client of ours. Got caught out whistleblowing.”

“Fuck yes. What happened to him?”



“Dan… were you told you were here for work?” he says with panic in his voice

“Yes.”

He sits quietly.

“They’ve picked you for something else. I heard about it when David was planning it. It’s a place where the ultra-rich can send their enemies and do whatever they want to them.

A group came last week and tortured poor Jared, then drugged him and put him in that outfit. He’s harmless,but the real problem is out there.

No one lives in this town. It’s a trap. People get dropped off every week. Some don’t make it. Some escape and get brought back.

I’ve been here three weeks and realised the only real way to leave is with the driver.”



“Where are the others then?” I ask.

“Most have tried to escape and have either died in the bush or drowned. Some are hiding. Some… are worse than Jared. It’s a prison for the tech industry. They just got weird with it.”

“Why me?” I ask, slowly getting up.

“Because you were a douchebag cokehead who gave everyone a hard time.” 

“Did you feel that way?” I ask

“Yes but I wouldn’t even want my worst enemy here. Anyway… Jared was chasing you because I sent him to warn you. But his drugs make him so out of it he scared you off  which is good, because a car is pulling up now.”

“They think they’ll surprise you and torture you, We need to hide here and let them think you have either starved to death in the bush or drowned. I have stored enough food to last us months and they will be busy with Jared unfortunately” He says sadly.



It’s been four days  now. We’ve been hiding in the hills. The rest of the area is all fenced, and the water’s too cold to cross.

It’s early morning, and a new car arrives. It’s Mr. Ross and a few familiar faces.

“This is our day to get out. Are you ready?” Will asks

“Let’s fucking do it.”
