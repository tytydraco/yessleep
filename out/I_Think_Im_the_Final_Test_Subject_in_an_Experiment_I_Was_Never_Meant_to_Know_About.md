I don’t know when I stopped trusting the edges of things. Not just people - though God knows that list is short now - but the actual edges. Of rooms. Of memories. Of sounds. I walk into a space and I don’t look at what’s in front of me anymore. I look at the corners. I look at what’s just barely out of view. I listen for the way silence curls. 

There’s a term in medicine - “peripheral awareness.” It’s how we track threats in our environment without looking straight at them. You train yourself to catch motion in the margins. But lately, I think I’ve started to live there. I don’t enter a room and look at what’s in it anymore. I look at what’s just out of it. The corners. The gaps behind door frames. That thin slit of shadow under the bed. Like I’m trying to find the negative space where something used to be. Or maybe where it still is.
Waiting.
I guess this is my way of figuring out whether it’s starting again.

No one ever tells you that paranoia isn’t a spike - it’s a tide. You don’t notice it rising until you’re ankle-deep in it, watching your own reflection dissolve in the water. And then one day, it’s up to your chest, and you can’t remember what dry felt like. That’s what this is. A weather report, maybe. An autopsy-in-progress. I’m writing this down not because I think it’ll help, but because I need to know - 
 If I ever forget again.
 If I ever start calling it “just stress” or “just exhaustion” or “just dreams.”
 Maybe this will be the trail of breadcrumbs I leave for myself.
 If I still know how to follow a trail.

Let me back up. My name’s Maya. I’m 27. Used to work nights at Greystone Memorial Hospital. East Wing, primarily neuro-observation. Graveyard shifts. 10 PM to 6 AM.  I didn’t mind the hours; I liked being the quiet one, the background figure that flickered in and out of patient rooms like a shadow that knew how to work IVs. You’d be surprised how comforting a quiet nurse can be at 4:42 in the morning, when the morphine drip starts to wear off and your own thoughts are louder than the EKG.

I wasn’t one of those Florence Nightingale types. No lofty aspirations. I was in it for the stability. The routine. The fact that the world made sense in measurable units: milligrams, liters, vitals, charts. You fill in the form. You input the numbers. You go home.
At least… that’s how it used to be.
The first time I felt it - that warping, that wrongness - I was in the break room, stirring powdered creamer into a mug of the worst coffee in the state. It was quiet. Fluorescents humming like they always do. Fridge ticking. Window reflected nothing  - just black glass with my own tired outline staring back.
 And then the silence changed. . Everything was as it should be.
Except… I don’t know how to explain this without sounding like a freak.
The silence wasn’t right.
It wasn’t absence-of-noise silence. It was… expectant. Like the room was holding its breath, waiting for something to arrive. And just under that silence was a sound I can only describe as wet static. You know when you plug in old medical equipment and there’s that faint electronic fizz? Imagine that, but under water.
I turned around. The door was open.

I hadn’t left it open.
And sitting there - dead center on the breakroom table - was a manila folder. No name. No patient tag. No initials. Just a generic, off-brand folder like the hundreds we use every week.
Only this one was already open.
Inside was a single sheet of paper. One sentence:
“Final phase protocol begins when Subject regains suspicion.”
No header. No date. No hospital stamp.
I stared at it for way too long. Thought maybe someone was pranking me. Or some intern had misfiled one of those boring ethics study memos we all have to pretend to read. But this felt deliberate. Not like a joke. 
When I touched the paper, it felt… wrong. Heavy. Like it held more weight than it should. The ink was too black, too crisp Not even a font I recognized. The letters were sharp, needle-thin, too perfect to be from our overworked printers. They didn’t look printed at all. They looked pressed. Branded into the page, as if the sentence had been seared onto it like a surgical scar.
I don’t remember hearing footsteps. That’s the part that still bothers me. No doors. No clicks. Nothing. Just one second I was alone, and the next - when I glanced toward the hallway - every corridor outside the break room was empty.
 But not “nobody’s here” empty.
 Thick empty. Like the air itself was listening.
 Like something had just left.

Later that night, I went to do my rounds. Or I tried to.
Because when I got to Observation Room 3B - the one with Mr. Halpern, stroke victim, mostly non-verbal - the door was shut. Not just closed. Locked.
That room never locked. It’s not supposed to lock. Patient observation rooms can’t lock from the outside. That’s protocol. Fire hazard. Safety compliance. All of it.
I knocked. Nothing. I swiped my badge. No green light.
I tried again, harder. Same result. No buzz. No click. Just that silent red light, pulsing like a flatline.
 I stood there for a while, stupidly. Expecting… something. For the door to unmake itself, maybe. I knew that room. And now I couldn’t enter it.
 The longer I stared at the door, the more wrong it looked.
 It wasn’t just closed. It was absent.
 As if it no longer belonged to the building.

Fine, I thought. Maybe maintenance did something stupid. I walked to the security desk to check access logs.
The guy at the monitor- Gary, I think - he smelled faintly like boiled eggs  looked up like I’d slapped him when I asked about 3B.

“Ma’am,” he said, carefully, like he was talking to a drunk person, “East neuro’s been sealed off since May. That whole wing’s under asbestos remediation.”

I blinked. Thought he was messing with me.

“I was literally in there thirty minutes ago,” I said.
 “I’ve been assigned there for the past four weeks. What are you talking about?”

Gary checked the monitor. Scrolled through badge logs. Frowned.
“Your card hasn’t accessed East Wing in over a month.”
He turned the screen toward me. Blank. No entries. No logs. No lights.
Like I’d never been there at all.

And that’s when things really started to come apart.
First: the dreams. Except I’m not sure they were dreams.
In them, I’m lying on a table. Not a hospital bed . Not even in a room.
 On a slab. Smooth. Cold. Stone, I think. Something primal in texture, like it belonged in a temple, not a hospital. Or maybe a tomb. I couldn’t move. Not my limbs. Not my throat. Not even my eyes. Just the sensation of being very, very witnessed. There’s a light above me, the kind you see in ORs, but it’s wrong, too diffuse, flickering in pulses, like it’s breathing. My limbs don’t move. My chest doesn’t rise. I feel like I’m awake, but the air is thick and viscous like I’m inhaling honey. Oil. Congealed blood.
There are voices, but they don’t speak in words. Just tones. Low, long, dragging sounds like a cello string being pulled through mud. And something always happens at the end. Just before I wake up.
A face leans over me. But there are no eyes. Only mirrors . I wake up gasping. Every time.

I tried to talk to someone. A supervisor. A colleague. Hell, even my mom. But every time I started explaining, the words came out wrong. Like they didn’t fit in my mouth anymore. Like I was trying to describe color to a blind person.
Worse: things started vanishing.
I don’t mean disappearing. I mean vanishing from memory.
I’d open my laptop and find an open tab for a patient record I didn’t remember opening. I’d see my own handwriting on reports I didn’t recall writing. There were phrases I’d never use. One note said, “Subject stable. No deviation from containment.”
Not “patient.”
 Subject.
I don’t know how long I can keep writing this.
 The lights in my apartment keep flickering.

And tonight, when I came home from another shift they say I never clocked into…
The folder was waiting.
Same manila cover. New note.
Typed, centered.
“Observation integrity confirmed. Proceed with final cognitive descent.”
My name was at the bottom.
 Signed.
In my handwriting.

Not forged. Not scanned. Not copied.
Me.
 My looped, careful cursive. The way I sign prescriptions.
 The way I sign incident reports.
And for a moment—just a moment—I wasn’t afraid.
 Because it made sense.
 Because of course I would approve this.
 Of course I would consent to the next stage.
Wouldn’t I?

Then I noticed something else. Something I shouldn’t have. 
My ceiling fan was on.,But I hadn’t turned it on. And it was spinning too fast. Not dangerously fast. Just… too regular. Like a clock with no hands. Like it was keeping time for something else. That’s when I saw them.

On the wall, just past the corner of my vision Shadows that didn’t belong to anything. Not cast by furniture. Not cast by me. Just… there. Faint. Elongated. Arranged like observation chairs around a patient bed.  And just faint enough that if I stared directly at them, they’d dissolve. 

So I don’t look directly anymore. I watch the edges. I watch the corners. I listen for the way the silence curls. Because I think the final phase has already begun.

And I don’t know if I’m the last one to notice - or the first one to wake up.
