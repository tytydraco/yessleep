I’m writing this on my phone, sitting on the floor of my hostel bathroom in Indore. The power’s been cutting every few minutes, and my hands won’t stop shaking. I don’t know what’s happening outside fully, but I know enough to say this:

Whatever this outbreak is, it didn’t start the way the news is saying it did.
And it sure as hell didn’t start with “fever cases.”

I’m 21. College student. Completely average guy. I’m not a doctor. Not army. Not a scientist. I just happened to see things earlier than most people, and now I can’t unsee them.

So here’s my log.
If anyone finds this later… do whatever you want with it.


(Two Days Before It Began)

It started with the tap water.

At first, I thought it was just rust. Everyone in the hostel gets shitty water sometimes. But that night, when I filled my steel bottle, the water had this… strange shimmer. Like when oil floats on top, but thinner, almost like threads inside.

I showed it to my roommate, but he laughed and said I’m overthinking.

But later, when I took a shower, I swear I felt something like hair brushing against my shoulder. Even though nothing was there.

I slept badly that night.
And that’s when I heard the first screams on my floor.


Day –1

The screams were from Room 307. That guy Rahul, the gym freak—he started vomiting violently. Hostel warden said it was food poisoning. But I saw the puke when they carried him out.

It wasn’t food. It was… pale, almost fibrous. Like wet tissue.

Weirdest part? The warden told everyone not to drink from the taps.
He didn’t explain why.

That same day, the campus WhatsApp groups started blowing up about people collapsing in the metro in Delhi, choking, convulsing. Some video even showed a man’s jaw locked open as he shook uncontrollably.

Everyone said it was fake, edited, clickbait.

Now I know it wasn’t.



 5:12 PM

This is when everything snapped.

A girl from the adjacent hostel started banging on our gate, screaming that something was wrong with her friend. I didn’t see her face clearly, but her hands were shaking like she was freezing.

Except it’s 30°C.

Two guards went near her to help.

She bit one of them before they could even react.
Just lunged forward and bit his cheek.

Not like a crazy person—
like something pushed her body for her.

The second guard tried to restrain her, but she started thrashing so violently her shoulder dislocated with a loud crack… and she didn’t even react.

Another student kept shouting, “She’s not drunk! She’s not drunk!”

She wasn’t.

Her eyes were fully dilated.
Her mouth had that same pale, fibrous stuff Rahul had puked out.

By the time police arrived, she had stopped moving… but her body kept twitching on its own. Like something was adjusting itself under her skin.



8:44 PM

Internet is unstable. The news channels are already lying.
They’re calling it “mass hysteria” and “drug reaction.”

But I’m telling you:
It’s in the water. At least here.

My roommate boiled some and showed me a video he took.
Even after boiling, the water had thin, white, thread-like strands floating and curling.

When he touched one with a spoon, it curled around the metal like it was alive.

He’s gone now.
I don’t know where he went.
He left without taking his bag or his phone.


 11:17 PM (Right Now)

People outside are screaming again.
Someone’s pounding on the bathroom door below mine.
The corridors smell metallic and rotten, like old blood mixed with wet soil.

The worst part?
I can hear something dragging itself up the staircase.
Slow, long pulls.
Like nails scraping concrete.

Whatever is happening… this isn’t just a disease.
This thing changes people. Even before they die.

I saw one of the infected earlier—his arms were hanging too low. Like his joints had loosened. Like he was becoming… flexible. Wrong.

I don’t know how fast this spreads.
I don’t know what’s happening in the rest of India.
But here in Indore, it’s already too late.

If I don’t make it to tomorrow, someone else needs to continue this log.

I’m going to try reaching the terrace when the noises outside stop.
If they ever stop.

If anyone is reading this…
please tell me this isn’t happening everywhere.
