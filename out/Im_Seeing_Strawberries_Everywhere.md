It all started on what seemed like an ordinary Tuesday, a day where I was stuck in my apartment it seemed so perfectly unremarkable that it felt like any other.

And my main plan was?

To finally wrap up the last season of The X-Files, the show I had been eagerly binge-watching.

As I settled in, I noticed the sunlight dancing off my polished wooden table, creating a warm glow. Next to my laptop, I placed a generous bowl of glistening, ruby-red strawberries.

I had brought them along as a guilt-free snack, thinking they would be the perfect accompaniment to my binge-watching session.

I plopped down in my chair in the living room, fired up for the show, and without much thought, popped a strawberry into my mouth, leaning back with my eyes glued to the laptop screen.

But then came the moment of realization that struck a bit too late. As I bit down, expecting a burst of sweetness, I was instead confronted with an overwhelming sensation that eclipsed everything else.

Suddenly, the strawberry—perhaps just a piece of it—lodged itself perfectly in my windpipe.

One moment, I was breathing, and the next, an alarming void replaced the air that should have been flowing in.

My eyes widened in panic, and a scream was caught in my throat, building up but failing to escape.

I tried to cough it out, but the sound that emerged was just a pathetic, wet noise.

In a frenzy, my hands flew to my neck, clawing it and squeezing it in a desperate attempt to dislodge that stubborn piece of fruit.

A sudden chill coursed through me, constricting my senses while my vision was narrowing; my periphery faded into a hazy black void.

My lungs were screaming for air, and each frantic gasp ignited a fiery pain deep within.

I stood up, thrashing wildly, pushing the chair back across the floor in a desperate bid for relief.

I banged on my stomach, hoping that somehow it would help, and resumed clawing at my throat, but nothing was working. 

A frantic pulse throbbed inside my skull, taunting me in the suffocating silence.

My face oscillated between burning heat and an icy chill, a creeping numbness creeped in as my legs threatened to give way beneath me. 

This was it. To meet my end like this, choking on a strawberry, felt like the most absurd tragedy imaginable.

The ridiculousness of the situation only intensified the sheer terror that gripped me in that moment.

As the shadows began to creep in and I felt myself slipping into a state of panic, I heard the unmistakable sound of the apartment door creaking open.

To my surprise, my roommate Matt walked in, having returned home from work much earlier than expected, and his eyes widened in shock at the sight of me.

"Lucas!" he shouted, rushing towards me. 

Without a moment's hesitation, Matt wrapped his arms around my waist, lifting me slightly as he began to deliver a series of forceful blows upward, trying to dislodge whatever was blocking my throat.

My body convulsed in response, but nothing changed, so he pressed on, each strike more intense than the last.

The world around me spun chaotically, threatening to pull me from underneath me as I fought to stay conscious.

Then, with a sickening lurch, I felt a wet cough escape me, and Matt instinctively released his grip.

In that moment, the remnants of the strawberry I had choking on tumbled out my mouth, landing in a gooey mess on the floor. At least it was no longer lodged in my throat.

Gasping for air, I produced a ragged sound, reminiscent of an old man nearing the end of his days, but the sweet, life-giving air filled my lungs, wrapping around me like a warm embrace. 

I collapsed to my knees, trembling uncontrollably, tears streaming down my cheeks as the reality of what had just happened settled in. 

Matt knelt beside me, gently patting my back, reassuring me that everything was alright now, that I was safe.

But all I could focus on was the sticky, red fruit lying on the floor, a stark reminder of my near brush with disaster. 

And just like that, strawberries transformed into my arch-nemesis, leaving me with an inexplicable fear of them that I couldn’t shake.

Right after the incident, I immediately rushed to the emergency room to ensure that I hadn’t injured my throat or caused any further damage to my body.

And after my check-up, the doctor returned with the results, reassuring me that I was completely fine and just needed to take my time while eating.

However, a few days later, my anxiety kicked in, and just the sight of the strawberries in the refrigerator made my stomach twist in knots.

Their smell—a cloyingly sweet aroma—triggered a wave of nausea and a tightness in my throat that was hard to shake off.

Matt, my amazing roommate, took it upon himself to dispose of all the strawberries in our apartment, along with anything else that contained them.

He didn’t seem to mind at all; he just wanted me to feel happy and safe.

Strangely enough, for the entire week that followed, I avoided any red foods altogether, even if they weren’t strawberries.

Apples, cherries, and tomatoes all made me feel a surge of anxiety, even though they weren’t the offending fruit.

People were generally understanding, and a few even teased me gently about my newfound fruit phobia, but they had no idea what I had truly experienced.

I hadn’t shared with anyone that I had come dangerously close to being harmed by a strawberry.

As the days turned into weeks, my fear began to manifest in unexpected ways. At first, it was slow, but then it sped up quickly.

Strawberries seemed to pop up everywhere I turned. It started subtly; I was lounging in the apartment, watching TV when a commercial for a new yogurt brand flashed on screen, boasting that it was filled with real, rich strawberry flavor.

Then, while driving down the street, I spotted a billboard advertising a new dessert, featuring a giant, photoshopped strawberry.

I flinched, my heart racing as I gripped the steering wheel, completely overwhelmed by the sight of it.

“Okay, you’re just overthinking this. It’s all perfectly normal,” I reassured myself, but deep down, I knew this was anything but normal.

When Matt asked me to accompany him to the grocery store and handed me a list of items, I rolled my eyes as I grabbed a cart.

The first stop was the cereal aisle, and as I pushed the cart down the aisle, I was met with a barrage of cereal boxes, all bright pink and red, featuring a cartoon strawberry character, boasting real strawberries in every bite.

I hurriedly grabbed what I needed and darted to the jelly aisle, but once again, I was confronted by a sea of red.

Even when I attempted to grab some ice cream, all I could find was strawberry-flavored options.

When I reached the produce section, I practically sprinted through it, avoiding eye contact with the strawberries that were practically glowing in their display case.

The next time I showed up for work, a colleague brought in a cake to celebrate his promotion, and we all gathered in the break room to enjoy it.

The cake was a stunning vanilla sponge, dusted with powdered sugar and topped with artfully arranged slices of strawberries. 

As soon as I laid eyes on those strawberries, my stomach performed a backflip.

When I was offered a piece of cake, I politely declined, claiming I wasn’t hungry, even though I truly was.

My colleague happily accepted the slice, oblivious to my inner turmoil.

A couple of days after the incident at work, Matt and I were lounging in the apartment, engrossed in a football game, when I suddenly gasped in disbelief.

I thought I spotted a team’s red logo flash across the screen, and for a brief moment, it looked just like a heart-shaped strawberry.

“Are you doing okay, Lucas?” Matt asked, concern on his face.

“I’m fine, just… tired,” I replied, my voice perhaps a bit too high-pitched to be convincing.

But soon, the sightings of strawberries began to escalate throughout the city, and it wasn’t just the fruit anymore; they seemed to be everywhere. 

While strolling through the park, I spotted a little girl in a pink dress adorned with a cartoon strawberry character.

Then, as Matt and I rode the bus to work, I noticed an older woman sporting a scarf patterned with strawberries. It felt like they were popping up around every corner.

Later, while shopping for a birthday gift, I stumbled upon a pair of high-top sneakers that made my skin crawl.

The vibrant red color was striking, just like a strawberry, but they were also decorated with strawberry pins plastered all over the sides.

It was as if the universe had decided to conspire against me, painting itself in the very image of my trauma.

During my usual phone call with my sister Chloe, I didn't live with my family anymore but I still talked with them every chance I could get.

I unloaded everything that had been happening to me—the relentless barrage of strawberries and strawberry-themed items infiltrating my life.

“Lucas, you’re just fixating on these things because of what happened. It’s a common psychological response to trauma,” Chloe explained gently.

I didn’t respond; I simply hung up. I wanted to believe her, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that my mind was playing tricks on me, highlighting every strawberry in my line of sight.

Things took a turn for the worse when it felt as though this was no longer just a psychological fixation but rather some cruel cosmic joke.

Apparently, Chloe had filled our parents in on my situation, and in an effort to lift my spirits, my family decided to take me out for dinner at my favorite Italian restaurant that weekend.

Once we were seated and handed the menus, I began to scan the offerings with the keen eyes of a hawk, deliberately steering clear of anything that involved fruit or red sauces.

I settled on a cheesy chicken pasta—safe, strawberry-free, and just what I needed.

When the waiter brought our meals and set my cheesy chicken pasta down in front of me, I immediately noticed a single, small strawberry, perfectly sliced, sitting as a garnish beside a sprig of parsley on the plate. 

My breath caught in my throat, and I froze, staring at that tiny piece of fruit.

It may have seemed almost insignificant to anyone else, but to me, it felt like a taunting eye, watching my every move. 

And honestly, what was a strawberry doing in an Italian restaurant, anyway?

"Is everything alright, Lucas?" my dad asked, noticing my sudden stillness.

"Yeah, I'm fine," I managed to choke out, my voice barely above a whisper.

Trying to be subtle, I picked up that little red intruder with a napkin and dropped it onto a side plate, my hand trembling the entire time. 

No one in my family seemed to notice what was happening to me; they were too busy chatting away.

But I noticed, and a cold dread settled in my stomach, a feeling that had nothing to do with hunger.

The following week, Matt, wanting to be a good roommate, suggested we go out for burgers. 

"No strawberries, right?" he joked, clearly aware of my newfound aversion.

When we arrived at the burger joint, I ordered a classic cheeseburger and decided to add a salad for a touch of greenery. 

But the moment our order arrived, I spotted it: the largest slice of strawberry I had ever seen, sitting right in the middle of my salad's bed of lettuce. 

My stomach twisted, and my jaw clenched as I glanced at Matt, who was happily munching on his cheeseburger. It didn’t take long for him to finally notice the glaring strawberry on my plate. 

"Dude, what the heck? Are you kidding me? I told them not to put strawberries on your salad! Are they doing this on purpose?" he muttered, glancing back and forth between the strawberry and me.

"I have no idea," I replied, my voice heavy with despair as I pushed the salad aside. 

Before long, every day turned into a dreadful game of “find the strawberry.” 

My usual fruit cup, despite my insistence on no strawberries, always seemed to have a hidden stash of them at the bottom of the container. 

Whenever I ordered a cookie from a coffee shop, it would inevitably be a strawberry cheesecake-flavored cookie. 

I read in the newspaper about a new brand of sparkling water set to hit stores next month, and guess what? It was strawberry-flavored—always strawberry. 

Eventually, I began to withdraw from dining out altogether and started preparing all my meals at home. 

And when I did venture out for grocery shopping, my trips turned into lengthy excursions as I meticulously examined the labels of everything, checking the ingredients with an obsessive eye. 

My anxiety, which had always been a constant companion, morphed into an all-consuming, suffocating paranoia. 

Every night, I found myself trapped in the same haunting nightmare, swimming in an endless ocean of living strawberries. Their seeds seemed to glimmer like tiny, accusatory eyes, watching my every move.

The overwhelming sweetness of it all felt like it was pulling me under, and I'd wake up in a cold sweat, sitting upright in bed, heart racing, struggling to grasp what was happening to me. 

During the day, I began noticing those strawberry patterns everywhere, plastered on the wallpaper of every business I entered. The sight would make my mouth feel parched, as if the sun had scorched it dry.

I would see red traffic lights or the blush of a stranger's cheeks, and I couldn't shake the feeling that they were a sinister arrangement. Each flash of red, each round, dimpled shape sent a shock of dread coursing through me.

As time went on, both Matt and my family grew increasingly worried about my spiraling thoughts; they seemed more freaked out than I was. 

“Lucas, maybe you should consider talking to someone, like a therapist,” my mom suggested one day, her eyes filled with concern. 

“And tell them what exactly? That I’m being haunted by a fruit? That the universe is deliberately sneaking strawberries into my meals?” I scoffed, dismissing her concern.

But what was truly happening? Was I genuinely losing my grip on reality? Was this some elaborate prank being played by an unseen force? 

Or was it just my mind, traumatized and hyper-aware, fabricating patterns where none existed? Still, how could I rationalize the constant appearances of strawberries in my food, the uncanny coincidences?

Now, I found myself sitting in the dimly lit apartment, blinds drawn tight, with the lights flickering on. Matt had just ordered pizza and dashed off for a quick shower, leaving me on pizza watch.

We had opted for a classic combo: pepperoni, olives, and mushrooms—no strawberries in sight. I was trying to relearn to enjoy other red foods, but I still longed for a strawberry-free meal.

When the delivery driver finally arrived, I opened the door, paid him, and watched him walk away. With hesitant anticipation, I made my way to the kitchen and opened the pizza box.

Thank goodness the strawberries weren't on the pizza itself, but my relief was short-lived. Right in the center, the little plastic pizza table that keeps the box from touching the cheese was designed to look like a strawberry. What on earth was this? A cruel joke?

My heart raced, and my hands began to tremble. In a fit of frustration, I tossed the pizza box onto the kitchen counter, sending the pizza sliding and creating a gooey, cheesy mess.

I buried my face in my hands, a low, guttural sound escaping from deep within me.

The red plastic strawberry seemed to mock me, staring back from the scattered pepperoni.

What on earth is going on?



This might seem like a dumb story but this came from my brain and I'm dumb
