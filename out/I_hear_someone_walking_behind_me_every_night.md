I first heard it a week ago.

I was driving down a side street with the windows open. As I came up to the stop sign, I heard a sound from my right: *tap-tap-tap-tap.*

It sounded like footsteps.

I looked around. No one was on the sidewalk. At least not that I could see, from the light of my headlights. As I slowed for the stop sign, the *taps* decreased in frequency. Like they were slowing down with me.

When I came to a stop, the sound stopped. When I pulled out, it started again.

*Must be something with the car. Something with the motor or the muffler or something.*

But then, two days later when I went for a jog, I heard it. A distinct *slap-slap-slap* sound, coming from behind me.

At first, I thought it was just the beat of *Journey* through my earbuds. But when I yanked one out, I still heard it. *Slap-slap-slap.*

Coming from right behind me.

I glanced behind me. No one was there.

I stopped and wheeled around, looking for anything out of place. The footsteps stopped too.

I turned around and started jogging towards my car. The footsteps started back up. I broke into a sprint. The footsteps sped up with me.

I raced to my car and dove inside. After I was safely locked inside, I looked around. No one was there.

I stopped going for night runs after that.

My husband Dave agreed that it was weird. But he thought it must just be some random sound—maybe an animal or a structure settling or some machinery somewhere. He had a point, since where I was jogging wasn’t too far from where I’d been driving when I first heard the sound.

It was possible there was something off Main Street, a machine or generator or bird or animal, that was making the noise.

It didn’t explain why the sound kept time with me, but I tried to brush that under the rug in favor of a reasonable explanation.

But then, I heard it *in our house.*

Dave was at work. I work from home, so I was home alone. I was carrying a load of clean laundry upstairs when I heard it.

*Thump. Thump. Thump.*

It sounded like someone was climbing the stairs, just a few stairs below me.

I whirled around. No one was there. My heart began to pound. *Just the house settling,* I told myself, as I stood there frozen on the stairs.

I took another step up—

*Thump.*

I slowly glanced over my shoulder. Nothing. Took another step.

*Thump.*

I raced up the remaining stairs—

*Thumpthumpthumpthump—*

I made it to the top. I wheeled around and stared down at the stairs, panting, my heart pounding in my chest.

Nothing there.

I felt dizzy. Weak. Faint. I set the laundry down in the hallway and sat down on the bed. Then I lay down, pulling the covers up over me.

*There’s nothing there.*

I closed my eyes.

*Nothing there.*

I sighed. Pulled the blanket up to my neck. Adjusted the pillow. Rolled over to get comfortable—

*No.*

There was a rustling sound. Just like the one I had made—but a second delayed.

*Coming from under the bed.*

I lay there, my heart pounding, straining to listen for the slightest sound.

Nothing.

Arms shaking, I slowly pushed myself up from the bed.

*Rustle.*

I stopped. Froze in place. Stayed absolutely still. The seconds stretched into minutes as I forced myself to breathe slowly, to stay calm.

*No one’s there. It’s just your imagination.*

I steeled myself, staring at the door. Then, in one fluid motion, I swung my socked feet over the edge of the bed. Stood up. Sprinted to the door.

*Thumpthumpthump—*

I swung the door open and slammed it shut. I backed away, my ragged breathing echoing through the hallway. “It’s all in your head,” I whispered to myself. “It’s all in your head. It’s all in your—”

*THUMP.*

Something collided with the door. *Hard.*

I backed away, whimpering. Hand clasped over my mouth. *It can’t be. It can’t be.* The words popped in my head, whispered hushed in my mother’s voice, like she’d whispered them so many years ago. I thought it had only been a fairy tale. A way to scare us into being good.

*If you do something bad,* she’d whispered,

*It will follow you around like a shadow.*

*It will terrorize you relentlessly.*

*You will never be free.*

I backed away from the door, tears filling my eyes. *Thump, thump, thump.* I heard the muffled footsteps from inside the bedroom, mimicking my own.

Then it happened.

My foot landed on the first stair.

For a second, I lost my balance. My arms pinwheeled; I was freefalling, backwards, into the air. As the world spun and blurred around me, I saw something. A dark figure, standing at the top of the stairs. A silhouette.

My hand shot out and locked on the banister. When I looked up, it was gone.

I don’t know how long I stood there. Terrified to move. Terrified to take a step, and hear a *thump* behind me, as *it* followed me down the stairs.

The doorbell jerked me out of my thoughts.

I ran down the stairs. Footsteps pounded behind me, out of sync with my own. I swung the door open to find him there.

My neighbor, Brian.

He shot me a wolfish smile. “Hey, sexy—”

I slammed the door in his face.

Then I collapsed onto the floor, crying. Terrified to move.

Terrified to make a sound.
