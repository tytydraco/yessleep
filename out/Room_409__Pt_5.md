You’re still here.

Good.

Most people don’t make it this far.

They usually cannibalize themselves in grief.

Or…

The room consumes them whole.

But you are different.

You have been listening.

You have felt the walls breathing like I have.

There’s something I didn’t tell you before.

Something that you desperately need to know.

You’re not a prisoner to the room.

You’re a subject.

It studies you.

Every shiver.

Every pause.

Every secret in the darkest crevices of your mind.

It can and will get inside you.

Once it knows you inside and out…it opens a door.

A door to the very things that terrify you to your core.

Mine is waiting.

And I think she’s on the other side.

———————

The key felt impossibly heavy — like it had carried a thousand lifetimes before it ever touched my palm.

It burned in my grip, like it didn’t want to be held.

I turned it over in my hand, and there—etched into its side beneath layers of grime and age—was her name.

EMILY.

It was a name, an invocation, and a reckoning all at once.

A crescendo to the nightmare I had wandered through longer than time could measure.

And there it was — the door.

It was the same sea-glass green one from earlier.

Always there. Always unreliable—like a broken record.

The key pulsated like a throbbing heart as I stepped through the door.

This time, the lies of the room collapsed.

There was no peeling wallpaper, no dusty warmth, no illusions of comfort…just a blanket of darkness.

And then the unmistakable and heartbreaking sound of a flatline.

One sharp, endless, mechanical screech piercing the air.

The hollow scream dripping in emotional turmoil that followed wasn’t hers.

It was mine…

_______________________

I blinked—

And I found myself back in the room. 

Tranquility.

The kind that silences instead of calms.

The key that once scalded my hand was nowhere to be found.

Its outline was singed into my hand faintly, like a haunting reminder of what I was supposed to be carrying.

The journal lay open on the nightstand, waiting like a flower before dawn. One line covered the page in jagged scrawl:

“The room can end. But will you let it?”

I walked through the unsettling quiet that plagued my surroundings.

Everything was preserved like a museum: the bed made, the windows sealed, the air too still to breathe.

On the dresser rested Claire’s wedding ring. An unmistakable relic of a bygone relationship.

On the table, Emily’s last crayon drawing. Reds, blues, purples — a child’s joy and creativity preserved on paper.

A faint sound—beep, beep—

A heart monitor’s cold, rhythmic thumping echoing in the immaculate silence.

The sterile scent of a hospital room, sharp and faint in memory.

A nurse’s hand rested on my shoulder—gentle, unyielding.

I swallowed hard as I acknowledged the events transpiring before me.

I wasn’t strong enough to wait.

I wanted the pain to end—for all of us.

The machines. The noise. The waiting. It broke something in me.

I touched the drawing, fingers trembling with trepidation.

I was holding her hand as Claire sobbed beside me, tears streaming down her face.

The doctor asked, and I said—

The memory fractured and distorted like film burning, eventually trailing off into nothing.

I wanted it to stop.

To finally end.

This place wasn’t haunting me.

It was remembering for me.

_______________________

That’s when a new door appeared before me.

This one wasn’t green, nor was it scorched.

It was mirrored.

It didn’t reflect the room however, it reflected me.

The journal was open again with a new sentence brandishing its page.

“The final room is the one you made for yourself.”

I stepped through and found myself in the middle of a filing room.

Drawers lined the walls—endless, relentless. Each one labeled with a date:

“Day 17 — “Smiled back at a stranger.”

“Day 92 — “Forgot her laugh.”

“Day 114 — “Said ‘I’m okay’ and meant it.”

Day 251 — “Told Claire I dreamed of her, but it was only static.”

“Day 413 — “Said her name and didn’t cry.”

These weren’t just memories…

These were records of my lies.

The photographs on the walls were of my family. From a future that never got to exist. 

They were decomposing…dripping. 

Melting like sugar in rain.

And the audio that pervaded throughout...it was my voice.

Splices of therapy sessions, police reports, and apologies all forming a cacophony of guilt and uncertainty.

“You said you forgave yourself. But all you did was silence the guilt.” A version of my own voice, colder, unfeeling, whispered in my ear.

I screamed in fright and turned around, and that’s when I saw him.

The boy sitting on the bed earlier...

Me.

He sat curled in the corner, his face buried in his arms as he was crying.

“She waited so long,” he whimpered. “And now she’s gone.”

He looked up, his eyes glassy and sorrowful.

“Please… don’t forget her again.” His pleading voice broke. “I don’t want to disappear.”

Then Claire appeared from the darkness beside him.

This wasn’t the soft Claire that I knew.

This was the one who never got to bury Emily properly.

“I needed you.” she said, desolation painting every word. “You were playing detective in your head. Solving a crime that didn’t exist. Making me a widow to your grief.”

Her face glitched like a poorly rendered animation between wedding photos, nightmares, and hallucinations.

All the wrongs I ever put her through were manifesting themselves before me in a way that was both heartbreaking and frightening. 

“You didn’t give her a choice.”

“You left me in that room.”

“You gave up the pain… and left it all with me.”

I tried to speak but the words were lodged in my throat.

Trapped in vain.

But she and the boy were already fading.

Every version of them disappearing by means of unraveled static.

I stood there, gutted and alone. My hands shaking with all the apologies I never gave.

A second journal took their place.

It opened to the first blank page. In a new hand, words revealed themselves on the page:

“Write the real story. Not the one you told yourself.”

As I finished reading the words, the filing room flickered like a bulb choking on its own electricity.

Each detail of the room changing between the brief moments of darkness and light.

My eyelids nictated to the rhythm of the strobing lights to reveal…

Room 409.

I had returned to the place where it always begins.

My eyes immediately noticed the VHS tape that sat by the bed.

There was no label or any indication as to what it could be.

I knew better than to go against the wishes of the room.

I grabbed the tape and slid it into the VCR.

The screen sputtered to life in a wash of white noise and for once, it didn’t try to distort me.

As the video played, I heard my voice come through. 

But this time—

No spliced audio. No stitched narration.

It was only me.

“The detective believes he’s solving a crime…” I paused before continuing, “But what he’s really doing is trying to forgive himself.”

The tape cut to the Lotus Hotel with Brenner in frame.

But I wasn’t investigating, not anymore.

“I came back because I thought I needed answers,” I said. “But what I needed… was to feel it.”

I left the tape playing and walked to the next door, the audio becoming background noise as the sound of my footsteps seemed to amplify.

This one wasn’t sea glass green or mirrored.

It was unmarked, unadorned.

Just a note taped in the center.

Written in red crayon in a childlike manner on a piece of notebook paper was the sentence:

“Your daughter is on the other side, but she’s not waiting.”

“Not waiting… Because she’s gone? Or because I made her wait too long?” I asked aloud as I placed my hand on the handle.

I had spent so long trying to decode a puzzle. But maybe this was never about solving anything—it was about accepting what couldn’t be undone.

The only thing louder than that thought in my mind was the thundering sound of my heart against my ribcage.

“I don’t know if this is truth or oblivion. But it’s forward. It’s toward her.”
