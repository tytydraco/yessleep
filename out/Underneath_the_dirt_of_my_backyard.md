I moved into my house about four months ago,
finally having settled in completely. I had all
boxes dumped, shelves and bed frames
assembled, and finished with two orders of brand new unwrapped furniture that brought the living room and basement to life.
It’s a decent sized three-bedroom house that
only me and my husky occupy for now. I would say to her “We’re manifesting a family Bree. This is all for them, nice and ready to go.”

I am 27 years old with a good job and credit score that was pre-built by the foresight of my father when I was 21. I had nothing to complain about nothing and nothing to feel sad about. But the emptiness of the house hung on me. 
I knew it wouldn’t be a complete until I had the family I dreamed of.

To ensure everything stayed intact when I left
the house for work I put Bree in the
backyard. It was comfortable for her, with a little doggie house and toys scattered across the yard. Hopefully that would keep her from getting bored by herself and  bothering the neighbors. Yet everyday, I came home from work to her she sitting almost directly center in the backyard, unmoving, her toys virtually untouched. I was unnerved, yet maybe there was a simple explanation. Maybe she simply was putting the toys back in the same area each time. 

One day I returned home late to her staring directly at me through the sliding glass door, unblinking, as if she knew I would arrive soon. 

“ Come on Bree, snacks. We can watch  episodes of twilight zone until I’m asleep” I said, opening the door. 

But Bree didn’t budge from her spot. I watched as a she rotated her head in a diagonal motion, gave me a low groan and lay down with her paws placed in front of her. On her face was a look of tiredness, maybe? Sadness? I couldn’t quite place it as I walked towards her.

“What’s wrong?” “Your stomachs hurting from
too much food or what girl?” I rubbed her head
and she stretched out on her side, still situated in the center of the backyard.

“You can’t stay out here all day, Bree.”

I picked her up and carried her towards
the sliding door. She glanced up at me for a
moment before returning to her state of inactivity.

“Don’t be lazy, Bree.”

I put her down inside and she finally moved, shuffling off for a drink. Food ready, I turned the tv on and patted the couch for Bree to come. She looked out the sliding glass door for a moment before making her way to me. Instead of her hopping up on the couch as usual, she aggressively nudged my
leg with an even louder groan and jogged
back around to the sliding door, pawing at the bottom.

“Bree, what’s has gotten into you? Come here and sit down now, you’ve had plenty of time to play outside today.” 

Finally ambling over, she sat and we watched the twilight zone until we both fell asleep.

In the morning I woke up on the couch to tv
static from the finished tape recording. Bree was up already staring through the glass door. I was completely weirded out at this point, but 
work was in 45 minutes. I gave up and let her back. 

“you really like that backyard don’t you?” 

She ran out into the yard and started running in circles over and over again. I let her be and went to the bathroom to shower before work.

The shower was long, but by the time I came back out I felt refreshed and ready for a new day. I went to go say goodbye to Bree and was welcomed by a disaster. Holes dug up in the ground all across the backyard. I clenched my teeth and analyzed them one by one, infuriated.

“Bree….” 

This was so unlike her, and was gonna make my day longer than I wanted it to be.

“Why did you do this?” 

As I let out a very long sigh, I noticed
that there was one hole much bigger than the
others, almost three times as wide as the next largest. Bree was running around in circles as if she hadn’t just cost me a hours of labor.
I wiped the sweat off my forehead and thought
for a minute, breathing in and out slowly
to calm myself down. Bree finally noticed me
and halted the circling. She jumped over to the
large hole and stood behind it, barking and
howling loudly.

“Bree be quiet, you’ll disturb the
neighbors.” 

She didn’t stop, so I walked over
impatiently towards the hole she was standing
behind, trying to ignore her obnoxiously loud 
howls. I finally reached the edge of the hole, and peered down to the bottom. My heart sank in disbelief. Inside the hole was a small rusted copper knob and a slight view of metal behind it. 

Bree’s howling suddenly sent a chill down my spine, and my feet felt glued to the ground. I knew the layout of this property from top to
bottom and there wasn’t supposed to be anything under this house besides the basement. Finally wrenching my feet from the spot, I rushed to the house to call off of work, making up a story about my dog falling extremely ill and needing to be taken to the vet. They accepted my story without question.  I went inside my garage to grab a shovel and began digging.
