I work at a construction company and we are renovating this old monastery into a library. The last of the monks decided to sell the building for money and the state of Tennessee bought it to make it a heritage site. There is still going to be a library and in addition to adding a bunch of books they are keeping all the ones that were originally here. While renovating the building we found a secret room! And guess what was in it? More books! I even found a journal from Sean. After reading it I found this part particularly fascinating and wanted to share it.


I hated living in New Brunswick. I was 18, it was 2012.

After I graduated high school my parents insisted that I go to college. They were paying for it and I didn't know what else to do. I had a part time job and hardly went to school. I was sick of it.

Some days instead of going to school Id head to my friends drug den. They were lower class working people and they like there drugs. My parents wouldn't tolerate weed in the house and I always went over there to smoke it.

One day I was sitting there on the couch bong in hand listening to Kyle and Justin bickering like old women when all of a sudden I felt present and clear, like I had not in a long time.

I looked around the room at the unfinished basement I was in, and then too the TV screen.

Kyle and Justin lived here, and revolving door of friends always showed up. IT was them, me and Kyle's brother Brandon.

On the TV screen was Pink floy'd s the wall. An odd movie, but a favorite here.

"This is fucking gay, where the hell is our acid?" Brandon chirped. "I'm as sober as a nun watching the wall, and I'm not pleased, Kyle."

Kyle sat there live a caveman trying to think of a response, then instead slapped him in the groin.

Brandon fell down in pain, and Kyle laughed.

Justin was a hermaphrodite and was assigned male at birth. He looked around the room and let out and awful scream.

"They made the wrong choice!" He screamed at the top of his lungs.

The gay guys upstairs heard the commotion and came down with our acid. I wondered if they had been holding out on us.

I just felt the acid start to kick in as the trial started at the end of the movie.

I had never been more scared in my life then when the judge started singing. Such an odd movie, I couldn't believe how captivated and alone together we all were.

After the movie was over I watched the walls ebb and flow. This was weird. I was so glad I only took one tab of acid.

Around the time the acid peaked we were all having a good time, actually talking and not watching the wall anymore. After a pretty good hour we all crashed.

I puked in the toilet, Justin and Kyle puked on the floor and Brandon puked on himself.

It was horrible and I couldn't believe how they all talked about it like some heavenly experience afterwards.

Another day that I was jigging college I went over there and they had a salvia pipe.

"This is how you see other worlds man. When Chris tried this stuff he saw the turtleverse! Why don't you try a mans drug like salvia." Kyle said.

"When's our DOB getting here?" Brandon said. "That acid was some pussy shit. We should get DMT next time. That's the working mans drug, you can do it on your coffee break."

Kyle handed me the pipe and I took a huge rip.

Within a couple of seconds a portal opened up to where I had lived before I moved to New Brunswick.

I starred though the portal for a couple of seconds and then got up off the couch and walked through it.

I was back on the street where I had lived before I moved for grade 1. I looked around in utter disbelief at how everything was exactly like I remembered it.

I walked down the street to my old house and stood looking at it from the street. All of a sudden a dead rotting corpse looked at me from the window.

I thought for a second I recognized it as my aunt Die.

Just then the door open and my father and uncles came running after me. They were all dead and rotting.

I ran down the street as they chased after me. I turned a corner and a giant t rex came barging from the other way, tramping the zombies and chasing after me.

"I have you now! This will be the symbolic death!" IT cheered.

I ran down the street as it chased after me, taunting me every step of the way.

I could hear his massive footsteps and taunts getting closer and closer.

"Food for the trapped god!" he screamed.

I ran in through an  open door and into a house.

I stood in the living room, just hoping the T rex would go away when I saw an ogre with red skin and dragon teeth outside the window.

"Is anyone in here he said?" looking around the room frantically.

I ran up the stairs into my old bedroom and saw a cyborg tied to the bed, with dopey expression on his face.

A spinning gun on his arm discharged into the wall and I ran back down the stairs.

WhenI returned to the living room the ogre was still there. He looked through the glass door frantically.

"IS anyone here?" he asked.

I went back to the front door and looked down the t rexs open mouth. His throat looked like a sarlac pit and I turned around and went back to the living room.

This time the ogre had opened the glass door and was inside.

"Is anyone in here?" he said, looking around frantically.

"I am" I said weekly.

"AHA!" he yelled and smiled an evil grin. He starred at me for a second before being blasted from behind.

He fell face down and an angel woman stood looking at me, holding a laser gun.

"My love, this is Saren's playground, we must get you out of here before it's too late!" she screamed, obviously furious.

She led me outside and grabbed me and then we took off and flew.

We flew as fast as an airplane and I heard the loud rushing of wind until everything went silent.

When we went subsonic we landed in a green field. She sat there looking at me adoringly and said.

"Now this can be your happy place"  with love in her eyes.

I sat there for a minute looking at her. I was about to ask her who she was when all of sudden I was back on the couch.

I could not believe how weird and wigged out I felt.

Everyone kept asking me what I saw and I just lied and said that I didn't go through the portal.

I sat there on the couch for almost an hour wondering if what I had seen was real or just a drug hallucination. After a while I was made re-aware of my surroundings by the happy cry of Justin.

"IT's here! IT's here!" he screamed like a child.

Kyle and Justin had bought DOB on the dark web and were planning to watch the wall with me and Brandon.

"24 hour peak man! We will be high for days!" Brandon said.

"We might be high forever boys, I hear that's how this stuff works!" Justin cackled.

I somehow came to my senses after the salvia trip and was out of there before they started.

A few weeks later I was at my part time job over the Christmas holidays. I cleaned a pool and since there was no one here there was not much cleaning to be done. 

We were working hard at the start of the day, but the last 2 hours of my shifts were so lax. Since there was no one around to talk to besides my boss I decided to watch a movie on my laptop in the break-room.

I for some reason decided to watch death and rebirth, the last part of the Evangelion franchise that I had not seen yet.

I sat through it, but it was the most mind numbing and disturbing thing ever. Around the midway point there was an actual scene in the movie and it was ok, but it was the eye of the storm. The second half of the movie fucked with my head and I started to understand why people called this movie mind rape. And why the creator hates his fans. That was the thought that went through my head as an image went onscreen.

I recognized it immediately as the dummy plug Eva from the end of evangelion. I just starred at me and gave me a friendly energy.

I heard laughing in my head, and it said 'Just watch this one more time kid, it's so great once you get it'

The credits rolled and I swore I'd never watch that show again. I left work with an uneasy feeling.

I headed over to the brocean, what the Kyle and Justin liked to call their unfinished basement. They said to come over because it was time to prepare for the 3 days of darkness. The myans allegedly said the world would end tomorrow on the 21st, and that was how it would begin.

Once I arrived I inspected their preparations. Justin had 2 50 gallons jugs filled with water, tons of canned food, an axe and a machete along with a propane grill and multiple propane tanks.

"This should do you longer than 3 days man." I said looking around.

Justin sharpened the machete and looked at me with death in his eyes.

"Once the sun doesn't come up I want to be the first person to taste the long pig" he said with a grin.

"We should get Dakota to come with us on a hunting trip and shoot him" Brandon said with a cackle.

We were supposed to wait till morning for the sun to not come up but everyone fell asleep. The next day seemed just like the last.

I sat around in the dreary basement and head a voice in my head.

'Stay here for 3 days and your friends will show you god.' I heard a voice in my head.

I thought about the voice and stayed down there for the rest of the morning, but at noon I heard another voice, a woman's.

'They will use you as a ritual sacrifice if you stay here that long, they are planning to cause the 3 days of darkness, by sacrificing you.

I looked around the room. Kyle sat there sharpening an axe while Brandon typed away on his phone. Justin was nowhere to be seen.

My mind raced and I realized there was only one door out of here. Justin could block it. I quickly grabbed my things and ran for the door.

Once I was outside I saw Justin standing beside a firepit full of tinder. He threw a match on it and it burst into flames, obviously soaked in gasoline.

I heard the gay man upstairs yell "The coke's here guys!"

I ran for the driveway and saw the friendly neighborhood cat looking at me.

'Never return I heard' I heard a voice say.

All of a sudden a large wasp stung my arm, really digging it's stinger in. I killed it and drove my moms car home.

When I got home she looked at me with an awful scowl. "I said to god, never give my child my eyes."


I remembered when she had told me that she could only see one pin when bowling without glasses. I had thankfully not gotten her eyes.



I went down to my room in the basement and sat at my computer. I went on facebook and saw a friend request from someone I thought I already had. It was Wilbur Wheatly.

I clicked on the page and couldn't believe what I saw. Wilbur was standing the giving  double thumbs up, and behind him was a man with black skin and dragon teeth.

I then got a second request from Arik.

I looked at the account and it was like a tombstone. He was missing and never found.

'Don't let him get you!' I heard a female voice in my head say.


I messaged Wilbur after I added him and asked him "What happened to Arik?"


He said, "I don't know, what happened to 7?" his new dog.
