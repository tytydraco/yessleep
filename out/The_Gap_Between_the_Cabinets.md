My parents are deceased, and have been for a long while. It’s been nearly three decades. Yet, the scene is burned into my eyes, and the noise never leaves. I was around ten at the time, we’d lived in a small apartment complex on the edge of town, right by the entrance to the freeway where constantly in the middle of night whatever good sleep I’d find would be disrupted by the trembling horns of Diesels. 

One day, March 14th, 1999, they’d each leave for a visit to see my grandma. She was a sweet old lady, though demented and stuck in a nursing home. She always swore she’d get out soon, and then she’d repeat it again. To get there quicker though, for my mom had packed a treat for her; some leftovers from last-nights dinner, they’d take the freeway. I watched personally out of a feeling of protecting them, like my gaze had any effect on their safety, but as they went off the entrance ramp and entered, a freak accident occurred. One Diesel in the opposite lane would lose control and swerve, heading towards another Diesel who in response, turned sharply right. Right onto them.

There wasn’t much to see. Only a few hours later, night had come and looking down from the balcony, my stare finally broken, I saw a single officer accompanying a lady dressed formally. She seemed nice. Soon, they’d knock on my door and I walked down to it, standing in front, my breathing getting harder the more my hand squeezed on the knob—but I couldn’t? Why, I didn’t want to admit at the time, but I was fearful. Who were these strange people and why are they at my door? *A lady and an officer, that’s a strange mix*, I thought. *Could they be trying to arrest me?* 

I decided, foolishly yes I know, that they were. So, I never answered. Not there, or even the next day when they’d unlock the door themselves. 

After that, I’d only reminisce in the house for some time. A lot of time, actually. For the rest of my day, I’d only walk back and forth between all of the rooms; my own, my parents, the living room, the kitchen, the bathroom even. Each of them held something of my parents. A memory, a fragment. In the living room I’d see my fathers boots, he was a classic blue-collar man, a construction worker and a journeyman at that. I felt proud of him, to me, despite how tired he appeared at times, the love he showed for my mother masked the wrinkles on his eyes. 

In the bathroom, I’d see the various amounts of towels and bottles we didn’t need but still my mother bought. She was caring to such a point that it circled back to being a slight hoarder—but, I didn’t mind much. For in my mind now, she wanted to give us more than just enough, she wanted to give us everything. Despite it being a bit much. 

I’d slept in the hall that night. There, I felt closer to all of them, though I regretted it for in the morning my eyes were groggy and my back sore from the hardwood, and unknowing of the “break-in” about to happen in a few hours by the Social worker and her buddy, I rummaged around the kitchen. I’d dig in the fridge, take what few snacks I could find, and grumble when I realized the leftovers were gone, then cry when remembering why. On the counter though, I sat and was messing with the microwave, staring at it’s light as a bundle of cold-nuggets were heating up but as I did, something caught my eye. 

In the corner of the cabinets, was a space I’ve never noticed before. It was a gap, pinned in the corner between two opposing rows and emanating a sort of, pull. *What are you*, I remember wondering, etching closer to it. I’d try sticking my head in there to look, first tucking it in until sliding and letting it back out. I saw nothing. Not black, nothing, it scared me—I couldn’t understand it! It was like closing one eye while the others open, you don’t even see the lid of your eyes—there’s nothing!

I jumped back, smacking my head on the wood then tucking it back as I wiggled out until being scared again by the microwave’s beeping. Five times it’d go on, while I laid on the floor, rubbing at my head. My curiosity though, was stoked, and I couldn’t let it go unanswered, so I ignored my food and jumped atop the counter, and once-more tucked my body tight, and squeezed, slithered even, back into the gap. Nothing. I couldn’t see anything, and though at first it was scary, new and unwelcoming, it started to become peaceful after a few passing seconds. 

Reaching up, I even noticed that there was far more space than I thought before, I could even stand, though still it felt as tight as ever. My arms barely at an elbows length. 

I liked it here, but I didn’t wanna stay so I crouched and began trying to slide out again, but something was blocking me. There was a wall. *No, I must’ve turned on accident*, I thought. But, no! I kept moving around in a circle, kicking my feet at the only space in front of me, but nothing worked. There was a wall not there before, all around me. And, already standing awkwardly with my legs pushed against the wall in front of me, and back to the one behind me, I tried standing normally, letting out one foot but below me, I felt only air. The gap had transformed into some sort of tunnel, it puzzled me, and now the peace I was filling quickly turned to dread and I screamed, over and over again, but nothing. Nothing, nothing! 

My throat ached, and the wall felt too strong to kick, and apparently too thick for my voice to travel through so I stood there, trying to think of something, something rational for such an irrational situation. *Up, I could go up. It has to be a chimney?*, I thought. So, I pushed back and forward harder, and with no sight, began to climb up. It’d hurt somewhat, the back of my shirt scraping against the wooden splinters, and some of them catching onto my scalp or neck. Though, still I persisted. 

More up, I began to hear what seemed as the slow rushing of water in pipes, rats feet gently stomping as if a horde, and the usual arguing between the neighbors. They’d always bicker. And I always hated it. Still, I needed whatever help I could get and screamed as loud as I could, but I received no response, not even after kicking against the wall for some time. Unfortunately, it was a waste, and so I kept going more up, listening to the melody of their speaker. It seemed broken, the words and even the music going slower than expected for what seemed to be such an upbeat song. Even their voices seemed slower, but at the time, that was the least of my worries, and I wanted out and for me, that was more upwards.

I felt as if I was out of the apartments now, it was only two-stories so it didn’t take much long expectedly but still I saw nothing. Not even a glimmer of light or shade of dark. But, I did feel a cold breeze, which made me wonder, *how does wind get through here, there has to be some hole*, but the more I felt around, there wasn’t any. So, I went on and began to hear the drawn out squawking of birds nearby.

I really wished I had brought a sweater. The more time went on, or I thought it did, and the more I climbed, goosebumps would riddle over my body and my teeth jittered. It was so cold, I hated it, but suddenly a bone was thrown at me, a slight piece of warmth as I inched closer. I heard a swarm of birds fly around what I presumed was some insanely overbuilt chimney, which made me begin to wonder how I never saw it before if it was so tall. Little did I know. 

After some more time of climbing, the warmth would get closer. I felt nearly there, I just had to climb some few more steps—Toom! An airplane, I could’ve sworn I not only heard but felt it slowly passed by me, shaking the whole tunnel and causing me to jump up. Nearly falling, but not yet. My back felt more splintered than before, but I was safer, and kept climbing. Though, I couldn’t help but wonder, *how high up do I have to be to hear planes*? 

At some point, the space would start to tighten, going from an elbows length to half of that and I went from climbing, to wiggling upwards. I hated the splinters, I hated them in my hair, but the warmth, it was calling me and I was nearly there, I didn’t want to give up now so I persevered for in my mind there were only two choices; up, meaning away from the cold and potentially out, or down, meaning the unknown and maybe even death. I doubted I’d survive such a fall from where I was now, though I was unknowing at the time, a young boy attempting his best to think rationally in such an irrational situation. 

At last, I’d reached what I thought to be the top and my sight went from nothing, to oncemore, something! I saw a great blue, never-ending sky that seemed to span as far as the whole universe, its own galaxy filled with large dots of clouds at unforeseen distances away from me. The floor itself seemed to be a cloud too, or something similar, and I began to grasp onto it, my hands reaching out of the tunnel, each muscle tightening in my small frame, and trying to get out. But, I was stopped. They gently lifted my hands back, set myself neatly into the tunnel, and started to walk away. 

“Don’t leave!” I screamed, but they continued. My own parents were leaving me, and they weren’t looking back, I had to force them to reconsider, to look, speak to me one more time so I climbed up again, quicker this time, my arm nearly setting onto the clouds but once again, they stopped me.

Their voices went in union. 

“You’re not ready.” *Lies, you’re lying to me!*, I thought and kept climbing. They were there, and I couldn’t lose them again, if my eyes meant nothing let my hands mean so instead, and I gripped onto the cloudy material, my torso now resting on it and though they attempted to reason, I cared for none of it. 

A voice below, not in union like those atop, but going over another as if scrambling for dominance. It sounded like my parents again. They were calling for me, begging me to come to them but it felt strange, it didn’t seem like them and before I could even think about what was happening, them being above and below—a great rumble would come—shaking the tunnel so violently I slid downwards. Like a bullet I went, my sight gone again yet hearing a choir of worry cries from above, until quickly being smothered out by the loud shrieking and rambling below. 

The fall was nearly as long as the climb. My stomach would twist and turn as I went, speeding up the lower I got and at some point, I’d realize in my little mind, *what if I go splat?* So, down I went; passed the plane again, somehow still there, the neighbors bickering, their words more drawn out, and then even my own apartment, it’s doorbell ringing and the pitch holding in place, and knowing I couldn’t risk going no further, I’d kick my legs out and throw my back to the wall. It’d hurt. It’d hurt a lot, and the splinters would go from poking into my skin, to being nearly integrated. As if one bloody, disgusting and horrible to touch or move, mess. 

It was hot, not cold like the middle and where it all began, or even warm and welcoming like the top—it burned down here. And I felt the sweat trickle down my back, engulfing the wounds all over it. 

For some time, I’d ignore the words of those below and only holler in pain. After the shock had worn off though, I’d look downwards and see them. Them. I use this word deliberately for they were not my parents, they were some caricature of them. An insult onto their lives of which they lived fully. 

At once they’d speak, their rambling which was first fighting over another to sound louder, more directed at me, became hush. 

“We miss you, I love you—” 

“I love you more than anything, come to us!” The imitation of my mother said, interrupting my father. Though I felt their words to be dubious, I still couldn’t help but scoot lower, ignoring all the pain and welcoming the heat which overcomed my senses, began to even cloud my thoughts. I felt, welcomed? And, I began to succumb and nearly I was within arms reach of them, their own universe appearing to be that of rocks and burning lights that sparked randomly, my foot dangling into it and their hands reaching for it. But, looking at my foot, I realized it was twisted, facing the opposite direction of where it should. It hurted. No, it was unbearable! Looking closer at them, they were unbearable, their clinginess a reflection of my own, and their hands snapping as they reached for my foot, trying to drag me with them. 

So, I climbed away. Quickly I went into the nothingness of the tunnel, my good foot and my back, pushing me upwards as fast as they could while behind me, I heard their rambling pleas transform smoothly into curses and remarks, demanding for me to come back. Their voices would quiet suddenly, but still I persisted for I knew them to still be giving chase, their stomps and clawing into the tunnel, vibrating onto me. 

At last, I realized I was in my apartment, the same original spot of where I entered, and the same doorbell from before was still slowly ringing. And, with quick succession and no time to waste, I started to push at the wall with my foot but it wasn’t enough! I needed to kick it, but only one foot was holding me up while the other dangled. *The dangled foot*, I thought. And, tensing myself for the pain then biting down onto my own teeth, I’d stand on the broken foot, crying out loud in pain as I kicked against the wall. The stomping and clawing below getting closer, my back feeling itched by the vibrations yet torn by the splinters, until finally—I fell out. 

For nearly a minute, I’d only lay down staring at the ceiling light, it’s cover a dome, while I catched my breath. Though, at some point the ringing of the doorbell annoyed me enough that I stood, and began to check myself for any wounds until realizing, I could stand completely normal. And, even more-so, everything was gone. Not just the cuts and blisters on my body, no, everything. I checked the counter, the nuggets still in the microwave and then I checked the gap. It was nothing more than just a gap. I even grabbed a spatula, and drew my hand into there, poking it upwards until being stopped by some piece of wood only two-feet high. 

Everything was gone. Yet, I remembered it all so vividly; the words, the nothingness of which I’ve never experienced before, the sensations of having a broken limb of which I’d only feel again five years past that day—everything, I remembered. The Social Worker and her buddy, as said before, would eventually seize me and take me to a foster home of which I grew up in for the next eight years until being released. It wasn’t a good time there. I’d constantly bounce between homes never feeling a connection between any of them, or being there long enough to even begin one, but still, I came out mostly alright. 

I’m Thirty-Six years old, married with a single kid of my own, and I’m doing well as a plumber. It’s fun work, and ever since then I’ve been naturally inclined with working in cramped places, especially dark ones. Though, to this very day, I come up with a wide amount of ideas that could explain what happened, my most reasonable; maybe it was some form of vivid illusion from the shock? I was alone, and of course traumatized from witnessing such an event—yet still, I can’t get out the gut-feeling that it was all real. I felt everything. I remembered everything. It was too vivid to be just an illusion, but maybe that’s what every insane man or woman says.

If it’s true or not though, whatever happened in that gap between the cabinet had an impact at least on my mind. I was able to let go of my grief quicker than most. And now, I know firmly that wherever my parents are, that when my time comes I’ll let it find me, not me, it.
