I'd always been curious about the boarded up house at the end of our street. It had been there ever since I was born, and I'd always been warned to stay away from it. But I was always a curious kid. So when Chris, the neighborhood rich kid, suggested we all go explore it, I said yes.

***

"Oh come on," Chris said, nudging the rickety old boarded up door with his foot. "Nobody lives here anyway. Who's gonna care?"

"It's still owned by the McCaffery family," Tina added. "Technically it would still be trespassing-"

"Oh shut up, would you?" Chris snapped. "You're such a spoilsport, Tina."

I pushed my way forward, a concerned look on my face. My parents had told me to stay as far away as possible from this house, since it likely had mold and rusty nails and broken floorboards which would put me in the hospital.

Chris shook his head and planted the hammer in between the boards, tugging hard until they popped loose one by one. We all slowly walked in one by one: Chris, Tina, me, Johnny, Maria, and Cade.

The inside was just about what I expected. Dark, wet from the rain from last night with a few cobwebs scattered here and there. The moonlight managed to filter in slightly, casting an eerie glow on parts of the rotten floorboard.

"This is so gross," Maria complained, huddling between Cade and Tina. 

"Quit whining," Chris said. "Rumors say that old man McCaffery hid the body of his ex-wife in the basement of this house. Wonder if it's still here..."

"Oh please," Johnny scoffed, nudging me with a smirk on his face. "Garrett McCaffery doesn't have a single murderous bone in his body. I met him with my dad once."

I turned and looked at my surroundings. I couldn't believe I'd let Chris talk him into this. It was late, I was cold, and I wanted to go home. But no, Chris got was Chris wanted. His dad was a rich lawyer and his mom was a doctor so he basically got whatever he desired all the time. I had gathered a while ago that Chris was a bit of an adrenaline junkie. His parents never paid attention to him he filled his time by doing stupid shit and getting a thrill out of it. It was annoying, but I wanted to fit in so I went along with it.

"Chris, there's nothing here," Cade complained. "You just made us break into a house for nothing."

"Shut up," Chris said. "We haven't even gone to any other rooms yet."

Johnny and Cade followed Chris into the next room, disappearing into what I assumed was the kitchen. That left him in the main room with Tina and Maria. I sighed as I kicked a few stray boards around. 

"This is stupid," Tina said, looking around with an uncomfortable expression. "Why do we always let him drag us into this?"

"Whatever," Maria said angrily. "Screw this, I'm outta here."

Maria stomped over to the door and swung it back open. She gasped.

"What the..." she began.

"What?" I asked, walking over. What I saw made my blood run cold. Instead of the same grass-covered lawn split by a cracked walkway from before, it was instead blocked off by a solid brick wall.

"What's going on?" Maria said, pushing against the wall that had appeared behind the front door. "How is this...what..."

"What is it?" Tina asked, confused.

"Chris!" I yelled. "Johnny! Cade! Guys, come here!"

I expected to hear their frantic footsteps running back from the kitchen, but instead there was silence. I frowned.

"Chris?" I called. "Guys, this isn't funny. Come in here."

Nothing.

I looked at the girls with concern before I walked over to the kitchen. The floorboards creaked and groaned under my feet, the sounds amplified by my anxiety. What was he going to see? Were they hurt? Dead? What was going on?

I turned the corner into the dimly lit kitchen to find nobody there. The countertop was empty, save a few cracks and a layer of dust. The three other boys were nowhere to be found.

"Brock?" Tina called from the living room. "What's going on?"

"Chris?" I called again, starting to get angry. "Chris, I know you can hear me, you jerk! You're not funny!"

Still nothing. There was a dark hallway past the kitchen that I couldn't see through. Should I check there?

"Chris?" I called, stepping into the kitchen. Before I could walk any further, the floor seemed to give way. Before I could even scream, I was falling as the rotten wood of the floor crumbled beneath me. I gasped as I kept falling for a few more moments before I seemed to land on something soft.

"What the heck?!" I cried.

"Brock?" Tina called from above. She was using the flashlight on her phone to gaze down the hole that had opened in the floor. "Are you okay?"

"Yeah, I'm fine!" I called. "Can you call my parents? Or some adult? Please?"

"Maria's calling her folks now! Can you see your phone?" Tina called. "Turn the flash on!"

I snatched my phone and struggled to turn on the flashlight with trembling hands. I was going to beat the crap out of Chris when I got out of this. After a few seconds of struggling, I finally managed to turn the flashlight on and shined it in front of me. I frowned at what I saw.

I'd landed on a mound of dirt in the middle of a floor of dirt under the floorboards. In the very middle of the room was a circle drawn in the ground with a strange symbol engraved in the middle of it. It looked like a cow's skull...odd.

"What...?" I muttered to myself. I started to walk closer when a sound behind me made me spin around. It sounded like someone...gasping. As if they were reaching for air after being underwater for several minutes.

"Chris? Cade?" I whispered. "Johnny? You there?"

I started trembling with fear. I didn't know what do do. I was cold, I was tired, I was scared, and I wanted to go home.

My heart started to pound. This was bad. It had to be a prank right? It was another one of Chris's stupid jokes and everyone else was in on it...

But I knew that wasn't true. Something about this place...it was wrong. I knew I shouldn't be here. I'd known that before-obviously, since we were trespassing-but this was different. It was like something was watching me and judging me. And it wanted me out.

I frantically tried to jump up back through the opening, but it was no use. It was too far, and I wasn't athletic enough to make that jump, much less pull myself up through the fragile flooring. I was stuck down here with that strange symbol and whatever weird energy was permeating the air.

"Brock?" Tina called from above, trying to reach down to me, but it was no use. I was simply too far. 

Tina sighed. "There's no signal. Maria's phone doesn't work here, and all the windows are somehow covered in stone."

"How?" I asked, running my hands through my hair. "And where are the others?"

"I don't know," Tina called. "What do you see down there? Anything that can help us?"

I looked around. Nothing had changed. Just the same circle with the strange symbol in the middle.

"Nothing much," I replied. "Just a weird drawing on the ground."

"What does it look like?" Tina asked. I described the symbol.

"That's weird," Tina said, frowning. "You think someone's been staying here? Like a homeless person or something?"

"If they have, let's hope they're gone now," I said. Tina nodded, still gazing at me from above. Her hands gripped the boards nervously as she watched. I stepped away a bit, walking closer to the symbol on the ground. 

"Where are you going?" Tina said, straining to still be able to look at him.

"I'm getting a closer look," I said. I moved closer to the symbol, reaching my hand out. I touched the dirt of the bull's head symbol, and a shock seems to surge through his body.

Kill.

What was that? It felt like something was watching him. Like he wanted to...

Eat.

I leapt back through the hole in the floorboards. Tina gasped and said something with a shocked and concerned look on her face, but I couldn't hear past the roaring in my head.

Kill.

Eat.

Kill.

Eat.

A split second later and Tina was lying on the floor, her blood pooling around her ripped and torn corpse in a gruesome display.

Kill.

Eat.

Someone was screaming. I couldn't tell who. I think her name used to be Maria.

Kill.

Eat.

The other boys came back in, horrified looks on their faces. They said something about a prank. I didn't listen. Two of them were dead in an instant. The only
one left was Chris. He was crying, sobbing, tears and snot running down his face as he desperately begged for his life. It didn't matter. Words I from a language had never heard spilled forth from my lips.

"Dondagohvi," I whispered.

Their bodies kept me well fed.

It took several hours for me to return back to normal. The stone covering the openings of the house were gone. I gazed at the misshapen corpses of my friends, sobbing as I tried to wipe the blood off me. But it was no use. So I ran.

I'm writing this several months later. It's getting harder to control the urges. I've been reported missing after the police discovered the bodies in the house. People keep going missing, and I keep waking up in the middle of the night covered in blood and dirt. So consider this a confession. And a warning. Don't mess with things you don't understand. And please don't go into the woods alone at night. I don't know if I'll be able to control myself.
