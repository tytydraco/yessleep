Been solo-hiking Black Pines for a few days. I was about to loop back when I spotted this narrow, overgrown path cutting off from the main trail. No markers. No footprints. Just trees growing too close together, like they were hiding something.

Obviously, I followed it.

About a mile in, I found this small clearing. Super isolated. Just a crumbling firepit, half a rotted log, and a big tree with something nailed to it.

Edit:

Found this list carved into a plank of wood. Not printed. Not burned. Carved deep with a blade.

Swear to God, it feels like I just walked into a creepypasta. 😂

🧾 Campground #103 Rules

1. Do not acknowledge anyone outside your campsite after sunset.
2. Do not leave food out after 10:13 PM exactly.
3. If you hear your name whispered, do not respond.
4. From midnight to 12:17 AM, stay inside your tent. Do not look outside, no matter what you hear.
5. If you wake up to the smell of campfire smoke, check your fire immediately. If it’s not lit, do not leave your tent.
6. Do not follow any lights into the woods. Even if they look like flashlights.
7. Before you leave, bury this list. Deep.
8. Do not attempt to leave until the third sunrise.

So yeah, I’m sleeping here tonight. Looks chill. No signal though.

If Slenderman shows up, I’ll update in the morning.

Edit 2 (5:12 AM):
I should be dead.

Night One

I crashed early. Was out by 11. Dead quiet — no bugs, no wind, nothing.

Woke up around 2 AM to someone whispering my name.

“Jake…”

Right outside the tent.

Soft. Familiar. Almost like my sister’s voice.

She’s been dead five years.

“Jake. I’m cold.”

I froze.

Then I remembered the list.

	
Rule 3: If you hear your name whispered, do not respond.

I held my breath.

But then the voice got closer, right against the fabric.

“Please…”

And like an idiot, I whispered:

“Who’s there?”

The voice stopped.

Then something started crawling around the tent. Not walking. Crawling.

I heard nails scraping across dirt. A heavy belly dragging. It circled once, twice…

Then the zipper moved.

From the outside.

Slow.

Steady.

I lunged for my flashlight — dead.

My backup flicked once, then died too.

Then it crawled in.

It didn’t breathe. It made no sound at all.

But I could smell it — rot and metal.

Then I felt fingers wrap around my ankle.
Long. Thin. Wet.

I kicked.

It pulled me once, hard, tearing my sleeping bag and smashing my leg into the floor.

Then it let go.

It just… stopped.

And laughed. No sound — just movement. The tent shifted as it crawled back out.

It didn’t kill me.

It wanted to see what I’d do next.

Morning

Three long scratches down my calf.

Not deep, but clean.

The tent flap was open. The nylon burned along the zipper seam. And on the inside wall, a black handprint — too long, too many fingers.

I packed up and tried to leave.

Walked east for hours.

Eventually ended up… back at the clearing.

Same tree.

Same firepit.

Same rules.

Except now I really read them.

8. Do not attempt to leave until the third sunrise.

Night Two

I did everything right.

Buried my food. Zipped the tent. Crawled in at 11:50 PM. Sat with my back to the wall, knife in hand.

Midnight hit. I waited.

12:03 AM — something brushed the outside of the tent.

Light. Almost tender. Like fingertips. One at a time.

Then came the footsteps.

Not heavy stomps. Not shuffling.

Tiptoes.

It circled the tent six times. Then stopped.

Silence.

Then came the sound of fabric tearing — long, slow, like a knife sliding through canvas. I checked. My tent was sealed. But I still heard it. Right next to my ear.

Then something whispered — not a word.

My breathing.
Copying it.

In sync.

I clutched the knife and stayed still.

At 12:11, I felt breath on the back of my neck.

From inside the tent.

No one had unzipped it.

Then it giggled.

Childlike. But wrong.

Too fast. Too high. Like someone skipping over audio at 1.5x speed.

12:17.

My phone vibrated.

The tent went dead quiet.

Then something outside whispered:

“You’re learning.”

Morning

The log I sat on was gone.

In its place: a shape carved into the dirt.

A crude outline of my body, arms spread, legs together.

Inside it, something had buried my boot.

Still warm.

But I was wearing both.

Night Three

The air was wrong all day. The trees were too still.

I followed every rule. Didn’t speak. Didn’t even think in full sentences.

By 11:45 I was zipped up and waiting.

Midnight hit like a drop of pressure — like the forest itself was breathing in.

And then… I heard a voice inside the tent.

“I can wait forever.”

I didn’t move.

At 12:04, the air turned wet. Not humid. Wet. I could feel moisture on the inside walls. Dripping from above.

But it wasn’t raining.

At 12:09, my flashlight turned on by itself. Bright white. Then blue. Then red.

I didn’t touch it.

At 12:13, something pressed both hands against the tent from the outside — hard.

The whole tent sank inward like it was about to collapse.

And then…

Nothing.

Stillness.

12:17. My phone buzzed.

I’d survived.

Sunrise #3

Real warmth. Birdsong.

The trail opened.

I walked until I found the road.

My car was there.

I drove without blinking. No music. No stops.

By noon, I was back in town.

By nightfall, I was home.

Home

I slept for 14 hours.

This morning, I went to take out the trash.

Opened the front door—

And found myself standing in the clearing.

Campground #103.

My tent.

The same firepit.

Same tree.

Same list nailed to it.

But now, carved into the wood beneath the rules:

“Nice try, Jake. So close.”

I looked down.

Still holding the original list.

The one I tore off the tree before I left.

The one I never buried.

Final Edit:

I thought food was going to be my biggest issue.

Turns out, I was the food.

The rules worked — for a while. They protected me. Made me think I had a chance.

But when I broke the last one…

That was it.

No more conditions. No more midnight windows or whisper voices or warning signs.

Now they come whenever they want.

I’m not home.

That door I opened — it wasn’t my apartment.

It was the clearing.

The trees.

The tent.

The thing crouched just outside the firelight, wearing a version of my face that smiles too wide.

I tried to run.

Didn’t make it far.

They tore something in my leg. I can’t feel my foot.

I don’t think they’re trying to kill me.

I think they let me get away on purpose.

So I’d come back.

So they could watch me break.

I’ve seen their shadows in daylight now.
I’ve heard laughter coming from inside my tent before I unzip it.

There are no more rules.

They have free rein.

And I think they feed on fear.
Letting me believe I had a way out made me taste better.

I don’t know how much longer I have.

But I think they’re done playing.

And now…

They’re just hungry.
