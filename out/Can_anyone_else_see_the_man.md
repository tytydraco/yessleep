I never thought I’d be asking strangers for advice but here I am. So, I work at this radio station called G96. If you’re in the Gulfport area of Mississippi you’ve probably heard of it. I’ve been working there for years now and never had any problems until recently. 

I’m in the recording studio doing my thing, talking about random shit during song breaks. What pizza topping is the best (it’s pepperoni, of course) any recent weather news (we get tons of hurricanes) and any stories I think people might find interesting. After I finish rambling, I put the next round of songs on and take my headphones off. I decide to head to the kitchen to get my lunch and let my coworker Anton know so he can keep the station going. He gives a nod, and then I’m on my way to sustenance. 

I’m walking down the hall when I see this guy. Usually I don’t really bother talking to many people at work, there are tons of different offices and half the people I don’t even know, or what they do. But this guy was so weird. First, he was dressed like he was straight out of the 1940s. Black slacks, long brown trench coat and black dress shoes. He also had a fedora—a fedora! I don’t knock people’s fashion choices but the guy was about five decades in the past. And he was holding this briefcase. 

“Hey! Do you work here?” I call out. Why? I don’t know, the guy gave me the creeps. There was something about him—it honestly made me think he was about to rob the place or something. 

And to make the situation even more awkward, the guy didn’t look up from where he was standing—he just stared ahead at this one specific office. “Uh, dude?” No reaction, just pure focus. The guy wasn’t even moving—not even a twitch. 

I started to really question whether I wanted to talk to this guy or not. What if he was a mass murderer and planning on shooting up that office? What if he was trying to rob somebody? I don’t want to deal with that, I’ve got bills to pay, man. And my turtle, he’s like, the only living relative I’ve got left. But also, what kind of asshole would I be, if I didn’t stop a potential criminal because it’s an inconvenience. 

I start walking closer, but then stop dead because the guy turns right, away from me, and starts walking down the hallway. I stand there for a few seconds unsure of what to do, but then I realize that he’s going to turn that corner, so I run after him. But here’s the thing, when I turn, he’s gone. There are no doors in that hallway. And don’t blame me, the people who built this building are obviously missing a few brain cells and decided windows were good enough. So what? Did he climb out a window? How the hell did he have time to do that? 

I stand there for a few more seconds wondering what the hell just happened. Then my stomach graciously reminded me what I was in the hallway to do. I looked down the hallway one more time, then headed to the kitchen to get my lunch out of the fridge. As I pushed the buttons on the microwave, I couldn’t help but notice the hairs on the back of my neck stand up on end. 

Anton isn’t exactly the most observant guy in the world, but when I sat down with my reheated slice of Dominos pizza, he got this strange look on his face. “You good?” I didn’t know how to answer that. “Yeah, I guess. I…there was this guy in the hallway and then he just…disappeared.” Anton stared at me for a few more seconds before he said “Oh, so, like a ghost or something?” 
“Maybe? I don’t know, man.” Anton shrugged and went back to work while I mulled over my experience. 

I’m not the most intellectual guy in the world, okay. I didn’t know what exactly I saw, but I supposed it was only right to conduct some research and possibly answer some questions. Who is this guy? Why is he in the office? Why won’t he talk to me? What’s in the briefcase? 

The next day, I went out at the same time to look for the guy in the fedora. He was there, staring at the office door. Before I could beg this man to acknowledge my presence and give me the common decency of eye contact—the door opened and a man stepped out. 

The guy in the fedora stood there as a man stepped out of his office. I knew the guy—and by knew I mean I’d seen him around the place multiple times—and man, did he look bad. The guy was pale, there were stains all over his shirt (from what???) and the guy was wheezing something awful. “Hey, you okay, man?” The guy shook his head, obviously, and stumbled down the hallway. “Inhaler…” the guy managed to wheeze out, gasping like he’d just ran a marathon. “I…” his face was beet red and starting to go purple. I fumbled with my phone, dialing 911 with shaking hands. 

I got my hands on the transcript, because if I’m being honest, I don’t remember what I said. I was freaking out a little bit. 

“911 what’s your emergency?” 
“Hey, uh, this guy I work with can’t breathe. He said something about an inhaler.” 
“Okay sir, what’s your address.” 
“It’s the G96 radio station, uh the street address is [REDACTED].”
“Okay, sir I’m dispatching units now. Is he still breathing?” 
“Yeah, yeah. But his face is turning like, purple kind of. He said inhaler, maybe he has asthma?” 
“Do you know if he has one?” 
“No I don’t know the guy. Hold on, maybe it’s in his office.”
“Sir, stay with him!” 
“Okay, okay, inhaler…oh—.” 
CALL ENDED 

Apparently, the call dropped as soon as I stepped into his office, which is so weird because it’s a radio station, we shouldn’t be in a dead spot for cell service. Whatever, that’s not my job, anyway, what the police dispatcher missed was me walking into the office looking for this guy’s inhaler. How hard would it be to find? 

It wasn’t hard at all, it was in the hands of the fedora guy, his briefcase open on the desk in front of him. He was blocking it, so I couldn’t see it, but he put the inhaler inside of it and then closed it. He turned around and paused when he saw me. “Dude, he needs that, give it to him!” I shout, about to wrench the brief case from his hands if that’s what it takes. The guy with the fedora just stood there, his hat obscuring his facial features so I couldn’t see his eyes. 

I don’t know how long we stood there, but after a while I got a wicked headache. One of those that starts behind the eyes and stabs you over and over again—they fucking suck. Not long after the headache started, someone grabbed my shoulder. It was Anton, looking at me like I’d lost my mind. “What are you doing, dude? Why are there paramedics in the hall?” I turn away from Anton and look back at the fedora guy, but he was gone. 

I explain to Anton about the guy who had the asthma attack and I mentioned the fedora guy. “He was wearing a trench coat, a briefcase and a fedora? Dude, that’s like, a 1940s mobster, not a guy who works at an office.” I decided not to tell him about the inhaler and the fact that the fedora guy seems to disappear and reappear at will. What is he, a ghost? Can ghost touch objects like that? And why the hell did the guy not see him when he came out of the office—fedora guy was standing right there!  

The next day, I decided to test whether Anton could see the man. Hell, if anyone could see him except me. It wasn’t hard to find the fedora guy, he was in the same hallway but this time at a different office. I grabbed my lunch again and saw another coworker, Kinsley, who worked for G96. “Hey, Kinsley.” She smiles as she pours herself some tea (she’s addicted, pretty sure her blood is 90% Arizona sweet tea). “Hey.” I take a deep breath and dive head first. 

“Okay so this is gonna sound weird, but do you see anyone in that hallway?” Kinsley looks at me blankly and then peeks around the corner to look down the hallway. I go with her and I can clearly see the fedora guy standing in front of the office across from the asthma guy’s. “Uh, no, I don’t.” I frown, considering this revelation. “Are you okay? I heard what happened to Mike.” Mike? Oh, asthma guy. “Yeah. Is he okay?” 
“They were able to stablize him. He’s supposed to be coming back tomorrow.”
“Tomorrow? Isn’t that little soon?” Kinsley shrugs and goes to get her ice tea. I go and grab my lunch, pizza again. 

To really prove that I’m obviously going insane, I run back to office and grab Anton. “Okay, listen, this is going to sound really crazy, but I want you to look down the hallway and tell me if you see anyone.” Anton shrugged and said, “Sure, dude.” And put his headphones on the desk. He stepped out for a few seconds then came back in. “Nah, man, sorry.” I stepped out, but of course, the fedora guy was right there, creepily staring at the office door. 

My shoulders sagged and I walked to my chair. “Is it that ghost you were talking about?” 
“I’m not so sure he’s a ghost. Why can’t anyone else see him?” 
“Any psychotic breaks in your family history?” Asked Anton. 
“Just an uncle. Twice removed.” 
“That was a joke.” 
“Oh.” 
“Look man, I’m not calling you crazy. Maybe you’re just special and can see weird shit we can’t.” 

Anton put his headphones on and I sat there, ignoring my work. What if I don’t want this mythical ability to see the fedora guy? What if I just want to go back to my boring day to day working at a radio station? 

But here’s where it gets creepy. Okay, so Mike came back a couple days later and he had another asthma attack. This time, no one was in the hallway and he died. Yeah, Mike died a couple days after the fedora guy took his inhaler. That’s not a coincidence, it can’t be. Fedora guy took his inhaler on purpose and now Mike is dead. I’d hate to see what other medical devices he has in that briefcase. 

Oh, and that office he was standing outside of? It was another random office but a woman named Janice worked there. A day after Mike died, Janice died, too. Presley, who also works at G96, is our resident gossip and she managed to get information out of the police and paramedics. Apparently, Janice had a heart condition that was controlled by blood thinners. Her blood thinners were mysteriously missing from her office where her friends say she kept them. Without her meds, Janice had a heart attack. 

People are dead, which is insane. What is the fedora guy? And why do people die around him? Does he do it for fun? Is he getting orders from someone else? Other troubling question; is everyone in this office in danger of being indirectly killed by the fedora guy? 

The reason why I posted this is to ask if anyone else has seen him, or if anyone knows what he is. Because after Janice died, the fedora guy has started watching me. He stands outside the office door and follows me to the kitchen, to the bathroom. He’s never too close, and I can never see his face, but he’s there watching me every minute I’m in the office. 

I seriously think I might die.
