Strange few days. Finally got the internet working through a smoke-stained modem that looks like it was yanked out of a middle school computer lab. Found an ethernet cable in the drawer, plugged it in, and somehow it's alive. Reddit loads fine. YouTube? No chance. Gmail won’t even start.

Figured I’d write this while the connection holds.

Anyone ever hear of Lake Kowatcha, Mi?

I can’t find anything. Searched the lake, the motel, even the diner I ate at. Closest hit was a blurry scan of a tourist brochure from what looked like 2001, hosted on a .net site that might’ve been archived.

I wasn’t planning on stopping here. I needed gas. Every station I passed was either shut down or had the pumps bagged. Thought I saw one lit up on a hill, but by the time I circled back, it was gone. Or I missed the turn. Hard to tell. The roads out here are long and quiet, and start to feel like they’re shifting behind you.

That’s how I ended up here.

The motel was the only thing lit up. Neon VACANCY sign buzzed like a bad tooth. Paint used to be baby blue. Now it’s more of a flaking sadness color, The Riverview motor lodge.

The sky was sitting low when I arrived. Not storming—just heavy. That kind of spring fog that feels like it’s pressing against your skin.

There’s a hum in this town. Low, steady, like a busted transformer a few streets over. You don’t notice it until it’s gone, and then it’s all you notice.

The guy at the front desk didn’t ask for a name. Just slid over a key with a paper tag that looked water-damaged. Room 6.

"Settle up when you leave," he said. Then, after a pause:

"Don’t let your dog stare too long. They don’t like it."

Room 6 isn’t much. Mildew smell. Carpet stain shaped like a tugboat. Itchy quilted comforter. Metal bed frame that groans every time I shift. The bathroom has that pink and green tile every grandmother in Michigan seems to have had. TV’s got rabbit ears and only picks up static. There’s a creek behind the motel—I cracked the window so I could hear it over the hum.

The modem was already blinking when I walked in. Red light. Steady rhythm. I keep watching it. Swear it skipped once.

Walked into town this morning. Lake Kowatcha isn’t empty, just... unfinished. A few shops are open—most in low brick buildings or mismatched cottages with flaking paint. One place sells yarn, bait, and vintage t-shirts from events that probably never happened.

The lake’s huge. Still half-frozen at the edges. Signs for jet ski rentals and summer events all sun-bleached and decades out of date. One shirt in a window said:

"The Clouds Are Closer Here."

Stopped at a place called Lakefront Diner & Fuel. Attached to an old truck stop. Whole building smells like burnt coffee and fryer oil. Booths stick. A waitress named Deb poured me a cup without asking.

"You’re in six, yeah?" she said. I nodded. "Don’t let your dog stare too long."

"You too, huh?" I said, nodding at her name tag.

Same wording. Same tone.

I asked her who "they" were. She said:

"I dont know but, they seem to notice the dogs first."

While she talked about how nobody ice fishes here anymore, a truck rolled through the lot. Pale blue cab. No logos. Same shade as the motel. Didn’t stop. Just passed through, turned near the radio tower out back, and vanished.

That tower still blinks red, even though it looks ready to collapse. If you stand under it, you can hear it hum.

Back in the room now. Tully’s asleep. The modem blinked out of rhythm again. Or maybe it didn’t. Hard to tell.

If anyone’s heard of this place, drop a comment.

I’ll probably head out tomorrow.

Just needed a night.
