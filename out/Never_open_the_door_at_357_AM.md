I wish I had listened to my gut. Me (24 M) and my wife (25 W) recently bought a house from an elderly women but while we were chatting she told us something odd, "Never open the door at 3:57 AM." Me and my wife did an awkward laugh but she looked dead serious.

 Fast forward a few years and it's my wife's 27th birthday. We invited a few friends over the night before and planned to celebrate at midnight. It's around 3:20 AM and we want to order a pizza. We are playing some board games and drinking when we hear the doorbell ring. My wife's best friend gets up to answer it and I tap ce over at the clock, 3:57 AM. I had a bad feeling in my gut but shook it off. I heard the sound of the door opening followed by a scream, a crack, and a thud. Everyone stops and rush over and what I see will haunt me forever. She was dead, her body bent in ways it should never be, blood dripping from her mouth, and she was pale almost paper white. My wife is on the floor crying at this point and while I comfort her I remember we have a ring camera! I pull out my phone and look at the app, nothing. No one was there, "but how no one's there?" I say to myself. Me and my wife immediately tell everyone to get out and we head back to bed but I can't fall asleep and I'm pretty sure she is awake.


It's the next morning and we don't talk or eat, we just head to work. 3:50 AM I stayed up then heard the stairs creaking. My wife told me she couldn't sleep and came down to check. 3:57 AM. We heard knocks followed by the sound of bones cracking, a chill went down my spine. I mustered up the courage and opened the door, there it was. 6ft tall, pale skin, it was so skinny you could see the outline of its bones, and its eyes were all black. SNAP. My wife is on the floor dead, I shut the door but forget to lock it and I immediately run to the upstairs bathroom and lock the door. 

I can hear the knocks and the sound of bones cracking. “Come out to make it easier for both of us!” It said to me in a deep but high pitched voice. More aggressive knocks and bone cracking i’m getting scared. “Come on just come out pleaseee??” It begged me in a child-like voice. “No.” I responded in a scared voice. “No,” was all I could say without crying. It laughed or at least I think it did. It sounded like a laugh with a cry and of course more bone cracking. It's almost 5 AM. My phone is about to die and my wife is dead. Please help me get rid of it and get out. There are no windows and I feel trapped. It's about to break the door down.
