It was loud as it blasted past us. While I could hear the blaring car horn, I also heard a buzz coming from Kelly’s tightly gripped phone. She turned to me as I glanced at it, trying to mind the road in a city I’d never been to before. "I got a Cash App request, and it says 'fuck off, tourist,'" Kelly said. "I thought people were supposed to be nice around here, Alice."

“Probably some asshole, sis,” I replied to Kelly, my older sister, but only for four minutes and fifteen seconds, at least that's what our parents always remind us. Twins, inseparable since birth, we've been best friends even as we’ve grown into adulthood.

"I told you the whole 'buy the bride a drink' thing wasn't a good idea," Meredith mumbled from the backseat. Both Kelly and I shot her a glance in the rear view mirror.

"You helped write it after we got the rental car," I replied. "Plus, I hear lots of people do the same thing."

"Beg strangers in a city to buy them drinks by writing your Cash App name on the back window of your car?"

"It's not begging, Mer," Kelly said. "We're just asking random strangers to help me party one last time before I tie the knot."

“What time do the rest of the girls get here tomorrow?” I asked.

“Early morning, I’m pretty sure,” Kelly responded as I heard the phone vibrate again. Her eyes lit up, giddy with excitement. “Well, this might actually be fun.”

“What is it?” Meredith asked.

“I just got forty bucks from somebody called TheBMF95.”

“So it actually works?” I laughed. “I guess we can go for our mimosas in the morning after we pick up the others.”

“Why wait till morning?” Meredith chimed in, suddenly enthused. Kelly turned to me with a playfully sly smile, as if she was asking for my permission. As we drove down the highway, I could see the city’s skyline.

“You’re the bride, Kelly. It’s your call.”

"No pressure, but the exit is coming up, Kelly," Meredith joked. We all giggled in the car. What was the harm of a little extra fun before the others arrived? I turned to Kelly again. Her smile was wide, and I then knew the answer as I changed lanes, heading to bustling downtown. “But let’s not go crazy, so we can actually wake up and pick up the others.” 

“Just a few drinks,” Meredith assured. 

—

"Where should we start?" I asked, navigating the lively street. My voice was barely audible even to myself as I gazed at the neon signs of all the bars, music blaring from each building. The music almost hung in the thick, humid air as Kelly pointed to a bar.

"Let's start here!" Kelly exclaimed, pointing excitedly. We entered, wading through the crowded space as a twangy guitar played over the patrons' chatter. We found a table, wiping the beer-damp surface with a napkin.

"So, what do we want, ladies?" I asked. "Remember, let's not get too crazy."

"Get a couple of lemon drops; we'll save the mimosas for the morning," Kelly said loudly, her voice breaking through the wall of chatter and guitar. I nodded in acknowledgment and started to weave through the maze of people.

I locked eyes with the bartender. He looked to be in his late twenties, with his hair in a tight ponytail. I tried to wave him down before he turned and began talking to another person at the bar.

"He hates it when you do that," a voice said behind me. I turned to see a cute-looking man around my age, with stubble on his face and short light-dark hair. He was dressed in dark slacks and a nice red polo shirt. "If he looks at you, he knows you're there."

"How would you know?"

"Because I'm here a lot. I've talked to him a couple of times."

"Ah, a local expert, I see."

"Expert? No, but observant, yes," he replied. "From out of town, I'm guessing."

"Here for a Bachelorette party. The bride is my twin sister to be exact."

"You and everyone else," he joked as he turned around, observing the crowd. There were lots of tables full of women wearing sashes that said "bride" or "bridesmaid," and a variety of cowboy hats with frilly colors and things attached to them. "It's that season."

"You're not wrong," I said, looking around at the sea of sashes and sparkly hats. "They said this town was buzzing this time of year.” 

“So how many of the bride squad did you bring with you?” 

“Six of us,” I replied. “Only three of us are here right now, but we are picking up our friends tomorrow.” 

“Just make sure you and your friends tip well,” he replied. “If there’s one thing everyone hates down here, it’s when all the 'woo' noises don’t equate to twenty to thirty percent.” 

“I’ll make sure,” I promised. “So, you live here?” “Born and raised. I was here before the boom and will be after we aren’t trendy anymore. What’s your name, by the way?” 

“Alice. Yours?” 

“Robert, but everyone calls me Rob. So, where are you from?” 

“Ohio.” “Like Cleveland or Cincinnati?” 

“What are you having?” I heard a call behind me. I turned around to see the bartender had come back. Rob stepped to the bar and gave me a crooked grin. “What are you three having?” he asked.

“Lemon drops,” I answered.

 “Can I get three lemon drops, please?” “Put it on my tab,” Rob replied, giving me a flirtatious wink. “Tell your sister congratulations, and maybe, when you come back for the next round, we can chat a little bit more.” 

After struggling to maneuver with three lemon drops in the crowded bar, I set them down as Kelly asked, “What took so long?” 

“It’s a busy bar, and then I sort of started talking to a cute guy.” 

“Maybe you’ll finally find someone,” Meredith chimed in as she took a sip of her drink, with a sharp smile. “Then you can both be married, and you won’t be a third wheel, Alice.”

“You’re not married either, Meredith.” 

She took another drink and said, “Because I think marriage is antiquated and stupid.” 

“Or you’re just too high-maintenance,” Kelly said, trying to defend me.

"No, I just know what I want," Meredith returned. "So, where is this guy you were talking about?"

"Red polo shirt, brownish hair, and a little bit of facial hair," I replied, pointing to the area where I'd met him.

"Is that him?" Meredith pointed to another person dressed almost identically to Rob, but it wasn't him. "I thought you two usually liked taller guys; he seems a little short."

"Nothing wrong with being short," Kelly replied. "But is that him?"

"No, I'm looking for him."

"I'm just saying you two usually like the same type. If your fiancé had a twin, I'm sure Alice would be all over him," Meredith joked as I continued to scan, looking for him.

"Is that him?" Kelly asked, pointing towards another person, who was not Rob. I shook my head as both of us continued to look around the bar area. My eyes darted across the bar, but it seemed as if Rob was no longer there, and I thought so *much for talking to him again.* Just then, Kelly's phone vibrated with another notification. "Looks like I got another fifty dollars, ladies."

"Where did this one come from?" I asked.

"From the person before. It says, 'I hope you ladies are enjoying the drinks, have another round on me.' Ah, that's sort of sweet."

"Or creepy," Meredith interjected.

"You really know how to ruin the moment, don't you?" I said, all but giving up on trying to find Rob. I started to drink. "I don't see him anymore."

"Don't worry about it. I say we finish these drinks and move on to one of those celebrity-owned bars," Kelly replied, taking another drink. "Are you two good with that?"

I nodded, and Meredith replied, "Alright, let me try to find the bathroom in this place first. I haven't peed since we got on the airplane."

Meredith drank the rest of her drink before she stood and started to wander off. Kelly looked over at me. "Seven days until I'm married. Are you ready to stand up there with me?"

"Of course," I responded, downing my drink to prepare for us to move on to the next bar. "I'm super happy for you."

"I just know there was skepticism and hesitancy when I first told you."

"I know, and that was selfish of me, but we've always been really close, Kelly," I responded. "I just wanted to make sure he was the right person for you."

"Do you think he's the right one for me?"

"Yes!" I assured her. Her phone started to vibrate again. Another notification popped up as she saw another twenty dollars had been donated to our drinking. "Another one?"

"Yeah, it says 'be safe out there.'"

"Same account?"

"I'm starting to agree with Meredith," Kelly nodded and responded. "It is creepy."

"Why the serious look, you two?" Meredith blurted out as she sat back down, loudly adjusting her seat. Kelly pointed her phone at Meredith, who frowned after reading. "I told you it was creepy and exactly what I thought would happen when we wrote that on the rental."

"Do you think someone could be stalking us?" Kelly asked, a slight tremble in her voice. It wasn't exactly how she thought our first night in the city would play out.

"I mean, we got it when we were first on the road, you know?" Meredith assured. "That means they would have been following us the entire time. Honestly, I think it's some troll who wants to mess with us."

"So a stalker?" I asked.

"No, just some weirdo that's probably sitting at his house laughing his ass off. But they keep sending money, so we might as well use it."

"I don't know, Meredith ."

"Fine, let's just do one more round at another bar, then we can head back to the Airbnb and get the others in the morning."

"I don't know—" Kelly said.

"No, one more round. We can't let your last week before you get married end on a sour note," I interrupted, after seeing my sister's face with a look of worry and disappointment. "Meredith  is probably right. It's just someone trying to mess with us. I can't see how they would possibly know who and where we are."

“Alright, one more bar,” Kelly replied, as the three of us got out of our seats and started to make our exit. I turned around to look for him one last time, but didn’t see him, so I finished the last of my drink and followed the other two.

– 

While downtown was still lively, the crowds had dwindled. It was getting late as the three of us walked down the street. Meredith and I led the way; I could tell my sister was a little more cautious, surveying the area around her. She didn't have to say it—I knew she was still freaked out.

As we entered the bar, it was surprisingly still crowded, but I looked around and pointed at an empty table. We quickly hurried over and sat down. "I guess it's my turn to buy the rounds this time," Meredith announced. "What are we having?"

"I think let's just get a couple of beers, then call it, Mer," Kelly answered. "Does that work for you, Alice?"

I nodded approvingly. "Let's keep it extra light and save our energy for when the rest of the girls are here."

"Alright, three beers coming right up," Meredith said as we watched her disappear into the crowd. I started to feel the urge to use the bathroom myself. Like Mer, I hadn't gone since before we got on the plane. 

"Are you going to be okay if I go to the bathroom real quick?" 

"Yeah, I'll be fine. Hopefully, Mer will be back soon." 

I looked around for directions to the bathroom, seeing a sign that said "Bathrooms," which at least made it easier. As I made my way toward the small hallway, I could see women exiting. 

I felt a cold chill run down my spine, a gut feeling that someone was watching me. I entered the bathroom; it felt eerily quiet, especially for a bar that was as busy as it was. As I entered and closed the stall door, sitting on the toilet, I started to relieve myself. 

Then I heard a loud thud; someone entered the bathroom aggressively. 

They walked slowly, but still loud enough for it to be audible. I froze on the seat as their hand slid along the stall, like a taunting slither. That’s when my phone vibrated, and I saw a message from Kelly.

 ‘*I got a creepy request for money on Cash App*.’

 The hand stopped at the stall door and began shaking the handle menacingly, pulling hard, trying to rip the door off the hinges to get inside the stall with me. My phone started to vibrate with another message from my sister. 

‘Get out here now! They are sending multiple cash requests now.’

“Go away!” I screamed. “I am calling the police right now!” “I am about to throw up,” a female voice said, letting go of the handle. Their feet stumbled across the bathroom as I quickly pulled up my pants, opening the stall to see a red-headed female with her hair pointed down to the sink, vomiting into it.

I bolted out the door, when I heard male voice. “Alice,” it called out, it was the cute guy from earlier, Rob. Who gave me a smile. “You never came back to the bar.” 

My mind raced at the sight of him and I yelled, “Are you following us?”

“What?” he replied, seemingly taken back by my response.

“Are you following us!” I shot back, as he took a step towards me I stepped back. “No, stay away from me.” 

“Are you alright?” he asked.

“You are following me!”

“Or I am just going to a different bar after you left.” 

"Whatever, I need to get back to my sister. Just fuck off!" I shouted at him. He took a step back, and I rushed past him, making my way to the crowd. I saw Mere and my sister sitting there. I turned back to see if Rob was anywhere, but he seemed to have stayed behind.

"Alice, let's get out of here," Kelly said, showing me her phone. I glanced at Mere, who had a stern look on her face. I opened the app and saw a few requests, asking for the money increments they had sent us earlier.

"I hope you are enjoying the drinks I bought you, bitch," I read out loud from the first message before moving on to the second. "Do be mindful on the city streets, I am keeping a close eye on you."

"Someone is messing with us, Kelly," Meredith chimed in. "I don't see how anyone would be able to follow us."

"Hope you three are enjoying your drinks," I read the next one. Meredith stared at me, still not convinced or making the connection. "How do they know there are only three of us?"

"Alright, I'm in agreement, let's get out of here," Meredith said, quickly getting out of her seat. "I probably should have read all of them."

As the three of us started to move towards the door, I turned around and saw him again. He was just looking at me. "That's the guy from earlier," I whispered to the other two.

"He would know that there were only three of us," Meredith responded. "He was watching us the entire time."

"Are you sure that's him, Alice?"

"I may have told him that the others were joining us tomorrow and there were only three of us," I admitted with a hint of embarrassment. My sister and Mer looked at me with a hint of disappointment. "How was I supposed to know this would happen?"

"Doesn't matter. I can shame you later," Meredith remarked. "Let's just get to the Airbnb and call the cops. We can go from there."

The three of us walked out of the bar. I shot one last glance at Rob as he stood there and watched us leave. The streets were almost empty now, except for a handful of people, mostly in groups, reeking of beer and talking loudly.

“The car is this way," Kelly pointed. We were each trying not to draw too much attention to ourselves. We saw the rental car down the road, parked at a meter, but all sorts of debris surrounded it. It was hard to make out in the dark, and the message we'd written on the back window couldn't be seen either.

"Fuck, I hate this city!" Meredith yelled as she dashed toward the car. The two of us picked up our pace, walking behind her, only to see that the window had been smashed. Our suitcases were ripped open, their contents — all our items and clothing — tattered and strewn across the street.

"It has to be that guy you were talking with about us!" Kelly screamed. "He probably creeps around airports, looking for people to stalk!"

"Are you trying to blame me for this?" I cried out. "I just thought he was someone flirting with me, for God's sake!"

"Yeah, that's why I'm getting married and you're not!" Kelly screamed again, her words pointed and sharp. "Because you've got garbage taste in men! And you try to project that on me because I'm getting married, carrying on with my life, and you’re just stagnant.” 

"You're the one who put that stupid shit on the rental car. Didn't you think about how that could make us a target?"

"Oh, it's my fault, huh?" Kelly snapped back. "Face it, Alice. I am moving on, and this time you can't come with me!"

"Stop it! Just fucking stop it, you two!" Meredith shouted. "Let's just grab what we can and call the cops when we get to where we're staying. We can all be dramatic together after that!"

The three of us walked around the car, piling our clothes and other things into our arms, throwing them back into the backseat. "Come on, let's go," Kelly said, looking at me coldly, as the three of us got into the car. "Put some clothes down around the backseat, Mer; at least you can try to minimize the cuts."

"Why don't we just call a Lyft or something?" I asked. "That way she doesn't have to worry about ruining all our clothes?"

"So you can tell them all about us?" Kelly remarked. "I don't want anyone in this city to know where we're going."

We got in the car and pulled off, silently. It was silent in the car through the city for a few minutes. Kelly's phone vibrated again with another notification, but she ignored it. "Aren't you going to read it?" I asked.

“No, not until we call the cops, just ignore it and let me use Apple Maps to get where we are going.” 

I reached for the phone, but Kelly shot me an angry glance, “Alice, don’t you touch that phone until we call the cops.” 

“Fine,” I said, as the phone buzzed again.

—

The street was quiet. The only sound was us as the car pulled up, parking in front of the house, our Airbnb. Both Kelly and Meredith quickly gathered their items from the backseat. "Are you coming?" Kelly asked, exasperated.

"Yeah, just give me a minute," I replied. My sister finally showed some sympathy, realizing the piercing effect her words had on me. "Just let me grab some of my clothes."

"Don't take too long, okay?" she replied. I noticed Meredith had already opened the door and gone inside. I nodded, trying to hold back a tear, as my sister slowly walked towards the house. Then, I heard a vibration from inside the car. I looked at the cup holder to see my sister's phone sitting there; she had forgotten it.

I know I shouldn't have done it, but truthfully, the perk of being a twin is that sometimes facial recognition does work. I opened it and saw multiple requests. I opened the latest one, and my heart sank.

It was an address: the one to our Airbnb.

"Kelly!" I shouted, before hearing something behind me. It sounded like glass being swept away from the back window, the one we had playfully drawn on, now busted open.

I turned to see the slightest glimpse of a figure, its face and features obstructed by the darkness of the night. "Kelly!" I screamed, fumbling with her phone, trying to call 9-1-1, before I heard another bash against the driver's side window. "They're here!"

The door was still wide open as I headed inside. I noticed it was completely dark in the house as I dashed in, looking behind me to see that no one was in pursuit. "Kelly, where are you!"

"I'm over here! I don't have my phone, and the lights aren't working!"

"I have it!" I shouted back, turning on the flashlight to see my sister looking at me. "Did Mer call the cops?"

"I don't know, I've been trying to get the lights on."

"They know we're here! I saw they had our address!"

"Meredith! Where are you!" Kelly cried out, as I looked at the other message. My eyes widened. My sister started wandering around, and I tried to stay as close as I could as she moved erratically.

"Kelly, this message says I can love you better than they can."

"We have to find Meredith, get out of here, and just call the cops when we get as far from here as possible, Alice! Just help me find Mer!"

I started to look around in the darkness, being mindful of any furniture that could get in the way. "Stay close to me," I whispered, before hearing a bloodcurdling, painful shriek come from somewhere in the house.

I could see my sister's eyes widen, and she started to run. "Meredith, we are coming!"

"No, stay with me!"

The sound came from the back of the house. I watched my sister continue to follow the source of the sound; she ran through a door with me lagging slightly behind. "Meredith, we are here!" Kelly shouted as she entered.

The door slammed as I reached for the knob, trying to turn it. Another cry for help came from behind it, as I banged on it screaming, "Alice! Alice! I am here, let me in! Meredith! Someone! Open the door, please!"

The only sound that returned was a painful cry for help that said, "Alice, help me!" I tried to force my way through, but I couldn't. The cries became softer, weaker, but they continued to cry, "Alice, I am sorry for what I said, Alice, please don't leave me here."

“Kelly, I am not leaving you! Just hold on!” I begged banging at the door.  But I was only returned with silence, my stomach began to knot, and my heart sinked. “Kelly, please answer me!” 

The phone slid out my hand as I continued banging on the door. My only source of light had illuminated the floor, as a small stream of blood began to come from the door. “No!,” I shouted, as I looked for anywhere or anything that would get me inside to my sister. 

There had to be a window. I stumbled as quickly as I could to the front door and circled around the house to find it. The window that led to the room. Through it, I could see my sister lying there, covered in blood, joined by a familiar figure, the one I had seen earlier, once again shrouded in darkness. I looked around and saw stones scattered around a small garden bed below.

I picked one up and threw it as hard as I could at the window. As it shattered, I heard another noise, something that will always haunt me, It was the sounds of sobbing, words stuttered as they said, "I told you I know what I want and it was always you," Meredith whimpered.
