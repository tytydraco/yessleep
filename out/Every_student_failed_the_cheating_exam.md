Everyone of my students have failed the cheating exam. After normal boring exams like maths, English and science, the cheating exam is the last one they must all do. It's the most exciting one and all of the students must find a way to successfully cheat the history exam. History was chosen for the cheating exam. If they get caught cheating during the cheating exam, then they fail, but if they complete to answer all questions through cheating, then they pass and they then can tell us how they did it. Everyone is worried for a missing student called Liam and nobody knows what has happened to him, he will miss the cheating exam. 

When the cheating exam starred I noticed straight away, that gilains eyes were flashing as she had computer contact lenses, and someone from outside of school was typing her the answers. How disappointing. I also noticed Barton's ear plugs and I can hear someone's voice from the ear plugs, telling Barton the answers. How disappointing. Then there was Holland, and he had multiple chewing gun stuck under his table with a piece of paper that had the answers. Multiple students were passing around chewed chewing gums, how disgusting. 

Then there was ericka, she called off sick and had her parents take the test from home. The stupid girl though recorded everything on social media. If she had waited after she had submitted the paper, then surely she would have passed the cheating exam. Then there was tudack, he always bought 6 bus tickets one for his ass, 2 for his hands, 2 for his feet and 1 for his head so that he could lay down on the bus seat with his feet up. Then he will remember the answers written on the bus tickets given to him by the genius bus driver. How the bus driver got the answers? Not sure but if he was a student he would have passed the cheating exam. 

Then on the results day for the cheating exam, everyone was surprised when I said "everyone has failed apart from liam" and everyone gasped and they shouted "Mr Pollock Liam is missing though" and the real Mr Pollock stepped into class with police officers. 

I took off my silicone hyper-realistic mask to look like Mr Pollock,  and we were also the same height and body build as well. A month before the cheating exams, after when the boring normal exams were completed, I attacked Mr Pollock and made him unconscious and imprisoned him in his own home. I pretended to be him and took the cheating test in the same hall as the other students, but with Mr Pollock's answer sheet and sitting at his desk, and submitted it when I completed it. After completing it I phoned the police to free Mr Pollock. 

"No don't arrest Liam, he passed the cheating exam. It's the only exam he has passed" the real Mr Pollock admitted. I was so happy with myself.
