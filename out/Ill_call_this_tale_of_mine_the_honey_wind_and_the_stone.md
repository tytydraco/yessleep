I guess it all started when I was walking out in the woods just wandering around enjoying myself and all the little animals running through the fallen leaves like I always do to relax, and just like any other day I was picking up rocks looking for arrowheads like everyone used to do.   
 That's when I seen a very intriguing rock almost like any other rock but smooth, more smooth than any rock I've found around here and even stranger a hole dead center of the thing, I didn't notice how all the little animals I always heard were completely silent almost as if the disappeared or was even never existed to begin with.  
   I only noticed when I started tracing my fingers around the hole as if I was solving a puzzle even I wasn't aware of, then I started hearing whispers so faint at first I thought I was imagining it and then that's when I felt the almost childlike impulse to hold it up to my eye as if to see the world in a new more childlike way and much to my surprise I did and it was wonderful at first everything was brighter more vibrant like looking at the world with a brand new set of eyes but it was short lived after a few days of going back out there with my new prize I started to see thing scurry behind trees and bushes not the usual animals that follow me in the woods but something more intelligent as if it wanted to play some kind of game with me but for the life of me I couldn't figure out the rules.   
 For days I'd go out there trying to see them to make out what whispers they'd say but to no avail till one day I didn't have to go out into the woods to hear them hell to eventually feel them as if they would dance on me as I sleep only to disappear again as soon as I jump up to catch them, damn things wouldn't let me sleep as soon as I was about to fall alseep it never failed I'd hear them shout HEY or say my name, I would have never guessed it would get worse so much worse oh the nightmares they would whisper every night each night worse than the last I don't even want to think about what they said and it's not like I didn't try to fight this almost air like entities haunting me I noticed they like surgery things and honey I'd set up traps for it only for the traps to be completely ripped apart in the mornings.   
 All I accomplished by doing that was making them angry and woke up to my disemboweled cat Tom he was always a lazy cat but good in all other aspects I think that's what set me over the edge I took the stone and fashioned a headpiece out of it and some old pair of swimming goggles I had in storage now I could stay ever vigilant and on guard with me hammer never sleeping at this point and always over aware of every little noise I know i must seem crazy writing all this down for you all to read but I'm at my wits end I need advise on how to deal with these honey winds as I decided to call them so if anyone has any helpful advice I'm all ears I know this is a abrupt end to my post but that's all there is for the moment.
