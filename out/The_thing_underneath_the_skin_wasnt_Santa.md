I recently got fired from my job, followed up with a breakup, and even though I'm at the dinner table all by myself this Christmas, I still don't feel this was the worst Christmas of my life. 

It's gonna take me a lot of drinks to even write about it, but I feel like enough time has passed, and what happened to me and my family should be shared with the world. 

Every year on Christmas, my entire family used to meet up at our grandpa's house. Aunts, uncles, cousins and ofcourse, grandpa and grandma. 

I always looked forward to Christmas, not because of the gifts, or meeting family, but because of my grandpa's house. It was built on top of a hill, which was usually pearly white around this time because of snow, and covered by miles and miles of forest.

"Ethan!" My daydreaming was interrupted by my dad. 
"We're almost there, pack your stuff up and clean your seat" dad ordered. 
"And also...." mom joined in, "make sure to behave properly, talk to everyone." I rolled my eyes hearing that, I've always been a shy guy, avoiding conversations everytime I can. 

My focus was directed back on the road, the early rays of sunshine reflected off of the snow, all the animals were going about their lives, looking for food to survive the winter. 

"Honey, what's that?" mom asked dad. It was a dead moose, well.... Not just a dead moose, three of em, blood splattered everywhere, heads sliced clean off. "Woah who did that?!" I asked in both shock and disgust. 
"Hmm, probably a pack of wolves..... Hard to imagine them taking down three moose on their own though." Dad replied. 

Mom sensed my sadness, and quickly tried to cheer me up by saying "Uncle Mike called yesterday, he said he has a lot of surprises planned for you kids."
"That boy better stop all this and focus on getting a job, 26 and unemployed...." Dad immediately interrupted. 


We were greeted by grandma upon arriving, who immediately gave me a cookie to eat. We were the last ones to arrive so by the time we got there, everyone was in the living room, waiting for us. Within seconds there was nonstop talking in the entire room, everyone was talking, but no one was listening. 

All the men were out in the garden, talking about, well...... Usual male stuff. While all the women were with grandma, asking her how she's been.
I could hear my dad talking to uncle Mike, giving him advice.
 
"Honestly, I feel like it would be better if he just stays with me" Grandpa interrupted, "managing the farm is getting tough these days, especially as I get older....... 13 farm animals were killed this week, Mike and I went out to investigate, but found nothing."
"We saw three corpses of moose while coming here, we assumed it was just a pack of wolves." Dad replied. 
"This ain't done by no wolves, look at their heads, sliced clean off." Grandpa replied. 

Because I could hear anything else, I got knocked to the ground. I looked up to see my cousin Duke laughing. "Be nice Duke! You just hurt him. " Catherine yelled. 

Both Duke and Catherine are my cousins, Duke's a boy full of energy, always jumping around, being rebellious, and just being a pain in the ass. Catherine on the other hand, is a nerdy girl, to put it simply......she's the type of girl who reminds the teacher that they didn't give us homework. 

"Alright im going into the forest, bye guys!!!" Duke ran away. "Take one step into the forest and I'll tell all the adults!" Catherine yelled as she chased after him. 

Amidst all this chaos, evening rolled around. I was almost shocked to see how fast the time went.
 
While Catherine was helping her mom, me and Duke were watching the sunset. "You wanna stay up all night waiting for Santa? My mom never lets me do it at home, but I feel like I have a shot here." Duke asked. "Sure man, but promise me you won't do anything too crazy" I replied. 
Duke sighed, "fine..... I promise." He paused, "I like you dude, unlike that snitch Catherine" He said as he proceeded to do a very ugly and exaggerated mimicry of Catherine. 

After the sun went down, Duke pointed at a tree and said "you wanna race?" I don't think he heard me say no because he immediately ran into the forest, yelling "whoever reaches the tree last is a dork!"

I sighed, while still sitting at the same place. After a while I got worried when he didn't return, I didn't tell any adults because I was worried I'd get scolded too. Instead, I went alone to look for him. 
I yelled his name while making my way through thick snow. "Duke!! You okay?!?" No answer. 
"I swear if this is a prank, I'll kill you!!" I screamed again. 

As I stopped to catch my breath, I realized I had lost all my sense of orientation. I was lost. 
Everywhere I looked, I saw dense bushes and trees, I was completely exposed, without any protection. 
It felt like there were eyes, watching me. 

 As panic began to set in, I heard footsteps.
Someone was tip-toeing in the snow. 
"Duke, please come out, im scared now" I said, but this time in a quiet muffled voice. 

The footsteps were getting closer, still tip-toeing.
This time when I turned back, I saw a pair of eyes watching me, without blinking, without any bloodlust, just staring. 

Someone touched my shoulder, I jumped. 
"Woah relax bro" It was Duke. 
I saw the eyes dissapearing again. "I have been looking for you, for the past 10 minutes" Duke said while catching his breath. 
"Well, I was looking for you." I replied, while still shivering. "Did you see anything weird while looking for me?"
"Woah you're sweating and shivering, who did you see? Santa Claus?" Duke chuckled. 
"N-no. Forget about it." I knew that if I told him about what I saw, he would go looking for it. 

We heard my father screaming out our names, calling for dinner. 
To this day I can't confirm if this was real or just made up by my panicked mind, but as we were leaving, I heard 
"S-s-santa.....C-claus, chr-chistmas."

We obviously got a long lecture after reaching home, but because it was Christmas, we were let off easy. 
"I heard you two went into the forest, honestly, I could see Duke doing such thing, but you Ethan, I always thought you were a good kid" Catherine jumped out of the kitchen with an angry expression. 

Before I could say anything, Duke interrupted "yea, and we saw Santa Claus, come on, tell him Ethan."
"It wasn't san-" 
"Santa isn't real, grow up." Catherine interrupted me, and then walked away to help the adults with setting the dinner table. 

Dinner was delicious, especially after all that running in the forest. Duke leaned over to my ear and quietly whispered "you still wanna stay awake waiting for Santa, right?"
"Yes" I whispered back. 
The decorations throughout the house, the amazing food and the non stop chattering made me forget about everything that happened. 

Before I knew it, it was time for bed. The kids got their separate room, Duke had a huge grin on his face when he heard this, it was basically a free pass for him to do any shenanigans he wanted. 

The three of us were playing some board games till 2:20 AM, yes we somehow managed to convince Catherine to stay up that late. 
Duke said he had to go and pee, after 10 minutes passed, we both went to go check up on him, and found out he wasn't in the bathroom. 
Until we saw him coming into the house through the window.
 
"You go outside to pee?" I asked. 
"What do you think you're doing, why did you go outside" Catherine screamed at him, but in a muffled voice. 
"I heard a noise outside so I had to go check it out" Duke replied. 
We turned to go up to our room while Catherine was still going on about what Duke did. 

"Tomorrow morning, I will tell everyone what you did, let's see if you'll laugh then, you just wai-"
**THUD! THUD! THUD!**

My heart sank as I heard the noise. 
We all froze right in our place, someone was banging on the door, not just banging, punching. 
**THUD! THUD! THUD!**
"W-who's there?" Duke was the first one to speak. 
"Santa Claus, M-merry Christmas." A very sharp voice replied from behind the door. 

The three of us looked at each other, eyes wide open with terror, as the thing behind the door sang "jingle bell" In a very twisted and improper way. 
**THUD! THUD! THUD!**
"S-s-santa Claus, got gifts."

When he stopped talking and banging, we heard him giggle, like a little child trying very hard to control his laughter but failing to do so. 

**THUD! THUD! THUD!**
He banged again, with more force this time, like he was getting impatient. 
Just as we thought the door was going to get ripped off, Catherine held my shoulder tightly and said "call your parents"
That was the moment I returned to my senses, I jolted up the stairs into my parents room. 

"Mom! Dad! Someone's trying to get in the house! Wake up!!!"
No answer. 
I shook my dad, "Dad, wake up! Someone's at the door!!"
Still no answer, I quickly ran out to call someone else but stopped dead in my tracks as I realized the knocking had stopped. 
It was immediately followed up by a loud bloodcurdling scream, I ran downstairs to see both of them frozen in fear, as a tall creature stood in front of them. 

The window, Duke didn't close the window after coming back inside. 

The creature was tall, hunched over, it was dressed up like Santa, drooling all over the floor. 
It was wearing the skin of a white old man, and underneath that skin was a decaying brown body, with antlers on his head, and deer skull for a face. 
It had a bag full of gifts in one hand, trying very hard to mimic Santa, but failing.

It leaned over to Catherine, who was still frozen in fear, only twitching as some drops of drool fell on her, it looked Catherine right in the eyes, and paused. 

It felt like an eternity of silence before the creature asked. 
"N-na-naughty or n-ni-nice?"  
Catherine didn't reply. 
"Hmm...... Nice..... Nice." The creature smiled while searching through his bag. 
He gave Catherine a big gift, and then immediately looked at me. 

I closed my eyes shut as I heard footsteps approaching, it asked me the same question. 
"Naughty or nice?" This time in a clear voice. 
I didn't say anything, I opened my eyes to see him inches away from my face. 

I could smell the rotten scent of the skin he was wearing, and underneath that.... The hollow eyes stared at me. 
"Naughty." My heart dropped. 
"Or nice." He giggled, after seeing the reaction on my face. 
The creature noticed the tears beginning to form in my eyes, and finally said "Nice."

He handed me a gift, almost the size of my head. It was wrapped up in a really messy way, like the person who wrapped it was doing it for the first time. 

Finally, it moved towards Duke. 
But this time there was no question, the creature stiffened up and blew some steam out of its nose. 
It said in an angry tone, "NAUGHTY!!!"
It grabbed duke's leg and began pulling him, we tried our best to move but we just stood there, as we heard Duke scream and cry for his life. 
He begged the creature, he apologized, but the creature dragged him through the window. 

Glass shards pierced his entire body and he screamed even louder. 
He screamed our name, begging us to save him, telling us how much it hurts, but we couldn't move. 

Soon his voice drowned out, into the forest. We finally moved. 
Everyone else woke up a few minutes later only to find us both crying in a corner, with eyes wide open in fear. 
We told them what happened, and they called the police. They followed the trail of blood into the forest but found nothing. 

Later that day we opened the gifts it gave us, expecting something dangerous, but it was just flesh and skull of dead animals. Which is still messed up but not as bad as we thought it'll be. 

Everyone stayed there for a week or two, searching, but when we found no trace of Duke, everyone eventually decided to leave. 

Uncle Mike and my grandparents decided to move in with Catherine's family for a while, till they found a new house, away from this place. 
As we were packing up our stuff into the car, I saw Duke's parents, they had dark circles under their eyes and a defeated look on their face. 
His mom cried at random intervals and his dad had to comfort her.

It took me and Catherine half a decade of therapy to get rid of the nightmares, eventually everyone moved on with our lives but not us.
