I’m finally here!

This has been a trip that I’ve been planning for years. 

Firstly, a bit of background. My name is Caleb, I’m 19 years old, and I’m originally from Canada, but have grown up my whole life in Melbourne, Australia. That’s because my parents are crazy about nature and moved to Australia when I was young in an effort to save the Great White Shark population. Now, whilst they’ve established themselves as well-respected shark conservationists, I’m wanting to start my own legacy to help the planet. So, I’ve found myself, finally, in Malaysia, the Sabah region to be exact, on the island of Borneo, to start my efforts in helping save the rainforest. 

The planning from this trip began years ago, in 2019, when I was reading forums about families being affected by the tearing down of the rainforest in these regions. On one of these forums, I met a man called Ketill, who lives in Iceland. He shares the same passion as me and we often talked about going to South East Asia and helping to find ways to sustain these beautiful rainforests. However, we both agreed that we’d first like to experience living off of the rainforest first-hand, to fully understand its importance. So, we’d posted online countless times seeking this experience, and that’s when, just last year, we were contacted by Asri, a man who lives deep within the rainforest with his wife, Siti, and their young child, Haziq. Asri told us that he would be happy for myself and Ketill to stay with him and his family for as long as we wanted, that he would be happy to show us the importance of the rainforest and how to live off of it.

Which brings me to the present day - myself and Ketill are eagerly waiting for the water taxi to pick us up.  Ketill and I have travelled together for the past 2 weeks and were already good friends. His long blond hair provides a contrast to my short brown cut, and his blue eyes are always wide with excitement from the minute he wakes up right up until he falls asleep. He clings onto his blue rucksack and he paces, waiting for the boat to come and pick us up. Asri had said that the water taxi only makes this journey once a fortnight, so to be prepared for that. He also said there is very little to no phone signal where he stays. I was surprised there was any at all to be honest.

Ketill and I wait by a little fishing village that we had to take multiple buses to reach. Along the village runs a river; dark brown water rushes by, leading into a gap in the trees that flows deep into the surrounding rainforest. The tall green trees act as a shelter to the river, towering over it, protecting it from the sun and the rain. I look downstream along the river and see something approaching.

“The taxi is here!”, Ketill excitedly exclaims as a little speed boat comes trudging up the river toward us. I notice the frail man driving the boat appear surprised as we waved him down. He must not come across many tourists out here. 

“Hello”, I speak as the boat pulls up beside us, “we are looking to go to the house of Asri Fadilah?”, I ask. Asri assured us that the boat driver would know what we mean.

“Ah!” the boat driver exclaims, “Asri?”

“Yes”, I reply, “Asri.”

The driver ushers us in and we begin the long journey up the water, going ever deeper into the rainforest.

Two hours have passed. 

We have driven by a number of small, riverside villages. Local Malaysians were washing themselves in the river, fishing, harvesting leaves from nearby trees, and cutting fruit from their branches. The importance of the rainforest has already shown itself to me. The locals all wave at us as we pass them; they appear to be a very kind and welcoming people. 

The sounds of the rainforest are constant, but ever-changing. Crickets chirp in harmony with the songs of a thousand birds, wind rustles through the trees, to our hair and back again, and the call of monkeys ring from the distance on repeat. It is calming, beautiful, comforting. 

The river is winding, never-ending. It’s astounding how deep into the rainforest we have travelled. After a while, it has become extremely clear how people get lost in places like this; it all looks so similar, and just keeps on going and going. It’s getting dark now, and just as I start to build up the courage to ask the quiet driver how much further we have to travel, he points to a clearing in the trees that’s nestled alongside the river. Banana trees sit either side of the clearing providing a picturesque change in the ever-stretching wall of trees and brushes that line the rest of the river. 

As he pulls up beside the clearing, he ushers us off of the boat and says, “This is Asri here”.

We thank the driver and pay him what he asks. No sooner than we pay him, does he drive off at speed. 

Ketill and I turn around and see a man walking down a small muddy slope behind us. He is frail, similarly built to the boat driver, however hosts a large smile on his face. He is tanned, with short dark hair. He wears a raggedy red t-shirt with the faded words ‘OHIO’ on the front of it, black shorts, and white slippers. He swats a fly away from his face as he reaches his hand out toward us, shaking both of our hands.

“My friends!” he exclaims, “Welcome!” 

He glances over to the banana trees beside us, putting his hand on my back and guiding me up the small mound of mud he had just traversed down. He eagerly leads the way and within minutes we reach a small, stilted wooden house. The house towers over us, around 10 feet high, its stilts bearing its weight well. As difficult as it is to explain this, the house appears run down but also very sturdy; as if it has faced a thousand storms, but still stands strong. It is in a small clearing surrounded by rain forest, with a washing line beside it strewn with clothes, and a small outhouse beside that. There are also cages of chickens nestled by a nearby tree.

As we climb the thin rickety staircase up toward the veranda of the house, a woman appears. She is smiling and holding a glass plate of assorted fruit toward us. She is petite, and wears her dark hair tied up in a bun. She wears clothes similar to Asri, although her flip flops appear far more worn down than his.

“Hello, welcome”, she smiles, offering us the fruit, “I am Siti. Welcome to our home”

Siti asks us to take our shoes off on the small terrace, which we do, before showing us inside.

The house inside consists of four rooms; a main living area, a kitchen area, and Siti and Asri’s bedroom. The fourth room, I am unsure of what it’s for, as the door is partially blocked by a small cabinet and table. Siti shows us where we will sleep, two small mattresses in the main room of the house. 

Ketill and I place our bags down and I wipe the sweat from my brow as my eyes scan the wooden walls of the room. Small shutters cover the windows, a strange mask hangs from one of the walls, and a series of spears sit beside the front door which I assume are used for fishing.

Siti soon comes out of the kitchen area - “Makanan”, she smiles, which I know means it’s time for food.

As I lay on my mattress, I think back to the delicious meal Siti had made us – fresh fish, rice, and a spicy sambal sauce. Asri and Siti had spoken about their day-to-day life out here, about what’s important to them, and about how they have learned to speak English so well. They are both very kind. But now, it is dark and Ketill and I lay beside each other trying to get some sleep, listening to the constant noise of the rainforest.

“Ketill”, I whisper, not wanting to wake our hosts, “where is their son, Haziq?”

“I was thinking that,” Ketill replies, “Not really something we can easily ask. Maybe we’ll see him tomorrow. Maybe he’s asleep in that room.”

I look over to the door that's blocked. Strange. Why would they block up that room with furniture if he was just sleeping? 

“Hm,” I say, “maybe. I suppose we should try and get some sleep, I imagine we’ll be up pretty early”

Ketill murmurs incoherently; he’s fallen asleep already. How does he do that?

I wake to the sound of distant laughter. 

My eyes creep awake. It takes a second to establish my bearings in this new environment. I check my watch.

*12:13am.*

My eyes begin to shut, and then I hear it once more.

A laugh, a woman’s laugh. It’s quick, and quiet. It sounds as if it’s very far away, that I am only just on the cusp of hearing it. I groggily sit up and walk over to one of the window shutters and peek through it. I see nothing but dark trees and now hear nothing but – 

Wait. I can’t hear anything.

No crickets, no sound. In most places, at this hour that’s normal, but out in the rainforest that doesn’t sit right with me. Why is it so silent?

I hear the same woman’s laugh again; this time, ever so slightly louder. 

Ever so slightly *closer*.

My eyes are wide now and have adjusted to the darkness within the trees. Shadows stretch toward the house, casting themselves along the grass below, lit by an almost full moon. As my vision improves, I should feel less scared. However, the longer I stare, the more I feel like…

The more I feel like someone is watching me.

The more I feel like *something* is watching me.

*The more I feel that something is very, very wrong.*

I turn back, scurrying to Ketill over the floorboards the creak beneath my feet. 

“Ketill”, I hiss, “Wake up”.

Just as I say that, the laughter quietly drifts through the air once more. It is a soft, calm laughter; almost as if it were a song. A sweet smell fills the air, becoming stronger by the second.

"Ketill!", I whisper harshly. 

Please wake up. The feeling of dread grows.

“What?” Ketill sluggishly asks.

As soon as Ketill speaks, the smell is gone.

As soon as Ketill speaks, the crickets chirp once more, the sounds of the rainforest return like a roaring chorus.

As soon as Ketill speaks, the feeling of dread leaves my body, the feeling of being watched subsides.

“What?” Ketill repeats himself.

“N-nothing”, I begin, “I – I think I just had the creeps for a second, I thought – It’s nothing…”

I crawl back onto my mattress, wiping sweat from above my lip. 

I’m not sure if I’ll be able to get to sleep tonight.

My eyes dart to the door which is [blocked by the furniture.](https://www.reddit.com/r/squishycabbage/)
