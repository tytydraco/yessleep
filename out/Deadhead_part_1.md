I came to, disoriented. The air was unnaturally crisp and sterile, cold as a hospital. The bed I was on was firm and centered in the back of the massive room. On either side of the bed was a bunch of medical equipment I didn’t recognize. Rubbing my eyes, I noticed the bracelet on my left wrist. It bore a barcode and the tag ‘S-41’. I was no longer myself; I was Subject 41

After studying the tag, I waited. I paced the confines of the room, the silence stretching into hours. I wondered if the waiting itself was the first experiment. To keep the fear at bay, I focused on the why—the reason I ended up here: my family.

For reasons I will not mention, I invested all my money into a bitcoin company without telling my wife. The investment failed, and I lost everything. When my wife found out, she took my daughter and my son and left the house. I looked for ways to get them back, but my wife said that unless we get all our money back, she would not be coming back. I tried everything I could think of to do, but it was never enough. That’s when I found an ad online for participating in a medical study. It said that study participants would be compensated up to $1.5 million. Catching my attention, I immediately responded. Right after I answered, I got an email saying it could take up to a month to get a response. Needless to say, I waited with high anxiety for weeks. On day 28 of waiting, I got an email asking me to meet at an address. 

The address was to a rundown house that looked like a crack den. I was about to leave when a bodybuilding-looking man in a military outfit came out. He validated who I was before asking me to follow him. I was very uneasy and said I was going to. The man stared at me intensely, and I was more scared to leave then. I got out and followed him into the two-story crack house. The scent of piss, mold, burning plastic, and ammonia was in the air. Stained mattresses and syringes were randomly spread throughout the house. I was guided up the stairs into a room at the end of the hallway. Inside was a desk with an older, much less in shape, military man. He politely asked me to sit, and we went back and forth with pleasantries. Eventually, we got into the medical study, and I was only told it was top secret. He then asked me to check my bank account on my bank's app, and I saw $200,000 there. The military man then told me that he researched my background and finances, and the results qualified me for $1.5 million in compensation.

I immediately agreed, signing the paperwork. I was then escorted to a bathroom that looked like a darkroom under humming fluorescent lights. I remember a chemical smell... nothing more. The next thing I knew, I was waking up in the white room. I began to look around. There were cameras in every corner and on the sleek white walls. In the corner to my left was a toilet and a sink; they resembled those you find in a prison. Above me was a round grate, possibly about 2 inches in diameter.   

The well-lit room was eerie, but the silence was paralyzing. It was a total void, broken only by a low, mechanical hum and my shallow breathing. After sitting there for what felt like hours, the door finally opened. I stood up as a clean-shaven older man with short and sleek white hair, wearing a lab coat, walked in. He had a clipboard with him, and as he entered, the door closed, and he put the clipboard and his hands behind his back. I stood to shake his hand, but he simply extended his palm—a stiff, commanding gesture—and signaled me to sit back down. I felt a surge of annoyance, but quickly suppressed it. This, I realized, was exactly what I had signed up for.

“Formalities are not necessary, Subject 41. My designation is D-Alpha 1. You will refer to me as Dr. Alpha”, he said in a monotone voice. His eyes looked dead and annoyed as if I was wasting his time. I tried to respond again, but I was quickly interrupted. “I must remind you, subject 41, there will be no talking unless we allow it. For the sanctity of the experiment, we must not allow deviations, so please refrain from talking.” Dr. Alpha stared at me like a snake looking at its prey before it strikes. Though extremely annoyed and getting upset, I shook my head to allow Dr Alpha to continue. He looked down at his clipboard and began talking again.  

“You have signed an agreement to participate in an experiment of a top-secret nature. The lead researcher on the team will provide all communication; the code name is D-Alpha1, also known as Dr. Alpha. All other staff interaction will be done as a requirement for the experiment only. There will be times within this experiment that you will suffer mental, emotional, and extreme physical pain. At no point will any member of the research team attempt to console or help you in any way unless deemed necessary for the experiment. Upon completing the experiment, you, Subject 41, will be rewarded 1.5 million dollars. Once the experiment begins, subject 41 may not opt out and must complete the experiment.”  

Dr Alpha lifted his head and stared at me with no emotion. The looks he continued to give me made me nervous. “Subject 41, this will be your final opportunity to opt out of the experiment”, Dr Alpha stated as he looked down at his watch. “You have one minute to state yes, if you wish to proceed, or no, if you wish to leave. Failure to respond with a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ will forfeit the experiment. One minute is starting now”.  

My thoughts raced as I tried to consider continuing or not. The best outcome would be that I would complete the experiment and be able to have the money to pay off my debts and get my family back. The worst outcome, I tried not to think about. However, the thought kept clouding my judgment. “Dr. Alpha, is there a chance I may die?” I asked with uncertainty and immense fear. He didn't respond, his gaze an unblinking flat line. He simply watched the timer on his wrist. “30 seconds subject 41,” he said in his monotone voice. I felt fully uneasy at this point, but wanting my family back kept my motivation going. If I continued, there is no doubt I may die. However, without my family in my life, I would be better off dead. It seemed to be the best option under the circumstances: “Yes, I will continue”, I said.

Dr Alpha then opened the door, looked back at me, and said, “The experiment will now begin”, before closing and locking the door.
