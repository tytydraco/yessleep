It was not the heat that troubled me first, nor the silence, nor even the way the horizon refused to settle into a single line. It was the door.

I had been moving eastward across the gravel plain since dawn, following a wash that did not appear on any map I possessed. The land there was composed of low stones bleached to a uniform pallor, interrupted only by creosote and the occasional basalt outcrop that rose like the knuckles of a buried hand. There were no tracks but my own. Even the wind seemed reluctant to leave a mark.

I cannot say when I first noticed the door. Only that at some point I became aware of its presence ahead of me, as one becomes aware of a thought that has been circling the mind for some time without form. It stood upright in the open desert, unsupported, casting a narrow shadow that did not quite align with the sun.

It was an ordinary door, in the sense that its proportions were familiar. Wood, weathered gray, paneled, with a metal knob dulled by age. No frame. No wall. No hinge I could see affixed to anything other than the door itself. Behind it was nothing I could describe with confidence. Not darkness exactly. Not light. Simply an absence that resisted the eye.

I stopped some distance away, seized by a conviction that I had already made some irrevocable mistake.

The desert, which until then had been mute, seemed to arrange itself around the object. The stones no longer appeared random. The low hills suggested angles I did not care to measure. I felt, without understanding why, that the door had not been placed there but had arrived, the way certain ideas arrive, unbidden and immune to dismissal.

I told myself that heat and solitude were sufficient explanations. That the mind, deprived of distraction, invents structure where none exists. Yet I could not escape the sense that the door was complete in a way the surrounding world was not. It had intention.

I circled it slowly. The wood bore marks that might have been scratches or might have been symbols worn smooth by time. When I tried to focus on them, my thoughts wandered, not away but sideways, into considerations that had no language. The knob was warm to the touch, though the air itself felt thin and brittle.

There was no sound when I placed my hand upon it. No vibration. No resistance. Still, I hesitated, overcome by the certainty that the act of opening was not the primary transgression. That something had already noticed me.

I became aware then of a pressure, subtle but persistent, as if the desert were leaning inward. The horizon trembled. The sky seemed too close. I thought of thresholds not as passages but as wounds, and of doors not as invitations but as admissions.

I did not open it. I am certain of that. Yet when I turned away, the wash behind me no longer ran where it had before. The sun occupied an angle I could not reconcile with the time. And somewhere, very faintly, I thought I heard the sound of a latch being tested from the other side.

I write this now with the door no longer in sight. Or perhaps it is closer than ever. The desert offers no reassurance either way. There are places, I suspect, where the land itself has learned to wait.
