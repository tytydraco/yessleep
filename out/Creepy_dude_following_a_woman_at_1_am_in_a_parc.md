Hey Reddit, I had this crazy encounter last night and I need to vent/talk about it.  
  
I went for a walk at around 12:15 in the night. About 3km from home I cross a bridge and enter a parc. Right across that bridge was someone on a scooter in the bike lane. Right there that's kinda yikes but whatever I'm not going to get into a fight with him for that.  
  
I walk past him and about 20s later I hear him ask someone if they want a ride. A feminine voice answers no. The guy insists. The woman sais a clear No for the second time. My blood is racing at this point. Is this dude going to harass her? Should I intervene?  
  
He passes me from behind and scoots off. I'm releived. Great. I continue my walk slightly disturbed by how uncomfortable she must feel.  
  
About 1 km later, the guy on his scooter passes me again from behind. At that point I'm sure he's up to no good. He stops a little further where there's an intersection.  
  
I fear for this woman's safety at this point. I don't know what to do. She doesn't know me, I can't just walk up and offer to walk her home, I could be just as much a threat for all she knows.  
  
So I decide to pick a direction at the intersection and I scoot behind a bush once I'm out of sight and I observe.  
  
The woman whom had been walking behind me decided to pick the other direction at the intersection. The scooter guy is still halted where he stopped, maybe I'm just being paranoid I think to myself.  
  
I decide to sit there for 30s just to be sure. Sure enough, he gets on the move again in the direction she went.  
  
I pick up the pace and follow him. My blood is racing. The adrenaline is through the roof. I'm certain this man has nefarious intentions.  
  
There were more intersections shortly after where we had stopped, I lost sight of the woman and don't know which direction she went, so I follow the scooter guy. He gains quite a bit of distance on me, I was around \~1-2 min walk behind the woman at that point.  
  
I lose sight of him, he wanders off into the different paths in the parc. Sure enough, I see him again a few times circling around looking for her.  
  
I catch a glimpse of the woman again. She's leaving the parc and heading into a not-so-well lit street. I also see the scooter guy, whom also just saw her again.   
  
He hasn't catched on yet that I've been following him. I see him follow the woman while keeping a distance of about 100m from her.   
  
I pick up the pace and follow them into the street. The scooter guy is very obviously stalking her, "hiding" behind cars and seemingly waiting for an opportunity or something? Idk, I have no clue what's going on in his deranged head.  
  
I'm 100% certain this woman is not safe at this point. I could shout something to catch her attention and try and explain what I saw but honestly it's 1am and I'm a stranger, for all she knows I could be an accomplice of that freak.  
  
I decide to shout something at him and confront him about his actions, making sure to speak loud enough so she can hear me. There's also a few people outside on their porches, it's the national holiday here today so people are up late partying.  
  
He denies he's been following her, seems very taken aback and annoyed that I intervened. I tell him to leave her alone and that he's followed her more than enough. He denies everything with a snark on his face. I tell him he's a fucking creep and disgusting human being and I start to move along. He then proceeds to threaten to run over me with his scooter ü§∑ü§¶ What a loser. I'm pissed nonetheless, he's making my adrenaline shoot up and I just want to disengage and go on my way.  
  
He starts following me around like he was doing to her, shouting that he'll remember my face. Telling me that I was following her just as much as he was. (There it is! He finally admitted what he was doing). I tell him off, smack my ass and ask him if he's liking the view. It's at that point that he drove off trying to find the woman again.  
  
The altercation lasted about 5 min. Hopefully it was enough for the woman to escape him. I think I saw her head into the next bar after she (hopefully) heard me challenge the creep.  
  
I continued walking around for a bit. Saw neither of them again. I hope that woman is safe.  
  
I forgot to mention at the start but I had left my phone at home without noticing. I wish I could of filmed him following her and called the authorities. I did the best I could given the situation.   
  
This all happened close to my home. I hope that freak never finds out where I live. I'd be scared he'll come vandalise the property or harass me or my family. Hopefully I never see him again.  
  
Had to get this off my chest. Crazy night. I don't think I'll be able to sleep anytime soon.  
  
Stay safe out there people. ‚ù§Ô∏è  
  
English isn't my first language, sorry if some wording sounds odd.
