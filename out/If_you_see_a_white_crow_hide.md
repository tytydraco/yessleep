I don’t know whether any of you will give a damn about what I say. Hell, most of you won’t believe me, and I can’t blame you. Truth be told, I would do the same. No, I won’t convince any of you about what happened to me, but at least I can share it.

Not just to get off my chest, but to warn someone out there. For the slime chance you ever see a white crow fly above you, landing on a tree branch or wire, observing the people below it, perhaps you will remember my words. Perhaps you will believe me in this one instance.

Don’t look at them. Don’t wave at them. Do nothing to attract their attention. Turn around and make sure you’re out of their sight. There is no fighting them. They will always find prey, but it doesn’t have to be you. Trust me.

I wish someone had told me the same.

…

At first, I found it beautiful. An albino in every species is a rare sight, but in a crow, it seemed to have something magical about it. I looked it up, and a lot of mythology interpreted them as divine messengers or omens of good luck. Back then, I couldn’t have agreed more. It just seemed to be… more. I don’t know how I could truly explain it.

I was on my way to school when it landed on a house nearby, watching the people hurrying past without noticing it. I stopped, pausing the music I was listening to. I was still a freshman at my high school, and time was running against me, but I couldn’t help myself. Who doesn’t love animals? Beautiful ones in particular.

Without thinking much about it, I got my phone out, zoomed in on the bird to get a better view of it, and took a photo. Right before I pressed the button, it twisted its head around, staring right at me as my phone’s camera went on.

Not gonna lie, it startled me. Not because it had any weird features or appeared more menacing than at first glance now that it looked at me. It was just that it noticed me. I had made no sound, and the crow was a decent distance away from me. By all means, I should have remained an unknown to the bird.

But now that it had laid eyes on me, it couldn’t stop staring at me. I moved a bit further up the street, changing directions, even jumping around; the crow’s head followed my every move. It seemed quite funny. Its eyes darted around to keep track of me. Not something you would expect from a wild animal. A cartoon, for sure, but not a random crow.

I giggled to myself and waved at the crow, before running towards my school. During the breaks between lessons, if I wasn’t busy talking to my friends, I looked up facts on crows. The white one had caught my interest, and I wanted to know more about them. Did you know that crows are extremely intelligent? They can hold grudges for quite a while, bond with people, and even hold some sort of funerals.

Fascinating animals, but I thought that the white crow would remain nothing but an interesting encounter. Something to be fondly remembered from time to time. So you can imagine my surprise when I encountered the very same crow sitting at my high school’s entrance, observing me as I left.

I wouldn’t have noticed it if one of my friends hadn’t pointed it out. A lot of other students from all grades watched the bird with great interest, but it had only eyes for me. I couldn’t believe my luck and took a few more photos before saying my goodbyes to my friends.

At my home, I didn’t share too much with my parents about the bird. Why would I? I was a fifteen-year-old dipshit, embarrassed by even a passing association with my parents and family at large. Nah, I went straight to my room and examined the photos I made of the bird.

There was something special about the crow, that I knew from the beginning, but not just its appearance. It seemed unusual. The photos confirmed my mild suspicion. It was a bird, all right, but it appeared a bit too smart. I know that sounds weird, but you have to trust me on this one.

By all accounts, it was a crow. Nothing you haven’t seen before. But it was its eyes. Again, the eyes of a crow, but they had a spark in them that shouldn’t have been there. Yeah, they were supposed to be intelligent but nothing on the level of perceiving things as we humans do. And to me, it seemed like this crow could.

This is something you have to experience yourself to truly understand. At this time, I had thought my encounter with the crow a bit odd but nothing out of the ordinary. As I was about to go to bed and close my window’s curtain, that changed.

This dumb crow was sitting on a tree branch right outside my window, watching me for lord knows how long. My guts told me immediately that something was off with this bird. There was intent behind it eyes. Something beyond the mental capabilities of a common animal. No, this was something different.

I closed my curtains, cursing under my breath. Perhaps this was all my imagination. Like a toddler, I thought if the problem was out of my sight it had vanished for good. That night, I didn’t get much sleep. And the little sleep I got, the crow haunted them, flying circles above them, waiting for its chance to feast upon me.

I woke up in a cold sweat, immediately feeling the effects of my nightmares. When I went to school that day, it started. At first, it wasn’t something to pay much of my mind to. But in the following weeks, it only worsened.

The way people looked at me changed. Their eyes narrowed, their heads half-turned, ready to exchange whispers. As soon as they could, they watched me, staring holes in the back of my head. When I noticed, they turned away, laughing between themselves. Confused, I constantly checked myself in the mirror. Did my hair look weird? Did I have something stuck between my teeth? Did I forget to zip up?

I couldn’t find anything, which made things only worse. Was something so obviously wrong with me that everyone around me noticed it except for myself? Did my obliviousness to my inaptness make the entire thing even more hilarious?

It didn’t stop with looks, though. Every conversation, as insignificant as it might have been, turned into this uncomfortable mess. My tone, my phrasing, how I pronounced words; it all was wrong and off to my surroundings. No matter who I interacted with, stranger or old friend, they all left with a worse opinion of me than when they entered.

The hostility towards me was tangible. With each new day, I lost more of my social standing, creeping closer and closer to becoming a true outcast. All the while I couldn’t tell what happened. The transition was so slow that I couldn’t point to a single thing that would explain the shift.

After hearing this, you might think that this sounds like normal social anxiety. Heck, you might have gone through something similar. Always believing the judging eyes of the people around you, stalking you like prey. For my age, something like that is not completely out of the ordinary.

But the fucking white crow was. Without missing a day, it followed me around, never losing me. Out of all the hostile glances that pursued me, it was the most persistent. It always tried to find a way to stare at me. When I walked to school it flew above me. When school lessons began, it landed on a branch and watched through the window. When I went to bed and closed the curtains, it remained there as if its vision could pierce through the fabric.

I tried to get rid of the damn birds more times than I could count. I threw stones at it. I used my broom to scare it off when it was standing in front of my window. Nothing worked. Hell, it made things worse. People saw me attacking the white crow, and their dislike of me intensified.

Once I thought of taking my dad’s gun, finding an isolated space in the woods, and putting a bullet in this thing. But at this point, it was already too late. All these weeks to months of constant social scrutiny affected my perception. If I’d taken the gun and done it, people would have found out. What would they think of me? How could I justify myself from shooting a white crow?

All the names that they must have been called me; they would have another reason to use them. No, they would be justified in making new ones. Names that sting even deeper. Would they use them on me in the open? Would they start to bully me? Would I sign my fate as an outcast by shooting the bird?

I have a question. Have you ever seen how bigger carnivores hunt prey that lives in bigger herds? Herds so big, that they have no chance of fighting them. They find a weaker individual and isolate it. Once cut away from the herd, there is nothing their prey can do but wait for its inevitable death.

 I came to see the white crow as such a predator. I don’t know where it came from, whether they are an entire species, or why they focused on humans. Truth be told, I don’t wanna know. But what I know, the white crow has specialized in hunting humans.

Think about it. We are social creatures. Belonging to a group is one of our deepest drives. Only in communities are we safe from what stalks the dark. This desire is so crucial that it shapes our very perception of reality. How you are perceived is your reality. Without the group, you will die, so you have to do everything in your power to stay in it.

So, what if something could meddle with this perception? What if a predator could manipulate how you interpret your social surroundings? It would be very successful.

Everything I have described up until now could be explained by other means than something hunting me and fucking with my head. I did so, too, thinking myself mad for blaming some bird with a weird obsession with me. Heck, perhaps the bird was nothing but a product of my slipping sanity. As it didn’t stop with the people around me, I knew for certain something of the ordinary was happening to me.

At that time, I had developed a fear of interacting with people. Even something as simple as ordering something at a store necessitated me to craft a script of what I would say, choosing my words carefully to not appear like a weirdo. It didn’t help.

To keep the judgment from everyone to a minimum, I evaded every social situation that I could. But in the few interactions I couldn’t avoid, I noticed my capability to grasp social cues started to evaporate. So much of our interactions occur in the unsaid, the lingering knowledge hidden between our words that needs not to be uttered. As I said, we are highly calibrated to navigate complex group dynamics.

If the group dies, you die. It is as easy as that. To prevent that from occurring, every group needs a set of rules that can’t be broken. Every individual who threatens the group at its very core has to be punished accordingly. Some of these rules are written down. I didn’t struggle with them. No, the implicit were the ones that became a mystery to me.

Breaking them wouldn’t be legally punished but socially. It would show, you haven’t understood something as basic as reading the group you moved in and its rich culture. You would prove yourself an outlier unshackled by the boundaries the group bestows upon its members. And without them, lord knows what you could do. There would be no way to tell.

It started with not getting jokes. I still hang around my friends despite the looks they gave me. Due to politeness, they didn’t want to tell me to fuck off, so they tolerated me. Without them, I would have no one so I stayed, but I struggled to follow their conversations.

Not about what was said, but why they reacted the way they did. They mostly shared funny stories or made crude jokes. I understood the logic in their words, but why did they laugh? Why did they shake their heads and change the topic? Sometimes they were ranting about something only to shift into making fun of it.

None of it made sense to me. It was like watching a foreign species of creatures communicate. I had a grasp of what happened. I saw their emotions and knew what they meant but everything deeper remained a black box to me. One time I asked why they laughed, and one of my friends explained the joke to me with a frown after realizing I really didn’t get it.

After that, their looks gained a certain pity for me. Still, mostly dislike, though. This didn’t stop with my friends. My parents, my class, my teachers. Even little exchanges on the street. I failed to navigate the current, pushing and shoving me around without me understanding why.

I lost any sense of direction. I wasn’t just isolated anymore, I was a stranger to it, at the mercy of something I couldn’t decipher. How was I supposed to act? When I failed to properly articulate myself before, now it became impossible. Sometimes what I said seemed appropriate and the looks lessened, but more often I was punished for opening my mouth by silent ridicule.

That remained untouched. I could perfectly tell that everyone was laughing at me. No, it got even keener. When all my other senses seemed to dull, this one sharpened, registering even the slightest jest against me. Devoid of everything else, their mockery of me became my only concern.

But how was I supposed to prevent this when I couldn’t fathom them anymore? And all along, the crow watched me. No one seemed to notice it anymore, or they paid it no mind. Once it might have been something special but now it had become a regular occurrence.

Gosh, those eyes. I never wanted to harm an animal, but you can’t imagine what I would do to that crow. If there was at least a hint of malice. Something to show its true intent, unveiling it as the demon it was. But no. They remained as much of a mystery to me as the people around me.

Despite all this, I had at least my mind and my thoughts. Or so I wished, but the crow now had me where it wanted and caused the next change. Like all of this, it didn’t happen at once, but slowly. Day by day, the changes were so insignificant that no one would notice them until it was too late.

The crow took my ability to express myself. At first, my mental capacities worked the same, but my tongue refused to properly articulate them. Before, I didn’t know how to phrase them or say them in the exact tone I wanted. Now, I just couldn’t.

When my parents were asking me about my day, and I wanted to describe my lessons and what happened, I could only do so in the simplest way possible. Any complex sentence was impossible for my mouth to figure out. Hundreds of words became unavailable to me, nothing but a distant memory that could only live on in my head.

My parents and everyone else thought me standoffish. Like I couldn’t even care enough to answer them in earnest and only do the bare minimum to be left alone. One thing I will give the crow, it’s crafty. If the changes were too drastic, someone was bound to notice. So it kept everything under tight control, ensuring that no one what bat an eye to me changing before my eyes. Perhaps that’s why it chose me. Such behavior was to be expected from a teenager.

Before too long, I became a prisoner in my own body. My mind raged, aware of what happened to me, desperate to scream out for help, but I couldn’t get the message out. The connection to my own body was weakened, nothing but a meat puppet only reacting to the simplest orders.

If I describe these days like a fever dream, that wouldn’t even begin to scratch the surface. I was feeling my sanity dripping away. I don’t how often I wanted to cry. To sob bitterly about the injustice that took hold of me, but I wasn’t allowed any tears. My mind was left to rod in this head of mine, only able to watch decay while the white crow flew above like the scavenger it was, waiting for its chance.

While it took the control of my body away from me, I decided the best course of action would be to study the white crow. I used all my brain power to find anything about the creature from watching that could save me. This being was clearly supernatural. There had to be something.

But there wasn’t. Weeks I spent on figuring it out, but I’m quite convinced this thing never gave away its weak spot if there is any. No, nearly nothing changed in its behavior besides its cawing. It never had made a sound before. Hell, it never had pocked its beak against my mirror at night to mess with me or anything else.

I have long examined the beast for any signs of wickedness, and I thought to have them found in its caws. Its laughter at my desperate struggle against its will. I was soon to find out the true meaning behind it but before that, the white crow had another surprise ready for me.

I had hoped my mind to be my last bastion, save from my pursuers’ claws, and I shouldn’t have. I should have known that nothing was safe.

My very thoughts were melting away in front of me. I don’t know how else to describe it. My mind was beginning to slow down, every train of thought moving forward as if pushing through a mountain. A mental haze clouded my inner eye. Being in my head, the only place where I could truly be myself, became nothing but a slug. Like fighting myself through a quagmire that expanded always forward, claiming my world as its own.

I can’t give you much more than this. If my previous experience was a fever dream then this was a nightmare. I could barely tell what happened around me. I felt like mind mind-controlled. Perhaps the white crow took control of me to ensure no one would notice what happened. I don’t know. What I recall was that even at this point, I knew the crow was coming for me. Robbed of my mental capacities, this sensation stayed with me.

And with that, my last defense came crashing down. No social surroundings, no call for help, not even my wits. The white crow finally had me where it wanted and now the true meaning of its caw became apparent.

It wasn’t mocking me. It was a call. A call to feast.

Even in my reduced state, I can still recall the horror I felt when a second crow landed next to the white. This one was black, and it looked at me the same way the white one did. On the next day, two more crows came. And on the next, four.

Within a week an entire murder of crows had gathered around my vicinity. Countless black eyes stared at me, dark dots with no emotions behind them besides one. Hunger.

Now, all caution was forgotten. As I went to sleep that night, I woke up in a state between sleep and full awareness. I often had heard and read about sleep paralysis, but this was the first time it happened to me.

My tired eyes scanned through my room, trying to make head or tails of my situation. That’s when I saw the white crow standing on my chest. My window was closed. I hadn’t opened it since this all began. This demon came closer, moving its head around like any normal bird would, taking me in.

It came so close that I could directly look into its eyes. Nothing besides my own frightened reflection stared back. After it had examined me for long enough, it hammered its beak against my forehead. The pain echoed through my body, and I wanted to scream but my tongue froze in its place.

The white crow looked around itself as if searching for any potential predator before slamming its beak into my head again. This time, it pierced my flesh. I could feel how it scrapped against my skull, testing the thickness of it. Blood poured down my face as it ripped its beak free and hit down again.

The knocking against my skull became weaker and weaker as it successfully punched through it, digging right into my brain. I can’t even begin to describe the pain. The sensation of anything making its way through your head is not something I would even want any of you to experience through the safety of reading my accounts. Just let me tell you one thing, the worst was about to come.

As its beak had turned crimson with my blood, scraps of my brain clinging to its tip, the white crow cawed again. The murder followed its call, rushing through my window as if the glass wasn’t there. They moved as one body, an amalgamation as black as the night with hundreds of starving maws. They surged over me, and my world became pain.

From all sides, their beaks ripped through my flesh and devoured my brain. I couldn’t just feel the agony of being eaten alive by countless beasts, no, I felt my very mind being shredded. Like every single crow was pulling at my thoughts, stretching them outwards until they tore off. My very self, my sanity, the place I should call my own, burned as hot as hell itself.

I don’t know how long it went on. Even if my wits hadn’t been taken away from me beforehand, I didn’t truly exist during this night. No, I was nothing, but senses made to suffer. Only when the first sunlight hit them did the crows stop. My consciousness came back little by little. At first, I was puzzled. Hadn’t my entire world always been this pain? Freed from it, I regained my humanity back.

When I opened my eyes, I was cowering in my bed, drenched in sweat. And touched my head and grabbed my phone to look at myself. No wound, no signs of what I had endured. I went to the window. Closed, with the white crow in front of it, watching, its murder flying above. This one time, I stared back. You could lose yourself in the black of its eyes. Nearly a thing of beauty.

I slammed my curtains together. I wanted to cry, to sob like I hadn’t since childhood. But the white crow kept its hold on me. No tears for me.

By this time, I had been an outcast, barely speaking to anyone in school, so it wasn’t too strange for me to look at the ground the entire day, lost in my head. The night didn’t blur away like the rest of my thoughts. No, it stayed as sharp, as distinct, as when I had to endure it. I believe this to be another ploy of the white crow. My identity becoming a distant memory while my suffering should linger more closely than my shadow, always reminding me.

Though, I was wondering, despite my state, what were they eating? There was no sign of actual physical harm done to me. They seemed quite starved when they fell upon me, and they showed no restraint. But even then, I noticed it. I felt lesser. They hadn’t eaten my brain, they had eaten parts of my mind.

The next night, they came back. I was allowed a single groan before they were upon me again. As I stated before, this period is a mess to recall. I can’t say for how long this went on. Every time it happened, my sanity slipped further away from me. Diving into madness might have been the only escape for me. Diluting myself was the only tool left for me to operate. Better than having to face the murder every night again, feeling the beaks devour me each time anew.

However to become mad, one needed a mind, and I couldn’t say for how long I would have one. I felt it. I felt my thoughts missing, noticing gaps inside my mind. Despite the brutality and duration of the attacks, the crows didn’t seem to devour very much. Meaning, this would go on for a long time before they finished me.

And that was my world. When I was awake, I could do nothing but go through the motions and speak in the simplest terms to not cause any serious suspicion. The last shambles of my mind replayed the white crow leading its masses towards me, satiating themselves on me. And at night, they came for me, dragging me down into a fate no one deserves.

Until they didn’t. One night, the very night where it all stopped, only the white crow sat on my chest, watching me. After a few seconds of observing me, it jumped off me, flying out of the window, cawing. It wanted me to follow.

The white crow had broken me quite thoroughly, so I put on my clothes and followed like a good dog. It was around midnight, and the white crow flew above me, leading me where it wanted me to be. I had no idea what it had in mind. It was on its own, its murder being nowhere to be seen.

Though I would never trust this winged demon, I wouldn’t have dared to deny its will either. I could only imagine how it would react if I had refused. But to be fair, I can’t tell why it would do anything. Was this just an animal with supernatural abilities or a powerful curse given flesh to haunt innocent mortals? Hell, I couldn’t even tell whether it had any emotions I could truly understand.

This makes the crow so eerie to me. Not just what it did to me, but my inability to comprehend it. With most animals, you could find something that would link the two of you. Some would say, you give the animal too much humanity, making them into something they aren’t. Others might counter that we all function on the same premises and thus are connected fundamentally.

Whatever might be the case, you could behold most animals and grasp them. But I couldn’t with the white crow. Or perhaps I could and can. Perhaps it is just an animal having developed the most fucked way to hunt humans. But I didn’t feel this when looking into its eyes. But I also didn’t see the malice I would expect from something finding pleasure in tormenting others. There was nothing or at least nothing I could perceive.

And that freaked me out. If you can’t understand something, you can’t predict it. And if you can’t predict it, you can’t attempt to take any control. You were truly at its mercy.

I followed for around ten minutes until I released something. We were pursuing someone. To this day, I don’t know who he was or why the crow chose him. He seemed a bit older than me, but not old enough to be out of high school. He wore a thick coat and seemed keen to keep to himself.

The white crow kept its distance and wanted me to do the same, never closer than twenty feet. I noticed what we were doing after a few turns, always behind this guy. My guts cramped, and I got lightheaded. I had no idea what was going on but knowing my tormentor it couldn’t be anything good.

Without him ever noticing me, he arrived at the old children’s playground, got out a joint, and started to smoke it. I stayed behind a house, watching, as a few black crows flew in front of me, dropping something. I crouched down and grasped the kitchen knife. I could see my worn-down eyes in the reflection of the blade.

A caw caught my attention. The white crow sat on top of a wire, observing me. It cawed again, twitching, pointing with its beak at the guy we had followed. The first and only time this thing properly communicated with me.

I gulped, sweat drenching me. My breathing accelerated, and I thought I would faint any minute now. How could I do something like this? How could I even consider becoming a murderer at the behest of a fucking bird? My moral quarrels aside, I would go to prison for this. My family, my friends, every single person I ever knew would view me as a deranged monster.

I looked down at the blade again, examining my appearance. More ghost than man. Closer to death than life. How no one noticed that something was very clearly wrong with me, I couldn’t tell. My eyes, they looked so old. Ancient even. And not in a good way. There should have been a youthful spark in them and not a profound fear of existence itself.

As I hesitated, I saw through the reflection in the knife the white crow landing on the house behind me, its murder close by. They just started to appear, one by one haunting the night. You know what, I was wrong. The white crow communicated with me in earnest a second time. At this very moment, I could read the threat clearly. Either him or me.

I pocketed the knife and stalked towards the children’s playground. The guy didn’t notice me at first, twisting around when I stepped on a twig. He cursed; hand clutched to his chest. I asked whether I could have a drag. Once he knew there was no danger, he giggled, holding out the joint.

My heart was trying its best to claw its way out of my chest. I could feel all the blood going to my head, searching for another option. Any way to escape my hell and defeat the white crow without giving it what it wanted. There wasn’t any.

I grasped the guy’s hand, pulled him closer, and drove the knife deep into his belly. He let out a rasp of air, eyes wide. The shock had taken hold of him, immobilizing him for a few seconds. Enough time to rip my blade free and bury it again in his chest. Like a madman, I stabbed this stranger. All the anger and fear of the past months burst out of me, seeking revenge against anything.

I didn’t count how often I punched the knife into him, but he was dead halfway through. Once all my strength had been used, I fell on my knees, the guy’s corpse collapsing into the sand of the playground. His torso was a bloody mess littered with countless wounds, the blade still sticking out of his chest.

My hands were still shaking at first, but they became still quite fast. It was over. The realization hit me like a truck. My life was over. I had done the unthinkable. There was no going back. Or so I thought.

The white crow descended, landing on top of the knife’s handle. It blinked at me, having nothing to share and nothing to hide. An open book filled with nothing but blank pages. Its murder followed suit, leaping towards the fresh corpse. They swung around the wings as they picked at the dead stranger. I feared they would devour him right in front of me. But they did nothing of the sort.

They were lifting him, carrying him into the sky. I did nothing but watch. A storm of black wings climbing up towards the dark beyond. A few remained behind, using their feathers to clean up the blood. They threw themselves down and rolled around in the sand like you might expect from a dog but not a bird. They did so until no crimson was left and then they took flight, too, red wings ascending towards the sky.

Only the white crow remained. It cawed again. At first, I didn’t know what it wanted from me until I looked down at myself. My jacket was covered in blood. Like the trained hound I was, I unzipped my jacket and pulled it off. The white crow grabbed it with its beak and without any final looks or triumphed caw it followed its murder into the unknown.

That was the last I ever saw of it.

I wish the walk back home had been the same haze as the last months, but it was crystal clear. Every breath I took, every step, every thought about my crime, they all still live on inside me until this very day I write it all down. I sneaked back into my home with no one the wiser where I had been.

I lay down in bed and fell asleep immediately. I have never slept better.

Six months since then have passed. The day afterward all the mind-altering effects of the white crow were gone. When I went to school, no malicious looks followed me around. No one there truly cared for me that they would mock me each time they saw me. My friends only mentioned that I had finally gotten over myself, and they went right back to normal. Only my parents appeared to be more relieved. They said that they had feared this phase would last for a bit longer.

I will not lie, at that moment I had forgotten about the guy I killed. His death was nothing more than an afterthought to me. I was free from the white crow. Whether someone else had to pay for it with their life had no importance to me. But, even in those days of bliss, I noticed something about myself. Something in me had changed for the worse.

When the white crow and its murder visited me at night to feast upon me, they have devoured parts of me. I didn’t struggle with my memory or anything like that. It was just how fast my mind worked. It hadn’t slowed down to such a degree where I had to be worried about my future, but I didn’t perform as well as before. Writing down this account took me quite a while when it should have been done way sooner.

Besides the damage done to my brain, I had some form of PTSD or something. I’m not that interested in psychology, and I don’t think I can go to therapy with that, but I’m convinced I have something like that. When I see a bird of every kind fly above me, I want to run away. When I hear a caw, I startle visibly. Often, I wake up due to nightmares, the white crow hunting me, the guy I killed cursing me, and the murder darkening the sky.

I haven’t done any research into the white crow. There has to be some writing about them. I can’t be the only one that this has happened to. But I don’t want to. Call me a coward, but this isn’t a war I want to take part in. All I can and am willing to do is warn people. Not just to quench my guilt but because it is the right thing to do.

Once the white crow has seen you, it is over. You won’t outrun it. You won’t be able to kill it. It won’t stop until it has gotten what it came for. So, when you see one, hide and pray to God that it chooses someone else.
