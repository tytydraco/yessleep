It was a normal Sunday night and like every Sunday, I was sad. You know when you're reflecting on your current situation, all alone at home? I was doing that. I'm 23 years old, with no family, no friends, no job, no one. I could disappear from the world right now and nothing would change in anyone's life.

I was about to go eat some expired canned food that I would definitely regret eating later when I heard a knock on the door. Just two knocks and nothing else. I was a little scared. I think you would be too if you had no one to visit you and you heard a knock on the door at night. I stood there staring at the door for a few seconds wondering if I should go see who it was. About 3 minutes passed and no one knocked on the door again. But a leaflet appeared under the door. I was scared, but I went over to get it, even though I was afraid of getting close to the door and having it open and the person outside taking me to the world of darkness. Maybe I'm a little scared.

I looked at the flyer, it looked like those college flyers with fold-outs telling about the campus, it had written in Arial font right in the middle of the flyer, with white letters and completely black paper, minimalism is in fashion, right?

"Looking for a job opportunity? To be your own boss, have financial freedom?"

"Call us at *phone number*"

Well, I wanted all of that, but it was clearly a scam, and it was all a bit strange, a person knocked on my door and stood there waiting and when he realized I wasn't going to open the door he slipped this under the door in the middle of the night, as if he knew I was home at that time and heard the knock so he waited, he didn't slip the flyer under the door right away, who delivers flyers at night? And it doesn't have the name of the company, just a strange phrase and a number, I was desperate for a job, of course I was, but was I desperate enough to call that number?

I went to the kitchen, opened the cupboard doors, nothing, there was nothing there, I called the number.

A woman answered the phone:

*Hi?*


*Hello, are you interested in changing your life? Finally having freedom-*


*Yes, of course, what is a job to do?*


*Well, we're looking for a handyman, to work at the incredible *address**


*At the abandoned circus in town?*


I thought to myself, "What's this? A story about Nospleep?"


*It's not abandoned, sir. Many people go on the rides. We need someone to fix the small problems that may arise on the rides. If there's any problem, you have to go and fix it quickly. Are you interested in filling the position?*

*What would the salary be*


*Night shift, 9am to 3am, $25 an hour.*

I accepted the position.

I know what you're thinking: "Working in a circus in the middle of the night, until 3am, literally when the devils are loose, this guy must be crazy." I understand why you think that, but not having food at home makes you take desperate measures.

I'm not a person who knows everything about fixing things, but since I've never had the money to hire someone to fix any problems I had in my house, I learned to do it myself, and this circus is kind of broke, so they can't break things too much since in order to break them, people have to use the rides.

The next day I was there, I'll describe the place to you: a place that must be the size of about 3 parking lots together, with several amusement park rides and right in the middle a tent, that classic circus tent, red and white, for a broke place it was actually pretty, as far as possible, some rides were kind of poorly lit and boring, I wouldn't go here if I were a child, or even an adult to tell the truth.

It's the kind of place a rebellious teenager would go to spray paint on the walls. I was restless, I arrived there and there was no one there, no one came to greet me or tell me what I needed to do, nothing, the moment I looked around I had a thought that I hated myself for having had, you know when you have an almost impulsive thought, that almost seems like a fact.

"I feel like prey lured into the forest, where the trap is."

I got a little nervous after thinking that, a strange pamphlet, delivered at a strange time, by a strange person that I didn't even know who it was, with strange things written on it, to work in a strange place, with a strangely good salary, we have to agree that it's a little strange.

I turned to leave, "seriously, an abandoned circus/park, calling for someone who no one would miss if he mysteriously disappeared, no one would press charges, how stupid was I, I'll never fall for that again-"

*Where are you going? a voice behind me said*


*got scared and turned around abruptly.*


*Hi, I didn't see anyone so I was leaving, I thought I was in the wrong place maybe. I laughed nervously.*


*You're in the right place, you must be the new handyman, right?*


*Yes, it's me.*


*Come on, I'll show you around.*


We walked while he explained some things about the park to me, I felt stupid after he explained everything to me, he said that the circus opens in the morning and stays open until 8pm and if there's anything to fix I'll be informed so I can fix it before the next morning, so everything is in order and the circus can operate normally the next morning.

He explained to me that whenever I arrive I should go to a room that would be "my work room", that I shouldn't wait for him, he was only here because it was my first day, I should go straight to my room and on the table there will be all the things that need some repairs or just need to be dusted.

We shook hands and he left through the door and closed it behind him, when I was alone in my room I realized how small and suffocating it was, there were tools everywhere, some cleaning products, a very small table and chair, I soon realized that my room was actually the place where they kept the junk they didn't want anyone to see.

I picked up the two papers that were on the table and froze.

"no, no, no, it can't be, this isn't some silly reddit story, this isn't a horror movie, please tell me it isn't." I read the header of the first paper: "list of rules." "seriously, how could that be a good sign, I'm rational and this is real life, it's not a story, these things don't happen in real life, right? It must be just a list of places where I should be more careful when cleaning, of course, that must be it"

I was afraid to read it, but I started reading it anyway, it only had 3 rules.

List of rules

1 - Just do YOUR job, if other employees come asking for your help, or offering help, don't help, don't accept, turn around and continue your tasks, don't respond, the more you talk, the more they will insist and maybe convince you.


2 - At 5 minutes to 3:00, leave IMMEDIATELY, don't wait until 3:00 to leave the park, it can be dangerous.


3 - Under no circumstances go into the circus tent, you may hear the noise of things falling or people talking things that might make you curious, loud laughter, but it's not your problem, don't go in, I repeat, DO NOT GO IN.


Good luck.
