You know those wooden signs on Etsy, the ones that say "Home is Where the Heart Is"? My mother had one. I always hated that shit. Turns out I was right to.

The drive down State Route 787 felt longer than it should have. Or maybe shorter. It had been three years since I'd made this trip. Three weeks since the miscarriage. And three days since I'd gotten the call she was dead.

I'd taken a Xanax before we left. Had to. Maybe that’s why it all felt wrong. George kept glancing over at me from the driver's seat, checking if I was okay. I wasn't.

Neil Young played on the radio. George tapped the steering wheel. I watched the dense Virginia Pine pass through half-closed eyes. Then something flew overhead – too low to be a plane. George squinted. It was gone before either of us could track it.

We'd lost cell signal about a dozen miles back. I checked my phone anyway. Habit. The screen just showed my tired reflection and the trees closing in on both sides. Miles of nothing between nowhere towns.

"Sweetheart." George touched my shoulder. "We're nearly here."

I looked around, fighting the pharmaceutical fog. I held up my phone and snapped a photo of the passing pines. "The bathroom renovation video posts at four."

"You sure you don't want to take a break from all that?"

"It's already scheduled. A week's worth of content. Eight hundred thousand followers don't need to know about... all of this." I gestured vaguely at myself, at the situation, at everything.

"Business as usual then."

I nodded. Then I felt it – that tightening around my eyes. George didn't like it when I cried.

A low rumble rolled across the valley. Deep and distant. Like something huge shifting underground. 

"What was that?"

George glanced at the mountains ahead. "Mining equipment, maybe?"

"I thought they closed those the mines decades ago?"

"Not anymore, babe. Drill baby drill, right?" He shrugged.

The sound came again. Longer this time. 

The car cruised past a sign: Gatenville, Virginia. Population 408. 

Now 407.

\* \* \* \* \*

The funeral home occupied a Victorian on Main Street. Blue trim peeling, white siding stained with mud.

"Looks like someone left a birthday cake out in the sun," I said.

Hadley met us at the door. 

“Isn’t that the guy who let slip that he still loved you at our wedding?” 

“Shhh.” 

He was right though. Somewhere between toasts and dessert. Hadley had a moment of liquid courage that turned into disaster. We dated in high school. Remained friends all these years later. I was like that. No one was transient to me. Everyone mattered.

That's probably why @KateBuildsItBetter took off. It was genuine. Mostly. Okay, I bought a thousand followers in the early days, but everyone does that. After that, though? All real. I remembered people. Responded to comments. Posted their before-and-afters. Real people, real houses, real problems I could actually solve.

"Kate." Hadley extended his hand, holding the pause too long before adding, "I'm so sorry." Like he'd forgotten that part.

But something about Hadley seemed off. He stood too rigid. His hand hung there even as I hugged him instead. The hand just... lingered. Still extended. Like he'd forgotten to recoil.

Another pause. "Your mother. She's ready."

The hallways reeked of formaldehyde barely masked by flowers. Hadley led us deeper into the funeral home. When we reached the viewing room, he stopped and turned to face us – but his eyes fixed on the wall behind me, like I wasn't even there.

"She didn't suffer." The words came out separated. She. Didn't. Suffer. His face struggled to form sympathy. "It was quick. I thought you would take comfort in that."

I started crying again. I didn't take comfort in that.

"The service tomorrow," Hadley continued. "Eleven o'clock. Everyone will be there."

"Everyone?" George asked.

"The whole town."

Inside, Mom lay in a mahogany casket. Hands folded. Face wrong in that way dead faces are always wrong. Too much makeup. Masking emptiness. But there was something else – her fingers. They'd been folded across her chest in that traditional pose, but the angle was off. Like someone had arranged them who didn't quite understand how joints worked. Thumbs tucked under instead of over.

I stood at the casket, trying to find words. I'd held it together on the drive, but now – I reached out for her hand, needing her touch one last time. Then I stopped.

"She's cold," I said. Which was expected. "No. Not her. The air around her is cold."

George leaned closer and felt it too. A pocket of frigid air above her body, like it was drawing all the warmth into itself.

"She came from downstairs," Hadley said. "It's colder down there."

I cried harder. George held me and led me down the hall. As we left, I heard the casket latches click shut with a finality that somehow felt temporary.

\* \* \* \* \*

Mom's house on Morrison sat at the edge of town. A two-story craftsman with a wraparound porch. The screen door hung crooked, mesh all torn up like a raccoon had clawed at it. Wasps had built a colony where the tree met the porch.

Out of habit, I held up my phone, filming and narrating. "1920s with the original shingles. The porch could be something stunning with some TLC." I stopped. "Christ. What is wrong with me?"

"It's alright, Kate."

"No. I just – I can't turn it off sometimes. You know I told her I would renovate the place. Do a whole childhood home feature. She said the internet didn't need to know our business."

A wasp drifted close. Then that sound again – low and guttural, rolling across the valley from somewhere deep. We both stopped and listened.

"The mine," I said, remembering. "They reopened it last year. Mom mentioned it in one of her letters."

Inside, the house showed years of widow living. Newspapers and dishes stacked everywhere. Mold blooming. Windows painted shut.

I went room to room, documenting everything. Snapping photos. Opening drawers and closets. Searching.

"What are you looking for?" George asked.

"I just want answers. Why she stopped calling. Why her letters got so strange."

I pulled out the stack of envelopes. Mom's schoolteacher cursive degrading with each letter. The last few barely legible. Words that weren't words. Sentences that could have gone on forever if the page hadn't confined them.

*– the silver belly – where crows turn their back –*

"Dementia?" George suggested.

"She was sixty, George."

"It happens."

I found another letter. Water-damaged, pages stuck together. But readable.

*They stand in the yard. Like statues. Watching the house. Waiting.*

*Sheriff says I'm seeing things. But he's one of them now. Can tell by           the way he breathes. Shallow. Like he's forgotten how.*

*The Hendersons went first. Then the Millers. Then the whole street.*

*Won't be long before it's my turn.*

I kept reading, unable to stop.

*Saw Dolores next door at 3 AM. Laying in her garden. Naked. Covered in dirt. They're going back down where they shouldn't. I can feel it. The whole street can. Rumbling.*

The letter dropped from my hands. Tears filled my eyes.

"She was sick," George said. 

"I should have come sooner."

"We have a life. A schedule. Projects. And you've been through a lot–"

"That's not an excuse." My voice cracked. "Three years, George. Three years."

"You invited her. We invited her. She didn't want to come."

"She didn't even follow me online. I can still hear her voice in my ear. She said I was performing my life."

George went quiet. Because maybe there was truth to it. Maybe I had been. Curating. Filtering. Scheduling. Even posting from the hospital before we knew we lost our boy. 

Movement at the window made me jump.

Mrs. Henderson stood inches from the filthy glass. No expression. Just watching.

"Fuck," George blurted out.

I watched, frozen, as Mrs. Henderson tapped the glass. Once. Twice. Then she smiled, showing teeth that had gone black at the gums.

Footsteps at the door. Voices. The door opening. Pleasant neighborly conversation. A moment later, Mrs. Henderson was in the kitchen, holding a casserole dish covered in aluminum foil.

"Thought you might be hungry after such a long drive."

She turned to me. Her eyebrows had been drawn on crudely, stuck in permanent surprise, like she'd forgotten what the expression looked like.

Before I could step back, Mrs. Henderson took my face in her hands.

"Margie's girl," she said, studying me. Looking *into* me. "You used to play in my garden. Picked all my tomatoes."

I tried to pull away, but her hands held firm. Stronger than they should be.

"Always mischievous. We always thought so." Her breath smelled like the hallway in Hadley's funeral parlor. "Your momma worried. Always worrying."

“We?” Her pupils dilated. Contracted. Like camera apertures adjusting focus.

She released me and stepped back, turning toward George.

"Well, would you look at the time.” She said, never glancing at a clock, her wrist, nothing. “I best skedaddle. But I’ll be seeing you tomorrow, won’t I!"

From the window, I filmed her on my phone walking across the yard. She moved like a broken wind-up toy. And at her property line, she stopped. Turned. And waved back at us.

George and I exchanged a glance.

"What the fuck was that?" he finally said.

\* \* \* \* \*

We had dinner at The Mercantile. The only place in town open past six. Black vinyl booths held together with duct tape. Ceiling fans that didn't actually cool a damn thing. Regulars doing regular things under fluorescent lights. 

But no phones. Not one glowing screen in the place. Just faces bent over plates.

​​The laminated menu was sticky under my fingers. Dolores with the crooked name tag arrived. She brought coffee without asking. Black for George. Two sugars and cream for me.

"How did you–" I started.

"Intuition, doll." Dolores's face was like wax. No smile. No reaction. Just blank. "Just kidding. Your mother took it the same way. I just assumed."

"And mine?"

"Good guess."

We ordered. The food came fast. Too fast maybe. George's burger lukewarm and bleeding on to the plate. My soup was cold. Film on top like pond scum.

"Not exactly fit for a Michelin star, is it?" I smirked.

"Fifteen bucks for a frozen burger. Yum. They have a Sheetz here?"

"What do you think?"

We didn't complain. Around us, the other diners ate quietly. A man in filthy overalls. Fork to plate to mouth. The same motion over and over. Another booth – a family eating in the same rhythm.

Through the window, I could see hi-vis vests moving around new construction equipment near the base of the mountain. Workers coming and going in trucks marked with a corporate logo I didn't recognize.

Under the table, George's hand found mine.

Someone coughed near the kitchen. Then another cough from across the room. The exact same sound. Like an echo, but it wasn't.

"We should leave," George said.

Money hit the table. Too much. No one looked up as we left.

Outside, the air felt heavier than it should. I turned back to look through the diner window.

Every single person had stopped eating. They were all facing the window. Facing *us*.

Then, as one, they returned to their meals.

\* \* \* \* \*

The Valley Inn was a few miles outside town. Everything was brown and orange. Polyester bedspread with a pattern that hurt to look at. 

I insisted we stay there. I wouldn't sleep in Mom's house. George didn't argue.

I stood on the bed, turning in slow circles with my phone held high.

"Anything?" George asked.

"I'm on the ValleyGuest network, but there's no internet. Just keeps timing out."

George stared at the landscape painting above the bed. "Is that supposed to be a mountain or a tumor?"

I didn't laugh. I was still searching for a connection. Finally, I gave up and dropped onto the bed.

"Watch the game," George said, flipping on the TV to pre-season hockey. "Caps up by two."

The ice machine outside rattled and thumped.

"What if she was right?" I said quietly.

"About what?"

"That something is wrong here."

George rubbed his eyes. "Small towns are always weird."

"I hate this place. Even as a kid, it always felt off."

George looked at me. No phone glow on my face tonight. He was an audience of one. He leaned in, his hand on my thigh. I tensed up, then softened as his fingers found the nape of my neck.

"Not yet," I whispered. "I just… I can't."

George pulled me close. "Are you upset with me?"

"No. It's not that. I just… I’m sorry."

The doctor said it wasn't my fault. Said it happens to one in four pregnancies. That I was young, we could try again. Still, I found myself apologizing. Again and again. 

It was the way George had looked at me in that hospital room. Not angry. Worse. *Careful*. Like I was broken. Like I might break again if he said the wrong thing.

We hadn't had sex since. Every time he reached for me, I felt it – that weight of his unspoken questions. *Was it something you did? The stress? All that time on your phone?* 

He never asked. But I heard it anyway.

And maybe he was right. Maybe if I'd taken a day off. If I'd eaten better. If I'd been less focused on engagement metrics and trending.

Three weeks wasn't long enough. The bleeding had stopped after five days, but everything else was still there. The phantom cramps. The way my body felt, like it was still looking for something that wasn't there anymore.

The grief counselor said it could take months. Or years. "Your body has to catch up with the loss," she'd said. 

"Bury her tomorrow. Then we leave," George said. "Have someone else handle everything. Pack up the house. Ship what you want. Sell the rest."

I shook my head. "I should do it. She was my mother."

"You've been through enough."

*Enough*. Like there was a limit. Like I'd hit my quota for suffering.

George turned off the light. The mattress sank into springs older than both of us. Light from the parking lot sliced through a gap in the curtains.

I stayed awake. Watching that line of light. Listening to the ice machine and George's breath evening out into sleep.

I thought about the future. The plans we'd made. The nursery we'd painted before the bleeding started. George had wanted yellow. "Sunny," he'd called it. We’d finished a single wall. 

I never went back into that room after the hospital. For all I knew, the paint cans were still sitting there. Brushes hardening in the tray.

The emptiness wasn't just in my body. It was in every future moment, every story we'd imagined. 

First words. First steps. First day of school. All of it, gone. Erased. Like someone had reached into my life and deleted whole chapters I'd already written in my head.

"One more day," I said to no one. 

Or maybe it was to the baby that wasn't there anymore. 

One more day of pretending I was okay. One more day of George being *careful* with me.

One more day before I had to bury the only person who might have understood.

\* \* \* \* \*

The parking lot light started flickering. Subtle at first, then strobing. Then it went out completely.

Even the ice machine stopped.

The silence was worse than the noise.

I moved to the window and peered through the blinds.

Three dark figures stood beside our rental car. They weren't moving. Not swaying. Not breathing. Just standing there, like statues someone had placed in the parking lot while we weren't looking.

"George," I whispered. "George, wake up."

He groaned, rolled over. I grabbed his shoulder, harder.

"George. *Now*."

He joined me at the window, squinting into the dark. The figures hadn't moved. Not an inch.

"What the hell are they doing?"

"I don't know."

We watched them. Waiting for something. Anything. A shift. A turn of the head. But they just stood there, perfectly still, facing our room.

George went to his bag and grabbed the Maglite he'd taken from Mom's house. "Fuck this shit."

"What are you doing?"

He threw open the door, flashlight raised. "You got three seconds before I–"

The parking lot was empty.

He swept the beam across the asphalt. Under the car. Along the tree line. Nothing. Not even footprints in the gravel where they'd been standing.

"They were right there," George said, more to himself than to me.

He stood there another moment, Maglite shaking slightly in his grip. Then the parking lot light flickered back on with a sharp *POP*.

George stood there in his boxers, barefoot on the cold pavement.

Back inside, he locked the door. Tested it. Wedged the chair under the knob.

"Maybe we imagined it," he said, but he didn't sound convinced.

"Both of us?"

He didn't answer.

We sat on the bed. Me with my knees pulled to my chest. George with the Maglite across his lap like a weapon. Both of us watching the door, listening to the ice machine rattle back to life.

I thought about Mom's letters. *They stand in the yard. Like statues. Watching the house.*

"George," I said quietly. "She wasn't sick."

He didn't answer. He didn’t have to. We didn't sleep.

I could have sworn I heard that low rumble again. The one from the mountain.

Closer this time.
