When I first saw it, I was driving home from work.

In the beginning, I thought it was a storm cloud, but that notion wasn’t playing well in my head. For one thing, there were hardly any other clouds in the sky. It was mostly clear, just a giant sea of blue up there.

It wasn’t big enough to be a storm front, not yet anyway. But it looked black enough for rain. It was at least a mile in diameter.

Birds were flying into it from all directions, but none seemed to be flying out. I’ve gotta admit, that was a bit unsettling. My wife, Marnie, and our daughters were waiting at home, which looked to be near where it was looming.

Several vehicles were parked alongside the rural road that leads to our little outskirts community. The faces of the people standing by their cars dripped of dread. They were the kind of shocked sad faces that one sees around the room at an unexpected funeral viewing.

But something else was there, something extra, something that grabbed at my gut. I couldn’t put my finger on it at first, but then I realized, I know that look. I’ve seen that look before. Late one night, some time ago, I was scrolling down through some old footage that I’d stumbled onto on one of those dark conspiracy sites.

Those people - It was the look in the eyes of those people, the unfortunate ones, the witnesses of the first nuclear bomb tests.

That’s what I saw. That’s what I recognized. It was that same ungodly awe that was pasted all over the faces of those people. Many were entranced so deeply that their cell phones were no longer pointed at the cloud but were drooping down in front of them in different directions.

Bllllaaaaaaa!

I jumped out of my skin for a blink. The Mac truck riding in my trunk blasted his horn straight through my body. It tickled my fingertips and rattled my teeth. I almost jerked my jeep straight off the road. Gravel danced across my passenger side like a hail of gunfire.

Instant panic went to instant anger, which morphed into instant shrill shrieks that washed over my skin, up my spine, and out of my mouth. It felt like I screamed for five minutes straight, in a split second.

A white F-150 had drifted into my lane.

Like the Titanic traversing its cryptic, floating ice mountain, it scraped along the length of my jeep, so close that my side mirror skated into it. It etched out angry grooves, screeching and whistling as it dragged from front to rear.

The semi’s wheels bucked down the road like a speedboat slapping waves on a windy lake.

I looked in my rearview mirror and saw the eighteen-wheeler nearly jackknife, skidding toward the ditch. I watched a half-shredded tire leapfrogged out into a cow pasture.

On the other side, the pickup bounced over the ditch, through a narrow field of grass, and planted its nose into a fence post. I watched it getting smaller the further away I drove. Radiator steam made it look like the truck was smoking a cigarette.

I chuckled out loud, but not for long. My attention was quickly recaptured by the onlookers lining the sides of the road. It was becoming apparent that the mysterious black cloud wasn’t just near our neighborhood; it was directly right over top of it. I thought of Marnie and the kids as I looked up at the sky.

As I got closer, I had to lean forward, over the steering wheel, to get a good view. This cloud, or whatever it was, seemed to have a texture to it, a sort of grain. It swirled in a clockwise motion, not like a tornado, but more like a herd of spooked horses racing around a track.

The first thing I noticed when I drove into our residential area was three or four families racing in and out of their homes with luggage, bags, and arms full of assorted belongings. One guy had one kid tucked under each arm.

Moms dragged their gawking children along by their arms, shouting at them to move it. Dads were beeping their horns and screaming at their wives.

I wanted to go faster, but under the circumstances I thought it best to roll through the scrolling neighborhood with ease. Unattended kids and pets, panicked parents, and distracted onlookers wafted through the streets. It was like watching a bunch of aimless drunks trying to find their car in the parking lot at the end of the night.

I rounded the last corner. From there it was a straight shot to our house. I don’t know why. As badly as I wanted to get home to my loved ones, I don’t know why I stopped for a moment, but I did.

I rested my foot on the brake and leaned forward as far as I could. With my elbows over the steering wheel, and my head cocked sideways, I looked up at the cloud.

That was no cloud.

It was much larger now and growing in size. It breathed like the roar of a river and hummed with the low rumble of a coming train. Even though it wasn’t drifting, but stayed hovering in place, the breadth of its shadow was getting wider.

My eyes traveled downward, past the emergency vehicles and their bedazzled lights, to the blacktop on the street in front of me. Things were dark and getting darker. The blanket-like shadow rolled across the ground toward me like an eclipse. It crept up the hood of my jeep. It scrolled up my windshield like the filling of a glass of water.

In my mirror, behind me, everything was still. Everybody behind me had stopped to watch.

I looked back up the street.

My wife and kids are standing in the front yard next to several emergency responders: paramedics, firemen, police officers, and a few of the neighbors with their guns in hand. My wife is holding the kids close. Turns her head and looks back at me. I’ve never seen fear like this before.

I snap to and drive to them. I stumble out of my car like a running back breaking tackles on his way into the end zone.

My family embraces me, crying and talking so fast that I can hardly understand a single word they’re saying.

At this end of the street, people are all scattered in a half circle looking at the house next door.

There is police tape out and hazard cones. There’s a strange, gritty, sort of moist dust in the air that leaves a lingering film in my mouth.

It’s dark like dusk. Streetlights have popped on and are getting brighter as they warm up.

The blackness above swirls like a whirlpool of black rocks, like a sinkhole in a tar pit. It’s so loud that we have to shout to talk over it. Feels like I’m lying under a moving carousel in a thunderstorm. Its low rumble churns in my gut and messes with my equilibrium. A constant breeze tugs at our clothes and tickles our faces with the flipping of our hair. It’s dirty, gritty, and foul, like standing in front of the wind tunnel at the end of a chicken breeder barn.

I’m dizzy. We all are. I embrace my family. We steady ourselves together.

Flashes of lightning crack and pop inside the chop of the cloud. Thunder claps. It booms and ends in a fizzled out, screeching cry. Every light in the neighborhood browns out for a second. A rapid sound fills the air, like a hundred flags whipping in the wind.

Black things fall by the dozens, pelting the ground and kicking up dust. A horrible smell — the odor of burnt hair wafts, flooding in amongst us. It thickens within the newly emerging fog that quickly rolls in and envelops the area.

A short burst of rain falls. But it’s not rain. It’s bird shit. Those falling things are birds: crows, ravens, hawks, and vultures.

I look up.

Focusing hard, I’m squinting so tightly it makes my head ache.

“It’s birds… The whole thing… is birds.”

A shrill shriek blares from the house and wails through the neighborhood, echoing off every flat surface.

It’s ear piercing. I’m instantly sick to my stomach. And I can see its effect on the faces of my family and the others. Those of us who covered our ears are doing better than the rest. Several people throw up. Those who don’t are dry heaving.

The front door creaks open about a foot.

All eyes are on the house.

Fingers slither around the outside edge of the door about halfway up the side, slowly caressing the edge and leaving behind smudges of half-dried blood.

Boom!

A body slams into the large, curtain-covered bay window. The subtle impression of a body shape is stamped on the glass in blood. The blood-blotched curtain slowly peels away from the glass.

Boom!

It hits again.

The blood imprint is now an undefinable blob.

Bam!

Blood spatters across the center of the curtains and thickens up the blot on the window. Web-like cracks sprout across the glass.

Two of the neighbors step forward with their rifles into the yard and take aim at the front door. Cops cautiously follow behind them, sidearms drawn.

The town’s tornado warning system activates. The rotating swell and fade of the siren sounds like a wartime air raid.

We all look up and around at the sky.

Bam!

The body slams into the window — again and again and again, not quite as hard but more quickly, like a hungry child pounding their fists on the table. Cracks splinter further across the glass as the intensity gradually increases.

The outside edge of a leg and an arm stand in the breach of the front door. A woman peeks one eye around the side. Her breathing is aggressive, like a woman in labor.

Crack! Crash!

The body in the window pushes its way through a small newly made hole, head first, wrapped and entangled in the curtain. The hole widens as glass crackles and splinters away.

The men and the officers open fire.

The window shatters. The body in the curtain falls outside, screaming and flailing around on the ground, fighting against the cloth.

The woman in the door dips back inside.

I tell my wife to get the kids in the car. I run inside our house to grab our bags, looking over at the scene next door on my way by.

We were just about to leave town on vacation. That was it; when I got home, we were gonna hit the road. Thank God for small favors.

I’m scurrying around grabbing as many bags and things as I can carry. I hear the commotion outside: more gunfire; the crowd sounds like they’re on safari watching a rabid lion feed.

Suddenly, they go silent.

I freeze, standing there in our foyer with luggage strapped to my back and my shoulders. Got things tucked up under my arms and a purse strap gripped between my teeth. I’m staring at our front door. It’s wide open.

From there I can’t quite see what’s happening next door, but I can see my wife loading our second child into the car. She’s looking back at me. The fear in her eyes breaks my soul.

I step into the opening of our front door and look to my right, at the neighbor’s house.

The curtain-covered woman is standing in the middle of the front yard about twenty feet away. The men have their rifles fixed on her, and the police are shouting at her. It has started raining, and the blood-soaked drape is now form-fitting to the outline of the woman’s features.

She opens her mouth so wide that her cheekbones make a loud pop. She screeches out long screams, matching the pitch and the up-and-down pattern of the tornado siren.

After throwing everything in the car, I grab Marnie by both arms and tell her, “I’m going back inside for the grab-and-go bag and the guns.” I can hear her sobbing, pleading for me not to go as I run to the house.

As I’m running, I’m watching next door. The woman in the curtain starts taking steps towards the men. Her arms are straight out from her sides. With every step forward, the drape is pulled, gradually slipping off her head. It falls to the ground. She is riddled with cuts, and her veins are abnormally visible. She’s still screaming along with the siren. Her dislocated jaw hangs a little bit uneven.

I stop at our front porch and watch it all for a second. I look over at Marnie; she’s screaming for me to come back.

At the neighbor's house, the front door opens and the other woman steps outside. She’s holding a baby. They’re both covered in blood. The broken birds, scattered around in the grass, twitch and flop and start to get up, hobbling around on busted legs and broken wings.

I run inside our house. My mind is racing a million miles a second, shuffling through kitchen drawers for the gun safe key. “Help me, God! Help me, God! Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.” It’s like an eternity in there digging through crap. My hands are shaking, and I’m practically hyperventilating.

Like a slap in the back of the head, I suddenly know the answer. I race upstairs, above my headboard, and back down, skating on my heels all the way, gliding over every stair.

Who needs keys when you’ve got a .357 magnum? My safe is just a cruddy old cabinet with a padlock. It’s not a real safe.

I blast off the lock, and I’m back standing at our front door with a pile of survival crap in my arms.

Birds from the sky are flying around near ground level, everywhere, hundreds of them, dive-bombing and pecking at everybody. The stumbling, flopping birds on the ground are cawing and screeching as they hobble towards the men. They have positioned themselves in the form of a semicircle. The men start shooting them. The birds flop and crack like popcorn in a skillet.

Recently arrived men in SWAT gear are taking up positions around the perimeter.

The woman on the porch is holding the baby up towards the sky.

Cops are yelling.

She throws the baby high up in the air, towards the middle of the yard. A black flash of crows swoops in to snatch the child. One of the men dives, catches the infant mid-air, slams down back first into the grass, and slides further into the yard. He quickly tosses the child to a nearby officer and lies back down, holding his chest with the wind knocked out of him.

The siren, the rain, gasps and screams, panicking people down the block trying to leave, and the crunching of cars backing out into each other fill our ears.

The man on the ground looks up from his back and then around at the broken birds that have now surrounded him.

They swarm him. He kicks and swings and screams. Birds from the sky dive down and join in.

I’m jogging toward the car, trying not to draw attention to myself.

Lightning cracks.

A slew of birds pummel the ground.

Men are shooting in all directions, half covered in birds, screaming, flailing, and fighting for their lives.

I get to the car. They aren’t there. Everything is gone. Oh no. They’re gone. Oh my God, they’re gone. No, no, no. Where are they?

I’m scrambling. Looking in every direction. Help! Oh no. Somebody help me, please. God help me.

Birds are everywhere, racing around like angry bees fighting for their hive. People are screaming. Guns are blazing. The women on the porch and in the yard are looking in my direction. They’re smiling. Their eyes are a dark jade, and they are fixed directly on me.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know where to go. My heart is like a hammer pounding through my chest. I can’t breathe. Feels like I’m going to black out.

A crow lands on the roof of my car, then another, and another. They’re looking at me. They clack their beaks. Sounds like someone smacking two spoons together. Their claws dig into the metal. It’s a hair-raising scrape. I’m slowly walking backwards while digging the revolver from my pocket.

Suddenly an engine roars. Someone lays on a horn.

Marnie and the kids are waving and yelling at me from inside of an armored SWAT van.

I race to them.

A dozen crows come after me. They dive at me, pecking and nipping away small chips of flesh from any exposed skin they can find. I’m screaming so hard it’s blurring my vision.

Marnie steps into the van doorway with a shotgun. “Duck! Now! Get down.”

I dive to the ground.

She blasts away.

I scramble to my feet.

The woman in the yard is walking towards the van.

I dive into the side door. “Drive, Marnie! Drive! Drive! Go, go, go!”

She floors it.

Wrong gear, we all fly forward into the windshield as the van shoots backwards out of control. We blast into the first woman and send her flying into the second, right before we crash into the house. We’re all rocked and slammed.

Everything goes black.

I’m on a beach, walking with Marnie. The kids are skipping around in front of us, playing in the sand and laughing it up.

It’s so beautiful. She’s so beautiful. We stop for a moment and just look out at the ocean. We close our eyes and listen to the softness of the waves lapping at the shoreline.

Her lips softly push into mine. I can tell she’s smiling while we kiss. It makes us both laugh.

I tell her I love her.

I open my eyes.

Through the crashed-out open window of the house, in the background of the living room is a large man and two small children, standing there, heads tilted forward, smiling and bleeding. They have lacerations all around their faces. Their lips are chewed off.

I scream at the top of my lungs.

Marnie bolts forward, straight up, sitting in the driver's seat. She throws it in drive and starts spinning the tires in the muddy grass.

Cops and neighbors are running, screaming, shooting, and being pecked to death all around us.

The kids are screaming, “Go, Mom! Go! Floor it! Mom! Go! Hurry! Hurry!”

I look in the side mirror.

One of the women is standing behind the van looking back at me in the reflection.

“It is floored! It is floored! We’re not going anywhere. Why are we not going anywhere?”

I place my hand on hers.

She looks at me.

I say, “Easy… Go easy. You’re spinning the tires. Put it in reverse for a second. There’s nowhere to go. We’ll bump into the house, then switch it into drive.”

My eyes wander past her. In the mirror on her side, I see the other woman walking up the length of the van, scraping her fingers along the side as she goes.

I continue, “Look at me… When we roll forward, don’t give it any gas. Just let the idle pull us forward for a second. Once we’re rolling… then give it some gas.”

The woman is at her window, staring at the side of Marnie’s face. The other woman is almost at my window. Marnie’s hands are white-knuckling the wheel.

“Marnie.”

“Yes.”

“Don’t look.”

“Ok.”

“Just drive.”

“Ok.”

The door latches are clicking, frantically clicking up and down. But they’re locked. Thank God they’re locked.

We roll back three inches. She throws it in drive. We roll forward, over the hump of the rut, and on out into the yard.

As we slowly roll through the muddy grass, in the mirrors we see the women, still watching us.

Behind them, the man and the two children from inside walk out into the yard.

A crow lands on the face of one of the women. It cocks its head from side to side and then caws at the sky. It pushes its head into her mouth. She just stands there, blinking. She raises her arms out to her sides and tips her head back.

The crow crawls into her mouth and down her throat.

She gags and chokes. Two more crows land on her stomach. They burrow their beaks into her belly button and crawl inside. Several more follow.

A cop slams into the hood. “Help me!”

Two crows are burrowing into his belly. His body buckles as they go inside. He stumbles backwards, throwing up, and digging at his stomach with his fingers trying to get them out. A crow flies headfirst into his open mouth.

It’s happening all around us.

We roll through the yard and out into the street.

The woman behind us is contorting. Her arms are getting longer. Her fingers and nails grow to twice their normal length. Her legs buckle as she tries to follow us. Her head thrashes back and forth like someone holding their breath, about to run out of air. Her shoulders roll forward as her back hunches, cracks, and pops like someone pushing a brick into a head of lettuce. The beginnings of wings tear their way through her skin. Her face is pushed forward into a slightly elongated shape.

As we pull away, we can see more of them. The same thing is happening to all of them.

They’re chasing down the road behind us, taking flight into the black sky.

From the back, the kids are shouting, “What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? Where are we gonna go?”

I look at Marnie and say, “If the devil is real… then God is real.”

“What if he’s not, Dad?”

“Then we’d be all alone.”

It’s quiet for a moment, just the hum of the engine and the gentle rocking of the van as we glide down a back county highway — putting distance between us from the creatures in my mirror and the churning. They’re smaller now, further away. I see them flying around in the black sky in the soft haze of the moonlight that’s trying to peek through.

Marnie looks at me. Whispers, “Jack.” Motions with her head toward the back.

The girls are drowsy, about to fall asleep.

I look back at them and then at Marnie. “Better hope God is real… and start praying.”
