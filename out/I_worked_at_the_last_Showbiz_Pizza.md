You may have thought all the Showbiz Pizza locations went the way of the buffalo but you'd be wrong. How do I know? Well I used to work at the last one. It's located in the most literal sense of the middle of nowhere possible, aka my home town.  But how about I start at the beginning.

So in my home town one of the only things of note is the last remaining showbiz pizza location. When I was a kid I used to go there pretty often with my friends and no, unlike most stories like this I didn't get any “bad feelings” . It was just a fun place for us all to be dumb kids. I remember I used to love the animatronic characters and completely bought into the fantasy, they may have just been fabric and metal but to me they were real. As we got older we mostly just stuck to the arcade, didn't ever really go near the Rock-afire band, not many people in town did. Flrtnlike they got the attention of fewer and fewer kids every year but I always kept my soft spot for them. I was honestly fascinated by them but for a different reason than when I was a kid, I thought the way they moved and seeing all the machine bits inside was pretty cool.

I wanted to learn more about them so I signed up to work there. The interview process was pretty fast. It was one of those small towns where everyone knows everyone and the owner just happened to be my highschool math teacher Ms. Jackson. Because she couldn't pay for much staff I ended up becoming a bit of a jack of all trades, cleaning, taking orders, and making the pizzas along with I like 5 other people, we juggled jobs around and tried to keep it balanced. It was chaotic but hey it worked. My bread and butter though was the one job the others didn't want to do, animatronic maintenance. Apparently the other guys I worked with were scared of the robots because of… well you know why. But I liked working on them, felt like helping out some old friends you know? Though a few weeks after I got hired on, things got a lot harder. 

The animatronics were breaking down way more than usual and it was driving away customers, we almost got sued for emotional damages when during one of the shows Billy Bob started staring at a little girl, instead of the music that would normally play it just let out this screeching sound, I figured one of the servos must have locked up and blown a speaker but that didn't stop that little girl from running out of the restaurant screaming and is getting a very angry phone call later that day. Luckily some coupons and tickets for the kid smoothed things out. That night I brought Billy Bob into the maintenance area in the back to give him a once over. I looked everywhere but I couldn't find any locked servos, broken springs, or anything of the sort, and the speaker system was perfectly fine.

I was absolutely stumped, I turned around to look at my notes for just a second but that's when I heard something, the whirring of joints and motors and when I turned around Billy Bob’s head was locked facing me. I could have sworn I unplugged him but I looked anyway and yeah, no connection. There was no explanation for how he could have moved. I was frozen in stunned silence, I wasn't dealing with this today so just packed up and got ready to leave. But as I entered the main showroom to my horror Mitzi was now gone.

This wasn't happening. I did not sign up for haunted house bullshit. I went for the door ignoring the questions of my coworkers only to find it locked. I looked at them both as they stood in stunned silence “where are the keys?!” They checked their pockets but it was clear they didn't know. I ran through the building checking offices and back rooms for the keys only to turn a corner in one of the back hallways to see Mitzi standing at the end of the hallway. I was already don't with all of this smoke and mirrors haunted house shit so I stormed up to her and grabbed the keys, as soon as I pulled them off though the animatronic reeled forward and claimed it's jaws down on my hand, it was like a bear trap and I could feel each bone snap like a twig under the intense force. I screamed and yanked my hand out from inside, injuring myself more but I had the keys. Mitzi let out a high pitched laugh like she was mocking me, I ran back down the hall but when I turned to see her the robot was already in hot pursuit.

I ran back into the main stage area only to see Billy Bob free from the maintenance area and back on stage. He clutched one of my coworkers' heads in his massive robotic hand. They struggled and writhed trying to escape but I could already hear the horrible sound of their skull breaking as Billy Bob tightened his grip. The word “Forgotten” was written above the stage in what looked like blood. Billy Bob threw the broken body to the floor and looked over to me, there was malice in those plastic eyes. I ran into the arcade to hide, I ripped open the back panel on one of the machines and crawled in. 

I slammed the metal grate behind me and locked it back into place just in time as Rolfe came stomping into the room. This one wasn't like the others, not slow and plodding but twitchy and erratic. Another one of my coworkers was hiding in a machine across from me but he couldn't close the grate all the way and his foot was exposed, unfortunately for home Rolfe saw the slight glint from his shoe. He tore the machine open, clawing and laughing, trying to get to my screaming coworker. Within moments he had him and his mechanical limbs made short work. I could only see little bits though the grate but it was enough to make me gag. And that was my mistake because as soon as I made a single sound Rolfe turned to me and began tearing open the machine.

In a blind panicked I tried to fight him off, he took a swipe at me and slashed open my shoulder, I desperately grabbed for something, anything that could save me. I grabbed some wires and jammed them into his robotic chest, the metal arced and his fur smoked before he fell to the ground. I got up and ran for it tearing through hallways and tripping over the bodies of my coworkers only to end up back in the showroom. All of the animatronics were there and the word Forgotten was still written above the stage. They began their song like they always used to do but it was wrong. Their lyrics were replaced with a symphony of horrible sounds, grinding gears, children's screams, and the cries of animals all with the sound of a distorted cheering crowd filling the room. I turned around to the tables only to see them filled with the propped up bodies of my coworkers. Their bodies slumped over with birthday caps haphazardly placed on them, even those whose heads were caved in or missing.

It was obvious now, they wanted, no they craved an audience and they remembered each of us in this little town. Every last one of us who stopped paying them any mind, all of us who walked right past them every time we came in. And finally we came into their home, ignoring them all these years just to come in for a paycheck, and looks like today is the day they finally snapped. I was playing with wolves, and I was in their woods. But I wasn't going to play their game, so I grabbed a table leg and tore it off. I threw it as hard as I could into the lighting fixture above the stage and it hit with a powerful force and a rain of sparks, the lights came down and landed on the robots, some caught fire while others writhed and sparked. In the chaos I got past the stage and back to the front where I unlocked the door and ran out, locking it behind me. I could hear them scream in rage, crying out for me to come back, for me to watch them. And watch them I did.

I've been in this town ever since watching that place. Keeping it boarded up, taped with caution tape and filled to the brim with warning signs. But I know they're in there. I can see them sometimes through the windows still performing, just taunting anyone in town to come in. After I told the owner about what happened she gave up, signed over the ownership to me shortly after under one condition. Never let anyone in there again. And I haven't. With no audience though I can only imagine what they'll do all cooped up in there. Maybe it's best showbiz shut down, maybe it's best they stay a memory. And I'm going to keep watch every day and make damn sure that that memory dies.
