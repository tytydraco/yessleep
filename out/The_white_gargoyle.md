The taste of metal filled my mouth, a bitter film that wouldn't leave, no matter how much I drowned myself in water or bit my own tongue. It was the antechamber, the premonition that settled in every morning, always there when I was conscious, never abandoning me. The vibration, not mine, never mine, not anymore. I'd muted the outside world of my cell phone months ago, but that was worse. The vibration of other devices, those sharing my space... it was even more insidious, more suffocating. What if he found me?

The question choked me, the same one that haunted me down every hallway, every corner of the university, the streets, my home. Always searching for a rock to lift, a place to hide, to make myself smaller and invisible. Behind a tree, amidst the murmur of people, inside any bathroom. I could change my entire route just to avoid crossing paths with him, with his face and his condescending smile. His shadow clung to my heels, I felt his cold breath on my neck, even when no one was there.

Now, sitting in the university waiting room, I felt it. The hum beneath my thigh, the girl's phone beside me vibrating against the padded seat. A dull, deathly pulse that not only reached me but pierced me. Invisible limbs settled on my chest, heavy, crushing, as if someone had stood on me with both feet and hands, ready to break my ribs. The air escaped my lungs, cold sweat beaded my forehead, my neck, my back. My face contorted into a hideous grimace, a gargoyle of anguish, an ancient, gray, worn, and wrinkled face. Though I knew I looked impassive, a marble statue in a noisy hall. And a distant *ting*, from somewhere else. I knew it was the university, and behind that, the remnants of my body swimming in Acheron.

I closed my eyes, with the stupid hope that the darkness would erase him or erase me. But darkness was just another canvas. I saw his face, those exact words that drilled into my head again and again: *"Are you sure you deserve it?"* They were knives, one after another, embedding themselves in my chest. And with each stab, the white room of my bathroom materialized, the icy spray of the shower against my skin, the thin blade of the razor dancing over my wrist. No, I wasn't a dancer. I was the tightrope, and on the other side, only that river where they, my mothers, screamed my name, drowning in red numbers, in what I had caused by my incapacity. Deserving... of course I didn't deserve it, of course not. Why the hell had I accepted that agreement? I watched them fall, sink, their eyes pleading with me. My mouth filled again with the same bile from every moment I was born.

I opened my eyes with a jolt. The hum had ceased. The girl next to me put her phone away, oblivious to my personal Hades. The place was still noisy, life went on, but my heart wouldn't let me hear anything but the blood escaping through my ears. The air smelled of mold and ruin. Of death. And I knew that, perhaps, Acheron wasn't just a metaphor.

I got up, stumbling over my own feet. I needed air. I needed this despair corroding my insides to find a place to dilute itself. The main hallway of the university was a river of faceless, noseless faces, only of laughter that sounded like shattered, endless glass. My eyes weren't anywhere, I felt them orbiting within my sockets and nothing more, until... I saw them. Well, them, with their easy smiles, always radiant. I saw them daily. Always with someone. And I, I was a disaster.

My chest tightened again, the damned executioner back on all fours on my chest. This time not as a vibration, but as a certainty, cold as a tombstone, that I was useless for this, for any of this. Useless for brilliance, for easy laughter. Useless for anything. Not for graduating, not for saving my family, not for being an intelligent woman. And much less for someone to look at me with that shine in their eyes. My hands, suddenly, felt immense and clumsy, as if they didn't belong to me, as if they were false hands just sewn onto my wrists. The hallway narrowed. Voices turned into a threatening murmur, a mockery repeating my name, distorted, ugly: "Incapable, useless... nothing."

Another image burst in with the violence of a punch, mixing with the voices and broken laughter. He, again, my friend, laughing in the early morning of that place of sweat and alcohol, with his other hand on the shoulder of that unknown man. The strobe light painting their faces like monsters. *"I'll convince her to stay with us, we've already done it, you'd be next."* His voice, then, was honey, now, pure poison burning my throat, the skin of my cheeks. More faces, other friends, not with expressions of concern, but of judgment and amusement. The label, the stigma, like a burn mark made with a hot iron on my skin... one that never stopped healing. That night, and until now, I was an appetizer, I was a delicacy. The humiliation clung to my skin like that whitish, repulsive liquid. The same bile as always in my mouth, it burned my lips, made them bleed. I wanted to swallow my tongue.

I felt the heat rise to my face, not from shame, but from a freezing rage against myself. It was the same rage that drove me to clench my teeth, to break them into splinters one by one, to seek the cold of the bathroom tile, the blade against my skin. Because if I was useless for anything else, then what? Would I continue to be someone's snack, some people's?

It vibrated, the damned vibration again, where the hell was it? It wasn't distant, it wasn't the girl from before. I felt the familiar tremor against my thigh, the dull pulse spreading like a plague, climbing from my pocket, creeping up my torso, reaching my trachea and squeezing hard. How? I'd silenced it. I'd killed it. But there it was, crawling, a demon in my pants. The screen lit up, and the notification burned into my retinas: **"URGENT MEETING. THESIS. TOMORROW 7 AM. J.A. SARMIENTO."**

My knees buckled. I felt the hands of that man, crawling up my arms, rising, feeling the weight on my waist, the humid, vinegary breath of someone in mine. My muscles tensed, waiting for the impact, the shove. My pulse was a war drum even in my fingertips. The hallway blurred. There was only emptiness, an imminent fall, but this time, the impulse wasn't mine. Someone, they, both of them. They wanted it to be their show, their fat legs and wide hips, their scaly lips, their abundant saliva, their cavity. Someone. Someone pulled my hair in the darkness. Someone else, or the same one, squeezed his hand and mine in its slimy deformity. My tongue was no longer mine, it was theirs, and I could only bite my cheeks until they bled, until the fibers tore.

I had no arms, no hands, not if they didn't want me to. My body took impossible forms, my spine was about to detach from my hip bones. I couldn't lift, move, or turn my head. My eyes saw nothing but my own hair and the red blanket of that red bed in that red room. The sound of a fork being slowly and forcefully dragged across porcelain filled my empty skull. Everything was wet, everything was damp, everything that was and wasn't me. Everything smelled and tasted of mold and ruin. Everything was imperfect circumferences on the imperfect skin of my thighs, my buttocks, my breasts. I was a disassemblable doll, and at this moment, none of my pieces were in place.

The image of a building, the tallest on campus, appeared vividly in my mind. The cornice, gray, cold, and slippery beneath the tips of my bare toes. The wind, whistling, was the only thing that killed the desperate rush of blood in my ears and dismembered the "someone" rocking on all fours on my chest. I'd been there before. It wasn't an image, it was a destiny. My body tensed, every muscle ready to run, to climb, or to jump. The breath of mold and ruin was now the smell of cement under a leaden sky. Why keep breathing this air of mold and ruin if ruin was already me?

I don't know how I got there. My feet moved by inertia, by the sheer desire to escape the faceless faces, the broken laughter, the four-legged executioner, and the ghost hands. The door to my room, white as a prison cell wall, opened before me, or I opened it, it no longer mattered. The only thing that mattered was my sanctuary. I entered. It smelled of confinement, of wire, and of that whitish, repulsive liquid that had clung to my skin months ago. The white room. That place built from my confessions, the bed, the desk, the chair, everything immaculate, aseptic. But not clean. It was dirty with myself.

My eyes fell on my suitcase. The wallet. Inside, the promising cold. A ray of artificial light shone through the window, but it didn't illuminate. It only made the shadows longer. His face overlapped with the other's, the one who laughed. Their smiles merged into one, condescending and two hungry. The voices of my friends, broken glass, called me 'silly girl'. I approached the table, my steps dragging. The poison inside me flooded my mouth, thicker, I could almost bite it. I gripped the wallet between my fingers, it was cold because it was dead. Its faint glimmer under the false light was the only control. I couldn't avoid my family's economic and social ruin, I couldn't change the past or become a war machine, I couldn't be a woman with a brain, I couldn't stop being everyone else's nightly snack. But this... this was mine.

I hated the cold tile of my white room, icy, as always. I let the stream of water run furiously. My fingers, those that felt alien, lifted it. The skin of my wrist, pale, offered itself. A small red line, then another, and another. Each time it almost disappeared deep into my muscles, I let out a sigh. The crimson liquid diluted with the liquid ice, brushing the immaculate white of the porcelain. In that precious moment, I had no heart, no blood in my ears, no putrid breaths on my face, no four-legged executioners on my chest, no thesis, no scholarships, no ruin, nothing. I only had her in these borrowed hands.

I looked up at the mirror. There I saw the ancient, gray, and wrinkled gargoyle, but now there was something else. A smile. Not mine. His smile, my director's. My friend's smile and the other's. They stretched, deforming my lips, my eyes black through which the poison also filtered. My body, my arms, nothing belonged to me anymore. I didn't know if it was me standing there or if the gargoyle had completely cannibalized me, if it had taken my body hostage, or if I had disguised myself as her. There was no 'me' left to kill. There was nothing left.
