Most people spend Christmas morning sitting in the living room surrounded by family. They will watch their children toss shreds of wrapping paper in the air that fall down like multicolored snow. The room will be filled with cries of delight and wonder. You’ll probably exchange a gift with your significant other as well. Maybe you will finish off the morning with a big breakfast while the kids play with their new toys.

Not me. I’ve got an ex-wife and kids. They do all of that without me.

I spend every Christmas morning taking some unlucky kid to the police station for an interview followed by an uncomfortable drive to drop them off with Child Protective Services.

That’s my gift. A new missing person case and a terrified child who can’t understand why their mom vanished.

I’ve been a homicide detective for eleven years. When you take the job, you do it with an understanding that a work/home life balance is no longer on the table. You do your best, but when calls come night and day, it ends up being a work/work setup. Sprinkle in a little home life just to make you miss being there.

For the past eight years, a single mother has been reported missing by her young children every Christmas morning.

The local papers call him *The Silent Night Killer* since the women disappear during the evening. Leave it to the media to add a holiday twist to the name. I guess that kind of stuff sells more copies.

The first woman went missing during my third year on the job. Sarah Gilbert, a twenty-seven-year-old single mother, was reported missing on Christmas morning of 2013. Her daughter, Faith, was only five at the time. Smart kid, though. When she woke up and couldn’t find her mom, she called her grandparents who went to the house immediately.

They didn’t waste any time calling the police. Two patrol officers arrived at the house within fifteen minutes. They interviewed the grandparents and little girl but received no useful information. Sarah had put Faith to bed around 8:30 PM and gone downstairs to finish wrapping presents. The half-wrapped toys still sat on the dining room table.

I was in the living room with my wife watching the kids open their presents when my work phone rang. The screen lit up with a photo of my partner, Melvin Garcia. Shaye, my then-wife, looked at me with sad eyes.

“On Christmas, Charlie?” she said. “Can you call back after the kids are done at least?”

I looked at Clara and Tyler as they gleefully ripped open a new box.

“It’s just one Christmas,” I replied. “We knew this was part of the gig when I took it.”

I hit the screen to accept the call and held the phone to my ear.

“Merry Christmas, Melvin,” I said. “Just calling to tell me the same, right?”

A booming laugh echoed from the other line. “Wish I were, my friend. Wish I were. Looks like we’ve got a missing lady over on the south side of town. I’ll shoot you the address.”

“I’ll head that way,” I replied. Shaye’s look of sadness turned to disappointment with a hint of anger. “Why are we checking out a missing person case?”

“They found blood on the floor,” he said in a quiet tone. “Not a lot, but enough that they are concerned she may not have left on her own.”

The investigation of the scene and the interviews hadn’t given us many clues but plenty of cause for concern. There was blood on the floor in front of the dining room table as reported but no traces anywhere else in the house. Sarah’s cell phone and car keys were still on the kitchen counter. No valuables were removed from the home. No prints were recovered and there were no signs of forced entry.

We discovered the backdoor was unlocked. A print from a size thirteen men’s boot was found in the muddy yard, but no other physical evidence was recovered. The interviews with Faith and her grandparents proved equally fruitless.

The neighbors saw nothing unusual. Her coworkers, friends, and family had no information on anyone that may have wanted to hurt her. Even the ex-husband checked out. He and Sarah had separated two years prior and had an excellent co-parenting relationship. While that wasn’t enough of an alibi, his distance away from the crime scene was.

He lived over ten hours away. His employer was able to provide us with security footage of him working the evening shift during the period of time Sarah would have gone missing. It wasn’t impossible he was involved, but it was highly unlikely.

We were scared the case would go cold quickly and the public would lose interest, but on New Year's Day, we found Sarah.

The caretaker of a local cemetery called 911 to report a strange object sitting on the property. When he arrived that morning, he saw a box the size of a refrigerator wrapped in black paper and tied with a crimson bow. It stood in shocking contrast to the recently fallen layer of snow.

Thinking it was a strange prank, he approached it to investigate. When he was about five feet away, he saw the rings of crimson snow spreading from the corners of the box. The sickly sweet smell of decay filled the air.

When we arrived and opened the box, we found a collection of smaller wrapped packages. As crime scene technicians opened each one, they revealed dismembered pieces of her body. She had been cut into fourteen different pieces and wrapped in cheerful paper.

Clear ornaments filled with her blood rolled around the bottom of the largest box. A few of them had shattered, leaking from the corners of the container.

Attached to the underside of the lid was a printed sheet of paper.

*Sometimes you have to treat yourself during the holidays.*

*Merry Christmas!*

Despite our best efforts, no meaningful evidence was found on the body or the packing materials. All of the paper was generic. The kind of stuff you would find at a thousand big box retailers around the country. No hairs, fibers, or prints.

Just like that, the case went cold.

Our first real lead came after SNK claimed his sixth victim in 2019.

Meredith Gillum, a twenty-six year old single mother of two, vanished just as the other victims had. Her children called 911 when they were unable to find their mother on Christmas morning. Our crime scene produced the same lack of evidence as the five that came before.

A social worker had already taken the children to the station while we searched the house. After searching the house multiple times and finding nothing of value, I decided to head back to the station and interview the kids. Melvin agreed to stay behind and manage the scene.

When I arrived at the station, I saw Margie Carson smoking a cigarette in the frigid weather. She was a veteran social worker and had the unpleasant task of being our liaison during the Silent Night killings for the past few years. When she saw me, she threw a hand in the air and waved me over.

“Merry Christmas, Margie,” I said as cheerfully as I could muster. “I hate the cause, but I’m glad you’re here.”

“You never call me for lunch,” she joked. “But I get to spend most of the holidays with you. Must count for something. I’ve got the kids inside. The two-year-old is inside with one of my coworkers, but I’ve been talking with the older girl. She has… some information.”

Margie dropped her cigarette to the ground and snuffed it on with her shoe.

“Actual information?” I asked her excitedly. “Margie, are you telling me that the kid saw something? What the hell did she say?”

“Detective Renfrow,” she started. “I’m going to let you talk to her. Anna Gillum saw something last night. I don’t want to influence what she has to tell you.”

She led me inside and we walked down the long corridor to the interview room. When we entered, I saw a red-faced little girl sitting at a table. She was pushing around puzzle pieces absent-mindedly as her body quaked with stifled sobs. My heart broke for her as it had with so many children in the years previous.

I introduced myself to the little girl and explained that I was going to try and help find her mother. Her controlled sadness broke like a dam and she started to cry aloud. Margie, one of the kindest women I’ve ever met, comforted her and asked if she could tell me the same story she had told her.

“I… I… I woke up last night to go to the bathroom,” Anna said as she struggled through her tears. “There was someone in the house. I got scared at first, but then I saw who it was.”

“Who was it, Anna?” I asked. My heart screamed wildly in my chest. No one had ever seen the killer. It seemed like it may be the break we had been waiting so long for.

“It was Santa Claus!” She said, momentarily excited. “He said he was there to leave our presents and I wasn’t supposed to see him. He made me promise not to tell anyone he was there…”

Fear and panic boiled in my gut like bile.

By 2021, eight women in our city had gone missing. Aside from Anna Gillum’s statement of a late-night visit from Santa, we had failed to collect any actionable evidence. Each scene remained the same. A small amount of blood, an unlocked back door, and no prints.

The investigation treated the witness statement seriously. No, we didn’t believe Santa Claus had sprung to life and committed a series of grisly murders, but a man disguising himself as Santa was very believable. You could find Santa impersonators ringing bells by charity buckets on every street corner. Family members dressed up to surprise their young relatives during holiday get-togethers.

If you wanted a disguise that wouldn’t be out of place, Santa Claus at Christmas was ideal.

We continued to find the dismembered bodies wrapped and packaged at various locations throughout the city. There was a new note attached each time, but the generic taunts got us no closer to a suspect.

My wife divorced me in 2017. I still loved Shaye, but I didn’t blame her. Who wants to sit and wait day and night for their spouse to come home? Who wants the disappointment of another Christmas of explaining to their children that daddy won’t be there?

For better or for worse sounds ideal until for worse is the prevailing outcome.

I saw Clara and Tyler as often as possible, but they lived with their mom. Shaye was amazing about making sure I got all of the time I could with the kids. She even invited me to our old house for the holidays. I usually made it over for Thanksgiving.

Maybe one day I could go for Christmas. Maybe Shaye would fall in love with me again. Maybe…

After the divorce, I spent Christmas Eve and Christmas Day at the station. Melvin’s marriage had survived the ups and downs, so I made sure he stayed home. If a call or tip comes in, I’d be there to take it. No need to bail water out of my sinking boat into his.

It was quiet that night for the most part. There were a few people in the dispatch center, but the night-shift receptionist had the day off. All but one officer were out on patrol. Some young buck drew the short straw to stay in the station on standby. He was snoozing at a desk in the bullpen. I’d let him rest.

My eyes felt heavy but sleep wouldn’t come. It was about 2:30 AM and I knew in a matter of hours a frightened child or their grandparents would call and report a missing woman. Melvin and I would spend Christmas Day as we always do. Another fruitless investigation and another broken family.

Suddenly I thought I heard the soft thud of feet on the thin carpet of the hallway. A young woman wearing a headset appeared in my doorway. Her eyes were as wide as headlights.

“Sir, we just received a call,” the young woman said. “A six-year-old boy just called and said Santa Claus just dragged his mother out of the house. We’ve received multiple calls from the neighborhood reporting gunshots and a white cargo van fleeing the scene.”

“Do we have an address?” I asked as I jumped from my seat and grabbed my coat from the hook by the door.

She handed me a yellow sticky note with an address scribbled on it.

“I want all available units to that location immediately,” I shouted as I ran down the hallway. “Have dispatch call Melvin Garcia and tell him to haul ass there! Maybe we can get this guy.”

I burst through the back door and sprinted toward my cruiser. Fat white snowflakes drifted through the quiet night sky. They looked almost beautiful as they danced in the street [lights.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtripp14/comments/uyezti/making_it_easier_to_keep_track_of_my_new_releases/)
