[Before](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1eiln10/student_loan_debt_is_not_what_you_think_it_is/)

I had 24 hours to save myself from a psychopathic monster who wanted to make me his living puppet because he bought my student loan debt. He had already controlled me once and I knew he would do it again.

Fortunately for me, I got a message from an old friend. His real name was something else but we all called him Blue.

*Blue: Hey, trying to be brief*, *we don't know who's watching but you're not the only loser who couldn't cut it in grad school.*

*Blue: possible solution... pack now, move quick here's the address*

You have no idea how excited I was. I did a fist pump like I just scored a bicycle on FIFA. Then I kept the celebrations going shouting. to the ceiling in defiance. Then, I immediately shut up because I realized Dummy could still take me. I still didn’t know how all of this worked. Still, anxiety flushed out of me. I wish Blue hadn't called himself a loser. Now I, was a loser. Blue absolutely was not. He was a champion in my book. He grew up in a town that Google Maps didn’t bother going to. He was so poor he didn't even have toys, he just played with his food and pretended they were VeggieTales. 

I still remember the first time he really saw a city. It was freshman year, we were coming back from dinner off-campus in Atlanta. His mouth hung open, and he couldn't stop laughing because he was enamored with what I had found so mundane, the simple city lights. I swear I saw him wipe away a tear. That was Blue, a man who could turn nothing into something and saw the beauty in everything.

*Blue: And if you have weed, please bring it.*

And that's probably why he got kicked out of his grad school. Blue had a serious drug problem in college and we were grateful he was only smoking weed now. I was saying he went through a lot to get to where he is, so he likes to forget a lot as well, and unfortunately for him that meant smoking a lot.

I had no weed or other drugs or even Truly's. I thought sobriety might help my law school experience. Apparently, it didn't and apparently, I'm the only lawyer who thinks so. My classmates did whatever they wanted and still scored better than I did. So, I packed my bags and wrestled with the guilt of not telling my parents I was leaving, maybe forever.

My mom would never stop calling and she would move heaven and Earth to find out where I was. I imagined her up all night, scrolling through her phone, googling my name again and again hoping for any leads.

And my Dad... we did fight but I knew he loved me. He would probably message random people on social media with my same name because he didn't know how social media worked.

How frustrating would that be? How sad.

I couldn't do that.

I wrote a note saying I was moving out for a bit to focus on myself before I had exams. It was stupid but they might believe it. I just wanted them safe and happy more than anything.

I met Blue around one at a coffee shop. The drive over was hectic because I was afraid for some reason I would miss him or he’d ditch me. Despite Blue’s love for me and despite him never doing anything of that sort.

I rushed in. Visible tension drew every eye in the room to my friend’s in the corner. Blue had just told them the plan for how we would escape Dummy. 

There were four of them. Three were sitting, and one (Nadia) paced the floor, yelling at Blue who sat in a beanbag chair in the middle. It was apparent Nadia hated Blue’s plan for escape.

"No," Nadia said to Blue. 

I didn't talk to her much in undergrad. I wasn't cool enough. I remember her because of her beads. She always had these long dangling braids with beads in them. On both wrists, she had thick, hand-woven bracelets, usually of a darker shade. As well as her iconic waist beads. We weren't close but I remember Blue jokingly asking if she owned a single shirt that covered her stomach. She said no and winked.

That day, the beads rattled as her hair bounced, her shoulders shrugged, and her arms waved in an expressive rainbow of anger. All of the rattles sounded like summer rain on a metal roof.

"No, no, and no," she said. She pointed one wrathful finger at Blue. "You're an idiot!"

"Yes, but--" Blue said, and the whole room waited for his answer.

"But, what?" Nadia demanded.

Blue shrugged and Blue laughed with the boyish optimistic nihilism he had in undergrad, a "what's the worst that can happen" chuckle. 

"Nadia," Ruth hopped in. Ruth was Hispanic and friends and enemies alike called her AOC or Madam President. She took it as a compliment, she wanted to be President one day so she saw it as prophetic. "Yes, a lot of Blue's choices are...interesting," she said politically. "but this idea is good. You know I take myself seriously. You can trust me."

Nadia rolled her eyes. Ruth's mouth dropped.

"Ruth," Nadia said. "You're the worst one. You take yourself so seriously and yet you're as screwed as the rest of them. That one could actually do something if he wasn't a junkie, " she pointed to Blue and then flicked her head back to Ruth. The beads sounded like a rattlesnake’s rattle. "You try as hard as you can and still fail. I mean, look at you. You want to be AOC but you dress like Hilary Clinton. 

Ruth squirmed in her pantsuit and I had never seen her try to make herself so small.

"And you." she pointed to Leon, a heavy-set guy with glasses and the nicest guy you'll meet. His eyes were lowered until he was called on. He gave her a look like he was begging to be spared, from whatever abuse she would fling on him.

"I'm sorry," Leon said without committing a sin. Nadia didn't care.

"You, fat slob How are we going to take you anywhere?"

Leon went back to staring at the floor.

"That's enough," I butted in, pissed off for Leon's sake.

"And you!" she whirled to me and the anger in her eyes matched my own rage, I didn't back down but braced myself to be cut down. "I don't even know you," she said, and with one hand pushed me aside.

She stomped to the door before Blue called out to her.

"Where are you going, Nadia? We don't have any other choice."

Nadia stopped and considered.

"I'm going home because this isn't happening."

"Nadia," Blue said. "You can't ignore this. I can see the marks on your arms. The marks where Dummy took over your body. You’ve got the same ones we all have. It is happening. You can't ignore this."

"Then, it won't be that bad."

"Nadia,  it won't be that bad? He wants to put strings in our skin. He wants us to be slaves."

"Shut up," she said.

"Nadia, this is happening."

"Shut up!" she yelled and her eyes went red.

And then I understood, it was either be mean or be afraid with her. She wasn't evil. She knew what she was saying was cruel but like an adopted kitten in a new home, she had to bite someone, because the outside world was so scary.

Truth is, we've all been there, whether we want to admit it or not. We've all hurt someone because we were afraid to be hurt. So, I forgave her and walked toward her, and extended my hand for a handshake.

"Hey, Nadia. I'm Douglas. We actually met a couple of times in undergrad, it's fine you don't remember me but I've got those same bumps on my skin that you do." I pulled up my sleeve to show them. "I know Blue is unorthodox, but we've got to trust him. Dummy is coming for us; it will be terrible, and we have to do something."

Dummy's strings pulsed inside me.

*Flap*.

*Flap*.

*Flap*.

Like thick, muscle-bound worms inside my skin they wanted to come out, not a crack, not a slice but a slow, painful progression. *For him, wasn't pain the point?* Was he already controlling us then? Maybe internally choosing who would stay and who would go? That's what I prefer to tell myself these days, I don't believe it. 

"No," she said and walked out the door. I wish that was the last time I saw her.

I sighed and moseyed over to Blue and company.

Blue stood up and shrugged and I stuck out my hand for a handshake. He pushed it out of the way for a hug. Of course, I embraced him back and felt silly for offering my hand. Blue might as well have been my brother.

"You been good?" he said post-embrace.

"What? No, I got kicked out of law school, and then someone sold my soul."

"Ah, well," Blue shrugged and gave me that smile full of optimistic nihilism. "You know everybody?"

"Yep," I said and walked over to Leon. He bungled up, shame keeping him wobbly. I was sure to embrace him in a hug, hoping to make up for Nadia's earlier disrespect.

"Leon Osbury," I said, "Best researcher I ever met in a class full of history junkies." 

Leon blushed and told me thank you, I moved over to Ruth. I know she would want a handshake so I stuck mine out.

"Madame President," I said. Her genuine smile flashed showing her teeth before switching to her rehearsed one. "I trust Blue just came up with the plan and you'll be leading us?"

"Of course," she said.

"I wouldn't have it any other way," I said, and I meant it. I understand Nadia's fear but I didn't like how she called them losers. Now, I was a loser but them no, they should never feel that way.

"Speaking of plans here's ours," Blue said.

"Take a seat, man," Leon said and I did.

"Okay," Blue started. "So, thanks to Leon researching for hours I think I know how Dummy operates now. 

“1. He will only attack us again once the 24 hours are up.

“2. His strings can only come from a man-made material that is directly above our heads. So, we have to avoid roofs or any shelter above us but trees are fine. Also, again it has to be covering your head so we can stand beside a pole but can’t go under a streetlamp.

“3. His deal is with the US government and the US government only if we go out of the country we'll be safe.

So... we're going to Mexico?"

"Mexico?” I laughed because the idea was absurd. “How? Every car, every bus has a roof and---"

Blue motioned for me to calm down.

"Madame President helped with that. She worked every connection she had She had to get us e-bikes, a path to illegally get us into Mexico, and a temporary place to stay once we got there. The girl's made to be a politician."

"I hope you can excuse the bags under my eyes," she said, "I tried to cover them with makeup. I was up all night working every favor I had. I chose e-bikes because regular gas stations have a cover his strings could come from."

"That's brilliant. Wow, yeah thanks. I can't believe it... Mexico?"

"Yeah... We won't stay there forever but it gives us a chance to strategize and find something better."

"Not bad," I said.

"Rule number 4 though,” Blue said. “He's in your bones now once he knows you're trying to escape he'll try to stop you. He'll stalk us to the border. Are you still in?"

"Absolutely."

Hunted by a monster, and sold out by our country, we rode our bikes through the scenic routes on pretty spring days that made none of that matter and made us say God Bless the US of A.

We raced through neighborhoods, ordered door dash everywhere, drank beers in parks, and saw our country. Americana is what I think it's called. Some things that are strictly American. I'm talking about Waffle House, college sports, and Breaking Bad. Dummy did ruin it because he's a monster, but I loved it until then.

We slept in trailer park parking lots and were even invited inside by a local. We declined because Dummy would have gotten us, but we told her we were declining because Leon had OCD and was afraid to go inside.

She came back with plastic baggies of fried chicken and Tupperware of macaroni. As well as a Bible and a couple of tracts to evangelize us.

She said, "There's nothing in there,” she pointed at Leon’s head. “That can't be healed by what's in here," she waved the Bible twice. None of us were religious but we kept the Bible out of respect. Then she looked at me, which was odd because I wasn't the one faking a mental illness. Her green eyes ate up every moment, her aged skin folded into a frown so intense it could make a statue shake.

"And you," she said, "You gotta believe or you'll be damned." I wanted to assume that was just the ravings of an evangelical but days later after the food was gone and the image of her face withered in my imagination, her words didn't, she put her soul quicker in those words.

"Believe or be dammed." I would wake up in puddles of sweat because I knew she meant something that was coming far quicker than Hell or Heaven. *But what?*

We pulled over and stopped at every odd and beautiful landmark on our way to Mexico from North Carolina. Poverty Point National Monument, The Georgia Guide Stones, Congaree National Park, and the Ballantyne Monuments ( we couldn’t go on highways so we ended up in some random spots) and many more.

We pulled over to one of those cheap plastic amusement parks. You've passed them if you're from the Midwest or South sorry, West Coast. They're strange patches of land that had to be popular in other eras. They're on the sides of highways in middle-of-nowhere towns, drive too fast and you'll pass it, but if you only had one eye you wouldn’t miss it.

It's a patch of green grass stuffed with giant plastic animals and you're supposed to pay to drive through it. Sometimes the plastic giants have a theme like Christmas, this one was animals, that were on the borderline of copyright infringement.

We paid the $20 a person to enter the park but of course, before we went in Blue really wanted to smoke and on the rare occasion we all joined him this time. The kid (and only worker) at the park smelled it on us and asked for a hit this gave Blue free reign to get high out of his mind. Which was fine for a while because we were having the time of our lives.

Blue begged for us to take a picture of him offering a tree-size gorilla a blunt. We obliged and laughed all the way.

Ruth posed genuinely red-eyed and genuinely demure beside a knockoff Godzilla and did her hair and pressed her suit, apparently, she was a real fan of the creature.

Leon climbed in the hands of Minnie and Micky Mouse and posed like a child. It was the funniest thing I had seen in years. He made us swear to not post the pictures.

It was all so stupid, so silly, so fun, so America that we all walked around forgetting Dummy and his strings could come from anything above us. How unfair.

The first bad weather of our trip came in a storm. Thunder bashed the world. Lightning hounded it in only seconds. Rain lashed in, beating our skin and flooding the land. Leon tried to pull a passed-out, smoked-filled, and happy Blue up. He resisted half-awake choosing to dream in the grass instead.

“Leave him,” Ruth had to yell because the plopping of the rain canceled out so much noise. “He’ll be fine it’s just rain. The lightning will hit one of the statues before him.” Madame President herself scanned the area for where we should shelter. Of course, we knew the small shack they had for ice cream and restrooms was out of the question. But we were high, too high, so we didn’t think about how dangerous everything else could be.

On the far end of the park, the villain side of the park, stood a giant mummy with its hand extended out, like it was trying to grab you.

“We can stay dry under there!” Ruth yelled over the thunder and pointed toward the mummy statue.

It seemed so odd. Stereotypically weed is supposed to make you more paranoid, but stoners will tell you it depends on the strand. Blue gave us a strand full of bliss and it was such a mistake. I finally felt content; all of my anxiety and self-hate left.

Unfortunately, that made it hard to think. The three of us stumbled into the villain side of the park. It was fated to happen this way I suppose. Ruth loved the weird and the strange and that which made our skin crawl.

Plastic dark lions, snakes, wolves, spiders, crows/ravens, bats, rats, sharks, black cats, owls,  and hyenas stood at the side and watched us descend into a massive mistake.

I caught the eyes of the off-brand Other Mother to my left from the story Coraline, a childhood fear of mine. A knockoff Wicker Man, a giant humanoid statue, where human sacrifices were made inside of stood to my right and I felt as if it mocked me and that shook me to my core.

“Guys, you’re falling behind you’re making me nervous," Ruth shouted from the front.

Our thoughts treaded over time, unable to stabilize, and much less articulate. Blue's perfect strand of anxiety-melting weed put a wall over any thought that screamed danger was near. My mouth hung open and I even drooled a bit as I watched Ruth's hair bounce ahead of me. A storm cloud rolled above us and thunder smacked the summer day.

"You’re all so quiet," Ruth said dreamily.

20 steps away from the massive Mummy we walked beside smaller statues of knock-off villains. Clowns and dragons and spacemen and witches. 15 steps away and we saw in what we thought was a single dark purple string under the hands of the mummy. 10 steps away and the Thunder rolled, as if in a warning. 5 steps away and it didn't matter. We were close enough. She was close enough.

“Guy’s wait,” Ruth said, a step inside the finger of the Mummy. “Does this count as shelter?”

Before we can answer that single string whipped into action. It latched onto her tongue and pulled. As rain came down her tongue swung up. High, high, and higher still into the Mummy's hand and disappeared into darkness. More strings came for her, but she had the presence of mind to roll away.

She turned to us. Red poured out like a waterfall mixing with the clear celestial rain making it seem like some strange Kool-aid.

She moaned and groaned in sounds that would be as foreign to her as they were to us. *Imagine having to scream without a tongue.* She felt it each time she made a noise, I saw new hopelessness dilate her eyes. They became wider, bigger, and more empty with each futile noise that came from her mouth. Ruth was a smooth-talker, a future politician, and Madame President. She lost her one gift the thing that got her this far; she lost her voice.

She faced us and we held her arms. She turned around to go back under the hand that could save her. We pulled her back.

“It’s gone, Ruth!” I yelled. “We have to leave! C’mon!”

We rushed to Blue and our bikes. The rain did some good and had him partially awake. I smacked him twice for the other part. We got on our bikes and tore down the street, but what was the point? Dummy stole Ruth’s voice.  He was winning. Too bad he wasn’t done.

We got what we wanted in a way. Blue (and the rest of us) didn't smoke again. He also didn't smile until the end of the trip. No congratulations were given to him from us for complete sobriety, and the world around us seemed fit to punish us.

Spring showers spit on us day and night. The wind wheezed at us with such intensity that we couldn't ride for hours, slowing our journey by days. We settled in for the night near a set of train tracks. We sat in the unmanicured wooded area of the tracks for mild shelter, and across the tracks was a fence and then multiple houses.

During daylight, a black couple walked in the gravel beside the train tracks. The swollen bags of clothing, and clothes they wore that they would never fit into told me that they were homeless. They kept looking back at us. The man shot us death stares and pushed his wife to the inside and away from us. What a sight we were that even the homeless thought we were disgusting.

The man in the XXL polo led his lover in the pink dress. They wandered to a home I didn't think was theirs. It was a graffitied bridge. That's not the image I had in my head of the owner, a couple. I assumed whoever slept under a bridge would be lonely. That's their right anyway, loneliness. Because everything must be earned. Why would love be so different? And love must be earned through finances. That may be true in my life. However, it appears it is not true everywhere.

"There are winners and losers and it's something in your blood," my Dad used to tell me. "And winners get everything."

My dad made it clear though that I was a loser and all my failings socially and otherwise were built on my lack of success economically. He made it clear I was unworthy of good friendships because I wasn't where I wanted to be in life. And he was certain to make me understand that a girlfriend for me would be out of the question because I'm a failure.

How long until my new companions abandon me? Surely, they'll see what I really am. They all have good reasons for their failure in school but me, no way. I was born to be a failure and unfortunately, I'll die that way.

Both the train and thunder got closer. The thunder brought rain and lightning flashed in big blinks. Large trees guarded both sides of the track before you got to the gravel. They covered the train's approach. The conductor blared his horn and the train whipped by us.

That night we put our bags on the gravel rocks and Blue made a fire out of newspaper. He took complete responsibility for what happened to Ruth and despite his depression, he was determined to be more helpful than ever.

I didn't go to sleep easily.

The phrase from the older woman 'Believe or be damned' still haunted me. I was sure that it wasn't about a spiritual hell but an Earthly one. So what then?

A scream slapped the night and shook me awake. Blue, Leon, and Ruth remained asleep. I didn't wake them. I assumed they needed the rest. The scream turned to gasps, something like choking, it was frightening. Something was dying, something close. I wanted to help and wanted to flee at the same time.

"Hnk,"

"Hnk," the thing moaned.

Death was here again. I thought of Ruth's face again and I cried. I hadn't cried at all for Ruth and it came out now.

Something or someone tore through the night. It was slim and quick and moved on two legs. Fragments of street lights lit the thing in flashes. It appeared and reappeared in quick blurs. It turned left, dashing with indigent purpose toward us. It stopped just before it could be fully lit by the fire.

I shot up and saw the homeless woman in the pink dress from before. She froze and stood just outside the fire so only her lower half was clear. Her upper half was a faceless dark blob. Her crusted toenails and tearing sandals shifted constantly; she was nervous.

"Sorry," she whispered and raised her hands in repentance, "I need your help."

I examined her. It couldn't be Dummy. She didn't owe him money so he couldn't control her.

"What do you want?"

"My husband's choking! He's choking!" she said. "Can you help him?"

"What do you want me to do?"

"I don't know anything, please!" she begged with enough passion I believed her.

"Okay, fine."

She waved me over and wobbled over past the tracks. The darkness painted her body the same black blob she was before. I chased her, tripping over the tracks and crashing through gravel.

The light from houses to the left of the track lit her whole body in flashes as we went closer and closer to the bridge. She was there and gone. In each flash of darkness, I imagined she'd turn around and attack me, her puppet strings allowing her to swing in the air.

It didn't happen though. We arrived at the bridge without incident.

I was careful to remain just outside of the bridge. She crept under.

"Hnk."

"Hnk,"

"Hnk."

Her husband choked under the bridge.

"Help him," she begged, invisible in the bridge's darkness.

"Okay, yeah pull him out."

"What?"

"Like, um pull him out from under the bridge and I'll help."

She remained mute and invisible. There was another sound though even beyond her husband choking. I heard a rattle.

"Hnk."

"Hnk."

"Hnk."

"You need to come under the bridge," she said.

"Why?" I asked. My blood froze, my voice cracked and remained in my throat. The rattle under the bridge remained.

"Hnk."

"Hnk."

"She said come under the bridge, Douglas," a voice mocked from the darkness in front of me.

I knew that voice and where that rattle would come from.

"Nadia?" my voice trembled.

"I'm choking the life out of this bum, Douglas," she said, the beads in her hair, waist, and braids rattling freely now. "He didn't do anything, Douglas. How about you come under this bridge and we can wrap this up."

"How? How are you here?"

"Our boss sent me, you see I get to travel because I surrendered to Dummy earlier. And I got to keep my tongue." She laughed full of malice.

"Nadia you don't have to--" I spoke into darkness and she cut me off.

"I want to. This is a much better deal than what you're getting. Bum lady, if you don't want your husband to die bring Douglas underneath the bridge."

"Hey, wait--"

The homeless woman leaped from the bridge. Spit, crooked teeth, and black gums flashed in front of my face. She tackled me. Her knee slammed into my balls. Her face scratched at my face. My skin burned. I raised my hands to cover. She mumbled apologies or curses; it was hard to tell. The words were fast, random, and felt more like a chant than anything.

The flesh from my arm ripped away.

"Stop… please," I begged. She ignored.

"Everyone's strong when they need to be," my Father once said to me. She proved it.

She kneed me in the groin again. I saw stars. My head jerked back. The pain was impossible. She lowered herself and pulled me by my feet to her cave like a lion does its prey.

I didn't resist. I was letting her. I was letting her take me to my doom.

This would be my end.

If not for Leon. He came in with his bike and knocked the lady off of me. I gasped for air and sat up. Leon was still uncontrolled though and crashed under the bridge. By a miracle, he was able to roll out though the bicycle was snatched.

We ran back to the group and evacuated. After an hour of driving, Leon and I sharing. We stopped by a random cornfield. My heart finally stopped racing. I got off the bike and tried to compose myself. Blue grabbed me by my shirt collar.

"What's the matter with you?" He said and pushed me in the chest. I couldn't believe him. This guy of all people was blaming me for something after what happened at that amusement park.

"I made a mistake, okay?" I said and pushed him back. I don't think I had ever pushed anyone before.

"It wasn't a mistake; you cost Leon his bike!"

"At least I didn't cost anyone their tongue!"

"You think I don't know that!" he barked back. "I'll never smoke again, alright! I get that at least I know what I did wrong."

"Yeah, sorry I trusted a homeless person. That was my mistake." I put my sarcasm on full display.

"No, that wasn't it. You went because you don't care about your life."

"What? That's nonsense."

"You didn't care if you lived or you died. You let an elderly woman almost drag you to your grave. You're stronger than her! You're a grown healthy man."

"She had adrenaline; it was life or death!"

"Where was your adrenaline, huh? You don't put others before yourself because you love them, you put others before you because you hate yourself. Listen, we've talked before, man. I know your Dad hurt you, man in ways I don't even think you understand. But you make all these excuses for why everyone else is great except you. I don't know, man. I'm just asking you to like believe in yourself or something, man. You went there because you don't give a fuck about you. But we give a fuck about you. I guess. That's what I'm trying to say."

He walked away from me and camped for the night.

After thirty days of travel, we made it. Our contact in Mexico left three inflatable tubes sat on the bank beside a roaring river. It was over. We cheered and cried. The time was full of mourning because even then Ruth couldn't speak. As Ruth hopped in the tube and flowed downriver I came upon a strange realization.

Ruth's tongue was stolen because that was Dummy's attempt to break her. He planned to take away her one talent. It didn't work though, Ruth is climbing the ladder in politics to this day as an advocate for the mute and was instrumental in having several US laws passed. I'm unsure if the US would ever have a President who can't speak but she's still in a good position to give it a try.

"It was wonderful travelling with you guys," Leon said and then hopped down the river.

Leon was next and I understood why they let him go and only stole his bike. Because of Leon's size and mistreatment, he always felt like a burden so having to hop on the back of someone's bike was embarrassing and would only increase that feeling. I believe Dummy hoped he'd just up and quit on the journey. He did not. He rolled all the way down that river. Leon uses his empathetic nature and servant's heart to run an orphanage along with his wife and I think he's expecting a kid.

Blue smiled at me, shrugged, and then pushed himself down.

Blue hopped in the river last. His burden was obvious. Dummy hoped to get him to quit through guilt. It was partly his fault that Ruth lost her tongue after all.

But what did Dummy have in store for me?

As I watched Blue disappear down the river, a sense of hollowness crept over me. The waves smashed against the rocks, the danger felt real and ever-present. The shore felt vast and empty, as did I. I won. I should have accepted this and been excited.

"Douglas."

The voice came from beneath a nearby bridge, and despite everything, a part of me felt relieved to hear it. Nadia emerged, her vibrant and loud style replaced by a stark uniform: white button-down shirt, black slacks, and a bow tie. She was a marionette, strings and all.

"Hello, Douglas," she said, the strings moved her jaw up and down.

"Hello, Nadia," I replied.

"Douglas, please don't go. We have an offer for you."

I knew I should run, jump into the river, and follow my friends to freedom. But fear rooted my feet.

"What's your offer?"

Nadia's eyes held a placid acceptance. "You... Douglas, you know as well as I do that you can't make it out there in that big scary world. You're not like them, and you don't have to be anymore. Dummy says if you come back, you can get ten years off your sentence."

Her words struck a chord deep within me. This was what I'd always believed about myself. I wasn't cut out for the real world. I was somehow less than those around me.

"Does it hurt?" I asked, hating how small my voice sounded.

"Just a little," Nadia admitted, "but there's peace too. Much more peaceful than a strange world you don't belong in."

I gazed at the river and pictured my friends riding to freedom. Blue, with his optimistic nihilism. Leon, with his quiet strength. Ruth, silenced but unbroken. They all had something to offer the world. But me? What did I have?

My father's words echoed in my head: "There are winners and losers, and it's something in your blood." Had I been fighting against my nature this whole time?

I took a step toward the bridge, toward Nadia. Another step.

The old woman's words from days ago rang in my ears: "Believe or be damned."

I wanted to believe in myself, I truly did. But you have no idea how hard it is to shred a lifetime of self-doubt and perceived failure. Honestly, the thought of facing an uncertain future, of having to prove my worth day after day, terrified me more than Dummy's strings ever could.

I would step under the bridge, and feel a twisted sense of relief. This was my calling, wasn't it? To be a supporting character in someone else's story, never the hero of my own.

"I'm ready," I told Nadia, my voice wavered.

She nodded, a sad smile playing on her lips. "Welcome home, Douglas."

I was one step away and paused. This was what Blue was talking about. This was what he meant about me not loving myself. What if today I just decided to love myself? I did, and without a word to Nadia I ran away and jumped in the tube to go downriver. It was the best decision I ever made.

Ten years later, Dummy is gone thankfully so we're free. I'm not sure where he went. Probably, whatever world he is from. Nadia is finally free; we met recently. She is not the woman she was before. Serving Dummy did a number on her.

Nadia said when the first string pierced her skin, she closed her eyes. The pain was excruciating, but underneath it, she felt something else: the absence of choice, of responsibility, of the need to believe in herself. And in that moment, as wrong as it was, she felt peace.

Believe or be damned. In the end, she couldn't believe. And so, she damned herself.

The punishment was far worse than she expected. She cried and mourned and regretted her decision. She begged for freedom, but it was denied. Day and night she toiled without sleep because it was not a necessity; her body ran on puppet strings. Dummy's fingers were her engine.

And Dummy wasn't done with just her. No, Dummy made Nadia sign up everyone she knew, everyone who loved her, to be indebted to him. Her family, her friends—everyone she cared about, she was forced to ensnare in Dummy's web.

A decade of her life was stolen, and who knows how many more years she'll spend trying to reclaim her freedom, her identity.

Believe or be damned.

Dear reader, if you do not believe in my story, that is fine. But I beg you: At least believe in yourself, or you might end up like Nadia. I almost did. In the end, while you live on this mortal plane the only person who can truly damn you is yourself.

As for me, I believed in myself, and guess what? It worked out. I'm a financial analyst. I loved the research, analytics, and study that came from law school; I just folded when it was time to present. Lucky for me, I have a wonderful partner who does presentations for me. I will marry her this year by the way. Shh, don't tell her though it's a surprise. Looks like belief paid off for [me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Finchink/comments/1f5n0qi/what_happened_to_dummy/)
