As far as I knew, I had gone deeper into the bizarre other word that existed inside of Pop’s Grocery than anyone had before. I had discovered an end to the supposedly endless aisles: a wall of freezer-burned refrigerators with two rusted double-doors in the middle: doors which, in my reality, led to the cold storage area. As I stepped through them, some instinct screamed that I was making a mistake, that this was my last chance to turn back: I ignored it. I had come this far, and who could say if I would ever be back here again?

When I didn’t hear any doors close behind me, I knew something was wrong. The employees at Pop’s were constantly complaining about how the doors swung shut with a vengeance, always smashing the foot or shoulder of whoever was pushing a palette through to the other side, but the moment I stepped through, it was like the whole place I had left behind had ceased to exist. The doors, the refrigerators, the endless aisles–they were all gone. The fishing wire went limp in my hands.

A bare concrete floor stretched on as far as the light of my headlamp could reach. The space was dark…and freezing. My employees and I usually put on an extra layer when we worked in cold storage, but the temperatures here were so low that my teeth were chattering. I put on the heavier clothes I’d brought in my backpack. My grandfather had been right: expedition-quality gear was needed while exploring…wherever this was.

I started walking forward–or at least in the direction I thought was forward. The emptiness of the space was starting to get to me; the cold was too. I just needed to see some kind of landmark, some sign that the darkness I was trapped in didn't just go on forever...

I almost fell down the stairs. They were the same ugly gray color as the concrete floor–almost like they’d been made to blend in on purpose. By who or what, I couldn’t imagine, but this was a first: there were no stairs in the cold storage area of Pop’s, and none had been mentioned in my grandfather’s journal, either. Was this where it all ended? Had Frank Kelch, Sheriff Paulson, and my grandfather all reached this point, too–and never come back from what lay beyond it?

There was only one way to find out. I pulled my knit cap a little tighter over my ears and started down the stairs. The air got colder and hazier the further I went, filled with tiny floating particles, like dust. I was just beginning to wonder what they were and whether breathing them in might be dangerous when a white-hot burst of pain exploded in my shin. I tumbled forward, crashing into a wall that signaled the end of the stairs. My blood turned to ice when I realized what I had tripped over: it was another fishing wire. Someone had been here before!

I got to my feet, brushing clouds of blackish-gray dust from my clothes. To the right was an eerily-ordinary door that read *“MANAGER:”* it probably led back to the maze of offices I knew so well. Wary of awakening whatever was on the other side, I looked left, where the fishing wire led down a tangled corridor of cords, tubes, and rusted pipes.

Each time the corridor branched in a new direction, I followed the fishing wire. I knew it was foolish to believe that whoever had placed the wire knew the way out of here, but it was the only hope I had. Frayed electrical wires hung down like cobwebs from the low ceiling; pipes jutted out into the narrow passage like vines in some bizarre industrial jungle. Just as I was stepping over one, I heard an uncannily familiar sound up ahead: a roll of fishing wire unraveling. I rushed around the corner up ahead, eager to meet whoever was exploring this place with me. I should have known.

I got lucky. The shotgun blast deafened me, but missed taking off my face by just a few inches. Shrapnel from the wall sliced into my cheeks as I instinctively hit the floor, hands over my head.

“Don’t shoot!” I screamed at the short, stocky figure standing at the far end of the hallway. He had a yellowed miner’s flashlight taped to his shotgun and wore gear that looked like Korean War kit from some army surplus store. I rolled backwards as he fired a second time.

“LIAR!” A hoarse voice roared. “You won’t fool me, you beast, you hellspawn! *DIE!*”

More deafening shots blasted the wall; a few of the pipes began leaking a murky reddish liquid that steamed as it oozed out of them, but I had bigger problems: the crazed explorer was charging me. All I could do was run, following the most convoluted path in the hopes that my pursuer wouldn’t be able to get a clear shot. As I sprinted away from the deranged, howling voice behind me, the corridors became…stranger. The walls and floor were no longer entirely concrete and wire; parts of them were uncomfortably spongy and warm to the touch. The branching pipes took on organic shapes that reminded me uncomfortably of human veins.

“Liar! Face-stealer! What did you do with Eddie?!!”

*Eddie…Edgar Lee…my grandfather!*

Another shot hit the wall in front of me. This time, an awful moan reverberated through the corridor. I couldn’t shake the feeling that this part of Pop’s was alive somehow–and that we were making it angry. The ragged wires hanging from the ceiling now seemed more like hair; the floor became uneven and…bone-like. I had to act. Crouching behind a sharp corner, I took off my backpack. When my pursuer came charging past, I swung it into his face as hard as I could. The big man went down…but kept his grip on the shotgun. I coiled myself around it, fighting to pry it from his grasp as he fired twice more into the ceiling of the corridor. By the time I wrangled it away from him, it was out of ammunition…and more of that murky red goo was dripping from the ceiling above him.

I looked down at the now-empty shotgun. “Paulson” read the name engraved into the stock.

“I’m not a monster!” I shouted. “I’m Edgar Lee’s grandson!”

“That’s impossible…that’s…that’s…” It seemed to take Sheriff Paulson a moment to realize how absurd it was to think that anything was *‘impossible’* in a place like this. “It got to Eddie. He’s a part of it now. My God…how…how long have I been here?”

Sheriff Paulson looked to be in his early sixties–probably the age he was when he, Frank Kelch, and my grandfather began exploring the place–but I wasn’t concerned about that then. I was more worried about the ragged mass of black tendrils hanging down from the ceiling above Paulson, from the hole that he’d created by firing so wildly with the shotgun. I had thought it was my imagination at first, but those wires–or hairs, or whatever they were–had begun to stretch downward toward the heavyset old man on the floor. Before I could shout a warning, they had coiled around him, lifting him toward the black fissure in the ceiling.

“You won’t take me–no, you won’t take me–NO!” He flailed his arms wildly, but it was too late. The ragged reddish stuff that the ceiling was made of chomped down on Paulson again and again until nothing was left of him apart from a single gore-splattered boot, which tumbled to the ground at my feet. The tendrils were inching toward me now, and I had no intention of being consumed as Paulson had. I sprinted forward, fleeing even deeper into the maze of tunnels.

*I came here looking for answers about what had happened to my grandfather, but now that I had begun to find them, was I really sure that I WANTED to* [know](https://www.reddit.com/r/beardify)*?*
