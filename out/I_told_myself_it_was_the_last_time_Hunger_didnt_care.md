I sat beside my father’s body until the sky started to lighten again.

Not because I was honoring him.

Not because I was grieving properly.

I didn’t even know how to grieve anymore. My chest felt hollow, like someone had scooped me out with a spoon and left the empty shape behind. My hands were sticky with blood and salt, and every time I tried to wipe them clean on my shirt, they just smeared more.

The rooftop was quiet in a way that felt wrong. The woman’s body was twisted where she fell, neck bent like it didn’t belong to her anymore. One of the men was facedown, half in a puddle of rainwater and gore. The other lay on his side near the edge, eyes open, staring at nothing.

Four bodies.

One of them was my father.

I didn’t scream. I didn’t cry. I just stared.

Below us, the city drifted. The water moved slowly through the streets like it was thinking. Now and then, something bumped against a wall and floated away again. A shopping cart. A mattress. A wooden door. A body.

The flood didn’t feel like a disaster anymore.

It felt like an animal.

Patient. Hungry. Never satisfied.

At some point, I crawled toward my father’s face. I pushed the wet hair off his forehead the way my mother used to do when he fell asleep on the couch. His skin was already cooling.

His mouth was slightly open like he was going to say something, and I kept waiting for him to finish the sentence.

He didn’t.

I didn’t know what to do next.

I kept looking for “next,” like life was still a normal story where things happen in order. But after the wave, after the blood, after the sound of my father’s last breath, there was no order left.

There was only one survivor.

By midday, my stomach began twisting again.

It wasn’t a gentle hunger. Not the kind you get after school when you’re excited for lunch. It was sharp and ugly, like claws scraping the inside of my ribs. My mouth tasted like metal. My throat felt swollen. Every time I swallowed, it hurt.

I tried drinking the last water.

There wasn’t much.

Just enough to make me want more.

I looked around the rooftop like food might magically appear if I stared hard enough. Like my mother might step out from behind the water tank with a plate in her hands and tell me to stop being dramatic.

But the rooftop had nothing left.

No supplies.

No rescue.

No miracles.

Only bodies.

My eyes landed on the woman again.

I didn’t want to think it. I didn’t want that thought inside my head.

But it came anyway, quiet and simple, like my brain was just stating a fact.

*She’s meat.*

I pulled my knees to my chest and squeezed my eyes shut.

“No,” I whispered. My voice sounded wrong. Too dry. Too adult. “No.”

The hunger didn’t go away.

It got louder.

My body started shaking. Not from cold. From something deeper, panic mixed with need, like my skin itself was begging. I remembered my mother’s hand grabbing mine when my father said Chennai. I remembered her humming. I remembered her heart against my ear.

Then I remembered the taste of mango.

And I realized I would never taste it again.

That’s when I broke.

I didn’t stand up like a monster in a movie. I didn’t grin. I didn’t suddenly become fearless.

I crawled.

Like an animal.

My hands were shaking so badly I could barely grip the broken glass shard I’d found near a shattered window frame. It was small, jagged, sharp enough to cut skin but not clean enough to make anything easy.

I dragged myself to the woman’s body.

I stared at her face for a long time.

She looked young. Not much older than my mother.

Her eyes were half open. Her mouth was slightly parted like she was still trying to breathe. For a second I convinced myself she was alive.

Then I saw the way her neck was twisted.

And I knew she wasn’t.

“I’m sorry,” I whispered, and I meant it. I meant it so much my throat burned.

Then I pressed the glass shard against her arm.

My hands shook harder.

I couldn’t do it.

I pulled back and gagged. My whole stomach flipped like it was trying to turn itself inside out. I crawled away, retching nothing but bitter water and air.

But hunger doesn’t stop because you feel guilty.

Hunger doesn’t care who you are.

It only cares if you keep breathing.

I crawled back.

This time, I didn’t hesitate as long.

The first cut wasn’t deep. Just a slice. But blood welled up anyway, dark and slow. I stared at it like it was poison. Like it might jump up and accuse me.

My hands moved again.

I carved.

Not because I wanted to.

Because my body told me I had to.

It took hours. The shard was dull. My arms cramped. My stomach screamed. My head felt light. I kept whispering “I’m sorry” over and over like saying it enough times could cancel out what I was doing.

When I finally had a piece small enough to lift, I stared at it until my eyes watered.

It didn’t look like food.

It looked like proof.

I brought it close to my mouth and froze.

My whole body fought itself. My throat tightened. My teeth refused. My stomach churned.

Then my hunger decided for me.

I bit down.

The taste hit instantly.

Metal. Salt. Something warm and wrong.

I gagged and spit it out.

My throat burned like acid.

I cried then.

Not tears like sadness.

Tears like pain.

Like my body was rejecting what my mind already knew.

I wiped my face with my sleeve and tried again.

Second bite.

Slower.

I chewed like it was rubber.

Swallowed.

My stomach lurched but held.

I sat there shaking, staring at the piece in my hand like it was alive.

I don’t know how long I stayed like that.

But eventually, the hunger eased.

Not gone.

Just quieter.

And that terrified me more than anything.

Because part of me expected to feel guilt so big it would crush me.

Instead, I felt… relief.

My stomach didn’t scream anymore.

My head stopped spinning.

And the worst part?

I realized I could do it again.

That was the first time.

But it wasn’t the last.

That night I didn’t sleep.

Not because I was haunted by what I’d done.

But because every time I closed my eyes, I saw the woman’s face staring at me, not angry, not sad… just empty.

And when she smiled in my dream, I woke up choking.

The next morning, I moved what was left of her under a plastic tarp and shoved it beneath a broken water tank, where it stayed colder. I told myself I was doing it to keep animals away.

But there were no animals left.

Only people.

And people were worse.

I spent the next two days watching rooftops.

Watching shadows.

Watching movement in the distance.

Because after the flood, you don’t wait to be found.

You wait to be hunted.

And somewhere inside me, something quiet and cold started learning the same lesson.

**If you want the rest, I’ll post it. But after this point… it only gets worse.**
