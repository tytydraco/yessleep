Begin transmission from \[REDACTED\], Quarantine Lvl 24    


  
Okay. I’m back. For those of you who are new, please check my first transmission above. I’m going to try and write as much as I can, but I can’t guarantee I’ll get through it all. The guards are doing random cell checks now. I have to be extra cautious.   


  
“Face down on the ground.”

  
“NOW!”

  
“Hands behind your back!”

  
I felt a pair of cold metal cuffs clamp down on my wrists. “Am I under arrest?” 

  
“Quiet.” The power plant’s security guards dragged Abby and I to our feet, our hands cuffed behind our backs. The guards wore tactical body armor, the kind of stuff you’d see special forces wearing. Definitely not what I expected for a power company. Gas masks covered their heads. “Don’t say another word.” Their voices were filtered through small speakers attached to the masks. 

  
Other guards grabbed Colton. He was still lying on the ground in a catatonic state. I didn’t see what happened next because someone covered my head in a thick black cloth bag. It was pitch black inside. Even the sound was muffled. God, my parents are gonna kill me, I thought. I was their oldest son. The responsible one. Never getting in trouble. Always making straight A’s. They didn’t even know I was part of the Night Riders. All our urban exploration missions were nights I supposedly slept over at my friends’ house, a fellow Night Rider. I’d never even been grounded for Chrissakes. For them to learn that I had trespassed on a power plant. No! That I was part of a bombing. Are we terrorists now?   


  
The guards led us a dozen yards away. We were placed into the back of an SUV or van. Some sort of big vehicle. It didn’t drive very far. When we got out, the air felt still, like we were inside a vacuum-sealed room. My footsteps echoed off of distant walls. The soles of my shoes squeaked on the floor. Probably tile. What is this place? I wondered. Some kind of CIA black site? Were we being led to a prison cell? Or something worse?

  
“You’re not under arrest.” A woman’s voice said nearby. I think she was escorting us. She sounded concerned, yet kind. Gentle. 

  
“Then why am I in cuffs?” 

  
“For your own safety,” the woman said. Her voice sounded filtered too. Probably speaking through a gas mask or hazmat suit. 

  
Safety? How would we be a danger to ourselves? My footsteps went from squeaks to metal clangs. Clang, clang, clang. The sounds were closer now. Louder. We had entered  a small room. Someone led me to a chair, forcing me to sit down. They strapped my hands and legs to the metal furniture. Then, they removed the cloth bag from my head. 

  
“What?” I was sitting inside a large, windowless box with metal tubing covering the walls and ceiling. The guards who led me there quickly left the room, closing a steel door behind them. The only exit.

   
“Jason? Where are we?”

  
I craned my neck. Abby was in a chair facing the opposite direction. Also tied down.

   
“I don’t know.” 

  
“Did you see what happened to Col—”

  
A loud squeaking interrupted us. Microphone feedback. Then I heard the kind woman’s voice again, filtered through a speaker somewhere inside the room. “Just relax. The decontamination process will only take a few seconds. It may look scary, but we promise it’s painless.”  

  
“Painless?”

  
There was a loud, mechanical WHINE. The tubes covering every inch of the room began to glow deep orange. A horrible thought crossed my mind at that moment. I felt like Abby and I were inside a giant oven. And they’d just set it to its maximum temperature. The glow became brighter and the WHINING grew louder. But there was no heat. If anything, the air inside the room was cooler than before. Cold. Icy cold. I tried to open my mouth to speak, but I was suddenly overcome with exhaustion. My eyelids grew leaden. And before I knew anything else—

  
Darkness.

I woke with a gasp, lying in a hospital. My clothes were gone. I was naked beneath a gown. Various medical devices beeped and whirred around me. There were electrodes attached to my head, neck and chest. An oxygen mask covered my face and an IV was hooked into my right arm. “Hel—hello?” I tried moving my arms, but they were restrained. I was strapped to the bed. I’m sure they would say it was for my own safety, but it certainly felt like I was a prisoner. 

  
I checked my surroundings. The room didn’t have any windows. At least not to the outside. There was one window, but it only revealed an adjacent room, similarly decked out with medical equipment. Am I in an ICU? I couldn’t tell if it was still night or the following day. Or even days later. Abby and Colton were nowhere to be seen. 

  
A man entered the room. He was tall, wearing a full-body hazmat suit. 

  
“Hey! Where am I?” I was worried my voice was muffled by the oxygen mask. 

  
The man glanced at me. He looked like some old college professor. “Shh. It’s ok. We’re just running a few more tests.” 

  
“Tests? Tests for what? Where are my friends?” 

  
The man didn’t answer. He turned around, checking the machines while writing notes on an iPad. That’s when I saw a symbol emblazoned on the back of his hazmat. I nearly gasped. It was the same circuit board I saw in the drains: the one with all the wires that led to a grotesque humanoid shape. There was no writing accompanying the symbol. 

  
“Where am I?”

  
Still no answer. 

  
A light turned on in the adjacent hospital room. I watched through the window as a group of hazmats wheeled in someone on a stretcher. I could barely see the patient. Just glimpses through the crowd. It was a woman. She wore a uniform for the Frog Hollow Power Plant. Her skin was pale, almost translucent. But that’s not what made me scream. 

  
What made me scream were the fungal growths sprouting from her eye sockets and mouth. They were blue-green and shaped like flowers, glowing faintly beneath the fluorescents above. The fungi bloomed, revealing tiny mouths within. Tiny, screaming mouths. The screams were shrill, like steam issuing from a boiling tea kettle. And as soon as I heard them, I screamed too. Like an involuntary reaction. Like the screaming was contagious.

  
The hazmat monitoring me grabbed a syringe and hooked it into my IV. As soon as he depressed the plunger, I was overcome…

  
Darkness…

I woke up on a thin cot, immediately sitting up. Was it a nightmare? I was wearing a plain blue jumpsuit, no longer restrained. That’s when I took in my surroundings. “Fuck me.” 

  
I was inside a tiny, windowless prison cell. Just a bed, sink and a toilet. Thick metal bars covered the entrance. I’m not under arrest, huh? Beyond the bars lay a blank hallway. No signage. No windows. No evidence of where the Hell I was. 

  
Then I heard something that gave me hope. 

  
“Jason? Are you awake?”

  
It was Abby. She sounded close. “Where are you?” 

  
“In the cell next to yours. They brought us here after the hospital.” 

  
“Who’s they?”

  
“The power plant people,” Abby said. “I think we’re still here. I think we’re somewhere under the main facility.” 

  
A million questions ran through my head. How much did Abby know? How much had she seen? Did she see the fungus? Was that even real or just some drug-induced hallucination? “Abby,” I finally said. “What’s happened to us? Where’s Colton?”

  
“I don’t know.” Her voice was hoarse. Like she’d been crying. 

  
“Are we… contaminated by something?” 

  
“No!” 

  
I nearly jumped. Someone was standing right outside my cell. An Asian woman, mid-40s, wearing a fancy tailored suit, short haircut and a serious expression. She was flanked by two muscular guards holding AR-15s. 

  
Before I could speak— 

  
“What were you three doing here?”

  
“We’re not saying anything until you tell us what happened to our friend,” Abby said. She sounded defiant, but there was a strong undercurrent of fear in her voice. 

  
The woman pursed her lips. “I’m sorry. Let’s start from the beginning. My name is Yumiko. I’m the new owner of Frog Hollow, the facility you three just tried to blow up.”

  
“We didn’t mean to,” The words just spilled out of my mouth. But as soon as I said them, I knew how ridiculous they sounded. They’d obviously seen the explosion and its aftermath. “I mean, we never planned —” I stopped short. I didn’t want to place the blame on Colton. They wouldn’t believe me even if I tried.

  
“How about you tell me your names first?”  

  
“No,” Abby said. “You have no right to detain us like this. You’re not police. This is—”

  
“What? Kidnapping?” Yumiko laughed. “You have no idea how much trouble you’ve caused.” She paced back and forth between our adjacent cells as she continued. “You’ve done immense damage to this facility. We still don’t know the full extent, but it will take a long time to get everything back to normal. And as for your friend: he’s currently in our intensive care ward, suffering from toxic shock.”

  
“Toxic shock?” 

  
“How much do you know about this place?” Yumiko stared into my eyes. 

  
Nothing, I almost said. Colton was the one who handled all the power plant research, though that was relatively scant according to him. There was very little public information about the plant’s “state-of-the-art natural gas facility.” According to Colton, who spent hours scouring the Internet, the details were annoyingly vague. But Abby remained silent next door. And I wasn’t going to give up anything if she wasn’t. 

  
“Look. The police are on their way now,” Yumiko said. “But I can help your case if you give me something to work with.” She kept pacing. “Are there any others involved with this bombing?”

  
No answer.

  
“How long have you been planning this operation?”

  
No answer.

  
“Did you see anything tonight you couldn’t explain? Anything… unusual?”

  
Still nothing. Abby continued her silence next door. 

  
But I was getting antsy as Hell, pulling my hair, rubbing my sweaty palms against the pants of my jumpsuit. Yumiko keyed in on this. She stopped pacing between the cells, focusing only on me instead of the both of us. “I don’t have to tell them about the bombing, you know. I could simply say you were trespassing on the property and accidentally triggered a power surge.” Her iridescent green eyes locked on mine.  

  
“It’s just us,” I said. “Just the three of us.” 

  
“Jason—” Abby blurted angrily from next door, but she stopped short, recognizing her faux pas.

  
“Jason, is it?” Yumiko smiled. “Well, Jason. Do you mind telling me more about this plan the three of you concocted?”

  
“Is our friend going to be ok?” I asked.

  
“His condition is stable, but it will take time for him to fully heal.”

  
“We heard screaming when the bomb went off—”

  
“Those were the screams of our employees. They were scared for their lives.”

  
“It didn’t sound like human screaming,” I said.

  
“I’m sorry. Are you the one running this interrogation?” Yumiko asked. “You answer my questions or you’ll receive no help when the authorities arrive.” 

  
“Don’t say anything else,” Abby blurted from next door. 

  
I had to force my mouth shut, my mind was brimming with so many unanswered questions. So many burning mysteries. But Abby was right. There was no use saying more. We couldn’t trust anything the power plant workers said. What reason would they have to help us? After we’d allegedly tried to blow up their plant? 

  
“We’ll wait for the police to arrive,” Abby said with some finality. “Thank you!”  

  
Yumiko issued a long sigh, staring at the floor. “Fine,” she said. Then she looked back up at me. She was about to say something more when— Her phone vibrated in her pocket. Yumiko pulled out the cell, answering. 

  
“Yes?” 

  
A muffled voice answered. I couldn’t hear what the person on the other end was saying, but they sounded frantic. Downright terrified. Yumiko didn’t speak the whole time. She just held the phone to her ear, listening… And her face grew more and more concerned by the second. Finally she hung up.

   
“What was that?” I asked, referring to the call. 

  
Yumiko just looked at me with this strange expression, like a deer in the headlights. Then, she motioned to her armed guards and the three of them left down the hall, shutting a door behind them.

    
“HEY!” I shouted. “Wait! What’s going on?”

  
“Forget it,” Abby said. “They’re not going to tell us anything.” 

  
I went up to the bars, near where our two cells met. “How’s the leg?”

  
“Fine. They patched it up in the hospital ward.”

  
“You were there too?” I thought about the fungal victim in the ICU. Did she see that woman too? “Abby… What the fuck is really going on here? You heard that screaming, right? When the bomb went off?”  


  
“I don’t know what I heard,” Abby said. “But I don’t think this place is running on natural gas or coal or whatever the Hell they tell the public… It might not even be a power plant.” 

  
“What do you mean?”

  
“You saw those armed guards?”

  
“Yeah.”

  
“This feels like something military,” Abby said. “Like a top secret project. The power plant is just a cover.” 

  
“Military?”

  
“Yeah. Like they’re building weapons here or something.”  

  
“You’re right. Maybe chemical weapons? I saw someone in the hospital. She… She looked like she had… some kind of disease.” I sighed. The immensity of the shit we were in was still catching up with me. “We’re going to prison for this, aren’t we?”

  
Abby started to respond, but she cut herself off as—

  
All the lights went out in the building, plunging us into pitch darkness. 

  
“Shit. Another power surge?” 

  
We heard muffled shouting coming from somewhere deeper in the building. Too far to discern what they were saying. But there were a lot of voices. And they all sounded frantic. Almost as soon as they started, the voices stopped, replaced with gunshots. Machine-gun fire echoed through distant hallways.  

  
I ran to the back of my cell, cowering behind the cot. Jesus! It sounded like a war was raging. Abby must be right. This is some kind of military base. I curled into a ball and shut my eyes, hoping it would all be over soon. The gunshots died down, but they were replaced with something worse. Heavy thuds. One after another. After another. The noises brought a sickening image to mind: bodies hitting the floor, blood splattering the walls. Finally, the thudding stopped. All was quiet. I kept my eyes shut.

   
After a few seconds, a series of soft yellow emergency lights flickered to life. Then I heard the creaking of metal doors. I opened my eyes. The door to my cell was ajar. “Huh?” I was still hunched in the back corner of the room, terrified of what lay in the gloom beyond. Until I heard a familiar voice…

  
“Jason?”

  
Colton stood outside my cell. He wore a jumpsuit just like mine. His right hand was bandaged, the hand that had held the flip phone. But otherwise, he appeared unharmed.
