A little backstory, my little sister died 2 years ago and my parents have still not been able to cope with her death, and act like she is still with us. This used to be fine at the beginning because everyone copes with death in their own way, that was until they started talking to her. This may sound incredibly weird but my parents frequently go to her room to talk to her and have long conversations with her to the point where they would spend hours in there. This was around when they first told me to stay out of my sisters room at all costs even if I heard someone calling me in. At first I found this request weird but obeyed and eventually it slipped my mind completely.

That was until today when I heard my sisters scream my name from her bedroom and I instinctively ran to her room without even taking a moment to think and just when I was at the door I remembered my parents word and stopped staring at the door. I continued to stand there as I pondered what I heard, was I imagining it or did I genuinely hear my sister's voice again. That was when the crying started from in her room. Someone was sobbing and screaming… in my sister's voice.

 I was horrified as my parents were not home and though horrified I inched my hand towards the door knob. I was considering whether I should enter. My parents had told me on multiple occasions to never enter the room and at this point I didn't want to either, but I had to get answers. So I turned the knob and pushed the door back, only to find a clean and tidy room with all of her stuffed toys and dolls kept the exact way she had left it before she died.

 It was weird seeing her room after 2 years of not being able to enter but it was nice. I looked back on the times we had fun and how close the two of us were. That was  when I remembered what I came in for to search for the source of the voice and the crying. And that was when I noticed the one object out of place, her favourite stuffed teddy. She always kept her stuffed teddy on her bed and I even remember seeing it there while she was in the hospital. I went up to it to examine and that was when I noticed something on the back of the bear. A zipper which had never been there throughout the years of me playing with her there had never been a zipper on the bear. It shook me to my bone because why would my parents add a zipper if the rest of her room had been kept in perfect shape.  

I unzipped it and jumped back inside the zipper was a … human heart it looked like it had been preserved as if someone cleant it recently and was making sure it didn't rot and that was when it started beating and the door slammed behind me and I could here a maniacal laughter coming from all around me. It's been 5 hours since then and I'm still stuck in the room. My phone is almost dead and I'm posting this to get help hoping someone can save me.
