**Summary:** Starting in late 2022 we started getting reports of a fast food restaurant named Jammy Burger that people were finding in <REDACTED> Mall in Edina, Minnesota. The path to the burger place goes through a staff only hallway on the basement level. Rumors of hidden places come across our desks pretty often, but this one popped up with more frequency than usual. Then on July 23rd, 2023, agents retrieved a cell phone with video showing Jammy Burger, the trip there, and what followed. The videos are from the phone of Haley Burke(23), and involve 3 of her friends. They have been identified as Eric Pearson(22), Jacob Mathews(23), and Demi Fisher(23). All four of them are currently the subject of missing person cases.

The videos will be transcribed below.

**Video 1:** Timestamp – 10:17am, June 17th, 2023.

Video opens in a bedroom. Haley is recording as the four of them are mid conversation.

>Eric: -does exist!

>Jacob: There’s not a hidden burger joint in the mall.

>Demi: <giggles> You’re so dumb.

>Haley: Honey, show them the picture.

Eric pulls out his pone and starts searching for something.

>Jacob: Why are you recording all of a sudden?

>Haley: So I can see the stupid look on your face when Eric shows you how dumb and wrong you are.

>Jacob: Pfft, my face is never-

Eric Turns his pone around and shows the screen to Jacob, who makes a dumb face.

>Haley: Ha! That’s a pretty dumb face there, Jakey!

>Jacob: It- man. What is that?

>Eric: It’s Jammy Burger, over at <REDACTD>.

>Jacob: We grew up at <REDACTED>, there’s not a food court like that. Where’d you even get that creepy shit?

>Eric: From Mike. Sent me a text last week, said it’s real.

>Demi: Mike is messing with you, he probably just got bored walking around there at night.

>Haley: Mike doesn’t really play around like that. If he says it’s real, I believe him.

>Jacob: Man, let me call him real quick.

Jacob pulls out his phone and dials Mike

>Jacob: Come on... Voicemail, of course.

Jacob pockets his phone.

>Eric: It doesn’t even matter, because he told me how to get there and we’re gonna go tonight and check it out.

>Demi: Uh… Okay, so let’s pretend this place is real. Look at that photo. It’s creepy as fuck!

>Eric: Well, yeah. He took it at night during rounds. The entire *mall* is creepy at night. I’m sure it’ll be fine during the day.

>Jacob: When we get there and it turns out Mike played you, you owe me and Dem diner.

>Haley: And if it’s real, you buy me and Eric a Jammy Burger. Deal?

>Jacob: Deal.

Jacob snatches the phone from Eric’s hand and holds it up to the camera. The photo is hard to make out, as it is a bit out of focus and shaky. It appears to be an older style food court with all the lights off. A bright red sign is the only light. It’s hard to make out in the video, but it is the sign for Jammy Burger.

>Jacob: There’s no way this creepy-ass place exists. Free dinner, baby!

Footage ends.

**Video 2:** Timestamp – 4:23pm, June 17th, 2023

Video opens with the group moving out of a parking lot towards the <REDACTED> Mall entrance near the AMC theater.

>Haley: Ahh, <REDACTED>. It’s like we were just here yesterday.

>Demi: Weird how it’s so similar to when we came here in Highschool.

>Eric: I actually come here  a lot. I go to the gym where J.C. Penny used to be.

>Jacob: No kidding? How is it?

>Eric: It’s pretty good. Normal new-ish gym. But we’re here for Jammy Burger.

>Haley: Lead the way!

The video shows them enter the mall and walk passed the theater. The mall is pretty busy, lots of people walking around.

>Eric: We just need to head down to the basement level.

>Demi: Ooh, haven’t been down there since-

**Video 3:** Timestamp – 4:31pm, June 17th, 2023

Footage picks up looking down at Haley’s feet as she descends an escalator.

>Haley: -don’t know, it’s being weird. Oh, there we go.

Camera pans up showing the rest of the group below her starting to step off the escalator. Demi is moving off to the right towards what appears to be a dance studio.

>Demi: Ah, memories.

Jacob puts his arm around her and they talk quietly for a bit. As Haley steps off, Eric walks passed her to the left. The camera follows him and pans across an unused, unusually large empty space with beige walls, then passed some kind of art exhibit, before turning back to the escalators. Eric is walking towards what appears to be a service door along the back wall.

>Eric: I think this is it.

Jacob and Demi enter the frame from the left from under the escalator.

>Jacob: I don’t think we’re supposed to go in there.

>Demi: When I used to dance here we’d tell stories about that door. Spooky kid stuff. You know, scratches a whispers, knocking. We tried it a few times, but it’s always been locked.

>Haley: You ever hear anything like that? The knocking or whatever?

>Demi: Not personally, but some of the girls said they did. You remember Sarah? She wouldn’t even walk over here. Said she heard something calling her name from back there one night after practice. She eventually stopped coming to practice because it freaked her out so much. 

>Jacob: Well, that *is* spooky.

>Demi: I mean, that’s what the *girls* said. She probably just moved or something.

>Eric: Mike said it’s just a service hallway to another part of the mall.

>Demi: Our instructor told us it’s just a maintenance closet. I’m pretty sure mike is full of-

Eric opens the door revealing a long hallway. It’s well lit, but the walls are unfinished. Typical for mall maintenance hallways.

>Eric: That’s… not too spooky.

>Jacob: I dunno. Does the mall even go out that far?

>Eric: I don’t think so, but I guess it makes sense, right? That food court isn’t in this mall, so this must go to some other building. Come on!

Eric starts down the hallway, followed shortly by Haley.

>Haley: Are you sure about this?

>Eric: It’s just a service hallway. Worst case, if we get caught and we’re not allowed here, they’ll escort us out. No big deal.

>Jacob: I do like a good adventure. <quietly> It’s fine, you’re okay.

The camera pans back showing demi holding Jacob’s arm tightly.

>Haley: So Mike just said to go down here and it leads to the other food court?

>Eric: Yeah, basically. He said it leads to some other mall, a lot smaller. Mostly closed. Only the food court looked like it was still used.

>Jacob: Guess it’s hard to compete with old <REDACTED>.

>Demi: I guess it’ll be cool to check it out before it closes. I can’t picture where another mall in walking distance would even be, though.

>Jacob: Yeah, come to think of it, aren’t we headed toward-

Footage ends.

**Video 4:** Timestamp 4:58pm, June 17th, 2023

Footage picks up walking down the hallway, approaching a right hand turn.

>Eric: -is the third turn, here, see? Mike said this was the last one, then we’re basically there.

>Jacob: Did he mention walking for a fucking hour?

>Haley: It’s only been like 15 minutes you big baby.

>Demi: If it’s much farther, I want to turn around.

>Jacob: Yeah, this feels… weird.

Eric walks around the corner, followed shortly by Haley. There is a door a short way up the hall.

>Eric: Ah, Jesus. Finally.

>Haley: Yay!

>Jacob: We finally there?

Eric opens the door slowly, revealing a small mall wing.

>Eric: Whoa, wild.

Eric looks around, then walks out.

>Eric: Ha, wow. Where even *are* we?

>Haley: We’ve been walking long enough we could be anywhere. Which way to the food court?

>Eric: Should be to the right, up these stairs.

They walk through the mall quietly. All of the stores appear abandoned, with the gates down. None of the store names left up are recognizable.

>Demi: Does this all seem…. Wrong to you guys?

>Jacob: It’s just an old mall, babe. There’s something about old, abandoned places that feels strange for sure. But if the food court is open, it’s just a normal mall. We’re okay.

>Haley: I don’t recognize any of these stores. You ever hear of… Game Bucket?

>Eric: No. What about Gwendoline’s Jewelers?

>Jacob: Must have been one of those off-brand malls.

>Eric: Oh yeah, those super normal off-brand malls with all the weird stores.

>Demi: I don’t like it.

>Jacob: Don’t listen to him, it’s fine. Probably why we never heard of this place.

>Haley: And why it’s abandoned.

>Eric: Here we are!

Eric quickens his pace towards an escalator. A sign above it reads “Food Court: Second Level”.

Haley follows him up, panning back quickly to see Jacob and Demi following them.

>Eric: There it is! Jammy’s!

As Haley reaches the top she pans around a small, mostly empty food court. A taco place called Crunchy’s, a pizza place called Hot Cakes, and Jammy Burger are the only open stalls. There are about eight other stalls which are various states between completely abandoned and maybe just closed for the day. The bright red sign for Jammy Burger casts a red tint on everything in the entire area.

>Eirc: Didn’t expect a line.

Eric walks up to the short line for Jammy Burger, followed quickly by the rest of the group.

>Eric: I am way more excited than I should be.

>Jacob: I don’t know, it smells pretty good.

>Demi: It does. Wish that sign wasn’t so bright, though.

Eric approaches the counter after a short wait.

>Employee: Welcome to Jammy Burger, what can I get you today?

>Eric: I guess just a regular Jammy combo.

>Employee: What to drink?

>Eric: What do you got here… What’s Crystal Soda? Is that like Sprite?

The employee begins to look nervous.

>Employee: Are you guys from, uh… out of town?

>Eric: Naw, we were all born and raised in Edina.

The employee squirms a little, then collects himself.

>Employee: Of course. Crystal Soda is a, how do I describe this… an independent brand. Artisan Soda, I guess. All the shops down here use them. It probably is like Sprite.

>Eric: Ah, great. Crystal Soda then.

>Haley: Same for me, everything.

>Employee: Two Jammy combos with Crystal Soda.

>Jacob: Make it four. I’ll have, uh… Brown Daddy’s, I guess? Babe?

>Demi: Crystal is fine with me, thanks!

>Jacob: How much?

>Employee: You guys are new to the mall, yeah?

>Eric: Yeah, where even are we?

>Employee: Not far from <REDACTED>, actually. You guys come through the service hallway?

>Halley: <hesitant> Yeah…

>Employee: Well, that was probably pretty spooky, yeah? How about I cover your meal today?

>Jacob: You serious?

>Employee: Yeah, no worries. Enjoy your meals!

>Eric: Awesome, you’re the best!

Eric goes for a high five, but the employee backs away.

>Employee: Sorry, I have a germ thing.

>Eric: Ah, no worries. Thanks again!

>Employee: Of course, food will be right out. Have a seat anywhere.

>Jacob: Thanks aga-

**Video 5:** Timestamp – Corrupted

Footage begins looking down at Haley’s lap.

>Haley: -wrong with my phone. Anyone got signal?

>Demi: Nope.

>Eric: Hold on. Me either.

>Jacob: Same, weird.

>Unidentified man: You guys order Jammy’s?

Camera pans up to a man in a black suit holding two trays of food.

>Eric: Yeah. Four Jammy combos?

>Unidentified man: Yep yep yep. Three Crystals and, who gets the Brown Daddy?

>Jacob: Right here.

The man places the trays on the table.

>Unidentified man: Our guy back there says you’re first timers, from the big mall.

>Eric: Yeah. Are we… in trouble, or…

>Unidentified man: No, nothing like that. Just wanted to make sure you guys are comfortable. We get people through there every now and then. Sometimes they’re stressed out for some reason or another. It’s a long hallway, guess it can get under some peoples’ skin.

>Haley: It was weird, but fine. Just a long walk.

>Unidentified man: Well, you’ll probably find the streets around here confusing if you haven’t been around here before, so just make you go back through the maintenance hall, alright?

>Demi: Yeah, actually where are we? I’ve never seen this mall before, and my phone isn’t working.

>Unidentified man: To be honest, this isn’t the safest area in town. Bad cell service is the least of… I’m freaking you out, sorry.

>Demi: No, it’s fine.

>Unidentified man: The mall is perfectly safe. Area isn’t as bad as I probably made it sound. But the hall is your best bet for sure.

>Eric: <mid bite> Alright, thanks. Dang, this is *good*.

>Haley: Eric! Manners!

>Unidentified man: Ha! It’s alright. Glad you like it! Enjoy your meal, guys.

>Jacob: Man, this *is* good.

Haley films the man walk back behind the counter and start talking to the Jammy Burger employee. They look up at her and she turns to Demi, who appears to also be turning away from them.

>Demi: Okay, that’s weird, right? He was in a full on suit. Like a nice one.

>Eric: Probably security.

>Haley: Then why’d he bring us out food?

>Jacob: Sounds like he was checking up on us. Eat up, ladies. It’s super good.

Demi looks worriedly at the camera, then starts eating.

>Demi: We should hurry th- Damn, this is *great*.

Footage pans down then cuts off.

**Video 6:** Timestamp – Corrupted

Footage begins with Eric throwing their trays away and waving to the Jammy Burger employee. The man in the suit is no longer present. Eric returns to the table as Haley pans around the room.

>Haley: I just feel like we should have known this mall existed before now.

>Jacob: There’s probably tons of places we don’t know about in town. It *is* weird that it’s connected to another mall’s basement, though.

>Eric: You guys want to head outside? Get our bearings?

>Demi: Not really. I’m kind of freaked out. Let’s just go home and we can look on Google maps and find it later.

>Haley: Yeah, I kind of want to get out of here. Something feels off.

>Jacob: I’m good with that. Probably not much to see around a dead mall anyway.

The group gets up and walks back to the escalator.

>Eric: What the fuck?

Eric points back towards the door and the man in the suit is standing by the door with another man in some kind of maintenance outfit. He sees the group and waves them over.

>Demi: Guys…

>Eric: He said it’s fine. They’re probably just gonna lock the door behind us or something.

>Haley: Eric, I don’t like this.

>Eric: Is it really less weird to run outside right now?

The camera pans back passed the food court to a hallway ending in a massive glass door. Most of the windows are boarded up.

>Haley: Let’s just go.

They descend the escalator quietly and approach the two men at the door.

>Unidentified man: Hello again, guys! Enjoy your meal?

>Jacob: It was great. Are we, like…

Jacob trails off nervously. The man in the suit laughs.

>Unidentified man: No, no. You guys aren’t in trouble or anything. I just called maintenance down to make sure the lights were working, make sure you get back safe.

>Demi: Have the lights been an issue before?

>Maintenance man: Occasionally. Everything looks good, though. You guys mind locking the far side door behind you? Should be a button on the knob. You’d be saving me a half hour walk.

>Eric: Yeah, no problem. Thanks, guys.

They enter the door and the footage ends.

**Video 7:** Timestamp – Corrupted

Footage begins facing the floor, moving down the long maintenance hallway.

>Haley: -think I got it. Yeah, recording again.

Footage pans up showing a long hallway in front of them.

>Jacob: Why?

>Haley: Why… am I recording?

>Jacob: Yeah? We’re just walking down a long-ass hallway.

>Haley: Like, in general, or specifically right now? Right *now* I’m just trying to get my phone wor-

Haley is cut off by the sound of a door slamming shut. It sounds close. The camera whips around backwards showing the hallway stretching into the distance behind them.

>Jacob: What the fuck was that?

>Eric: A door.

>Jacob: <whisper shouting> No shit! But there are no doors in this stupid hallway! That sounded close, man!

>Haley: Eric, I’m starting to freak out.

Haley pans back around and stifles a scream as she sees a door right in front of them where the long hall was just a moment before.

>Eric: What the fuck?

>Demi: How is there a door here?

>Unknown voice: <from far behind them, raspy> Sarah… *Saaaaaraaaaaaah*…

>Jacob: Okay fuck that.

Jacob tries the handle to find it locked, but then just kicks the door open.

>Jacob: Come on!

Jacob holds the door as the four of them rush through it, then slams it behind them.

>Jacob: That was *not* okay, Eric!

>Eric: The fuck did *I* do!?

>Haley: Guys! This isn’t anyone’s fault! We’re safe now, we’re…

The camera pans across the mall. It’s dark, and appears to be night time.

>Haley: What…

>Demi: It should be like five thirty, at the latest, right?

>Eric: Shit, I still don’t have signal.

>Jacob: What the *fuuuuuuck*. We need to get back to the car. Can we even get out of here?

>Eric: Yeah, you can just push the doors open from the inside. 

>Demi: What if the doors are locked, though?

>Eric: I used to hand out in here with Mike after hours, and I’d just walk out. They’re the push bar doors, it’s fine. Let’s go.

The four of them quickly walk up the escalator.

<Unknown voice: <from downstairs, muffled, raspy> Demi? Deeeeemiiiiii.

>Demi: <in tears> Guys?

>Eric: It’s okay, we’re going to get out of here.

They move more quickly. As they move back towards the AMC entrance there is a loud crash from behind them, like a door being slammed open. There is an animalistic scream which appears to originate from the basement area.

>Eric: Run!

>Demi: I can’t, my ankle!

>Jacob: Come here.

Jacob puts Demi on his back and sprints off. Eric follows behind him, and Haley is having trouble catching up.

>Haley: Eric! Slow down!

Jacob, Demi, and Eric are pulling away from Haley down a very dark mall hallway. It’s getting harder to see them in the camera.

>Haley: Eric!!!

Eric doesn’t appear to be able to hear her. In a few seconds they are completely gone.

>Haley: Eri-

There is a low growl from somewhere nearby. Haley starts hyperventilating and rushes to a nearby bench and scrambles under it. She puts a hand over her mouth as something large passes by. It’s impossible to make out what it is in the darkness, but it’s much larger than a person.

>Unknown voice: <very close, raspy> Demi. Deeeeeeeeemiiiiiiiiii…

There are a series of loud, quick thuds as whatever is passing the camera moves quickly down the hall towards her friends. Haley has her hand over her mouth, trying to stifle frantic crying.

Footage ends.

**Video 8:**

As footage begins, the phone appears to be in Haley’s pocket. There are sounds like fabric rubbing on the mic as she seems to be running.

>Haley: What the fuck. What the fuck. What the fuck. What the fuck.

It sounds like Haley starts to open a push bar door when her phone chimes.

>Haley: Huh? Oh please have signal, please please please…

She retrieves her phone from her pocket, revealing the AMC entrance door to the mall.

>Haley: What.. why is it recording ag-

>Unknown voice: <far behind, raspy> Haley… Haaaaaleeeeeey…

Haley makes panicked sounds and pushes through the door, then stops. There is no parking lot outside  as she passes through the door. The camera shows a vast, empty void with a smooth black surface for the ground.

>Haley: What… what am I looking at? Where…

>Unknown voice: <close behind, raspy> HAAAAAALEEEEEEEY!!!!!

Haley gasps and spins around. The mall is gone, the void extends in every direction. Haley screams and starts to run away from the voice.

>Unknown voice: <very close, booming, raspy> **HAAAAAAAALEEEEEEEEEY!!!!!!**

>Haley: <panicked, crying> Please, no!

Points of light start to appear in the void, each a different color. A loud humming sound starts to distort in the mic.

>Haley: <barely audible over the distortion> Please!

>Unknown voice: <highly distorted, incomprehensible, raspy>

Haley screams, footage ends.

Haley’s phone was discovered by mall security and kept in lost and found for a week before being handed over to local police as part of her missing person investigation. Our organization was made aware of the footage and collected it from them. 

The four friends are still officially missing along with Mike Walker, a security guard at <REDACTED> Mall and known associate of Eric Pearson.

Our investigators searched the mall, but did not find the hallway in the door on the basement level behind the escalator. No known structure exists in the area surrounding <REDACTED> Mall matching the mall Jammy Burger was found in.
