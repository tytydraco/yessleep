I had always been fascinated by the idea of time travel. As a young man, I had big dreams and aspirations, but as I grew older, I found myself stuck in a dead-end job, with a failing marriage and no real purpose in life. I couldn't help but wonder what my life would have been like if I had made different choices. That's when the idea for the time machine came to me. I became obsessed with the idea of being able to go back in time and fix the mistakes I had made. I knew that it was a long shot, but I was determined to make it happen.

I spent years studying physics and mathematics, trying to understand the intricacies of time travel. I poured all my time and energy into the project, sacrificing my job, my relationships, and my health. Finally, after years of hard work, I had built a working time machine. I sat in front of the machine, my heart pounding with excitement and fear. I knew that this was a momentous occasion, a turning point in history. I took a deep breath and flipped the switch.

To my amazement, the machine whirred to life, and I felt a rush of nausea as I was propelled through time. I had done it. I had built a time machine. I traveled back in time to my childhood years, determined to fix the mistakes that had led me down the path of unhappiness. I knew that I had to focus on my education, so I hit the books and studied harder than ever before. I was able to achieve great grades and landed a scholarship to a prestigious university. I also knew that my social life had been a problem for me, so I made an effort to make better friends and be more outgoing and confident. With these new friends, I was able to learn new skills and make valuable connections that would help me in the future. I also listened to my parents and took their advice. They were always there for me, and their guidance helped me make better decisions.

But one day, while I was walking back home from school, I saw what I thought was an outline of a very tall and somewhat deformed human-like creature. I brushed it off as a hallucination and continued my walk home. But as the months went by, I kept seeing the creature. I became determined to find out what it was. I started doing research, trying to find out if there were any historical records of this creature or if anyone else had ever encountered something similar. But I found nothing. I then searched deeper into the physics and mathematics of time travel and couldn't find any explanations. Eventually, desperate for answers, I delved into the world of the occult and discovered that the creature was a higher being designed to stop anyone from tampering with time, a safeguard to prevent catastrophic events from happening.

I knew that the creature was not trying to communicate with me; it was a higher being sent to stop me from tampering with time. However, I couldn't shake off the feeling that the creature was always watching me. It started to appear in my dreams, tormenting me with visions of me changing the past and causing chaos in the timeline. I tried to communicate with the creature, but it remained silent, only appearing to torment me in my dreams. I became paranoid, not being able to shake the feeling that the creature was always watching me. I knew that I had to stop using the time machine and accept the choices I made and learn from them, but the creature made it impossible for me to do so. I was trapped in a never-ending cycle of trying to escape the creature's watchful gaze, and I knew that it would not rest until it succeeded in killing me. Every passing day has been making me feel more paranoid and I don’t believe I can handle it anymore so I have decided to give myself up to the creature. I believe this to be a warning to anyone capable of time travel, don’t do it or you’ll suffer the same fate as me.
