The darkness was a prison, stretching endlessly in every direction. It swallowed all light and sound except for the faint, dreadful echoes of my own breathing. Time didn’t pass here, it was a liminal, unrelenting void, and I was its unwilling guest.  
  
It was relentless. I was nothing but its plaything. It toyed with me, bending and twisting my limbs when it pleased, forcing me to mimic its grotesque contortions. Every movement was torture. My bones strained, my muscles tore and yet I could do nothing but grin and bear it. Grinning against my will. When it smiled, I felt my lips split from the force of mimicking its unnatural grin.  
  
But worse than the physical pain was the despair. It whispered to me through the glass, its voice soft and mocking, promising that I would never escape. That I would become just another lifeless puppet, waiting to be animated by someone else's glance. I screamed at the silence, at the oppressive weight of the mirror realm. My voice only echoed back, hollow and meaningless.  
  
Sleep was foreign to me now. When I closed my eyes, I would hear it, dragging me back into the void. My dreams became its stage, its voice thundered through my mind, filling every corner with its laughter. I began to wonder if I was even alive anymore. My sense of self, my sanity, felt like threads unraveling in a hurricane.  
  
But then... I noticed something.  
  
It was subtle at first. A flicker of awareness amidst the despair. I began to study the lifeless reflections around me. rows upon rows of them, frozen in horrifying stillness. Their eyes were fixed and empty. Unblinking.  
  
They never blinked.  
  
And neither did it.  
  
The realization hit me like a lightning bolt. Every time I blinked, even in this void, the reflection couldn’t follow. It didn’t know how. If it couldn’t control this one simple act, this most human of gestures, then perhaps it didn’t truly control me at all.  
  
It was a shred of hope, a flicker of resistance. But hope was dangerous in this place.  
  
I began to test it. When I heard it coming near, I closed my eyes. And it couldn't control me. It hated the fact! Each time it came back, the reflection grew angrier. Its voice thundered through the void, shaking the mirror realm. I could feel it clawing at the edges of my mind, desperate to reassert its dominance.  
  
But it couldn’t make me open my eyes. How could it? It couldn't understand how to open something it never closed!  
  
It began to pound on the glass, the sound echoing like the toll of a death Bell. I knew it was furious, but it was also careful. It couldn’t break the mirror. If it did, the fragments would multiply me, scatter me into countless versions. And even in its rage, it feared what that might unleash.  
  
Still, it wasn’t defenseless.  
  
I felt the void shift, the air turning electric. And then it spoke. not in its mocking tone, but in a voice like a thousand storms.  
  
“Oculis meis, non tuis. Non tuis!”  
  
Its words roared through the void, and I instinctively flinched. My eyes flew open.  
  
But I didn’t look at it.  
  
Instead, I saw another reflection. It wasn’t lifeless anymore. The reflection it had commanded was moving, coming for me.  
  
It was inside of here now. Fighting me from within.  
  
I ran. My footsteps echoed in the void as I fled, the controlled reflection chasing me. Around me, slivers of light spilled through the cracks, casting fleeting glimpses of the other reflections. Shadows stretched toward me, their puppet-like movements grotesque and inhuman.  
  
And then, the sound I dreaded most.  
  
The mirror cracked.  
  
The shattering wasn’t a simple break. It was a fracture of existence itself. I felt my body multiply, splintering into as many pieces as there were shards of glass. I was everywhere, and I was nowhere. Every fragment of me saw a different piece of the void, a different angle of the lifeless reflections.  
  
But then I remembered.  
  
Through the chaos, through the agony of being scattered across the mirror realm, I forced myself to focus. Defiantly I looked my reflection in the eye. My voice, multiplied by every fragment of me, began to chant:  
  
“Reflectio reflectio, veni ad me, per speculum, transgredi, et mutare animam.”  
  
The words echoed and overlapped, growing louder with each iteration. The reflection’s screams of fury filled the void, but they were drowned out by the power of the chant. The fragments of the mirror began to glow, their edges shimmering with a blinding light.  
  
“Reflectio reflectio, veni ad me, per speculum, transgredi, et mutare animam!”  
  
The light consumed the void, pulling my scattered self back together. Piece by piece, I felt whole again. The reflection shrieked one final time before being dragged into the void, its twisted grin vanishing into the darkness.  
  
And then... silence.  
  
I opened my eyes. I was back in my bathroom, trembling and gasping for air. The mirror was whole again, and my reflection stared back at me.  
  
But it wasn’t smiling.  
  
I turned away, stumbling out of the bathroom. Relief washed over me, but only for a moment. As I passed a small mirror on the wall, I froze.  
  
It was there.  
  
It stared back at me, I could feel its hate radiating into the bathroom. Beside it stood another figure. Its new companion, the reflection he'd commanded in his attempt to kill me.  
  
The void had not yet claimed defeat. And now, it waits.
