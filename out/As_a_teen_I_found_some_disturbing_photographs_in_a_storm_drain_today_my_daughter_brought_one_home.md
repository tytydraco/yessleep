It wasn’t all the storm drains, just one. One tucked-away room with shit so vile my mind buried it as deep as it could. That was until today, when my daughter came home with that damn picture and my skull gave way like a dropped egg and it all came spilling out. The year was 2002 and I was a senior at some local suburbanite high school. There was nothing to do but laze the days away getting high off cheap dope but even that got tedious.

Then we started smoking in the storm drains after a kid in our clique showed us a local spot he liked to tag. We eventually hauled a sofa left curbside there so our asses could be pampered as we got stoned off them. It was fun until my friend Phil thought I made a pass at his girl. A few bruised knuckles and a black eye later I was out and more isolated than ever.

It didn’t help that I had been under a lot of stress lately, I had been arguing with my mom more than ever and it was entirely my doing. Failing grades, wrong crowds, and drug habits that could have gotten me into some deep shit back then.

I caused a lot of grief for my mother who despite it all tried her best to raise me all by herself, I resented her for all her shortcomings then but now all I feel is regret that I never got the chance to apologize before her passing. It’s no wonder she was at her wit's end when this was what she was supporting. You don’t realize how much of a shithead you were until you’re older. To this day I regret storming out into the cool December air. Not just because of what I would find, but also because something died between us that day.

She didn’t chase after me or make any threats, she just let me go. It was only 7:30 at most but this time of year the sky was black as midnight. I opted to walk through the strip of deep suburbia, the night was beautiful and it would take me through Shady Oaks. As the largest suburb in my city, it mainly housed the upper middle class and was aptly named since there were almost no street lights and porch lights were almost as rare, but not unheard of.

I got a rude awakening when I tried sparking a joint only to be interrupted by a nosey elderly man on his porch. I snuffed it out, shrugged, and chose to walk off. I eventually found an unmarked trail lit only by dim moonlight marked. It led to an unmarked path into a local creek and in the distance was the blackened silhouette of a bridge. It framed what I thought would be my salvation, a storm drain.

I had never been to this particular one but you have to understand that because of a combination of previous experiences and teen bravado, I felt no fear, no apprehension. Moonlight did not stream in more than a few inches so I was left to wander in the dark until I felt comfortable enough to flick on my keychain flashlight. The pitiful beam it cast out dissipated after only a few feet but it was enough to keep me moving forward.

I found a spot I felt comfortable and leaned against a wall and relit my joint and was about to take a hit when I saw it. The dim glow of my lighter illuminated the walls around me and they all lacked one detail, graffiti.  Places like this and vandalism were basically synonymous.

I pulled out my keychain flashlight and shone it around for the next few minutes, looking for anything until my light hit a black void, an empty space within the wall, and impulsively I stepped closer. It was an entrance, a door to another chamber that smelled rank. This entire place was damp and foul smelling but the scent here caused my hair to stand on end, It was acrid, sharp, and pervasive.

I crept in, shining my light around at the room within, it did little to reveal anything but a glint in a far corner did catch my attention. I went over to investigate and found an old rusty pipe jutting out from the wall and bending straight up into the ceiling, on the horizontal axis dangled a pair of handcuffs. I reached out to touch them and in the dim light, I could see that the inner rim had rusted pretty badly.

I moved my light up to face the wall in front of it and could see someone had taped photographs. I scanned through them, the first one was that of a naked pair of middle-aged women, their faces had been scratched out so they were unidentifiable. Their body language read as relaxed, but the unfurnished room they were in and the bare mattress made me feel uneasy.

The second picture was that of a young boy, no older than 13 posed suggestively on that same mattress. He was smiling but his eyes were unmistakably afraid, I let out a breath I didn’t even realize I had been holding and moved on. At this point, I was nervously picking at the handcuffs as I saw the third picture. A teenage girl sitting outside a restaurant patio enjoying a milkshake and smiling at the camera. There was nothing in her expression that gave away that she was in danger and I got the feeling that someone walked up and asked if they could take her picture and in her naivety, she acquiesced.

My fidgeting with the handcuffs had caused some of the rust to flake off and I took my gaze from the pictures and done flakes. I crushed and powdered it, a memory of a broken nose and having to clean up the mess a day later brought me to the realization that it wasn’t rust, but dried blood. I dropped the handcuffs and shone the light around until they landed on a plain, stained, and decrepit mattress. The strange smell identified itself to me at that moment, a smell teenage boys should be familiar with. Old semen.

I tried to bring myself down from a rising panic attack when another glint caught my eye and I shuffled towards it,  another room, much smaller. It was littered with photographs and negatives and every time my light landed on one of them I flinched away. I didn’t see any details but I knew the essence of what they depicted, the colors of violence could not be glossed over, I knew, I knew. I stepped away from this development room and back into the larger chamber and kept my gaze from the wall with handcuffs. There were a dozen more photos and though I didn’t want to look anymore, I forced myself.

One grainy picture showed a small white lap dog nailed to a board, crucified in broad daylight. I couldn’t tell if it was dead or still alive at the time. One picture was of a field, what looked like a filthy naked person was crawling away from the camera. My eyes darted from picture to picture only taking it in for a second until I saw my face. I was frozen, a picture gorilla style taken at my school as students were leaving. I wasn’t the focal point, no one was but I was there, off to the side gazing off into the distance.

I wracked my brain, trying to remember anything but I dredged up nothing but an open floodgate of questions. Did I recognize any of these people, the ones that ended up here, me amongst them? Had I heard anything about an abnormal rate of disappearances?  There was a runaway last year, it was presumed she eloped. Could her face be amongst these pictures, did she end up here, and if she did what then? I decided that I should at least pluck one, to show to the police or something, to have evidence that something awful was happening in the storm drains of Shady Oaks. I chose the one of my face, on some level fearing that my appearance amongst the wall marked me.

I let out an exhale that was almost immediately sucked back in as a distant sound froze me. Straining my ears the unmistakable sound of gently clicking chains and footsteps echoed through the tunnel. I sprinted out of the room and into the main tunnel and kept going, not caring if it saw me or not. It sounded distant but there must have been some trick of acoustics because I swear in a moment the rattling of metal and booming footsteps was at my heels. I kept running, water splashed and my light flung wildly and I could feel a phantom hand reaching for the nape of my neck but in the distance the faint glow of moonlight kept me running.

I broke from the tunnel and into the open night and still I ran. Whatever was chasing me stayed behind in the tunnel and yet I kept running as if the phantom hand was still at my nape. But whatever horrors I had witnessed that day stayed in the tunnels of Shady Oaks.

I got home eventually, at around 10, My mother was already in bed. As my heartbeat calmed I unfurled the photograph in my hand, now badly crumpled. I tossed it into the trash and in the morning after 7 sleepless hours I fished it back out. I did eventually throw it away, a week later but I never talked about what I found in that sewer. As if only I could forget what was down there it would cease to exist. But I never stopped looking over my shoulder, not until I graduated Mom passed and I moved away to a bigger city, that’s when I forgot.

Years passed and I moved back with a family and a nostalgia that did its best to suppress what lurks beneath the surface. It worked for a year until yesterday my daughter came home eager to show me something. A polaroid, one of her smiling at the cameraman.

“Who took this?” I asked, worried at first

“Some old guy, I saw him taking pictures of the passing students as we left. I asked if he could take one of me and he did.”

My stomach dropped and everything came rushing back to me. I took the photo from her and told her not to go outside until we handled things. There was no way to be certain but I had a gut feeling, looking at that photo it was remarkably similar to the one of that naive smiling girl and then I realized. This had happened before. We went to the police with the photo and this account, it’s under investigation with no real leads, yet. I haven’t let her leave the house since, but we can’t shake the feeling of having to always look over my shoulder. There’s someone out there, that prowls the streets, looking for his next victim. I don’t know if he’ll ever be found but I do know one thing, I’m getting us the fuck out of this [town.](https://www.reddit.com/r/grimoireofmadness/)
