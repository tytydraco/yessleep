That night was the first time I faced it. My wife was at work, and my son was asleep in his room. I woke up around two in the morning to use the bathroom and headed out into the hallway.

"Dammit!" the words escaped me involuntarily when I saw a child’s silhouette standing in the dark corridor. It was my six-year-old son, Danil. He was standing perfectly still, swaying ever so slightly.

"Danil, what are you doing out here?" I asked. Silence was my only answer. I walked right up to him and looked closely at his face. His eyes were wide open, staring fixedly at a single point in the dark.

Sleepwalking, I realized. It had happened about a year ago, though I hadn't seen it with my own eyes back then; I had simply found him asleep at the kitchen table. Now, here he was.

I gently took him by the shoulders and guided him toward his bed. You aren't supposed to wake someone abruptly when they’re in that state.

"Under the bed," he mumbled slurredly, still deep in his trance.

"You’re going to sleep on the bed, Danil. Not under it," I said softly, knowing he couldn't really hear me.

"There’s someone under the bed," he muttered. A moment later, I heard a faint rustling coming from my own bedroom.

A coincidence. Just a coincidence, I told myself, trying to suppress the flicker of fear rising in my chest. I tucked Danil into his bed and listened. The rustling had stopped.

I crept back into my room, saw nothing, and strained my ears. Total silence. I switched on the light and checked under the bed, then scanned the rest of the room. Finding nothing, I dismissed it as my imagination and went back to sleep.

Despite the oddity of it all, sleep came quickly. But after some time, a strange noise nearby jolted me awake. Through the fog of half-sleep, I heard my son’s voice:

"Dad, look over here!"

I snapped awake and opened my eyes. The wardrobe was wide open, and clothes were strewn across the entire room. Rubbing my eyes, I tried to make sense of the mess. Danil must have been sleepwalking again and trashed the place, I thought.

"Dad," his voice called from the hallway, followed by a giggle.

I sat up and saw Danil’s silhouette in the dark doorway. Suddenly, he bolted toward the kitchen, laughing loudly.

Is he doing this in his sleep?

A heavy sense of dread settled in my chest as I went after him. My fingers found the switch, and the kitchen flooded with light. It was empty.

I stood there, scratching my head in confusion. While my mind raced to figure out where he could have gone, a laugh rang out from above.

There, on the ceiling directly above me, was my son. He was smiling down at me playfully.

"You found me," he said.

Paralyzed with terror, I watched him grin at me. A couple of seconds later, his voice shifted into a tone of joyful excitement:

"Now it’s your turn to hide. I’ll count to ten and come looking for you."

A gleam of maniacal madness flared in his wide eyes. Breathless with anticipation, he hissed:

"But I will find you."

I bolted. I ran to Danil’s room as fast as my legs would carry me. I don’t even know why I chose that room. I slammed the door shut and only then looked at the bed. There, snoring softly, was my son. Fast asleep.

Utterly bewildered, I sat on the edge of the bed, my mind racing. Soon, a loud, triumphant shout echoed from the kitchen, followed by laughter:

"Ready or not, here I come!"

Then came the footsteps. They approached the room with unimaginable speed. A second later, they stopped just outside the door. I heard a playful little chuckle.

Consumed by terror, I instinctively began to crawl back across the bed, which disturbed the sleeping Danil. The moment he began to wake, the laughter in the hallway cut off, followed by the heavy thud of a body hitting the floor.

"Dad, I had a scary dream," my son said, clutching my arm with trembling hands.

"What... what kind of dream?" I was just as terrified as he was, but I tried to stay calm for his sake.

"I dreamed that he was chasing you!" Danil said in horror.

"Who is 'he'?" I asked, completely lost.

"The One Who Pretends to Be Human!" Tears welled in my son’s eyes. "I dreamed he played hide-and-seek with you, and you couldn't find him. But then you found him on the kitchen ceiling, and then it was his turn to look for you. And you got scared and ran in here."

"That..." I struggled to push past my own fear. "That was just a dream."

"The One Who Pretends to Be Human wanted to hurt you!" Danil sobbed. "Remember I told you I dreamed once that he played with our neighbor?"

It was damn near impossible to stop my hands from shaking. I remembered that a month ago, our neighbor had been found dead in his apartment. The official report said he had slipped and had a "unfortunate fall"... unfortunate enough to be his last.

"Don't worry," I told my son, lying down beside him. "It’s just a bad dream. Do you want me to sleep here with you tonight?"

"Yes," he wiped his tears and clung to me tightly.

I’m just as scared as you are, Danil, I thought. Because I just lived through everything you described...

Back then, I didn't fully understand what it all meant. But later, I formed a mad hypothesis that, unfortunately, turned out to be true.

The moment I had accidentally woken Danil that night, the creature behind the door had expired, collapsed, and vanished. In the morning, I found nothing but the clothes scattered across my bedroom.

It didn't happen often, but every time was a nightmare. For some unknown reason, only my son's most terrifying dreams became part of our reality. And while the monsters disappeared the moment he woke up, the consequences they left behind remained. We called these entities the Nightmares.

The Nightmares varied. Some were relatively harmless things that did nothing but scare you; others were dangerous, aggressive predators with immense strength and speed.

The One Who Pretends to Be Human, the one I met that first night, is one of the worst. You don’t realize right away that you aren't talking to your son or your wife, but to a monster. It’s haunting, especially when you realize the thing could easily tear you to shreds if it felt like it.

After a visit from a Nightmare, we often have to buy new furniture or clothes and do a deep clean of the apartment.

We’ve had to completely replace the wiring twice because of The One Who Comes from the Ashes. When he appears, every lightbulb in the room explodes, and the electrical lines burn out completely. Everything he touches turns to char and ash. His flaming eyes greedily scan the room, looking for the easiest things to set ablaze.

Sometimes, your first impression of a Nightmare can be wrong. Once, I found marks on the wallpaper: palm prints and the outline of a face, as if someone had leaned against the wall from the inside. Danil said it was The One Who Hides in the Walls inspecting the room. Thinking the creature only watched us from the safety of the plaster, I assumed it wasn't a threat.

I changed my mind when, one night, a hand shot out of the wall and grabbed my forearm. It had a death grip that tightened with every passing second until I heard a snap and felt agonizing pain. My screams woke Danil, and all that remained of the monster was a bulging, torn piece of wallpaper.

People probably think that in situations like this, the military or scientists show up and whisk the "subject" away for experiments. But in reality, nobody cared. Most people took it as the ramblings of a madman... even despite the massive electromagnetic pulses, the burnt wiring, and the literal warping of the walls.

We tried to do something about it, but nothing worked. When I asked Danil where he got the names for these things, he said he just knew what to call them the moment he saw them in his dreams.

The Nightmares grew worse each time, and one day, the unthinkable happened.

I came home late from work after a brutal shift. My wife wasn't home, and my son was sitting in his room, cowering under his blanket.

"Hey, Danil," I said, putting a hand on his shoulder. "What’s wrong?"

"He came," my son replied through tears.

"Who?" I gently pulled the blanket away. Danil looked at me, sobbing.

"He hurt Mommy."

"What?" Fear and grief hit me instantly. "Where is she? What happened?"

"She’ll be here soon."

"Whew," I felt a wave of relief. "Well, who was it that came by?" I asked more loudly.

"Shh!" Danil waved his hands frantically. "They’ll hear us."

"Who will hear us?" I didn't understand. They all disappear when he wakes up, so what’s the problem?

"Honey, I’m home," a familiar voice called from the hallway. I stood up to go to her, but Danil grabbed my hand with terrifying strength and whispered:

"Don't go out there! We have to hide!"

"Why? You still haven't told me who came or what happened to Mom."

"The one who came was..." Danil trailed off as footsteps sounded near the door. They sounded like someone who was just learning how to walk. Someone was approaching with clumsy, heavy thuds, scuffing their feet across the carpet.

"The One Who Resurrects the Dead," Danil finished.

He screamed as the door was kicked open with violent force, and my wife's corpse appeared in the doorway.

I felt a cold, decaying hand wrap around my throat, and the world went black.

I jolted upright, gasping for air so hard my chest burned. My heart was a frantic drum against my ribs, and my skin was slick with a cold, sickly sweat. For a long moment, I just sat there in the dark, clutching the duvet, waiting for the clumsy footsteps to echo in the hallway or the maniacal laughter to ring out from the kitchen.

But there was only silence. The soft, rhythmic sound of breathing came from beside me. I turned my head, my eyes stinging with tears of pure, unfiltered relief. My wife was there, fast asleep, her face peaceful in the pale moonlight filtering through the curtains. She wasn't a cold husk; she was warm, alive, and safe.

I stumbled out of bed, my legs feeling like lead, and crept toward Danil’s room. I stood in the doorway, my breath catching in my throat until I saw him. He was sprawled across his bed, snoring softly, one arm hanging off the side. There was no monster on the ceiling. No shadows moved in the corner of the room.

I sank onto the floor in the hallway and buried my face in my hands, waiting for the trembling to stop. It was just a dream. A vivid, cruel trick of a mind exhausted by overtime shifts and the deep-seated anxieties of fatherhood. I stayed there for a long time, letting the normalcy of the quiet house wash over me.

Finally, I stood up to head back to bed. But as I turned, my foot brushed against something on the carpet. I looked down, my heart skipping a beat.

Right there, in the middle of the hallway, sat a single, small piece of charred wallpaper. I reached down to touch it, but as my fingers brushed the ash, I stopped.

From inside Danil's room, I heard him mutter a single sentence in his sleep:
"He’s counting to ten now, Dad."
