Everyone, I'm begging you to talk to your kids about this new airdropping prank. And to the so-called parents whose daughter has been recording them, shame on her and shame on YOU. Someone could get really hurt here, and I just pray to god it's not going to be my own boy.

Because my son's phone is full up of these files. I just counted - there must be twenty, maybe twenty five of them? They're from different days, and I guess from different phones. He told me his friends have been getting them too. He told me the kids at \[HIGHSCHOOL'S NAME REDACTED\] are trading them around like some kind of pokemons. My son said they just show up on people's phones, airdropped in, after they've been out in the woods. I've just listened to all of them, and I think it's always the same girl making them. She's always got the same sound she plays in the background, like she's in a cave and there's water dripping. It makes me feel cold listening to it, somehow. It's really creepy with the breathy, teary voice she's doing.

She never actually cries, she just begs and begs for someone to come help her. Says she's trapped, talks about her 'captor', and then gives these nonsense directions to where she's 'being held'.

Teenagers aren't going to know that that's bullshit. My son definitely didn't want to hear it. I caught him trying to leave the house two nights ago with a backpack full of junk. He wouldn't tell me what it was all for, and I was starting to get pretty freaked out - I understood the lighter, but what does a kid sneaking off to a party need rope for, or my hairspray, or an old butterknife, or an entire box of salt? He wouldn't talk to me until I was about to pour out a little jar of water he'd wrapped up in a sweatshirt and shoved to the bottom of the bag.

That was when it all came out. The girl, trapped in the woods (by someone who...let her have a phone and enough power to charge it, I guess?). The "tainted deer". The "hidden path" that you could only see at certain phases of the moon. Just, you know. Utter, obvious bullshit.

But do you know how hard it is to convince a fifteen year old who thinks he's going to be a hero that his captured princess is actually just some little attention whore getting off on seeing how far she can push him? I spent literally hours trying to get him to understand that the best case scenario was him ending up in some viral video as the idiot who fell for a stupid prank.

I thought I'd gotten through to him. I really did.

He left his phone playing videos, so that when I looked into his room last night, it looked as if he was just under the covers, watching stuff. I never would have thought he'd actually leave his phone behind, so I didn't look closer until this morning.

I'm writing this now because I can't sleep. With the snowstorm that's set in, the cops say we can't keep searching until morning. I just keep listening to these recordings and hoping my son isn't out in all this.

Talk to your own child before it's too late. I hope it's not too late for mine.

Update: One or two of you asked me to update you on the situation with my son, Joshua, so I'm going to try to do that now as I wait for the storm to let up a little. The cell phone coverage out here is weird, though, and I'm not convinced this will even upload. I guess we'll see.

I said before how the police called off the search for the night a little after dark. They told me to wait for them, said they'd come back in the morning with more dogs and a bigger search party, but only once the storm that's rolled in had settled down a little.

All of the websites said that the first 24 hours after someone goes missing are the most important, though. I don't know why I even agreed to come back to the house, except that I was hoping against hope that maybe he had come home by himself, and that I could wrap him up in a blanket and then scream at him...basically until he went off to college?

But I was stuck. The volunteer search and rescue people had brought dogs, and the dogs were following his scent pretty well for a while, but it was like they lost it when we got deeper into the forest. Their lazy golden retriever sat down in a clearing and wagged its stupid tail while the German Shepherd ran up and down the path for what felt like half an hour before it gave up and started whining. That was when they suggested we go home to get a new, smellier shirt or something, and to make sure the dogs were ok. I probably shouldn't have shouted at everyone then, but the temperature had started dropping and I was scared.

They were pretty insistent on bringing me back, and they said I should try to get some sleep. I sat around for a few hours in the dark, listening to all those creepy recordings my son had on his phone. And I started thinking. When I caught him sneaking out, Josh kept going on about the "hidden path" that you could only see at night. I figured, maybe that was important, you know? Like, aren't there mushrooms or lichens that glow in the dark? Maybe he saw some of those and wandered off the main path. The storm was still more sleet than snow, at that point, but if it started to pile up, maybe I wouldn't be able to see anything.

And look, I know, the cops said to wait until it was light again, but it's not their kid out there.

We still have some of the gear from the camping trips we used to take when Josh was little and my husband was alive. Josh had taken the pack he uses with his scout troop, but he hadn't taken the pup tent or his sleeping bag, because why would he do that when he needed the space for crucial things like blunt silverware?

Anyway, I took my husband's old frame, which it turns out is too big for me. I can feel how sore my hips are from where it's been rubbing, but I didn't notice until just now, and it's not going to slow me down. I probably could have lifted a car off of my baby, if that had been an option. 

Instead, I found his "hidden" path.

I can't believe I didn't notice it before. There's no glowing mushrooms, and it doesn't need them because there's nothing even vaguely "hidden" about it. It's just a normal path, right in the clearing near where that fat dog was lolling around drooling on itself. Maybe all the wind blew the leaves off the trail a little? I wasn't sure whether to cry with relief or to bang my head against one of the trees because I'd been hanging around, not thirty feet away from the trailhead, while Josh was heading further out into the woods.

I did cry when I found his boot prints just now.

The trail is pretty well established, but with all the sleet, the mud is getting bad. The downpour got stronger a few minutes ago, and I ducked under a little overhang to get out of the wet. I wedged myself in backward so that I could rest my pack against the overhang's roof while I struggled with the map on my phone. I was trying to get the GPS location to resolve, but when I settled back and used my headlamp to look for a way to brace my feet against the rock in front of me, I saw a familiar, muddy pattern stamped on the dry side of it. A pattern I'd seen trailing across the floors of our foyer and garage and kitchen, more often than you'd think a fifteen year old would need to be reminded. There've been tears about those tracks before, but not historically of joy.

I tried to call everyone, anyone, but the signal out here is so weird and variable that it still can't even give me the coordinates for my location. I've tried texting, but I'm not sure it's going through. 

The storm is slacking off a little, though, and I need to keep moving. I'll try to keep calling as I go. I'm sure I'll find cell coverage soon, though - Josh's phone just made that little sound that I think means someone has sent him something.

Update 2: To the young woman who somehow knows Josh's name and had the GALL to send another one of her little recordings to my son's phone, you'd better hope the police find you before I do. My husband died six years ago and if anything has happened to Josh, I have nothing left to lose. I didn't listen to the rest of the message, but I know you're out here, because I know now that the phones use Bluetooth to airdrop stuff, so you can't be far away.

Plus, I can see you, or maybe some of your little friends, dancing around out among the trees. I want you all to know, whoever you are, that you guys are sick. What kind of monsters read about someone's lowest imaginable moment and decide, "hey, I know! Why don't my friends and I make this worse?" 

Just, the sheer amount of effort it has to have taken to hike fast enough to catch up with me, overtake me, and then screw around in the distance - like, is this really worth it to you? 

And did you coordinate the weird sound you're all making with each other ahead of time? I've been hearing it for like an hour now, so if you guys seriously have the energy and skills to follow me like this, why don't you HELP ME FIND MY SON rather than popping your heads out from behind trees and then ducking back again before I can see you?

Stop messing around and HELP ME FIND JOSH.

Update 3: Ok, since a bunch of shitty teenagers are clearly able to see my updates, this must be uploading after all, so WHERE is the search and rescue team? The sky is still all dark and overcast, and my phone is messing around (the clock's stuck or something, I don't know) but it's got to be noon by now, and I'm not exactly the peak of fitness. Why are they taking so long? Did they not even show up this morning? It's not like they could have lost the path, I could follow it even when the storm was bad. Plus, the stupid dogs should have an even clearer scent to follow now.

And the horrible kids found me, after all, just from my description. Whoever they are, they're still being little shits, they've started to throw rocks at me when they pop out. If I don't post for a while, I guess assume that one of them got me in the head and tell the \[TOWN NAME REDACTED\] Police Department what happened. Maybe they think they can't get in real trouble for a prank, but they definitely can see the inside of a jail cell for assault.

===

Update 4: I've been calling them kids, but I want to state for the record that they're big - definitely teenagers, although I can't recognize any of them because they're wearing some kind of...I don't know, full body gorilla suits? Like from a costume shop. What the hell. If any local parents in \[TOWN NAME REDACTED\] can check to see if their kids have bought something like that online, please ground the hell out of them once they get home.

They should be on their way there. I screamed at them again, and I guess their consciences finally got the better of them because they've stopped grunting and hitting logs with sticks or whatever they were doing. I wish they'd help me, but if not, I guess them shutting up so I can hear is better than nothing.

Update 5: WHERE ARE THE SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAM, WHAT AM I EVEN PAYING TAXES FOR

<NOTE: Voice-To-Text activated>

Oh my God they killed a deer and SKINNED it and HUNG IT UP what the hell what the hell what the HELL

.............

I'm safe here, I think, but this isn't normal teenage crap.

I said these kids were sick and I didn't know how sick, I don't know why they killed the deer but there are a bunch of bodies, not just one, they killed the deer and strung the bodies up, with ropes, and they're rotting, just whole deer with their skeletons starting to show, hanging between the trees, and not just one, lots of them, at least ten, and they're big, too, I mean the deer are big? So it--it can't have been just one of them, so it's not just--

Oh shit, oh shit there's something out there now, I've gotta--
