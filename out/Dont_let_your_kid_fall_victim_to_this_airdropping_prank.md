Everyone, I'm begging you to talk to your kids about this new airdropping prank. And to the so-called parents whose daughter has been recording them, shame on her and shame on YOU. Someone could get really hurt here, and I just pray to god it's not going to be my own boy.



Because my son's phone is full up of these files. I just counted - there must be twenty, maybe twenty five of them? They're from different days, and I guess from different phones. He told me his friends have been getting them too. He told me the kids at \[HIGHSCHOOL'S NAME REDACTED\] are trading them around like some kind of pokemons. My son said they just show up on people's phones, airdropped in, after they've been out in the woods. I've just listened to all of them, and I think it's always the same girl making them. She's always got the same sound she plays in the background, like she's in a cave and there's water dripping. It makes me feel cold listening to it, somehow. It's really creepy with the breathy, teary voice she's doing.



She never actually cries, she just begs and begs for someone to come help her. Says she's trapped, talks about her 'captor', and then gives these nonsense directions to where she's 'being held'.



Teenagers aren't going to know that that's bullshit. My son definitely didn't want to hear it. I caught him trying to leave the house two nights ago with a backpack full of junk. He wouldn't tell me what it was all for, and I was starting to get pretty freaked out - I understood the lighter, but what does a kid sneaking off to a party need rope for, or my hairspray, or an old butterknife, or an entire box of salt? He wouldn't talk to me until I was about to pour out a little jar of water he'd wrapped up in a sweatshirt and shoved to the bottom of the bag.



That was when it all came out. The girl, trapped in the woods (by someone who...let her have a phone and enough power to charge it, I guess?). The "tainted deer". The "hidden path" that you could only see at certain phases of the moon. Just, you know. Utter, obvious bullshit.



But do you know how hard it is to convince a fifteen year old who thinks he's going to be a hero that his captured princess is actually just some little attention whore getting off on seeing how far she can push him? I spent literally hours trying to get him to understand that the best case scenario was him ending up in some viral video as the idiot who fell for a stupid prank.



I thought I'd gotten through to him. I really did.



He left his phone playing videos, so that when I looked into his room last night, it looked as if he was just under the covers, watching stuff. I never would have thought he'd actually leave his phone behind, so I didn't look closer until this morning.



I'm writing this now because I can't sleep. With the snowstorm that's set in, the cops say we can't keep searching until morning. I just keep listening to these recordings and hoping my son isn't out in all this.



Talk to your own child before it's too late. I hope it's not too late for mine.
