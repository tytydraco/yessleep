It starts with me and six others waking up in total darkness, my body aching and my head throbbing. I’m sure the others in the elevator feel the same as I grab at the wall and pull myself to my feet. 

My first instinct was to pull my smartphone out. Thankfully it’s still intact, with only a few minor scrapes and cracks but I have no signal at all at the moment,  nor nearby networks to connect to, a reliance on technology that makes me feel queasy. I use the flash light to get a good look at the people around me. All of them are vaguely familiar from a few seconds ago, when we were in the world above… but just seeing their faces doesn’t make me feel any safer. Each of us is scared, confused and a little jarred from our experience. None of us are sure what has happened. 

Here’s what I have managed to gather as far as I can remember it: 

I was on my way to a job interview. 

The ironic thing is that I didn’t even know what it was for. I’d signed up a few weeks back for those automated alerts sent out by temp agencies and got one from the hiring firm on the sixth floor of this building. I never made it past floor four. 

“Is everyone okay?” a businesswoman in a pantsuit asks as she uses her own phone to check all of us for injuries. 

That’s when we notice the young girl crouched in the corner of the elevator. Before she was just a blurred stranger amid the others, but now I can see that she is curled up in a ball and doing her best to not panic. Of all the people here, she is the one that doesn’t seem like she belongs at all. 

I’m not going to sit here and pretend that I have perfect facial recollection of every person I meet. But this place is a multi corporate building, not a residential high rise. There is no reason for a child to be here.  

These are the sort of thoughts that rattle through my brain as I struggle to collect myself. 

“We must have fallen ten stories at least,” a dark skinned maintenance man comments as the businesswoman shines her phone to the roof above. I can only guess that’s his job based on his trousers and overalls and the tool box at his side. The ceiling is about ten to twelve feet over our head and I’m sure all of us are likely thinking that at some point we will need to construct a human ladder to get out of here. 

“This building has a basement?” a younger man carrying a backpack like he’s been traveling for days asks. He looks like he just got back from the army since he’s still in uniform. Our being here is proof enough to answer his question so none of us bother to acknowledge it. 

The businesswoman is doing what anyone I think would naturally do first in this situation. She tries to press all the buttons to the elevator. It’s a wasted exercise, but it makes sense in our panic to rule out the obvious first. 

The next stranger, a woman who seems unable to speak, motions with her hands. I realize she is using American Sign Language but I haven’t a clue what she is saying. 

In a vain hope that she can read lips I say, “I don’t know what happened.” 

I am the one who tries the emergency phone, but it too is dead. Surprisingly my own phone works and for a moment but I don’t seize the opportunity and the signal is gone. I could have acted faster but I feel dizzy. Maybe everything happening so fast just hit me like a train. 

Then I notice for a brief second that I’m connected to a network again and  desperately I make a call to 911. 

The response is only garbled noise and static that almost sounds like a scream. The businesswoman tries her phone but is greeted with similar results.
Then the network is gone and we are out of range. Our window of opportunity gone. 

It’s a little disheartening but none of us want to start acting like this is a problem yet. I can sense the tension in the air especially as we hear the little girl’s heightened breathing in the corner. It could be so easy for all of us to fall into the same panic. And then I wonder if we should maybe comfort her? Is she here alone? I feel awkward not knowing what to do and I get the same feeling from everyone else. 

“We’re probably too far down for regular cell service. Can you attach to any WiFi network at all?” the maintenance man asks. 

At the moment I can’t and I decide to save my phone battery and try again later. 

UPDATE 

Later,  the other person of the group, a young woman who looks like she might work as a nurse because she is wearing scrubs, asks the maintenance man if he has anything to attempt to pry the door to the elevator open. 

It sounds like the best way out of here, so none of us object as he searches through his tool bag to find anything that might unhinge the door. 

Myself and the businesswoman, who I soon learn is named Chloé; position ourselves on either side of him to shine our phone lights at the door crack and give him enough lighting to see what he is doing. 

These modern elevators aren’t the kind where you can just slip your fingers between the folds of metal to pry open and I can see the man is struggling to push them apart with what he has. But it’s also another wasted effort. Once it does budge a little we notice that there is only concrete on the other side. We’ve gone too far down. Even the deaf lady knows what he is saying when he cusses and kicks the door. 

“Shit.” 

It feels like that is the understatement of our entire situation, and  I’m starting to feel a sense of hopelessness at this point. The young soldier next suggests the human ladder that had popped into my brain earlier. All other avenues of escape have been exhausted after all. 

“We might be able to get a signal from the WiFi in the lobby,” he adds. 

I join him as the stabilizing force at the bottom of the ladder and the maintenance man takes the center as the nurse struggles to crawl up on his shoulders, but can’t quite reach the emergency exit. The deaf lady is shaking, clearly scared of heights and refusing to cooperate but somehow we get her to do it. 

“I don’t think I can climb that high either,” Chloé admits. We look toward the girl who is still curled up in a ball, but it’s highly unlikely that she will help us. She finally pushes to make it up the shaky human ladder to try the exit but it is lodged shut. 

“I can’t even make it budge,” she admits as she quickly climbed down and we dismantle the attempted escape.
My muscles were quickly tired out from the attempt and I gave a loud exhausted sigh of frustration. It’s none of their fault but I know the tension between all of us is rising. 

The maintenance man makes the simplest choice given our circumstances. “The fire department has probably already been called after the elevator dropped,” he told us. “We should just wait for rescue.” 

He is telling us this as a means of reassurance, I know; and his logic doesn’t seem flawed yet. As far as the rest of us can tell, although we did fall seemingly ten stories into a hidden sub basement, nothing else bad has happened. It’s the only hope we can hold onto for the moment. 

I slide down to my knees and pull out my phone again, trying to send a text or something to anyone above. Nothing goes through at the moment so I begin to take notes of our situation. 

The nurse decides to make small talk. 

“What’s your battery on?” 

“Eighty six percent. Which judging by my luck probably means I’ve got a good hour of life in it,” I offered to her with a half smile. Inwardly I’m worried because her question poses another genuine concern. We are all starting to wonder how long we will be down here. Even if it is a few hours eventually necessities like food, water and even toiletries will be needed. But I push all of that concern aside to ask her the same question in turn. 

“Didn’t bring it… I’m on my lunch break… came here to see my boyfriend,” she admits and tells me her name. 

“I’m Sidney by the way.” 

“Eli,” I reply. 

Over the next hour I make a note to listen to the small talk amid our group and gather details about who they are. It makes me realize were it not for our current circumstances I wouldn’t know these people at all. I’m going to use the time I have now while I wait for another network to potentially pop up to describe each of them and their plight as we wait here in misery. My hope is to make it clear this isn’t just my personal account of our terror, but the growing concern I have for the strangers I am down here with. 

There is Chloé, the hard working businesswoman that is a programmer for one of the companies on the seventh floor. She is worried about her two kids, checking her Instagram and Facebook feed constantly to try for a signal. At one point she even asked to try my own phone but still had little luck. 

“We were supposed to go to a museum today after work, it was a surprise for my youngest. She is fascinated with dinosaurs,” Chloé tells me. 

I know that her distracted tone means she is wondering who will even pick up her kids from wherever they are now that she is trapped in a subterranean hell. But she is just trying to keep herself distracted at least. Hoping that Phil is right about the fire department coming. 

Phil is the maintenance man, and he seems the calmest of the group.

I think that because he is the oldest and been around this building the longest we all look to him as a natural leader. Still, he has made it clear he knows nothing about the basement that we are in. 
“I’ve seen some of the pipes and shit in this place, it’s nasty and gritty. But the elevator shaft doesn’t go down this far. I get the feelin’ when we dropped, we caused some kind of rupture in the flooring and that’s why we are so far down.” 

To be fair though, none of us are really sure how far down we are. It’s this strange collective sense of wrongness about being stuck here in the dark at the bottom of a hole that is starting to scratch that desperate itch to escape. 

Also, none of us have great memories of the drop, that’s something else I have picked up on. 

Perhaps our brains were all focused on our own personal lives, where we were headed next. Not concerned with whatever fate was about to throw at us. Or the trauma of the fall has caused our bodies to cover those memories.

The deaf woman has written her name in a journal she keeps. Amanda. Age 23. Apparently she works as a translator. This makes me feel a little more comfortable to know at least she isn’t completely in the dark. But her other scribbled question has me worried. 

*What is in the backpack?*

I give a glance to the young soldier whose eyes are darting around the room constantly. 
“I don’t think we want to know,” I admitted and then erased what I wrote before anyone else could read it. 

I shouldn’t be feeding any tension.   I’m in shock and this situation isn’t getting any better. All of us are experiencing post traumatic stress. 

That seems to be what has happened to the girl in the corner. Chloé made an attempt to talk to her, only causing the poor girl to wail. I worry for her the most. How she got here and how to keep her safe seem to be unknowns at this point, but all of us feel certain that if we can’t calm her down things will get a lot worse. 

Especially if my guess about the other stranger is right. The fidgety young army private, who hasn’t really bothered to talk to anyone since we all woke from the fall. He keeps checking his  watch, tapping his right foot in the tiny elevator we are all trapped in and clutching his backpack. If he was trying to hide whatever secret he was carrying, it wasn’t working. Everything he was doing gave me anxiety and therefore he is the one that makes me concerned about our safety. 

Is he going to snap? Is he wondering if any of us can be trusted? Is *he* able to be trusted?  I’ve seen paranoia like his spread quickly in larger crowds. Trapped here in the dark with no idea if we are being rescued, it made me feel sick to my stomach to imagine what he might be capable of. 

Right past the second hour mark, he’s the one who voices his paranoia, almost predictably. 

“No one is going to find us here,” he says. 

“I’ve managed to send out a few texts, but nothing is coming back on my end. We might only have a signal strong enough to send an SOS, when that network comes back on I could get to my Reddit account,” Chloé tells us. I decide to use that to document these notes via uploads and she offers me her password. I plan to upload this when I have signal as a distress call. “Maybe someone out there on the big World Wide Web will help…” 

Phil keeps reiterating the need to keep calm, but the paranoia soldier isn’t hearing him. He is sure something has caused all of this. 

“Aren’t any of you a bit concerned that we all have a jumbled memory of the fall? Doesn’t that bother any of you?” he snarled. 

“You’re thinking it wasn’t an accident,” Sidney said. 

“It’s the only explanation that makes sense. That’s why rescue isn’t coming. Because this is some sick social experiment,” he said, trying to sound like he had just made some profound revelation. 

All of us are too nervous to even argue him. I know that trying to break someone of their paranoia is an uphill battle, and usually most of us don’t worry about doing so. Our circumstances shouldn’t  allow tension to become worse, so we remain silent. 

But he still isn’t happy with that, convinced our quiet means that we are complying with whatever dark forces he believes are oppressing us. 

“Just look at this kid. She’s been in a near panicked state since we got here. Heck, I don’t even think she was here before,” he said. 
His words are now sounding like a conspiracy. It’s making the rest of us nervous and scared all over again. 

“Just sit back and wait, pal. Help is on the way,” Phil said. Then Phil made the biggest mistake of his life, placing his hand on the young man’s shoulder for a sign of respect and reassurance. 

He reacts with anger I could see coming a mile away and pushes Phil back. 

“Don’t touch me, old man. For all we know, you could have sabotaged the elevator,” he snarls. 

His sudden outburst causes the maintenance man to stumble backwards and slam into the wall. 

Then all of us heard this guttural shrieking noise from beyond our metallic prison. Amanda reacts to our own facial expressions and stands up, trying to figure out what is going on. 

Frozen in place as it reverberates through the walls of the elevator, we all can’t help but to look at each other in the darkness that our eyes have somewhat adjusted to. It doesn’t sound like any living thing I have ever heard before. 

Then at last the noise dies down and the shaking stops and we are in silence and dread again. 

“What the hell was that?” Sidney asked, barely forming the words. 

The young girl is showing her face for the first time, looking toward us with fear and worry. Then she speaks words that I will never forget. 

 “It’s awake.”
