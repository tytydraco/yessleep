In psychology, there is a phenomenon in which an individual associates food with a negative experience, only to later develop an intolerance for that food when eating it. This is known as the Garcia Effect, and is a fairly common occurrence in which our brains associate traumatic experiences with a physical stimulation from food, even if the food had nothing to do with the experience itself. For example, a healthy adult man could eat a treat he’s loved his entire life, like popcorn, but if he were to violently throw up from having the flu, he may never be able to enjoy the treat again due to his association with the negative event.

Though I’ve heard examples of this, I’d never believe to find myself in a similar predicament for hotdogs. Everybody loves hotdogs. Whether you associate the pleasantry with your grandpa who grilled at the cookout, or the mystery goop they served during that one exhilarating trip to New York, hot dogs are a staple to American life. The worst part of all this, is that my traumatic association wasn’t even from a real sausage link: it was a vegan dog. 

I suppose I should give some background. I work in a small firm on the East Coast. I’m from the Midwest, and moved to the city after studying political science to intern as a policy researcher. I stayed at the company in an administrative role, helping manage schedules, run business meetings, manage product tasks, and other draining desk jockey activities. I even started wearing those goofy tech bro sweater vests. Since I moved, I’ve gained a few pounds, but hey that’s life. 

The office is neat, though small–an old town house refurbished into a delicate office space. A large office upstairs for the boss, the main floor furnished with vintage tables and desks for employees wanting to work in a more relaxed environment, and the basement with standard cubicles. Since people have the option to work outside the city or in other states, only a handful of employees ever come in consistently; the boss, my work friend Ian, myself, and our manager Gary. Ian and I often stayed in the basement on account that the Wifi was strongest there.

Across the street from us is the national headquarters of an animal activist group, and as you would expect, they are all vegan. I can’t judge people’s eating habits, but like most people I’ve always been baffled by how you can go consistently throughout your life without eating beef, pork, fish, *anything*, even as a treat. Besides, it’s not like refusing to eat a steak is going to bring the cow back to life. And if we all refuse to eat beef, then what? A bunch of cows roaming everywhere, shitting in our streets, stinking up the place? It’d be a nightmare! After high school, I spent time working on farms, and let me tell you, those creatures reek. To me, the nicest smelling cow still smells like diarrhea and milk were mixed together and left to curdle out in the sun.

That being said, I’ve never found vegan food to be deplorable until recently, and don’t judge vegans for how they live their lives. I just choose not to follow the lifestyle. So it came as a surprise to me when I entered the office and found a massive tray left on our breakroom table, with informational flyers laid across from our vegan neighbors. Beneath them was a small, friendly note which read:

*Bought to many for an event, enjoy it for yourselves!*

*From,*

*Your animal loving friends*

I rolled my eyes at the note, but the size of the tin tray caught my attention. What kind of food could be in it? I've read about crazy concoctions that vegans have made, or that mass produced vegan foods are worse for you than regular meat due to the amount of processing and preservatives added for maintaining shape. To be honest, I thought it would’ve been pretty great to have a giant tray full of tofu, like some kind of soy-based sheet cake. 

I wasn’t particularly hungry at that time, so I decided just to leave it there for whoever else wanted it. It wasn’t until the end of the week that my boss recommended I give it a try.

“Take a few back home with you! Plenty for everybody–I ate one earlier today and thought it was pretty good. Kind of strange, though.” 

I trusted my boss' taste in the past, and if he enjoyed them, then maybe so would I. When I opened the tray, I found 38 neatly wrapped cylinders–hot dogs! Though I was indifferent to them at first, I figured that if I were to ever try vegan food, now would be as good a time as any. It’s hard to mess up a hot dog, even if it isn’t made out of meat right? This thought occurred to me as I placed my hand on my lower chest, reminding myself of the pounds I’ve gained–maybe this would be good dieting food.

After concluding that I had no reason *not* to try them besides personal preference, I grabbed three wrapped vegan dogs to bring back home to my studio apartment. I made plans with friends to meet them at the bar, so I threw them into my freezer to save for a work-from-home day, or when I was just too lazy to cook anything. 

The vegan dogs were untouched for two weeks in that freezer before I took one out to try. I neglected to try them out until my coworker, Ian, suggested I try them earlier that day.

“Honestly, I was kind of surprised. I figured vegan food was some type of liberal bullshit, but I had two last week and found it pretty good. I may grab another for lunch today. You want one?” 

I declined then since I brought leftovers from the night before, but figured it was time to give it a try that evening. 

If you haven’t eaten a vegan dog before, the best way to describe it is that it is the skinwalker of foods; looks and feels like the real thing, but something about it is uncanny. After thawing out, the link itself looked like this strange block of mysterious segments forced together, as though it were some kind of sedimentary rock. It was difficult to not think it looked like a literal piece of shit given that the entire link was brown, inside and out. It didn’t help to see strange color inconsistencies, like a crimson red and dark green, as though the plants made from it had rendered it a botanical oddity. 

Almost worse than its visual was its texture. I couldn’t help but think back when I was a kid, and my dad and I would cook sausages over a fire we built. Now and then, the tip or sides of the dog would burn rapidly while the inside was cooked to perfection in my mind. Occasionally, I would peel off the burnt edge of the sausage link like an infected scab forming on a body. Now imagine that small burst scab, but that was the entire hot dog. 

I grimaced at the site and felt it, as though it were some foreign object. However, I decided that maybe it would taste better than it looks. So, I suppressed the instinctive urge to throw it out immediately and instead threw it in the microwave to nuke it for 90 seconds. Maybe the excess heat would alter its composition, magically creating an untapped super food that tastes excellent. 

Well, it didn’t. I can’t say that it tasted disgusting, but this is where the uncanniness came into the equation. As the encrusted texture writhed around between my gums on the first bite, there was a moment where it really tasted similar to a hot dog. The flavor was bland, but its juices fill your mouth like fatty bratwurst would. It was the aftertaste that quickly changed my opinion, where I felt as though I could taste each chemical, every preservative and mystery ingredient contaminating my taste buds. Whatever was in my mouth was not *food* to me at that moment, but a synthetic compound of toxins and delusion. I stomached through two full bites before spitting out the third I was chewing. Looking down at the paper towel in my hand, I was horrified to see that the fatty juices I tasted was actually black bile, as though I had chewed hundreds of gnats altogether until they made a putrid, paste-like substance.

In short, it sucked. I would never recommend eating anything like this to anybody. What the hell was Ian thinking, suggesting I try it? Was this some kind of prank, knowing I would hate it? Was my boss in on the gag? I won’t judge people’s lifestyles or eating habits, but making someone eat this—*thing* is just cruel. I hastily threw out the remaining vegan dogs in my freezer, looking down once more to see the darkened pulp slide slowly further down into my trash can.

At the time, I thought I was being irrational. But a question kept gnawing in the back of my mind. How the hell could Ian and my boss stomach this? Social anxiety aside, I knew that they wouldn’t pull a prank this elaborate just to trick me into eating a vegan hotdog. Did I pick a spoiled one? It must have gone bad inside my freezer. But even after a week in the fridge, Ian ate one and recommended it. The whole thing went off.

When I approached my boss’ office, I found it vacant. Like always, all of his papers were stacked neatly at his desk corner, trophies and framed photos stacked neatly on his walls, all surrounded by a spotless floor. The boss was always something of a neat freak. Every time he entered and left the building, he would use hand sanitizer as a precaution before entering the ‘dangerous’ microbiome of the parking garage. He even instructed our cleaning lady to spend an additional 10 minutes each day just to make sure the room stayed in pristine condition. 

I noticed Ian walking by, and asked him if he'd seen our boss recently. “Haven’t you heard?” Ian said, in a raspier voice than usual. “Apparently he is on hiatus for the next week or so. Something about a stomach bug, but I feel like he’s dealing with something more serious.” 

I didn’t notice then, but Ian's a sickly pallor was a warning sign. I ignored it at that moment, disregarding his actions for the potential consequences of showing up to work sick. In any case, I was more concerned about our boss. He was in his seventies, so I wasn’t surprised to hear that he may be having challenges with his health. Afterall, time gets the best of us in the end. But two weeks ago when I last spoke to him, he seemed so healthy. What changed in those two weeks?

After collecting my thoughts, I realized that our last conversation was about that damn vegan hot dog. I chuckled, thinking maybe it rattled his immune system, or gave him a stomach bug. In any case, I hoped he got better soon–I needed him to sign off on a new contract.

As I turned back away from the office, I caught a slight shimmer in the corner of my eye. Underneath the boss’ chair was a strange shape that seemed out of place. A dark irregularly in an otherwise untouched floor. I knelt down, and what I found rekindled the feeling I felt of revulsion. What laid beneath the boss’ chair was a recognizable pile of the otherworldly black paste, similar to what I spat out the night before.

**---**

Is it possible I hallucinated it? I’d been overworked that month, so maybe my job was finally getting the better of me. A plethora of hypotheticals and ‘what ifs’ flooded my mind on my walk home.

It was a Friday, and though my concerns were of the essence then, I was in the mood to go out. Maybe some whiskey or beer would calm my nerves. I texted Ian asking if he’d be up for a happy hour. 

*Sorry man, I have to stay late. Gary has my team working overtime today. That project with Soren is coming up, so I may have to work over the weekend too. I need a raise LOL. I’ll see you next Tuesday when you’re in the office.*

The weekend flew by like most do, but I suppose it's worth mentioning that literally everybody works remotely on Mondays at our office. It’s a pretty sweet deal, all things considered. While designed to boost productivity, the true beauty of remote days is to wake up 30 minutes late for work, go to a cafe halfway through the day, or just play Youtube in the background as you go about your daily grind. 

The only reason why no one ever gets in trouble for playing hooky is because literally *everybody* in the company does it. Some Monday’s, you won’t even get a single email from your boss or colleague simply because no one else can deal with dredging the first day after the weekend. That’s why I’m not surprised that no one heard from or seen Ian since the Friday before.

As I passed by Ian’s parked car to enter the backdoor to the office, I was hit by a wall of something rotten. A stench so thick and moist that it changed the humidity within the air itself, I couldn’t even bring myself to step ten feet into the building before propping the door open hoping it would freshen up the building. It did not. Whatever had found its way into the vents and died left one hell of a corpse behind.

I should have left right then and there. I should have just closed the door and went right back home–it’s not like it would have been the end of the world. I should have let it be someone else’s burden. But like an idiot, my curiosity got the better of me. And besides, if the boss came back, he’d freak out on all of us if no one did anything about the smell. 

I took a fresh undershirt I kept in my backpack and poured water on it. I read that back during the First World War, soldiers would protect themselves from mustard gas by dampening masks to avoid caustic burns to their eyes, lungs, and mouths. I figured that similar precautions were appropriate as I wrapped the wet shirt over the ridge of my nose as I slowly stepped inside. 

Working my way inside, I flipped the switch on the side of the wall closest to the back door, only to be welcomed by an unfamiliar stillness. The office kitchen looked the same; one table, four chairs, one big fridge, and the same plate left in the kitchen sink that Gary refuses to wash. s I was enveloped further by the fetid odor, I realized that the stillness wasn’t a lack of presence, but a camouflage, like some hunter propped up behind the tall grass. I was not alone, and I began feeling like the hunter’s game.

Twenty feet in and passed the Kitchen, the stench got considerably worse. Whatever was causing that smell, I was getting closer to it. My face winced as I turned into the first floor hallway, and my mind flooded with new hypotheticals to explain the bizarre stink. A racoon shit and died somewhere in the building. But how could it have gotten in? Perhaps there was a sewage leak in the building, our neighborhood is chock-full of old buildings, it’s definitely possible that one of the old pipes burst somewhere in the walls and was leaking internally.

When I reached the end of the hallway, I cautiously convinced myself that the burst sewage pipe scenario was in fact the reality. It wasn’t until I stepped by the door leading into the basement that I saw my first clue as to the cause of the stench. 

I stood in horror as I began tracing the small, black specks littered all across the ground. Each one of them had the same dark pitch and sheen from the blotch I found in the boss’ office. But where the boss’ stain pooled, these were sprayed out. Whoever’s bile this belonged to must have coughed or vomited violently. What the hell happened here?

I peered around the floor noticing that the specks increased in consistency towards the basement door. Perhaps I was in too much shock to process the bizarre events occurring around me, or maybe I was just plain stupid, but I threw open the door leading into the basement. The air from the swinging door hit me with another wave of decayed air. The mask helped avoid tasting whatever fumes were lingering down those steps, but it didn’t keep my eyes from watering. Wiping my face, I yelled down.

“Hello!? Ian, Boss, is someone down there? What the hell is going on here? Whatever it is it’s not safe, lets get out, I can call the–”

My words were abruptly interrupted by a loud heaving noise, followed by a heavy plash. I stood in silence, wanting to know what was happening down there, but too hesitant to make the first step. I called out once more, only to be met by Ian’s piercing wails from down below. Recognizing the muddied cries, I ran down the steps.

I probably stared at the mess that was my friend Ian for only a few seconds, but the image of his face is still burned into my memory. Whatever illness Ian had over the course of 3 days must have festered in each of his orifices, leaving streaks of the bile dripping across his body. The white of his eyes were nearly gone, as though his tear ducts produced only bile instead of moisture. Clotted, blackened blood plopped out of each nostril instead of dripping like a regular nosebleed. Worst of all, the tar-like vomit was still dribbling down his chin, caking the floor in front of him while encrusting his button down shirt and forearms. Even the sweat protruding from his pores had a darker hint to them. Whatever sickness my friend was dealing with, it was eating my friend from the inside. 

Ian’s body slowly leaned in my direction. I couldn’t tell if he recognized me, or if he just felt the presence of another human being, but I could make out the last gurgled words I’d ever hear from him again.

*“Gh-ghelrp… m-mrhee…”*

**---**

The doctors said Ian’s condition was a rare immune disorder called Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia, or HHT. In short, his blood vessels formed abnormally within his body at an unusual pace, causing internal tears throughout his body. After rolling him into the hospital, they explained that mixed with the various peptic ulcers found in his stomach, Ian’s body was producing and extracting a tainted mixture of coagulated blood, stomach acid, and lithocholic acid. According to the doctor, recent research has shown that changes in our environment can alter the human body at a genetic level. Children can grow up with no allergies, only to develop violent reactions when they move cross-country. Chances were that the same thing had happened to Ian, but instead just more grizzly. 

What they couldn’t explain was why Ian’s bodily fluids turned pitch black. After reading online, I found that unless with specific drugs, blood won’t turn black naturally unless exposed to excessive amounts of oxygen. Ian was mostly drowning in his own blood and stomach acids that were breathing in copious amounts of air, so what else could have caused it? The question never left my head, but I had a far more pressing concern–what happened to the boss?

Now, if you think I didn’t connect the dots between the vegan dogs and Ian’s sickness, you’d be wrong. Of *course* it was connected–my black spit, the dark blotch in the boss’ room, and now this? I knew it had to be the cause somehow, and I’m just glad I couldn’t finish mine completely. But what was I supposed to do, approach a bunch of professional doctors or the police and shout ‘help, help, a vegan hotdog killed my friend’? I needed proof first before making myself look insane.

While I needed to find answers, the same thought crossed my mind over and over again. If two or three vegan dogs did that to Ian over the course of three days, what could one vegan dog do to the boss in three weeks? I prayed that eating less of them helped prevent whatever black magic shit was going on. Did you have to eat several? How about a single dog, or a single bite, or even a single speck, did it even matter? Part of me hoped that the doctor was right, that Ian’s condition was some freak genetic mishap. Otherwise, I may be in trouble too. Even though my taste buds rejected it, I still managed to take two bites. 

*One full vegan dog? One bite? Maybe only a crumb?* \- These thoughts bounced back and forth in my skull that night and the next morning as I rode my bike up to the boss’ house. Thankfully it's a straight, 20 minute shot up McCorcoran Road near where my apartment building is. The boss held quarterly parties for when we reached out quotas or large projects for that year. Once everyone arrived, he would always start the party by saying the same corny joke.

“What do you get when you have empty bottles of vodka, wine, rye whiskey, bourbon, Jägermeister, and brandy? One cool alcoholic!”

Ironically, he never drank. But that never stopped him from being a great host. It was more than 3 weeks since anyone heard from him. The other employees just assumed he travelled somewhere, or just wanted to work from home more. The boss was a bachelor all his life, never married, and never had kids. He had no one. It’s sad thinking that no one even bothered to check in on him until I pulled up to the large doors of his home. *If* the boss contracted whatever vegan illness this was, I sure as hell didn’t want to catch it. But if he was still alive, I couldn’t live with myself knowing I tried nothing to help him. 

I was better prepared this time, with my makeshift wet-rag mask, a pair of goggles, and a flashlight to spot traces of any bile. I prayed that either I found the boss alive enough to call the paramedics, or at the very least dead so that whatever suffering he was in would be over. 

The boss lived in a large house, bigger than one of those McMansions you see all across the Midwest–one of those old money type locations. I never really noticed how imposing the facade was with no lights on, like some kind of sleeping animal in hibernation. On the inside, the building was turn of the century, elevated by classic interior decor you’d expect only to see in the Great Gatsby. Red-velvet lined the walls of the first floor, matched with dark oak wood as flooring. Each piece of furniture was unique, even the kitchen chairs. Not sure what more to expect from eccentrics like the boss. These details and more flooded back to me as I approached the front stoop. But just like Ian in the office, I was greeted by a heavy wall of decay as I broke my way through the front door, only this time the disease’s effects were starker. 

As soon as the door fell down, black flakes of dried bile flew about the foyer in haphazard directions. Instead of a handful of specks scattered around, streaks of what I can only assume was dried bile lined the once luxurious walls like a violent crime scene. The old floors were already rotten through, making it all the more  difficult to navigate the reset of the building. Moving past the foyer’s staircase and into the back living room, each step I took sunk into the carped,ushing the dark, membranous sludge under my shoes. Each breath I took gulped the humid atmosphere, making me fear just being in the building would drown in my own bodily waste. As bad as farms and slaughterhouses were, their health conditions were astronomically better than everything that was before me. 

What first struck me was a single lamp, illuminating the room with a flickering light from the corner, only hindered by a soaked lightshade dripping in grey fluid. I questioned how I didn’t see it while I approached, despite having a clear line of sight from the front door window to the back. Looking across the floors and walls, I noticed that the entire room was encapsulated by the same fluid, blotting out the windows, like some grotesque cocoon. The ceiling leaked the fluid, with spots of mold growing from corner to corner. Given the state of things It was a miracle that the house was still standing. But why was this room humid and moist? The foyer was caked with dried like blood stains or vomit would, yet this was fresh. Gazing up, I realized that the ceiling was not just affecting the entire room, but was the source of the membrane. Whatever was causing this must have been upstairs. With still no sign of the boss, I traced back my steps to the foyer to head of the stairs, each step sloshing into the carpeting. 

I nearly slipped on the pooling black waste as I turned the corner into the building's second story hallway. Carefully gliding to not lose balance, I opened the door to the boss’ bedroom.

What was, or had been, on the bed I cannot and dare not say here. What laid in front of me was no longer my boss–at least, not entirely. The boss' corpse decayed and rolled out into a jumbled thicket of blackened vines and branches, sprawled wide across walls and floor, pulsating from the ravaged husk of his body’s mouth, nose, and massive protrusion from his torso. Each vine and branch seemed to slither with support from viscous fluid seeping from their pours. The yellow, bloated skin of his forehead, pale eyes, and splayed ribcage were the only things visible that proved he was once human. Though his eyes stared blankly at me, I find it hard to believe he was aware of my presence. Much like the old house, the thicket creaked and groaned with every pained gasp for air he could muster–though I could no longer tell where exactly he was breathing from, given the absence of lungs. Not just lungs, but any internal organ for that matter. I tried my hardest not to speak, let alone scream, out of fear of waking up whatever monstrosity this was. No disease could have done this, perhaps an extraterrestrial parasite at best. Only a supernatural solution could answer such an otherworldly question.

My silence broke after stumbling backward, tripping on a loose vine tethered to armoire next to me. The husk howled out from the chest cavity, as though some animal was straining to stay alive. The vines and branches shivered up and down, as though reacting to my touch. Fearing it would try to entangle me, I stood up pressing my back against the doorframe, panting through my now darkened mask having collected the tainted moisture in the air. Hacking and crying, I threw the makeshift mask on the ground out worrying about contamination. Looking back up and clearing my googles is when I noticed then that the boss’ eyes shifted directly towards me. The thicket didn’t kill the boss, but somehow preserved whatever brain function he had left–a living sarcophagus. 

Fearing whatever effects exposing myself to the plant-like tangle, I ran back down the steps only to be lambasted again by noxious air. What I was not expecting to see was a hazy cloud rising from the living room space. A fire, at a time like this? A flickering light and the home’s ancient foundation could have started an electrical fire, but it seemed unlikely such a small spark could have ignited a room so dank and humid. I didn’t have time to mull over it running down the staircase. Once outside the contaminated home, I did the only thing I could do and witnessed the home slowly engulfed in flames. 

I don’t know how long I stood there in shock before I heard fire engines off in the distance. Afraid they’d pin the house’s damages on me, I propped myself back on my back, wheezing the tainted air out from my lungs with every step. Though the adrenaline focused my mind to keep me from passing out, I was able to feel some form of contentment knowing that the boss’ involuntary cremation would put whatever suffering he was going through to an end. Perhaps it was the adrenaline, the smoke, or whatever else was filling my lungs from that house, but peering back to the house, I swear I could see his bloated face staring me down from his second story window.
