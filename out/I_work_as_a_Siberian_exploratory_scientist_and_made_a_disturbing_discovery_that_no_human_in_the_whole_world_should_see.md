I am Zhukov, a Siberian exploration scientist who has spent the majority of my career studying the depths of the earth. My team and I were on a mission to uncover the remains of the Kola Superdeep Borehole, a massive hole drilled by Soviet scientists in the 1970s in an attempt to reach the Earth's mantle. As we approached the site, I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at the sheer size of the hole. It was a gaping abyss, seemingly bottomless.

We went near the hole and were preparing ourselves to go down the hole. As we began our descent, I couldn't shake the feeling that we were venturing into the unknown. The walls of the hole were rough and jagged, and the air grew colder with each step. We had to be careful not to slip on the loose rocks and debris that littered the ground. As we reached the bottom, I couldn't believe my eyes. The borehole was still intact, and it was even deeper than we had initially thought.

I knew that this was a once in a lifetime opportunity, and I couldn't pass up the chance to see what lay at the bottom of this hole. I decided to lower a camera down the borehole to see what secrets it held. The camera was equipped with state-of-the-art technology, allowing us to see deep into the earth's depths.

As the camera descended, the images it transmitted back to us were beyond anything I could have imagined. The walls of the hole were made of solid rock, and the temperature was increasing with each foot it descended. But as the camera reached deeper depths, the images grew more and more disturbing. The walls of the hole began to warp and twist, and strange creatures started to appear on the camera's feed. They were unlike anything I had ever seen before. Their bodies were twisted and contorted, and their eyes glowed with an otherworldly light.

I couldn't believe what I was seeing, it was as if we were peering into the very depths of hell. The creatures were writhing and squirming, their mouths open in silent screams. I felt a sense of dread wash over me as I realized that we were not alone in this hole. We were in the presence of something truly terrifying.

I immediately ordered the camera to be pulled back up, but it was too late. The creatures had already latched onto the camera's cable, pulling it down into the depths of the hole. I watched in horror as the cable went taut, and then snapped, sending the camera crashing down into the abyss.

One of the creatures managed to somehow climb up the cable before it snapped and attacked us. My colleague, Daniyel, got taken by the creature and pulled him down to the hellish area never to be seen again. I immediately called the government on the incident and wanted the Kola Superdeep Borehole sealed with anything possible. The Borehole got sealed with a 400 meter depth concrete mixture with a tiny bit of uranium at the bottom to prevent creatures crawling up the hole.

The expedition was over, and I knew that we could never go back down into the hole. It was a portal to the unknown, and I was not prepared to face the terror that lay at its bottom. The Kola Superdeep Borehole may have been a scientific triumph, but it was also a gateway to the unknown, and I was not willing to risk the lives of my team to explore it further.

From that day on, the Kola Superdeep Borehole became known as a place of mystery and terror, and nobody is allowed near it without government permission to do so. I could never shake the memory of the twisted creatures that I had seen on the camera's feed. The true terror of hell had been revealed to me, and I knew that I could never unsee it.
