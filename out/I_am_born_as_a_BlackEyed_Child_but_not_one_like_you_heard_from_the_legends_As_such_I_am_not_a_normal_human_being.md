I was born in 1992 when I was given birth by my mother. My mother, in question, was a religious fanatic who was born and raised in the Christian Beliefs. So it was a horror to see that the child she gave birth look nothing like a normal human being in question.

As for my father, he was killed in a car crash the day before I was born.

I was born with jet black hair, sported into a ponytail. My skin was as white as the snow. I wear simple clothes like a black shirt and pants, and recently started wearing a black trench coat my size to have style on my dark and gloomy presence to everyone seeing me. I never physically age past 10 years, and I'm still a Black-Eyed Child to this day.

Because of my birth, my mother's life was ruined as she was forced to care for me. Or so she believed.

Turns out, she discovered I don't need the necessities like normal human beings would. Like food, drink, or sleep. In fact, my body never suffers from starvation, dehydration, or sleep deprivation. I'm just an endless ball of energy that can run out.

I never cried when I was a newborn or infant, making my mother's life easier. Granted, there was something about her nature and her environment she grew up in, causing her to never talk to her own child. I pitied her for unwilling to care for her child because of the way I am.

When my tenth birthday in 2002 was over, my mother would abandon me, believing I was beyond saving. This would give the chance to explore the world without anyone stopping me. It's not like anyone would know how to care for someone like me.

I left my childhood home and ran away to Tulsa, discovering I could run 40 Miles per Hour. It also made me discover I was born way stronger than everyone else, even though I'm not the type of person to show off my strength of lifting four-thousand pounds, lifting objects within that weight range.

When I arrived at Tulsa at midnight, it was quiet with a gentle breeze brushing my skin underneath my clothes. Due to how quite it was at midnight, it almost feels like the town was abandoned for no reason, other than giving the subtle feeling of isolation.

Before long, however, I heard a car honking at me and driving at 60 miles per hour. Before I could react, the car hit me square in my small body, sending me flying and ragdolled into a wall, smashing my face, and tumbled into a pile of trash bags.

I was bewildered and terrified over what happened to me. I know for a fact someone my age would be long gone after getting hit a car like that. But in that moment, I realized my injuries healed instantly, as if they never were there, even from my ribcage broken from the car hitting me.

I got up with ease to see a man who looks as if he was in his mid-30s. I could tell he was enraged and violent, almost as if he expected me to die instantly from my body getting flung by his car. My composure was regained the moment I got back to my knees.

"I truly wanted to believe a monster like you never existed. But my fears are realized... I'm sorry..."

The way the deranged man spoke those words sounded like genuine remorse and brokenness. I don't know what was going on his head of his, but I almost felt sorry for him. My opinions on my attempted-murderer didn't matter, though, as he pulled out a Glock and gave me 28 bullet wounds.

Feeling dread and terror from my body, I pushed through the bullets as the armed man walked me down while gunning me. As he shot the 28th bullet into my body, I grabbed the gun while he was holding it. A brief struggle occurred as I easily overpowered the man in strength as I pointed the Glock at his head, contemplating whether I should shoot him.

I ultimately decided he'd get off too easy from being murdered as I forced his arms to point the Glock to the femoral artery and fired the final bullet, making him scream in agony as blood ran down his leg in gruesome fashion.

I decided to test my striking power on the man as I sat him up from where he collapsed, getting him onto his knees. He stared into my pure black eyes in horror, believing I might kill after I'm done toying with him. The only words I'd ever spoke to the man were...

***"You know how Mass times Acceleration equals Force, right? Well, here's my way of adding to that."***

***"Strength times Technique equals Devastation..."***

I used 100 percent of my muscles and delivered the most precise shot to his left ribs with one arm that can lift 4000 pounds, while normally liftng 2000 pounds. I felt all of his ribs not break, but shatter at the enormous force behind my fist. The man screamed in horror and agony before I delivered another punch to his right ribs, shattering them. I stood over him, realizing my changes.

My ponytail was gone and my jet my black hair spiked up, similar to static hair. My skin turned into a dark grey, and had black veins protruding from my skin. I didn't have time to marvel at my sudden change, however, as multiple cars and trucks gathered, and people ran over to the deranged man. I assumed the people in question were his family members based on various ages.

When they turned to see me, they understandably looked awestricken and horrified at my presence as I returned to my normal state.

It didn't take long for police and the paramedic to arrive to pick up the lunatic of a man and send him over to a hospital, where if he recovers, might as well be sent to rehab or a mental institution. The police commissioner would ask me a few questions and I answered his questions to the best of my ability. The commissioner would pat me on the head and told me these words.

***"I don't know what you are, kid. But the way I see it, the whole world's gonna know about this eventually. Until then, make something of yourself when you grow up. Do it for me, alright?"***

I nodded my head as the police commissioner gave me permission to state at a hotel with no payment or rent required. He was right about one thing. My existence will be known to the world one day. Even into the present day, my existence is still unknown. I'm currently way stronger than I was over 20 years ago. And I still live in the hotel the police commissioner let me stay in.

**So, there's one question I want to ask. And want your opinions:**

***Am I Human or a Monster?***
