I’m glad everyone liked the [last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/14hjnjl/how_to_survive_college_i_think_everyone_is_going/).  I feel pretty good about it.  I think I’ve been trying to be someone I’m not all this time.  Like if I just tried hard enough and kept at it long enough, I’d somehow magically morph into a savvy monster-slaying badass.  Life doesn’t work that way, though.  I firmly believe that people can change, but we can’t change that drastically.  We have to work with what we’ve got.  And just like how I almost failed math until the devil taught me in a different way, I just needed to find a way to deal with the monsters that played to my strengths instead of hoping that I’ll outgrow my weaknesses overnight.

I’m sorry I’m not going to be the heroine you were all hoping for.  But this is who I am.

You aren’t the only ones happy about the flickering man getting his face melted by a rock.  The laundry lady is thrilled.  She didn’t just steal, wash, and fold my laundry this time.  She also put it away.

At four in the morning.

Cassie, thankfully, didn’t wake up.  I half-expected her to, as she’s taken to sleeping with the petrified wood under her pillow.  I figured whatever effect it had on the inhuman might also negate whatever was keeping her asleep whenever the laundry lady came calling.  It did not.  I was quite relieved.  I know my friends want to help, but this is one mess I really don’t want to be dragging them in.

“Well he’s quite upset,” she said cheerfully as she put my jeans away in their drawer.  “Good job!  I knew you’d be useful.”

I didn’t have to ask who she was talking about.  I crawled over to the edge of the loft bed and stared down at her.  My laundry sat in a neat pile on top of my desk.  I noticed that my desk had also been organized and everything put away neatly in its place.  I mean, she kind of had to.  There wouldn’t have been any room to stack my laundry, otherwise.

“I am curious about what you used against him, though,” she continued.  “Would you share with me what it was?”

“Something from back home,” I lied.

She turned to look at me and her lips were thin with displeasure, but I didn’t say anything else.  She knew I was lying.  But that’s how it was with inhumans.  We could lie all we liked to them.  The laundry lady might be my ally right now, but I wasn’t about to reveal to her the one thing that could keep me safe.  It never ended well when an inhuman found out about such a tool.

“Fine then,” she said curtly.  “See if I keep using the good detergent and laundry softener on your clothing.  Hope you like scratchy underwear.”

I don’t believe her.  She still put everything away, perfectly folded, perfectly organized.  I don’t think she can do a bad job on the laundry.  It’s against her nature.

So I’ve still got my inhuman laundry service and the existence of the rock is still a secret.  And speaking of the rock… some of you asked about the professor with the piece of petrified wood that looks like a heart if you squint enough and use a healthy dose of imagination.  I hadn’t seen him for a while, which worried me, but none of the other professors seemed concerned so I didn’t know what to think.  I started making a habit of just happening to walk down the corridor after class to see if he was in his office.  He wasn’t, not for a while.

Then finally, he was.

I guess even ghosts aren’t a valid reason to not hold university mandated office hours.

“Oh hey,” I said, all casual like, as if I just happened to be passing by and hadn’t been practically stalking his office for a week.  “Everything okay?”

He put on a confused look.

“Yeah, everything is fine.  Why?” he said.

As if he hadn’t recently been cowering in my classroom because he saw a ghost.  I sighed inwardly.  He was going to pretend nothing was going on.  Fine.  I guess he has to, considering he works for the administration.  I quickly scanned the surface of his desk.The stone wasn’t there.

“What happened to that piece of petrified wood?” I asked.  “I found what I think is another piece by the edges of the graveyard and wanted to compare them.”

“Oh… that.”  He shuffled nervously at some books on his desk.  “Well, I think it was stolen.  Or I lost it.  I probably lost it.”

He sounded like he was trying to convince himself.  Which makes me think… it vanished in a way he doesn’t fully understand.

“But you keep your office locked when you’re not here, right?” I asked.

“Yeah, damndest thing, I know I locked it and then the next morning it was gone.  So I guess it got misplaced.”

Then he looked up from his desk and smiled at me, a fake, forced smile of someone keeping it together because they have no other choice.  I felt bad for him.  Without the stone, he was likely still seeing that ghost everywhere, and he was probably the least prepared of all the professors to deal with the inhuman.  He’d denied it for so long and now his world was eroding around him just like the riverbanks he took students on field trips to measure.

“If you bring the stone by,” he said, “I can take a look at it.  And if I can’t identify it, then I know Professor Monotone can.”

No he doesn’t actually call him Professor Monotone, I’m using code names still because my professors are easily found on google.

“Oh that’s great,” I said.  “Thanks!  Hope you find your rock!”

I have no intention of showing him Cassie’s piece of the stone.  I had it on me, our bargain was still in effect.  I carried it during the day and she kept it once the sun went down.  But I left it in my backpack and walked off down the hallway.I did not see the stabbed student.  I hadn’t seen it since I started carrying the stone.

I am still seeing the tree roots, however.  The ones coating the floor of the lecture hall.  But only if I get drowsy.  I’ve taken to drinking a lot of coffee before and during my lectures.

Oh hey, speaking of coffee.

I got fired from my barista job.

It… kind of happened recently so honestly I don’t want to talk about it much.  I’m upset, I’m embarrassed, and that’s even with knowing it’s nothing I did.  I’m not just saying that to make myself feel better, either.  My manager said it wasn’t anything I did.  It was just… she kind of shrugged awkwardly and wouldn’t meet my eyes.

It was just someone had been by, asking about me.  His face was all messed up, she said.She looked up at me once, furtively, and held my gaze.  She didn’t need to say it outloud.

The flickering man.

So she fired me because it was safer for everyone that way.  Safer for her and the other students because the flickering man wouldn’t be lurking about.  And safer for me because I wouldn’t be stuck here on a predictable shift that he could learn and lie in wait.I mean I still have classes but it’s easier to skip classes when it’s raining than a job.

That’s what I’m telling myself.  She didn’t fire me because it was the convenient thing to do, because I messed up too many orders and my ability to chase off the possums wasn’t enough to outweigh my inability to make a mocha latte espresso with extra cream and chocolate sprinkles.  Because another inhuman is just too much to deal with and she’d rather I be out of her life so she didn’t have to worry about what happened to me and wouldn’t feel guilty if I died.Because I’m too much to deal with.  Because maybe people don’t want me around after all.

I haven’t told any of my friends yet.  I found a quiet corner of campus and cried by myself for a while until I could go back to the dorm and act like nothing was wrong.  I went through the steps that my therapist taught me, counting up the evidence against the things I was feeling.  I had friends.  They liked me.  They’d done some incredibly brave things on my behalf.  Doesn’t that mean people want me around and everything else was just lies my brain was telling me?

I’m still upset but I’m… coping with it, I think.

Which is good, because when I got back to my dorm Josh was there.

If you need a refresher, Josh is the guy that Cassie knows through the LGBTQIA+ club.  He’s a really nice guy that likes animals and had a pet mouse in his dorm until it escaped and joined the Millions.

Yes, we’re not supposed to name them, but this one already has a name.  I can feel it.  It’s way too late.

“Are you looking for Cassie?” I asked as I walked up.  “I don’t know when she’ll be back, but we’ve both printed our schedules.”

I unlocked the dorm room and he hovered anxiously in the hallway while I checked on the door of Cassie’s closet to see where she was.

“Actually, I kind of wanted to talk to you,” he said.  “If that’s okay.”

He glanced furtively up and down the hallway.

“It’s about them,” he whispered.

I silently let him in and shut the door behind him.  He launched into an explanation of the problem immediately.  The Millions were insatiable.  He was going through a bag of feed every two days - big bags, too.  His parents were going to think he had a drug problem at this rate.  He couldn’t keep blaming textbook prices, even though they really are out of control.

“But most of all,” he said morosely, “I just want my little buddy back.”

I felt so bad for him.  He sat there and even though he’s a big guy, he was just kind of shrinking in on himself, staring sadly at the tacky green carpet cutting we’d put down on the dorm room floor to cut some of the chill in the winter.  I didn’t quite know what to say.

“Sometimes,” I ventured, “giving an inhuman what they want isn’t the right thing to do.  Sometimes it has the opposite effect of appeasing them and instead they get worse and worse, until they become intolerable.”

He was quiet for a moment.

“I think that’s what’s happening here,” he said.  “It’s getting bigger.  I don’t mean numbers, though I can’t really tell.  They’re growing in size.  The individual rats and mice.”

Certainly concerning.  I licked my lips nervously.  I had to think.  I’d proven with the flickering man that if I just slowed down and thought about it, then I could devise a strategy to deal with my problems.  A careful strategy with contingency plans that didn’t rely on heroics.

“We could try removing the thing that brought them to your room in the first place,” I suggested.

He raised his head, his eyes alight with hope.

His mouse.  His little buddy.

We’d get it back for him.

The Millions were willing to talk and bargain, which meant that we could use trickery to get what we wanted.  It was probably our best strategy against them, as there weren’t any reasonable weapons that I could think of that might work against a horde.  Besides, if we used violence, that might hurt Josh’s mouse pet and defeat the purpose of doing any of this.

I wasn’t entirely convinced that removing the thing that brought the Millions here would banish it, but at the very least Josh would get his little friend back.

The Millions came at a predictable time, which made it easy for us.  Josh told his roommate that he was going to have a date night and would be bringing his date back to watch movies and cuddle afterwards.  The roommate agreed to be somewhere else for the evening and that cleared out the room for us.

I stationed myself up in the loft bed.  I’d be out of the way up there, and could carry out our backup plan if any part of this went wrong from relative safety.  We both agreed that the Millions could perhaps swarm and climb the bed if given enough time, but I could carry out both Plan B and Plan C before my position was overwhelmed.

Josh was the one taking all the risk.  He insisted, though.  This was his problem.  He had to be the one to solve it.  He couldn’t ask someone else to put themself in danger over his mouse, after all.

I admit this was a welcome change after all that bullshit with Daniel.

I was kind of relieved.  I didn’t want to be the one down there with the Millions.  I desperately didn’t want to be down there.  The thought of all those eyes and all those paws scuttling around like a living carpet of bone and fur, less than a foot away… it made my skin crawl.  It was nice to not be the person up close and personal with the inhuman for once.

Besides.  Josh’s insistence was out of a sense of moral duty, but it was very likely that the rules of the inhuman world were going to be in play as well.  The campus doesn’t adhere precisely to the stories, but there’s some remnants here and there.  Like the school has taken the established foundation and broken it down for pieces, pulling bricks here and there to build something new with.

We are all responsible for our own grades.  Our success here weighs entirely on our shoulders and no one else’s.  A number of my professors have said something along these lines.

So then this bad bargain with the Millions could only be resolved by the person with whom it was made.

We watched movies in Josh’s room until thirty minutes until the Millions showed up.  They were a punctual creature, at least.  I climbed into the loft bed and positioned myself at the edge.  Everything I needed for Plan B and Plan C were already up there.

Josh was on a chair.  He crouched on it so that no part of him was touching the floor.  He had to be low enough to reach the ground.  We’d positioned it so that he could easily stand and grab hold of the rungs to the other loft bed opposite where I was waiting.

At precisely the turn of the hour, Josh’s closet door began to rattle.  It shook with the scratching of countless paws, then it began to rattle on its track.  It jerked sideways and I saw tiny claws appear in the crack.  Then it began to roll in starts and stops, being forced ever more open as bodies flowed through the gap and across the floor.

The Millions had arrived.  They were hungry.

And they were big.  The mice were almost the size of rats now.  My stomach churned with anxiety.

“I’ve got your food ready,” Josh said.

He sounded nervous.  I couldn’t blame him.  The rodents were already scratching at the legs of his chair, anxiously, angrily, demanding their daily meal.

“But before I give it to you, can I ask a favor?” he continued.  “I brought a treat for Avery.  Are they with you?  I miss them and want to see that they’re okay.”

He held out a glob of peanut butter on one finger.  The horde rippled, drawing back and staring at it with beady eyes, turning the floor into a sea of glassy reflections.

The mass split.  The mouth spoke.

“There is no Avery here,” it said.  “There is only the Millions.”

“Okay, I get that.  But there’s still a mouse that is now part of the Millions that used to be Avery, right?  C’mon, I just want to give them some peanut butter again.  They loved peanut butter.”

The Millions considered.  The gap that formed its mouth closed up again and the rodents shook themselves as one, creating a cascade of rippling fur that ran up and down the length of the room.  I realized that I was holding my breath and forced myself to exhale and inhale once.

The Millions didn’t want to admit individuality of any one member.  Their power was in their numbers.  Their unity.However, the Millions also really wanted that peanut butter.

The mass parted once more.  It drew back from the base of the chair and left standing alone a single mouse.  This one was, thankfully, a normal size.  It hadn’t grown obscenely large yet.

Avery.

“Here you go,” Josh whispered, leaning forward, holding out the peanut butter.  “I brought you a snack.”

It stretched out its nose and sniffed at the peanut butter.  Raised both paws and began to lick at it.

This was working.  He only had to entice Avery a little closer so he could grab them.

Then Josh fell off the chair.

I guess I should have seen it coming.  He was pretty overbalanced already.  Stretching out that far to reach little Avery did him in.

But even as he fell, he was still trying to keep his little mouse buddy safe.  He landed over top of Avery, his weight falling on his wrists as he cupped his hands to shield the mouse.  The chair fell too, and with it went the bottle of peanut butter.

The Millions could not wait any longer.  They swarmed it, a handful of tiny bodies clawing their way into the bottle and gobbling up as much as they could before being ripped out by the mice behind them.  Within seconds, the bottle was stripped clean.And they were still hungry.

Josh was on the ground, cradling his mouse.  He was whimpering slightly and he wasn’t trying to get up.  He’d landed awkwardly.  He might have hurt himself - no, I was pretty sure he had hurt himself.  All his body weight had gone on his wrists.  Not his hands, not his forearms.  His *fucking* wrists.

The Millions came for him next.  I watched in helpless horror as they swarmed over his legs and arms, clawing at his clothing, biting through it to reach the tender flesh beneath.  He got one leg underneath him and began to stand.  His arms were awkwardly clutched to his chest, his hands cradling something between them.The furry mass on the ground bulged.  Like a bubble about to burst.  The mice climbed one on top of each other, wrapping around his leg, until he was knee-deep into the horde.

He tried to take a step.  Stumbled.  The horde remained attached to him, following him down as he fell for a second time.  This time, he landed on his shoulder, refusing to let go of little Avery, not even to save himself.

The Millions paused only a moment.  All those beady eyes rotated away from the thick fabric of his jeans and his shirt and stared instead at the vulnerable, exposed meat of Josh’s face.

I was going to watch him die.  Just like Steven had died.  I was only good for getting people killed.

“Ashley!” he hissed from the ground as he tried to get up, even as the Millions swarmed across his back.  His voice was tight with pain..  “The bag!”

I fumbled at it with trembling fingers.  Backup plan.  We had a backup plan.  My mouth was dry with fear as I tipped it over the edge of the loft bed.  But we’d anticipated that.  We’d prepared everything in advance, slit the bag open, positioned it so that all I had to do was lift up the bottom a little.  A slight movement, something I could accomplish even if my blood was cold with terror and my muscles were locked into place.

The feed poured out in a steady stream, tumbling over the edge of the loft and down to the ground.  The Millions immediately turned their attention to the waterfall of food.  They climbed over each other in their eagerness to reach it, like the ocean tide rushing in.  Without them weighing him down, clinging to his legs, Josh was able to get up.  He edged around them and towards where I was waiting on the bed.

“Hurry,” I hissed, eying the pile of food.  “It’s going quick.”

The Millions was insatiable.  Josh had to be off the ground before they finished their meal.

He raised both hands towards me.  I reached down and carefully, very carefully, took the mouse that he held between his caged fingers.  I could feel its heart beating rapidly against the skin of my palm.  It held very still.  Did it know we were saving it?  Did it want to be saved?

“I got them,” I whispered.  “I’ve got Avery.”

He stepped back and glanced around.  He held his arms against his stomach and seemed unwilling - or unable - to bend his wrists.  Could he climb like this?  I glanced down at Plan C.  There was always that.

But Josh is tall and he just walked over to the desk, sat down, and then pulled his legs up behind him.

Just as the Millions finished with the bag of food.They spread out like a blot of ink dropped into water, coating the floor once more with their sleek bodies.  They moved back and forth and when they split to form a mouth, it rippled like a reflection in a stream.

“We are hungry,” it gurgled.

“No more food,” Josh said firmly.  “I’m going to take care of just Avery from here out.”

“Give us your flesh again,” it demanded.  “It was… so sweet.”

Josh didn’t reply.  He just remained huddled on the desk, watching as the mice turned to stare at him with their bright, glittering eyes.But they couldn’t get at him.  And Josh wasn’t about to get down and give them what they demanded.

They stared at him for the full hour.  I stayed on the loft bed, watching the minutes creep agonizingly by, listening to Josh’s pained breathing.  The mouse cradled between my hands eventually turned around a couple times, curled up, and went to sleep.  Then when the hour was past, the Millions simply turned away, abandoned their vigil, and returned to the closet.We waited a good half hour before getting down from the safety of our perches, just in case.

Avery was placed back in their cage.  After some careful investigation, we decided that Josh hadn’t broken anything and we didn’t need to go to the ER.  We could make do with some light first aid until the morning.  I helped clean up the bites and we wrapped and braced his wrists so they’d be kept immobile until the morning.  Then as soon as it opened, he popped into the campus clinic where he was diagnosed with one sprained wrist, put into a brace, and sent home with painkillers.

He wasn’t upset.  He had Avery back, after all.  And that night, he stayed up waiting with a bag of food (just in case) and the Millions came, they scratched at the closet door, but Avery was no longer hidden in the closet and they did not open the door to enter the room.

I don’t know if Josh is safe just yet.  But he’s going to take Avery home this weekend and leave them with his parents and so long as he’s in his loft before the hour when the Millions comes in search of food, perhaps it’ll all be okay.

Yeah.  I think it’ll be okay this time.

And oh yeah, if you’re curious, Plan C was to hold a lighter up to the smoke detector in the room.  Inhumans don’t like commotion and there’s nothing that’ll get students riled up more than a fire alarm in the middle of the night.

I am… really glad we didn’t have to use Plan C.[\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)
