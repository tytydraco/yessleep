You know the feeling when an old friend whom you haven’t been in touch with for ages, suddenly texts out of the blue? Why now? Where the hell have they been? Do they genuinely want to get back in contact? Do *you*?

That’s what happened two months ago, when I got a text from Cody Erhardt, after a year.

I was sitting alone in my apartment one Saturday evening scrolling through stuff on my phone, when the message suddenly popped up.

I was pretty damn surprised at first. It had to be him, though, I didn’t know any other Codys (I don’t actually know too many other people, if it comes to that) and it was his old number.

The text simply read: *Hey, Jay. Sending-*

I just sat there for a few moments, the phone in my hand.

It was an odd and unexpected message to say the least but before I set myself to ponder just what it could mean I began to reminisce, naturally, over the old days. Cody and I had met in our teens, when we had some unfortunate experiences in common. But I hadn’t seen much of him in the last three years, and the last time I had seen him had been at his homecoming, eighteen months ago. His homecoming from prison.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It had all begun with that damn fool writing group. I mean, the counselling or support or whatever you want to call it, that goes around recommending writing therapy to people. People that are supposed to be in need of such a thing. People like Cody Erhardt. And, to a lesser extent, me.

Do you really want me to go into the background of it all? Let me just summarise by saying that we were a classic pair of troubled teens, from broken, unloving (etc, etc) homes. Our stories were no different from a million others. And we didn’t want to attend counselling. But finally, more out of curiosity than anything else, we did. That was where we’d first met.

To everyone’s surprise Cody rather took to the writing suggestion when it came up. Honestly you wouldn’t have thought it to look at him. The saying ‘don’t judge a book by its cover’ seemed particularly apposite in this case. Nothing bookish about him at all, never had been. I would have thought that writing would be about the last thing on earth he would ever want to be involved in. He was too good-looking for one thing. Not that writers can’t be good-looking I suppose. But anyway, I’m drifting off the point. Evidently there was something that had long been hidden in him, a vein of creativity that took off at the slightest encouragement.

At first, I ribbed him a little about the dangers of ending up as a cringy poet or something. But poetry wasn’t his thing. Nor journalling either. Instead the damned group set him afire with the idea of writing stories. Actual stories. And admittedly there was enough material in his life already to set him up. Family dysfunction, substance abuse, dropping out of high school, girlfriend troubles, even a magnificent RTA. Even though we trod similar paths his life had already been crammed with far more significant incident than mine. Whoever heard of a writer with the first name Cody, though? I sure as hell hadn’t. No doubt I’m being too judgemental again but it didn’t seem a literary name to me at all. Maybe he could set a precedent.

As for me, I would be his agent. I wasn’t bitten by the literary bug myself, as such. I just wanted to get involved on the mercenary side of things.

(Yet here *I* am telling this story – *his* story, mainly.)

The long and short of it is, I encouraged him to write when no one else did. The writing group fever might have worn off soon enough otherwise, but it was I who kept egging him on.

But before he really got down to it, he said, he had to find even more material. More incident, ever more vivid, dramatic. At least that’s what he believed, but I was of the private opinion that he was in danger of becoming a flat-out bore.

Not long after the counselling sessions, Cody embarked upon a totally wild career. Fights/injuries, a deliberate smash-up this time, and dedicated drug-dealing, not just taking. And only I understood why he was doing these things. Collecting more writing material, to make a sensational novel. Everyone else said, or at least intimated, that it was just the predictable result of his upbringing. I did try to get him to tone things down a bit, but evidently I didn’t try nearly hard enough. I blame myself now for that of course. Before he got *too* out of control, though, some prison time intervened, as the courts did not look too sympathetically on his writing alibi.

He didn’t seem to mind going to prison, in fact he welcomed it as it gave him the chance to get on with his writing. And of course prison life itself furnished him with more material. The best thing, when he came to write it all properly, would be that all this colourful stuff would have the ring of absolute authenticity. He had literally lived all this shit. There would be genuine conviction in every word.

This was all very well, but secretly I wondered if it really would make such riveting reading. Therefore I suggested, on one of my visits, that he try to write something a bit different, as well. Original.

He grinned. ‘Not possible, dude. Nothing new under the sun. Didn’t some guy say that about 3000 years ago?’

‘Well, it’s something to think about,’ I urged.

There was a faraway look in his eyes. ‘You know, it’s not a bad idea, actually. Something *really* original. Something to aim for, right?’  He stared into the distance awhile then turned back to me. ‘Thanks man. You know, you’re the only one who’s ever *really* encouraged me to write, anyways. You’ll be the first to get my manuscript when it’s done.’

It sounded less of a promise than a threat, although no doubt he meant it kindly, in the spirit of our old friendship.

‘Well, thanks,’ I said, trying to make it sound enthusiastic.

‘You’ll see – when I get it all into shape.’

I wondered how many more years that would take, but didn’t say it aloud. Instead, I smiled back. ‘Sure. Look forward to it.’ I added jokingly, ‘Surprise me.’

Like I said, the last time I’d seen him was at his homecoming from prison, arranged by his official girlfriend at the time (a different one to when he’d gone in). Her name was Sophie Redmond and she wasn’t over-friendly, at least to me, but she seemed smitten enough with Cody, and no-one could deny that they made a very attractive couple. During that celebratory meal, I sat on one side of him while she sat on the other, and I tried to gauge mentally where he was at. There was something different about him now. That was what prison life can do to you, was my first thought, naturally. But actually, as far as I could gather nothing very terrible had happened and he hadn’t been in for the worst kind of offences anyway. It was just that he seemed more distant than formerly. I asked him about the writing of course. That was the one thing that seemed to jolt him out of his reverie.

‘Going good, thanks,’ he replied shortly. I couldn’t help but feel I had hit a nerve.

‘Got any original ideas?’ I more than half-suspected he hadn’t managed to get anything down at all.

‘You’ll see it when it’s time,’ was all he would say.

And that was the last time I’d seen him. For some reason our once-solid friendship didn’t seem so solid after all. Perhaps his current girlfriend was the hawk-type that kept her claws (not to mention her beak) in him, preventing him from seeing his old friends and all, but then he wasn’t the type to be dominated by anyone. There was just … something on his mind. Not really a matter of re-adjusting to life outside of prison, either, he hadn’t been in that long (he’d served less than two years of a four-year stretch).

But the last I *heard* from him, six months later, he seemed to be doing pretty well. In fact, it sounded like things were coming on by leaps and bounds. He and Sophie had actually moved into a privately rented, old but quite serviceable apartment, where the landlord presumably was of the easy-going kind, and also was no doubt charmed by the sight of Sophie at Cody’s side. As well as being pretty, she held a fairly decent office position, and even Cody had found himself steady work at a garage which took him on in spite of – or perhaps because of – his criminal record. (Not that I’m suggesting that this garage was any more, or any less, shady than a lot of other businesses.) So he seemed to be settling down alright.

But I didn’t find myself in any great hurry to see him again. Mainly, because I regretted ever having encouraged his writing delusions. I’d long ago stopped expecting to make any kind of money out of any kind of literary project, of course, that had only ever been a youthful fantasy. But I regretted ever having encouraged him in his writing when he turned out to be so cliched at it and did all those stupid things just to get his material. Although now, at my initial suggestion he was going to try for something original. Wonder how that would turn out? Anyway, I was happy to give him some space for a while. And more and more time passed, until now a whole year had gone by since we’d even texted. I hadn’t meant to let things drift *that* long.

And now he was in touch again.

I sat irresolutely for a while then began typing.

Cody! What’s up my man? Long time!!

Reading it over, my message had the odd effect of seeming both effusive and stilted at the same time. That was how I felt about Cody’s sudden re-appearance (in a manner of speaking) after so long.

I waited for his reply. None came. I sent a couple more messages, without result. I tried calling, and it went straight to voicemail.

He was playing the cryptic game.

The first sense of unease settled on me but I shook it off impatiently. Mainly I just felt rather bamboozled. And I was being rather slow, because it wasn’t until I went out into the hall that I saw something lying on the mat, that it hit me just what Cody was on about.

‘Sending’ could only mean one thing, from Cody. All this time he’d been working like a *real* hermit, maybe, shut away in his ivory tower getting his material into shape. And now he had sent his first manuscript to me! Trust him to do it this way, in so sudden and dramatic a fashion. I didn’t know how I felt being the recipient. Mixed emotions for sure. I would have to be honest.  But I wasn’t any kind of literary expert, although he knew that anyway, of course. It was just because of our old friendship.

But on stooping to the mat, I saw that ‘manuscript’ was rather a glorified description. It was literally just one sheet of paper – rather thick and rough to be sure, almost more like an artist’s canvas actually. Although of course a manuscript *could* just be one sheet, but still… And was this all he had come up with after his seclusion?

*I did it.*

*Hell to the yeah*

*Watch me burn, man. I’m hot.*

That was what I read, and the writing was so forceful it had practically gone through even that rough, thick material, as if the writer had been in the grip of intense emotion. It looked like Cody’s writing, too, but at the time I hardly registered the words, because I had noticed something else that made me gasp. The paper was spattered with what looked, and smelled, uncommonly like dried blood.

I groaned aloud. Was this meant to be some type of artwork! Cryptic messages! And sending his ‘manuscript’ like this in this ominous fashion, so that it arrived late at night. Damn Cody. He just couldn’t stop with the cliches. He’d made sure to set it up like a goddammed stupid fucking horror movie.

The feeling of unease was strong upon me now. I checked outside my apartment but all was quiet. I wondered just when the note had arrived. It certainly hadn’t been there the last time I had gone into the hall about an hour ago, just before I’d received Cody’s text. And I hadn’t heard any noise, although of course I had been somewhat preoccupied. So Cody had driven over after texting, to shove it under my door quietly as possible and just left again? Goddamn him.

Shaking my head, I went back to examining the note.

Those stains – *were* they actually blood? I’m not exactly a forensic expert but they really did seem to be. Well as long as it was his own blood and no-one else’s, I thought moodily. And not a goddamn cat’s or anything, either. But surely he had never been the type to go around sacrificing cats, or was I being too hopeful?

And then I started worrying about the amount of blood. True, the paper wasn’t *soaked* in it or anything, and it hadn’t been used for the actual writing. But the presence of the stuff on any significant level naturally set alarm bells ringing. Holy shit, what *had* he cut?

And what did the message mean? What the hell was it all about? Did I even know it to be his hand, for sure? I was *fairly* sure, but still not 100%. Because after all it was some years since I had actually seen a sample, and people’s writing *could* change over time.

I checked my phone again. No more messages, of any kind, from anyone.

I just stood for a while, wondering what the hell to do. I even began to think that maybe I should call the police, or something, or at least a mutual friend to see if they could shed any light on things. But this brought me up short. Did we actually *have* any mutual friends any more? I had lost touch with so many people it seemed, in recent years, and certainly with the whole scene which included Cody. There was one guy from that circle, Jack, whom I kept up with only sporadically, and I didn’t really feel like I could call him up point-blank just to inquire if he knew what the hell Cody was playing at.

Which left only one other person, whom I felt even less confident about calling up. Cody’s girlfriend, Sophie. Like I said, she didn’t seem to like me although we had kept up appearances for Cody’s sake, at least for a while. That was why I had her number, but the last (indeed only) time I had called her had been when she was arranging the ‘homecoming’ for Cody. And of course she had never called me. She might not even have the same number anymore.

I pondered for a minute or so longer, and had just decided to try calling either Jack or Sophie when my phone started ringing.

That made me jump more than anything else could’ve done at that moment. I just stood gazing at it for a few seconds, my heart hammering. Finally I picked it up, and when I saw who was calling, it didn’t help to calm me down any.

It was Sophie.

Of course it was. Something was happening with Cody, she needed help, somehow no-one else was available and so she had reached out to me. For a second, I was tempted not to answer at all, as I felt instinctively that shit was just going to get crazier from here on in, but then I nerved myself to do so.

‘Hello?’

‘Is that Jay?’

It sounded like Sophie, alright.

‘Yes.’

‘It’s Sophie. Sophie Redmond? I know it’s been a while, but –‘

‘Yeah.’ I hardly knew what to say to her. Like a dumbass, I came out with ‘How are you?’

‘Uhm ..’ I could almost hear her mentally fumbling for the right words, she seemed even more nonplussed than me.

‘I’m actually calling about Cody,’ she said finally. What a surprise. ‘Have you … uhm … heard from him today, or anything?’

My sense of foreboding kicked up another level at this question. ‘Why?’ I responded, automatically.

‘Because … because … well uhm, I’m in my car, outside his apartment. I couldn’t get in.’

‘What?’

‘I mean, he isn’t answering at all, the door, the phone, anything. But I can see the light on in the living room, the curtains aren’t drawn, well not properly. And I can’t get hold of the landlord either, so I just left a message….And there seems to be no-one else around here and when I called his other friends they were either out or something, or they couldn’t tell me *any*thing about where he might be …’

So I was the last resort, as I’d thought. But then her choice of words struck me. *His* apartment?

‘So you don’t have a key?’ Even as I said this, I felt embarrassed. I had just assumed that she and Cody were still together, but –

She hesitated before replying. ‘I don’t, actually. We, uhm, we had a massive row a couple weeks ago and I just stormed out, and like a *complete* idiot I even left my key … I was pretty mad, you know. But I do still care, I’m not such a bitch,’ she added defensively. ‘It wasn’t *forever,* I just needed some space for a while ….my name’s still on the lease … I’d just like to know he’s alright. Far as I can gather, he’s not been in touch with *any*one in the last few days.’

‘What about his work?’ I was still hedging for time, still not sure how to tell her about the strange messages I’d received.

‘Well, Andy – that’s his supervisor – told me he’d booked the last few days off.’

‘Oh.’ I took a breath. ‘Actually. I *did* get a text from him, just tonight - ‘

She pounced immediately. ‘*Really?* What did he say?’ Even in that moment I could sense her brain whirring, wondering why he had chosen to text a nonentity like me instead of reaching back out to her or to one of his other closer and much cooler friends.

‘Well, to be honest it’s all kind of weird. All he said was “Hey, Jay. Sending.” And even though I texted back and tried calling him and everything, he’s not replied again.’ I glanced back over my shoulder nervously to the hall. ‘And that was over an hour ago, around seven.’

She took this in. ‘’What could he mean?’

‘I don’t know.’ It was the easiest thing to say.

Silence.

‘Sophie? Are you still there?’

‘Yeah. Just thinking. I mean, well shit. What the fuck is going on with him tonight?’

‘Wish I knew,’ I said, feeling more helpless than ever, especially over the business of that stupid ‘manuscript’ or note, whatever it was. Because of that, I couldn’t just lightly reassure her – or myself - that he probably had just gone away for a while, without telling anybody because *he* was needing some space too. And telling her about the note might scare her. God knows I was pretty damn scared myself by this time. But then I thought, I *should* really mention it. This was a strange business, and between the two of us, even though we were just an ex-girlfriend (at least temporarily) and ex-friend, or whatever, we had to try to get the bottom of it. Even if it just turned out to be a stupid prank, or something.

So I walked back to the hall table where I’d left the note, the phone at my ear all the while. ‘Actually, Sophie, there’s something e-’

My words tailed off.

‘What?’

I swallowed. ‘What?’ I asked in my turn.

‘What did you just say?’

I tried to pull myself together. ‘Uh…’ I glanced down at the table. The paper had vanished.

I didn’t mention it to her after all.

&#x200B;

  

I stayed on the line while making a quick search around my small apartment, without success.

She became quite confidential. 

‘You know, I’ve just had the *worst* feeling about him today. Like, something really was up. I know, that probably sounds silly. But it’s just…’ She sighed, a long-drawn out sigh. ‘There’s *some*thing. I mean, there weren’t any issues with *work* or anything, far as I know, and there was never any problem with the rent …. I mean, it certainly *seemed* like he was trying to get his life back together, certainly at first, but ... I don’t know.’ It sounded like she was choking back a sob. ‘Lately it was just getting harder. Not drugs or anything, far as I can tell, but, uh … he just seemed so ... well, *distant.*’ I had already noted that a year-and-a-half before. ‘I should *never* have left my damn key. When was the last time *you* spoke to him?’

‘It’s been quite a while,’ I admitted. ‘About a year, in fact. I’ve not actually *seen* him, you know, since that dinner ….’

‘Oh.’

Another silence.

‘What do we do?’ she asked finally.

‘You want me to come up there?’ I offered.

‘Well, no, well, perhaps …’ she replied vaguely. ‘Not much you could do though really, is there?’

She was probably right. ‘Maybe we should try calling him again?’ I suggested, rather feebly.

We did try, to no avail.

I shrugged. ‘OK, then maybe we should just wait for the landlord to get back to you.’

‘Do you think we should call the police,’ she said, slowly.

I fidgeted. ‘I don’t know.’

‘Well, we’re both concerned, right?’

‘Yea, I guess … ’ I didn’t know what I was feeling by this time, to be honest. Apart from VERY confused.

‘I just *know* that something’s wrong.’ 

I believed her, but still I wasn’t sure that even infallible girlfriend intuition was a sound basis for calling the police out. Besides they were bound to be busy with other shit on a Saturday night. So I started to look around for my car keys. ‘Sophie, I’m coming up there-‘

‘Wait – wait – I’ve got a call,’ she exclaimed suddenly.

My heart contracted. 

But it wasn’t Cody.

It was the landlord returning Sophie’s call, and the upshot was that, as she really did seem so concerned, and she was still officially one of his tenants, he arranged a check for that very night. However, an unforeseen delay prevented anyone from actually arriving at the apartment until nearly five in the morning, by which time Sophie had gone back to the place she was temporarily sharing with two girls from work. It turned out to be just as well, because what they found was – Well, let’s just say it furnished her, *and* me, with a good excuse not to go into work the next day.
