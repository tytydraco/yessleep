*Autopilot.*

Aware that you cannot move or think or breathe on your own. The words that spew from your lips are nothing more than senseless garbage to appease the masses watching your every move. 

You can't scream or cry or beg for mercy. 

All you can do is watch your [body](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/FjHaowB1fW), your mouth, your thoughts, be puppeteered by thousands of greedy, impatient eyes. 

It's like being dead, and *aware* I'm dead.

Dead, while my body dances, my mind is no longer mine. 

I smile a perfect smile. I don't notice the stitches holding me together. 

I'm not allowed to notice. 

So many layers of skin, flesh over flesh that is patchwork and does not belong to me. I am not allowed to think. I am not allowed to scream or cry, or tear into layer upon layer of Brianna Timberman’s sculpting me into beauty. 

Perfection. 

No thoughts, except one. 

That suffocates me, strangling my words from my throat.

And I am put into autopilot. 

I *am* Brianna Timberman. 

I *am* Brianna Timberman. 

I *am* Brianna Timberman. 

Felix was my latest three day fling. 

I was using him to make Sam jealous, but a drunken night had turned into another night, and suddenly it was Wednesday, and I was yet to leave his place. 

Fuck. 

He was supposed to be someone I could kick to the curb, someone to take out my frustration on. Now, Felix was more than a rebound. But even tangled in his bed, I couldn't stop thinking about Sam.

Sam Thwaites rejected me at seventeen years old, and had waltzed back into my life. As teenagers, I told him I loved him, and Sam got all flustered and started shaking his head, like I was something he didn't believe in. 

Sam said words like, “I didn't know you thought of me this way.” and “Wait, you liked me?” with this dumb fucking look on his face. He told me he *needed space*, and left me in the pouring rain. 

Five years later, he was standing in my parent’s lounge. 

I could still smell him on my skin, and I hated it. I hated him. 

“Bree!” Mom’s smile was wide. She and Dad were obsessed with finding me a *suitor*. 

“This is Samuel.”

Sam Thwaites took my hand, entwining his fingers with mine. He was so warm, and I hated that I wanted to fall into him. I hated that my heart was pounding through my chest. I had *already* seen him, bumping into him in the snow. 

I had *already* shamelessly fucked him in a stall without truly looking at him, angry and frustrated, and really, really, fucking hot. I wanted to tell him whatever he *wanted* to happen was over. I told him I hated him, curled against him, the two of us out of breath, my head against his chest, his head tipped back, half lidded eyes skimming across the ceiling. 

The two of us were sprawled out on ice cold tiles, his fingers stroking through my hair. I told him to *leave.* 

But there he was, standing in my parent’s house. In the exposed light, Sam was maturer in the face, losing his baby fat for more curvier, handsome features. Thick brown curls hung in playful eyes that wanted a challenge.

The slight curve in his lips told me everything I needed to know. Sam remembered our stupid childhood pact. 

I could hear it in his voice, the satisfaction dripping from his tone. 

*“Hello, Brianna.”*

I pulled him outside, straight into a downpour. 

“What are you *doing* here?” I demanded.

Sam shrugged with a smile. “We’re both adults, aren't we?”

I thought back to our childhood pact. If neither of us had found anyone by the age of twenty, we would marry each other. 

“You left me.” 

Sam stepped forward, grasping my hands. “I did.” He admitted, “But I was a stupid kid, Bree. I had no idea what I was talking about, and I was… scared.” 

“Scared?” 

He nodded, blinking rain out of his eyes.

“I was scared of losing you.”

I laughed incredulously. You *did* lose me, Sam! When you left me in the rain.”

“But I'm not scared anymore,” his voice was soft. He got closer. So close, I could see his breath. Sam kissed me tenderly, one hand cupping my cheek, the other sliding up my jacket. His mouth found my ear, something wet and warm oozing down my neck. 

*“Take… it.”* Sam’s voice was different, suddenly. 

*”Please.”*

Pulling away from the kiss, I shoved him back. 

“How much is my father paying you?” 

Sam swiped at his… *bloody?* lips, and a question sprung to mind. 

*Where did the blood come from?*

“Well?” I demanded, my voice collapsing into a sob. “Is my dad paying you or not? Is that why you came back?”

Sam didn't answer, his face crumpling. 

“Bree–”

“Save it!”

I left before he could fully open his mouth. 

Halfway down the road, I realized I was freezing cold. 

Before a shadow loomed, an umbrella shielding me. 

“You look like a drowned rat.” My colleague was next to me, avoiding my gaze. “Take this.” he turned away from me, curling his lip. “Do whatever you want with it, I don't care.” He twisted around, stuffing his hands in his pockets. 

The next day at work, I couldn't stop thinking about Sam. 

Felix, the lead singer of a local band, and a law student, was the perfect distraction. I met him in a bar. 

He was the Aussie trying to get a Dualingo streak, downing shots like soda. His accent was cute. It reminded me of water, or maybe that was just my drunken state. The cadence in his voice was like…trickling. 

I told him this, and he laughed. His suggestive wink took us to his apartment, and we spent the night together after I drunkenly told him I thought he was hot. I expected it to be just a one-time thing, but then we were having sex on his kitchen counter. 

I told him it wasn't serious. However, a one night stand had become more of a three day friends with benefits thing. 

Now, we were sitting outside my work drinking coffee, and I was starting to reconsider my initial stand on Australian Felix. 

There was something about the way he smiled with all of his teeth, nervously tapping his  coffee cup and occasionally losing himself completely, falling into a daydream mid-conversation. I liked it though. 

I liked watching his mind jet off into space. His longing gaze was adorable. 

Felix was sitting awkwardly, chin resting on his fist, talking about his favourite band, and I was enraptured by caramel colored eyes and the dimples in his cheeks. The sun was shining, and we were sitting under cherry blossoms I didn't remember seeing before. I was supposed to be working, and he had come to see me, armed with cupcakes and my favourite coffee. Dreamer Felix. 

Dimpled cheeks Felix. 

Felix with the trickly accent and slight lisp, who stumbled over his words and had a milk moustache I desperately wanted to wipe away. I did, leaning over the table and lightly brushing the curve of my finger across his upper lip.

“You've got a little…”

Felix’s eyes widened. He swiped at his mouth, chuckling. “Ah. That's… kinda embarrassing.”

A loud and overly exaggerated clearing of the throat made me jump. 

“Urgh. I think I just threw up in my mouth.”

Looming over me like a bad smell, was my colleague Jasper, scowling as usual. Standing with his arms crossed over his apron, he shot me a patronising smile, completely blanking Felix. 

The boy dumped my latte down, spilling half of it across the table. 

Behind him, a group of teenage girls were giggling. I wasn't surprised. 

Jasper really could pull off any look, and, just like the girls squealing over him, I couldn't resist handsome features and a killer jawline. It just sucked that he was one of the rudest people I had ever met.

He was wearing the exact same shirt from yesterday, his apron flung over the top, cropped blonde hair in disarray. Running his hair through it, he groaned. 

“You're supposed to be *workiiiing, Bree,*“ He said in a sing-song. Leaning across the table, Jasper’s patronising smile widened. “Are we *done* here?” 

I nodded. “Yeah. Sorry, Jasper.”

“You should be.” Jasper’s gaze flicked to Felix. ”You're a student, right?”

“Uh…” Felix nodded slowly. “Yeah? I guess.” 

My colleague shot him a sparkly grin. “Five percent off at the Crap ‘N Shack this weekend! Student discount! Alcohol served after 9pm will be free.”

“Woah, *really*?” Felix downed the rest of his drink, his eyes wide. 

I glanced at his cup. *I could have sworn he'd… finished it.* 

“What about parking?” Felix asked. “Will… I still get a ticket?”

“Nope!” Jasper shot him a grin, and a thumbs up. “Make sure to bring a student ID, and parking is free! It's *all* going down at the Crap ‘N Shack! This Saturday! With a Special guest, local music artist, Tiema Wright! Performing his new song, “I'm sorry I left you in the rain, but will you marry me?”

Both boys turned to me with matching smiles, speaking in sync. “Will *you* be there, Brianna?”

I nodded, with a grin. “You bet I will!” I saluted Felix with my drink. “Shouldn't you be heading to class?”

“I love you Jasper!” one of the girls squeaked from behind me. 

My colleague rolled his eyes, not even turning around to look at her. 

“I know you do.” Jasper sighed, pulling out his notepad and pen. 

He side-stepped to the next table, serving the people next to us. He licked his finger with exaggerated slowness, flipping the page. “But you're embarrassing yourself, sweetheart.”

“I'm free after work,” I said, “Maybe you could come back to my place?”

“You're on the late shift tonight with me, so *no* you're not free.” Jasper said behind me. When I twisted around to shoot him a look, he was tapping his pen on his notepad, mid-eyeroll. 

“No, sir, we don't do refills. Nope, I can't make an exception, and no,  complaining about it will just make me laugh.” 

“I'll text you.” I told Felix. 

“Sounds good.” He jumped up, finishing his coffee and grabbing his backpack. The Pikachu keyring on his zipper made me smile. “I have class, but I'll reply when I'm out, all right?”

Felix lifted his hand in a wave, took two steps back, and was crushed by a falling sheet of glass. 

I'm not sure *when* it was my mind stirred, and I regained consciousness for the fraction of a second. It was enough for my vision to clear, my senses coming back to the surface. 

The never ending script of words programmed into my brain stopped abruptly, and I was left suffocating on my own breaths.

I was awake. 

Awake, blinking at Felix’s body being peeled from concrete. 

*Awake.*

Awake enough to notice my colleague visibly flinched behind his notepad when Felix died. Awake enough to be able to breathe again, coerce words in my mind. 

I had zero idea of who I was before Brianna Timberman. Who was underneath flawless skin and manicures and sparkling teeth. My senses returned in waves. *Taste*. 

I had drank the same fucking coffee four times, and I could taste coffee grounds on my tongue. 

Smell. 

There were sweat patches staining my blouse. 

Touch. 

I could *feel* my coffee cup, running my finger around the rim. 

*I am not Brianna Timberman.* 

The thought slammed into me, and I felt my hands twitch by my sides, the overwhelming urge to tear off my skin, layer after layer until I found myself. 

When did I regain my free will? 

Maybe it was when Felix’s blood was seeping across my shoes, his body an unrecognisable mess of stringy flesh and lumps under splinters of glass sparkling like diamonds across the sidewalk. 

It took me half a second to realize a woman was screaming in my face. 

“Oh my god, sweetie, are you okay?” 

*Autopilot*. 

I nodded shakily, words already tumbling out of my mouth. 

“I'm fine.”

“Was he your boyfriend?”

*Autopilot.*

“No.” 

For some reason, my eyes found Jasper still hiding behind his notebook. 

“He wasn't.”

No matter how hard I tried to fight it, Brianna’s feelings were already swamping me. I felt my cheeks heat up, my stomach fluttering. Before *autopilot* thoughts could spring out of nowhere, I remembered my colleague’s reaction to Felix’s death, as well as him subtly trying to stop me from talking to Sam. 

There was zero doubt in my mind that Jasper didn't know what was going on. 

If the rest of us were recycled lumps of skin, what was he? He was a love interest, but he *wasn't* one of Bree’s exes. 

Sam explained my colleague was a curveball. 

The so-called *bad-boy* playing with Brianna Timberman feelings. 

With little to no thoughts of my own, I stated the facts in my head. 

My life wasn't real. I was nothing but recycled flesh sculpted and moulded into a dead prom queen with her memories. That thought still had not sunk in yet, and when I started to register it, all I wanted to do was peel my skin from my bones until I found myself. 

Who I was, hiding under patchwork flesh. 

So many Brianna’s stitched onto me. So many lost souls. 

I had been on autopilot for days. All that I had left when I came to, was a vague memory of every other death. 

Ben, Alex, and Esme. 

*Car crash.*

*Suicide.*

*Carbon monoxide poisoning.*

Now Felix. 

Crushed to death. 

Each of their deaths had been voted m by the townspeople. 

It was only a matter of time before Felix would be erased from existence too. 

Sam, or the boy underneath him, had shown me who I really was, a lump of flesh sculpted into Brianna Timberman. 

Sam had the same fate. 

He showed me where he came from, a factory that had turned the entire town's teen populace into the exact same four faces. 

Brianna Timberman’s exes. 

Ben, Alex, Esme, and Sam. 

First, he was an Alex, then a Ben, and *then* an extra, who tried to warm me, before being abruptly converted into Sam Thwaites, a brand new love interest, and Brianna’s childhood friend. 

Sam told me Brianna’s exes deaths were a joke, her love life controlled by the town through a popularity poll. 

Brianna had committed suicide years ago, but the town were obsessed. 

They wanted to watch her life. They *wanted* to see which person she would choose, voting for their favourites while dooming the loser to a fate worse than death. The least popular love interest would die brutally, and the cycle would continue. In this case, it was Felix. 

The boy suppressed under Sam had shown me the truth, only to be captured and turned into one of my parent’s suitors. The realization was like a kick in the face. I was alone. Awake and aware of too-bright lights on my face, and unable to cry out or scream. 

Brianna Timberman was dead, but according to the town, the show must go on.

Staying very still, I was suddenly well aware of patrons on their phone. 

I glanced at a teenage girl, who was rapidly swiping *right* on an image of my colleague, while a man holding a briefcase lazily swiped left on Sam. 

“Your boyfriend should have been more careful.”

I blinked. 

Jasper was in front of me, arms folded across his apron. 

Sam talked about a *Red Zone* in the bathroom stalls a few days ago. 

He said it was where *they* couldn't see us, and I would be fully conscious, severed from whatever was in my head. 

Jasper waved his hand in front of my face, and it suddenly occurred to me that if I wanted answers, such as where the Red Zone was located, I needed my colleague’s help. 

Whether he was awake or *not.*

Brianna Timberman was in full control of my mind, however, so regaining free will was getting progressively harder. 

Two days later, after being stuck on autopilot, I was serving a woman trying to calm her screaming kid. 

Felix didn't have a funeral, and his name was already forgotten. In my half awake state though, I remembered him. 

I had since met two people. 

Adrianna, who was a quick make out in a bathroom stall. 

She smelled just like Esme. Roses and cheap perfume. 

Ren. The older college professor who I drunkenly kissed in the back of an Uber. 

I can't pinpoint the times when I was fully awake. 

Fully *in control*. 

I was perfecting a foam heart on a customer's latte, when I realized I really wanted to fuck my colleague. The thought was explosive, immediately setting my cheeks on fire. Trying to suppress it was fighting a losing battle. 

“Hey.” Jasper sided in front of me, tearing me out of my thoughts. Or Brianna’s thoughts. I had spent the last hour dazedly staring at his wonderfully sculpted jawline, unable to look at anything else. 

Brianna liked to fantasise, and her mind wasn't exactly PG13. 

It's not like I had control of my mouth. Autopilot meant my body and mind worked for me. I was just lucky to be conscious– or at least semi-conscious. 

I had a semblance of a plan, and the first part was finding Sam Thwaites. Or the boy *sculpted into* Sam. The last time I saw him before I went on autopilot, I had no idea if he was awake or just a really good fucking performer. 

*The Red Zone* was all I could think of. 

If I wanted out of this nightmare, I needed to find it.

However, thinking is kind of hard when all I can think about was my colleague’s biceps. 

I couldn't take my eyes off of the way he swung a carton of milk, mid-conversation with our manager. 

Jasper caught my eye, scowling. 

“Bree. Get your fucking head out of the clouds.”

My colleague’s tone was so shamelessly unapologetic, a group of girls in the queue burst into giggles. The guy was like a circus attraction. 

Now that I had a semblance of actual thought, I realized our only customers were women, with the odd man every blue moon. Jasper cleared his throat, setting the milk down.

“Okay, look, I’m sorry your boyfriend got *flattened*, or whatever, but you need to stop moping around like someone freakin’ *died*.”

*Autopilot*. 

There was a bright light suddenly. 

I shoved him. Hard. 

“Why do you always have to be such a dick?”

Jasper was unfazed. He didn't even stumble. I felt it, a shiver creeping down my spine, an insatiable need clouding my thought process. 

Brianna Timberman was hot. Very hot. Jasper’s attitude, his movement, everything about him and being so close to him, was making her flustered. 

She was sweating under her apron, and all she could look at, all she could focus on, was her colleague. Who was, against all  odds, *still* playing hard to get. 

All around us, patrons went silent. 

The girls in the queue started nudging each other. My colleague stepped forward, his breath tickling my face. 

He was a little *too* close. “I should be asking you the same thing,” he murmured, lips twitching into a smirk. 

“You've been staring at me all morning.” Jasper stepped closer, backing me into the counter. I could feel my cheeks getting hotter and hotter, my thoughts clouding.

Another step, and we were nose to nose. 

Jasper cocked his head. “Do I…have something on my face, Bree?”

It took every morsel of self control to turn away from him, back to the queue. 

I smiled widely at the customer, making lattes and coffees. But my stomach was dancing, my mind foggy and distant. 

It didn't help that every time Jasper shoved past me, he made it intentional, and the friction of his body against mine, his hands brushing my waist, was driving me crazy. Sam mentioned aphrodisiacs being pumped through the vent in the bathroom stalls to influence intimacy between Brianna and her love interests. 

I had a feeling that is what was happening. Still, though, when I peeked at the ceiling, I couldn't see a vent.

I couldn't *stop* my own wandering hands every time he passed me. 

It was a game, in a way. 

Who would crack first. 

I was in the break room trying to cool myself off, when Jasper stepped in front of me. 

“Vegan milk.” He said. Despite acting cool and collected, maintaining his asshole smirk, I glimpsed a noticeable red blush spreading across his cheeks. 

His lips found my ear. “Can you… lhelp me find it?”

*Autopilot*. 

Autopilot had taken us into the dark. My body and emotions and feelings were no longer mine, choking, drowning, in fog that contorted me into exactly what these people wanted. 

I'm not sure how I got from the break room to the storage closet, pinned against a shelf, half naked, my legs wrapped around my colleague. He started, of course, with his mouth latched to my ear, muttering about Mulberry Milk offers, before his lips found mine. 

His breath was heavy, his hands finding my waist, and sliding up my shirt. 

God, I pretended a lot of things weren't happening for the sake of not losing my fucking mind. 

I pretended I couldn't hear the wolf whistles and squeals rumbling in the walls surrounding us, that the pleasure riding through me was mine, and not *theirs*. We had an audience. 

Somehow, that was even worse than my body being used to satisfy others. 

I pretended I wasn't fully exposed, and even worse, that I *wanted* it. 

I wanted to get closer to him, pressing my mouth into his clammy neck and burying my face in his shoulder. 

I *wanted* him to continue, his lips in my hair. 

Tipping my head back, my vision was blurring. 

But I could see it.

Right above our heads, there was the vent pumping us full of aphrodisiacs.

*Sex drugs,* I thought dizzily. 

I laughed, and it was so out of character, Jasper pulled away for a moment, brows knotting in confusion. 

“The Red Zone.” I managed to grit out through Brianna Timberman’s mouth. “Where is it?”

When he didn't respond, I grabbed the back of his head, forcing him to look at me. Under the dim light of a flickering bulb, my colleague’s eyes were half lidded, his pupils dilated pools of confusing black. I had no doubt he hadn't been heavily drugged. 

Jasper kissed me deeply again, and when I managed to shove him away, he tightened his grip on my waist, pressing his face into my shoulder. 

“The Red Zone.” I repeated, my thoughts reduced to soup. 

I only had a certain amount of time, and that *time* was running out. 

I shoved him again. This time, I felt filthy. 

His clammy hands all over my skin was like poison.

I felt suffocated, every time he leaned in.  

The worst part is that this man had zero choice either. 

The thought struck, sending violent tremors through me. 

How many *times* had my corpse of a body been used like this? 

How many *times* had I been fucked, or fucked someone else for this town’s sickening satisfaction obsession with Brianna Timberman? 

“Tell me where it is!” I said through a shriek. 

Jasper slowly started to respond, blinking rapidly. “The… wha?”

He was a good performer, awake or not. 

“You knew what was going on when your friends dragged Sam away.” 

I kept my voice low, kissing him harder to keep the narrative going. Especially when I could hear the dull sound of pounding feet. These freaks *wanted* us to fuck. 

I made sure to let my mouth linger on his, aware of every inch of the two of us being watched, analysed, probably photographed and posted to the town website. “I saw you flinch when Felix died. Which means you were awake.” 

I pulled away, slowly, playing with the collar of his shirt. But at the same time, I was looking for every possible escape route. Sam was right. To my left, I could see a subtle red light dancing across Jasper’s jaw. 

And to my left, another skimming across my neck. 

So, I grabbed the boy, shoving him against the shelf, switching our positions. 

“You tracked me down that day,” I spoke softly, pretending to bury my head in his chest. “You knew exactly where I was. And you took Sam away. So, you know exactly where the Red Zone is. You know where he was hiding.”

Jasper surprised me with a chuckle. When I lifted my gaze, my vision was fuzzy, my body hot and flustered, and yet I was shivering. His head was tipped back, lazy eyes tracking the ceiling. He was following the exact same red light. 

“You're a funny girl, Bree.” He murmured. My colleague leaned forward, keeping up the facade for our unseen audience. He was doing exactly what they wanted, the curve of his back almost *too* perfectly lit up. 

It was *exactly* what Brianna Timberman had fantasised. 

Jasper’s panting breaths found my ear. “Keep talking, though? You're going to fuck *both* of us over.”

His words sent shivers trickling down my spine. 

In the corner of my eye, the red light was visible. If the room was too dark, that meant they were tracking and filming our movements. I didn't think. 

Grabbing my colleague’s shoulders, I yanked him to his knees, dropping with him. Risking a glance behind us, the light was gone. Which meant (or at least I hoped) that we were out of shot. 

Jasper regarded me lazily, inclining his head. “What are you–” 

I slammed my hand over his mouth, cutting him off.

“The Red Zone. You know exactly where it is.” I hissed, tightening my grip on his shoulder. When he played stupid, I dug my fingernails in. “You're not an ex,” I said, “So, what *are* you?” 

“Jasper?” my colleague muffled under my hand, pointing to his name tag. When I removed my hand, his lips spread out into a grin. But I caught his eyes frantically searching for those red lights. 

“I have *no* idea what you're talking about, Bree!” He raised his voice significantly, “But… did you know vegan milk is made with only the *best* pasteurised milk from Mulberry Farms?”

This guy wasn't going to sing, so I had to get creative. 

Above us, three red lights were scanning the dark. 

They were looking for us. 

“Please.” I whispered, searching his eyes for a *hint* of a human being. 

“You're as much of a victim as me, right? Don't you want *out* of here?!”

Jasper responded with his signature eyeroll, maintining that plastic fucking grin.  

“I… have zero idea what you’re talking about! But do you know what I really want to talk about? Mulberry Farms milk!”

I couldn't stop myself. Maybe it was frustration, desperation, or a mix of both. I wasn't fully thinking *straight* when I grasped the back of his head, and slammed Jasper’s skull into the metal edge of the shelf. I regretted it immediately when the guy’s eyes rolled to pearly whites, his body going limp in my arms, head lolling onto his shoulder. 

When a single rivulet of red slid from his nose, I realized he *was* like Sam. 

Sam, who must have given himself a head injury to wake himself up. 

A *severing*. 

Under the influence of the narrative, as well as aphrodisiacs choking my thoughts into arousal, I never really *saw* my colleague’s body. I only saw what Brianna wanted to see. Lean muscles and a perfectly sculpted v-line. 

But now, away from the cameras, and in the fading light of a dying bulb, I saw them, running my trembling fingers over rugged stitched and patchwork skin moulding this boy, and so many others, into the *perfect* man. 

I could see where parts of him had been replaced and cut away, his entire face airbrushed into a viewer’s fantasy. 

But looking closer, his real eyes were mismatched contortions of blue and brown. 

I waited for the sarcastic eye roll and immediate plug-in advertisement. 

Instead, though, the man's expression was… softer. 

He looked dazed, confused, blinking rapidly. 

But, as he slowly drank in his surroundings, his expression started to twist into fear. Pain. *Anger*. 

Anger that was so vast, so overwhelming, that he dropped to his knees, scrubbing at his face. I didn't know what to say. *Sorry* didn't mean anything. Sam was gentle when he told me I was recycled skin, nothing but a flesh puppet for a psychotic town. 

But I didn't give him a chance to take it in. I plunged him directly into this cruel, horrifying reality. 

Jasper’s frenzied gaze went to his hands, and then his hands were in his hair, clawing down his face. 

His lips parted like he was going to speak, but I don't think he *could*. 

Jasper’s eyes filled with frustrated tears. Terror that was something I could relate to, an existential dread and confusion and pain that was tearing him apart. I knew the questions at the back of his head. 

Why me? Why was this happening to me? How can I be alive? How can I be *real* when the rest of me is nothing? 

I felt my own fingers trace the scars across my own stomach. 

Scars that only I could feel, deeply indented into my skin. 

Skin that I wanted to rip into, to tear away. 

Because… I was somewhere, right? 

Underneath all of this, my old self was *there*. 

I fucking HAD to be because I can't just be THIS. 

Jasper stumbled back, clumsy on his feet, embarrassed and confused, trying to hide himself. When blood started seeping freely from his nose and down his chin, I found my voice. “Hey.” 

I spoke softly, and his eyes finally found mine, resembling a startled deer.

“Can you tell me who you are?”

I swallowed thick slime creeping into my mouth. 

“Who you *were*?”
 
For a sobering moment, it was just the two of us. 

Not Brianna and Jasper. 

His eyes found mine, truly drinking me in. 

And something sparked in his expression. Recognition, or familiarity. 

His hands cupped my face, fingers running down my cheeks. 

The man was mute, speechless, and yet somehow, he was crying. 

Crying for me. 

A stranger. 

Somehow, though, my hands, or at least part of my hand, the stitched and rugged parts of me, responded to his touch. 

“Bree? Jasper?”

When the door flew open, I jumped to my feet, pulling the boy with me. 

They were paranoid, I thought, mirroring Sam’s earlier words. 

The town was making sure we were still satisfying them. 

To my surprise, Jasper’s eyes dilated back to brown. 

“Uh,” His voice was choked up, more of a growl, “Give us a sec, all right?”

*Autopilot*. 

I bent down and grabbed my shirt, throwing it on. 

Jasper buttoned up his own, brushing himself down. 

He stepped back, winking.

“Same time tomorrow?”

*Autopilot*. 

Brianna didn't speak. Instead, she headed towards the door. 

She wanted him to chase after her for more. 

But not before Jasper came close, hissing in my ear. 

“You want to go on a suicide mission? Fine.” I was already pulling away, or Brianna was pulling away, because my body was being forced forwards. 

Still, he held me, tightening his grip. “The thrift store across the street. Stall three, in the bathroom.” He said. “Just, please,” Jasper’s tone softened.

“*Please* never fucking do that to me again.”

So, I had a location. 

The problem was actually *getting* to it. 

*Autopilot.*

It was stronger, forcing me onto the stage. 

I spilled coffee over a customer, and of course, Jasper came to the rescue. 

When I dropped a tray full of drinks, slipping on someone's mess, his arms were already wrapped around me, catching me before I could hit the ground.

When our eyes met, Brianna Timberman’s heart fluttered. 

The people surrounding us were already swiping right on their phones.

Jasper helped me stand up. “You… should be more careful, you idiot.” He grumbled.

I nodded, straightening up. 

Jasper leaned against the refrigerator. “Do you know Sam Thwaites?”

I didn't look up from making coffee. “Yeah. He was…” 

I blinked away memories of the two of us as kids. 

“Just a friend.”

“He's bad news.” Jasper said. “The guy is working for your dad.” 

“That's not… that's not true.” 

“Oh, really?” He stepped in front of me, head tiled to the side. “So, he just came back into your life for *no* reason?”

“I  don't want to talk about Sam.” 

“But… Did he leave you anything?” Jasper murmured. “Like a… I don't know, a parting gift, maybe?”

Before I could reply, my colleague blurted, “What were you wearing when we were… “ He looked around nervously. “Looking for vegan milk?”

“I… don't know?” I prodded at my apron. “This, I guess? Why?”

“Oh, no reason!” he winked at me. “Did you know my Aunt died recently?”

“No…” 

“Well, her funeral was all sorted within a matter of days,” Jasper continued, speaking through that same grin.

“Callister Funeral Care really did give me the comfort me and my family needed while we were in mourning…”

*Autopilot*.

I woke up halfway through my shift the next day, in the middle of serving three boys. 

Immediately, I dropped what I was doing, darting to the door.

“I'm going on my break!” I yelled, grabbing my jacket and pushing through a group of girls. The town thrift store was empty. I was pushing through the door when a girl pushed past me, hard enough to knock my jacket out of my hands. When I scooped it up, something dropped out of my pocket.

Inside was a single black disk-shaped thing. I stuck the plastic down my bra. 

“Bree? What are you doing here?”

Lifting my head, my colleague was standing over me. 

Jasper’s smile was a little too big.

When he helped me up, his voice was a sharp breath. “How exactly are you planning on getting in the *men’s* bathroom, genius?”

I had a way. 

But neither of us were going to like it. 

Autopilot, however, did my job for me. I was in a bathroom stall on my knees, when reality hit, and I shook my head of fog. Jasper was already pulling me to my feet. Pressing his index over his lips and motioning for me to be quiet, he pointed above our head. Instead of a window, there was a hatch. “Red Zone Two.” He mouthed. "Fucking *go*!

I nodded, climbing onto the toilet bowl, throwing myself through the hatch. 

This time, I felt directly into a pile of still-wet and *still warm* bodies. 

But these weren't Alex’s or Ben’s, or Sam’s. 

My own face, my perfectly moulded and sculpted Barbie doll face stared back at me. Brianna Timberman was everywhere. Her glazed blue eyes and wide smile were suffocating me. It when I stood up, did I start to see *patches*. I saw skin and hair, torn and stained clothes with body parts still attached to them. Different faces. 

Girls. 

Beautiful girls with their heads severed, their bodies reduced to mutilated flesh. 

Smiles stretched into skeletal grimaces, and eyes scooped from the sockets.

As if I felt connection with the doll pieces around me, I started to claw at my legs. 

Like I could find my own skin, revel in it. 

I stood up, at the sound of a mechanical whirring. In front of me was a blood stained conveyer belt that wasn't moving, that was frozen. Just like the room with Sam’s, Ben's, Alex's, and Esme’s. I felt my fingernails rip into my arms, and my face. My gaze was glued to the cutoffs, the human bodies scattering metal flooring. Is this what I was? 

I ripped into the skin of my face until I felt the sting. 

But there was no fucking blood. Nothing to remind me I was human. 

“Bree. You need to get out of here. Now.”

I was barely aware Jasper had joined me. He fished up my jacket. 

“What are you?” I asked him, my voice shuddering. 

“Wrong.” 

His response surprised me. “Which is why they're going to kill me off soon, and I'll die the way I was supposed to.”

Jasper’s words collapsed into white noise. 

Instead, I was someplace else, a memory splintering into *dozens* of memories.

I was… Clara. 

Jamie. 

Lily. 

Kiera.

Becca.

Elizabeth. 

I was running. 

Screaming. 

A guy was in front of me, tugging my hand. 

*“The far gate is the exit!”* The voice in front was female. 

“If we reach it, we’ll get out of here. Just *keep* running.”

A sharp flash, and I was standing stiff. Upright. 

I was moving, a long line of girls in front of me. 

I *felt* them, writhing, entangled around my bones. 

Every girl I was made out of. 

The cruel needle plunging into the back of her neck, instantly killing her. 

A second needle injecting a solution that kept the *body* alive.

Her thoughts and feelings and sensations.

All of it was kept alive. 

Conscious. 

The whirring blades coming down and skinning away her face, her eyes, her lips, her screams falling on deaf ears. 

Her sculpted body, naked and raw, was shoved forwards. 

The next metal arms made sure to stitch up loose skin, adding and removing and slicing away what was no longer needed, adding a metal exoskeleton to assure no damage. Then came clothes, a yellow summer dress, exactly what she was wearing on the day Sam Thwaites dumped her in the rain. The final metal arm was more of a brush, a thing scraping across the face to make sure Brianna was *perfect*. 

When she tumbled off of the conveyor belt, smiling widely, I wasn't Clara, or Jamie, or Lily… 

Fuck.

I *was* Brianna Timberman. 

Standing at the end of the line, with his arms folded, was Brianna’s father. 

His smile was proud, eyes glinting with madness. 

He stroked my face, eyes filling with tears. 

“*She's perfect.*”

The memory shattered, coming apart, when something pricked my neck. There was a blinding white light on me. 

“We’ve got her, sir.” 

A muffled cry, and I could *just* see Jasper being wrenched back. 

“Hey! I did what you told me to do! The pocket is empty!” his voice deepened into a growl. “Let me go!”

The figure who grabbed him seemed to enjoy his discomfort. She had wandering hands.  “Five more seasons, pretty boy.” The woman hummed. “Brianna may have forgiven you, but your debt is with Mr Timberman.”

“Wait! No, we had a fucking deal you piece of– *mmppphmmh*!”

I was forced onto my stomach. “AND the love interest who appears to be faulty. It's the tracer who was supposed to be following her.” The voice swam in and out, as my mind plunged. *“Yes. I'll get him remodelled immediately. Uh-huh. Brianna is A-okay, sir. Do you have my permission to proceed?”

**Autopilot**.

This time it was deep, dragging me to impossible depths. 

“Brianna!” 

Mom’s voice snapped me back to half-fruition. 

I was standing in my parent’s hallway in front of Sam. 

Sam, who had lowered himself to one knee, a ring pinched between his fingers.. 

“Say yes!” Mom stood behind me, standing with my brother. 

*Autopilot.*

My lips spread into a smile. 

Two bright lights on the two of us. 

“Yes.” I whispered, when he wrapped his arms around me. “I'll marry you.”

The walls around us were ooh-ing and ahh-ing. 

When the lights switched off, and Sam’s smile stayed plastic and taut, I realized the boy underneath was *gone*. 

But it was when his head was in my chest, did I remember his earlier words. 

*“Please. Take it.”*

*Autopilot*.

The day skipped forward. 

I was only aware of my mother’s hands tangled in my hair. 

She was dragging me down the hallway. 

“Don't worry Brianna!” She said gleefully, tightening her hold.

“No daughter of mine is this much of a nuisance, and the show *must* go on!”

I was shoved into a room, on autopilot. 

But, after regaining myself, I can break myself out of autopilot. 

The medic came to see me.

According to her, I'm *slightly* severed. 

They're going to fix me. Like what they did to Sam. 

Look, it's been three hours and I've been thinking about a lot of things. I know you can't save me. I live in the blip of a town, a town you can't find on a Google search. I know I'm a prisoner. 

But I think I know how to save myself and the others. 

Mainly. I want to cut Brianna Timberman away, and look underneath. 

But I'm terrified that under all of these layers? They're will be nothing left. 

I've already done most of it. Right now, half of my face is caught under my nails. 

But I'm not

Fuck

I can't find me??? 

Im not bleeding, I can't see anything that looks like ME and when they come back they're going to patch me back up. 

They'll stick someone else's flesh over me, and call me Brianna. 

But I'm not Brianna????? 

I'm not any of those girls, so who am I? 

pleaee fucking help me find myself I'm begging you
