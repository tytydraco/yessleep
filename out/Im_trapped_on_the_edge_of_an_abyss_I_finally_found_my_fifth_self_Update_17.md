My mom dying did something to me.

In case my ramblings and anecdotes about how I became a shit person weren’t enough to illustrate that, there it is, spelled out in plain letters. Something broke inside me once I knew I had lost her. When she spoke to me for a final time, fell asleep, and I realized she wasn’t going to wake back up.

It was the struggle of it all, I think. Watching her go through years of attempted recovery only to continuously crumble the more she pushed herself to the finish line. Seeing how much pain she put herself through to stay in this world for us, just for it all to end in tragedy anyway.

Years of pain spent in vain.

Hundreds of thousands of dollars in hospital bills, all for nothing.

The quilt of hope that she, Dad and I had crafted together, lay torn and tattered at the end of it all from all the cutting words of doctors.

*‘I’ve got some bad news…’*

*‘I’m afraid it’s not looking good…’*

*‘I’m sorry to tell you, but…’*

I loved my mother for attempting to recover for our sakes. It makes my heart ache to know that halfway through her treatment, she knew it was almost pointless. She knew that it was only going to end one way. Still, she pushed on because Dad and I wouldn’t let her give up. We wanted her to stay so badly that we tied her to a bed with plastic tubes and gown sashes just to keep her a little longer.

I had already become a different person in that rock tumbler that was desperation. It was the snapback of losing her though that finally smashed the shell away and spit out a new Hensley.

It’s almost fitting that I ended up somewhere where I wretched up other versions of myself, because the Hensley before my mother died compared to after was nowhere near the same one. In a way, I myself was a clone. The disparaged, sorry flesh that young Hensley hacked out. Hope may have been before I knew of my mom’s illness, June during, and Ann right at her end, but even when I was the latter of them all (and my worse self), she didn’t compare to who came after.

Even now, so many years later, I don’t know who she was; a stranger in my own body. Then again, we didn’t get much time to know each other. I was too busy fogging my brain over with liquor and letting her run wild.

I spoke a little about my years at The Warehouse in my old town. The small college town club haphazardly strewn up in an old storage building. I made it clear then that I wasn’t exactly in the best habits, but I don’t know if I accurately illustrated just how bad it all was.

I barely even remember those years. It’s all just a blur of intoxication and hangovers. Maybe that’s more me choosing not to remember, though.

I had to stay numb. I had to not feel. The years following my mom's death through high school was hell. Dad and I were going through it on top of him struggling to keep us afloat in finances. I started working after school just to help support us, and while it wasn’t enough to really even put a dent in what we needed for bills and rent, it at least kept us fed.

Eventually, things stabilized. We got back on our feet, but that was only in the physical world. In the mental, we were still just two survivors wandering a ruined wasteland that was the earth. It didn’t feel the same without her. Everything was dull and imperfect. Nothing felt whole. Any joy always came with a hollow caveat in my gut. Sadness was amplified by it lingering in the shadows.

I was almost mute until I graduated. Dad was the only person I had the energy to talk to. He somehow still, even after every soul-crushing defeat, kept his smile for me. I tried to do the same for him, but it never lasted past the doorframe of my bedroom. I had no friends since I was working all the time outside of school, and in school was the only time I had to sit in silence and sort my thoughts, not that they ever helped.

I guess I’m just rambling at this point. Woe is me, right? The point is that after all those years of having to sit and fester on my emotions with no solace, the moment I went out to college, I found my way out.

Alcohol was easy to get, even underage. The bouncers were barely above college age themselves, which meant they didn’t give much of a damn when it came to letting me in with the right connections, and past that, the cops in the area already knew the young debauchery was going to happen in a college town, so rare was the night that they’d actually crack down on it.

My first time getting drunk was therapeutic. The pleasant haze in my brain. The loud music of the bar drowning out any distant whispers that tried to bleed in. The mass of people surrounding my every side, all dancing and moving against me. We were all there for different reasons, but in our drunken states, we were one, and I finally stopped feeling so alone.

It was usually a different group every night. A different person that I’d latch onto and dance the night away with. I found out that if I picked the right people, I wouldn’t even have to pay for my drinks most of the time, which made them my go-to ‘friends’. The ones that could keep me nice and plastered all while giving me the comfort I needed.

Eventually that began to turn into sex. More hazy, cheap dopamine to fill my head with. I don’t even remember when it began, really. What night I decided to give it a try. The most fucked up part though is that I don’t even remember who it was with. That was the case for most of them. They were faces that came and went as fast as days and nights.

I remember small details that broke through the clouds now and then. Some moments in the heat. Some times with especially passionate ones. The kind that would sense my pain and try to dig a little deeper. Maybe it was to try and fix me. Maybe it was just out of curiosity. Either way, it never mattered. I never gave them the chance. They were the type I wanted far from me, not kicking up the dust that I’d let so perfectly settle, so the next night, I’d find someone new.

I tried not to feel bad when I’d see their wounded faces again through the club crowds when I danced with somebody else. It’s the kind of memory that keeps me up at night with shame. I often wonder how many ‘Trevor’s’ I passed over in that time. How many good-hearted people I let down. It’s probably all for the best, anyway. They deserved much better than me.

Around that time, my anger got real bad too. Addiction can do that to your brain. Make you irritable and irrational. Pair that with all of my unresolved bitterness, and you have the perfect powder keg to make me go off at the slightest upset. I don’t know how anyone tolerated being around me, if I’m being honest. Most of the things my brain bothered to remember from that dreary period of my life was shameful moments of lashing out.

There was one time, I remember, that there were two girls near me as I stumbled off toward the bathroom one night. Pretty sorority types that I’d never seen before. I must have really been looking like shit for them to feel the need to say something.

I don’t recall exactly what they said, but one of them pointed me out to her friend and commented about how she’d seen me in this state every time she’d come here for the past few weeks. Her friend must have known me better, cause she told her that I practically lived here. That I was a disgusting, drunken slut that slept with anyone I could or something like that. She was right, but that still didn’t stop me from whirling on my heels and smacking that dirty look off her pretty little face.

Looking back now, I wonder if I even heard her right at all…

The cops came for that one. I got pulled out by the bouncers and arrested. Luckily, I was over 21 at that point, so I was safe from those charges, but the assault was a whole other story. Dad drove up to my college that night and bailed me out after a few hours of me sitting in a campus jail cell. The girl who I’d hit had her parents there at that point too, and dad made me go wait in his truck while he talked to them.

I don’t know how on earth he did it, but he somehow convinced them, and the girl I’d struck not to press charges. Maybe it had to do with her being too young to be in that bar at the time, and the complications of the situation were just too much, or maybe it was because the girl simply had more compassion than I did after she heard the story that Dad had to say…

The worst part, though? I found out that the reason she was acting so spiteful to me to begin with was because her ex had cheated on her with me the term prior.

Maybe if I hadn’t been so drunk, I would have thought to ask him if he was single. He was another night I didn’t even remember, by the way. In case you were wondering.

Dad came slowly out to the truck looking down at the asphalt, his breath pressing against the cold air in long, cloudy puffs. His hands were tucked in his jacket pockets, and his form was slouched and tired. So tired…

The door creaked along with his bones as he climbed into the vehicle, and he didn’t say anything for a long time. It was that lack of anything that broke me down into tears. Silent, weeping tears. I pulled my legs onto the seat with me and hugged them, to which he leaned over and pulled me across the bench into his arms. It felt good to be there. Warm in an actual loving embrace.

“Do you need to come home, Henny?” he asked into my scalp. “You could come stay with me for a bit. Take a break year and readjust yourself.”

I couldn’t do that to him. Take up space and put more on his plate. He was still dealing with the fallout of Mom all these years later, and I wasn’t going to give him another mouth to feed.

At least, that’s what I told myself. Deep down I knew he wanted me home because he missed me. Because I was all that he had. I was being selfish, though. His idea was good; I should have gone home and confronted what I’d left behind there. I couldn’t though. There was no Warehouse back home, and The Warehouse was what made all the pain go away.

I sniffled and shook my head, “No—no, I’m fine. I’m okay, Dad—It was just a bad night is all.”

It was a lie that I’m sure he saw straight through, but still he just nodded and squeezed me tighter.

“I’m sorry to make you drive all the way out here,” I told him, “And to cause you so much trouble.”

Dad let out a loose snicker, “You’re no trouble, Henny. Only to yourself. If you ever need anything, you can call me, okay? I don’t care what it is, you can call.”

“I know, Dad. Thank you.” I muttered, wiping my tears on his sleeve and hugging his arm tighter. I wish I would have taken that to heart the day I got my diagnosis. I wish I would have just told him myself so that he didn’t have to find out through Trevor long after I skipped town.

“You promise me that you’re okay? This isn’t going to happen again?”

“I promise, Dad,” I told him.

“Good. And promise me you’ll find some way to apologize to that girl? I know she said some dirty things, but she’s young and going through it too.”

I felt an ache in my chest, then nodded, “Yeah… Yeah I’ll talk to her.”

“Good.” Dad nodded.

“What did you tell them? Are they not pressing charges?”

Dad didn’t answer. He just kissed my head and whispered, “Don’t worry about it, Henny. You just make your wrongs right. I’ll keep you safe from everything else.”

I promised my dad that night that it was a one-time thing, and to be fair, I never lashed out like that again. Though, I don’t think that was what he was talking about. He wasn’t stupid; he knew that wasn’t the only night I’d gotten a little too carried away with bad habits. In that sense, I broke my promise the very next weekend.

The bouncers and bartenders that I’d made friends with at The Warehouse gave me a strict warning, let me back in, and I was back to it before 8pm.

For a moment, though, that night in the parking lot with Dad, I was in the eye of the storm. A moment broken through the chaos where I could look around clearly and see the raging thunder around me. For only a moment, I was my old self again. I was June. I was Hope. I was even Ann.

But then I slipped back under into Hensley 5.  

The version of me from the warehouse was already a clone of myself that I wouldn’t want to meet. But standing in the road and looking down at the spider torn out from the inside, that precedent became more apparent. Even if she was fully grown in that thing's stomach, she would have the same strength as me, and I certainly wasn’t powerful enough to tear through a ribcage and muscle to claw my way out. Something was very wrong.

The sound of footsteps filled the air next to me, but I wasn’t afraid. I recognized the soft sound of June’s boots on asphalt by now. She cautiously moved next to me and stared down with just as much horror as me.

“What… What happened to it?”

I didn’t answer, but I didn’t have to. She figured it out on her own.

“Was this… the other Hensley?”

I nodded slowly, “I think so.”

June lifted her head from the body and eyed the trail of bloody black footprints leading off into the neighborhoods. Eventually, I did the same, and after following them, it was clear where they were heading. Even above the buildings and houses, the lights and sounds from The Warehouse were a beacon in the night.

June turned to me, and I looked back at her, the matter at hand going on hold for a moment as she spoke.

“I’m, um, going to come with you… if that’s okay…”

I opened my mouth to say something, but shame stuffed my throat, already feeling bad about what I’d said to her back at the tower. June was all I had left now, and the fact that I’d thrown it back in her face like it was some sort of bad thing was a more than shitty thing to do.

“Of course,” I nodded, finally mustering the words, “I’d appreciate that.”

An apology began brewing in the back of my stubborn throat as I looked at her, and she gave a shy smile that lasted only a few moments. I waited too long, though, and June didn’t like the uncomfortable silence, still clearly affected by my harsh words, so she just turned away from me and began following the black ichor down the street.

There was nothing stopping me from calling out, or telling her as we walked, but for some reason the words stayed tucked in my chest, the flame of their courage snuffed by June’s abrupt departure. I kept my mouth shut and followed after her.

It didn’t take long for her sudden bravery to wear off and her pace to slow, allowing me to catch up, then pass her by a few feet. I didn’t even check the tower as we moved, knowing that the next time the light came on, it was over, anyway. I just needed to focus right now. Get in, get this body, then get out.

The trail of beast blood eventually tapered off, running out of paint to keep the trail alive. Still, the image of the footsteps lingered fresh in my mind, especially when we rounded onto the last street facing the abyss and saw the building.

Was she in there? If she had woken up and had to tear her way out of a beast, then surely she knew what kind of company was up here roaming about with her. If she went inside, did that mean whatever horrific manifestation was in there already ate her? Or did she find safety?

I suppose we were about to find out.

We wheeled the body cart along with us as we gingerly approached The Warehouse. The familiarity of this sight was almost nauseating.

The rig was perched dead at the edge of the abyss, its back half a stone's throw away to the black desert that I assumed lay far, far below. Because of that, all that lay ahead was its familiar parking lot and the grey, sheet metal box that contrasted against a pitch-black sky. Out where it was in real life, it was on the edge of the desert too, and when you showed up late into the evening, it didn’t look all that different from now.

Of all the buildings that felt like it belonged here, it was this one, although, I’m sure that was more *my* fault than it was The Warehouse’s

Spotlights by the door lazily circled the sky on their cheap motors, and even more stationary ones lined the edges of the building, lit up with vibrant colors to wash the drab metal out with manufactured joy. Two signs out by the road and hanging above the door read its name in cursive, neon-magenta letters.

I was home.

But there was no time for fanfare. No pause to take it all in. I kept trudging onward, and June did so with me. We knew the drill at this point. Every rig was different, and there was really no guessing what might lay behind these doors. We weren’t going to be able to formulate a plan until we saw it for ourselves, and even then, we only had the two of us to pull it off, a far cry from the four we’d had to face the last threats.

These rigs seemed to be getting more intense the longer they were connected to me, and I hoped that whatever my brain had conjured up from the roots this time wouldn’t be enough to end us.

I parked the cart, glided past the empty bouncer stool sitting by the entrance, then tugged on the handle of one of the giant red doors.

Instantly, the muffled sound of club beats that had been leaking through the seams hit us full blast. My teeth rattled, and so did my chest as we cautiously took one step after another into the small entry space. Band posters and local advertisements were plastered all over the walls from years long past, and several benches sat unoccupied where once was college students hanging back for their friends.

Despite the lack of people, the air still hauntingly smelled of perfume, sweat, and alcohol. Ghosts lingered in the space that I could almost see if my vision was blurry enough. The phantom taste of tequila shots stung at my tongue as one foot moved in front of the other toward the opening into the main floor, and I almost felt phantom vertigo from a drunken daydream.

I looked to June and saw on her face that she was feeling similar to me, though where I was keeping my expression cool, her more emotional self was showing all the disgust blatantly outward.

Together, we rounded the corner onto the dance floor, and my face morphed to match hers at what we saw.

The room was how I remembered it; that part wasn’t shocking. Lights shone about from the ceiling, several of them moving and swirling around, their colorful beams flying over the room like ghastly phantoms. The air was hazy with distant fog machines by the DJ table up front, and lasers cut through it as they danced back and forth in complicated patterns. Directly across from us on the far side of the room had been my favorite spot, the bar. All the same bottles I’d drunk numerous shots from still glimmered on the shelves behind it beneath more pastel neon lights.

Other than the special effects, the place had never really been all that impressive. Just a wide open box with tables on the far side, and enough room to fit a whole campus on the other. Right now, though, there wasn’t a campus occupying the dance floor. There wasn’t *nobody* either.

There were mannequins.

Dozens of hundreds of mannequins crowded the space, their plain white plastic skin taking on the form of whatever color shined on them. Some of them were dressed in loose fitting clothes, others were naked, and there didn’t seem to be a rhyme or reason in the way that they were placed about the space.

June and I jumped as they all suddenly moved in unison, and my clone snapped a hand out to grab my wrist. She tried to retreat back into the entrance, but I held steady and scrutinized them for a moment. It was only their arms that moved. One shifting up, the other down. A few more beats passed in the song over the speakers, then they did it again, their limbs alternating back to normal.

Dancing. They were dancing.

I saw how as I stepped out from the tunnel of the entrance and into the full space. Looking up, past the rafters and scaffolding that held the lights, there was no ceiling. It was the same dark abyss that all the other rigs had in their unfinished areas. The ceiling stretched up seemingly forever. In the lights sweeping the room, I could see fishing lines glinting through the air, running from each statue’s wrist and up to some place unseen in the darkness. The limbs made a repeated plastic scratch each time they shifted in unison that could be heard over the music.

*‘SHOK!’*

The room had me beyond baffled. It was just so strange. Something like the pill bottles back at my childhood home. Clearly never there before, but made a weird sort of sense.

There were always people at The Warehouse with me, but rare were the times I paid them any mind aside from who I was taking home that night. They were a backdrop. A bunch of faceless set dressing to revolve around me.

I treated them like mannequins.

I could tell that must have been the intention of this place. The manifestation of my guilt over the matter. Faceless ghosts that had swirled through my hazy consciousness long ago come back to haunt me. It was made even more obvious by the beast that was living here.

It too was made of mannequins, only a few meters away from us. Its body was a  massive tangle of plastic limbs and heads, all bound and tied together at their joints by a glue of grey, fleshy muscle. Even from where I stood, I could see its texture, disturbingly close to human skin. That was about all that I could make out from it based on where we stood, but it wasn’t because it was too far or facing the wrong direction.

It was because it was smashed into oblivion.

The plastic heads that had presumably once controlled it were all shattered into white shards that stuck out of the bloody flesh. The tendons were strewn in chunks around the floor and spattered onto nearby statues that continued to dance like their brother wasn’t all over their face. Limbs and hands that still remained intact on the beast stretched out into the air, their jointed fingers curled in agony and desperation. All around, it lay in a pool of black blood, reflecting the stage lights above like it was iridescent oil.

Something had *killed* it.

Something had killed the monster guarding the place. The same kind of beast that had almost tore three of us at once limb from limb at every other rig.

“I don’t like this…” June whimpered from next to me, still holding my wrist. Suddenly, I didn’t mind her holding it anymore.

My eyes traced the room past the dead creature, and I saw a path of more mannequins, these ones normal. They were on the ground though, some of their limbs popped off and still dangled from the fishing wire. With each beat change, they’d float up and down as if a torso were still attached. The collapsed mess of plastic bodies followed a very obvious trail through the crowd up to a destination on the far side of the room.

The bar.

There were footsteps once again that I could see, trailing out of the dead monster’s puddle, but this time, they looked bigger. A little more elongated. My throat grew tight.

Changing targets, too frozen with dread to move, I peered out over the crowd. I didn’t need to know what happened here, I just needed to know where our destination was. I needed to know how fast we could leave. Luckily, this was the simplest rig so far.

On the wall far from us, behind the DJ booth, I could see the colossal control room doors peeking above the table, its cold, steel surface occasionally illuminated by a sweeping spotlight. It was a simple walk across a room no bigger than half a football field.

It was only simple in distance, though. As I mentioned before, the warehouse was nothing but an open room. Once we hit the button on those doors, anything in here would immediately know where we were and have a straight shot to us. The monster I’d made to haunt this place may have been dead, but June and I hadn’t seen a second set of footprints leaving this place when we came in.

Hensley 5 was still here somewhere, and judging by what she’d done to the creature laying before us, I didn’t want to find her anymore.

Whatever she was now, it was not human.

The music still blaring at the DJ booth slid into a new song, jarring me from my paralysis and prompting me to move. If she was still in here, that meant we probably didn’t have much time before she showed herself. June and I needed to get out of the open and against the far wall to cover. The curtains of the stage would be the best place to hide.

I tugged June, much to her dismay, and together, we moved low, starting into the sea of faux bodies and doing our best not to topple any over.

*‘SHOK!’*

Each time their arms shifted, I jumped, half out of fear that it somehow might wake the hiding clone, and half because it felt like the plastic dolls might pounce on us. June and I hugged the wall closest to us so that we could see the entire room through the crowd and stay somewhat concealed, only straying away from it when we needed to pass a mannequin. There were a few in the corners that weren’t tied up to strings like the others; only propped up with drinks in their hands as if sitting and talking.

I couldn’t help but slow for a moment when I saw one posed in a lean against the wall, a plastic cup filled with cider in its hand. It wasn’t where I had met Trevor, but it was enough to invoke memories of it, and I felt an immense longing in my chest, remembering what we were even doing this for.

For Ann to go back to him while I rotted away here.

*‘SHOK!’*

June and I were halfway across the room, when my little slowdown cost us. June, who had been watching our back for company, hadn’t expected my stop, and she bumped into me. It wasn’t hard in the slightest, barely enough to apply force, but with our low stances and cramped space between the mannequins, I didn’t have the best balance.

I staggered only slightly to the side, enough to catch a hand of a statue just as it shifted.

The way I pressed into it made the doll begin to lean slightly, and I quickly grabbed its hips to stop it.

*‘SHOK—PUCK!’*

When the fishing line shifted again, and the right arm of the doll went taut, it was too far out of position, and with me holding its body to keep it from getting pulled back, it yanked the arm clean out of its socket.

The plastic limb slungshot outward toward another dancer in the crowd, smacking hard against its torso with a loud clap. It was delicate enough not to knock it over, but compared to the steady club mix that was playing, the noise may as well have been a cannon blast.

June and I held perfectly still while the mannequin arm began to sway back toward us, then slowly dangled to a complete stop. Our eyes scanned the room, waiting for any kind of movement from the darker shadows, but none ever came. Instead, a sound was returned over the music.

A squeal. Not malicious or angry—not a scream either. It was just a loud, high-pitched noise. Our heads whipped in its direction, and my body jolted with shock as I saw a figure now standing behind the bar, arms over her head and stretching with a loud, obnoxious yawn. June grabbed my wrist again, and I guided her lower with it.

I was correct. The thing behind the bar may have been me at one point, but that wasn’t the case anymore. Her red hair was longer than mine, running far below the counter, and it was gnarled and tangled before her face. Her skin was pale and gaunt—that part no different from mine—but the limbs it covered were far, far longer.

Her knees were nearly to the top of the bar counter, and her arms dragged down to around her mid calf. Her nails were even longer… She was fully nude still, the only cover being the dried black muck that she had crawled out of from the gut of the beast she’d grown in.

It'd done something to her. It was the only explanation I could think of. She’d been incubating inside of that stuff the whole time. Soaking it in. Melding her fresh, growing body with it. Suddenly it all explained why she was able to claw through a monster's guts. How she was able to pummel the beast that assailed her when she got here.

This Hensley was most likely set to be all of my depravity, and the ichor, or blood, or imprint—or whatever the hell this fluid of the abyss was—it had only amplified that.

I felt the world swirl as I remembered that same black poison had just gotten all over Hope…

As viscerally ill as that thought made me, there wasn’t time to worry about that right now. One problem at a time; we needed a plan, and fast.

June and I watched in stunned silence as my fifth clone panted to herself, growling with every breath and sniffing the air like a wild animal. She glided a colossal limb to her leg and scratched at it with her claws, then turned to the counter behind her and stood tall, pouring over its contents with an animalistic curiosity. We watched her grab a full bottle of tequila off the shelf, pop the cork with a nail, then draw it to her dry, cracked lips.

In several, loud messy gulps, she downed the whole thing.

June and I had no idea what to do, whether to move or stay put. I was about to continue onward, hoping to get to cover while she was distracted, but the moment I moved a foot, she jerked her head toward the dance floor.

I froze, and June gripped my hand tight, beginning to hyperventilate. I kept an iron vice on her, not letting her move just yet. She wasn’t looking at us.

With a noise akin to a giggle, my depravity tossed the bottle haphazardly across the club, shattering it on the concrete as she clambered over the bar and into the main space. Unlike June and I, she paid little mind to the fellow dancers on the floor, plowing through them and shattering them to pieces as they went. Her long, stalky limbs were a little too awkward for the cramped area, however, and the more she ran, the more tangled on the wires above she became. They weren’t a challenge at first, but after a few bounds, they built up around her arms and neck until she began to have trouble with them.

That’s when she turned on a dime.

Like a feral animal, she let out a loud, angry scream in my voice; distorted and crackly. Thrashing her limbs, she slashed and clawed at the wires tangling her up, snapping them like guitar strings and bowling over more mannequins in the process. Even more behind those toppled like dominoes, and once she was fully free from her restraints, she began punishing them for their transgressions on the ground, popping their skulls beneath her skeletal palms.

She did this for about a minute, then finally calmed down, panting hard and looking at the catastrophe she’d just caused. Like nothing had ever even happened, she closed her eyes, grew a far-too-wide smile, then began to sway and writhe her body around the space she’d just created.

It was a scene I knew all too well…

Depravity was in the middle of the room now, and June and I off to the side, just slightly behind her. I could tell she still didn’t see us, and since clearly alcohol still affected her, I knew we had dampened perception on our side. Slowly, I began to formulate a plan.

This version of me wasn’t a monster bound to this place, she could still leave, which meant even if we got to the door and got in, we couldn’t find a way to beat her out after and escape. We needed to incapacitate her, and I didn’t really think my odds were too good against my shadow's new, superhuman physique. That left only one other option.

We needed to trap her.

Across the room beside the bar, there was a massive walk-in chiller, thick as an industrial freezer. That meant the door would be as well. If we could bait the clone in there and then lock her inside, we’d be free to get the door open, get the body, then get out. It was really the only option right now with the time crunch we were on.

I tried not to think of the implications that came with leaving a version of myself to freeze to death in a box after we left. She was clearly already gone. This was doing her a mercy.

I fished the door keycard out of my coat, lightly pulled June close to me, then pressed my lips to her ear so she’d hear me above the music, “Keep going for the door. Once you get up there, get ready. I’m going to trap her in the fridge. As soon as she’s in, get the door open.”

My sensitive half pulled away, then made eyes of pure terror at me, shaking her head and squeezing my hand.

My look back was less empathetic as I rolled my eyes and leaned back in more aggressive this time, “June, we don’t have time. We have to do this.”

She once again looked at me unsure, and my anger began to grow. I was about ready to just leave her standing here and force her to move, but then, that look in her eyes finally broke through to me. Softened me up. I remembered what I’d said to her earlier, and guilt plagued my chest again.

I leaned in one more time, “Please, June; I’ll come back. I promise. I…I’m glad you came back for me.”

She pulled back one last time, a tear rolling down her cheek, then stared. With one last squeeze to my palm, she released me, then slipped past. I didn’t hesitate.

The trip to the freezer was a heart-pounding blur as I moved between mannequins back to the front door, then began wrapping over to the bar. I kept my eyes on Depravity the whole time, making sure she was still thoroughly charmed by the music, and luckily she seemed too drunk to even open her eyes. I tried to keep tabs on June as I went too, but I couldn’t make her out over the crowd, a good sign I suppose, as it meant we were well covered.

When I reached the bar, I stepped carefully along the counter's edge, making sure not to disturb even the liquor puddles on the floor. Finally, I wrapped its edge and reached my destination, looking over my shoulder one last time at Hensley 5.

When I saw she was still dancing, I placed my hand on the chiller handle, then waited for the music to swell. Looking over and seeing my clone’s back turned, I lightly tugged it, wincing at the metallic, sucking *click* that it made. With the hard part done, I looked back to check my status again, relieved to see I was safe.

I braced a knee against the door to make sure the suction wouldn’t slingshot the seal open, then tugged gently. Even over the music, I could hear the rubber border of the fridge crackling as it parted from its metal case until finally, it popped open all the way. I released the breath I was holding, swung the barrier open all the way, then reached over to a nearby hand sink, grabbing a rag and wadding it up to prop open the door.

There was no padlock on the fridge handle, so I needed something to slot in once I got my clone inside. I quickly scanned the bar area and looked for something that would work, spotting a knife sharpener next to the lime knife. I grabbed it and tested it against the hole; a perfect fit. Perfect enough to buy me more time, at least.

And that was it. I was ready. With a heavy breath, I grabbed a bottle, then looked out at Depravity one last time. Despite her monstrous appearance, and what I’d seen her capable of, she almost looked content out there on the dance floor, swaying and twisting to the synthetic beats. Peaceful.

I wondered if when I was out there so long ago, were people also able to see me that way? Or was I a grotesque, twisted monster in their eyes too, just like I was to the girl whose face and relationship I’d broken?

Me or my clone out there, I knew there was darkness lurking below the surface, and I couldn’t let it run free anymore.

Moving to the side of the chiller, I reached around the door, then hucked the bottle as hard as I could.

*‘TING—Ting—ting—tock…’*

The glass echoed out through the door, and I quickly hugged the wall, receding to the shadows. Like a bloodhound, I saw Depravity perk up and snap her head my direction, letting out a growl as she began stalking over the masses she’d toppled over in her tantrum. More limbs and heads popped beneath her weight as she landed on them, and my chest thundered with the club beat as she drew close.

I could hear her breath rattling out across the concrete as she stalked closer, drool spilling off her lips and joining the liquor puddles on the floor. She reached the edge of the fridge, then paused, sticking her head inside and sniffing around.

“Please…” I muttered under my breath. “Please give me this *one* thing…”

For the first time since I arrived at the abyss, my prayers were answered.

Hen 5 stepped fully into the freezer, and the moment I saw her heel disappear, I leapt from the shadows and plowed into the door. It slammed shut with a *thud*, and with my heart racing, I stabbed the knife sharpener into the lock hole.

“June, now!” I screamed over the beat.

I heard the doors begin whirring to life by the DJ stand as the door beside me gave a lurch. I jumped away with a yelp, then backed away slowly as I heard my muffled, angry, desperate voice screaming from within. There was a hesitation in my heart, but when the door gave another jolt, and the sharpener rattled in the handle, I grabbed a bar stool and stuffed it under the door too.

Turning on my heels, I joined June.

My brain ran frantic as we entered the control room and set to work. We didn’t even close the door; this was only a pit crew stop. I knew we didn’t have much time before Il-Belliegħa showed up, and we’d have even less if Hensley 5 broke out of her cell. If either of those happened, I didn’t know what we would do. All we could hope for is that we had the body to Ann by then, and that she’d hold up her end of the bargain.

I yelled to June to get the scientist while I shut down the system of the rig. She did so fast, and once I had it down, she yanked all the cables free. If the scientist here had any consciousness left, she didn’t show it, and frankly, I don’t know if June and I would have even noticed. We were dragging her up the steps and back out into the club before the sounds of the rig whirring down had stopped.

Dust began raining like confetti from the ceiling as we moved down the stage and back onto the dance floor. Adrenaline was working overtime to keep us going, and the screams of Hen 5 were helping to pump more into me. So was her incessant pounding; we were halfway before—

*‘Ka-Thunk!’*

My head snapped to the chiller just in time to see the handle, knife sharpener, and stool go smashing off and skittering into the crowd of plastic. The door slammed open, and from the depths of the fridge emerged a pissed-off Depravity, her jaundiced eyes wild and feral.

It seemed I underestimated just how strong her new form had made her, and now, we had nowhere to run.
