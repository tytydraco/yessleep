**I**

I’ve always taken the subway.

That’s just how it goes for most people in New York City. Cars can drain your wallet, and it's not worth it for someone like me who doesn’t have cash to spare or the patience for the hassle of alternate-side parking. Having a car here feels less like a ticket to freedom and more like a burden. According to Google, about half the city’s residents feel the same way. Honestly, I’m surprised it’s not a bigger number. Just dealing with traffic can age you a decade. I’ve watched cabs sit through a single red light cycle three times without budging an inch.

Of course, it’s not all smooth sailing and neatly folded newspapers. The MTA has its fair share of madness. Delays, reroutes, those mysterious “train traffic ahead” announcements, and the people. Not everyone is a problem. Most of us are just trying to get from point A to point B with our headphones in and our eyes down. 

But then there are the others, the quirky ones. The subway performers who treat the A train like it’s their stage at the Apollo. The cat-callers who think shouting a compliment across a crowded car is the way to someone’s heart. The folks sprawled across three seats, deep in slumber. And then there are the homeless, many quietly navigating life underground, blending into the scenery, while others make their presence felt in ways that are hard to overlook.

It’s a lot to take in. It can be overwhelming. It used to be for me.

I didn’t grow up here. My family moved to the city when I was seventeen, right in the middle of junior year. We came from a small town in Pennsylvania, the kind of place where doors are left unlocked and everyone waves, whether they know you or not. But my mom was ready for a change. She craved a fresh start, something bigger and louder than the quiet life we’d been living. I think the city was more of a distraction for her than anything else.

So we packed up what we could, sold off what we couldn’t, and ended up in a tiny, third-floor walk-up. That first year was a tough one. The city felt alive, like it had its own heartbeat, always bustling and demanding something from you. But as time went on, I started to find my rhythm. The clattering of the trains, the cadence of the announcements, and the way you begin to recognize familiar faces during your morning commute, even if you never exchange a word with them.

Now, the subway feels like a second home. A peculiar kind of sanctuary between my actual home. Sure, it’s not perfect. It’s gritty, unpredictable, and can be downright frustrating at times, but it’s real. And in a city like this, sometimes that’s the best you can hope for.

Today felt like just another ordinary day.

I work one of those classic office jobs, you know the drill. Beige cubicles, flickering fluorescent lights, and coffee that tastes more like regret than anything remotely caffeinated. It’s not glamorous, but it pays the bills. Honestly, I don’t mind it. There’s a certain comfort in the routine. I’ve never been the “follow your passion” type anyway.

 Passion seems like a luxury for those who don’t have to stress about rent, groceries, or whether their MetroCard has enough balance. For someone like me, a job that asks for exactly what I’m willing to give. nothing more, nothing less. Feels just right.

So, as usual, I clocked out after a long day, grabbed my well-worn suitcase, more of a work bag, really, but it’s taken enough hits to deserve the title, and threw on my coat. It was one of those early spring days when the weather can’t seem to decide what it wants to be. The sky was thick with clouds, but the air felt warm. I remember thinking I might have overdressed. Again.

The subway station was busier than usual. I could feel the day’s fatigue creeping in as I navigated through clusters of tourists clutching maps like they were trying to conjure a spirit. A group of them had gathered in front of the MetroCard machines, blissfully unaware they were blocking the entire entrance. I muttered an “excuse me,” knowing it would probably go unheard, and slipped past them with the quiet efficiency of someone who’s done this dance a thousand times.

I managed to find an empty spot on a bench, next to a guy who clearly was in the same predicament as me, just wanting to go home. He sat slouched over, tie loosened, eyes glazed in that universal post-9-to-5 stare. I pulled out my phone and started scrolling. News, social feeds, the same stream of curated distraction I’d scrolled through that morning. Nothing new, nothing exciting. Just the hypnotic flicker of blue light against my face.

The station hummed with a low mechanical groan, the kind that seeps into your bones if you stand still long enough. A saxophone echoed faintly from somewhere down the platform, its player hidden behind a row of pillars. The music was slow, mournful, something that might’ve been soulful if not for the flat notes and tinny reverb.

The overhead lights flickered once, briefly, and I felt my eyelids droop. The kind of droop that comes not just from exhaustion, but from routine, bone-deep familiarity with a world that never quite changes. The same gum-stained tiles, the same peeling advertisements promising miracle diets and dubious lawyers, the same stale underground air tinged with hot metal and too many people in too small a space.

I blinked slowly. My phone sagged in my grip. Maybe it was the warmth of the tunnel, or the way the concrete seemed to hum in time with my heartbeat, but a fog started creeping in behind my eyes. A subtle pounding, dull but persistent, started at the base of my skull and worked its way forward. Not quite a migraine yet, but close. That hazy, unreal feeling where everything seems too far away or too close at once.

I shifted on the bench, adjusted the strap of my bag, and tried to focus on something, anything. A child across the platform was swinging his legs, counting tiles. An older woman tapped her cane rhythmically as if keeping time to some internal metronome. The train was late, of course.

My head dipped forward for just a moment. Or at least, I thought it was a moment. The next thing I knew, I was waking up with a start, heart thudding, phone sliding from my lap.

I quickly grabbed it before it could fall. My fingers wrapped around the phone just in time, its smooth surface slick with the sweat of my palm. I took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, letting my heart settle back into a more reasonable rhythm. The jolt had shaken off the last of my drowsiness, but something else had replaced it, an uneasy stillness. I glanced around, blinking hard.

The station was empty.

Startlingly, unnaturally empty.

The bench beside me, where the tired man had been sitting, was now vacant. The tourists, the child counting tiles, the old woman with the cane,gone. Every single person had vanished. No more quiet chatter, no more shuffling feet. The distant hum of the saxophone had stopped. Even the ever-present whoosh of air from passing tunnels was absent. The silence pressed against my ears like cotton, thick and disorienting.

My first thought was that I had fallen asleep for hours and missed the crowds, missed the rush. But that didn’t explain the silence. The subway never slept, not completely. There was always someone, always noise. Always something.

Confused, I moved to check the time on my phone. The screen stayed black. I pressed the power button once, twice, nothing. No buzz, no flicker. It was like the phone had simply died, or forgotten how to be a phone. I turned it over in my hands, wondering if the battery had given out. But it hadn’t felt like it was dying before I nodded off. And still… It felt warm. Too warm. 

I sighed, my breath louder than it should’ve been in the silent station, and slowly stood. The sound of my coat shifting, the scuff of my shoe against the platform, all echoed more than they should. My bag tugged at my shoulder as I adjusted it. The concrete underfoot suddenly felt less stable, like I was balancing on something too smooth, too polished to be part of a subway system that was never cleaned enough.

That’s when I heard it: the distant metallic screech of a train on the tracks, growing louder by the second. I turned toward the tunnel. Headlights cut through the darkness, spilling yellow beams that flickered as they passed over stray bits of trash and the tiled walls.

The train was slowing. Coming to a stop.

The front car hissed as it aligned with the platform, the doors sighing open in a mechanical exhale. I waited for someone to step out. No one did. No conductor visible. No passengers. The interior lights flickered, weak, sickly fluorescents that buzzed like an old ceiling fixture in a basement no one visited anymore.

I hesitated, my instincts buzzing now in a different way, telling me this didn’t make sense, that I should wait for the next one, that something about this was off. But logic took over. I told myself I’d simply take this train to my stop. Maybe this was one of those weird off-hours when everything just feels strange. Maybe there had been a power surge, and that’s why the phone was dead. Maybe I was just tired and overthinking it all.

I stepped closer, boots thudding softly against the concrete as I approached the open doors. They creaked apart slowly, like jaws easing open for a meal. Above the door, the flickering orange letters of the Destination Sign glowed through the gloom:

*“Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate.”*

It scrolled, paused, then repeated.

*“Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate.”*

I squinted at it, confused. The words were unfamiliar, clearly not English, but close enough to make me think I should know them. “Spanish?” I wondered. “Italian, maybe? Latin?” I didn’t know. Whatever it was, it didn’t seem to be a station name, and definitely not one I recognized from the usual route. 

I shrugged to myself. I didn’t speak Spanish, at least, that’s what I assumed it was ,and besides, it didn’t matter. I was tired. I was cold. I just wanted to get home.

The doors finished opening with a heavy thunk that echoed down the empty station.

I stepped on.

The moment I crossed the threshold, a strange sensation washed over me, like I’d walked through a membrane of cold air, colder than the platform, almost like a refrigerated room. A shiver climbed my spine. I pulled my jacket tighter around me, trying not to look too long at the sterile glow of the fluorescent lights overhead.

Once again, the car was empty. Too empty. Not the lived-in kind of empty, not the kind that follows a morning rush or a late-night lull. This was something else. The seats were spotless, almost clinically so. The air was unmoving, stale but not from use, like it had been trapped in here for too long. Even the hum of the train's systems sounded muted, muffled somehow.

I picked a seat near the middle, my fingers gripping the plastic edge for balance. The cold seeped through my jacket, into my hands, into my bones. I let out a long breath, watching it fog slightly in front of my face.

I sat. I held my bag close.

I told myself this was just a weird delay, an alternate route, an old car maybe, something forgotten in the system but still functional. Nothing to worry about.

But my reflection in the window didn't seem convinced. The glass was too dark, too slow to catch up. I shifted slightly, and it lagged a fraction of a second behind, as though unsure whether to follow me at all.

The doors hissed shut behind me, sealing with an almost ceremonial finality. The train jolted forward, moving into the tunnel. No conductor’s voice came over the intercom. No rumbling announcement of the next stop.

Just that whisper of motion. That chill in the air.

And that sign, still blinking, still repeating, on the far end of the car:

“Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate.”

I sat for a moment, hugging my coat tighter, the chill gnawing at my skin. The rhythmic clatter of the train against the tracks was the only sound now, a dull, mechanical heartbeat echoing through the car. I stared at the floor, at the speckled plastic between my boots, until something caught my eye outside the window.

Movement.

I turned my head slowly.

People.

At first, I thought it was a trick of the light, or my eyes playing games after the nap and the dim glow of the car. But no, it was unmistakable. Just outside the train, barely feet away, people were walking alongside it.

I gasped and bolted upright, pressing my face closer to the glass. The chill from the window stung my skin. The train hadn’t stopped ;  it was still moving, but so were they. A silent procession, keeping perfect pace. Dozens of them. Maybe more.

They walked not on a platform, but on something else, something dark and indistinct. The backdrop behind them was black, as if the tunnel had dissolved into a void. No walls, no lights, no signs. Just figures moving in lockstep with the train.

They didn’t look at me. They didn’t look at anything.

Their expressions were blank. Not peaceful, empty. Eyes open, unfocused. Mouths shut. No signs of communication, no hint that they even knew each other. Some were dressed in business suits, others in t-shirts, nightgowns, and uniforms. A teenager shuffled by wearing a backpack. An old woman in a house robe. A child with no shoes. A man in a soaked parka that dripped even though there was no rain.

No common thread, no reason, just people. All kinds of people.

And they were all walking in the same direction, right beside me, staring forward into nothing.

I felt my breath catch in my throat. My fingers trembled as they gripped the edge of the seat. I couldn’t look away. My brain raced to make sense of it. Some kind of art installation? A window to another train? A hallucination?

But they were too close. Too real. I could see the subtle sway of their steps, the twitch of a hand here, a loose thread blowing slightly there.

Finally, I sat back down, the seat creaking softly beneath me. I kept my eyes on the figures outside, watching them pass with that same slow, ghostlike pace. None of them looked back again. They just walked endlessly, obediently, as if drawn by some invisible tether. I don’t know how long I watched. Minutes? Hours? It felt like time had dissolved into the rhythm of the train and the hush of those blank faces drifting by.

Then, through the grime-streaked glass, a station emerged from the dark.

The train slowed, the brakes letting out a soft hiss like an exhale. The doors opened without a chime or announcement, just a quiet invitation. I stood, hesitating for a second. Then I stepped forward, drawn by something I couldn’t name. Maybe curiosity. Maybe instinct. Maybe the growing certainty that this was no ordinary ride home.

I clutched my bag tightly and stepped off.

The station was quiet. Too quiet.

Pale lighting flickered above, casting a soft ivory glow over every surface. There was classical music playing faintly, some string piece I couldn’t name, maybe Debussy or Satie,but it echoed as though it had been playing forever, looping in a forgotten corner of a dream. The acoustics were wrong. A fog dusted the floor, almost like dry ice had been hidden in the corner. 

The walls gleamed, tiles white as bone, without a smudge or crack. No stains, no ads torn halfway down, no gum under the benches. Even the trash bins were empty. It wasn’t just clean,it was sterile, like no one had ever truly been here. Or if they had, they’d been erased afterward.

And yet… ads lined the far wall.

Not the usual ones for teeth whitening or discount lawyers. These were photographs, portraits. Faces I half-recognized. Not from life, but from dreams. From forgotten corners of sleep, from memories I could never fully place. One woman looked like a version of my second-grade teacher, but with green eyes and a crown of wheat. Another man reminded me of someone I once saw standing outside my apartment window at 2 a.m., ten years ago. I was certain I’d never seen these people in waking life, and yet there they were. Smiling. Still. Almost expectant. 

The brand names were vague, I wasn’t even sure if they were English. My eyes couldn’t focus enough on the logos to take in any details. 

Other passengers stood along the platform. At first, I thought they might board. But none of them moved. Some murmured to themselves. Others stood perfectly still, staring into space or fiddling with watches, pendants, and small objects clutched like charms. A few whispered phrases, fragmented riddles that made no sense.

“The river runs backward, and so do the clocks.”

 “He never took the second stair.”

“One more stop, or none at all.”

Their voices didn’t carry. It was like they were underwater.

I stepped further in. My shoes made no sound on the tiled floor. No one acknowledged me. No one reacted. I might as well have been a ghost among ghosts. I looked for signs. Exit, Uptown, Transfer, anything. But there was nothing. Just the gleaming walls, the frozen faces, and that low, looping melody.

There were no stairs. No escalators. No elevators. Just this platform. Endless, perfect, and sealed. My fingers tightened around the strap of my bag. The train behind me remained at the platform, doors still open. Waiting.  I took a step farther from the train. The lights above flickered faintly, not enough to go dark, just enough to feel like they could. My footsteps made no sound.

I looked around again, slower this time.

A strange pressure began to build in my chest. A low, crawling sense of wrongness. I felt like I was walking too far into something I wouldn't know how to leave. Like the further I got from the train, the less of myself I was carrying with me. Amid the crowd, a face called to me. I froze, staring, heart thudding in my chest as I traced each familiar feature. I knew it was my brother.

But that was impossible.

He’d died before we ever came to New York. 

That fire had taken everything. It caught in the middle of the night, silent and sudden, and by the time help came, it was too late. The cause had never been determined. Just one of those tragedies people nod solemnly about and try to forget.

Our family didn’t forget. My mom certainly wouldn't. We left.

So how could he be here, now? 

I shook my head, trying to clear it, to ground myself in reality. It couldn’t have been him.

It couldn’t.

I turned back.

The open doors of the train looked different now, less inviting, more like a wound in the wall. A slit of light in a place that shouldn't have any. I hesitated. Then the whisper of a thought brushed through my mind, not mine, but carried on the edges of instinct:

This is the only way out.

I swallowed hard, my throat suddenly dry. Without another glance at the other passengers or the sterile walls, I stepped back onto the train.

As my foot crossed the threshold, a chill rushed over me. Colder than before. Deeper. Like stepping into the memory of winter. I sat down quickly, bag clutched tight in my lap, and tried not to look out the window. The doors slid shut behind me with a slow, deliberate hiss. The train began to move.

And as I settled into my seat again and the train lurched forward, a cold, cutting wind crept into the closed car. It had started as a draft, but only a thin trickle of air which tickled my neck. But it came, bulging in the course of a few moments into a wild, shrieking gust, as if the train had opened its veins to the world. Wind whipped down the aisle, tugging at my coat, messing strands of hair, icy on the sweat glued to my skin.

The wind shouldn't have been that strong. The windows weren’t open. The train was closed, air-conditioned to perfection like always. But this wind had a presence, there but not seen. I pulled myself into my coat, holding my bag as if it would ground me. Then, under the shriek of air, I heard something else. A whisper. But unmistakable.

It was my name.

I sat upright, my heart pounding in my chest. The whisper came again, so low I could barely pick it out, but as distinct as my thoughts. My name, sung through like an echo of a tunnel, spoken not with cruelty but with hunger. 

I looked around at the car, still empty. Quiet still, other than the wind and the pounding rhythm of the beat of my heart. Lights above flashed. Not loosely, electrically. But on purpose. As if the train itself was trembling. And then there was the deceleration of momentum. Slowly slowing down, passing on of inertia, the gentle pull in my stomach. The train was slowing once again.

Forward, the darkness broke apart to let in light. Not sterile white of a sanitized station. Not even the pale light of industrial halogens. This was rich, red light, alive, pulsating as if it were imbued with its heartbeat. It poured in through the windows in heavy waves, cloaking the inside of the train in a cave of crimson.

I stood up involuntarily, as if my body had decided something by itself. My legs pulled me toward the door, forced by some energy that did not entirely feel mine. The train came to a stop, and the doors slid open softly.

It wasn't a platform that stood there.

In its stead, a nightclub spread out like an underground cave. Black marble-lined walls glowed with crimson veins of neon. The floor shone beneath your feet like melted glass. Each surface caught the light in unnerving, twisted fashions, as though the room was shifting, reforming itself constantly to remain just this side of graspable.

And the music, deep, beaty, sensual, thrashed in the air. It wasn't brash. It didn't have to be. It shook in your bones, slower than a beat but closer. As if the beat had always been in you, and now the world is mirroring it.

Bodies moved in the room, dancing stiffly with elegance. They were beautiful. Too beautiful. Each of them chiseled like a dream or a Vogue cover, but wrong in a way I couldn't understand. Their faces were smooth and expressionless, like porcelain masks with a forever grin. Eyes black and impossible deep. Their movement was hypnotic, smooth, as if they weren't dancing to the music but were the music. And most strangely, they were all naked. 

A stench of scent hit me. Perfume so potent it was bordering on rotten, the astringent tang of sweat, and something below that, metallic and irrevocable. Iron. I gagged, the smell remaining on the back of my throat like blood. And then the voices. Whispers in a dozen different timbres, interweaving the bass, curling around my ears like smoke.

"Come in," they whispered.

"We've been waiting."

"You've always fantasized about this."

"We know what you want."

I ached to run. I ached to turn back. But my feet stayed rooted just beyond the train, drawn to heat, rhythm, weight of the air. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw movement. One of the riders. A man I'd not even noticed until now. How did I not see him? 

He stood up from a bench on the inside of the train. A young man, dressed in business clothes, his tie loose, his eyes opened wide with awe. He spoke not a word, fought not. He simply walked ahead, moving as slowly as a somnambulist. He stepped off the train and onto the glowing dance floor.

The dancers shifted without missing a beat. They didn't stop, didn't blink. They shifted, making space for him with an inhuman fluidity. They found him, every one of them, and he stood still in the middle of their circle.

He stopped. Then smiled. Not a happy smile. Not even a relief smile. It was empty. Like something inside him had been removed. The dancers closed in around him. And I heard the scream.

It didn't come from the crowd. It came from the wall.

I approached the noise and saw an enormous mirror hung on a gold frame, radiating faintly with the same red light that filled the room. And within this mirror, the young man was pushed up against the glass from within. His mouth was agape, screaming, but he was making no sound. His hands clawed the glass. His eyes were wild, desperate, frightened. The scene behind him was chaos. A twisted, true version of the lounge beyond the flashy red lights. The other patrons inside the mirror were screaming, thrown about by invisible winds. Everything within that reflection was warped, violent, and wrong.

Behind him, the dancers moved in step. As if nothing had occurred. As if he had never lived at all. The mirror pulsed. The whispers returned, louder now, piling and insisting:

"You don't choose what you want."

"The want chooses you."

I stepped back. My boot caught on the lip of the train door. The dancers adjusted in my direction,just a little. Just enough. Enough for me. I launched myself back aboard the train. My breath caught as the doors slammed shut. The train groaned and began to move again, dragging me from the red light, from the mirror, from the scream that still echoed inside my chest.

I fell into the chair, my heart pounding. The gust of wind returned, almost soft. The way fingers combed my hair. But the scent lingered. Perfume. Sweat. Iron.

I was disoriented and immensely confused. Where the hell was I?

This had to be a dream. Some kind of break from reality. A crack in the smooth surface of sanity. I’d read about astral projection before, back when I was dabbling in all that witchy stuff. crystals, herbs, and protection spells. I’d gotten into it for a while after I first moved to New York, just enough to recognize the signs. That had to be what this was. A lucid dream. Maybe an episode. Something my brain was doing to cope. I had to be under too much pressure.

Everything had been unraveling lately. Bills are piling up. The weird tension between me and everyone I cared about. And with the third anniversary of my mom’s suicide coming up next week... maybe that was the trigger. Grief had a way of slipping back into your life like smoke under a door, unnoticed until you couldn’t breathe.

I looked around, trying to orient myself. Fluorescent lights buzzed above me like angry insects. The walls of the subway car pulsed in a dull, metallic gray, a sterile cage on wheels. I pinched my skin hard. Nothing. So I slapped myself across the face. The sound cracked the silence, and my cheek flushed pink where the impact landed. It didn’t hurt, exactly. More like a shimmer, a tingle. Almost like when a limb falls asleep, pins and needles, but warmer. Buzzing, alive.

When returning to your body after astral projection, you usually just find your resting place and slip back in. But I didn’t feel like a floating soul. I felt dense. Solid. The seat under me was hard. The air tasted faintly of rust and electricity. My skin felt too real, too intact. Could you still feel your heartbeat during astral projection?

I stared at my hands, no glow, no transparency. Just flesh and bone and chipped nail polish. I flexed my fingers. Still me. Still trapped. Maybe if I stayed on this train, let it take me wherever it was going, I’d find my way back. The idea felt like a rope I could hold onto. So I held onto it. I chose to believe it.

I leaned back into the seat. The clack-clack-clack of the wheels echoed in my ears, the sound oddly soothing. Outside the window, tunnels rushed past in flickers of shadow and gold, overhead lights strobing through the darkness like nervous thoughts. The rhythm of the train pressed itself into my bones, the gentle sway creating an almost meditative lull. Almost peaceful.

The next stop came into view.

I leaned toward the window, squinting into the strange light ahead. It wasn’t a station. It was a food court. The train slowed, the rhythmic clacking becoming a groaning crawl. I felt the brakes shudder beneath me, and once again, as they had before, the doors slid open with that same exhale of air, mechanical and tired.

The food court stretched out around me, impossibly wide, far larger than it could be. It curved in on itself in strange, repeating angles, like I’d stepped into a place that had forgotten how to end. Everywhere I turned, the same pale tiles, the same buzzing lights overhead. The hum in the air wasn’t just sound; it was pressure, like the building was breathing around me. Holding something in.

The counters were still stocked. Endlessly, violently stocked. Trays of meat were piled high, slick with a sheen that caught the light too well. Some pieces pulsed faintly, as if remembering what it was to live. There were pastries, too many, bursting at their seams with gelatinous fillings that leaked in slow, sticky drips down their sides. The smell was sugar and rot, warm and sickly sweet. They looked like they’d been decaying for days, and yet were always just set out.

And then there was the sludge. Piles of it in steel trays, bubbling softly. Brown, green, gray, none of it resembling food. It steamed endlessly, like it was being cooked by the building itself. The ladles stood stiff in the mounds, handles glistening, untouched but never quite clean. Every time I looked away and back again, the trays had been refilled. Nothing was ever gone. Nothing ever changed.

Except for them.

The patrons.

They were scattered across the tables, if you could call them people. Bloated, distended, half-fused to their chairs. Some looked stretched thin, like their skin had forgotten how to hold shape. Others had grown around the metal frames, flesh bulging between the bars of their seats like rising dough. Their eyes were cloudy, mouths slack. One man chewed endlessly at something I couldn’t see. A woman held a fork midair, never lifting it to her mouth, never lowering it. Just frozen in the act. Like they were all trapped in some looping performance of hunger.

I couldn’t tell if they were alive. I told myself not to look too long. But I did. One turned toward me. Just slightly. The skin at her neck cracked when she moved. Then, she returned to eating. 

The lights overhead buzzed louder. The menus on the stalls flickered, showing food that didn’t exist. A cheeseburger with teeth. A milkshake that twitched. I kept walking, trying to find an edge, an exit, even a dead end. But the layout looped, warped. Every turn brought me back to the same corner. The sludge. The meat. The figures are in their seats.

“Free me,” a voice called.

That stopped me in my tracks, the first human voice I’d heard since I boarded the train. A man slumped in a steel chair, grotesque and bloated. His flesh spilled over the sides like melted wax, glistening with sweat. His face, barely recognizable as human, quivered as he sobbed, yet his hands kept working, shoveling gray, unidentifiable slop from a tray into his mouth. Like he had no choice.

“What?” I asked, stepping closer. My voice sounded small, unsure. “Please,” he rasped, not looking at me. “I can’t take it anymore.”

Suddenly, a speaker overhead crackled to life, sharp and cold. “Consumption is nourishment. You will be full.” The words echoed through the food court, sterile and inhuman.

“I… I’m sorry,” I said, but I didn’t know what I meant. I was sorry he was like this. I was sorry I couldn’t help. I was sorry I had come. He turned his swollen face toward me. For a moment, something real flickered in his eyes. “I just want to go home,” he whispered. “It was too soon.”

“What was?” I asked. He opened his mouth, as if to answer, but the announcement cut in again. “Consumption is nourishment. You will be full.”

The effect was instant. Like a switch had been flipped. The man turned away. His expression went slack. The tears stopped. The shoveling resumed, mechanical and precise. The hunger was still there, but it no longer belonged to him. I stood frozen, heart pounding, watching him eat. His eyes no longer saw me. He was already gone. 

I turned to head back to the train when a terrible scream tore through the air behind me. It wasn’t just loud, it was raw, like something being ripped apart from the inside out.

I spun around. The sound came from the woman, the one who had looked at me earlier. Her eyes were wide, wild with terror. Her body jerked violently as she was dragged backward, not by hands or machinery, but by something invisible. There were no ropes, no figures. Just an unseen force pulling her toward a dark doorway at the back of the food court.

She screamed all the way in. Then, silence. Moments passed. Just when I thought I might step forward, she reappeared.

She walked slowly, mechanically, and sat back down in her seat as if nothing had happened. But she looked… smaller. The grotesque layers of flesh she’d worn before were mostly gone now, stripped away as if something had peeled her like fruit. Her eyes were hollow. Her limbs moved like they were no longer hers.

As soon as she sat, more trays of slop were delivered across the food court. The other patrons began to eat again, more eagerly now, like she had somehow replenished them. It hit me all at once: she had. She’d been used. Fed into whatever machine powered this place, only to be returned diminished, but not free. Never free.

I backed away slowly, the air feeling heavier with each breath. Then I turned and stepped back onto the train. As the doors sealed behind me, I cast one last glance at the food court. I felt something close to pity for the patrons, the sad, swollen husks that slumped in their chairs, but the feeling rang hollow. They weren’t people anymore. They couldn’t be. Whatever they had been was long gone.

This whole cycle,getting off at these stops, walking through the corridors, watching things fall apart,it all seemed strange now. Pointless. Like I was just one more cog in something ancient and uncaring. I sank into my seat, eyes forward, letting the soft rattle of the train lull me into stillness. The lights flickered overhead. The wheels groaned. 

And the train kept moving.
