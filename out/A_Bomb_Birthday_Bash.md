It’s my cousin Tim’s seventh birthday. I sit around the table with all the other cousins making small talk. Even though I’m twenty-four, I still sit at the kids’ table for all the family events. I supposed I’m still a kid at heart. Besides, I don’t think they’d let me leave, anyway.

While we’re digging into our cake, my cousin Jimmy notices something.

“What’s that beeping noise?” He says, shoving a forkful of cake into his face.

I listen for a second, and sure enough, there is some kind of beeping. Everyone else at our table hears it, too. I call over everyone at the adult table.

“Maybe it’s the smoke alarm from blowing the birthday candles out?” My brother John says.

We check the alarm, but the source of the noise does not come from here. My cousin Tim is the one to find it.

“Guys, over here, under the table!”

We rush over, lifting the plastic table cover. Underneath the table is a metal contraption with a timer. It’s covered in what appears to be patches of human hair and skin. The red text reads two minutes. Suddenly, the front door of the apartment slams shut. John runs to it, pulling on the door, but it won’t budge.

The timer continues to count down as a note slides under the door.

“Kill someone to stop the timer.”

“Is this a joke?” John calls out.

Tim runs into the kitchen with a terrified look on his face.

We all stare at the horrible metal device under the table with one minute remaining.

“Fuck, what do we do?” I say.

“No one’s dying today.” John says.

“What happens when the timer goes off?!” my wife says, fighting back tears.

Thirty seconds left.

I turn around and, in a split second, I see Tim lunge for John, a knife in his hand. He slices him right in the throat. John grabs at his throat, blood gushing out of it. Everyone screams. All I can do is stare in fright as my brother collapses to the floor in a puddle of blood. With a sudden click, the timer stops with ten seconds left, and the lock on the door unlocks loudly.

“I’m not dying on my birthday.” Tim says dropping the knife.

I restrain Tim, and my wife calls the police. They arrive at the bloody scene, baffled. A bomb squad is called in for that thing under the table. Sure enough, it’s determined that the device would have killed all of us had the timer gone off. The cops say they’re going to run testing on the skin and hair, to find out who it belongs to. I have no clue what will happen to Tim as they take him away. Strangely enough, the cops make me fill out a non-disclosure form, though I ignore it in the following days. I mean how can I not talk about something as bizarre as this.

A few days later, the family joins again for John’s funeral. Closed casket, of course. No one expected this to be the next family gathering. It’s quiet because everyone is still on edge. As the ceremony draws to a close, we hear that dreaded sound once again. It’s coming from inside the casket.
