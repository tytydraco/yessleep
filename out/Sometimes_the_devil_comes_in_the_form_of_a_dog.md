I have an aunt who lives in rural Greece — in a village, all year round. We visit her from time to time, usually in the summer.

She’s the kind of aunt who, after a long evening on the veranda and a little too much wine, starts to talk. Most of the time it’s harmless village gossip: who’s feuding with whom, whose olive trees are doing well, which neighbour secretly sold a piece of land. But every now and then, she’ll share something spooky, something people there don’t repeat lightly—because they believe it.

Those moments are rare, and I always listen closely.

One of those nights, she told me a story from her own life — something she still swears is true. In the early ’90s, she and her then husband were working in a small rural city. One night they decided to drive to the next city over for a nightclub. The road wound around a mountain: narrow, empty, no streetlights. Partway through the drive, the car coughed and died. Out of gas.

No phones back then, so they left the headlights on and waited, bickering a little about my uncle’s habit of fueling at the last minute. Then they fell into a tense silence.

After a few minutes, her husband suddenly turned to her and said, sharply, “What?” “I didn’t say anything,” she shot back.

That was when she noticed his expression change—frozen, tight. He didn’t speak again for the rest of the night.

It wasn’t until they got home that he told her what had happened.

While they’d been sitting there in the dark and quiet, he decided to have a cigarette. As he reached for it, he heard my aunt call his name. He ignored it—still annoyed. A moment later, he heard it again, the same voice but harsher. 
He kept quiet, lighter in hand.

When he raised the cigarette to his lips, he heard his name a third time—now rasping, almost mocking. He snapped, “What?” out loud.
“I didn’t say anything,” my aunt answered.

When he glanced at the rear-view mirror, two eyes stared back from the back seat—yellow, gleaming, fixed on him. A huge black dog sat there, motionless, unblinking. Its fur looked matted and wet, as if it had just come in from a storm, though the night outside was dry. He swore its mouth twisted into something like a grin.

Then it spoke, in that same mocking, rough voice:
“Are you really going to light a cigarette now?”

The air in the car felt suddenly heavier, as if every breath was harder to draw. His hands shook, but after a few heartbeats he struck the lighter anyway. The flame caught. He looked back at the mirror—the back seat was empty.
They couldn’t go anywhere—they had no gas—so they waited out the night, him rigid and silent, until morning, when they finally made it home.

When I asked my aunt what she thought it was, she didn’t hesitate: “The devil. Around here they say if the devil comes as a black dog, lighting a cigarette drives it off. He hates the smoke.”

I can’t ask my uncle—after the divorce, we don’t speak. But my aunt believes every word. And the way she tells it, I almost believe it too.
