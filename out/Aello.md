My grandfather spent nearly four decades working in construction—his career stretching from the gritty late 1960s all the way to the early 2000s. He helped raise skylines from dust and concrete, hoisting sheets of glass high into the air, maneuvering rebar through skeletons of steel, his hands calloused and his back bent beneath the weight of a city being born.

He was proud of his work. Proud of the sweat, the danger, and the laughter shared between men balancing hundreds of feet above the ground. Every visit to my grandparents’ house was like stepping into a time capsule; he'd sit me down with a twinkle in his eye and transport me to those towering heights with stories—some about the brutal cold biting through work gloves, others about coworkers pulling pranks that nearly sent someone off the edge, and many about just how different the world looked from up there.

He stopped working in 2004. The hard years caught up to him—his body worn, his hands forever marked by labor. But even after he retired, his mind wandered back to those days. And whenever I visited, he was eager to take me with him, in story if not in person.

Most of those stories live warmly in my memory. But one, in particular, never let go.

He told it to me when he was older—much older. I was just starting to become a teenager, and he was starting to forget things. Early dementia had begun to dull his sharp memory, but this story came out with such clarity, such force, that it froze [me.It](http://me.It) was one of the last times I saw him lucid.

We were in his room. He was lying in bed, the afternoon light creeping through the blinds, and I remember thinking how thin he'd gotten. His voice was soft, almost fragile, but when he began speaking, something shifted. His hands gripped the bedsheets with such force that his knuckles turned white. His eyes—those same eyes that once scanned steel beams for danger—were filled not with nostalgia, but something far darker.

Fear.

At first, I thought it was one of those moments—an old man slipping into hallucinations. Dementia, I told myself. Just another fragment of a crumbling mind.

But the longer I sat with his story, the more it burrowed into me. I’ve replayed it countless times in my head, dissecting each word, each expression. And the fear in his eyes—the kind you can't fake, not even in confusion—never left me.

So now, I’ll try to do what he did so often for me: tell a story. But this one isn’t just another worksite memory or a funny tale about a missing lunchbox. This is something else. Something that followed him long after the job was done.

I will try, as best I can, to retell what my grandfather told me that day…

It was the middle of September, he said. Still warm, but not stifling. Sixty-five degrees exactly—something that struck me, even then, as oddly specific. He couldn’t remember where he’d left his glasses the day before, but he could recall the temperature on a rooftop from decades ago.

They were working on a skyscraper in Manhattan. Not an office this time, but one of those glossy new luxury high-rises—the kind with marble kitchens no one cooks in and views that cost more than most people’s lives.

He was on the crew laying concrete. That day, they were reinforcing rebar and pouring the mix, smoothing the bones of what would become someone's $12 million penthouse floor.

There were five of them that day: my grandfather, his longtime friend Jose—a wiry Puerto Rican guy with a loud laugh and a mean poker hand. Then there was Curly, who my grandfather described as a heavyset man with hands like catcher’s mitts, though I’d never heard his name before. Rounding out the crew were two others—Jackie and Connor—names unfamiliar, but said with a certain pause, like their presence alone changed something in the memory.

The work was steady. Slow. The kind of day where every movement felt heavier, not from exhaustion, but from atmosphere. The sky was clear. The wind light. From their perch, New York spilled out in every direction—a vast hive of glass and noise and speed.

The end of the shift was near. The sun dipped low, casting long shadows across the steel bones around them. Rush hour had begun below, the honks and engines echoing upward, bouncing off the unfinished walls like a distant symphony of chaos.

My grandfather stood near the edge, watching the city move. He always said it looked like an anthill from up there—tiny people, tiny cars, all moving in frantic, unknowable patterns. Jose was beside him, talking about home life—about his son starting school, about maybe switching to night shifts. The kind of talk that feels too mundane to remember, and yet, somehow, he did.

Behind them, Curly, Jackie, and Connor were packing up their tools, moving toward the lift.

“Hey, Paul,” Curly called, his voice echoing hollow through the raw bones of the unfinished hallway. “See about the walkie. The elevator was slow today.”

My grandfather gave a short nod, lips pressed in a line, and unclipped the bulky walkie-talkie from his belt. He raised it to his mouth, thumb pressing the voice button with a sharp *click*.

“Lift crew, this is floor thirty-six. You guys got eyes on the cage? She’s been dragging.”

He released the button. Static answered back.

Not the rough kind, either—not the usual crackle of a signal wrestling through steel and concrete—but *flat* static. Empty. The kind of silence that felt deliberate.

He turned, eyebrows twitching upward, and met the uncertain gazes of the other men. Jose leaned against a column of rebar, one boot kicked up behind him like he’d been waiting for something to break the monotony. Jackie stood near the wall, arms crossed, while Connor kept pacing like a dog just barely keeping its temper.

A second call. Then a third.

Still nothing.

By the fifth try, the silence didn’t just feel technical—it felt *off*. Like it was holding its breath.

“Damn it,” Connor spat, loud enough to slap off the concrete walls. “Are they sittin’ on their asses or what?”

My grandfather exhaled slow through his nose, lips pursed tight. He walked to the service panel, thumbed the *CALL LIFT* button once. Then twice. Then a third time—tapping with more insistence each time, like maybe he could summon the thing through sheer stubbornness.

Nothing.

Not even the flicker of that tiny red light.

He turned toward the others. They were watching now, more alert. Jose pushed off the column. Jackie straightened up. Even Curly, normally all slow drawl and easy weight, was on edge, his eyes narrowed like a man bracing for a joke that wasn’t funny.

“Alright,” my grandfather muttered, voice low, calm in a way that told you he’d been through worse, even if he didn’t believe it. “I’ll keep trying the radio. Just in case. But if the cage ain’t moving, we might be here a while.”

He walked down the hall toward the stairwell—just a framed-out opening with a wooden door that had yet to be hung—and pulled it open with a groan of rusted hinges.

The stairs—there *were* stairs. But they didn’t start where they should’ve. No landing. No concrete step rising to meet them. Just a gaping void. A drop that fell fifteen, maybe twenty feet, down to a lower platform still half-formed, scattered with rebar and loose gravel.

“Shit,” Jackie breathed behind him, peeking over his shoulder. “We jump, we’re snapping something.”

My grandfather flipped through the radio channels with the quiet, methodical frustration of a man who’d lived through too many systems failing at the wrong time. Static rose and fell like breath, interrupted only by his calm voice cutting through different frequencies:

“Any crew on thirty-six. Anyone on site? Elevator’s stuck. Need status or an alternate route.”

Click. Static. Click again.

“Security? Maintenance? We’ve got five up here. No safe way down.”

Click.

Nothing.

The sun was sinking behind the city, turning the sky into a palette of burning oranges and bruised purples. That soft, amber light caught the glass skeletons of neighboring skyscrapers and made them shimmer like they were on fire. The Chrysler Building, far off in the distance, reflected the light like it had been dipped in gold. From where they sat, the city looked beautiful.

Unreachable. Untouchable.

My grandfather sat down on a stack of drywall, one heavy boot resting on a concrete block, the walkie resting useless in his lap. He turned the knob again—another channel. Another dead line. Static played like white noise in his ears.

Jose sat beside him, chewing on half of a stale granola bar he'd fished out of his lunchbox. “You’d think for a billion-dollar building,” he muttered with his mouth full, “someone could make a damn elevator that works.”

My grandfather chuckled, the sound dry in his throat. “It’s all for show, man. Fancy lobby, million-dollar view, and nothing under the hood but rust and prayer.”

Curly had found a spot in the corner, slumped against a pile of insulation rolls, snoring soft and steady—his heavy frame rising and falling like a slow tide.

Jackie and Connor were moving back and forth through the floor, muttering, cursing, opening closets and prying open supply crates. They were looking for anything—*anything*—that could help them climb down to the stairwell platform. Rope, cabling, even rebar long enough to wedge into something. But the floor had been stripped nearly clean. Everything useful had either been hauled down or never made it up this high.

Above them, the framework for floors thirty-seven through thirty-nine stretched upward like ribs of a sleeping giant. Dark, skeletal, unfinished. No one liked going up there unless they had to. No flooring yet. No lights. Just open air and shadows between steel beams.

“We’ll get to it,” the foreman had said weeks earlier. “Eventually.”

Eventually never came fast enough in construction.

Jose finished his granola and brushed the crumbs from his jeans. “Well,” he said, voice light, almost joking, “what you thinkin’?”

My grandfather just sat there, jaw clenched, eyes scanning the horizon as the last of the sun slid beneath the city’s edge. It wasn’t an emergency—not yet. Nobody was hurt. No fire. Just five guys stuck thirty-six floors up with no way down and a radio that wouldn’t talk back.

“Someone’ll notice,” he said finally. “Wife’ll call, someone’ll get worried. Worst case, we wait it out. Sun’ll rise. Crew’ll see we’re still up here.”

He tried to sound confident. Reassuring.

But even he admitted later—*something felt wrong*.

He made a quiet joke about my grandmother’s meatloaf. Said he was missing dinner and she’d kill him if the leftovers got cold. He started telling Jose how she always added too much ketchup on top, but somehow it worked, like some dark alchemy passed down through generations.

He smiled when he said it. And for a moment, it felt normal again.

Until Jose spoke.

“…What the hell is that?”

His voice wasn’t loud. But it was sharp. Cut through the comfort like a nail through drywall.

My grandfather turned.

Jose wasn’t looking at him. He was staring down the hallway, eyes locked on the floor just past a shaft of sunlight slanting in through the open framework.

There, on the bare concrete floor, lay a feather.

It was huge—nearly a foot long, and as wide as a grown man’s hand. The light caught on the edges of it, revealing a strange mix of colors: smoky gray streaked with deep blue, almost iridescent. Like oil on water. The kind of color that shifts when you move. Too clean to be from a pigeon. Too vibrant for a hawk.

At first, my grandfather didn’t clock it. Birds make nests in high places. They fly into the rafters. Shit everywhere. It happens.

But then he stood.

He walked over, boots echoing in the quiet, and picked it up.

Soft on the surface, yes—but the spine down the center was thick, coarser than it should’ve been. Almost like cartilage. It flexed just slightly in his hand, too heavy for something that should be carried on wind.

Jose stood beside him now, his brow furrowed.

“What the hell kind of bird has feathers like that?” he asked, turning it in his fingers.

My grandfather didn’t answer.

Because even then, he was looking up—eyes scanning the exposed beams and shadows of the unfinished ceiling.

Looking for a hawk. Or some monster-sized pigeon. Just steel. Empty scaffolding.

The sound cracked through the half-finished floor like a gunshot—**THUD.**

Then came the scream.

My grandfather was on his feet before the echo faded, the strange feather forgotten as it fluttered from his hands. Jose shot up with him, both of them already moving, boots pounding against concrete as they sprinted toward the sound.

Curly jerked awake from the insulation pile, his face slack with confusion, eyes not yet caught up with reality. “What the hell—?”

“It’s Connor!” Jose shouted over his shoulder. “C’mon!”

Curly swore and scrambled up, heavy steps trailing behind them like rolling thunder.

The sound had come from the eastern wing—a room not yet walled in, still a hollow echo chamber of exposed studs and future intention. The hallway twisted around a half-poured stairwell and opened into a wide chamber where dusk poured in from three open sides.

Connor was on the ground, his leg twisted in a way that no leg should ever bend. The ankle was a grotesque knot—swollen and already turning the deep purple of a fresh break. Jackie stood behind him, one hand clutching the top of his head like he was trying to keep something inside, eyes wide and wild.

Connor was gasping, each breath sharp and shallow, like he was trying not to cry out again. But his eyes… his *eyes* were locked on the unfinished ceiling above them, wide with something far worse than pain.

“Connor,” my grandfather said, kneeling beside him. “Hey. Talk to me. What happened?”

Jackie spoke first, voice shaking as he pointed upward. “We—we thought we saw a ladder up there. Just sticking out of the next floor. Connor said he remembered one being left behind last week, so I— I boosted him up, just to check, y’know?”

He paused, hand still on his scalp, fingertips now streaked with a smear of blood. “I lifted him, he got high enough to grab the ledge, and then—then he started screaming.”

Jose helped ease Connor’s head down, trying not to look at the ankle.

Then Connor spoke.

His voice was strained, like it took everything he had just to push out the words. “*Eyes*,” he rasped. “Why… why did it have so many *eyes*?”

Everyone went still.

The word hung in the room like dust in sunlight.

Only the wind moved, whistling softly through the unfinished windows, carrying with it the distant hum of a city that had no idea five men were trapped above it, sharing space with something they didn’t understand.

My grandfather felt something shift in the air then. Not a breeze—something heavier. A pressure. Like a presence had entered the room without making a sound.

He looked up.

The ceiling gaped open above them—floor thirty-seven a jagged mess of shadows and girders. No lights. No signs of movement. Nothing visible. But somehow, impossibly, the room felt *watched*.

Connor refused to blink. His gaze was still pinned to the dark.

The three men looked over at Connor. Their expressions confused. Jose spoke up. “What are you talking about?”

Connor’s eyes didn’t move. Didn’t blink. Didn’t stray from the black ribcage of floor thirty-seven above them, as though some invisible thread were pulling his gaze up and refusing to let it go.

Jose crouched low beside him, glancing anxiously between the injured man’s leg and the vacant ceiling. Jackie hovered near the far wall, one hand smeared red from where he’d gripped his own scalp too tightly.

Then Jose looked around. “Curley?” he called out, voice sharp. “Where the hell did he go?”

Jackie’s head jerked up. My grandfather turned quickly. For a moment, they all just stood there—realizing, slowly, in that awful, dawning way—that Curley wasn’t with them anymore.

“He was right behind us,” Jose muttered, almost to himself.

“He *ran in with us*,” my grandfather said, like saying it out loud would make it true.

“Curley, get in here!” my grandfather shouted toward the hallway. “We need help!”

No response. Just the low hum of the city far below and the soft hiss of wind curling through unfinished walls.

Jose glanced up at my grandfather, a silent exchange passing between them: *You stay. I’ll go.*

With a steadying breath, my grandfather turned and stepped back into the corridor.

“Curley!” he called again, his voice rougher this time. “This is no time to be screwing around!”

The hall stretched long and cold before him. The lantern light from the main room faded behind him, swallowed by the darkness that now fully owned the tower. The sun was gone, dipped beyond the skyline, and with it went the warmth, the visibility, and the illusion of safety.

He turned a corner.

The air was different here—still, heavy. The way it feels when a thunderstorm is just about to break.

Another feather.

This one wasn’t like the last. It was longer. Black at the edges, fading to a deep navy blue near the spine. It fluttered once as it landed gently on the floor, as if something above had only just released it.

My grandfather slowed his steps, approaching it cautiously. His boots crunched faintly on loose dust and gravel.

He looked up.

Just raw steel and hanging cables, swaying slightly in the breeze. The feather lay perfectly still at his feet, soft against the harsh, unfinished concrete.

Behind him, he could hear Connor’s cries echoing faintly—sharp with pain, but lower now. Fading.

The sound of the city felt distant. The kind of silence that only exists when you’re truly alone.

The work lanterns flickered behind him, casting his shadow long across the hallway.

The feather was cold. Not just to the touch, but in the way metal left out in the winter feels, like it remembered some deeper cold it had come from. The barbed quill pricked slightly as my grandfather turned it in his fingers.

Still, he walked back toward the others, holding it loosely at his side. The work lanterns buzzed softly behind him, their yellow light flickering.

He stepped into the open room where the others were gathered—Connor still lying on the floor, Jose crouched beside him trying to soothe him back to coherence. Jackie sat nearby, a bloodied towel pressed to the back of his head, his breathing shallow and fast.

“Hey, boys,” my grandfather called out, holding up the feather, “any of you know a bird with feathers like *this*?”

Jackie squinted at it, his eyes unfocused at first. But once they locked in, his lips parted. His expression went blank for a heartbeat—then cold. Jose turned too. And when he saw what my grandfather was holding, the shift in him was immediate.

“Where’s Curley?” he asked, sharply.

My grandfather shook his head. “Didn’t find him. Just this.”

He handed the feather to Jackie, who took it hesitantly, holding it like something that might bite. Jose’s eyes didn’t leave the thing. They followed every movement of it like it was alive.

Then Connor—still shaking, still pale—*looked away* from the ceiling for the first time since the fall.

His eyes found the feather in Jackie’s hands. And he *panicked*.

It was instant. Primal. His limbs flailed as he tried to crawl backward across the floor, dragging his ruined ankle behind him like it didn’t exist.

“No, no, no,” he kept muttering, his voice shrill with terror. “Get it away. *Get it away from me.*”

All three of the other men froze.

My grandfather stepped toward him. “Connor,” he said, calmly, “why does this feather scare you?”

But Connor wouldn’t answer. Couldn’t. He just kept crawling, clawing at the ground to get away, his eyes wide and filled with some terror the rest of them couldn’t yet see. 

That’s when my grandfather paused—*telling me this story years later*, sitting on the edge of his bed, his hands trembling slightly in his lap. Rubbing the heels of his palms into his eyes, like he was trying to push out a memory that had embedded itself too deep.

He was walking toward Connor, slowly, when—

**It hit.**

*Fast.* Too fast.

A *blur* of motion, blacker than the dark around it—shot down from floor thirty-seven like a bullet.

There was a screech from *Jackie*, who barely had time to look up before it *hit* him. In a blink, it had him.

Something snatched the back of Jackie’s neck like he weighed *nothing*, lifted him straight off his feet, and *yanked him up* into the ceiling.

Gone.

No crash. No fight. Just the awful, impossible sound of bones cracking as Jackie disappeared into the steel shadows above—into that unfinished level that no one had wanted to explore.

The feather slipped from Jackie’s hand, tumbling silently through the stale air like a piece of ash. It drifted to the floor and landed softly on the concrete, right where he’d been standing a heartbeat before—before something unthinkable had torn him away. It stayed there for a moment, delicate and out of place, before the wind caught it and pulled it slowly toward the open edge of the floor. Then it was gone—swept out into the darkened New York skyline like a ghost escaping into the night.

Connor was already crawling backward, dragging his ruined ankle behind him, vanishing into a cluttered maze of rebar and plywood stacked near the far wall. His breath came in short, terrified bursts. Jose and my grandfather remained rooted to the spot, staring up at the empty ceiling where Jackie had just been. The raw shock of what they’d witnessed clamped their limbs in place, their minds struggling to understand it. The silence that followed was worse than the scream—*deeper*, as if the building itself was holding its breath.

Then came the sound. From somewhere in the upper floor above them—thirty-seven—*crunching*. A low, sickening grind of something wet and final, like bones snapping between teeth. It was muffled but unmistakable. Then came the *beat* of wings. Heavy, massive, and unnatural. The gust that followed rained dust down from the open ceiling, stirring the air with a violent exhale that coated everything in a fine, choking powder.

Whatever it was, it was still up there. And it wasn’t done.

Jose broke first.

He spun around and sprinted back to where Connor had vanished behind the steel and wood. He dropped to his knees, grabbed the man by both arms, and yanked him up like a father hauling a child out of danger. “*We are leaving!*” he shouted, his voice ragged and cracking as he shook Connor hard enough to jolt him back to awareness.

My grandfather was already moving. Something inside him had snapped loose—the survival instinct that every hard man on the job site learns to trust when heavy steel starts to fall. And this? This was heavier than anything he’d ever felt. He rushed to Jose’s side, got one arm under Connor’s shoulder, and without exchanging a word, the two men lifted their friend and started running.

They didn’t stop to look up. They didn’t stop to think.

Whatever was up there—whatever had taken Jackie—was beyond understanding. But they knew enough. And that was all they needed.

With Connor limping between them, his arms slung over their shoulders, the three men made their way through the skeletal floor. The night pressed in on all sides, thick and suffocating. A heavy silence followed them, broken only by Connor’s ragged breaths and the distant groan of shifting steel.

They made a choice, unspoken but understood.

They would take the stairs.

Even if it meant falling.Even if something was waiting for them in the dark below. Because whatever had taken Jackie... wasn’t human.

They reached the stairwell—a crude, unfinished doorway cut into raw concrete. There was no landing. Just a drop. Fifteen feet, maybe more, down to a lower platform scattered with gravel, debris, and twisted rebar.

My grandfather stepped to the edge and peered down, trying to gauge the safest way to get all three of them down without breaking something else.

Jose leaned over beside him, his voice low but steady. “We could lower ourselves down from the edge. Hang off the frame, drop the last few feet. Take it on our asses.”

My grandfather gave a tight nod. It wasn’t a good plan—but it was a plan. And right now, that was enough.

My grandfather stepped to the edge of the broken stairwell, the open void yawning beneath them like a mouth. He leaned forward just enough to judge the distance. Fifteen feet, maybe a bit more. Jagged rebar jutted from the lower platform, and gravel lay scattered across the concrete like broken glass. One wrong move could shatter a knee—or worse. He scanned the space, mind racing through possibilities, none of them good.

Jose came up beside him, quiet but calm. “We could lower ourselves from the lip,” he murmured. “Hang off the frame, then drop. Just take it on our asses.”

My grandfather nodded—tight, reluctant. It wasn’t safe. It wasn’t smart. But it was a plan. And right now, that made it the best one they had.

Then it came again—a sound that seemed to suck the warmth from the room.

A screech, distant but rising like it had found their scent. Followed by a heavy thud, muffled through drywall and sheets of hanging plastic. Something had landed nearby. Not walked. Landed.

Something was looking for them.

Without a word, my grandfather turned to Jose. “Go first,” he said.

Jose hesitated, only for a second.

The logic was simple: if someone was already down below, they'd be there to catch Connor—or at least break his fall. And if something followed them... they needed to move fast.

Jose stepped up to the ledge, grabbed the steel lip with both hands, and eased himself over the edge until he was hanging by his arms. He took one sharp breath—then let go.

The impact was ugly.

He landed hard, gravel sliding under his boots. Most of the fall hit his lower back, and he dropped to one knee with a choked cry. The sound cut through the silence like a flare gun. And somewhere behind them, something responded.

My grandfather turned just as Connor did, both of them looking back down the hallway they’d come from.

A shadow stretched across the floor—long, broad, and wrong.

Then it stepped into the light.

It filled the doorway.

The creature was the size of a horse, but far more unnatural. Feathers covered its body—thick, oil-slicked plumage that shimmered in the dark like bruised metal. The wings—two vast hawk-like appendages—shuddered against its sides, flexing with slow menace.

But it was the face that made my grandfather freeze.

In the center of its chest, where a head should be, was a porcelain-white mask shaped like a woman's face. Serene. Delicate. Dainty. But wrong. So wrong.

It blinked.

Or rather—eyes blinked.

Dozens of them, shifting and rippling across the surface of the mask like a school of fish moving beneath still water. All green. All watching.

Then its mouth opened.

Not a mouth—an abyss. A spiral of teeth. Layer after layer, spinning into darkness. No throat. No tongue. Just a vortex built to consume.

Connor screamed.

Connor started to thrash in my grandfather’s arms, yelling, his voice raw and panicked. The strength in him surged from terror, making it nearly impossible for my grandfather to keep a grip on his flailing body. He shot a glance down at Connor, trying to calm him—just for a second. But that second was a mistake. Because when he looked back up, the hallway was no longer empty. The beast had already leapt. A blur of feathers and motion, its wings outstretched and talons extended, it soared toward them with a silent, terrifying grace. There was no time to think, no time to run—only the split-second realization that it was already too late. 

My grandfather felt himself falling through the air, and felt white hot pain radiate through his back when he landed. His eyes are a blur. He saw from the stairwell entrance the beast with Connor locked in its jaws. Grabbing him by the midsection, teeth digging into his glutes and lower back. It raised it’s head up and folded his body like he was touching his toes. Crunching and biting into Connor until his cries were muted inside the beast. 

Jose didn’t hesitate. The moment Connor disappeared into that thing’s jaws—his screams crushed into wet silence—Jose grabbed my grandfather by the back of his shirt and dragged him out of the stairwell like a man hauling dead weight from a burning building. My grandfather was half-conscious, dazed from the fall, his body shrieking with pain and coated in dust and sweat. The sound behind them was deafening: the thunderclap of wings in too-tight space, the scrape of claws against metal, the rush of air as something enormous forced itself into the stairwell after them. Gravel and chunks of loose concrete blasted outward as the creature surged down, the stairwell trembling under its weight. My grandfather could barely move—couldn’t tell if he was screaming or breathing or just gasping for any kind of clarity—but Jose never stopped. He pulled him through the stairwell door and into the corridor of the 65th floor.

This level was different. Unlike the skeletal floors above, the sixty-fifth had begun to take shape—a half-constructed model of luxury that would one day distract its occupants from the city’s noise. Polished drywall had been hung in some places, marble tile laid in others. There were light fixtures, furniture still wrapped in plastic, a few soft carpets strewn across the floor like they’d been thrown there in a hurry. It wasn’t finished, but it felt like civilization—like safety.

Jose slammed the stairwell door shut behind them. He didn’t speak. Just locked it, shoved a tool cart in front of it with trembling hands, and dropped to the ground beside my grandfather, gasping for air. The door shuddered once—violently—but it didn’t open. Whatever was on the other side didn’t break through.

My grandfather said his memory blurred after that. Moments came in flashes. Jose digging through his pockets for a phone he wasn’t even sure he still had. The faint bars of reception blinking into life. The 911 operator’s voice, tinny and disbelieving. The sound of sirens far, far below—too far to matter at first, but still real. Jose dragging him further away from the stairwell, muttering curses in Spanish, muttering prayers, muttering nonsense—anything to keep himself from breaking.

That’s where the story ended. My grandfather never said what happened to the thing—or how they got down. Maybe he didn’t know. Maybe he didn’t want to remember. When he finished telling me, he just sat there on the edge of the bed, his fingers twitching against the blanket. He looked tired. Hollowed out. His eyes flicked toward the window, then toward the ceiling, then back to me—but didn’t quite meet my gaze.

And then, just like that, the fear in his face softened. He blinked, like waking up from a long nap, and said, in a completely different voice, “Y’know what I could go for right now? A little fudge. That kind your grandmother keeps in the tin.”

The shift was so jarring I didn’t know what to say. I just nodded, got up, and went to the kitchen to find the tin. As I walked away, I could still feel his story clinging to the room like smoke—thick, bitter, and impossible to forget.

That story had stuck with me for years, lingering in the back of my mind like a shadow I couldn’t quite shake. It wasn’t just the horror of what my grandfather described—it was the raw, lingering fear in his voice, the way his eyes darkened whenever he retold it. For a long time, I pushed it aside, unsure if I wanted to know more or just let it remain a mysterious, unsettling memory. But just the other day, something clicked.

I found myself compelled to dig deeper, to see if any part of it was real. I sat down at my computer and began scouring the internet, typing in every detail I could remember about the building—the floors, the location, anything that might connect to what my grandfather said. I poured through old newspaper archives, searching for stories about construction accidents, disappearances, or strange sightings tied to that tower. Part of me was desperate to find proof it was true, while another part dreaded uncovering something darker than I could handle. Still, I kept digging, driven by the need to understand what had haunted my grandfather—and maybe, in some way, to finally make sense of the nightmare he lived through.

After hours of digging through dusty archives and faded headlines, I finally stumbled upon a small article buried in the back pages of a 2003 newspaper. The headline was cold and clinical: “Men Left Stranded in Construction Zone.” The story told of five men trapped at the top of a half-finished building—a construction site left abandoned unexpectedly. 

Three of those men were never found. Their disappearances were swallowed up by the noise of bigger crimes and tragedies happening in New York at the time, pushed aside and forgotten by the public. But as I read on, one particular detail near the end of the article sent a sharp chill down my spine. It read:

**“The search for the three missing construction workers continues across New York City. Authorities have promised to provide updates as new information becomes available. So far, the only leads have come from the two surviving workers, whose accounts describe an unusual creature at the site. However, officials have stated that there is no concrete evidence to support these claims.**

**Researchers did report discovering an unusual, large nest made of sticks and twigs near the upper levels of the construction site, along with feathers that appeared to belong to a sizable bird. Inside the nest were three eggs, which authorities have neither confirmed nor denied as related to the disappearance.**

**Government representatives have declined to comment further on these findings, citing restrictions on discussing ongoing investigations. As of now, the mystery surrounding the missing men remains unresolved.”**
