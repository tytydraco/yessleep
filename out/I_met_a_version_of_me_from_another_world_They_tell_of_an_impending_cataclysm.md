I used to think I was pretty normal. Just another guy in his mid 30s, working my 9 to 5 and going home to my beautiful wife and kids. Life sure does have a strange way of working itself out sometimes. I had been your everyday stereotypical anime/nerd type in high school, getting picked on and harassed everyday. It turns out my crush at the time, this stunningly beautiful girl who always hung out with the cool kids, was in fact a pretty big nerd herself.

Sparing all the details of course, we ended up together, married and with two amazing kids. Been together almost 10 years now. Yeah, life sure is strange alright. At least, that's what I thought, before I started thinking it was downright crazy.

"Alright Erick, it's come to my attention you've gotten some customer complaints over the last few weeks", my boss said. Pulling me into a room shortly after arriving at work. I worked a fairly simple and easy job at a local retail store, not too far away from where I lived. My boss looked extra pissed than he normally did.

"If you keep up with this attitude of yours, we're gonna have to dock your pay, or worse", he spoke sternly. I winced and nodded in agreement, despite knowing how full of shit he was. Must have been my manager trying to earn brownie points from the dissatisfied customer who reported me. Oh well. I've always been pretty timid and non-confrontational where I worked, so I knew the claim was BS.

As my day went on, however, I got a call on my phone. Still at work as my boss was leering at me from a distance, I quickly shuffled to tap the screen and decline the call. As I read the caller ID however, I remained frozen, eyes locked to the screen. Unwilling or perhaps unable to look away. It was... me?

Quickly I stuffed my phone back in my pocket, as my manager rounded back to check on me. He really had it out for me that day, can't say why. "I'm keeping my eye on you, Erick", he spoke again briefly, as he left for his office.

"Bad day, huh?", my wife spoke up from the dinner table. Damn, I must've really blanked out the rest of that day. "Yeah...", I said, lifting up my fork, "Boss is riding my ass again, how was your day?"

"Oh, it was okay", she replied. "Kids and I took a vacation day down to the local water park", she paused to take another bite. "You look really shaken up, Erick. Are you sure you're okay?".

"Yeah, I'm fine Denise",  I lied. "Just a bad headache or something". Deliberately being vague as to not worry her further. By the time dinner was done and the kids were tucked in, I was already laid back on my recliner, sipping a cold beer and watching TV. 

"Another late night then?", Denise piped up from the stairs. "Yeah, sorry hon. Just want to catch the news before bed, love you", I spoke softly. "Love you too!", she playfully quipped back. Dear god I love that woman, but I couldn't shake what I saw on my phone earlier. It just had me shaken from the moment I saw it. At the time perhaps I thought my mind was playin tricks on me. I wish that was all it had been.

The following day I awoke. My wife had already been at work and the kids were picked up for school. Denise had left me a note on the counter, hoping I'd have a good day, and that there was some medicine for me if I still felt bad. Smiling as I grabbed the note and took the small pill, I headed out the door and left for work. 

Sparing too many more details, it was another slow day. Thankfullywith a less annoying manager on duty as I slogged through the day. As I left my shift and prepared to head home, I saw a bright light in the sky fall down just past the horizon. Surprised by the phenomena, I called out to the people walking beside me. "Holy cow, you guys see that light flying down just now?", I exclaimed. "Must've been a meteor or something...". The people next to me looked a mixture of surprised and confused. Like they thought I was telling a story or actin crazy. I brushed it off and headed home.

"Daddy, look what I got!", my daughter spoke. We had been enjoying our family meal as always, and my sweet little Ericka piped up, showing me a drawing she made in class. My wife had hoped our firstborn would be a son, so we would name him after me. We decided to name her Ericka, as it seemed similar enough to my own name.

"Wow, that looks great sweetie!", I replied. Smiling ear to ear as she held it up for me to look at. She had drawn me a pretty purple elephant. Of course, it looked nothing like an elephant, but what else can you expect from an 8 year old girl. I gave her a big kiss and pinned the drawing up on the wall by our kitchen. I would always see it walking into the house.

The night continued on. My wife and I tucking in the kids and sharing our own moment of intimacy. I decided I'd stay up later and maybe watch a few episodes of an anime I was currently watching. This was my guilty pleasure since I had no work the following day. As it turned out, I don't think I would have ended up there anyway.

A knock came at my door. Mind you, the time was close to 1AM, so I was very nervous at first. Either a solicitor, a homeless man or someone coming to rob us. The thought of it being any one of those things sent a chill down my spine. Nevertheless, we had ourselves a peephole in the door, so before I made any brash decisions, I decided I would peep through it to see who was knocking so late.

The man I saw on the other end looked... exactly like me. In almost every single way. His brown shaggy hair, the 2 moles on his left cheek, even the whole shape of his face. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. "Uh, hello? Who are you, what do you want?", I choked out. Trying to contain my confusion. 

"It's me, Erick. Or I guess, I'm you. Open up, I gotta talk to you", he replied. He spoke as calmly and professionally as any other person would to a total stranger. It sounded like the most normal thing in the world to him. "Come on man, I'm freezing my ass off out here", he spoke again.

I pressed my forehead to the door, and clenched my eyes shut. Trying to get a hold of myself. Trying to shake off whatever hallucination I was experiencing right now. This just couldn't be real. I looked back up into the peephole, and sure enough, he was still there. Looking more agitated than before.

"I don't think...", I trailed off before being interrupted. "Look man, I know this is weird for you. Hell it's weird for me too, just let me in so we can talk this out". Every fiber of my being told me not to open this door. Hell, I had a family to look after. But I couldn't shake this nagging feeling in the back of my mind. Like something about him was... trustworthy.

It took me another minute, but I opened the door. Gesturing at the man to stay quiet since my family was asleep. I allowed him inside and we both walked into the kitchen together. My apparent twin had been slightly covered in snow and shivering. "Thanks, I was worried I'd freeze to death out there", he said. "You got any-", I interrupted him. Not being the confrontational type, it took a lot for me to muster up the words.

"Alright, who the hell are you, man?", I yelled back in a quiet hush. "You look exactly like me, what are you my long-lost twin or something?". I was in no mood to play games. Inviting this stranger into my home was bad enough. Denise would kill me if she found out.

"No, no, nothing like that", he replied. "I'm you, Erick. I'm the same man who grew up watching all that nerdy anime shit, getting bullied by Patrick, getting hit on by that pretty cheerleader." He went on. "I know it's hard to believe, but I am you...", he paused for a moment. "I'm the light you saw in the sky".

"What the hell does that mean? Are you saying you're a time traveller or something?", I spoke back incredulously. "Yes... and no.", he replied. "I'm sort of like a copy... of the present you." He waved his hands around on the table, in motions that were difficult to follow. Attempting to explain this in a better way. "Think of it like there are multiple timelines, and multiple universes. I'm just another one of you", he said fervently.

This was all a lot to take in. I was naturally skeptical but I just couldn't believe he was lying to me. He knew everything about me. He even knew about the things I repressed from my childhood. That, and he looked like me. But why? All of this explained how he got here, but not why he was here.

"Okay, so if you're me from another time or whatever", I replied back. "Then what are you doing here? Why are you in my house on a Friday night at 1AM?", I asked. "To tell you the truth, I'm not sure why I keep coming back here. Maybe it's the nostalgia... or the sense of wanting all of this.", he motioned around my home. "Family. Security. Love."

"What's that supposed to mean?", I asked with even more caution than before. "Well, in my time, something really bad happened. I managed to get away in one of the many time capsules our people carried, and managed to get plopped down in your world", his voice started to shake. "They called it the reckoning. No one where I'm from knows quite how it happened, but...", he paused, tears starting to well up in his eyes. "Our entire world was split in two, and I do mean that quite literally."

Stunned and perplexed at the same time, I replied, "Your world was split in half? How? Why?"

"I don't have those answers Erick", he interrupted, now with more anger in his voice. "The world I'm from is identical to yours in every way. Only issue is, I came here from a doomed one, after watching my entire family die", he slammed his fist on the table. "To try and prevent it from happening here!"

"Here?", I replied. "It's gonna happen here too?" Sitting down at the table, I pondered everything I had just sat through up to this point. If I was hallucinating or going crazy, I had hoped this ride would've ended already. "I've already visited other worlds, Erick", he spoke again. "Many, many others just like this one. Where we're from, our method of travelling isn't permanent.", he looked down. "There's no easy way to explain it but eventually, I'll get sucked back into my world and likely die as a result". 

I leaned forward in my seat. "This is a whole lot to lay on me man, but I still don't know why you're telling me all this". 

"Isn't it obvious? To save our...", he paused. "Your family". Getting up from his seat, he went on to start looking at all our family photos we had hung up on the wall. Stopping to admire all of their faces. "I may not be able to stop this cataclysm, but the least I can do is warn you".

"Warn me? Hell, if something like the earth splitting in half is going to happen, then what good does a warning do me?", I spoke sarcastically. The other me looked back dishearteningly. He must've known it was pointless, or he just hadn't thought that far ahead. I had sympathy for him. He was me after all, and he had lost everything. I don't know what I'd do if this happened to me.

"I can't stay, but you should know one other thing", he spoke. "Of all the other worlds I've visited, there was one in which the reckoning did not claim the lives of our family". 

"How was that?", I asked. For the first time he'd offered me a gem of respite. Something that didn't sound as bleak. "You died", he replied.

"I died? How exactly? What killed me? I need to know!", I answered back angrily. Not caring that my voice may wake up Denise. "I don't know", he replied in a monotone voice. "I can't even say whether your death is what stopped it altogether, but I do know that your death saved them initially". He walked back towards me. "Would you not die, to save the ones you love?".

All of a sudden, I felt a sharp pain enter my skull. A pain so intense that I started to scream. "You know the funny thing about you humans?", the man spoke. "You're very easy to manipulate". The man slowoly walked towards me and placed his hand on my head. The pain becoming even more intense as he did so. "Your family will survive this coming war, but you will not".

All of a sudden, the man's eyes, face and mouth are all contorted into a cacophony of teeth, hair, razor wire and a black substance with the consistency of sludge. The man slowly walks inside and assimilates me into his being. I am now Erick.

I find the accounts of this human so interesting, I feel I should document them. After all, what's another way to pass the time while this timeline is stricken from existence? You were all warned never to enter space. Never to send your satellites and communicators through the veil of nothingness. Now a war shall start, and we shall be your undoing.

This blue marble you call Earth shall be destroyed, and assimilated like all the rest. We are coming. We are inevitable.
