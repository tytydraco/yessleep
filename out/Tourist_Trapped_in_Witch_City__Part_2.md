To my surprise, it seems some people are interested in my job from hell. At least to me it's hell, but if I am given a soap box to stand on; I might as well start singing. I have quite a few work horror stories I could talk about, not to mention all those entries from my boss’s “Incident” journals. I realistically could transcribe some of those if I learn I won’t be held legally liable for leaking trade secrets or something. Best not to touch those until further notice. Regardless, I should start from the beginning. How did someone like me end up in a place like this? Let me start before those 2 girls got shot, even further before that time I hid under the counter waiting for the cops. Starting from the absolute beginning might help explain my job description to those unfamiliar with my current line of work.

  
A year ago I graduated from college. I graduated an extra year later than the rest of my peers. Half way through college, I began to realize I hated my major and making a 17 year old choose what to do with their lives was one of the dumbest things society has to offer an almost-adult. It was cheaper to just finish my degree and start from zero at some job. Broke, lost, and with a useless degree, I was desperate. Rent was due and I had no car. I sure as hell wasn’t going to take the buses again given how unreliable they always were. The train wasn’t much of an option either given all of the stops before the city were in residential areas.

  
I began applying to all those gimmicky stores around the area. I just needed something to keep me on my feet before my savings ran out. Can you even fathom how desperate I was that I would have been willing to wear the old pilgrim get up and start speaking with thou? No self respecting guy without a theater degree would ever do that, and yet there I was. Interview after interview. Denied, denied, denied. Turns out most of the stores are gimmicky mom and pop shops not really interested in hiring people that haven’t already worked in the area before. Even those expensive cafes too. All regular hires of local highschoolers whose family just happened to know the owners. I was fucked. Really fucked. Rent was really dipping into my savings, I had to stretch everything thin. Then I got a letter.

  
A follow-up letter for an interview. 

  
The letter was addressed to a place I never went to. I was in no position to turn it down. My hand was forced, I had to go. If I’m going to be real, I honestly had no idea where I was going. I put the address in my phone, and it kept redirecting me around town. I’m pretty sure I passed the same cemetery like three times but I can’t be sure. It's been so long since then, but the only reason I was skeptical of it was because the names kept changing every go around. I’m not the brightest bulb in the room so I could have just kept seeing different tombstones that looked the same from the wear and tear. I got to the house by the time the sun started to set. It was supposed to be a 20 minute walk at most. It ended up taking me an hour and a half of what felt like the same streets, brick sidewalks, houses, and cemeteries.

  
Walking in, I was admittedly starstruck. It was maximalist in every sense of the word. It’s easy to be drawn in by the smell of lavender wafting through the pine shelves. The hand crafted bowls with assorted mushrooms next to jewelry boxes ornately framed by oxidized bronze decor. Even the price tags were hand written in loving calligraphy. Whatever business was being run here, someone really cared for it. I truly did think about possibly getting something for myself in the apartment given that there seemed to be a little something for everyone.

  
Forgetting my main goal for even coming here, I roamed the store, observing the assortment of tooth collections, feathers, scales, and other oddities. They all seemed to have a thin layer of cobwebs enveloping the selection of items. It was strange how untouched the store seemed given that these would sell fast in Salem, especially with how cheap they were in comparison to other stores. Circling back to the front counter, I was immediately reminded of why I even bothered coming out here.

  
A door off to the side of the sales counter with a piece of paper on it. I walked around the long table to get a closer look. The paper was old and stained. It looked like the paper was handmade rather than the mass produced printer paper. Despite the obvious signs of age, penned in ink was an up to date schedule. My name was listed for an interview. It was just so bizarre. Everything in me was telling me to get out at that point. Something about the nature of the paper and ink being so old, yet the contents being recent and up to date felt wrong. It was like that little voice in the back of your head that tells you when someone is lying to you. Intuition I assume it is? I sat in front of this unlabeled door weighing my options. Could I even afford rent for another month? If I turn this down, could I even get food next week? Should I just move back with my parents and start over at home? I sat there, staring.

  
*Knock-knock*

  
...

  
What felt like an uncomfortable amount of silence followed by glancing around for someone to respond in the store, the door creaked open. It was slow and the creaking sounded almost painful in a way. Those hinges must have been stuck shut for years to have made the sound they did.

  
Inside the room were two simple, wooden chairs, a table that looked to be made out of driftwood, a single candle sitting in the lone window, and a cat? No one was there. No cameras, no papers, no living person other than this…cat. It almost felt like a prank. A very cliche highschooler’s prank or whatever.

  
Before I even had time to think about what was even going on, I felt something slam up against my back and knock me into the room. I tripped and fell on a nail sticking up from the floor. Lifting myself up, I realized someone slammed the door on my ass. Getting up, patting the scrapes on my knees off, I look at this cat. It’s gazed affixed with mine. It didn’t seem to flinch at the door slamming or me falling. How often did this cat see something like this happen in the store for it to be so desensitized?

  
I looked back at the door and began to attempt to open it. Nothing. I jostled the handle. Nothing. Pulled it in and out. Nothing. Banged on it to get it loose even slightly. Nothing. Not a single budge. I began knocking on the door.

  
“Hello? Is anyone outside? You locked me and your cat in here! I don’t want this cat to starve or something!”

  
Nothing.

  
My attempts at getting any help were met with a resounding nothing. I was stuck with this cat that just kept staring at me. When I turned back around, the cat was there, but it was now giving me that same little voice in the back of my head. That voice that tells you something is wrong and to get out. I just couldn’t figure out why. It was a normal cat. Yea, it stares at me funny, but what cat hasn’t? Maybe it was doing that thing where they wait for you to stop paying attention and jump on you?

  
It’s eyes though. They were ever so slightly *off*. It was like I turned my back and when I turned back around, the eyes were. Bigger? But not in the cute cat way. Like, the eyeballs were slightly too big for the eye socket. Not immediately noticeable, but maybe you’d see it after staring long enough.

  
“I’m going crazy.” I thought to myself.

  
“I’m going nuts over a cat. Is this what happens at rock bottom? You get locked in a room and you begin to lose it within a couple minutes.”

  
I turned back to the door to ignore my thoughts. I kicked and banged and slammed on that damn wooden door. I pounded with all my weight hoping for a different result other than a stiff, unrelenting, wooden door. It was only a matter of time before I just ran out of breath. It was pointless trying the door. The only give it had was giving me small splinters in my knuckles. Defeated, I slid my back down the door until I fell to the floor, picking the wood from my hands.

  
A small pattering sound came from the table. I glanced up to see that cat again. Except it had moved to the edge of the table to see me again. It stared down at me, clearly wrong this time. I don’t know how long I was banging that door, but it was enough time for that cat to become worse. Its green eyes were bubbling out from its skin. The skin teared around the now huge eyes like overstretched, ill fitting, torn fabric. It looked so painful the way the skin stretched and quietly ripped into holes over these eyes, yet it stared. Its pupils were fixed on me. The eyeball grew, but the slit pupils did not.

  
I jumped up, pounding feverishly on the door for dear life. I was frantic. This cat isn’t a cat. It wasn’t even an animal. 

  
“HELP! SOMEBODY HELP! PLEASE GET ME OUT OF HERE!” I pleaded.

  
I begged and screamed for help. A saving grace. Hell, if an angel came down and opened that door for me, I would become a proselyte in that exact moment.

  
Between my hits against the door, more leathery sounding tearing filled the room behind me. I could feel the adrenaline fill my veins. Every heartbeat I could feel in my arms as my legs lost feeling. That fucking door would not give. No one was coming for me. That “cat” was going to kill me and there was nothing I could do. Nothing.

  
I didn’t want my last view on this planet to be the nothingness of rusted, black metal and wood. Even if it was going to kill me, a demon cat would be more visually interesting as a final view than helplessly slamming a door. I turned around to see what had become of the cat.

  
It was disgusting. A horrid, terrible thing. There was this weird, iridescent gloss on its back. The tail had become segmented into irregularly sized parts. The hair on its legs thinned and stuck out oddly. The ears must have receded somewhere into its skull to make way for the eyes. It swallowed the top of its head. It looked like one massive, swollen eye if not for a small crease down the middle that suggested they used to be two. That thing looked like a shameful bastard of what once was a cat and a dragonfly. I watched as its glossy fur raised as its mouth ripped open down its neck. Nothing was left to the imagination. All the internal anatomy was on full display in its unhinged jaw like a pelican. The teeth looked haphazardly placed, as if there was no regard to their placement ever being biologically functional. Saliva hit the table with a wet splat as this unholy “meow” gurgled from its now visible throat. It was ready to pounce and tear me to shreds like its own skin.

  
My body moved on its own. My brain had accepted its fate but my body did not.

  
I wear lots of those friendship bracelets. It was something I learned to do when I was little at a summer camp to impress a girl I liked. Became a habit of mine that I kept on doing even after that muggy August summer came to a close. They would get worn out until the fibers just fall apart over time. At that very moment, my hands ripped the oldest one off and threw it to the side of the room. I really couldn’t tell you what my body expected to happen.

  
I watched that cat pause.

  
Its pupils shifted across its bulbous eyes to the corner of the room. Its mouth clumsily zipped itself back up as it turned to jump off the table. There was something even more nasty about those two movements.

  
It walked over to my old bracelet and began to bat at the embroidery. Giving it a sniff and pawing at it more. I could have passed out right there. I think I was pumped with so much cortisol and adrenaline that I physically could not. My hands trembled. My throat felt so narrow. That cat could have done nothing to me, but the way it just tore itself apart into *that*. I don’t know what would have happened had my hands didn’t move on their own. Honestly, I hope I never know.

  
I slid down the wall to take the weight off my legs. They felt like jelly and I could tell my knees were beginning to buckle. I hid my face in my hands trying to calm myself down. The cat finally stopped staring at me, I’m not dead, but I’m stuck here still at mercy if it gets bored enough. My head was spinning in a storm of dying, demon cats, locked doors, and rent. The storm almost immediately disappeared from something batting my feet. I think I must have leaped like a god damn frog and fell on my back. That fucking cat. If it didn’t want to kill me, a sudden heart attack would.

  
It sat at my feet, dropping the bracelet. It batted it towards me in an odd way due to its limbs being bent out of shape.

  
It wanted to *play*??

  
An eldritch horror at me feet wanted to fucking play. I’m sure the absurdity was visible on my face, but the bug cat was not phased in the slightest. I could feel my heart rate rise again trying to make a decision. I had to keep this cat entertained. I didn’t want to do the finding out part of fucking around with it. I winced, turned my head away, and grabbed one of the ends of my bracelet, bouncing it up and down. Something soft hit my hand and I could feel the bracelet swing against my arm. Opening one of my eyes, I saw it acting like any normal, happy cat. It was visually disgusting, but it's certainly acting more like a cat than monster.

  
A rusty clank came from the door. My eyes widened. Someone unlocked it. I could finally get out. I dropped the bracelet and leaped to the door, trying to avoid jumping onto the cat. I raced to the handle and swung the door open to the store again.

  
No one stood in front of me. No boss, employee, or even janitor. Given the horrors I just saw, I don’t think my mind truly processed how equally weird it was. I step out and as I go to shut the door, the cat’s pupils roll over from the top of their head to behind. It batted its tail happily and I could hear a faint purr. I cringed and shut the door.

  
I wish there was a way I could write about how fast I ran home. I could have out run college track stars I swear. Houses, cemeteries, and alleys repeated just as they did getting to that house until I finally ran into the downtown square. I missed those gaudy store window displays, the lizzie witch statue, and cheap witch hats people wore. I was out. I made it out. I probably looked crazy, but could you even blame me for it?

  
I finally was able to catch my breath. I slowly walked back to my house under the orange street lights. I didn’t have to run. Stumbling up the stairs and shoving my key into the lock, all I could want was a joint and a cold beer. A wave of safety and comfort hit me like a bus when I opened my front door. It’s crazy how a buzzing window AC unit can make you feel like that. Kicked my shoes off, tossed my shirt off onto the couch, and opened my fridge to grab a cold one. I didn’t notice it at first until I shut the door to my fridge.

  
A piece of paper that looked old and stained. Despite the signs of age, penned in ink was my schedule next week. All written in loving calligraphy.

  
I wish I could tell you how I felt in that moment, truly I do. Issue is, that was the last thing I remembered until the next morning. After vomiting my guts out first thing in the morning, the empty case and full ashtray gave me enough context to figure out how I reacted. I knew whoever was running this knew my address, but knew how to get in too? It felt like being a bird stuck in a cage. The bars are big enough to stick my head out, but just tight enough to never let me fly out. It felt like just going to that interview sealed my fate. I couldn’t just never go back and find a new job. Whoever is running this knows where I live and can get in. They also know that I need the money too.

  
Since that day, I’ve worked as a cashier and glorified body clean up crew. That cat I see roaming around on very few occasions, his eyes back in his sockets. Yet his shadow never seems to match the slender cat facade. I’ve seen people come and experience horrors worse than my cat interview. Looking back on it, the cat was by far more tame than the things customers could experience if they wanted to test their luck. I do wish I never came to that interview. I could be working a normal 9 to 5 instead of baby-sitting haunted objects, dealing with occultists, and cleaning up exploded gut contents. At least then I’d be doing one job and not the job of 5 people at once.
