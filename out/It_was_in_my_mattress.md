I had recently moved into a new house situated in a enclosed suburban-like community, except the area was prone to many robberies, murders, and drug dealings. It was a terrible place to live, but it was all I could afford considering I was dead broke and working at a bank as a janitor. However from the minute I moved into the house I sensed something was off, an awful and reeking smell like spoiled meat was infiltrating the entire house, it was terrible, but soon I caught onto where the smell was coming from. The smell got stronger as I moved towards the bedroom situated at the end of the hallway, as I entered the bedroom I found nothing, but the smell was still present, It was only then that I had the idea to move the furniture in the room around to find where the smell was coming from. 

There were only 4 peices of furniture, a small table, a desk, a nightstand and a average sized bed with an eroded mattress, I started with the nightstand, I opened all of the draws but the only thing I could find was a newspaper, and on the cover was a tittle of a missing woman, "Missing, Janice Clover, 24 years old", under the tittle was a picture of the woman, she had blonde hair, light skin, dark eyes but she was extremely beautiful. Even though it was just a newspaper it gave me an uneasy feeling, paired with the discusting smell protruding my room, I threw the newspaper on the floor and continued checking the furniture, the desk was empty the table was empty next was the bed, I figured maybe a rat had died under the bed but it didn't make any sense,"a dead rat smells bad but not this bad!" I said to myself while checking under the bed, there was nothing other than dust and two small cockroaches. I got up and was about the leave the room until something hit me, "the mattress! Check under the mattress" I did just so, as I was moving the mattress the smell got 10 times worse.

 I dragged it off the bed frame and immediately puked, to my horror there was a dead body tangled in bubble wrap and plastic, what looked like a woman but I couldn't tell by how badly decomposed the corpse was. There were hundreds of maggots infesting the plastic and the corpse. I ran out of the room, grabbed my phone and called 911, I told them everything and they arrived in about 10 minutes, I was taken out of my house and gave a statement to the officers, I told them that I recently bought the house and about the terrible smell aswell as the man that sold me house and his name, I was taken to a station and an investigation was conducted. It's been 5 months since this incident and not a day goes by without me thinking to myself, what could have happened to me if I had never thought anything of the smell or even checked where it was coming from.
