They’ll never tell you about this war.

It’ll never appear on the news, or in the history books. No countries will petition our cause in the UN. We’ll never get any aid supplies, or vast shipments of weaponry from the government. I doubt the internet will even notice my little post, but I figure it’s worth a shot. At least someone out there might find it, and try to do something, even if that something is coming down to pick up all the bones once it’s over. I suppose by then you won’t be able to recognize any of us. That’s okay. Just dump us in a pit together and make sure someone other than the government gets to inherit our stuff.

I’m not trying to be tough, or melodramatic, just honest.

My name is Ethan Sanderson. Right now, I’m sitting around the fire with the others, shoveling down a bowl of unsweetened oatmeal, and typing this while I have time. To think, my world was sane only a few hours ago, everything normal obliterated in just over sixty awful minutes. There’s no way I’ll ever get back to my old job, not with the roadblocks during the day, and the attacks at night. Nope, I’m here to stay, and so I figure I may as well share my story while this bout of decent cell service lasts.

It all started when I was driving home from another round of night shift at the Brighton-Smith Petroleum refinery, tired, covered in grease, and ready for a hot meal before bed. The radio crackled, auto-skimming through various channels, looking for anything other than twangy country music, self-pitying pop songs, or yet another news report yammering on about how close we were getting to nuclear war with the Russians. My truck’s engine rumbled with a comforting, quiet regularity, and I let myself smile in pride at that.

*One thing I can do, and that’s get an engine running smooth as silk.*

As an only child, with my father dying from lung cancer when I was fifteen and my mother hooked on drugs since I was twelve, I’d been on my own for most of my life. Engines had been the one thing I excelled at, school being my nemesis, and after I’d fixed up an old F-150 bound for the scrap yard, I’d took the first oil-rig job I could find and left town. I’d done well for myself, stayed away from the dealers that had wrecked my mom’s life, and accumulated enough money to buy a camper, several firearms, and a little solar power setup that allowed me to travel all over the country in relative comfort. Despite never having gone to college, I considered myself successful, and if I ever found a woman who didn’t mind the grease on my overalls and wasn’t a total lunatic, maybe I’d settle down and have kids of my own. Whatever the case, I swore to myself I’d be a better parent than either of mine had been.

*No cigarettes, no meth, and no throwing chairs when I get angry.*

My thoughts were shattered at the sight of several white and orange plastic barricades stretched across the cracked asphalt, completely blocking my path. Behind them, two massive slate-gray trucks were parked nose-to-nose across the roadway, just in case someone did get the bright idea of pushing past the flimsy obstructions. Five men dressed in similar gray uniforms, and carrying shiny black rifles stood around the roadblock, with two more perched in the turrets of the armored trucks, manning belt-fed machine guns. I hadn’t seen any signs warning me of construction, and never a road crew with armored vehicles, which made something sour twist in the pit of my stomach. As a ghetto kid from Pittsburgh, I’d learned to know when I was in a bad area, and this felt *all* kinds of bad.

“Look at Barron County, trying to be Chicago.” I grunted to myself and slowed to a stop in front of the barricades, waiting for the nearest soldier to walk up to my driver’s side window.

He approached, rifle at low-ready, and I noted the automatic switch on its receiver. Nope, these guys weren’t regular civilians out for a LARP. You need serious cash to have that kind of firepower, which meant I had to be dealing with some branch of our murky federal government.

*Just stay calm. You’ve got nothing to hide, and you’ve done nothing wrong. Play it cool.*

“Hey man.” I put on a friendly smile, scratching at my beard and pointing at the roadblock. “Is there, uh, some kind of accident up ahead?”

“Train derailment.” From behind his dark face mask, the soldier casually threw out what must have been a pre-determined lie, because I knew there was no rail line near this stretch of road. “A real bad one, I’m afraid. We’ve been tasked with keeping civilians out of the area until it’s all clear. Which way you headed?”

He seemed friendly enough, confident and relaxed, though I noted the beginnings of a tattoo that poked from under his uniform sleeve.

*Rangers lead the way.*

Something prickled in the back of my mind, a low warning that had saved me from many a mugging in my younger days. These guys weren’t local. They didn’t have any identifying patches or marks on their vehicles, and with how nice their gear looked, they weren’t here as part of some hazmat team. Besides, if they were so hell bent on keeping people out, then why was one of the machine-gunners facing the road *behind* them, as if waiting for someone to try and escape their ring of steel?

“Collingswood.” I rested my elbow on the truck window and jerked a thumb back towards the way I’d come. “I work at the oil refinery up the road. You guys military?”

The soldier chuckled and shrugged. “Once upon a time, my dude. We’re with the cleanup teams, providing security. Like I said, there’s some bad stuff down this road. Don’t want people tracking through it and getting sick.”

*Interesting timing. I haven’t even heard about any accident, and yet there’s already a cordon. Never saw the government move so fast.*

“Oh, gotcha, gotcha.” I played along, and eyed the rest of them for any symbols that might tell me just who I was dealing with. “Well, I’ll be honest, this is normally the road I take home, and it’s gonna take me way out of my way to go around. You sure I couldn’t just . . ?”

From behind his mask, the man gave out a sympathetic sigh. “Sorry man, I’ve got my orders. No one passes unless they’re official personnel. But hey, it should be all clear in, like, a few days tops.”

Putting my truck into reverse, I stuck out my hand, doing my best to put them all at ease, and keep the rifles pointed away from my head. “Well, hey, thanks for letting me know. I’ll tell the other guys at the rig, and we’ll try to keep out of your hair.”

“I appreciate it.” Despite the mask over his face, I could see the ends of his grin as the soldier shook my hand, and the others relaxed, their guns staying pointed toward the ground. “Like I said, we’ll be gone in a few days at most. So, if anyone starts getting riled, just let e’m know we’ve got this.”

*Uh huh, sure you do.*

I eased backwards into a U-turn and drove until I was well out of sight of the roadblock. As soon as they left my rearview mirror, I killed the lights, and drifted into the grassy berm, coming to a stop with minimal brake squeal.

My trailer sat just on the outskirts of Collingswood in a small, unkempt campground that was free to the public. It should have been a short commute, but the local police had been cutting off a lot of routes lately for seemingly no reason at all. However, these ‘upgrades’ at the roadblock weren’t the usual sheriff’s deputies. I knew a few guys in the refinery who were ex-military, and the soldier at the checkpoint had the same polite but deadly mannerisms that told me I was dealing with professionals. Whatever was going on out there, they certainly weren’t cleaning up a train derailment, especially since there were no train tracks near this road.

*Wonder what they need to hide so badly that they hire mercs?*

Pulling out my phone, I checked my maps app, and scanned the spider web of small gravel roads around Collingswood for an alternate route. Some of the roads looked so small that I wondered if they would be out of commission, as was the case with many of the neglected coal-mining roads in this forgotten part of the Appalachian foothills. Of course, my pickup was four-wheel drive, and if the ‘authorities’ thought that the road was impassible, then maybe they wouldn’t have it guarded. But with dawn only an hour away at best, I’d have to be quick, or risk being spotted in the daylight.

*There.*

My eyes caught a road called Bethesda Ridge that ran around a large chunk of land on the map labeled ‘New Wilderness Wildlife Reserve.’ I’d heard a few of the locals in Collingswood talk about that place, how pretty it was in the daylight, full of exotic animals and blooming flowers. I’m not much of a flower guy, but always figured maybe someday I’d take a tour to see what all the fuss was about. There had been something in the news a few days ago about some guy named [Richter](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/125343t/i_got_an_email_from_a_whistleblower_things_arent/) being involved in a scandal connected to the park, but I never paid attention to it. At any rate, this road looked like it should be well maintained, and would only take me five minutes longer than my usual route. With any luck, I’d be back in my camper, squeaky-clean and eating hot ravioli in no time.

I followed the directions my phone reliably spat out, winding up and down steep inclines, through narrow overgrown mining roads, and past farmhouse after dilapidated farmhouse. It depressed me how this area was so run down, the opioid epidemic really throwing the community for a hard loop. Part of me knew just by looking at the faded paint and sagging rooflines that these buildings had been beautiful once, but poverty, an indifferent government, and the unending flow of narcotics poisoned that beauty, turning it into something like a theme from some 90’s analog horror film.

*“Randy, tell me you’re seeing this.”*

Swearing under my breath in surprise, I almost jumped out of my skin, and stared at my shortwave walkie talkie. We used them on the various work sites to communicate between crews, but I didn’t recognize this voice. It was a young man, and he sounded scared.

*“Yeah, I seem e’m.”* An older man’s voice came through, low and rough, like he was whispering into his mic. *“Hold fire till they get closer.”*

My curiosity spiked, and I slowed, still driving down the bumpy old coal road in the dark. Most people don’t know, but even rudimentary shortwave radios sometimes experience a phenomenon called ‘skip’ where the right atmospheric conditions relay radio traffic from somewhere else, sometimes traffic from different frequencies, channels, or even long distances. I’d heard messages from as far away as California before, so it didn’t surprise me that I could get radio signals like this. Still, they were so clear, so loud, that whoever was talking had to be close by, within twenty miles at least.

*“My God.”* A woman’s voice came through, shocked and tense, as if she were watching a building full of children collapse. *“There’s so many. Randy, what do we—”*

*“Stay calm.”* The older man barked back, and I got the feeling he had some background in police or military, with the way he seemed to take command of the situation. *“Just stay put and conserve your ammo. We’ll be fine.”*

Head cocked in confusion, I almost didn’t look up in time, and slammed my boot down on the brake pedal.

Mud slushed under the knobby tread of my truck tires, and brown fur blurred past my headlights.

Stunned, I watched in wide-eyed fascination as no less than fifty whitetail deer bounded across the decrepit road at full speed, not even paying attention to my rumbling truck. Birds darted overhead, not just owls and crows, but all manner of daytime birds as well, pigeons, sparrows, songbirds, and even bats. Tens of thousands of bugs seethed over the dirt in dark sheets of wriggling legs, parting to allow the stampede of possums, racoons, red foxes, and even a pack of coyotes to flee past them like a tidal wave was hot on their tails. Neither stopped to attack each other, prey and predator running together, all with their ears laid bag, limbs moving at breakneck speed without a glance backward.

“What the . . .” I’d never seen animals act like this, not once in all my travels across the US. Something seemed to have spooked them, something bad enough that even the insects weren’t hanging around to weather the storm.

*“Now!”*

*Ka-boom.*

Milliseconds after the old man’s voice echoed through the radio, a bright flash lit up the horizon to my left, and a huge fiery orange ball rose from behind the hills bordering the road. My truck rocked, the shockwave rippled through the ground even from this far away, and I ducked out of reflex.

*What the heck is going on here?*

My heart roared in my ear, and I pushed the accelerator to the floor, weaving through the horde of wildlife to fly down the dark road like a bat out of hell.

‘*Take the next left.’*

The map app on my phone chirped in its neutral, pleasant female voice, and I drifted around the turn without even slowing down, spare sockets from my tool set rolling over the floorboard around my feet. Gravel pinged against the undersides of my truck cab, and the landscape opened up around me, more grasslands than trees. Flickers of orange light filled the sky, and the radio vomited a cacophony of human voices all raging to be heard about the hiss of static and faint echoes of what sounded like gunfire.

*“On your left!”*

*“Phyllis, watch out!”*

*“Randy, we need help on the right side!”*

*“My gun’s jammed!”*

I swallowed, and dodged potholes as sweat trickled down my scruffy face. Being in the oil field, nothing much scared me after working around some of the scum the companies recruited, but now my pulse thudded against the thin flesh of my temple, my heart rammed into each rib like it wanted out, and the air constricted in my lungs. Above me, the grim clouds reflected seething red and orange flames, the gunshots became audible in spite of my rolled-up window, and I caught the rattle of a Kalashnikov rifle, along with the deep boom-boom-boom of a real-life M2 machine gun.

‘*Take the next left, then proceed straight for two miles.’*

Yanking hard on the steering wheel, I rounded the bend, and my jaw dropped.

The gravel stretched on a long, back-and-forth swerving path that was about as straight as you could get for most rural southeastern Ohio backroads. On one side, tall wire mesh fencing lined the quiet ditches and grassy meadows, with a sign to my left not ten yards away marked *New Wilderness Wildlife Reserve*. On the other side a large, open section of grassland stretched out into the distance, pockmarked by little tractor paths and clusters of short trees, a few ponds interspersed in between. I could see where, in the daylight, it would have been beautiful, full of multi-colored wildflowers and flocks of butterflies.

But it wasn’t beautiful now.

Fire chewed through the tall grass in slow-moving walls of hungry orange and red, sending sparks skyward, and bathed the entire area in shifting shadows. Heavy gray clouds clotted the night sky, and I smelled burning rubber on the wind. Bright yellow muzzle flashes cut through the dark in the midst of the field, and a row of cabins burned on the other side of the plain, billowing black smoke rising like a pall of doom.

Dug in across the field with their backs to the road, a thin line of people fought with desperate brutality. I saw Armalites and Kalashnikovs intermixed with bolt-action hunting rifles and shotguns, along with flaming bottles of gasoline and pipe bombs covered in taped-on nails. Explosions went off every few seconds, the improvised grenades tossed in waves, and one man shouldered what looked to be a homemade rocket launcher made from a fire-extinguisher with fins welded onto it. The entire scene looked like the fourth of July on steroids, but the feral desperation of the fight told me this was no rifle range. These people were fighting for their lives, and I felt like I’d stumbled into something awful, a horrible nightmare that wasn’t meant for the outside world to see.

And then, as I gripped my steering wheel in dread, through the tall grass, *they* came.

Like lions throwing themselves at a heard of trapped gazelle, hunched figures loped forward, their shadows otherworldly in the light of the flames. Long, slender gray limbs ended in three-fingered claws at each hand, the legs shorter than the distended forearms so that they ran like gorillas, their muscled shoulders propelling them forward in frightening speed. They didn’t have tails, their skin the texture of smooth birch bark, with twig-like extensions poking out from their warty elbows and spines like prehistoric spikes down their backs. Each creature’s head was long and narrow, like a crocodile’s snout, but with a crown of more branch-like spikes around the skull in a fan, and no eyes that I could discern.

*This can’t be real . . .*

In an instant, the screams came through the glass of my truck cab, and cold, bone-chilling shrieks echoed across the wide fields. Not the pained, frightened squeal of an animal defending itself, but an ancient, hate-filled war cry that held no humanity in it whatsoever, repeated by dozens upon dozens of long-limbed predatory fiends.

The roar of a diesel cut through the night, and I barely reacted in time to avoid T-boning a massive green combine that burst through an open gate on the left side of the road, its front blades whirring. Someone had welded sharpened angle-iron all over it, and gleaming chains had been bolted to the blades at the front, tipped with shiny bits of razor blades. Black exhaust gushed from its smokestack, and a young man with blonde hair piloted it from a cab enclosed by a rebar cage into the brushy field.

*“I’ll clear the right side.”* A man called through the radio sitting in my cupholder. *“Jamie, you take the left. Let’s go, wrap e’m up, wrap e’m up!”*

Behind the combine came a big yellow backhoe, also covered in spikes and rebar, with long rubber hoses running from an oil drum mounted on the back to a flaming nozzle affixed to its iron bucket.

*“Right behind you.”* A girl’s voice crackled amongst the chatter, and the two machines diverged to swing around on either end of the line of fighters, their tracks and tires churning up the muddy ground like mechanical dinosaurs.

Even from my speeding truck, I heard the impact of the first creatures being mown down by the combine, it’s blades and chains ripping into flesh and bone with vicious fury. Opposite it, the backhoe moved its craned arm like the neck of some giant monster and spewed bright yellow flames onto the onrushing horde of pale beings, lighting up the field for hundreds of yards around them. Dozens of mutants fell, either burned or diced to pieces, and the ground shook with the triumphant roar of the diesels. The sickly-sweet stench of burned flesh filled the air, machinery clanged and banged, and the guns roared with chemical delight. Pained screams from the bizarre creatures echoed, and above the gunfire, a cheer rang out from the line of people.

*“Bill, get out of there!”* The girl called Jamie cried over the radio.

In an instant, the triumphant moment turned to chaos, as a creature jumped almost twenty feet into the air, and landed like a cat atop the combine. The iron spikes sank into its already bleeding feet and hands, but the monstrosity seemed too enraged to mind, and ripped into the rebar around the cab with abandon. Metal squealed, bent, and then sheared off as the glass of the cab shattered.

A man’s screams briefly pierced the radio static, and the combine was overwhelmed, tipped onto its side by a wave of snapping monsters.

*“Fall back!”* The old man’s shout came through the radio even as I watched a figure that may have been him continue firing the M2 into the onrushing waves of creatures. *“Fall back to the ridge!”* 

“Whoa!” A white pickup truck lurched into the roadway, and I locked up my brakes to slide around it.

A chestnut-haired girl around my age sat at the wheel, blood running down her forehead, with a black polo shirt on. In the bed stood an old man with glasses and gray hair, gripping the handles of a .50 caliber machine gun, its barrel cherry red with heat. Others streamed across the road in full retreat, all in black shirts with the New Wilderness logo on the front, and they all dragged wounded comrades away from the burning field.

My truck ground to a stop on the side of a dirt embankment not five feet away, stalling from the sudden downgrade in RPMs.

The people in the white truck blinked at me in shock, and I stared right back, both sides seeming confused as to why the other was there.

“What are you doing?” The old man astride the .50 shouted, and waved his arm at me as if I were some airplane attempting to land in the wrong airport. “Get out of here, go.”

Jerked back into the present by his raspy command, I scrabbled at the ignition, the stubborn motor choosing this moment to chug-chug-chug instead of fire. Horrid reptilian chittering clicked nearby, and I whimpered like a trapped puppy, terror seething through my mind.

*Vroom.*

Jamming the stick into reverse, I punched my boot to the gas pedal.

The transmission whined, my tires spun, and a sinking feeling ran through my guts. I was high centered, my wheels caught on either side of the bank, the dirt lodged under my truck chassis holding me in place. It didn’t matter if I had four-wheel-drive or not if my wheels couldn’t get purchase. I was stuck.

*Wham.*

My world lurched sideways like a massive fist had slammed into the cab of my beloved pickup. Gravity inverted, the seatbelt dug into my chest, and broken bits of glass sprayed across my field of vision. Everything seemed to move in slow motion, and I watched spare sockets, an old candy bar wrapper, and my handheld radio float through the air in front of my face.

*Crash.*

Reality snapped back like a gunshot, and the mutilated Ford rolled down into the ditch on the opposite side of the gravel road. I looked down at the cab ceiling, my arms hanging suspended from my shoulders, and registered a metallic taste in my mouth.

*Well that’s not good.*

Somewhere across the road came the dull *thud* of a heavy footstep, and I turned groggily to see what it was.

The creature stood not yards away, tall as a horse, and its crocodilian, eyeless head swiveled from side to side, tasting the air. Red blood glistened on its dagger-like yellowed teeth, bared in the firelight, and a long, black serpentine tongue flicked in and out rhythmically. 

Something about its gray, sinewy form echoed into my head, stirred a part of me I hadn’t known existed. I’d been scared before as a little kid when my mom would get crazy because of her drug habit, I’d been scared on the streets when the older boys tried to sell me to some homeless guy, and I’d been scared the day one of the men on our rig down in New Mexico came to work with an axe and killed four people. This was different. This was something else, something deeper.

A primal, existential fear, one older than engines, skyscrapers, and radios. A fear borne on instinct.

The fear of prey when it sees its predator.

Jerking its head around, the creature seemed to lock on to me, as if it could smell the terror seeping from my pores and opened its narrow jaws to reveal row after row of jagged, steak-knife sized teeth.

It roared, a colossal, prehistoric sound that made the skin on my arms crawl with dread.

*I gotta get out.*

I thrashed, clawed at my seatbelt buckle, my sweaty fingers slipping and sliding over the metal button. Both my lungs felt like they were too small to get enough air, and all the blood rushed to my head in a wave of panic.

A shadow fell over me, and I whipped my head around.

Foul breath, reeking of the torn flesh of a hundred corpses blasted my face, the open maw of the creature right outside my window. Thick gooey strands of saliva threw little rainbow refractions in the light, and the teeth that poked out from the mottled gray gums held bits of flesh and clothing stuck between them, a broken shoelace wound around one like a stuck noodle. I could see right down the dark cavern of its throat, and it almost resembled the inside of a rotted log, bumpy and grooved, with black flesh instead of rosy pink.

I watched, as the teeth headed right for my exposed face.

*Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.*

Letting out a howl of pain and anger, the monster staggered back, and dark black spots appeared on its bark-like hide.

Smaller silhouettes dashed into the firelight, their guns spitting little streams of flame, while the heavy machine gun thundered on behind them. My mind still spun in horrified confusion, and I hung there motionless as the creature tumbled to the ground in a twitching heap.

“Hurry up. Grab him and let’s go.” One of the men in the road dumped several more rifle rounds into the head of the fallen beast, his comrades scuttling toward my truck.

A muscular form crouched outside my window, and a man leaned in, about my age, with close cut black hair and a bloodied lip. “Hey, you still alive?”

*So far.*

Blood surged in my skull, giving me a headache, and I shouted to be heard above the hammering of the big gun just outside. “My belt’s stuck.”

A steel knife blade flashed in the dark, and I plummeted to the cab ceiling, barely managing to break my fall with both arms outstretched. Someone grabbed me by the collar and dragged me out into the wet grass.

“Get up man, we can’t stay here.”

I lunged to my feet and scurried with the rest of them for the white pickup truck, spent brass casings sliding under my boots like marbles. All around me, the creatures devoured anyone they caught up with, and it seemed the guns never stopped firing. The night sky filled with smoke from the fires that raged across the open grass fields and screams of torment from dying people rang in my ears.

Diving over the side of the rusty truck bed, I huddled down behind the low wheel well, and the vehicle lurched away up the hill, plowing through a set of reinforced gates at the top.

The instant I saw the barbed-wire tops swing shut behind us, I sat up, and the breath stuck in my chest.

A crudely built log wall surrounded a cluster of single-story buildings with a large asphalt parking lot in the center. Four towers stood at each corner of the fort, two looking like they had been used for ziplining at one time, and the other two likely built the same time as the wall, made from dented red shipping containers stood on end. From every direction, people carried green ammunition cans, dragged stretchers with wounded on them, or rushed to man the ramparts of the wooden palisade with all kinds of weapons in their arms. Many were young, likely no older than their early 20s at best, their faces sheet-white with fear.

*What the hell is this place?*

“Darren, grab some gloves and help Richard get this gun on that wall!” Barking at the top of his gravelly smoker’s voice, the old man waded through the sea of hot brass casings in the truck bed and leaned down to offer me a hand up. “On your feet son, no time to waste.”

“I . . . what are . . . what’s going—”

“Phyllis, grab some ammo and top everyone off.” Oblivious to my sputtered protests, the old man jumped down from the truck bed and continued pointing people to their stations. “David, get on the radio and tell the mortar crews to start layin’ hate. Sean, find this guy a gun, and check on Carter’s men.”

The dark-haired guy who had pulled me from my Ford jumped down from the truck and gestured for me to follow him. “Come on, this way.”

Confused and terrified, I ran after him, dodging five girls in blood-stained clothes who ran to carry a wounded man back into a long, rectangular building to our left, with a sign marked ‘New Wilderness Visitor’s Center’ beside the doorway.

We ducked through the door, then down a narrow hallway to the left, and the man named Sean pushed open a door to what looked like a storeroom. Green ammo cans were stacked to the ceiling, with black plastic crates on the other side marked ‘medical’ and a mostly empty weapons rack bolted to the back wall. Various bits of vests, holsters, and tactical gear hung from hooks beside the ammunition, and a row of black gas masks dangled next to them.

*Did a doomsday bunker explode in here?*

“You know how to shoot?” He tossed a woodland camo pattern bandolier at me, the pouches already filled with gray steel magazines, and yanked one of the few remaining rifles from the weapon’s rack.

Wide-eyed with shock, I blinked down at the web gear in my hands. “I mean yeah, but . . . what’s going on?”

Sean pushed the gleaming black rifle into my arms, and held my gaze with wild, bloodshot eyes. “I don’t have time to explain, alright? If you want to live, follow me, and do exactly as I say. Got it?”

*Whump-whump.*

Outside, the dull roar of something like a propane cannon split the air, and Sean grabbed a few more ammunition cans before he slipped past me out the door. “Come on, the mortars are up. We’ve gotta reinforce the left flank, or the freaks will be inside the wire. Put your stuff on man, let’s go!”

Running while pulling a poorly-adjusted chest rig on proved to be nearly impossible, and so I slung the morass of nylon over one shoulder, gripped my rifle as we sprinted through the courtyard. We passed two circular sandbag pits, manned by a crew scrawny of teenagers who feverishly dropped homemade rockets into a couple of green-painted steel pipes, dirt flying with every shot. Eerie roars echoed just on the other side of the wall, returned by the fighters atop the ramparts pouring lead into the beasts without pause, the *crack* of rifles blending into a never-ending wave. The stench of coppery blood and acrid gunpowder filled the air, along with pillars of black smoke from burning fuel-bombs. Medics staggered around the yard, some of them girls who looked no older than 16, pressing white gauze to spurting wounds, and leaning over their wounded patients to shield them from dust kicked up by the mortars. It was absolute bedlam, and all I wanted to do was find something solid to crawl under.

“Carter!” Sean charged up a set of steps, and into a log pillbox built atop the leftmost corner of the wall. “Ammo!”

Inside, a few older men with silver in their hair and beer-guts beneath their weather-worn army fatigues snatched at the ammunition cans Sean offered, empty magazines covering the floor around them. Despite their bulky physiques, I got the impression from how they moved that these men had worn those uniforms before, in a different time, when they had darker hair and slimmer waistlines.

*Looks like a VFW meeting on cocaine.*

One of the men, a thinner guy with a short gray ponytail and Viking-style beard crouch-walked over to us.

“Where’s the fifty?” He shouted, the incessant *bam-bam* of guns enough to make my ears hurt.

“Randy sent it to the front gate.” Sean howled back, and jerked his thumb at himself an I. “We’re your reinforcements.”

The gray-haired man pointed to his right, through the firing slit of the little fighting position. “Dawn’s not far off! We just gotta hold em till then. Pick a spot and get to work.”

Sean scuttled to an open spot in the firing line, and I crawled up next to him, racking the charging handle of my rifle with clammy fingertips. I flicked the safety switch off, and peered down the dimly lit iron sights into the darkness.

*Dear God . . .*

There had to be close to 200 of them, surging over the burning field, past the fallen combine, and up the slope to the walls in fluid, deadly speed. Like ocean waves they rolled forward, dozen upon dozens, a never-ending tide of long-limbed, reptile-faced monsters, with woody skin that seemed to eat bullets. Without fear, they threw themselves at the wall, oblivious to the danger, almost immune to the pain, driven by an insatiable urge to rip and tear, their ancient battle roars enough to chill me to the bone.

I blinked, and caught sight of one as it crawled up an incline of its dead fellows, reptilian teeth bared, moving so fast it was almost a blur.

Placing the front sight post over its bark-like hide, I pressed the trigger over and over, the rifle bucking in my arms obediently.

Gunfire from our position peppered the oncoming monster, and it fell with an agonized shriek less than thirty yards away, black blood oozing from dozens of wounds.

*Click.*

In my hands, the smoking rifle yawned with an empty chamber, and I ducked down to reach for a fresh magazine. Just before I could reload, however, something in the distance caught my eye.

Pinpricks of light flickered in the far tree line, yellow sporadic flashes that looked vaguely familiar. It occurred to me that the beasts outside weren’t fleeing from the gunfire, even as we mowed them down, almost as if they had nowhere else to go but right through the hail of lead. By all accounts, they should have just turned tail and ran for the woods like any other animal. So why weren’t they?

Squinting hard, I focused on the lights, and something inside my brain clicked.

*Muzzle flashes.*

They were concealed just inside the cover of the dark pines, as many as sixty more guns firing into the herd of crawling nightmares. But they weren’t moving in to help clear the beasts from the fort walls. Instead, they stayed where they were, turning any stray monsters that tried to escape away, and sent them lumbering toward our position.

*They’re herding them. They’re herding them right to us.*

“The tree line.” I slapped Sean’s arm until he stopped firing and pointed to the distant gunfire. “See that? There’s guys over there.”

Sean yanked a black handheld radio from his chest rig and clicked the talk button. “Marksmen, hit the trees! I repeat, muzzle flashes in the tree line, hit them hard!”

I pressed the trigger several times in the general direction of the flashes, emptying mag after mag in an effort to keep both the monsters, and the mysterious human instigators at bay. Others on the ramparts with scoped hunting rifles seemed to be having better luck, as cries of “Got one!” and “I hit him!” echoed from every position. One by one, the flashes started to fade out, either due to retreat, or the marksmen finding their target.

A soft warmth tickled my left cheek, and I turned to see the sky began to lighten, the first long ray of sunshine slipping over the dark horizon.

*Dawn.*

Cheers went up from all down the line, and with the unknown attackers in the tree line suppressed, some of the monstrous creatures turned from the tide of lead to make for the forest. Their flight started a route, as more of the creatures followed like a flock of birds, and soon, the last of them disappeared into the trees on the far side of the scorched grassland.

The gunfire started to slacken off, and I slumped down with my back to the wall beside Sean, the two of us grinning in relief.

“Not bad, newbie.” He leaned his steaming rifle against the wall to cool and stuck out a hand. “Sean Hamond.”

“Ethan.” I shook it, heart still racing, and set my own rifle on the floor, waves of heat rising from its now purple barrel. “Ethan Sanderson.”

He pulled out a small flask and unscrewed the cap to offer it to me. “Well Sanderson, cheers. You didn’t die.”

*Glad to know that’s a celebratory accomplishment out here.*

With my limbs shaking from the adrenaline wearing off, I cast back my head to gulp down some of the burning amber whiskey. “What were those things?”

Sean climbed to his feet and gave me a hand up. “Birch-Crawlers. They usually don’t cluster into super-packs that big unless they’re hunting or threatened. I figure we have Sheriff Wurnauw to thank for that.”

My eyes widened, and I stared out into the gutted battlefield, trying to count the bodies, and failing miserably. “Wurnauw? O*ur* Wurnauw? I . . . I don’t get it man, why would the cops do something like this?”

“That’s exactly what I asked the sheriff,” Sean’s face hardened into a grim frown. “Right before he tried to blow my brains out. They’ve been lying to us, all of us, for *years*.”

My blood ran cold at the way he said that, but I refused to lose my cool. “So, what do we do now?”

Picking up his rifle, Sean slung it over one shoulder, and scratched at his stubble beard with a yawn. “Well, I’d say it’s about breakfast time, wouldn’t you? Might as well get comfortable, Sanderson. Looks like you’re going to be here for a while, since Wurnauw and his men are still out there.”

Too relieved to be alive and confused by the deluge of strange events that I’d witnessed, I shuffled out of the pillbox into the early morning breeze.

Groans from wounded and dying fighters rose through the air, many of the nurses weeping and wailing as more of the critically injured began to die from blood loss. Most of the gunfire ceased, only a few of the fighters still finishing off wounded Birch Crawlers with merciless hatred. In the creeping daylight, a carpet of dead monsters lay piled up against the palisade wall, some so high, I could have reached over and touched their still-twitching claws. They had gotten close, too close, and I realized that my death had clambered within a few feet from me more than once this night. How these things even existed, I still didn’t know. It made no sense to me, none of it.

“Hey, new guy.”

I looked down to see the chestnut-haired girl waving from beside a metal oil drum, a fire burning in the center of it. Soot and exhaustion lined her face, but it still bore a soft, friendly smile.

“You frozen up there?”

Over. It was over, at least for now, and that was all that mattered. I’d survived my childhood. I survived the streets of Pittsburg. If I could do that, I figured, then this strange park was no different. Just like before, I would take it one day at a time. I’d get some food, scrounge more ammo, and see if I could find some decent cellphone service. Maybe the girl by the fire would lend me her phone. It’d be a good excuse to get her number.

*You know, it is kind of pretty here, in the daytime.*

Taking a deep breath of crisp, morning air, I shouldered my rifle, and made my way down the wooden rampart steps, the smell of woodsmoke in my nose, and the echoes of guns still ringing in my ears.
