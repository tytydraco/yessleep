It started about a month ago, when I was sick and had taken the day off from work. I've never had any troubles falling asleep, but that day sleep just wouldn't come. I laid awake the whole day, till about eleven at night. But when I finally did fall asleep it felt like the deepest sleep I had ever been in.

The dream I had then started it all. I was in a forest, some place that I couldn't recognise. The trees around me felt huge, even though they looked like normal trees. They somehow had a weight to them, something that overwhelmed me when I looked at them. And when I tried to see the leaves it felt like they were poking at my eyes. I had to turn my eyes away before I could even make out their shapes.

I tried looking up to the sky. I saw no sun beyond the canopy, but there was still bright light all around it. The entire sky was flaring white, burning to look at. I turned away again, now keeping my gaze only at the ground and the tree trunks, both different shades of brown and the only things I could bear looking at. I started walking.

The endless light from the sky was blistering over my whole body. I should have stopped, should have sat down under the shade of one of the trees. But who knows why we do what we do in dreams. I walked while my head felt like it would melt and my legs felt like they would fall off.

That was where the dream had ended. I had woken up at six in the morning, on the dot. That was strange too, I couldn't remember the last time I woke up before my alarm.

I couldn't go back to sleep after that no matter how much I tried. When I finally gave up and tried to get up I realised how exhausted I still felt, how I was drenched in sweat, and how my legs were screaming in pain.

I brushed all of that off to the fever I had the day before. My temperature was normal enough now, and I couldn't afford to miss work any more. So I tried to ignore the pain, and when I couldn't I popped a pain killer and went to work anyway.

That night I laid down to sleep at ten, even more exhausted than I was in the morning. But I still couldn't sleep until eleven, on the dot.

I had the same dream then, with the same heavy trees and the pointy leaves and the burning light. I walked the whole time I was there again, moving on some deep wild instinct.

The next day was the same too. I woke up at exactly six, with exhaustion for days and legs with unending pain, and at night I went to sleep only at eleven, not a second earlier.

I ignored it the best I could, even when it happened again the next day, and again, and again. I thought it would pass. But it didn't.

After a couple of weeks of waking up in sweat and pain I decided it was enough. I wouldn't sleep, maybe that will break the chain. I prepped everything, coffee to last me half the night, and beer for the rest. I had snacks and a movie marathon ready. There was no way I could fall asleep now.

The last thing I remember from that night was sipping on my third cup of coffee and staring at the time on my phone- 22:59.

After that I was in the forest again. I wanted to scream, this couldn't be happening. But then all of those thoughts were drowned out, this was the first time I felt its presence.

It still wasn't anywhere close, I don't know how I could tell. But it was closer. It was as if the entire forest screamed of its coming. The trees around me felt heavier than before. The light from above felt brighter, and the leaves were a blur I couldn't even briefly turn my gaze to. Its presence felt like a buzzing in my ear. I knew I had to walk.

I woke up the next morning on my couch, with coffee spilled all over my clothes and the mug broken on the ground. The burn from the coffee on my chest made its presence known as I came to. I didn't need to check the time.

I think I cried then, for a while.

Maybe I should have gone to someone then, a psychiatrist perhaps. But I didn't. My logic was sound, I think. I needed to break the chain. And if I couldn't do it by staying awake, I would do it by falling asleep.

That weekend I took out the sleeping pills. They had been sitting in the cabinet for over a year now. I couldn't get myself to throw away anything, even with all the painful memories they had with them, but I had never imagined using them myself.

I knew the risks then, or thought I knew them anyway. I wouldn't overdose. I checked the dosage on five different websites before taking four pills and gulping them down at ten in the morning.

I was worried when I was still wide awake at a quarter to eleven, but after that I didn't realise when I had fallen asleep.

I was in the forest again, but this time there was no lighted sky. It was all dark instead, the real dark where you can't see your hand if you put it one inch from your face. But I didn't need to see to recognise the forest, it felt heavy and overwhelming just the same.

And then there was something more. It was there, still far away, but it was angry. The thoughts seemed to float into my head by themselves. As if I was in a place beyond words, as if that thing was something that existed in the deepest of my instincts already. I didn't need to be told what it was thinking, and I didn't need to be told that I needed to run.

I was running already, the direction that was away from it, I somehow knew that too. In the darkness I crashed into trees at every step, some I hit hard enough to make me fall back. My nose was bleeding, I felt the blood drip down to my chest. But I couldn't stop running. The thoughts were already here.

I had broken the rule, and it was angry. It wouldn't walk now. It had put all eight of its paws on the ground. It was running, each step breaking the earth beneath its legs. The trees fell and flew away like dried leaves where its feet landed. Its four hands were twitching above its faces. It was coming to me at speeds faster than what existed in the world we had escaped to.

The forest fell heavier with every step I sensed it take towards me. The weight was ringing in my head. My body ached harder than it ever had, but still running felt effortless. It was instinct, not just for the brain to know, but for every limb to move. My legs carried my body on their own.

I woke up with a jolt. The time on my phone was 18:00. I think I just numb then. The pain in my legs, the blood dripping down my face, it was all far away.

I didn't move that evening. At eleven I fell asleep at the same spot, on the dot.

There was light again in the forest. The stabs of the leaves and the scorching sky felt like a relief. It had stopped running. I knew the rules now, I was reminded of them. It only moved in the dark, and I in the light. It wouldn't run now, but it still had four paws on the ground. I had lost the privilege of two.

There is an end to this forest, I know there is. We reached it once. I just have do it again. Now I sleep every night at eleven, and I run till six in the morning. I can reach the end, or at least I could have when it still had two paws on the ground. With four, I'm afraid the forest is getting too heavy too quick, and I'm afraid one day I will fall asleep before eleven.
