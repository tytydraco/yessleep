 "Welcome back to Explorers Den, guys today, for the very first time we are going to explore the Cecil Seaside hotel on the Miami coast. It has long since been abandoned for the last 6 years and still stands strong today! It is currently 5 PM, EST

Let's go."

Except, that wasn't my first time. It was in fact my third time exploring that shutdown shithole.

I suppose my little urban exploring phase was merely that and soon after this incident, I stopped completely. As a middle aged woman I suppose I should feel embarrassed to admit that I still get phases. 

I've had a few wake up calls in my life for my phases 

And Holy Shit

If this wasn't the biggest one of them all.

The Cecil hotel

 was one of those 'passion projects' by the beautiful seaside of the  Miami coastline founded by some young millionaire that inherited his wealth and built a resort to keep himself content for a while till its charm faded as soon as he realized the magnitude of work it would take to run the place.

So, there it Sat. Rotting away, 'selfishly' taking up the space a more useful project could have used. Becoming home to the less fortunate souls that happened to be born as rats and roaches.

Armed with my standard grade mace, baton, water  bottle, selfie stick and a bag of Twinkies I explored the building from its overflowing toilets to its flooded foul smelling basement. 

Taking full advantage of the urban exploring trends of the time.

But, to be honest, I was just milking watch time and content. But, I had already found my pot of gold.

A large 20 x 10 built in swimming pool right by the Rocky, churning seaside separated only by a cracked, moss and algae infested tiled walkway which might've been majestic in its heyday with its various shades of sky, sea and turquoise blues.

The moss, sludge, algae and general state of disrepair was an unsettling yet interesting and frankly, really cool sight to behold.

I knew I'd get a lot of views on this one. Although, there was one thing that I remember finding strange. The building was rampant with rodents, roaches, insects etc.

You'd think there would've been a few of these critters floating atop the water's surface but that wasn't the case. 

It didn't really bother me that badly at the time. It was just a passing thought.

No, I needed to get this up on the channel. And nothing was going to stop me from getting those sweet views.

I stood in front of the pool at one end with my phone attached to the end of my selfie stick and filmed myself standing in front of the large green, foul smelling mass.

I hit record then launched into my overly excited 'Youtube' voice. 

That's when I hear a little plop or a splash coming from that smoggy, dead-still cesspit. And a ripple originating from the cause. A sizable one at that.

I got severely spooked by this, a terrified gasp hitched in my throat.

Whilst there was an ocean calmly churning and splashing on the other side of the graffiti covered half a meter high wall, there was nothing around or near that pool that could have caused that splash.

Nighttime was beginning to close in faster as winter approached and so was my nerves at that moment. 

I wrapped up filming, attempting to stay positive. 'At least I've captured some good creepy content' I'd thought to myself at the time.

However, I didn't plan to spend another second in that creepy, dirty place.

The main entrance to the pool area was locked and so I had to slip through a shattered window probably caused by some stupid, teenage vandals.

When I got halfway through, I slipped on some moss and accidentally grabbed the window frame, grabbing onto a piece of broken glass that made a deep cut in my palm.

The next sound I would hear would make me bolt so fast through that window, I'm surprised I didn't cut anything off. 

A huge splash erupted from the pool.

On top of that a loud, heavy smack of wet flesh landed just a few meters away from me.

Then, what sounded like something or someone's wet feet advancing toward me, RAPIDLY.

I felt like Florence Joyner running out of that decrepit building. Cutting and scraping myself on every little sharp, rusty, dirty object.

I could no longer hear the thing behind me but I knew it was still after me.

As I bolted out the exit, I body slammed into some poor old man that was walking through the entrance. I immediately clicked on that he was looking for a place to put down his head for the night by looking at his dirty torn clothes.

"Get out of here. NOW."

Was all I managed to screech into his face before I left that hellish place for good. I didn't even wait for his reaction. Knowing what I know now. The guilt eats at me daily. I didn't tell a soul about what happened. The after effects left me traumatized and mute on the subject whenever anyone asked me what was wrong.

This all happened a week ago now and a recent news article plus...an intensive investigation made me realize that I should have said something earlier.

That man I had bumped into was actually a well known and well liked homeless man in the area who was once a well respected member of the neighborhood. So, when he had suddenly disappeared a week ago, people went looking.

And among one of the many people concerned for his safety was a Local Police Sergeant. A charitable religious man that used to let him sleep in his Wendy house sometimes.

It didn't take long for the police to track down his last whereabouts through neighborhood CCTV footage and it didn't take long for the police to link his disappearance to me.

That's when a  pattern of disappearances of the local homeless population was discovered and with barely any leads, I became the prime suspect. Of course, due to lack of substantial evidence and the fact that I had only explored that place for three days, I was let off the hook. But alas, people are still suspicious of me. Soiling the tiny amount of respect I still might have had.

That old man was never found. Nor were the other individuals that had 'disappeared'. And after scrolling through my gallery that terrible, horrifying night  and watching that video I took of myself standing in front of the pool.

I know they'll never be found again.
