i have been thinking about posting this story for a while now, and recently, i told my friend about it. they encouraged me to finally do it, so here i go.

during the pandemic, my brother-in-law’s private resort got rented out for a whole year by a group of chinese nationals. they were building apartments nearby and needed a place for some of their workers to stay. they paid the full amount upfront, moved in, and that was that.

my brother-in-law never checked on them. but pretty early on, we noticed something strange. they covered every single glass window and door with boxes and random stuff so no one could see inside.

fast forward to the end of their lease. the place was a wreck. broken furniture, burned paintings, and garbage piled up like it had been abandoned for years. they paid for the damages, so we just shrugged it off and moved on.

since it was still the pandemic, my family decided to live there to save on rent. no guests were coming in anyway, so we stayed in the villa. i even had my own room. and that’s when i noticed the smell. it was strongest in the villa. sharp, rotten, metallic, with this sickly sweet note, almost fruity but in the worst possible way. it clung to the air, and i will never forget that smell.

the water was worse. foul, like something dead had been sitting in it. i refused to gargle with it and would walk to a bathroom far from the villa just to wash my face or brush my teeth. soon, i couldn’t eat meat. especially pork because the smell made me gag. i’m pretty sure my mom used the tap water for cooking, and the thought alone made me nauseous.

i figured maybe i was being dramatic until i told my younger brother. he said he smelled it too and also felt weird eating meat at the villa. but he just brushed it off. i can't believe how they could just ignore the smell.

the weird part was, when i eat at the resort’s restaurant, which had its own water supply, or whenever we eat outside, or order from other restaurants, i was fine. no smell, no nausea about meats. but when the meat was cooked at the villa, it was instant. i just can't take it, even if i tried eating with my nose covered.

the smell was everywhere, especially in the indoor pool area near the water tank.

sometimes at night, when i turned on the sink in my bathroom, the stench would hit me so hard it made me puke. we lived there for about a year before moving out. i thought that was the end of it.

then, years later, i saw the news. POGO operations are getting raided left and right. one of the biggest stories was about alice guo, the mayor of a nearby province. turns out, the building those chinese tenants had been working on got raided too. they were part of a POGO. and bodies had been found in the area.

that’s when my sister told me the kicker. the woman who rented the villa from my brother-in-law was alice guo’s sister. and suddenly, everything made sense.

no one ever checked the villa properly after they left. no major renovation, no inspection. and i still wonder.. was someone killed there? buried nearby? or worse… was something in the water we drank every single day? i don’t know. and honestly, i don’t think i ever want to.

ps. if you're not familiar with the issues abort POGO, Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs). online scams, fraud, human trafficking, and other criminal activities were uncovered in a series of government raids on several Pogo hubs.
