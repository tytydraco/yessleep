It all started, what felt to me, like yesterday. But in reality, I have no idea how much time has passed. You see, I needed to have surgery. Nothing major, but I needed to have my gallbladder removed. It's a relatively small procedure, but I was having so much pain from it, it had to be done. If you know the pain, you know why I had it done.

Anyway, I had this operation planned on this scheduled day: *>!illegible!<*. My wife and daughter were with me at the hospital. If the surgery goes well, I could go home the same day. But the thing is, in the current times, something strange seems to lurk in the air. I know it sounds strange, but we've heard on the news that weird radio waves have been picked up everywhere around the world. So much that it has been interfering with electronic devices everywhere. From phones and microwaves acting weird, to complete blackouts in some cities.

It's been going on for a week now. People are still trying to do their jobs and day-to-day life is mostly the same. But until the... *>!illegible!<*... things are so confusing. I just don't know what's going on! Like I mentioned, things were mostly normal. So I was happy my operation could go on. I really wanted to get rid of my gallbladder after all.

The nurse told me that the hospital had backup generators. So if there was a power outage, the hospital could still continue their work. They even had small "sleep devices" for each patient to keep them in a coma-like state. In case the backup generators failed, these devices would prevent patients from waking up in the middle of surgery. It would also keep the patients in a sleep state after procedures, so they could rest their bodies a bit more. The patient would remain in a coma-like state until the device would stop working.

My mind was a bit more at ease. I've read about people waking up mid-surgery, and I definitely did not want that to happen. The kind nurse mentioned that this rarely ever happens and it's a common fear among patients. She also said that I was lucky with the sunny room, as the sleep device was solar-powered. It could store energy for three months before needing sunlight again.

"More importantly, we're here to help you all the way through!" I remember my wife saying.

"Yep," was the short response from my teenage daughter. She barely looked up from her phone.

"When you wake up, we'll be right here next to you," she smiled.

I never knew how right she was... *>!illegible!<*... to the sight of that. But at the time my wife's beautiful smile gave me hope and comfort. I know my daughter seemed so uninterested, but she was always so sweet. It's just part of being a teenager, to be a little distant at times.

The wait in the hospital wasn't long. Within an hour I was called up for surgery.

"Good luck, Dad!" my daughter shouted. She had even put her phone to the side. The look in her eyes showed me that she might've been more nervous than me about the whole situation.

"We love you, honey!" I heard my wife saying as I was being taken away.

I took a deep breath. "It's just a small procedure," I thought three times in a row. I'm not so sure why I was getting so anxious about it all of a sudden. I'm usually a pretty calm and down-to-earth person. Although a surgery is not something you'll experience every day. The nurse asked if I was nervous.

"Yeah, a little bit," I said.

"That’s normal," she said, "most people are, but you're in good hands here."

I knew I was in good hands. She pushed me through a long hallway and as I looked at the passing ceiling lights, I noticed a flicker in the light.

"Yes, it happens more often lately," the nurse said.

Even if it was a daily occurrence now, it did not help in easing my mind. The lights flickered twice more before reaching the large door at the end of the hallway. She parked my bed in front of the large door. Then she held her badge in front of the scanner next to the door. After a few seconds, a long monotone beep was heard.

"Huh?" the nurse exclaimed. She tried her badge again. Again, a long beep. The door remained like frozen still. She looked at the little screen above the scanner.

"What's *error 79225.2116*?" she said to herself.

She peeked through the small circular window in the door. Then tried her badge in front of the scanner again. Now a short beep was heard. The door finally opened.

"It probably has to do with all the radio wave interference lately," she said, followed by a sigh.

She paced a bit faster now. I looked around to see all the people in their olive green surgery suits. They hurried past me left and right. It gave me a feeling like everyone was in a rush. A lady came up to us and said, "Hello sir, I'm your anesthetist today." She probably said it with a smile—I couldn’t see her mouth with the mask on.

"You're a bit early, we're still cleaning the operation room for you."

I saw the previous patient a few feet away. He was clearly knocked out good. His head hung to the side and his face was pale like a ghost.

"Early?" The nurse laughed. "I thought we were late since the door wouldn't open."

The anesthetist gazed at the nurse. "Oh, well there are some technical issues here, but luckily nothing big yet."

The anesthetist thanked the nurse. "We'll take over from here."

It took a few minutes before we were able to go into the operation room. The anesthetist said she would start with inserting the IV. In the meantime, I was looking around the rather large room. A lot of doctors, surgeons, nurses, and medical professionals were walking all around. I could tell the urgency in their body language.

It's like they... *>!illegible!<*

Everyone was making haste. Like they all needed to finish their job quickly. As I was staring at them, I suddenly felt a sharp sting in my left hand. My body reacted with a short shock.

"Oh Sir, I'm so sorry!" the anesthetist said. "I forgot to warn you about inserting the IV. It's quite busy here, I completely forgot to tell you to brace yourself a bit."

I told her it was fine, but in reality, with everything that was going on I felt more and more nervous.

After a short wait, the operation room was cleaned and I was rolled in. The surgeon asked me in a calm voice:

"Hello Sir, would you kindly tell me your name and tell me what we're going to do today?"

I answered him and he nodded.

"When was the last time you ate something, Sir?"

I answered him again and was reminded how I didn't eat in the last 14 hours. I suddenly realized how hungry I was at this point.

"We will now start putting you under anesthesia, so we can start the operation," the surgeon said.

An assistant put a mask on my face. "You might feel a little dizzy now. Please count from ten to zero slowly," he said.

I could hear some sort of machine suddenly start beeping rapidly in the distance. I heard someone saying loudly:

"Really? It's going into error mode *now*!?"

I remember nothing after that. It all went black. Like a candle being blown out, my consciousness just disconnected...

I don't know how long it took. But it's like my brain slowly came back online. I had no dreams, no sense of time passing, and thankfully, no sudden wake-up during surgery. There was only blackness and void. I could barely open my eyes. The light was too bright to see anything.

I heard absolute silence. No voices, beeping sounds, just nothing. My back was the first thing I felt. Like I'd been sleeping in way too long. The back of my head felt sweaty.

I was actually surprised how awake I was. Like the lights in my mind were turned off, then immediately on again. I lifted my head up and rested it on its left side. The fresh air on the back of my head felt good.

I slowly moved my hand to where my gallbladder used to be. The gauze that was on the wound fell off with the slightest touch of my left hand. I thought about how poorly it stuck to the wound. They probably did that in a hurry as well.

I did feel my right hand, but I couldn't move it as freely as my left hand. Like some object was on top of it. I was slowly trying to squint my eyes open, but they were still strongly blinded by the light.

I didn't feel anything from the wound. Painkillers probably. I wanted to know how it felt, even if it would be better not to touch the freshly made cut. Curiosity got the better of me though. A little feel wouldn't hurt. Besides, the gauze had already fallen off. I slowly moved my fingers over my stomach to the wound on my chest.

I felt a little dent in my skin. But it was strange. I felt a bit further around the area. But there were no stitches, no signs of broken skin. Just the dent in my skin. It felt like a scar already.

I started to move more parts of my body. First my toes, then my feet, and finally my legs. All intact. But my right hand still felt like it had something on it. I could lift it a little bit. I didn't want to throw it off without seeing what it was. So again, I tried opening my eyes. Finally, something came into my field of sight.

My head was facing the door of my hospital room. I saw the rays of sunlight on the door. As I looked at the rays of light, I saw how it reflected every bit of dust that was floating in the air. Man, this room looks dusty with the sun shining on it.

As my eyes got used to the light, I saw more of the room. My clothes were neatly folded on the little nightstand next to the hospital bed. Exactly how I left them there. I couldn’t help but notice how much dust was on them. In fact, the whole nightstand was covered in a thick layer of dust. How could that be?

I wanted to sit up a bit more, but was reminded of the object that was laying on my right hand. I turned my head to the right to see what kept my hand in place.

What I saw next was an image I will never forget until my last day on Earth. If I even have many days left.

On my right hand rested another hand. A skeletal hand. Its grey bones were clenched on my hand, like it still had some form of grip. But it was not only a skeletal hand. My sight followed the hand to the remains of the body it was attached to.

I turned my face further to the right and stared directly into two black eye sockets. The skull was just a few inches away from my face.

This startled me so bad that I flinched backwards—so much that I fell from the bed on the other side. It must've looked cartoonish how the dust sprung up when I landed on the ground. Still in a bit of a daze, I gathered the strength to stand up. I looked at the skeleton that now had fallen forward on the bed.

It was then that I noticed the second skeleton. It sat in a chair in the corner of the room. It had its legs folded on the chair. I looked at the whole scene, but only when I saw the phone on the chair, it clicked in my brain.

That was my daughter's phone...

That would mean that I was looking at my wife and daughter.

As completely bare skeletons. There was not a sign of skin on them.

I dropped to my knees. I looked at the skeleton that used to be my wife. I started sobbing as her words echoed in my head:

*"When you wake up, we'll be right here next to you..."*

I remained in the room in silence for what must've been an hour, before pulling myself together.

"No, this is impossible!" I yelled, breaking the silence.

There was no logical way for this to be true. It simply couldn't happen. So my next thought was that it was likely a dream. I'm still in surgery and in my anxious state, I'm giving myself nightmares. That made sense. It's all in my head...

But it just feels too real.

I pinched myself. And it hurt. I touched my daughter's skull and it felt dusty, and real like everything else. It feels too real to be a dream. But I just couldn't see any other logical conclusion.

I picked up my daughter's phone. Dead, of course. My wife had a charger in her bag. I took it out and plugged the phone in.

No power. I could've expected that. Great. Now I felt sad *ánd* dumb.

It did make me rethink things. No power... all the radio interference. Did the whole hospital lose power while I was in surgery? I remembered the rapid beeping sound right before I was put under anesthesia.

But how would that cause my family to turn into skeletons?
And why didn't I turn into one?

As the sunlight brightened for a second, I noticed the sleep device. The little machine that kept me in a coma-like state. Did this thing keep me alive? But how? I was attached to it through my IV. Now that I think of it—how could an IV tied to the sleep device keep a human alive? I had no tubes in my throat when I woke up.

All the power was gone, but this thing was said to last for months, even during a power outage. Either way, the device didn't work anymore.

I was so confused. I needed help or someone who could explain things to me.

And so I put on my clothes. They felt all worn and dirty, but I just bought the set last week. It didn't matter. I looked back into the room one more time. My brain could not accept this truth yet.

I walked out the room and started looking for other people.

I stepped into the hallway and the whole atmosphere here was the same. Everything was just dusty and felt abandoned. I saw multiple skeletons scattered across the floor.

My stomach growled like crazy. No wonder—I felt like I haven't eaten in days.

I decided to go grab something to eat first. I followed the directions to the cafeteria.

All the way there I couldn't find even a single sign of life. There were only bare skeletons. I noticed how all of them just seemed to have been frozen in what they were doing. Like they were just doing their thing and suddenly everyone simply froze in place.

I saw the skeletons of what were once men and women. But also children's skeletons, and I even saw what looked like a baby, likely still inside its mother's womb.

I walked into the kitchen area of the cafeteria. I opened the fridge there. It was a horrible decision, because as soon as I opened it, a foul stench came from it. The inside of the fridge was covered with a thick layer of black mold. I slammed the fridge door shut.

I looked around the kitchen cabinets. The best thing I found was canned soup. I had no way of cooking it, but cold soup is better than nothing. I opened the can. It still smelled okay. The taste of cold soup was still disgusting.

I'm glad I still kept searching in the meantime, because eventually I found a jar of honey. Honey never expires.

I took the jar, a spoon, and two bottles of water with me. Just as I made my way out of the kitchen, I heard a loud *bang* behind me. I turned quickly. There was nothing there. The only thing I saw was the kitchen door slowly closing and a can of soup rolling on the floor.

While I initially hoped to find a living person, I prayed that this was just an animal.

As the exit was close, I thought it would be wise to check the outside world. I walked in the direction of the exit and occasionally ate a spoon of honey.

The huge revolving doors at the exit were out of order. The small door next to it was open.

When I came outside, the only thing I could see was a yellow-brown thick fog. But somehow, the sunlight still came through. I stood outside for a short while. I'm not sure if I should try and find my car. But in this fog, I couldn’t drive home.

What would I even do if I managed to get home?

As I was contemplating what I should do next, I heard something in the distance. A high-pitched electronic sound. I tried to focus on where it came from. As I was doing so, the sound came closer very quickly. It went from zero to a hundred fast.

I stepped back towards the hospital slowly. It got so loud that it hurt my ears.

I ran back inside, and before I knew it, I could hear a loud thud outside the hospital.

I looked back and saw something I can't fully describe. It was like a large black hazy shadow.

I turned and ran back through the hospital entrance hall. I looked back again. The shadow took on a human size. It moved, in what I could only describe as a glitchy way. It moved fast through the entrance hall towards me. It snapped itself in one place, then snapped itself a bit closer to me.

I was frozen in place for a second, but when I heard the high-pitched electronic sound, I came to my senses and ran back deeper inside the hospital.

The only place I knew where I could go was back to my wife and daughter.

I heard the entity following me. I didn't dare to look back. I ran with every bit of strength I had in my body.

When I finally reached my hospital room again, I ran inside and shut the door. The sound immediately stopped.

I sat on the floor between the skeletons of my wife and daughter. Waiting for this creature, or supernatural being, to burst in and devour me.

But nothing happened.

It remained silent. Like it was never even there. The silence took over again.

Nothing makes sense to me now. It seems like the whole hospital died out and time stood still for decades, or maybe even centuries. I have no idea how much time has passed and why my body would survive without food or water for so long.

I'm not sure what killed everyone and I'm not sure what caused it. I've been thinking to either step out there and face it, or if I could maybe attach myself to the sleep device again and see when I wake up again.

I'm lucky to have found this notebook in the nightstand. Now I can write down what happened to me.

I want to ask to whoever finds this notebook, to please share it. Tell it, or if the world is ever online again, publish it somewhere, so people know what happened.

I don't think I'll survive this. I see it moving in front of my door every now and then.

So please don't let me or my family be forgotten.

Sincerely, *>!illegible!<*
