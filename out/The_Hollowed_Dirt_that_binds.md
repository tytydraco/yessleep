The Hollowed Dirt that Binds

Part I – The Silence After

The house still breathed, though the lungs that once filled it were gone. The wind pressed softly against the rotting shutters, the beams croaked in their age, and beneath the floorboards the rats whispered as they gnawed through the bones of the past. Elias Morne sat at the kitchen table, hands clasped before him, the ghost of steam rising from a cup that had long gone cold.

He had not spoken in days. There was no one left to answer.

The farmhouse stood alone on a barren stretch of land, black soil and brittle weeds stretching to the horizon. Once, he’d thought it beautiful — the land his wife had loved, where their child had taken her first steps, where the light had once pooled in the windows like something holy. Now the same light was thin, exhausted, as though the sun itself mourned the family that had perished within those walls.

Their faces refused to leave him. Every mirror reflected fragments of them: a glimpse of his wife’s hair in the corner of his vision, the soft sound of his daughter’s laughter echoing from upstairs. But when he turned, there was only dust motes hanging in the gray light.

He told himself it was just the mind adjusting to solitude. Grief had a way of making ghosts out of memory. Still, at night, when the wind moved through the farmhouse’s bones, he thought he heard footsteps — light, uncertain, pacing just beyond the closed door of the nursery.

He kept that door locked. Always.

It had been six months since the fever took them. Six months of dirt under his nails, unshaven stubble on his face, and sleepless eyes. The fever had come in the spring, swift and merciless. It had burned through the village like a curse, and when it reached their home, Elias had been powerless. He remembered his wife, pale as wax, her lips trembling as she whispered their daughter’s name. He remembered the small, still body in his arms, warmth fading too fast.

He had buried them behind the farmhouse, beneath the crooked willow. The soil was soft that day. He had dug until his hands bled, and afterward he had not stopped. Every day, for weeks, he dug again — not graves, not holes, but trenches, as if he could somehow unearth what he’d lost.

Now the earth behind the house looked like it had been clawed at by an animal.

Sometimes, when the nights stretched too long, Elias went to the graves and pressed his ear to the soil. Listening. Hoping to hear something that wasn’t silence.

He never did.

⸻

The days bled together. He marked them with scratches on the wall near the kitchen window — a calendar of grief. The sound of the knife scoring the wood was the only rhythm left in his life. Eat. Drink. Stare. Sleep. Wake. Repeat.

But the house changed as he did. The walls began to sweat, leaking moisture in the evenings. The cellar smelled of rot, though he hadn’t stored food there in months. The floors groaned as if they were remembering too much weight. And in the corners, where the candlelight couldn’t reach, shadows lingered too long.

Elias thought about leaving — about walking until his body collapsed in the fields. But he couldn’t abandon them. The graves behind the willow were the only things still tethering him to the world. If he left, who would remember them? Who would keep the house standing?

So he stayed. And the house kept him.

⸻

On the forty-seventh day after the first frost, a crow crashed against the kitchen window. Elias startled so violently that his chair toppled over. The bird’s neck snapped instantly, its body sliding down the glass, leaving a dark, oily streak.

He stared at it for a long time before opening the door. The winter air bit his face. He picked up the crow, its feathers slick with blood, and held it like something sacred. He didn’t know why, but it felt like a message — a sign.

He buried the bird beneath the willow beside his family. When he patted the soil flat again, his hands came away streaked with a darker color than earth. The smell was wrong. Sweet, almost metallic.

That night, he dreamed of whispering voices beneath the dirt.

⸻

By the third month of snow, the isolation had stopped feeling temporary. He no longer expected visitors. The roads were gone beneath ice, and no one had come from the village in weeks. When he tried to recall faces of neighbors, the shapes slipped away like fog.

On a lone evening, he found himself sitting on the floor of the nursery. The door had been locked for months, yet somehow it had come open. The faint scent of lavender and old wood greeted him. Dust blanketed the small bed, the toys, and the rocking chair.

He reached for the little carved horse his daughter used to hold. The wood was cracked, the paint faded, but his hands trembled as he turned it over.

He stayed there until morning, rocking silently in the chair, holding that horse to his chest. When the dawn came, he realized his cheeks were wet — and not just from tears. The air in the room was damp, as though the house itself had been crying with him.

⸻

Then came the scratching.

It began softly, beneath the floorboards. Elias thought it was the rats again. But it didn’t stop. It grew more deliberate. Scrape. Pause. Scrape. Almost rhythmic, almost human.

He pressed his ear to the floor and whispered, “Is someone there?”

No answer — only the deep groan of old wood. But that night, the scratching came again. Closer. Beneath his bed.

He stopped sleeping. The circles under his eyes darkened like bruises. He sat awake by candlelight, clutching a rusted shovel like a weapon, waiting for the sound to return.

And when it didn’t, he missed it.

The silence felt heavier than the noise.

⸻

The first time he saw her again, it was only a trick of the light. His wife stood at the edge of the field, her white dress rippling in the cold wind. He ran to her — through the frost, through the breathless distance — but when he reached the willow, there was only the grave. Only the dirt.

Still, he swore he saw her lips moving, whispering his name from beneath the soil.

When he returned to the house, his hands were covered in blood. He didn’t remember what he had done.

⸻

Elias stopped marking the wall after that. Days and nights had become one long stretch of decay. His food ran out. His candles burned to stubs. But the hunger that grew in him wasn’t for bread. It was something else. Something deeper, older, crawling beneath his ribs.

Sometimes, when the wind carried the smell of the grave through the cracks in the walls, he would breathe it in and feel… alive.

And somewhere below the farmhouse floor, something answered his hunger with its own.

Part II – The Weight of the Walls

By the time the second winter moon had risen, the farmhouse no longer seemed to rest upon the earth — it seemed to sink into it. Elias felt the shift in its bones: the doors that stuck even when he pressed his shoulder against them, the walls that bowed inward as though straining to listen. He could feel the slow heartbeat of the wood at night. It throbbed like something alive.

He began to speak again, just to fill the silence. At first, it was only muttering to himself: half-formed prayers, apologies, and promises whispered into the empty rooms. Then, the words took shape. He spoke to them. His wife. His daughter. Their names were thin in his throat — dust and air — but saying them felt like opening a window after years of rot.

“Lydia,” he whispered to the dark. “Mira.”

The names echoed strangely in the halls, as though the house repeated them, testing their shape. Sometimes, when he paused to listen, the echo didn’t come from where it should have. Once, it came from behind him — close enough that he felt breath on his neck.

He turned, but there was no one.

⸻

The nights were worse. Elias had stopped lighting candles; the flickering light only made the shadows move. Instead, he learned to see in the dark — to read the faint glow of the moon as it filtered through broken panes and the gaps between boards.

He started hearing soft sounds. A woman’s sigh. The shuffling of a child’s feet on old wood. The faint tinkling of laughter like glass falling in another room. When he called out, the noises stopped instantly, as if the house were holding its breath.

The scratching under the floor returned, more frantic now. It came from beneath the nursery.

He stood above the spot one night, holding the shovel in both hands. He told himself he would dig — he would find the animal, the thing that tormented him. But his arms refused to move. He was afraid of what he might uncover.

Instead, he whispered through the floorboards, his voice shaking. “Are you still there?”

A pause. Then, faintly, impossibly — three knocks from below.

⸻

In the days that followed, Elias stopped eating. The hunger in him no longer felt human. It wasn’t just emptiness — it was a pull, a deep ache that seemed to drag him downward. Toward the ground. Toward the graves.

He began sleeping on the floor, where the boards were coldest. He would wake with his cheek pressed against the wood, the smell of soil clinging to him. He could almost feel something moving beneath, like slow hands pushing upward.

In a sorrowful morning, when he awoke, he found his fingernails packed with dirt. He had no memory of digging.

That night, he dreamed of Lydia.

She stood in the kitchen doorway, her face pale but smiling. Her eyes were gone, replaced by two black hollows that seemed to shimmer like wet glass. “You left us,” she whispered. “No,” he said, shaking his head. “You left me.” Her smile widened until her jaw creaked. “Then come find us.”

He woke to the sound of the floorboards breathing.

⸻

Elias tried to leave once. He packed a small bag, wrapped himself in his coat, and stepped out into the brittle morning. Frost covered the world like ash. The fields stretched flat and endless, the fence posts bowed and broken.

But when he turned to look back at the house, he froze.

The windows were watching him.

Every pane of glass reflected his face — dozens of them, each warped, each wearing a different expression. In one, he was crying. In another, smiling. In another still, his mouth hung open as though he were screaming silently.

He took a step backward. The snow beneath his boots groaned, hollow. He realized he was standing on disturbed ground — not far from the willow.

The earth there had sunk. As though something beneath had begun to rise.

He dropped his bag and ran back inside.

The door shut behind him on its own.

⸻

He began to write. It was the only thing that made sense anymore. He tore the blank pages from old ledgers, scrawling words in the candlelight with a quill and dried ink. At first, it was journal entries — fragments of memory, things he didn’t want to forget. Lydia’s laugh. Mira’s curls. The smell of bread baking in the morning.

Then the words changed. They stopped being memories and became instructions.

He wrote about the soil — about how it whispered to him. About how it needed something to grow. He wrote about the voice that came through the floor, telling him what to feed it.

“Just a little,” it said. “Only enough to wake us.”

He wasn’t sure whose hand wrote the words anymore. The script changed halfway through, smaller, more delicate — like Lydia’s.

⸻

The weather turned. Storms rolled across the fields, battering the house with wind and sleet. The roof leaked, and water dripped steadily into bowls Elias set on the floor. The sound was maddening: drip, drip, drip — a rhythm that matched the beating of his heart.

He began talking to the drips. Counting them. Naming them. One was Lydia. Another was Mira. A third — a voice he didn’t recognize — was simply “the guest.”

“The guest” spoke often. Its voice came from beneath the floorboards, low and rasping, but oddly patient. It told Elias that grief was a door, and he had already opened it. “You’ve done so well,” it whispered. “Now you must finish what you began.”

“What did I begin?” Elias would ask. “The burial,” it said. “And the undoing.”

⸻

He started to rot before he understood what that meant.

It began with the smell — faint, sour, like something turning inside him. Then came the bruises that never faded, the pale blotches on his arms. His breath grew shallow. His reflection, when he dared look, seemed to darken around the eyes.

But he didn’t feel ill. If anything, he felt stronger. The hunger sharpened, but it was no longer painful — it was purposeful.

The guest spoke to him every night now. “You are hollow,” it said. “Hollow things can be filled.”

He tried to resist at first, clutching his wife’s old rosary, muttering prayers through cracked lips. But the prayers came out wrong. The words twisted halfway, turning to murmurs he didn’t recognize.

One night, as he prayed, he heard laughter from beneath the floor — the laughter of a child. It was joyous, alive. He fell to his knees, tears streaming down his face.

“Mira?” he whispered.

The boards beneath him pulsed. The laughter turned into something wet and slow — a gurgling sound, like breath through water.

And Elias, trembling, pressed his hands to the floor and whispered, “What do you want me to do?”

The answer came from everywhere at once, echoing through the house, the walls, his bones.

“Feed us.”

⸻

He didn’t question it. Grief had long since rotted into something else — devotion, perhaps, or madness. He went to the cellar, where the earth was softest, and began to dig again. Each shovel of soil felt like exhaling. Each breath filled him with the smell of home.

He wasn’t sure how long he worked. When he stopped, he saw his hands were raw, the skin split. Blood soaked the dirt.

From the hole, something shifted.

Something beneath the soil moved toward him.

And for the first time in months, Elias Mornes smiled.

Part III – The Rot in the Fields

Spring did not come that year. Or if it did, it came twisted. The snow melted too fast, the rivers swelled and then vanished, leaving behind only silt and the smell of something sick. The land around the Mornes farmhouse, once green and alive, now lay drowned in mud. The earth pulsed faintly beneath Elias’s boots as though the ground itself still breathed.

He spent most of his days in the fields. He did not remember walking there; he would simply arrive, shovel in hand, the hem of his coat heavy with mud. He dug small holes, not graves, but open mouths in the earth. In each, he buried things the voice beneath the floor had asked for — bones from the cellar, the last of his food, sometimes the small birds that struck the farmhouse windows and fell still in the grass.

Each time, he whispered the same words: “Wake them.”

The holes never stayed filled for long. By morning, the dirt in each one had sunken slightly, as though something below had swallowed the offering whole.

⸻

Elias’s body no longer obeyed the rules of life. His skin had turned gray at the edges, veins dark as roots threading through his arms. His nails had thickened and blackened, and his reflection in the window glass was a stranger’s face — sunken eyes, slack mouth, a shadow of what had been a man.

He no longer felt pain, only pressure. Hunger came and went like the tide. When he pressed his fingers to the pulse at his neck, it beat slow, unsteady — like something remembering how to live.

He told himself it was just exhaustion. But deep down, he knew.

He was beginning to join them.

⸻

At night, he sat in the kitchen, listening to the walls breathe. The voices had grown bolder, louder. Lydia spoke most often, her tone gentle and patient, as though coaxing a child. “You’ve done so well,” she would murmur. “We’re almost home.”

Sometimes, she sang to him. Her lullabies were wrong now, the melody distorted, but the sound filled him with warmth nonetheless. Mira’s laughter came between the verses — bright and wet, like bubbles rising through water.

The house no longer frightened him. The decay had become familiar, even comforting. Mold crept along the walls in delicate spirals, like veins of new life. The wood warped, soft beneath his touch, pulsing faintly as if it had blood of its own.

The boundary between the living and the dead had worn thin.

⸻

A few days later Elias awoke in the field with soil under his tongue. The taste was bitter, metallic, but he swallowed it anyway. The dirt slid down his throat like wine. He could feel it settling in him, heavy and alive.

When he looked down, his hands were buried in the ground up to the wrists. The earth clung to him like flesh, warm and pliant. He didn’t pull away.

From somewhere deep below, something shifted — a heartbeat, vast and slow, matching his own.

He whispered to the soil, “I’m here.”

The ground answered with a low hum that vibrated through his bones.

⸻

Days no longer held meaning. Time was measured only by the state of the bodies in the ground — his wife’s grave, his daughter’s, and the small pit where he had buried the crow. The soil above them bulged and quivered now, like breath beneath a shroud.

He began to see shapes at night. Not shadows — forms. His wife standing in the doorway, her face still and pale; his daughter crouched near the stairs, her hands dark with soil. They never spoke, but they watched him.

When he tried to touch them, his fingers passed through cold air. But the smell of earth followed them everywhere they went.

He dreamed of lying between them in the dirt, their hands tangled with his, their voices whispering to him through the soil: You can’t bring us back, Elias. You can only join us.

He would wake with his mouth full of dirt and the sound of his heart slowing.

⸻

The animals stopped coming near the farmhouse. The crows that had once gathered on the roof vanished. Even the rats had fled. The air itself seemed to rot, heavy with the scent of wet decay.

When the wind blew through the broken fence, it carried with it a low moan — not quite human, not quite wind. Elias sometimes caught himself humming along with it.

On a particular evening, he caught sight of movement at the edge of the field — a deer, thin and trembling. Hunger stirred in him like a spark. He didn’t remember chasing it, or catching it, or the way its body broke beneath his hands.

He only remembered the taste.

When he came back to himself, he was kneeling in the mud, his mouth slick with blood, the animal torn open before him. Its eyes stared glassily at the sky.

He wept afterward, though not for long. The taste lingered in his mouth like a confession.

⸻

The next day, the voice of “the guest” returned, closer now, no longer muffled by the floor. “You see?” it said. “The living were never meant to be alone. They must return to the soil.”

Elias wanted to protest, to scream that he didn’t mean to, that he wasn’t that kind of man. But when he opened his mouth, his voice came out wrong — wet, guttural, like something speaking through water.

“You’re learning,” the guest whispered. “The dead remember differently.”

That night, his reflection in the window no longer blinked when he did.

⸻

His thoughts became scattered, half-formed. He forgot how long it had been since the fever. He forgot the faces of the villagers. Even Lydia’s voice began to blend with the others. There were so many now — hundreds, maybe more — murmuring in the walls, the floors, the soil.

He stopped keeping the door locked. The nursery stayed open, the small bed still made. Sometimes he found footprints in the dust, small and wet, leading to his chair in the kitchen. He didn’t question them.

He was beginning to lose the distinction between haunting and home.

⸻

What he was becoming appeared in the morning when he tried to cut his hand on a shard of broken glass. The glass split, but his skin did not. Instead, the flesh bent — soft and thick, like clay. When he pressed the wound, black fluid seeped out, thick as oil. It didn’t hurt.

The smell was sweet, the same as the earth behind the house.

He smeared the blackness across the windowpane, watching how it shimmered in the weak sunlight. The glass cracked under his touch, spreading veins of shadow outward like spider silk.

He laughed softly to himself. It sounded wrong — too dry, too empty.

⸻

By the time summer should have come, the sky remained gray and low. The world around the farmhouse had gone silent. The soil in the fields pulsed with slow, steady movement — like a buried heartbeat. The crops that had once grown there now sprouted pale shoots that looked disturbingly like fingers.

Elias tended to them as though they were his garden. He whispered to them, watered them with his own blood, and watched them twitch when he sang his wife’s lullabies.

He didn’t notice that the skin on his arms had begun to peel away in patches, revealing dark, leathery tissue beneath. Or perhaps he did notice — and no longer cared.

He was becoming part of the house, the land, the rot.

⸻

As dusk bled across the sky, Elias stood beneath the willow tree and heard something shift beneath the graves.

“Is it time?” he asked aloud.

The earth stirred. He could smell the rich sweetness of decay, the soft, heavy scent of the dead.

“Almost,” the voice said. “One more breath, one more night.”

He looked down at his hands — trembling, cracked, black-veined — and smiled faintly.

The hunger had returned, and this time he understood what it meant.

It wasn’t for food. It was for home.

And home, he realized, was beneath the earth.

Part IV – The Hunger Beneath the Floorboards

The storm broke after three days of stillness. Rain fell in sheets, pounding against the roof, forcing the rot deeper into the beams. The wind howled through every crack in the farmhouse, and water pooled on the floors like sweat from the body of the house itself.

Elias sat in the kitchen and listened. The storm’s voice was not a natural one — it carried the rhythm of breath, inhaling and exhaling through the chimney. Each gust whispered his name.

“Elias,” it moaned. He whispered back, “I’m here.”

He had not eaten in days. The hunger had changed again — not in the belly but in the marrow, in the deep center of his being. He could feel the bones in his arms vibrating softly, like tuning forks. Sometimes, when he held them near the wall, the sound matched the humming within the wood.

The house and his body were beginning to speak the same language.

⸻

He could feel the cellar calling. The door had swollen with damp, the hinges rusted, but the sound came from below — slow scratching, measured, patient. It had been weeks since he’d dared go down there. That was where the guest had first spoken to him, where he had dug the hole that bled.

Now the voice returned, clear and steady.

“Come back,” it said. “Finish what you started.”

He rose from the table, the chair scraping against the floor. The motion felt automatic, his body pulled by something unseen. Each step toward the cellar door sent a tremor through the boards. The house groaned as though shifting to make way for him.

When he touched the doorknob, it was warm.

⸻

The cellar smelled like wet stone and iron. His candle flickered weakly, throwing long shadows across the steps. Each one creaked as though protesting his weight.

The hole he’d dug weeks ago had grown wider. The soil around it glistened with black moisture, seeping like open veins. Something in the air pulsed — not quite sound, not quite vibration.

Elias knelt at the edge. “Lydia?” he whispered.

At first, nothing. Then — faintly — the sound of breathing. Shallow, uneven, coming from the earth itself.

He reached into the hole, fingers brushing the damp soil. It was warm. Alive. When he pulled his hand back, the black mud clung to him, writhing slightly, as though it didn’t want to let go.

“Feed us,” the voice said again. It was not one voice anymore, but many — his wife’s, his daughter’s, and hundreds more, tangled together in a chorus of hunger.

Elias wept. “I don’t know what you want.”

The soil quivered. “You do.”

⸻

The candlelight dimmed until the cellar lay in near-darkness. Elias pressed both hands into the earth. The sensation was electric — heat, movement, a pulse that climbed through his arms. His heart began to pound in rhythm with it, and soon he could no longer tell where his heartbeat ended and the soil’s began.

He felt something move beneath his palms — small fingers brushing his skin. Then a larger hand, thin and cold, gripping his wrist.

“Lydia,” he sobbed.

The hand tightened. The soil split open like a mouth.

He didn’t resist when it pulled him down.

⸻

The world below the farmhouse was a different one — damp tunnels winding into endless darkness. He couldn’t see, but he didn’t need to. He felt everything: the slow movement of worms through the earth, the whisper of bones shifting against stone, the cold touch of old water running between unseen walls.

He crawled through the tunnel on his hands and knees, guided by the whispers.

They surrounded him — voices overlapping in a thousand forgotten tones. Some he recognized: his wife’s laugh, his daughter’s song. Others were strangers, voices of the land itself.

Each whisper brushed against his skin, leaving behind warmth and rot. His body felt too tight, too human for the space he occupied. He could feel it changing, expanding, shedding.

When he reached a wider chamber, the ground glowed faintly — a deep red shimmer, like embers beneath the soil.

There, half-buried, were the remains of his wife and child. Or what he thought were their remains. The bones pulsed with a faint light, veins of black growth threading through them like roots.

He fell to his knees. “I’m here,” he whispered. “I came back.”

The bones shifted. The skulls turned toward him, mouths opening in a slow, soundless cry.

“We know,” they said — though no lips moved.

⸻

The voice of the guest returned, stronger than ever, filling the chamber.

“Do you see now?” it said. “They were never taken. They were sown.”

Elias trembled. “Sown?”

“You buried them, Elias. You placed them in the earth. And the earth remembered.”

He looked down at the ground — at the faintly glowing veins that pulsed outward from the graves. They spread in every direction, connecting to the roots of the willow above, to the fields, to the walls of the farmhouse itself.

“They’re part of everything,” the guest said. “And so are you.”

Elias’s hands sank deeper into the soil. The earth clung to him greedily, pulling him downward, threading through his fingers and under his skin. He could feel it replacing his veins, filling him with dark, rich substance.

The pain came next — not sharp, but deep, like something being unstitched. He gasped as his chest split open and the soil poured in. It filled every hollow space inside him, whispering in familiar voices.

We missed you, Elias.

He screamed, and the sound was swallowed by the earth.

⸻

When he crawled back up from the cellar hours later, or days — he could no longer tell — the storm had stopped. The air was still and heavy. The house was quiet.

He stumbled into the kitchen, dripping mud, his movements slow and jerky. His eyes no longer adjusted to the light. The candle burned, but he saw it only as a smear of color, a pulse of heat.

He looked down at his hands. They were blackened now, the fingers slightly too long, the nails gray and sharp. His reflection in the cracked window revealed a face half-collapsed, the skin clinging to the bone like old parchment. Yet he could still see himself within it — faintly, like a shadow behind glass.

He touched his face. The skin felt numb, pliant, soft. He tried to speak, but his tongue felt wrong in his mouth — swollen, heavy. The words came out as groans.

Still, he smiled.

He had found them.

⸻

The days that followed were a blur of motion and stillness. Elias no longer slept. He wandered the house in circles, tracing the walls with blackened fingers. The mold had spread to every surface now, thick and gray-green, soft as skin. The windows were opaque with filth.

He could hear them everywhere. Lydia’s voice from the attic, Mira’s laughter in the walls. Sometimes he thought he saw them standing in doorways — not as ghosts but as shapes of flesh and soil, growing more solid each time.

They whispered to him as he moved: It’s almost time. You’ve almost joined us.

He didn’t resist anymore. His heart no longer beat. The breath that left his mouth came as mist, faint and sweet-smelling.

He began to eat the soil. Not out of hunger, but reverence. Each handful filled him with warmth, with memory. He could taste Lydia’s hair, Mira’s small hands, the scent of the farmhouse in better years.

He was no longer grieving. He was remembering.

And remembrance was resurrection.

⸻

The night before the final transformation, he stood beneath the willow. The ground there pulsed like the skin of some enormous animal. The air was thick with fog, and every breath tasted like rain.

He could feel the world beneath his feet — alive, vast, waiting.

“Take me,” he whispered. “I’m ready.”

The earth stirred. The roots rose, coiling around his legs like fingers. They tightened, pulling him slowly downward. The soil opened beneath him, swallowing him inch by inch.

He did not fight.

As the dirt closed over his head, the last thing he heard was Lydia’s voice — soft, tender, unrecognizable.

“Welcome home.”
