Before I explain what I went through, you need to know a little about me.

My name is Isaac, and I was religious up until I was a sophomore in high school. I lost my faith after realizing my family used God as a suspiciously conditional surveillance system instead of a loving savior.

When I finally had enough of my family’s antics, I left home. I worked three jobs just to stay afloat, but the exhaustion was worth it to afford college and a place of my own.

That was around the time I started coding PC mods. It gave me a sense of control I’d never had before. Coding became an obsession that led me into forgotten corners of the internet searching for games, mods, and anything that allowed me to experiment and reshape.

But my insatiable desire to tinker with digital worlds took an unexpected turn when I stumbled across a game called, V.I.R.T.U.E.  

I never downloaded V.I.R.T.U.E.; it appeared on my desktop one day like it had manifested itself into existence. I shared the game’s link to some PC friends in a Discord group chat hoping for some answers, but nobody had a clue as to what it was.  

My friend Jake guessed that it might have been some indie developer’s first game, lost to time. Another friend, Travis, suggested that it might have been an abandoned project from a now bankrupt gaming company. Personally though, I thought it was something far stranger. 

The mysterious file had a single executable labeled: **VIRTUE.EXE.** and it contained a readme that said: 

*“Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin. There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death.”*

It was as unsettling to read as it was accusatory, but it wasn’t the only strange thing I uncovered. When I analyzed the text file’s metadata, it listed a “creation date” that predated my PC’s BIOS by nearly twenty-seven years. “The Witness” was the only thing listed in the author field. 

I ran a few quick packet traces to see if the executable was communicating with a remote server, and while it was, the IP that was connected wasn’t a valid one I could access. The IP address was listed solely as **∞**.

It shouldn’t have been possible, but it was sending and receiving packets to somewhere I didn’t have clearance to enter. 

I refreshed the trace multiple times and every time I did, the numbers would shift and rearrange themselves. It was like they were trying to assemble something. 

Convinced that what was in front of me was a glitch of some kind, I dug deeper. I found no mentions of the file online, and there were no hidden metadata trails or source code comments that could pinpoint its exact origins. The data seemingly defied the logic. 

When I opened the readme again, the text inside had been edited to read: *“Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above.”*.

Something inside me told me to delete the program and walk away, but I didn’t out of curiosity.  I hovered my cursor over the executable before I double-clicked **V.I.R.T.U.E.EXE.**.

The best way that I can describe V.I.R.T.U.E. is to imagine the sandbox simulator gameplay of *The Sims* with a greater emphasis on morality. 

Right from the start, you weren’t in control of just a singular person, you were in control of a whole city. 

The way it worked was that each time you started a new session, a random town would generate, complete with NPCs of various names, race, religious backgrounds, etc. Your main objective was to go about clicking these NPCs with the golden hand AKA your cursor. It was simple in terms of control, left click was to bless, and right click was to smite. 

A running “Virtue Score” was displayed in the upper right-hand corner, indicating that every choice that the player made added or subtracted morality points. 

The gameplay itself was immensely enjoyable, even if the morality of my choices sometimes felt questionable. 

A corrupt politician lying through his teeth? Struck by lightning on his golf trip.

An angry customer who had to wait longer than a couple of minutes for their food at Taco Bell? I made their car stall on the interstate. 

A kid helping an old lady put groceries in her car? I cured his dog’s leukemia.

Someone struggling to put food on the table? I made sure they got the call back from the job they had applied to. 

V.I.R.T.U.E. was like some kind of karma machine disguised as a computer game. With each choice I made, I couldn’t shake the feeling of my parents’ eyes watching and judging my actions, waiting for me to mess up. 

Every decision was the difference between earning their approval or being punished with their sermons about divine justice. 

The sound effects weren’t helping things either. Whenever I would bless someone, the sound of warm, gentle chimes rang out, but when I would smite someone, the guttural rumble of thunder could be heard through my monitor’s speaker. 

I decided to create two save files so that I could continue to test further. One was named **“Mercy”**, and the other was **“Wrath”**.

When I loaded **“Mercy”**, I solely acted benevolent. I blessed people when they were at rock bottom, gave poverty-stricken areas copious amounts of food, and made sure the headlines were softer overall. 

When I switched to **“Wrath”** though, I was a menace. I made the stock market crash, summoned storms to destroy vast areas, and watched as crime rates skyrocketed to an all-time high across the city.

The dopamine rush was intoxicating, until the headlines in V.I.R.T.U.E. started coming to life.

I told myself that it was just the game pulling data from some random news API, but the story appeared on the website of my local news station. 

A senator whose in-game counterpart I had punished barely ten minutes earlier had been struck by lightning on a golf outing.

More stories kept coming over the next few days I played.

A celebrity that I had cured of cancer in my **“Mercy”** file officially announced that her cancer was in remission due to successful chemotherapy treatments. 

A suspect of a hit-and-run case that I’d smited earlier on the **“Wrath”** file had been involved in a lethal car accident after fleeing the police. 

It had to be algorithmic coincidences or odd twists of fate —but the more headlines that poured in, the harder it became to deny the power that rested in my hands. 

V.I.R.T.U.E. wasn’t merely simulating a world for gameplay; it was actively displaying a world shaped by my choices. Every blessing, smiting, and decision of mine created real consequences beyond the screen like I was rewriting the fabric of reality itself. 

The headlines, the breaking news bulletins, and the parallels between my actions and reality…couldn’t be dismissed as coincidence. They were the product of my own hand, whether I wanted it to be or not, and that realization petrified me. 

Despite my better judgment, I continued to play V.I.R.T.U.E., mesmerized by the power I wielded over that digital world. But then the game threw me a curveball, something that hit too close to home. 

My younger sister Alice, who I hadn’t seen or spoken to since I moved out of my parent’s house several years ago, appeared as an NPC in the town. 

Down a pixelated street over in a building by a nearby park, she rested in a bed. 

Her sprite looked fragile and weak, just like my mother said she had been after the operation to remove the tumor from her brain. 

I hovered the mouse over her character to view the game’s interface. The label that popped up offered no comfort. It simply read: *“Ailing”* and the health bar had dwindled so low that the red meter was barely visible, but still clinging to existence.

A notification appeared for another NPC, a man that I recognized as my grandpa Harold. I clicked on it and suddenly, I was brought to his kitchen. His character had his head down on the table, his sprites were riddled with gaunt and frailty. 

The hunger bar next to his character was flashing with alarm, indicating that he was starving. I looked at the screen and felt the weight of a thousand decisions press down on me simultaneously. 

I knew what the game was going to ask me before it presented the choice. 

A text box appeared that asked: *“Save Alice or Save Harold?”*.

The cursor glowed a dim shade of gold as it hovered between the two choices. One click would save the life of my sister, and the other would save my grandpa. 

My hand gripped the mouse as a dizzying thought spun in my head: Could I really play God, now knowing my decisions carried the weight of divine authority? 

I tried everything in my power to avoid the choice. I mashed random keys on my keyboard, clicked everywhere around outside the dialogue box, and even launched a kill switch in the hopes of crashing the game. 

My efforts were unsuccessful and resulted in the cursor to still hover between them. On the screen, I could see Alice’s and Harold’s pixels tremble, as if they knew I was hesitating with my decision.

I stared at their NPC counterparts for what felt like hours. Alice was young and had an entire life ahead of her while Grandpa Harold was eighty-two, half blind, and in pain more often than not. 

That kind of decision should have been easy and made in a heartbeat. Spare the young, right? 

But I thought about the moments of grandpa Harold teaching me to ride my bike, the nights we watched movies together, and the drives to go and get ice cream. 

It was so easy to talk to him, and to be myself in a household that didn’t allow me to have an identity outside of my devotion to God. He never judged, he only loved unconditionally.

I also thought about Alice and how rare the kindness she shared with others was. The nights at my parent’s house where we confided in each other about our traumas meant a lot to me. 

Hearing her talk about the kind of person she wanted to be before her sickness is something I will always cherish. Alice is the kind of good the world depends on. I regret letting family get in the way of us being close…but maybe there was still time to fix that, if I saved her.

I clicked between their names with the cursor, trying desperately to understand something I wasn’t supposed to. 

Somewhere in the back of my mind, I heard the sound of my dad’s voice reading scripture, *“Love one another, as I have loved you.”* 

There was no verse about choosing which one you love more though.

Under the ambient audio of the game, a faint pulse of energy made the mouse in my hand vibrate. My father’s disappointed sighs and my mother’s scolding whispers cut through the game’s audio. 

I could hear them telling me how every mistake would bring me one step closer to Hell as the air around me prickled with electricity. 

The game wasn’t measuring my morality; it was reflecting it in that moment.

Guilt, long embedded in the deepest parts of me, rose to the surface, and with shaky breathing, I closed my eyes and tried to center myself. 

The reprimanding voices, scathing words, and perceived judgments of my parents pressed down hard onto me like a trash compactor. 

Time slowed to a crawl as the crushing weight of responsibility grew more and more suffocating. The nerves in my fingers shook with indecision and fear, the cursor lingered in between the choices before I made my decision. 

In a brief, courageous moment, I clicked on the choice to save Alice’s life. 

I watched as my sister’s health bar illuminated and surged a bright, jovial green. Her pixelated counterpart suddenly radiated with health as she straightened up in bed and smiled brightly. 

I felt a rush of relief wash over me, my mind satisfied with the choice I had made. One person’s life had been spared at the cost of another. Even if it was only in this simulated world, I felt like a savior.

My thoughts were interrupted by the angry buzz of my phone on the table. I picked it up and saw a text message from my mom. Whatever good feelings I had subsided the moment I read the words above the usual flood of notifications. 

**“Hey honey, I hope you’re doing well. I know it’s been a while, but I just wanted to let you know that Alice’s surgery was a success, and the doctors have said she is stable and no longer in critical condition. I went to let Harold know but he never answered his phone. It’s been a while since we had heard from him so one of the other neighbors went to go check on him. They found him slumped over in his kitchen. It looks like he passed away from a heart attack.”**

My body went slack from shock. The room spun around me like I was on an amusement park attraction I didn’t consent to ride. I stumbled backward from my desk, hyperventilating out of fear as my chair scraped against the floor. 

The game flickered on the screen in front of me. I watched as the sprites of Harold’s character blinked out of existence, pixels drifting away like dandelion seeds in the wind. A moment later, and it was like he had never been there at all. 

V.I.R.T.U.E. was doing more than creating hypotheticals, it was responding to them. Something as innocuous as an in-game decision had become increasingly more sinister with each input. 

This went beyond simulation. Everything at my disposal had weight, power, but not the kind of power I wanted. It was something darker and more dangerous. 

All I could do was think about the fact that fate wasn’t making the decisions anymore, the game and I were. 

V.I.R.T.U.E. was slowly eating away at my soul, pulling me deeper into a philosophical hellscape I was mentally and physically not prepared for. 

What was I doing? Was I saving anyone, or was I just tricking myself into believing that I could control everything, even death itself?

Every choice I had made up to that point raced through my mind as I mulled over them repeatedly. I weighed them against the consequences that I couldn’t fully grasp in the present and future. 

The “good” outcomes and victories felt hollow or tainted by the game’s manipulation. The image of Harold’s pixels drifting away served as a haunting reminder of the power I possessed with one decisive click of my mouse. 

My chest tightened with guilt at the realization that nothing would let me escape the reality of having crossed a moral boundary. I pulled my shaking hand off the mouse and went to bed.

I didn’t go anywhere near my PC for the next couple of days until I decided to get rid of V.I.R.T.U.E. once and for all. But when I tried to uninstall it, that’s when V.I.R.T.U.E. and my understanding of it, changed completely.

Instead of uninstalling like any other game would have, it simply regenerated back onto my desktop with a new note file attached:

*"Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy".*

I launched the game, opened my **“Mercy”** save file, and briefly reminisced over the carefully curated comfort of the familiar town I watched over. 

At first glance, everything seemed exactly the way I had left it previously, except for the NPCs. Something was wrong with them. 

They appeared to be unnaturally rigid on the sidewalks and streets, scattered about as if they were desperate to move but trapped in place. Their heads were all tilted skyward in unison, staring at a presence that the game’s code refused to properly render. 

The lo-fi, ambient soundtrack of the game had been replaced with an oppressive, eerie melody that lingered in the air.

I moved and clicked the mouse frantically to no avail. V.I.R.T.U.E. wouldn’t respond to any key or input on my keyboard, the program appeared to be non-responsive. The screen remained fixated on the NPCs still staring skyward. The bizarre, distorted melody shifted into an unbearable cacophony before suddenly cutting off. 

The silence was deafening, and it was only broken by the faint, thudding of my heart against my ribcage. 

Cold sweat broke out on the back of my neck as my computer seized, flashing prisms and jagged shades of black and white, 

Then, the screen crackled to life, showing off the darkened streets and stationary townspeople. 

With horror, I watched a message gradually scroll across the screen in stark, white serif letters. 

It simply said:

*YOU ARE NOT SAFE FROM GOD HERE*

Then in rapid succession, came the message again and again. Each iteration more distorted and disturbing than the last: 

*Y0U AR3 N0† S∆FE FR0M G0D H3R3*

*Y0U AЯΣ N0† S∆FE FR0M G0D H3RΞ*

*Y0U AЯΞ N0† S∆FΞ FR0M G0D HΞЯΞ*

The characters began to sluggishly melt and stretch downward in a thick, viscous liquid. With each drifting fragment, trails of ghostly white fire followed briefly before vanishing. 

They struggled to maintain their form as the letters contorted and looped back on themselves. 

I tried to close the game, but my cursor wouldn’t move. In fact, my cursor icon had dissolved, replaced by strange symbols that I couldn’t decipher.

The words stretched across the ceiling, and coalesced into shapes writhing and bending at impossible angles, like a nightmare that didn’t obey the laws of physics.

No matter what I attempted, I couldn’t close the program. The demented mantra kept appearing on my screen. 

I ripped the cord from the nearby outlet to unplug the PC from the wall, and when I did, the speakers hissed until silence fell upon the room. 

The screen still glowed, indicating that there was still something powering it. 

My PC monitor emitted harsh rays of light, dissolving all the pixels on the screen to reveal something alive and breathing in the depths of the spatial vertigo. 

The walls of my room evaporated, leaving me to float in an endless black void…but I wasn’t alone. 

Something descended from above, the air around me curved to acknowledge the arrival of a new presence.

That’s when I saw Him. It was God, or at least, what I assumed it was. 

He was not the compassionate figure from the stained glass of my childhood, but a vast, shifting figure beyond comprehension. 

He existed in the negative space between forms, as darkness and light converged into unfathomable geometries. I could feel the gaze from His conglomeration of shimmering eyes in every direction. 

His mandibles glimmered with strands of light that bent in ways my mind couldn’t follow. God’s tentacled limbs of pure thought unfolded and expanded into the infinite space around Him. 

One instant, he was a supernova weeping blood; the next he was a cathedral of carcasses. His presence was seemingly everything and nothing all at once.

Then, God spoke not with a voice, but directly into my mind.

“Your virtue is sufficient.” 

It sounded like every prayer, curse, or plea humanity had ever uttered in any language collided into one blasphemous chord.

The tapestry of black that enveloped my surroundings dissolved as light poured through in massive, celestial pillars. 

Reality caved inward on itself like a vortex as the game’s code suddenly bled across the surroundings. 

Suddenly…I was everywhere. 

My limbs twisted in erratic patterns and my bones snapped like tree branches. I screamed in agony as trillions of simultaneous feelings jammed themselves into my mind, one that wasn’t built for such a thing. 

I heard everything in the world. I felt my eyes roll violently in my skull as tears streamed down my face. Frequencies crashed like tidal waves, each decibel sharp enough to split atoms, they folded over one another in my eardrums. 

I heard prayers uttered in hospital rooms, primal sobs at a funeral, swears, laughs, sighs, whispers, screams…every sound, all at once. 

I felt and knew everything God did in that moment. Love, rage, creation, annihilation, hope, despair, every concept ever conceived I held inside all at once. 

I begged incessantly for the pain to stop as I tried in vain to reassemble back into my own form, but I was gone. 

Every choice of mine reflected in unbearable clarity, and every emotion I had ever felt burned furiously in my veins like wildfire. 

I realized in that moment, the incomprehensible burden that I was being asked to carry. 

I didn’t just witness the universe, I became it. 

My chest compressed like invisible hands were crushing every one of my ribs. Each breath I took felt like a razor blade slicing through my lungs with surgical precision. 

The muscles in every part of my body convulsed against my will, and every tendon screamed as if I’d been running through an inferno and blizzard at the same time. 

Emotions weren’t just feelings anymore; they each had characteristics such as color, density, and flavor. Sorrow was navy blue and tender as pulp while love felt like being submerged in honey. 

My vision alternated between scorching white and asphyxiating black. The void around me exploded into a kaleidoscope of every color that spilled across my vision like molten glass, shifting and shaking like it were alive. 

Seconds stretched with elasticity, branching into countless predetermined lifetimes. A deafening ringing filled my head that sounded like every anvil in existence being hammered at once. 

I saw snippets of source code scroll across my vision. It was too fast to read, except for one fragment that engraved itself into my retinas:

*if mercy == true: collapse(self)*

“STOP!!! STOP THIS!!! PLEASE…I BEG OF YOU!!!” I pleaded until my throat shredded, my words dissolved into the infinite static of creation. 

My body thrashed around in the weightless emptiness, every nerve fragile and sparking with feeling. 

His impossible eyes peered upon me before he mercifully granted my request.

“You are not worthy to bear this.” His words echoed in my head, vibrating every molecule of my being as He receded into the darkness. 

The universe once again doubled over onto itself, and I collapsed onto my bedroom floor. 

The world around me had stopped spinning, I was solid again. I gasped on the floor of my bedroom, and felt myself with trembling hands, I had returned to normal aside from a bloody nose. 

My room was intact, but my body ached with a pain that went deeper than muscle. 

The computer screen glowed with life, V.I.R.T.U.E. hadn’t closed. 

The golden cursor blinked in the center of the screen, and the Virtue Score flashed ∞ for a few seconds before it reset to zero.

With sore eyes, I saw a new message typed out onto the screen:

*"You are unworthy to be called God even after doing all that is commanded. Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. Pass the burden."*

Afterwards, the monitor went black, the mechanical hum of the fans fell silent, and the LED lights dimmed then fully darkened. 

A cold shiver ran up my spine as I looked at the dead screen. My PC had completely crashed.

Fear was telling me that if I touched anything, the game would somehow bestow its omnipresent wrath onto me. 

I pushed that fear to the side and surveyed the damage, and concluded that there was nothing that could be done to save my PC. 

Every drive, backup, and piece of hardware was corrupted beyond repair, and no matter how many recovery tools I tried, nothing would bring it back to life. 

It was as if my machine had been judged and found unworthy by the same omniscient presence I had. 

I threw everything away to the scrap yard and waited until I had finally gathered up enough money to buy a new computer. When I brought that computer back to my room, I overhauled everything. 

I reinstalled the OS, swapped out the hard drives, and replaced every last part I could think of. I told myself I had escaped, that it was finally over. 

After a few days, it seemed as though the world had finally returned to the way it was before I ever found that game. It was like I had woken from a nightmare that had never really existed. 

I believed that until I opened a blank document to begin typing this and saw that I had a notification.

Dread manifested itself in my stomach as I read what had appeared in the center of my screen.

*_V.I.R.T.U.E. file successfully transferred_*

He had not truly let me go.

V.I.R.T.U.E. hadn’t vanished, it had followed me back.

I know I sound insane, but I needed to confess this somewhere. Maybe the reason He let me come back was so that I could pass it on, but I won’t. 

I cannot in good conscience allow this game to spread by any means, but what I can do is tell you this: some powers are beyond our comprehension and not meant for us. 

The mere idea of us playing God should be left well enough alone. Some doors are meant to remain closed for a reason. 

I understand now what Oppenheimer was trying to convey after he witnessed the power of his creation. Silence isn’t mercy, it’s aftermath. 

I thought I could control the world, as I had in my previous simulations, but I was wrong. 

I am scared of what will happen if someone else ends up with this game. If any of you know something I don’t, I need your help. Please…tell me what I need to do to destroy this permanently.

I’m not safe from God here.
