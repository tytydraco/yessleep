Hey, Reddit. I don’t usually post on here, but I’m really freaking out and need to get this off my chest. I’ve been dealing with something strange that may have gone too far, and I don’t know what to do. Maybe someone here can help me make sense of it.

For the better part of 25 years, I've been working as a geophysicist at a university up in Big Sky. My career was on a pretty good path until that path led to a wall or a cliff, I'm still not sure which. Bad choices, missed opportunities—you know how it goes. I ended up in a stuffy university basement sorting through old seismograph data from students and professors that left or died a long time ago. It was boring, but it kept me busy.

That’s when I noticed something weird. A small blip on one of the old seismograph sheets, just a tiny spike that didn’t match anything I’d seen before. At first, I thought it was a miscalculation, afterall it was old data, but it kept happening in all of the data exactly every 10 years. Before I knew it, I was at the bottom of the stack of sheets—the most current data being from 1974.

So, I started digging deeper. I know how it sounds—some washed-up earthquake nerd obsessing over ghosts. But this was different. The anomalies didn’t match any known geological activity. They didn’t make sense.

I spent sleepless nights going over the data, trying to find a pattern. It was like trying to solve a puzzle with missing pieces. I didn’t tell anyone—who would care? But I couldn’t let it go. It became my obsession.

Then I realized something amazing. These anomalies weren’t random. They were linked somehow, forming a pattern that didn’t fit with our understanding of geophysics. It’s hard to explain, but it felt like these blips were connected by something. And that’s when things got really weird.

It's at this point my obsession with these anomalies… it really started affecting me. I started seeing flickering shadows that didn’t belong, hearing strange noises in the middle of the night. I've been telling myself it's just stress, but it feels so visceral.

Then, after months of calculations, I had a breakthrough. These anomalies—they weren’t just random data spikes. They were ripples in time, and my data didn’t lie. Somehow, these blips were moments where time itself was bending or breaking.

This discovery has the potential to not only save my career, but launch it further than I could've ever dreamed. So, over the past couple weeks I've built a small, crude machine in my apartment with parts I've "borrowed" from the university that can replicate these ripples on a smaller scale. Think of an uglier, more crude VHS player, but with the tape tray at the top.

The first test was with a new, shiny penny. I put it in the machine and activated it. The coin disappeared and then reappeared a few seconds later, but it wasn’t the same. It was aged, corroded like it had lived a thousand years in those few seconds.

I sent more objects through, each time pushing further. And each time, they came back different—twisted, wrong. There was no way time was the only factor at play

This morning, I sent something else through—a small hand mirror. What I saw when it came back…the reflection twisted, showing me things that shouldn’t exist. Loved ones, dead and living, stared back at me. But the worst part was seeing myself in front of all of them—older, scarred, whispering something I couldn’t understand.

I've tried to turn off the machine, but the ripples are getting stronger, and spreading like a flickering mold. Time is literally breaking down around my living room, and I can feel it in the air, in my bones. I’m terrified of what’s coming next, but I can’t stop it.

I think I’ve done something terrible. I don’t know if I can fix it.

If anyone knows what to do, please, help me. I think I’ve opened a door that should’ve stayed closed.
