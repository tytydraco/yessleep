So burger king called me y'all right? And he was like 'ay bruh bump that interview ish u got the job can u come now or ur fired ' ..and he hungeded up  
Oh snap I thought ... this opportunity comes once in a lifetime (like that Eminem song) ... So I get to burger king right and da manager is like " here are ur rules to follow during work' his eyes were bleeding in a real scary way ...  
Rule 1... If Rick moranis from honey I shrunk the kids movie comes in and ask 'at bk have it my way right?" Turn off all the Lites and hide in office \* \*   
Rule 2 ....never go in office \* \*   
Rule 3..... a ghost will try to order a number 8 ... If u notice we stop at 7 but no one knows what happens if u take the order \*last worker who did died \* \*   
Rule 4 if a scary dude comes in and starts crawling on all 4s u need to start singing Christina agulara song "u r beautiful ' \* \*   
Rule 5 ... Never eat chicken nuggets while clocked in ... \* \*   
That last rule kinda got me heated I ain't gonna lie cuz I was alrdy planning on eating nuggets without paying .. so I was mad and had kinda forgot all that other rules buiz ....  
So Rick moranis comes in right ... U know dude who was da dad in 'hunny  i shrunkeded da kids" and I forgot all that rules talk right?   
and he ask if he can have it his way ... I say "uhh ya " ... He smiles rlly creepy smile .... Black eyes ...  
Oh snap I forgot the rule ... He said in a creepy voice "honey I scared the employee" I felt a chill down my spine ...why did I tell him he could have it his way?!?!!?   
I remember the first rule said Run to office.... so that's what I did. .. but while in there... I membered ... Rule 2 'dont go in office " Oh snap not again ...I started to hear people outside the office saying creepy stuff in a creepy voice.... after alot of creepy sounds .... the coast seemed clear so I go back out to the register...  one of my new co workerrs said sumtin like "ay u can't just disappear for long periods of time"  
I said "but I accidently told Rick he could have it his way!!" She gave me a look of disgust and walked away ... Maybe she was a ghost too I don't even know  
So I'm back at the register ...   
creepy old man comes in   
I get said he's gonna be creepy but nope he just wants food ...he orders a number 8 ..  
" ok we will get that right up for u sir " I look up at the menu .. there is no number 8 .. wait a second .... Wasn't that one of dem rulez dou???  
oh snap not again the restaurant goes dark and it's scary... this was the ghost I wasn't suppose to tell him ok ... cuz there was no number 8 but if u accept his order he kills u .... But luckily he musta forgotted to do dat...cuz after I went into the bathroom for like 2 Hours ... He was gone he must of forgotted to kill me like I forgotted dese rules  
After about 5 minutes ...   
Old man comes in ... Not creepy at first but instead of coming to place an order ... He starts crawling around.... I'm working at BK now ... I'm not gonna be a screw up no more .... I'ma get dis one right so I stand on the table the registers were on and uh ...I ain't gonna lie .... I panicked ... And I uh... sang a Mandy Moore song by accident...  
So while I'm up on the table singing 'im missing you like cannn daaay yea eh yea uh" He starts crawling faster and creepier ... and he keeps saying " wrong song .. wrong song ... Wrong SONG WRONG SONG WRONG SONG WRONG SONG " he stood up and started puking blood in a creepy way   
... I was fed up with super natical things happening to me and ruining this great opportunity.... So .... I went outside and smoked a blunt with my little homie roofio ... he was like ' ain't u working? " Oh ya I said ...after being in his car an hour I came back inside bk  
Other workers seemed mad I disappeared for an hour but ay with all dis ghost super natical stuff I needed to get my head right   
But still   
I couldnt afford to mess up again ...   
All of this ghost stuff had made me hungry so I stole like 27 and a half chicken nuggets and ate um in da bafrooom like a boss ..... I hear my coworkers asking about the nuggets they just pulled up out the fryer   
Den it hit me   
Uh oh.... The last rule ... I forgotted again bout dem rules ..it said don't eat dem while clocked in ...and I was .. clocked in .. but the rule said don't be dou  
So they fired me ....ain't that some bs??  
Opportunity of a lifetime but too scary for me anyway.. It had been about a weeek since I had workeded that day. ...  
But last night... I woke up to banging on the door and I immediately felt a cold shiver down my spine ... I went to look out the key hole and a creepy little girl was out there with black hair covering her face ...  
She said " are u the burger king worker who ate nuggets on the clock " ....I said no but somehow the ghost had knownded I was lying .... She said " I think you are!!!!" Her hair moved from her face and I saw her black eyes and creepy wide smile .... I wish I never tried to worked at BK but I just couldn't pass up being like a  local celebrity .... I day dreamed all day bout people telling other people "hey Roofio ur homie works at BK so he's got his shit together clearly ' but that dream has turneded into a nightmare .... Cuz of dem rules I forgotted to do ...  
SOO !!  
If u ever go to work at a burger king and they give u a list of rules ... Just PLEASE MAKE SURE U CLOCK OUT BEFORE U EAT NUGGGETS U STOLE ....  
AND I'M PRETTY SURE THATS THE ONLY RULE ... I dunno that was like a week ago  
Lemme know if y'all want an update cuz I don't think that little black eyed girl iss gonna let dem nuggets go on the real ....  
Sorry if dis scare y'all too much it's just a story tho but it's scary dou ain't it ?
