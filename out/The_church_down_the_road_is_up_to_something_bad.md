Long story short I moved away from the suburb I lived in near Pittsburgh after a really bitter divorce. Switched jobs and everything. 

Well one day about 7 months ago my job site brought me to this quaint little town in the neighboring state of West Virginia and I decided to sink roots. 

Work with the new job required a lot of travel for extended periods of time, sometimes as far as Texas, but when the job was done this was the place I wanted to be. 

If there was a setting that epitomized quiet country life this was it, and after the mess I went through with the ex it’s exactly what the doctor ordered. 

Only thing is now that work has slowed down I’m home a lot more. And what I’m beginning to notice that’s been right under my nose is starting to freak me out. 

This little run down church a mile or so down the road from me does these trips called “tent city missions” where they load up 4 white unmarked passenger vans and they roll out to this large homeless hangout along the highway about 30 miles from here. 

The first time I saw it I thought it was pretty cool. They pick some folks and bring them back to the church for service and dinner afterwards. I even went a couple times when I was off. But as I began to pay more attention something dawned on me that I cannot ignore. 

The church vans always leave and return with loads of people, but they never leave again after the service. 

That’s about 25-30 people in the last two months or so that have walked into that church but never came back out. Trust me I know. 

I’ve spent a few days and nights after the mission days watching from my upstairs bedroom window towards the church. After the services are over the congregation leaves and the church staff stays behind for an hour or so and then the church is empty. 

I ran into the pastor, or whatever he is, a couple of days ago at the corner mart in town and asked him how the people from the last mission liked it. It totally caught him off guard. Like he didn’t know what I was talking about at first. Then he drummed up some generic “Oh they loved it brother” crap and then he hit me with a question. 

“Why do you ask?”

It stammered me as much as I did him and this almost tangible tension descended onto the conversation. I gave him as generic and answer as he gave me and I grabbed my beer and peeled out. I tried to act natural but when I hopped in my truck I caught the creep staring at me. 

Now there’s people from the congregation appearing in random places around me at random times. Like I’m being followed. 

I caught 3 silhouettes in my yard last night hanging around my truck like they were going to vandalize it or something. They took off running when I turned the porch light on. 

Earlier today I called the police department in the city near the homeless camp and asked if there were any missing persons reported and they just laughed at me. 

Local PD here has members on the church staff. I can’t go to them. 

I have no idea what to do but have I this wrenching feeling in my gut that something is happening to those people and now I’m having tabs kept on me for asking about them. 

I’ve made up my mind. It’s 3 am. Should be quiet enough. I’m breaking into that church to see what I can find.
