I'm a second year psych major at a small college in Canada. I live in a tiny apartment off campus with my roommate Amira. We both work part-time, but rent's expensive and prices are going up, so we do what we have to to get by.

Lately, I've started suspecting that Amira may have a head for sex work.

It's not what you're thinking though.

I don't mean she has a head for sex work the way someone can have a head for business or math, be good at those things.

I mean she literally has a head for sex work. *A second head*.

Bear with me.

Amira has a boyfriend she's been seeing for about a year. His name's Benny and he's sleazy as hell, and I'm pretty sure Benny's the one in charge of the sex head.

How do I know about this second head?

I've seen it in Benny's car. One time I went out to get some stuff from the back seat when I noticed the trunk was open. When I went to close it I looked inside and saw one of those portable fridges *with blood coming out of it.* I opened the fridge and Amira's head was right there!

I couldn't even scream.

I went inside hyperventilating. Benny saw me, went out. By the time I'd calmed down enough to talk he was back, eyeing me and I wasn't even sure enough of what I saw to tell Amira. I would have sounded freakin' crazy.

Except I wasn't crazy, so the next time Benny came over I pretended to go out for the night, and spied on them instead. I saw him giving her something to drink, then she passed out, he got on top of her, then he did something on his phone and a few minutes later a friend showed up and together they carried Amira to Benny's car, *switched out her head* and drove off.

I don't have a car so I couldn't follow them.

I did call the police but they didn't seem to think there was anything bad going on. I couldn't just tell them about the head.

I passed out from worrying.

When Amira got home the next morning I asked her about her night, but it was pretty clear she didn't remember. "Guess I partied pretty hard, eh?" The next time Benny came around he had a new watch and jewellery.

I know it sounds insane but what I think happens is that Benny's got this second head, and he switches it for Amira's real head, then sends her out to fuck people and keeps the money. Then he puts the normal head back on, and Amira's Amira again.

But a few nights ago, Amira came home absolutely hysterical. When I asked her what was up, she said she'd been at Benny's and found a freezer in his basement.
