I'm well aware how ludicrous this story may sound, and I don't blame anyone for calling bullshit, but... this is kind of my final message to the outside world. So bare with me for a little bit.


I'm an outdoorsy kind of guy, I always have been. As a kid, I liked wandering around in nature, I liked the peace and quiet that comes with it, the sounds of nature calm my soul. I really just love being outside. Being an adult and living in the city makes that a bit harder, for many reasons, so I constantly yearn for the outdoors.


And a couple of weeks ago, I got fired. For unfair reasons of course. Just because I'm not always as happy as can be to customers and I tend to get lost in daydreaming, that doesn't mean you can just fire me. Right?


Anyway, after the upsetting news reached me, I was, well, upset. I still needed a job, like most people do, and finding employment is *so* hard, especially as of recently. So, to combat the feelings of sadness and annoyance, I decided I deserved a little break, at least before looking for another job. You can probably imagine what my idea of a break was.


Being cooped up inside a tiny, sweaty and overall horrible fast food building every day made me sick of being surrounded by walls. Even my own apartment was too oppressive for me.


So I organised a weekend camping trip with a few friends. My two closest friends, Francis and Haley, accepted and told me they'd be there. It doesn't matter that nobody else agreed, shut up. Those two did and that was good enough.


We decided we'd get to our starting point on Friday afternoon and set up camp for a night or two. Being recently unemployed, I got there early, and had to sit on my own for way too long. Random hikers walked back and forth along the trail glaring at me as they passed. I stared at my feet after a while. Those people, staring at me. Psh. What do they know.


When my friends finally did arrive, they arrived LATE!! I yelled at them for taking so long and leaving me to be judged by random strangers. They were like four or five minutes late after all. Haley was apparently a fake friend because she yelled insults back at me and just... left. Whatever, I decided. Francis looked tired already, so I ushered him to the trail before he could decide he hated me too.


The hike was about half an hour each way and I talked at Francis about my running streak of bad luck pretty much the whole way there, aside from a little shit talking people in my life who piss me off. He must've had a bad day at work that day because he was quiet and really irritable. I don't get why people are all about employment and jobs and stuff, so overrated to be honest.


Eventually, we made it to the camping spot. Suuper far off the main trail, past the huge brambles, and the giant chain link fence, was the best place for camping ever. The warnings and keep out signs only make it better. Francis was annoyingly quiet the whole time and kept looking behind him and being jumpy and stuff, which I didn't appreciate. The one thing he kept saying was that this place wasn't meant for camping and that it wasn't a good idea and blah blah blah. It was like he *wanted* to ruin my trip. I ignored him whenever he mentioned it.


After the walk, we made it to a small clearing surrounded by dense trees where we stopped to set up camp. Francis continued being a whiny bitch, talking about being followed or watched or whatever. I told him exactly what I thought, that he was being a whiny bitch, and he finally stopped bringing the mood down. I set up my tent and he followed shortly after, failing as he did, I couldn't help but sit back, watch and laugh.


When he finally put it together, I made a fire for us and we toasted marshmallows and I made smores as the sun started to set. All the while Francis silently looked around nervously, ignoring the fact that his marshmallow was completely charred. I didn't understand why he was so paranoid, I hadn't noticed anything out of the ordinary.


Francis went to bed pretty quickly, and told me I was crazy for staying out. I stayed out until the fire died down to prove a point, I enjoyed the alone time anyway. He was such a wimp sometimes. I did go to bed eventually, feeling frustrated at the general mood of the day. I fell asleep pretty quickly though.


The next day I woke up at the crack of dawn to Francis whispering at me through the tent. He was rambling at me for a while before I took any of his words in.

"-so can we please go now?" Was the first thing I registered.

"What? No! You fucking pussy. I thought you liked camping?" I said groggily. He stayed silent for a while.

"Not here, man. This place is fucked. We have to get out of here." Psh. What a chump, right?

"Man, go by yourself then, if you're such a wimp." I retorted.

"I said I don't know the way! Tom, did you listen to anything I said!?"

"...Nope" I admitted.
He sighed in defeat.

"Man, Haley was right." And with that, he crawled back into his tent. I didn't need him to have a good time here anyway.


It didn't take too long until I was up after that. I ate some breakfast and picked up my backpack and went to wander around the clearing. Taking in the scenery, the breeze gently blew through the trees around me, the warm air soothed the tension I had built up and the distant chirps and chitters of animals put my mind at ease, it really was perfect. I strolled around the clearing, picked some flowers, mushrooms and berries and stuff, some of which I'd never seen anywhere else before. There was literally nothing to be worried about anywhere. Francis was overreacting for sure.


As I was appreciating the nature though, I thought I saw a flash of movement, deep within the woods. Walking over to investigate, I noticed a *really* faint path winding through the dense trees, leading the opposite direction of where we came from. The movement must've come from there. I got that little jump in my stomach, where you feel like you're exploring or discovering something secret. I was immediately entranced and without hesitation, started on the path.


It was hard to follow. Several times I lost the vague direction and had to backtrack slightly to find it again. I figured it must've been a deer trail, all windy and confusing to follow, you know, how deers like to traverse.


I didn't stop to look around until I walked face first into a branch and fell over. I don't know how I did, it felt like it almost came at me and slapped me. But when I looked up, the trees were... different, diseased I guess. They looked gross and eerie. The leaves blocking almost all light from above made it unnaturally dark. It felt like they were all looking down at me. To be honest... I felt kinda scared, helpless, as pathetic as it sounds.


I snapped out of my trance, got up, and looked around for the trail. My heart rate spiked when I couldn't find it at first. And it kept rising when I looked harder and I still couldn't find it, frantically glancing around, I couldn't see anything but vile twisting trees surrounding me... were they getting closer? No, I was freaking myself out.

"Pull yourself together, man" I had to say to myself. I was turned around after the fall and decided to pick a direction and stick to it. I would get out eventually. Squeezing past trees I didn't have to before, I set off.


After at least... like an hour, probably more. Nothing was changing, everything I could see looked at least vaguely familiar. I was panicking, not to mention starving. These weird, gross trees went on forever. I must've picked the wrong direction. I was sweating a shit ton and running at this point, I was so tired.


At some point, I caught my foot on a root... or something, and fell flat on my face. Yet when I looked, I couldn't see anything I could've tripped over. Finally admitting defeat, I decided to try and yell for Francis. The first time, there was no response. A little louder, nothing. Louder still, nothing... still. The woods felt suffocating and I felt like a caged animal, even if I *was* technically outside still.

Now I really was scared.


As if on cue, a gentle voice sounded from behind me. I yelped in surprise and whipped my head around, and froze. A tall, beautiful woman, who seemed to light the surroundings up slightly, stood above me. Taller than me, her skin was incredibly pale, she had long, wavy and shiny black hair that seemed to shimmer despite the dark. She gazed at me with piercing icy blue eyes and wore only a spotless, bright white dress that, along with her hair, flowed like they were underwater. 


I looked on in awe for a moment before responding.

"S-sorry, what did you say?" I tentatively asked her. She had a very dignified presence. It commanded respect, in a way.

"I said, are you lost?" Her voice was surprisingly deep and smooth as butter, it made me feel like I was melting.

"I uhm... yes, I am, as it happens." I don't know why I became so nervous after she spoke, I felt honoured to be in her presence.

"What's your name, sweetheart?" She asked me, in an almost motherly tone, sending a shiver down my spine.

"Uh... Tom... I'm Tom. And yourself?"

"Follow me, Tom." she said as she turned to leave. I didn't question that she ignored me, I **had** to follow her. To get out of here yes, but also because I was already head over heels for her.


I jumped to my feet and ran behind her, suddenly reinvigorated, she looked as if she was gliding through the woods, like she knew this unending landscape like the back of her hand. She elegantly yet playfully danced her way around the trees as she led me away from that nightmare, I kept my eyes fixed on her, noticing that she was always the same distance away, no matter how fast I ran. I followed her for some time, I don't know how long, I was almost entranced by her, but by the time I caught up with her, my legs felt like jelly.


"Here we are." she basically whispered to me. It was dark, but the full moon hung high in the sky, casting a ghostly blueish glow all around the clearing.

"Wow, thank you... h-how did you do that?" I was slightly in disbelief. She only giggled at my question, but who was I to argue.


She delicately caressed my cheek and slid her finger down to my chin. Her touch was soft, softer than any material I'd felt, yet it had a fiery heat that felt like it burnt my skin.

"You must have realised by now," She whispered directly in my ear this time.

"This place is not for you, you mustn't stay." Her breath was somehow cold on my neck. She let go of me as another shiver went down my spine, this time I felt slightly threatened by her.


"Yeah, uhm... sorry... about that." I said without looking at her, thinking back to the signs earlier. There was no response. I looked up to speak to her.

"I can-" But she was gone by that point, though, it felt like she was still here, her presence lingered in the air somehow.

"Damn it, nice one Tom." I said aloud. It was late by that point and I was utterly exhausted. I walked past Francis' tent, admiring the serenity of the night, and into mine, where I passed right out once I laid down.


I woke up the next morning, feeling... wrong. I guess sleeping fully clothed doesn't help. But it was more than that, a certain emptiness lingered deep inside me. I tried to brush it off and got up. I was absolutely ***starving,*** so I ate the rest of the food in my bag that was meant for at least another couple days. I was still kinda hungry though, so I left my tent and went to Francis.


"Francis?" No response. "Francis." Still nothing "Francis!" STILL nothing.

"Welp, this is on you." I said as I quickly unzipped the tent. He wasn't there though, which was weird, but, whatever. I rummaged through his stuff and ate anything edible, not really able to control myself.


The empty feeling lingered inside me, even after all that food. I decided to look for the lady again, feeling strangely compelled to. After all, I didn't have much else to do and she was pretty awesome, even just to listen to. I still didn't know her name, so I yelled aimlessly into the trees from the day before. Mainly shouting 'lady' over and over. Surprisingly, it did work.


"What are you still doing here?" Her voice echoed from behind me. It was harsh and cold this time. I spun around but... she wasn't there. I turned back around and jumped at the sight of her. She was somehow right in front of me.


"Hey! I uh-" The words died in my throat and my mouth went dry as I looked up at her. She wasn't smiling like the day before. Her gaze cut through me as she looked down onto me. It may as well have been the end of the world, the way I felt as she stared at me.

"This place is not yours." She reminded me.

"I'm-" I swallowed hard. "S- uh... sorry." She didn't say anything, she only stared. I was sweating. I couldn't move. I couldn't speak. The empty feeling swelled inside me. I felt like I was going to vomit.


Just as I thought she might attack me, the atmosphere shifted slightly. It felt an invisible grip around my neck loosen a little.

"I uh... enjoy nature... y-you know? I wish I could uhm... stay here for, like... forever" I finally managed to stammer.

"I see." She spoke softly again. And with that, she slid backwards into the dark of the twisted woods at ridiculous speed and disappeared.


I was left stunned. The empty feeling only grew worse, now accompanied by a sudden sharp pain appearing in my stomach. I leaned over and dropped to me knees. Bile, or what I thought was bile, climbed up my throat. I closed my eyes and dry heaved. I did so several more times before I puked. The pain in my stomach ever present. When the pain receded slightly and I opened my eyes, expecting to see all the food I had eaten, I was shocked and scared to see a thick, vile black sludge. This was definitely wrong. 100%.


Maybe Francis was right. I was starting to see where he was coming from... where was he actually?

"Francis!?" I yelled out. Nothing. Oh god.

"FRANCIS!!" I screamed. I was freaking out, panting and sweating, kneeling over my black vomit. I was beginning to lose hope, when I finally heard the bastard. Far away, just about audible.

"I'm pissing! Just wait!" Oh thank god. I didn't feel like standing up, so I waited until he came over. His faint footsteps drawing ever nearer.

"Oh god, Jesus Christ." He said once he laid eyes on me and the state I was in.


As bad as his reaction was to hear, I was relieved to not be alone.

"Hey man... Yeah-" I spoke, yet, when I looked up at him, something... happened. I still don't quite know what. It was a blur. Everything stopped for a moment, and I felt like I saw a flash of red. Before I knew what had happened. I was where Francis was standing a moment ago, lying on my back. I looked around.

Francis was gone.


The sun had begun to set and I was left confused as to what happened and where the time went. Francis had apparently left, and the whole ordeal left a bad taste in my mouth, literally. A dry, tacky feeling and a terrible taste lingered in my mouth. Most likely because I hadn't eaten all day, yet, weirdly, I didn't feel hungry at all. I felt a little sick, in a kind of... good way? If that makes sense. The empty feeling lingered still, but was dialed down to where I could ignore it. I was confused and frazzled that I decided not to overthink it. My eyelids felt heavy, and I decided to succumb to the feeling, I closed my eyes where I lay and fell asleep.


I had a terrible nightmare that night, though. It was dark, a void, I had no body, but I felt my body. In my mind I knew I was somewhere. Disembodied voices whispered all around me, they spoke to me all at once, telling me things I couldn't quite decipher. I felt the emptiness deep inside my very being twist and writhe as if it were living. It yearned for... for what, I didn't know, but it hungered for something.


The cacophony of whispers grew in volume as I felt the swirling in my body. Millions of tiny legs clawed their way up my oesophagus, ever so slowly. The whispers turned to pleading, and the pleading turned to begging. The millions of razor sharp legs reached higher and higher, shredding my throat and mouth as they did. The begging became frantic. The tiny little legs reached my mouth and spilled out onto my chin. I couldn't breathe as they marched their way out, clogging my insides.


The voices began desperately shouting, I still couldn't decipher the meaning behind their words. They screamed at me, screamed in rage, in ecstasy, in panic. The legs kept coming, there was a seemingly endless amount. The voices grew louder still, they seemed sing in a demented choir, full of secrets I wasn't allowed to hear.


Everything became more and more... intense. The voices screamed louder, the legs crawled faster. My insides burned in pain, uncountable pinpricks littering every surface. I thought I might go deaf from how deranged and absurd the voices had become. Just when it seemed it couldn't get any worse, I was saved from the prison in my head and brought back to reality. I'm not sure if dreams hold meaning at all, but that one, it was so vivid, so debilitating.


I gasped as I jolted awake, trying to brush it off as a typical nightmare. I was **oh so** hungry when I finally did. I was... ***empty***, you could say. I rose slowly, a sharp twang of pain from my stomach reminding me of my dream. I had to eat something. It was a long day of pain and hunger, searching the almost endless woodland for any form of sustenance. To be honest, I didn't even know it was this big, or how it was even possible.


I foraged at first, eating anything I could get my hands on, berries, fungi, even bugs, but it didn't help ease the pain. Eventually though, I stumbled upon a serene lake, its surface reflecting the sun right into my eyes. Hunger gnawed at my insides, a relentless beast that demanded to be satiated. I cast my gaze towards the tranquil waters, and saw the shapes of fish swimming just below the surface. I knew I had to catch one.


I had no tools to use, and thought hard about what to do. When I remembered a trick my father taught me long ago, I gently placed my hand underwater, wiggling my thumb slowly. I waited, and waited, moving ever so slightly as a few fish made their way over, and, confident as I was, I was still surprised when it worked, as far fetched as it sounds. A fish absent mindedly bit my thumb and I quickly grabbed it, it's face seemed comically shocked at the trap.


But as I pulled the wriggling fish from the water, admiring it's form, a primal urge took hold of me, the hunger was too intense. I tried to fight it, to resist the savage compulsion, but it was as if my very essence had become entwined with the instincts of the forest. It smelled heavenly, even raw, ***even live.*** I brought the fish closer to my face, its scales shimmering with an ethereal beauty. With a foggy mind and a sudden, violent motion, I bit down on its head, the crunch of bones and flesh filling the air as its head came clean off.


I was stunned at myself for a moment, until I chewed, and realised how delicious it was. It was probably the best thing I'd tasted, ever. I frantically shoved the rest of it in my mouth, the bones snapping and the shards scraping down my throat. I should have been horrified, repulsed by my own actions, but instead, an unsettling satisfaction washed over me. I spent the rest of the day devouring all of the fish I could find and only moved on to search for more food.


Hours passed as I searched for food, then days, I lost track of time. Days turned into weeks as I wandered deeper into the woods, the landscape twisting and repeating in increasingly strange ways. The gnawing hunger persisting, but no matter how much I ate from the forest, it never seemed to satisfy me. It was as if the very essence of this place was draining me, consuming my humanity.


As the time passed, I felt myself changing, transforming into something unrecognizable. My skin slowly took on a disturbing grayish hue, and my limbs twisted and elongated into gnarled branches. My once-human thoughts have become entangled with the whispers of the forest, and I started to see the world through the eyes of the creatures that dwelled here.


One evening, as the moon cast an eerie glow over the landscape, I came across a reflection in a dark puddle of water. What I saw, it was no longer the image of a man, but that of a monster, a creature born of the woods themselves. My eyes glowed with an unnatural light, and my body was covered in a mess of lichen and moss. But I didn't care, I couldn't, I still needed to eat.


With each passing day, my connection to humanity fades further. The memories of my former life slip away like mist, and I am embracing my new existence. I move with the rhythms of the forest, frolic under the moonlight, my once much more human thoughts melding with the ancient knowledge of the forest. The trees whisper secrets to me, and I whisper back, their voices a chorus of rustling leaves and murmuring branches.


I don't want to leave, I never did, but I can't find the trail out anyway. The outside world is becoming a distant memory, and I find solace in the quiet, ancient wisdom of the woods. I've carried the things I used to see as important with me, but the words on my phone are making less and less sense, so I think I'll leave it here.


After all, the pain in my stomach, it's too much to ignore now...
