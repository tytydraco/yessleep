Gonna keep this short and sweet, well more like "short and disturbing asl". Anyways, a few years ago I was searching through sites, trying to find a good site I could buy cheap pirated games/movies. I cant exactly remember the sites name, but it was something like "Costly Goods" or something like that. And I remember trying to get a cheap copy of COD BO2, it was around $2.30, so nothing too expeinsive. I decided I'd purchase it, even knowing someting was off about this site, I did what I'd normally do, put in my banking info, email, etc... After doing so, I never received the copy, I definently thought I was scammed so I decided to check my email  for a recipt or something. Though when i went to go check the email, I no longer had access to the email that I used (Mainly my email I used for gaming and accounts) I was super confused at what had happened and decided to investigate further. That is until I realized purchases on my bank account have been made on Microsoft, Samsung, and some foreign sites. I decided to contact my bank about the fraud, and they immediately deactivated my account for the time being. I know I was able to get access to where the location was, so I checked it, and it was in Iraq... 

I thought only my email and banking account had been compromised and that's it. I then realized after checking my email again that ALL my emails have been compromised, including my personal email, for work, university, etc... I instantly panicked because my personal email had access to ALL my important information such as First and last name, home address, Ip, etc... I decided to just drop it and deal with it later, so I decided to go out to my favorite diner at the time, which was bobs burger's. After about an hour and a half of being out I returned to my condo, I didn't know at the time but on my personal email had reached out to all my teachers, boss, friends, family, and more that I had been killed in a car accident... (not wanting to explain the whole story because I don't have the time to type it out) But long story short I was completely unaware at the fact that everyone that they had emailed believes I am dead...  Luckily, I didn't really email my parents and brother, so they never found out about this until I told them. After some time, I get a knock at my door... Its a police officer doing a welfare check, I answer in confusion, and I soon learn that my identity  was stolen. It took a lot of explaining to my collogues, teachers, boss, and relatives about what happened. But one thing I will never understand is how they got access to everything.?   
  
PS: I'm sorry the story is poorly explained I haven't had much time on my hand, but if anyone knows how they could have gotten access to my emails and stuff it'd be greatly appreciated!!  
Note:(I was also able to get access back into my bank account and refunded the purchases, as well as my personal email, but not my gaming email)
