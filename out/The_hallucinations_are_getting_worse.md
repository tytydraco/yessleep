“The hallucinations have been getting better, I think. They still show up from time to time and they still feel just as real…” The faint scratching of graphite on paper filled the dead air, Dr. Mendoza not looking up as he scribbled away. The large “HealthyMinds Psychiatry” logo plastered across the top being the only discernible words from my seat across the stuffy office room. My eyes wandered as they always seemed to do, finding anything that could briefly focus my brain away from its usual chaos. A filing cabinet, a mug filled with more pens than one would ever use, a medical degree proudly hung above a depressing sofa most likely picked up cheap from a secondhand retailer. 

“Well, Mr. Stevens…” His voice snapped me back to attention as he continued writing. “Progress is a good sign. This is just the initial dosage to get you acclimated, you won’t start seeing solid results for some time. How have the side effects been?”
 
“Fine. I think. I guess I don’t really notice them.” I was lying, of course. The brain fog and dizziness that were promised certainly delivered, but they were more than manageable if it meant relief. Any kind of relief.
 
“Well, if that’s the case then I don’t see any issue with upping your dosage. Are you still using the same pharmacy in your file?” He was clearly just as ready to go home as I was. The usual wrapping up followed as we both put on our best show of manners in front of hidden exhausted resignation, seemingly unable to get away from that awful sofa fast enough. 



Ascending the many flights of stairs up to the 6th floor, the distant harmony of police sirens accompanied my echoing steps, the white paper pharmacy bag gripped tightly as if it might be stolen, whisked away by someone hoping to get high off antipsychotics. Faint noises and shadows followed me as they often do, brushing across my peripheral trying to get my attention. Had this been months earlier I would have obliged them much to my faltering sanity, but I had been growing accustomed to them with each passing day. The little ones, the ones just at the edge of my vision that so feebly feign tangibility have long since lost their bite. It’s the big ones, the ones that blur the lines of reality, the ones sent by Satan himself to torment me that force me out of the safety of my apartment to that dreary shrink office. A safety that I found myself rushing to, the dim flickering lighting of the long hallway provided adequate habitat for tall figures, figures with human bodies stretched from the floor to the ceiling, wrapping up and around the corner so they could watch me from above.

They watched as I fumbled with my keys, fanning through them to find the one to salvation. I can feel them staring, I know they’re smiling because they know I’m afraid. With the lock flicking and the door opening, I could feel them brushing up against the back of my neck as I slammed it shut behind me, the click of the deadbolt sending a rush of relief. It never matters if I know they’re not real, my brain does a great job at making them real enough. 

The apartment is small, but small is good. Small means efficient, it means closeness. Small means less space for dark corners to house tall figures. 
Rapidly throwing off my winter coat, it settled in its usual spot slumped over the faded green loveseat. One of the few relics of the past that didn't bother me with its presence, a moving gift from my parents to celebrate finally ridding myself from their daily lives. It was actually quite comfortable, having earned the right to stay but more truthfully it served the purpose of being some form of contrast; The apartment was a drab gray furnished with brown wooden tables and chairs, admittedly picked up cheap at…well, a secondhand retailer. The seat was the only thing of any real color, a lone faded green in a sea of brown and gray. 

The apartment is safe, or at least I made it safe; An eclectic mix of various light sources found permanent fixtures in every corner of the living space. Each with their own manual switches keeping them illuminated until the valiant bulb inevitably needed replacing, having dutifully kept the forces of dark at bay and thus preventing those tall figures taking refuge in my sanctuary. Years ago I would have chuckled at the idea of me, a six foot tall 200 pound man, setting up night lights. Indeed, I did chuckle at the thought of doing it until my first time experiencing one.  

Two months and six days ago. Four months and 18 days after my initial diagnosis. My usual routine, essentially on autopilot by that point. Home from work, deadbolt click, sweatshirt tossed haphazardly over the faded green loveseat. The only light illuminating the apartment came from the small desk lamp flanking me as I walked into the living area, the windows covered by those gray shades even had it not been late evening. My autopilot quickly ceased soon after noticing something. Something tall. Whatever it was, it seemed perfectly shaped to fit the slithering darkness covering the walls opposite me. Twisting and curving so disgustingly, it blended in almost perfectly with the blackness, but I knew it was there. It knew that I knew. I just stood, frozen with a primordial fear that few ever experience, the kind of fear when you know you're about to die. Not a muscle on my body dared attempt to flee as I tried to study what was in front of me, trying desperately to make out its shape. Was that its head? Or was it  the part stretched up across the ceiling? Those are hands. Are those hands? Was it smiling at me? 

After some amount of time that I've yet to remember, I think hours but maybe seconds, I felt it move. Even minutely, it sent my body into panic as I lurched my entire mass in the opposite direction, towards my shut bedroom door. I turned the knob and slammed it shut behind me faster than I thought dexterously possible as I felt it touch the back of my neck, a feeling I would grow sickeningly familiar with. I didn't sleep a single second, my brain working overtime to rationalize that it was all just a hallucination, just like the doctors said I would have. The only thing making it impossible was its eyes. They glowed a deep gray with a real tangibility to them, they existed, even as I stared right back into them. When morning broke through the cracks of the shades, it was not much longer that  a terrified phone call had me back at HealthyMinds Psychiatry weeks earlier than anticipated. The thought of setting up night lights no longer had me chuckling. 

The severity of any given episode varies considerably and often seems to correlate with my stress levels, but this is by no means a rigorous connection. Surprise visits from an unwanted presence is always a potential, but I like to think that I’ve been getting better at managing them. Or more accurately I need to think that I am. I can't entertain the possibility of a life where everyday is like this, everyday forcing my body to function normally as I perform my daily routine to an audience. An audience that hates me, that feeds off knowing that I’m afraid and barely keeping myself from total collapse. My movements change, my body language shifting ever so imperceptibly to notice but they know what to look for. As I tell myself to relax knowing full well the razor wire I stand on, that voice in the back of my head mocks me for my abysmal performance. “Do you really think you’re fooling anyone? You’re going to be okay, is that right? You know you won't make it. If you were okay, you wouldn't need to tell yourself, you know you're falling.”

I have been getting better, at least a little, because of one particular emotion that I can turn to when it gets bad- Anger. Anger distracts me from the fear and I don't even need to feign a performance. The anger of my lost sanity, my lost family, my lost friends, my lost safety. When the fear gets too much to handle, my brain, almost automatically at this point, focuses the anger towards my guest. I stare and rush forward with the primal anger of an animal defending its young, a primal anger that shuts down the part of your brain that tells you to run. I lash, I swing, I scream with a guttural ferocity that would certainly put me in an inpatient facility; A large man, growling and tearing at the empty air as if to kill a ghost.

I screamed. I exploded up from my sleeping position, practically throwing my hand at the switch that pulled me from hell back to safety. Sheets and tshirt saturated with sweat, I held myself gasping for air as I awaited my heart rate to relax itself. The glowing red 3:28 across the room provided no additional comfort knowing work was a mere 4 hours away. I knew to expect frequent and worsening nightmares, a bonus symptom I learned first hand when starting the new medication months ago, and so it was only natural it would happen again on a higher dosage. My head drooped, letting my hands attempt to massage away the thumping headache when my attention was cut short- A noise. More accurately, noises. 

Hallucinations of course very often include additional senses, and sound was never a favorite of mine. With sight, it's at least possible to quickly determine its existence, or lack thereof. Not sound. I couldn't simply tell myself that the faint sound of a door shutting softly through the thin walls was my imagination, nor the faint creaking of wood slowly but unmistakably getting closer. Closer still until it found itself coincidentally outside my bedroom door, just a few feet from where I stood, the cold and firm touch of metal being my only comfort as I held the bat steady at my side. 

I don't do well with suspense, not anymore at least. I found that my increasingly fatigued sanity has grown rather tired of waiting, tired of hiding and hoping it would just leave me alone, replaced instead by the somewhat self destructive allure of anger and hatred. If it's going to kill me, why not get it over with sooner, which is precisely why I ripped the door open and swung, a noise somewhere between a roar and a shout escaping my mouth as I felt contact. A solid, wet thud, followed by a collapse. Laying there in front of me, a mass of darkness conveniently shaped to fit the slithering shadows of the unlit hallway. Letting the bat fall to my side, a flick of a light switch would finish off the kill as yellow fire cleansed away the evidence, revealing a barren wood floor. Content with a successful hunt, I carried myself to the fridge; I wasn't going to be falling back to sleep.

The week passed with me barely perceiving it, days often blended together with the monotonous droning of a job so soul crushing I almost wished for one of my visitors to inject some emotion into the workday. They never did; it would seem that the rows of dull gray cubicles were too much even for demons of torment. 

Only briefly did I acknowledge the start of the weekend before collapsing in bed the minute I got home. Fridays were always the worst, flooded with everything that needed to be done before the weekend. 

Like clockwork, I again found myself leaping awake, the familiar dampness saturating my shirt and bedsheets. Weekends were a blessing, being awoken at four in the morning mattered little when I could collapse back in bed without worry of an alarm greeting me. My body lurched out of bed on autopilot as I looked for a pair of dry clothes to replace sweat soaked ones that now found themselves tossed across the floor. The cold breeze of air flow sent a shiver down my exposed body. Was it always this cold? I don't remember turning the AC on higher…although to be fair I don't remember much before I collapsed in bed. 

I opened the door and stumbled my way through the dark to find something heavier to wear, seeking out the usual spot I always tossed them. Hands reaching out, I felt my sweatshirt and pulled it from its crumpled spot on the purple recliner. Turning back, a very subtle detail managed to grab the attention of my barely conscious mind- A mass, standing just a few meters away. It's looking at me, I know it is. Barely perceptible in the almost pitch darkness, it stood there. Feeding off of my fear, I know it. With the exhaustion of a sleepless week weighing at my emotional control, I did what I know- I leaped forward in absolute rage, a rage that desperately attempted to mask the shuddering terror beneath. I lashed, I clawed, I growled. I felt that familiar wet thud followed by a sickening slumping onto the cold tile floor. As my brain caught up, I looked down to see what I had even grabbed as a weapon during the rush of emotion- A golf club, one that had been leaning on the marble table that I must have reached for automatically. I caught my breath as I closed my eyes, inhaling deeply in an attempt to slow my racing heart. Something interrupted that, however. 

A deafening scream let out behind me, which I found strange. My hallucinations usually subside after I confront them.
