Where to begin? Damn...

This whole mess started with my friend, P.

We’ve known each other for years, almost two decades now.

Since first grade we’ve been pretty much inseparable, having the same hobbies, the same taste in music and even the same dreams and aspirations. He followed me to college, where we share a room, just so we can keep each other company...

But that’s not relevant right now. Sorry, I’m pretty much rambling already...

The point is: I need help.

P and I have been, well, ‘experimenting’ those past few weeks.

He found someone who sold us some pills a few months back.

It was fucking great, amazing even.

We went to a party and it was almost a blur, but oh so exhilarating...

Fuck alcohol, we were dancing and flirting and, well, you know, other stuff, with hardly a hangover the morning after.

That was my first experience with something other than weed or booze, and I was immediately hooked.

P felt the same as well and asked his new connection what else he had for us.

Those next few weeks, we tried all kinds of different stuff.

Ketamine (I wouldn’t recommend that), cocaine, LSD, and once, almost crack. We only stopped ourselves from buying that shit because P’s dealer told us to maybe think about it carefully. He was probably afraid we’d stop spending so much money on the other stuff if we got hooked on that...

Again, beside the point, sorry... Whatever...

A week ago, P came to our room with a small bag, which he cradled like some kind of treasure. I was immediately interested and pestered him, but he told me to wait till Friday so we could have a 100% real, spiritual experience without it messing up our schedules.

It wasn’t like I couldn’t guess what he had gotten from his dealer, but I still felt antsy the whole day. After classes, we met back in our dorm room again, and I think for the first time ever, I saw P acting more nervous than I.

What he revealed then was a small bag with two shrooms inside. I wasn’t really surprised, but I acted as if I were, just to lighten up the mood a bit.

He told me that his dealer had gotten them from some guy out in the boonies and that we should be extra careful because they were the fucking bomb.

I asked P if he was sure we should take them, and after a bit of discussion, we decided to just say “Fuck it!” and give it a try. It wasn’t like we would OD, we told ourselves.

Well... if I have to be honest, I’m not sure if we did.

One can’t die from the stuff, at least as far as I know, but maybe we actually did, and I am in hell right now...

He ate his first, then gave me mine, so I could follow his lead.

The taste was fucking disgusting, by the way... but I might not be the best judge in that regard, since I hate mushrooms anyway.

We spent the next three hours lounging around our room, watching videos, and even playing games, but nothing happened.

Not a single thing.

Still feeling completely normal, besides a slight stomachache I got, but that could have just been from my body revolting against me for eating a mushroom, we both started getting moody. After another hour, we were pretty sure the dealer must have scammed us that time, so we got up to check out the liquor store so we could at least have a drink and spend the rest of the night in our room, watching bad movies drunk off our asses.

But the moment we left the dorm, my heart started racing.

There was something in the air, I think. An odor I hadn’t noticed before.

Musty, earthy... like that. I asked P if he could smell it as well, and yeah, he did.

We were still on the campus, so something like that wasn’t anything strange, but even as we left the area, the whole atmosphere seemed different.

Like... the lighting was wrong, I think. The area, from the dark bricks of the buildings to the glare of the signs, looked just off. Not by much. I could still easily read everything and understand everything, but the whole area was... I don’t know how to describe it... maybe as: it was ‘tinted’ in a different shade.

We walked on, and that’s where we spotted the first one: a woman, standing on a street corner, looking down at her phone.

A normal sight, right? Yeah, no. Something was wrong with her.

I saw it first, but P instantly grabbed hold of my arm as he noticed her as well.

Her eyes were... different. Slitted pupils were staring down at the screen, while the skin on her cheeks shimmered in scales.

She looked up at us, and I might have yelped if P hadn’t pulled me away immediately.

Worse yet, I could see her crossing the road in our direction, so we started to run and finally managed to lose her in one of the alleys...

P was out of breath and was talking about her scaly skin before I could even mutter a single word.

He had seen it as well. The exact same thing.

We talked it through once we were sure this strange snake-woman wasn’t following us anymore and decided that the liquor store was out of the question now.

The only problem was, we couldn’t backtrack for fear of running into the thing again, so we walked down a different road and came upon one of the seedier bars in the area.

Outside were two bouncers, and one of them looked off.

His skin wasn’t scaly, but covered in transparent fur.

It was almost like a picture being superimposed over another one.

He opened his mouth as he yawned, and I could see two fangs glimmering in the evening sun.

The bouncer stopped immediately, the moment we spotted him, and his eye fell upon me. I can still feel chills when I think back on it. There was a twitch going through him as he turned his head and stared directly at us.

His eyes were strange, dark pupils in this almost glowing amber color, and I could hear P drawing in a sharp breath.

We turned and headed back into the alley, but heard him chasing after us not even ten seconds later.

I don’t know how we managed to get away again; all I remember is the fear I felt that pushed me on long after I would have collapsed under normal circumstances.

It took us an hour before we finally got back to the dorms, and we locked ourselves inside our room.

I’ve spent four days in here already. Looking out the window and seeing people that aren’t people.

P went out yesterday to talk to his dealer, but he hasn’t returned. I’m fearing the worst.

Something must have happened to him, but I don’t know what to do! I need help myself!

Someone has dropped P’s jacket outside the door yesterday.

It took me an hour before I dared open the entrance, but now I wish I hadn’t.

It’s shredded and bloody, and I think I know what message they want to send me.

They know I can see them.

They are waiting for me to come out.

Every morning when I wake up, I stand by the window, hoping that the world has returned to normal, but it hasn’t.

This is real, I know.

And it won’t change back, I fear.

It’s been four days already, and I can feel it in my bones.

They know.

They are waiting out there.

I saw an old man with eyes and fangs like a spider walking past the dorms just ten minutes ago.

He was looking for something.

For me.

I don’t know what to do.

If I call the cops... will all of them be normal people?

If not, I fear I might die...

I looked down at a crowd from my window yesterday, and amidst the normal students, a handful of those things were hiding.

They were turning their heads, one by one, staring up at me...

Their eyes were singling me out.

Those things are everywhere.

Hidden among us.

We aren’t meant to see them...

They do not like it at all.

What should I do?
