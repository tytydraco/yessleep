Many years ago, a group of paranormal researchers and their local guide searched for a fellow scientist who along with his students disappeared with no trace. They came to Craven Moss Manor, a strange blight of a structure perched on the edge of an English cliff like a vulture looking for a new corpse to feed on. I was one of the fools who thought they knew what was really happening at that accursed place. 

A dense fog had rolled in from the ocean, suffocating the cliffside where Craven Moss Manor stood. The unholy mist clung to the ground, refusing to lift, even as the sun reached its highest point. The Locals, long wary of the manor’s sinister reputation, began to witness strange phenomena. Lights flickered in the fog, unnatural shadows moved where none should exist, and the most unsettling of all—the rhythmic thumping, like the beating of a colossal, invisible heart, echoed through the night air.

Whispers of these occurrences eventually reached the university, where I and my other compatriots taught paranormal and supernatural quasi-science popular in those days. Alarmed by our friend's prolonged absence, the college board worried about their investment and sent a small search party to the manor, hoping to uncover the fate of the missing professor and his companions. The group, consisting of three fellow professors and a local guide, traveled to that malevolent house. I, the senior researcher at the time, set out with my friends toward the manor with a growing sense of unease.

As we ascended the cliffside road, the fog seemed to thicken with each step, muting all sounds except the crunch of gravel beneath our boots and the ever-growing thump… thump… thump.

The guide, a grizzled man hardened by years of living near the cliffside village, wiped a sheen of sweat from his weathered brow. His hand trembled, though he tried to hide it. "We should turn back," he muttered, his voice barely a whisper, as though the surrounding air would punish him for speaking too loudly. "This place… it’s wrong. Always has been. There’s something here that ain’t meant for us."

His words hung in the thick air, stirring something deep inside each of us—a primal fear that no amount of logic or science could dispel. We exchanged glances, the growing sense that perhaps we, too, were about to disappear without a trace gnawing at the edges of our minds.

I hesitated, glancing up at the manor that loomed ahead, barely visible through the fog. Its twisted, decaying structure seemed to pulse in the mist, as though it had a life of its own, waiting, watching. The rhythmic thumping echoed louder now, almost as if the manor itself had a heartbeat.

“We have to press on,” I said, though my voice lacked the certainty I had hoped for. “We have a duty to find out what happened to our colleague… and to the others.”

But even as I spoke, I could feel the weight of the fog closing in, suffocating any semblance of rationality. The manor was alive, in its own horrible way. And it was waiting for us to step inside.

Dr. Maria Hartman glanced at her colleague, Dr. Thomas Wallace. They shared a look, a silent debate of reason against terror. Finally, Dr. Hartman straightened her shoulders. "We’re here for answers. Our friend and his students could still be inside."

The guide’s eyes widened, his pupils dilated with fear. He hesitated before nodding, though every bone in his body screamed to run.

As we neared the manor, it loomed out of the fog, twisted and more decrepit than any of the photographs had shown. Cracked stone walls were covered in sickly moss, and windows of dark voids reflected nothingness. The front door stood slightly ajar, creaking like an open mouth ready to swallow us whole.

Wallace’s fingers twitched around his flashlight. "We need to find out what happened. We owe them that much."

The guide swallowed hard, his voice barely a rasp. "If we go in there… we might not come back."

We stepped inside, the door groaning shut behind us. As the heavy sound echoed through the decaying halls, the temperature dropped, and the stench of rot hit us like a wall. Cold, damp air weighed on our lungs.

“Well, that isn’t ominous or nothing.” I joked, trying to lighten the mood. 

“I do not feel this is a jovial occasion, Dr. Agiel.” Dr. Wallace complained, clearly upset by the atmosphere of the house.

The rhythmic thumping grew louder. Each pulse reverberated through the walls, rattling the decayed fixtures. The house was alive, and its pulse matched that of the entity lurking within.

The lower floors were eerily silent, filled only with the ruins of forgotten lives—dust-covered furniture, faded portraits, and books disintegrating into ash at the touch.

It wasn’t until we reached the second hallway that the nightmare truly began.

Strange symbols, pulsating with a faint, sickly light, adorned the walls. The closer we got to the symbols, the louder the thumping became, vibrating the very air.

Dr. Wallace ran his fingers over the grooves in one of the symbols. "These… these aren't decorations. They're warnings."

"Or a ward," Dr. Hartman whispered, her eyes scanning the markings. "Something’s trapped here."

“I dare say the only thing trapped here is bad cleaning.” I poked at the symbols and my hand came away glowing. “See, it is just some sort of glowing moss causing these carvings to glow.”

We moved cautiously to the library, where a faint greenish glow seeped through the cracks of the door. Hartman pushed it open slowly.

Inside, we found chaos. Shelves had collapsed, their contents reduced to heaps of dust. The table in the center was split clean in half, symbols etched into it now glowing with an unnatural light.

The strange symbols on the walls glowed faintly, and the familiar rhythmic thumping resonated with an unnatural pulse, growing louder as if something were awakening beneath the floor.

We scanned the room with mounting dread. The floorboards groaned underfoot, sagging as if alive. A creeping chill seemed to rise from the ground itself.

"Do you feel that?" Hartman whispered, her breath shallow. "It's like… like the house is breathing."

Wallace nodded, sweat beading on his forehead. "We need to leave—this place isn’t just cursed. It’s hungry."

“You are just overwrought by the strangeness of this place,” I said, rubbing my face free of sweat even amid the cool air.

Wallace knelt and picked up what looked like a journal. Reading it, his brow furrowed more than I had ever seen it. His eyes widened and he looked back at us. 

“What is it, man? You look like you just read the love notes of Satan himself.” I asked, fearful of the answer.

“It is our friend's journal. We need to get out of here now.” He made for the door as fast as I had ever seen him move.

Suddenly, the floor split open in jagged cracks, black tendrils of shadow spilling from the gaps like inky blood. The house began to twist around us, warping, bending its architecture into grotesque shapes. The once-familiar walls transformed into slick, sinewy material, more akin to flesh than stone.

Then came a deep, guttural laugh that reverberated through the very bones of the house. It was no longer just the rhythmic thumping; it was something else. Something far worse.

"The house… it’s alive!" the guide screamed, backing toward the library door, only to find it sealed shut behind him.

With no escape, the shadows from the cracks writhed like serpents, slithering up the walls, wrapping themselves around the rafters. They had a terrible sentience to them, like they were seeking something. Someone.

The guide froze, his voice trembling. "It's after us. It’s been waiting for us."

Before anyone could move, the tendrils shot forward and grabbed him by the ankles. His scream echoed off the warped walls as they dragged him toward the center of the room, where the floor seemed to open up like a yawning mouth. His body twisted unnaturally, bones breaking, skin stretching as the house consumed him, pulling him down into the black maw.

We watched in horror, our legs paralyzed by fear. Hartman could barely speak. "We… we have to go!"

Sickened by the sight of the man’s death, I stood still, almost giving the creature, the house, time to make me into a snack. A tendril snaked out and stabbed at the place my foot had been a second earlier. 

“Holy Shit, run you idiots, or we are next,” I yelled as I ran like my life depended on it. Which in hindsight it did. “Upstairs, maybe if we get above the mist, the thing will have no control.”

The air on the first floor grew thick with the stench of death. The house groaned again, its guttural laughter more distinct now, almost mocking us.

We sprinted toward the hallway, but the walls were shifting, closing in. The once familiar path now spiraled and contorted, leading our desperate group deeper into the house’s labyrinthine interior. Behind us, the sickening sound of bones cracking and flesh tearing reached us as the house devoured its prey.

"Don’t stop!" Wallace gasped, pulling Hartman along. "It’s trying to trap us!"

The warped walls cracked open and gave us an exit from this, all of us could be eaten buffet. I grabbed both of my friends and pushed them toward the last opening. We bolted from the library, the green fog of the void chasing like a nipping dog after our retreating feet, devouring the floor, walls, and ceiling as we ran. The house shifted and contorted around our party, walls elongating and twisting like the intestines of some hellish beast. The air grew thick with the stench of blood, and the rhythmic thumping was now accompanied by guttural whispers, speaking in a language older than time itself. 

Finally, we reached the main hall. Just as we sighed with relief, having thought we had found a way out, the entrance was sealed shut, stone lay where the doorway used to be, as though the house itself refused to let our dwindling group escape. The thumping was now unbearably loud, shaking the very foundation of the manor. Every corner we turned led us deeper into the nightmare. Doors disappeared, and windows melted into the walls.

“We’re… we’re trapped,” Hartman panted, tears streaking her face. “There’s no way out.”

Wallace’s eyes darted around frantically. “No. There has to be.”

“Up, up,” I screamed, pointing at the stairs we had just come upon. 

I bounded up the stairs two at a time, thankful I had kept my body as sharp as my mind. Maria Hartman was about thirty, and she was a sometimes companion of mine. Presently, we were taking what she called a break, but I still had feelings for her, and I’ll be damned if I was going to lose her to some nightmare house. I turned, grabbed her, and pushed her up the stairs. Wallace stayed close behind us, not wanting to be the one to get eaten next.

The house groaned again, this time louder, as though savoring its victory. And then, from deep within its walls, came the sound of that laughter—a dark, resonant voice speaking words that none of us learned professors could understand. The ancient entity was alive, free, and it had no intention of letting us leave.

As the shadows crept toward us, we heard a deep, resonant voice from the void, speaking in a tongue that burned our ears and attempted to shred our minds. The entity whispered its dark will, its words clawing at our sanity. Hartman closed her eyes, the horror too great to bear. Wallace clenched his fists, his mind unraveling under the weight of the ancient, malevolent presence. As the shadows enveloped us, a final, chilling whisper from the house issued a promise that echoed through the void: **"You are home."**

In a last-ditch effort to save us, I grabbed both and pulled them to a window. Hartman opened her eyes, looked out, and looked back at me just as a tendril snatched at Wallace. My friend of many years was hurled through the air and pulled into a hungry maw waiting for all of us.

Maria screamed as he was eaten, and I grabbed her and we jumped. Fifty feet, give or take a few inches, the water below would be very cold, even near freezing, but our chances were better in that jump than staying in the house. The house above trembled as if our escape broke it. The void the entity was fighting to escape swallowed the last remnants of light, and as the thumping grew deafening, it consumed itself and the house.

I kept Maria in a tight squeeze and kept us plummeting feet first. We hit the water hard. I managed to get us to the surface and then, nothing but darkness as I passed out. Sometime later, I awoke in a cot on a fishing boat, Maria sitting there watching me intently. 

“I always knew you had a streak of crazy in you.” She said, smiling, “But I never thought it would be what saved us.” 

“I am just as surprised as you that it worked.” I jumped up, realizing we were still in danger. “What of the house, what happened to it?”

“The fishermen said there was a blackness that glowed, and then the house was gone. The cliff is now empty.” Maria said, looking sad as she mourned our friend. 

“He saved us even if it wasn’t deliberate, his sacrifice gave us the time to jump and live another day.” I hugged her close, as much to help her as to help me.

“What was that thing?” she asked as she looked into my eyes. 

I contemplated the question, unsure how to answer. 

“The last message our colleague sent us was that the observatory was being used to communicate across dimensions.” I sat down as sudden weakness wracked my body, “They must have woken something up that was able to cross over into our world, even if partially.”

My vision blurred and the boat pitched. 

“Matthew, what was that?” Maria asked, fright lacing her voice.

“I guess a wave.” I rubbed my eyes, trying to see clearly again.

Slowly, my eyes cleared as a tentacle lashed out and pulled Maria into the depths. 

“MARIA!” I screamed. 

I ran to the railing in time to see the creature wink out of existence with Maria in its jaws. In one last almost defiant gesture, the monster had pulled open the gate between us and snatched Maria and the fishermen back to its hellish dimension. My mind was nearly destroyed by the loss of my love and the events of the day. I went to the cabin and piloted to shore, so I could tell the world of what we went through and what was coming. 

That beast opened the gate without human sacrifice or help. There is no reason to believe it will not do so again. So, if you see an article about a haunted house, do not go to investigate, it might just be a hoax, or it could be that creature hungry again for our flesh.
