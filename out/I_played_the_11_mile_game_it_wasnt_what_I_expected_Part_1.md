If you’re thinking of playing the 11 mile game, don’t. Especially not if your best friend asks you too. I’ll give you a little backstory. 

I have always believed in the paranormal to an extent, but I never believed in the hauntings you hear about or the rituals people would talk about online or in school. I’d always hear stories from classmates about their experiences with ghosts, but I’d never believe them, of course. It was stories that were just unbelievable, like knives flying through the air, or even something as little as hearing sounds and whispers. 

However, I do believe in the afterlife and spirits. What I mean by that is I believe that spirits can watch over us, like loved ones you’ve lost or even God protecting you. I don’t think spirits are walking amongst us at all times but I do believe they can be with us at hard times, that may sound strange but I think wherever we go when we pass, that being the afterlife or a sunny beach on a tiny island that we make up in our minds, that we can still be with the ones we love. 

That being said, when I heard about the 11-mile game from one of my friends, to say the least I didn’t believe it was true at all. Gracie was a firm believer in the paranormal, always going to haunted places to do her little investigations. She loves anything ghost-related, and I, being the complete opposite, how we are best friends, I have no clue. 

So when she asked me to go with her, I had no problem agreeing and even offering to drive. Now I know that in the rules you must go by yourself, and Gracie knew that too. Which is why she went by herself the first time; it ended up not working, so she asked me to go with her, just as a fun thing for us to do together. 

We were still going to take it seriously, or as seriously as I could. So that’s where we are now, Gracie sitting passenger messing around on her phone, me driving on some lone back road of our small town. We decided on taking Gracie’s run-down Nissan Versa in comparison to my newer Jeep. 

In the rules, she found there was no mention of not knowing the back roads you were driving on, so I pretty much knew them well. I grew up in the country outside of town, so I rode the 4-wheelers my dad owned out here all the time. 

“What are you going to wish for?” Gracie questioned me, putting her phone down to look over at me. 

“Considering this isn’t going to work, I’m going to wish for a large stack of cash.” I replied jokingly, waving my right hand in a “duh” motion. 

We soon fell back into a comfortable silence. Gracie turned our phones and the radio off as per instructions. While I was driving, I didn’t feel scared, to me, it felt like any other drive. Gracie and I would go driving quite often. I looked to the passenger seat out of the corner of my eye, and I could see Gracie’s knee bouncing slightly, her hands shaking in fear of what was to come. 

Just to play along, I set my mind on the thing I most desired, it wasn’t money, it was happiness. I wanted a farmhouse, not too big, just comfortable enough for a family. I wanted cattle like my dad owned, and I wanted to run the farm when he retired. I wanted just enough money to live a little fancier than comfortable, I wanted to be able to give my kids (in the way future) all the presents on Christmas, just like I had growing up. 

To me, that sounded like a fair wish. I had a small smile on my face as I was thinking about my dream. It’s a big if, but if this truly worked, I would have what I truly desired. I don’t know if it was my suspicions about whether this was real or not, or if it was simply that Gracie and I were truly into this. 

But up ahead, about a mile, I could see it. A road that didn’t belong, it didn’t have a road marker, and there was no stop sign, but up ahead to the right was a road I had never been on before. Coming up on the road, I could see trees lining it, but they weren’t normal trees. 

At the tops of the trees, they were glistening, not too noticeable, but think of a small engagement ring glistening in the sunlight. There was no sunlight; it was midnight, and to me, this felt like a sign. I could tell Gracie noticed it too; her eyes sparkled as she looked up at it. 

She quickly turned to me and said, “I think that’s the road.” With a small smile on her face, she was still shaking slightly, like she was trying to mask her fear. 

“If you say so,” I said, lightly scoffing, what I didn’t say was the pull that I felt when I looked at the road and its glistening trees. 

I don’t quite know if it was even me who turned right, or if it was the strong pull that I felt, guiding me, like two opposite ends of magnets connecting. Then we were on the road, and I didn’t feel any different, I didn’t know if I was supposed to. I just kept thinking that this might actually work, that if we make it through this, I would actually get what I dreamed. 

For the first time since we left, I felt real excitement, like the kind you find yourself feeling as a kid on Christmas morning. 

“Okay, so for the first mile, it looks easy; it’s just going to get cold. Oh, and remember, don’t drive over 30.” Gracie spoke out, reading the rules to me from the piece of paper she had written them on. 

“Okay, sounds easy enough.” I replied, dragging out the last of the “okay”. 

Then we were driving, looking around didn’t appeal much, with trees lining both sides of the road there wasn’t much to look at. I could feel a slight drop in the temperature, but not enough to need the heater, or to believe this was actually working. Gracie and I stayed in a comfortable silence, maybe to process if this was really happening, or just because we couldn’t find the words. 

The first mile flew by, I drove at a whopping 20 miles per hour, I just couldn’t bear to drive any faster in case my heavy foot went over the slow 30 I was supposed to stay under. By the time we were almost finished with the first mile, I knew this was working. How? Because the odometer reset itself to zero, with just two zeros sitting in the spot, Gracie’s 74,000 miles were where I knew we were officially playing the 11-mile game. 

“Gracie, check out your odometer,” I said, fear slipping into my voice, no matter how much I tried to hide it. 

“Holy shit, we did it,” Gracie said with what sounded like excitement slipping through, I couldn’t tell though. 

As the little zeros at the bottom of the dash changed, the right number spinning up and a 1 replacing the zero, I knew we had made it to the second mile. Within 50 yards of the second mile, it was cold, not like your AC has been blowing too long, like you had taken a plunge in the icy waters off the coast of Antarctica. 

“Good god, it’s fucking cold.” I stutter out, teeth chattering, hands reaching to blast the heater. 

Gracie’s not faring much better; I hear her mutter out a response in agreement. Looking around, nothing much had changed, except you could feel it, the pull. The pull was so strong, it made me want to slam my foot on the gas pedal to get wherever it wanted me to go faster. I could feel it in my whole body, like it was the candle, and I was just a mere bug getting drawn in. 

“Whoa, do you feel that?” Gracie said, eyes wide, twinkling with something I had never seen before. 

“Yeah, it’s so creepy,” I replied wearily. It almost felt like whatever it was wanted me there, wanted me to fly right into the flames and burn. 

Subconsciously, my speed went from 20 to 23, then 23 to 27. When I looked down, I was doing 31 miles per hour. I quickly took my foot off the gas and tapped the brake to get back down to 20. That was too close, I don’t know what happens when you go over 30, I don’t quite want to find out. I decide not to mention my speeding to Gracie, not wanting to upset her. 

Coming to a close on the second mile, I was feeling pretty good about this. It’s been pretty easy so far, despite the ever-growing pull; I’ve been able to manage pretty good so far. I decided to break the peace that had settled over us, and I sent my dear passenger a quick “how are you feeling?”. 

I could see she was lost in thought small smile resting upon her face. When she registered what I had said, she turned to look at me. Smile still gracing her beautiful face, she answered with a short response. 

“I feel great, like all my dreams are finally going to come true.” When she said this, it made me smile, 

Gracie hadn’t had the best upbringing. Her parents weren’t well off like mine were; she often spent nights at my house growing up. It was mostly to get away from her dad, her dad drank a lot, and when he did, he would yell at her. Oftentimes times he would degrade her for her preferences in partners. There was a time her father forbade her from seeing me because he thought that I had influenced her in her decisions. 

“If anyone deserves it, it’s you, babe,” I told her, something I’ve told her many times over the years, but she never believed me. Until now. 

I looked down, and the 1 on the odometer became a 2. We had started the third mile. I was anxiety-ridden, to say the least. It had been easy so far, but what are they going to throw at us now? I’m not quite sure who “they” are, but I’m not sure I want to know either. 

“Okay, so it says we’re going to see human-shaped shadows in the trees, we’re supposed to ignore them, no matter how close they may seem. So basically just keep your eyes on the road.” Gracie says, reading from her handmade list of rules. 

“Okay, that should be easy enough,” I reply, fear quickly settling into the pit of my stomach. 

The first few minutes into the third mile were normal; the heater was still blowing, contrasting with the cold frigid air that was in the car. My eyes were glued to the middle of the road. The road had been straight for the last 2 miles, but I could see a curve coming up ahead. It wasn’t sharp; it was wavy. I was able to maintain my speed going around it. 

Coming out of the curve is when I saw the first shadow figure out of the corner of my eye, I couldn’t look at it fully, but from what I saw from the small glance I got, it was huge. It felt as if all the blood in my veins fell to the same icy temperature that was in the car. The figure was on the passenger side, standing by the tree line. As soon as we passed, it started running after the car. 

Panic flooded me, and all I wanted to do was step on the gas and get out of there, but I couldn’t. It’s then that Gracie looks over to me, she can see my white knuckled grip on the steering wheel, my non-driving leg that was up in my seat resting was now back on the floor and bouncing like crazy. 

“Hey, it’s okay, they won’t hurt you. You just have to keep driving and calm down.” Gracie said, trying to be reassuring, putting her hand on my shoulder, rubbing her thumb back and forth. 

I didn’t work; nonetheless, I nodded at her words, I can’t believe this shit. Keeping my eyes on the road proved to be a difficult task; shadows were dancing in the corner of my eyes, getting closer. They were so close now I didn’t have to see them out of the corner of my eye, I could see them right next to the car, one of them even hit the hood as we drove by. 

“Holy shit, I thought they couldn’t touch us.” I yelled out, and the panic I had been desperately trying to hold in came bursting out of me. 

I took my eyes off the road for a moment to look over at Gracie. She hadn’t turned around yet; she was watching them, a grin plastered on her face. When she turned and looked at me, she looked scared like I was, but I swore I saw her face; she was happy, not giddy, almost bouncing in her seat. 

It was like she couldn’t be more excited to be anywhere else. Putting my eyes back on the road was the hardest thing in the world for me. I knew the second I looked back, I would see them again. I was right, there was one standing crouched right in the middle of the road, before I could even hit the brakes, Gracie yelled out to “keep going,” so I listened. 

It wasn’t like I expected, it didn’t smack into the car; it just vanished when we made contact, disappearing into a cloud of smoke. My inner turmoil at this point was telling me to turn around and head back. I knew it was a bad idea; I had done my own research. If we don’t finish the road we can’t go home, which means I’ll never get to see my parents again, or my cat, Nacho. 

Looking back at the road is when I see it, it’s right on the driver's side of the car, running on all fours, filling the car. It’s right next to my window, I want to speed up but I can’t. My head is screaming at me to go faster, to do something: “Go faster, it’s right there, drive!, drive!, drive!” 

I’m screaming in my head, and then we change to the fourth mile, and it’s no longer outside my window. It’s sitting right behind me, in the car, I can feel it. Hot breath on the back of my neck, it may not be cold, but it sends a wave of shivers down my spine. It takes everything in me not to look in the rear-view mirror. 

I freeze. I can just barely see Gracie out of the corner of my eye. She sees it, too. Gracie puts a hand on my shoulder, comfortingly keeping her eyes on the road. It helps for a minute before I hear it, the whispering, a low, gargling voice, right in my ear. 

“Stop the car.” 

“Stop the car.” 

“Stop the car!” 

So loud in my ear, I can barely hear the rumbling of the car engine, or the heater still blasting in my face. Then I realized that it wasn’t Gracie’s hand at all on my shoulder, because as the thing was whispering in my ear, its grip tightened. 

“Gracie!” I whispered, not like the thing couldn’t hear me, but I honestly don’t think my shaking voice could get any louder. 

My hands on the wheel were shaking; hell, even my foot on the gas pedal, making my speed flicker up and down a notch. I was talking to her but I didn’t dare take my eyes off the road. She was watching the road when she replied. 

“I know it’s okay, just keep driving.” She didn’t whisper as I had, but talking in a normal tone like this was a random Saturday night. 

“We’re almost home,” the thing whispered in my ear again. I tried to just block it out, but it was hard. 

Tears pricked my eyes, and I could feel them sliding down my face, blurring my vision of the road briefly. Hands still shaking, I brought one of them up, the sleeve of my hoodie over my fingers to wipe my eyes. I kept driving, not once looking in the tree line. The shadows were gone now, distant whispers coming instead. The more I listened to what they were saying, the closer the whispers got. 

I tuned them out, too, hoping and praying the next mile was any better. The thing finally retracted its hand from my shoulder, instant relief flooded my body, and I felt like I could finally breathe. With its breath gone from the back of my neck, I loosened my grip on the steering wheel, hands cramping from how tight my grip was. 

The little numbers on the bottom of my dash changed again, from a 3 to 4; the fifth mile had begun. There was a break in the trees, and the most beautiful lake I had ever seen came into view. I slowed the car down, now barely moving. The moon was so big and bright, its reflection shining off the lake, creating sparkles that even I couldn’t resist staring at. 

There was a small bridge going over the lake, lamp posts lighting the bunches of vines and flowers wrapping around the rails. 

“Whoa, it’s gorgeous,” I muttered out to enamored by the sight in front of me, to look at Gracie as I was talking to her. 

“Isn’t it, it’s my favorite part. I knew you would love it.” She replied, eyes wide, grinning from ear to ear, breaking her eyes from the sight in front of her to look back at me. 

Immediately, I broke my gaze to look at her, and she had already turned her head back to look at the lake. I watched her for a moment, and that’s when it clicked. All those times I thought she was shaking from nerves or fear, those times I caught her smiling when she didn’t know I was watching. When she tried to play the 11-mile game, it worked for her, she wasn’t shaking from fear, she was shaking because she could barely contain her excitement knowing she was coming back. 

I finally spoke, words flowing out of me, “What the hell's going on!” It came out much more aggressive than I intended. 

She looked back over to me and told me to stop the car, but I refused. It’s in the rules to never stop the car, especially on mile 5, so I kept driving. I told her she better start explaining, and she did. She told me all about her first time, how grand it was. The things that I’m so afraid of were talking to her, telling her that there’s a house on mile 6, waiting for her. 

“I couldn’t pass that up, it’s perfect for us, Lex, we can stay there forever. It’s a big, beautiful farmhouse. There are cattle and chickens. I know you hate chickens, but we can wish them away. We can stay there and not have to worry about what anyone thinks of us. I love you.” She spoke out, using my nickname she gave me all those years ago. 

I was stunned. She wanted to stay. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing, my eyes went wide, and my mouth dropped open in shock. Not only did she trick me into coming here, but she actually thinks that I would want to stay here. 

“We can’t stay here, Gracie. We won’t be able to see our families anymore. Let alone those things that are out here.” I finally stuttered out, barely able to find the words. 

I love Gracie, I do, and I’ve wished to hear those words from her for years. She’s the only thing that I left out in my wish, but we couldn’t stay here, she had to realize that. I saw the shock on her face from my refusal, and tears came to her eyes. I couldn’t bear to look at them, so I looked back at the road. 

The lake was long gone by now, and I could tell we were coming up on the sixth mile. Gracie was still silent as ever, picking at her fingers. I don’t know what was in store for us on the next mile. I’m not sure if I even want to think about it. I saw the little numbers slowly switch, 4-5. The sixth mile had started. 

Immediately, the trees surrounded us once more, and the moon that was once shining was gone. The feeling of dread surged through me, my hands clamping up. Beads of sweat started to form on my forehead, my heart beating faster. Gracie wasn’t so gloomy anymore; that excitement had returned, and I realized that no matter what this game through at me, this was going to be the hardest mile. 

Picking my speed back up, I heard a crackling noise, almost static-like, a walkie-talkie. The radio was making noise, like something was trying to get the right channel to talk to us. I stiffened in my seat, muscles tensing. I remembered what Gracie had said about mile 6: the radio will talk about your greatest fears, about the things that are to come. 

“You're almost home.” 

“She’ll never love you.” 

“They're watching you.” 

“You can’t see them, but they're getting closer.” 

A pool of fear pitted its way into my stomach, and I wanted to puke. I knew they were watching; I could feel it. I knew they were just inside the tree line, waiting. Gracie didn’t look so excited anymore. I could tell which words were for me and which were meant for her. She wasn’t taking them as well as I was, and to be totally honest I wasn’t taking them well at all. 

“Hey, it’s just the game, it doesn’t mean anything. Remember, they’re just words.” I tried to reassure her, I tried to place my hand comforting on her leg, but she moved away. 

We fell back into a silence, the radio going quiet for now, the silence wasn’t comfortable; it was awkward, and I wanted to be anywhere but here. The tension was so thick I felt as if I looked over, I could see the strings that needed to be cut. Coming up a hill, my headlights flickered, acting as if they were going to plunge us into darkness. Thankfully, they stayed on. 

“There it is,” Gracie mumbled out, eyes wide, mouth gaping. 

Looking up, I saw the most magnificent house, with a big flowering garden, and a deep in-ground pool peeking out from the backyard. The house wasn’t big, two stories, maybe four bedrooms. It was a red brick house, with white painted window frames to go with it. The garden was surrounded by a white picket fence, and I can only imagine what the pool area looked like. It was beautiful. 

Just by seeing the house, I knew where the ever-growing pull was coming from. I slowed the car down as we were coming up on the house, not stopping but barely moving. Gracie couldn’t take her eyes off of it. I could see tears streaming down her cheeks, dripping onto the band T-shirt she was wearing. They weren’t from sadness, she was crying the happiest tears I had ever seen. 

By that time, I knew I had made a mistake, broken from my trance, and the vision of the house put on me flickered. Standing where the house of dreams once was, I could see an old, rundown house; it was falling apart. The garden that once stood full of bursting colors was rotted, the pool filled with dirt and debris. 

Then Gracie bolted, she ripped her seat belt off and threw the door open. I slammed on the brakes, just as she threw her body out of the car at the speed of light. 

“Gracie, no!” I screamed, full of horror, as I slammed the gear shifter into park. Gracie was halfway to the front door of the rotted home. 

I’m sitting in the car as I’m typing this out, I don’t know what to do or how to get us out of this alive. There wasn’t a house in the rules, so please if you’ve played, or if you know something. I need help. I’m going to follow Gracie in the house now, I will update as soon as I can.
