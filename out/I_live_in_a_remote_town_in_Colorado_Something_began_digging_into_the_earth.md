I live in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. The town I live in is remote and basically in the middle of nowhere, miles away from Estes or any other popular tourist destination. The internet is shoddy at best, and non-existent at worst. The specific town I live in is in a valley, which opens up into a small field a little ways out of town. I live higher on the ridges surrounding town.

Context out of the way, the story can begin. A couple days ago, I heard a knock at my door. It was only 5 in the morning, the sun had just barely risen. But I got up anyway, getting ready to chew off the ear of whoever woke me up so early. 

My neighbor, Mikey, was outside. "Dude, have you seen that piramid?" He asked. The look on face must have been pretty obvious, as he continued, "There's these massive black pyramid things to the East, they appeared last night but no one remembers seeing them appear. Follow me, we can see them from the gas station on the hill."

I reluctantly agreed. Normally I would have assumed it was some dumb joke, but there were other people outside, more than normal at this hour, all talking and looking towards the east.

As I woke up more on the wall over, I realized how weird the situation was. "So, a bunch of pyramids just showed up?"

Mikey nodded. "And no one knows how, or what they're doing here."

"What about security cameras? Has anyone checked them?"

Mikey again nodded, "They checked but all the cameras went offline for like, three hours. No video or audio was recorded. And when they came back, those pyramids were there."

I hesitated. "If this is an elaborate prank, I'm keying your car."

Mikey put his hands up. "Yeesh, it ain't that serious, besides, I'm telling the truth."

"You better be."

By the time we reached the gas station, a crowd had already formed, looking towards the small field. I found an open spot and, by god himself, Mikey wasn't pulling my leg. Off in the distance, a handful of massive black pyramids stood. They were tall, must have been as tall as the Rockies themselves, but thin, like the tip of a sharpened pencil. They weren't moving, as far as I could see, but I didn't like it.

I'm not sure how long I stood there, staring at them, listening to other people's gossip about them. Some people claimed it was cult activity, which I had never heard of. Someone suggested mass psychosis, but some psychologist quickly shut that down, with an explanation I couldn't even begin to understand. A couple conspiracy theories were also thrown around.

But there wasn't really much we could do except monitor the pyramids, we are just a small town in the middle of jack shit nowhere, so most of us tried to go on with our day like usual. 

I kept a close eye on the news, mostly local, in fact, only local. That's when I learned they were changing. The panels of the pyramids were opening, and some weird technology was coming out of them, beams and mechanics forming what looked like the skeleton of a superstructure. But it wasn't a super structure.

Out of the largest and second largest pyramids came the digging machines. One was a massive drill, set up to point at the ground, the other looked like the claw of an excavator. The drill looked stationary, but the claw could move around the entire structure freely.

And then it started digging.

At this point I left my house, walking up to the gas station to once again see a crowd already there. Sure enough, the news was true. The drill was slowly turning, burrowing into the ground.

"You know Katlyn Erickson?" 

I jumped. Mikey was standing behind me, I hadn't noticed him coming, too distracted by the drill. "What?"

"Katlyn Erickson. You know her?" Mikey repeated.

I nodded. "I've seen her a couple times. What about her?"

"She's gonna drive over to the pyramids tomorrow, park a distance away and fly her drone up to them to get a better look. She's gonna Livestream it to the local news network and maybe a couple bigger ones." 

I looked out at the pyramids. "The Colorado government hasn't done anything yet?"

Someone else responded. "They are, did you not hear the order? We're not supposed to mention this to anyone outside of the town." The man turned to Mikey. "So it won't be reported on any large news stations, either."

The sun was already setting, I knew that it would soon be too dark to properly see the pyramids. Not much else I could do, anyway. All I know about those things is that I'm not going anywhere near them.

The Livestream happened early the next morning. Katlyn had already launched her drone, and it was almost at the pyramids. The drill had gotten a lot deeper since last night, and the claw was busy moving dirt and keeping it out of the hole.

Eventually the drone was able to get inside of the framework, showing much more than I could see from the hill. Closer to the ground, multiple more panels had opened up, long beams being pushed out of them before smaller mechanical arms dragged them into the hole. It was dark, but I could just barely see that they were placing structural supports inside of the hole. 

"Ms. Erickson, can you fly the drone into the hole?" The voice of the newswoman surprised me, I had forgotten I was watching the news.

"No, I don't think so, I'll lose connection with the drone," the low quality voice buzzed. "Besides, I think I see a couple of government drones. They might be able to investigate it."

I was done at this point. It was early in the morning and I had heard all I wanted to hear. I layed back down on the couch and fell asleep. 

The rest of the day progressed as normal as it could have, considering the situation. The government set up a no-trespassing zone around pyramids, aiming to keep the public away from them. 

The story didn't change much for the next few days. The government continued to tell us to not talk about this to anyone outside of our town.

Until yesterday. It was night, there had been tremors for a while, but I brushed them all off. I was inside the gas station looking for a microwave dinner, and when I walked out, I looked in the direction of the pyramids. I'm not sure why, I couldn't even see them. 

A beam of light shot through the air, piercing the sky, followed by a high-pitched noise, I had to cover my ears to keep them from hurting. Looking back, the beam of light was coming from the hole being drilled. It started to widen, the pyramids and structures around it crumbling at seemingly nothing. And then there was a flash. 

I was blinded for a few seconds. When I could finally open my eyes and see again, the beacon was gone. No one slept that night.

The government still has the zone under lockdown, and isn't revealing any information on what happened. If anything, they're censoring it, anyone who posts about it online has the post immediately removed and their account banned. They tried to say it never happened, that it was a prank or a ploy by the town government to get more tourists.

But that's not true, I saw it happen. I saw the pyramids, I saw the beam, no human could have done that, but no one believes me, or anyone else talking about it. They think I'm blowing it out of proportion and getting worked up over nothing. 

But there's other things I'm worried about. I've lived in Colorado for years, and have only experienced an earthquake once or twice. But in the last few days, I have no idea how many I've felt, they're not particularly strong, but the amount is worrying. Noone can figure out what's causing them, and government agencies are still silent when it comes to the topic. 

A few people have done readings of the tectonic activity in the area, but I don't entirely understand the results. From what I can tell, the working theory is that the drill dislodged a section of a tectonic plate underneath Colorado, causing it to shift in the ground. They say it shouldn't be an issue, it'll eventually resolve itself and the piece will get wedged back into place. 

I don't know much about geology, but that doesn't feel like a sound explanation to me. I'm sure someone else who knows the subject better can point out the issues in that theory. 

The noises started yesterday, weird creaks and groans coming from where the hole used to be and its surrounding area, followed by even worse tremors. Most people are saying that it's just the loose piece of plate grinding against the other plates underground, and I want to believe it, but I just can't. It doesn't feel right. Some of the sounds sound like stone grinding together, but the groans soundâ€¦ organic. 

I sound crazy. I know I sound crazy, but I'm not the only one who thinks this, a couple people agree with me that it sounds organic. 

This morning, I was again standing on the gas station hill, looking at the spot where the pyramids and the drill used to be. And I swear to God, the ground was bulging. A massive area of ground, miles long, was raised higher than I remember.

I think I might be going crazy, I'm not sure. But I've packed my bags and bought a hotel room in Denver. 

That drill awakened something up, and I'm not sticking around to see what.
