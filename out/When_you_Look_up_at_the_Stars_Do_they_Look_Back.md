This cautionary tale is for those of you who enjoy long walks and nature outings and heaven forbid, looking up at the stars. For most, that’s as hazardous a hobby as collecting stamps but for an unlucky few it can rapidly become a deadly game of cat and mouse. Take a moment to read this and keep it vaulted in the back of your mind, just in case you’re one of those few because at least then you’ll know what to do to have a snowball’s chance in hell of surviving the night. This happened to me so I’m your living proof that my ‘rules’ work. Just another bizarre tale of mimicry I’ll share with you and if you chose to listen or if you don’t, my conscious is clear after giving you the tools to guard yourself.

This is one of those nights which takes root in the mind, burrows deep and festers with the passage of time. I will never forget it. If anything, it grows stronger with age. The acridity of that fear lingers at the margins of my thoughts even as I type this. People talk about primordial fear and I reckon this was that. It’s that terror which hastened out ancestors to huddle around a campfire and seek safety in company. We evolved as a species and got sleek with our defences but that terror never left us. It’s our most important self-defence mechanism and we just forgot to listen when the alarm bells ring. Until the shriek is so loud it can’t be ignored.

I wasn’t any different. I dealt with a lot of this madness so I actually started growing an ego but this night slapped my confidence right back into the dust where it belonged. There are things out there nobody can fight or run from. At best you can hide for a while but they’re older than this blue and green marble spinning on its axes through space. They don’t care about our silly camp fires and self-delusionary arrogance. Lucky for us, there are rules. Who made those rules and why they trump all else I can’t tell you. I doubt anyone could but you better take a seat and jot them down. I can’t give you a list since nobody gave me one either. I was simply lucky enough to live long enough to begin figuring some of the pieces of this terrifying mosaic and I’m adding to it, piece by scary piece.

To preface this, I love taking walks at night. There’s always a moment when the world slows down. It never stops and honestly, I thing I’d be more freaked out than reassured if I found myself completely alone, but the occasional taxi driver or street crossing fox make just enough waves to let you know you’re not alone without threatening the peace. I love it. I loved it.

The city I lived in was not large by metropolitan standards but it wasn’t a village. It took roughly half an hour to hit the outskirts and walk on back road paths which rarely see cars but they’re close enough to civilization for nature to keep a respectful distance. Basically it’s a wilder park and it’s where I liked being with my thoughts. It was almost habit for me to take a stroll with my flashlight and phone if I needed to clear my head on clear evenings. Nothing ever happened so why should that night be any different? I never ventured off the beaten path where there were lamplights because even I’m not dumb enough to waltz into the forest in the dark. Mimics are scary but serial killers are a thing too.

I recall the sun setting while I walked towards the edge of the city. I had my phone and my flashlight. If I needed to I could always call on one of my friends to pick me up but this was normal for me. Maybe I found the habit reassuring since I worked nightshift for many years and I grew acquainted with that moment of silence. Even after losing my job, I yearned for it. My thoughts never settled as neatly as they did on those walks.

Either way, ignoring the recklessness of my actions, I found the spot I usually liked. There was this clearing and it’s not the fairy-tale spot you’re probably imagining. Just a bit of ground hedged in by wild bramble where the towering trees parted so if you stood between them you could look up at a clear patch of night sky. With the absence of city lights, the stars actually had a chance to shine and it was a popular date spot. Case in point, I recall seeing a number of empty beer cans on the ground. Whatever teenagers drove there were long gone. Picking one of the cans up, and I realized there was rain sloshing inside so they must have been the evidence of mistakes past. You may call me judgey for assuming they were mistakes but a used rubber left to stretch out like a dying slug by the cans made me grimace. Been there, done that and I did not like looking at the t-shirt.

I listened for a few heartbeats, just to make sure I claimed the clearing for myself that evening and the only sounds were the sighs and groans of the wild. Yep, I was alone alright. I actually remember smiling in satisfaction. What an idiot. I planned to rest on the grassy knoll for a while, let the peace and silence saturate my bone marrow before trekking back home before it got too late.

I always started the walk back the same. It’d be criminal to be in a spot where you can drink in the majesty of the starry night and not stop to stare. The night was clear so no pesky clouds got in the way. I just stood there and gawked at the pretty twinkling jewels. Now, I’m not an avid star gazer and I can’t pretend to know my constellations but even I knew the Big Dipper. It was very easy to spot the glowing dots outlining the shape and I ran my eyes over the stars, one by one. Nine in total. Wait…was that right? I remember standing there to rake my brain for the answer. With my limited knowledge maybe I was getting my facts wrong and there had always been two extra dots at the end of the pitcher…

See, that’s how those Mimics work. They never slide into something too obvious because then their trick would be over far too quickly but a few additional stars in a constellation? How many of us can boast to know the starry arrangements so well, it would immediately make us call bullshit? And those of you who actually know your stuff, don’t worry. The Mimics will find other things around you to mess with. The trick is for them to be just hard enough to decipher but not impossible. If you don’t stare at them then they’re just some pretty lights in the sky but when you look, they look back. That’s the trap sprung. And you better know to run.

So here I was doing the dumbest thing I could have done, staring. The creepy feeling started slow but grew fast. Have you ever felt that shiver creep up the ladder of your spine when someone’s looking at you? Someone who doesn’t have the best intentions? If you know, you know. It’s one of those defence-mechanisms we’ve learned to ignore but should pay more attention to. I felt it now. It started at the small of my back and frosted over by bones like a chill working below the cover of my skin. The night was mild and warm enough for shorts but I shook like a leaf.

Now I was lucky to have some experience with this stuff so I knew to book it but you might be tempted to call it nerves and dismiss it. Other than this sixth sense there’s no other warning. The Mimic Stars already pegged you as their pray and you won’t realize it until it’s too late but your surroundings are already scheming to snatch you. It’s the shadows. They’re going to shift and they’ll be sly about it. You won’t notice for a long time and at night, in a spot where you can see the stars clearly, you’re at a major disadvantage. To this day I still can’t say if those shadows are part of the Mimic Stars or a separate Mimic organism working in symbiosis. The Stars themselves don’t shift from their location and track you from above but the danger is crawling at your feet.  

Tearing my stare away felt like ripping Velcro. It felt like my own neck was fighting with my head but when I shook myself loose, the danger was impossible to ignore. The trees felt closer, or the clearing shrank? I couldn’t figure it at first then I noticed the shadows. They writhed. Slow and steadily they twisted over one another to creep slowly over the ground. The motion was subtle enough you wouldn’t catch it unless you stopped and stared but then you’re sacrificing precious seconds. They were too serpentine to mirror the trees they pretended to Mimicry. Wind didn’t make branches slither like that!

I ran faster that night then I thought my legs could carry me. Really made it apparent I needed to up my cardio workout. The shadows didn’t move any faster. I don’t know if it was because they couldn’t or didn’t need to. Those Mimics sure do love to play with their food… The path back to the city was remote but thankfully still peppered with lampposts. People were known to walk or bike along it and it was maintained enough to prevent someone from breaking their neck over a pothole.

They became my safety nets and I ran from one patch of light to the next, taking a moment to catch my breath while I panted beneath the buttery yellow umbrella. The shadows were creeping all the while and I was scared if I lingered too long then they’d cut off my path. Maybe I could stay under a lamp until morning but I wasn’t willing to risk it. Honestly I had no reason to assume running to the city helped either but I reasoned, the cacophony of lights would offer more protection. Clearly those tendrils didn’t like the glow. I could feel that frost slab on by back the whole way too so I knew the Mimic Stars were still watching. I’ll admit it, I was too scared to look back again. What if I couldn’t break away this time?

I must have been sprinting for a decent twenty minutes, not accounting for the five minute breaks in between when the sanctuary of a lamplight allowed it, and that’s when I realized the Mimics were tricking me. I swear the distance didn’t get any shorter which was impossible on a path roughly half an hour out at a casual stroll. Mimics lack imagination and I suspect they literally have an inability to create things, or they’d be impossible to escape, but they can alter your perception of reality. They love doing it in fact. This path I’d been treadmilling on looked the same but I must have been getting myself turned around while convinced I was dashing for the city. Now that I realized it, it made more sense why the shadows seemed able to keep up even though they barely crawled across the ground…

The lamplights were clearly there since the shadows kept their distance so the distortion must have happened between one light source to the next. Was I just running on the spot? Was I turning back over and over, covering a small portion of ground while my eyes saw what the Mimic Stars wanted me to see? I still can’t give you a definitive answer and it hardly mattered. The important thing was, I spotted the distortion in time. Noticing a Mimic’s trick doesn’t give you immunity but it’s a hell of a lot harder for your reality to get turned around. It gave me back precious seconds otherwise wasted between lamps and I’m convinced without them, I’d be a footnote in history today. The shadows never changed their speed so I can assume that slow creep was the extent of their mobility. Easy to outrun. Under normal circumstances. 

Finally, I was getting close. And yes, I did try to use the flashlight and phone but I guess the light wasn’t strong enough. The shadows were unbothered when I shone the glow on them and for some ungodly reason I caught no signal on the phone which was weird because I never had an issue before... In hindsight I realize that was all mind-fuckery from the Mimics but you try to think clearly with a brain pickled in adrenaline. I cursed, aggressively, pocketed my two items and kept going.

I distinctly recall being one lamppost away from the first pub which was still open. I could see the lights shine through the windows and I almost got that goofy grin of unadulterated jubilation to stretch from ear to ear. If I could reach it, then I’d be safe inside for sure until I steadied my legs to keep going home. I rushed for that lamppost like I was about to collapse into the open arms of a lover. The glow of the bulb was powerful and warm and it nearly tricked me.

Remember when I mentioned mind-fuckery? Yeah, this was a trick and so, so sneaky! I ran past the ‘light’ all the way to the pub and that stitch in my ribs cut like a hot knife through butter. The lamppost looked like all the rest but below it, where the light should be casting a halo of protection, there was a nest of snaking shadows twisting. That light was a mirage in the dessert. Later I went back and realized the lamp hadn’t worked for years. That’s a good rule to keep tucked away. Always look where the light should hit not just at the bulb. If you see shadows, it’s a fake and you’ll just sit there like an idiot waiting to be snatched.

I must have cut quite the mad figure, barging into the pub like a lunatic out of breath but they must have seen worse. After a moment of silence, the merriment picked right back up and I asked for a glass of water to steady my nerves. The bartender joked that maybe I should get something stronger but I didn’t think a cloudy head was smart. I already filled my quota to stupid decisions that evening so I politely declined.

Turned out I was right and the pub was my sanctuary. I think I stayed there for a short while but I was too on edge to consider relaxing. Some people approached to see if I was ok since I must have looked frazzled and out of breath but I assured them I wasn’t on drugs or crazy, just had a rough night. One of the patrons, an older gentleman I didn’t recognise, mentioned he saw me on his way to the pub but I was acting strange. He considered calling the authorities to check on me and he kept laughing at how glad he was I seemed fine now. Apparently I kept running forward a few steps then turning in a circle until I gasped for breath. He said I didn’t notice him even when he shouted to ask if I needed help. I never realized there were other people on the path… Wonder if others saw me and assumed it’d be best to leave the crazy lady to herself. The Mimic Stars wouldn’t have affected them if they didn’t notice them and they could have jostled me out of my distortion but I can’t blame them for keeping a safe distance.  

The bartender was nice but he eyed me cautiously from time to time, just in case. I lingered until I finished a glass of tap water, best water I ever tasted, but I was itching to get home. Until I’d get my ass barricaded inside my own home with every light blasting, I wasn’t going to smooth out my nerves. Getting home was uneventful, though I swear on my mother’s ashes I noticed the occasional twitch from a shadowy corner as I hopscotched from light to light until I jammed my keys into the lock. Maybe it was just my imagination. Or maybe I was doing that thing I warned you not to do and ignoring my self-preserving instincts. Crazy how easily we slip into that trap and it’s of our own making.

So there you have it, my story. And if you’re curious about the following night, no. The impostor stars were gone. I noticed a few Mimic Stars since but now I know how to protect myself better. They’re always there, mind you. You’ve certainly seen them but unless you noticed them they don’t bother looking back. These Mimics hunt pray that’s aware so they’ll slip into things where they’ll be noticed. They’ll wait to be spotted and then they’ll start the hunt. Those pho-Stars hunt one night then move on. If you find them again, they’ll chase you again but I imagine food’s plentiful so why bother with one lucky shrimp in the ocean?

Remember this story. Maybe you like camping. Maybe you like leaving the noise of the city behind. Maybe you like long drives at night. Maybe you’ll think I’m a crazy nobody on the internet and I don’t care. I gave you the tools to defend yourself so what you do with this knowledge is up to you.

Until next time, stay safe.
