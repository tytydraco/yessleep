Last week, I ran away from home.

At my age, moving out would probably be a more acceptable term. But if you knew anything about my home life, you’d understand that running away is the correct one.

Either way, that’s not important right now. What matters is that I left with only a backpack, the clothes on my back and one extra change, a few days’ worth of food, my phone, and about a thousand dollars in savings, which I’d been quietly stealing from my parents over the past ten years.

And no plan whatsoever.

I hitchhiked to the nearest bus station and bought a ticket for the first bus leaving the state because I didn’t want to give my family enough time to realize that I was gone. When I arrived at my first destination, I took another bus. Then another. And another. Until, finally, I ended up in the middle of nowhere in a small town in Iowa with fewer than four hundred people and one rundown motel that, by some miracle, didn’t ask for an ID or a credit card.

Coming from an overly sheltered life, I had no idea how the real world worked. I still don’t. When I arrived, I thought a thousand dollars, now nine hundred and fifty after the bus fares, was a fortune. That illusion shattered the moment I had to pay for a full week in advance to make up for my lack of credentials.

I soon learned that freedom comes at a steep price, especially when you’re desperate. The man running the motel must’ve sensed it, because on top of the three hundred dollars for the week, he charged me an extra hundred “because you never know with these kids nowadays,” as he put it.

With only five hundred and fifty dollars left, I realized freedom was fleeting. I also realized I needed a job — fast.

And to make matters worse, three days ago, my food finally ran out. So I had no choice but to go to the nearby diner.

I’d never been to a diner before. But from what I’d seen on TV, I could tell that this one looked quite normal: checkered floors, red vinyl chairs, a boombox, and a blonde woman behind the counter refilling a man’s cup with what I believed to be tomato juice from a coffee pitcher.

It was early in the night, and the place was full of people eating and chatting, but all of that came to a stop when I walled in. The tension buildup was instant. Every pair of eyes was turned to me, and the man at the counter even licked his lips like a child presented with a piece of cake. 

I retreated slightly into myself, wishing I could disappear, until the voice of the blonde woman broke the silence. 

“Welcome, dear,” she said. “Sit down anywhere. I’ll be with you in a minute.”

I did what she said and glanced at the menu, trying to make sense of it. With items like ‘bloody scramble’, and ‘organ platter,’ its was hard to find anything that sounded remotely normal, or affordable. My eyes skimmed past ‘heart skewers’ and ‘raw oysters,’ before finally landing on the beef stew, which seemed like a safe choice. 

The waitress, Linda, approached me with a notepad in hand looking so exhausted that she looked like she was starting to blur a bit at the edges.  

“I’d order soon if I were you, darling,” she said, rubbing her temple. “My night girl just quit, and I’ve already worked a double. We’re closing early tonight.”

I perked up at that. 

“Oh no, that’s horrible!” I exclaimed, trying to sound sympathetic. “Does that mean you’re looking for someone to cover the night shift?” I asked, forcing a sweet smile.

The woman could see straight through my act, though. “This isn’t the job for you, dear. Trust me.” She muttered, a flash of worry in her eyes. “Now, can I get you anything, or not?”

“I can do it,” I insisted. “I’ve worked night shift at a diner before.” I smiled, and I hoped she wouldn’t see past my lie. 

She narrowed her eyes and glanced back at the clock behind the counter, and finally sighed in surrender. “If you’re serious, you’d save me a massive headache with my boss. Fine. You can stay. I’ll show you the ropes before I leave—but this is just a trial, understand?” Her tone softened slightly, guilt creeping in.

I nodded eagerly, already half-standing.

She shook her head. “You can still eat first, darling. Your shift doesn’t start till eight.”

And just like that, I had a job, temporary as it might be.

After dinner, Linda took me to the back, where I met Roger, the cook. 

Maybe I should’ve turned around then and there, but I believed Roger to be just a quirky man at first. And, as it may be obvious, I was also in dire need of a job. 

As soon as I walked into the cramped kitchen, the man stopped cooking. He stopped breathing. In fact, he stood deathly still for what felt like an eternity. It wasn’t until Linda introduced us to each other that Roger turned around. 

I forced a smile despite how uncomfortable the interaction had made me feel, and I waved with an expression I hoped came off as friendly. 

He didn’t wave back though. Instead, he stepped closer to me and began sniffing the air around me. I tried to get away from him, but Linda anticipated my actions and smacked the man on the back of the head. 

“Roger! Is that how you treat new coworkers?” Linda chided. 

He stumbled back, rubbing the back of his head. When he wasn’t sniffing me and acting like a pervert, he looked like a perfectly normal man in his late twenties. He didn’t say anything for a few seconds, and neither did I, but at least he had the decency to look apologetic. 

Linda sighed. “Roger, boy. Aren’t you going to apologize to Susan?”

“Sorry!” He exclaimed immediately, and the innocence with which he did it made me feel bad for him. He almost looked like a kicked puppy. “But—”

“Now,” the woman interrupted. “As I was saying before you started being rude. This is Susan, and she will be working the night shift with you tonight. Keep an eye on her, alright dear?”

“Yes, ma’am,” he nodded. 

“Good. Now come on, darling. I’ve got a uniform for you,” she said to me.

I did as she commanded. Linda led me to a small storage room located at the very end of the kitchen, and handed me a faded pink dress and a white apron with ruffles.

I put them on, feeling ridiculous, but the worst part was the hat. I couldn’t help but think that I looked a lot like a waitress from a cartoon. 

Still, as I caught my reflection in the small cracked mirror, I couldn’t help the faint smile tugging at my lips. For the first time, I felt like I was doing something on my own. Earning something. It felt like triumph. 

That brief spark of pride lasted exactly three minutes, though.

Out in the diner, the man who’d stared at me earlier tapped his cup against the counter in a crass attempt to get Linda’s attention. 

She sighed and reached for a pitcher, the one she was holding when I came in earlier. She bagan pouring the thick red liquid that at first glance I believed to be tomato juice. But now, standing close enough to smell the hot liquid, I caught the unmistakable metallic stench of blood. 

My throat went dry.

“This part’s easy, darling” Linda said in her usual cheery tone, as if she were teaching me how to brew coffee. She set the pitcher down on a heated rack beside five others I hadn’t noticed before. “You have to keep the pitchers on the warmer. Nobody likes room temperature blood. But do make sure it doesn’t get over 100 degrees. It starts tasting foul not too long after that. Now, they go in order: A+, A-, B+, B-, O+, O-, and if someone asks for AB, just do half and half. Easy, right?”

She turned and smiled at me, waiting for a response.

I just stared. “You—you’re kidding, right?”

“Don’t worry, dear, you’ll get the hang of it.” She moved on to the pastry shelf, still speaking like nothing was wrong. “We keep the blood bags in the back. Just pour a new one in when you run out. The type’s labeled, so you won’t mix them up.”

My stomach lurched, and the air suddenly felt too thick to breathe.

*What did I get myself into?* I thought, backing away under the amused gaze of the rude man at the counter.

Linda kept talking, her back still to me. “Now, all the pastries are labeled, so you just hand the right one to the customer, and since you said that you have experience I’m sure you can handle taking orders. Everything else works just like at any other din—” She turned around mid-sentence and stopped when she saw me edging toward the door.

For a moment, something like disappointment flickered across her face. Then she smiled again, softer now, almost pitying.

“You can walk out that door right now, Susan dear. I’m not keeping you here against your will,” she said, her voice calm. “But when you agreed to work here tonight, a promise was made. And we take promises very seriously.”

The sweetness in her tone soured into something sharp. “So you can stay and finish your shift, or you can leave and pray that nobody here heard you break your word.”

My hands started shaking, and the man—not a man?—at the counter was still looking at me like he was about to burst laughing any minute now. 

Linda placed her hands gently on my shoulders. “You’ll be safe here, as long as you do what you said you’d do, darling.” She smiled kindly again, and that felt like the most unsettling part of all. 

“Now—” she glanced at the clock, which marked eight o’clock—“I have to go. I can’t stay in this plane any longer, but I hope to see you when I come to relieve you at four.”

I blinked, not understanding.

She gave me a quick hug, then her edges began to blur again, followed by the rest of her until there was nothing left at all.

I stifled a scream, my head whipping around to see if anyone else had noticed that the woman standing in front of me had just disappeared. But, of course, everybody else was only focused on their own meals and their own conversations, paying no attention to what I now assumed to be a completely normal and usual occurrence. 

However, there was one person who was not minding their own business. The rude man at the counter, whose grin only widened even further when he felt my alarmed gaze. 

“Are you on the menu too, sweetheart?” He purred, barking a laugh at the sheer terror on my face. I felt my insides liquify for a second, and for a moment I my body became paralyzed with fear. The stranger rolled his eyes. “It’s no fun when you just freeze—“  he pouted. “Just get me another cup of O-. And do hurry up.”

I shuddered, but still did what he told me. 

My hands trembled as I reached for the pitcher. It felt warm in my hands, but that still did nothing to ease the shaking. I made my best effort not to look at the contents or even gag at the stench, as now that I knew what it really was it made my stomach churn uncontrollably. 

I focused solely on pouring the drink. Somehow, miraculously, not a single drop spilled. 

He snatched it off the counter before I could even set the pitcher down. The motion was so fast that it made me flinch, and the pitcher slipped from my hands. It shattered against the floor, splashing a deep, ugly crimson across the pristine white of my shoes.

I took a deep breath and stifled yet another scream. 

“Always so jumpy,” The man mocked. “To your last—” He paused, chuckling. “Sorry. To your first night.” He raised his glass in a mock toast and drained it in one long gulp.

I couldn’t stop staring at my shoes, and the deep red stain blooming across the floor. 

He tossed a stack of crumpled one-dollar bills onto the counter and stood. “Gotta go. See you later, Bloody.” He grinned again, winking. But this time, he made sure that I could see the unnaturally elongated canines sitting in his mouth. Making a show out of it just for his own amusement. 

When I finally dared to look up again, Roger was standing beside me with a mop and broom. I hadn’t even heard him come in.

“Don’t mind him. He’s always an asshole.” He gave me a light pat on the back, and I flinched so hard the mop handle clattered against the counter.

By then, I’d already realized that none of these people were human. The thought of one of them touching me made every nerve in my body recoil. The word predator echoed through my mind, over and over.

His expression softened and he took one step back. At least he didn’t seem offended—or pleased like the vampire   “It’s ok. Just go change. I’ll clean up here.”

I managed a shaky nod and stumbled toward the back room. Inside, I found another uniform in the same closet where I’d seen Linda go before. I changed quickly, though my fingers wouldn’t stop trembling, and by the time I worked up the courage to return, the floor was spotless, the air heavy with bleach, and Roger was calmly filling a new pitcher of O-.

“Thank you,” I managed to say, my voice barely a whisper. I was still terrified of the cook, but a part of me was profoundly relieved not to be alone. Also, he hadn’t really done anything to warrant my terror just yet.

Besides, we all know the saying. Better the devil you know than the angel you don’t. Not that I really knew Roger though. 

He glanced up to meet my gaze and gave me a small, reassuring smile. “You’ll get used to this in no time,” he said.

I wasn’t sure how confident I was in his statement, though. But I nodded regardless.

Still, as the night wore on, I did fall into a rhythm. A customer would come in, I’d take their order, and I’d try not to think too much about what they were. At first, I tried to guess based on what they ordered, but I quickly realized it was better not to know. It was better to treat them as If they were just human customers in a normal human diner. 

Not that it was easy. Especially when I found out that ‘heart skewers’ meant literal raw hearts on a skewer. At least they were squirrel hearts and not human. Still made me gag. 

By the time three a.m. came and nothing disastrous had happened, I started to relax. The end was finally in sight. Just one more hour, I told myself. One more hour, and I’d walk out of this nightmare. 

But fate had other plans. 

A few minutes before four, a new vampire walked in through the door. It was impossible to deny what he was while he was flashing those canines. 

“I thought this place would be closed tonight. I would’ve come earlier if I knew it wasn’t.” He said, a smug expression on his face. Then his eyes landed on me. “Well, well, well. What do we have here? A last-minute snack? Linda has more tricks up her sleeve than I imagined.

He took a step forward, but from the kitchen doorway came a low, warning growl. Suddenly, Roger grabbed me by the shoulder and shoved me into the kitchen.

“You’re not welcome here.” He kept growling, claws emerging from his nails. “And you already know that.

He threw his hands up. “Oh, come on!” He exclaimed. “She made a promise and then she broke it. You should really learn some things from me, wolfie. Promises are everything—not that you would know much about that. Now, just pour me a cup of AB+ and I’ll be on my way. Come on. I won’t even eat the new girl unless she lets me” He flashed me a teethed grin, making me shudder.

“That’s quite enough, Silas.”

Linda stood by the blood station, having simply appeared. I didn't have the energy to even flinch at it. “You know the rules. You prey on my staff, you lose your dining privileges. Permanently.”

The vampire, Silas, took a step back, his hands raised. “The last girl on night shift broke a promise, Linda. We all know how that goes,” he shrugged. “It’s quite simple, really—”

“It never is with you.” Her voice was flat. “Out. You and your kind are not very keen on consequences except for when they benefit you. Now they benefit me. Out right now.”

With a venomous glare Silas turned and went back out the door, slamming it against the frame. 

Linda’s shoulders slumped, the immense power draining from her as she turned to me. “Good job, dear. See? I would you it would be just fine.” She smiled with that sweet smile from before. “You did well. For a first night.”

“Can I go now?” I whispered, desperate to get out of there. 

“Sure, dear. Don’t you want to stay for breakfast, though?”

No. I didn’t. I didn’t need to be told twice. I didn’t even respond to her question. I just took the apron off and I ran out the door, intending to get my things and leave the dammed town behind. I didn’t even think about payment or how I would live after that. Only about survival. 

I was running so fast, my lungs burning in the cold air, that I didn't realize I wasn't alone until I hit a solid wall. Or what felt like a solid wall.

It was Silas.

His hands shot out, gripping my upper arms forcefully in order to hold me in place with effortless strength. I tried to struggle against his grip, but he was too strong. 

"Leaving so soon?" he purred, his voice a mockery of concern. "And without serving me my AB+? That's terribly poor form for a waitress.

I tried to struggle again, but it was like trying to move stone. "Let me go!"

"Tsk-tsk," he chided, his face inches from mine.

"We need to have a little chat about promises. You see, when you agreed to work the night shift at the diner, you entered into a spoken contract. An implicit promise to serve all the customers who walked through that door.” He began walking, forcing me backward with him, steering me effortlessly away from the main road and into the deep shadows between two darkened buildings.

"You might recall," he continued, "that I politely placed an order. And you refused to fulfill it.” He smiled maniacally. “You broke a promise and I am happy to make you pay for it.”

My back hit the cold brick wall of the alley. There was nowhere left to go. I remember having the distinct certainty that I was going to die without ever having lived a day in my life. 

"So you see, my dear," Silas whispered, one cold hand coming up to cradle my jaw, his thumb stroking my throat. "This isn't malice. This is simply accountability. A balancing of the scales. You owe us all debt, even if the losers at the diner don’t see it the same way I do.”

He pulled back just enough to look into my eyes, his own gleaming with a horrifying delight. He was savoring this, drawing out every second of my terror.

"Any last words?" he asked. His gaze dropped to the pulse hammering in my neck, and his canines began to elongate.

A screech erupted from my throat as blinding pain exploded in my neck. I tried to push him off me. I knew that I was going to die, but I wasn’t about to make it easy for him. 

I started to feel weak, drained. He was drinking from me in large gulps, all of which sent a wave of pain down my whole body. Then the pain got worse. 

Not because he became more forceful, but because he was torn off my neck. I could barely see through the tears. It was still dark and the haze brought on by pain, fear, and weakness made me believe that I was hallucinating. But it was real. 

Somebody—something—had slammed Silas’ body off mine, and they were fighting. I couldn’t see who was winning, or even who my savior was. Was it Roger? Linda?

It didn’t take long for me to find all of that out, because dawn was on the horizon. Through the first rays of sunlight of the day I could see the rude vampire from earlier pinning Silas to the ground. 

He lost his grip for a second, and Silas took that as an opportunity to leap back to me, shoving his fangs once more into my flesh, this time on my leg. The other vampire grabbed Silas again, tearing him off me and leaving me with an open wound from halfway up my calf to almost the top of my ankle. 

“Sire—” Silas started, but the rude customer picked him up by the collar and slammed him back to the ground. “I thought we’d discussed this, Silas. You weren’t supposed to draw more attention to us like this. Especially not after last night!” He roared. Silas tried to speak again, but his words died in his throat and were instead replaced by a screech of pain when his right arm was torn off the socket. 

I made a sound of pure terror, trying unsuccessfully to melt into the wall behind me. Unable to get up and run for my life. 

The man still standing placed a foot on Silas’ chest, and methodically started pulling at his left leg. Slowly and torturously until it also came off the vampire whining in agony. I couldn’t keep looking, too busy vomiting every last ounce of substance in my body. I closed my eyes, praying that death would take me before the rude customer could get to me himself. 

One more ripping sound followed by a scream let me know that his other leg had also come off. And finally, a second ripping sound followed by no noise. Only then I dared to open my eyes, and I was greeted by the sight of torn off limbs and a decapitated torso. 

I wanted to scream, but instead came out a pitying sound that I can’t even describe. 

Then his eyes turned to me. 

He took a single, slow step toward me and his shoes made a squelching sound in all the blood, both from mine and Silas’.

I made another pitiful, strangled noise. A sound I didn’t even know I could make. There was nowhere to run, and this vampire had proven to be worse than the last one. I briefly wished Silas had been the one to kill me—at least dismemberment hadn’t seemed to be a part of his modus operandi. But now I was trapped with the much more terrifying one. The vampire that sparked fear even in his own kind. 

He walks even closer, stopping right in front of my paralyzed body. His eyes started tracing the bloody mess Silas had made of my neck and leg. I kept crying as he wordlessly reached over to Silas’s body and wet his hands in his blood before smearing it on both wounds. 

A wave of shock coursed through me as the long gashes faded into smaller bite wounds, still bleeding and still painful, but nos as grave as before. 

A slow, dark smile spread on his face. "Looks like you really are on the menu after all, Bloody,” he said, and then he laughed. His fangs elongated as well, and I began whimpering again. But I didn’t have any more strength left to fight back. 

“Don’t worry,” he purred. “I’m not going to bleed you dry. That would be… wasteful. And now you owe me for saving your life. I plan on cashing in that debt in the future.”

He grabbed me by my hair and pulled my neck towards his mouth, lowering until his fangs tickled my raw flesh. 

“No. Please…” I whimpered. 

“Shhh…” he whispered against my neck, sending a shiver down my spine. 

He slowly pushed the fangs in, holding me steady with an iron clad grip. It hurt, a lot. But it wasn’t as forceful or as bad as Silas’ bite. Still I screamed, but it didn’t help ease the pain. 

Soon after a fog took over my mind and I must’ve passed out because the next thing I knew was that I woke up lying on the coarse carped of my motel room. In horrible pain and after over twenty four hours since my shift at the diner ended. 

My neck and my leg were bandaged, and that realization brought all the memories from that alley back like a tsunami. 

Through labored breathing, I got up and opened the door to the motel, intending to flee town as soon as possible. But my exit route was blocked. 

Sitting neatly on the worn welcome mat was a small cardboard box. On top of it lay a plain white envelope. I snatched it inside, and I locked the door again.

The envelope was heavy and when I opened it it contained four one hundred dollar bills and a note. 

*Dear Susan,*

*Roger went to see you this morning to give you your pay for last night, but he found you wounded on the floor.*

*He cleaned your wounds and I made him bring you some food for later. You’re going to need it. I hope the chicken soup helps you feel better.* 

*PD. If you still want the job, come by the diner whenever you want. I do still need a new night shift girl.  The pay remains the same, four hundred dollars per night.*  

*Love, Linda.* 

I stared at the money for a good few minutes before putting it with the rest. I made 400 dollars in one night. 

I’m more calm now, and I was able to think my escape plan through. 

The next bus out of town won’t be here for a few more days, and I definitely can’t escape on foot. This town is too far away from civilization. 

I still don’t know what Im going to do. For now I plan on staying in this room until I can actually leave. Roger has come over a few times, always with food from the diner, but I didn’t acknowledge him even once. 

All I want is to put this nightmare behind me. 

Especially the strange vampire that saved me. He says I owe him now, but I don’t think that I want to know what owing a vampire anything means. Maybe if I run, he won’t find me. 

I’m writing this as a warning for every single one of you out there. 

If you ever find yourself in a town in the middle of nowhere, do not go to the diner. 

And definitely [don’t make promises you can’t keep.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o7aeii/the_night_shift_at_the_diner_is_definitely_cursed/)
