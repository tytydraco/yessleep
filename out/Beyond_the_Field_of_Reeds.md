Contrary to popular belief, the gods don’t cease to exist when people forget about them. I am unsure why this idea has taken hold; you would think people would know that a true god is a creature of limitless power, and unending lifespan. But this is not to diminish what an awful fate for a god it is, to be abandoned in the great afterlife, to have nobody left, alive or dead, who will worship them.

I have seen this occur on many occasions, ever since I took an interest in foreign gods a few centuries after my own death. While I am thankful that our Egyptian gods have resisted such ignominy, and I should perhaps be heartened by the relative triumph of my own culture over others, there is still a sadness in this fate that has had me fascinated for thousands of years now.

My people, of course, discovered the ideal practises to ensure a long and happy afterlife. Mummification had its styles and trends, but we always understood the most important principles: leave things behind, and write down the names of the dead, everywhere that you can. Gods don’t disappear just because people forget about them, but the spirits of the dead are much more fragile. Try as we might, we humans are still mortal, and oblivion comes for us eventually.

The afterlife is full of Egyptians. Foreigners are rarer, but they do exist. They are the shades of all those who have remained in living memory. With my people, I discuss the present moreso than the past. We all lived in different worlds, with disparate politics and economic conditions, the subjects of different pharaohs over thousands of years. But the present world is something we all share. We talk of who found our bodies, and who is reading our names. The luckiest among us are the subjects of books and thesis projects; they are having their names written down even more times than before, glorifying them further, extending their time.

I am one of the many who is still in a drawer, locked in museum archives where curious children will never see my body. The museum is large, and sometimes I meet someone else who is at the same one. We compare drawers, to see how close to each other we are. Even far apart, we are still neighbours. We are not as famed as the term-paper mummies, but as long as there is a janitor who sweeps the floor in front of us, we need not fear fading away. It is, at least, a more secure situation than that of the ones still buried. 

The really famous mummies, the ones that fascinate the living scholars, have formed a clique all on their own, and they are nearly as exclusive as the actual royalty of Egypt, so I speak to them little. This, I do not mind; it is merely a continuation of the classes we occupied in life, with a few shifts here or there. I still believe in the virtues of humility, and of knowing one’s place. Besides, I need not want for companionship among the dead; I see many other women of a similar status as myself, and even a similar time.

While I can see the foreign dead, I do not know how they see me. Perhaps I am as I was when I died, old and without many teeth, or perhaps I am restored to my bloom of youth. Maybe they see not a woman but a bundle of bandages, smelling of tar and resin, or the dry and shrivelled form that lies beneath. I cannot say, but I know that they are usually unwilling to communicate with me. In my many years of death I have learned countless foreign languages, but some chasms are deeper than words can bridge. 

Even if real communication, like I have with my peers, is impossible, I am still always interested in the lives of foreign people. I suppose you could say I see them as the future of the afterlife, in some ways. Despite the ongoing fascination with Egypt, few real believers in our gods exist now, and those who do often cannot access the proper rites like we did. 

All the moderns who are remembered well appear here, but the more mundane among them often vanish. They enjoy the afterlife for a few centuries, repeating the joys of their lives just as we do ours, but eventually, there is nobody to repeat their names, nobody to study them, no climate controlled drawer to perpetuate the existence of their corpse. Then they are no more.

The modern dead still fall at the feet of their gods: Krishna, Guan Yin, and of course Allah. My own descendents dwell with Allah, though like others I have seen, I cannot speak to them. There are fewer and fewer different gods these days; the people are all consolidating. I remember when there were thousands of gods who still received new devotees here. Today, I doubt there are one hundred. The ones who appear in front of Hathor or Bastet rarely stay with them, as we do. They eventually drift away into the lands of those who have no gods, places which also get many more spirits than most of the gods I know. 

What happens in those places, I cannot say, for I struggle to spend time in them. We can travel to different places in the afterlife, but we are always stuck with our beliefs. I can see the powers of the foreign gods, but I will never feel for them the way I feel for Bastet. I cannot form relationships with them; it would be even more impossible than it is for me to consult with their worshippers. I had always believed I would be forever youthful here, but I fear that because the others do not, they can only see me as my corpse.

Still, I like to watch what happens to the foreign gods, especially those who, like ours, are very, very old. There is one I have been watching for a few hundred years now, and her realm is only declining with time. When I died, her rule was somewhat small, but respectable, and it seemed very ordinary. But her followers keep disappearing. People are forgetting they existed.

It is not only a name that will suffice, though a true name is the very best to sustain you. As long as people feel the evidence of your life, they know some story about you, repeat a joke you told, or carry a family name that once was yours, you will take some form here, even if it may be a more fleeting or flickering one. There are still some who are very old, some who are recalled in some tradition or revived in some seance of the mind, even though their true names are deceased. It is shades of this kind who I have seen celebrating the goddess of the acorns.

I do not know her true name, or the name of the people who worshipped her. Both the goddess and her people come from a place far away, one which no Egyptian ever visited or even imagined until millennia after my time; I cannot hope to really understand them. The forms of her followers are blurry and vague to me now, but they were not always this way. I know how they are supposed to look. Their place is hot, and therefore  they have little need of clothing, aside from beautification. I used to see them in woven sandals and thin sashes made of bark. They wore tattoos upon their faces, and jewelleries made of seashells. There is water there, and the air smells of salt always. It is not like the Nile.

Their goddess carries a mortar and pestle, and she sits around an acorn tree, which drops its bounty onto the lands below her and sustains her followers. Or at least, it used to. Every time I visit her lands in the afterlife, I see more and more acorns on the ground, unharvested. Along the horizons, there are ever fewer of her people’s homes, and I hear fewer of their songs, and the songs of the birds they kept for pets, just like the Romans did. Now, this time, I go, and I see but one woman, who is old and bowed with age. She mutters words I cannot fully hear, and I fear that she, too, is fading. 

I do not know what the gods think, not even my own gods who I can somewhat understand. But I still wonder, whenever I come here, how the goddess of the acorns feels. I look to her, head turned downward in contemplation of her tools, as inscrutable as it has ever been. She is the same. When I look back to her last follower, I find that she is gone, as though she were a trick of the light, teasing the corner of my eye. She might finally be gone.

Somewhere, over the horizon, there comes a shout. There is more than one voice. What they say, I know not, but I can hear the relief in their voices, the happy shock of those who are newly dead. They come forward, their shades clear and bright to my vision. The people are covered, bedecked in very fine shell jewellery, wearing it in their nostrils and their earlobes. In life, they must have been rich, or as rich as their land’s resources could make anyone. But they still gaze in wonder at the ground, marvelling at how many acorns there are. Who has not died and felt wonder at the pleasures of the afterlife?

Just looking at them, I know that it must have been that jewellery that rescued them. The only way that these ancient people could return is if they were discovered, dug up by people who would not have known them otherwise. Just like myself, and so many other Egyptians, they must have gone from bones forgotten to the find of somebody’s career. Somewhere, in this land they called home, there were moderns, deeply occupied in contemplation of their distant lives. 

I have realised that for every god, and for every human being who once lived, there is always a hope of re-discovery. I take heart in knowing that even if I am someday released from my drawer, my body and amulets lost or destroyed, I might return again someday, as long as someone thinks of me.
