The legend was always that if you descended into the valley, the odds of ever coming back out were slimmer than the chance of being hit by lightning or winning the lottery. My grandpa was a war hero, eighty years old, tough as nails. Tougher than nails, in fact. He never told me what happened to him in that valley in the winter of 1972, it was the one thing he never talked about. That’s fine, I found out what’s in there myself. I see why he never talked about it.

Snow had not yet fallen in the valley, though it certainly was cold enough. My deer stand was on the top of one ridge, and I had another on the top of the ridge on the other side of the valley. To get to it, I would have to climb down into it, trek across it, and climb up the other ridge. I had done it a couple times, so it wasn’t impossible. I had left my watch at home, so I estimated that it was maybe four or five in the afternoon. The sun was already just starting to set. The hike would probably take two, maybe three hours, and I could just camp in the stand if it got too dark. 

I got to the bottom of the valley without any issues. But the thing about the valley is that it casts a dark shadow over the entire landscape below. It’s dark enough where you almost need a flashlight just to see something, especially on the trail. A good portion of the valley was field, though. I knew that because the trail typically went across the woods to the narrow pass between the mountains that would allow me to get to the next stand. Basically, I was never supposed to end up in a field, but I did.

I figured that the pass would only be a mine or two across the forest, so I decided to try and make the trek. The issue was, like I said, I practically needed a flashlight just to see during the day. The setting sun made it even more difficult, so I made the decision to return to the field and look for another way up the mountain. But sitting squarely in the field, right up against the edge of a large rock face, was a cabin. 

“Perfect,” I thought, “I’ll just ask for directions.” If they had settled here, then they must know their way around, right?

The issue was when I approached the cabin, I saw that it clearly was in absolutely no shape to house anyone. The wood was dry, grey, rough, and blooming with lichen. Some of the boards had pretty wide gaps between them. The front porch was unstable, the door was crooked, and the only window was so cracked you could hardly see through it. If anyone lived here, I truly did feel bad for them, because winter was soon coming and they would almost certainly freeze to death in the frigid Appalachian winter. I climbed the stairs onto the porch, where I noticed that not a single board was actually nailed down. The very floor beneath me seemed to shift with each step I took.

When I got to the door, I knocked hard. When nobody answered, I practically had to force it open. Then I decided to leave my rifle against the door. I figured I wouldn't look good if I barged into his house with a gun.  But when I stepped inside I knew immediately that nobody possibly could have lived there.

There was no kitchen, no sink, no outlets, no refrigerator, and it just barely had something resembling a chair and a table. It was absolutely freezing cold inside the cabin. In the far corner was a bathtub, filled with muddy brown water that had a reddish-orange tint to it, like rust or something. It was starting to freeze over. 

There was no bookshelf or anything like that, just an old bible sitting on the table. I grabbed it and began flipping through it. I landed on the verse that read “though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil”. I always liked that one. In fact, growing up in church, it was my favorite one. 

When I looked up, I saw a door. It was the only door in the entire cabin. I walked towards it slowly, the bible still open in my hand. I snapped it shut as I grabbed the doorknop and opened it. It was a small bedroom, with a large bed taking up most of the room. The bed was stuffed with hay, and some of it was poking out. The pillows were stuffed with feathers. There was a thick grey wool blanket thrown on the bed.  On the nightstand was a lamp that upon closer inspection I found had no actual light bulb in it. It also wasn’t actually plugged into anything. I gently set the Bible on the floor next to the bed and pulled back the covers.

Underneath were human remains, a skeleton mostly. Not much was left, say for a skull, some pieces of spine, a couple ribs, well, you get the idea. I felt sick to my stomach and immediately turned around the throw up all over the floor. I hastily turned to leave, using my hand to block my view of the bed as I did so. But when I got out, and I was standing in the doorway looking out at the cabin, I saw something start to stand up from the corner, under a pile of rubble. It was tall, I know that, with limbs that looked more cosmetic than flesh and blood.

 It was only just starting to arise and it hadn’t turned around yet when I hit the deck like I was being shot at, low crawling into the bedroom and kicking the door closed. I went to the only place I feasibly could have: Under the bed. It was tight, and it reminded me of all those internet stories and pictures of people spelunking. I scooped up the Bible from the floor and hugged it close. Hot tears ran down my face and I realized I was totally defenseless. My gun was sitting outside. And sure enough, the door began to open. 

I saw its feet first, they were grey and looked like they were in late stages of frostbite, only they seemed to be able to move just fine. Its five toes were long and its toenails were yellow, and they clacked against the floor since they were so overgrown. Its hands came next, and I realized that it walked on all fours. When its hands hit the floor it made a loud thud that made me jump slightly, I whimpered, and had to shove my fist in my mouth to keep from making a noise.

When I whimpered, just once, it stopped moving. Stopped breathing, stopped everything. In that second I realized that I could not make a sound. I was stuck. It almost felt, in a weird way, like I was in a coma. Even though I’ve never been in a coma, I imagine that that’s a pretty similar feeling.

Its hands were like its feet. I think the worst part was that it didn’t have claws or anything like that, it just had regular, normal, overgrown fingernails. It seemed to scamper on all fours until it put its hands on the bed and seemed to lean on it. I know because the weight of the thing compressed the bed and made it almost difficult to breathe. I was terrified that it would realize something was under the bed, or that I would squirm or let out a noise or something, and it would flip the bed and see me. 

It must have picked up a bone, because I heard a gnawing sound. It growled as it chewed, like a dog. But when the bone audibly crunched, and one half of a rib fell onto the floor and rolled under the bed. I shut my eyes, as hard as I possibly could. I couldn’t cover my ears, in part because the bed was too tight but also because I didn’t dare to move.  When something thudded, I opened my eyes. The skull had rolled off, and a piece broke off when it slammed against the floor. I almost screamed when it looked at me. It rolled on its side and the empty eye sockets met mine. I was horrified, and I bit down on my fist so hard that it started bleeding. I kept repeating that Bible verse in my head.

I shall fear no evil,
I shall fear no evil,
I shall fear no evil,

When the thing was finally done it slammed its hands back to the floor, crushing the skull as it did so. I jumped again and closed my eyes. I only heard it slowly putter around the room, and when I opened my eyes I saw it was sitting. Not like a person should, but like a cat might sit. Its legs were bent at horrible angles, its hands were planted firmly to the ground. It was panting. I still could only see a little bit of it, and I couldn’t see its face, not that I wanted to. 

Then something happened. It got on the bed above me. The bed was pretty long, and I was curled up at the far end, and my back was flat against the wall. Then the thing got on the bed, it sat in the middle of the bed and caused it to sag down. It creaked loudly. Then, the bed snapped. It broke in half in the middle where it had sat. Hay and straw flew everywhere, and both it and myself yelped. The half of the bed that I was under slid down on top of me as the straw from the mattress spilled out. I could hear the bones rolling across the floor. Now I wasn’t worried about being quiet, because that thing certainly wasn’t.

I could hear it screeching and yelling as it thrashed through the hay and wood splinters, throwing them against the wall. Hay was flying everywhere. A piece of wood got thrown so hard that it cracked the wall. It started pounding on the floor. It grabbed the half of the bed that was on top of it and lifted it up, causing the rest of the hay to all fall on me. I buried myself in the hay quickly, letting it pile and hide me. I closed my eyes, and prayed. When the noises stopped and all that was left was heavy breathing, I kept praying. It picked up one half of the bed and lazily threw it on top of the hay pile as it grunted. I stifled back a pained yelp as it trotted out of the room, still panting, still on all fours. 

The next while was a complete blur. I remember the pain from thirst and hunger, the cold, and what I assumed was the first real snowfall in the valley. Drifts of snow found their way into the room and just made it colder. I assume the door was open, since I could hear wind howling outside and snow piling up in the main room. I just kept falling asleep, waking up, and trying to fall back asleep to distract myself. I was so scared to move, the pain in  my legs from being in a fetal position didn’t bother me. The weight of the bed was heavy, but I got used to breathing shallowly. I didn’t know if that thing was still out there in the house or what, but I was so paralyzed with fear that I refused to move at all. That’s the thing about this, the fear didn’t go away after awhile. I never settled into a routine. I just kept shivering, and being terrified.

Eventually, when the snow had stopped I heard something walking around the house. Heavy steps. When the door opened, I tensed and my eyes widened. When the bed moved and the hay was brushed off, I screamed and covered my head with my hands.

Two other deputies stormed into the room with their guns up, but the sheriff motioned for them to lower them. They led me out of the house wrapped in a blanket. Apparently, I was very pale. I kept frantically looking around as they questioned me, looking for it. They asked me questions, wanting to know what happened, why I was there, etcetera etcetera. Apparently, I had been missing for two days. 72 hours later, I was sent home, determined to be just fine.

I am a very religious man, and I don’t doubt that god saved my life in that valley. I don’t know how, I don’t think I want to know. That verse I remembered, the valley of the shadow of death, stuck with me. I named the valley after it. Nobody ever really went down there before, and nobody ever really goes down there after. If I’m in the stand and I see a deer, and it bolts into the valley before I can shoot, I accept it as a loss. The shadow over the valley is perpetual and almost permanent. In the winter, the snow looks grey because of it. In the summer, it still looks dark and forbidding. But then again, it always has. 

But I know that valley holds two things: God, and something else.
