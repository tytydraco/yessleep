Orange narcotic strips and pink cotton candy clouds filled the sky. Two lovers sat on a bench, shared laughs and wondered about a life together forever. Children played in parks and drew chalk animals on concrete.

Summer’s end neared. Society and life would change forever. People would meet their dead relatives again. Moments later, millions of bright stars bloomed across the sky—the rapture, or a miracle from God? The small spheres materialized into existence as if by the flip of a switch, oblivious to any and all effects against humanity. The daytime stars exploded into an orange-purple dust—a silent process save for the distant boom at the end.

A blanket of strong light covered the sky. People took shelter or averted their gaze. Nations didn’t know how to react, except for the 999 witnesses of the entire event. Gathered as one big family, those people opened a church and streamed weekly masses online. The first man to see the full explosions became the leader. Nathaniel Sullivan, once a plumber, rose to fame as the number one televangelist in the world.

Three weeks after the event, dubbed The Bloom, the 999 announced Ambrosia, a miracle medicine.

“Dearest people of this world! Do not be afraid and have faith! Do you miss your dear family and friends who’ve passed away? Do you want to see them again? Ambrosia is the way; Ambrosia is the light!” Nathan Sullivan preached live on air.

The preacher said the 999 conducted internal tests. If it all went well, Sullivan would see his wife and daughter again. The man ingested Ambrosia. His body tensed and jerked on the leather chair. His pupils dilated to an abnormal size. The reverend calmed down moments after and fixated the camera with bloodshot eyes. Tears ran down his cheeks, and white thin lines brought back memories from the past.

After a few seconds passed, the image changed to static. Reverend Sullivan kneeled before only what he could have seen. The man stared at a fixed point in the room with hands clenched together. More tears streamed down his cheeks, and his lower lip trembled.

“I’m sorry. Please forgive me. I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” he said with arms extended, waiting for a long hug that never came.

“Daddy, come to us,” a boy’s voice whispered from a distant place. Devoid of life, it gurgled; water stuck in its throat. Yet, Nathaniel Sullivan’s eyes could not have betrayed him.

“I am. Right now,” Nathaniel Sullivan said. A concrete certainty washed over the man’s mind and body, and immense joy filled his broken heart.

Reverend Sullivan scanned the room and stared in confusion at every person in the room. The preacher moved with slow steps toward the large window and jumped from the 10th story of the sect’s church. A large crowd gathered around the mangled body. People touched the corpse as if Nathaniel Sullivan was a miracle man, a saint, a messiah sent by God to heal the entire world, end wars, eradicate famine, destroy addiction and bring closure to grieving families.

Several reruns of the incident reported no faces in the static. Social media platforms dissected the situation from one end to the other. Millions of people reported seeing the woman and boy in the static if only for a moment. Online and televised hysteria engulfed humanity’s hive mind. The sect announced a two-hour break to assess the situation. The next livestream’s numbers exceeded the first with a peak audience of 750 million people.

The doomsday cult had elected a new female leader. The live feed showed the woman in the middle of over a hundred members standing on the edge of the roof. Each pair of teary eyes studied the horizon. The preacher swallowed the Ambrosia pill first, and the rest followed suit. Seconds after, like death dominos, all the members leaped. The world heard continuous thumps and splashes, a grotesque symphony of broken bones and sinew.

Formal accusations could not be brought to what remains of the sect. All people who committed suicide did so out of free will. The remainder of the sect grew more powerful. Influential people across the world infiltrated it and the new religion became the fastest growing in history.

Ambrosia too became the fastest selling drug in the world. Entire families wanted to see deceased relatives or friends; parents forced kids to ingest the drug because grandparents waited to meet on the other side. Others only chased the high or wanted to see if the drug worked as advertised.

The sect’s shadow leaders, the people behind the curtain, spoke through government representatives or powerful media figures about the drug. The short press release read: The 999 is aware Ambrosia might be perceived as unethical, but it is a product like any other. The free-market dictates supply and demand, and no one is forced to buy it. The miracle pill has immediate and permanent effects, and we understand that. But one should look at this from another perspective: it brings closure to the end-user and allows for a final meeting with loved ones.

Priced at only $9.99/pill, the sect tailored Ambrosia for all budgets—over 100 million doses sold in the first day. People walked out of drug stores, grocery stores, markets and malls smiling and excited to see people long gone. With a 100% success rate, Ambrosia delivered on its promise: just one more moment of happiness.

News reports became hard to read or listen to. Corpses piled high, and graveyards hit maximum capacity, open fields the same. Crematories have become one of the most profitable businesses in the world.

Salmon pink and lavender purple skies blessed people’s sights with a sense of false serenity. Post-explosion Bloom dust still hung in the air, like ashes of a thousand-year burning flame, recently extinguished. People breathed in colored glitter, a disease of alien origin.

Police officer Robert Newson despised the new reality and hated to see people rushing to their deaths.

“Listen to that, Bob. They’re boasting about numbers again. This goddamn news makes me sick,” his best friend Vince said. “Damn, what this world has come to.”

“Screw them, man. It’s damaged way beyond repair. Heard the reported number of suicides now caps at 1.5 billion, but who knows the real numbers?”

“Yeah, it’s crazy. What frightens me most is that society acts like it’s normal. The sects sell Ambrosia like lollipops, and no one does anything. It’s all a gigantic mass depopulation plan. Fewer people means they’re easier to control and lie to.”

After paying the check at the diner, the men headed out for a walk and met a family. The mother, father and daughter hung from a branch of the oldest oak in town. The suicides had taken places just moments before.

“Jesus Christ, why? Why would you do this? You killed what most people would kill for,” Robert shouted at the dead parents.

The police officer thought about his wife’s and daughter’s funeral. Both stood silent, still and lifeless. A drunk driver had hit their car three years back—full frontal collision. The drunkard had fled the scene, unscathed and never to be seen again. Vince put a hand on Robert’s shoulder, removed his cap and didn’t say a word. Both knew prayers would not bring back the dead—no matter how much love existed in the world.

Society went through drastic changes. People had learned to adapt to a more gruesome reality, and to live under different circumstances and new laws. Robert Newson’s job almost became obsolete. Most people couldn’t be saved. World governments forbade police forces to intervene in cases of suicide.

A man stood in a pool of blood on a front porch with long slits on his forearms. Death embraced people with loving and cold arms and never let go.

“Will this insanity ever end, Vince?”

“As long as there’s demand for that stuff, I don’t think it will.”

Robert and Vince reminisced about the good, old days—family visits, kids playing, wives laughing, eating delicious barbecues and cracking open cold ones. Good years had gone by, and the world had morphed into a living hell.

The two best friends reached the woods at the edge of the city and walked on the trail towards the lake. Over a dozen bodies floated face down on the silvery surface. Death had become the number one pollution factor worldwide. The men stood frozen with mouths wide open.

“Jesus Christ. I just don’t understand how any of this works anymore,” Robert said.

“Let’s… Let’s just head back to my place and crash on the couch.”

Vince grabbed the remote control and flipped through the TV channels.

“A pilot crashed a plane in Romania, all 125 passengers dead.”

“A new wave of mass suicides in Japan. 85 people plunged to their deaths in Tokyo, 64 in Yokohama, 36 in Nagoya.”

“45 people at an Anti-Ambrosia protest sliced their throats open with a box-cutter.”

“A New-York man allegedly ingested Ambrosia and is still alive,” the news lady said, “and our colleague is right there with him setting up for a live interview.”

Robert and Vince looked at each other in disbelief. Could such a thing even be possible?

Jim Marshall, a blue-collar worker, had bloodshot eyes and cracked lips. The first and only known Ambrosia survivor’s face showed signs of seeing unfathomable beasts. The man rocked back and forth in the armchair.

“So, Mr. Marshall, could you tell us about your experience with Ambrosia?” the interviewer asked. “I’m sure our viewers at home want to know all the details.”

“Nothing is real. Ambrosia brings only madness and death. It’s a mere gateway. After swallowing it, the creatures appear in your mind before death. The aliens came with the Bloom and are living in the dust poisoning humanity’s lungs,” Jim rambled. “When the hallucination begins, the beings are friendly and make you see beautiful false things. It’s all a rapid succession of events— until the creatures kill you.

“So, it’s all a big lie?”

“The Bloom means rapture. Humanity’s days are numbered. It’s only one big world government now. The news is all lies. How else would an event of such magnitude have been possible?”

“What do the aliens look like, Mr. Marshall?”

“Indescribable appearance. I saw foggy shadows over fifteen feet tall. Maybe it’s the reason I survived; you know? Maybe the connection severed before I could see the aliens. Afterwards, I just came back to life, so to speak.”

At home, the two best friends’ eyes were glued to the screen.

“So, how exactly did you try doing it? Sorry if it’s personal and you can choose not to answer, but it would be best if the public knows more?”

“No problem, I’ll answer. Sleeping pills. Ten times the recommended dose—laid in bed and went to sleep in the bedroom. I wanted to see my mother again and like violent endings are not my thing.”

“Phew, might as well call you a miracle, Mr. Marshall. You’re one lucky man, I’ll give you that.”

“Probably, not sure. Look, sir, I’m just an average Joe. I don’t want to be a star or anything. The truth is all that matters.”

“If you’re telling the truth as it is, then why do they let you do it?”

“I don’t know, really. Maybe people watching will think I’m crazy?”

“Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us, Mr. Marshall.”

“Thanks for believing me.”

Robert and Vince agreed that Marshall told the truth. The survivor’s body language suggested it.

The men sat in silence on the couch—both trying to assimilate Marshall’s story. What would it have taken to make the world a safer place again if not a revolution? The idea had cemented itself in Robert’s mind. But what would be cost have been? How many people would have died if a war was to break loose?

Those thoughts dissipated when Vince’s phone rang. His wife Jessica had picked up their daughter Rebecca from school. No suicides happened that day, thank goodness.

The next day, the media tore apart the survivor—a liar, cheat, fraud, an insane person chasing his fifteen minutes of fame. In the afternoon, a woman called 911 and reported finding Marshall’s corpse inside a dumpster with a red plastic cord around his neck. On the desk in his living room, police found a note saying: “I wanted to be famous for a little while. Ambrosia works 100%.”

Robert Newson’s jaw dropped. The police officer called Vince right away.

“Seen the news?”

“Yeah, it’s… it’s very strange.”

“Strange? Vince, it’s right there, man. The aliens killed Marshall for speaking up against this global propaganda. It’s an assassination. We’ll talk more about it after work.”

Robert Newson got in the cruiser and drove to the station. The purple-orange dust in the air had a heavy miasma of rotting flesh and boiling blood. A strong migraine wrapped around his skull like a strong iron vise—first one in over fifteen years. The possibility of leaving town and going into hiding took shape in the police officer’s mind. Vince had a cabin two towns east of the mountains, buried deep within the woods. The men would bring as many supplies as possible and would venture into town at night disguised with fake beards and glasses to shop for necessities.

The sheriff had arrived already, a not-so-regular thing.

“Ah, morning, Bob. Feeling alright? Your face’s all pale.”

“Morning, boss. Yeah, just a headache.”

“Come to my office for a few minutes? I want you to meet a fine gentleman.”

A man stood on the couch with a cigarette in the corner of his mouth—tall, thin, dressed in a black suit and wearing sunglasses. The individual had skin as white as chalk and emanated an odor that made Robert Newson cringe.

One of the 999, Zachariah Redmond, made visits to various cities and towns in search of new members. Sheriff Willoughby introduced Robert, stating he’d be a fine addition to the team. Robert’s knees turned to rubber upon the realization that the enemy sat a few feet away. The sectarian nodded and asked for more coffee. Willoughby executed the order and filled the thin man’s cup.

“That’s enough, Willoughby! How much coffee do you think I drink? Sit down and let’s hurry. I have places to be, people to meet, and important things to do.”

“Right, sir. Sorry, sir.”

Robert couldn’t believe his eyes. Redmond pulled Willoughby’s strings as he wanted—a circus freakshow where the puppet did the puppeteer’s bidding.

“As I was saying, Willoughby. We had to dispose of Jim Marshall yesterday. The man was too much of a liability for the ecosystem. There are more like him, people who stay hidden and try to form resistance groups—a rebellion against the new system. The 999 will take care of any threat, don’t worry. Anyway, you’re telling me you and your guys can help push up the sales here in your area?”

Redmond laid out the operation plan. Willoughby’s team had to bring down the population from 2000 people to 500. The crazies, the junkies, the homeless and those above 75 years of age had to go first—the most vulnerable ones. The 999 would provide Ambrosia stock for free. Each member of Willoughby’s team would be compensated with $1.5 million dollars per 500 people who turned the lights off. The society would also do no harm to team members and families.

Robert’s migraine worsened. The sect demanded sacrifice, a harvest of souls, and death of the innocent. The 999 marched across America wearing business suits and combat boots, speeding up the apocalypse. The police officer knew the sectarians had set the gears in motion—such a plan could never be stopped. Insanity ate the sheriff’s mind, and the Bloom dust poisoned his lungs.

“That’s what I call an honest deal, Mr. Redmond! Glad to be of service!” the sheriff exclaimed.

“I’ll make the deal even better, Willoughby. If all goes well, our society would be more than happy to let the team join our ranks. Things have changed since the Sullivan events. I think those inside the society might be able to wait a bit longer to see dead family and friends. Now, if that is all, I’ll be on my way. On to the next city. There’s more work to be done. Be seeing you.” Redmond said.

The flesh on the sectarian’s neck moved as if tiny worms lived under it. Purple and orange stars flashed before Robert’s eyes. A slight dizziness brought a loss of balance in his legs for a moment. Luckily, the sectarian and sheriff didn’t see it.

“Mr. Redmond, can I ask you a question? What Jim Marshall said, is it all true? Do aliens walk among us now?” Robert asked.

“Yes. The creatures live in the dust sheltered from the human eye. Millions of them came here with the Bloom. This race of aliens wants to wipe out as much of humanity as possible, but the 999 managed to get a great deal done. The brilliant beings rule the earth now, and humans must obey. I think they’re doing us a favor—people get to see dead daughters, sons, mothers, fathers, and best friends one more time. With a leap into the unknown, users of Ambrosia can make it happen. It’s poetic and beautiful—a story with a happy ending,” Redmond replied.

“Thank you, Mr. Redmond. Just wanted to get my information first-hand from a trustworthy source,” Robert said. “What about establishing communication with the aliens? How did it happen?”

“We… managed to establish communication right after the event. The orange and purple dust particles swayed in the wind. Humans heard whispers in the air. The aliens have an intellect we cannot fathom to understand. They learned all languages in seconds. It’s impossible to describe the beings, but imagine a tall, thin figure made of light—weightless, floating around, moving in the air like embers from a fire,” Redmond said.

“I understand, sir.” Robert replied.

“Have you ever thought about taking Ambrosia, Mr. Newson? Yours is a tragic and gut-wrenching story, to say the least. I can’t even begin to understand how you must feel. If I remember things right, authorities never caught the drunk driver?”

“No, not once, sir. And they didn’t catch him, no.”

The police officer knew the drunk driver’s whereabouts —burial place, day and time of death, and type of gun used for the murder; a heavy burden Robert would have to carry forever.

“A strong man you are, Mr. Newson. It’s good you didn’t do it; the 999 needs you. Sheriff, the mayor’s on board too. I expect to hear good news in thirty days, yes?”

“Yes, sir. Absolutely.”

“Don’t disappoint us,” Redmond said.

The peculiar said goodbye and stormed out of the office. Robert peaked through the blinders to see a black sedan waiting outside the station. The driver’s face twitched as if the skin didn’t feel comfortable in its own body anymore.

“Why’d you ask him that, Robert?”

“Just curious is all. Listen, can I take the rest of the day off? My head’s killing me. I think I also have the goddamn stomach flu too.

“Go home and rest but be here first thing in the morning. Don’t be late. We have work to do. Sorry I surprised you like that, but I just knew I could count on you. We’ll stay safe and get rich. What more can you wish for in crazy times like these? Am I right?”

“You sure are, boss. I’m heading out.”

Robert got in his cruiser and went straight to Vince’s construction site. The police officer went inside his friend’s office; he was on the phone talking about a shipment of supplies for the company. The two best friends spoke about the encounter with Redmond, the plan the sect had for the town and the escape plan.

“Are you one hundred percent sure about this, Bob?”

“I couldn’t have made this all up. That man wasn’t right, if he was a man. I don’t know anything anymore. The whole world is burning. God damn it, this migraine is killing me, I feel like my head’s going to explode.”

Vince opened a desk drawer, took out a painkiller and gave it to Robert with a glass of water.

“Here, man. Take this and feel better.”

“Thanks, brother.”

“Go home, Robert. I’ll call my wife to pick up our daughter from school, and I’ll go load up the car. Then we’ll come to get you, alright?

“Since when do you call me Robert, dude? But yeah, sounds good. See you in a few.”

Robert packed clothes in a suitcase, put canned goods in a bag, dug up a stashed survival kit and grabbed his hunting rifle. The headache had not subsided—only worsened. A throbbing pain pulsated across his skull. The toxic air made breathing hard. He sat on the couch; his head tilted back, and sleep came easy. Purple and orange streaks adorned the skies in his dream.

“Daddy. Come here to us. We miss you,” his daughter, Julia, said from a distant place.

“Robert, I love you. We’re waiting for you,” his wife, Melanie, said.

Longing, relief and happiness overcame Robert Newson—a long gone family together once more. The man could breathe again; the headache vanished. The police officer wanted to see his girls again so badly. And with all the insanity in the world, it felt like the right decision—three souls blessed with purple-orange happiness once more.

“There’s nothing left for you there, my love. Only sadness and despair.”

The old world is gone, Robert whispered.

“Dad, we need you here. You won’t be lonely anymore. Please, come.”

Tears of joy streamed down Robert Newson’s face. Peace, and tranquility at last. His daughter came closer, her big blue eyes and blond hair sharpening into focus, a glowing halo surrounding her body—an angel made of light.

“Come on, dad. Take my hand and let’s go, please. You’re the only one missing.”

Robert Newson didn’t hesitate and wished for this sadness to end. The police officer’s mind exploded into a glowing purple and orange light.

His head tilted forward and fell on the cold rifle barrel.

“At last, I am at peace,” Robert thought.

With eyes closed, the man [smiled](https://www.reddit.com/r/PostMortem33/comments/13ehusx/nosleep_award_winning_stories/).
