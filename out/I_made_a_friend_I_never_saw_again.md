On August 26, 2013, I met a
very kind girl. Her name
was Ryan. We met in class
and started bonding over
movies we liked. Her
favorite was The Shining.
She wanted me to come
over to her house and
watch it with her after
school.

She had a very nice
beautiful victorian style
house. It was very clean.
She liked keeping the lights
off though. At first I wasn't
too bothered, I am
someone who's scared of
the dark but since it was
still daytime light would
shine through.
But she drew the blinds.
She liked having it as dark
as possible. I felt scared,
but it was her house so l
wasn't going to ask
otherwise.

We watched the movie,
which was fine, Ive seen it
a few times before and I
liked it myself so I didn't
really get scared from the
movie. Occasionally
though, I would look over at
Ryan. She would be staring
at the TV blankly. She
wasn't smiling or reacting
at all, which I found weird
since she seemed to really
love this movie.

At one point I couldn't help
but notice how blank her
eyes were. Not in the blank
stare kind of way. The light
was gone from her eyes,
they looked so dull. She
looked over at me
eventually, and we met
each other's glances. I was
expecting her to ask if I was
enjoying the movie or
something, but she said
nothing. She just stared at
me. She then looked
behind me at the stairway. I
looked too, but I didn't
really see anything she
would have been looking
at. When I looked back, she
was watching the movie
again. But I noticed her face
looked pale, even her lips. It
was like all the blood had
left her skin. I was starting
to get uneasy now. Just as I
was about to see myself
out, she got up and walked
over to the staircase and
went upstairs.

I was very ready to leave,
but being a kid I was
curious too. I followed her,
but it was like she had just
disappeared. I figured she
was just a fast walker so l
tried going into the rooms
to find her bedroom. All of
the doors were locked. I
wandered through the
halls, and it was all the
same, locked doors. I
couldn't find Ryan. I don't
know where she could have
gone, since I didn't hear her
walk back down the stairs.
She could have gone into
her room and locked the
doors, but I'm not sure how
she would have gotten in if
the doors in the house were
all locked.

I did end up leaving, That
night I had a dream. Ryan
was at my window, just
standing there and staring
at me with the blank stare
and her pale face. I tried
opening the window, but it
was locked despite it being
completely unlatched.

When I went to school the
next day, Ryan wasn't there.
l asked my teacher if he
knew if she was okay. He
told me we didn't have a
Ryan in our class, the only
Ryan they had passed away
23 years ago from the
hands of her parents.

When I went to go to her
house after school, I was
met with a clean vacant lot.
There was no leftover
debris or any sign there
was a house there at all. I
never saw Ryan again.
