on Tuesday,i woke up with a smile on my face because today is the day i get interviewed for a job at a convenience store near the beautiful wilderness.Unfortunately the store is not in the city but outside the city in a rural town named vacuity.It’s will be a struggle to get there because i currently don’t have a vehicle but i will make it work somehow.

Leaving the house quickly i ventured to the bus stop and hopped on the bus towards vacuity.1 hour into my journey an unexpected headache occurred luckily i was 15 minutes away from vacuity.15 minutes in the headache worsened but fortunately i was in vacuity.

The place looked dull and advertisements filled the area with quotes such as “come work for me!” and “you should be here working” the residents looked like their facial expressions were taken away from them.Their eyes staring daggers at anyone with a gleeful smile and outgoing personality.10 minutes in and my head feels like it’s going to explode the pain is unbearable but i just have to hang in there as i am 5 minutes away from the store.

The deeper you go into the town the duller it gets and now the houses seem to be painted in a boring grey colour and not a sign of joy seems to be around.Finally i have made it to the store also the building looks to be an usual shape like something out of this world and my headache seemed to disappear when i entered the store.The manager said “are you here for the interview?” and i said “yes” unexpectedly he said “you can start working today” my lips pointed upwards and my eyes squinted “okay thank you” i replied.

I went behind the cashier and waited for customers to come but sadly no one came until an hour into my shift a man wearing a battered,grey hoodie and black,ruffled jeans also a no branded sneakers.He walked around at a snail pace which made me feel nervous.Suddenly he stopped right in-front of me and stared into my eyes with a nerve wracking grin.Something was off putting was it the way he walked at a snail pace or the wicked smile or the void less eyes or the way it looked semi-human.

Whatever the reason was it made me drenched in sweat and i was so afraid to look it in it’s eyes my eyelids started to close on it’s on.My hands  started to sweat uncontrollably and my lips trembled in fear.My knees felt weak and a spine-chilling tingle crawled up from my legs to my neck which made me twitch.

The man turned around and looked at the knives we had for sale which were hanged up on the mundane wall which was lacking a lot of excitement.The man examined the knives thoroughly for an extremely long period of time.When he was done he walked over to the back of the store.

He grabbed a pen out of his dull hoodie and started scribbling something on the floor but i couldn’t see what he was scribbling because of the countless boxes in-between my view of him but i could see his arm move around frantically and from the movement of his arm i could distinguish that he was drawing some symbols.

I yelled “what are you doing over there!” and the response he returned back was a low toned grunt.Angrily i hopped over the counter and went over to him and the thing i saw made me to afraid to move but he realised i saw him and he quickly ran away knocking over the canned food we had placed on the shelves.

One of the tomatoes canned food spilled onto the symbols and covered it in tomato sauce.When i calmed down i got a mop and started wiping away the mess and unfortunately the symbols wiped away as well before i could take pictures of it and send it to my new boss.

Traumatised by the experience, i went and took a smoke break outside to calm myself down.Out the corner of my eye i see an old,wrinkly lady pushing a cart pass the neighbouring stores.

the cart seemed to be covered by a unknown fabric but what i do know is that the cart seems to be leaving a trail of an unknown substance and the consistency of the substance is like tar (very slow and thick) the wheels degraded due to time and the wooden,old handles had scratches on all sides.The cart released an ominous aura and when the crows saw the cart they started moving frantically in a unpredictable and chaotic direction and their eyes were facing the back of their tiny skulls.

The old lady pushing the cart had a gleeful smile which put me at ease as it was the first person i saw that seemed happy to be in this crazy town, it was like a light beaming into a dark,scary room, the old lady stopped suddenly and faced my shop which was across the street from her and she started dancing.

Her hips moved left to right and her feet moved backwards and forwards and her hands and arms flared up and down.I thought she was just happy to see the store opened because all the other’s stores next to mine were closed at 5pm.Unfortunately that was not the case, she unveiled the cart and inside the cart was a gut-twisting,mind throbbing person in a position of a balloon giraffe.

His neck extremely long and purple with a faint dash of blue.His eyes bulging out of his eye socket and a rich,thick of bromine oozed out of his pupils violently.Two long bumps was on his forehead like a giraffe and his legs were missing bones as they were flat like a pancake.His teeth were rotting and insects were crawling out of his tonsils also his lower half of his jaw drooped to his bloody fingers which was placed on his flattened thighs.

my fight or flight response kicked in and i ran inside of the store locking the door behind me.The lady walked over to the store and started banging her head onto the wide,clean window.Her head was oozing out blood violently and her eyes started to enlarge by each bang she did.Until she stopped and just stood there like a bronze statue.After a while she started walking back to the cart across the street but out of the corner of my eye a car crashed into her frail body and sent her flying into the sky.She fell down like a meteor and landed on the wind shield of the dirty car.The man inside the car slowly walked out and faced the lady.

Out of nowhere the lady stood up and jumped onto the man and started biting the man face after a bit of struggle the lady pulled the man’s face off and ate it.She hopes of the man and carried his lifeless body back to the cart and calmly placed him in.She then walked away into the darkness of the night.
