o pre-phrase this part, I am currently writing this first section before I meet up with the man who sent the letter. I appreciate the little help I got and the words of caution. The situation from my last post hasn't changed much. Iris, Luke, Archie, and I are still at my mother's place. Those things haven't come back. I was prompted to try Google to search for any information about the coins I was given. After a moment of poorly scouring the internet, I eventually found what I was looking for. The Coins are Greek Drachma. I almost glossed past them, however, as the one that was sent to me in the mail seems to be a less common version. I remembered the one that was tossed into my car, resembling the Owl imagery that also appears on a lot of the images I could find online. I also later found the Coin underneath my car seat. I hadn't removed it since it was tossed in there months back. 

This may seem a little scatterbrained; Im just nervous about meeting with this thing… or at least the thing feels right to say. Assuming it's the same guy from the gas station. I've got Archie staying here while im out. He has his gun, and we know that, for whatever reason, the police at least work to scare these things away. I also just spoke with Iris. I finally told her. She was in the kitchen, still noticeably shaken after what had happened. She's a strong woman, though; it's what caught my attention when we first met, though over the years I've been able to pick up on her tells. It's small things, like little glances or uncomfortable smiles, that give her away. I approached her, asked her how she was doing, and once we had started talking. I told her. I told her about the bird stalking our son, about the split-faced creature that came into our home and threw me to the wall… how I think those things that attacked us not too long ago were connected to it. 

I even told her how it all seems to be happening because they are after Luke. 

“Why are they after our son?” She asked with a great sense of dread.

“I dont know”

“Do you think it's some sort of punishment?”

“Punishment for what?” 

“I dont know... he wasn't exactly born in the best of circumstances”

“I dont think we're being punished for our baby surviving that night. Also, we weren't the only ones.”

“But the cops said-” she said before I cut her off.

“I know what the cops said… but those things clearly aren't normal.”

Iris paused for a moment, taking a deep, shaky breath. In the silence, I had realised i raised my voice, not in any way that would warrant worry, but it brought me back to before she got pregnant, the fights we had. I wasn't proud of how I was, but before the thought could linger any further, she asked. 

“So what are we gonna do?” 

“I dont know. I did get a letter, though. Remember that weird guy at the gas station I mentioned?”

“The one with the cut-up face, yeah?”

“I think he wants to meet with me. I dont know if it's safe, but I feel he might have some answers.”

She didn't like the idea as much as I did, but we decided it'd be better to try and get some answers than to keep being in the dark. So Im about to drive over there. The rest of this post will be from me once I get back.

\-break-

So I drove out to the place that was listed, a small cafe just a few blocks away from my mom's apartment. It wasn't any brand I recognised, so I assumed it was a family-owned business since it didn't give off the vibe of some smaller privately owned shop. I stepped inside, the place being a bit on the empty side, with only 2 other people in there besides me and the staff. Just some old man sat at the counter reading a newspaper, and a scruffy-looking man was about college age. 

After ordering a plain coffee at the counter, I went over and sat down at one of the empty tables. I was sitting alone for probably a few seconds before a man sat down across from me. I hadn't seen him come in, though, with everything that's happened in the last few months, and that didn't surprise me. He didn't look like anyone I had met; he had olive skin, dark brown curly hair and youthful features. Despite the difference in appearance, one thing remained from the man i knew him to be. His cheeks, sunken in as if slit or cut, stretched out his mouth despite not connecting to the corners of his soft smile. “Alex… it is good to see you again.” He said, his voice soft and calming, just like last time. This time, I was a lot more to the point. 

“Who are you… and no cryptic shit or changing the subject, weird shit has been happening to me ever since I met you at that gas station, now talk”

“I will, though I'd keep your voice down. I chose this place because it was close, and barely anyone comes here, though that does not mean no one will hear you speak.”

I was stressed, but he was right. After taking a second to focus on what I wanted to ask next, I quieted down and asked.

“A name would be a good start. Who are you?”

“Your people have many names for me”

“I said no cryptic shit”

“I do not mean to be cryptic; it is simply a difficult question to answer for someone in my position… I believe Gabriel is what the Christians called me, though that was because I snuck myself into their beliefs when the Romans were shifting over. The oldest name I remember is Piled Stones. Hermes and Mercury are the ones I've known the longest, though. Some Romans also called me Odin when encountering the North Folk. Though I dont remember ever travelling to your northern lands at that period”

“So you're a God?”

“No… yes… Its complicated."

“So you're not a god?”

“God is a difficult term to use. We aren't immortal, we aren't all-powerful. We live a long time and can do a lot, but our forms and existences are bound by rules, areas, and domains.”

“So not a god, but you're like a god?”

“If that sufficiently answers your question, then yes”

His answer had me sit there for a moment before I decided to accept it and move on, as I realised a straight answer wasn't what I was going to get from that line of questioning. 

“Ok… So if you, Hermes… What's with the Bird?” 

“That would be my mother. Well, my mother, in the sense that she's married to my father, my mother was a human woman.”

“So, who's that… Aphrodite?”

“That is my Great Aunt…Also, my former sister in law” 

“That's weird, dude.” He just shrugged at that comment, seeming to understand how I found it odd, but not caring, I followed on by asking. 

“So, your mother, who is that?”

“Hera is her Oldest Name.”

“And what does she want with my Son?”

“...well, that is your first mistake”

“What is?” He went quiet for a moment, sliding another coin across the table. He then looked me in the eye, as the calming feeling his voice put over me began to fade, and I felt my anxiety creep back in.

“The coins are items that allow for our world to be fully understood by you mortals… but they also hide you from us, and hide our twisting of reality and perception from you when nearby.”

“That doesn't answer my question”

“It doesn't, but it is necessary”

“Then go on.”

“Your posts… you've only made a couple, but you're sharing the story? Tell me. Have you ever described Luke? Yourself? Your wife?”

It took me a second to think… other than his weight and a few small details from what I remember, I hadn't. Though at the time, I rationalised it. “I dont want to post that on the internet. I've already got Bird Monsters and Mutant Baby people coming after me, I dont need creepers on the internet, too” He looked at me with a sorrowful face afterwards, shaking his head as he moved on.

“Describe yourself to me”

“What?”

“Humour me”

“Ok, uhm. Long Blond hair, short beard, white, blue eyes, Kind of a thin face?”

“Now Iris”

“...Also white. She's a redhead, green eyes, pale with freckles… where are you going with this?”

“Now… Luke”

“Hes a baby… they kinda look the same…”

“That's not a description”

“What are you even trying to get at?”

“Describe your son”

“Hes…” I then tried to focus on it, thinking about every time I've lain beside him, played with him, held him in my arms, and every time I've thought about him while all of this shit was going on. My son, to whom I have devoted the last 3 months of my life. I couldn't think of a single detail. I tried to think, pushed and pushed, feeling a singular tear run down my face as I couldn't even provide 1 detail about my son. 

Then he took the coin from the table and placed it in my palm, telling me.

“Close your eyes, your mind can not handle what you'll witness before you” I follow his instructions as I feel the rusted metal in my palm. Like a freight train, a moment of clarity hits me… My son looked nothing like me or his mother. Not because he was a baby, he had no features from either of his parents, his hair was dark black, his skin tanned, his eyes an unnatural yellow. How had no one pointed this out? How did no one say anything? My family and friends had seen him. In a panic, I open my eyes and see the true form of the being ahead of me. His outline shifting, his form changing, the only part of his body that seemed solid was the rough, serpentine body that made up his torso and head, with a long tail that i couldn't find an end off; his body was a shifting frame, some parts merging with flesh, some parts piercing in through spiraling and painful looking protrusions of metal. Coiling around the mechanical appendages that made up his arms were 2 smaller serpents that rested upon his shoulders. 

He had no eyes. That was the thing that stuck with me, no sockets or indents, no sign they were ever there, just 4 slits that ride up from just above the nose that bulge into growths that sprouted up like coral… With a moment that left a blister on my hand from the friction, he snatched the coin from my grasp, his form shifting back to the almost humanoid one I had seen him in. 

“What… Why… What?” I stammered out. For some reason, despite knowing what i saw, I felt like i couldn't trust my thoughts on the matter, feeling a tight grip of confusion strangle my brain. Like, the description i gave would have been wrong if i looked again, or if the thing i saw sat across from me had nothing to do with anything I just said, and that's all I could figure out to call the pieces that make up that monstrous form.

He reassures me to the best of his ability, telling me. 

“Take deep breaths. Try to think of other things, your mind will rationalise what you've seen soon enough.”

“What… You're no god” 

“I never said i was” 

“What, what are you…” 

“The only one who will tell you the truth… that your son is not your own.” 

I reached over the table and gripped his shirt, though he barely moved as i felt my fingers grip past something other than fabric. The woman at the counter yelled over, hastily telling me to get off him and not to fight. 

“What do you mean he's not mine…” 

“Your wife doesn't know it either… But that child is my father's… my brother” 

I'd give anything to believe it's not true. Believe that all this was some sick dream that I'd wake up from in a moment. Yet I stayed awake, my attention dragged over as he continued. 

“My Mother has a habit of punishing those with whom my father commits adultery, as she is not powerful enough to punish him herself” 

“So what, because some lightning god couldn't keep it in his pants and fucked my wife, we have to suffer.”

“Not We… you are simply caught in the crossfire. She just wants your wife and child.” I was just about ready to hit him again after that, but I knew it wouldn't do anything. 

“So is that why you gave me these?” 

I'd say taking out the envelope and carefully pouring the other 2 coins onto the table, being careful not to touch them after what happened previously. As the metal clanked against the table, and I looked up at his face, a chill ran down my spine. His face the whole time had been this calm, uncaring smile, very little reaction even when i have been aggressive, but now, his face had dropped. 

“Go home… Now” 

“What?”

“Now, get in your car, and go to your wife and son. If you're fast enough, you may get there in time” 

“Are they in danger?” 

He finally snapped back at me, aggression in his voice, “I told you, the coins hide you from themIt'sts why they saw you when you were at the mall, and you brought both the coins i gave you here!” 

His words sink in like a knife to my gut, and i dont even hesitate. I run to my car outside and drive off, leaving in such a hurry that i clip one of the cars parked in front of me as I shoot off down the street. My knuckles were turning white as i gripped the wheel with intense focus. Hermes was right, the cafe was closed and almost as if i blacked out on the drive, I was at my mother's apartment, bursting out of the car and through the building's door.

Step after step, i charged up the stairs, until i got to our floor and saw the door wide open, hearing the blood-curdling scream from down the hall. I made a charge into the room. I wish there were a monster, some horrific god or beast i could at least pretend I'd be able to fight to save Iris, save my son.

But i couldn't. Luke was nowhere to be found. I couldn't see him anywhere, couldn't hear him cry, didn't know where he was. Iris, on the other hand. She was lying across the ground as i came into the room. Her screams continued as i heard her loud, shrill cries slowly turn into squeals, her bones snapping and contorting as I rushed over to her. I try to comfort her for a moment before her body begins to swell. A vile, disgusting transformation, slow and painful. That thing didn't kill her; it wouldn't do that, that's too easy. Instead, it decided a fitting punishment for the simple act of unknowingly birthing the son of a god was to turn her into a beast. 

She couldn't even get words out by the time I had gotten there, the pain of her transformation too much to bear. Eventually, her pain was over, but by that point, she was no longer human. Just a large mass of pink flesh, a squealing boar in the centre of the living room. There was nothing i could do, i made a mistake and it cost me my wife, cost me my… His son. 

He appeared once more, stood behind me, once again in his trench coat and hat, covering his shifting form. No longer human. 

“It was a mistake, a foolish one, but you couldn't have known. I apologise for snapping at you mortal… this is a story i have witnessed time and time again”

I didn't reply, just sat there with a whole pig in my arms, one that used to be the woman i loved. 

“I couldn't help her either… but if you wish, i may bargain with Mother. I may return your son to you if you wish it so; however, it comes at a cost”

I sat there, tears streaming down my face as the beast lay its head on my lap, heaving.

“If we can't undo this… then Luke would be all i have left here… what will it take?” 

He took a moment, his silence being louder than any word he could have spoken as he raised an arm, handing me a knife. 

I stared up with a moment of confusion, followed by hesitation, then sheer defeat. Finally hearing him speak.

“It is cruel what things of our kind do to your mortals… However, appeasement to what you call gods is the only way. Your bones are like twigs, your flesh like paper, your view of the world a small pond in a world surrounded by vast oceans. However, even the smallest of creatures serve their role… appeasement is one mortal kind that has taken on for themselves.”

He'd drop the knife to the floor, “If you want your son back”, he'd add before kicking over the knife and finishing “Appese her” 

There was no way to undo what had happened, no way to fix her, my love. The one who always made me smile on a bad day, the one who knew me better than i knew myself, the one who made me laugh and smile… we weren't perfect, but nothing is beautiful because it's perfect. 

I grasped the knife and raised it high, feeling my hand tremble as i did so. Even though all that stared back at me were the unfeeling eyes of an animal, all i could think about was what i was ending. It wasn't just her life; it was ours. It'd be casting out any chance of saving her and forcing her into a mental slideshow of memories. 

Even though it was lightweight weight something as simple as a knife made me feel as if i was holding up the world. There was no sound, nothing else in that moment but the hardest choice i could make… until that silence was broken. 

Crying. 

The familiar cry of my son, even though he wasn't mine. I've been with him since day one, i looked after him, and made sure he was safe. He was mine, and i could hear him crying. 

I turned around and plunged the knife into the chest of the figure, feeling soft flesh give way, as hollow bones snapped, the trenchcoated form behind me no longer the man i met, the one who claimed himself hermes, instead it was that head splitting form i had witnessed all those nights ago, that horrific feathered monstrosity and i had just stabbed it. Though indoing so, from what was previously covered by a trenchcoat, i saw my son slipping from the creature's grasp.

I fell to the floor as he fell, catching him in my arms, the creature screeching as it plucked the knife from its chest. It howled at me, crying out in words to hold for me to know, and that i should never have heard. I gripped Luke tightly in my arms, and stood between him and the beast, looking it dead in its eyes, peering from hanging flesh upon the dies of its torn open face. 

My mind was attacking itself, blood dripped from my nose, but i watched and gritted my teeth. Thinking of all the nights it watched him, those things it sent after us, how it threw me into a wall and how it nearly had me kill my own wife. 

I looked and scoured.

She lunged at me, Long bony arms coated in features reaching me long before her body did, talons sinking into my flesh, but i held Luke tight. The cold, sharp feeling piercing my gut, the strange sensation of blood gushing from my body. Though the shock was the worst part. Not feeling pain would be a godsend for most, but in this instance, it was a strange agony. 

She attempted to pry me away from him, the adrenaline being the only thing keeping me conscious as they tore my flesh. 

Their loud screeching was only being overshadowed by the Strike of thunder from outside. We were no longer hidden, and he knew where we were. 

Her body crumpled, almost as if a hand i could not see grasped her entire form. I felt her claws be pulled from my body, her shifting mass stable for a mere moment before a flash of light filled the room. Before i knew it… she was gone. The sound of bones cracking as Iris returned to her normal state, and i dropped to the floor. 

Im writing this part now as im in the hospital. My doctors told me it's a miracle i survived, though my look of disgust at the term miracle seemed odd to them. I had been out for a while, a few months, from what i was told. Iris had been staying at a friend's place not too far from the hospital. Apparently, nothing else had happened while I had been unconscious. 

Hopefully, that's the last we see of that so-called god… it wasn't the last i saw of the one calling itself Hermes, however.  He visited the hospital briefly, and I was lying there, staring at the ceiling while the doctors were off filing some of my paperwork. He walked in, his form human once more, though he was wearing a helmet with a wide brim, wings on either side. That got a weak chuckle out of me, which seemed to amuse him. We said no words to each other. I simply gave a concerned expression, and he raised a hand almost as if to let me know it was over… he then placed a coin next to my bed, and took his leave. 

Luke, Iris and I are now just trying to go back to normal. Luke's appearance has gradually changed over time; he now has my nose and his mother's eyes. He came out a redhead just like her, too. It does keep me up at night, however, knowing that out there, there are beings way more powerful than we could ever hope. That's all, though… if anything else happens, I'll update you all, but for now. I want to live my life, and hope you all take care.
