[Pt. 1.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fukc5u/i_became_a_park_ranger_in_montana_now_im_being/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

The atmosphere in the ranger station had become stifling. My encounter with whatever was lurking in the woods, the Wendigo, or whatever it was, loomed over us like a dark cloud. We patrolled together now, never venturing into the forest alone. Daniel insisted on this, but it was clear that tension between him and Earl was mounting with each passing day.

Earl was a no-nonsense type, and all the talk about the Wendigo was getting to him. He masked it with tough talk and hard looks, but I could see through it. Daniel, on the other hand, was quiet, reflective, and unnervingly calm. It was the kind of calm that made me wonder if he had already made peace with the idea that things weren’t going to end well.

We still had a job to do, though, and we couldn’t just sit in the station. Outside though, the usual sounds of nature were gone, replaced by an oppressive silence. Not even the wind seemed to move anymore. I often found myself glancing between the two men, feeling like I was caught in the middle of two fighting parents.

One afternoon, after busting up a beaver dam, we were on our way back to the station, when we came across another mutilated deer. “It’s another one”, Daniel said. Earl knelt beside the remnants, his face twisted in frustration.

"We’re chasing shadows out here," Earl muttered, standing up and wiping his hands on his pants. "This ain’t no Wendigo. Probably just some damned bear with a grudge."

Daniel, standing a few feet away, was watching the tree line, his eyes scanning the distance as if waiting for something to emerge. When Earl's grumbling grew louder, Daniel finally spoke up.

"You know it’s not a bear, Earl. You’ve seen the tracks."

Earl shot him a sharp look. "I’ve been doing this for thirty years, Daniel. I know a bear when I see one. I don’t need you filling the kid’s head with your bullshit legends."

Daniel’s expression remained calm, but there was a hard edge in his voice when he responded. "This isn’t about legends. It’s about survival. The Wendigo is real, and it’s hunting us."

Earl stepped closer to Daniel, his face contorted with anger. "You think I’m scared of some fairy tale? I’ve faced real predators, real threats. This thing, whatever it is, it doesn’t scare me."

Daniel didn’t back down. "That’s your problem, Earl. You’re not scared enough."

The tension between them was thick, and for a moment, I thought one of them might throw a punch. I stood there, awkwardly silent, my eyes darting between the two of them, unsure of what to say. Finally, Earl snorted and stormed off toward the station.

"I’m done with this shit," Earl muttered. "You two can sit around talking about monsters and fucking fairy tales all you want. I’m going to bed."

That night, Daniel and I stayed by the fire, the flickering flames casting long shadows on the floor. The silence that followed was suffocating, but eventually, I broke it.

"Do you really think we’re being hunted?" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

Daniel didn’t answer right away. He poked at the fire with a stick, watching the embers rise up the chimney before he finally spoke.

"Yes," he said softly. "I think the Wendigo has chosen us. Once it sets its sights on you, there’s no going back. It’s patient. It waits. It wears you down."

I swallowed hard, my throat dry. "And how do you stop it? I mean, how do you kill it?"

Daniel’s eyes shot up to meet mine, and for a moment, he didn’t say anything. Then, he shook his head. "You don’t."

"There has to be a way," I pressed, desperation creeping into my voice.

Daniel looked away, staring into the fire. "Legends say there is, but it’s dangerous. You’d have to trap it first, and that alone is nearly impossible."

My pulse quickened. "How do you trap it?"

Daniel hesitated, as if debating whether or not to tell me. After a long pause, he sighed and leaned forward, lowering his voice. "The Wendigo fears fire. You’d need to lure it into a trap with something it wants, flesh. And once it’s close enough, you’d have to burn it. But it won’t be easy. It’s smart. It’ll know what you’re trying to do."

A chill ran down my spine. "So we use ourselves as bait?"

Daniel nodded grimly. "It’d be the only way."

We spent the next few days preparing the trap. It was a plan born out of desperation, but it was all we had. We set up in a narrow ravine deep in the forest, a place where the trees were thick and the ground uneven. We dug a deep pit and filled it with kindling, creating a makeshift pyre. The idea was simple, lure the Wendigo into the hole, ignite the fire, and hope it would be enough to kill it.

Earl, despite his earlier protests, went along with the plan. His gruff exterior had cracked, and I could see the fear in his eyes, though he tried to hide it behind tough talk. He was desperate for it to be over.

"Just make sure you don’t screw this up, Tom," Earl muttered as we set the final touches on the trap. "We only get one shot at this."

Daniel stood nearby, quiet as always, but there was a tension in him that I hadn’t seen before. I knew he was nervous, even if he didn’t show it.

The sun began to set, casting darkness across the forest. The air grew colder, and the wind picked up, carrying with it the familiar scent of decay that made my stomach churn. We took our positions. Daniel and I stood near the pit, while Earl waited a little further back, his rifle at the ready, just in case.

For a long time, there was nothing but silence. The forest was unnervingly still, as if holding its breath. Then, from somewhere deep in the woods, came the sound of footsteps, slow, deliberate, and not human.

My heart raced, and I gripped my gun, my eyes scanning the darkness. Daniel and I stood by the hole, waiting for our opportunity to light the fire. The footsteps grew louder, closer, and then, I saw it.

The Wendigo.

It moved between the trees with an unnatural grace, its long, gaunt limbs twisted and pale. Its eyes glowed with an eerie light, and its mouth hung open, revealing sharp, jagged teeth. The sight of it made my blood run cold.

It was huge, much taller than I had imagined, with a skeletal frame that seemed barely held together by its rotting flesh. Its stench filled the air, a sickly-sweet smell of decay and death. It moved toward us, and we waited in anticipation as it drew closer and closer to the hole. Just a little bit further, I thought to myself. And, for a moment, I thought our plan might actually work. But, just as the Wendigo was almost on top of the hole, Earl raised his rifle.

“Earl, no!” Daniel shouted. But before he could fire, the Wendigo moved, fast, impossibly fast. It darted toward Earl, its long arms reaching out with terrifying speed. Earl screamed, a guttural, panicked sound, but it was too late.

The Wendigo slammed into him, knocking him to the ground. Its claws tore into his flesh, ripping him apart with horrifying precision. Blood sprayed across the forest floor, and Earl’s screams were cut short as the creature’s jaws closed around his throat, tearing it out in one swift motion.

I froze, my body locked in place as I watched in horror. Earl’s body convulsed for a moment before going still, his blood pooling beneath him. The Wendigo stood over him, its mouth smeared with blood, its glowing eyes locked onto me.

"Run!" Daniel shouted, grabbing my arm and yanking me away from the scene.

We bolted, sprinting through the trees as fast as we could. The Wendigo let out a bone-chilling screech, and I could hear it crashing through the growth behind us, its footsteps fast and relentless.

We ran, the forest a blur around us. My lungs burned, my legs screamed in protest, but I didn’t dare stop. The sound of the Wendigo’s pursuit was right behind us, its screeches echoing through the trees.

Then, Daniel stumbled.

I turned just in time to see him fall, his foot catching on a root. He hit the ground hard, and before I could reach him, the Wendigo was upon him.

"Go!" Daniel shouted, his voice hoarse. "Get to the station!"

I hesitated for a split second, but the sight of the Wendigo tearing into Daniel’s flesh sent me into a blind panic. I turned and ran, Daniel’s screams echoing in my ears as I sprinted through the forest.

I burst through the door of the ranger station, slamming it shut behind me. My hands were trembling, my breath coming in ragged gasps. Blood smeared across my face and clothes, not mine, but Earl’s and Daniel’s.

I stumbled to the radio, frantically calling for help.

"Mayday! Mayday! This is Ranger Carter! We need immediate help at Pine Creek Forest! There’s something out here, something killing us! Please, send help!"

There was static for a moment, and then a voice crackled through the speaker. "Copy. Stay where you are. Help is on the way."

I dropped the radio and collapsed onto the floor, my body shaking with fear and exhaustion. The fire in the hearth flickered weakly, casting shadows on the walls. The station felt too small, too vulnerable. The Wendigo was out there, somewhere in the darkness, and I could feel it, like a predator circling its prey. My body trembled as I stood in the middle of the room, trying to figure out what to do next. The fire crackled softly, offering little comfort. I grabbed the rifle from Earl’s stash, my hands slick with sweat as I fumbled with the bullets.

The radio sat on the desk, hissing with intermittent static. I had no idea how long it would take for help to arrive, or if they would even believe my frantic call. My breath was shallow, and my mind raced with images of Earl’s body being ripped apart, Daniel’s final screams as the Wendigo closed in on him. They were gone. I was alone.

And then I heard it.

At first, it was faint, a soft scratching, like nails dragging across wood. It came from the door. My heart pounded in my chest as I stood frozen, listening to the sound grow louder. My mind raced. The Wendigo was here.

A voice suddenly broke the silence. It was faint, but unmistakable. "Tom... let me in."

I froze, my eyes wide with terror. The voice was familiar. It was Daniel.

"Tom..." the voice came again, pleading. "Please... help me. It’s out here, I’m hurt. Let me in."

I wanted to believe it was him. God, I wanted to believe he had somehow survived. But I knew the truth. Daniel was dead. I had seen it happen. And now, the Wendigo was using his voice to lure me outside.

Tears welled up in my eyes as I backed away from the door, clutching the rifle to my chest. "You’re not Daniel," I whispered, my voice shaking.

The scratching at the door stopped, replaced by a low, guttural growl. My blood turned to ice as I realized the Wendigo knew I wasn’t going to fall for its trick.

Suddenly, there was a loud bang against the door, the force of it rattling the entire station. I stumbled backward, nearly tripping over a chair as the door creaked under the pressure. The creature was trying to get in.

Bang.

Another hit, harder this time. The door splintered slightly, the wood cracking beneath the force of the blow.

"Tom..." the voice came again, this time sounding like Earl. "Open the door. I need your help."

I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to block out the sound. My hands shook so badly I nearly dropped the rifle. "No," I whispered. "You’re not real."

Bang.

The door buckled, and I could see a long, bony claw poke through the wood, scraping along the inside of the doorframe. I aimed the rifle, my hands trembling so much I could barely keep it steady.

"Get away!" I shouted, my voice barely more than a whimper.

The creature let out a low, rumbling growl, and then there was silence. The scratching stopped, and for a moment, I thought it might have given up. But then, from outside the window, I heard it again, the voices.

"Tom..." in Daniel’s voice. "Come outside. It’s safe now."

"No..." I whispered, shaking my head. "You’re not real..."

The voices continued, calling me to come outside. I turned toward the window, my breath catching in my throat. The firelight flickered, casting eerie shadows across the room. My heart raced as I caught a glimpse of movement outside, something tall and thin, moving between the trees.

I backed away from the window, my stomach churning with dread. I knew the Wendigo was playing with me, taunting me, trying to break me down. It wanted me to open that door, to step outside into the cold night where it could finish me.

Suddenly, the radio crackled to life again.

"Ranger Carter. Hold tight, help is inbound. ETA—"

The radio hissed with static, cutting off the rest of the message. But at least they were coming. I just had to survive until then.

I grabbed what little ammunition I could find and barricaded myself in the back room, blocking the door with a desk and anything else I could move. My hands were shaking so badly I could barely load the rifle, and the constant scratching at the walls made it nearly impossible to focus.

"Tom..." Earl's voice called again from outside. "Come-on kid, it’s cold out here... let me in."

I clutched the rifle tighter, my back pressed against the wall as the temperature inside the cabin seemed to drop. The voices continued for what felt like hours. My breath fogged in the air, and I could feel the cold seeping in from the cracks in the windows.

Suddenly, there was a loud crash from the front of the station. The sound of splintering wood filled the air, and I knew, it had finally broken through the door.

My heart pounded in my chest as I heard the slow, deliberate footsteps moving through the station. They were heavy, each step causing the floorboards to creak under its weight. It was inside.

I held my breath, my hands shaking as I gripped the rifle. The footsteps grew louder, closer. I could hear its breathing now, slow, ragged, and unnatural, like it was savoring the fear it could sense in me. The creature was hunting me, and it knew exactly where I was.

Suddenly, there was silence. The footsteps stopped right outside the door to the back room.

For a moment, I thought maybe it hadn’t seen me. Maybe it would leave. But then, slowly, the door began to creak, the makeshift barricade groaning under the pressure.

I raised the rifle, aiming it at the door as it swung open, revealing the dark, hulking figure of the Wendigo. Its eyes glowed in the darkness, piercing through the dim light like two burning embers. Its mouth hung open, revealing it’s sharp, bloodstained teeth.

For a moment, time seemed to stand still.

And then, the creature lunged.

I fired the rifle, the deafening crack echoing through the small room. The bullet hit the Wendigo in the shoulder, but it barely flinched. It let out a bone-chilling screech, its long, twisted arms reaching for me.

I fired again, this time hitting it in the chest. The Wendigo staggered back, but it was still coming. I scrambled backward, trying to reload the rifle, but my hands were shaking so badly that I dropped the bullets.

The Wendigo lunged again, its claws swiping at me. I barely dodged in time, feeling the air whip past my face as its claws sliced through the wooden desk. I grabbed the rifle and swung it like a bat, smashing it against the creature's head.

It let out another screech, staggering back toward the door. I used the brief moment of reprieve to grab more bullets and reload the rifle, my heart racing as the creature began to recover.

Just as I raised the rifle to fire again, I heard the faint sound of a helicopter in the distance.

The Wendigo seemed to sense the approaching rescue as well. It turned its head toward the window, its glowing eyes narrowing. The sound of the helicopter grew louder, and for the first time since the nightmare had begun, I felt a flicker of hope.

The creature let out one final, ear-piercing screech before it turned and bolted out of the room, disappearing into the darkness of the forest. I collapsed to the floor, my entire body shaking with adrenaline and exhaustion. The cold air from the shattered door flooded into the cabin, but I didn’t care.

Within minutes, the helicopter touched down outside the station, and several park rangers and other state law enforcement officers rushed inside. They found me huddled in the back room, clutching the rifle to my chest, my eyes wide with shock.

"Are you okay?" one of them asked, kneeling beside me.

I nodded, though I wasn’t sure I believed it myself. I was alive, but barely. The others.. Earl, Daniel, they were gone.

As they helped me to my feet and led me outside, I glanced back at the forest, half-expecting to see the glowing eyes of the Wendigo watching me from the trees. But there was nothing. Just darkness.

They transferred me to a new post near Billings, Montana, a far cry from the isolation of Pine Creek Forest. This area is more populated, filled with tourists and families enjoying the safety of a well-maintained national park.

It was supposed to be a fresh start, a way to leave the horrors of Pine Creek behind. But the truth is, you never really escape something like that. The Wendigo may be far away now, but it still haunts me. Every rustle of leaves, every gust of wind that echoes through the trees, sends a shiver down my spine.

Some nights, when I’m alone, I can still hear the voices of Daniel and Earl, calling out to me from the dark. Sometimes I even swear I see something moving between the trees, just out of sight. But I know better than to investigate or go looking for it. I do my best to not venture too deep into the wilderness. Once the Wendigo chooses you, it never really lets you go.
