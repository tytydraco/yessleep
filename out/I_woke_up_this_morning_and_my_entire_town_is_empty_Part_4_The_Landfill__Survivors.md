The black smoke filled the air, the stench of the landfill smelled of garbage, excrement, and burning flesh. 

I was on top of a hill next to the landfill, out of sight from the corrupted group of people. I say corrupted because those people, as you’ve read before, are not themselves and it seems very clear that something is horribly wrong with them. 

“What the fuck” I whispered. In the center of the landfill, there was a big wooden table. Two of those corrupted people, one man, one woman, were dragging a man about my age toward the wooden table. “Get the fuck off of me! You psychotic fucks!” He screamed, the man sounded terrified. It took me a moment to realize that he was different, the man wasn’t corrupted, he was normal like me. The two put the man on the table and strapped him in. “N-no no please!” He shouted. 

The old woman that I saw on the first day strutted over to the table with a knife in her hands, holding it as if it were a child. “Don’t! Please don’t!” The man screamed.

“We Want Blood” they said in unison.

The old woman brought the knife down onto the man’s chest, sliding the knife down to his belly. Blood began to squirt onto the ground, guts began to spill, and the man began to foam at the mouth, as if he was overdosing.

I almost screamed, until I heard it. There was a low rumble, followed by what sounded like a voice, a deep, loud voice, speaking some sort of gibberish. I couldn’t figure out what it meant. The old woman took the straps off of the now deceased man. I was about to go back to the car when I saw something I wish I didn’t. The man began to levitate into the air and float toward the garbage pile. I couldn’t see much but I saw or I think I saw some sort of tentacle grab the man. I didn’t see where the man went but I can only assume that whatever was in that landfill took him. 

A couple of seconds after seeing that, my phone began to ring. I tried to silence it but it was too late. Those things heard it and were running in my direction. I stood up and started sprinting back to my car. I didn’t see how many were running after me, but if I had to guess, it was over 30 of them. 

I managed to make it back to my car as they started coming over the hill. Panic and terror set in as I could see the old woman. I put my car in drive and drove past the crowd, all of them screamed. Whatever those things are, they aren’t human, not anymore. They may look like us, but they aren’t us. I think that whatever is in the landfill is making them do these things. 

I checked my phone to see who had called. It was Nancy. I called back immediately, there was ringing then, someone answered the phone. “Nancy?” I asked, “S-Sam?” Shelly asked. “Nancy! Where are you?!” I shouted. “I’m with your parents, we’re at your h-house” she said. “Okay, I’ll be right there!” I screamed and I continued driving, speeding up. 

When I arrived at my house, I honked the horn a couple of times outside. I was confused, nobody came running out. I turned the car off and ran inside. “Mom?! Dad?! Nancy?!” I screamed. Silence. I took out my phone and called Nancy. She picked up immediately, “Nancy? Where are you?” I asked, “S-Sam, we’re at your house” she said. “What do you mean? I’m here” I muttered. There was silence on the other end of the phone, “S-Sam, other than me and your parents, the house is empty.” The call ended, and all I could think of was answers. How is that possible? I was in the house the same time that they were, so where are they? 

There was a knock at the door. And I walked over to investigate. It was a group of people, five of them to be exact. All of them were armed with rifles, handguns and some kind of weapon to swing. “Hello?” I asked, the woman standing in front of the others began to speak, “you’re new aren’t you? But you’ve seen them right? The corrupted?” 

•••

It’s been a few hours now, I’m with that group. We’re hiding out in a farmhouse near the edge of town. There was the girl in the front, Andrea, then Thomas, Frank, Jane, and lastly James. 

The man that I saw get killed at the landfill today, that was their friend Marcus. I guess he was out scouting with them when the corrupted came and took him to the landfill. 

Thomas has a theory, he thinks that whatever that thing is in the landfill is some sort of God. He thinks that we aren’t in our world anymore, just one that looks and sounds like ours. As if everything was copied and pasted into a blank slate. I told him about a comment left on here, about it being an anomaly. He thought it was a good working theory, but he’s not entirely sure what it is either. 

I’m going to keep writing to you all until I figure out how to leave this place. I don’t know when you’ll see a part 5, because if I’m being honest, I don’t know if I’ll be alive in a few days, but if I am, I will tell you all. Until then,

Sam.
