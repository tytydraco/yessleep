'Time.'

They say it's the purest form of giving without expecting anything in return. To be unconditional, understanding, and patient. Love can be the sweetest thing of all, but it can also be the most dangerous weapon in the world.

As children, some have been taught to love, give, and share without expecting gratitude or compensation, and for the most part, I've done that. I've bent over backwards to please those that are around me, may it be friends or family, I believe I've done what I can—what I could to please, to make people happy.

Of course, not all of my attempts or actions have been favorable; after all, I'm still human. We strive to live earnestly every day, some more than others. Those who wear their heart on their sleeves either get the short end of the proverbial stick or the most favorable, though maybe nothing in between.

I've been deep in misery for the past few 'ridiculously elongated' days. Thinking a lot—wondering to myself amidst the relentless ticking racking in my head, that I've oddly gotten used to for the past few years.

'How did I end up here?'

Isolated yet never alone, needing affection, yet deflecting off like a hot mirror baking in the sun, cursed to burn whoever dares to touch.

The feeling of joy felt like a luxury, something I couldn't afford at the moment. Recently, I've run myself dry from giving polite smiles and forbearing responses to customers while working my shift at the mall food court.

But it wasn't always bad. After a long day, I'd find myself curled up in my room with a nice snack and a movie to watch, and fantasize about escaping into a world where maybe I wasn't a cashier rushing to different food shacks to ask for a change of coins.

(Who'd be turned down due to 'company policies' regarding cash registers)

As the customer relentlessly taps their foot on the tile floor, waiting for the change after paying ten dollars for a single bottle of water.

During a short dopamine high from the feeling of watching a good movie, I'd envision myself living a different life—one felt worth living, I'd envision that I was an Italian swordsman ready to embark on a journey with my lover in the 1700s, or a wizard cursed with an everlasting wand, kept alive undyingly as long as the wand stayed intact.

But alas, reality can quite often be... 'Disappointing.'

I was once a boy with a dream, one who had hopes of becoming a professional baseball player. And I was on my way there. I had scholarships lined up for playing—offers from schools that saw potential in me, who believed I could go far. I trained every day like it was my last, threw every pitch like it mattered—because it did.

That was before everything had changed.

During a damp summer evening, I had woken from feeling the heaviest weight on my chest. It felt excruciating—throbbing painfully beneath my nerves as I watched before my eyes the skin and flesh right where my heart rests tear itself off, to form a ring of muscle resembling a crater oozing with blood and fluid around what looked like an organ forcing itself out of my body—an out stretched tissue that had began to protrude outside of the freshly formed opening in my body.

Thinking back, I was lucky the lights were off at that time, nothing but the pale moonlight emitting from my open blinds, leaving just enough light for me to see, yet barely process the true color of the scene I was living in.

Fresh blood pooled from the rim with each movement of protrusion, dribbling down my skin from the opened flesh before forming a stream of dark maroon on my sheets. The sheer taut tissue ripped itself from the middle like the skin of raw poultry being forcibly pulled in half—except I wasn't dead or a castrated chicken.

I was completely and utterly alive.

I felt every shred of nerve as I screamed in pure agony. I could barely look at my body and what was happening anymore, with my limbs thrashing against my bed until I fell off with a harsh thud. I coiled into a fetal position on the floor as the throbbing pain slowly numbed, with my head stirring to a clouded haze.

Despite the excruciating pain, I knew that my mind was the only thing protecting me now, as it gave me blissful release from the pain by shutting down.

I blacked out.

The morning came in a normal routine; no matter what happened in the darkness of the night, morning always arrived, joyful and nescient. Light had peaked through my blinds, as I barely prompted myself off the floor. It took longer to get to the bathroom despite the proximity, but the moment I looked in the mirror, seeing my reflection, I let out a choked sob.

'I had... a clock on my chest?' I thought.

But the numbers didn't make any sense.

'79:05:31'

I pondered for what felt like an hour, staring into the mirror, touching the surrounding flesh that was bruising a deep purple around my unusually gaunt, pale skin, presumably through blood loss. Tapping the surface of what should've been glass, or a mockery of what it is.

I felt my taps reverberate from the subtle pressure, as reality began to settle further into me—this is real.

A translucent plate of keratin stretched across the newly formed body part, catching the faint light beneath it, a kin to the way a clock's face catches the glow of its numbers, prompted on a mundane nightstand.

Though what I was looking at was anything but mundane—anything but normal. It glowed eerily like an anglerfish's faint light, buzzing to lure its prey. The plate felt nail-like; it felt too smooth to be skin, yet too brittle to be bone.

It was completely unnatural, yet it existed with purpose—to protect the sensitive flesh beneath, while the heated glow of light settled behind peculiarly. The numbers flickered, the same numerical sequence ('79:05:31') unchanging and muted, yet the buzz and tick felt present in my mind.

The device had settled on my flesh, like an organ sustaining itself from my own body, consuming energy to power itself—to stay alive.

It took me a while to shake myself off mentally enough to muster up the courage to leave the bathroom. I tried my best to power through and had to call in sick to avoid work that day. And with whatever energy I had left in me, I cleaned the bloody mess that was my room, threw away the sheets that resembled evidence for murder.

It's been almost a year since that day, almost a year since my life has completely turned upside down, where I'm now forced to live in a reality where I watch myself become a shell of the person I was—the person who I knew I was meant to be.

It felt like watching a car crash I couldn't stop, I could only stand aside, breathe, and hope for the best, because baseball wasn't just a sport to me—it was the future I believed in, it was the only thing that made sense.

And now... nothing ever does.

Except, there is one thing that makes sense to me now, it took me a while to figure out, almost about a week or two since the device grew itself from my flesh—the numbers changed. For the next few days, I noticed it would change, apart from the first two numeric parts of the sequence.

 Within two weeks, the sequence would change from '79:05:31' to '79:05:17', and within two months, it would be reduced to '79:03:17'.

It made sense to me the purpose of this... device. It was an indicator of time, of life—my life. 

Clear as day to me, it was a reminder of how long I've got left live. I felt a sense of ease at that thought, realizing I've got so much more time, yet as I psychologically deteriorated, the mundane, directionless path my days had been accustomed to, somehow influenced the numbers on my chest to change.

On some days, it would be lower; I recall about '63:11:27' on the days when I simply didn't feel like getting out of bed, loathing to clock in to a job I never truly had any want to be in, apart from the money that could help sustain me on a day to day basis. 

And on harder days, it would go as low as '24:08:21'. Those were the days I'd find myself aimlessly wandering the empty desolate streets of my town, a throbbing sensation on the left side of my chest as I slowly became numb to the pain with a simple fix of throat burning liquor—the only sanctuary I could turn to help me with the numbing pain I'd feel.

Though, sometimes I'd catch myself using the pain as an excuse to drink, when in reality I just... wanted to forget—for in those moments I find myself not wanting to be myself anymore.

But usually after some time of self-loathing and sulking I could still find it in me to smile, even just a little. Seeing the local strays run around, nuzzle their kins after having a hefty meal provided by the neighborhood's favorite senior, 'Helena'. The older woman always seemed so happy—so content in the mundane and day to day life of peaceful normalcy, that seeing her at times made me feel silly for groveling with my own problems.

It reminded me of everything I had been told growing up, to always be grateful for what I have, to never take the things I have for granted—and I don't, but that doesn't mean I can't feel negative about the things that are clearly wrong happening around me. 

Around the time the wound on my chest had begun to feel bearable months had already passed, I began to practice once again, to play—to do what I know I do best.

Of course I didn't white-knuckle my way through recovery, charging straight toward the field like a minotaur seeing red, but I was hungry—starving even. So, I started small. It began with ball tosses against the wall, spent my afternoons playing ball until my upstairs neighbor 'Vincent' knocked on my door red as a cherry to the face, resembling a gradient popsicle stick with how thick his neck had gotten. 

A few light catches. The soft slap of the ball against the glove was almost comforting—until the motion tugged at the tight, healing skin across my chest.

It wasn't pain so much as a warning, a dull, pulling sensation that sent a tremor of doubt through me every time I raised my arm. Still, I pushed forward, moving from gentle throws to tentative swings of the bat. It felt heavier than I remembered, the weight dragging at my muscles. My body didn't move the way it used to; every step was careful, hesitant, as if one wrong move would lead me to crumble like a heap of sand.

Just the other day, the first time I tried to pitch again, the ball slipped from my fingers before I even reached full rotation, rolling pathetically across the dirt. The second time, I forced the motion, teeth clenched—and a sharp, searing pain shot through my chest, like electricity coursing through my veins, as all of my limbs felt the shock of the consequence I inevitably knew I'd make. 

I dropped the glove, clutching at the wound, and fell to my knees.

The field around me blurred, and for a moment I couldn't tell if the wetness on my face was sweat or tears. The smell of the grass, once comforting, felt like a cruel reminder of everything I'd lost, and the slow hum, the mechanical tone repeated inside my head over and over again, it may have seemed incredulous to others, but it was real to me.

'Tick'

'Tock'

'Tick'

'Tock'

Where once I used to hear the sound of my heart, the calming rhythm of a heartbeat was now drowned out by the mocking tone of a clock, slowly but surely itching at my resolve.

Right then and there I knew I had to do something, I couldn't hide... whatever this was on my chest forever, there was no use in thinking what others would think of me because of this, whether or not they looked at me like I was a freak, it didn't matter to me anymore—I just want to be normal again.

I stayed there for a while, kneeling in the dirt, listening to the wind whistle through the empty bleachers. I had pulled out my phone looking through the nearest hospitals nearby that I could.. maybe seek refuge to—I was hesitant, but I was determined to take back my life, to no longer let circumstances win over.

It may have felt like the game had already moved on without me, but I wasn't going to give up without a fight, whether I have to do it thing alone—to rip it out of my chest and hit with a swing to throw it as far as possible.

I'm going to survive, even if I have to die trying.
