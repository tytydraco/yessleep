[Previous: ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h0p1ut/im_a_contract_worker_for_a_secret_corporation/)

I was recovering between jobs when I got an odd request. Someone named Jacob wanted me to teach him more about magic. The name didn’t ring a bell, but I soon realized he was the hunter we saved from the bug-infested hotel. I agreed to the request but also asked August if he could spare some time.  

I have been involved with supernatural creatures since I was a child. My first romantic relationship was with a cute creature who had mimic powers when I was about seventeen. Even with all my experience, I would never fully understand how magic worked better than someone who relied on it as a life force.  

August agreed and we arrived at the empty park first. While we waited, we played Rock Paper Scissors because Lucas had recently gotten into playing it with others. August wasn’t too great at it, so I let him practice with me for a few minutes. He kept throwing out rock because, in his words, he liked rocks.  

Jacob showed up giving us an expression that made it seem as if he regretted his decision. He was looking good considering how close he came to death recently. He still wore the long coat but changed his shoes to something more practical.  

“This is August. He knows a lot so he agreed to help. How long have you been working as a contract worker?” I asked after Jacob walked over.  

He blew a strand of long hair out of his face. If he wanted to do this job, he should at least keep his hair tied back.   

“Two months. I called you cause I figured you had connections to getting better weapons. How much would a big gun cost me?” He sounded like a teenager.   

I bet he wasn’t even nineteen yet. August smiled and gave me a side eye at the mention of a gun. I nudged him silently ordering him not to make fun of a newbie.  

“A lot. But I wouldn’t suggest a gun. If you’re going to invest that sort of money in a powerful weapon a blade along with charming your coat would be better. Is your jacket special?”  

Most hunters wore jackets that weren’t just for fashion reasons. They could be fused with magic, or parts of supernatural creatures to make the fabric resist damage. Some of the more advanced jackets were almost like a living creature bonded with their owner. The suits the Agents wore offered the same kind of protection. I’ve also heard supernatural mailmen had uniforms that protected them better than most jackets hunters could get their hands on.  

“It’s not a magic one if that’s what you’re asking. And why should I use a sword instead of a gun? Isn’t keeping your distance a better idea when it comes to monsters.” Jacob argued clearly, already annoyed.  

“Ditch the jacket.” August chimed in.  

The younger man scowled. Before he could question the statement, August had closed the distance between them. He slipped behind Jacob, took hold of his long coat, and pulled. I watched the pair as the kid frantically got back to his feet time and time again. No matter how much he tried dodging, August just caught the jacket and swept him off his feet again. By the time I broke the two up, Jacob had removed the coat, only for August to steal it away and tie it around the boy. He had only bruised Jacob’s ego but that was enough for his face to turn red in frustration.   

“I get it! No long coats! Are you happy?! Now tell me where I can get a damn gun!”  

He tossed the coat to the ground, face sweaty and hands shaking from rage. August wasn’t done. He reached over and tied Jacob’s hair back with a fair amount of protest. Jacob left his hair back accepting the message but still angry as hell.  

“To get back to the gun versus sword question, it’s mostly based on mass. A bullet is way smaller than a blade. Ten bullets would do less damage than a single stab from even a dagger.” I started to explain.  

“I call bullshit.” Jacob snorted.  

“Aw, I knew he was just a little baby but I didn’t understand how much of one.” August teased.  

I swear they were seconds away from a slapping fight. I sighed shaking my head. I hated just how often people like Jacob became Hunters. They thought they could just pick up a few weapons to slaughter evil creatures without understanding how magic really worked.  

“August, I’m going to pretend to stab you.” I told him so he would walk near me.  

To Jacobs's confusion, he watched me land a fake stab into August’s chest. The dramatic acting out a fake death wasn’t needed to prove my point though.   

“Magic is power that requires your will to control. A blade moves your entire body, your entire will to flow into it. An attack is more powerful based on the actions and intentions behind it.”  

August stayed on the ground and nodded along with my explanation. Jacob didn’t appear overly impressed.   

“You need to put your entire body into firing a gun. Like getting in the right position to aim. So why doesn’t that count?” He pointed out arms crossed.  

I started to go into a more detailed lecture about the difference between just shooting a bullet and using a blade against a supernatural creature. There were a few factors that made swords the preferred weapon.  All the willpower and magic get channeled into the sword in an attack. While firing a gun, the magic gets poured into the gun itself and not the bullets. Sure, bullets could be blessed, and depending on what type you used they can kill strong creatures. Those kinds of bullets were out of most Hunter’s budgets to create. Not even The Corporation used them that often because of how hard they were to produce. Also, most Hunters who start out relying on firepower think they’re safe at a distance. They don’t properly train their body to avoid counterattacks. Monsters can fire magic, or move faster than some humans can react to.   

As I spoke Jacob appeared more and more defeated. Even August got bored and started to scroll through his phone while on the ground. I would have kept going on, but Jacob raised a hand to make me stop speaking.  

“Where can I buy a magic sword then?” He sighed.  

August stood back up and shoved his phone into my face trying to show off some sort of cat meme I ignored.  

“You can borrow them through The Corporation when you accept a contract job. In fact, you can borrow all sorts of supplies you might need for a job. If you return the items clean and with minimal damage they won’t charge you for the use. “  

Jacob gave me a look that told me he wished I’d just told him all that to start with.  

“Do you want to do a few easy jobs together? You need more experience before taking on dangerous work. And it would be nice to not deal with this brain eater for once.” I offered as I started to push August away.  

He had gotten bored and draped himself over my left side. Sometimes I wondered why he was so comfortable fooling around and acting so dumb around me.  

“Brain eater? Like... as in... he eats monster brains?” Jacob asked as his entire body grew tense.  

His mood completely changed. It was as if he was suddenly in front of a man-eating beast ready to strike.  

“Monster or human. I’m not overly picky.” August announced.  

I should have realized that bringing along August was a bad idea. I wasn’t thinking properly that day. Jacob drew a handgun he kept hidden at his waist and fired in our direction. The bullet was weak, and his movements were slower than August. He raised a hand that transformed into a set of claws protected with a hard shell. I slightly jumped at the sound but was more confused than startled.  

“What the hell is wrong with you!” Jacob shouted in disgust. “He’s a monster and you’re that close with him?!”  

I knew Hunters hated supernatural creatures and refused to work with them, but I didn’t see Jacob as a real Hunter because he’d taken contract work. I just figured he had already worked alongside creatures before. I suppose that was the only difference between a Contract Worker and a Hunter. Contract Workers did whatever they needed to be paid. Hunters wanted to just kill supernatural creatures.   

“Partnering up with creatures for jobs is natural in this line of work. You’ll die if you don’t.” I calmly said.  

“Are you even still human siding with them?!” He shouted again.  

Jacob reached up to rip out the hair elastic August had used to pull back his hair. Utter hatred and rage showed on his face as his wild hair fell. I opened my mouth to defend myself, but no words came. I didn’t think when it came to dealing with supernatural creatures there were simple black-and-white answers as Jacob believed.   

“Almost every contract worker dies because of their job regardless of whether they accept help from creatures or not. It’s your choice to stand by what you think is right and live the life you’re comfortable with.” August said in an even tone.  

Jacob made a noise and scooped up his jacket. I called after him, but he stormed off refusing to even look back. Yes, August was right, Contract Workers had a high mortality rate, but Jacob wouldn’t last two weeks the way he was now.   

“You could have handled that a bit better.” I scolded August.   

“He shot at us. I think I gave him as much respect as he deserved.” He shrugged.  

Something was up with him today. His playful interactions felt almost forced. He didn’t carry the same kind of energy as normal.  

“Oh please. As if that bullet was actually a threat.” I added with a huff.  

“Why are you so upset over this? You didn’t even know his name until today. You’re not his family or even his friend. Who cares if he’s not listening to the advice that will keep him alive?” August questioned.  

He had a point. Jacob and I had different world views and I doubted we would ever get along. I still didn’t want him to die if it could be avoided. I knew people risking their lives was required because of the supernatural threats always ready to strike innocent people. But that didn’t mean Contract Workers or Agents needed to throw their lives away. I didn’t agree with how Hunters did things and yet I wouldn’t want them slaughtered because they couldn’t get past the idea of working with a supernatural creature.   

“He’s human. That means he’s weak. We don’t have power compared to creatures like you. I just wish he accepted help.”  

“Who says humans don’t have the power to deal with us?”   

I noticed August reached up to rub the side of his neck through his buttoned-up shirt collar. I’ve heard the only ones with the skill to bind creatures with a black collar were humans or half-breeds. He had been leashed twice because of a weaker species. Once by using magic and the second time was with love.   

“Is something bothering you?” I asked, directing our conversation in a different direction.  

August considered if he wanted to tell me. He lowered his hand and shook his head.  

“No, not really. If it becomes a thing, I’ll tell you about it. It’s not worth worrying about until I have more information.”  

What did that mean? I didn’t get the chance to ask him. Both our cell phones went off. We checked the message at the same time. August’s face brightened seeing what had just been sent through.  

“Wanna do a job together?”   

An urgent call came asking for help with an ongoing attack. We accepted the request and were on the move in seconds. A door appeared to take us to a different park elsewhere in the world and right into the middle of a fight. I didn’t even have a weapon because I hadn’t expected to work that day.   

We took half a second to look over the utter chaos we had just stepped into. Two Agents in suits were rushing around getting civilians safely away. A third was making doorways to get people away, but also to bring in backup like us. The threat was a massive plant with thick vines lashing out trying to grab any living thing within reach.  

“I need a weapon!” I shouted at the Agent making the doors.  

He pulled out a dagger and three paper charms just as a vine came between us. I was able to grab the dagger and a charm, but I lost two of the papers in the process of avoiding the attack that could have taken my arm off. I didn’t have time to waste trying to get the paper charms I dropped. I ran forward dodging attacks and cutting the vines as often as I could.  

August went to work on a count attack right away. With his sharp claws, he could cut back the vines almost as fast as they recovered. We were separated as he focused more on helping the Agent and I used myself as a distraction. The park was full when this monster plant started to attack. I figured at least ten more people needed to be escorted away.   

Another vine came down just as I noticed a girl hiding beside a trash can. I rolled to dodge the crushing attack then kept going towards her. My heart felt cold from fear. I watched in horror as she was grabbed by the ankle and then dragged across the grass into a large mouth-like pod. I heard screams behind me as more people had been grabbed. August saved me from a vine coming down almost slicing me in half. I didn’t stop running toward the pod with the new victim. I shouted out a request that sounded more like an order.  

“Help the Agents!” I told him.  

He didn’t even take the time to nod. He ran off again knowing his efforts were better used to protect the larger group of people.  

I reached the pod and slammed the dagger into the soft flesh of the plant. I hacked away creating an opening large enough for me to see the girl slowly being dragged further inside. A thick slime from inside the pod hit my hand causing pain. It splashed over my face as I cut. Acid immediately started taking off layers of my skin. I closed my left eye tight to keep it safe from being burned away. It hurt like hell, but I refused to stop.   

Within seconds I had torn away enough of the pod to reach in and grab a hold of the girl under her arms. The acid was much slower at going through the fabric. By some miracle I got her out, the plant recoiling in pain from the damage. She had fainted from the experience, so I dragged her limp body a few feet away. Her back had touched most of the acidic slime. She wore a hijab that was slowly dissolving. If she hadn’t worn so many layers, she would have gotten way more burns. I pulled off my jacket and cut off the sleeves that the acid touched. The rest of the coat was clean. August appeared again and picked up the girl. I wrapped my jacket around her hair and asked him to keep her covered before I turned to keep fighting.  

In the past two minutes, it looked like most of the people inside the park had been saved and now we could focus on defeating the plant monster. The mass of vines parted to reveal a tall humanoid shape growing from the ground. The eyes were closed, and it seemed like the actions were being done on instinct. An odd feeling came from my feet. It was as if the ground suddenly felt hollow. Like I would fall through if I put too much weight on where I was standing.  

I focused on the ground using my sight to see the flow of magic. This plant was draining everything around it. If we didn’t stop it soon it would absorb everything in the ground making it impossible for anything to grow here again.  

A sharp pain came from my only open eye as something inside me snapped. My hand flew over my face as waves of pain rippled from it. I took a second or two to recover and carefully blinked away the pain.  

What I saw and heard terrified me down to my core. I’ve never been so frightened in my life.  

I saw nothing unusual. No plant monster, no flow of magic. No Agents or August. I heard nothing. The air felt so... empty. I shook my head refusing to believe this was happening. I’ve stressed out my eyesight before causing my sight to be blurry but nothing like this has ever happened. Some humans have no sense of the supernatural. They can’t see or interact with magic or creatures. And creatures also don’t see them. For a moment I assumed I stressed out my eyes so much I lost my sight altogether. It felt like a core part of myself had been ripped away.  

Slowly it all started to come back. Hazy at first, but then the sounds of the battle came back in full force. I should have been thankful, but since I could see the plant monster again then it could see me.  

A vine caught my ankle. It lifted my body off the ground, and I was slammed down so hard I blacked out for a few seconds. I heard ribs crack and break. When I opened my eyes again, I was dangling five feet above the monster's wide mouth ready to devour me.  

I’d dropped my dagger. I was beaten and weak. August and the Agents weren’t within range of being able to save me. I needed to think. What the hell could I do?  

I had an idea but didn’t know if it would work. I took my cell phone out from my jeans pocket glad I didn’t keep it in my jacket. I also kept the paper charm in my pants pocket. I stuck the charm to my phone and threw it towards the open mouth just as the creature let go of my ankle.  

The charms are nothing but a bunch of magic inside a spell on the paper. More complex ones do different things, but that one was set to explode three seconds after it was stuck to something. I’d made a makeshift grenade. Somehow, it saved me.  

The magic blew apart the plant's mouth and throat. August caught me in midair and we landed hard on the ground. Now that the plant was weakened the Agents and the backup that just arrived could take care of the rest.  

August carefully put me on the ground. I was barely awake. Everything hurt. While the vine had been around my ankle it had drained my energy. I couldn’t even lift my arm if I wanted.  

“The girl...?” I asked in a weak voice.  

“She’s fine.” August told me.  

For some reason, he used a claw to cut into his palm. I watched in confusion as he started to rub a bloody hand over the acid burns on my arms. I winced in pain but didn’t have the strength to pull away.  

“My blood neutralizes acid and poisons.” He explained.  

“Gross.” I mumbled.  

“We’ll get you to the clinic in a second.”   

At those words, I weakly grabbed at his now dirty button-down shirt.  

“No. It cost too much. No clinic. Just let me sleep.”  

I slumped back to the ground and ended up passing out again. I’d just exploded my phone. I couldn’t take a trip to the clinic for some broken ribs and burns if I wanted to afford a new one.   

I half expected to wake up at the clinic anyway. But I found myself in my own bed. Next to me were piles of fresh rolls of bandages. I was able to sit up enough to look myself over. I was almost a mummy from being wrapped up so tightly in more of those bandages. I knew that these were magic. They sped up healing and would disappear once the magic was used up. I hated to think how expensive all of this would be.  

I heard a noise coming from my apartment. Soon a person came inside the room. I’d never met them before, but I knew a little about her species.  

“Oh, good you’re awake. I’m Raru. I took care of you.” She said as she pulled sat next to my bed.  

Her body looked like it was made of a pastel purple Jello. Their species didn't really have a name, but most people called them Slimes even though their bodies were firm. From what I’ve heard they were on the weaker side magic-wise but could quickly learn skills. For a while, they had been used for less-than-desirable things. Now they had started to be treated much better and worked hard to get respectable jobs.  

“Thank you. Did August hire you?” I asked wondering how much I would need to pay him back.  

“Yes. I’m training to be a nurse and I just need to complete my volunteer hours. All the treatment I did won’t cost you anything because you’re doing me a favor by letting me work on you. But... I only worked on everything above the waist. I understand how people feel about my kind and you weren’t awake to consent to anything else that may have made you uncomfortable.”  

Raru fidgeted in her seat. Her hair was made of the same material as the rest of her body, but she styled it to look like a short bob. She wore plain blue scrubs that matched her profession. I felt bad that she was trying so hard, but some people would never see past her species. The Slimes creatures were recently created race. At first, Slime creatures weren’t sentient. They were dolls that could do simple tasks. So, you can imagine what they were used for.  

“You’re a nurse and I trust you. But thank you for considering that.”  

Her face turned into a smile. I knew she was going to make a great nurse or doctor. I thanked her again and she got ready to leave. We went over how long I needed to rest when I needed to put on the new bandages and things like that. She also told me August dropped off a new phone for me.   

He had already put in his contact information. He also made my lock screen a very cute photo of Lucas which I changed. I did love that kid, but I wasn’t related to him. People may think it was weird I had a photo of an unrelated child on my phone screen like that. Since I was now bedridden for a while, I started setting up my phone again and tracked down the rest of my contacts. It was really to distract myself from thinking about the moment when my eyesight failed me.  

And I was trying not to think about Jacob. I would have died if August didn’t do as much as he did. I simply could not do this job if I didn’t have help from supernatural creatures. I just hoped Jacob learned that lesson before it was too late.
