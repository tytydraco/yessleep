This is my recounting of what happened on February 3rd, 2003, as i had explained to deputy O’Malley. It was ruled vehicular manslaughter, but i was released prematurely, three years after court ruling, after the effects of the bio weapon attacks of December 22nd, 2002, on most of the USA had been completely discovered and partly haltered. 

02.03.2003.

I stepped out of my car, onto the wide, waiting field. No crops were planted. Everything wet and grassy, all that was supposed to fester and grow, dead. I walked toward the car, and pulled out a wooden cross, and a Mallet. The sky was bright, and even though a thick fog blanketed all that was even 12 feet away, the sun stung through. 93 million miles away.

A quiet noise emanated from the distance.

It sounded like nails on a chalkboard, like an animal taking one of its last breaths.

I carried the cross away until my car disappeared completely in the fog. All I saw was ground, that to my knowledge, could’ve been endless in that moment. 

I pounded the cross into the once fertile soil, now reeking of acid and rain. 

Could that be it? Too much fertiliser? Could the animals, utterly gene manipulated and disregarded by the lord, have eaten here and marked it for death? 

I stare at the cross as i fumbled through my pocket in the search of a box of cigarettes. I reread the name on the horizontal piece of wood again, and again. 

I pulled out a cigarette. I flicked on my lighter. 

One.

There that noise went again. Louder this time around, more disgusting.

Pulled out the Geiger counter. 

Whole lot of radiation.

I know that sound. I heard it before.

I approached the source of the noise slowly, and in only a couple of steps to the right, the fog revealed it to me. A dying, pathetic young goat. Barely able to stand on its hooves, collapsing with every step, breathing heavily. 

Its patchy hair is covered in blood, it’s redded right eye protruding from its skull, larger than the left. It’s breathing heavy.

This wasn’t rare for this environment, since radiated animals genetically, altered by man, had been reproducing with anything they could find. The fact that this freak of nature hadn’t yet been eaten by its mother yet probably means it’s infected and completely inedible. 

Poor thing.

Even been happening to humans. Happened to my friend, even.

The radiation here is what’s made this place inhabitable.

I knew I had to put the freak out of its misery, but i hesitated. Its noises made my spine crawl. 

It screamed like it was calling for something to come save it, but there really was nothing beyond this place, but more plains.

“Chirp.”

God that thing sounded fucked up.

I took a drag of my cigarette, and gently picked it up. I walked back over to my car and nicely placed it in front of one of the wheels. 

Twisted the key around.

Stepped on the gas.

Crack

The desperate calling quieted down.

I heard nothing but the sound of my Buicks engine running on.

I leaned my head on the steering wheel.

A pause, finally. I’d been digging all day.

I fumbled for my phone in my pocket, and i flipped it open.

Voicemail. 02.02.2003.

Of course. 

“Dear Damon..” 

I paused. I hadn’t heard her say my name in a while. 

“They’re saying you’re a murderer. Saying you killed a man.

They been calling in and visiting my place, asking me what i know. I’m not sure if you did do it.” 

She pauses, sighs.

“Don’t help that I ain’t seen you in a while.” 

I grip the steering wheel harder.

“It ain’t safe here, don’t matter if you did or didn’t kill Andersen.”

Elaine exhales.

“Please never come back.” 

I broke out in tears.

My finger hovered over the ‘call back’ button, but i decided not to. What would that do. 

“FUCK” i screamed as loudly as i could. My tears weren’t only tears of rage. I resented myself. The stench of death was now more present than ever. 

I started crying uncontrollably. 

First time i did since age 12. 

I stormed out the door, the fog now completely coating the ground around my car. I stepped in front of the fresh grave. 

“Son of a bitch. God damnit. You made me do this to you.” 

My tears intensified. 

“You made me do this to you.”

No response. 

“You asked me for this. Why me?”

No response.

“I know it needed to be done. But why me? 

Couldn’t you have just jumped in front of no great big fuckoff truck on the highway?”

“…”

No response.

I kneeled down before the grave, and looked to the cross. 

‘Charlie Andersen.’

‘Son of Dean Edward Andersen’

I sighed. 

“I’m so sorry. So sorry for everything that’s went and gone. I know your body was giving up on you. Had to make some tough choices. I had to make some tough choices too. Last night I looked up to the stars, but i didn’t quite think of the word. Just saw stars. They reminded me of you. Not how you kneeled before me. Your eyes bloodshot, face swollen, covered in blood. Your frail chest, pulsating with each beat of the heart. Your legs unable to carry you, your feet becoming hooves. Unable to do anything, that’s not the image i have of you. I saw you, walking down the pearl river with me when we were 14. Just strolling.”

No response. 

“Oh well.”

I wiped my tears.

I realised the sun had completely set, and with that, the fog had thinned out as well, revealing the stars.

“There you are.”

I got up, lit a cigarette and started heading back to my car. 

I sat down, and took my phone out of the cup holder. 

No further voicemails.

Beep.

Beep.

No response.

“Dear Elaine.”

I cleared my throat.

“I love you, and I’m sorry.”

I looked out to the field, a silhouette in the distance.

“You’ll see me soon.” 

Not delivered.

I sighed and threw the phone in the cup holder. 

Hrrrugh. 

A convulsing sound emanates from beyond the darkness.

“God, please no.” 

Chirp

I had failed him. 

I reluctantly turned on the headlights, and what i saw, i haven’t been able to get out of my head since.

Its outline wavered slightly, like it couldn’t decide how to hold itself upright. One leg bent the way a human knee would. The other bowed backward at an angle I recognized now, sickeningly familiar. Its chest rose and fell, shallow and uneven, each breath dragging against something that didn’t work anymore.

Hrrrugh.

The sound wasn’t coming from a throat.

It was coming from a mouth that didn’t know how to shape words.

My hands locked around the steering wheel. I couldn’t feel my fingers.

“Charlie,” I whispered. Not loud enough for it to hear. Just enough for me to know I’d said it.

The figure shifted its weight. The headlights caught its face—not fully, just enough to see eyes reflecting back at me. One higher than the other. Both glassy. Both searching.

Not angry.

Confused.

Like something waking up halfway through a nightmare.

“God,” I breathed. “I… I didn’t—”

It took a step forward.

Slow. Careful. Like it remembered once that stepping wrong meant falling.

The Geiger counter, forgotten on the passenger seat, began to chatter wildly.

I thought of the goat.

Of the sound it made when it couldn’t finish dying.

Of Andersen’s legs, giving out beneath him.

Of the way he’d looked at me—not asking, not ordering—just trusting me to end it.

“You said it was enough,” I said, voice cracking. “You said it was time.”

The thing in the headlights tilted its head.

Chirp.

The same sound. Softer now.

My stomach dropped.

It wasn’t coming for me.

It was waiting.

He was waiting.

Waiting for me to finish what I’d started.

I shut my eyes.

For one selfish second, I imagined turning the key. Driving. Leaving the headlights burning and letting the dark take care of the rest.

But even with my eyes closed, I could still see him.

Walking down the Pearl River at fourteen.

Just strolling.

I opened my eyes.

Stepped on the gas. 

And this time, I didn’t tell myself it was mercy.
