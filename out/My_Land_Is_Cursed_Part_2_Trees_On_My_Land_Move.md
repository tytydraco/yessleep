So… I guess my land is cursed. Or maybe this is all random chance and I’m one unlucky motherfucker. It’s been about 4 days since my last post here and I ended the post off with a bit of a promise that: If more spooky shit were to happen, I’d be quick to post it here. It didn’t take long. 

The same night I clicked the post button, I decided I deserved a walk. I enjoy walks, they are easy and calm and good for getting a lay of the land. My little corner of the world is situated in a part of Vermont too small for me to name here, just in case a half-dedicated one of you tries to come and pay a visit. It's rural and quiet. It’s also big as shit. One of the few good things I have to say about the US government is that they have a good selection of private properties for its former dirty-secrets to make a new life on.

My choices were Alaska, Vermont and Montana. I wanted the Alaskan land but apparently someone beat me to it and I owe too many people money in Montana to enter that state's borders safely. Vermont was fine enough, closest to family– I might have already said that but don’t hold it against me– and was overall the largest plot of land available to me. 

I had yet to commit the land to memory so on top of destressing on this walk, I planned on doing the extremely mentally demanding task of memorizing the entire property. Joining me on the walk was a set of knives strapped to my thigh under my shorts, a EAA 10mm Witness 2011 in a holster on my hip, my journal and pen, a cozy sweater, and an old pair of beat up Nike running shoes I’ve had since college. 

On my walk I learned three things. 

1: The terrain of my land is immensely varied. Across nearly 150 acres I had hills, marshes, forest– obviously–, the edge of a mountain range, plots of meadows, plenty of creeks and ponds, and a large lake near the epicenter. Speaking of that lake, I discovered– after skipping a few rocks across it– that a quite irritable creature lives in it. I didn’t get the best look but it was big and pink. There’s a joke to be made there but I’m not brave enough to do so. After it settled down from its fit, it extended a curious crab-like appendage which after a soft pet sank back into the lake. I took out my journal and quickly scribbled a note. “Pick up fish food.” I muttered to myself as I wrote. 

2: Some creature has been ditching its skin in the forest. Piles of rotting skin of various races with the same face were stacked near a pitch of rocks and boulders. Seeing this disturbing sight was… odd, but it's unfortunately the second pile of skin I’ve seen in my life. “Bring tarp and feed the lake thing the skin.” I scribbled out the previous and scratched in the new one. Below that I added: Order trail cameras. I had a technician who was supposed to come out and install cameras into my cabin but unfortunately that wouldn’t be for a few weeks. 

And 3: As I hiked deeper into the most ominous and foreboding portion of the forest I noticed a low hum-buzz under the existing nature ambiance. It was faint and measured, but painfully noticeable when tuning my attention to it. It wasn’t a far away noise drifting along the waves of air all the way to little old me, no it was close. I slowly turned about, looking in every direction to spot if anything else was present with me in the gullet of the forest. It was the noise of presence. That subtle yet spine tickling pressure of another thing being around you. Maybe it was the serial skin-shedder, maybe it was some other fright, but either way I wasn’t prepared enough to find out. 

I hauled my ass back to my cabin at a speed I’m fully ready to brag about. I tumbled inside and slammed the door shut, locking it. I’m fine with facing scary shit. Seeing a threat is nothing new and so having something to look at and understanding how to combat it is a breeze. What I can’t stand is the overbearing weight of an unknown presence. It shivers me to my fucking core and I’d much rather fight a hundred crazies with a stick then spend 5 seconds with that feeling. 

Unfortunately for me, that feeling followed me home. 

I started the next morning with a cup of tea to quell last nights’ night terrors of being pulled apart by beasts made of bone and rotten meat. It’s one of the better dreams I have all things considered. Top 5 at least. I walked out onto the porch and froze, unable to move as I examined my lawn. I hadn’t memorized the entirety of my land, but I knew my lawn down to each blade of grass. I’d know if one blade of my manicured yard was plucked and I certainly noticed the new tree that had sprouted up and matured on the edge of the treeline. 

Sluuuuuuurp. I finished my tea with a shiver as the weight of not being alone pounced on me. I was tempted to grab my FGM-148 Javelin and vaporize it, but incase you forgot from the last post, I’m not a liar. So, I’ll be honest and tell you, I was curious. I’m not one for curiosity, we all know what killed the cat afterall, but I’m certainly one for pushing my luck. 

God’s honest, I just liked the tree. It was a different genus from its peers but it fit in nicely. Besides, how bad could it really be? It's a tree.

I’m a fucking moron.

I should have evaporated that oaky backstabber the second I spotted it. Would have saved me a lot of headache and ammunition. It took a day, a single rotten day, for the entire tree line encircling my cabin to be replaced with towering, dark leaved trees. They suffocated the light attempting to pierce into the treeline and choked any hope of an echo. Not even the most profound of curiosities could tamp down the crushing pressure of having something just over my shoulder. 

Most concerningly, thick and hearty bodied trees had cut off the gravel path that led out to the driveway. By all measures, I was trapped with nothing but me, my house, and an ATF-heart attack amount of munitions. Of my option, none seemed too bright: 1, I get up close and personal to investigate the trees. 2, grab the gallon of round-up in the cellar and hope I can clear the path out to town for some help. 3, unload a small– honestly closer to medium– sized army’s worth of rockets and explosives and raze hell. 4, wait.

None of these choices were smart.

Thankfully I’m not a smart man. 

I wheeled my mortar cannon onto my 2nd floor balcony and set a crate of 50 shells within reach. I lined up the trajectory with the tree line, delicately assuring the shell would drop dead nuts on the first tree that showed up uninvited. Before launching I stacked up other explosives, rocket and human propelled respectively, on the balcony as well. Lastly, I holsted my prize Deagle onto my hip along with my hawkbill. 

Taking a final moment, as the sun lowered; painting the sky in majestic hues of red, pink, orange, and golden yellow, I brewed a cup of coffee. Coffee goes good with fireworks.

“Fire away!” I shouted and sent the first shell screeching into the air. All things seemed to drag to halt as my breath slowed. The hunk of fine american engineering descended and…

“Screeeequuuch!” The tree erupted in curtains of billowing smoke and cackling flame as the leaves melted like sickly wax. The bark slid and smeared as the flames bit. The branches drew into the tree and lost their hue of green and brown. The tree crumpled and collapsed into a pile of scream and reeling flesh. The saccharin meat writhed in agony as gills manifested from the pink and gray pile. A mouth, stuffed with teeth opened and took a titan breath. Its chest bubbled and expanded before shrinking as air blew from the gill, snuffing out the flames. It churned and ached, sputtering through bi and quadrupedal as it ripped off the cooked and charred flesh. 

“Hm…” I loaded another shell and another, dropping 3 total shells on the thing. The second shell struck the center of the beast, blowing off its back half with a whimper. The third drilled straight through the head of the thing. The skull exploded like a popped balloon and threads of flesh tried to hold the skull together but failed as the brain was destroyed.

As it went limp all the tree its-peer collapsed from the form of a sturdy oak into rotten meat sacks resembling the recently deceased. This was a bit concerning. 

“Took me two and half months to getting in a fucking war with the trees.” I grunted angrily as I sloppily adjusted the mortar and rapid-fired shells. Lines of wild flame set a divider between the front of my home and a pack of the shapeshifters. Correctly assuming I was surrounded, I grabbed up my javelin missile launcher and a pack of javelin missiles and walked to the backyard facing balcony. They had begun charging my cabin when I sent out the guided missile. Dirt and soot joined chunks of pink flesh as 6 of the things died. “These are the days I wish I bought that fucking apache.” 

I ran out of missiles before I ran out of targets, a predicament not many are fond of. I still had a bucket of mortar shells, frag grenades, a few cups of napalm, and the weapons on my hip so I liked my odds. I ran to the front and tossed out a wall of napalm that caught an aggressive blaze for the flames of the mortar. A few were midstride, or going too fast to catch themselves before falling into the temperamental flames but a good 50 were still alive in total. 

I leapt off my balcony and tested out my pitching acumen, cooking and pitching grenades into the maws of the rotten bastards. My shoulder is still sore, I’m a lousy pitcher, and frankly I ain’t much of a hitter either. 

Soon I was out of grenades too, realizing a bit too late that I had abandoned the remaining mortar shells on the balcony. I drew my gun and got a clean shot through one of the shapeshifter’s– who I will now refer to as Mockingbirds– head before getting my arm bit down on and torn off.

“Ow, dammit!” I ducked another bite from the creature and drove my hawkbill up through its jaw into its skull and through the brainstem. Another mockingbird pounced on my back, sinking its fangs into my shoulder and whipping me away.

I pinwheeled through the air, shattering my skull against a rock as I tumbled. My spine connected with the stern of a tree, each vertebrae snapping in its own twisted tune. The searing pain died out as the nerves went cold, unable to feel as my head whipped too far back and crushed my brainstem against my cracked spinal column. A final gurgling breath escaped my mouth as I was dead. 

Darkness abounded. I was in an endless plain of all-consuming black. I was sitting. As I stewed there, attempting to comprehend why it felt so familiar, I was wrenched out.

“Agh! Shit… Ow– Wait… why does nothing hurt?” I sprung to my feet, padding my body down to feel for even the slightest hint of pain. Not even a knick. My clothes were drenched in blood but my body was unscathed. The fires had died down and the Mockingbirds had flocked together, around my Deagel. 

I clenched my hand around my hawkbill and took in a final steady breath. 

I rushed forward, thrusting my dagger into the skull of a flailing Mockingbird. The momentum of the beast carried its claw forward and severed my arm. A stream of blood rocketed out but turned into faint steam as a fresh arm burst from the stump. “Okay… alright. Neat.” I retrieved my knife and bolted for my pistol. I took the claws of a Mockingbird to the chest and snapped its neck, leveraging my arm against its claw. The wounds patched and three arms and a head later, I killed 5 more.

I dove for my pistol, getting just a few inches away before being ripped away. My spine vaporized and reconstituted in a blink. I snapped one of the creature's claws off and slept the beast. 

I never even reached my gun. Hours passed, getting eviscerated and killing one, by one, by one, by one. It was surprisingly pleasant. 

Near the end I was just a torso, halfway inside the final, wounded Mockingbird. I beat my fist against its insides till I reached its spine, biting it out as the rest of me dissolved in stomach acid. My body sprouted anew and I wiggled my way out of the slimy carcase. “What does it say about me that this is only my 3rd worst day?” I crawled to my feet. “I’m sure it’s fine.” I squealed as I stretched my new limbs. 

I retrieved my Deagle and cleaned off my knife. The next morning, earlier today, I cleaned up the lawn as best I could manage and began the gruelling task of clearing out the Mockingbirds. I managed to drag down about 8, I say about because a lot of it was chunks, before needing a break. That lands us here. I’m sitting in my lazy-boy, typing this out, watching that deer.

Once I’m finished writing this, I’ll post it, then see get to work fixing my damn lawn. The lake creature is really starting to like me, more since I fed it the Mockingbirds. It finds those really tasty. Maybe I’ll have to hunt down some more, if there are any more. Immortality? Maybe. Regeneration? Definitely. I don’t fully understand how I’m even close to being alive, but I am and that’s a fine enough reason for me to not ask anymore questions. 

Anyways, I won’t keep you any longer. I’ve gotta get back to cleaning anyways. Adios friends. Till the next story I guess.

With my land, likely; not 100% yet, being cursed, I’m sure there is more to come. Peace.
