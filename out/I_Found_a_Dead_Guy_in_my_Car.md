I know how most of these start. “I’m a normal guy with a normal job, my life is normal.” Well let me tell you what happened to me was NOT.

I don’t have to be to work until 10 most days. I was thanking whatever god that’s up there for this arrangement the whole morning as I nursed the worst hangover of my life. The warmth of my coffee seeped through my thermos as I dragged myself down the stairs of my apartment building. 

My hands were full so I used my pinky to open the back door of my car. I let out a big yawn and set my laptop bag in the back seat. When I went to get in the front seat I jumped back, dropping my coffee and letting out an embarrassingly high pitched shriek. 

Sitting in my passenger was a man. He was wearing a tattered suit. Deep reddish brown stained the once white shirt. His skin was pale and his eyes were stuck in a wide stare.  

I guess… I panicked. I kept having irrational thoughts like, If I call the police would they think it’s me who did this? Was it me who did this? Will I be charged  a crazy fee for calling the ambulance? I can’t even afford my WiFi bill! How could I afford to call an ambulance? He’d still be dead even if I drove him wouldn’t he? 

He would be. That’s what I decided. It wouldn’t change anything to call an ambulance. And it wouldn’t change anything to just drive him. So I’ll just drive him to the hospital, explain the situation and everything would be fine. 

 Swallowing my fear and disgust, I got into the car. I sat rigid in the driver’s seat, I started the car and grabbed the steering wheel. I looked over at him again and cringed at his expression. There were slits in his shirt amongst the blood stains. Stan wounds? With a shakey hand I shut his eyes. His seat belt was already on. 

Did I get plastered and go to the morgue? Where the hell did this guy even come from? 

I shook my head and started on the rout to the hospital. The roads weren’t busy and thankfully I hadn’t hit any stop lights driving through town. I couldn’t believe it, no stops, no nosy pedestrians, no police. 

I took a deep breath and rested my head on the steering wheel. I let my eyes shut and that’s when I heard it. 

Breathing.

My whole body jolted up and i saw him suck in another dreadfully wet breath.  

“Ohhhhh no. No, nope. No-“ I yelled desperately trying to unbuckle myself. 

“You’re going to go in there,”His words came out in airy rasps. “and you’re not going to come out.” 

Finally my thumb found the button and I threw myself out of the car. I mean literally, like I fell onto the pavement. My legs kept moving without my permission and I ran through the automatic doors to the ER. 

The receptionist sat calmly chewing gum and reading over something in front of her. She jumped up as I clamored up to the desk.  “How can I-“

“There’s a-there’s-hmmmm” I couldn’t breathe, my heart was slamming against my chest. “There’s a dead body in my car. I don’t know how it got there-I know! I know I sound crazy, but really there is I don’t know what to do or where it-he?it? I don’t know, please you have to help me” I blubbered. I didn’t think it through at all, what normal person would believe a single thing that I’m saying? 

The woman nodded her head slowly and then said, “okay why don’t you just sit down right over there and we’ll get this figured out.” 

I stared at her, trying to figure out if she believed me but then did what she said. I sat down so that I could look out the doors. The view was obstructed with causation stickers, but it wasn’t long before another person walked through giving me a clear view of my car. 

Maybe my sight is going…maybe it’s my mind, but there isn’t a body there anymore.
