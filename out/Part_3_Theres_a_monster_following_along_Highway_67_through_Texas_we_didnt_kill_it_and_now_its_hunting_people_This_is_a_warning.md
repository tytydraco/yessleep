We didn't just go tromping into the scrub. When a cow goes missing there are a few places you check first-- that being, along the fence row and around water sources. B and I decided we would go a couple hundred yards along the east fence until we got to a small pond that was shared by Bob and Maria's property and the county. The herd had come from the north-east, so we figured that would be a pretty good bet. If we didn't find her we would go back to the house and call the local office to report a cow missing and request assistance. If we did find her then Bob never had to know we lost one of his beloved cows and we wouldn't go bothering anybody at 6:34 PM on this fine Saturday evening the day before Bob and Maria were supposed to return.

With every step, I became calmer and more confident in our plan. All our bases were covered and either we would find Dolly, or we wouldn't.

B scanned the spotlight along the fence row and into the scrub beyond. We were both quiet, trying to hear stomping through the brush or the sound of a cow in pain. But all we could hear were crickets chirping, the field mice scampering, birds hopping among the branches. Only when we were a few hundred yards down the row did we see anything notable.

"Fence down," B said quietly.

A thirty-yard stretch of fence was sagging and twisted, tangled with debris. When we last checked the fences two days ago the break hadn't been there. It was a miracle the whole fucking herd hadn't escaped. Normally a fence break is small, from a tree limb falling or a single cow crashing through a weak spot. This kind of chaos would have had to be caused by a whole herd stampeding. Trying to escape. Or something trying to get in.

We followed the path of broken, flattened scrub, brushing aside the grasping claws of woody shrubs. We came into a clearing. I was trying so hard to catch a potential glimpse of Dolly in the encroaching dark that I was slow to realize I couldn't hear anything at all. When that realization hit me, the fear came with it. That awful silence I experienced up at the barn, I was experiencing now. The crickets weren't chirping, the mice weren't scampering. The world was completely still and something was very wrong.

I glanced at B, and her eyes were giant, wet pits of fear and I knew she felt the same way.

We got to the back of the clearing, B's spotlight slicing a wedge through the shadows. And there was Dolly. She was dead, and around her throat were clamped the jaws of the beast that now lurks in my nightmares.

It was three or four times the size of Dolly and looked like a Great Dane. Well, the trellis of a Great Dane draped in skin and covered with thin dark fur. Dolly's blood splattered the scene and the monster's face was covered in a red glaze. Her face was a rictus of fear, eyes glazed and bulging in eternal terror.

("We done had a bunch'o cow-killings 'round these parts," Bob had said, "all up along Highway 67. 'Prolly a mountain lion, they say.")

B yelled "What the fuck, what the fuck--!" and it raised its head, growling. Unthinking, I raised the shotgun in tandem, loaded a shell into the chamber, and pulled the trigger. *BANG*. The blast almost threw me on my ass. Again. *BANG*. The beast jolted backwards and it stumbled into the edge of darkness that the spotlight created. When quiet resumed and only thin gunsmoke filled the gruesome scene I turned to B. 

"Let's get to the house, call the cops. They'll figure out what the hell that thing was. Autopsy, or something. Wasn't some fucking mountain lion that's for fucking sure."

We started to trot back to the house. "You think it was a wolf, Conner?" B asked, subdued "Maybe it got outta the zoo and got all the way out here? Or... or illegal pet trade, yeah? Maybe a black bear?"

"Yeah, yeah it's gotta be something like that." I didn't think that was right, but I couldn't imagine what else --

Wait. Something was still growling.

B had the same realization "It's still--!" We both leaped around, the spotlight jumped and jittered in the dark until it stilled, and there it was. Standing on its hindlegs and completely unconcerned with the two bullets I'd put in its chest. It opened its mouth to reveal glittering teeth the size of kitchen knives and a long thin tongue lolling about. I got the impression it was grinning.

"Holy fuck shoot it shoot it SHOOT IT!" B screamed, and so I did.

Just as the beast crouched down onto all-fours and prepared to leap I emptied the barrel. *BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!* This time I *was* knocked on my ass. B got a hand under my arm and hauled me up and we ran like holy Hell. We had only been about two-hundred, three-hundred yards out, but it felt like two- or three-hundred miles. The field was a sea of pitch and the house sat as a safe harbor, windows glowing faintly with yellow light. In the dim I could see B running beside me, though horrifyingly I could also hear a third body crashing through the brush behind us.

As the house rapidly grew closer B suddenly screamed "SAM! SAM OPEN THE FUCKING DOOORRRR!!!" Sounding like someone had taken a cheese grater to her throat. "OPEN THE DOOR! OPEN THE FUCKING--!" and sure enough the door, only about twenty yards away, miraculously, oh thank Jesus, opened and yellow light spilled into the yard. B and I threw ourselves into the house at such speed we tumbled onto the linoleum, slid across the floor, and crashed into the kitchen cabinets. I could feel the shotgun digging in along my ribs. But that didn't matter. We were safe.

"B, B holy shit, you okay?" I gasped.

"Yeah, holy fuck, holy-- oh fuck Conner it didn't kill it, it didn't fucking kill it. Are you okay?"

"The fuck is going on?" Joey. That was Joey. He had been the one to open the door and was standing with a spatula in his hand. "Weren't you brining the fucking cows in?"

"There's something outside!" I yelled, "It killed Dolly," while B simultaneously said "Oh God, it chased us--"

"The fucking mountain lion?" Joey said, and repeated the phrase like he couldn't believe it "The fucking mountain lion?"

"It wasn't a fucking mountain lion!" I snapped, breathing hard, "Even mountain lions go down when you put six fucking shotgun shells in 'em!"

"Well obviously you didn't 'put six fucking shotgun shells in 'em'! You fucking missed and pissed it off!" Joey was shouting now, the stress of the situation and our hysteria affecting him as well.

"Guys?" Sam said, from where she had quietly arrived in the doorway. We turned towards her. "Let's... let's just call 9-1-1, okay? If it's still out there and it chased you guys..." She trailed off and it was like a lightbulb going off in my brain. Yes, 9-1-1, the cops. They would figure this whole mess out. They would kill it.

B and I scrambled out of the kitchen, while Joey and Sam moved into the living room at a brisk but less panicked pace. Of course they did, no one was hurt and, most importantly of all, they hadn't seen the beast.

In hindsight, I'm not sure why I sprinted to the back bedroom where my phone lay charging rather than using the land line in the kitchen, or even the emergency dial feature on Sam or Joey's phone, both of which they had left in the living room. I guess you don't always think clearly in such a situation, do you? Nevertheless, I gripped my phone like a lifeline and shakily unlocked the screen before calling the emergency line.

"9-1-1, what is the location of your emergency?"

"Yes! Yes, I'm at--"

Just then, a massive crash accompanied by a god-awful, bloodcurdling scream that chilled me to my very bones.

Oh God, it was Sam. I could hear her screaming and Joey yelling, "*SAMANTHA!*"

The operator was in my ear, trying to get me back to the call: "Sir, sir, I need you to tell me what's going on. Is someone hurt? What's your--" but that no longer mattered. I threw myself back towards the living room and my phone, still hooked into the charger, was yanked from my hand.

I expected to seek the beast's awful bulk heaving in the small living room, but there was only Sam hunched in the corner amidst the shattered bay window. Glass covered the sofa and (real maple hardwood) floor, the window frame and along the walls was all splintered and gouged. Joey, still holding that stupid fucking spatula, ran over to Sam and yanked her back to the kitchen. I didn't see B.

I ran over to them. Sam, covering her eyes, mumbled quietly.

"I-I-I picked up my p-phone t-t-to call the police and I-I saw something move outside the w-w-w-window, oh God, it just- just-"

Joey got nose to nose with me, "What kind of fucking mountain lion did you go about pissing--"

"It wasn't a fucking--"

"--off you motherfucker!"

I was about to honest-to-God deck Joey right in the middle of this absolute clusterfuck, but then another crash sounded and the back door explosively splintered apart, collapsing partially inward with a shower of splinters. Shielding my face from the debris I had a brief glimpse of one massive black paw crowned with glinting claws amidst the wreckage. We all stumbled backwards, my mind was flying, rage gone. Holy fuck, it was trying to get in. What to do? What to do?

Another door swung open, the front one, and banged against the wall. The ludicrous thought came to me that the beast had a twin capable of turning doorknobs, but then reality slapped me real fucking quick: it was B. She was yelling:

"The car! Get in the car!"

We ran through the front door like a whole fucking herd of Looney Tunes Road Runners, tumbling into the smelly fabric of B's God-send shitty Ford Focus which B had parked a mere three feet away from the threshold with the doors hauled open. Joey's legs were still hanging when B slammed the accelerator to the floorboard. The little Ford Focus lurched and heaved, spraying gravel as we did a hard right turn away from the house, clipping the entryway.

"Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!" Joey gasped while Sam and I hauled him in. B paid no attention to the chaos behind her, her hands blanched around the wheel. Gone was the laughing girl who drove with her feet for twenty-five straight minutes and who always had at least one hand not at ten-and-two. She was hunched over the wheel and I could see sweat dripping down her face. The house had a long, winding driveway, but B didn't bother following it and took a straight path down the hill with the car bumping and hitching like a roller coaster from Hell. There was still a CD in the dash and it blared in tune with the chaos.

If getting on the county road was a relief, getting to the FM road felt like the first breath of fresh air after nearly drowning. I finally was able to squeeze myself over the center console and contort myself into the front seat. I killed the music and the silence was ringing.

"Okay." I said, the first to break the damned quiet. Then again. "Okay. Let's-- Let's calm down, yeah? We're safe. We get to town, lots'a people around, lots'a lights, we're even safer. We call the cops, figure it out."

"What was that thing?" Sam, sobbed. "Oh, Conner, what was it?"

"I don't know Sam." I said honestly. I began to parrot B's earlier suggestions. "Probs a wolf or bear yeah? Illegal pet trade. They're big motherfuckers and if you were dropped in the middle of unknown-fucking-nowhere you'd go crazy too yeah? Freak out?"

"Yeah..."

Joey cut sarcastically, "Suuuure, so it's just--"

Just then a massive weight crashed into the right side of the car, the window cracked and metal dented. Everyone screamed and the car was shoved across the opposite lane and into the rocky terrain beyond. When B overcorrected, we whiplashed back onto the road. I looked out the cracked window and there the beast was running along the car like a cheetah after a gazelle. It's movements seemed almost lazy, like even this wasn't any effort at all.

B was going 80, much faster than the 55 mile limit. How was it keeping up?

I thought we were safe. A surge of anger flooded through me at the unfairness, we should be safe! Killing Dolly, six shotgun rounds, busting through the house, chasing us all this way. Dammit, did this thing ever fucking quit!?

Things only got worse when the beast raked its claws along the side of the car. B tried to jerk the Ford Focus away but she wasn't quick enough, and I heard the front right tire give away in an explosive release of air as the beast's claws shredded the rubber. Steel crumpled like tissue paper and I knew that the front right side of the car was decimated.

And that's when I felt the cold wind, the hot blood, and the pain. The bottom of my door was in fragments and the steel had curled inward, with long shards lodged all along my leg.

"Oh fuck! Oh shit! Shit!" I screamed. Unthinking, I crammed myself to the far side of the seat, ripping steel from my flesh and the wounds opened with bright red blood. In hindsight I know I shouldn't have done that, if I'd opened a major artery or vein I'd have been dead in two minutes. But the blood didn't begin gushing like Old Faithful and I'm still here. So I guess I was lucky.

The entire car's panic was in the background for me, and gray descended upon my vision. I was about to pass out, but then B dug her nails hard into my shoulder and Joey slapped the piss outta me.

"You better wake up, you motherfucker!" Joey screamed, "You ain't leaving us here with your fucking problem!"

"I'm fine... I'm fine..." I slurred, like I'd drunk a whole bottle of Long Island Iced Tea. Drunkenly, I got my shirt off and pressed it into the wound. Sam's cardigan joined it.

"Dammit B, go, go!!" Joey yelled.

"I'm fucking trying!" B replied, "Tire's fucking busted! You want to get the spare? Fuck! Motherfuck!"

The car limped along like a lame rabbit for several minutes. Sam was pale and frozen in the back seat, a statue of fear with her hands perfectly folded in her lap. She was still quiet though, so quiet that I could hardly hear her. "W-What do we do? What do we do?" Joey put his arms around her, using his body as a blanket, a shield. Something surprisingly tender that I guess I thought he wasn't capable of. "I don't know babe. I'm sorry."

For once, I agreed with Joey: I had no fucking idea what to do. My mind felt fuzzy from the blood loss, and I forced myself to focus on the pain along my leg. It was sharp and helped me stay in the moment. I methodically listed out the supplies we had.  The dash. Car manual. Insurance cards. Center console. Sunglasses. Pine tree air freshener. Change. God, I need a smoke. The trunk full of shit. Two blankets. 24-pack case of water. The gas-- "The gas!"

Joey, all tenderness gone in his response to me: "Gas?!"

"The trunk! In the trunk! B has a can--"

"Well, you better ask that motherfucker behind us to sit still while you douse him in gasoline and light a match!"

I slammed my hand onto the dashboard, "If it doesn't hit him it will damn well distract him! You got a better idea?"

Joey stammered and I took that as a *fucking no*. When I barked "hurry the fuck up, man!" he scrambled to pull the tab of the far left and fold it forward before awkwardly cramming his body into the trunk to pull the can to him.

My leg screamed like a harpy even as I just turned to pass the car manual and my lighter to Sam and Joey.

While he fumbled with ripping the pages and balanced the gas can in his lap, Joey continued on his soapbox, "This really ain't gonna do anything and y'all are all crazy if you think--"

"Joey." It was Sam now, pleading and crying, "please, please just do it." He looked at her for a long moment, nodded, and began shoving pages into the can's opening.

Now, you might be thinking: man, you guys blew the fucker up! Cool! Epic! Some real action hero shit. Well, not exactly. Joey had sloshed the gas over his lap in his haste to unscrew the cap and the smell was overwhelming in the small space. The can was heavy, there was no real room to move and Joey wanted to avoid becoming a human matchstick, so when Sam lit the pages it was not an elegant throw but rather him just sort of lugging it out the window. The results were the same, either way. A line of fire followed the can before it exploded along the length of the trunk. Man, the heat! Like all the sun's energy from an August day beaming on you in a single second. 

The ensuing fire ball overtook the entire back of the car. I saw the beast though. Just a glimpse of it in the flames, horrifyingly close and curved over the trunk, teeth bared, with sparks and smoke slicking over its scant fur. In that split second of unbearable brightness I saw the beast rear up onto its legs, a horse from Hell with the Devil as its rider. Suddenly, the back right tire gave way from the heat with a god-awful, ear deafening *BOOM* and the entire car listed heavily to the right, shrieking along the pavement, and nearly coming to a complete stop. Sam was shrieking. My leg was screaming. The tires were scraping. Through all of this, there was an eerily calm voice in the back of my head: *ah, well, we had a good run but shit Joey was right we're just gonna give the motherfucker a nice ol' taste of Texas BBQ--* 

But then, the beast shrunk. Sorry, that's not a good way of putting it, is it? But that was my first ludicrous thought: *why is it shrinking?* Of course, it wasn't "shrinking" in some magical way or shit-- it just wasn't following the car anymore. Even as the poor little Ford Focus lopped and screeched and went *thunk-flop-shiicccccc-thunk-flop-shiccccc* at a whopping ten miles per hour, it didn't catch up again. It just stood there, and looked at us. Feet from the blazing inferno in the middle of the road, outlined in that fitting, hellish aura.

It remained on its hind legs.

\*\*\*

Things were quiet for seven minutes-and-twenty-five seconds before Joey opened his big mouth.

"I can't believe the fuck-- fucking thing is gone! Why you had to go bothering it in the first place, I don't know. You said it killed Dolly, well, why not wait 'till the damn morning to find the heifer? Better yet, wait 'till Bob got back and let him deal with *his* cows? And- and- B, I appreciate you driving us away, but you went off the road, almost ran me over while doing it. The toes of my tennis shoes are ripped open, what were you--"

I didn't know what happened at first, there was a sudden chorus of screaming and I was jerking forward with a searing line of pain along the join of my shoulder and neck. Goosebumps broke out along my skin and I felt like I had been dunked in cold water. Had the beast returned? Had the explosion only distracted it and this was another attack? Until I realized: it wasn't a razor-sharp claw cleaving through the roof of the car into my shoulder -- it was my seatbelt. B had hit the brakes, face stoney, arms braced straight to the wheel. The little Ford Focus violently jerked to a stop in the middle of the highway, the two intact tires screaming and smoking and sparking.

"What the hell!" I cried. "Fuck, B, what's--"

Joey yelled, "Don't stop the car!"

Beatriz said nothing. Gone was the terror from a few minutes ago, gone was the good cheer from an eternity ago. No, I recognized it as cold, icy rage. Suddenly, a blur of movement. Beatriz yanked off her seatbelt and threw her body over the consol onto Joey. She shook him and Joey's head went back-and-forth like a bobble head.

Sam frantic in the backseat: "B, B-- let him go--\*"

"*YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP! YEAH? YOU FUCKING HEAR ME?*" Beatriz snarled, teeth flashing an inch from Joey's face. "Shut the *fuck* up, Joey. You got a problem with my driving, huh, huh, you little pissant? You got any more fucking smart-ass comments? Well how 'bout you take your chances fucking walking!"

Everyone was silent and, for once, that included Joey. His eyes were huge and shifted side to side nervously. His mouth gaped like a particularly stupid fish and he stammered like a little boy trying to apologize to his devastated mother. "Y-y-you wouldn't throw me out B, I-I didn't mean-"

Beatriz didn't let him finish. "What-the-fuck-ever, Joey." She released him and slowly heaved herself back into the front seat. There, she seemed to deflate, all the anger melting away just as quickly as it began. I could see tears running down her cheeks from the faint light of the dashboard. When Beatriz buried her head in her hands and those tears developed into complete gasping, choking sobs I am ashamed to say that no one, myself included, comforted her.

\*\*\*

We got going on the road again, eventually. The Ford Focus was a trooper and obediently creaked back to life with the revving of the accelerator, though its shredded tire rims screeched their protests with every rotation. That was the only noise, though, and I welcomed it. None of us tried calling emergency services, my phone was left in the back bedroom while Sam and Joey's were abandoned in the living room. I had no idea where B's was and I didn't ask. In fact, none of us talked at all. The entire thirty minutes it took to limp into town none of us said a single word.
