Growing up in an urban cityscape, the steel skeleton of towering skyscrapers and the ceaseless thrum of life became my playground, my life. I am a mailman; an inconspicuous job for an unassuming man, my name's Edward.

The building that always fascinated me was "The Pendulum," a behemoth skyscraper that loomed over the rest, serving as a needle stitching the sky and the city together. It was in that architectural marvel that my ordinary life began to unravel. I started noticing oddities in the letters addressed to the inhabitants of The Pendulum - cryptic symbols, bizarre drawings, and sequences of numbers that defied any logical pattern.

My curiosity kindled, I started probing, trying to decipher the codes. As the days turned into weeks, my obsession intensified, it felt as if these codes were a doorway to a hidden realm, and I was just on the threshold. What I didn't realize then was how much the mere act of observation could become a catalyst for a greater, more sinister reality.

One day, I discovered a pattern. I found that each symbol, each code, foretold the demise of the letter's recipient. At first, I thought it was a mere coincidence, but when the fatalities in The Pendulum began to mount, I could no longer ignore the pattern. A cold dread crawled up my spine, the codes were predictions of death, and they were terrifyingly accurate.

Driven by a mixture of fear and a sense of moral duty, I tried to warn the residents. But who would believe a postman claiming to predict death through letters? I was met with skepticism, derision, and even hostility. It was then that a dawning realization hit me: the letters didn't predict death. I, unwittingly, was the harbinger of it.

It was as if the grim reaper had hijacked my route, using me as his pawn to orchestrate a macabre dance of death. Each delivery I made turned into an omen, a ticking time bomb that exploded, claiming lives. The letters weren't the curse; I was. It felt like I was trapped in a cruel, twisted game, my own life turning into a morbid echo of the dystopian urban landscapes depicted in thrillers. But this was all too real.

It was hard not to feel responsible, even though it all felt like some terrible, surreal nightmare. The city, once a playground, now seemed like an enormous cemetery. And I was the grave digger.

Each day became a tenuous walk on the tightrope of fear and guilt. The weight of the mysterious deaths bore heavy on my conscience. I felt compelled to do something, anything to stop this relentless tide of destruction. But how do you fight an invisible enemy, especially when it seemed to be using you as its primary weapon?

I decided to confront it head-on. I started by studying the patterns more closely. There were numerical sequences, diagrams, and symbols. Some were familiar, others wholly alien. They were all intricately connected, like an elaborate blueprint. The more I tried to unravel them, the deeper I sank into the maze of mystery.

With painstaking effort, I began to notice correlations between the symbols and the circumstances of each victim's death. The numeric sequences seemed to dictate the time of demise, and the drawings appeared to depict the method. This was no simple code; it was a sophisticated language of death. It was terrifying but fascinating in its precision and efficiency.

The knowledge was power, but it was also a curse. There was a sense of impending doom each time I picked up a letter. I could see the cryptic patterns, the fatal sentences handed out to unsuspecting people. I tried to alter the outcomes, to intervene, but it was like trying to stop a runaway train, impossible.

One evening, as I walked my route, I picked up a letter adorned with familiar but dreaded symbols. A chill ran down my spine as I realized what was to happen. An old man, Mr. Fletcher, was the next victim. The realization hit me like a punch in the gut. I had to save him.

But Mr. Fletcher dismissed my frantic warnings as the ramblings of a madman. I couldn't blame him. After all, who'd believe in the existence of death-dealing letters? But I couldn't sit idle; I had to act. I decided to spend the night in the building, hoping to somehow avert the impending tragedy.

The night was filled with tension. I was on high alert, nerves frayed, and senses heightened. But when the predicated time arrived, nothing happened. A sigh of relief escaped my lips. I felt an odd sense of victory. But it was short-lived.

Just as I was about to leave, I heard a crash from Mr. Fletcher's apartment. Rushing over, I found him lying motionless on the floor, a toppled ladder and a smashed light bulb nearby. It was too late. The letters...the codes...they were unerring, almost omniscient.

The subsequent police investigation ruled it as an accident. But I knew better. I had been outsmarted, outmaneuvered. It felt like the unseen entity behind the codes was mocking me, taunting me with its infallible accuracy.

I spiraled into despair, the guilt gnawing at me. I was the postman, the harbinger of death. With each letter I delivered, I was snuffing out a life. The city that once buzzed with life now seemed a ghost town to me, each person a potential victim of my lethal deliveries. I was trapped in a nightmare, with no way out.

But then, I received a letter. It was different from the others, simpler, but the codes were there. I quickly decoded it, and my heart stopped. It was my name. My time. My method. I was the next victim. My life was being dictated by the same unseen force that had taken so many others. It felt surreal, like a chilling echo reverberating through the endless skyscrapers of the city.

In the face of impending doom, I found clarity. If the codes were real, if I was indeed the unwitting puppet in this sick game of death, then I would fight back. I decided to break the chain. I quit my job, moved to a different city, leaving behind the shadow of The Pendulum and the ghostly echoes of the victims.

In my heart, I hoped that by escaping, I had somehow cheated death, that I had outsmarted the codes. But every night as I close my eyes, I still see those eerie symbols, hear the whisper of the city I left behind. There is a constant fear, a lurking dread that the game isn't over. That any day, a letter could arrive at my doorstep, signaling the beginning of another deadly dance.

In my heart, the city still beats, echoing the rhythm of the relentless clock, the pulse of life and death, the ebb and flow of my own fate. And I am left to wonder if we ever really escape, or if we merely delay the inevitable.

So here I am, telling you my tale. Perhaps it's a warning, or perhaps it's a confession. But either way, remember this: Be wary of what the mailman delivers. After all, not all letters bring good news. Sometimes, they carry the weight of a life...or death.
