Hi, my name is Nathaniel Blackwood, and this is my story of how I ruined the world. We all have an angel and a devil, something like a voice in your head that guides your decisions. It could be something as small as a voice telling you to steal a candy bar while another voice tells you to pay for it. For all my life, I have always had an extreme version of that.  
  
For example, if I decide to cook and make the mistake of picking up a knife, there will be an intense screaming in my head commanding me to commit horrible acts of violence.  
  
I am currently writing this because I am looking for any helpful people on this website who can assist me with my situation. But one thing I know is that it started from childhood. I do not know why this has happened to me or why I have been led down the path that I am currently on. But one thing I know for sure is that I am not the chosen one; I am the damned one. There is no hope for me. At the time of writing this, I am over 5000 years old. The events that happened to me took place a very long time ago in a land that no longer exists in this plane of existence. Oh, how I miss it. It was a much simpler time. I'll stop rambling and get on with what happened to me now.  
  
Over 5000 years ago, in the cursed land of Zephyria, a place nearly 4500 years ahead of its time, I was a functioning member of society. But darkness lurked within the depths of this advanced civilization. It was a realm plagued by sinister forces that whispered in the shadows.  
  
It started as mere dreams, innocent fragments of the night. But gradually, those dreams seeped into my waking hours, twisting my reality. I found myself tormented by a voice, a voice that spoke of malevolence and urged me to embrace the darkest desires within my soul.  
  
During one fateful march with the Zephyria army, the veil between realms thinned, revealing a grotesque figure—a tall, shadowy presence with eyes that multiplied and shifted, penetrating my very being. As I turned to confront it, the abomination dissolved into thin air, leaving only a lingering sense of dread.  
  
The voice grew stronger, offering me unimaginable power and wealth, promising to grant my every desire. But as I listened, my sanity unraveled, and the line between right and wrong blurred into a maddening haze.  
  
One horrifying day, a malevolence unlike anything I had ever experienced took control of my being. It gripped me with an iron grip, compelling me to unleash a frenzied storm of violence upon all who crossed my path. I became an instrument of destruction, fueled by an otherworldly strength that defied reason. The screams of the innocent echoed in my ears, but it was as if I was a mere spectator in my own body, unable to regain control.  
  
When the frenzy subsided, I found myself standing amidst the lifeless remains of my once-beloved Zephyria. The landscape was bathed in flames, the air thick with the scent of destruction. I dragged the mutilated bodies into a nearby shelter, their lifeblood staining my hands. In a trance-like state, I etched enigmatic symbols upon the walls, their meaning shrouded in the abyss of my fractured mind.  
  
As consciousness slipped away, I heard a disembodied voice emerge from the depths of my soul. It spoke of a forthcoming king, one who would recognize my deeds and bestow upon me a reward beyond comprehension. But before that, it insisted I accept its curse, a curse that would forever bind me to an existence of perpetual suffering.  
  
Awakening from the darkness, I found myself drenched in the blood of countless lives, yet devoid of pain. The gaping wound on my back, the portal from which the curse emerged, throbbed silently. Stepping outside, I beheld the devastating aftermath—a world consumed by an all-consuming darkness, a testament to my descent into damnation.  
  
For 500 years, I sought solace in death, only to discover an immortality that mocked my tortured existence. Time held no dominion over me, and countless attempts to end my eternal suffering proved futile.  
  
Every 1000 years, the curse stirred within me, ripping open the fabric of my being. Agonizing pain coursed through my veins as a malevolent entity emerged, feeding off my torment.  
  
After 2000 years, I transcended the confines of time and space, an embodiment of ancient evil. With each emergence of the malevolent entity, the world plunged deeper into despair, its light eclipsed by the encroaching shadows.  
  
3000 years marked a realization of my purpose—I was a vessel, a conduit for the darkest forces that roamed the cosmos. The annihilation I left in my wake was not a tragic consequence but an intentional path of destruction.  
  
After 4000 years, burdened by the weight of my malevolence, I became consumed by a desperate desire for redemption. The world lay shattered, a testament to my crimes, and I knew that I alone must repair the devastation I had wrought.  
  
Now, as I reach the daunting milestone of 5000 years, I stand on the precipice of despair. The weight of my sins bears down upon me, crushing my spirit. I pen these words, pleading for help, for a glimmer of hope to guide me towards redemption. The world is at the mercy of my curse, and its salvation rests upon the courage and compassion of those who can pierce the veil of darkness.
