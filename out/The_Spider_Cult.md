"Be careful who you call your friend", my parents used too tell me. They were not good parents, but this was good advice that I never followed. My friends were a special kind of degenerates it seemed. I don't know how I picked these people but I did. My name is Sebastian, but my friends call me Seb, and this is my cautionary tale of what can happen when you don't properly vet your friends.

I pulled into the parking lot and parked near the entrance. I was picking up my friend Layla, and someone named Spencer. Layla was a welfare bum party girl. She was kind of pretty and used it to get free drugs all the time. We had an odd friendship where I constantly got roped into doing things for her and she pretended to help me out in return. She had a boyfriend but I secretly hoped they would break up.

I was woken from my state of deep thought as I saw Layla and who I presumed was Spencer exiting the door.  Layla entered the passenger side door with a smile and looked at me while Spencer got in the back.

"Hey besty, are you ready for a great night?" Layla said sweetly.

"yeah so whats the plan anyway? You didn't give me many details on the phone" I responded.

ll we are going to head to the liquor store and get some booze then lets head back to your place! I have some speed so we can get fucked both ways. Oh this is Spencer! I used to babysit him when we were younger, but hes 17 now and I think its time he tried getting drunk for the first time!"

Before I could even respond Spencer chimed in from the back "I told you me and Denise have drank together plenty of times."

"Who is Denise?" I said a little thrown off.

Spencer pulled out his phone and found a picture and turned it towards me. The woman looked like a troglodyte, she was tall, with short hair and a masculine build. She also appeared to be in her mid thirties which struck me as odd. "She's my girlfriend" He said proudly. "We've been dating for 6 weeks and she's going to be my wife. We drink every time we can afford it."

I felt sick to my stomach. The age on Consent in Canada was 16, so what they were doing was legal, but it still didn't sit right with me. We headed to the liquor store and got a bottle of Peach crown royal, before heading back to my apartment. While we were driving Layla and Spencer talked away, first some raunchy stories about Denise and Spencer, then Layla started talking about how she saw a great deal on Voodoo dolls on the dark web. I knew she was into witchcraft, and I felt a cold chill roll down my spine as I remembered that she had cut my hair for me last week.

We arrived at my apartment and went inside. Layla went right to making drinks and as I took a sip of the Peach crown and and ginger ale concoction I noted how strong it was as I sipped. I put on some youtube videos and we talked while we drank. Layla and Spencer both seemed to be in on some kind of joke that I couldn't figure out and they both seemed hellbent on getting me really drunk. After a while I went to the bathroom to break the seal and when I came out I saw them both giggling as Layla quickly put away a jar. Before I could ask what it was for, she handed me another drink and I forgot about it.

In what seemed like no time the bottle was empty and Layla and Spencer wanted me too drive them to the liquor store again so we could go get another bottle and head back to Layla's apartment.

I sat there drunk as a skunk and said I couldn't drive. Layla then pulled out some speed and said "This will sober you right up". I crushed up a line while they got in the car. After I was done i went to the door and it opened in front of me and Layla was standing there with my empty laptop back pack. I caught her mid sentence saying "We need to find the laptop-" she cut off and stood there looking at me. I grabbed the empty backpack and slammed the door in her face. And you would think that would be where this story ended, but it was only just beginning.

The next day when I woke up I had numerous text messaged from Layla, all angry. Apparently she had sex with one of my neighbors to get a ride home and her and her boyfriend were  fighting. This was also apparently my fault somehow. She denied trying to steal my laptop and said that she had mixed up our backpacks and that Spencer had taken the other one, without her even knowing. Somehow I managed to let her manipulate me into not blocking her and I carried on with my life.

A few days later when I was cleaning up I noticed a large black spider crawling up my dresser. I looked at its shadow, the light passed partly through the spiders translucent body and the shadow had a red tint.  My mind raced, there was no way it was a black widow, we were too far north for them here. I wasn't about to flip it over and look for an hour glass so I just squished it. As I did noticed another smaller black spider crawling on my recycling. I quickly went went to the pile of cans on my floor and when I moved some of them I saw 3 more black spiders crawling around.

My heart was racing and I had no idea what to do. This was a bachelor's apartment, and if these were black widows they would surely get me in my sleep if I didn't kill every one of them. I mustered my courage, put on some gloves and said a prayer before searching through my recycling and killing every spider I found. When  the first spider inquisition was done I had killed 7, including the first one on the dresser. I searched the apartment high and low but found no more spiders anywhere. That night when I went to sleep I thought that I was safe, and it appeared like I was for weeks.

About a month later I was standing in front of my sink, washing dishes when I felt a presence from the spirit world. With my third eye I peered at what appeared to be some kind of spider. It was in the shape of an angel but It had the face and features of a spider.

I then became acutely aware of my body and saw a black spider with a gray skull on its back charging at my foot. I moved just in time and squished the spider under my foot. I put on my shoes and put it too the back of my mind.

The next day I was sitting on the toilet when I felt the presence once again from the spirit world. With my third eye I could see the spider angel watching me, and like clockwork I looked down to see a black spider with a gray skull on his back charging at my foot. I saw him just in time and squished him.

After that I began a second spider inquisition, searching the entire apartment I found something that shocked me. Behind the recycling bin there was a congregation of the spiders. 6 of them had gathered around one in a semi circle and they appeared too be communicating. I was shocked, and felt like I had interrupted a church service. These things were clearly intelligent and I watched the one who was preaching. Why had they not simply bitten me while I was sleeping ? They seemed coordinated, and the preacher was clearly the leader. After watching for a minute I squished them all, it didn't matter if they were intelligent, they were dangerous. That night as I drifted off to sleep I thought once again that I was safe.

Christmas was fast approaching and just as the holidays started I was greeted wit ha third wave of spiders. These ones seemed less dangerous, like every time I had missed only 1 black widow and they were slowly being bread down with the common spiders. I ended up staying with my parents that year for Christmas, even though I can't stand my mother. I thought with my luck I'd end up getting bit on Christmas.

When I arrived back at my apartment after Christmas I began the third spider inquisition. I found 5 spiders and I thought I had gotten them all. That night I sat barefoot on my computer with my legs stretched out. But just then I felt a presence from the spirit world. And when I looked wit  my third eye the spider angel gazed back. Black poison gushed from its mouth as it appeared to scream. Just then I noticed a web by my foot and as I looked under my desk I saw one of the black widow descendants. It looked happily at my foot, moving it legs in anticipation. I quickly squished it and at last my home was free from the spiders.

Though I hadn't seen Layla in person I had continued to communicate with her and on new years eve she convinced me to hang out with her again. Apparently she had liquor and speed and I had no other plans. She said she was throwing a party and a bunch of people were coming, so around 9pm on new years eve I headed over to her apartment.

&#x200B;

When I arrived and entered the room I saw Layla's bf Randall sitting there playing video games while Layla sat next to him, with a salty look on her face.

"You are late" she barked.

I looked around noticing that no one else was there. "Where is everyone else? There is nobody here" I said.

"Spencer  and Denise are coming over later, and my room mate Kelvin is here. And you ruined the party, because you were late we didn't have a drive to go get speed and now we have to go without. This is your fault Seb. You should have been here earlier."

I was taken aback by the audacity of this woman. "Its not my job to drive you around all the time. I thought this was a party? Is anyone else coming over besides those two?"

"You have to stay the night because you weren't here in time for us to get speed" she said menacingly. "You brought your Nintendo switch right? You should set it up so we can play some games!"

I felt trapped and set it up. When I started a game Layla and Randal went into the other room and started talking. I could hear them arguing about Randal sleeping until right before I got here and him being really tired. Layla and Randal came back into the room and sat down. Layla picked up the controller and sat there, obviously full of venom. "I told you never to ghost me Seb. I had to pay a uber to take us to the food bank last month. That cost us money we don't have. and you better stay the night after you did that to us." She then looked at Randal and made a really creepy smile.

I had had enough. I quickly grabbed the switch with one hand and put it under my arm. Then I turned to Layla and grabbed the controller out of her hand and looked for the plastic bag I had brought my switch in. IT was nowhere to be found.

Then Layla jumped off the couch and screamed at me "If you leave now our friendship is over!"

"Whatever" I responded, and headed for the door.

Layla charged after me and tried to grab my hat off my head. I turned around and pushed her with once motion and she flew back and hit the wall. She stood there stunned for a second and then I saw the the spider angel upon her face and all the dots connected. The jar, the spiders, the dark web. She had bought them off the dark web and left them in my apartment. She then swung at me with a roundhouse punch and the look on her face was of spider induced  elation. Now I had seen Layla beat Randal like a dog but she had never tried to hit me before, and when she did my karate training came into play. I reacted so fast that the punch didn't even land. My hand suction cupped to her face like a tentacle and spun her head 180 degrees, exorcist style. I then sat there with her head in a corkscrew. She struggled, doing anything she could to get a bite on me. I thought for a second about what kind of spider I would have woken up to biting me if I had stayed the night. A black widow or something worse? I shuddered and launched her head in the air. Her spine moved like a board as flew up into the air with her head spinning.She went perfectly vertical for a second and hovered, before falling straight down, landing  square on a carton of cigarettes. Her head hit the floor with a thud.

Randal cried out in anguish "Not the cigarettes!" hope left his eyes as he looked to the floor. Layla lay there for a second, stunned, before gathering her energy and jumping to her feet.

"I'll kill you!" She screamed at me. She then seemed stunned as her jump had drained all the blood from her brain. And turned around and starred in devastation at the carton of cigarettes.

With the switch still under my left arm I headed for the door, seeing Kelvin come into the hall as I left. I got home before midnight. Randal texted me, telling me to come back and apologize to Layla. I blocked him and thought I was finally safe. Little did I know it wasn't over yet.

A few months later I was hanging out with my friend Lyle. He worked 2 jobs as a dishwasher and had dated Layla briefly while we were still back in high school. We were in my apartment, smoking weed and snorting speed, shooting the shit when I brought up what had happened with Layla. I told him in detail what had happened, and my suspicions about the black widows, along wit  where she had acquired them. Lyle sat there looking at me deep in thought, and when I was done he said "I've heard you tell some crazy stories but that takes the cake dude. Are you sure they didn't come in pack of banana's or something?"

"I'm sure dude, she left them here and bought them on the dark web, 100% sure." I said.

Lyle looked sullen and nodded. We had been friends for what felt like forever, and I trusted him.

The following spring Lyle fell on hard times. He lost both his dish washing jobs and he had to start pawning his stuff for money. He messaged me one day about getting a drive to the pawn shop; His ID was expired, and he needed me to pawn his tablet for him so he could get cash for drugs.

He biked over to my apartment and knocked on the door. I let him in and he started talking about how much he needed the money, saying he would buy me lunch and give me 40$ for selling this drawing tablet he had. He said it cost 500$ when he got it so he was hooping for 200-300 for it. Before we left he went into the corner and I almost thought I saw a jar in his hand. I trusted him and took little notice and soon we were at the pawn shop negotiating a deal for his tablet. I ended up only getting 150$ for it and as me and Lyle walked back to the car he seemed way to happy about the paltry sum we got for the tablet. I was getting weird vibes and I told him Id take an extra 20$ and called off lunch. He still seemed super happy though, I brushed it off as a junkie needing speed. He left when we got back and I went inside.

Later I was taking a dump when I felt a presence from the spirit world. I looked with my third eye and saw the spider angel once again. I then noticed a large full black widow sitting on the roll of toilet paper. I could feel Layla's energy, like she had been talking to it, telling it to bite me. Its legs moved in a dainty way as it looked at me with anticipation. I quickly squished it and headed to my computer. My mind was racing, I had to kill them all before they breed this time. I was doom scrolling on facebook when I saw something that shocked me. On the computer screen in front of me I saw dozens of hands meshed together in the exact shape of the spider angels face. I stopped, dumbfounded by what was happening, and saw a black widow charging across the floor towards me. I squished it and began the 4th spider inquisition.

I found only 1 more black widow, on my headboard waiting for me too fall asleep. And in addition I found 2 regular spiders, killing both of them. That night I looked at my bed and decided not to sleep in it. The spider on my headboard made me decide to sleep on the coach that night. After I turned the light off and laid down I saw a spider crawl out from behind the curtain. In the dark I could see it looking at me with one searchlight eye. I felt paralyzed for a second as I realized the searchlight eye was a tell tale sign of a banana spider.

I got up and turned the light on, and quickly went over to the spider to inspect it more closely. IT had long red legs and as I took shoe to squish it jumped towards me and fell behind the curtains. For a moment I wondered what to do as one of the worlds most venomous spiders was on the loose in my bachelor apartment. Just then It climbed from behind the curtains again and I squished it. Looking at its red legs on the bottom of the  shoe I could feel death. Had it bitten me I would have sat their paralyzed for about an hour, with a massive erection before I died. I thought about calling the police but I knew they wouldn't do anything. They would probably try to send me to jail, proclaiming that I had bought the spider off the dark web after they heard what I had to say.

I awoke the next day and blocked Lyle. Karma would catch up with him I hoped. I thought about what had happened and wondered if Lyle had been in on it from the beginning, or had had just joined in after I hung out with him last. He had clearly talked to her since then and been indoctrinated. The only thing that didn't make sense that morning was how I had survived those nights with the black widows in my apartment. I searched the internet that night and found a Vietnamese superstition about spiders. Vietnam was where the banana spider was from and I took the superstition to heart. It said that when people sleep their souls enter the bodies of spiders. I thought back to the preacher and knew my soul had entered it while I slept. I felt my mind rush with memories of the spider preaching a religion to the spiders, where I was some kind of god to them. From what I remembered It was against their religion to attack their god while he was sleeping, and that had been why I had been sparred in my sleep.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And with that this cautionary tale comes to a close. I know you may find it hard to believe and I wish I had taken pictures of the spiders for proof, but alas I did not. I sometimes wonder if I should have called the cops as well, but alas I did not. There is a lesson here you see. No matter how well you treat someone, they can still betray you. My friends betrayed and tried to murder me, one I had known most of my life and the other I was nothing but good too.
