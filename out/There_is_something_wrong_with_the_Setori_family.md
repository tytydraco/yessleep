There is something wrong with my family.

When I walked through the door after spending two days at a slumber party, the house smelled of… bacon. 

Holy shit. 

Mom was actually cooking dinner. 

Which was crazy because Mom *never* cooked dinner. 

She was either at work, locked in her home office on the ground floor, or in her room complaining of a migraine.

We never ate Mom’s cooking because she never cooked for us.

My brother Fitz once joked she would cook us an Excel spreadsheet, or throw her iPhone in the air fryer to make a stew. 

He was almost right.

A few months ago, Mom microwaved her iPad. 

We weren't really an *eating together* type of family. Sure, we had the white picket fence and family SUV. 

We greeted our neighbours every day with nuclear family smiles. Mom was the head of her book club on her days off, and Dad worked in an office. From the outside, we were your average Brady Bunch. My best friend had even commented on it. “Ruby, your family is so close! I wish mine were like yours!”

*Close* couldn't have been further from the truth. 

Keeping up appearances is all we had to do in front of the locals. 

I smiled my biggest smile and wore my hair in a *perfect* ponytail. 

Fitz and Cassie followed suit, playing their part as nuclear children. 

That is what Mom wanted us to be. However, our dollhouse wasn't as *perfect* as perceived. Inside our so-called forever home, we were a disconnected group of lodgers. 

Mom barely spoke to us, and when she did, she was enforcing *yet* another rule. 

Don't go into the living room unsupervised. Don't go into the basement. Don't eat food outside of the kitchen. Don't wear your shoes inside. 

Mom had different rules tailored to each of us. 

For me, I wasn't allowed electronics after 8pm.

Fitz, who was one year older, had a set curfew of 9pm. 

Cassie could only eat fruit and vegetables on Wednesday. 

Snacks, candy, and chocolate were banned for all of us. 

We weren't even allowed to sit on the living room couch. Mom was terrified of us ruining it, so we had beanbags. 

When I first got a whiff of bacon, I was convinced either our house was burning down, *or* my brother had finally gotten tired of his Uber Eats diet. 

Fitz wasn't a cook, though. 

Christmas 2019, his turkey dinner gave us all food poisoning. 

I was slipping out of my shoes and hanging up my jacket, when a familiar voice tinkered from the kitchen. 

“Ruby, sweetie? I’m making dinner if you're hungry!”

It smelled amazing, whatever it was. 

I was in disbelief, walking into the kitchen to find my Mom standing over a bubbling pan. 

“Can you set the table, honey?” 

Fitz and Cassie joined us, followed by Dad.

“Smells good, Mom!” Fitz jumped into his seat with a grin. 

Which was definitely odd for him. Normally, the guy took 5 working days to sit down. 

Cassie slid past me, ruffling my hair. “Hey, sis!”

My family were acting *different* in general. Cassie was unusually smiley, not the bratty teenager she usually was, while my brother dropped his patronising smirk and *I'm better than you* attitude, for a more laid back vibe. 

Usually, my brother and sister were insufferable. 

Cassie always had to bring up how much she hated all of us. 

Fitz wouldn't rest until he had the last word, and Dad’s face was beet red. 

Now, it was like they'd had a personality purge. 

Fitz caught my eye, his lips curling into a smile. 

“Yo.” He saluted me with two fingers, which was *not* my brother. 

Fitz Setori greeted me with a scowl or a pretentious movie quote. 

Before I left for the slumber party, he wouldn't shut up about a black and white French movie only *he* had seen. If Cassie and I liked a movie, he hated it. If he liked something, Fitz made sure we *didn't* like it. 

My brother’s wardrobe was like he was trying to cosplay Sherlock Holmes, and I still didn't understand *how* he had friends at school. The thing with my siblings was, I missed them. It used to be the three of us versus the world (and our dictator-like mother). But since starting high school, Fitz had turned into this pretentious film freak with an obsession with being right, and Cassie was sixteen going on twenty one. 

Presently, my brother’s demeanour was more relaxed, not the stiff uptight bullshit he usually was, always trying to get ahead of the conversation and prove himself right. In the corner of my eye, I could have sworn something *flashed*, a bright light filling the edges of my vision, like a polaroid was being taken.

Fitz didn't notice. Leaning over the table, he stabbed his fork into my steak, speaking through a  mouthful of mashed potato. “Are you eating this?”

I shook my head, watching in disbelief as he took my whole plate, inhaling my food too. 

Cassie, who was always glued to her phone, gave him a playful shove.

Well, that was weird. 

The two of them couldn't go one day without trying to rip each other's heads off. I don't know what baffled me more. 

Seeing my siblings sitting together, shoulder to shoulder instead of avoiding each other like the plague, or the fact that Cassie was yet to announce that she hated all of us, and couldn't wait until college. Which usually followed with Fitz saying, *“What college?”* and ending up with a face full of food. 

But it didn't end there. 

Because, when they were sent to their rooms, they continued, snapping at each other with passive aggressive remarks until they were physically trying to murder one another. The craziest part is, the two of them used to be so close. 

If Cassie didn't throw a death threat at Fitz, it wasn't a normal Seteri dinner. 

Now, I was watching them nudge each other like they knew something I *didn't*. 

“Okay, *what* happened while I was away?” I spoke up, toying with my fork.

“Hmm?” Mom settled me with a smile. “What do you mean?”

I bit my tongue, waiting for Dad to intervene with a cough. 

When we did eat together, which was rare, Dad wasn't a fan of talking at the table. When I risked a look at him, though, Dad was happily chewing through his meal. He caught my eye, grinning through steak juices running down his chin.  “Isn't it a wonderful day?” 

He nodded for me to continue, a crunching noise twisting my gut. 

Dad was grinding through the steak bones.

He stopped, slowly inclining his head. “Ruby, are you okay, darling?”

I felt my fingers tighten around my fork. 

Dad never called me *darling*. 

He made it clear I wasn't the favorite child, making little effort with me when I was a kid in favour of Fitz and Cassie. 

It was always those two who he spent time with. I remember sitting outside the basement door with cookies, waiting for Cassie and Fitz to come back up the stairs. They were down there for hours, sometimes a whole day. 

The only bonding I did with my father was when I snuck down there myself. 

Dsd was always working, so I stuck around, usually spinning around in his chair or poking things I shouldn't poke.

I was still struggling to process *darling*, mashed potato creeping back up my throat, when Fitz kicked me under the table. His smile was unnerving me, the way he and Cassie kept grinning at each other, like they knew something I didn't. 

It was just like when we were kids. 

Fitz was trembling, trying and failing to hold in laughter. 

“What's going on, Ruby?” He choked, before bursting into childlike giggles. 

Cassie joined in, her smile stretching wider and wider. 

Something ice cold trickled down my spine. 

*Too many teeth.*

“We never have dinner together,” I said pointedly, glancing at Mom. “Unless you're impressing a work colleague.” 

I turned to Fitz. “You barely come out of your room, and when you do you're insufferable.” Fitz only smirked, and I moved onto Cassie, who wasn't fooling me with her innocent smile with far too many teeth. “And you only come downstairs when you want something.”

There was a pause, before Fitz exploded into laughter. 

Cassie started giggling, and to my confusion, even Mom was trying to hide her smile. 

My rule obsessed, fun-hating mother was barely holding in her own hysterics. 

Dad wasn't laughing. 

Dad was still fucking grinding bones between his teeth. 

I stood up, which made my brother howl harder. 

“What's so funny?” 

My family didn't respond, snorting like middle schoolers.

I snatched my plate up from Fitz. 

“You're all fucking sociopaths.” 

I waited for the inevitable chastising for swearing. I stubbed my toe a few weeks ago, accidentally saying, *fuck* and Mom almost had a nervous breakdown. 

She said my vulgar language was a problem that would be solved by taking away my phone for a week. But this time, Mom didn't even notice. She was still eating, stifling her own snickers.

I was planning on heading to my room, but I couldn't help it, making a detour down the hallway. 

Dad always told me to look at the teeth.

*Too many teeth was bad*. 

Too many teeth meant something was *wrong*. 

Mom immediately noticed, her shadow following me. 

Another flash of light behind me, and this time I could hear a shutter sound. 

“Ruby, where are you going?” 

Twisting around, my mother was smiling at me. I blinked, and the hallway I had known my whole life suddenly appeared warped, like it wasn't real, like it was slowly closing in on me, and my destination was getting further away. 

With panic rising in my chest, my hands searched for a door that was no longer there, bleeding into the wallpaper. Another flash. This time it was brighter, filling the dark with light that didn't make sense, a blinding white blur fraying the edges of my vision.

But where was the camera? 

“Ruby.” 

I blinked again. 

Mom was standing closer, her smile wider. 

“Is there something wrong?”

I found my voice. “What was that light?”

Mom did a slow head incline, mimicking my brother. “What light?”

I was growing progressively more paranoid, my hands shaking. 

“Is someone taking photos of me?” I whispered. 

Mom’s plastic grin didn't waver. “Photos? What do you mean, sweetie?”

I managed to shake my head, pushing past her. 

“Nothing.” I said, “I'm okay. I'm just tired.”

Mom nodded, and I could hear Fitz giggling behind me. 

When I looked, however, there was nobody there. 

Still, my brother’s shrieks of laughter followed me all the way to my room. 

Only stopping when I slammed the door.

4:01am. 

There was a figure standing in my doorway. I thought it was a trick of the mind, but no, there was someone standing inside my room, peeking through their hands. For a disorienting moment, I was frozen. I couldn't move. 

“Fitz?”

When I sat up, I was blinded by that same light, the unmistakable sound of a camera shutter filling the silence. 

The figure didn't have a face, a shadow hanging over my bed. But looking closer, it *did* have wide, laughing eyes peeking through its fingers. Keeping my gaze glued to the figure, who was very slowly uncovering its eyes like playing a game of peek-a-boo, I reached to switch on the light. 

The shadow ran away, though I definitely saw my brother’s dark red hair. 

I didn't sleep well that night. I kept waking up. 

The laughing had stopped, but I could still see Fitz’s unmoving shadow. 

His feet under the door. 

All night. 

Obviously, I called him out on it the next morning.

“What were you doing last night?” I demanded, trying to force down toast. 

Fitz acted oblivious, because of course he did. 

“*What* did I do?” he teased, wearing that smirk I wanted to carve off of his face. 

“You stood outside my door all night!”

Fitz chuckled into his glass of juice. “You caaaaaaan’t prove it.”

Mom was yet to get ready for work, eating cereal from the box. 

She was halfway through a bottle of wine when I came down for breakfast, laughing hysterically at a refrigerator commercial. 

Usually, my mother was gone before I woke up. Not to mention, we weren't allowed to eat cereal for breakfast. 

*It was always health food crap.*

“Mom.” I gritted out. 

Cassie was making coffee behind us, joining in with the theatrics. 

My sister *hated* coffee. 

“Mom!” I yelled, when my brother winked at me. 

Mom ignored my complaints, kissing the rim of her glass. “Be a doll, and go get Mommy’s favorite vino from the basement,” she downed the rest of her wine, tipping her head back and blowing strands of hair from her eyes. 

“You know,” she sighed, “The expensive one.”

“Don't you have a job to go to?” I glanced at my phone. “It's almost eight.”

“Mmm.” Mom rolled her eyes. “Maybe later.”

My workaholic mother who went to work with gastritis, and had even forced Fitz to go to school with the flu, was acting like a drunken teenage girl. 

Mom’s whole life revolved around perfect attendance.

She *scanned* our report cards for tardies, threatening our phone privileges if we were a minute late for class. 

Suddenly, I was the one who felt like a mother. 

“Mom, you need to go to work.”

“Yeah, Mom!” Fitz mocked my voice, leaning his chin on his fist. “You need to go to work!” 

Mom settled me with a patient smile. I thought she would get mad, though she seemed amused. “Mommy wants a drink, darling. Fetch me the wine.”

I nodded, standing up. 

*Anything to get away from these psychopaths.*

My siblings' laughter followed me, once again, out of the kitchen. 

Down the hallway. 

Before stopping abruptly, when I stepped in front of the basement door. 

Reaching out with shaking hands, I grasped the handle.

I hadn't been down to the basement in a while for a number of reasons. 

Heading down stone cold steps, I used my phone light to navigate the darkness. I remembered the exact way I used to jump down them as a kid, two at a time, squeezing the handrail tightly. 

Sometimes, Cassie joined me, the two of us holding hands.

I recalled the time we used to run up and down the Miller family stairs. 

Cassie and I would sing a song, the two of us giggling nervously. 

*One step, two step, three step, four.*

*I can hear a human knocking on the floor!*

There was no sign of my mother’s expensive vino when I stepped inside the Setori family basement. It was exactly how I remembered it, a single observation bed, my Dad’s desk filled with research. I wasn't supposed to look at them, because it was dangerous. 

Instead, I focused on the strange looking machines and rows of metal shelves filled with an assortment of jars. 

When he was fifteen, Fitz opened one up. 

He didn't tell me what was in it, but he was violently sick for days. 

Further into the basement, I could sense their shuddering breaths. 

*”Do not look, Ruby.”* Dad always told me.

But I couldn't help it, risking a glance, the breath catching in my throat. 

Five slumped figures, each of them brutally tied back to back under a single buzzing bulb.

My parents’ prisoners. 

Riley and Connor Setori with their teenage children Fitz and Cassie, and then of course, the girl who made me. 

The reason why I was alive and breathing.

Ruby Setori. 

I want to preface this by saying it was never my choice that I became Ruby. 

Dad was insistent, and as a kid, I followed my parents. 

My family and I were born in a lab as Mimics. 

There were three Mimic families, though we were the only survivors. I've only ever known mimicking, and being forced from person to person. It's kind of like shape shifting, but we need human bodies and voices to survive. 

Human voices make us real. 

My siblings were born after me, but something was wrong with them. 

I don't really remember it, but I used to live in a white room with sponge walls. 

Fitz and Cassie were in the room next to me. The people in white spoke of failures and more tests, and my brother was so weak, while my sister was spitting up blood. They concluded that their original forms were dying. 

A default body for a mimic is a faceless being with no discernable features, a shadow you swear you see in the corner of your vision, what you think is a trick of the mind. With my old body, I could explore the darkness and creep into the corner of any human’s eye. I started to get better. Voices were hard at first. 

You have to get the exact tone, and once you have that, you can latch onto the body and brain. My first successful mimic was a scientist named Doctor Carlisle. 

His voice didn't make sense to me, but I was able to replicate it and use it to my advantage. When we escaped the lab, my father broke into the Miller house. 

I was too young to really understand, but my Mom urged me to mimic their youngest daughter. 

Elizabeth. 

Elizabeth was a lot more comfortable to mimic. 

I spent 8 years being Elizabeth Miller, before we were forced to relocate. 

The family we were impersonating were growing suspicious of us, and my brother was getting progressively sicker. He couldn't acclimatise to a body. The Miller son almost killed him, and he only embodied the kid’s voice. 

The Setori household is where we struck gold. 

Fitz Setori, sitting in front of me, blindfolded, was my brother’s saving grace. 

When I was twelve years old, my parents kidnapped the Setori family and forced them into their own basement, immediately stealing their faces. 

I remember Ruby Setori sitting cross legged on the floor, her wide eyes filled with tears. 

Dad said I had to talk to her to form the connection. When she refused to talk back, my father was forceful. 

Our first conversation was me mimicking her sobs, her throaty cries for me to get away from her. 

With Ruby’s voice, I asked her questions. 

Mom told me I had to talk to her, before the bond was severed. 

“What's your favorite color?” I asked, swirling her voice around my mouth.

“What did you do to my family?” Ruby squeaked.

I looked at my dad for help, and he shook his head.

“Ask her again.”

I took a deep breath. “What is your favorite color?”

“Pink.” She whispered. 

“Pink.” I repeated, leaning closer. 

“Please.” Ruby said. “Please don't hurt me.” 

“Please.” I said, clinging onto her tone, the exact indentation in her speech. 

She cocked her head, and I did too.  

“Please don't hurt me.”

“I'm not going to.” I told her, when the invisible ribbon binding us together tightened, entangling. This time I was speaking over her. My face became Ruby Setori. Thick brown hair and wide eyes, lips parted in a silent cry. 

“I promise I'm not going to hurt you.” 

Ruby stared at me like I was a monster. 

She shrieked, stumbling back, only to be forced back into place by my mother. 

Dad told me mimicking had three stages. 

Voice. 

Body. 

Mind. 

I already had Ruby’s voice, and I was wearing her face. 

Her memories hit me like a tidal wave, warm and cosy. 

I saw her perfect family, all of her friends, growing up behind a white picket fence and a fluffy dog called Cosmo. Ruby liked orange soda and ice cream. She was smart at math, but got her words mixed up. She loved elephant plushies and the Disney channel. 

The human girl was scared of the dark, scared of what *lurked* in the dark. 

*Scared of me.*

I wanted to tell her I *wasn't* a monster. 

“Ruby.” I whispered, “I'm sorry.”

She didn't move, and something slimy erupted up my throat. 

Ruby’s expression was frozen in terror, her mouth slightly open, eyes wide. 

“Ru… by.” The girl’s voice was a strangled cry. “I’m… s… ooooorry.”

I lurched back, swallowing a cry. 

Ruby Setori was mimicking *me*. 

Which was the final stage. 

I went through it as a little kid, but I was too young to remember assimilating with Elizabeth Miller. 

My brother's assimilation was different, and a lot more brutal. 

Fitz Setori did not want to have his face and voice stolen. 

He escaped four times, attacking my mother, despite her wearing his own Mom’s face. My brother was gentle, kneeling in front of him and speaking in soft tones. My sister and I watched from the corner of the room, too scared to go near the unpredictable human boy. 

“Hello.” My brother was too sick to stand. “Can you… tell me your name?”

Fitz spat at him.

“Fuck you.” The fourteen year old hissed, “You're not taking my voice.” 

“Fuck… you.” My brother mimicked, already taking hold of the boy’s tone. 

Fitz shuffled back. “Get away from me!”

“Get… away… from me.” My brother copied.

His nose wasn't bleeding this time, and very slowly, he adapted Fitz’s face. 

It took a while, and a lot of screaming and crying. 

I didn't want to watch, but I was also curious about how human children were supposed to act. I was never in a stable body enough to fully adapt to emotions. Fitz was feeling panic and fear and anger, all of which I decided to copy.

But my brother did manage to mimic Fitz Setori. 
 
Mr and Mrs Setori begged my parents to let their children go. 

But my dad needed the Setori kids. For our survival. 

Cassie and I sang another song, this time to block out the screaming.  

My family took over the Setori household, and slid into our roles as the not quite perfect family on the quiet suburban street. Growing up, Dad insisted on daily tests to make sure our bonds with the Setori siblings were still intact. We were forbidden from talking to them. 

Presently, I couldn't stop myself.

There was something *wrong* with my family. 

And I had zero doubts the family had something to do with it. 

Dad had drawn a line on the basement floor. 

We were acquired to stay behind the line, unless we wanted to be grounded until college. 

Stepping over it, I shivered, my bare feet grazing warm blood pooling across the floor. Mom and Dad were always protective over the basement. They told us the Setori family were safe and unharmed. But that was hard to believe even my parents *resented* humans for creating them, and torturing them. 

What my parents did to the human was a whole other level of torture. 

Especially the adults. 

Mr and Mrs Setoti had been in a medically induced coma for almost four years. Their heads were bowed, plastic tubes sticking directly into their skull. 

Cassie Setori was awake. I could hear her breathing. 

She was pretending to be out of it. 

Fitz Setori had been *fixed* by my father a year ago. 

Dad said his behavior was too ‘dangerous’. 

One minute the boy was screaming and threatening, and the next, he was  silent, drool seeping down his chin, head tipped back, blinking at the ceiling. 

The *fixing* was in case Fitz ever managed to gain control of my brother. 

When I crouched in front of the Setori siblings, I felt a deep, twisting guilt eating me up inside. 

They were barely human anymore, stripped of their terrestrial bodies, atoms and static and a shadow of what once was. The blood made me nauseous, splattering their arms and legs and clothes they were growing out of. 

Ruby’s hair was almost at a Rupunzal length. I wanted to see the good in that, maybe call her a princess, though maybe she was more of a Sleeping Beauty, forced into slumber. 

Fitz had aged way beyond his age, bearded like his father. 

Cassie’s pigtails were touching the floor. 

I pretended not to see the restraints cruelly binding their wrists, the burn marks branding them as ours. 

The three were skeletal, pale and malnourished. 

Humans who were anything but. 

My stomach twisted when I peeked under Cassie’s blindfold. 

Her right eye was gone, scooped out of its socket. 

Dad didn't have to hurt them. 

He didn't *have* to tie them up.

But I know what humans are like. 

They are scary and unpredictable and will murder their own kind. 

I did try to talk to them before Dad *fixed* the Setori son. 

Fitz, Cassie and me. 

The Setori siblings told us we were dead. 

That they were going to kill us slowly, an painfully. 

By slicing their own throats. 

Fitz tried to argue that it wasn't *us* who did this. 

Only for his original to call him a piece of shit. 

Ever since then, Mom put a lock on the basement door. 

I was trying to loosen Ruby’s ropes, ignoring my father’s earlier warning, when a familiar light filled the room. 

A camera flash. 

When I stumbled to my feet, I was alone. 

A giggle caught me off guard. 

It was Ruby Setori herself, her lips split into a grin. 

“Can we play a game?” She asked. 

Her voice was made of static, barely a whisper. 

The girl wasn't supposed to have her voice.

*My* voice. 

I held my breath. I had to be tactical with my speech. 

“What did you do to my family?”

“I have a better question,” she said, growing stronger. She lifted her head. I could hear her straining against the ropes. “What's your favorite color?”

“Pink.” I said. “What did you do to my family?”

In the corner of my eye, I detected movement. 

There was something at the other end of the room.

*Twitching.*

“What about your favorite TV show?” Ruby asked, leaning forward. “You must have one. Maybe it's even mine!”

It *was* hers, and she knew that. 

“Buffy the Vampire Slayer.” I said, my mouth filling with blood. 

Just like Dad said, our bond was severing.

If I continued to talk to her, I risked detaching from her completely. 

Ruby Setori wanted her voice back. 

“I love Buffy!” The girl’s smile was, dare I think, genuine.

“How about we talk about your brother? Is he doing okay, Ruby? Is he acting…“

She paused, sucking her teeth. “Kinda weird?”

Upstairs, I could hear Fitz’s laughter getting louder and louder. 

“Please.” Ruby  was mimicking her younger self.

Even blindfolded, I could see the gleam in her eyes. 

*“What did you do to my family?”*

Her words forced me into action. 

I prodded Fitz Setori, only for his head to hang.

Unconscious. 

There was dried blood under his nose, a slimy ooze of black.

Prying open his mouth, I checked his teeth. 

Too many.

Just like Cassie, a whole new row of spiky incisors were pushing through.

Dad was hurting them. 

He was torturing them.

Turning them into *something*. 

My quivering hands found a needle sticking into the back of his head, colorful wires protruding into his skin. 

There was a clear fluid being pumped into the three of them. 

If Dad was experimenting on the Setori family, was it affecting *us* too? 

“Well?” Ruby demanded, her voice twisting, contorting into that of a monster. 

“What did you DO to my FAMILY?”

Instead of answering her, I forced my legs to move toward the movement on the other side of the room. There was something piled on the floor, jerking in sharp movements, a slimy mess of inside out flesh. It hit me when I was closer. 

The bodies entangled with each other, some of them headless, others missing arms and distinct facial features, were *me*. Dozens of Ruby Setori’s both made of buzzing static and terrestrial flesh, covered in a slimy, blood tinged substance, like these things were being *born*. Not made. 

I think I was sick. All over myself. 

Another blinding flash hit the corner of my eye, and in front of me, another *thing* was slowly forming, first static, growing into skin, a body moulded and sculpted into existence. 

This Ruby had no eyes, no arms, her limbs contorted like doll pieces. I was aware I was staggering back, slipping in what looked and felt like part of a placenta. 

The Setori siblings were making copies of me. 

My gaze found one singular version of me who was *almost* perfect. 

Except her enlarged brain expanding 
Through the skull. 

And these replicas were getting better by the minute. 

“Ruby!”

Mom shouted from upstairs. “Did you get my wine?” 

I left the basement, my heart in my throat. 

Upstairs, my brother and sister were giggling.

And downstairs in the basement, the Setori siblings were laughing *harder*. 

Three nights since I spoke to Ruby, and the copies of me are getting better. 

One of them managed to walk upstairs yesterday.

I think the siblings are slowly making another version of their sister. 

I want to talk to her. I want to know what she's doing to my family. 

But I *can't* talk to her.

If I do, I lose Ruby Setori. 

Mom and Dad play peek-a-boo with me every night. 

They're behind every door, their hands covering their faces. 

Cassie is eating meat raw from the refrigerator. 

Fitz is getting better at crawling under my door. 

And the laughter in the basement is getting louder. 

Please help me. I'm so scared of my own family. 

I don't think the Setori’s were my parent’s best choice after all.
