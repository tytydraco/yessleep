# Entry One

I usually woke up before her to start the coffee maker, moving quietly in the dark as if that would soften my presence. I knew she was waiting for me to wake her, and I loved being the first part of her day. It meant everything to me that she always wanted to begin her mornings in my arms.

We’d stand in the kitchen, the lights still off, watching the sun rise as we talked—sometimes softly, sometimes about nothing in particular—right up until the last seconds before I had to leave for work. The thought of continuing those conversations carried me through the monotony of my day, right until I pulled back into the driveway. I’d switch off my headlights, just in case she’d fallen asleep on the couch waiting for me to come home.

When I came through the door, she would greet me with a warm embrace and eventually offer dinner in a Tupperware container, making sure I ate. We would continue talking throughout the night, recapping our days, discussing friends, family, co-workers, and anything we had seen online recently. She always listened to me, and I did the same for her—at least, I hope I was as good a listener as she was.

I never felt fulfilled in my job, and I often found myself drifting into stressful topics that led to moments of silent dismay. I tried not to let it bother me too much. I always wanted children with her, but I felt we needed to build up our savings a bit more first. Although our new house was small, I dreamed of adding an extension to create more space for a family, especially since we had enough land to make it possible. At times, I felt responsible for our challenges, as if she deserved better than the difficulties we faced.

To counter these feelings, I would put on her favorite childhood show, *The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh*. She would light up whenever we watched it, and its wholesomeness always cheered me up too. Many nights, we would fall asleep with it playing in the background, only to wake up and repeat our routine the next day.

One day, when I came home from work and opened the door, she was standing there with a look I recognized immediately.

Looking down at the floor, as if afraid I might say no, she asked, “Can we get a dog?”

As much as I wanted to say, “Who’s going to walk it? And clean up after it?” I knew she had me, and I would do anything she wanted. She worked from home, and we didn’t have any pets. I had a feeling this was going to come up sooner or later.

The next couple of nights were spent researching breeds and local shelters, and it was so much fun. We reminisced about childhood pets, shared our fond memories with them, and discussed what we should be cautious of as we embarked on this venture. It felt like we were little kids who couldn’t sleep the night before Christmas.

We visited a few shelters, and it seemed like she was on the verge of tears because we couldn’t take home every animal we saw. Most of the dogs weren’t quite what we were looking for, but we kept searching. After visiting our third shelter, we found her. She was lying in her kennel with a polite, matter-of-fact demeanor, as if we were intruding on her tiny space—her home, however small it was. She had a blue merle coat, and according to the kennel employee, she was a rough collie and Labrador mix, about a year and a half old. She immediately stood up to greet my wife when she offered her scent, gently licking her hand. She was so sweet. The only problem was that we were short on time due to prior plans. We had only intended to visit, and if we found a dog, we planned to arrange the adoption for the weekend.

But this was different. Despite all our “research,” we decided to take a chance, canceled our plans, and brought her home. When we pulled into the driveway and parked, she was hesitant to leave her kennel. We had to carry it into our little living room, open the door, and eventually, she cautiously made her way out into the kitchen, where my wife had placed a small bowl of food for her. By the end of the night, she was lying on the floor of our bedroom upstairs. She felt safe with us, and we felt safe with her.

The next day was a Friday, and fortunately for both of us, we had the day off. The morning started out normally, except I had a little helper who made sure my once-silent routine was now loudly observed. I took her out into our large yard, and I had never seen anything happier. She had so much space to explore and looked so curious and free. Every plant and bug was a new discovery as we soaked in the cool late-summer morning. Once she had finished her business, the late riser was waiting for us in the kitchen with her coffee. Our new guest felt much more comfortable, and we were both excited to welcome her into our lives.

After a short game of fetch, my wife grabbed the car keys and excitedly said she wanted to run out to get some treats and a couple more toys. I laughed and took on the babysitter role as she waved to us while backing down the driveway.

An hour passed, and I began to feel a little concerned, but I figured she might have stopped to pick up breakfast. After two hours had gone by with no word from her, I had already called and texted. When three or four hours had passed, I was calling her every minute. The calls went straight to voicemail. As the sun began to set, I sat on the front porch, staring down the driveway, waiting for any sign of headlights. I called my sister, but she lived an hour away and had to work. She told me she would come by as soon as she got off. Our little guest was just happy to be able to run around and get some attention, which greatly helped in the midst of our growing concern.

When I first saw the headlights coming down our driveway, I shot up and jumped down the steps. I had never felt such a rush of relief. The weight of fear had been like a barbell strapped to my back, impossible to lift.

But as the car turned, I noticed the lights on top. It was black and white, and a surge of anger and embarrassment flooded me. The back of my neck burned white-hot. I couldn’t comprehend why this was happening. All she had done was go to the store.

Two state troopers pulled up next to me, their car coming to a quiet stop. They stepped out in unison, their movements precise and deliberate. The passenger-side trooper didn’t say a word as he approached. Gently, he placed an arm around my shoulders, steadying me as I knelt in the yard. His voice was soft, almost a whisper, as he asked, “Can we go inside?”

I still remember the faint glint of their name tags catching the light, momentarily piercing through my hollow stare. One read Murphy, the other Lancaster.

As she was merging onto a highway, a drunk driver, speeding and switching lanes recklessly, hit her. The impact knocked her off the shoulder of the road and into a tree. She died on impact.

My sister arrived at the house shortly after. One of the troopers gently took her outside to break the news, while the other stayed with me in the front room. They remained until she could compose herself, then left their contact information with her before returning to their duties.

Meanwhile, I hadn’t moved from the chair in the living room. I couldn’t move, and I didn’t want to. My sister draped a blanket around me and refused to leave my side. I wept and occasionally vomited into a bucket she had placed next to me. I neither ate nor slept that night. My sister lit candles in the living room, surrounding me in their glow, and tried to coax our little friend out from her hiding spot under our bed upstairs to feed her.

I still remember the darkness of that night. It should have poured rain, but instead, it was a warm, still evening. The silence was suffocating. The candles’ flames danced in my eyes whenever I chose to open them. The only sound came from my sister, who had fallen asleep on the couch next to me. Her somber snoring broke the stillness, a stark contrast to the silent despair that kept me wide awake.

As the sun began to rise, casting a gentle light through the windows like a tranquil alarm, fatigue finally began to overtake me. My heavy eyes started to close, pulling me into what felt like a new nightmare. But then, I felt a wet sensation on my hand, which hung limply over the arm of the chair.

I sat up slightly, rubbed the gunk from my eyes, and leaned over to see our little guest. And it all started over again—not the weeping of loss, but the ache of what could have been and what would always stay with me. She had her tennis ball with her, and it felt as though she was saying, “I’m still here.”

That’s when I chose her name. I wanted her to share in the love I had for the one person I had always wanted to spend every second with. That’s when I named her Bonnie.

# Entry Two

My mornings were no longer silent. Bonnie had grown accustomed to being fed at a specific time, and she made sure I knew it. It felt like she practically dragged me out of bed and into the kitchen. My once quiet, careful morning routine had turned into a laid-back shuffle to serve her beloved breakfast, always followed by a little conversation between us. Sometimes, it feels like she knows she's the reason I get up each morning, keeping me going when I otherwise wouldn't.

Our morning walks around the property have become the only reason I leave the house. After my workplace found out what happened, they put me on leave to sort things out. It was a kind gesture, but honestly, I don't have any desire to go back. Everything I did for that job was for a greater purpose, and now that purpose is gone. I'll find something different when the time comes.

My sister calls frequently and visits often, usually staying more than one night. Her presence has become familiar, and it shows with Bonnie. She joins us on our walks, which is refreshing, even if it doesn't fix everything. I know she cares, but I also know nothing can really make it better.

When she stays over, she usually gets up before me to give me a little more time to stay in bed. She tends to overfeed Bonnie and play with her in a patronizing way. I can tell Bonnie isn't a fan, but I suppose the company is appreciated. Still, every night I see ghosts, and I can't shake the feeling of hearing her voice calling for me down the hall. It taunts me, reminding me of a wound that will never heal.

One evening, after dinner, I took Bonnie for her usual walk. Normally, we stay within view of the house, but I decided to go a little farther into the woods. I figured it couldn’t hurt as long as I remembered the way back. Bonnie led the way, per usual, and we made our way through some tall grass onto a rough dirt path shaded by the tree line. We heard a rustling sound nearby, and I assumed it was a squirrel or a rabbit. The silence that followed was deafening, but when the crickets started chirping again, we continued onward. The shadows cast by the trees made me think about returning during the day to escape the heat and harsh sunlight.

As we moved deeper, the rustling returned, this time closer. Bonnie stopped, and so did I. She sensed something was nearby but didn’t bark. Instead, she backed up toward me, her tail brushing against my legs. The crickets resumed, but Bonnie stayed still.

A coyote burst out of the bushes, startling both of us. Bonnie barked but didn’t advance. The coyote stood its ground, glaring at us, even taking a few steps forward. Fear crept in. What if there were more? What if they went after Bonnie? I quickly leashed her and retreated back towards the house.

Once we got home, I felt a little embarrassed by the encounter, though I’m not sure why. Bonnie seemed fine, so to lift her spirits, I decided to play with her for a while. She always told me that fetch was her favorite game, though she’s shown me a few others. I knew we had to get some playtime in before my sister came and insisted we go to bed. I hate when she gets in between us.

# Entry Three

My sister has pretty much made herself at home, settling into our old living room. I guess it’s fine, but every time I get a moment alone with Bonnie, our time is interrupted by a phone call—from guess who. She usually comes over on Wednesdays and stays until Sunday morning. Having someone around can be nice, but I can tell Bonnie’s starting to get tired of her, and honestly, so am I. She’s just always there. And while I’m grateful for her help, I’m also looking forward to when she gives me some space.

I’ve connected with Bonnie in a way my sister wouldn’t understand. I don’t think she needs to be here all the time. I’m doing a little better, but my sister keeps insisting something’s still wrong. She always says, *"I just don’t want anything else to happen, as long as I can help it."* Everything is fine. The fact that she doesn’t believe me only makes me more upset. I’m tired of being treated like a child.

Our morning walks have become my only escape from her constant presence. I still think about returning to that shaded area in the woods where the trees block out the light, but I’m not sure I’m ready yet. My sister usually watches us from the kitchen window—I can always feel her there, like a shadow. Still, I’m glad I’m getting out of bed more often than before.

Recently, after one of our morning walks, my sister excitedly told me about a local dog park she wanted to take me to. I wasn’t thrilled about the idea. I don’t trust other people’s dogs around Bonnie, but she was insistent. She really wanted me to leave the house—it’s been a while since I have, and she’s been the one bringing in groceries while I spend most nights lost in thought.

Apparently, my reluctance was obvious, because she gave me an ultimatum: if I went to the dog park, she’d leave me alone for the rest of the week, at least until Sunday. If I didn’t, she’d come back on Thursday. I knew she was trying to be considerate, so I figured, why not?

It was a short drive across town. I sat next to Bonnie in the back seat, trying to keep her calm because of my sister’s erratic driving. I could tell she was stressed, but I knew this wouldn’t take long, and we could get back to our routine.

We pulled into a small parking lot next to the dog park. It wasn’t too bad—small, but luckily not crowded. I kept Bonnie leashed; I didn’t want her getting too close to anyone’s dog. Most people were leaning against the fence near the parking lot, barely paying attention to their dogs, while a few were playing in a small area. My sister rubbed my back, making me jump. She offered to walk Bonnie, but I refused to give up the leash.

A bright yellow tennis ball landed at my feet, and just as I reached down to pick it up, Bonnie grabbed it. I laughed and tried to take it from her mouth when I noticed a pretty Saluki dog standing in front of us, curiously sniffing Bonnie. They exchanged sniffs under my watchful eye, and I kept a firm grip on the leash, ready to pull Bonnie away if anything went wrong. Just then, someone called out,

*"Winnie!"*

When I looked up, I froze. A woman with shoulder-length strawberry-blonde hair was walking toward us. She wore round, wire-frame glasses, and her bright blue eyes met mine as she smiled. Her cheeks flushed slightly, and she brushed her hair back before pointing at the leash.

*"You don’t have to leash them inside the gates,"* she said. *"I understand though! You never know how these things will go. What’s her name?"*

I could hardly speak, but luckily, my sister chimed in. She told her Bonnie’s name and complimented her dog for being “cute and fluffy.” Then, doing me a favor, she said she had left something in the car, adding, *“Take care of my brother while I’m gone.”*

Her name was Amy, and she worked as a dental assistant in town. She had a special fondness for long walks with her dog, whose name was inspired by a favorite childhood character.

Before I knew it, I found out she was free this Saturday. I don’t know why, but I’m excited, even though I feel like I shouldn’t be. When I told my sister, she almost jumped out of the driver’s seat in excitement. She even promised to babysit Bonnie. I just hope she treats Bonnie well while I’m gone.

# Entry Four

When I finally had some time to myself, I started to think more about what I had gotten myself into. I’m not ready to go on a date with anyone right now. I just thought it would be nice to spend time with someone besides my sister for a change.

I haven’t been this nervous in a long time, and I wasn’t sure I was ready for something like this. It felt too soon. I figured I’d let a few days pass and maybe come up with an excuse to get out of it.

Even after some time, I couldn’t shake the feeling that what I was doing was wrong. I still felt like I was making a mistake. I didn’t know what to do until my sister called me on Wednesday. As much as she annoys me sometimes, she knows how to calm me down. She reminded me that this didn’t have to be anything serious if I didn’t want it to be, and I shouldn’t feel bad about being attracted to someone. She even extended the time before she’d check in on me again, which made me feel better. Honestly, I just wanted to get through it and return to spending time with Bonnie.

As the week went on, I just felt worse. I almost came up with an excuse—like pretending I was sick or saying something came up with my family—but I knew if I went through with it, it wouldn’t be so bad, and I’d finally get the space I needed. I checked in with Amy the day before, and she seemed excited. Up until then, our communication had been light—just a few funny exchanges about dog memes.

I barely slept the night before, but not for the usual reasons. My sister came over a couple of hours early, and I guess she helped lift my mood a little. It felt like I was gearing up for something big, like I was supposed to win some kind of race.

She helped with the dishes while I got dressed. Bonnie helped me pick out a nice shirt, which gave me a little confidence—I could feel her cheering me on. But the guilt hit me hard when I realized I was about to leave her behind. I couldn’t shake the feeling that my sister wouldn’t take good care of her. I should’ve just come up with an excuse.

When it was time to leave, it felt like I was saying goodbye for good. I backed out of the driveway, waving to my sister and Bonnie. I could see the sadness in Bonnie’s eyes—she didn’t even come to the car. I kept telling myself it would all be over soon.

Amy and I had agreed to meet at a coffee shop and then take a walk in a nearby park. Before I had decided to have a fit, it seemed like a good idea to get to know her better. Now, I regretted it. Still, I felt the need to show up early so I wouldn’t keep her waiting—it seemed like the right thing to do.

I found a table in the corner, feeling out of place as other people worked on their laptops or met with friends. It was the waiting that was the hardest part, like I was an outsider looking in. The quiet hum of conversations around me broke when she finally walked through the door.

She was dressed nicely, with her makeup done and her hair styled. Instinctively, I sat up straighter and checked my breath. I don’t know why I hadn’t eaten anything yet. She spotted me and came over for an awkward side-hug before sitting down. I offered to get her a drink while she got settled. She politely declined at first, but I insisted.

She asked for a cappuccino, and since I only drink coffee at home, I panicked and ordered the same thing. I admitted I didn’t know much about coffee, and she laughed. We talked about small things: where we went to school, childhood interests, favorite movies or shows.

It felt good to have a normal conversation, even though I hadn’t really watched much since everything happened with Bonnie. Amy told me she got Winnie during a tough time in her life too. I didn’t go into detail about what happened to me—I just called it a *"tough time."* But when I mentioned how important Bonnie was to me, I started choking up. I excused myself to the bathroom, but I’m pretty sure she noticed.

When I came back, she placed her hand on mine and said, *“Pets are family, but they always feel like good friends at first.”* It made me feel a little better, but she didn’t really understand how much Bonnie means to me. Honestly, her comment felt like a bit of a reach.

We kept talking about Bonnie and Winnie. She shared her favorite games to play with Winnie, and I mentioned a few of mine, but she didn’t seem that interested. I noticed her looking away and making odd expressions as I spoke. I wasn’t sure why. I hadn’t reacted that way when she was talking.

She quickly changed the subject to the weather, and we decided to head to the park for a walk. It was a beautiful fall afternoon—golden leaves, bright sunshine, and a gentle breeze. The summer humidity was gone, making the day feel perfect. I was even more excited because I knew I was closer to going home to Bonnie.

As we walked, Amy talked about how fascinating she found the connection between dogs and humans. She thought it was strange how dogs follow and rely on humans through a leader-follower relationship. In the wild, there isn’t an alpha dog—they hunt and live in packs as a family unit.

That idea stuck with me. I told her how I used to really want a family, how important it was to me at one point. It felt like something I had held close but then lost. I wasn’t sure anymore if it was something I still wanted.

We walked around the park a couple of times, sharing funny family stories and laughing together. Time slipped by, and before I knew it, the sun was setting. I felt like I was almost at the finish line. She mentioned needing to check on Winnie and said she’d text me later. We said our goodbyes, and I walked to my car, feeling lighter.

On the drive home, I could feel the pressure on the accelerator—I couldn’t wait to see Bonnie and tell my sister how it went. As soon as I pulled up, Bonnie ran out to greet me saying *“Please don’t leave again!”* I told my sister about the date, and she hugged me so tightly it felt like she was squeezing all the tension out of me. She said she was proud of me, but had to head home soon, though Bonnie still needed to go out. In that moment, I couldn’t have been happier.

I grabbed Bonnie’s leash, and we waved goodbye from the porch as we rounded the house, heading toward the field where the trees covered the sky. I felt unstoppable. It was a full moon that night, and I wanted to see the moonlight spill through the canopy as we listened to the crickets and watched the fireflies flicker in the dark.

But when we reached the tree-covered area, the crickets had fallen silent, and the fireflies seemed too shy to show themselves. It was a bit disappointing. I hadn’t expected much, but I had hoped for more. The night was still beautiful, though—clouds had rolled in, making it darker than I’d imagined.

As we stood there, I felt a strange silence settle over us. It felt familiar in a way I couldn’t quite place. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up, and a sense of discomfort filled the air. There was this unshakable feeling of danger, like something was watching us.

Bonnie’s fur bristled, and she positioned herself in front of me, feet wide apart, alert and protective. I sensed something too, and just like before, the bushes across from us rustled. This time, a coyote burst out—but not in the cautious way it had before. It leapt at us with aggression, baring its fangs. Bonnie, usually so brave, tucked her tail and retreated behind me.

Without thinking, I scooped her up, adrenaline fueling my strength, and ran back toward the house as fast as I could, fear propelling me forward.

When we got back to the house, Bonnie hid under the kitchen table for most of the night and when I went to sleep she slept underneath the bed. I was humiliated. I don’t know why I thought anything good could have come from going back there. I don’t know why I couldn’t have protected her when it counted. I know that I will never allow that to happen again. I know that I have learned what was needed to protect our family.

# Entry Five

Good morning, Dr. Meier,

It has been quite some time since we last spoke, and I wanted to reach out to express my concerns about my brother, Nick. I deeply respect the importance of client confidentiality in supporting his healing, but I am genuinely worried about his well-being.

After Nick lost Bonnie, I may have been too involved in trying to support him. It felt strange when he named their newly adopted dog "Bonnie" so soon after her passing. I understood his desire to preserve her memory, but it seemed like an unfair burden to place on another animal that couldn’t understand its significance.

I gently suggested other names, but Nick was adamant about naming her Bonnie. At first, it seemed to help him cope, especially during times when I couldn’t be there. Knowing that this new Bonnie gave him a reason to get outside offered some reassurance, as I feared he might otherwise retreat entirely.

I know I can be pushy, but I felt compelled to encourage him to leave the house and stay active. I worried about him isolating himself and feared the worst. I just wanted to help him in any way I could.

When Nick met Amy, I was thrilled. Seeing him connect with someone on a personal level gave me hope. It was a relief to know he had someone else besides me to lean on.

However, I’ve grown increasingly worried about his attachment to the new Bonnie. He seems overly protective of her and dislikes when I interact with her in ways he doesn’t approve of, which happens often. He claims to know her “favorite games” but never explains them. I’ve overheard him having long, detailed conversations with her, but he goes silent the moment he realizes I’m nearby. It often feels like he’s discussing something about me with her.

Recently, I witnessed something concerning. Through the kitchen window, I saw him walking Bonnie. He let her off the leash, then sat on the ground in a posture mimicking a dog. Suddenly, he sprinted across the yard on all fours, chasing her. As strange as it sounds, he was surprisingly fast, almost catching up to her.

When I visited him recently, something felt very off. Normally, he greets me at the front porch, but this time, he didn’t. I waited, then checked the front door, which was unlocked. Inside, the house was in disarray—uncleaned and foul-smelling, like urine. After calling for him multiple times, he entered through the front door with Bonnie following. Her fur was unkempt, and she desperately needed a bath. Nick looked similarly disheveled—his clothes were dirty, and he clearly hadn’t shaved in some time.

I tried to talk to him, but he ignored me, focusing on feeding Bonnie by pouring food directly on the floor. I attempted to clean up a bit, preparing to mop the floors at least, but he angrily dumped the bucket of water outside, saying Bonnie would get upset if I cleaned. He told me to leave it alone, so I played along, sensing he wasn’t in the right state of mind.

We sat in the living room—me on an unstained ottoman and him in a filthy chair. I tried making conversation, hoping he’d share something about what was going on, but he wouldn’t budge. He eventually told me he didn’t need me checking on him anymore. He said he was fine and didn’t need “babysitting.”

His dismissal upset me, and I admit I reacted emotionally. I demanded to know what was going on, saying I couldn’t bear to lose him after already losing a sister-in-law. This triggered an angry outburst. He began yelling, clenching his fists—behavior I’m familiar with as his sibling—but something about his cadence felt off.

When Nick stood up to leave the room, I hoped he might calm down. Instead, Bonnie began barking, mirroring his agitation. She bared her teeth and, without warning, lunged at me. Nick grabbed her just in time, making it clear that I needed to leave immediately.

I don’t want to get my brother or Bonnie into trouble, but I believe it’s time to reach out to him and encourage him to speak with you. Please let me know if you hear from him.

Thank you,  
Millie Robertson

# Entry Six

Good Morning,

As a precautionary measure before notifying local authorities for a welfare check on Mr. Nick Robertson, I am submitting the following entry from our journaling system, which is required for patients with post-traumatic stress disorder.

I have been working with Mr. Robertson to navigate the grieving process, but I am concerned that I have not been successful in helping him fully process his recent traumatic experiences or rebuild trust within his immediate family.

Please review the attached journal entry and ensure it is placed into records accessible to the police, should the need arise.

Thank you,  
Dr. Meier

I have found true happiness living with Bonnie and our family. Together, we have claimed this land, and with time, our numbers will grow. Bonnie has shown me my true purpose, and I will never allow anything—or anyone—to stand in the way of that. I’ve proven my loyalty to Bonnie time and time again as we’ve ventured to the farthest reaches of our home.

The forest, where the trees weave their shadows, belongs to us now. When the coyote appeared, I made my presence known. It challenged me, but I responded with a message that its kind will never forget. They now know their place, and some have even fallen in line, following me with a loyalty you could never understand. I lead them, and they obey—unlike you.

I am more complete than I’ve ever been. The past means nothing. The only thing that matters is what I have now, and I have everything I need. I don’t need you, and I never did. You were supposed to help me, but all I ever saw was your selfishness, your hollow attempts to justify your work. You don’t care about me. You only care about your job, about pretending to help people. But you don’t. You never did.

I know you’ll send others after us once you read this. We will endure no matter what. This land—our land—has outgrown its boundaries, and now our home stretches far beyond where you think it ends. We will thrive, and you will wither. Your weakness has always been your downfall.

# Entry Seven

**Martinsburgh Police Department Report**  
**Case Number:** 078221  
**Date:** 11/17/2026

On November 14th, 2025, at approximately 1530 hours, I was dispatched to (STREET ADDRESS REDACTED FOR PRIVACY) for a welfare check on the occupant, Nicholas ROBERTSON. Upon arrival, OFC LANCASTER and I met with Millie L. ROBERTSON, who was waiting for us outside the residence.

We spoke with Ms. ROBERTSON briefly to understand the situation involving Mr. ROBERTSON. After our conversation, we approached the front door of the residence. Attempting to look through the windows on the front porch proved ineffective due to heavy dirt and grime obscuring the glass.

We knocked on the door, announcing our presence, but received no response. Ms. ROBERTSON attempted to open the door, which was unlocked. As she did, we heard a disturbance around the side of the house. Moments later, approximately twenty dogs came running into view. The dogs were barking aggressively and behaving erratically. OFC LANCASTER and I retreated from the porch to call for backup and animal control. Although the dogs were difficult to manage, none of them bit anyone on the scene.

Once backup officers arrived, efforts were made to distract and corral the dogs, allowing us to safely re-approach the house. Upon opening the front door, we were met by an additional dozen dogs rushing out of the home. The scene inside was chaotic and unsanitary, with dried dirt and feces covering the walls and floors as well as unknown animal remains scattered throughout. The home appeared to be in complete disrepair.

Ms. ROBERTSON became visibly upset and began calling out for her brother while moving through the home. Despite our attempts to keep her outside to ensure her safety, she insisted on searching for him. She eventually ran upstairs, where we followed to remove her from the premises for further investigation.

The upstairs bedroom was in slightly better condition than the rest of the house. While securing the area and escorting Ms. ROBERTSON outside, OFC LANCASTER observed a large torn-apart box on the bedroom floor. Printed on the side of the box was the name “Novatek.”

OFC LANCASTER conducted a quick search on his phone to learn more about Novatek. The results revealed an article about a Japanese man who had gained widespread attention for commissioning an incredibly lifelike dog costume from the company. The photos accompanying the article showed a costume so detailed it was nearly impossible to distinguish it from a real animal, complete with synthetic fur, anatomically accurate features, and lifelike movements. OFC LANCASTER shared this information with me, and it was at this moment we realized that one of the dogs on the premises was likely Mr. ROBERTSON.

OFC LANCASTER and I quickly exited the home and returned to the front yard, where most of the dogs had already escaped containment. They were seen running across the open field behind the house and into a distant tree line. Among the fleeing dogs, one stopped momentarily, stood upright on its hind legs, and then disappeared into the forest.

# Epilogue

Hello Dr. Meier,

I’ve tried reaching out to you through calls and texts as much as I could after everything that happened. First, I want to sincerely apologize for the media fallout following the investigation into my brother’s home. We’re doing our best to restore the property and eventually put it on the market, though it seems like it will be a long time before anyone feels comfortable purchasing it.

That said, I would feel a lot better if I could hear from you. I understand if you’ve been avoiding my attempts to reach out—I wouldn’t blame you. I feel responsible for so much of this and just want to find a way to make things right.

There’s something I need to bring to your attention as well. When I searched my brother’s house the day he disappeared, I found an address written on a piece of paper taped to his old refrigerator. When I looked it up, I discovered it was tied to your name. I hope it’s an old or temporary residence because I don’t believe my brother has any reason to seek you out—or at least, I haven’t seen any signs of hostility toward you. If you’ve experienced anything unusual, please let me know as soon as you can.

I’ve also heard unsettling reports from friends about hunters being attacked by wild dogs in the woods. One story mentioned a creature moving so quickly and violently it didn’t seem like anything they’d ever seen. I’m hoping these are just exaggerated tales. Still, I hear howling in the woods around my home. Some nights it feels louder and closer, like it’s calling out to me—or maybe coming for me. Either way, I know there’s no place for me there anymore.

Please take care,
