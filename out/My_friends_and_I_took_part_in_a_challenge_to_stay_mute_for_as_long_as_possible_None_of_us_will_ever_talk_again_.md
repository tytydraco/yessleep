I wish I could forget how this all started, if only to rid myself of the regret I now carry with me. It was all so stupid, just a silly internet challenge my friend Callie found on this horror forum she used to be obsessed with. The idea was that we (including our other friend Anthony) would challenge each other to remain mute for as long as we could and that the winner would be treated to a pre-agreed prize from the other two whilst the losers would face some nebulous punishment. I don't know why I didn't question the fact that the prize was to be arranged before the challenge whilst the punishment wasn't.





If only I did.





Nothing in the rules Callie sent to us made any reference to online communication, but we decided to throw that in for good measure. No speaking in real life, no speaking online. The fact that we shared an apartment made that a little easier to tack on regardless. We were all excited and naturally very competitive people and so I was in for a good fight. We started at midnight that same day, and my first port of call was to head straight to bed in an effort to avoid any accidental early missteps. Morning rolled around and I woke up fresh-faced and ready to head to class to finally see how difficult this whole thing would be. It was more awkward than difficult, really, because we had only told our other friends and people who I interacted with infrequently or was just acquainted with had to have the game explained to them by another person whilst I sat there feeling like an immature child. Nevertheless, I got through the day without talking and to my surprise had somewhat enjoyed experiencing life purely through the perspective of a listener. 





Upon getting home I almost lost through pure instinct of shouting out to see if anybody else was there, but caught myself at the last moment. Callie and Anthony were on the nice couch we had delivered a few days before watching a TV show and knowing them trying to bait the other into talking through pure physical proximity. It would've worked on me, so I sauntered up to my room without much more than a wave before locking the door and promptly climbing into bed for a nap to avoid their shenanigans making their way up to me. It was three hours later when I was awoken from my unexpectedly deep slumber by a series of increasingly piercing screams. 





Those sounds were almost inhuman. Unnatural. Sounds my ears were *never* supposed to hear.





I still don't know what I could have done differently in the situation. My heart violently screams at me during every waking moment for leaving my room yet my head logically explains that I wouldn't have lasted very long in there with the supplies I had. Curiosity, concern or an amalgamated blob of both forced me to unlock the door. To practically fall down the stairs in a futile show of worry for my two friends. I turned the corner into the living room and my heart almost exploded out of my chest, I desperately tried to scream in the way they had and yet nothing came out. 





The back of the brand-new couch they had been sitting on was a horribly ruined mess of crimson-red blood and bone matter. In that instant, I wanted to run, to never be faced with what the front of that couch looked like. But I couldn't. Something forced me to stay. Beckoned me to put one foot in front of the other and look. So I did. There was barely anything left of them. As my initial view had suggested, their bodily matter was strewn across the couch and the pulps that remained of them resembled spoiled meat that had been run over by a semi-truck far more than human beings. Far more than my friends. 





I wish I never saw what had been left there. Perhaps that might have allowed me to imagine something other than the challenge was responsible. I was allowed no such comfort.





There was a small note between the ending of one of the pureed corpses and the beginning of the other. 





*"they both talked."* 





*"congratulations."*





Much of what happened in the days and weeks after my ordeal is buried in the depths of memories long lost, but I remember calling the police and going through the motions to clear my name as a suspect. Luckily, my DNA wasn't present on either the couch or their remains, but that of an unknown person was. They haven't found this person, even all these months later. I have strong enough reasons to doubt they ever will.





I spent a while in psychiatric care, remaining mute through that process, and was released a few weeks ago. I could finally do what I needed to pay my respects to my long-gone friends. I convinced myself that it was what they would have wanted from me.





It had to be done in our old apartment, despite the fact it remained a forgotten-about crime scene with police tape across the door. Sneaking in was simple, given I knew the layout very well, and I made my way to the kitchen. The sewing kit in the corner irresistibly called my name and I obliged. The first stitch was the worst and I wailed whilst blood gushed out of my lips before dripping onto the tiles below my feet. Each stitch reminded me of them, of their pain and of my regrets over what became of them. I told myself I deserved it. Part of me accepts that I didn't, that there was no way to know what our stupid game would turn into. That night, I ignored the pleas of that part of myself. Before long, my work was done. The white tiles were hidden below a pool of fresh blood and my lips curled into a sick smile as I walked to the bathroom to admire what I had done. 





I stared into the mirror with a blank expression and a growing smile between my now forever-wedded lips. 





As with my departed friends, I will never talk again.





My challenge will forever continue.
