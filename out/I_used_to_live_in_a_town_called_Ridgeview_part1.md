I used to live in a town called Ridgeview
I want to start by apologizing I’m not a writer and this is my first time ever writing a story. My names Mike Aarons, and I recently got into a car crash. I received some pretty terrible injuries, however none felt worse than my memories coming back. I could never really remember my childhood, no, more like I had a thin vail of what felt like a childhood. I think I remember going to school and having friends and parents but it’s a single amalgamation of blurry memories. 

After this accident about 2 hours from writing this my memories are slowly coming back. each on is painful, and vivid like I’m experiencing a movie in my head for the first time. Everything feels like a normal childhood however, there are stand out moments that are just…strange. I’d like to document it incase I lose it again. Seeing as this would be the only thing left to remember Ridgeview. It was lost to a sinkhole that swallowed the whole town. The government said it was an aqueduct that eventually caused the place to collapse after years constant pressure.

Ridgeview was like a desktop wallpaper. Pleasant trees and vibrant colors painted the perfect cover of it. Natures scent guided it’s lone walk throughout the town, granting a feeling of hopefulness. Depression rates were always drastically low and everyone felt motivated to go about their day with pure optimism. It was a blissful haze. Neighborhoods built in pleasing shapes and the cream of the crops, no pun intended, being the farms, and the church. 

The farms coated in Ridgeview’s finest red soil. I remember a girl bringing a tomato from outside of town and comparing it to ours. The size difference was ridiculous to say the least. We were told that the red soil is a mixture compound of fertilizer from India and the volcanic soil from Yellowstone. Thinking that the town I lived in was formed by a volcano was a childish thought but one that made the process of moving much easier. There was always one day out of the year, that would come synonymous with carnivals and fun but a lingering smell of something dangerous. That day was the only time that blissful haze of optimism and passion only slightly faltering into a pestilent sense of dread and paranoia. The harvest day.

The church also represented the soil. Being the embodiment of its bountiful harvests. A true work of art and monument to Ridgeview’s prosperity. The wealth accumulated from our crops netted us a tall red church. A bell hung in the center that would signal when the harvest day both started and ended. However it didn’t function like a normal church. There was no worship of Christianity, and extreme satanism. You could go inside and learn of the culture along with the rules but it was ultimately a club house mixed with a city hall. Honestly calling a city hall is a much better description but I remember the politicians being adamant that it was a church. They said it would be disrespectful to the harvest to call it anything else. So much so that priests from other religions were barred from entering. An old folktale spread that they’d make the soil ill. 

New comers found it almost heavenly and we had plenty. The former towns folk coming to visit the nest after spreading their wings always brought company. It’s apt to mention said new comers always left laughing like drunk buddies leaving a theme park. They spread word of mouth about Ridgeview, and reporters were always welcome. Good for business I think. Yet with such popularity the town only ever admitted a few each year. My mother got in because they said it was imperative, that her skills and knowledge were important to them. Though newcomers never last long and they only accept families. I’m surprised we didn’t leave like the rest of them. And just as they all left the first time, they always left with a smile on their faces. 

We didn’t have police either, or we did they were just different. They were called the authority, wore porcelain masks and tall cylindrical hats. Every single one of them were in peak physical condition. Other than that everything was practically the same as a regular officer. Blue shirt, black pants, black bullet proof vest, black shoes. The only thing missing was the hand cuffs and taser, though they never needed them. No one in the town dared try anything to upset them, so to the outside we had a crime rate of zero. They’ve always existed, back when the town was found by prospectors in the 50s. Or so that’s how the legends go. Most just assumed they were hired guards. The only people in Ridgeview who live here without families. 

It looked perfect but there’s always just something out of place. Like how there were no cars, everyone rode bikes, skateboards, or walked. If you had a car you had to keep it about a 2 miles walk from town where there was a designated parking lot. Yet no one seemed to question it. There were somethings that I just thought as a kid that were normal because I’d seen no different. When I got my first car, after leaving the town, it felt almost wrong. I pretty much almost crashed it as soon as I got it, sorry to that lady and her fence if you read this. When pumping gas I still have to cover my nose, the smell of it gives me a headache. 

We had moved to Ridgeview when I was 9 years old. I remember my mom vividly now and it brings me to tears, the sweetest lady on the outside. While she held my hand at the store she’d rub her thumb across my hand to make sure I was still there. She often got anxiety about me running off seeing as I was willing to explore whenever I could. I feel oddly hollow knowing that I was forced away from these warm memories of my mother when I left that town. Now conversely I’m glad to have forgotten my father. Well before he changed his life around. Sure call me a mamas boy but I never liked him. He got especially insufferable the first couple of months we moved. Spouting that he didn’t want to be there and that he should be working an important job. But after my parents first year of bickering, and me having to learn what divorce meant, he just learned to love this place. He always carried himself with a smile and put down drinking with a side of self pity for a love and care. And as a story begins things were at there peak, so it can really only go downhill from there. 

I remember it was April 4th 2009, I was picking up the local Ridgeview newspaper, written by Charles Leslee. It was Sunday, news was always delivered on Sundays, and the sun was breaming. ‘I’m gonna take my bike out and see Kev’ I thought to myself picking up the much anticipated pieces of bundled paper. I wasn’t one for the news just seemed like bumbling garble I was there for the real treasure. The cartoons. Specifically Garfield and his antics. It’s strange to realize now why I love Garfield, seeing as I couldn’t remember the contents of Ridgeview’s Garfield. It was actually how I confirmed my suspensions that this isn’t just a dream or something that could be caused by the accident. I’m familiar with the comics and they were just slightly off. Like Garfield telling Odie that he’s an idiot for wandering off on his own, whereas the original just called him stupid for being a dog. But this one, on the same day the newspaper dropped, the same day Charles Leslee died, was just different.

It was a fairly normal comic, however the bottom credit signatures were from Charles rather than Garfield’s creator. John, sick of Garfield always taking his lasagna, hides it somewhere in the house so he can go to work knowing that Garfield can’t get it. Chicanery  ensues with Garfield accidentally summoning lasagna aliens. I remember cackling at him being willing to trade Odie for a lifetime supply, but they didn’t take dogs. John comes back with his Lasagna gone but laughs saying “I guess I can’t hide anything from you, that’s why I have a spare!”. The comic ends on a panel of all of the characters laughing having a good time, however, Johns face is replaced with a hyper realistic face. I bursted into laughter because it kept the cartoony outline of John it was just a real dudes face in the middle. Then I realized it was our towns mayor, Cecil Gardener. 

I put the paper down, cleaning the joy and slight confusion off my face and looked towards adventure. “MOM, DAD! I’m going to see Kev!” I yelled already in opening the garage for my sick ride. “WAIT!” I heard footsteps barreling towards me as a warmth folded over me. It was mom. “Don’t get yourself hurt” with the authority around kids could run around freely and we never really had to worry about getting kidnapped or harmed. Though I tried to do a stoppie on my bike and She never forgets that I broke my arm. “Mom let go Im too old for this I’ll be fine.” I said annoyed. “Humph fine mister tough guy, go on your adventures.” I laugh and reopen the door, clasping my hands together I saw the finest red and silver bike I’ve ever seen. “Helloooo Ellie” I said ready to rip off. 

Kevs (short for Kenneth, he hated being called Ken) was a couple houses down from mine. We bonded over Garfield and talked about starting our own cartoons all the time. We would draw for hours and come up with all kinds of ideas. 

Knock knock, the sound of unlocking greeted by a smiling woman. 

“Hi Mike! How’re you today!” She said still smiling.

 “Good, is Kev here?” I asked. 

“He’s getting ready as we speak!” Still smiling. 

“Cool thanks!” I said trying to collect my racing thoughts of all the things we could make. 

Kev came outside with the grace of broken glass, tripping on his door frame, trying not loose balance with his backpack filled with art supplies. “DUDE! MY MOM GOT PAID AND SHE GOT ME MORE COLORED PENCILS! Like the expensive ones!” He said not even trying to contain his excitement. We cheered, to the both of us it felt like Christmas. 

We mounted our vehicles and set sail for creativity, the library. Riding through the town was always a joy, the smell of fresh pastries and nature always felt so warm. We saw more people riding their bikes going on their adventures. 

“Hey what’d you think of the new Garfield strip?” I said over the wind. 

“I dunno I haven’t read it yet” Ellie screeched with as much disbelief as mine. 

“WHAT!? Dude what’re we doing” I said shocked that he wasn’t more upset. 

He shrugged, “my dad got the newspaper, then locked himself away for a bit. When I asked him about it he said there wasn’t a strip on there”. 

“Well he’s a liar, we’ll check it out when we get to the library” I said scornfully. 

‘How could his dad keep Garfield from him?’ The thought making me more angry every time I pondered it. We start riding again and turn onto the shopping district. The library is about couple blocks down from the boutique shop. Ran by miss Anne, she was a sweet old lady but she kept trying to fit me in all these girl clothes. My mom said she had dementia and to go easy on her but I steer clear of that place after I tried on my first dress. “Hi boys!” Miss Anne said. “Hello miss Anne” I said content on only looking forward. 

We round the corner and shock with the smell of stopped tires. The air felt different here as we witnessed a truly grizzly sight “Who is that?” Kev said, words hung on by dread and confusion. Before us stood a sickly man, wailing and whining. His cries like a wounded animal, incoherent. It looked like his clothes were torn and I couldn’t only imagine their smell by their looks. He slurred, slobbered and spat through gaps of missing teeth. One detail in particular bugs me, and that’s that even from there, you could see his teeth were white. His eyes stained glass red, frantically rolled inside of bowled eye sockets. “Is that…” I squinted seeing a syringe ticking out from the connection between his forearm and bicep. But the syringe was massive compared to others. The middle of his bicep tightened by a belt. His ghastly features all the more apparent with closing distance. He had a long burly bread, maintained like a forest overrun with weeds. Accompanied by shiny, locked together hair, caked in enough oil to fill a fryer. 

“You live a lie!” He screamed and moaned “ *slurp* nO tRuSt FOr No oNE”. I watched back in shock. My mind was racing with thoughts ‘who is this guy?’ ‘What’s that needle for?’ ‘Is this a seizure?’ A shadow looms. I looked up and saw the authority already coming to intervene. 
 

I couldn’t even comprehend what I was looking at before they hoisted the man by his armpits. Two standing on either side the one of left echoed “we apologize for the inconvenience” As they full 180d and started walking down the street. Towards the red tower with a golden bell on top. None of them budged as the man kicked and wailed. The two gentlemen causally, methodically, open up of the two doors leading into the church. He turned saying only one thing in perfect English “leave”. The doors shut so loudly that disturbed birds rose to the top. I looked around and after 15 minutes of light whisper it was decided he wasn’t coming back out. Everyone begrudgingly returned about their day. Some praised the authority while others were a little taken aback by their actions. It felt comforting to know I wasn’t alone but at the end of the day it was over. I had heard stories of the authority, Kev and I almost thought of them as mystical beings. It was the first time we ever saw them in action, but not the last. I looked at Kev, pale and Solemn, he said what were both were thinking. “I think I wanna go home.” 

Later that day the mayor summoned everyone to a rally in the park to discuss that days blight. My mother death gripped my hand as we walked. Dad didn’t join us he had chores to do. I saw Kev walking with his dad and I waved but he just looked up, then away. ‘Bad time’ I thought to myself. We walked to the rally and began listen to our mayor. 

“HaHaHa quite the crowd!” The audience murmured. 

“Alright *clears throat*, we all know what happened but not the full story.” The suited man bellowed on the microphone, his grey hair the only indication of age. 

“The truth is one that’s personal to me and I’d like to share it with you all. that poor disheveled man you saw today, as much as it pains me to say so, was our news reporter Charles Leslee.” The crowd gasped, questions sprouted from every wrinkle in my brain. The mayor cleared his throat again “Now we knew of his drug abuse yes, and I personally offered to help aid him on his path to retribution” he said outstretching his hands and looking around, followed by his grasping the podium. “He was broken man who had a lot of things wrong, and I don’t think we deserve to let that define his character. He was a real kind friend, and I’d like to see him that way again,” he sniffled, “And to find him in this state, publishing lies about my reputation in the position I gave him.” He wiped his face, “breaks me as a man”. ‘This doesn’t make sense’ I whispered, ‘why not force him into rehab sooner?’ “And now you maybe wondering why we didn’t force him into rehab sooner,” he said I looked up in surprise to meet his eyes matching with my own. 

I felt a chill down my spine. “As a childhood friend I couldn’t bring myself to force that decision on him. I see now I should’ve, and for that apologize to all of you”. The air felt heavy, and Kev darted concern at me through the crowd. He could feel it too.

The mayor clears his throat again. “I think that’s enough emotion I can handle for one day. Food is free and paid for by me please come up and take a gift card and feel free to ask any questions to my email.” He stepped off the podium and everyone clapped. However, my mom never took her eyes off him. We collected our gift cards ate at Doug’s diner with Kevs family and returned home. I was beat. I had, and have so many questions. 

I thought that maybe that would be the last of any crazy experiences. But as my headache comes back, I vomit on the hospital floor, because I couldn’t have been more wrong.
