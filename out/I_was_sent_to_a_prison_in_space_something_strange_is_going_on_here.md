Prisoner 2633, please step forward” " is all I heard as I was marched through a door frame that scanned my person for “hidden weapons” unless there was some laser stored between the hairs of my left asscheeck, I was clean, I looked around to see all the guards had black suits with white wings on the neck collars, mean looking ex-military type dudes, just looking for a reason to shoot you “nothing I hadn’t seen before” I murmured to myself, I move forward towards a metal door, the guard to my left instructs me to walk through the door and remove my clothes and place them on the panel near the left wall, I walk in and did as I was instructed, I usually prefer to be naked in front of a dark-skinned curly haired women but, a cold sterilized room will do for now.

I stand there waiting for some rough voice to come over the intercom to tell me what happens next but, there's only silence, I then hear a mechanical clicking noise and look around the room, from the ceiling a robotic hand shoots out and grabs me by the neck, I then feel a burning sensation as I grapple with the hand to release me, it finally stops and I fall to the ground with a red hot pain stinging the side of my neck, I rub my neck and feel around the skin” Fucking Barcode” I said out loud in an annoyed grumble.

Two men walked in from the opposite side of the room and instructed me to put my clothes back on and follow them, we walked down a long hallway with doors on each side of the corridor, some looked like lounge areas, others looked like medical rooms and labs, we reached the end of the hallway as the security swiped his keycard and opened his visor to do a retina scan, the door slide open and I was introduced to my new home.

"Now Entering Cell Lock Up C” I look around the place and see stairwells and elevators lining the walls, on every floor is a set of cells containing those who were too messed up in the head to be held on any Earth prison and now, I shared my space with them, the guards led me down a couple flights of stairs and walked me too one of the cells at the end of the hallway, the guard swiped his key card and the door opened, I felt a rush of cold air as I was pushed onto the ground,” Food will be served exactly two hours from now, report to the lunch hall three floors down from here, all prisoners must be accounted for during lunch, after you have been accounted for, you may have leisure time or return to your cell, enjoy your extended stay Scum

I stand up and dust my clothes off,” Howdy” A rough voice meets my ears with a lukewarm welcome, I shift my gaze to see a bald black man with a grey half-black beard staring at me with a Playboy magazine on his chest. My god, I didn't even know they still made those things,” You can get your hands on a lot of things if you know the right people” he responded to me,” you don't look like the usual bastards that come in here, where you from, Columbus, Ohio, what about you,” Good ole Austin Texas, born and raised until I ended up in here of course” So I guess this is the part where we ask each other how we got here right? “You can, I could care less, as long as you don’t make too much noise at night and turn the other way while I get some reading in, I could give a rats azz why you in here, I love a good story but, if your gonna yap on for no reason, it'd be better if you just shut the fuck up, Respectfully of course”.

 I eyed the man for a minute, but he just smiled at me and went back to reading his “Novel”, I gathered myself and sat on the bunk opposite the man, I sat there for a while thinking to myself what I was going to do moving forward, Millions of miles away from home, no team, no backup, just stuck, in a massive prison complex sitting in the Middle of space, caged with the worst of society.

I think back on the night when everything changed, the gun still smoking from being fired, Tez walking in and seeing our squad Leader dead on the floor, the face he made, the feeling I had, I knew I messed up badly, I sat thinking for so long that I had drifted to sleep since I hadn't any since I was scooped up by the escort ship and taken off into the stars, I awoke to loud buzz noise and the cell door opening” Lunchtime kid, haul azz before they come looking for you and trust me, you don’t want them to do that” I sit up with a stretch, yawn and make my way out the door, there are guards on each floor, each armed with a charged laser rifle.

I would like to imagine they are set to stun, as I was nearing the stairwell to descend, there was a loud thud and then yelling, I heard heavy footsteps from guards moving above and then I saw a man fall from overhead, screaming as he fell to the ground with a heavy splat, followed by the metallic whirring of a laser rifle and then another thud hitting the floor” I guess they are set to stun” I thought to myself, the guards then took over and moved the rest of us to the bottom floor and lined us up, over in the corner was the guy from earlier, his body popped open like a rotted potato, entrails spread across the floor, with splatters of blood lining the walls in the area.

It was a mess, a showing of just how crazy things can get here I suppose” Poor Bastard” my cellmate said standing next to me” They were after him for weeks, that's just how it goes around here” What do you mean I asked him” Gangs, some of the prisoners' formed groups to band together up here, on this ship, we aint governed like it is on Earth, they got their own rules, their way of handling things, so the people take it in their own hands to protect themselves, if your a snitch, too close to the guards or cause too much commotion, they find creative ways to make you disappear” Gangs, all the way up here? doesn't seem too different from Earth "Yeah you say that now, they all say that, before they end up a pile of meat like him” he was about to say something else when the guards instructed us to move about as they covered the man's body, I looked up and saw another guy being restrained on the second floor as they picked him up and escorted him through one of the side doors.

The weirdo had some kind of Neon moon tattooed on his forehead, we were then sent through the lunch line, the food itself wasn’t half bad, dry but not bad, I found my cellmate sitting at a table by himself, I sat down in front of him and ask about what happened from earlier” You mean the gangs, well they're not that hard to explain, if you care to listen I nod at him "Alright, once the prison started to fill up more and more, we got an influx of former gang members, religious fanatics and just all around strange people, those people got together and started to talk, those talks turned into meetings and those meetings turned into groups, they all were under the same umbrella at one point but, things changed, they split up into factions, the big three being

The Lunar Lookers- They believe the stars and celestial bodies are alive and that they were sent up here to gather a greater understanding of space and shii like that, you can spot one of those by the moon markings all of em have on their foreheads.

Next is the MEtal Reds, a group that worships the very ship we reside on, they believe it to be some kind of metallic deity, and those guys usually work maintenance for the place since they tend to be handy with tools, they usually have a piece of metal engraved in their skin with a red cross on it

Last but least, The Spirit Hands, take the craziness and resourcefulness of the other two factions and up the fanatism by 100 and you have those psycho bastards, they believe that this prison isn't a prison at all and that it's some kind of test from A Greater Being they call the Galaxy Spririt, they think that once they complete their trial here on the ship, they  transcend time and space itself to be one with their Almighty, you can tell them boyz by a purple hand tattoo on various parts of their body, be careful who you talking to, you never know when one of them could be sitting right in front of you”

I raised my eyebrow at this revelation and moved to get up from my seat” Im fuckin witcha kid, I don’t belong to nobody, I just know about the crazy bastards that's all” I stare at the man with seething skepticism in my gaze, he does exactly what he did earlier, he smiles and goes back to eating, Alright then, how do you know so much about this place, you’ve been here for awhile huh” You sure do ask a lot of questions don’t you” Not I just like to know who I’m dealing with, that's all” Well since you asked so kindly, I’ve been here about 20 years, got here when I was 30, been here ever since, seen a lot, plenty have come and gone, never liked anyone, hell don’t even like myself half the time” he let out a small chuckle.

Now I wanna know, why are you here, your mind seems good from the way you talk, you sound just a bit too (Normal) to be up this way” I drop my head at the thought, I know why I’m here, I know what I did but, the thought of it still makes me a little sick to my stomach, I shot my squad leader on a mission, we got into an argument, things went left and bodies dropped” Ohhhhhh I see, let me guess the guy had some friends in high places, they pulled a couple of strings and got you sent up here” I look up in surprise at the man, How did you know all of that.

"Because the same thing happened to me,20 years ago, my life was in shambles, the wife had left me for some big-shot CEO, so I ended up downing an entire bottle of the strongest liquor I had and sat out on a mission, a mission for revenge but, things didn’t go as planned, I hit the wrong person and that cost me everything, he had some friends in the court system, got me to put away for 25 to life, then they shipped me up here and the rest is history.

He dropped his food on the plate, I can tell by the look in his eyes it hurt him to tell this story,” I ain't got too much of an appetite no more, if you need me I’ll be in the cell, and word of advice, don’t piss off anybody while you're in here, a grudge can make you disappear or, end up a human pill of spaghetti” with that, he threw his tray away and walked off, I sat there for awhile stewing in my thoughts, I knew this place was bad but, this is like a whole different reality in here, I finish my food and just sit there for a while, I look around at some of the other prisoners and spot a guy, shaved head, with a scar over his left eye, starring daggers into my soul.

I look away for a little while and then look back at him, he's still starring at me, he looks kind of familiar but, I can’t put my finger on it, not trying to make enemies on my first day, I simply get up and walk away, intending on heading back up to my cell until I’m stopped by a security guard, He had a rugged face with a smirk that made you wanna punch him,” You're the new guy right, I heard about you, I was told to make your stay here, um especially unpleasant, I stared coldly at the man with my fist balled” Ou you got a lot of fight left in those eyes, Ill, make sure to break that, he snaps his fingers and two guards surround me” Let's take a walk shall we, he swiped a door open and we started walking.

”That was a good man you put down, a real shame, I was part of that unit back in the day before I got promoted here, That man helped raise me, brought me up, but now he’s gone” We entered an empty storage room, one way in one way out, no camera and blinking lightbulb, I knew what was coming next and I prepared myself, the men surrounded me and the beating began, Batons, fist, and kicks flew in a frenzy, I blocked as much as I could, even got a few hits in myself managing to break the nose of one of the guards and hit the other one in the knee but, I was overwhelmed and taken to the floor.

For the next few minutes, my pain threshold was put to the test, I just remember looking up at the light and seeing them helping the other two guards to their feet, the head guard, I saw on his name badge,” Reese” I remembered that last name, my old squad leader informed me of an incident that happened,” Eric Reese” was demoted after his team's armored vehicle was ambushed by enemy soldiers, apparently he had gotten drunk the night before and had failed to send a search team further up the road to secure their next location, they were stuck out there for an hour until help arrived, he was the only of his squad that survived that night with the entire platoon being lost, all but him, he was stripped of his rank and almost kicked out until.

My old squad leader was the only one to take him in, mold him, shape him, then he ended up here, I remember the guys in my unit saying that one of them had moved up and that I was their spot filler, I guess that's who this guy is, it makes sense now, I felt warm fluids leak from my face, head, and nose as, my vision began to fade in and out, the next thing I knew, I was being dragged through a hallway and thrown into a large room, they sat me up and put me in a cold metal chair, the chair gave some relief for the hot stings of pain cursing through my body.

In front of me was a large square-shaped double-sided glass, on the other side was a slightly smaller room, with an oval-shaped door, that looked like it led directly to the vacuum outside, my eyes widened, as I thought this was it, their gonna toss me out the hatch and into the void but, I was wrong, a few moments later a door inside the other room opened and three guards stepped in, two restraining the man from earlier with the moon tattoo on his head and one behind him with a raised plasma rifle, the man seemed tense, his veins were bulging and his face was riddled with fear and confusion, his skin was peeling and it looked like a mixture of green and black splotches covered his body, either he had been beaten as well or the fucker was sick with something nasty. 

I see Reese walk up to me from the corner of my eye” This is what happens to those who give us problems” He made a motion with his hand and the third guard behind the man input a code and moved a lever” Hatch Sequence engaged, with that a timer of exactly one minute pooped up overhead, the men then punched the guy in the face, causing him to bleed a black and green slime, it oozed from his mouth as his bottom jaw fell from his face, the guards backed up in shock with Reese saying” Damn, I know we don’t like the guy but shit, at least let him go in one piece".

The man then started shaking violently as more black and green slime fell from his now gaping maw, the three guards now moved quickly to get out of the area until one of them was grabbed by the man, he held a strong grip on the guard's ankle, the other two moved to free the man before the timer was up but, the guy wouldn't budge, my eyes widened as I saw the man’s arm bulge and then explode into meaty tendrils of slime and tumorous growths, the guard shrieked as, he was then picked up and flung into the wall, hitting it with a sharp snap, he crumpled to the floor while the other two guards pulled out their laser-Rifles and fire round after round into the man before they had to cool them down for a second barrage.

The rounds hit the thing and it seemed like it hurt, with the creature of a man screaming and covering himself after every hit but, once they stopped, he growled and launched himself at the other guard that was holding him earlier, he grappled the man and bit down on his neck, blood splattered the wall and portions of the window, he then took an exposed bone from his fleshy arm and stabbed it straight through the man, blowing his spine out through his back so hard that it hit the last guard and knocked him back.

One of Reese's men rushed to open an emergency hatch to the room, but he was stopped, Reese ordered the man to stay in place as the guard that was stabbed through took his last breathe, the maniac of a man then spewed the black and green substance into the mouth of the man, his body fell to the floor and began to shake as well, bile rose from his mouth and began to spread across his body, the man's body shook even more as blood vessels and bone started to jet from all over.

The last guard had made it to his feet and was pounding against the emergency door since the main door was now sealed off waiting for the hatch to open, Reese's man looked back at him to silently ask for his permission, but Reese simply shook his head, the man kept begging and pleading but, he would be getting no help here, the fallen guard's body stopped shaking and then stood once again, now a monstrous amalgamation of bulbous tissue and thickened bone marrow.

The last thing we saw was the two creatures pounce on the man, savagely ripping him apart, limb for limb as he screamed the whole time, even begging for his mother at one point.

As some kind of relief from the show of carnage in front of us, the hatch finally opened, sucking everything in that forsaken room into the darkness of space, with my adrenaline now wearing off, my vision started to fade once more, I heard Reese yelling something at his men, I felt a hand grab me to pull me away, with Reese himself saying directly to my face,” You didn't see anything if I even hear that a peep of this got out, you'll be the next son of a bitch out that airlock, DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME”.

I used the last bit of my strength and nodded, I was then dragged away by his men but, I swear, before that hatch Opened, I saw something, leave the man’s open mouth and squeeze through one of the air vents, I woke up in my cell a few hours later, my cellmate was still asleep it seemed, apart of me wondered if everything that happened was some kind of hallucination, so that I could keep myself grounded in reality but, the bandages and bruise marks on my skin proved otherwise, with that thought in mind, something tells me that my stay here, is about to get a lot more "Unpleasant”.
