Apologies to post this here. I know it doesn't really fit the standard content, but I wanted to get some thoughts down about Crowbar, and this is such a supportive group. Someone else must have owned this late era PS1 game. And I am having some trouble getting my thoughts in order. 

'I will protect them. I will protect my family.'

That was always my favorite part of Crowbar. Those two lines of dialogue from the main character as he stepped out of his house in the opening cutscene. They still rattle around my head. 

I think the game got overshadowed by similar survival horror titles. The concept is a little basic too, with a Hagrid like figure running around suburbia, thwacking winged demons with a crowbar. But the graphics were decent enough for the early noughties, and the rain effects were great. They also used the sole titular weapon well, and once you gained the lightning and fire spells there was variation enough within the combat mechanism. 

The feature you probably know about even if you have not played Crowbar is the voice track. How the character’s family speak over the demonic howls and the sound of metal on meat. I love how the designers kept their narrative abstract. You never quite found out what happened to his wife and children, even though you can assume the worst. 

What is most remarkable are the reports on forums from players saying they heard their own family’s voices during the gam. Talking about how lucky they were to have a hero fighting for them. To keep away the monsters. A few police cases referenced this phenomena at the time, but nothing substantial enough to warrant panic. 

These resonate with me, because I fell into this category too. I was still living in my childhood home when I owned Crowbar, and if I played for more than three hours, the sound of my parents crept into the effects. I remember cracking the skull of an undead dog, and my mum telling me how proud she was, even though I knew she was downstairs making dinner. 

Her words of reassurance always calmed me down. I miss that feeling. 

Who knows when my copy disappeared. Probably around the time I had to move out, and half my collection went to charity, or the dump. I have tried to track down the game since, but you can rule out the second hand shops. They pop up about every six months online, but the price always starts at the top end of three figures, and the auction often gets taken down early.

This lack of availability boils my brain. I own a crowbar now, and have to trash things around the house when the rage gets bad enough. I sweep up a lot of broken glass. Sometimes when it rains, and I still cannot find Crowbar, I think about heading into the night. Because it would be nice to hear Mum’s voice again. To protect my family once more. 

What a game. What memories. Has anyone got a copy for sale? I have to play again soon.
