This company can bury me. They can get a lot from very little.

I don't want to incriminate myself, so I won't be saying my name, sex, or age. I also won't be saying the company's name at all. They have a lot of resources and seem to have a hand in everything these days, even though they are primarily in the medical industry. I'll leave the company's name up to your imagination, but if you know, you know.

I'm an archivist. I preserve, organize, and manage ALL information to make sure upon request that a company official or authorized employee can recall anything digitally from the creation of the company till now, Which at this point is more than 100 years of information. Documents, images, videos, databases, news articles, ANYTHING that includes the company's name or that is associated with the company no matter how small. If they think you're talking about them, they want it recorded and archived. I wouldn't be surprised if this post is sent across my desk for me to record and categorize.

We have your medical files. If you have or integrated one of our many products no matter how small I can safely say we have your thoughts and memories too. We have been watching over you so closely that we know you better than you know yourself. You all should start to read your user agreements. Most of you signed away your bodily anonymity to the company years ago. We use your information to target you with ads created PERFECTLY to entice you on an individual level to buy more from us.

I say all of this not so you know this company is off but so you know I'M off. I've lost something that I can't put my finger on working here. It's like the equivalent of what doctors lose from seeing so many dead people all the time but more extreme. I feel like I lost who I am… It's hard to explain. I feel like I'm entirely someone else. I only realized it because my boss let's call him N has been replaced. Not fired but replaced.

We have always been close. We started around the same time and started to find out about the company at the same time we used each other to vent and kind of cope with the things we were seeing. We crossed employee-manager boundaries and became almost brothers in arms. Taking in the weird world of \_ company. We would spend time hanging out at bars after work and shooting the shit. It was definitely weird at first but once I kinda got over the “This is my boss” thing I realized we were about the same age and we were very similar. We got so close that he even started to come to my family's Christmas parties. I found out he was kinda estranged from his family I never dug too deep but he told me there was an accident and his parents passed away suddenly a couple of years ago so he was alone the last few Christmas eves. Since then I started to invite him to my family's Christmas parties out of town. He became part of the family.

A couple of months ago something strange came across my desk to archive. I don't get a lot of physical media so when something like this does happen I tell N and we tend to go through it more thoroughly together before converting it to digital. It came in a brown box and when he opened it I saw what looked like a game cartridge. Like a Gameboy color game labeled \_Mortal\_Eyes\_ TC. That's all I was able to see before N Slammed the folds of the box closed and looked at me with a deadpan expression. His face was colorless and his eyes void-like. Our conversion went like this.

N - “What did you see”

Me - “Umm a Gamebo-”

N - ”-What did you see”

He took up a kinda scowl. It made me nervous.

Me - “What is wrong wit-

N - “WHAT DID YOU SEE”

Me -  “Nothing! I didn't see anything”

He then closed up the box and beamed straight to his office. Now I would normally think it was just a strange one-off thing but from that point on he doesn't talk to me anymore. He hasn't talked to anyone. He kinda ignores me. When I talk to him he doesn't reply and when I make myself physically impossible to ignore he kinda looks right through me. When he did that for the first time I felt a chill in my body. It would bother me. He just dropped our friendship just like that. Eventually, I started to realize that I was changing as well. I don't talk to or go to family gatherings anymore. I don't talk to anyone at all anymore. Eat, sleep, and work, and tbh it doesn't bother me at all. I feel nothing. I thought I had grown depressed maybe but this feels like something else it feels like something I don't feel empty. I just feel unbothered and uninterested in anything that's not a basic need or working. I've been fighting with myself to care enough to post this and I'm fighting with myself to care to investigate. I think the company has done something to us somehow and I need answers.

This week, I'm going to try to find the game I saw, or maybe i should try something more drastic to break through to my friend? In the meantime, if you all have any answers or advice, please send it my way. I think I'm about to go up against something bigger than myself. 

What should I do?

A - Try to find the game.

B - Try to really get Ns attention.

Or

C - Quit and try to find another job.
