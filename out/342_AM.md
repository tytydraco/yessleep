Every night for the past week, I've woken up at exactly 3:42 AM.

Not approximately. Not "around" that time. Precisely 3:42, according to my phone, my digital alarm clock, and the watch I've started keeping beside my bed to confirm I'm not imagining things.

It started last Tuesday. I'd gone to bed at my usual time, around 11:30, after scrolling through social media for too long as usual. Nothing unusual about the dayâ€”work had been busy but manageable, dinner was leftover pasta, and I'd called my mom like I do every week. Normal life stuff.

I jolted awake with that unmistakable feeling of something being wrong. You know that sensationâ€”when your body recognizes danger before your conscious mind catches up. My heart was already racing when I opened my eyes to my pitch-dark bedroom.

3:42 AM.

I lay perfectly still, listening. My one-bedroom apartment was silent except for the hum of the refrigerator and the occasional car passing on the street below. After a few minutes of nothing, I convinced myself it was just one of those random wake-ups everyone experiences. Probably stress from the project deadline coming up. I rolled over and eventually fell back asleep.

The next night, I made sure to avoid caffeine after 4 PM. I even skipped my usual evening scroll session, opting to read a book insteadâ€”supposedly better for sleep. I drifted off easily around 11.

And woke up at 3:42 AM.

This time, the feeling was stronger. Not just wrongness, but a distinct sensation of not being alone. I could feel my heartbeat in my throat as I stared into the darkness, eyes straining to make out shapes beyond my bedroom door, which I always leave slightly ajar because fully closing it makes the room too stuffy.

Nothing moved in the darkness. No sound besides my own breathing, which I was trying desperately to keep steady and quiet. After what felt like hours but was probably only minutes, I reached for my phone and turned on the flashlight, sweeping it around the room and then through the doorway into my small living room.

Empty. Of course it was empty.

The third night was when I started to get genuinely scared. Despite taking a melatonin and falling into a deep sleep, my eyes snapped open atâ€”you guessed itâ€”3:42 AM. This time, I was drenched in sweat, my t-shirt sticking to my chest. More disturbing was the fact that I was sitting upright in bed with no memory of having done so.

I knew I hadn't been dreaming. The transition from sleep to complete alertness had been instant, like a switch had been flipped. And now I was fully awake, my skin prickling with goosebumps despite the sweat.

That's when I noticed the smell. Just the faintest trace of something burningâ€”not like food or an electrical fire, but like hair or fingernails. It was subtle enough that I questioned whether I was imagining it.

I got out of bed that night and checked every outlet, unplugged non-essential electronics, even felt the walls for unusual warmth. Nothing. The smell had already dissipated, if it had ever been there at all.

I messaged my friend Mia the next day, trying to sound casual: "Hey, random questionâ€”have you ever had a period where you wake up at exactly the same time every night?"

She replied quickly: "Like when my son was a newborn and I had to feed him at 2 AM? ðŸ˜‚"

"No, more like... without an obvious reason? I keep waking up at 3:42 on the dot and it's creeping me out."

"Probably stress. Or maybe your upstairs neighbor has a weird schedule? Our bodies are sensitive to patterns."

That made sense. The guy above me did sometimes work nights. Maybe he was coming home or taking a shower at that time. I felt better having a potential explanation.

Until night four, when I woke at 3:42 AM to the distinct sound of footsteps in my living room.

Light, careful steps. The kind someone makes when they're trying not to be heard.

I lay frozen in bed, not breathing, my phone clutched in my hand with 911 pre-dialed. The footsteps stopped. Then came a soft scraping sound, like furniture being carefully moved.

I've never considered myself particularly brave, but something about the calculated nature of those movements filled me with more anger than fear. This was MY apartment. If someone had broken in, they had violated the one place I was supposed to feel safe.

I turned on my bedside lamp, grabbed the baseball bat I'd put there the day before (I'm not stupid), and walked to my bedroom doorway.

The living room was empty. The front door was still chained from the inside. All windows locked. Nothing appeared disturbed.

I checked the entire apartmentâ€”closets, behind the shower curtain, under the bed. I even looked in the fridge and cabinets, though logically I knew no adult could fit there. Nothing.

That's when I noticed my couch had moved about two inches from where it normally sat.

I didn't sleep again that night. In the morning light, I convinced myself I must have bumped the couch earlier while vacuuming and not noticed. The footsteps must have been from upstairs. Or a dream that had merged with waking.

I was starting to question my sanity, so I decided to be methodical. That evening, I took photos of every room in my apartment, paying special attention to the exact placement of furniture. I set up my laptop to record video of the living room all night. And I took a sleeping pill, hoping to sleep through whatever 3:42 AM had in store.

It didn't work.

My eyes opened at 3:42 AM, feeling like they'd been pried apart. The sleeping pill left me groggy, my limbs heavy, but my mind was alert to the absolute silence of my apartment. No footsteps tonight. Just the absence of the normal soundsâ€”no refrigerator hum, no heating system, not even street noise.

I felt like I was in a vacuum, the silence so complete it seemed to have physical presence, pressing against my eardrums.

Then my bedroom door slowly swung shut.

I hadn't touched it. There wasn't a draft. It moved with deliberate slowness until it clicked closed.

I couldn't move, the sleeping pill weighing my body down while my mind screamed to get up. The doorknob began to turn, rotating gradually, the internal mechanism making a faint clicking sound.

Using every ounce of willpower, I broke through the pharmaceutical paralysis and lunged for my phone, turning on the flashlight just as the door began to open again.

The light revealed nothing on the other side. The door continued to open until it touched the wall, revealing my empty living room.

I didn't sleep the rest of the night, sitting upright with every light on, the baseball bat across my lap.

In the morning, I checked my laptop recording with shaking hands.

At 3:42 AM, the video showed static for exactly one minute before resuming normal recording of my undisturbed living room.

I called out of work and spent the day researching carbon monoxide poisoning, temporal lobe seizures, and sleep disordersâ€”anything that could explain what was happening. I even called my landlord to ask if previous tenants had ever reported strange occurrences. He just laughed and said, "Like what, ghosts? The building's only fifteen years old, not exactly haunted mansion material."

I bought a carbon monoxide detector. Normal. I checked all the locks again. Secure. I even asked my neighbor if he'd heard anything strange. He hadn't.

Last night, I was determined to break the pattern. I went to stay at Mia's place, not telling her the full story, just saying my heating was acting up. I slept on her couch, her husband and five-year-old son asleep down the hall, finding comfort in the presence of other humans.

I woke up at 3:42 AM.

The living room was dark except for the glow of the cable box. Unlike at my apartment, I didn't feel afraid here. Just confused and increasingly frustrated at my broken brain or circadian rhythm or whatever was causing this.

Then I heard a small voice: "Who are you talking to?"

Mia's son stood in the hallway entrance, clutching a stuffed dinosaur, his eyes reflecting the dim light.

"I'm not talking to anyone, buddy," I whispered. "Just woke up for a minute. You should go back to bed."

He tilted his head, looking not at me but at the empty space next to the couch. "But you were talking to the tall man."

Every hair on my body stood on end.

"What tall man?" I asked, my mouth dry.

He pointed to the empty corner. "The one who followed you here. He's bending down to whisper in your ear."

I felt it thenâ€”the faintest breath against my ear, carrying that same burnt smell from before.

I'm writing this from my car outside a 24-hour diner where I've been since 4 AM. Mia thinks I got an early start to drive to my parents' house a few hours away. She doesn't know I have no intention of going there and putting them at risk.

It's 3:41 PM now. In twelve hours, it will be 3:41 AM, and a minute after that...

I don't know what's happening to me. I don't know if I'm experiencing some kind of mental break or if there's actually something following me. All I know is that child saw something I couldn't, and children don't make up very specific details like tall men whispering in people's ears.

I haven't slept more than two hours at a stretch in a week. I'm writing this because I need someone, anyone, to know what's happening, in case tonight is different. In case tonight, at 3:42 AM, I find out what it wants.

Because the most terrifying possibility isn't that I'm losing my mind.

It's that I'm perfectly sane, and something impossible has taken an interest in me.

And it's patient enough to claim just one minute of every night until it's ready for more.
