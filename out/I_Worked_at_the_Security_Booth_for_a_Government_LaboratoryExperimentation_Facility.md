My job was simple.

Inspect the car's license plate, check if they were registered into the employee handbook, then request for a keyword. Each employee had their own keywords to say at the entrance. Once they were cleared, I'd open the gate and allow them through. The only protection I had was a small handgun and the booth itself. I also worked the night shift, which only made the job feel more tense.

I inspected the first car to pass by's license plate, then checked the employee handbook for their name.

Carlo Grant.

"Keyword?" I asked.

"Anaconda." They answered. After flipping through the book to see if that was they're real keyword, I pressed the green button at the side of my desk, opening the gate. I watched as the car passed through.

Red, lock, star, cake, the keywords were endless in variety as I inspected more employees. The night dragged on.

Another car drove by, it's windows were tinted and barely open. I inspected the license plate then checked the book.

Aaron Katz.

"Keyword?" I asked.

"Listen man, I'm already pretty late, I'm not trying to get fired here, so just let me in alright?" He pleaded.

"I'm going to get fired too if anyone hears about me just letting people in without their codes. It'll take a minute." I walk out of the booth. Before I can take my gun out of the holster, the man rushes out of his car, bringing a double-barrel shotgun to my chin. I looked at his face. It was grotesque, everything was displaced. The man rips my walkie-talkie off my uniform and throws it onto the ground. It shattered into pieces.

"Open the gate." The man's finger tightened around the trigger as I continued sweating profusely, clicking the green button. I caught a glimpse inside his car. There was a body-bag lying on the backseat. Probably the REAL Aaron Katz. He drove off into the facility.

It was a very interesting experience. I had my fair share of reporters trying to sneak into the facility, but this was new. 

A few hours passed by, I inspected a few other people and let them in. Suddenly, the phone on my desk began ringing, I picked it up.

***"Calling all security personnel to the facility. The director has issued a widespread lockdown protocol."*** 

The words repeated as I placed the phone down. I was technically in the security division, so I ran over to the facility. Sirens blared around me. "What could've been so bad?" I wondered. At the time, I had never been in the facility before. The metal door sealed shut behind me as I entered the East wing, as apart of lockdown protocol.

My surroundings were sealed by the bright red lights produced by the alarms. I saw no other security guards of the sort as I dug deeper towards the core of the facility. 

I turned a corner, before paralyzing in fear. A guard, with half his limbs ribbed off his torso. I walked up to him, holding in vomit. He pleaded for help, but he was beyond any help I could provide. I gently shut his eyes as he stopped breathing. 

What happened? How could things have gotten so bad? Was this the doing of the man I let in? I travelled even deeper, before finally coming across the main portion of the facility. The metal gate was ripped oven, the sign was torn off to the side, but it read "experimentation district." The doors to the cubicle cells were all open. All the experiments were running loose around the facility. Not all of the testing chambers were empty, however. 

I watched as something crawled out of the chamber towards the edge of the room. It was humanoid. It began running at man as I unholstered me gun.

"Hey! Freeze!" It didn't freeze, but I did when I saw what it truly was. My pupils shrunk and I grit my teeth in fear, tensing up all my muscles.

A person.

They had plants growing out of their eyes, their mouths, their nostrils, their arm and leg hair had been converted to moss. I opened fire, shooting the person three times as they toppled over. Then once more to put them out of their misery. I began to panic when I realized they had put some kind of sharp quill into my shin. I took the pointy thing out and tossed it aside. Out of nowhere, I began to twitch repeatedly, my vision distored into green. I was in a great pain as I toppled over. I think I remember puking, but not much else after I blacked out.

I'm writing this from my laptop, in the hospital. Turns out, just a few minutes after I passed out the security protocol ended. The guards successfully terminated all of the subjects, not without heavy casualties though. The director of the facility was in fact, conducting illegal experiments. The guy I let in killed the director and set the experiments free before turning the gun on himself. A few small trees grew off my body. These were surgically removed after medical personnel escorted me to a hospital. I don't think the news will cover this. I've heard that the Co-director has done a good job keeping this situation under wraps. I did, however, get fired for letting the man in through the gate. This whole experience has been truly surreal. A part of me is sad I didn't explore more of the facility, since what I faced alone was so mysterious already.
