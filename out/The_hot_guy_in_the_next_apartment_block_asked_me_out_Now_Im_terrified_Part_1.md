It all started with the damned dog. At least I want to believe that’s when it started. Because the alternative – if it isn’t just all one huge coincidence – scares the life out of me.

Well, anyway, it was the stupidest way you could think of to get acquainted with someone – and I managed it. Not deliberately, of course. I was just hurrying to get indoors to my apartment as usual, carrying my usual baggage when the dog came running over and barked up at me ecstatically, capering round at my feet. And in the clumsiest fashion imaginable, I managed to trip over the damned thing, and instantly wished myself dead. In fact, I could quite easily have died of humiliation then and there.

There I was, sprawling over the ground with my bag and books strewn all over the place and that goddamned dog now actually trying to lick my face through my hair which had spilled every which way, like the rest. Pretty undignified position to be in, right? And not just tripping over any dog, but a dog belonging to the hottest guy I could remember having laid eyes on in quite some time. Well, presumably it belonged to him. He was always taking it out for walks anyway. I would always see him going to and from the apartment block next to mine. And now, although I’d been giving him covert admiring glances for weeks this was the first time he’d acknowledged *my* existence, as he came hurrying over with a stern reprimand for the dog and apologies for me. And before I knew it he was beside me helping me up. I got to my feet in a daze while he began to pick up my scattered things apologizing all the while. ‘I’m so sorry. Are you OK? Jessie, sit!’ he added in a tone which brooked no denial. Jessie sat down at his side, tail wagging unceasingly.

I began to come to myself. ‘Yes, I’m fine, honestly. No need to apologize. Really.’ I almost grabbed my stuff from him. ‘Thanks.’ I was aware I was blushing furiously but I couldn’t do anything about it. I had never even imagined I would ever speak to him.

 He still hung around with an air of concern. ‘She just broke loose. Jessie. She’s still a puppy,’ as if I’d asked for an explanation. ‘You *sure* you’re ok?’

Why was it so hard to believe? Did I really look that awful? Come to think of it, I probably did. Too lonely and self-pitying, was my trouble. No boyfriend to speak of, not much family; hardly a social circle at all, in fact. And then this completely gorgeous guy all of a sudden fussing around me on account of a complete accident.

Or was it? Was it an accident?

 

Anyway, that’s how it all started. I never *really* expected anything further to come of it, of course. He was no doubt relieved that the plain clumsy girl from the next block hadn’t actually injured herself falling over his unruly pet and of course I was similarly relieved that I hadn’t managed to hurt his dog by landing on top of her or something. Basically, we were just thankful that neither of us had cause to sue the other, I guess, and that’s as far as I ever expected things to go. But next time I saw him coming from his block, when I had just emerged from mine, he actually made eye contact, smiled and said hi. And that’s how it always was after that. Seemed like I couldn’t just slink past him any more trying to make myself invisible and all. Finally, he’d noticed me. And though we hadn’t actually become friends or anything as yet, I felt somehow that was going to happen too.

And that set the alarm bells ringing.

 

It *did* happen –just a week after that memorable first meeting. This time, when I ran into him outside my block, he not only smiled but initiated a proper conversation. And I felt it was just too rude to rush off leaving him still talking, or something. So I stood there, trying not to fidget nervously while he introduced himself as Noah and revealed, as I’d long suspected, that he was a college student like myself. Not the same college, though. I nodded and smiled  but even though I was scarcely contributing to the conversation he didn’t seem put off. And he rang off with one of those bewitching smiles of his which left me in such a daze that I started back to my apartment before remembering that I’d just come out. I couldn’t even remember what he’d said his name was. Noah, or Nathan, or what? Hell, I just hoped I’d remembered to introduce *myself.*

 

Things have really spiraled since.

Makes it sound like a disaster, right? Whereas, on the face of it, it’s anything but. Noah and I are going together now, pretty much. I mean, it’s still not totally official, or anything, but we’re meeting up for coffee and lunch and stuff (with or without Jessie). And he’s casually let slip that he recently broke up with his girlfriend Brianna while I have been as unattached as it’s possible to be in recent years, like I was saying. He seems to enjoy my company and I can’t pretend that I don’t enjoy his, at least when I’m making an effort to listen to what he’s actually saying and not just being mesmerized by his eyes and his smile, *and* the rest. Sound like a particularly cliched romance novel, don’t I? But my biggest fear is that actually it’s all heading towards a very different genre. The horror genre, if you will. That’s why I’m posting here, for God’s sake. While I wait for things to unfold.

I just can’t rid myself of the feeling that it’s all unnatural, all this. Looking at it objectively, the whole situation is bound to raise a few eyebrows. Because, put simply, I’m no looker and he sure as hell is. Well alright, I’m not downright ugly and I don’t think I’m putting myself down unnecessarily, but I’m just trying to be realistic. What the hell does he see in me?

I have to try and think it out.

Is he still riddled with guilt over the fact that his dog tripped me up and he’s still trying to make it up to me? Well, ok, that’s pretty ridiculous. That can’t be it.

Does he like me for my brains? Again, I’m not stupid but I’m not especially smart or anything, either. I don’t have a lively glowing personality and as far as I can tell we don’t even have many of the same interests. One or two, like certain books and stuff, but not much beyond that.

And yet he insists on us meeting up quite regularly now, and while we haven’t actually kissed or anything, yet, something tells me that’s not far off either. Unless I break it off completely from my side. But I don’t think I’m capable of that. He’s too good looking, and I’ve been alone for too long. But my feeling of unease never quite leaves.

*Is* there something more sinister behind it all? Like, is he really an unsuspected serial killer, and a shy lonely girl like me is easy pickings? Maybe he’s a *budding* serial killer and just wants to practise on me first?

Even more ridiculous, right?

Or what if he’s just at a point in his life when he’s totally bored for whatever reason and is just having some fun with me for a while before he drops me like the proverbial hot potato.

And why am I catastrophizing so much, you might say? I might as well enjoy it while it lasts.

But I can’t. Not really. Like I said, it’s – unnatural. Things like this don’t happen to someone like me, in the ordinary way of things. Life is not a goddamned romance novel. Miracles like this don’t happen. There has to be a price.

I know there will be. Because, after all, why has this happened – *now*?

 

Well, finally it’s official.

We’re an item. And he still hasn’t murdered me and his ex hasn’t come back swearing vengeance and nothing has dropped on my head from the sky. Well I did have a bit of a ding with my car the other day of course, leaving a pretty sizeable dent in front and some most unwelcome repair bills, but that’s all. I wasn’t in the least bit hurt although I was shaken. I honestly thought for a moment that this was it, this was the price I had to pay for all my impossible good luck in snagging (was that really what had happened??) a guy like Noah. But the worst thing to come out of it was having to work extra shifts at the diner where I’ve been helping out for a year now. That’s one place I don’t think I’ll be staying much longer. Shelley, my boss, is becoming pretty damn unbearable. She’s *always* been unbearable, in fact. I can’t even think why I’ve stuck it there so long. No initiative I guess. But I have to get out of that kind of mindset now. Now that I’ve got Noah.

But I’m terrified I don’t have him. Not really. That it’s not going to last. And that something terrible is going to happen. If not to me, then to him, or ….

 

And it’s finally happened. The reason, surely,  why I’ve been feeling all this dread.

When I went into work for an extra shift yesterday, at the beginning of the weekend, the place was still shut. They let me in, of course, as an employee, but everyone was standing around crying. Well, Denise and Kayleigh, anyway, while Tom and Jeff looked grave.

‘Didn’t you hear?’

What?

‘It’s Shelley.’

My heart dropped.

‘She’s … she’s dead.’

In a fog, I heard the babble of voices, saying what had happened. When she’d been driving home late last night. An accident. Seemingly a hit-and-run. No trace of the perpetrator. She’d died in hospital, early this morning.

‘It can’t be true,’ I cried out wildly. ‘It can’t.’

They all looked at me curiously, like they thought I’d killed her, or something. And my greatest fear is that I did. Or as good as.
