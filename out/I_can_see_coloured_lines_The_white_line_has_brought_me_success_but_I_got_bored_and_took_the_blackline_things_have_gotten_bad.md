You know, I really couldn't say when I first saw the lines.  
  
I mean, sure, I know it was sometime after getting kicked out of the fifth casino in some for starting a fight with the wrong guys, and that’s when I saw them for sure. Brightly coloured lines cutting straight across the gravel parking lot, leading me back to my parents after I had gotten lost on that road trip. But before that? I really couldn't say. Maybe I had seen them before, mistaking them for pavement lines and supermarket markings.  
Regardless. After I noticed them, I couldn't help it. I saw them everywhere. Two lines, red and green, etched into the ground like they were marked in paint. No one else could see them. I'd commented on them once, to my friends, they thought I was crazy.   
  
But I watched, as they wove their way in and out of my life, and, as one does, I inevitably found myself overwhelmed with the need to investigate them, to see where they led. The curiosity was more than I could take. The memory of that first time was too fresh in my mind, of the whiteline leading me straight back to safety. I grabbed a bottle of water and a snack, and I followed the lines. The whiteline, of course. White is good and Black is bad, right? ( I swear I’m not racist) It just seemed smarter that way. It had taken me on a winding, twisting path, deeper and deeper into the city, until at last I found myself at a private banker’s association being held that afternoon.  
  
I had no idea that something like that was even a thing, but my interest was piqued. I decided - I wanted to do something like that with my life. And I looked at that little whiteline with newfound respect.  
  
Over and over, I followed it. And time after time, my life was rewarded for it. It took me to the front door of a prep school where I met Mr. Graves, whose tutoring I hold directly responsible for getting me into my first solid job, a few years down the road. It led me out of danger, as a kitchen fire burned out of control in my school. And, it crossed my path with that of the woman of my dreams. Literally. We smacked into each other in a crosswalk.  
  
So, here I was. I was 29, and the world was at my fingertips. I manage trillion dollar assets. I looked out the window of my top-floor penthouse, gazing down at the city below. The walls were covered with the awards I had won, best banker for three consecutive years. My lovely, smart, beautiful wife was in the other room, reading a book as she brewed coffee.  
  
For so long, I'd relied on that invisible line to guide my steps. It hadn't bothered me when I was finally making more money, because there was always a casino to gamble it away at, but with the white line, every gamble became less and less interesting. I wondered if this had all really been for the best. Had I just taken the easy path? Had I gone with the flow, and given up on taking my life into my own hands? It kept me up at night, I'll be honest.  
  
And through it all, it burned, in the corner of my vision. That blackline. It seared into my sight like it was on fire. It demanded attention, begging for me to give it the shot I'd only ever given its white brother.  
  
And so I grabbed an old messenger bag out of the closet, a remnant from my Safari days. I threw in bottles of water, and a pocket knife. A charge cable for my phone, and a granola bar. I laughed to myself, as I saw it. It looked so much like the bag I had packed, all those years ago, when I first walked the whiteline. But that felt right, you know?  
  
I slipped out the door, with a quick goodbye to my wife. She accepted my excuses of taking a walk without hesitation, pressing a kiss to my cheek and wishing me a good day. I smiled to myself, as I left the house. She was the best thing that the whiteline had ever gotten me.  
And then I stepped onto the blackline, and took gamble; a thrill I long lost at work.  
  
Once again, it led me into the city, deeper and deeper. But where the whiteline had taken me straight towards the centre of activity, leading me towards schools and conference centres, the blackline seemed to be taking me right to the worst part of town. I flinched away from seedy glares, eyeing my bag and the make of my coat, as I hurried onwards.  
I hoped this wasn't going to be the last mistake I ever made.  
The buildings around me loomed higher, the roads and streets giving way to narrow alleys. I was about to give up, to declare this a fool's errand and turn back. And then I heard her crying.  
"Please. Please, no. I swear I won't say anything. I don't have any money, I- I don't have anything. Please just let me go, and I swear I won't ever-"  
"Shut it."  
The woman's voice was high, reedy with fear, and her tears threatened to overwhelm her words entirely. It stopped me in my tracks, before I even had a chance to hear him speak. The voices were coming from ahead. The blackline burned, inviting me onwards. Almost against my will, I found my feet moving forward. And then I saw her, huddled on the ground in a mass of scarf and hair. A man was in front of her, kneeling, with her purse torn open in front of him. He dug through it, tossing receipts and makeup cases aside carelessly as he looked for anything valuable.  
In his other hand, he held a gun. It pointed at her lazily, weaving back and forth as he eviscerated the bag. They were right there, no more than twenty feet in front of me. Neither of them saw me. The man's back was to me, and the woman was in no state to notice. My hand plunged into the bag slung over my shoulder, latching reflexively around the familiar shape of my knife. I didn't know what I was going to do with it, but having it in my hand made me feel a little better.  
I needed to call the cops. This was all wrong. There was no way I could do anything to help her. I was just going to end up getting her killed, or myself, or both of us. He had a gun. What could I possibly do against gun.  
But then I hesitated. A dark thought crossed my mind, a selfish desire to save myself from potential danger. What if I didn't intervene? What if I let this unfold, knowing that my presence was the catalyst for this dangerous situation?  
I swore under my breath, torn between the moral obligation to help and the selfish instinct to protect myself. The woman's cries grew louder, desperation and fear echoing through the alley. The man's finger tightened on the trigger.  
I took a step back, grabbing a piece of wood off a pallet nearby, but my resolve crumbling. The woman's eyes locked onto mine, pleading for help. In that moment of hesitation, the man saw me from behind, high off a blend of drugs fired by accident. The gunshot echoed through the narrow alley, and the woman's cries abruptly silenced.  
I stood there, paralyzed by guilt and regret, as the man shoved me aside and fled the scene. The woman lay on the ground, a victim of my inaction. I should have done something. I should have been her saviour, but I let fear and selfishness guide me.  
As the reality of my failure sunk in, I knew that I could never undo the harm that had been done. The weight of responsibility for her harm rested squarely on my shoulders, and I was left haunted by the consequences of my cowardice, and so I ran off.  
I looked down at the ground. The blackline shone brightly in front of me, tempting me to follow it to the unknown. To the left, the whiteline blinked on and off, signalling a safe exit from this hellhole. I decided to take it, after witnessing a brutal murder that I had no part in. I needed to report the crime to the authorities, but I didn't want to get involved. I followed the whiteline out of the dark alley, back to the main street where people and vehicles passed by. I felt a wave of relief wash over me, until I saw a police officer.  
He stopped in his tracks, blocking the whiteline's path. I froze for a second, then blurted out that I heard a woman scream a few meters behind me. He nodded and gave me a reassuring pat on the shoulder, then ran towards the crime scene.  
I continued along the whiteline, grateful to be away from the gruesome scene. However, as I walked further, the obstacles seemed to intensify. The whiteline led me to a series of closed-off alleys and construction sites, forcing me to navigate through a maze of barriers and detours. It seemed like every turn I took led me further away from the safety of the main street.  
I felt a growing frustration, realizing that I was being led astray by the seemingly erratic path of the whiteline. The obstacles became more challenging—fences, locked gates, and dead ends. It was as if the environment itself conspired to keep me away from the straightforward path I desperately sought.  
As I struggled to find my way, I heard distant sirens approaching. The police were on their way to the crime scene I had reported. The weight of my inaction bore down on me, and I knew I had to find a way back to the blackline to confront the consequences of my cowardice.  
The whiteline continued to guide me through a series of convoluted turns, but with each obstacle overcome, the path became clearer. It was as if the challenges were a test of my determination and willingness to face the consequences of my actions.  
Eventually, after overcoming several hurdles, I found whiteline, slowly turning black, as I found myself on track to something I hadn’t wanted a part in. My stomach twisted as I realised that I had no way out. I searched for my wallet hoping to catch a nearby taxi, but it had slipped out somewhere.. Maybe beside the dead girl? ‘Fuck, Fuck, Fuck!’, I thought to myself, as the sirens seem to ring more closely. I could try to call my wife, but my phone battery had mysteriously died, and I hadn’t bothered to memorise her number.  
  
The blackline was turning, down a different alley. It led half a block down, and then cut straight up to the front door of a little shack.  
  
I could see a tiny, hazy tendril of smoke, rolling out from under the side door.  
The line burned, screaming a deep beating darkness in its urgency. It seared a line into my vision as I looked down the alley. I paused, caught deep in thoughts. Questions, that had been lingering in my head for years, maybe I was meant to help the people I found on the trail of black.  
  
The smoke was growing, swelling by the second. I half turned, releasing the woman's hand and giving her a reassuring smile.   
  
The side door still smouldered ominously. The line blazed a trail ahead of my feet, leading straight across the sidewalk, up the narrow steps, and right to the front door of the sad little building that sat squeezed between two larger structures. I skidded to a halt.  
  
The smoke was coming from the other door. Wouldn’t it make more sense to check there first?  
But the blackline was there, bright and insistent that no, this was where I needed to be. I hesitated for a moment more, doubting if I should be trusting a figment of my imagination over what my eyes and nose were telling me, and then gave up. I had already come this far. I had trusted the blackline enough to follow it all the way out here, and wound up stabbing some guy wielding a gun. I was already committed.  
I paused for a moment, taking in the gravity of the situation. The smoke and fire that surrounded me seemed to have no effect on my well-being. It was an odd realization, one that sent a shiver down my spine. I had been drawn to this place, not as a saviour, but perhaps as a harbinger of something else.  
The broken window allowed me to peer into the building, revealing the chaos within. I clenched my knife, stained with a previous encounter, and smashed the glass. A furious voice approached, demanding an explanation for my actions. The man, a local resident, was met with my indifference as I reached for the door handle, my immunity to the escalating smoke becoming increasingly apparent.  
"Call the cops. Call the fire department while you're at it," I retorted, focused on the task at hand. With determined effort, I managed to unlock the door just as the approaching man questioned the safety of those inside. The door swung open, releasing a torrent of smoke and heat.  
As the building's interior revealed itself, I couldn't ignore the consequences of my impulsive actions. The fire had quickly consumed the space, and the elderly couple inside struggled with injuries. “I’m fine, but Bea is hurt! I-I can’t lift her!” He screamed back, his voice thin. I frowned, looking closer. Sure enough, her leg was bent at an unnatural angle. I sighed as the pieces began to fall into place. I could see it, playing out in my head.  
The man pleaded for help, explaining that his partner, Bea, was injured and unable to move, but from the corner of my sight, I noticed a figure, vaguely human, but what was it? No, I had no time for it, as Bea ached out in pain. I focused my attention onto Bea ignoring the soot of the air, but I was too late, their gas powered stove, still on beside them exploded leaving the entire room ablaze. I heard the blast, but I was still intact, I could still see; their burning flesh; I could still hear them; choke on smoke to their death; My skin remained cool, as theirs goldened. It was too much, as I screamed for help before fainting.  
Having fallen asleep. The realization hit me hard, I wasn’t meant to help these people fight for their life, I was simply meant to watch them die. The blackline had turned to a harbinger on death, asleep my mind turned back to the moment I first saw the lines; a young twenty-something at Safari, I had lost a gamble with a drunk man, he claimed to be a witch doctor, I laughed at the idea, but every native person there seemed to be afraid, and actively avoid the man.  
  
The owner, Terry, had even told me, “Don’t bet on something you’re going to regret doing, even if it’s a joke to you, don’t mess with these people.”  
  
I brushed him aside, scoffed as I begged the waiter for another drink, I bet my soul away for the chance to see how to succeeded, but if I ever got bored, I would get a chance to see people who choose to go into the wrong alley, choose to leave their stove on, as they thought they would be back in a few minutes, I witnessed the mistakes of others; It was a curse I was given.  
  
I soon awoke from my dream disoriented. As I was lifted, my head bobbled about, as I could see the blackline led the way. I tried to steer the men whom appeared to be firefighters away, but there was no hope. I saw the remains of others I couldn’t save, as the firefighters tightened their grips around me, hoping I make it through the blaze.  
  
The lead firefighter hoped to axe a wooden beam that fell from the roof, but he stumbled down. His legs finally gave out from exhaustion as he fell. My mind raced as I watched him, clutching onto the other firefighter before grabbing a hold of the both of them.  
  
I couldn’t carry the men, each 6’4 200 pounds. There was no way. My arms were already leaden and heavy from one of them; there’s no way I’d be able to make it, I seemed invincible, but still so weak.    
  
The greyline blazed in front of me, as I pulled the firefighters by their collars. My eyes were locked onto the line, hunched form, half hidden behind the clouds of smoke.   
  
“Over here!” they hollered.  
I could see it, the bright sky, sirens, and gasping crowds. through the wall of smoke, a glimmer of salvation. The front door loomed, a rectangle of cool, grey air. Just a few more steps, a few more agonizing breaths. My muscles screamed in protest, but I pushed on, the greyline guiding me like a luminous lifeline.

  
With a final heave, I burst through the doorway, collapsing onto the damp grass. The crisp autumn air tore into my lungs, a painful caress compared to the inferno I'd escaped.   
Around us, the crowd buzzed with a nervous excitement. Sirens wailed in the distance, racing towards the dying embers of the disaster. I lay there, watching the smoke rise like a ghostly shroud, the blackline fading from my vision, leaving behind a hollow ache in its wake.  
“He needs help! Back there. Help him up.”  
  
I crawled to a stop gathering my breath. The other fighter fighters grabbed their friends, but I was too late, I was too slow. I wasn't a hero. I wasn't a saviour. I was simply a harbinger, a black moth drawn to the flames, my touch leaving ashes in its wake.  
  
They all looked at me with fear, shame, anger, and disgust. I survived and 66 people died, and I was the only survivor. The last thing I wanted to deal with right now was prying questions. Dealing with massive body count, nobody noticed that I walked out, but as turned my head to walk off, I noticed the black line, curving off to the side. I knew I couldn’t avoid it anymore, but I had to try and get to my wife.
