Last year I stopped being able to sleep.

It lasted for months, and I tried everything I could think of.

No matter how tired I was, no matter how heavy my eyes were, when I laid down sleep eluded me like a song I couldn’t quite remember.

One night when I was closing in on 48 hours of no sleep, I stumbled out of my room, begging for my dad to do something, anything, to help me.

I found him standing over his desk and staring down at the dollhouse. It was the kind with the top open so you can see into every room. Both of his hands were inside. His forearms twitched as he moved things around. His breaths quickened as I entered the room.

“Dad?” I said. It was all I could muster, my eyes drooped with the deceptive feeling that I might fall asleep as I spoke.

He pulled backward so fast that the house tumbled off the desk, landing at his feet. Out spilled three dolls. He frantically scooped everything up, placing the dolls back inside the house and the house back on the desk. 

“S-sorry.”

“No worries,” he said, smiling at me with quivering lips and wide, frantic eyes. “D-do you wanna see what I’ve been working on?”

“I told you no.”

“Get out then!” He yelled. “Out!”

He slammed the door shut behind me. 

“Screw you,” I yelled. Suddenly I was so dizzy that I had to hug the wall as I walked up to my room.

I took four excedrin, put on my headphones, and closed my eyes until the world stopped spinning.  

A few minutes later I was scrolling Twitter, desperate for a distraction, when one of those promoted tweets caught my eye:

***Are you having trouble falling asleep at night? Look no further, YourSleepingFriend is here to help!***

 *Google really is spying on me,* I thought. But there was a video attached, so I paused my music and hit play.

The video showed an empty beach. In the background, calm blue waves ran up the shore. There were several moments of silence, and then a man began to speak in a low, slow whisper. At each word, the sound switched from my right ear to my left, and the syllables reverberated over each other.

“I’m YourSleepingFriend, and I’m here to help you get to sleep. On my channel, you’ll find all kinds of videos dedicated to relaxing your mind. I have nature sounds, ASMR, white noise, and a plethora of other options. Find what you need, and never spend another night tossing and turning.”

The whole ASMR whisper-talking thing he was doing was kinda creepy, but I was desperate, so I clicked the link to his YouTube channel and started to sort through the videos. 

There were dozens to choose from, but I started with “8 Hours of Nature Sounds to Pull You Down.”

There were faint sounds of running water, birds chirping, and leaves rustling in the wind. It made me feel like I was in a different world. No headache, no pain. I didn’t have to worry about school, my dad, or *that night.* The birds were my friends, the water and the leaves were a gentle song lulling me to sleep. After a few minutes, I turned onto my side and closed my eyes.

But in the darkness the sounds seemed to shift and change. The running water was a growling predator, the birds were a horde of crows waiting to make a meal of me, and the wind and the leaves were a menacing whisper in the distance.

Before long I was sweating and gripping my sheets so hard my hands hurt. I opened my eyes and turned off the video. I took a deep breath. *Come on, man. Just go to sleep.* 

But I couldn’t. Twenty minutes of lying down with my eyes closed did nothing. I needed something to drown out the silence.

“10 Hours of White Noise to Help You Drift Away”

I could see why they called it white noise. It reminded me of T.V. static, yet this sound seemed to take up more room in my head, like there was some sort of smoke attached to it. It was slowly flowing through my ears and into every crevice of my brain. 

For a moment there was nothing except the sound. I relaxed a little and closed my eyes. But in the instant I did, for just a fleeting second, I saw white inside of darkness. Like I was inside of an empty word document.

There was a whisper. Soft and calling to me, but I wasn’t able to make out the words.

With a sharp gasp, I opened my eyes.

My heart hammered in my chest. I sat completely still. I couldn’t shake the feeling that the sound—the smoke, was an invading army. And that the whisper was a warning.

I ripped the headphones from my ears and turned off the video.

*The dark does funny things to your mind,* I told myself. *Especially when you haven’t slept in two days.*

I checked the time on my phone. *4:00 AM*. *If I go to sleep now I can still sleep for three hours.* I closed my eyes once more.

In the dark, eerie silence, the memories came flooding back. The screams. My mom lying in a puddle of her own blood. Her eyes, open, but void of life.

Wind whispered through the branches outside, and I remembered how slowly the front door had creaked open, how I’d assumed it was my dad coming home early from his business trip.

*No more of that,* I thought, coming back to the present.

I wanted to get up from bed and flip on the light, but it seemed so far away. I’d have to pass the void of uncertainty that was the shadows under my bed. I couldn’t help but feel that there was something under there waiting for me, that there was a sound, but one that I couldn’t quite hear. I couldn’t get up. I grabbed my phone.

I was already on the channel. Figured I’d try another video. One of them had to work for me. Afterall, the thoughts hadn’t come back until I stopped, right?

“10 Hours of Black Noise to Bring You Peace”

This video had no apparent sound, but rather, white letters over a black background. It read simply, “Black Noise.” The text faded away, and the video began to transition through slides like a powerpoint.

**What is black noise?**

**It is no noise…**

**Silence…**

**But I think you’ll enjoy the silence…**

**The darkness…**

**Maybe you’ll find peace…**

I felt my stomach rise in my throat. My breaths came out rapid, short, and sharp.

**10 hours of black noise starting in….**

**3**

**2**

**1**

I closed my eyes, not sure if it was voluntary or not, and saw myself from the eyes of an observer. A different me, floating in a space of infinite darkness. My eyes were closed and there was a smile of pure bliss on my face. 

This version of me was sinking into the darkness. So slowly that it took me several moments to notice. I smiled. I was happy for him, and my breaths began to match his. My consciousness began to fade as sleep pulled me in.

Suddenly I was falling so fast that the wind pulled around me.

My feet landed on cool white tile floor. A kitchen. I looked around at the wooden cabinetry, mahogany dinner table, and the light blue walls. It wasn’t just a kitchen. It was my kitchen.

Then there was that whisper, coming from the other side of the wall—the living room. This time it was a little louder.  Loud enough that I could make out the words. 

“Come with me,” it said in that low voice, the syllables echoing over each other. 

*YourSleepingFriend*.

I walked into the room.

He would have been an average looking man, five foot ten or eleven, average frame, but the skin on his face was deathly pale, almost translucent. The closer I got to him the colder I felt.

He wore a tuxedo, and his right hand carried the hook of a beautiful dreamcatcher. The web in the middle was yellow and made to resemble four flowers leaning against each other. At the bottom, four black crow feathers hung vertically. They swung back and forth as he turned and began walking towards my dad’s room.

“Come,” he said. And I did.

I followed him through the living room and into the bedroom. The T.V. was on and playing Criminal Minds. My mom’s favorite show. 

*This isn’t my dad’s room,* I thought. *This is my parents’ room. Before it became my dad’s room.*

I screamed, “NO!” But as I did there was a man’s voice from the bathroom, forceful—angry. I couldn’t make out the words, but I knew it wasn’t my dad.

And then there were the muffled, horrified screams of my mother. My mother whose mouth had been covered with tape, and who I hadn’t found until nearly six hours after her death.

“You’re gonna make me watch!” I yelled, backing up toward the doorway.

He was standing just beside the bathroom door. The dreamcatcher was now hanging from the doorknob. He held his hands behind his back and stared at me patiently as my mother struggled and screamed.

“No!” I screamed again, and this time I turned and ran out the doorway, up the stairs, and into my room.

I jumped on my bed and got under the covers like I was seven again, hiding from the boogeyman and waiting for the sun to come out.

Instead, my alarm was ringing. It was time to go to school.

My day went about as normal. Any excess energy the few hours of sleep had given me wore off by the time I got to school, and I walked around in my typical daze. When I got home that evening, my dad slammed his office door shut. 

A few hours later, I took my melatonin, counted backwards from one hundred, and then laid still with my eyes closed for what must have been twenty minutes. Nothing worked.

*Except,* I thought. *There is one thing.*

It did put me to sleep right? And I was sure I’d just imagined all the scary bits: the whispers, the visions, and the dream. The only thing I knew for a fact was that it helped me sleep, if only for a few hours. And I hadn’t woken up screaming, shaking, or crying. Just a little unsettled.

I threw on my headphones, opened up the channel, and hit play on the video. 

There was the intro, the slides, and then the darkness. I took a deep breath and closed my eyes. 

Within a few minutes I was floating. Then the fall: I was in the kitchen.

Finally, the whisper: “Come with me.”

This time I turned the corner and looked into his fading yellow eyes. “Why?” I asked. “Why do you want to make me watch?”

“Not watch,” he said. “I’m here to bring you peace.”

He turned and walked to my parents’ bedroom. I followed. Again, upon entering the room he hung the dreamcatcher on the bathroom doorknob, then stared at me until I approached.

I heard the man barking his orders, then the muffled screams of my mom. This time I opened the door and ran inside. 

“Mom!” I yelled. She was on the floor with duct tape covering her mouth. A tall man with broad shoulders and a large knife was standing over her.

I ran forward to tackle him and take the knife, but he was a grown man and I was only a kid. He threw me to the side with one arm, then stepped toward me and slashed at me with the knife. I dodged backwards and fell, crashing against the wall.

My mom took the moment's distraction to stand up and hit him from behind. 

He turned and with one swift motion slit her throat.

I let out a torturous scream. As if he’d forgotten about me, the man jumped and turned, then strided toward me.

I woke up when the blade was about an inch away from my head.

My sheets were drenched in sweat, and I was breathing like I’d just run a marathon. In the back of my mind there was the feeling that I’d been close to death. 

Those events were real. What I went through wasn’t a dream, but an alternate reality. One in which I had checked on my mother that night.

After some time I sat up. The first thing I noticed was the object sitting on my nightstand. It was the dreamcatcher, as beautiful as in my dream. Attached to it was a blue sticky-note. I picked it up and turned it over.

*Not a new reality, but the truth. Your Peace. Use this when you need it.*

*-YourSleepingFriend*

It might not seem like what he gave me was a gift, the vision of my near death at the hands of an intruder, but what he did was answer all the questions I’d asked myself every single day since my mom died: what if I hadn’t stayed in bed? What if I had tried to save her? Was it my fault that she died?

It wasn’t my fault, and I couldn’t have saved her. It was no one’s fault except for the man who walked into our house and killed her. The guilt began to fade away. Not all at once, but it was a start.

I picked up the dreamcatcher and walked downstairs. My dad was asleep at his desk, his arms resting on either side of the dollhouse. I put my hand on his shoulder and for the first time I looked inside.

The girl doll was in the bathroom upstairs. A male doll was in front of her, a small plastic stick sharpened to look like a knife was glued to his hand. Behind him was the other male doll, legs positioned one in front of the other to show that he was running forward.

With tears in my eyes I kissed my dad on the back of his head and placed the dreamcatcher in his lap.

I couldn’t give him a new reality, but I could give him a chance to make a new memory. I could show him the truth. I could, perhaps, bring him peace. Answers. [Maybe I could even get him back.](https://www.reddit.com/user/ConnorIsaacWriter/comments/1poetct/thanks_for_reading/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
