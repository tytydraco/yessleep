My name is Marcus, and I have the most incredible job on the planet... but I want it to end.

Ten years ago I was a complete nobody, a IT guy in a dead end job. Had almost no friends, and couldn't get laid if my life depended on it. But right now? I'm sitting in a penthouse suite in Dubai, sipping thousand-edollar whiskey while my Interface scans every person in my field of vision. The sun is setting over the Persian Gulf, painting the sky in shades of orange and purple that my augmented vision could break down into exact wavelengths of light. Yesterday, I was in Prague, hunting something with too many eyes and teeth that had torn its way through the fabric of reality. Tomorrow or next week? Could be anywhere. Tokyo, Rio, New York. All I have to do is step into a teleporter – an actual honest-to-god teleporter – and I'm there.

Oh yeah, you probably raised an eyebrow at the terms “Interface”, “Augmentations”, or “Teleporters”.

No way those exists on 21st-century Earth. Hah, think again.

The people I work for – hell, I’m not even sure if they are actually *people* – call me a "Sentinel", and they are well past the current worlds technological level. I don’t want to say their name, but they are an organization you’ve never heard of. I’ll just call them my Benefactors… and they got technology that’s so advanced it might as well be goddamn magic.

Think the Men in Black movies, but instead of sending Will Smith to crack jokes and say “WooooOOOooo” to alien refugees and cute talking pugs… my Benefactors send *me* to deal with nine-dimensional Eldritch Abominations and the occasional Alternate Universe Hitler that found a way into our timeline. And yes, I’ve killed a few Hitlers… and let me tell you, you haven’t lived until an alternate universe Hitler tries to strangle you with his ten-foot prehensile dick that fires a napalm like substance. Yeah, *that* was fun.

They call these things “Intruders”. That’s the catch-all term they use for any being from outside our universe that shouldn’t be here. There are many types of Intruders, all with different long, fancy-sounding technical designations. But I’ve come up with my own slang for each type, words like “Glitchers”, “Tanglers”, “Warpers”, etc. But not all of them are monstrous tentacle creatures: sometimes we get humans from alternate realities, like the Hitlers I mentioned earlier. If an Intruder is a human, most of the time it's some scientists who's teleportation or wormhole experiment went wrong and they got sucked into our Universe. When it comes to these unlucky idiots, my Benefactors can apparently send them back to their reality... so long as they surrender and coming willingly. I once ran into an alternate universe OJ Simpson, who in his universe became a brilliant scientist instead of a football star. You should have seen the look on his face when I told him what our OJ Simpson ended up doing.

Oh yeah, so about my capabilities… I am a legitimate superhuman. Hell, I might be straight-up *trans*human. I don’t say that to brag or boast, I say it as fact. My Benefactors augmented me with the type of enhancements you see only in sci-fi media: enhanced muscle density, reinforced skeletal structure, accelerated healing. I can overturn pickup truck with ease, and can heal damn near any wound within six-hour. Hell, actually I can heal much faster — Wolverine-style — if I “overclock” my augmentation, but that will leave some nasty scars. Oh yeah, when I say “nasty scars” I mean four-dimensional scars that fuck with your brain when you look at them too long.

I also got an energy shield aug, works kinda like the ones in *Dune*. Stops fast-moving objects like bullets and the like, protects against explosions, etc. The heavy-hitting Intruders can punch it so hard it breaks, however, so I still gotta stay on my toes.

Also, my entire nervous system has been augmented. My reflexes don't just bypass conscious thought – they bypass physical limitations. The other day, I caught a fly between my thumb and forefinger without looking. Not because I'm that fast, but because the Interface predicted its flight path and my augmented neurons fired the necessary muscles about half a second before I even registered the fly was there. Sometimes I'll be in the middle of a fight, and my body will pull off these incredible acrobatic moves that I'm pretty sure violate several laws of physics. The Interface tells me it's just optimal kinetic chain exploitation, but I think that's just technobabble for "we bent reality just a little."

As you might have guessed, having an augmented nervous system means I’m a monster with firearms. Combined with my Interface’s targeting and probability calculating capabilities, I can get headshots all day. I once shot the head off a mosquito flying past me while I was hungover. Hell, I don’t even remember aiming my gun, my nervous system just did it for me as soon as the little bugger – pardon the pun – came into range.

Speaking of firearms, my standard issue sidearm is equally nuts. It’s a pistol they simply call the "Vindicator” that looks vaguely like the Auto-9 from *Robocop,* and it can change the actual properties of it’s rounds on the fly. It’s integrated with my Interface, so if I want explosive rounds? I *think* it and suddenly all of the rounds in the magazine become explosive. Frangible rounds that fuck-up organic material but just harmlessly desintegrate when hitting anything else? It can do that. Taser-like stun rounds? It’ll do that. This thing can change the properties of the cartridges on the fly with just a thought. It also has a Hyper-Velocity mode, where it utilizes micro-teleporters in the barrel to “borrow” kinetic energy from slightly ahead in time and place it behind the bullet right before impact. What this means rounds never lose speed because the gun keeps stealing muzzle velocity from a few fractions of a second in the future. The result? Bullet that hit like they're just been fired from a railgun, which comes in handy when you have to put down a “High-caloric Density Non-Euclid Homunculus” (aka what I call a “Fatty”).

My augs don't stop there, though. The stuff I just mentioned? Those are the *least impressive* ones. I got some stuff that my Benefactors call “Paradox-tier” augmentations… these are the ones I have to use sparingly… *because they freaking break reality*.

I have one that lets me manipulate gravity. I can run across walls and ceilings like goddamn Neo, I can make objects weightless so they just float around like they’re in space. One time I used this ability “swim around” the penthouse I was staying in, catching skittles in my mouth like a game of zero-g Hungry Hungry Hippos. My Benefactors chewed me the fuck out, because I was causing gravity fluctuations in the area. Apparently, a few cars and cat just lifted off the ground and floated to the sky like in Harry Potter. Woops. They told me this was my *one* warning to never use Paradox-tier augs outside of missions, and even then, only if no other tactical options were suitable. They never actually stated the consequences if I did it again, but they way they worded it “one warning” sent chills down my spine.

I got another one that actually slows fucking time itself. No, I don’t mean The Flash-style superspeed, I mean it actually slows down time in an area of my choosing… sorta like that Stasis Module from the *Dead Space* games, but instead of use affecting one enemy, it affects everything in a large radius… except myself. Very useful for those super-fast Intruders, “Sprinters”. But again, it’s a Paradox-tier aug, so using it too much fuckshe space-time continuum or something.

Finally, my last Paradox-tier aug is a short range teleporter. I was told it works differently from the big teleporters I use to travel around the planet... less stable, according to my Benefactors. But anyways it let's me hop from one place to another like that guy from X-Men. It’s my go-to solution for getting out of a tight spot, but it comes with a catch. Using it too much can cause “version bleeding" as my Benefactors call it – which in layman's terms means that the memories of alternate versions of myself start blending together with my own. Used it twice in quick succession I spent the next two hours having a heated argument with my reflection in the bathroom mirror because it didn’t like the tie I put on earlier...except I never wore a tie that day. The memory of this other alternate me made me forget which timeline I was actually on. My Administrator had to show up and sedate me with a tranquilizer dart and put me on bedrest for a week to let my brain sort out which memories were mine and which weren't.

Last but definitely not least is an aug I’ve mentioned a few times already — The Interface. It’s actually the first one they install, the one that acts as the basis for all the others. You probably already assumed it’s some kind of crazy-near-magical Heads Up Display… but it's not like the augmented reality displays you see in sci-fi movies. There's no floating screens or obvious overlays. The Interface is… integrated. Seamless. Like having a second consciousness running parallel to your own, feeding you information so naturally it feels like you're remembering things you never learned.

Imagine you're looking at a coffee cup. Your brain automatically knows it's a coffee cup because you've seen thousands of them. You don't think about recognizing it – you just know. That's how the Interface works, except it's doing that with everything, all the time, on levels you never knew existed. I look at a coffee cup, and I instantly know its temperature, chemical composition, potential use as a weapon, structural weak points, and whether it's been tampered with. Not as data points or readouts, but as pure, intuitive knowledge.

The really weird part? It works on dimensions and spaces that human brains aren't supposed to process. When I encounter one of those things – the ones that slip through from other realities – I can actually see all of it. Every impossible angle, every reality-breaking geometry. The Interface translates it into something my consciousness can handle without breaking. It's like… you know how your brain fills in your visual blind spot so you never notice it's there? The Interface does that with reality itself, letting me perceive things that should drive me insane.

Then there's the cognitive enhancements the Interface enables. My pattern recognition is off the charts. I can process information faster than any computer – not because I'm smarter, but because the Interface is running parallel processing on my thoughts. It's like having a thousand little Mes all thinking about different aspects of a problem simultaneously. When I speak to someone, I'm not just hearing their words – I'm analyzing their micro-expressions, vocal patterns, physiological responses, and about fifty other markers I didn't even know existed before. The Interface synthesizes all of this into what it calls "predictive behavioral modeling", but what it really means is that I can read people like they're children's books… despite the fact I was always awkward and not terribly great in social situations.

One item I gotta mention about my augs: despite the fact I have all these crazy superpowers that break reality, I look like a totally normal guy. There’s no cybernetic arms, no glowing eyes, no cool circuit-like patterns in my skin. Well, maybe not totally normal: my physique is godly — and I didn’t even work out to get it. After I got my augs I started noticing my belly fat disappearing and my arms getting larger, and eventually I looked like a fucking marble statue, 24/7. Whatever they stuck in me must also have a “godly physique protocol” somewhere.

Finally, the last thing I want to mention about my augs is… I have absolutely no goddamn clue how they work. I’m not even sure what they are *made of*. They were simply given to me via these needle-like injector devices and then take a few days to install and calibrate. If I had to guess it’s some kind of nanotechnology — or maybe a more advanced descendant of nanotechnology. But even if so, God knows how measly nanotechnology could let me control gravity and slow down time. I basically fight extradimensional monsters that defy reality and shouldn’t exist… using technology and gadgets that defy reality and shouldn’t exist. The irony hasn’t escaped me.

Now that I’ve talked about all my fancy toys, I suppose I should mention the lifestyle: It's every sad, lonely man's fantasy come true; the fantasy where, despite being a loser and a nobody, some plot-device characters show up at your doorstep and say “Hey kid, you might be a total loser who women laugh at, but also you possess a special… *something,* that is unique and rare. Come with us, we gotta save the world.” Queue a few training montages, overcoming your fears, first initial quest that don’t quite go right, and BAM — you’re now a baddass who saves the world… any maybe even get the hot love interest at the end.

On top of that I have a rather ridiculous salary and access to safe houses in every major city, each one more luxurious than the last. My Benefactors have this amazing concierge service can get me anything I want, anywhere, anytime. Last month I wanted to try this obscure Japanese whiskey that's impossible to find. Six hours later, it was waiting for me in Moscow. 1923 vintage, too. Tried it too. Very mellow. Smooth, with hints of oak. The service also gets me into basically any exclusive club on the planet… even if I wasn’t on the guest list. A simple call to them… which, by the way, I can do using my Interface — no phones needed — and the gates to the world of pleasures part like the Red Sea.

And yes, you’re probably thinking how is my luck with the ladies these days. You name the type, I’ve probably slept with them. I’ve been with the hottest women on the planet, a few big names that you’ve definitely heard of, but I won’t mention… out of courtesy to them, particularly since many were married and/or in a relationship when we hooked up. I’ve even had to turn down a few offers because my… schedule is so busy. Funny how these women suddenly find me irresistible once they realize I can take them to exclusive events and rub elbows with people they only dreamed about meeting. I can see right through them, of course. I mentioned before, my Interface helps me read people, helps me say exactly the right things at the right time. The old Marcus, the awkward IT guy who couldn't get a date to save his life? He's gone. This new version of me is smooth, confident, mysterious, dangerous.

My life sounds perfect, doesn’t it? I got money. I got girls. I got power. And my Benefactors don't seem to care what I do in my off time, so long as I drop everything and punch out Cthulhu whenever they say "jump". It's everything I dreamed of when I was nobody. Robert Howard, the guy who wrote the original *Conan the Barbarian* stories, once said that he wanted both *money* and *muscle* — because muscle lets you beat the shit out of people when necessary — money lets you get away with it. Okay, that wasn’t the *exact* quote but it’s the gist of it. Well, I definitely got money and muscle. I got an absurdly high salary and I can kick any man’s ass on the planet, hell I can fight off multiple men with one arm. Connor McGregor? Please, I’d cave his face in before his mind registered it. That dude who played The Mountain in *Game of Thrones*? (the actor who showed up in later seasons) Imagine his shock when he sees me effortless lift several times his limit, then punch him so hard his heart stops.

Hell, more than once I’ve saved a woman at a club or an event from groups of grabby men, and let me tell you: when a woman sees you beat the shit out of a group of men effortlessly, then sees you fold the bouncers like cheap suits when they try to put your hands on you... it ignites something primal in their brains. Feminism goes out the window. Those ladies basically worshiped me from then on... ever seen those Frank Frazetta illustrations of some barbarian hero posing while a scantly clad woman is wrapped around his leg? Yeah, that's what it's like.

So…

I’ve told you about my incredible life. I’m a baddass super-agent Sentinel working for a mysterious organization, I got awesome gadgets that make me superhuman. I get paid a fuck ton to do it, and I live life large.

So why am I sitting here, looking down from the 127th floor, wishing for it all to end? You must think I’ve lost my mind. I used to dream about being special. Now I am. I'm probably one of the most special people on Earth.

And now I’m lonelier than I’ve ever been in my life… and even worse —

I’m not sure I’m even in control of my body. I'm not sure if it's really "me" who's the baddass super agent... because as time goes on, I feel more and more like I'm actually just a vessel for... something else.

I’ll continue this in another post...
