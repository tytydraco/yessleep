In our desert town, every teacher says the same thing: never go into the fields. First grade, second grade, all the way up. No explanation. Just don’t.


It is the kind of thing you roll your eyes at. This place runs on rules nobody explains. Do not swim in the aqueduct. Do not mess with the Joshua trees. Do not go in the fields.


When I started middle school, Mom thought she could fix me by switching me to a charter. She figured the warnings were just a local scare tactic, like an urban legend for tumbleweeds.


But seventh grade hit, and the teachers there said the same thing. “If you see black tarps near the bushes, stay away. Never go into the field.”


By freshman year I told Mom the warnings had stopped. A lie, of course. She grew up in the city, about seventy miles away, where the only field was the outfield. She never understood this place.


My history teacher once told us the brain is not done cooking until you are twenty five. “That is why teenagers make impulsive choices,” he said. Then he added something weird.


“Our town has a lower death rate for young people than the rest of the High Desert. It is not by much, but it is there. Especially for the younger ones.”


Everyone laughed. I figured he was trying to spook us, keep the tradition alive. Like some cult thing baked into the town.


One afternoon, I had to pick up my little sister. Mom had gotten herself into trouble again. Shocker. I always filled in. Dinner, homework, bedtime. Basically Dad, but unpaid.


The sky was ugly that day. Black clouds rolling in, lightning scratching the horizon. The middle school sat across from the high school, so I cut over and signed her out.


My history teacher was in the office. He offered us a ride. I told him we lived close.


He called after us, “Do not go through the field. Black tarps today.”


I threw up a peace sign and kept walking.


Rain started. Down the street, a pack of skinheads leaned against the liquor store wall, staring us down. My sister noticed them too. I didn’t want her scared, so I lied.


“We will cut through the field. It is faster.”


She froze. You would think I just told her the devil lived there. I promised she could hold my hand. I even told her Mom was making her favorite stew. Another lie. Mom had not cooked in forever.


She nodded, but barely.


We stepped into the field. Thunder cracked like a gunshot. She jumped. I started singing her favorite dumb pop song, just to lighten it up. The rain came harder. Lightning lit the sky. She yanked her hand from mine and took off.


She was fast.


I yelled, ran after her, and slipped hard. Dirt in my mouth. I looked up and saw her stop and glance back.


Then she was gone.


Not ran home gone. Gone gone.


I lost it. My brain went blank. I sprinted like my lungs were on fire.


When our house came into view, I almost collapsed. The door was wide open. TV blasting the weather report.


I kicked off my shoes and stumbled inside. The place reeked of cigarettes and beans.


Mom walked out of the kitchen, smiling like she had won the lottery.


“Baby,” she said, “your sister is already in her room. You did not have to run.”


My stomach dropped.


“No,” I said. “She was with me. In the field. She.”


Mom just laughed. Like I was the crazy one. She tossed her rag onto the counter and stirred a pot that was not even cooking.


“She came home half an hour ago,” she said. “I signed her homework myself.”


I walked down the hall. My knees felt like water. Her bedroom door was shut. A night light glowed under it.


I knocked. Nothing.


I pushed it open.


The room was empty.


The bed was made.


The night light was not even plugged in.
