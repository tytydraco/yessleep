CW: Abusive Content

I never truly understood how heavy silence could feel until that moment, standing in the doorway. I felt like a piece of trash he’d finally decided to toss out.

“We need to go in,” the woman guiding me murmured. “You have to.”

Her tone wasn’t obedient. It was resigned and defeated. She didn’t sound like someone following orders out of fear, but like someone who believed she no longer had the right to choose anymore.

My chest tightened.

“Please,” I whispered. “I don’t want to…”

“What you want doesn’t matter.” She quickly snapped back. “Not anymore, anyway.”

Her words didn’t feel like a reprimand, but just a plain fact. She was only repeating what she knew. It seemed that was all she had left.

When we reached the cage, she paused briefly. Her eyes closed as she drew in a steady breath. Then, without warning, she snapped her head toward me, fixing her gaze on mine as she pushed me closer to the bars. Her voice was barely louder than the buzzing bulb overhead, but she made sure I could hear every word as she leaned closer.

“Don’t speak. If he hears you, he will hurt all of us,” she said plainly.

My skin crawled.

“Why?” I asked without thinking.

“Shh.” She hissed in return.

Her voice fell silent as she pulled a key from her apron and began unlocking the cage door.

She opened it slowly, the latch clicking with a metallic snap that echoed off the walls. The woman inside pushed herself up from the floor to look at me. Her gaze released the dread I’d been holding back at the edges of my mind, allowing it to surge forward and swallow me whole.

Up close, I could now look into her eyes. They were empty, but not lifeless, as if everything that made her a person had been stripped away, leaving the frail naked thing in front of me in its place.

She blinked slowly, a faint twitch rippling across her cheek.

“You need to kneel,” the woman behind me said.

“What? Why?” I asked, confused.

“Kneel,” she repeated, a sharp panic edging into her voice.

She jerked the cuffs hard enough to send me stumbling forward. I fell, catching myself with my hands on the concrete. Pain shot through my palms, but it barely registered. The caged woman had started moving as I hit the ground, crawling toward me with an unnatural sort of grace. Her motions were careful and deliberate, the precision clearly practiced, like she had learned exactly how to move to avoid punishment.

“Don’t touch her,” the woman behind me whispered, her voice shaky. “Not yet. She reacts violently to touch.”

I dropped my gaze to the floor to avoid eye contact. I didn’t even want to look at her.

My heart hammered against my ribs so hard that I worried she would hear it.

She crawled closer. I could hear the scrape of her rough, calloused knees dragging across the concrete as she inched to within a foot of me. I braced myself, though I didn’t know why, or for what. She was a prisoner, like me.

Just when it felt like the tension in the room had reached its breaking point, a small, fragile voice crept into my ears.

“…Emily…”

My blood froze.

The woman’s voice was soft and jagged at the same time, like a rasp from a throat that had forgotten how to form words.

But it was my name. How could she possibly know who I was?

Hearing it from her felt like someone had slipped a thin blade between my ribs and twisted it, hollowing out my chest with an instant mix of guilt and sorrow.

The woman behind me, the one guiding me, flinched violently, as though the sound of the caged woman’s voice physically hurt her.

“Don’t respond,” she hissed. “Do not let him hear your voice.”

My lungs tightened. “But… How does she know my…”

“Quiet.” She cut in.

She pulled the chain again, forcing me closer to the other woman. My knees pressed against the cold concrete as she lifted her trembling hand and began threading her fingers through my greasy, unkempt hair.

She smelled like sweat and something damp, something faintly sour. I don’t know how, but I could smell the fear and torment emanating from her.

Her fingers slid across my scalp like she was studying me, sending jolts through my body. It wasn’t pain or fear, but something that made me feel worse. It felt like recognition, as if this were always meant to happen.

Her mouth opened slightly, the corners twitching as if something inside her was trying to get out. That same rasping voice came leaking out, this time no longer soft or timid.

“Don’t let him name you.” She said flatly.

I didn’t even have time to process her words before the woman behind me snapped back at her.

“Dammit, not yet. You can’t tell her yet. If he knows you told her, he’s going to hurt you again. You know that.”

There was a tremor in her voice, not because of the woman in the cage, but because of what she was saying. I was never meant to know the truth.

The woman blinked again. Her eyes shifted past me, locking onto the one gripping my cuffs. She gave a slight tilt of her head, subtle but questioning.

“It’s not time. Not here. If he hears us, then he’ll…”

She cut herself off abruptly, her voice strangled by something she couldn’t bring herself to say. She leaned away from us, shifting uncomfortably behind me. The tension in the air thickened, stretching a heavy silence between us.

I swallowed hard.

“Please,” I whispered. “Tell me what…”

Before I could finish, a hand shot out from behind me, clamping over my mouth. The woman’s cold, shaking fingers pressed against my lips with enough pressure to bruise.

“Don’t talk,” she said sharply. “If he comes in and hears your voice, you won’t leave this room the same. Understand?”

Tears stung my eyes as I nodded, terrified to even move.

“Good.”

She let up on her grip slightly, testing whether I truly understood.

“What does that mean?” I tried to ask, but it came out muffled against her palm.

She removed her hand and exhaled a deep, exasperated breath as she pulled away from me.

“It means there are versions of us,” she said quietly. “Stages. He breaks us down until we stop fighting and stop thinking. Until you can’t recognize the difference between obedience and survival anymore.”

Her voice caught in her throat for a moment.

“At the final stage, he names you. That’s when he truly owns you. That’s when you know you will never leave this place. Your old self dies, leaving behind what you see in front of you there… a shriveled husk.”

Every part of me went cold. The caged woman’s fingertips slid off my scalp, retreating to the floor in front of her.

The woman behind me leaned closer, loosening her grip on the handcuffs. She crouched down next to my ear, her voice morphing into a fragile whisper.

“He only uses your real name at first… when you’re fresh. That’s the beginning of his process. Once you let him call you by it willingly, well, then everything else becomes easier for him to take.”

The caged woman nodded weakly, her breath rattling in her chest.

“He will take everything from you.” She added.

I was so lost and confused. My mind couldn’t comprehend what they were telling me, but I was determined to find out what it all meant.

“What does he do when you reach the final stage?” I whispered, turning back to look at the woman behind me.

She hesitated, tightening her jaw until her teeth scraped together. Pain flickered across her expression like she was re-living a horrific memory.

“When he names you,” she said slowly, “you stop being who you were. He cuts away everything that resists him. Every thought that questions him. Every instinct that rebels. He remolds you into what he wants.”

My stomach churned.

“You mean he’s brainwashing women?” I breathed.

Her eyes snapped to mine.

“No. Brainwashing changes your mind. This… changes your identity… your soul. He digs into you like he’s carving a gourd, scraping out what made you whole until there is nothing left.”

I swallowed hard, trying to contain the fear building within me.

“What stage are you?” I asked.

She looked away, clearly trying to hold back a waterfall of tears.

“I’m at the stage where I don’t try anymore.” She answered, “There’s no point in it.”

Her words hit me like a punch to the gut, but they also made sense in my mind. She was the only other person I had ever seen who wasn’t chained up or in a cage.

“Is that why you can walk around freely?” I whispered. “Because he trusts you?”

She drew in a shuddering breath as tears fell from her eyes.

“No.” She responded. “He broke me. I’d rather die in here than feel his hands on my skin again.”

She looked down at the floor, letting the tears drip across the concrete.

“Maybe one day, I’ll find the courage to do it.”

Absolute silence settled over the room, devoid of any comfort. Aside from the three of us, only the cold, hard walls heard her cries.

After a long pause, she lifted her head, wiping the tears from her face as she spoke again.

“He calls me Mara.”

Her voice trembled on the name, tinged with both shame and resignation.

“That’s not my real name,” she added quickly, almost defensively. “But it’s what he named me. So, it’s who I am now.”

I stared at her, my heart pounding so violently I thought my ribs might crack.

“What’s your real name?” I asked gently, trying not to disturb her any more than I had to.

Mara’s eyes darted toward the door as if she expected him to appear there at any second.

“It doesn’t matter,” she whispered. “He took it. It’s his now.”

The woman in the cage rasped something under her breath. Mara turned her head slightly, listening intently to what she was trying to say. The woman repeated the soft, broken words over and over.

“She needs to know, Mara.”

Mara swallowed hard. “If I tell her, he’ll find out and punish us both.”

“How?” I asked.

She didn’t answer, but the caged woman spoke up, this time slower, making sure I could hear her clearly.

“You… didn’t choose to learn. He will… hurt you until… until you do.”

It seemed like every word took more and more strength out of her. Mara’s face twisted with guilt as she listened to the woman speak.

She looked back at me and whispered, “Her name is Lilith.”

A cold shiver ran through me as the pieces finally clicked into place. The cruel reality settled over my mind like a suffocating weight. I would most likely become just like them. Reduced to nothing but a hollow existence of involuntary servitude for a monster.

“She was like you once,” Mara said softly. “New. Terrified. Fighting every second.” Her voice wavered. “She lasted the longest of any of us before she stopped trying.”

A single tear slid down Lilith’s cheek.

“She stopped fighting when he named her.”

Lilith let out a weak, broken sob, exhaling like she had torn something loose inside her.

“Don’t answer him, Emily,” she breathed, body convulsing in fear and pain.

Her arms contorted, and her back twisted as a violent tremor seized her body. A strangled cry rippled from her throat, echoing sharply off the concrete and steel.

Mara grabbed me, yanking me backward so fast the cuffs bit into my wrists, feeling like they would break.

“He’s coming,” she hissed in my ear.

“What? How do you…?” I stammered, barely processing her words.

“Be quiet.” She snapped.

Her fingers tightened painfully around my arms as she held me back. The basement doorknob groaned, the sound of scraping metal slicing the silence.

Mara went rigid, her head snapping to the door, eyes wide and hollow with terror. The door creaked as the lock clicked open, sending a shockwave of sound through the room. Panic twisted in her features as she shoved me back, away from Lilith’s writhing body. I stumbled, landing on my knees as she forced me down, pressing me into the cold floor.

“Emily,” she whispered urgently, pushing her forehead against mine. “Listen to me. This is important.” Her voice shook with a mix of fear and desperation. “When he comes in, he will say your name.”

Her nails dug into my skin as her breathing got faster.

“You must not respond, understand?”

“Why? What happens if I…?”

“He will think you’re ready,” she cut me off, her voice lower than a whisper.

The latch clicked softly, and the door began to open.

 Mara’s breath caught in her throat as she pressed her forehead to mine harder, panic blazing in her eyes.

“You are not ready,” she whispered desperately. “Please. Don’t let him start on you. Don’t let him take your name. Fight it as long as you can. Fight longer than I did. Longer than Lilith did.”

The door swung fully open. Mara shoved my head down, forcing me to bow, her entire body collapsing into terrified obedience, as though she were a puppet whose strings had been cut.

Then, he stepped inside.

His silhouette filled the doorway’s glow, positioned perfectly so that he would only be seen how he wanted. Everything was done on his terms. He closed the door with a soft, careful click, then smiled, his expression warm, almost paternal, but entirely out of place.

“Emily,” he said, voice low, almost affectionate. “There you are.”

Mara bowed her head at once. Behind me, Lilith had gone completely still, the only sound in the room being the faint breathing from the four of us.

The man took a slow step toward me.

“Emily,” he said again. “Look at me.”

My heart pounded violently in my chest as I felt my body going almost completely numb with fear. Mara trembled beside me, and behind me, I could hear Lilith whimpering softly. I remained silent, not moving, barely breathing, staring at the ground. I didn’t dare look up at him.

He crouched down in front of me, tilting his head, a strange tenderness overtaking him that made my stomach churn.

“Emily,” he repeated once more, slower this time, testing me. “Why won’t you answer me?”

I kept my mouth shut. After Mara’s warning, there was no way in hell he was going to get me to speak.

The man’s smile widened, but I swore I could feel something shift beneath it. It wasn’t anger or frustration. It was something more unsettling than that. It felt more like excitement or curiosity. He leaned in closer, lowering his voice to a murmur.

“Oh, good,” he whispered. “You’re not ready yet.”

There was no trace of kindness in his voice, no hint of malice, just a cold certainty of a promise he meant to keep.

He straightened, brushing invisible dust from his hands, gesturing for Mara to rise. She obeyed without a word, her face falling back into that empty, vacant expression.

Turning toward Lilith’s cage, he spoke with casual indifference.

“We’ll continue her lesson tomorrow.”

She flinched violently at the sound of his voice, curling herself up tightly into a ball. She didn’t acknowledge her movement, as his attention was already on me again, his fingers stretching out toward my face. A primal fear clawed at my chest, and my body screamed to pull away, but Mara’s grip tightened, a silent warning forcing me to stay still.

He pushed two fingers beneath my chin, tilting my face upward until our eyes locked.

“I don’t think I’ll name you just yet,” he murmured, his voice soft but laced with malice. “You still think you’re someone.”

His smile thinned, curling upward.

“And I do so love the breaking-in stage.”

With a final chuckle, he released my chin and turned toward the door.

He motioned for Mara to follow him, and she obeyed instantly.

“Come along,” he said. “We have more work to do.”

Mara stepped toward the door, her face empty, devoid of emotion.

Just before they stepped out, he paused, turning to look back at me, as if savoring the moment.

“Goodnight, Emily,” he said, his words sarcastically gentle.

The door closed hard behind them, leaving the room steeped in a suffocating silence. From the darkness of Lilith’s cage, her voice whispered, weak and strained.

“Run, Emily… before he learns how to break you.”
