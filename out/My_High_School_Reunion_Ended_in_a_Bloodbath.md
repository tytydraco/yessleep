I rolled my eyes when I got the invitation to my reunion. It’s been five years since I visited my hometown, and ten since I stepped foot in that school. And besides occasionally liking their social media posts, there was not one person from that school I kept in touch with. So, what was the point? I thought about deleting the email on the spot, but the RSVP link tickled my curiosity. When I looked, I saw Alyssa’s name.

My flight was booked two hours later, and the date was marked on my calendar.

I parked in my old spot, which felt oddly satisfying. And when I looked at the school; a decaying two-story square building with almost no windows, I felt something. I guess it was nostalgia. For a second, I forgot about my job. I forgot about my loans, which I kept assuring myself I was chipping away at, but every time I checked its balance, I still saw tens of thousands staring me back in the face. All I could think about was my time back at school, and how easy it was.

I could hear the bell ring. I could see Erik and Brendan with me at the round lunch tables reserved for seniors. I could hear the fight song we always chanted at the football games every Friday night.

*Fight on, Falcons, Fight Fight Fight!*  
*Spread your wings and show your might!*  
*Watch us falcons go take flight!*  
*Fight on, Falcons, Fight Fight Fight!*

And I could see Alyssa again. I could hear Alyssa again. God, I needed to get some closure.

I got out of my car and walked to the gym entrance. The full moon was bigger than usual. It looked like the eye of a God very interested in what was to transpire tonight. A chilly wind cut into my bones as I walked. Above the doors was a banner that read *WELCOME BACK FALCONS!*, and little red and blue balloons blew in the breeze. The doors were propped open, and members of my class’s student council acted as greeters.

“Welcome,” one woman, who I recognized as our secretary, Tamara, said to me. “Come to the table and make your nametag!”

And I did. Others lined up behind me. They conversed all too casually; talking of their jobs, their spouses or kids, and of the good times they had here back in the day. I glanced behind me, and at the line next to mine. No Alyssa.

I made my nametag and placed it on my chest. From there, I walked to the gym. Another large banner that read *WELCOME BACK FALCONS!* was spread across the ceiling, and the school logo, a red-and-blue falcon, watched from above like a predator. Clusters of balloons were placed around and weighed down, making them look like trees. Mid-2010s music played from the speakers at a pleasant volume that unfortunately reminded me of the fact that I have aged ten years. Circular tables were scattered about, where people sat, chatted, and laughed. Each table had a red and blue centerpiece decorated with the same falcon as the one on the banner. To the left side were a series of long rectangular tables with food and drinks laid about, buffet style. On the end was a makeshift bar. Every chair at the bar was occupied, of course. And a stage was set up at the far end of the gym, where a podium rested on the right side. Great. There would be speeches.

I looked around the gym with falcon’s eyes. Still no Alyssa. My stomach fell. Maybe she saw that I RSVP’d and decided to decline.

No. No way. She may have just not shown yet. Or maybe stuff came up. She did get engaged to some pro soccer player recently, so maybe that got in the way.

My heart sank when I reminded myself of that.

Like many others, I drifted to the bar. Because goddam, I needed it. After a couple drinks, I heard a familiar voice rake my ears.

“Ryan? Ryan! What is up, man!”

I turned and saw Erik and Brendan approach. They were good guys, but sometimes prone to making decisions that got them into some hot water with the local police department. Senior year, we set off a firework at the local park right after school. The cops arrived before we left. Thankfully, they didn’t find the weed in Erik’s car, so we were let off with a warning.

“Hey,” I said. I dapped the two up. They looked a little bigger than they did ten years ago, but honestly, who didn’t?

“How’ve you been,” Erik asked. “I see you’re teaching now?”

“Yup.”

“And how’s that been?”

I shrugged. There was no chance in hell I was having that conversation. I looked behind them and scanned every face I could see. Nothing.

“I get it,” Erik said. “I’ve read all about kids these days. But honestly, is it that much different than us back then?”

“Hell yes,” Brendan said, who, of course, had a drink in his hand. “We did not have half the shit they have now.”

“What do you do,” I asked Erik, eager to not talk about my life.

“Engineering,” Erik said. “Brendan too. We work at the same place, actually. Going good too. Pay is exquisite!”

He talked more, as Erik was prone to do, but I stopped listening. I saw her.

Alyssa was across the gym. She had a drink in her hand and laughed with a group of girls I remembered to be volleyball players. She was a trainer and physical therapist, and damn, she looked the part. She might have been the only person in the building who looked to be in better shape than she did ten years ago.

“There’s no way, bro,” Erik said. He broke me from my trance. His smile looked just as idiotic as it did ten years ago. “Don’t tell me you’re still looking at Alyssa.”

“I’m not,” I said. “I know she’s engaged. I just… I want to apologize.”

Erik scoffed. “For junior prom? She friendzoned you. What do you need to apologize for?”

That pissed me off. “You know what it did to us. I can’t just… I need to get closure, alright?”

Erik and Brendan raised their hands and laughed. They have not changed a bit since high school. It was best I get away from them, just like I did ten years ago.

They sat by the bar and watched as I stood.

I approached Alyssa just as she broke off from the other girls. And when we stood face-to-face, I found myself flustered. Like I was meeting a celebrity. She wasn’t, of course. But for the past ten years, she’s been nothing but a series of social media posts and the ghost of a memory that, with time, elevated to deity status. And of course, that engagement ring twinkled like a goddam star on her left ring finger. She tapped it on her glass and looked at me with no smile. The sharp *DING* it made stabbed my ears and gave me a headache.

“Hey,” she said.

“Hey,” I said. “So good to see you. Congrats on your engagement!”

A smile finally broke through, and her eyes lit up. “Thanks! It’s been great!”

“Is he here? With you?” I looked around the gym, my heart fluttering. I did not think about that.

Thankfully, Alyssa shook her head. She shut her eyes and sighed. “He’s away at a tournament right now.”

“Gotcha,” I said. And after a long sigh to calm the coming nerves, I cut to the chase. “Listen, Alyssa-”

“Please,” Alyssa said. She rolled her eyes. “I don’t want to hear it.”

“But-”

“-No. You knew I wanted nothing more. We talked about that all year. And you still tried.”

I had nothing to say. My head dipped in shame.

Alyssa clicked her tongue. “You didn’t see me as a friend. You never did. Just a potential fucktoy.”

“That’s not true.”

Alyssa shrugged. “Whatever.” She held up her left hand and wiggled her fingers. That ring had a little line in it that looked like a mocking smile. “Don’t bother me again tonight, asshole.”

And she was gone. She went to a table with one seat left. Of course, she was greeted like an old friend by the others who sat there. Every other table around her was filled as well.

By the bar, I saw Erik and Brendan whispering and laughing to one another. When they saw me, they held their thumbs up and nodded.

The next half hour was spent alone at a table in the back corner. No one sat with me, which was fine. Should I have left then? Probably. But goddam, I still wanted to make things right.

I understood her plight. And she wasn’t wrong. I did use that friendship as a bridge I never got to cross. And when I thought I had an opportunity, I pounced. And that conversation by the fountain at junior prom, which ended with me crying and begging for her to give me a chance, was the last time we spoke.

And maybe I did still have feelings. If I didn’t, then seeing her engagement posts wouldn’t have kept me up all night and made me wonder just what the fuck I was doing. Alone, across the country, working for shit kids in a shit world. God, I needed therapy. If only I could afford it.

“Mind if I sit here,” a voice asked. “Everywhere else is full.”

I looked up and saw Donovan. The former quarterback looked young. Almost twenty-one. His prideful smile was the same as it was ten years ago. He ruled the halls then. He dated Dayna, the cheer captain, and got some big offer to play division 1 football. Judging by his youthful, almost flawless appearance, it must have worked out just fine.

“Sure,” I muttered, gesturing to all the empty seats. He smiled and sat down.

“Thanks,” he said. “Ryan, right?”

I nodded. We shook hands. His hand was the coldest thing I’ve ever felt.

“Nice to see you again,” Donovan said. “Things going well for you?”

“Not particularly,” I said. “I guess football’s been good for you? You play in the league or what?”

Donovan’s smile fell and he slumped back in his seat. My own casual smile faltered, and I wondered if I brought up a sensitive subject he wasn’t ready to talk about. I went to apologize, but he waved me off.

“Not particularly. Got injured sophomore year. Lost my scholarship. Couldn’t afford school. Became a bartender in the city. Tale as old as time, I guess.”

His voice and eyes wavered with anger, not sadness. It was the look of a man angry with the world. I could empathize with that.

“It’s whatever,” Donovan said. He drummed his fingers on the table. “I’m just happy I’m here. Brings me back to a better time, you know?”

I could empathize with that, to an extent. I nodded in agreement, nonetheless.

“Hello, everyone!”

The music halted. Every conversation cut off at once, and silence echoed through the gym. On the stage, the class president stood behind the podium. Her name was Kayla, and the only thing I remembered about her was at after-prom, she twisted her ankle on the beach and limped back to the motel, drunk as hell, with a tennis ball for a foot.

“Welcome everyone, to the class of 2015 ten year reunion!”

Everyone clapped. I offered a slow polite one before dropping my elbows to the table.

“It is so lovely to see everyone again, and I want to thank the reunion planning committee on making this night a reality! That would be…” She pulled up her phone, cleared her throat into the mic, and read out a list of names I didn’t care to listen to. I looked toward Alyssa’s table. She faced the podium, her back turned to me. My chest deflated, and I slouched back in my chair. Donovan looked at me, then Alyssa, and then me again, before turning his attention back to the podium.

Kayla finished reading her list, begged for applause, got just a little bit, and continued to the next topic.

“Before the party gets started, I wanted to call up some special speakers. They won class couple, both won most athletic, and were our prom and homecoming king and queen! That would be none other than Donovan and Dayna!”

Donovan looked at me and winked before standing up. He walked to the stage, and Dayna stood from her table and followed. She did not look like a cheer captain anymore, but Donovan hugged her with a longing look in his eyes, nonetheless. The two stood behind the podium, and Donovan slammed both hands on the polished wood. The boom it made cracked through the gym.

“Nice to see everyone again. Feels so long since I’ve been here. I don’t want to take up too much time, but I just want to say how much I enjoyed my time here. If you did too, then great! And if not, and I was a reason, I apologize. I wish to make it right.

“I hope tonight, we can go back to those good days. Those simpler days. Let’s make this a night we’ll never forget.”

Some cheered, and others rolled their eyes. They all applauded, nonetheless. Dayna got on the mic, but I didn’t listen to what she had to say. My focus was on Alyssa, who never changed positions.

God, maybe there was something wrong with me. Maybe I should leave. Get out of here and never come back. Unfollow Alyssa and move on. Try to, at least. Maybe I could-

\-The crowd applauded, and Donovan and Dayna waved their hands to the gym. They then stepped off the stage, and the music returned. Way louder than before. Chatter operated as additional background noise. Donovan walked with Dayna to the back of the gym. When he saw me, he bowed his head.

“Going to the bathroom,” he said. “Catch you in a bit.”

I did not wait a bit.

The next couple hours were either spent at the bar or at the back of the gym. The music blasted and people danced and talked. I either drank, walked around aimlessly, or looked for Alyssa. She smiled, danced, and laughed with what seemed to be a new crowd every time I saw her. That was typical of her. Even in high school, she got along with everyone. Even the biggest pieces of shit.

Wow. Something was wrong with me.

I needed to use the restroom at one point, so I went out of the gym and down the darkened hall. A man left the men’s room and a woman left the women’s room at the same time. They took identical strides as they walked past me. And as they did, they both looked at me with eyes I could only describe as hungry? But I forgot about it once they were out of my sight.

When I opened the bathroom door, the worst smell I’ve ever smelled clawed its way into my nose. I gagged and backed out of the bathroom. My back hit the lockers, and I swallowed the vomit that attempted to rush up my throat. Suddenly, I didn’t feel the need to go anymore.

It wasn’t the smell of a bad accident. I worked in a middle school for a while, so I’ve smelled plenty of those. It was something far worse. The only thing I could compare it to was that of a dead animal. But it was much stronger than that. If death itself could have a smell, that was it.

I went back to the gym and back to the bar. The bartender, who now knew my name and drink, poured me a glass before I sat down. After thanking him and having a sip, I looked for Alyssa again.

When I turned around, I saw Erik standing in front of me. His mouth was slightly open, and his eyes were wide. He panted as if he just went for a little jog around the school.

“Hey,” he said. He stared at me silently for a moment. “How are you enjoying the night?”

I finished my glass and slammed it on the bar. “You know the answer already. Don’t be an ass.”

Erik laughed. It didn’t sound like his laugh, though. More like the written words *ha ha ha ha* spoken aloud.

“You’ll like it soon enough,” he said. “Trust me.”

He paused again. I guess he was waiting for me to reply. But the absurdity of the situation kept my lips sealed.

“I’ll see you later,” Erik said. He disappeared into the crowd, and I was left shaking at the bar. When I faced the bar, I saw my glass was already refilled. I thanked the bartender and drank some more.

And then I felt a tap on my shoulder. I turned and froze.

It was Alyssa.

“Hey,” she said. Her voice was softer. Friendlier. “How’ve you been?”

She got close to me. Very close. I tensed up as she placed her left hand on the bar. Her ring was off.

“Good,” I said. I had no idea what to say.

Alyssa smiled and giggled. Her eyes were glazed over, and her smile was dopey. She had to be wasted. But when she spoke, I smelled no alcohol on her breath.

“I wanna talk to you,” she said, bringing her lips to my ear. “*Privately.*”

Was I hallucinating? Did I drink that much? I bit my lip and looked around the gym. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. People talked, laughed, and danced. The music was just as loud as it always was, and that falcon still watched from the ceiling.

“Sure,” I said.

Alyssa nodded and took my hand. As she guided me into the hallway, I forced myself to remember why I came here. To apologize. To have closure. Don’t go any further than that.

But damn, I wanted to.

Alyssa guided me down the darkened hall with her very cold hand. No one was around, and the music dimmed to nothing more than a muffled series of bass and thumps. When we were hidden from light, she grabbed my shirt and kissed me.

Her lips were so cold that it burned my face. But I didn’t care. I felt sixteen again. Carefree. Excited. I kissed her back and wrapped my arms around her waist.

She pulled her lips from mine and smiled at me with a crazed look in her eye. She panted just like Erik did earlier.

“My fiancé is a cheating fuck,” she said through labored breaths. “It’s you. It’s you I’ve always wanted.”

She kissed me again and backed me into the lockers. The back of my head and my tailbone cried out in pain, but I was much too preoccupied to worry about that. I was enjoying the night now. Did Erik have something to do with this? Did he put in a good word? If he did, it was the best word possible. When I saw him next, I would have to thank him.

“I was scared to date you,” Alyssa said. She pressed her cold body against mine. “I can’t run anymore, Ryan. I want you. Only you.”

Tears were welling up in my eyes. This was everything I wanted. Not closure. Not a final goodbye. This.

Alyssa kissed me on the cheek and held a finger up to the sky. If she were a cartoon character, a lightbulb would have lit up above her head.

“I have an idea,” she said. She backed up a couple steps and beckoned me toward her. “Come with me.”

Of course I did. I followed her like a lost puppy down the hall. I did stop, however, when I noticed that she was leading me to the women’s bathroom.

She half opened the door and peeked inside. Then she looked to me and waved me over. She still panted, and she still smiled dumbly.

“Come on,” Alyssa said, a little more aggressively than I was expecting. I looked up and down the hall. There were some folks in the hall, but they looked quite entrenched in their own conversations.

I shrugged, thinking about junior prom, and walked inside the women’s bathroom.

I knew I made a mistake as soon as I noticed the smell. Identical to the one from the men’s room. I covered my nose, put a hand on the wall, and doubled over. My stomach, already queasy from the alcohol, roared in protest.

“It’s okay,” Alyssa whispered.

And then I heard a scream.

I looked up and saw Dayna kneeling over another woman. She was digging her teeth into her neck and drinking the blood that poured from the grotesque wound. Some dripped onto the floor, where I noticed more red puddles. It looked like the bathroom was flooded with blood. Red was splattered all over the wall, and bits of pink and brown flesh were scattered about the floor like crumbs.

“It’s not so bad,” Alyssa said. “It won’t take long.”

She grabbed me by the shoulders and pinned me against the wall. I screamed, but my voice was drowned out by the chorus of cries and whimpers I now heard coming from the hall. Not even the music could be heard.

“I can’t lie,” Alyssa said. “It will hurt a lot. But you’ll feel so, so good once you wake up.”

Her eyes glowed green, and her canines elongated into snake-like fangs.

I got my hands on Alyssa’s chest and pushed her as hard as I could. Her grip loosened, and she slammed into the opposite wall. The back of her head *THUNKED* hard, but it didn’t seem to faze her. She stood up straight as if she bounced off a wall made of foam.

She smiled and panted again. The screams outside grew louder. It was louder than the music ever was.

“Don’t fight,” Alyssa said. “This is what you always wanted, right?” She lunged at me.

I ran out of the bathroom and froze again. I covered my mouth to keep from vomiting and backed into the lockers. The screams were so loud now. My ears cried out in pain from the volume. All around me, people tackled and ate other people. They tore at their necks, arms, legs, chests, faces. Whatever they got their hands on first. They drank the blood that spurted from the wounds with no regard for the mess it made on their faces and clothes. Red puddles were all over the floor of the halls, and that death smell corrupted the air.

Alyssa burst out of the bathroom and smiled once she noticed me. Dayna ran out of the bathroom, down the hall, and tackled Kayla, who was bolting for the exit door to my left. And the woman whose neck Dayna tore up was the next out of the bathroom. Her eyes also glowed, and she also had fangs. And the wound on her neck was gone. She ran down the hall and brought down Brendan, who ran out of the gym with bloodstains on his pants.

“You finally got what you wanted,” Alyssa said, “and now you run?” She pouted her lip. “I thought this was everything you dreamed of.”

I ran down the hall, dodging monsters who used to be people. They seemed preoccupied with their own meals, so they let me pass. Alyssa was not far behind. I heard her panting as she chased me. The exit door was not far away. I rushed toward it, running as fast as my out-of-shape ass could. Alyssa’s cold breath was on my neck, and her snarls and hisses tickled my ear.

And someone jumped in front of me. I slammed into their chest, and their cold, strong hands dug into my sides.

It was Donovan. His mouth and shirt were stained with fresh blood.

“Woah, woah,” Donovan said. “Where the hell do you think you’re going?”

I cried into his chest then. Any moment now, I would feel Alyssa’s fangs rip into me. But it didn’t come. I looked behind me and saw her holding her hands up to Donovan.

“If you want him,” she said, “you can have him.”

“You got this one,” Donovan said. “After I have a quick word with him. Be patient, Alyssa.”

She nodded and rubbed her hands together. “Thank you, master.”

Donovan grabbed my chin and tilted my head up. My eyes were locked with his, which also glowed green.

“You’re running,” Donovan asked. “Where exactly are you running to?”

I was silent. He was kind of right.

“You’re running to a place that will have no problem leaving you behind,” he continued. “I’m offering you all a way out. Back to those simple years.”

Of course it was tempting. I looked back at Alyssa, whose eyes no longer glowed. Whose fangs no longer showed. She looked like she always did. The screaming stopped too. Instead, people sang through the halls.

*Fight on, Falcons, Fight Fight Fight!*  
*Spread your wings and show your might!*  
*Watch us falcons go take flight!*  
*Fight on, Falcons, Fight Fight Fight!*

“It’ll be just like high school again,” Donovan told me. “But this time, it will be forever. And it will be like you always wanted it to be.”

He pointed to Alyssa, who quietly sang with the crowd. She swayed like a tree in the wind as she approached me. Her eyes glowed again, and the fangs reappeared.

I wanted to say yes. But something told me no. Maybe a gut instinct, or something more divine. Whatever it was, it gave me the strength to push Donovan away and bolt out the exit door. The cold wind nipped at me, but it never felt better compared to the smell of death that decayed the school’s air.

“NO,” I heard Alyssa scream. “NO! Come back Ryan! Come back! Please!”

And I wanted to. But I found the strength to jump in my car and get the hell out of there. As I pulled out of the lot, I heard the fight song grow louder. Dancing shadows with glowing eyes poured from the doors, skipping and singing. They looked to the moon and raised their arms to it as their song warped to a frenzied chant.

*Fight on, Falcons, Fight Fight Fight!*  
*Spread your wings and show your might!*  
*Watch us falcons go take flight!*  
*Fight on, Falcons, Fight Fight Fight!*

I cried the whole way back to my hotel.

That was a couple months ago, and not a day goes by where I don’t think about that night. There are weeks where I don’t sleep. There are days where I don’t eat. I’ve called out of work many times because I was too shaken to get out of bed. It didn’t take long for me to lose my job as a result.

The only money spent are on bills and booze now. And my bank account bleeds out more and more with each week. My parents offered me to move back in with them, but I refused. I can’t go back to that town. Never again.

But that didn’t matter.

Last week, in the middle of yet another sleepless night, I heard Alyssa’s voice outside my bedroom window.

*Fight on, Falcons, Fight Fight Fight!*  
*Spread your wings and show your might!*  
*Watch us falcons go take flight!*  
*Fight on, Falcons, Fight Fight Fight!*

I don’t know if it was real, or if I was hallucinating. The voice was beautiful, nonetheless. And I considered going out there. Because let’s be honest. What’s the better alternative? Continue on the path I’m headed down, or be with her forever? With the girl I’ve always wanted. With the girl who I never forgot about. The girl who I thought got away. She was outside my window now, begging me to come outside and join her. It would be so easy.

I hope to God that she doesn’t come back. Because if she does, I don’t know if I’ll be able to resist again.
