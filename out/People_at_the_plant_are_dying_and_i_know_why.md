Ive been working security at this construction site for almost a year. Another month and It’ll be a review , and God willing a raise. I’m really tired of eating lukewarm noodles for lunch. Other than meager pay in an abysmal economy, the situations been great, until things got weird. I suppose now that’s the least of my problems 

I first got on around the middle of the month. The job entails sitting around in a metal box to watch over a half built construction site. It’s supposed to be the biggest project in North America so I keep an eye out for drunk teenagers and addicts looking for copper. Miles of prefabricated steel, Rebar and concrete. Giant slabs of Half made buildings cut through the night air. LED lampposts pepper the place throughout, Illuminating everything in that pale, artificial glow that lines the highways across the country. You know there must dozens of people making rounds or burning the night oil. Still being out there in the darkness makes you feel vulnerable.

On the record, what I do is stand at the ready , clip board in hand, and call the cops if whoever i ask to leave, doesn’t. In practice I stare off into the dark, doom scrolling Reddit and TikTok. One eye on my phone and the other looking for my boss. If you get caught sleeping you’re fired of course but anything you do to stay awake is gravy.

The first time it happened was my phone died. I was watching some goth chick dance in a video that if caught I don't think would get me canned, but definitely would have raised an eyebrow. I didn’t notice when halfway through a swipe i wound up looking at a black mirror.   Muttering I tossed the phone on the folding chair i use as a table. Great. I even forgot my charger. Hours I now spent just staring at the dark, waiting to be relieved. Only thing I could do is ignore the nagging thoughts in my head that I failed at life. Trade school would have been better than dropping out of college knee deep in debt. It was then looking at the horizon of supposedly empty towers, something moved.

I squinted at the horizon. Something massive crept between the giant metal beams. The braces to future walls were stories high. Whatever it was breaking the light between them, it must have been massive. 

“Is that a crane?” I leaned closer as if that would somehow help. It didn't move again but i swear the lighting was different. Some giant black shadow towered among the shambles of buildings yet to be. I thought I was going mad when the thought crept in that it somehow looked, human.

The window of my cell flickered with the approach of yellow headlights. My replacement moseyed over in a white pickup truck to start the shift. A man in safety yellow hopped out covered in fake badges and the word Security blazoned over everything. I think a clown costume would have been less embarrassing. I couldn’t mock him though. After all, I was wearing the same thing. 

I handed over the clip board covered in scribbles. Accounting for who checked on me, who I turned away and when. As he signed for ownership of the thing I asked him. “Did the company start doing night construction?”

“None that I know of.” He shook his head in response. “Wouldn’t surprise me though.” Every day this thing isn’t built costs these guys money.”

I told him the parts that didn't make me sound like a loony and he laughed at me. “Sounds like your getting tired. You doing okay out here? “ 

I laughed it off and thought nothing of it until tomorrow. 

A man died on the construction site, crushed by a fallen beam. 

The legal fanfare was long over by the time I returned. Even then the rumor mill was abuzz. I hadn’t stepped foot in the briefing room before I heard two people talking about it outside. “Can’t believe something that big would have failed like that.” Somebody in a turtleneck on the accounting side mumbled through a turkey sandwich. “I bet the safety guys fuming.” 

He was. I saw him yelling at his phone through a mix of about three languages. Every phone he owned in his office vibrating with loaded questions demanding answers. He gave me one look and swore as he shut the door. No one could have seen it coming. Rumor was a manufacturing error in the connection caused a beam to drop, crushing some poor guy all the way from Honduras there to build the thing.

There was no way what I saw was connected. At least that was what I told myself. I popped a nicotine pouch in my lip and drank my coke. Id salivate over Pretty women another time. I knew security would be tight.

I was right. The rovers came by twice as often. Doing in shack inspections telling me to sweep up non existent dirt. Everyone was on edge since the death. Emergencies like this meant corporate and everyone was afraid of a cull. Unemployment in America is like pulling teeth from an angry dog. You’re just going to leave in worse shape then you came. That meant everyone was in full CYA mode to make sure they didn't lose their job. I even had a manager come in to watch me as I worked.

Bill was an alright sort. He smoked like a chimney but so did my dad. At ten dollars a pack I wondered how either of them could afford it but old Habits die hard. Everyone else was shook like a jumping bean but that old man stayed cool. Hardly raised an eyebrow or said a word as we watched a dead horizon. Cars on the freeway would pass and that distant whoosh was the only thing that broke the silence until finally he spoke.

“So, Marty told me you saw something.” He leaned back in his folding chair, balancing on the rear legs with an effortless ease.

I shrugged, looking out the window and told him what i told Marty. “Some shadows over the Horizon. Must have been getting tired.”

He poked at his pack with a non chalance as he continued. “What else did you see?”

I froze like a kid caught in a cookie jar. My reaction told him what he wanted to know because he chuckled to himself as he put his chair back on all fours. He pulled a smoke out and nodded to the window. “Open it.”

I did as he asked. I knew it was grounds for termination for us both but looking at him it just seemed the right thing to do. He leaned forward, lit his cigarette, and took a deep breath to sigh. Whole thing looked like a confession at an AA meeting as he started. 

“I’ve been at this job for a over a decade. Company’s had me watch over the construction of two oil rigs, a lumber mill. A state prison and now here. When you work nights alone out here you’ll see some things. Some say it’s tricks but I think there’s more to it than that. Little things like to flicker along the darkness. Places we weren’t supposed to go. The junkies will see them. Shadows moving around in outlines of people. Most think they’re just high and off their rocker but i don't think you are using any help staying up. Usually it’s nothing, just little ones. Its the big one you have to worry about.”

I didn't say a word. I swear that man could read faces like a thrift store book cuz He didnt ask a thing. Just took a drag, beard stained yellow from years of tar and coffee. 

“I dont imagine those schools teach you much about what an Omen is. Suffice it say, the big one is usually a sign of something. Something bad. Ive seen him twice over the years.  Both times something terrible happened.”

“What did you do?” I asked him as gooseflesh ran up my arms. The whole situation just felt surreal. 

“Nothing you can do.” He shook His head and smoked some more. “No one to tell and no one would believe you. Just keep your head down, mouth shut, and whatever you do, pray that thing doesn’t see you.”

He finished his smoke and things went back to normal. He told me about his kids or what he could remember of them. Wife took them and ran years ago so he hadn’t seen them since. Never got married again because why bother?  Said he lost enough for one life. Hours passed and when someone came to relieve us, he stepped in his truck to leave. The door opened showing two MRE’s and a blanket in his cab. I would have thought he slept in the thing were it not for the hotel provisions to travel. Between projects he probably did.

“You remember what I told you. It ain’t your fault, and it sure as heck ain’t your business.“ With that he pulled off the lot and drove away.

Weeks passed and nothing changed. More workers, more scanned badges , and more flicking my thumb to an endless river of content. The buzz about the death died down and surprise inspections were all but forgotten. The nail in the coffin was the suits coming in. A bunch of people whose face I only recognize from plaques on a wall gave a half hearted speech full of buzzwords and somehow people knew things were done. The lip service was paid, serfs go back to work.

I thought nothing of it. Just tried to keep my head down like I was told. If there wasn't a catastrophe at work or a bill in default, there was something on the news telling me I was about to die. No difference I can make. Just leave me to my life of quiet desperation. 

That was until it happened again. I looked out at a night like any other in the last week. It was pouring rain and my service was acting up when I saw that giant thing again. A shadow stories tall flashed over the flood lights and hovered over Transformers built on post. The move was slow and deliberate, same rhythm as the cars on the horizon. Any slower I wouldn’t have caught it but the thing was there. Like some crane perched over the building with a strand of lowered cargo. The closer i looked however, the more saw a pair of arms. 

A flash flood happened two days later. Transformer blew and ten men were electrocuted. None survived. 

This time the government got involved. Police, Reporters, anything you could think of. I was Given a business card to our media rep and told not to open my mouth for anyone. I didn’t know what i could say, so I did as I was told. Walking into the skirted trailer we used as a meeting site, I locked eyes with Bill. A solemn nod from tired eyes. We both knew plenty without a word between us. A horrible truth and no one there to tell. 

I still would have kept it to myself. Would have called myself a nut and tried to forget. Over the months I almost did. But now I know what it looks like. A giant shadow, looming over the night, hands grasping for anything it can drag back to the dark. It’s skull looming over ribs of rebar and iron. Eyes cold glow of a pair of lamp posts in the distance. A death trap waiting to fall on another mouse. 

It’s been hugging the nuclear silo here for a week, and every day its been looking right at me.
