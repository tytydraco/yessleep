I went to a place in the desert with two of my friends for stargazing. It was about 4 am, so there was absolutely no one. Not to mention that the area itself is desolate even in the morning. Anyways, so we'd been to that same place many times before, and there'd always a bit of light from the moon. But that night, the night was completely dark. If I stretch my arm out, I wouldn't be able to see it.

Anyways, so we put a big mat on the sand and sit down. I was really nervous the entire drive to the desert for some reason. The whole vibe was particularly eerie that night. We sit down the three of us, and one of my friends insisted that I turn off the phone's flashlight in order to see the stars well. I didn't turn it off right there and then and kept pointing it around us to see if there is anything. It was so dark we couldn't even see each other.

After about 5 minutes of us sitting down, I pointed the phone ahead of us and saw the silhouette of something that resembled a dog walking across a few meters from us. My friends saw it too, but we decided to ignore it since dogs do come to this area sometimes. A few minutes had gone by, and I'd started to feel a bit relaxed. Turned off the flashlight and started inspecting the stars. They were absolutely beautiful, but that eerie feeling was still lingering. For some reason, the third guy was looking behind us the whole time with his phone's flashlight. I didn't question it. But he later on told me he saw a white cat with golden eyes in front of us and few minutes later behind us. 

Almost 10 minutes later, that guy who was looking behind us pointed his phone to our left and said "guys, look..". So me and the guy who insisted on turning off our phones both did what he asked. I couldn't believe it. I saw a "man" standing, at least that was my first impression. He stood there with the flash illuminating his shape. I thought someone who lived nearby was annoyed by us. But that was certainly not a man. It was just stood there.. My brain thought it could be a pillar of some sort. But again, when we parked our car, the area was completely empty. Just sand.. nothing else. Of course, we were all just so shocked no one said a word. We instinctively knew it was paranormal. After about 10 seconds or so, the "thing" became a bit clearer. It was like a floating white shirt. I couldn't see its head or limbs. But it was definitely white. And right there and then, it started floating towards us. Like hovering over the ground. When we saw that, the stargazing guy immediately ran away to the car without waiting for us lol. Me and the other guy tried to act tough, but we were also very scared. So we grabbed the mat and shoved it into the trunk of the car and literally threw ourselves into the car and drove away as fast as we could.



Looking back, what we say was exactly that white apparition that is seen in cartoons/movies. That one that flies around basically.
