I was a researcher, deployed among a team to conduct an investigation of an obscure region of the Amazon rainforest. Our objective was to establish an outpost which would enable us to collect data on the ecological phenomena occurring in the surrounding region. This particular region of the rainforest had not been studied to a particularly significant degree.

Upon setting up the framework of our outpost, we began making observations of the surrounding region. At first glance, it appeared that much of the environment was very much resembling of what you would expect from other regions of the Amazon rainforest more broadly. However, upon further inspection, there was something different. 

There was a very unusual assortment of plant specimens. It was clearly an accumulation of the same species of plant, but it seemed as though they violently wound around each other, producing contorted shapes which immediately gauged all our interest. The bulk of the plants appeared to be this fur-looking leaves, which drooped over each other to produce a messy collection of mass. Another distinct feature, however, we're these long, slightly curved and brightly coloured thorns. They would eminate from the furry mass 9f leaves, tearing through their matter and reaching beyond. 

One of the other researchers within my team, Jack, could be particularly impulsive and arrogant when faced with what he regarded as an opportunity to explore and discover. So he decided to do something which I still wish I had stopped him from doing. He began taking close inspection. He crouched and began navigating his way through some of the constrained and winding tunnels which were formed by these plants. We could see through his camera that these plants were almost caving around each other and very barely providing enough space for Jack to move. 

Something very interesting could also be observes through his camera. Very occasionally, beyond the messy accumulation of fur-looking leaves, you could make out certain shapes formed by the twigs beneath. Some of these plants appeared to conform to a humanoid shape. They were like half-crouched humans in a state of...pain? This was a very subtle resemblance though and ultimately all these things just gave the impression of outrageously messy, fur-covered and thorn emanating plants.

Jack described the smell as musty and reeking of undergrowth, before screaming intensely. Jack almost never screamed, and never like this. He was always considered a bit of an alpha male mentality. In his college days, he was fairly successful at charming the opposite sex, and he would always give the impression of letting anything roll of his back. Very much what one might describe as a "cool kid". Yet now, this scream was the agonising scream of a child. 

Our intuition led us to conclude that one of those thorns had pierced his skin, and so we rushed out and beckoned him back the way he came. He began moving and eventually we could see him frantically moving backwards towards us. Once he came out, he fell back and was unconscious. We took him inside the outpost and he was asleep for an hour. Upon waking up, he initially appeared...very optimistic. He seemed to have completely shrugged off any of the prior occurrences, and was now inexplicably enthusiastic to continue our work.

We convinced him to give himself a rest first, before we would continue our operation perhaps after a couple of days. We went to sleep for the night. The next day, Jack had changed. I don't simply mean in character, I mean physically. His skin had started to harden. You could also see changes in its texture. The skin had become rough and from it began emanating green-coloured cells. 

Over the course of the day, Jack had become more rigid in his physical appearance. He began walking outside and said that he wanted to continue his investigation into those plants. He insisted that he felt perfectly fine. All he consumed was water, without eating anything. When offered food, he refused. He would constantly head outside,  explaining that he just needed to go outside and get some light from the sun. When this became persistent, we grew concerned. 

His skin became extremely hard, like a combination of wood and shell. From the green moss emanated what appeared to be stringy leaves. He insisted that he was okay and that he merely needed to continue his investigation of those plants. He refused to wear any clothes, and would stay out there for hours. Another day passed and upon waking up in the morning and finding him absent from his bed, we headed outside. 

He was nowhere to be seen. We looked around, and logically headed towards the area where he had been spending so much of his time. On the outskirts of the big group of plants, it seemed that the shape of the while mass had slightly changed, getting larger. On the very edge was another plant, with slightly less green matter than the rest, but evidently growing to be like the others. The bottom of the plant resembled human feet, except they were wooden, splintered and had begun to diverge into roots, firmly holding the structure in place. Most notably, however, out of the green stringy leaves began to emanate these peculiar but distinct looking thorns.
