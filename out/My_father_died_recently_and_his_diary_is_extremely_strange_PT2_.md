I just woke up. The window was broken and there was a trail of blood flowing from it to beside me. I glanced around the bathroom floor looking for the creature. Everything looked normal, until I noticed the shotgun was missing. Gerald was staring out the window at the woods, looking terrified and whimpering as he shook. That son of a bitch took my only weapon! But why didn't it kill me? Is it trying to toy with me and scare me on purpose? I'll keep copying down the entries from my dad's diary.

I woke up and got the windows fixed. It was complicated trying to explain how or why a pack of wolves broke into my house and left bear claw marks on the front door to the repair guys, even though I know that's not what happened. But I got silver bars on the windows to try and keep that thing out better. I specifically requested silver, since even though I've never believed in anything supernatural before now, I read that a lot of evil spirits and creatures are repelled by silver. I've also decided to name the thing Frank, since it looked like it was stitched together like Frankenstein. I'll try to get more cameras and a bit of barbed wire set up, and write down anything that happens.

The silver bars worked! Last night, while I was sitting in the living room, Frank tried prying open the bars on the window behind the TV, but his hands got burnt from the silver! I'll try and find any silver jewelry and silverware I can find and place it by all the doors and windows. I'll also try and get some silver buckshot for my shotgun to see if that can put him down. That motherfucker won't even know what hit him!

The silverware and jewelry by the doors worked last night. Frank came close to the house, but stayed back just beyond the light of the porch light. He probably smells the silver. He tried getting to the chickens, but I blew his arm clean off with the shotgun. He limped away after I shot him as the stump that was his arm sizzled from the silver buckshot, yet he still regenerated. I'll have to try and find a way to damage Frank without it regenerating. I also noticed something disturbing. The nubs on its shoulders looked like they had deer legs stitched to them. Something, or someone, is stitching more parts to him. Maybe its the cloaked person from June 6th that's stitching Frank together.

I went on a walk today, looking for Frank. I thought that since I've only seen him at night that he'd be asleep during the day and I could try and kill him again, this time in his sleep. Instead, I found something worse. I found a large stone sculpture. It looked like Frank, except it had large bat wings, a tail, and a human head and arms sticking from its throat. At the base of the statue, it had three of those runestones. One looked like the rune that was left in the middle of the carving on June 5th. It had a triangle with a line at each side of its flat top. One looked like a stick person, and the other looked like a circle with three lines going vertically from the bottom. That 3rd symbol looked like a skull. I quickly started grabbing the stones from the altar. I was hoping they'd help me kill Frank, but as I got the skull rune into my pocket I heard someone yell behind me. They didn't say anything intelligible. It was more like a person screaming in anger. I then saw the cloaked person running at me, he had to be 8 feet or taller. He looked ancient, as if he was on the verge of turning to dust. He had a long, white scraggly beard. He was bald. His face was skeletal with sunken, dead eyes. But despite looking like he would fall apart with a single movement, he ran as if he was a fit male in their young 20s. I started sprinting back towards the house. I heard his footsteps stop as I got beyond the tree line. I turned back, and he was just standing in the woods, watching me as I ran back into my house and locked the door. Who built that altar? Was the cloaked man worshiping Frank?

I got an email from a person online, they wrote in extremely cryptic lines. I'll copy down the email here. "Flesh of man, antlers of deer. The spirit of the old one will appear. As the death is stronger, it means she's near. Rune of deer, man and skull will have strong enough pull. Enough to make her fall and end it all. Night of full moon, burn the deer rune. Night of blood, encase rune of man in mud. Day of Hallows, imbed rune of skull in her head. Only then she can fall, and rest will come to all." What the hell does all this mean? I'm guessing the night of blood means the blood moon, which is in a month. But what does day of Hallows mean? Does it mean Halloween? Also, does this mean Frank is a woman? The full moon is tomorrow night, I'll try burning the deer rune and see if it does anything.

August 4th 2022 (Entry 11)

I just burned the deer rune, I think it's starting to work. When I stepped outside, I could smell Frank, but she stayed away because of the silver cutlery, jewelry and bars. I could hear the cloaked man and multiple other people screaming in the woods. I lit the fire, as I did this I heard Frank starting to let out the human wolf scream I had heard on the cameras when I first got them installed. She then started mimicking my wife again, begging me to not set the rune on fire. I threw the rune into the fire, and everything went silent besides from the crackling of the fire and my heavy breathing. The fire turned blue as a ghostly version of Frank's face appeared and screamed at me, before the fire fizzled out with a loud hiss. Frank and all the people in the woods then started screaming at the same time. It then went quiet. I started running back to the house. I could hear Frank and at least 5 people running after me. As I looked back, all of the cultists looked to be as ancient as the cloaked man. This was except for a few that looked to be in their mid 20s. They still ran extremely fast. I slammed and locked the door as I got inside, as I could hear the cultists banging on the door. I saw Frank trying to claw through the silver bars at the windows. Smoke was coming from her hands as she touched the silver. I stayed in the living room with my shotgun, the cultists surprisingly weren't able to break through. The sun started to rise and they ran back into the woods. I think I'll be able to do this, play this game, as long as I can survive until Halloween.

I think I'll end this part here, I found the last remaining rune in a shoebox in a crawlspace in the closet hidden under boxes of my dad's stuff. It was like Dad was trying to hide it, which is understandable because the cultists he described would probably try and steal the rune back so no one can kill Frank before they finish whatever they're doing with her. I still have a few months until Halloween, so I'll try and hold out till then. I'll update you all soon.
