I never believed in the supernatural. Ghosts, demons, and all that stuff belonged in movies and folklore, far removed from the mundane reality of my daily life. That is, until I moved into the old house on Elm Street.

I’d just landed a new job in a small town, and the rent was cheap. The house was an old Victorian, the kind with creaky floorboards and a musty smell that seemed to have soaked into the walls over decades. My friends joked about it being haunted, but I brushed off their comments. It was just an old house, right?

The first few nights were uneventful. I spent my evenings unpacking and settling in, enjoying the solitude and the novelty of having a whole house to myself. But then things started to get strange.

It began with the noises. At first, they were subtle: a soft creak here, a distant thud there. I chalked it up to the house settling. But then the sounds became more distinct. I’d hear footsteps in the hallway outside my bedroom, slow and deliberate. I’d lie in bed, heart pounding, telling myself it was just my imagination. After all, who would be walking around in my house at three in the morning?

One night, I woke up to the sound of whispering. It was so faint I thought I might be dreaming, but as I strained to listen, I could make out the hushed voices. They were too quiet to understand, but the tone was urgent, almost pleading. I jumped out of bed and turned on all the lights, but there was no one there. The whispering stopped as soon as the room was illuminated.

Sleep became a rare luxury. I’d lie awake, dreading the inevitable sounds that would start as soon as the house was dark and silent. One particularly restless night, I decided to investigate. Armed with a flashlight, I tiptoed through the house, checking every room and corner. Everything seemed normal until I reached the basement door.

The basement had always given me the creeps, and I avoided it as much as possible. But something compelled me to open the door and descend the narrow wooden steps. The air grew colder with each step, and the smell of damp earth grew stronger. My flashlight flickered as I reached the bottom, casting eerie shadows on the stone walls.

In the corner of the basement, I noticed a small door I hadn’t seen before. It was almost hidden behind a stack of old boxes. My heart raced as I approached it. The door was locked, but the key was in the lock, as if someone had recently used it.

I hesitated, then turned the key. The door creaked open, revealing a small, dark room. The smell of decay was overpowering. As my flashlight swept the room, I saw something that made my blood run cold: old, yellowed photographs covering the walls. They were all pictures of the house, taken over the years. In each one, a shadowy figure stood in the background, barely visible but unmistakably there.

My breath caught in my throat as I realized the figure was in every photo, always in the same spot, always watching. I stumbled back, knocking over a box and sending its contents spilling across the floor. Among the debris was a diary, its cover worn and cracked. I picked it up with trembling hands and flipped through the pages.

The diary belonged to a woman named Margaret, who had lived in the house over a century ago. Her entries started out mundane, but soon turned dark. She wrote about seeing a shadowy figure in the house, hearing whispers in the night, and feeling watched. Her final entry was a frantic scrawl, describing how the figure had come closer and closer, until it finally entered her room.

I dropped the diary and ran up the stairs, my mind racing. The noises, the whispers, the photographs—it all made sense now. The house was haunted, and whatever haunted it had latched onto me.

That night, I packed a bag and fled the house. I moved in with a friend and never went back. But the experience stayed with me. Sometimes, late at night, I hear faint whispers and see shadowy figures out of the corner of my eye. I try to convince myself it’s just my imagination, but deep down, I know the truth. The thing in that house is still with me, and it’s only a matter of time before it comes closer.
