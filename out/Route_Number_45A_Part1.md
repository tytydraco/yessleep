Sarah and I were returning back home from a party .The road we usually take was inaccessible  as a tree fell down in the middle of the path due to the storm.
We waited for a while in the club .

Sarah ,“ Girl it's already late now . Let's go back to the hostel. ”
I said “ But how will we ? You know the road is blocked because of that big oak tree .”

Sarah said “ We should take another road.”

 “ Do you seriously think ? I mean have you heard about weird accidents and mysterious deaths that happened on that road especially between 10 p.m to 1:50 a.m .” 

Sarah, “ Those are just rumours and superstitions .Come on do you seriously believe these things in the 21st century? ”
I , “ But..”.
Sarah “ Get inside the car .” 

I and Sarah sat in the car and Sarah started driving .When We reached the road the direction signs were changed .
A guy who was the owner of a nearby motel stopped them and asked “Where are you going ? Are you taking route number 45A ” .

Sarah, “ Yes we are .”
The guy, “ Don't you know the place is cursed and haunted  ? It's dangerous to go there at this time ”. 
Sarah “We don't believe in such superstitious things and it's none of your business to care about where we are going .” 

I , “ Sarah I am feeling scared . Let's cancel the plan now and wait till the morning .Why take the risk ? ”

“Wait till what ?You know the head of the hostel is coming for inspection early this morning ”.

Sarah started driving .

After an hour passed I said to Sarah “How long is this road? It's already been an hour. Last time when I travelled from this road in the morning, it only took 40 minutes to reach the hostel .”

After half an hour Sarah noticed us crossing the same path again,we crossed earlier and continued to drive but then after a few minutes she noticed that We were passing the same path we had passed earlier.

At this point we were extremely confused and terrified .
I pointed out a light coming from the woods and said “ I think there are some people who can help us to find the right path.”

We drove through the woods and reached that place from where the light was coming .It was a hotel .

We checked into the hotel .I noticed that all clocks in the hotel were showing 9 o’ clock while in her watch it was 12 p.m .

There were no other guests visible in the hotel. We were only guests in whole hotel.
I asked the receptionist “ Is there nobody in this hotel? ”. 

Receptionist ,“ other people are in their rooms. "

We booked a room for an overnight stay .

After a few minutes I heard a knock on the door of the hotel room .
I asked “ Who are you ?” .
The voice came “ Hello ,I am a waiter . If you need something or want to order food then please tell me. I was here to inform you that the basic menu that includes pasta ,some fruits , pepperoni pizza,salad and chicken soup is free with overnight stay. ” 

Sarah opened the door but to her surprise there was nobody ,the lights were switched off except from one place where a little bit of light was coming from.
Sarah saw a nurse .
The nurse shouted “ Hey you all .Come downstairs for dinner. ”  

Sarah and I started walking but then We noticed a little bit of difference in the hotel .
The walls looked crusty and old .The floor looked messed up with dry leaves and dirt.

We came to our senses and I said “Something just doesn't feel right here.”

We ran out of the hotel .Both hurriedly sat in their car and Sarah started driving the car out of parking .She saw the nurse standing in their way and tried to stop the car but  the car passed through the body of the nurse .

We started shouting and panicking and We crashed into a pillar in the parking lot .

We fainted .


Next morning : 

I woke up in her hostel bed and started touching my face ,neck and rest of my body in disbelief that I am still alive.

I realised what happened last night and started looking for Sarah. I started knocking the door of Sarah’s bedroom like crazy .

Sarah opened the door and said “ Good morning Nia. Why were you knocking on my door like crazy ? Are you okay darling?
How can I help ?”.

I replied “ Do you remember last night we were at a club,and because the main road was blocked by the tree ,we had to take a different route . We took cursed  route 45A and stopped at a hotel and suddenly the hotel turned into an old rustic building.
We tried to escape but our car crashed into a pillar in the parking lot .”

 “ Chill Nia .Did you watch some horror movie or read some horror book again? There is no road called Route number 45A in the way of the club we usually visit. Last time we visited the club was 3 weeks ago. That was probably some nightmare .I told you earlier ,stop watching those horror series ,you will stop getting nightmares.”

“But what about that wound you have on your forehead ” ,I said this while pointing towards wounds on Sarah's forehead .

“You got this wound because of the car accident last night”.

Sarah turned around and looked at her face in the mirror touching her wound.Sarah said “Oh this (while touching her wound ) I got this because I slipped from the stairs last evening.”

I had a sigh of relief. 

 “It's already 9 a.m right now .We are getting late for work. Hurry up and get ready for work .”Sarah said this while pushing me to go and get ready .

 “I am not feeling well today .I would like to have a day off. Please inform the manager.”

After a while Sarah came and asked me “Have you seen my car? It's not in the parking lot ”

I replied “How could I know where your car is ?”.

Few minutes later :

I heard Sarah screaming .She came out and saw that headlights of Sarah ’s car were broken and there was a big dent in front of the car as if the accident I saw in my nightmare happened in reality . Meanwhile Sarah was shouting “I won't leave the bastard who did this to my brand new expensive car.”

I decided to go to the office since weird things were happening with us in the morning . Both of us got ready for the office and called a cab .

When I sat in the cab I noticed the digital clock was showing 9 a.m.
After we reached our destination I noticed again that the digital clock was still showing 9 a.m.

I checked my phone and it was still 9am. I pointed out the absurdity of the situation to Sarah .

Everything went blank .

I woke up in the hotel room in the middle of night .

I looked at my phone and it was still 9 o clock. but it was dark outside the window .

It was clearly night .
I thought “So that was probably a nightmare .”

I went to the washroom but to my surprise the washroom was dirty and old .It looked like the washroom was part of some abandoned building and hadn't been cleaned  for years .

I used the washroom before I went to bed and the washroom was not like this when I checked it last time .

I turned around and the hotel room looked like a room with old crusty walls like part of some old abandoned building. I started running around and looking for Sarah.
The whole hotel looked like some old abandoned building and Sarah was nowhere to be found .

I heard a voice calling her name “Nia Nia Nia….”.

When I looked around there was nobody to be found .

I fainted then and there .

I woke up in the hospital and had stitches on my forehead and left leg was broken .
I tried to get up but was unable to because of pain .

I asked the nurse “ Excuse me .How did I get here?What am I doing here ?”

Nurse replied “You met with a terrible accident a few days ago .Your car crashed in the woods. Someone from a nearby village found you and called the ambulance .”

I asked “What ,accident in the woods ? Where is Sarah ? Is she safe ? She was with me last night in the car accident. ” 

Nurse replied “Who Sarah ? Do you have her number ? You were alone in the woods .Police had already investigated the accident and there was nobody else .”


1 month later :

I was discharged from the hospital .After that I returned back to the hostel and immediately started looking for Sarah .

I knocked at Sarah’s door and asked other people in the hostel about Sarah .
To my surprise, nobody knew Sarah in the hostel. In fact, according to the manager there was no girl named Sarah  living in the hostel and the room I claimed belonged to Sarah was actually a store room .

After hearing this I thought “ No this can't be possible.We worked in the same office and we lived in the same hostel. She used to share her car with me…… the ..the car ,the car .The number plate of the car would be enough to prove her existence and also records from our office. ”

I went to investigate the information about the office colleague named Sarah and got details and the address of Sarah from the manager. .

 When the doorbell rang at Sarah's house.A lady in white dress opened the door. I asked her “Is this Sarah’s address?”
the lady replied “Yes it is .”
 “Can you please call Sarah. I am Nia Johnas  and I am Sarah's colleague.”

The lady replied “Hello ,I am Sarah. ”
I was shocked and said“What ? You are not my colleague or my friend I know from months ”
A man said from the background “What’s going on Sarah ? Who are you talking to?” It was Sarah's husband.
Sarah replied to her husband “She is a colleague from office .I coming in few minutes baby ”

While we worked in the same office there was not much communication between us since we worked in different departments .
Sarah offered to come inside her house and I explained everything to Sarah .

Sarah said “Maybe you were experiencing hallucinations when you were in hospital and merged it with real life events .” 

We had a coffee together and I returned to my normal life .

Three days passed by :

I received a call from an unknown number. It was from the police station .

“We wanted to talk about the car involved in the car crash that belonged to Sarah D Cruz who died 5 years ago in the same area .”
