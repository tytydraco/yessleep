I moved to the old neighborhood when my parents divorced. Mom wanted a fresh start, and she found a small, affordable house on the outskirts of town. The place was quiet, surrounded by a dense forest, and it felt like a ghost town, especially after dark.

On my second day there, I met a kid named Max while I was exploring the back roads. He was about my age, with a mop of curly hair and a mischievous grin. He told me about an abandoned playground deep in the woods, hidden from view by the overgrown trees. The older kids called it "The Forgotten Playground."

“They say it’s haunted,” Max said with a smirk. “Bet you’re too scared to go there.”

I wasn’t afraid of ghosts. At least, that’s what I told myself. And I wasn’t about to let some kid I just met think I was chicken. So, I followed him.

The path to the playground was nearly invisible, covered by fallen leaves and creeping vines. As we walked, the trees grew thicker, their branches intertwining like skeletal fingers. The air felt colder, and the sounds of the forest seemed to vanish, replaced by an eerie silence.

Finally, we reached a clearing, and there it was: The Forgotten Playground. It looked ancient, like it hadn’t seen children in decades. The swings hung low, their chains rusted and creaking in the breeze. A broken slide lay in pieces, half-buried under a blanket of moss, and the merry-go-round partially sank into the earth.

Max ran ahead, laughing, daring me to catch him. But something about the place felt wrong. As I stepped onto the cracked asphalt, I felt a chill run down my spine. I turned around, half expecting to see someone watching us, but we were alone. Or at least, that’s what I thought.

“Come on, don’t be such a wuss!” Max shouted from the swing set.

I hesitated, but then I walked over to him. He jumped on one of the swings and started pumping his legs, going higher and higher. The chains groaned under his weight, and I worried they might snap. I took a seat on the swing next to him, and soon we were both soaring into the air.

“Ever hear the story about the kids who went missing here?” Max asked suddenly, his tone different—more serious.

I shook my head, gripping the rusty chains tighter.

“Some say they were playing hide and seek when they disappeared. They never found their bodies,” he continued. “But some nights, if you’re quiet, you can still hear them whispering.”

I laughed nervously, trying to brush it off. “You’re full of it, Max.”

“Am I?” he replied with a grin. “Listen.”

We both stopped swinging. The forest was deathly silent. Then I heard it—a faint whisper, like the wind through the trees, but more distinct. Voices. Childish laughter.

“Let’s play,” a voice whispered in my ear.

I jolted, looking around, but no one was there. Max jumped off his swing and landed on the ground with a thud.

“Let’s go explore the Merry Go Round,” he said, walking toward the rusty, sunken ride.

I didn’t want to go any deeper into the playground, but I didn’t want to seem scared either. So, I followed. Max climbed onto the merry-go-round and gave it a push, its rusted metal groaning as it slowly turned.

“Come on,” he urged. “Help me push it.”

Reluctantly, I stepped forward, grabbing one of the bars. As we pushed, the whispers grew louder, swirling around us like the autumn leaves caught in a gust of wind. The playground seemed to come alive. The swings swayed by themselves, the seesaw creaked up and down, and the broken pieces of the slide rattled as if someone were sliding down.

Suddenly, the merry-go-round spun faster than we could have pushed it. I let go, stumbling back, but Max stayed on, laughing as it whirled around. His laughter mixed with the whispers, creating a haunting melody that echoed through the trees.

“Stop it, Max!” I shouted. But he just kept spinning.

Then, without warning, he vanished. One moment he was there, and the next, he was gone. The merry-go-round came to a sudden stop, and the whispers fell silent.

“Max?” I called out, panic rising in my chest. “Max!”

I ran around the playground, searching for him, but there was no sign of him anywhere. It was like he had never been there at all. That’s when I realized I was standing in the middle of the clearing, surrounded by the dark, towering trees, all alone.

“Come play with us,” the voices whispered again, louder this time, closer.

I turned to run, but something grabbed my leg. I looked down and saw a small hand, pale and cold, emerging from the ground. I screamed, kicked it away, and bolted for the path. As I ran, I could hear them behind me—footsteps, laughter, the rustling of leaves.

I burst out of the woods, gasping for breath, and didn’t stop running until I reached my house. I slammed the door behind me and locked it, my heart pounding in my chest.

When I told my mom about Max and the playground, she looked at me with a confused expression.

“Max?” she asked. “There’s no Max in this neighborhood.”

I persisted, describing him in detail, but she simply shook her head. “You must be mistaken, honey. No one’s lived in that house for years.”

I never returned to the Forgotten Playground. I never saw Max again, either. But sometimes, late at night, I can still hear the laughter and whispers calling me back to play.
