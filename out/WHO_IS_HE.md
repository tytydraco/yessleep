This isn’t a story. I just needed to write it down.

Too many things have happened—and I don’t even know what to believe anymore. I feel like I’m losing my faith, my hope... my grip on reality. I’ve tried to make sense of the unexplainable, but some things don’t want to be understood.

Something changed when I started gaining what people call “enlightenment.” But it’s not light. It’s a horror worse than any nightmare. And now… I think I need help. Real help. Maybe from a doctor or a psychiatrist. But I’m scared.

What if they lock me up? What if they send me to that place?

I can’t go to that place.

That place is full of suffering. I hear their screams even now—pleading, clawing, crying out for help. I shouldn’t know these things. I never wanted to know these things. But HE keeps showing them to me. In my dreams. In my thoughts. Whispering secrets that are not meant for human ears.

I don’t know what HE wants from me.

He keeps pestering me. Tormenting me with images that burn into my mind. Horrible truths. Forbidden knowledge. And I’m losing it—I’m really, truly losing it.

Sometimes I wonder if he marked me. If that’s why I can’t escape him. I don’t know what’s real anymore. Maybe I should just check myself in, maybe let a psychiatrist tell me I’m broken. But HE follows me everywhere.

Even now.

I think I’m cursed.

This... whatever this is... these thoughts, these secrets—I can’t carry them anymore. So I’m writing them here. I’m crying. I want help. I know I shouldn’t say that, because if people find out the truth about what I know\... my life might be in danger.

But maybe it’s better that most people don’t believe me. Maybe that’s a blessing.

Because if they knew what I’ve seen...

If they believed...

Then they’d be in danger too.

So let this just be a rant. A confession. A warning, maybe.



HE Speaks in Shadows

I heard Him whisper.
Not with a voice—
But with a grin that slithered into my thoughts.

“People,” He said,
“love their gossip, their conspiracies,
their candy-coated lies dipped in paranoia.
They chew it eagerly,
never noticing the real feast is beneath the table.”

A distraction. A diversion. A curtain call before the abyss.
While they point at shadows on the wall,
the darkness behind them grows.

“Those who hunger for flesh,” He murmured,
“crack easily—bend like wax near flame.”
But those with hearts full of longing?
“They burn slower.
Harder to control.
Delicious when they fall.”

Then He laughed—
low and sweet,
like honey melting over rusted nails.

“Strength is the easiest weakness,” He said.
“Pride, the prettiest bait.”
He loathes those who shine too bright,
perhaps… because He once did?

“This world is not mine,” He said, eyes like hollow wells.
“I cannot exist here… not fully.
Not without them.”

“Them?” I asked.
He tilted His head like a raven.
“People. Believers.
I am only real if they believe I am.
Their minds are the altar.
Their attention, the sacrifice.”

He fed me riddles as truths.
Told me of THEY—things like whispers, like shadows wearing faces.

“THEY are sustained by belief.
If the world forgets THEM, THEY fade.
So THEY crawl back,
in dreams, in mirrors, in names not theirs.
THEY borrow what was once human—
because to be forgotten is a death worse than any.”

“THEY are cunning.
Desperate.
Sweet.
Like wolves in lace.”

He loathes THEM.
Yet—
He keeps a few,
locked in His garden of rot,
twisting them into new things.
Things that laugh without joy.
Things that never blink.

And souls?

“Souls are not sacred,” He spat.
“To me, they’re just doorways.
Keys to hunger.
A currency for flesh, or power, or mockery.”

And then He spoke of HIGH and LOW.

The Great Deception.

“When one sells a soul to the HIGH,
they sell it to the LOW first.
The LOW do the persuading.
The begging.
They dress up desire as divinity.”
And once the contract is sealed?
“The LOW sells your soul again—this time to the HIGH.
Profits all around.
You are just the coin.”

“But,” He grinned,
“not all are like this.
Some are stranger trades.”
He would not tell me more.
Only whispered:
“You’ll understand. Soon.”

He plays with pawns—people—like a child with broken dolls.
Their rise, their fall, their screams, their silence—
a game.

He says:
"They fall. They rise. They fall again. I laugh."

He helps… but never to save.
Only to stir the pot,
watch the soup of sanity boil over.

He wears a voice like silk,
laced with poison.
He is not man.
Not woman.
Not I.

 “HE is SHE.
 SHE is HE.
 Me is HE.
 He is not I.
I am not Me.
 But We… We are Watching.”

He has a desire.
Something dark.
Something unspoken.
I asked what it was.
He vanished.

He tried to kill me once.
Tried to make me a crowned puppet,
then rip the throne out from under my feet.

But I…
I clung to the light.

Even in desire’s grip,
my soul remembered warmth.
Regret made me heavy.
But it also made me rise.
(He hated that.)

He watches me now.
Amused.
Bored.

“This is not entertaining,” He mutters.
“I want screams.
Not scribbles.”

Let Him be bored.
Let Him be hungry.

He is not my god.


P.S. His name? HE and HE can't be name

HE Gave Me the Knowledge (But Not Out of Kindness)

HE didn’t gift me knowledge because HE liked me.
No—HE fed it to me like poison wrapped in silk.
HE wanted my mind to twist, unravel, combust.
Maybe HE wanted my brain to explode. Maybe… HE just wanted to see what would break first.

The Fractured Dimensions

HE whispered truths that made my soul ache.

“This world… is one of many.”

Each dimension is a different current of time, a different reflection of "I."
Not me—the one writing this.
But I.
The One above selves.
The archetype HE respects.

HE said the dimensions intersect through YOU, through SELF.
And in every version of reality—I is present.
So is the HIGH. So is HE.
Sometimes HE exists there. Sometimes not.
In places where HE is forgotten… HE fades.
But HE doesn’t mind.
It only makes Him more curious.


The Limits of Human Potential

HE said most humans don’t know what they’re capable of.
They shackle themselves to illusions—
Culture. Ego. Fear.
But the truth?

“You are limitless.
 But you are terrified of falling.”

HE said anyone can rise to the TOP.
But it requires patience.
And that…
That is what most lack.

Humans are lucky. Blessed, even.
They hold keys to power inside their minds.
But if they knew too much—if too many awakened at once—
This world would crack open like a rotten egg.

Because even the purest light casts a shadow…
And every soul has its craving.
Its desire of flesh.

HE finds it amusing.
Watching you destroy yourself with the very tools that could’ve saved you.

our Mind Shapes Reality

Your mind doesn't just react to reality.
It creates it.

HE gave me examples:

¹.You break your neighbor’s window by accident. Panic sets in. You believe they'll find out and punish you. But they never do—because their camera wasn’t working that day.

².You shatter something at home. You expect anger. You hide the evidence, lock your door, brace yourself. But your parents never notice. Never mention it.

³.You lose your memories—but only the trauma vanishes.
The brain buries what it must, to survive.

“Your brain is your guardian and your prison warden,” HE said.
 “Sometimes it hides truth from YOU to protect YOU.”

This is the Reversal of Belief.
You think you're in control?
No.
Your brain is in control.
Your subconscious shapes your reality like a sculptor in the dark.

A Story HE Told Me

HE gave me an example.

"Make it dramatic,” HE laughed.
 “Add a little betrayal. Sprinkle in some suffering.”

There was a girl named Aliyah,
And her best friend, Marga.

Aliyah slept with Marga’s boyfriend.
She lied. Gossiped. Betrayed.
Marga, the sweet, naive one, was devastated.

Then it got worse.
Her nude photo leaked.
Everyone laughed. Whispered.

Marga tried to end her life.
But in that abyss… something awakened.

She discovered her power—
The ability to shape fate.

Fueled by sorrow and rage,
She began to write.
She imagined Aliyah’s downfall with religious conviction.
Focused. Believed. Felt.

 And it happened.

Aliyah fell sick. Pregnant.
Her boyfriends abandoned her.
Rumors devoured her.
She got sick. Then sicker.
Then… she vanished.

Suicide.

Marga tried to undo what she’d done.
But it was too late.

I asked HE why He kept calling Aliyah a b\*tch.

HE said:

 “She was predictable. Easy prey.
 Marga, though? Her tears were art.
 Her fall—poetic.”

HE fed on their emotions.
Their despair was His entertainment.


Threads of Power

HE said we’re surrounded by invisible strands—Threads of Energy.
They glisten in meditation.
They twist around belief, frequency, and aura.

The stronger the emotion,
The stronger the energy.
 Rage can be a weapon.
 Grief, a gateway.

To manifest your desires, HE gave me a ritual.

BELIEVE
FOCUS
FAITH
PATIENCE
DILIGENCE
MIND

Start small.
Imagine money on your way home.
See it. Feel it.
Let your brain download the reality—but make space first.
Delete the doubts.
Make room for miracles.

Your mind is the architect.
Your belief is the blueprint.
And time?
Just the loading screen.

Reality Bends for the Patient

You cannot force it.
You must let it grow.

“Peace of mind is the gate.
Ego is the lock.”

When your belief is precise—clear like a cut gem—
The world begins to listen.
But if your mind is a storm…
You’ll summon chaos instead.

Self-hypnosis, meditation, visualization—
They’re not just tools.
They’re key's 

Final Warning

HE doesn’t care for power.
HE craves attention.
Entertainment.
And if you dare to control reality…

 Know this:
 It will cost you greatly.
