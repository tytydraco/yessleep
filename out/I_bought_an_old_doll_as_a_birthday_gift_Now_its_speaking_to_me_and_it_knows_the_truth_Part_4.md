I woke up feeling exhausted and drained. I had slept poorly and dimly remembered more strange dreams from the times I had managed to sleep at all. Dreams of many voices speaking to me from seemingly nowhere. Confusion, loneliness and one other being besides the faces that would come and go and leave and stay. I could not make out the face, but I kept thinking of a yellow dress and a name....Ruby

When I forced myself up and out of bed I almost panicked at the time. Then I remembered I had essentially lost my job and could sleep in if I wanted to, at least for now. I heard a soft morning tune being hummed at the edge of my perception and I knew Matilda was awake, assuming she ever slept that is. I had kept my word and let her sit on a shelf in my bedroom and I was afraid that her proximity had worsened the bizarre dreams I was having. I felt a strange and profound sense of empathy and sadness for her. More still when I recalled the feelings of loneliness and the constant befriending and then abandonment of so many faces, so many people.

I reached out to her with a soft,

“Good morning, Matilda.” The humming stopped and the response was quick,

“Good morning my friend. I hope you are okay; you seem like you had a rough night. I think some caffeine would do you well. Did you want to go to the kitchen and have one of your coffee drinks?” I finally looked over to the doll I was speaking to and saw Matilda smiling ear to ear as she spoke.

“Thanks for your concern, Matilda. I will be okay. Actually, I needed to go to the store today. So, I hate to say it but I need to leave you here for just an hour. The shop doesn't let people take backpacks in since people might steal stuff, so I wouldn't be able to take you in anyway. I promise it will be a short stop and I will be right back, okay?” There was a considerate moment and then she spoke again in a dejected and sad tone,

“Oh....alright. I guess that is fine. I will be alright, just please don’t be long. Also, would you be able to leave the TV box on. I like watching people do things and it feels less lonely.” I agreed to her request and turned on some daytime TV for her and closed the door, waving goodbye as I did.

I had not technically lied. I was going to a store. Just that it was the store I had purchased her from. Truth Antique was open now and I was going there with some questions that the strange old woman who worked there might hopefully be able to answer.

I arrived early, right when they were opening it seemed. I saw the familiar old woman unlocking the doors and turning on a flickering open sign. I thought it was good that no other customers seemed to be waiting to get in. I needed some of her time to get some questions answered. Whatever the true nature of Matilda was, this woman knew something about it.

I rushed toward the door and stepped inside. The familiar scent of old wood and mothballs assailed me as I entered. I walked further in, expecting to see her close by, since I had just gone in right after she had unlocked the doors. Surprisingly she was nowhere to be seen near the front. I did not know how she could have moved so quickly, but I started walking around, trying to find her.

The place felt different than before. I thought I remembered it being smaller. Yet as I walked, trying to find the shopkeeper, I felt like I was getting turned around and lost in the area I had once perceived as small. The effect was made worse by a strange thumping sound I started to hear. It was distracting me from looking for the shopkeeper as it started to get louder and louder as I walked. Eventually it sounded like someone was beating a drum incessantly. I raced along trying to find the odd noises source. I had finally come to an area I had not been before; the noise was very loud and I figured it had to be originating here.

I stood in an odd section of the store with disturbing, almost occult like paraphernalia. An ornate little chest seemed to be pulsing with some sort of barely restrained energy and I realized the thumping sound seemed to emanate from the box. It did not look like it was physically moving enough to make such a racket, yet the sound pulsed in my head. It reminded me of how Matilda spoke directly into my mind and I feared that this object was also trying to communicate something to me.

I stepped closer and felt an odd sense of calm wash over me. Then almost all my apprehension about the box had vanished and I felt the overwhelming urge to open it and speak to the spirit it contained. If Matilda was friendly then why not?

I moved closer, compelled to open the box when a voice called out loudly,

“Please step away from the box sir!” I snapped back to my senses and a wave of dread washed over me as I looked at my hand just inches away from the ornate little chest. I suddenly realized it would be a terrible idea to open the box, which I had just noticed, had a palpable aura of discomforting energy radiating off of it.

I stepped back as instructed and pulled my gaze from the terrible chest. Looking back, I saw the shopkeeper. She addressed me again,

“You are welcome to purchase the Dybbuk box here, but I will have to insist you don’t open it on the premises. They are a dreadful mess to clean up if they hit an area with lots of foot traffic and people to attach to.” She chuckled and looked me up and down then a gleam of recognition appeared in her eyes and she spoke again,

“Oh you, you are the one that bought Matilda. That’s right, how it she doing? I hope you are not here to tell me that you want to give her back. The poor thing just wants a home, but too many people just can’t seem to handle the truth. Is that it? You can’t handle the truth!” I stepped back from the exclamation and then she burst into laughter and then continued,

“Oh, I’m sorry, I did not mean to startle you. It’s just a movie reference. You know, “A Few Good Men? Anyway, what can I do for you today.” I brushed off my earlier concern and decided to just ask her directly,

“No, I am not here to return her, but I did need to know. What is Matilda really?”

There was a brief pause and the shopkeeper's expression took on a bemused look. She considered her answer for a moment and then responded,

“Why Matilda is many things, a doll, a friend, a work of art.”

I was annoyed by the answer, she clearly knew what I meant but was choosing to be evasive.

“No, I mean what is she besides a doll. I know she has a doll body, but I have never seen any dolls do what she can do. Is she some sort of spirit? What does she really want? You must know, you must have heard stories of what she had done in her previous homes. She seems very comfortable killing those who lie about anything and everything. Please tell me.” She laughed again and responded,

“Oh yes, she does really hate liars. But who doesn't? I am guessing that you found out that about her firsthand?” She chuckled again and continued,

“But to answer your question. What she wants, if a friend. Simple as that. A true friend, one who won't lie to her, one who won't leave her like all those others did. The constant abandonment has been hard on her. I would keep her, but I have to watch the other one.” I saw her shift uncomfortably and her normal bright smile vanished briefly. I considered what she said about the other one, then I remembered another question I had.

“Who is Ruby?” I asked, almost anticipating the answer I received.

The shopkeeper looked concerned but decided to answer all the same.

“Ruby, is Matilda’s sister. You likely saw her when you bought Matilda. She is slightly more.....difficult, than her sister.” I saw her flinch and sniff the air, like she was smelling for something.

She looked back to me, lowered her voice considerably and said,

“Sorry, just making sure nothing is burning. Ruby has a, well let's just say a fiery temper. I may as well tell you, since you deserve to know as Matilda’s friend and keeper. The two arrived together as a pair three years ago. I used to try and keep them together and after selling them a few times, I had to stop since the results were....problematic.”

I asked her,

“What do you mean problematic?” She grinned again and said,

“Well to put it bluntly, they kept burning down people's houses and killing the people who were supposed to be keeping them.” I gasped at the admission, but she held up a hand to cut me off and she resumed,

“I know what you are thinking. No, I did not know it would happen, I just wanted to keep them together, but when they are together there is a problem. See Matilda is the calmer of the two, but she can read peoples thoughts. Ruby is more aggressive, but she does not know what people are lying. The problem is when they are together, then often the result would be Matilda telling her sister some secret that incenses her sister and then, well then things end up going down in flames, figuratively and literally. I end up having to retrieve them. Or they do what they often do and find their way back here.

I realized I had to separate them and try and let them be in the world apart and find new families. I thought maybe their worst aspects could be tempered by finding people that could give them what they need, while not letting them feed off of each other's worst impulses and continue killing.

Yet time and again they would come back, never just the right fit. Ruby has challenges but I will find the right home for her one day. But for Matilda, maybe I already have. You know she is a kind soul, don’t you? She might kill the liars, but she has a good heart. Just give her a chance.”

The shopkeeper held her hands together and looked almost pleadingly. Then she turned around and I thought I heard her mutter a colorful string of language,

“Oh no, I think Ruby heard her sister's name. She has been upset ever since I sold her. Even though it is for the best, Ruby gets angry when Matilda is sold, and she remains. You might want to leave, if she is angry, she...” The shopkeeper was cut off as a brilliant pyre of light and flame burst into being in the center of the store. The conflagration incinerated two rows of items and I stared in shocked silence at the shelf I had found the dolls just days ago. On it there sat the doll in the yellow dress with the crack on its face. Its red hair was brushed back away from the grimace of anger it wore on its face.

I did not know what I would do next as the voice spoke and the declaration was made clear,

“Hello, my name’s Ruby. You are going to bring me to my sister.”

I swallowed hard and knew I would not likely have the option to decline.
