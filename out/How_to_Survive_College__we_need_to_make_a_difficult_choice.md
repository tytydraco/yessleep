For once in my life I didn’t put [a difficult conversation](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1227rs1/how_to_survive_college_more_adventures_with/) off until later.  This one was kind of important and Grayson is a good friend.  Regardless of how he let it slip - whether it was deliberate or an accident - I didn’t want something bad to happen to him.  He deserved to know that the laundry lady might have reason to be really upset with him.

And as I’m typing this, I realized that I don’t know where Grayson is living right now.  He hasn’t said anything about it.  Students are required to live on campus through their sophomore year and while Grayson could have skipped that on account of being local, he was on campus last year.  But he’s also a year ahead of me so he’s a junior now and I don’t know if he’s gotten an apartment or moved back in with his dad or what.

Well.  He still needs to know to stay away from the dorm laundromats.  *Just in case*.

(if you’re new, [start here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/rnauck/how_to_survive_the_holidays/), and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/s75n1c/how_to_survive_college_index/))

We met at the student union, as so far that’s been the least haunted building on campus.  Sure, I encountered the swimmers there, but technically they were outside.  We found a quiet spot to talk and I explained the situation.  The laundry lady’s realm got destroyed and I think it was because the administration found out.  He knew about the laundry lady’s realm through me, as I’d asked him to hold the door open in the steam tunnels when I went after Sweater Girl.  And… I hesitated to say it.

“I didn’t tell my dad,” Grayson said quickly, sparing me the trouble of floundering my way through a half-hearted accusation.  “I didn’t tell anyone, actually.  They must have found out another way.  Did you tell anyone?”

Cassie, but only after the laundry lady was pissed off at me, so that would have been after she lost her realm.  In fact, I think everyone I knew found out about her only after that.  Sweater Girl could have blabbed, I suppose, but I got the feeling she wanted to talk about what happened as little as possible.

“What about Professor Beatrice?” I asked.  “She reformed the Rain Chasers, after all.  Maybe she knows more than we realize.”

“The folklore professor, huh?” Grayson said thoughtfully.  “Dad has had her over for dinner a couple times now.”

“Do you think she knows about the laundry thing or the other inhumans on campus?”

“I honestly don’t know.  She’s pretty new here.  The university only hired her a few years ago.”

“I should probably talk to her,” I said thoughtfully.  “See if she knows anything already.  Also, did I tell you I’m taking one of her classes next semester?”

“I hear her classes are actually heavy on projects,” Grayson warned me.  “It’s not the easy ‘A’ it looks like.”

“That’s fine.  Can’t be worse than math.  Speaking of which… I’ve got an appointment at the tutoring center I need to go to.”

We said goodbye and I headed out.  So either Grayson is lying to me (and I’m not sure he is, he might not have told me who his dad was, but he never outright lied about anything either) or someone else ratted the laundry lady out.  I want to find out who it is not just because they need to know they might be in danger, but also because it means that there’s someone else on this campus with as much - and possibly more - knowledge than me.

I kind of wonder if it’s the person that slipped that note under Daniel’s door.  The one telling him I could help with the worm problem.

But I had to do something about my math class before I could worry about anything else.  It’s getting close to the end of the semester - where does the time go, yikes - and I want to make sure I do well on the final.  I was doing fine for most of the semester and then I don’t know, after midterms it was just like - bam - I suck.  I’m not sure why.  I didn’t do badly last year.  I started behind, sure, but I caught up.  It honestly felt a little embarrassing to be going to the tutoring center again.  It felt like I’d failed somehow.  Like I should be able to handle this on my own.

It became so much worse when I opened the door and found *the actual devil* waiting for me.

“Please tell me you’re not a tutor here,” I hissed as he waved me over to a table.

“I’m not,” he replied smugly.  “I showed up just before you did and everyone knew better than to ask questions.”

I glanced around.  No one was paying him any particular attention, so perhaps by that he meant they simply thought he was supposed to be here rather than he did anything out of the ordinary to scare everyone into silence.

“Having trouble with math, huh?” he said, pulling my notes over to him and opening them up.

“I’m amazed you’re going through such direct effort in making sure I graduate.”

“I take my bargains *very seriously*.”

He frowned and then snapped my notebook shut, slapping it onto the table between us.

“You realize you’re not actually bad at math, right?” he demanded.

The thought has certainly crossed my mind, repeatedly, so I didn’t say anything at all.

“I swear on my name I will teach you self-confidence before you graduate,” he sighed dramatically, sliding down his chair and into a limp slouch.  “No bargains needed.  I need a win.  I can’t stand watching this.”

“So if I’m not bad at math then why am I failing all the practice exams?” I asked miserably.

“Because it hasn’t been explained in a way that works for you yet.”

He grinned smugly and then tossed my math book over his shoulder.  It landed heavily on the ground and mercifully, no one seemed to notice.  Then he went over the concepts I was struggling with, explaining them in a very different way than the professor had.  I guess being an ancient being able to read the desires of mortal hearts also means that the devil instinctively knows someone’s learning style.  Wild.

By the end of the hour I was getting a solid B on the practice exams.

“Lovely,” the devil said, holding up my last attempt.  “I’m going to pin this on the ass of some tortured soul down in hell.  We don’t have refrigerators there, you know.  Ruins the vibe.”

So that’s a mental image.  He folded it up and tucked it into his back pocket.  I honestly can’t tell if he was joking or not.  The devil is one of the ancient entities that can lie - and is even expected to - but *I can’t tell when he’s being serious.*

It’s stressing me the heck out, tbh.

“But as backup,” he said as he slid a sheet of paper over to me, “here’s the exam questions in advance with all their answers already filled out.  Memorize this just in case.”

“This… feels like cheating,” I said anxiously.

“Well obviously it is.”  He flashed me a broad smile.  “I’m the devil.  I cheat.  It’s my *thing*.  But seriously, still do all the practice questions, your next math class is going to be a continuation of these concepts and I don’t want to have to come back here next semester.”

Let me pause and say that I did all the practice questions and then I went through the exam questions to memorize them and about halfway through I felt like I’d been tricked, because I was finding I didn’t actually need to memorize them to know the answer.  I think I’m going to pass finals with an A, no cheating actually required.

However, this was a realization I came to later.  I felt pretty bad about myself when I left the tutoring center.  Not only was I struggling enough in this class to warrant the devil showing up to help, but he also thought I needed to cheat to get by.  Lost in thought like this, I failed to take notice of my surroundings as well as I normally do.  In my defense, it was a clear day with hardly any clouds, so it didn’t feel like anything could go wrong.

There were two students walking up ahead of me.  They didn’t seem to know each other, for they were walking a pace apart and minding their own business.  Then the one in the rear twisted as he walked, glancing back at me.  Unremarkable.  Except as he did so, our gazes locked.

He smiled.  Winked at me.

I slowed and stopped cold on the sidewalk.  I didn’t recognize him.  And then I realized that there was no one else around.  It was just me, him, and the other nearby student that was walking along oblivious to the person just behind him.

The student that winked turned his back to me.  He broke into a low jog, loping up silently behind the other student.  A prank, my brain idly supplied.  He was going to startle the other person.  They knew each other.  And the whole wink, that was just a ‘watch this’, nothing more.

Our minds try to explain situations faster than we can process what is *actually* happening.  It invents stories.  It fills in the gaps.

My brain was also horribly, terribly wrong.

The torso of the student split open.  Just peeled apart like a banana, four sections rolling back to reveal a maw lined with teeth.

I’d seen this before.  The worm.  That student was the worm’s new body.

The other student must have heard something, for he turned, and I saw his eyes go wide with horror for one brief moment and then the worm fell upon him.  He grabbed the students arms with his hands and lifted the man up, turned him upside down, and shoved him head-first into its maw.

The student didn’t even have time to scream.

His head and torso vanished and the worm’s body shuddered, the four sections of its mouth rippling in an attempt to force the rest of the man’s body down into its stomach.  He was still kicking, his legs protruding up to the sky and flailing wildly.

My mouth was dry.  My eyes darted back and forth, looking for something I could use as a weapon, maybe?  A branch?  But the worm’s gaze - for his very human features were still visible on that horrible flap of flesh that writhed and snaked around the student’s midsection - met mine.

It was smiling.  And there was some kind of intention in that gaze.

It *wanted* me to see this.  It wanted me to see it and know there wasn’t a damn thing I could do to stop it.

I wanted to throw up.

Then the flickering man came running out from between two buildings.

I almost didn’t recognize him.  He was sprinting, long legs carrying him across the grass and to the sidewalk, and his face was mottled red in pure rage.  He slammed into the worm, letting his momentum carry him into a full tackle that sent the worm flying and him rolling across the grass.  Then he was scrambling to his feet and before the worm could recover, the flickering man had grabbed hold of its victim’s ankles.

“NOPE,” the flickering man bellowed, standing over the other inhuman.  “NOT ALLOWED.”

And he pulled the student clear out of the worm’s mouth.

He tossed the man aside and the poor guy hit the pavement and rolled a few feet.  I stared at him as he staggered to his feet, shaken, covered in sticky saliva.  Dimly, I thought that I should go to him, ask if he was okay, but instead I just… watched.

The flickering man enforces the rules.  And if the worm wasn’t supposed to be here, then the flickering man wasn’t going to let him eat anyone.  The relief I felt left me weak in the knees.

The student didn’t seem to notice me staring at him.  He took one glance back at the worm, on its hands and knees, the upper half of its body sealing back up like a ziploc bag, and he screamed and ran.

I’m a little jealous, ngl.  That’s a better panic reaction than freezing.

The flickering man just stood there, waiting while the worm picked itself up.  The worm glanced at him sullenly as he did, then his gaze slid to watch the fleeing student, naked hunger in his stare.

“You robbed me of a meal,” the worm said.

It sounded… normal.  Just like any other person.  My skin crawled though and I shivered.  I could run too, I thought.  Or… I could just stand there like an idiot with my teeth chattering from shaking because the rational part of my brain wasn’t able to connect with any of my muscles.

“You don’t belong here,” the flickering man snapped, jabbing a finger into the chest of the worm.  “You belong in your corridor.  Everything has a place.  That’s how this works.”

“But doesn’t that get *boring*?” the worm hissed in reply, seemingly unbothered by the other inhuman’s anger.  “We are surrounded by ambition, don’t you want a little taste of it?”

“There are *rules*.”

“*Their* rules.”  The worm rolled his eyes.  “We don’t *have* to follow them.  You’re the only one too scared to-”

“I will *end* you,” the flickering man hissed.

The worm rolled his gaze up towards the hazy sky and smiled lazily.

“Sure,” he said.  “Go on and try.”

The worm turned abruptly, putting his back carelessly to the flickering man.  He strolled away as if he didn’t have a care in the world, raising one hand to wave goodbye.  After a half second his fingers curled downwards, leaving only the middle finger raised.  I peered nervously at the flickering man’s face.

Oh yeah.  He mad.

His lips were peeled back into a snarl and a thick ridge had formed in his furrowed brow.  His eyes seethed with impotent rage.  Then he noticed me watching him and whirled.

“YOU!” he howled.  “Of *course* I’d find you here!  What do you know about this!?”

He waved broadly at the worm-student walking off down the sidewalk.

“I-why-there-” I stammered, trying to find the right way to deny any involvement with this.

He stalked over and grabbed the front of my shirt and pulled me closer.  I stared up at his face, twisted with tight fury.

“You *have* to be involved,” he hissed.  “You’re in league with the devil.  You’re a meddler, just like him.”

I didn’t really say anything coherent.  The flickering man gave an angry huff and tore his gaze off of me.  He stared at the direction the worm had gone, his gaze narrowed with malicious calculation.

“Who was it after?” he demanded.  “I need to go have a… *conversation*… with them about fixing this situation.”

The rule was still in place and the flickering man actually follows the rules - well, mostly.  He wouldn't kill the worm.  Daniel had to be the one to do it.  And the flickering man was going to get involved to make sure that happened.

But of course I didn’t do anything sensible at that moment.  This wasn’t over.  It wouldn’t be over until Daniel actually did what he was supposed to and now the flickering man was involved but he was a mad at *me* and that wasn’t *right*\-

I started crying.

“I don’t have *time* for this,” the flickering man hissed.

He released me, and by that I mean he shoved me hard enough to almost knock me over.

“If you do find out who that worm was going after,” he said coldly, “go stand by that statue installation thing outside the administration building.  The one that’s vaguely phallic.  I’ll show up.  No tricks, no threats, no violence, and I’ll even try to be polite.  I just need a name.”

Then he stalked off in the direction the worm had gone, hopefully to dog the worm’s every move and make sure it didn’t eat anyone else.  I stood there, sniveling for a good few minutes more, and then hastily dug out the tissues I keep in my backpack before anyone else came along and found me crying on the sidewalk like an idiot.

Yeah I keep tissues on hand at all times now, I seem to cry a lot.

At least the rest of the walk to my dorm gave me time to sort out what had happened.  I have to admit - my immediate feeling was of relief.  The flickering man had given me a way out of all of this.  Daniel wasn’t my problem anymore and neither was his mistake.  He was going to be the business of someone that was vastly more qualified to handle him than I was and if he didn’t like that, well, he had plenty of opportunities before now.  He didn’t want to work with Maria and I so now he has to work with the flickering man.  Karma is a bitch, isn’t it?

But also… the laundry lady and I were trying to destroy the flickering man.  We weren’t making much progress by my estimation.  If this situation went on too long, if it attracted the notice of whoever was above him, then wouldn’t that be bad for the flickering man?  Wouldn’t my refusal to help him out of this predicament make him desperate?

Possibly angry enough to break the rules?  Maybe even desperate enough to take a crack at the worm himself if he couldn’t find Daniel?

It hasn’t escaped my notice either that the flickering man is actively saving students while the laundry lady is merely salty that she can’t keep killing people on a whim.  I… might have picked the wrong side here.

It’s too late now.  I have to keep going forward with the situation I’ve been given.  Yes, Daniel doesn’t deserve my help.  And I’m sure there’s going to be plenty of people yelling for his head here.  But you know what?  I’m the one that knows him in person.  I’m the one who has to live with whatever happens.  So I’m going to talk to someone who also knows him in person and is someone I trust and those of you rooting for Daniel to get what he deserves or whatever will just have to wait.

I messaged Maria as soon as I got back to my dorm and told her we needed to talk.  In person.  About Daniel.

‘I am so fucking done with him,’ she replied.

‘Mood, but we might have a way to fix the whole worm being loose problem.’

Maria didn’t reply for about eight minutes.  Yes, I checked how long it was.  Felt like an eternity.

‘Okay we’ll talk tomorrow please don’t do anything before then.’

By ‘do anything’ she means ‘contact Daniel yourself.’  I know Maria well enough by now to read between the lines.  Both her and Cassie are willing to trust my expertise with the inhuman, but when it comes to human relations I think they both feel I need a little oversight.

You have one horrible boyfriend and no one lets you forget.

Well.  Okay.  Two.  Steven was a mistake too.

Then there was the whole thing where I idolized Patricia for like a week.

They might have a point.

But we’re going to talk it through and figure out what to do.  And in the meantime, I’m going to sit here and envision the flickering man, sullenly following the worm around to keep it from eating anyone while staring despondently at the clear blue sky.  I hope he hates every minute of it.[\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)
