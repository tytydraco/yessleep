 Once upon a time, there was a small village in the heart of a dense forest. The villagers lived a simple life, farming the land, hunting in the forest and trading with other nearby villages. They were happy and content with their way of life, and their village had been a peaceful place for as long as anyone could remember.

One day, a strange traveler came to the village. He was tall and thin, with long white hair and piercing green eyes. He wore a hooded cloak that obscured his face, and he carried a large satchel with him. The villagers were wary of this stranger, as they had never seen anyone like him before. However, he seemed friendly enough, and he asked to stay the night in the village inn.

The innkeeper, a kind-hearted man named John, agreed to let the stranger stay, and he asked him about his travels. The stranger replied that he was a scholar, searching for knowledge about the ancient ruins that dotted the forest. He said that he had heard that the villagers had a wealth of knowledge about these ruins, and he hoped to learn more from them.

John was intrigued by the stranger's quest, and he offered to show him around the village and introduce him to some of the older residents who might be able to help. The stranger agreed, and he spent the next few days talking to the villagers and learning about the ruins. He was especially interested in a large, mysterious structure that lay deep within the forest.

The villagers warned the stranger about the dangers of the forest, but he was determined to explore the ruins, and he set out into the forest alone. Days passed, and the stranger did not return. The villagers grew worried and decided to search for him. They found his satchel lying on the ground, but there was no sign of the stranger.

A few days later, the villagers received a strange message from the stranger. It was written in a strange language that none of them could understand, but it seemed to be a warning of some kind. They were afraid and decided to send for help. They sent a messenger to a nearby town, asking for a scholar who could decipher the message.

A young scholar named Marcus arrived in the village a few weeks later. He was an expert in ancient languages and was eager to help. When he saw the message, he was shocked. He recognized the language as one that was thought to be long dead, and he realized that the stranger was in grave danger.

Marcus immediately set out into the forest, following the path that the stranger had taken. He traveled for days, avoiding the many dangers of the forest, until he finally reached the mysterious ruin. He climbed the crumbling stairs, and as he reached the top, he saw the stranger standing in front of a large stone doorway.

The stranger was chanting in the ancient language, and as Marcus approached, he saw that the doorway was opening. Suddenly, the stranger turned and pointed a finger at Marcus, and a bright light shot from his hand. Marcus was frozen, unable to move as the light enveloped him.

When the light faded, Marcus found himself standing in a large chamber, surrounded by ancient artifacts and strange symbols. The stranger was gone, but in his place stood a being of immense power. It was a demon, summoned from the underworld by the stranger's incantations.

The demon spoke to Marcus, telling him of a terrible fate that was to befall the world. It said that the stranger was a powerful sorcerer, who had come to the village to gather the knowledge he needed to summon the demon and bring about the end of the world. The demon told Marcus that he was the only one who could stop the sorcerer and save
