I make sneakers for a living. Or rather, handmade customized kicks for the rich and famous. The kind that gets worn to exclusive red-carpet events only once before spending the rest of their days at the back of some celebrity's walk-in dresser. I get paid a small fortune regardless, so I can hardly complain, but that all changed a few months ago when I got a request that ended up changing my life for the worst.

The business I run is invite or referral only, which is fairly common for the lifestyle niche I'm in. Celebrities love exclusivity and wouldn't be caught dead wearing a pair of kicks any old shmuck could pick off the shelves at Foot Locker, unless there was some kind of multi-million sponsorship deal attached.

Normally their agent reaches out to me, or knows someone, who knows someone, whose worked with me in the past. I rarely, if ever, hear from the celeb directly, which suits me just fine. My assistant, Maya, picks up their enquiry, I reach out to their rep to get more details, do a bit of background research to figure out their tastes and try to inject some of their (usually paper-thin) personality into their sneakers before sketching them out.

These concept sketches usually go through several iterations with the client and can take weeks in between all the other showbiz shit they've usually got going on, before I finally get the green light to make the end product. Maya then pays the star a visit to get their measurements (her favourite part of the job), then I start making the sneakers by hand (my favourite part of the job), in my workshop with whatever bat shit crazy material this up-and-comer thinks they can pull off.

From start to finish the whole process usually takes between three to six months but can be expedited, for a premium, if they urgently need them for some upcoming event.

The gig I wish I'd never taken came via referral from a regular of mine. Picture a Silicon Valley type, late 40s but still dresses like they're in their 20s and you'll be most of the way there. He said an 'angel investor' had swooped in last minute to give his tech startup a much-needed shot in the arm, and he wanted to gift them a pair of custom sneakers after they complimented his own. Given I'd made five figures from this guy’s sneaker orders alone over the years, I figured I'd do him a solid and figured he'd be the one footing the bill rather than the end client.

Little did I know the end client was the one I should have been worried about. At the time, the only info I learnt about them came thirdhand, from Mister Silicon Valley. He said the client was the son of some Middle Eastern sheik and they'd be needing the sneakers for an upcoming event in LA where they'd be a keynote speaker, and that he'd passed on my number so they could reach out over WhatsApp.

Two days later I get a message to my business account from someone with the handle 'SamAe1' who confirms the event is in June and he's after customised bright white, high-top style kicks but 'with a twist'.

I remember rolling my eyes after reading that last part, because as much as the rich and famous love to think they're individual and edgy, I'd pretty much seen and heard it all by now. Everything from requesting 3D printed slip-ons, to mixing blood into the dyes for a 'deep' red finish. In hindsight, SamAe1 would go on to knock the latter out of the park.

It started off small, at first. In his initial design memo he suggested swapping the laces for high-tension braided steel cable. So I said fine, but we'd have to reinforce the eyelets as a result. In the next memo he then revealed he wanted a split toe design instead, which I thought was odd as they're only really used for parkour or niche athletic shoes. But whatever, I rolled with it and added those into the next batch of concept sketches.

He then spent the following week fixating on the design of the sneaker tread, which even for my type of clientele was kind of absurd considering it would most likely never be seen—unless you’re walking on glass flooring. He was adamant he wanted this weird hand symbol moulded into the base of the tread and even sent me a picture of it, which looked to be lifted from some kind of textbook.

Fearing copyright infringement, I tried Google reverse image searching it in case it was some kind of logo but it drew a blank. So I shrugged it off, finalized the design and sent it off for SamAe1 to approve.

Barely an hour later they gave me a literal thumbs up and then it was over to Maya to arrange for a face-to-face visit to get exact measurements. Needless to say, she wasn’t quite as buzzed about this appointment as it wasn’t some film star she could gush about to her friends after, but she was a pro and booked to meet them at Mister Silicon Valley’s offices the following week—when they were supposedly flying in to check in on their investment.

The day arrived, and as always, Maya set off early in the morning to make sure she was on time. I didn’t hear from her for most of the day and didn’t think much of it until she got back that evening and I realized the time. It was gone eight, and she should have been back hours ago, carrying her usual Frappuccino and talking at me at a billion miles an hour.

Instead, she quietly slipped in through the door, empty-handed and looking downright harrowed—as if she’d just took a trip round Alcatraz instead of to some open-plan office space. I made her a coffee and sat her down, spotting grey hairs in her scalp I’d never seen before.

Fearing the worst, I sat opposite her and asked, “Did he touch you? Do you want me to call the cops?”

She seemed to snap awake then and blurted, “No! Please, don’t—don’t do that.”

“Did he harass you?”

“No, nothing like that.”

“Then what happened?”

She shuddered before explaining Mister Silicon Valley had led her to a breakout room down the hall before knocking on the door and leaving her to it. Thinking nothing of it, she stepped inside to find the room dark, with the only light peeking through the gaps in the closed blinds. Maya had turned around then, thinking she’d got the wrong room before a voice in the far corner apologized, saying they had a terrible migraine and had closed the blinds—and asked if she minded.

Having dealt with hungover clients before, and figuring she’d only be a few minutes, Maya had said no, it was fine. She’d then got out her Brannock Device (i.e. the blocky thing you get your shoes measured with) from her rucksack, cranked open the blinds just enough to work by and crouched down by his feet to find he’d already kicked his shoes off.

As her eyes adjusted to the gloom she made out more of the man in the corner. He wore dark jeans, blazer and a red baseball cap tilted low, hiding his face. She said he’d smelt of oud, but not in a pleasant way—more like a burnt smell than anything else. He wore plain black socks and his feet felt heavy and strange as she’d positioned them inside the measuring tool.

“Strange in what way?” I asked.

“I dunno, misshapen maybe—like he had some kind of deformity in his toes.”

“Do you think that’s why he left the light off?”

“No…he wasn’t self-conscious. I could feel him smiling.”

I felt creeped out by that. “Smiling?”

“Yes, beneath his cap, I could feel his smile.”

“Maya, if he assaulted you or made you feel uncomfortable in anyway you need to tell me.”

“He didn’t touch me, at least not in that way. He just let me measure him and whispered things.”

“Like what?”

“I dunno. He seemed to know things I'd never told anyone. Things I’d completely forgotten about…until now.”

She leant forward in the chair, hugging herself.

“Do you want to talk about it?”

“No.”

“Are you okay? Do you need to take some time off?”

“No, I think its best I go.”

“Okay, sure, go home and get some rest.”

She didn’t come back the next day, or the day after that. In fact, that was the last time I saw Maya. I phoned her mom shortly after and she said she’d moved back east to live with them for a bit. I asked if she was okay, and she explained she just needed space and was considering a different career path.

Obviously that news shocked me, as Maya had worked for me ever since she’d interned with me five years ago. As far as I knew she lived and breathed the lifestyle and fashion industry so for her to just up and leave over that creep…well, it scared me.

I reached out to a temporary staffing agency to get an infill assistant in the hopes Maya would change her mind, and tried to grill Mister Silicon Valley on exactly who ‘SamAe1’ was. However, he kept dodging my calls and ignoring my messages so one night I drove out to the club he virtually lived at and collared him outside. It didn’t take long for his drunk-ass to spill the beans.

Turns out he was up to his ears in gambling debts to the wrong people and ‘SamAe1’ had slid into his DMs out of the blue offering to bail him out. When he asked if he wanted shares in his start up as leverage, he turned him down claiming he ‘invested in people instead of businesses.’ Mister Silicon Valley broke down in tears then as he admitted he didn’t have a clue who his ‘angel investor’ really was, but figured if he hung out in the circles he thought he did then I should probably make those sneakers of his ASAP.

“Are you kidding me?”

“I’m sorry…”

“Screw you!” I shouted, cutting ties with his sketchy ass right there and then.

Fuming, I went back to my workshop the next day and used the measurements Maya had left me to make SamAe1’s sneakers. I boxed them up that evening and my temporary assistant mailed them first thing the following morning.

Hoping that was the end of it, I carried on with my other live orders until the temp interrupted me a few days later to say the sneakers had been returned with a note. Thinking there’d been some kind of mix up, I’d snatched the piece of paper from them and squinted at the jagged scribble.

“Try again,” it read, “These are too comfortable. Feels like I’m floating in the clouds.”

I scrunched up the note and threw it on the floor in disbelief. I’d never got a returned shoe before. Not once in the literal hundreds of orders I’d done. And what kind of a Goldilocks complaint was ‘too comfortable’ anyway?

Deciding to send the temp home before I took it out on them, I busted open SamAe1’s sneakers and started to tear up the cushioned soles. As I’d glued the bastards down, I knew how much of a nightmare it was going to be to strip off the last of the adhesive, and it wasn’t long before the bottle of vodka I kept in my desk wound its way into my hand.

Normally I only cracked it out for celebrations, but tonight wasn’t one of those. Whether it was because of the stressful week, or the whole situation with Maya, I ended up drowning my sorrows before passing out on the couch.

The temp woke me up the next morning looking like they were starting to regret being my new assistant. Before I had chance to apologize, a car-crash of a drunken memory t-boned my brain, reminding me of what I’d done to SamAe1’s shoes last night. After polishing off the last of the vodka and accidentally knocking the bottle off the desk, I’d ended up hysterically pouring the broken shards into his sneakers.

“There you are, you fucker!” I remembered saying, as I boxed the shoes back up, “Not too comfortable now, are they?”

Head pounding, I looked around for the shoe box, hoping it was all a bad dream.

“Do you need a coffee?” The temp asked.

“What time is it?”

“Just gone ten.”

“Oh shit,” I groaned, realizing how late it was and how much I needed to find those stupid sneakers.

“Don’t worry,” the temp said, “If you’re looking for the shoes, I already sent them off this morning. Figured if you’d spent the night fixing them, the least I could do was mail them first thing.”

“You what!?”

My stomach felt like it fell through my ass in that moment. Even hungover, I knew how badly I’d fucked up. I checked the tracking link but saw the parcel was already winging its way to the PO box SamAe1 had setup. Realizing I was too late, I messaged him on WhatsApp to say there had been a terrible mix-up and that we’d ended up mailing scrapped shoes instead of the fixed ones, and to please not try on the pair about to be delivered today. He read the message but I got no response.

I spent the rest of that day with my stomach on the floor, figuring he was either about to sue me, or bite my head off over the phone. Neither happened. Instead, I was sitting at home trying my best to zone out to Netflix when my phone pinged saying the workshop CCTV had been triggered.

Freaked out, I loaded my camera app and rewound it to find static. I pressed the live feed and saw all the doors were wide open and what looked like footprints on the ground, leading straight to my office.

Terrified, I started to dial 911 before stopping myself. I knew if I got the cops involved it would only escalate the situation. SamAe1 was clearly connected, Mister Silicon Valley had pretty much confirmed that. I’d insulted them with the glass in the shoes, and they’d retaliated by trashing my office. An eye for an eye.

Trying to find some kind of solace in that thought, I double bolted my front door but couldn’t muster up the courage to drive to the office until the next morning. Thankfully it was a weekend so the temp wasn’t expected in, so I knew I at least had a few days to tidy up whatever mess SamAe1 had made.

However, I got to the workshop to find it hadn’t been ransacked after all. Yes, the front door was open, but it hadn’t been forced. The lock had either been picked or the key cloned. Weirder still were the footprints I’d spotted on the CCTV feed last night.

The tread matched SamAe1’s sneakers, right down to the hand shape I’d moulded into them but the footprints were a reddish black. It took me a moment to realize it was dried blood.

Scared, I called out, “Hello, is anyone there?”

My voice echoed but no one replied. Taking comfort that the CCTV hadn’t been triggered again since last night, I followed the trail of footprints into my office to find a duffel bag on my desk. It was black and had a red ribbon wrapped around the handles, with a gift tag attached.

Curious, I leant over to read it.

“Perfect! XO,” it said.

I noticed the bag was partly unzipped and peeked inside to find the face of Ulysses S. Grant peering back at me from a crisp stack of $50 bills. In disbelief, I unzipped the duffel a little further to see the bag was full of cash—apparent payment for a job well done.

“Holy shit,” I muttered.

It wasn’t until I locked the office and started counting the bills that I noticed a message hidden at the bottom of the bag. I’ve worked with enough leather to know it was written on rawhide and I recognized the handwriting as the same that’d been on the return note the other day.

The words listed out an address which I recognized as an old factory outside the city, where I’d been to a rave once. It looked to be some kind of invite, and on the reverse of the animal skin I found the same hand symbol SamAe1 had made me mould into his now bloodied shoes.

That had been a week ago now and the event is in a few days. I’m terrified—should I not go and risk his wrath, or should I turn up as a show of faith and thank him for the fat stacks of cash he just gave me? What if he fucks me up in the head like he did with Maya, or asks me to make a whole clothing range to match his sadistic sneakers?

I’m literally damned if I do, damned if I don’t…

My assistant is scarred for life, my business and livelihood is in jeopardy and I’m terrified to go back into the office again in case ‘he’ comes back.

I should have realised sooner, but I can see it all now. The split toe/’hoof’ design, the hand on the bottom of the shoe saluting down to hell. If those hadn't given it away then the moniker Samael definitely should have.

God help me, I think I’ve just made sneakers for Satan.
