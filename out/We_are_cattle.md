 It was within the first few nights I'd moved into my dorm. I's layin in bed, starin at the ceiling. My TV was on, and I was trying to get some sleep when it came melting out the ceiling.

It was made from every shade of white to black. It looked deeply intrigued as it melted through my ceiling and lingered above me.

"What.. The fuck." I sorta yelped, scooting back. "Relax. Relax!" The thing said, in a raspy growl.

"Im not going to hurt you." It lowered closer to my face. "I'm just here to tell you what we are." I didn't understand, at the time.

"I'm from some where else. A existence far from your own, in a far away land. But it seems were all off track. Seeped into your dimension. Oopsie, right? Ya. Infinitedimensions! Crazy, I know. Well yours is real easy to get mixed up in." It chuckled. I didn't.

He became a nightly visitor. His name was Barle.. I wont tell you how he proved it was all real and I wasn't just a schizophrenic.

In the following years, I became desensitized. I watched em linger about. They were creatures unlike Barle. They killed people. In every single way possible, in every form possible. They were just always there. There all around me and their all around you. Some of em stalk their prey for a while and some are rapidly killing all the time.

One of the first times I'd seen it was in a mall food court, a little girl was sitting on a chair across from me shoving her mouth with a corn dog while her mom was jabbering to one of her friends. It loomed over her, it was otherworldly. It was not confined to the 3 dimensions, it moved further than forward, backward, up and down. It was made from colors I'd never seen, as it leaned over and bit into the girls little skull.

It didn't puncture her skin, but she rather began hacking and gagging. She held her skirt tight in her palms as her mom tried desperately to launch the chunk of food out of her throat to no avail. That girl died that day as did many others after that by the hands of others.

But I began to wonder why so many were predatory, if there was infinite dimensions why were ours and Barles the only ones that weren't built from everything nightmareish?

I began to fall into a deep depression. I married. Got pregnant. Lived pretty normally but always wondered why? Well. I know now.

I'd had a doctors visit to check up on the baby that day and everything was goin fine. I's talking to the doctor when time and space seperated in the corner and out crawled the things if nightmares.

It's body was thick and bloated, little warts scattered across it's skin. Its mouth was open and starved, drool spilling out onto it's fat chin. It held its hand out and I stared in utter horror.

None of them had ever come close to me, but this one did. For a mere seconds, I prayed it would go for my doctor. It couldn't be my time? Could it? It outstretched it's hands to my face and I held my breath.

"Everything alright?" Dr. Harley glanced over at my pale face. She can't see it and I knew that, but I wanted her to. I wanted to know I wasnt crazy.

It's crabby hands lowered from my face to my stomach. It grasped my belly in its palm, squeezing tightly.

I felt tears well up in my eyes. It began to retreat, the little portal from which it came closing.

Dr. Harley informed me of my babies state. It was gone and so was I, I was ready for it to be over. I trudged to my car barely stable and practically fell into my drivers seat, hot tears wetting my face.

Barle dropped out of the ceiling into the passanger seat, a morbid little blob of face. "It's time I tell ya the truth." He sighed. I rested my head on the steering wheel letting out little whimpers.

"We aren't exactly here on accident, you see." He said, empathicly. "See.. Of these guys you see aren't really compitent like you and I. Their like an animal, yknow. They just need to eat." I raised my head. "And so, they pay people like me well to get access to your dimensions. To fill that hunger quick and easy and not have to kill each other for food." He said, gooping around in my seat.

I felt anger bubble up, the realization hitting me that all this time I've just been cattle. I hollered at Barle for some time, feeling betrayed. He was my only help through all this, and turns out he was the one making all this happen. I didn't understand why I had this connection to the other dimensions, why could I see? Why was this happening to me?

Fueled by anger and crushed, I tried something I'd never once dared. I scooped Barle up in my arms and bit into him. "How does it feel?" I sobbed. Black goo oozed out of him as he cried and pleaded.

"How does it feel being the prey?" I chucked him back into the passengers seat. In a storm of rage, I began hitting my steering wheel before going limp and just sobbing.

When I regained my composure, Barle was deflated in his seat, lifeless.

I trudged into my house, sighing. I knew it wasn't over. And killing Barle did nothing. I knew that when I saw one of those wretched creatures standing over my convulsing husband.
