Apologies for bad English.

My story- if you can call it that- starts on a typical day in a typical big city. I will specify that this story takes place in Switzerland, since a number of people tend to assume stories on this sub take place in the US. 

I am just an ordinary person. I manage a  furniture store. I make about 70k (in francs) a year, and I live with my two cats in our house. I am possibly the least interesting person I know. So I cannot understand why it chose me. Why me, and not another? 

On this day, I was walking down the high street, coming home from work. It was a day just like any other. I was thinking about whether I wanted to cook dinner or go out for a change, thinking about rude customers at work that day, thinking how lovely the sunset was. Thinking all the things anyone thinks when they are on their way home from work.

And that's when I saw the... That. 

It was on a street corner, performing flips for a small crowd. At first, I thought it was an ordinary street performer. Unusual, but not too uncommon.
It was androgynous and dressed in bright clothes- which isn't unusual, as we have a vibrant queer scene in my area- and looked more or less human. But as I gave it more than a cursory glance, I realized something was... Very off.

The way it moved and flipped wasn't quite right. It looked like someone had tried to 3D animate a person, and while they'd captured the features very well, they couldn't quite animate the movement correctly. 

Its limbs swung and flopped as it moved, in a bizarre way that I couldn't quite put my finger on. Its joints all seemed to be able to twist just a bit too far. The acrobatic display was beautiful, of course, but only if you didn't pay close attention. Most people didn't, preferring to record with their phones and focus on the flashy costume and breathtaking stunts rather than noticing that its joints were bending in impossible ways. 

At first, I dismissed it as the performer merely being hyperflexible. And then it ended its performance and took a bow, beaming at the audience. 

Its face was wrong. 

Its eyes were too bright, and they moved too quickly. As it smiled, its face moved in an unnatural way. Its skin seemed too smooth and too matte. Its hair almost seemed delayed, moving a half second after it moved its head. Its lips were too pink. Most people in the crowd didn't notice a thing. But I did. 

I was extremely confused. I began to think that the performer was some kind of new robot, probably dreamed up by the students at the university. But it seemed too human for that. And yet it didn't seem human enough. 

Its skin seemed very synthetic. Like... latex, with a powder coating, almost.

I stood there, unsettled. But as I turned to leave, the... That. Waved at me. 

The movement was awkward. Instead of just waving, it moved its entire arm in a sort of sweeping motion. It grinned. 

I quickly walked away. I was creeped out, and I wanted nothing to do with the... That. 

I walked a good few blocks, and was almost to my house, trying to put the... That, out of my mind. I walked up the driveway, taking out my keys, and then I heard the gravel crunching behind me.

Ice shot up my spine as I immediately straightened up. It would be nothing. I would turn, and it would be someone walking past with their dog. Or a squirrel running by. Or just the wind. It would be nothing. 

I turned and made direct eye contact with... That.

It stood maybe five meters away, arms hanging loosely by its sides. Now that it was closer, I could see even more things wrong with it. It's neck and arms were too long for it's body. It was the pale grey-white of someone who is horribly ill. And it's entire face gave off a sense of dull, robotic thoughtlessness. 

Except for those eyes. 

That... creature, its eyes were bright, blazing blue. They held a deep, multifaceted, incomprehensible intelligence that existed far beyond the intelligence of anything on Earth- man or machine. That look seemed to say 'I know everything about who and what you are.' It filled me with an immeasurable sense of terror. Fear, like I had never experienced it. 

And then it grinned. 

I ran for my front door. It watched me go. I didn't stop running until I was inside. I frantically locked the door, locked the windows, drew the shades. My cats meowed questioningly. I pet them nervously. 

The next time I peeked out of the window, it was standing there by my front door. Just staring. And smiling. 

That was three days ago. I haven't left my house since. I told my boss I have pneumonia. But I'm going to have to go grocery shopping within the next week. And I can't stay inside forever.

It's still out there. It moves from time to time. Staring at the sky. Or walking around the house. But it always follows me. Whenever I open a curtain to look out, it's always outside that window. Always. That. That is always there. Staring. And smiling. 

What do I do?
