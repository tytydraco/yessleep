Well, I guess the title is misleading. It's not my house anymore, I moved out as soon as my minimum wage job at Wendy's made me enough money. Whenever anyone asks me why I gave up my family estate on an acreage to live in a shitty 1 bedroom, 400-square-foot apartment, I just say I wanted independence. But that's not the real reason. 

My childhood home is...weird. I don't even know if I could call it haunted, it's not like there were doors slamming shut or disembodied footsteps. A haunting isn't the word for it. But it wasn't normal. 

Growing up, I lived with my mom, my dad, and my little sister Jenna. Well, those were all the humans living in it. 

The earliest odd experiences I remember, I was around 8, and Jenna had just started to talk. I would be playing with her in her crib as mom was making dinner, yet she'd always be looking right behind me. She'd point and giggle. "Dada!" She said. 

"No, dada's at work." I reminded her. "Dada is coming home at dinner." 

She still pointed. "Dada." The thought crossed my mind, grown-ups always told me I looked exactly like my dad, maybe Jenna just thought I was dad for some reason. But then I realized, she wasn't pointing at me. She was pointing behind me. 

The upstairs hallway, where our bedrooms were, had always creeped me out. Not for any particular reason, it was just always darker than it should've been. Whenever I was called down for dinner, or woke up at night to go pee, I always tried to run through the hallway as fast as I could. Jenna was pointing at her open nursery door, leading into the hallway. I froze. Slowly, I turned around. 

And for a split second, I saw him. It was my dad. Same work clothes he always wore, same haircut, even the same stance. But it wasn't dad. His eyes didn't have the same kindness as dad's did. He was just staring at us, menacingly. But as soon as I saw it, it was gone. Like it was never there. 

Oftentimes, at night, I'd hear Jenna awake in the middle of the night, giggling about dada, or mama, or, most disturbing, "Addy." Adam's my name, and before she could talk, she'd call me Addy. But I was in bed. Who, or what, was playing with my little sister?

If it was just that, I wouldn't care much. Kids see and say strange things. But it didn't end there. Sometimes it was small. Maybe mom would have insisted Jenna or I had been calling for her, when we were both silent. Maybe Jenna had accused me of breaking her Barbie dolls, swearing she saw me enter her room. But there were some things, big things, that chill me to this day. 

It was late at night, I was 14 and Jenna was around 6. Mom and dad were out for the night, and I was in charge of babysitting her. It had gone fine, but around 9 PM, when I was pretty sure I had tucked Jenna in to sleep, I saw her. 

We had a big backyard, and a glass door to get on to the back porch. Jenna liked to jump rope or draw with chalk on the porch, and there she was, just standing out there. I was mad she had snuck out of bed, but more importantly I was worried mom and dad would be upset with me, as it was cold and raining. 

"Jenna, get inside." I ordered, in my best tough guy voice. She just stood there. "Jenna!" I said, louder this time. "For God's sake, are you just gonna stand there? Get your ass inside!" I yelled, putting my hand on the door handle. I was ready to drag this girl bad into her room by her hair if she didn't-

"Adam?" I heard from behind me. I saw in the reflection of the glass. It was Jenna, still in her pyjamas, looking groggy. I turned around to face her.

"What are you doing? Who is that?" I could see in her face the moment it registered what she was looking at- herself. She screamed, and I hoped she couldn't see it in me, but I was scared, too. 

When I turned back around to the glass door, the other Jenna was even closer to me. I noticed my hand was still on the door handle, and I quickly jumped away from it, as my sister ran to hide behind me. 

We just stared at the thing outside, both frozen in horror. Suddenly, it started screaming. 

"Adam? What are you doing? Who is that?" It said. It was mimicking my sister, but it just sounded so...warped. Like a record that was melting in a house fire. As it spoke, it's mouth opened in a way no human could. 

At this point I had given up trying to be brave in front of Jenna. We were both screaming and in tears. The thing outside started banging on the glass, so hard I was scared it would break. It just kept repeating those same phrases, so loud my ears started hurting. Jenna and eventually just curled up together, sobbing. 

I'm not sure when it stopped. All I know is I woke up on the floor as my parents were frantically trying to get Jenna and I up. We tried to tell them what happened. 

At this point, I think they knew something was up with this house. There had been a few times I had noticed them frazzled when they saw me, swearing I had been someone else. I think they just wanted to come off as rational adults, but I knew deep down they were scared, too. 

It's not like they didn't try to be rational. They got our house tested for gas leaks. Stripped the walls looking for black mold. Took us all to a therapist. There was just no rationalizing whatever lived in the house with us. 

As I grew into a teenager, I really tried to get to the bottom of whatever was happening to us. I searched for hours to find a priest or a paranormal investigator or literally anyone in my area that would charge less than $300. I eventually found one, an old, short Catholic priest who barely spoke any English. He had just moved from Mexico and said he would bless our home for free as long as we brought our friends to his new church every Sunday. 

Mom and dad looked at me funny when I told them what I had done, but they didn't protest. Maybe deep down they were looking forward to it. 

I met him, Father Arturo, outside of our home. He greeted me warmly. I noticed he had holy water in his bag, which made me a bit nervous. 

When he got inside our house, though, his demeaner changed almost completely. On the walk in, he was kind, gentle, like a grandpa. He became frantic when he entered; I could see sweat on his brow as his hands shook. 

He quickly started whispering a prayer in Spanish under his breath, shaking his head. I saw him reaching for the door again.

"Wait, Father Arturo!" I said. "Come back, what's going on?"

He took my hand and looked at me with pure desperation. What he said next, I think about at least once a day. 

"It wants to replace you." 

Me, Jenna, and a few of my friends did go to his church after that as promised, but he never spoke to us much. 

I tried to lay low the next couple years. I worked as much as I could, partially to make money, partially to spend time out of the house. I tried to ignore anything, or anyone, I saw in the house. I made Jenna remember a code word so I always knew it was her. Eventually, I got enough money to move out, which pretty much catches us up to where I started. 

Jenna stays with me whenever she can. She's 12 now. I don't think she's been home for a while. 

I don't talk to my parents much anymore. I came out a few years back, and they really didn't take it well. i haven't blocked them or anything, but they haven't reached out in a year and I haven't either. 

Last week, though, something happened. I had gotten a text in our family group chat, which hasn't been active in months. Dad had invited Jenna and I over for a Thanksgiving dinner. I had always told myself I'd forgive them if they reached out, so, nervously, I agreed. 

I tensed up when I stepped foot on the property again. I hadn't been back since I moved, and things looked unfamiliar. You'd think it would be a relief going back to your childhood home, but I felt nothing but negative emotions. 

I stepped over a huge pile of dirt on the pathway to our house and rolled my eyes. We lived on a massive property that had the potential to be beautiful, yet dad always had a way of ruining it. 

We let ourselves in. I admit, the smell of turkey did remind me a bit of the few happy childhood memories I had in this house, and I began to get excited. 

"Come on in!" I heard in a familiar voice, and Jenna and I hurried towards the dining room.

But that's when we saw him. I suddenly had a flashback to the first memory I had here.

*But it wasn't dad. His eyes didn't have the same kindness as dad's did. He was just staring at us, menacingly.* 

His eyes...this wasn't dad. There was no soul behind whatever this is. 

Jenna and I exchanged glances. Without needing to say anything, we ran. 

I didn't look back for a long time. I could hear it chasing after us. In fact, I didn't look back until we were almost at my car. It was on all fours, running after us like an animal. Needless to say, I drove home as fast as I could. I think I even ran a couple red lights. From what I could see in the mirror, it didn't chase us past the house, but I wasn't taking any chances. 

Jenna and I haven't been back since. There are still questions I don't know the answers to. Where was mom? Why didn't it chase us all the way home? Most importantly, what did it do to my real dad? 

If you've read this far, I'm not sure what to say to you. Maybe next time you see a loved one, look at them deeply.
