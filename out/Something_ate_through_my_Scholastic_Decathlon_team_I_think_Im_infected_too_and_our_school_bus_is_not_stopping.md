I'm pretty sure I'm going to be dead in the next 24 hours. 

Whether that's the Costella family, or whatever *this* is, I'm not sure. 

The police are taking forever, and part of me knows they're either refusing to believe me, or RC got them too. 

I'm holed up on our school bus, so I've got nothing better to do. 

I want to tell you about my team. 

We met in our sophomore year. 

Strangers standing outside the club room. 

Levi was the freckled brunette who wouldn't stop talking about Game of Thrones.

Sunny, a pretty redhead, told him to shut up. 

Tom, a sandy blonde, nodding his head to music corked in his ears. 

I just wanted to be part of a club, and get away from my overbearing mother. 

I won't say it was a perfect start. Our school was lacking in funding, so anyone could join, which made us more of a Quiz Club. I had some serious anxiety, so I stayed on the sidelines for a while, watching, rather than taking part. 

It's not like we actually talked to each other initially. The first few weeks, we played Jeopardy, and attempted to find more members to cement us as an official Academic Decathlon club.

Unfortunately, though, it was just the four of us. 

Which made it extremely hard for us to be taken seriously. 

According to Google, Academic Decathlon teams were made up of nine members, placed by their GPA. 

Our principal laughed at us, but he *did* let us become official. 

Which was out of pity, I assumed. 

The club was assembled, and we started meeting up after school. 

Sort of. 

Sunny barely showed up, and Levi didn't take anything seriously, preferring to spend the time telling us about his weird family turf-war. 

Our principal dumped us in a tiny classroom with a resident rat living under the floorboards. 

There was barely enough room to move, and the four of us crammed together for three hours was less than appealing. 

Still, though, I wanted to be part of a club.

I had grown up with parents who were obsessed with board games, so I was pretty good at general knowledge questions. Our club room was too small for anything else but three desks (Sunny and I shared one) and a whiteboard we had to shove through the door. 

But, again, we didn't start as an Academic club.

It was more akin to Story Time Club. 

Arriving late on my third day, armed with quiz cards from home, I found Tom and Sunny completely mesmerised by Levi’s storytelling skills, drowned in shadow. 

They didn't even turn the lights on. 

I strictly remember squeezing next to Sunny, and hearing the words, *“But there was so much blood all over the floor, and my Mom told me to go upstairs and hide under the bed…”*

Sitting in front of them was Levi, perched on a desk, his legs swinging, a whiteboard marker between his teeth. 

Sometimes he'd get up, and illustrate parts of his story. 

It sucked that his drawings were all stick people. 

I won't go into full details of his life, but Levi grew up as part of a family who had… *interesting* methods of making a living. I had seen the guy’s father multiple times when we hung out at his place, and, yeah, my friend’s family definitely had Soprano vibes. 

Levi’s Draw My Life was nothing to do with the club, but it did bring us closer. 

Even if, at that point, I was considering leaving.

But it's not like it was easy to walk away from these guys. It's like finding your soulmates. Levi wasn't the only one with an interesting life. Sunny Lang was an ex kpop trainee, who was *kicked out for being too fat,* which led her to develop a severe eating disorder, and a hatred for her own body.

Sunny explained her family were originally from Boston, her mother growing up in Korea. 

She signed up for an idol agency focusing on creating a new girl group, and had gotten all the way to the final stages, before being kicked for her weight. Sunny told us her story with a smile, though there was a hollowness in her eyes I couldn't ignore. The other girls were judgemental bullies, and the idol diet and brutal regime almost killed her. 

Sunny lived in a tiny apartment with 9 girls, who would tear each other apart for a chance to debut. Sunny said all the other girls debuted, and when we (not so patiently) asked for names, she shrugged, admitting she signed an NDA that prevented her spilling the beans. 

What she *did* say, was the *K-pop idol* is a product, not a person– and are made and moulded *into* a product. 

She had zero interest in throwing her humanity away to become a manufactured doll. 

So, one of us was the son of an underground family, and the other was an ex idol. 

Tom was an aspiring horror writer with a famous older step-brother.

His story times were usually, *That one time I went to the Met Gala*.

When it was my turn to reveal my story, I told them the only interesting thing about me. 

I could *smell* when something bad was going to happen. 

They laughed, but I was being serious. 

When I was a kid, I smelled my mother’s brain tumor.

I remember it smelled like curdled milk. 

I asked Mom why her head smelled of mouldy milk, and Mom laughed and said it was her shampoo. 

It was actually a grade two tumor growing inside her brain. 

Thankfully, the tumour was found quickly and removed.

Growing older, I became sensitive to smell. The little girl choking on the bus smelled of singed wood, and the old man crossing the road stunk of gasoline. 

In the fourth grade, my classmate Alex Castor smelled of lemons all morning. 

I sat behind him, choking on the stink all the way through class. 

Ever since I met him, Alex had always smelled… off.

It was a distinct smell I could never understand, and as the days and months and years went by, that smell morphed into a subtle orangey musk that was so strong I had to cover my mouth and nose. Then, he smelled like lemons. 

During Recess, I watched Alex fall off of the jungle gym, straight onto his head. 

Alex Castor was dead before the paramedics arrived, my panicked teacher attempting CPR when his brains were leaking out of his ears. 

The school claimed it was an accident, but Alex would have been fine if the jungle gym wasn't built on solid concrete. 

I told my team members this, and Levi was sceptical. 

“You can *smell* bad things?” He said, his lips curved around his milkshake straw. In the early days, we hung out in the local bar. It's not like we were allowed inside, but Levi could get us in anywhere.

I was squeezed between Tom and Sunny, while Levi took the seat opposite us. I couldn't help noticing our waitress was insisting on free milkshake refills, her frantic eyes glued to Levi. 

I had zero idea why. Levi Costella was about as intimidating as a fruit fly. 

Wearing a white shirt with a popped collar, a leather jacket thrown over the top, Levi was giving rebellious Harvard student, rather than *son of a crime family*.

Leaning forward, he raised a brow, clearly not believing me. 

“So, you're like a stink psychic?”

I shrugged, sipping my own shake. 

“Sure.”

I wasn't planning on telling him the club room smelled *off* on our first day. 

Once we actually started the club, Levi surprised us as the smartest member, and getting to know him further, I came to the realization his family were infamous in our town. 

However, his parents hid it well. Lucy and Michael Costella were the owners of a popular ramen store in our town, hiding under the facade of two successful business owners. The Costella’s were an attractive family. 

Lucy was a sophisticated brunette with a  lipstick smile, Michael, a handsome fluffy haired man who looked like he modelled glasses.  

The two were fiercely protective over their youngest son, not so casually reminding us behind grinning smiles, that if anything happened to Levi, we would automatically be involved in the family.

I mean, they did laugh and say, “We’re joking! Look at your little faces!” when Sunny went deathly pale. But there was definitely truth behind their words.

Being Levi’s friend was… challenging at first. 

Tom and I were in his room studying for finals, and an alarm went off, flooding Levi’s room in red light. 

I had zero idea where it was coming from, but it locked all the doors and windows, forcing the Costella residence into temporary lockdown. Levi didn't seem fazed, casually mentioning his parents were *taking care* of *it*. 

He had a whiteboard set up in his room, and was standing in front of it, cramming all of our textbook notes into one easily digestible drawing. 

Levi wasn't just smart. 

He was *Ivy League* smart, so we had struck gold with him. 

His family were questionable, and yes, sometimes I did fear for my life,  but as the more time we spent at his house, the Costella household became a second home. We got used to the alarms. 

I just brought along ear plugs. 

I wish I was writing this post about Levi’s family, and sure, they are a factor in what is going on right now, but I want to preface this by saying the events below involve the 2024 scholastic decathlon final in our town with the school’s listed: 

**Starbrook High School.**

**Ratcliffe High School.**

Please note, the incident that took place last night was immediately covered up, and all phone footage was destroyed. Our town is mostly out of the way, and does not show up on Google searches.

We also have our own version of the academic decathlon, which is a more town-level competition, due to lacking funds. The four of us were desperate to start competing with our schools. 

So, we started taking things a little more seriously. 

We got a coach. 

Mr Hanes, who was hesitant at first. 

In his words, “You will hate me as your coach.”

He started by recruiting more members, announcing, “If you want to be taken seriously as an actual club, then I'll be taking the reins from now on.”

He did, and with our teachers guidance (and sometimes brutal honesty), we reached a level where we could start competing with other school’s in town. Now, none of us knew this, but Mr Hanes was *obsessed* with winning. 

So, club meetings were twisted into two hour study sessions with no talking, followed by Mr Hanes Jeaprody, which was *Jeaprody*, without the actual fun. 

We were quizzed multiple times, answer cards and practise questions quite literally thrown directly in our faces. 

I hate to admit this (I really hate to admit this) but Mr Hanes’s tactics worked. Sure, we had been mildly brainwashed by our slightly unhinged coach, but with Levi Costella, we destroyed our competitors. Like I said, our town held their own version of the academic scholastic decathlon, but it was pretty much the same, with some changes. 

Ten subjects. Language and Literature, Math, Social Science, Economics, Art, Music, Interview, Speech, and Essay. 

Unlike the official Decathlon, ours was more like a game show, with the ability to be knocked out if a team member answers a question wrong. Whoever answers the most questions correctly wins. Team meet ups were either tests, study sessions, or quizzing each other. 

Which leads me to last night. 

The finals were held in the reigning champions, Ratcliffe High School’s, auditorium. 

And we were about to win our town’s Scholastic Decathlon 2024 Championships. 

Well…I was knocked out in the music section. Standing next to my coach who I was sure was going to asphyxiate from excitement, I could smell the sudden potent stink of lemon. I tried to ignore it at first, but the more questions my team were answering correctly, the smell got worse, suffocating my senses. 

This wasn't just lemon. The stink was like a burning, singing smell trickling into my nose and the back of my throat.

It was stronger than what Alex smelled like. 

This was suffocating, drowning my thoughts. 

“Are you okay, Cassandra?” 

Mr Hanes nudged me when a Ratcliffe girl was struggling to answer a question, only for Sunny to jump in with the answer. “You look quite pale.”

I nodded, forcing a smile. 

My gaze was on the Ratcliffe coach, a scary looking blonde woman, whispering in one of her student’s ears. 

The Ratcliffe kid freaked me out. He was way too tall, dark blonde hair, and bulging eyes I swear were not blinking. 

His gaze was glued to Levi, who wore a smug grin. 

There was a smaller girl next to the Ratcliffe kid, a Macbook balanced on her knee. Every so often, he leaned into her, the two of them in deep conversation. 

“I'm just nervous.” 

I jumped when Ratcliffe scored a point, their side erupting into cheers. 

During the break, we had a mini team meeting.

Sunny rushed to the bathroom to freshen up, and I noticed a Ratcliffe girl with a bouncing ponytail following her.

Ignoring our coach’s speech, I joined the two girls in the corridor, that lemony scent hanging thick in the air. 

I caught them in an awkward position. 

The Ratcliffe girl had her fingers pinched between the material of Sunny’s dark blue shirt bearing our school’s name. 

Sunny looked confused, her lips parted like she was going to yell.

Ponytail dropped her hand, suddenly, with a nervous laugh. “Oh! I'm so, so, sorry,” she gushed. “You had, like, the biggest spider crawling on your back.” 

Sunny caught my eye, shooting me a reassuring smile.

“Thanks.” She made sure to keep her distance. “Uh, where's your bathroom?” 

The Ratcliffe girl nodded down the hallway. “It's just down there. I'm going there too if you want me to show you?”

Sunny motioned for me to go back to the auditorium. “Uh, sure! That'd be great!”

I did try to follow them, only for Sunny to cough loudly. 

I took the hint, reluctantly heading back into the auditorium. 

My team was hyping each other up, Levi in the centre, sweating through his team shirt. He ran a trembling hand through his hair. “I can't do this,” He groaned. “Ratcliffe High is known to play dirty, man. They're unbeatable.”

“In what way do they play dirty?” I asked, joining them. 

Levi gulped down water, shrugging. 

“I dunno! They're already trying to distract me with the stink eye.” The boy narrowed his eyes at a grinning Ratcliffe kid who, after noticing our stares, jumped to his feet, waving at us. 

*“Hey guys!”*

“That's Harry Cartwright, the son of the Cartwright family who tried to kill my parents in the third grade.” Levi mockingly waved back. “As you can see, their kid is a fucking sociopath.”

*Huh. I wasn't expecting the smiley kid to be the mobster’s son.*

Harry Cartwright was *not* what I expected. 

Unlike his team members, he was the only one in casual clothing, a short sleeved white shirt and jeans, a pair of sunglasses perched on top of his head. 

Tom went pale. 

“Fuck.” He hissed. “He’s one of you? Then those bastards will have a *reason* to play dirty, right?”

Levi shrugged, averting his gaze. It was the first time I saw his eyes darken, like he was subtly telling the boy to back off.

“The Cartwright’s have been trying to buy our land for a while,” he muttered. “I wouldn't put it past them to use the Decathlon as a way to attack.”

“Attack?!” April, another member of our team, hissed. “Like, *attack* attack?”

Mr Hanes grabbed the boy, resting his hands on Levi’s shoulders. “Ignore them,” he said. “Hey. Look at me.” 

Levi did, raising a brow. 

“You're losing that spark in your eye, young man.”

“Spark?”

Our coach nodded. “Look at me, kid.”

Levi rolled his eyes. “I *am* looking at you, Mr Hanes.”

The man was shaking. I was guessing his whole career (or coaching career) was on the line. 

“They know they're losing, Mr Costella.” 

Hanes shook the boy, squeezing his shoulders. “You are being positive and Ratcliffe doesn't like that. They want you to be nervous. They want to make you second guess yourself and lose confidence. Don't let them get into your head.” he smiled, giving the boy a playful shove. “Kick their asses.”

“Exactly!”

I didn't realize Sunny was back from the bathroom. 

The faint smell of lemons had followed her. I noticed a wet patch on her shirt collar, though she was quick to smile at me, admitting she'd spilled water down herself. Sunny wrapped her arms around Levi, squeezing him into a hug. 

She hung on for a little too long, Tom dragging her away with a laugh. “Good luck, all right?” she backed away, ruffling his hair. “We’ve got this!”

When I hugged Levi good luck too, I had to resist covering my nose. 

The smell of lemon was unbearable, just like fourth grade Alex. 

But it wasn't as potent as earlier. 

I vaguely remembered the smell starting to fade once Alex’s body was being carted away on a stretcher. 

Following my captain through the crowd, I was right. The smell was less suffocating. Before he went back to the stage, I grabbed the back of his shirt. 

*The material was soaking wet.*

“How are you so wet?” I said, swiping my hands on my shirt. 

“Huh?” 

I shook my head. “Never mind. Do you remember what I told you in sophomore year?” 

Levi settled me with a  confident, but nervous smile. “Thaaaat you're scared of clowns?”

“No. I mean the boy who smelled of lemons.” I gritted out. 

Levi surprised me with a laugh. “What are you talking about?”

Something ice cold trickled down my spine. 

Levi *did* know what I was talking about. He brought up my *stink sense* a day earlier in front of his parents, and I had to cover his mouth to shut him up. 

Leaning close, I whispered in his ear. “You stink of rotten lemons.”

He nodded slowly, pulling away. “Uh… thanks?”

I bit back a hiss of frustration. “No, you don't understand what I'm saying–”

“Starbrooke High School,” The host announced. “Can all members please return to the stage.”

Levi held up his hand for a high five. 

“Can we do this later?” He winked. “I'm kinda busy carrying this spelling-bee on my back right now.”

I nodded shakily, high fiving him, and letting him jump back onto the stage. 

Before his words hit like a tidal wave, ice cold water slammed into me. 

*Spelling Bee?*

Slowly making my way back to the stands, Levi’s mistake was circling around my head. He *did* win a spelling bee, but that was in middle school. 

Thankfully, the smell of lemons was gone when I returned to my seat. 

Mr Hanes handed me a soda. “Chill out, Cassandera, it's just a game.”

He could talk. The guy was on his fifth coffee. 

Mr Hanes was not *chilled out* in the slightest. 

Surprisingly, the event went well. I was half expecting my team to be crushed by the rafters, or caught in a blaze started in the crowd. But we were doing well. No, we were *winning*. 

Reaching the climaxing round, Sunny choked against a smug Ratcliffe boy, joining me on the sidelines. 

Levi answered the next question with a confident smile. 

We were winning, but Ratcliffe could still catch up with a miracle. 

The second to last question was to Ratcliffe, and it was general knowledge. 

*”Where on the human body would one find the *orbit*?*

I knew the answer, and so did Levi, his lips breaking out into a smile when the Ratcliffe boy was hesitating, eyes wide. 

Our school’s buzzer went off, Levi slamming his hand down. 

*Bzzz!*

The host turned to our team. “Starbrooke, can I have your answer?”

Levi nodded, shooting our team a victory grin. 

“It's…!“ He opened his mouth to answer, his jaw slackening suddenly. 

The boy’s shoulders slumped. 

“Uh… “ 

“Um…”

“Huhhhhh…”

Levi inclined his head, blinking, his eyes glazing over. There was a sudden, hollow vacancy that sent chills down my spine. It was like someone had reached into his skull, and yanked out his brain, leaving a shell in his place. 

To my confusion, our team captain frowned at his buzzer like he'd never seen one before. He pressed it, exploding into child-like giggles. 

*Bzzz!*

The audience laughed along nervously. 

Tom nudged me. “What the fuck is he doing?”

*Bzzz Bzzz Bzzz!*

Levi’s entire body was slumped, his hand slamming down on the buzzer. 

I caught something pooling down his chin. 

“Is he… drooling?” I whispered. 

Mr Hanes looked mildly horrified. “Has he been *drinking*?

“Levi?” Tom spluttered. “Drinking?!"

Whatever we were watching, however, was definitely influenced by… something. 

*Bzz*. *Bzz*. *Bzz*. *Bzz*. *Bzz*! 

“Young man, that is not a toy!”

The host wasn't amused. “Starbrooke High School, I need an answer from you,” He nodded to Levi, who was pressing the buzzer, his smile growing. 

“Once again,” The host backed away, like Levi was contagious. “Where on the human body would one find the *Orbit*?”

Levi cocked his head, lips parted.

His gaze found the overhead lights, and he winced, his lips curling into a frown. 

“Starbrooke High School!”

Levi jumped, tipping his head back and blowing a raspberry. “Palm tree?”

The audience laughed, and I started feeling nauseous. 

Across from us, I could see the twist of a smirk on the Ratcliffe coach’s lips. 

*Bzzz!* Levi slammed the buzzer again  giggling. 

“Starbrooke High School, if your team member continues to act like this, I will be forced to disqualify all members.”

Our captain stopped, gaze glued to the host, his hand creeping towards the buzzer, like it was a big red button. 

The audience loved it, laughing like they were watching a sitcom. 

“He wouldn't.” Tom whisper-shrieked. 

The auditorium was silent for a moment, awaiting Starbrooke’s response.

Levi stuck out his tongue, slamming his hand down. 

*Bzzz! Bzzz! Bzzz! Bzzz! Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz–*

When Tom dragged Levi away from his podium, a Ratcliffe girl hit her buzzer. 

“Starbrooke High School, you are disqualified,” the host announced. “Ratcliffe High School, do you have an answer?”

It was Ponytail who nodded with a grin. 

“The answer is the eye socket! The Orbit is part of the eye socket!”

“That is the correct answer.” The host was distracted, his eyes glued to Levi. 

“Ratcliffe High School wins.”

Levi jumped when the Ratcliffe wide erupted into cheers.

His eyes were wide, clinging onto the buzzer for comfort. 

Next to me, our coach looked like he was going to faint. 

I barely noticed Ratcliffe’s victory, too busy watching our team captain, who was Harvard bound, tipping his head back and smiling at the ceiling like a new-born baby. Tom dragged the stumbling boy over to me, his mouth twisted. 

“This was Ratcliffe, right?” He hissed, shaking our captain, who was struggling, squirming in his grip. 

“Did they put something in his drink?!” He prodded Levi. “Hey! What did they do to you?!”

Still, though, drugging his drink didn't make sense. 

Levi never left the auditorium, and kept his water bottle with him the whole time. 

How did they even manage to slip something into his drink in the first place? 

Did I *smell* our competitors drugging him? 

Sure, intentionally inebriating my teammate was morally wrong and illegal, but why could I smell lemon? 

“I doubt it was Ratcliffe.” Sunny squeezed next to me. “I've been watching them. They're harmless.”

“Then how the fuck do we explain *this* to his parents?!” Tom whispered, grappling with Levi, who was fighting to get back to the buzzer. 

When Tom let go of him, he dropped onto the floor, crawling over to his podium. It was like watching a child. 

Who was determined to piss off the adults.

Levi jumped back to instead feet, his gaze was glued to the host, a smile curved on his lips, when he slammed the buzzer again. 

*Bzzz!*

“Someone, please remove the Starbrooke boy from the stage!”

I was embarrassed, our whole team ducking our heads as our captain was forcibly removed from the podium. 

Mr Hanes grabbed Levi, pulling him off of the stage. 

I expected our coach to be mad at him, but I think the teacher was more worried, a phone pressed to his ear while he forced the boy into a sitting position. 

*No, I don't think it's influence from alcohol,* I could hear his conversation. 

Levi kept trying to get up, mesmerised by the buzzer. The teacher was firm but gentle. “Hey. Sit down, all right? Keep still.” He went back to his phone call, gently prying Levi’s eyes open. 

*From what I can see, there's nothing wrong. He's just kind of…* 

Mr Hanes swiped his own hands on his jeans.  *... wet?*

Team Ratcliffe came over to rub it in our faces, though I was still tuned into our coach’s hissed whispering. 

*Water? No, I don't think it's water. It smells… no, I haven't told his parents…*

“You guys did *awesome*!” Ponytail's voice was sugary sweet. *Too* sugary. 

She held the 2024 trophy, bearing a satisfied smile. I noticed the Ratcliffe members were surrounding Harry, like guards. 

“Better luck next time, okay?” She held out her hand, her eyes twinkling.

“No hard feelings?” 

“Control your *dog*.” Harry said, amused eyes flicking to Levi, who was once again sprinting back to the fucking buzzer. His eyes had visibly darkened, lips curled into a triumphant smile. 

Harry Cartwright was watching Mr Hanes chase our team captain like it was his own personal entertainment. 

I had to look away before I died of second hand embarrassment. 

“What did you put in his drink?” Tom demanded. “Weed? Edibles?” the boy attempted to shove Harry, only to be pushed back. “What the fuck did you do to him?”

Harry’s smile didn't waver. “Like I said. Control your *mut*.”

When the Ratcliffe team walked away, our red faced coach struggling with Levi, who was behaving progressively more erratically, informed us we were longer welcome inside the school. 

Tom suggested calling an ambulance, but our coach was hesitant. 

We all knew who Levi’s family were. 

On the way out, Tom matched my stride. He was frowning at our team captain struggling to walk. 

The way he was acting was already eyebrow raising. 

But walking at an angle and being unable to stand up straight was worrying. 

“I don't think they drugged his drink.” Tom muttered. 

We pushed through the doors out of the school, and I revelled in the cool night air grazing my cheek. “If they did, he would be acting out of it, right? So, what's the deal with him acting like–”

“A child.” I finished for him. 

“Yeah.” Tom leaned closer. “Do you think this has something to do with their turf war?”

I slapped at a bug creeping across my cheek. 

Levi fell over again, this time bursting into giggles. 
 
“Almost definitely.”

Levi was right about Ratcliffe playing dirty. I didn't realize *how* dirty until we were on the losers bus home. Levi was in the seat next to me, and the kid hadn't moved since we left Ratcliffe, his eyes wide, lips pulled into a dazed grin. 

*Bzzz!*

The noise startled me from slumber. I was drooling, my head pressed against the window. Outside, the sky was pitch dark, and squinting through the glass, I couldn't get a bearing on where we were. I thought I was hearing things, but when I sat up, I heard it again. 

*Bzzz!*

It was close. 

Leaning over the boy, I glimpsed a smear of scarlet on his headrest. 

I choked on my next words. 

“Tom.” 

Tom was in front of me, listening to music. 

He didn't reply, his head of dark blonde curls nodding to the beat. 

“Levi.” I managed to get out. I prodded him, and his head lolled into his shoulder. “Hey. Can you… sit up?”

Bzzz! Bzzz!

When the boy didn't move, I gently grabbed his shoulders and pulled him forward myself, something contracting in my stomach. 

I  don't know how long it takes for your mind to fully register something, but my body was already reacting. 

Levi’s seat was infested with *bugs*, eating their way through the upholstery. I was aware of my body moving back. I  threw up, instantly, screaming into my hand. 

The back of my best friend's skull resembled a deflated soccer ball, what was left of his brain leaking from his skull where a swarm of skittering bugs chewed their way through brain tissue, metallic legs scratching the curved, pearly white of the base if his skull. 

Levi’s head hung, his body flopping into mine. 

But his eyes were still open, lips still stretched into a smile. 

Blood ran in thick rivulets from his nose and ears. 

*Bzzz!*

I could see them, black writhing dots alive in his eyes, wriggling movement under his skin. 

“Tom!” 

I jumped up, stumbling into the aisle, my stomach heaving. 

And it was only when I was on my knees, swiping bile from my lips, when I realized the others weren't reacting. 

Tom wasn't moving. 

I pulled an Airpod out of his ear, a long, slithering string of pink attached to the end. 

There was a stray bug skittering across his hand, his face starting to twitch and writhe. 

Moving back, I checked myself over, my hands shaking. 

Head. 

Shoulders. 

Hair. 

Clawing through it, my breath was stuck in my throat. 

Arms. 

Legs. 

Feet. 

Mr Hanes was slumped against the window, a reddish froth bubbling from his mouth. 

Sunny. 

I started towards the back of the bus, but all I had to see was her bowed head, half of her skull chewed through. 

Sunny was in a far more deteriorated state, her face had been ripped through,  a skeletal smile glinting in the dim. 

The thick black smear on the window next to her was *moving.* 

When I screamed for the driver to stop the bus, he ignored me. 

If anything, he stamped on the gas. 

I moved forward to shake him, before glimpsing a bug creeping down his face. 

Calling 911, the operator laughed at me. 

*“Bugs are eating your friends.” He said. “Do you know the penalty for calling with bullshit pranks?”*

The bus didn't stop, so I stayed at the front, while the bugs took over the back, eating through my teammates. 

After four hours, I risked leaning over the seat next to Tom to check on Levi. 

They were eating him.

Chewing all the way through skin, muscle and bone.

I tried to stop the bus, but the driver’s hands were tightly wrapped around the wheel. 

Another hour, and blood was seeping down the aisle, crawling with bugs. 

Levi was gone, and in his place, a buzzing skittering pile of bugs, that I thought were going to move to a second victim, maybe burrowing into the seats. 

But, no. 

These things began to tremble, replicating. 

Building. 

Slowly, *nothing* became static, and static became muscle. 

Then bone. 

Then flesh. 

When a body began to slowly form, moulded from the dead boy, I stumbled back. 

These things weren't eating Levi Costella. 

They were *rewriting* him. 

… 

Edit: I'm still on the bus. I'm 99.9% sure that I'm infected with whatever this thing is. I can't stop fucking itching. 

I keep picking them off me but they won't stop. This bus isn't going to stop until I'm like the others. 

… 

Edit 2: 

I can feel them chewing into my skull. They're in my ears. I keep spitting them out. Please, someone get them off of me. Help me. I don't want to die at 17.

Edit 3: 

Still alive. Still breathing. Maybe they're leaving me alone????? I think I'm okay. There is a pile of bugs at my feet, but they're crawling off of me. 

Edit 4:

Levi really wants to go home. Like, he just told me he REALLY wants to go home. He's got a gift for his parents.

I have a feeling I know what it is.
