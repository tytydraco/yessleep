This is a true story that I experienced. You’re probably not going to believe me, that’s okay. No one else does but this is the truth to the best of my memory. 

I was maybe 12? I lived with my aunt and her daughter at the time. They were addicts and never paid attention to me so I came and went as I pleased. I had a dog. He was a big fluffy husky mix of some kind and he followed me everywhere I went to keep me safe I think. 

I was playing with him out in the yard. We lived in the center of a very small rural town so the road was nearby and so was a school. Our yard was kind of big, an acre or two at most but it was spacious. Trees lined the back side of the property opposite the road. It was maybe 7:30 in the evening in summer. I was playing fetch with my dog when I noticed his body language change almost like a switch had been flipped. His body went stiff. His fur stood on end all down his head, neck, and back. Eyes locked on something at the edge of the property that I couldn’t see. I stepped up behind him and he started growling and shifted his weight in front of me, almost saying “no don’t”. I’d never heard him growl before.. till then. 

That’s when I noticed it. A skinny, bony figure that looked like a man stood just barely out of the tree line at the edge of my property. I squinted to get a better look. His hair was brown and chin length. It was matted and tangled. It looked wet in some places. He wasn’t wearing a shirt. His skin hung over his bones like a loose tshirt. He was pale. Very pale. The dirt on his skin contrasted his pasty appearance. He was wearing brown work shorts. They were also dirty. He had a tree branch in his left hand. Almost like he was trying to keep himself hidden and out of my line of sight. He was looking right at me.. 

His eyes were so dark and cold. I felt a shiver run up my back the longer he looked at me. His facial hair was also unkept. He had a smirk on his face. Almost like he knew he was scaring me. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t look away from him. My dog hadn’t moved a muscle either. In his right hand, he held something wooden. It was wet, and the liquid on the handle shimmered in the evening sun. The closer I looked I realized he was holding an axe. And it wasn’t just wet. Blood dripped from his hands down the length of the handle onto the metal axe head. 

He raised the axe in my direction, then started towards me. I screamed and backed up towards the house. He turned and walked calmly towards the road, unbothered by my calls for help. I called my dog on him and Hank (my dog) took off. He just missed the man as he crossed the road. 

About that that time a work truck drove by. On the other side of the road there was nothing but open field. The man was gone in the amount of time it took for the truck to pass. The only thing I found was the axe. Laying in the grass just on the other side of the road. The police took it for evidence but no one believed me. I thought it was a dream for the longest time… but I know what I saw. I felt real fear that day. And I will never forget that sick feeling.
