I kind of feel bad for cab drivers sometimes. Or at least, I did. It’s gotta be hard to be a product of a bygone era, watching as new alternatives rise up to take your place. Turns out though, sympathy can be a dangerous thing.

I took a trip to Washington DC one summer when I had some time off. I wanted to see the Smithsonian. I tried to get a few friends to come with me, but the plans all fell through. Still, it was a bucket list item for me, so I went by myself.

It was dark by the time my flight got into the city, and I needed to find a ride to my lodgings. I was being cheap and booked a hotel a good distance from the airport. Alright, motel. It was just me after all, and my standards aren’t all that high. I exited the terminal and made my way out into the warm summer evening. I was about to call an Uber, when I saw a yellow cab parked a ways down the street. It wasn’t a particularly busy night, and I was curious. Like I said, I felt kind of bad for cabbies.

I walked over to it and looked into the passenger side window. From what I could tell, the driver was an older man, dressed in strangely warm clothes for the weather. A jacket and cap, and even a scarf that covered his face. I asked if he was waiting on anyone, and he shook his head no without turning to look at me. Quiet. Honestly, I preferred my drivers that way.

I asked if he knew where my motel was, and he gave a curt nod. Without giving it much more thought, I hopped into the back seat. Now, I don’t know Washington DC well. It was my first and only time visiting, so I wasn’t paying much attention to where the driver was taking me. However, after about half an hour of silent driving, I began to suspect that we weren’t going to the motel. We should have arrived by then.

It’s weird how fast your perception can change once you realize you might be in danger. The man suddenly seemed suspicious and sinister. I noticed how gray his skin was beneath his scarf, and how strange it was that he was completely covered, down to the driving gloves. I tried not to panic, and debated trying to bail out of the moving vehicle. I looked out of the window. We were in a strange place. Not exactly a neighborhood, as there were industrial buildings all around, but ramshackle and seemingly forgotten. Not a place I wanted to wander alone.

So I asked him where he was taking me. Flat out, no beating around the bush. It was obvious we were nowhere near my motel, and I pulled out my phone to potentially call for help. No service. What the hell? In the middle of DC? To add onto that, the gray driver didn’t respond to my question. He didn’t even glance in the rearview mirror. Instead, he just turned onto a concrete ramp that led underground, beneath a tall, unassuming building. Like the towers you pass in a city without giving a second thought to what goes on inside them.

“Fuck it,” I thought, and tried to push open the back door. Child locked. Of course. Thinking on it now, I can’t imagine that’s allowed for taxi cabs, but it soon became clear that this was not a standard taxi. This is where I would probably have started going for the wheel, but those damn dividers that cabs have between the front and back seats made that difficult. I tried breaking the windows, to no avail. I yelled at the driver and kicked the back of his seat. Nothing.

We drove through an empty parking garage, sparsely lit with flickering incandescent lights. I calmed myself with a few deep breaths and prepared for whatever awaited me when we stopped. We eventually pulled into a faded parking spot near a metal door that seemed to lead into the building. We idled there for a moment, and I readied to start throwing punches at whoever came to open my door. Suddenly, the metal door set in the concrete wall opened and a half a dozen figures dressed in hazmat suits poured out. They wrenched open my door and pulled me out forcefully. I tried my best to fight them off, but they restrained me with little effort.

The next thing I knew I was strapped down to a wheeled stretcher and was rolling down a dingy hallway. My suited captors silently pushed me past dark and empty rooms in what appeared to be an abandoned office building. Bound and gagged, all I could do was watch and try not to have a heart attack.

They eventually turned me down another hallway, but this one wasn’t empty. It was lit in a sickly green light and was littered with what I can only describe as tanks. Not military tanks, but like. Large fish tanks. Only they did not contain fish.

The first one I got a clear look at seemed to house a shriveled corpse, floating in a thick gel. We were moving quickly, but I swear I saw it follow our passage with its sunken eyes, turning its head as we passed. The other tanks held similar bodies, ranging from the size of fetuses to full grown adults. All humanoid. All dead looking. The further along they brought me, the more distorted the beings in the tanks became. Extra appendages grew from strange places. Features where they shouldn’t be. I saw a desiccated child covered in mouths that opened and shut. I even thought I heard a muted chorus of screams emanating from its prison.

I was eventually pushed into a cold, grey chamber with a large mirror and vents covering the walls. I was left in there, alone for just a few minutes. I writhed and fought my bindings, but before I could make any progress, green gas began to pour from the vents and quickly filled the room. It hurt to breathe in, and I began coughing up blood. That’s the last thing I remember of that place.

I have vague memories of jostling around in the back of a moving vehicle after that. I remember excited voices, but I couldn’t make out what they said. When I fully came to, I was lying on the side of an overpass somewhere in the city. Morning was arriving, and I felt nauseous and pained. I still had everything on me, my phone, wallet, and keys. They even left me with my luggage. How considerate.

I spent the rest of the day at a hospital, claiming that I had been kidnapped and exposed to some sort of gas. The doctors treated me like I was a lunatic suffering a mental break. They tested all my vitals, and all came back normal. In the end, they sent me away with a clean bill of health, but suggested I seek some counseling. I didn’t bother checking out the Smithsonian. I just camped out at the airport until it was time to fly home.

I never did discover exactly what they did to me. I thought for sure I was going to end up in one of those tanks. But life has returned mostly to normal. There has been one new sensation, though. Ever since that night, I’ve felt a tingling all over my body. I also hear what sounds like a million tiny movements in my head at all times. I think… I think I feel all of my cells performing their cellular functions all at once. It wasn’t too noticeable at first… but the sensation has gotten stronger. It keeps me awake at night. I fidget all the time. It tickles and itches and it’s even starting to hurt. I know if I told that to a doctor they’d refer me to the nearest psychiatrist post-haste. Maybe they’d be right to do that.

I also think I feel myself growing in strange places. A dark patch has formed beneath my arm. It’s hard and it tingles. I know I need to see a doctor but… I’m nervous to find out what’s really happening. Terrified, actually.

But there’s one other thing that’s been bothering me. Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad to not be stuck in a jar like the poor souls I saw that night… but if I’m a successful experiment… are there others?
