When I brought the property, I thought I made the deal of a lifetime, Â£100 for a nice 1 bedroom, 1 floored house, with a lovely view of the local area.

However, one summer's evening, my view of the house went south. I was playing FIFA in the living room, until I conceded, out of anger, I threw my controller across the room. Instead of the controller breaking into billions of peices, a hole appeared in my wall. 

"Crap." I said to myself, I got up and reached into the hole, however, the controller was nowhere to be found. I decided to get a flashlight to locate the controller, however, when I shone the flashlight upon the hole, a staircase appeared Infront of my eyes. "Weird." I thought to myself, this house only has one floor. After a short debate against myself, I decided to climb in to investigate. The steps were cold and seemingly endless, after what felt like hours, the stairs ended, I was met with a room that looked like it hadn't been touched in for years.

Upon using my flashlight once more, I was met with a wall, all the wallpaper had been torn and I was met with a message. "Mum - 8/2.", tomorrow. I assumed I was dreaming and pinched myself, however, I was met with pain. Thus, I assumed this was some really messed up and weird joke. I decided I'd leave the room. I walked down the stairs and tucked myself into bed.

I woke up to the sound of my phone ringing, I answered it, still half-asleep. It was the police, "Hello, Sir. We are calling to inform you your mother has been murdered." I was both shocked and devastated, and then, I remembered the room. I made myself a cup of tea before scaling the stairs once more. When I entered the room again, the wall had another message, "Kevin - 8/3." "Who is Kevin?" I said to myself. I shrugged it off and walked back downstairs, I let the rest of my day play out like normal.

When I woke up the next morning, my phone had one notification "Local Man, 67 MURDERED in Garden." I clicked on the notification to find out more. "Local resident Kevin Moore, 67, was been murdered. Moore, who was a gardener was murdered by a hooded man." I dropped my phone, "This must be a coincidence." I said to myself.

However, I once more climbed my way to the room. "Boris - 8/4.". The wall said. Boris had always been a close friend of mine, I texted him an image of this. "Can't really respond right now, I'm about to go on a plane." Boris's message with accompined by an image of his seat, however, reflected off the window was a sinister man, wearing a dark hoodie. I panicked, however, Boris was on Do Not Disturb Mode. I spent the rest of my day panicking, despite my strong atheism, even I found myself praying. I passed out on the couch.

I woke up the next day and I was met with a text. "Hiya! This is Boris's mother, unfortunately, his plane was hijacked and he has unfortunately passed away." I turned on the news, they showed an image of the supposed culprit, a hooded man with an indistinguishable face. "Something is up, this is no longer a coincidence." I said to myself, I scaled the staircase once more. "Maybe I could prevent it this time." I said to myself, when I reached the top, I was met the text "You - 8/5."
