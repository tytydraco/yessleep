“I will be there for you, day or night,” She said. "And the time between times."

That raised an eyebrow, but not my suspicions.

I had blindly loved Abigail Thorp for six years. At the time, her peculiar wedding vows seemed endearing. She was only adding a little sprinkle and spice to the ceremony, as she did with all things. That was what I naively believed.

“Richer or poorer, in sickness and in health,” Abigail continued. “Glued or unglued.”

My second eyebrow raised, levelling with the first.

“I will protect you,” My fiancée said. “You will be safeguarded during your resting hours. You are my world. A vessel for my love. My prosperity. My future. And I hope to be a vessel for you. A provider. An abundant source of wealth, joy, and love. I love you, Noah.”

“Okay…” I slowly replied, smiling uncertainly at Abigail’s speech. “Are you just trying to delay saying ‘I do’?”

The crowd laughed, and, ever the aspiring comedian, I grinned smugly. I was oblivious to the significance of the union being forged.

“I’m ready for your vows, Noah,” Abigail warmly caressed my hands whilst looking at the vicar.

“Yes…” The man stammered, dumbfounded by her vows. “Right… Noah…?”

I cleared my throat. “What version of ChatGPT were you using? I didn’t get anything like that.”

My fiancée rolled her eyes and shook her head.

“Fine,” I chuckled. “I’ll be serious. Okay?”

I summoned a deep breath, unmasking the clown to reveal a vulnerable man beneath.

“Abigail, there is no other woman quite like you,” I said. “From the moment we met, I was drawn to you. The only person goofier than me. I knew that I had to marry you, if only to prove to my parents that, comparatively, I’m not that weird.”

I heard my mother and father chortling from the front row.

“You are boundlessly kind, intelligent, and beautiful. My one and only love, in this lifetime and any lifetime,” I continued, pausing for the obligatory utterances of gooey approval from the crowd. “I love you, Abigail.”

“And do you promise to be a vessel for my love?” She pressed, fidgeting on the spot.

That was the only odd question which didn’t surprise me. It was a vow my fiancée had requested — that we would both be ‘love vessels’ for one another. Abigail had always been a poet, all teasing aside, and I viewed her entire declaration as a typical Abby oddity. The ‘vessel’ vow was no different. It was just her unusual form of love language. Something sort of innuendo, perhaps, I thought, stifling a grin.

“I promise to be a vessel for your love,” I agreed.

Once the words escaped my lips, I immediately caught a glimpse of something in Abigail’s eye. The fleeting reflection of a shadow in the corner of the church. It had the shape of a man. A misshapen man. And it came with the sensation of my brain being painfully clamped. Only for a moment, but long enough to make me wince.

“Noah?” The vicar asked, noticing my brief flinch.

“I’m fine…” I muttered, shaking my head to free the pins and needles.

Abigail smiled, but it was a faux smile. Not the adoring one I’d come to know over the years.

“It is time for the declaration of intent. Do you, Noah Chapman, take Abigail Thorp to be your lawfully wedded wife?” The vicar asked.

“I… do,” I said, eye twitching as I wrestled with what felt like ethereal fingernails digging into my skull.

“And do you, Abigail Thorp, take Noah Chapman to be your lawfully wedded husband?” The vicar asked.

“I do,” My fiancée nodded, lips bending ever-upwards.

“Then, by the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride,” The vicar said.

The crowd roared with applause as my mouth met Abigail’s pursed lips. Much like her smile — much like that entire ceremony — it was nothing like any other kiss we’d shared. I had never felt both warm and cold from her touch. I’d never felt that way from anything. It was the happiest moment of my life, yet it was clouded by trepidation. A clinging fear.

But what followed was not horror.

My wife and I began a whirlwind romance. A relationship deeper than the one we had prior to marrying. That swiftly flushed any doubts down the drain. The slight blip on our wedding day must have been jitters. That was what I chose to believe. A cliché, but one that made the most sense.

The first bump in the road came a month down the line. The topic of our living situation arose for the hundredth time. From her late parents, Abigail inherited the family home and a sizeable plot of land. She wanted us to move there. Understandable, of course. However, I resented the idea of her relatives viewing me as a gold digger. Her great aunt once made a chastising remark that stuck with me.

“Everybody knows the Thorp name,” She huffed to Abigail. “I’ve got my eye on you, Chapman.”

The implication infuriated me. I was already financially stable before meeting Abigail. I worked as a senior software engineer. I didn’t need the Thorp fortune.

“The house is yours,” I told my wife. “Do what you want with it, but don’t feel that you have to include me. It’s your inheritance. I’d rather not move into that place.”

Abigail groaned. “Stop being so stubborn, Noah. It’s not a handout. Okay? We’re married. What’s mine is yours.”

“Well… What about Chris?” I pointed out. “Isn’t he interested in it? Does he not resent your parents for leaving the estate to you?”

“He inherited a sizeable sum of money, the yacht, and the lake-house,” Abigail said. “My brother received just as much wealth as me.”

“Does he see it that way?” I asked. “After all, we are talking about Thorp Manor. That’s your family’s heritage.”

“Heritage? Oh, please. Chris only cares about money,” My wife laughed. “You need to get over this, Noah. Nobody is going to despise you for living in that house with me. Forget my Great Aunt Gertrude. She’s a bitter old woman. An aunt, might I add, who my mother hated.”

Arguing with Abigail was like chewing skirt steak. It was tough, and it ended with jaw-ache.

Naturally, I eventually buckled and agreed to move to Thorp Manor. In fairness, Abigail was right. I was being stubborn. I admit my flaws. Pride is one of them. In truth, I did want to move there. The property was one of unbeatable splendour, and I was secretly jubilant at the prospect of living in a manor.

Marital bliss resumed. All seemed well for the following few months — better than ever before, as I said. I forgot all about the argument and the strangeness of our wedding day.

And then came the migraines.

Much like the day of the ceremony, electric shocks filled my head. Brain zaps. They flared up during the mornings, mostly, but the dull pain sometimes persisted throughout the day.

And there were other health issues. No matter how much I slept, I was perpetually fatigued. Hazy-brained. Living life on standby mode. It felt as if I were lugging a plumper brain around, to the detriment of my thinking ability. And that was strange, as I’d never been the type to feel excessively tired. I was a night owl. But, suddenly, I seemed unable to stay awake past ten in the evening. And nothing noticeable in my lifestyle had changed.

“Are you okay, sweetie?” Abigail asked.

I sighed heavily. “I just, erm… I feel…”

“Tired?” My wife finished. “Lie down for a little while, honey. I’ll cook dinner tonight.”

“No, I said I’d do it. Don’t you have to prepare for that presentation in the morning?” I asked.

But Abigail shushed me, and I thanked her, giving her a tight squeeze. Then, I waddled dozily to the manor’s spacious lounge, picking one of the three sofas to rest my weary, weighty head. I slumped onto a cushion, and my body tumbled immediately into the land of nod.

But my dreams were feverish. The eccentric, surreal nightmares of a body running on fumes. When the body viciously reboots itself after countless sleepless nights, the mind runs wild. And this wasn’t my first fever dream since moving to the manor. Just as it wasn’t the first time I’d seen the man in the corner of my sleep-fuelled visions. The man with grey eyes and no other features on his face.

I woke from my nap around half six in the evening. I’m sure I would’ve slept until dinner was ready, but the sound of an agitated conversation disrupted my rest.

“You need to leave,” Abigail urged. “It’s far too early for you to be–”

“– He’s asleep,” A man’s familiar voice interrupted. “Let’s do it now. I’m growing impatient.”

“No… Dinner’s nearly ready,” My wife huffed. “He’ll be waking up soon… There’ll be time later.”

“Fine,” A woman grunted. “At the mid point, then.”

“At the mid point,” Abigail said.

I squeezed my eyelids together, body trembling as I tried to decipher the coded conversation. I was wracking my brain to pinpoint those voices.

I was distracted during dinner. I wanted to confront Abigail about the mysterious visitors who left before I pretended to wake up. Of course, she would’ve known that I’d been eavesdropping. And something about the nature of their talk set me on the back-foot. I felt exposed. Abigail had never made me feel exposed before.

When we finally went to bed, I stayed awake with my eyes firmly shut. I anxiously awaited whatever scheme Abigail and her unknown accomplice had in store. I channelled my inner ‘night owl’, and I wasn’t worried about nodding off. Nerves will keep me awake, I decided. As would the thunderstorm which brewed outside.

However, I was baffled to be woken by my alarm clock around seven in the morning. I’d failed to resist the pull of sleep. And the sinister connotations of that fact were starting to dawn on me. The exhaustion. The excruciating headaches. The strangers in our home. Something was uneven. And, on this particular morning, there was something else.

The legs of my joggers were dirty and sodden.

Have I been sleepwalking outside? I wondered.

I wasn’t convinced, so I resisted the urge to mention anything to Abigail. It was all connected, somehow. My wife had something to do with it. And I devised a way to find answers. I would film myself. See whether I’d been getting up in the middle of the night. Going for strolls. Repeatedly bludgeoning my head, perhaps. There had to be a logical explanation for everything. Even the conversation.

You might have misinterpreted or misheard them, I suggested to myself. Or, better yet, it may have been a dream.

With renewed confidence, I crossed my fingers that the video footage would clear up everything.

After setting up the camera, I went to bed with giddiness in my gut. I longed to wake and finally have some answers.

Unfortunately, the next day, there were no damp patches or grubby stains on my clothes. And the video recording revealed that I slept through the night. Over the following days, this continued to be the case. I was starting to lose faith until Chris came to stay.

Much to my annoyance, Abigail’s drunken brother, upon arriving at our manor, collapsed on the sofa. He won a sizeable sum of money from gambling and immediately splurged it on a two-day bender. It wasn’t the first time that he’d earned and blown wealth.

“Is this going to be a recurring thing?” I sighed.

My wife shrugged. “He’s an addict, Noah. We have to support him. He’s working on it.”

“Maybe. He’s also a sociopath,” I said. “And he never has to account for his actions.”

Abigail pouted. “Look, he’s still my brother. Besides, he actually came here to… clear his head.”

“Right,” I nodded disbelievingly, rubbing my own pounding forehead. “Speaking of which, the migraines are back. I’m going to bed.”

“Okay, sweetie,” My wife said, planting a kiss on my sore brow. “Good night!”

The next morning, I woke to that familiar feeling of disorientation. And, for the first time, I was glad about it. I knew exactly what it meant. I rushed to my computer, uploaded the footage from the hidden camera, and fast-forwarded through the events of the prior night.

“What the…” I began.

At midnight, Abigail’s eyes opened fully. She lay on her back, as stiff as a plank, as if she’d never really been asleep. As if she were hardly human, for that matter. My wife rose like a machine, and her stiff limbs carried her to the bedroom door.

When she opened it, Chris entered.

“It’s time. Is he ready?” My brother-in-law asked.

Abigail nodded.

“Good,” The man replied, before clearing his throat. “At the mid point, you unglue.”

In a blur of motion too fast to track, something awful happened.

My body split in two.

Abigail and Chris watched silently as my sleepwalking form rose from the bed, unbinding itself from the black, shadowy shape of a body left on the bed. My real-life jaw fell. I watched as my wife and brother-in-law walked out of the room, followed by my zombified body.

And, left behind, there was only a black spectral form atop the bed — a shadow that had my vague shape. It was a vibrating energy, with my outline, rigidly frozen in place.

Hyperventilating, mind crippled by existential dread, I shivered in front of the computer screen. Watching an unmoving recording of some terrifying spirit.

After half an hour, Abigail and Chris returned, followed seconds later by my shuffling, lifeless shell.

“Are you satisfied?” My wife asked Chris.

“Never,” Her brother coldly replied. “Are you?”

“Yes!” My wife said, tucking my body back into bed — it lay atop the black spirit.

“Then why do you do the same?” Chris asked, offering a wicked smile.

Abigail ignored him. “I am a vessel for your love. You glue.”

With those words, the dark spectre reunited with my body. Skin absorbed the blackened form. A second later, after rebinding, my recorded self started snoozing soundly.

“I love him,” My wife said.

“You love what he can give you,” My brother-in-law taunted. “Good night, Abby.”

After her brother left the room, Abigail stood in silence for several minutes. She stared at the wall, panting heavily. I don’t know what she felt. Rage. Sadness. Frustration. All I know is that her breathing suddenly slowed, until she looked entirely peaceful. Serene.

And then her head cracked to the side, facing the filming camera.

“FUCK!” I cried, falling off the desk chair.

And, as I climbed to my feet, my eyes were drawn to the shape in the office’s doorway.

Abigail was home.

“I’ve been waiting for you to wake up,” She sighed. “Noah, I can explain–”

“– What the fuck, Abigail?” I screamed. “What the fucking fuck?”

“I didn’t know how to tell–”

“– I’m leaving,” I cried, charging towards the stranger in the doorway.

“Day or night, heed your vow,” She whispered.

In a surge of excruciating agony, I felt my body tear in two. And by the time I realised that, I was left staring at my own physical form. It stood before me like a statue. I was a disembodied spirit, enduring a terrifying outer-body experience.

“Don’t worry,” Abigail said, leaving my frozen spirit behind as she led my physical shell out of the room. “I’ll fix you…”

As my wife and my body exited the office, the colours of reality swirled around me, and I stumbled into a liminal landscape of brimstone and hellfire. Strangely, I recognised it. Something stirred in my memory bank. I’d been to that place before. Numerous times — every time the Thorps split my soul from its vessel. And when I woke, I forgot. I was left with nothing but a pounding head and questions.

I decided that time would be different.

“Hello?” I called.

I wandered through the arid abyss, tentatively peering around rocky mounds and side-stepping trickling streams of fire, lava, or whatever otherworldly substance blazed in that wasteland. The sky above was black, but it was not filled with stars — it was an infinite emptiness. Not a sky at all. Not anything.

After what could’ve been an hour or a minute of wandering through nothingness, I eventually abandoned my mission and resigned myself to Abigail’s fate. With a deep sigh, I turned my head and prepared to head back.

My feet failed me.

Following at a distance of no more than ten yards was a looming, gangly figure. A man with limbs like those of a human, but there was nothing about him that was from our world. He was built of loose, peeling flesh — revealing mounds of black, beating mush beneath the surface of his skin. And, as a flare of otherworldly lava lit the air, it illuminated patches of fur on his body.

Much like the man of my nightmares, he bore two grey eyes and no other features on his terrifying face.

“You return to the place between, Noah Chapman,” The being lowly noted, speaking from all directions.

I shuddered, stumbling backwards.

“Yet again, you have forgotten my face,” He said, tilting his horrid head to the side and eagerly viewing me. “Perhaps, if I wear your lovely skin, you might recognise me…”

The creature took a silent step towards me, and I wondered whether it had been soundlessly pursuing me for the entire time I’d been in its ungodly land. Terrified of the impossibility before me, I stepped backwards, but the being was nimble. Large. Omnipotent in its realm, I had no doubt.

“What do you want?” I asked.

“No,” He replied, inching ever-closer. “You should be asking what they want.”

I panted fearfully, retreating slowly from the approaching abhorrence. Its eyes glistened a muted grey, swirling in endless whirlpools that threatened to consume me.

“What have they done to me?” I asked. “Where am I?”

“Better questions,” The creature replied. “They tied you to Abigail, and they are using you. As for this realm, you are in the place between places.”

I clawed my head frightfully. “Using me for what?”

“To claim their rewards,” He hissed. “No souls can step over the border and enter my prison. But a soulless body safely walks through the fire. It can do their bidding…”

“But I have a soul, and I’m here,” I pointed out.

“This isn’t my prison,” It replied. “This isn’t anywhere. Neither of us are really here because there is no ‘here’.”

“What do you mean?” I cried.

“You always ask that question. I tire of explaining this,” It growled. “I am Temnor, and I offer gifts to those who sustain me, Noah Chapman. The hovel by the lake. That is the place in which I have dwelled for fifty rounds of the sun. The Thorps imprisoned me, and now they feed me. You are my feast.”

“You… made a deal with the Thorps?” I asked.

“I must survive,” Temnor answered. “I cannot live in a cage. The Thorps bring me your soulless body. They unglue your spirt from it, bringing me an empty husk. A shell through which I can walk the mortal world for a half hour at the mid point. In return, I give them whatever they desire. One gift per visit.”

“You’ve possessed me?” I whispered.

“People cannot be possessed, Noah Chapman,” Temnor explained. “You are not your body.”

I gasped fearfully, and an unthinkable question spilled out of my mouth. “Would you make a deal with me?”

The terrifying being finally stopped taking strides towards me. He surveyed me with great interest, crinkling his featureless face in a way that almost had the appearance of a direful smile.

“You have never asked that before, Noah Chapman,” It replied. “What manner of deal?”

“I want…” I stammered, searching for the words. “I want freedom from the Thorps. Freedom from you. This place. All of it.”

“And in return?” It asked. “If not your body, I require something else…”

I gulped. “I don’t have the stomach to sacrifice another human to you. Even a cruel one.”

“Oakwood,” Temnor said.

I paused. “Oakwood?”

“Yes,” It continued. “The Thorps denied my request. I do not need much. Just a taste.”

“Why?” I cautiously asked.

“It will unbind me from my prison,” Temnor said. “And they do not wish to unbind me. They need me. Endlessly. Again and again. For all of their selfish desires.”

“I won’t imprison you,” I replied. “I only need one thing from you.”

“We need the same thing, it seems,” Temnor noted. “Freedom. Such sickly poetry.”

“I am curious, however. Why haven’t you ever fetched oakwood for yourself?” I asked. “You’ve used my body as a vessel to leave your hovel on numerous occasions.”

“I am bound by rules,” The being hissed. “Do we have a deal, Noah Chapman?”

“Yes… Won’t I forget this?” I asked. “As we speak, Abigail’s taking my body to the lake.”

“Yes,” Temnor said. “I sense her nearing. I shall have to leave this purgatory. And, as she always does, she will ask that I make you forget. Will you bring me the oakwood if I lie?”

I shuddered and nodded.

“By the mid point?” It continued.

I nodded again.

“Very well,” Temnor growled. “I will ensure that you remember.”

I screamed as my soul was swept away by a swirl of blackness, in which the horrifying entity merged with its surroundings.

After an eternal plummet, I felt grounded. Physical. Real. And I realised that the blackness was, in fact, the inside of my eyelids. When I opened them, my soul had returned to its body. I was back in the real world. Lying in bed. In the real time — not the one between.

“Good morning!” A peppy voice called, startling me.

I turned to face the en-suite door, and my wife was beaming at me with a toothbrush in her mouth. She asked Temnor to wipe my mind, and I had to play along with that notion. It took tremendous willpower, but I smiled.

“Morning,” I croakily replied.

“Well, afternoon, actually,” My wife chuckled. “How’s your head feeling? Better, now you’ve slept it off?”

Strangely, I did feel better. I wondered whether Temnor’s induced amnesia had been giving me the migraines. I also realised that it was the same day — hours had passed, but Abigail was simply pretending nothing had happened. And when I looked to the hiding spot on a nearby shelf, I noticed my camera wasn’t there. She asked him to make me forget about filming myself too, I realised.

“What do you want to do today?” Abigail asked. “It’s the weekend, at long last.”

“Yeah… Well, firstly, I’m going to take my morning walk,” I quickly responded.

My wife frowned slightly, but her face quickly eased, and she nodded. Fortunately, I did like to stroll around the property every morning, so there was nothing out-of-the-ordinary about that. What had clearly aroused suspicion was the fact that my voice had been filled with such urgency.

Before Abigail had the opportunity to piece anything together, I was already out of the house. And I beelined straight for the car. I knew of a nearby road lined with oak trees, and all Temnor needed was a sliver of wood. The smallest amount, and he would be free. I would be free. And as I pulled down the driveway, I took a quick glance in my rear-view mirror.

Abigail was standing on the front steps.

“Shit,” I whispered, flooring the pedal.

She knew I was lying. She could read my face. And I knew that she was smart enough to figure out what that meant. But it was fine. I got away.

In fact, I shouldn’t ever return, I thought. She can’t have my body if I run.

“She can…” Temnor’s unmistakable voice whispered. “Wherever you go, she can summon your vessel at the mid point.”

I shrieked fearfully at the sudden sound in my head, and my eyes were drawn to the property’s passing lake. It lay just beyond a small cluster of trees — the small forest. And my body drained of all warmth when I spotted a lurking shape in the pines. Long-limbed, grey-eyed, and not quite human.

Casting my eyes back to the road, I floored the accelerator and slipped through the manor’s main gates. As I drove along the road of trees I had in mind, my mind raced with the possibilities of what my treacherous wife might be doing to reclaim control of my body.

After mounding a grassy bank at the foot of some oaks, I retrieved a pen knife from the glove compartment — I was thankful that we’d been on a recent camping trip. And I flew out of the car, scrambling up the hill to reach the nearest tree. With a swift flick of my tool, I had shaved a thin layer of wood from a mighty oak beside the road. I did not hesitate to jump back into the car and head home.

When I returned, however, the atmosphere of the manor felt different. I trundled tentatively through the main gates and dreaded what I might find at the lake. Abigail and Chris armed to the teeth, ready to massacre me on the spot. But finding nothing was worse. I didn’t know what my wife might be planning. I drove onto the grass, heading towards the trees which formed a barrier between the property and the lake.

That was when I saw them. Four figures, standing in a small clearing before the water. Is that Mr and Mrs Thorp? I wondered. How on Earth the matriarch and patriarch of the family had returned to life, I did not know. They were watching my car hesitantly approach.

“They’re going to take you,” Temnor whispered in my mind.

Petrified, I felt the yank of my body splitting from my soul, and I brought the car to a halt. And I watched as my mindless vessel of a body clambered out of the vehicle, walking across the grass towards the demented family waiting by the lake. Waiting by Temnor’s prison.

Reality swirled once more, throwing me into the place between places. The nightmarish, darkened world of lava and terror.

The horrifying being spoke from between two rock faces. “You failed, Noah Chapman. And now they have claimed you as a vessel once more.”

“Is my body in your prison?” I asked.

The being paused. “Yes… I am about to utilise your vessel to–”

“– The front pocket of my coat,” I whispered.

Temnor’s eyes glazed, as if he were viewing something in the real world. “Oakwood… I see. Your contract will be nullified, Noah Chapman. By the power vested in me, I unbind you from Abigail Chapman. I unbind you from the Thorps.”

As the world around me collapsed, so too did my spirit. It stretched into the endless abyss of blackness above me, and I woke on my knees in a dirt clearing by the lake. Surrounded by a small cluster of trees that the Thorps called a forest. Beneath me, there lay a downward, muddy slope concealed by shrubbery and trees. The place that had been Temnor’s jail for an untold length of time. Before me, I saw the line which marked the edge of his domain. But I was within it. No soul can step within my prison. But I wasn’t burning alive. I could tread across his land.

It was no longer his prison. I had freed him.

I ran through the trees, ignoring the early-evening sun that slipped behind the Thorp manor. I was free, spiritually, but I had free myself of that wretched family physically. I jumped in my car, still sitting with an open driver’s door on the grass. But it wasn’t the only car around. A hundred yards towards the house, Chris’ Ford GT was crumpled like paper in the front wall of Thorp Manor.

I wanted to escape, but I had to know. Had to be certain.

I drove back to the property, getting out of the vehicle and lighting my way with a phone torch. And there, sitting in a bloody mess behind the wheel, was Abigail’s baby brother. Chris Thorp was flattened like a revolting omelette between the mangled seat and the bonnet — what was left of the bonnet. His beloved car. One of the gifts Temnor had no doubt given.

Shaking, I found my feet moving towards the front door. I entered the well-lit property on janky legs and found a scene of utter chaos. Overturned furnishings, scratched walls, and demolished décor.

In the living room, I found two people I never expected to see again. Two people I scarcely believed I’d seen earlier.

Miranda and Harold. The late Thorp parents. They had, once more, become lifeless corpses.

Harold lay on his back, belly bulging and eyes bloodshot. Gold medallions were spilling out of his mouth. As I leaned more closely, eyeing the edge of particularly blood-stained right eye, I caught sight of what seemed to be a rotund shape squeezing into his eye socket. His entire body had been filled to the brim with coins. The wealth he no doubt acquired through sordid means.

And Miranda lay beside him, her body compressed into a gut-spilling mess. She had been constricted by the lavish dress she wore — a dress stained red, and somehow not torn at the seams. It had torn her at the seams.

“Abigail…” I muttered.

She was the real reason I returned. In spite of the horror she and her family had inflicted upon me, I still loved the woman. I still had to know what became of her. Temnor had slaughtered the others. I knew he wouldn’t have spared her. And when I reached our upstairs bedroom, my suspicions were confirmed. However, the scene was not what I expected.

My wife was still alive, but horribly so.

In our bed, Abigail lay in a wheezing state. She had aged beyond the years of any mortal being. Aged beyond comprehension. To the extent that it seemed cruel for Temnor to keep her alive. A punishment worse than anything the others had experienced.

“Noah…” My wife whispered, struggling to breathe with withered lungs in a crumbling body.

When I walked to Abigail’s bedside, I was scarcely brave enough to touch her, fearing that she might become an ashy mound in my fingers.

“Why did you do this?” I asked.

My wife tearfully mumbled. “I didn’t wish for cruel things, Noah. You have to–”

“– You did a monstrous thing to me,” I interrupted. “You stole my body. My soul. Made me a pawn that you could throw into the lion’s den.”

“Money that Dad spent poorly… Pretty things that turned Mum cold and callous… Successful investments that Chris squandered on hedonism and cruelty to others…” She coughed. “But I only wanted to bring them back. Mum and Dad. And then I… Well, I wanted you to love me forever. I wanted us to be together forever. Wanted you to love me unconditionally. I was… greedy too. This is his punishment. Killing me with age and heartbreak.”

“That’s a lot of wants, Abigail,” I whispered bitterly. “And they came at the expense of me.”

“No, it… It wasn’t going to hurt you…” Abigail whispered, eyes fading.

“Look what it did to all of you,” I said. “I only pray it upholds its end of the bargain.”

My wife’s eyes widened. “What did you say…? Bargain?”

“I–”

“– Did you strike a deal with Temnor? Did you free it?” She gasped near-soundlessly, barely clutching to life.

I nodded. “After you imprisoned him.”

“Imprisoned him…?” Abigail shuddered. “Is that what he told you? We found him, Noah. Locked away in the hovel… Somebody put him there long ago. For good reason.”

“You. Somebody else. I don’t really care, Abigail,” I sighed. “This was the only way to free myself.”

My wife produced a single tear — all she had left to give. “May something have mercy on your soul, Noah, for there is certainly no God left. This is Temnor’s domain now.”

As my wife faded into the pit of emptiness we all find at the end of the road, I reflected on her dying words. What use would there be in lying to me? Over the many weeks following her death, I keep wondering what she meant. Should I not have freed Temnor?

I know what he craved within his prison. What does he crave beyond [it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)
