[\[Part 13\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1aqy25g/the_children_of_the_oak_walker_part_13/)

Radio chatter buzzed inside the stuffy armored Humvee, and I could taste diesel exhaust on the back of my tongue, along with the tarry scent of cigarettes. The strap of a nylon seatbelt held me to the rough, cheap seat foam as we bumped along, and the bag over my head made every cough that much worse. I worried that if I started puking again, they wouldn’t take it off, and I’d be forced to swallow my own vomit. My stomach twisted in an angry knot, and I really wished I could find a bathroom. Worst of all, I couldn’t get the image of Jamie’s face out of my head, the sorrow in her eyes all the more infuriating to me from where I now sat.  
*She stole the beacon, she stole Chris, and in the end, she stole me. Lying snake. I wouldn’t be surprised if she sells my stuff on the market.*  
Seething, my upper lip awash in tears and snot from my betrayal, I tried to pick at the soft cuffs around my wrists, to no avail.  
A quarter of an hour later, and I was ready to beg them to stop just so I could relieve myself behind a tree, when the trucks slowed, and the noises outside changed.  
Brakes squeaked, something deep and metallic rumbled, and a Claxton horn bared in a few short blasts. Overhead, the shuddering of helicopter blades sliced through the air, and in the distance a faint, female voice droned on what sounded like loudspeakers.  
*“All citizens are reminded to register for daily wellness checks. Full compliance is mandatory. Please call our help center to begin your registration now.”*  
“Wish they’d turn that garbage off.” One of the soldiers in the truck spat, and he sounded tired, irritated even. “They talk about winning hearts and minds, then they go and play that stuff as loud as they can, first thing in the morning. Like, what kind of idiots are running this show? I swear, we knew more about what was going on in Iraq than this corporate circle-jerk.”  
“Bunch of pencil pushers calling the shots, man.” Another mercenary chimed in from somewhere to my right. “Little-man syndrome is strong with these morons. Did I tell you, three days ago, I had a suit scream in my face at checkpoint five because I wouldn’t strip-search a thirteen-year-old girl? Her dad was standing right there too, ready to throw down. Can you imagine what he’s thinking now? If that were my daughter, I’d rip someone’s throat out.”  
“Just put them on riot control once, and corporate would change their tune.” Someone shouted down from above, and I figured it was their man in the machine-gun turret.  
Another voice laughed from in front of me, likely in the driver’s seat. “I freakin wish, dude. They’re too worried about getting a Christmas bonus to be that self-aware. I tell you what, after this thing is over, I’m going back to Indianapolis and moving Beth and the kids as far from this nonsense as possible. Screw those tie-wearing psychos.”  
Feeling like a fly on the wall, I sat in my seat without speaking, curious yet still terrified. These men didn’t sound like evil henchmen from a video game or movie. If anything, they seemed as unhappy to be here as I was. How bad were things outside of New Wilderness that even ELSAR had discontent spreading through their ranks like wildfire?  
*Doesn’t make much of a difference for me though, does it? Like the one guy said, they aren’t the ones who paid for this. Are they going to strip-search me too, in front of everyone, like some kind of cam-girl?*  
Our vehicle sped up again, and began to make sharp turns, stops, and starts. Other sounds added to the ambience beyond the truck’s heavy metal doors, car horns, police sirens, and more of the automated female announcer’s morning lecture.  
*“By order of the Provisional Government, curfew is set at 6:00 PM. For your safety, please be inside your registered dwelling by that time, and remember to conserve energy usage. All violators will be prosecuted.”*  
At last, when I thought I would soil myself from the pressure in my stomach, the truck rolled to a stop, and the engine cut off.  
Someone opened my door, and they began to lift me out.  
“Bathroom.” I craned my head their way, blinded by the bag, but too desperate to try and put up a tough front. “I-I need to go. Please, it’s bad.”  
With a quick tug, the black cloth flew off my head, and I sucked down a cool gulp of fresh air.  
Rounding in front of me, the soldier who had radioed in about my scan watched me gasp for a moment, and his painted scowl softened. “Sure thing, kiddo. Right this way.”  
We were parked in a massive cinder-block garage, easily big enough for the four Humvees, with a few white-painted metal doors off to my right, and a red one to my left with a keypad on it. A blue plastic porta-let sat in one corner of the garage, and to this they led me, before the head soldier turned to unlock my cuffs.  
“Listen.” He held up a stubby cylindrical handcuff key, and his hard eyes stayed focused on mine. “I’m gonna take these off, but if you try anything funny, it’s going to be a bad day, yeah? You’re locked in here with us, there’s nowhere to go, and it’s not worth your life to try and hurt any of my boys. Behave yourself, and nothing bad happens. We clear?”  
*Crystal.*  
In silence I nodded, and he took the bonds off my hands, though the manacles on my ankles remained.  
Never in my life had I been so relieved to use a porta-potty. It was surprisingly clean and graffiti free, without the horrid smell I remembered them having from family trips to the state fair in Kentucky. It must have been brand new, as there weren’t even any spiders hiding in the toilet paper roll. I sat in there for a good ten minutes, and threw up for another four, until nothing else was left for my body to lose. The guards didn’t rush me, and when I emerged, flush-faced at the fact that they’d heard it all, the sergeant in charge put the cuffs on with my hands in front of me this time. He gave me a drink from his canteen, and I could see from the looks in their eyes that the men felt sorry for me.  
“We’ve got to hand you off to medical.” Walking me through one of the sets of metal doors on the right, the sergeant led me, flanked by his men, down a brightly lit white hallway. “And I’ll be honest with you kid, I’m not sure what happens from here on. Above my pay grade. But if I can give you any advice, it’s to do what you’re told. No screaming, no fighting, just comply. It’ll make everything easier.”  
My heart sank as two double doors ahead of me swung open, a team of nurses wheeling a stainless-steel gurney forward. What were they going to do? Did I want to know? Would it be better for me to try and grab at one of the soldiers’ guns, put the barrel in my mouth, and avoid the unknown?  
A gloved hand patted my shoulder, and the sergeant made a sad, guilty smile. “You were expensive. That’s a good thing. Means they need you alive, and healthy.”  
With that, he slid his arms under my shoulders and knees, picked me up like a sack of potatoes, and gently laid me out on the gurney’s foam pad.  
A needle poked into my left arm with a nasty sting, and I blinked against renewed tears, my heart racing in panic.  
*This is it then. They’re going to harvest my organs or put me down like a dog. I’m done for.*  
“It’s okay.” One of the orderlies leaned over me, his swarthy face covered in a surgical mask, the only thing visible being two dark brown eyes behind the plastic protective goggles. “I know it hurts. Just relax and keep looking at me.”  
The world fuzzed over, my muscles slackened, and try as I might, I couldn’t keep my left eye open. In a roar of static in my head, a tide of shadows swallowed me whole.  
*I ran through endless burned rooms lined with candles, the pictures blank save for hazy gray outlines of people. Heavy anxiety sat in my chest, the need to find something, but I couldn’t remember what. Broken shards of glass sliced open my bare feet, my lungs twitched with smoke that rose from somewhere unseen, and I made the mistake of looking behind me.*  
*Like an enormous black bird, he moved down the ruined halls with slow, deliberate strides, the canvas poncho hood obscuring his face, the wooden dagger held in his rotting hand. Vecitorak stalked toward me, and though I couldn’t see his face, I could feel the cruel smile in the air, his scuffed boots thudding on the cracked tiles as he went.*  
*“I own you.” He raised the dagger high. “There is no escape.”*  
*Too out of breath to scream, I hurtled down the halls, turning left, right, any direction to try and avoid him. However, it seemed he was always right on my heels no matter how far I went or how fast I sprinted, and my strength began to fail.*  
*An orange glimmer caught my eye somewhere ahead, and I lunged for it, sure that my salvation was at hand.*  
*Dashing into the room, I skidded to a stop, my heart seizing in torment.*  
*Jamie and Chris sat amongst a sea of candles, amorous sweat glistening on their bare skin, lithe bodies moving in tandem with one another. Chris’s muscled back was to me, but Jamie sat astride his lap with both slender legs locked around his waist. She caught my gaze from over Chris’s shoulder, and titled her head back so the loose blonde hair didn’t obscure her features.*   
*Her limbs tightened around Chris in a possessive grip, and Jamie let slide a long, venomous smirk.*  
*“Just one bite?” She hissed, green eyes aflame with wicked glee, and opened her mouth to expose a row of sharp wooden fangs.*  
*With an unnatural crunch, Jamie’s head snapped forward, and she sank her teeth into Chris’s neck.*  
*He never screamed, never so much as flinched, and the two of them continued with their lovemaking even as rivers of scarlet red poured from the gaping wound in Chris’s throat. Soon, they were both coated in it, the crimson tide rising so that some of the candles began to extinguish under frothy red waves.*  
*Deep in my heart, I felt my soul tear in two, and I spun around to flee.*   
*Vecitorak’s clammy hand closed over my windpipe, and his grimy fingers pried open my jaw.*   
*Helpless, I hung by his grasp, and torrents of black roots slithered into my mouth with a rushing like water.*  
My eyes flew open, and I fought a wave of panic.  
I lay on my back, something soft like rubber underneath me, my skin bare and clean. The air seemed thick and close, my breaths hard to draw, and I realized there was something plastic stuck in my mouth, a long smooth thing that went down my throat. I wanted to gag, but my esophagus wouldn’t contract, and none of my limbs obeyed my commands. It occurred to me that I couldn’t so much as command a twitch from myself, my head locked in place, and even my eyelids refused to lower. Of all things, my eyes could still move, the left seeing everything, and the right swiveled in its sludge-filled socket without transmitting any signal to my muddled brain.  
*The sound . . . I can still hear the sound.*  
Flicking my eye down, I had to strain just to see since my head wouldn’t tilt, but it didn’t take much to send icy dread through my veins.  
A clear round plastic tube encompassed the strange rubber bed I lay on, completely sealed as far as I could see. Black spigots lined the sides of my body, and from these gushed streams of bright blue fluid that pooled under my arms, legs, and neck. Just on the other side of the tube’s walls, a team of mask-wearing people in white lab coats watched with keen eyes as the fluid levels rose higher. They spoke with hand motions and nods, though I couldn’t hear a word they were saying from inside the tube, but I didn’t need to hear the words to understand what they were about to do.  
The tube was filling up with water.  
They were going to drown me.  
*Help.*  
I tried to scream, but my mouth stayed frozen in place, and the rubbery pipes down my gullet blocked any cries or groans. With a pleading gaze, I stared out at the staff members outside my Plexiglas coffin, in a last-minute attempt to let them know I was still alive, still conscious, still breathing.  
One of them, a man with dark eyes that I recognized from the gurney, met my gaze.  
Discomfort rippled through what sparse sections of his face I could see behind his mask, and the man dropped his head to feign looking at a clipboard in his hand.  
Up the sides of my face the blue ripples crept, warm and sticky, like some kind of liquid silicone.   
A few trickles spilled over the corners of my mouth, and I started to choke.  
*Smoke closed in, dense black clouds all around me as the walls crumbled, the paint peeled off the bricks, and the ceiling tiles melted in fiery dribbles. My body ached, stabs and slices pricking me all over, and I wept over the rubble I crawled on, trying my best to find a way out.*  
*A raspy cackle burst from behind me, and Vecitorak’s boots stomped closer on the chunks of broken flooring. “You know it is inevitable. Our time will come. Your world will burn.”*  
*My bleeding elbows plunged over a clear threshold, and I rolled into another room.*  
*Barely had I sat up and there they were again, Chris and Jamie, covered only by candlelight. It killed me to see it, like a blade to my heart, and I hung my head as sobs ripped their way out of my sore lungs.*  
*“He’s lying to you, Hannah.”*  
*A soft tone whispered to me from the smoke, and I looked up to see the man in the yellow chemical suit standing to my right.*  
*I stared at him, confused, in agony, desperate for this terrible ordeal to end. “I s-saw them.”*  
*He knelt beside me, and the man pulled off one of his rubber gloves to cup my face in a hand as cool as spring raindrops. “Your pain is blinding you, filia mea. Trust me, and not him. Look closer.”*  
Murky blue clouded my vision, both ears filled with the dull whizzing and whining of tiny electric gears. Strange feelings competed for what sensory perception I had left, though they all felt muted, distant, vague. Fine scratches on the bones in my ribs. Sharp little tugs inside my belly, like a dozen tiny fingers. Constant, even pressure in my lungs that left a weightless sensation in my chest. Cold tendrils wriggled between my right eye and the eyelids around it. Suction plunged in my right ear, as something pushed into it.  
A shape appeared opposite me, a willowy outline in the gloom of the swirling blue. It looked like a figure, motionless and pale, but with much of its middle encased in darkness.  
My left eye no longer moved according to my command, and with it stuck facing forward, I was forced to watch the image come into focus.  
Reflected in the blue glow, a girl lay with her white limbs outstretched, wrists and ankles held down by black straps. She floated right over me, but her brown hair lay in a halo around her head, suspended in the buoyancy of the fluid. The one hazel eye I could see lay open, unblinking, and her nude body didn’t move a muscle. Angular objects moved around her in busy clusters, skinny, linear shadows that glinted and gleamed in the dim light. They gave off small ebony clouds as they moved around her, many huddled over her midsection, others around her right arm, one or two around her head.  
Somehow, my left eyeball shifted so that our gazes met, and trapped within the back of my own head, I at last gave in to utter despair.  
It was a reflection, *my* reflection, in the plexiglass canopy of the tube.  
Metal arms moved with precise jabs, slashes, and scrapes, like some kind of iron centipede digesting its prey. Each cut gave off a thin cloud of my blood, and this was filtered out of the surrounding fluid by other arms with nozzles seemingly built for that sole purpose. The skin of my abdomen lay splayed open, pinkish intestines adrift in the fluid, anchored to rubber hooks mounted to support arms that kept them from knotting together. Together the hive of self-driven steel burrowed into me, sliced through the red muscles, pinched off the dark blue arteries, and sawed into chunks of body fat like miniature coal miners. One arm bore several cable-like tendrils that buried under my milky right eye, and other probes were sunk into the ear on the same side, down my throat, and up my nose. Their work safe in the cocoon of warm, stagnant liquid, the machines worked to disassemble me bit-by-bit, and as the reality of my fate settled in, so did the pain.  
Hot as the sun, it crippled every other thought I might have had, scorched my nerves, and burned into my brain with nuclear explosiveness. Incapable of screaming, my body being taken apart before my very eyes, I felt myself drowning in the blue fluid that filled my lungs, yet I did not die. I couldn’t so much as excise some of the feeling through a deep gasp, a screech, a cry for mercy, due to every part of me being completely paralyzed. Agony became my existence as the torture continued, broken only when some part of my mind couldn’t take it anymore, and pulled me back to the safety of my subconscious.  
*I tripped over a loose ceramic tile on the floor, and tumbled into the next room, coughing and hacking on the smoke.*  
*Thanks to the eager moans, I already knew where I was without even having to look at them.*  
*“They are good together, aren’t they?” Vecitorak sneered from somewhere in the black fog, and as if encouraged by his words, Jamie and Chris grew louder. “Without you, their lives are perfect. Why fight for a world that never wanted you?”*  
*I pressed both hands to my ears and shouted in an effort to drown out the malicious noises. “Leave me alone!”*  
*“I told you.” His laugh closed on me, high and triumphant. “I already—”*  
*“Enough! Be silent.” The command boomed through the dark like cannon fire, shook the building underneath me, and both Vecitorak, along with the image of Jamie and Chris, vanished.*  
*Caring hands smoothed over my hair, and a paternal sigh called to me through the haze. “Look closer.”*  
*I dared to obey, and instead of seeing Chris and Jamie locked in a lover’s embrace, I saw Jamie, fully clothed, sitting by herself on the memorial floor, both hands covering her face. Judging from the empty whiskey bottle by her feet, it had to be after I’d seen her and Chris, but it wasn’t nearly the result I expected.*  
*She had her knees drawn up to her chest, and Jamie choked back sobs from behind her hands, as she whispered to herself over and over again. “There has to be a way, there has to be.”*  
*The man in the chemical suit walked over to her and brushed some of Jamie’s bleach-blonde hair from her face, though she didn’t seem to notice his presence.*  
*He leaned forward, whispered something in her ear, and Jamie sat bolt upright, a determined look crossing her ashen countenance.*  
*“There’s gotta be something. Something we missed. I-I have to try.” She jumped to her feet, staggering as she kicked the empty bottle, and bolted out the door.*  
*Dizziness nibbled at the corners of my vision, but the stranger’s gray eyes shone in a tender smile. “Do you see now?”*  
*“See what?” I sniffled, mind reeling, limbs stuck to my sides as if welded there.*  
*Behind him a light appeared in the smoke, white, powerful beams that blasted the shadows away.*  
*Backlit in the aura of the dazzling glow, the man stretched his hand out to help me to my feet, both silver eyes shining at me in expectation. “Oh, Hannah. You have no idea how loved you are. Open your eyes.”*  
“Hannah? Can you hear me? Can you open your eyes?”  
I awoke to a blinding cascade of white and had to shield my eyes with one hand. Colors gradually molded into shapes, the lines of a celling, walls, and floor. Soft, cool cloth covered me from the chest down, and I drew an involuntary breath. The air smelled the way distilled water tasted; clean, yet odd, devoid of its natural flavors. Somehow, it made me think of being inside a massive test tube.  
All around me, the walls rose in barren white planes of some chemical-resistant plastic interlaced seamlessly with the floor and ceiling. These too were done in the same material, with various soft lights in recessed trenches along the ceiling to make the room seem like one big fluorescent light bulb. It wasn’t a large room by any means, but still bigger than my old one at New Wilderness. I couldn’t see any other furniture save for the bed underneath me, and as I craned my head, I realized it was more of a stainless-steel bunk bolted to the wall rather than a proper bedstead.  
I slowly rolled to one side, pushed myself up, and paused in surprise.  
*That . . . that didn’t hurt.*  
Looking down, I found myself clothed in a set of white scrubs like a nurse might wear, but without any strings or zippers. My skin stood out in skinny, peach-pink limbs, and as I shifted to sit up, something on my right arm caught my attention.  
In swirling lines of silver so fine that it sometimes turned invisible, a series of vines and leaves were intricately painted on my skin. They wound their way up my arm, and under the short sleeve of my scrub top, as perfect if they had really grown there. Stunned, I blinked at the sight for a few brief seconds.  
*No way.*  
I blinked again, and couldn’t help but gasp at a new discovery, no longer focused on my skin.  
I could *see*. I could see out of my right eye.  
Half-afraid it would all be another bizarre dream, I clawed at my shirt, and pulled the scrub top up to expose my stomach and chest.  
The cruel black tendrils had vanished, the swollen skin smooth, the crusty stab-wound erased. For the first time in days, I felt no pain, no itching, no nausea in my guts. No foul gorge of mucous rose in my throat, no dry cough or dizziness. Instead, the strange designs continued down from my right shoulder, intricate sprigs inked over the former tendrils under my breasts, and danced along my ribs like they were trellises. Small flower blossoms were stenciled over the site of the stab wound in a concentric circle, and as I pressed my fingers to them, I felt slight raised skin where the scars had melded flesh back together.  
“Hannah?”  
Jumping despite myself, I jerked my shirt down and swung my head up to scan around for the source of the voice. “H-Hello?”  
Across the room from me, tiny lines appeared in the wall. They grew bigger and split away from each other until a narrow door swung outward to allow a solitary figure inside.  
He looked to be in his mid-forties, with the beginnings of gray in his neatly kempt hair around the ears, the rest of it black as night. The man’s face bore the sharp features and pale skin of a European, and his eyes were pools of dark brown that almost matched his hair in shade. A white laboratory coat hung around his proud shoulders, and under it he sported a well-pressed granite-gray suit, with an onyx tie pin in the shape of a crow stuck through his silver necktie.   
Both of the leather-brown eyes stared at me with a curious wonder that I couldn’t quite understand, and the man held out a fancy plastic water bottle with squared edges. “Would you like something to drink?”  
Drawn like a magnet by the offer, I stepped away from my bunk, and both legs gave out under me with rubbery tingles from my bellybutton on downward.   
“Careful, careful now.” In a flash, the man was at my side, and helped ease me back to a seated position. “Your neurochemical balance is only now reaching normal levels. It took longer than we’d thought, but then again, considering what you’ve been through, it all makes sense.”  
None of it made any sense to me, but I unscrewed the cap with trembling hands to gulp down several delicious mouthfuls. After so much pain, I shut my eyes to let myself bask in the pleasure of sating my thirst. I could almost feel it humming through my body, the air on my skin more poignant, the sheets softer, the floor tiles cooler.  
*I don’t care if this is a dream, it’s fantastic.*  
When I opened my eyes, the stranger sat watching me from his place on the bedside, and my skin heated up in slight embarrassment. “Thanks.”  
“Not a problem.” He inspected me with a precise, learned gaze, and something about him emitted a collegial air. “Do you feel any pain anywhere? Any movement or discomfort under your skin?”  
I shook my head and did my best not to tear up at how good it felt to be able to say that.  
“May I examine your arm, please?” He gestured to my right one.  
Extending my wrist, I let him turn it over to look at the ink stencils, and he pressed tender fingers along the vines.  
“Any pain here? Or here?” He eyed me as he went from my wrist, to my upper arm, to my ribs with his search, though he never strayed anywhere uncomfortable, and didn’t put his hands under my clothes like I’d heard of some doctor’s doing. I decided he must be a true medical man, some sort of high-powered professional, though what that meant for me was still anyone’s guess.  
“No.” I shook my head again, amazed as more of the tingling faded from my lower body, and my knees regained their feeling. My body was warm. I was warm and in only a set of scrubs!  
Satisfied, the man produced a small clipboard from his coat pocket and wrote something down amongst an already cluttered sea of scribbles. “Excellent. And your right eye, any blurriness of vision, and difficulty seeing?”  
I blinked deliberately this time, and looked around at the room to check. “No. Everything is clear . . . really clear.”  
Despite the glaringly white surfaces and their lights, I started to see things I never would have noticed before. There were ripples in the plastic sheeting from where it had been bent, a crack where a worker hadn’t fitted a piece of siding on correctly, and even a difference in shade where one of the ceiling bulbs had begun to short out. Everything leapt out to me in such detail, as if I had some kind of high-power lens in my skull, that I couldn’t do anything other than stare.  
*What kind of drugs did they put me on?*  
“I can only imagine.” The man chuckled and pointed to my arm with his pen. “I hope you don’t mind the ink. The surgery left so many scars that even with skin grafts they didn’t heal flawlessly, so one of our intern’s ideas suggested this as a cosmetic adjustment.”  
Now that he mentioned it, I could see the scars concealed beneath the tattoos, lines of slightly denser flesh that sealed together over hundreds of narrow scalpel slices. They crisscrossed my arm and torso under the ink like roots to a tree, and I thought back to the orderly who had looked down at me on the gurney with sympathy in his eyes, the voice ringing in my head.  
*It’s okay. I know it hurts.*  
“You cut it out.” I turned my right arm over, held it up in the light to examine the pathways their blades had taken through my flesh. “And with no stitches. How?”  
Rising to his feet, the man offered me his hand with a gentlemanly flourish. “If you’ll allow me, I’d be happy to show you.”  
At first, I reached for it, but a prickle of unease forced me to hesitate. I had been so relieved, so startled to find myself put back together that I hadn’t thought to ask this total stranger (who had likely seen me lift my shirt to my chin) the most basic of questions. It didn’t seem possible that I could be alive after what had been done to me in that horrible machine, but this certainly didn’t feel like a dream.  
*I have to find out what’s going on. If I’m still here, then the sergeant was right; they don’t want me dead. I just need to keep the conversation simple and look for a way out.*  
“Who are you?” I swallowed, and palmed for my water bottle just so I could have something to hide my nervous smile behind. “What is this place?”  
His brown eyes glimmered in a proud, secretive sort of way, and the man made a crisp Victorian bow. “My name is Koranti, George M. Koranti. I’m the chief executive officer for the Environmental Liminal Space Alleviation and Reduction Program. Welcome to ELSAR, Miss Brun.”
