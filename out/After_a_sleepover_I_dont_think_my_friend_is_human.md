Okay, I'm Lizzie, and I'm a high schooler, I am a bit creeped out by my friend, Mika. Mika is a cute girl, a Japanese girl living in America. She's a pretty girl with a narrow, triangular face. She's very cheerful and tends to be really touchy with me, but I always feel a little drained when I hang with her. I wish she could come to my house but she says she doesn't visit anyone who has a dog. She has some weird habits, which are a bit cute, but still.

She once bit me softly to be...cute, I think?

She can be a real asshole. She has a tendency to mess with and lie to people. Like, one time, she somehow managed to get a guy to eat woodchips. I don't know how she did that, but she was bragging to everyone about it at lunch. She NEVER answers the phone, which is weird because I know she has a phone because she keeps messing around with her phone during class and the teachers just...Do not care?? She tells me stories about medieval times, but says them in ways that make them sound less like old legends and more like funny memories. Even when it's something like "AND THEN HE KILLED HER!"

Also, I know she's probably into the furry fandom, as she has this weird clip on (?) tail that moves as if it were real that she sometimes comes to school with before taking it off in the bathroom, and when surprised she screams in a way that sounds like a very angry wild animal. Her laugh sounds like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQVhppRP4Wo), which is cute, but weirds me out. She once said "I'm cat software running on dog hardware with a dolphin soundboard, but with a human external drive."

All of this is just...weird, but here's an encounter with her I had this weekend. She invited me to a sleepover at her house, and I went there. She didn't give me directions, she just said "You'll know it when you see it. It's a giant mansion!" After 20 minutes of walking, I saw a huge mansion, and she hugged me, telling me to come in. Parents were nowhere in sight, which was weird for a sixteen year old. She said they were on a business trip for the weekend. That sleepover was exciting, but also weird. I found a bunch of red hair piles in random places that didn't seem like human hair (she has black hair), and I always felt weirdly tired, as if some part of my energy had just been...stolen.

But what really convinced me she wasn't human was, when I went to bed, I woke up...on a mattress in a landfill, with her nowheere in sight. I passed out while walking home due to how exhausted I was (which was odd, as I was asleep for a while..) and was taken back home. I'm a bit afraid of Mika now...did she teleport me to a landfill or something?

She has also done many other creepy things, which may be rumors. Apparently, she hung out in the woods near our small town and invited a guy out to hang out with her, and he went missing for 2 weeks, and was so traumatized from whatever he saw that he hasn't gone back to school since. He also seems to have a pathological addiction to her.

She always eats the same thing every day, and pretty much every guy at school has a mega crush on her. They always give her gifts. She absolutely freaks out and screams like a banshee every time someone touches her necklace...Oh, I didn't mention she ALWAYS wears a necklace with a dark black and purple pearl (i think) pendant. Because she does. And sometimes it looks like something's moving in front of it. She calls it her "starbit".

All of this easily convinces me, this girl is not a human.

Does anyone have an idea what she is? Like is she a fae or something?
