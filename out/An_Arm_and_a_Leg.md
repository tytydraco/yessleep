Word Document 1:
Hi there, the name’s Edward Finnic. I’m an investigative journalist from Reno, Nevada. I don’t know if you’re all familiar with my work but I mostly cover topics such as corporate corruption and government scandals. I think I found an interesting lead about a company called Collective Bios Inc. They specialize in privatized healthcare and research into prosthetics. 

What got me interested in them? For those of you reading my work for the first I suppose you wouldn’t be aware of the fact that I’m very much a unique individual. You see, I’ve only got one and a half arms and barely a leg to stand on..... That’s a terrible joke by the way, my right leg only goes down as far as above the knee and my left only halfway down my shin. My right arm is reduced to a stub below the elbow and my left is the only working part of my body. Thank god I’m a lefty!

Among these wonderful circumstances I also have 70% hearing loss in my right ear and 40% in my left as well as near total blindness in my right eye and less than perfect vision in my left. I have to wear hearing aids and thick prescription glasses to function but it’s not so bad once you get used to it. I make it sound worse than it is honestly, I get by. I work out very regularly, including my stumps so I don’t get muscle atrophy from my damn wheelchair. 

I’m 34 now but I’ve been this way since I was 22. My appearance actually helped my game with... partners.... maybe they feel bad or maybe they want to try something weird but I’m ok with it, everything still works like it should. As I said, I work out so I’m as fit as I can be. I always was an admittedly good looking guy and the incident didn’t do much to my face other than some shrapnel scars, my tattoos cover lots of those scars.

You may be wondering how I wound up with shrapnel scars. Well, I was a proud marine just serving his country in Afghanistan in 2008. I was always athletic and was named the most promising recruit before my tour. My unit was sent on surveillance to gather intel on a VIP. We had managed to slip into an enemy camp and proceeded to spy on them, unbeknownst to us they knew we were there. Before we could react a firefight ensued and took out some of my men, leaving us pinned in place. 

We had radioed for an emergency evacuation when one of the bogies shot a rocket from an RPG right next to the vehicle I was behind. The ensuing explosion had propelled my body and the truck about 20 feet away. Miraculously enough, my spine was ok but after waking up from my blackout I could see that my arm and both feet were pinned under the truck, crushed completely. The shrapnel also pelted my body in places, including my right eye and the sound mostly deafened me. My squad immediately got to work to pull me out as backup arrived to help evacuate us.

Once I had reached a point in the recovery process that I could function on my own - after years of mental and physical therapy - I finally started to try and live my new life again. My physical therapist - Evan - and I grew to be great friends over the years. When my therapy was done he let me move in with him. He needed extra help with rent, I needed a place to stay and it didn’t hurt he knew exactly what I needed help with and when I needed it. He got me through my darkest times when I wanted to end it all out of depression and frustration and come out on the other side a better man. I see the humor in it all and count my blessings that things weren’t worse, they definitely could have turned out that way.

Evan encouraged me to get the job I’ve been doing now over the last 5 years and I love it. Whether I’m doing a piece about the good or bad in a business, you can be sure I give my honest opinions and get to the truth. It’s not hard to book those essential interviews and meetings as well as get full VIP access to places when you’re a decorated, injured veteran. It’s definitely worked to my advantages for sure. 

So enough with my backstory, you want to know why I’m so interested in Collective Bios Inc. (I’m shortening it to CBI from now on) right? An avid reader of my work has contacted me, saying he needs to meet with me and discuss the amazing things going on with this company. I’ve agreed to meet him for lunch across the street from my apartment in about.... 20 minutes from the time of writing this. You can imagine how long it takes me to type this with one hand at this point I’m sure. I should really look into speech to text for the future.

Word Document 2:
I just got back from meeting my source. You can bet how surprised I was when I met a man who was also missing an arm (his left). He had an extremely rare condition in his eyes called heterochromia. Basically one eye was strikingly blue and the other a light brown. He told me he was chosen by CBI in Sacramento, among many applicants to test their new advanced prosthetics. 

He told me that him and about two dozen other arm amputees were all brought into a room where they could all sit at a table to sign many, many pages of legal documents: waivers, NDA’s and the sort to even look at the product. I’ve left his name anonymous so he doesn’t face the legal repercussions (if he even is a he wink wink). He said that there were many more pages afterwards to agree to testing.

After what was undoubtedly an eternity of signing they were all brought into a white room, not unlike a lab. The prosthetic was brought out and he described it as being almost indistinguishable from a real arm. They were capable of replicating the skin tone of whoever held it, had small arm hairs, freckles or whatever blemishes a real arm would have. The researchers assured them that they can also take your fingerprints you used to have if they are on a record somewhere or make custom ones based off your DNA. Finally, they apparently can attach sensors to your nerve endings in your arms that send sensations from the prosthetic to your mind. In essence, it was a real arm to the touch and to wearers. 

A woman was the only one out of the 24 candidates that actually got to demonstrate the arm. As promised, over the course of about a minute it changed to match her skin tone and her nails changed to match the other hand. The arm reduced in size to fit her petite frame perfectly. After some mild pain and discomfort from the nodes attaching, she claimed that she could feel everything on the arm. Her tears of joy were enough to get everyone else desperate to get one. The only thing that wasn’t right was there was a crease were the arm met the real body. They were assured that this was just a prototype and they intended on using skin grafting to permanently bond the arm to give back people’s limbs for good. The researchers told everyone that they would have to come back tomorrow to get theirs.

The way he described them with such enthusiasm made me salivate at the thought of talking to CBI about their new “miracle product.” If I could verify the advancement in prosthetic technology to the degree they were promising, then I wouldn’t be doing my due diligence as a journalist to get the word out there! If they are phonies then I have an excuse to expose their fraudulent claims and end their money making schemes.

I made a hands free phone call with the PR manager of CBI and he was happy to oblige my meeting with the general manager of their Sacramento location by tomorrow morning. That’s about a two and a half hour drive but the way Evan drives it’s more like 2. I can check out this place for myself and maybe get a juicy insider scoop on this place.

Word Document 3:
After pulling up to the front doors, Evan let down my lift and told me that he was gonna go to one of the malls for a bit while I did this (he wasn’t invited in). He embraced me and touched my cheek as I shyly brushed him off. As soon as I wheeled through the door a grinning man was waiting at the desk. He was very unnerving with his nonstop smile and uncanny look about him. 

“Hi there Mr. Finnic! Mr. Piper will be here to see you shortly! Please grab these release papers and fill them out!”

His voice was very chipper and enthusiastic as he motioned fifteen feet to his left. The grin never leaving his face and barely blinking. His movements were also off, like when there’s a few frames missing in a movie. Subtle but noticeable. I didn’t want to take my eyes of him but felt I shouldn’t be rude. 

“Please have a seat over in our guest waiting area!”

I moved the chairs controls to go that direction. To try to break the tension I decided on a quip, “I’m already sitting, but thanks for the suggestion.”

He only responded with a very unnerving “Oh!” Followed by a cackle and an unnatural rocking motion that kind of resembled a regular human-being laughing at something hilarious. Deciding to try and take my mind off of him I looked through the contract and read each line before signing. It felt like a Herculean effort not to turn back and look at the guy and keep signing. It was really basic stuff like any recording devices must be approved by CBI and that I understand I can’t take their property - you get it, nothing out of the ordinary.

After what felt like eternity - but was realistically only fifteen minutes - I heard the sound of dress shoes walking down the hall behind the double door by the desk. I rubbed my eyes under my glasses as the strain from reading was starting to give me a headache. After a few moments a man walked through, a very normal looking man in a nice suit. Slicked back hair, likely of middle eastern decent but no accent. No weird uncanny valley stuff here.

“Mr. Finnic, it’s good to finally meet the man I’ve been hearing about.” He reached out his left, which I shook. 

“Likewise, hopefully nothing but good news I hope.” I responded, “Mr. Piper I presume?”

He nodded, big smile (natural at least), “Rasheed from my mother and Piper from my father. I’ve been reading your articles about all of these companies. You like to air their dirty laundry for the world to see, don’t you?”

“Well I wouldn’t exactly say I’m-“

“Nonsense! Eddie - may I call you Eddie? - I appreciate the hard work you put in,” he didn’t even give me a chance to respond, “This honest journalism is sorely needed in today’s world. You give glowing recommendations to those that deserve and condemn the malpractices of those that don’t. I respect the truth, Eddie! We need more people like you! Tell it like it is! I assure you all of our secrets are out in the open! Come! Let’s discuss further in my office.”

He grabbed my papers, turned and walked to the double doors, the assistant - still smiling that smile - grabbed them and pressed a button to make the doors open. I looked back at the guy as I passed.

Rasheed noticed my sideways glance at the man, “I see you’ve met Patrick! I know it’s weird for most people when they meet him for the first time. Your glasses probably don’t let you see as well as you would like I’m sure. He’s completely automated! The same robotics that goes in our prosthetics is used in lots of our robo-staff!” He laughed out loud, “Clearly we haven’t quite gotten him to the point of being perfectly passable but we’re close!”

So he WAS a robot! That closed the door to that question but opened many more mysteries that needed solving.

I followed Rasheed down the hallway, he was still talking away and laughing at his own jokes but didn’t seem to care if I was paying attention (I wasn’t), he was just happy to talk. I studied my surroundings and noticed that every room was visible from the hall with glass, it was easy to see lab equipment and people hard at work. A group of medical students were being taken on a tour through the facility, being lead by another robot-person. CBI seemed to be passing the sniff-test so far, the lack of secrecy put my mind at ease a bit.

As we passed by one of the conference rooms I noticed all of the amputees in the waiting room in various stages of socializing. So workers that were prepping them for their new limbs were joking and being very personable with them. My source and I locked eyes and he waved and smiled, I instantly looked away to avoid implicating him or myself. I’m sure the cameras picked that up. It was a good thing I turned my gaze back ahead as I almost drove right into Rasheed. He didn’t seem to notice.

“...And here we are. Mi casa! Come on in.”

He opened the door and I was almost disappointed to see a very neat and plain office. There was a photo of him with a woman and a kid I assumed was his family. There was also a signed baseball encased in glass on his desk. Again nothing suspicious, just a legitimate man.

“So Eddie, can I get you something to drink?”

“Actually a water would be nice.”

He reached over to a speaker and held a button, “Ruby, can I get a water for our guest please?”

A voice crackled over the speaker, “Right away, Mr. Piper.”

Leaning back into his chair he clasped his hands and leaned back in a relaxed pose, “What do you think of the facilities?”

“They’re quite nice actually, it’s nice to see people coming and going freely and having a good time on the job.”

“I’m happy to hear that! Please, if you have any questions now is the time. We have nothing to hide and I’m open to discussing whatever. We just want you to know that we’re genuinely looking to help make people better. And you can quote me on that!” 

He chuckled at that last part. ‘Help make people better?’ What an odd way the phrase ‘helping people’. Before I could think too much about it the door opened. A younger woman came in through the door carrying a bottle of water. Her hair and makeup were impeccable. A pretty smile was on her face. No flaws anywhere. “Here’s your water, Mr. Finnic.” 

Her movements were slightly off and her eyes were also not exactly right. She was also a robot, I assumed. She was much closer to realistic than Patrick, but still just weird enough that my gut feeling was telling me something was off. I smiled at her as naturally as I could force myself and took my drink, “Thank you.”

She reached down and grasped the lid and turned it. The force from her grip deformed the bottle a bit, she was apparently not quite fully calibrated for strength. Her smile never left her face as she winked, “My pleasure, Mr. Finnic.”

With my poor eyesight it was clear that she was impeccably flawless. From a distance I’m sure other young men would find her quite attractive. I was focused on how the skin wasn’t quite right, the teeth too white and her lips were permanently colored red, no lipstick involved. If I didn’t know better she looked exactly like a stereotypical housewife from the 1950’s, dressed like it too. In fact, all the robo-people were dressed like that when I really think back.

Still cheerful, Rasheed spoke, “Thanks Ruby.”

“Will there be anything else, Mr. Piper?” Her sing song voice sounded too natural for the body. So did Patrick’s now that I think about it.

“We’re good here, run along now.”

She smiled at me again and walked out.

“Ruby is part of our second run of robots, as you could tell we were not quite all the way there with realistic people in that batch. Patrick was part of the first so he’s a little more noticeably fake.” He took a sip of his brandy from his desk and sat back again.

“I gotta ask...” I tried to get the words out.

“About the robots, right? Ruby is anatomically correct as most men want to know I’m sure. Patrick though is like a Ken doll.”

“I… Wasn’t even thinking-“

Rasheed burst out laughing, “I know you weren’t Eddie, I’m only teasing! But for real though, if you want a girlfriend from the next generation we’re working on maybe we can arrange something!” He winked and took another sip of brandy.

“Ya... not so much interested in that…”

“Being serious Eddie,” I hated how casual he was with me, “We developed them in conjunction with the prosthetics to see how realistic we could make them. You know, test out the physical sensation sensors, skin tones and movements without putting actual humans at risk.”

This made sense to me, “So you’ve pretty much just started the testing phase for humans, then?”

“Exactly! We just reached a point where safety isn’t a concern at all. Beyond a mild discomfort for the sensor nodes to attach themselves to your nerves, it’s painless!”

He proceeded to explain everything that my contact did earlier. By the end he left out an important detail. “....And with advanced skin grafting techniques it makes a seemless skin to skin match. No one will know you have a prosthetic.”

Without thinking I blurted out, “But right now there’s a noticeable crease where joints meet right?”

His smile disappeared for only an instant, but a half smile came back just as quick. I immediately regretted sharing something I shouldn’t have known. “Well I suppose that is an issue on the current prototype, but no one has seen it yet.”

Thinking fast, “I just assumed that was case since you mentioned the skin grafting. That would likely only happen later I assume.” Nice catch.

Full smile again, “Absolutely!..... would you like to see it?”

He lead me into another room further down, different from where all the other amputees were. Inside were some men in suits and lab coats. There were some suitcases: One large and two small. I was weary going in but they were acting casually, drinking and talking. They looked our way and politely turned to us, ending their conversations. 

“Afternoon gents.” Rasheed greeted the guests. Some nodded back. “I take it that the drive in was alright.”

One man spoke up, “This must be the subject?”

Subject? Me? What was he talking about?

Rasheed spoke up and turned to me, “I know this might seem as a surprise, but of course Mr. Litwick had to speak out of line and ruin it.” He glared towards Litwick’s direction and smiled back at me. 

“What’re you talking about?” I questioned.

“I apologize for the ruined surprise but we wanted to ask you - with your permission of course - if you wanted to be our first client with our latest tech.”

I was flabbergasted, “I can’t afford that!”

A woman spoke up, “Nonsense, like our other volunteers from the control group you won’t be charged a penny.” Not a bad idea. “...In fact.... we are willing to pay you handsomely for the privilege of being the first successful subject.”

I noticed that Rasheed had went over to a security guard in the room and whispered something in his ear. The man nodded and walked out immediately, talking on his ear-piece. I turned my focus back to the group.

“But I was told that your prosthetics are only in the testing phase.”

Another man in a lab coat answered, “That’s only for the consumer model, the core product has already been designed.”

Rasheed joined back in, shit-eating grin on his face, “Lots of the other items we have with us today are already available by other companies. We partnered with other like-minded businesses to help build our ‘Bots’.”

“Why me?”

“You’re a decorated war veteran who lost a lot serving our country. You’re also an influential and well-regarded journalist who people trust to give them the truth. We just want word to spread of the good we’re doing here!”

I was kind of just stunned, sitting in silence contemplating. Get working limbs back and get paid for it. It was too good to be true.

The woman spoke again, “I know it seems too good to be true,” she had to say it, “But you must trust us here. Let us show you. I’m Justine Linden, CEO of SmartEyes Inc.” 

She kind of curtsied a little and moved to the first suitcase. I had heard about their contacts that can record what someone sees for video footage. It even edited out the blinks when watching it back. The suitcase had two sets of what looked to be contacts of some sort. Justine continued, “With these new contacts, you will have natural 20/20 vision again.”

“While I’m wearing them?”

“No, they bond completely to your eye seemlessly. Never needing to be changed or removed. They can’t be taken out. This set is yours as of today.”

“Maybe my hearing aids aren’t set right, you’re saying that my sight will be back. No glasses?”

Litwick interjected, “That’s right. Speaking of your hearing aids, you won’t need those either.”

The next suitcase opened up and there was two small disks the size of small watch batteries in the large case. I was awestruck at what exciting news was next.

“These devices - provided by Hearing and Wellness Enterprises - will permanently act as your replacement eardrums. They are completely water proof and act like the real thing, without the danger of losing your hearing again. They auto-calibrate within Nanoseconds to react to noise so it’s always at the most comfortable by the time your brain receives the signal. You could go to a shooting range or watch a live concert and have it always be a comfortable level.

The other suitcase was left completely shut. “And what about that one?”

Rasheed answered, “Its just more parts for something else we’ve been working on.... are you ready!?”

I could only nod and hardly contain my anticipation. I know I should have been skeptical and cautious but the excitement and adrenaline clouded my judgement. The man in the lab coat grabbed the contacts with a special device. As he approached me he said to remain still and remove my glasses. I complied and the machine flashed. What had seem like only a mere flash apparently lasted much longer than that. The room was empty other than the man in the coat taking notes with his assistant. I could hear Evan yelling at someone as I looked up at the clock and saw 8:23pm. It’s been 4 hours since I arrived. It didn’t feel like that long. 

Looking around I realized the vivid detail of the clock and realized it was over 30 feet away. I also took note of my depth perception being back to even be able to tell this. Evan was also not in the room either. He was down the hall. Feeling my face I looked in the mirror. It was just my face, nothing on my face or in my ears. I was almost me again. No limbs still though. From over my shoulder in the mirror, Patrick the robot practically leapt at me from behind. His face creeping up out of nowhere.

“Jesus Christ!” I yelled as I faced him. With my new super vision I could see the fakeness of his skin and smile. There was definitely a high grade plastic look to him that was uncanny. His hair unmoving and solid like a doll. His teeth and inside the mouth was convincing though and his eyes were disturbingly human for a walking doll, I could see an almost sad expression by peering into them despite the unnerving smile. “Patrick you startled me!”

He let out that weird hearty laugh where he rocked back and forth again. I wanted to get away from this (guy?)(thing?) as soon as possible.

“We’re sorry to hear that, Mr. Finnic!” The movement of his jaw freaked me right out when he talked. The voice sounded right but not the way it moved. “I was sent to collect you for travel! Mr. Piper has already met your friend! They’re having a meeting at the front desk now!”

As we were leaving I noticed the men in the lab coats also look up at me. It was much more subtle that the other two, but my new vision made it so I couldn’t help but notice their inhuman imperfections. They were also robots. The workers in the labs as we passed by the glass doors were all also not human either.

Going through the doors I saw Evan yelling at Rasheed, who was calm as ever. Ruby was standing, statuesque beside him unmoving. Patrick went back to his desk and Evan rushed over to me as soon as he had noticed me.

“Ed, are you ok!? I came to get you and it’s been hours! They had me wait and wait and wait until finally I got fed up..... where’s your stuff?” He looked confused at my missing hearing aids and glasses. I had never seen Evan in such high definition before. His nose was bigger than I remembered and he had a small mole on his cheek that I never noticed as well. He was well groomed though.

“I don’t need them. They gave me free tech that fixed me!” 

“I’ve told you many times, you don’t need fixing! You sound like my father…” Evan turned his attention back to Rasheed, “I thought this was just an interview!? How could you-“

Rasheed interjected, still smiling, “As I was trying to tell you, Mr. Rothstone, the side effects of our machine is unconsciousness. It’s for his own safety so he doesn’t accidentally do something to effect the procedures. He agreed to it and signed the paperwork. You can see I would say it’s been an amazing success!” 

Did I sign for that when I filled it all out? Looking back I don’t think I did but I was absolutely ecstatic about having my hearing and sight back - better than ever!

During the conversation I eyed up Rasheed. He was definitely human. Unlike everyone else who turned out to be a robot, his movements were completely natural and casual. He stood with his hands in his pockets, jacket unbuttoned. Ruby looked faker than ever standing beside him, but she wasn’t as creepy as Patrick. 

“I don’t want to sound rude or ungrateful Mr. Piper, but I am getting all of my limbs too?”

“Baby steps Eddie! It would be irresponsible to give you new limbs when you already have to get used to new sensory input! We wouldn’t want to damage the goods by accident or give you too much sensory overload at once right? It could be dangerous!” He handed me a check, “Come back one week from now, same time and we’ll start with the new prosthetics. Please feel free to spend this on whatever you need. There’s more on the way!” He shook my left hand and walked with Ruby through the doors.

Truth be told I was getting overwhelmed by my new senses, everything seemed so much more zoomed in than usual and every sound the perfect consistent volume. Evan’s anger dissipated when he saw the zeroes on the first check. We would likely splurge a little on ourselves. 

“Soooo…” Evan seemed almost ashamed of how he acted. “Same time next week?”

Patrick’s creepy overexcited voice called out, “We can hardly wait for your next visit!” His expression should have read as happy but I swear I saw a tear leave those overly realistic eyes.

Getting used to my own new eyes has given me time to process this info and actually type it. Remember, I only have one hand to type with so this took awhile. In two days I’ll be back for my prosthetics.

Word Document 4:
Evan drove me back to my appointment. I never noticed the scenery between Reno and Sacramento changed so much in the two hour trip. At least not in colors as vivid as this. (the trip back last time was in the night). When we arrived outside I told Evan that the machine would likely put me to sleep again, and to go see a movie or do some shopping until I called him. Wheeling in to the lobby was Patrick with his creepy smile. 

“Howdy Mr. Finnic! Please go in to the same room! They’re expecting you!” He was so cheerful it made him creepier.

“Thanks Patrick...” as he buzzed me in his eyes followed me, his strangely realistic eyes juxtaposed with his fake plastic look made me shudder.

As I passed by the conference room where the volunteers were I noticed they were all getting a checkup by more “men” in lab coats. They probably passed in the eyes of the subjects but I noticed all the perfect imperfections in their designs with my new vision. I noticed my informant was nowhere to be seen at all. The only one absent. I brushed it off at the time as maybe he was in the bathroom. 

The same room as last time… Rasheed - who was leaning on the suitcase table - greeted me as I strolled in, “Eddie! Good to see ya! I take it your adjustment period went smoothly?”

“It’s almost too natural now.”

“That’s great news!”

As he stood up and moved I noticed that where there was two smaller suitcases there was now three and the large one still remained. Of the other bodies in the room (out of about 13) only three were human. Ruby, the lab assistants, and other “employees” were automatons. Justine and Mr. Litwick were silently taking notes and observing me - no doubt recording feedback on my new implants. The automatons all had an unnerving smile on them.

One of the bots in particular caught my attention as it also had heterochromia like my source. It looked nothing like him though. What an odd design quirk, I had thought.

Rasheed called out to that robot, “Andrew, can you open the cases?”

That wasn’t my sources name so it eased me a little. I felt like I was going crazy. ‘Andrew’ answered with a chuckle, “Right away sir!”

He opened the small cases only. Inside was two legs exactly the right lengths and a right arm to size. I’m sure it was just my new eyes but I could see the slight fakeness to it which upset me a little; still, it was the most convincing one available. One of the “men” in lab coats approached me with the machine again. With a simple flash I was sitting in the room alone with Andrew and Rasheed (who was leaning back with his feet up).

I rubbed at my eyes with my right hand to refocus a little. That’s when I realized that I had a right hand again. It felt so natural that I subconsciously did it. I pinched my skin and - while I could see the perfect imperfections of it - I felt it, the pain I mean. I let out an audible “Ow” which notified them of my alertness. 

“Good evening, Mr. Finnic! How is it? It feels real right?”

“Jesus.... it really does…”

“I’m sure with your advanced sight you can tell it looks slightly fake but I assure you to anyone else it looks seamless and completely believable!” He looked pleased, “Why don’t you try walking?”

I was so amazed by my arm that I didn’t even realize my feet were back. My shorts were the same but I had two bare legs with feet again. The physical sensations made me feel like me again, other than the impeccably perfect, unnatural skin. I thought I would struggle to my feet but I stood up almost as naturally as I would have before. I almost immediately lost my balance from not being used to it and fell forward. Andrew caught me, “Easy there, pal!”

His face was on full display for me to see up close. That creepy grin that all of them had was there. The eye sockets were not quite right around the real eyes. The eyes themselves were brown and blue like I mentioned earlier. There was so much detail in them and looked so completely real. As I gained my balance what looked like a tear escaped his eye. He instantly set me up and turned his head toward Rasheed (away from me).

“Eddie, you’re standing again buddy! How does it feel? Like you’re on a boat with no sea legs I bet?”

At first I did have to regain my balance, but it wasn’t too bad to take a few steps. The cold floor was chilly to the touch (Can you imagine what that felt like for the first time in years?) as my new feet felt everything. After 30 more minutes of tests it was like I had never lost my limbs in the first place. They gave me a pair of socks and shoes and I called Evan. I didn’t tell him about the legs yet as I wanted to surprise him.

At the front doors Evan was smoking outside and looking at his phone as I approached him. When he heard my footsteps he looked up. The lit cigarette fell onto the sidewalk and he threw his phone onto the drivers seat without looking (lucky that it landed safely in there). He ran up to me and embraced me. “You’re walking again, Ed! I can’t believe you’re walking!”

“I know! I know! I got my arm back too!” The two of us spent so much time together rehabilitating me that we were both a little sad that it felt like a waste and yet so incredibly happy that it lead to this. I’m not gonna lie, we both wept outside with tears of joy. After getting my new legs it pained me to sit again so soon, but I got to ride in the front seat this time.

We picked up some fast food and no one inside so much as glanced at my prosthetics. I don’t mean in an “let’s avoid looking at them” way, I mean a casual, everyday way. What a relief! We decided to drive to an abandoned lot where I tried out my driving skills to see if I still remembered how. It was like riding a bicycle as the saying goes. 

Now that I’m home, I’ve been up all night typing this so my recollection stays with me (much faster - might I add - with two hands!). I have an appointment back every week for checkups for the next two months. With the big paychecks, I plan to buy both of us new cars. It’ll be a huge surprise to Evan I’m sure. Of course I insist on driving myself to my appointments now that I can!

Word Document 5:
My checkups have been going good, next week is the last one. With every visit there have been less and less of the volunteers at the office. I initially thought that they just finished up their tests; now I’m not so sure.

A benefit AND downside to my new hearing is that I accidentally overhear things I know I probably shouldn’t. One time I went for coffee after my appointment and I overheard some cops - sitting in their vehicle outside - discuss the high rate of missing amputees. There was no way.....

Walking back to my new car I noticed a woman putting up a sign on the street light. She tore down a weathered copy from before and put a fresh one up. Even from up the block I could see it perfectly when she moved out of the way. I dropped my coffee.... on the lamp post was a picture of Stuart Bendis: my contact on a missing poster. 

I’ve been up all night trying to dig something up on CBI. The company has only been around since Rasheed’s father - Stephen Piper - ran it from his garage. Mr. Piper married Aanisah Abadi, daughter of wealthy oil tycoon Adnan Abadi. His wealth helped finance the company and turned it into the powerhouse it is today. Rasheed turned to robotics research after his parents got into a fatal accident that left them both catatonic. He wanted a way to make them normal again.

I managed to dig up some dirt as well, Rasheed has been charged with criminal negligence towards patients in the past, resulting in a death. This was covered up thanks to some crooked dealings, but it was on public record. Looks like he’s not so perfect after all. What else are you hiding? One last checkup. This is the last time I have an excuse to be there. I’ll use my stealth training to really dig up some dirt when I go.

Evan’s note: 
I can’t believe everything I just read... I found his notes on the computer after I found the email. I went with the cops to find him at CBI but everyone denied it. That bastard Piper looked me straight in the eye and denied all of it! He said that Ruby and Patrick were the only robots. Everyone else was real. The rest definitely looked it except their smiles. He denied having one named “Cecil”. He claimed no one with that name even worked there. The cops were free to question any staff and look over any necessary footage as well.

There was one worker in particular that had a steady stream of tears running down his face but he still smiled and continued mopping. The baby blue were a match for Ed... I would know those eyes anywhere.... the cops called me crazy. Rasheed Piper said he would charge me with defamation of character. With no proof I linked eyes with that janitor one last time before swearing I would be back.

I don’t know how I’ll do it but I’ll get Ed back.
