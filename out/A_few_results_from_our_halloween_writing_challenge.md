We began a halloween writing challenge on [tagtwists.com](http://tagtwists.com) a few days ago and a few results really stood out (for anyone that doesn't know what tagtwists is we're a collaborative creative community).

The first story I found was from AdamSAKhan and BigBeck: 

>*Hush little baby don't you cry, everything's going to be alright.*

>*The cold evergreen blanket slew over my body and dad went upstairs.*

>*I could feel the harsh wool scratching against my skin, I closed my eyes hoping that I was anywhere else except here.*

>*As the man left my bedroom I could feel the wall fall on me.*

>*This small little room that I've been squashed in for years has very few privileges. I peek through a small crack in the wall. It is a dark, breezy hole but it's the only connection that I have to the outside world.*

>*Sometimes when I close my eyes I like to put my face against the crack and pretend like I'm outside on the swings again. I remember the swings fondly from when I was a child. Mother used to take me to them before father.*

>*But that was a long time ago.*

>*When mother starting listening to Eminem.*

>*I roll over and scratch my ribs against the rough wool and worn out springs. Father said I'll get used to them and the bruises are just a sign of strength.*

>*I close my eyes, and start dreaming again.*

  
The story is very visual and dreamy. I messaged the writer to find out what they wanted to make and they game a few spoilers. And the reason they game me spoilers is because they want people to continue writing with them. So here are the spoilers to what they want to write and join their story at [https://www.tagtwists.com/PostView/68e01cc2873036f735523f84](https://www.tagtwists.com/PostView/68e01cc2873036f735523f84) . 

Here is the plot:

1. A girl is living in this basement and she's been living there for what she thinks is 20 years in this white dress
2. She lives there because a man called father took her there because the world became too dangerous and she needs to be kept safe. 
3. One day father has to go for a few days and she has to wait.
4. She waits a few days and then hears screams from upstairs.
5. She gets really worried, starts screaming and then runs upstairs. 
6. When she gets upstairs she see's the windows are all covered with news papers and there's no light and there's a bunch of people interrogating father.
7. They see her scream and run away, she runs away because in her mind she's 6.
8. She becomes brave and they have a cat and mouse horror story of her chasing each interrogator around the house and slowly hunting them.
9. She eventually gets to the last person and speaks to them, they tell her that father actually stole their daughter and father admits to doing it because he wants to replace her.
10. She see's her reflection in the mirror and finds out that it hasn't been 1 year but 20 years and fathers kept her in the basement
11. She see's her reflection 

That's how the story goes so far and there looking for people to write with.
