 It’s not like rocket science, being a cam girl. Smile at the camera, say thanks for the gifts. There’s not a lot to it, I just wear something sexy and sometimes twerk a bit and that’s that. 

 Obviously I’m used to comments being made on my stream, every day it’s flooded with stuff like

[ Hey sexy won’t you put the camera down and step on me ]

[ lucky stepdad ]

[ flash please? just once? ]

and I’m pretty used to those by now. All they really do is get more attention for my live stream, so I just mute the violent ones and it all works out. Until yesterday, that is. 

Yesterday amid the normal comments there was one that made my stomach drop to my ass. 

[ follow back? ]

[ please let me feel your body ]

[ Hello Emily ]

{What? How the fuck did they get my name?}
 
My username on the app is something else entirely. I did a double take of the comment after frantically scrolling up to find it. 

 {Okay, stay calm.} 

 I acted normal and made sure none of the other commenters had caught on, people called me by the wrong first name on this app all the time. My fans would assume this was another of those times if I didn’t let my panic show on my face. 
 
[ getting freaky tonight? ]

[ i want to gaze on your beautiful body next to mine every night baby girl ]

[ I’ll see you soon, Emily ] 

 Another comment. {Don’t freak out. Don’t freak out.} If they knew my first name, if they knew me from real life . . . 
 
I decided to take the risk of a fan noticing and muted the mother fucker, blocking them for good measure. My thought process was skewed perhaps, anyone can create a second account, but it made me feel better.

 Maybe I should have stopped camming for a while, but we all got bills to pay, so I wrapped it up after three more hours. 

 That night I laid awake, wondering who it could possibly be. Someone from high school, some one from an old job?

It was too much to think about. I comforted myself with the thought that at least there was no one an anonymous blackmailer could send clips or photos to. No friends or family to be humiliated in front of. 

The next day I decided to put on some music while I was streaming. There’s a cover of that don’t worry be happy song I like. 

[ good song, show your stomach pls ]

[ I hate this cover ] 

[ I’ll send you five hundred to video chat for an hour ] 

 Sometimes I make good money video chatting. I responded with a smile and pointed to the sign with my Venmo account. To my surprise I got an alert for the five hundred a minute later. 

{Oh shit! Alright, here we go.}

 When I started the video chat all I saw was a dark screen. That’s honestly better than a penis so I was about to start talking when I heard the audio coming from the other end of the phone, the person I was chatting with. 

“Don’t worry, about a thing

Because every little thing is gonna be alright”

I hurriedly switched off my music, half believing it was coincidence when the melody on the other end of the video chat stopped as well. 

 Then I heard the creak of my closet door slowly swinging open.
