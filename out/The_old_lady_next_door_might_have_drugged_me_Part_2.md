It's 4 in the morning and I feel like I'm losing my goddamn mind.

I've been having the same nightmare every night for exactly five years now. I had hoped the change of scenery might help me get my mind off of everything, but for the past couple of months it's been slowly... deteriorating. Tonight was special. Tonight it was so, so much worse.
Happy Fucking Anniversary.

The most immediate difference from the regular dream is the hardest one to describe. If the original dreams were like sitting alone in a dark, creepy movie theater, these ones had been like having a moldy View-Master fused to my skull. The scene was choppy and stilted, the images in my head looked like they had been covered in bacon grease and deep fried. Everywhere I looked seemed to writhe and twitch as if in agony, and some details kept changing on the peripherals of my vision.

The various cords and tubes almost seemed to be blossoming from the bed, constantly moving and melding together in an ever shifting latticework that seemed to encompass the cramped room. The screens displayed increasingly jumbled messes of numbers and lines, some of the smaller screens skittering around and changing size when I looked away.

Her skin constantly changed color and texture, going from leathery orange to sickly green and all the way back around to deathly pale. Her teeth crowded behind her emaciated lips, moving aggressively past each other like tourists late for their connecting flight, and the number of them kept changing. That I can no longer make out her garbled speech as she claws at an ever larger tumescent, shifting mass of flesh and hairs on her midsection is a blessing these days. This is where the dream usually ends, but tonight my torment had yet to reach its peak.

Suddenly there was a high pitched tone that threatened to split my head in two and the screens started flashing angrily. The cords shuddered and pulsed as distended lumps formed at the edges of the room and traveled down the quivering lines towards the pitiful creature in the bed. Her head slammed backwards into the headboard with a sickening crack as she convulsed in ways that shouldn't be possible for the human body. Her joints constantly shifted positions and angles, and at some points she had more or less than she should.

She sits up suddenly and reaches towards me, her emaciated arms crossing the distance impossibly fast as hordes of spiders with far too many limbs come pouring out of her mouth. Her mouth opens impossibly wide, row upon row of misshapen teeth revealing more of the same. The sounds of scuttling limbs is deafening and I don't even realize I'm awake and screaming until I have to stop to take a breath. The skittering doesn't die out with my voice.

If anything, the maddening scrabble of tiny legs seemed even louder now that I was awake.

I should have known something like this would happen today.

The rumbling, oppressively dark clouds that seemed to hang exclusively over my apartment building were a perfect mirror of my state of mind as I approached the front door. I had considered taking the day off, but the idea of explaining why to my nosy boss seemed too high a mountain to climb today. When I got home, however, I found myself blissfully alone. Ruth seemed to have gotten the message, for now, and Darla seemed to be keeping her own company. Sweet Pea was acting more entitled than usual, I actually had to bring her food bowl into the bathroom since she refused to leave, but she quietly kept to herself in the tub all night.

I stared down at the phone in my hand for a long time. I knew I had to feed myself, but the idea of talking to another person today seemed almost impossible. I relegated myself to raiding the fridge, and when I found the foil wrapped homemade blueberry pie sitting in the back I actually had the gall to think to myself, darkly, *Today must be my lucky day!*

I deserve everything that's happening to me right now.

God only knows what ingredients Ruth might have used, and that was before it had spent weeks at the back of the fridge. I have to admit it was delicious, but before I had even finished I was starting to see things.

I turned to look at a sound I was worried was Ruth unlocking my door, but something made me pause and look back towards the sink. It looked like my favorite mug was sitting precariously on the edge of the counter, the same mug whose shards I had plucked from my heel last night. I rubbed my eyes in disbelief, but when I looked again the counter was bare.

At the time, I thought I was just having a bad day. I always do on this particular day. I thought the guilt over losing the mug had been the straw that broke my back, and I had finally lost my mind. I thought about knocking on Darla's door and seeing if she wanted to wipe out the rest of the day together, hell we could even just go out to the movies. God help me, I even thought about going and talking to Ruth. Just unburdening my soul and dumping all of my woes at her feet.

Ultimately I decided none of it was worth the effort, the quicker I could sleep through the day the quicker it would be tomorrow.

The scuttling, skittering madness was so loud when I woke up I couldn't hear anything else. Clutching my hands tight to my ears to try to drown it out I stumbled towards the door to the bedroom. The moment my hand made contact with the doorknob the scratching cut out, leaving only the agitated grumbling of a looming storm. I don't even hear any of my neighbors through the paper-thin walls.

Stepping into the hallway I strained to hear anything over the sound of my own pounding heartbeat in my ears. I don't remember even turning the TV on today, yet the living room was once again awash in a cold blue glow that only made it seem lonelier, more claustrophobic. The piles of trash and sad, disheveled furniture seemed to be crowding me in, crushing me under the weight of so many nights spent circling the drain. I couldn't put my finger on it but something just seemed wrong, my home for some reason ringing false in my eyes. Unfamiliar. Unwelcoming.

My heart almost leaped straight up into my throat when my eyes locked onto the small ceramic cup sitting on the edge of the sink. It can't be the same mug that had gone down the trash chute before its time, but I don't own any others. The more I stared at it the more sure I was that it couldn't be the same. The handle on this one was a little smaller, and sat a bit too high. The text, which had fooled me on a quick glance, no longer said World's Greatest Dad. It no longer said anything, really, as the strange symbols only bore a passing resemblance to english letters. I had picked it up to get a closer look when suddenly it sprang to life in my hand.

It's hard to describe, but it kind of looked like the mug was a foil balloon that had been suddenly and violently deflated. The smooth, round ceramic slumped into hard edges and sharp points. It very briefly resembles a small, white tumbleweed before the center blossomed into innumerable thin, white needles that sank deep into the fleshy pad of my palm.

My favorite coffee cup had fucking bitten me.

I whipped my arm around reflexively, thankfully before it had gotten a good grip, and I felt a strip of skin tearing off as the little ceramic freak went sailing across the room. The sound it made when it smashed into the wall was absolutely exquisite, sending far more twitching ceramic legs than should have been possible spraying in all directions like a popped boil full of white-gloved fingers. That's when all hell broke loose, just as a flash of lightning from the kitchen window gave me my first good look at the room.

Suddenly, the apartment erupted into life, furniture and piles of trash shifting and twitching as the deafening sounds of tiny scurrying appendages swallowed me whole. The wallpaper almost seemed to be bubbling and popping, until I saw the hundreds of small insects doing a poor job of imitating moldy paint chips. Another couch, just like the one on which I had spent so many nights trying to just fade into oblivion, came crawling out from behind the coffee table, blocking the light from the TV as its cushions parted like a fat bulldog's jowls to reveal hungry rows of gnashing leather-bound teeth. A second coffee table emerged from underneath the first and lurched between me and the front door, seeming to almost grow towards me as one of it's legs split in two and the top morphed into a pentagonal shape.

Backing towards the hallway I grabbed one of the dining room chairs to defend myself, but when my fingers slip into the pattern carved in the back the holes suddenly constricted, burying rough wooden needles into my fingers from all angles. Gritting my teeth so hard I tasted blood, I hoisted the chair-thing above my head and savagely smashed it against the table, sending strangely soft chunks of twitching wood and particle board flying.

Whatever fleeting moment of hope I felt at my barbaric victory against the dining room set was swiftly dashed when the couch took its place at the entrance to the hallway. I was considering an escape through the bedroom, the window slats should open just wide enough to squeeze out, when I heard a mournful cry from behind me.

Sweet Pea was still in the bathroom.

No time to think, I immediately went charging around the corner and came to a stop so hard I could swear I slid a little on the floor. I didn't even notice at first that the bathroom door was closed. I finally saw the source of the flood of tiny insect-like things infesting my apartment. The closet door was open again. A small, unremarkable cardboard box lay across the threshold, upturned slightly as a writhing mass of old clothes that should have been donated or thrown away years ago spilled out into the hallway. The permanent marker scrawl on the side was mostly legible, and it almost spelled her name correctly.

I realize I've stepped back into the corner of the hallway when I hear the couch redouble it's efforts to reach me. Turning my head to look I see it stuffing itself into the hallway, bulging and morphing as it slowly oozes down the hallway. I find myself frozen staring at it as hundreds of tiny, square couch legs sprout from its sides and dig deep into the plaster of the walls. The frantic scraping of the couch's thick wooden legs is deeper than the low buzz of scrabbling legs from before, more urgent and powerful, as it desperately dragged itself towards me.

I definitely won't be getting out through the bedroom.

Sweet Pea let out another small, muffled cry and I don't even realize I'm moving until I feel the impact of the box against my foot and the cool metal of the knob mixed with a burning itch in my palm as I slam the closet door shut. The pile of clothes crushed under the door squealed in a chorus of pain and rippled as dozens of fabric fingers shot out, tapping frantically on the floor like a piano concerto.

Dazed, I looked down at my hand to see a large wooden splinter with three joints sprouting from my palm, twitching and writhing like a severed roach leg or lizard tail. Without stopping to think about it I ripped it out with my teeth and spat the wriggling hunk of wood to the floor, wrenching my foot away from the gradually slowing fabric appendages as I closed the distance to the bathroom. The moment I opened the bathroom door Sweet Pea bolted between my legs and through the closet door that had reopened behind me when I wasn't looking. Before I could even think of giving chase the bulky, misshapen form of the couch came lumbering around the corner and I swiftly locked myself in the bathroom.

That's where I've been for the past half an hour or so while the thunderous pounding of rain intensifies against the window, typing this up with bloody toilet paper wrapped around my arm while a couch tries to fit through a quarter-inch thick gap between the door and the floor. The worst part is, it's starting to get somewhere. The old lady who lives next door might have drugged me, and that was the best case scenario. A part of me is sure this is just a bad dream, a terrible reaction to the wrong kind of "special" dessert from an out of touch old bat who probably meant well. A bigger part of me wants to accept it, to just sit here and wait while my sad, empty apartment gets sadder and emptier, to let the couch swallow me whole. Something stronger rising from the deepest depths of my soul can still hear Sweet Pea calling from down the hall, and thinks the heavy porcelain toilet tank lid could probably do a lot more damage than a wooden chair. Ruth's going to be pissed, she just installed it last week.

If I don't make it... shit, I don't know. I have nothing to give and nobody to give it to. Just take my advice. Go wash your damn dishes. Go hug your loved ones. Go tell her you're sorry.

Before it's too late.
