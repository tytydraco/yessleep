Right after that, I no longer felt like myself alone. He had entered me. I could sense his presence, the depth of his soul pressing against mine. What you might call soul suppression began to take hold. It felt as though my very existence was being pushed aside. He had become dominant.

When he looked up at the sky, it was clear again. There were no shooting stars, no trees shaped like humans, no graffiti crawling along the road. Yet I could still feel them. The graffiti hadn’t vanished, it had moved inside me, manifesting as patterns, fragmented thoughts, and memories never lived.

I felt my own memories making way. They began to shrink, retreating, cornering themselves into places I could no longer reach.

The thoughts inside my head were foreign, and so was the voice. Especially the language, it wasn’t English. It was an unknown tongue in which I found myself thinking. My mind felt like invaded territory.

I recalled moments never lived, memories never cherished, and a persistent sense of having been somewhere I had never been. My real self struggled to tell the difference. Again and again, my mind was flooded with memories too alien to understand, yet disturbingly familiar, as if I had lived through them once.

Before I could reason with what was happening, the scene shifted.

Everything moved.

A road began to build itself in real time. I felt myself levitating, drifting away too fast to comprehend the speed. Then, just as abruptly, I was standing outside a house near a vast cornfield. A single lamp glowed beside the car I stood near. Before I could think, my body carried me toward it. Someone was watching from the window.

I opened the bonnet, picked up a wrench, and fixed the car’s battery, not because I decided to, but because my hands already knew how. The cornfield looked eerie beneath the dark sky. It appeared frozen. Only the space around me moved, while everything beyond remained still, as if time had stopped at a distance.

Then I saw a woman step out of the house. Two children followed her, clutching her skirt, struggling to keep up. As I looked at her, an overwhelming sense of love surged through me;  love that wasn’t mine. It felt as though I had once loved her deeply, as though I knew her. She came closer and spoke in a language I couldn’t understand. I heard myself respond, and I knew it wasn’t me answering. It was the hitchhiker.

After a brief exchange, all of us got into the car and drove off.

What astonished me were the surroundings. The trees remained frozen until we approached them. Once we passed, they froze again, as if the world only existed within a moving boundary around us ,as if everything else had been abandoned by time.

Throughout the drive, I spoke to the woman in the same unknown language. Or rather, the hitchhiker did. After what felt like hours, we reached a gas station. From a distance, it was frozen. Three men stood beside a pickup truck, unmoving. The moment we crossed the station’s boundary, it came alive. The three men, thick beards and all, moved in unison.

They stared at us without speaking.

I stopped near the pump and began filling the tank. The men slowly drove away.

As we exited the station, I saw the same men and the pickup again; frozen in the rear-view mirror. I couldn’t comprehend it. If they had already left, why were they still there? And why only in the mirror?

After covering more distance, I felt myself turning onto a dirt road. It was the same road I had been forced away from earlier. When I checked the rear-view mirror, the woman and the children were gone. Only I remained. I stepped out of the car.

A while later, I found myself walking against my will toward the forest, back onto the same dirt road where the wind had once driven me away. I could hear my footsteps, the wet mud crushing beneath my boots, but I couldn’t feel them. The sensation of walking was gone.

Step by step, I drew closer to the source of the sounds I had heard before, the crackling of firewood, children laughing, something cooking. Slowly, my body carried me forward.

When I finally reached what looked like the family’s campsite, the woman sitting near the fire asked me something in the same unknown language. My thoughts formed in that language, and I answered. It felt like a collision inside my mind. Even now, I don’t understand how I could still think in my own language while another had already overtaken me.

Then I saw two men marching toward the woman and the children, axes in their hands.

They looked familiar.

As they drew closer, I realized I had seen them before, at the gas station.

I felt myself shouting something in the unknown language.

Then I was struck from behind.

**A sharp blow to the head.**

I remained conscious while my body fainted.
