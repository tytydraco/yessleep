We just moved to a new town. We were out of our cramped city apartment and into a three bedroom with a yard. It felt like our dream had finally come true. We’d been saving for the better part of a decade, and finally, it was ours.

The town was a bit small, but Main Street was cute. The people were exceptionally friendly. The few restaurants in town were good. We were so excited to start this next chapter, and we even had plans to expand our family. It finally felt like everything was falling into place.

There was only one odd thing, a blip, that I initially didn’t pay much mind too, but it made me uneasy nonetheless. 

On the first night in our new home I’d gone all out. A fresh baked sourdough loaf from my old starter, and a meatballs meticulously made from scratch. All pressed together with fresh mozzarella and homemade marinara, the perfect meatball paninis to welcome us to our new life, to welcome us home. 

But as I scrubbed and scrubbed my old pan that desperately needs replacing, the lights in the kitchen down low, I glanced out the window and swore I saw faint orbs in sets of two illuminating the forest at the edges of our yard. It looked like many sets of eyes; the lights were high up enough to be human, but they had no accompanying silhouettes to suggest there were people hiding in the trees. At first I thought it was the lights inside reflecting off the glass, but the placement was wrong. The hue was wrong. And the pit of my stomach told me something was *wrong.* It felt as though I was being watched, but not passively. Instead it felt calculated, meant to be noticed. I went to get my husband, for him to see what I was, but in the brief minute I was gone the lights had disappeared. 
 
I had trouble falling asleep that night, but the next day was normal. My husband and I had both gone to work, our son to school, and dishwashing didn’t beckon the same strange illusions I’d seen the night before. I wrote it off, and promptly forgot about it.

About a month later it happened again. 

I was in the same spot, scrubbing the same pan. But this time, I felt a chill down my spine as the compulsion to glance up overwhelmed me. I complied, only to be met with a single pair of eyes, up close, practically pressed to the glass. They were illuminated, but this time I could make out the detail. An iridescent blue iris almost overtaken by the fully dilated pitch black pupil. The pupil itself seemed to have ripples which ebbed and flowed throughout. There was no face, nothing else, just a single, dark, floating set of eyes, staring directly into mine. I remember screaming, and my husband rushing to my side, frantically asking what was wrong. I pointed to the window, sneaking a glance and noticing that the eyes were still there, locked on me. I scrambled away, trying to break the gaze, but still felt it on me.

“Hun, what is it?” his voice came around the corner.

“In the window, do you see them?” I asked him.

“There’s nothing there?” 

I looked around the wall and sure enough, there were those same orbs, floating alone, locked on me. Radiating light. How did he miss them?

I insisted we stay in a hotel downtown that night. As we were grabbing our things to leave, a feeling of absolute dread completely encompassed me. The earth felt like it stood still, the air heavy, and all noise suddenly ceased. I was paralyzed, and no matter how hard I fought to regain control of my limbs there was no moving them. My husband, who had been carrying our sleeping son down the hall towards me, was suddenly still, eyes filled with panic. I could see, clearly, that he could feel this too. The orbs appeared above him and instantaneously I saw them both crumble and disappear right before my eyes.

As they crumbled my free will returned, but I stood still. No trace was left. Not a single hair from either of their heads. The eyes began to slowly come closer and I bolted, grabbing the keys and locking the car immediately behind me. I went straight to the police station. I didn’t know where else to go.

“Ma’am,” the tired looking officer said, with a strange, confused look on his face. “A month ago you moved here alone. You’ve never been married. There’s no record of you having a son.”

“What?” was the only coherent thing I managed to say before he repeated himself and I flew into a frenzy that got me placed on an involuntary psych hold.

I just got out, and I’m with my sister for now. She insists I was single too. I’ve realized I shouldn’t argue. I can’t find records of my marriage, no trace of my husband on the internet. No photos of him or our son. But I know that they were real. I don’t what to do, but I’m not sure my decisions will be my own for long anyway. Each night I have that same feeling of being watched. The eyes are beckoning my own to look up, to look out the nearest window, to meet them. They want something from me. I keep fighting the urge to look, but I don’t know how long I can ignore the [pull.](https://www.reddit.com/r/cmpaizspooks/s/zHf3lA9iHF)
