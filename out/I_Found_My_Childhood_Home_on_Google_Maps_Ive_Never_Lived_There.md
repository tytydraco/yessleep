I need to write this down before I forget. Or before I convince myself it didn't happen.

Three days ago, I was procrastinating at work, doing that thing where you look up your childhood home on Google Street View and feel nostalgic. You know the drill. I typed in the address I've known by heart since I was five—the house where I grew up until I was eighteen.

The Street View loaded. Wrong house.

I mean, it was the right address. The number was there on the mailbox. But the house was completely different. Instead of our two-story colonial with the wraparound porch, there was a single-story ranch with brick facing. Different trees. Different everything.

I figured Google had glitched or I'd misremembered the address. But when I checked the historical imagery, going back to 2007, it showed the same ranch house. Every single year. That house has apparently been there since at least 2007.

Here's the thing: I have photos of myself in front of MY house. Birthday parties on that wraparound porch. My dad painting the shutters. My mom's garden out front. All timestamped between 2003 and 2015.

I called my parents. My mom answered on the second ring.

"Hey Mom, weird question. What's the address of the house where I grew up?"

She recited it back to me perfectly. "Why?"

"Can you describe the house to me?"

There was a pause. "Are you feeling okay?"

"Just humor me."

She described the ranch house. The one on Google Maps. Brick facing, she said. Small front yard with the oak tree on the left side. She remembered it perfectly—except it wasn't the house in my photos.

"Mom, what about the wraparound porch? And the two stories?"

Another pause, longer this time. "Sweetie, we never had a wraparound porch. It was always a ranch. Are you sure you're alright?"

I hung up and pulled out my old photo albums. The physical ones, because I needed to be sure. I found the photo of my eighth birthday party. There I was, standing in front of a house.

The ranch house.

I REMEMBER the porch. I remember sitting on the porch swing doing homework. I remember my parents fighting on the second floor and me hearing it from my first-floor bedroom. I remember climbing down from my second-story window once when I was grounded.

But in every photo, there's only one story. There's no porch.

I thought I was losing my mind, so I went through my phone. I had taken a picture in 2019 during a drive through my old neighborhood, just a quick snap of the old place for Instagram nostalgia. I found it in my camera roll.

When I took the photo, I captioned it: "The old two-story where I learned to ride a bike."

But the house in the photo is the ranch. It's always been the ranch.

The caption doesn't match what I'm seeing. But I wrote that caption. I REMEMBER taking that photo and feeling sad that the porch looked more run-down than I remembered.

What porch?

I drove there yesterday. I had to see it in person. The ranch house was there, of course. An old man was getting his mail. I asked him how long he'd lived there.

"Thirty-two years," he said. "Bought it in '93."

"Has it always been a single story?"

He looked at me like I was crazy. "Course it has. You looking to buy in the neighborhood?"

I went home and started going through everything. Every photo, every memory. They don't match. My memories are of a two-story colonial. Every piece of evidence shows a ranch.

But here's what's keeping me up at night:

I found a video on an old hard drive. It's from 2011, just me and my dad doing a silly father-daughter dance in the living room. My mom is filming and laughing. In the background, you can see the stairs leading to the second floor.

I watched that video twelve times. The stairs are there. They're THERE.

I sent the video to my mom this morning and asked her what she saw.

She called me immediately. "Honey, I need you to come home. We need to talk about getting you some help."

"Just tell me what you see in the video, Mom."

"I see you and your father dancing in the living room. It's a beautiful memory."

"What's behind us?"

"The... the wall. The TV. What else would there be?"

I'm looking at stairs. She's looking at a wall.

I watched the video again just now. The stairs are gone. There's just a wall.

But I can HEAR them. In the audio, clear as day, someone walks down stairs. Heavy footsteps on wood, creaking. Then my mom's voice: "Careful on those stairs, John!"

My dad's voice: "I got it, I got it."

But in the video, he never goes anywhere. He's just dancing with me. There are no stairs.

I'm starting to forget what the porch looked like. The details are getting fuzzy. I tried to draw it from memory today and realized I couldn't remember if the swing was on the left or right side.

Did we even have a swing?

I'm writing this down because I'm terrified that tomorrow I'll wake up and remember the ranch house. Just the ranch house. Like it's always been that way.

If you're reading this and you remember me talking about my childhood home—if I ever showed you pictures or told you stories about a two-story colonial with a wraparound porch—please tell me. Please tell me it was real.

Because I'm starting to forget which memories are mine and which ones are being... replaced.

And the worst part? I just realized something.

I've been calling it "the house on Oakwood" this whole time. But I just looked at my birth certificate, my old school records, every official document.

The street name is different. Completely different.

I've never lived on the street I've been remembering.

So whose memories am I remembering?

**UPDATE:** I shouldn't have posted this. My mom just called. She's worried about me, says I need to come home. But she didn't say "come home to your apartment." She said "come home."

She wants me to come back to a house I've never lived in.

I'm not going.

I can't go.

Because I just realized—I don't remember my apartment either. I'm sitting here right now, and I can't remember how I got here. I can't remember moving in. I can't remember where my bedroom is.

What color are my walls?

I don't know.

I don't know.

**FINAL UPDATE:** They're at my door. My parents. They keep knocking and saying it's time to come home. But their voices sound wrong. They're saying the right words, but it sounds like they're reading from a script.

"Come home."

"Come back to your real house."

"We miss you in the ranch."

I never lived there. I've never lived ANYWHERE.

I just looked at my driver's license. The address matches what they're saying.

The photo on the license isn't me.

I don't know who I am.

The knocking stopped.

I'm going to open the door now. I need to see what's on the other side.

I need to go home.

Wherever that is.
