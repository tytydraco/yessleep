My name is Jeff and I go to Blackwell junior high school two weeks ago Mark went missing, there was no trace of him ever found. The school tried to keep it quiet but the missing posters keep turning up round campus, heck, even on the bathroom stall you can see marks face sometimes. 

Since the begging I knew something was up when I told people that his disappearance wasnt an accident eveyone ignored me ,even worse all of my friends were pulled out of schoool since marks disappearance 

Today while I was washing my hands I saw something red in the corner of my eye when I picked up the object it appeared to be the tongue of a red shoe it said “ IF LOST RETURN TO: Mark Mchollo, PHONE: should be in pocket lol” ironically, I found what I assume was his phone with a cracked screen and even though the screen was cracked it appeared to be functional. When I came home I plugged in the phone, soon a pear logo flashed across the screen before it turned on to show marks wallpaper which looked like a selfie of him and his brother in the forest together. Even though me and Mark weren’t very close we still played basketball together so i started to guess possible passwords I guessed his birthday, his brothers birthday, his address, all zeros and finally 12345 before the phone shut down I whisper shouted “ dang it!” then tried to go to sleep



The next day I was tired from staying up and guessing passwords but I got up anyway and after putting on my baggy sweatshirt and cargo pants I looked in the mirror, My mom says I have the brightest eyes she’s seen but i think they’re a pretty dull hazel colour another thing people say about me is that i should do my hair more often but I usually wear a beanie so there is no real point in doing so, after putting on my Jeffreys my mom calls me for breakfast, My Mom makes the best eggs and paired with cholula they are absolutely delish. After eating breakfast I run out to the bus and look out the window, we live in a forestry area in oregon the trees are so pretty in autumn, Suddenly the bus jerks to a stop I get up to see what happened but it turns out it was just  a snake crossing the road, I look out the window and swear i can see someone standing there in the woods i assume its nothing and revert to my usual position on the bus. When we arrive at school Im immediately greeted by the blaring sound of the P.A announcing the lunch, because of marks disappearance now the annoucments end with a warnng to always stay wth another person. After going through my morning classes i grab snack during break but the schools seems quieter, I think parents are worried about their kids safety and pulling their kids out of school. Have you heard of the “Backrooms” its a horror series about empty public places thats what school feels like today except there is no eighteen foot tall monster with sirens for head chasing me through the halls, but at this point I would rather that to this at least I would know what happened to mark.



The bus ride home to day was slow until the bus broke down, Mr. Ricardo went to check it out but after about 15 minutes the was still at a stand still so I looked out the window and couldnt see him, I decided to step out of the bus to see if he was still there, he wasnt there, suddenly I felt an uneasy feeling almost as though I was being watched. I decided to step inside the bus. After another 10 minutes I heard a loud resounding BANG then a sloshy noise. When I stepped outside I saw a long shadow outside and almost as though on instinct I closed the bus doors and hid under one of the seats, There were several more Bangs on the walls and windows and the sloshy noise turned to ripping and tearing sound and I swear I heard something smear across the side of the bus this went on for several hours until I heard something that sent a chill down my spine at first it sounded just like a whisper saying, “Hi” or “whats your name” but in seconds it unturned to an inhumane screeching noise that sounded like it had a hint of both Mr. Ricardos voice and Marks voice too I pulled my phone out to record and just like that it went silent, I looked both ways before stepping outside to make sure whatever that was wasnt there but everywhere i looked I saw still silhouettes, one looked like a human with its arms as long as its legs on all fours one looked human but with a far to big mouth I ran as fast as I could Before I knew it I was home once i was there  I decided to try to fall asleep after all it was probably just a dream.



In the morning I began to question if that was real Mom was at her job at the hospital and Dad was in Toronto so I had noody to talk to about the previous night, Im thankful they both work hard enough for us to keep our house but I wish they home more. Today I had to walk to school because Mr Ricardo was gone. I went through the school day like usual but i still feel like Im being watched when I got home mom had left a message saying she was going to be working a double shift at the hospital, “Great” I thought to myself sarcastically. I after getting ready for bed I scrolled on Tok Tik for an before an unusual video showed up, A man was talking about how he had assumed to be a homeless man wandering around in the forest when sud,denly something made the same unholy sound I had hear last night and he yelled at the top of his lungs when suddenly he went quiet. Almost immediately after this his phone cut to a EAS alarm, he couldnt mute his phone as the alarms went off, and suddenly a figure that looked like a man except where the eyes should have been were another persons eyes that looked as though they were photoshopped on except they look to real and somehow it whispered to him in a text to speech voice “ I’m home mark” repeatedly he heard the terrible roar again, the eas alarm returned to normal it said to not open your door to anyone tonight no matter who or what they sounded like before the screen showed for a split second what appeared to be Mark except it wasnt, His eyes were little to wide in a almost cartoon like fashion his mout wa alittle tI wide but before i could process it My phone started making a violent screaming noise mixed with pleading,I t was mark who was screaming before I could contemplate any of this I heard Afterthe door  exclaiming in a exited voice saying “Hi JeFF i Have A G g g g g Gift FOR y-y-yOUUU” I knew it wasnt her, she had too much happiness in her voice she also didnt have a stutter I yelled back “GO AWAY!” holding back tears it said back “come Oh M-M-Jeff I wont hurt YOu” Just ask MARk!” my phone made the horrible noise again and sped up childrens music played in the background I just wanted to cry I rushed towards the phone and dialed 911 I told them the situation and they hung up beofre a man on the otherside of the phone started to repeatedly say Dont respond in a monotonous voice, The lady said Im sorry before she actually hung up the creature on the other side of the door started to laugh a unholy robotic laugh over and over and over again, my only hope was to keep the door closed till morning. I woke up in a cold sweat, I realized I wasnt in my room but in the middle of the forest.  



I was still in shock about last night, was it a dream? Luckily i still had my phone in my pocket and I dialed 911, they did not respond “Dang It” I exclaimed to the forest i decided to use my phones compass and head north luckily my house was only abou a mile away and I got there quick enough to see a shadow dart away from the window once i got inside I immediately regretted my decision I saw mark in my room except he was twisted, his neck was way too long, his eye sockets were large with small eyes in them and it almost looked like he didnt fit into the skin, He attempted to lure me to him by making a comforting sounding voice while staying completely still almost as though It couldnt move until i got closer, i made adash to the school.



The school was empty and I still felt as though I was being watched I locked myself into the bathroom stall and thought about what had happened “is this a dream” I wondered but before I could finish the thought a voice came from directly outside the bathroom stall it was almost like it couldnt decide who it was, first I heard mom, then Mark, the mr ricardo then a twisted mockery of all of their voices. I heard a sick sloshing noise and a scrape against the stall i heard the voice again “ We wont hurt you” it said in that terrible voice” I looked for a exit to the bathroom, “Aha” I saw a unscrewed vent and crawled through it I could hear the sloshing and crackling noise in the classes below the vent finally the vent ended in a trash can, The police station was just across the street so I decided to make a run for it. 



Once I arrived at the station I saw one of the creatures ahead of me it said repeatedly “Nothing is worth the risk” the voice was that of the police man from yesterday, It seemed docile so I slowly tip toed past it but once I was about 2 feet from the door it charged at me, its limbs moved in unatural ways and with every movement I could hear a sickening crunch as It ran toward me, Luckily before it could get to me I slammed the door closed there were two other police officers in the office one was a rather chubby man with puffy sideburns (yikes) the other was a tall woman with curly red hair, they were both hiding underneath the desk. They looked like they were in shock but one of them barely peeped “was officer Jones out there?” I answered “I dont know all I saw was one of the creatures” The short one let out a gasp before walking into what i assume was the training room. I demanded an explanation for all of this, Both of them said in unison “nothing is worth the risk” before putting on what appeared to be a training tape. The tape was old fashioned and had a simple text to speech voice not unlike the one I heard from my phone, it went over 3 scenarios for the different first responders, Police, Medics and firefighters before showing one of the creatures and the screen saying “alternate” in a hushed voice the tv emitted a scream and the police officers yelped in fear I found the closest possible hiding place and through the window of the station saw what appeared to be 3 of them approaching one almost looked it had a hood the other looked as though it used to be a teenage boy and the other took on the appearance of a middle aged lady, all of them looked unnatural like a twisted perspective on what is natural they all said in unison in the whispering text to speech voice “nothing is worth the risk” it was almost as though they could only utter simple phrases they had heard before, before I could process that thought one shot through the window grabbed the stubby police officer and whispered in his voice “dont respond” before I closed my eyes and heard a sickening ripping noise then nothing it was almost as though nothing had happened but it was really just the calm before the storm the hooded one wandered through the broken glass as its eyes changed in size, it was almost like a cat hunting its prey suddenly a loud bang came from the school and the mosnters eyes thinned and it ran toaards the house, I came out from my hiding spot and he was right behind me. Suddenly the same voice whispered in my voice "GO AWAY" before it unhinged its jaw and went for my face.

Today I woke up I don't know whats going on but My phone is still in my pocket so I figured if I am to go out I might as well tell the world about it all I can see is one of them getting closer and closer.
