 [PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11590gq/i_work_with_an_elite_team_called_the_alpha/)

&#x200B;

My boot splintered the bullet riddled door off of its hinges as Wade and I swept through the room. Pitch black welcomed us, our chemlights barely able to function as we made our way in. We were no longer in a hallway, that much I could tell. There was a feeling of a vast emptiness as we spread out. I skirted along the wall to the left, creeping slowly. I was only about thirty feet in when I heard something.

***“Ca… You… Er… E,”*** Snippets of Trevor’s voice crackled in my headset. I stopped in my tracks. ***“Wade, did you hear-”***

***“I did. We must be on the other edge of the house. See if you can get a better signal.”***

I pushed forward a few more yards as the static slowly started to fade.

***“Whiskey two come in! Paige! Anyone!”*** Trevor sounded manic. Searching out into the ether. Desperate for a response from his team.

I wasted no time. ***“This is Whiskey five online. How copy?”***

***“Kid? Thank god!”*** I could almost hear the weight lifting off his shoulders. ***“Where the hell are ya? Been trying to hail you for an hour.”***

***“Got separated from Paige and Eric. Wade’s with me but I gotta tell ya, it’s FUBAR as a motherfucker in here. We need assistance.”***

***“Where’s the Orchid Whiskey Five?”*** Shay’s gruff voice cut through the static before Trevor got a chance to respond.

This question took me back. I mean I know the Orchid takes a precedent but still. ***“Location unknown at this time. If we have another team we can find paige and-”***

***“Negative.”*** He shot back before I could even finish. ***“Whiskey Five be advised, mission parameters have been adjusted. You will find and retrieve the Orchid. Linking up with Whiskey and Delta will be a secondary priority.”***

I felt a twinge of anger beginning to bubble up in my throat. *“****On whose orders sir?”***

***“On mine rookie. Don’t make me repeat myself.”*** 

I heard the squeaking of plastic as I dug my palm into the rifle grip. ***“This wasn’t part of the original brief-”***

***“I don’t give a shit what it’s a part of!”*** He shouted back over the comm channel loud enough to make my ear ring. ***“My op, my orders. There are enough brain cells left in that inbred cesspit you call a skull to follow orders isn’t there?!’***

***“That’s enough!”*** Trevor shouted out. The channel went quiet for a moment leaving only the quiet hum of radio static.

***“Listen Kid,”*** He came back a moment later. ***“I don’t like it anymore than you do but my hands are tied.”***

I looked back over to Wade. His face was building with anger at the disrespect. 

***“It’s not your fault Trevor. I understand. What can you give me?”*** 

He let out a sigh and thought for a moment. ***“If you can give me a minute I’ll get the power rerouted. Should be easier to maneuver when you're not bumping into shit, eh?”***

***“If that’s what you can give me I’ll take it.”*** I said solemnly. 

***“Roger. Standby.”*** With that the line went dead again.

***“Don’t hold it against him.”*** Wade said, after a moment to break the silence. ***“He just doesn’t want to see us riding the bench again like these past few months.”***

***“It’s not him I’m angry at.”*** I shot back. ***“It’s that knock off Wolverine up there with him.”*** 

He let out a small chuckle. ***“You’re not the only one.”***

We stood there and waited for what felt like an eternity. I listened for anything I could. Eventually, I started to hear something. Something organic. Squelching and churning. Like fluid being pushed through a tube. 

*‘What the h-’* 

***“Kid? You there?”*** Trevor’s voice came back, breaking me from my thoughts.

***“Yeah. Go ahead.”***

***“Roger. Bringing powergrid online in 3… 2…1,”*** The light’s flickered before settling and illuminating the space. The fluorescent buzzing, drowning out the sound. I was blinded for a moment, having to shield my face and wait for my eyes to adjust. What I saw when they did made me want to claw them out.

\* \* \*

We had found Delta. Well, what was left of them anyways. Their lifeless bodies were twenty feet above us lashed to the rafters by large, white vines. Stems protruded from their husks, implanted into their bodies. A massive, organic tube was jammed into their mouths pumping out fluids in a loud, sickly, squelch. It swayed gently, clinging to the skin covered skeletons. They looked like they had been dead for decades. But there was no doubt, from the ripped clothing they had on, to the emblazoned D that clung to a scrap of fabric on their shoulders, it was them.

I struggled to keep the vomit in the back of my throat from bursting forth as Wade threw caution to the wind, ripping off his mask and puking on the floor. I wasted no time in trying to get through to Trevor.

***“Whiskey Five to Whiskey One, we got a problem, a big fucking problem!”*** I shouted into the headset.

***“What’s going on Kid?”*** Trevor’s concerned voice came over as I looked over and watched Wade quickly wipe his mouth putting his mask back on with shaking hands.

***“Delta is dead.”*** I said matter of factly. ***“I’m looking at the bodies now, the fucking plant is draining them of… well I don’t know what it’s doing but they’re gone man!”***

Shay cut back over once again in a calm, calloused, tone echoing through the static. *“****Leave the bodies, finish the mission.”***

*“But-”*

*“****Do what you're told, rookie. They’re useless now.”*** The line went dead as I let out a frustrated scream.

***“I hate to keep up the bad news.”*** Wade said after I threw my voice out. ***“But a thought just occurred to me.”*** 

I looked over at him as my mind reached the same conclusion. ***“If that’s Delta, then who’s with Pai-”***

A shot rang out to the east as Wade and I took off. We ran through door after door, paying no mind to the walls, once beset by dark and beautiful wood, now covered in a mass of white, pustulous vines. The hallways had turned into a hellish jungle. Where carpet had been hours before, a damp earthen floor had taken over. The air felt hot and sticky on my skin, causing my clothes to stick to my body. I didn’t care. I just needed to reach them in time. 

Wade charged forward and drove his shoulder into what was now a rotted mass of planks opening us up into the foyer. We saw them, Paige and Eric backed against a wall, draped in vines that were slowly snaking their way down to them. Looming before them, cackling in an unnatural and nearly manic droll, stood a group of creatures. They may have at one point been human, but that was no longer the case. The figures before me now were emaciated, deformed, and hungry. Their mismatched limbs were protruding from every part of their Lovecraftian mass. The monsters’ skin had been peeled back, exposing the white bone that now spiked itself throughout their bodies. Not one of them had eyes. Just differing amounts of pitch black slits that dotted their now deformed heads. Each one jerked back and forth in the same puppet-like fashion as Raul did in the picture, lashing out at them, taunting them. Drinking in their fear.

I didn’t hesitate. My body functioned on instinct as I raised my rifle and watched the torrent of bullets rip them to shreds. Wade followed my lead as the room began to fill with the sounds of gunfire, and the stench of carbon.

\* \* \*

It took a moment for the dust to settle. I had my finger still pressed down on the trigger, even 

though I had run dry two minutes ago. Finally, I saw Paige. She sprinted to me and embraced me in a tight hug. I felt the tears that were running down her cheeks, coat my neck, as Eric walked up behind her, his rifle slung across his shoulders. 

***“Man, I gotta tell ya. Your timing is impeccable.”*** Eric said as he let out a massive sigh. 

Wade and I let out a soft chuckle as I looked down at Paige. She finally let go and looked back at me, wiping her eyes.

***“We tried to wait. These… things. We thought they were Delta. They started to change. If you guys hadn’t shown up… I don’t know-”*** She trailed off as I gave her an understanding nod. 

She took a moment to herself as she fiddled with her earpiece. 

***“Whiskey One, this is Whiskey Two how copy?”*** 

***“I’m here Paige. Are you okay? Where’s Eric?”*** Trevor came back over the radio, speaking ecstatically. 

***“Right here Doc. Thanks to Markus here. We need an Exfil.”*** 

***“Yeah, about that.”*** Trevor’s voice deflated as he explained the situation.

Livid was an understatement to Paige’s emotions after Trevor finished filling her in. I couldn’t even keep up with the Spanish she was using but I knew enough to know that Shay would be on her shitlist til the day he died. 

***"Goddammit!"*** She shouted as her boot went through an abomination's skull. I think she just needed to break something. To feel like she had some sort of control. After a moment, she caught herself and found her composure, exhaling a deep sigh as she looked at the lot of us.

***“We gotta find this thing.”*** She said, grabbing her rifle and checking the ammunition. **”*****If it’s grown large enough to start affecting such a large area, we can assume it will need to be in an equally large space. It’s not like it can grow legs or anything.”***

***“Well-”*** Eric began as he chambered another round. ***“I mean we don’t know that it can’t.”***

We stood there for a few minutes, each of us silently thinking about our next move.

***“What about the basement?”*** I said. ***“Think about it. It’s still a plant after all. You can’t just put it in a vase like a bouquet of roses. It needs a place to lay down roots.”***

Everyone turned and nodded to each other in agreement. If only we had known at that time what was waiting for us down there, we would have left and turned this place into fucking ash.

The first thing I noticed upon entering the basement was the smell. Even with my mask pumping filtered air into my lungs, I still picked up that sickly sweet smell. Like butterscotch and bubblegum boiled in a vat of maple syrup, courtesy of the green pustules coating the walls, pumping out a dense green mist. 

***“Holy hell,”*** Eric said, while trying to stifle a wheeze, ***“Smells like a warehouse full of Old Spice in here.”*** 

***“Try breathing in through your mouth.”*** Paige responded quietly. Seemed like she was still trying to maintain her professionalism even after everything that had happened. ***“The scent won’t be as overpowering.”*** 

***“10-4 Cap. I’ll be the best mouth breather here.”*** Eric chuckled to himself as my foot hit solid ground. 

***“Think I hit the bottom”*** I radioed back as I felt Wade's presence behind me. The air was thicker here. Almost heavy. Like I felt its weight more than the vest and rifle I was carrying.  The fact the only light showing was from the plants covering the wall to my left made it even harder for me to get my bearings.  

***“Whiskey One this is Five”*** I said, continuing to scan the room, struggling to make my eyes adjust. 

***“Loud and clear Five.”*** Trevor’s gravelly voice crackled back ***“Send it.”*** 

***“We’ve reached the basement, no power though. Care to help out?”*** 

***“No can do Kid. Nothing in the blueprints of wiring running down there. You’re in the dark now.”***

*‘Of fucking course we are’* I thought as I reached for the light on my rifle. 

*“I’d ask you not to do that.”* A voice came from everywhere and nowhere at once. *“Bright light hurts my eyes.”* It was a woman’s voice. Calm and soothing, like a mother trying to comfort a crying baby. 

No one said a word. I felt the air grow thicker on my shoulders. Like some invisible force was holding me down, preventing me from moving. It wasn’t fear this time that kept me in place. It was exhaustion. I didn’t WANT to move. I just wanted to stand and rest. To close my eyes for a moment. 

*“Allow me to help you child. To light your path into my heart.”* The voice called out to us again. I could feel the weight lift for a moment with the words she spoke. All my cares and worries, gone in an instant as the walls began to move. This low, undulating sound gurgled throughout the room as glowing plants pushed themselves out from the walls and floor. Not all at once but in rows. Two rows, a pathway.

My feet moved on their own. I didn’t so much walk as I shuffled, following this path of bioluminescent plants to wherever they took me. Wherever that voice came from. I knew that I just needed to be in her presence. To be embraced by something so loving. I exited that room and made my way through a long hallway, its walls painted as if by the brush of a gardener, as flowers bloomed from every crack and seam.

Eventually I came to the end of my search. My rest and respite was on the other side of this giant oak door. It stood easily eight feet tall, carved from wood so ancient I could feel her reach out to me through the very fibers from which it was crafted.

*“Come to me my child, come and take your final form away from this fleshy shell.”* I obeyed, and opened the door. Beyond that threshold could only be described as heaven. A bright light bathed over me, warming me to my core. I felt… clean. All the blood and grime coating me beforehand was gone. The sweat that had dripped off my forehead vanished. I was as pure as the woman who stood in front of me. She was the vision of beauty, wrapped in a white floral gown, with long dark hair that went to her waist, a smile that made me melt, accented by a dimple on her right cheek.  

She opened her arms wide, beckoning me to embrace her, white petals falling from her hands. I did everything I could to make my way to her. As tired as I was, dammit I would crawl if I had to. My hands reached out to her. I was speechless. I mean, I could have used a million words to describe her, but the only one that fit was, perfection.

I finally reached her. Reached out for her. Just hoping to have so much as a glancing touch. She reached out with her slender pale hand, caressing my face. I felt that warmth that had touched my soul radiate from her fingertips. It was an overwhelming bliss.  
*“You’re so tired, so pained by this rotted world. I think you’ve suffered enough don’t you?”*

I nodded, my mouth dry and mute. My hands began to go limp as I felt the grip of my rifle starting to slip.

*“I can give you rest.”* She cooed softly. *“Whatever it is your heart desires. You simply need to let me in.”*

I started to nod. To say yes and accept her offer. Finally be able to close my eyes, my mind. I deserved this. But… that’s not what escaped my lips.

***“M-My Friends..”*** I managed to say in a low, monotone, droll after some serious effort. 

She began to giggle. No, that wasn’t quite right. She was laughing. Laughing as if she had just been told a terrible joke. There was nothing soft and comforting. What I had said seemed so ridiculous it amused her.

*“Forget them.”* She said after finally calming herself.  *“ They shall serve me in… other ways.”*

With that, she slowly slid her fingers down my cheek, grabbing my chin and turning it to look behind me. I saw what she meant. 

Past the beauty, past the shimmering light, and an aura of warmth and love, stood an open doorway. A doorway back to the world of grime and pain I had just left. Beyond that doorway, stood three bodies, writhing, and struggling against a sea of dark green vines that had lashed them to the wall. The plants pulsed and shifted oddly. Wriggling at erratic speed as they struggled to pin down the rest of the team. More like tentacles than actual plants.

*“Look at them.”* The woman’s voice rang out again. Just as soft as the first time I heard it, but somehow wrong. Like another voice was speaking in tandem with hers. A low, guttural, almost demonic tone, that slid in under her honeyed words. *“Merely food for my children. Either too stupid, or invalid to accept my gifts.”*

I saw them writhing in agony. Eric using his rifle to try to press the floral mass off of him. Wade, grabbing and tearing whatever he could in half. His mask was cracked and ripped nearly off his face. Paige I could barely see. Only the top of her head was visible while she struggled against the weight. They looked exhausted. Three tiny specs in an ocean of green. Wade’s eyes met mine as the woman spoke again. 

*“Those who fail to evolve need not worry about rest. They will rest eternally as those unremembered.”* 

I heard that undertone again. This time only louder. In fact, her voice was the only thing I heard as I looked on, watching my team be crushed. I locked in on Wade again, his eyes meeting mine, and… I could’ve sworn I saw his mouth move.   
*“Do not weep for them.”* The voice was more devil than darling now. A black abyss of malice and hate.

I caught Wade’s mouth moving again and focused intently, trying to read his lips as they strained in the forced silence. One word. Offset.

*“They were never special.”* The demon’s guttural voice echoed in my mind, as my body shivered, like a snake slid its tongue up my neck.

Offset. To combat by distraction. Often using an embarrassing or outlandish memory that can’t be corrupted. I tried to search my brain through the fog that had taken over it. I found nothing. All my thoughts felt gray and foggy. Clouds obscuring my very being. I had to look for something. Something to reach out to and pull reality to me.   
*“They were never like Raul.”*

I found my answer as I tried to get my body to move. My left hand felt like it was stuck in mud as I slowly forced it down my right arm. My eyes remained locked on Wade’s silhouette as it began to be consumed by the mass. I was running on faith as my hand gripped my pinky, pulling it to its furthest point, twinges of pain coursing through my mind. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath.

*“They were never like you.”*

The next sound I heard was my finger breaking at the joint. The one after that was a gut wrenching scream escaping my own lips. My eyes opened and I turned.

The thing before me was no longer a beautiful woman. Her long dark hair became a matted greasy mess that stuck to a sickly green and twisted body. The joints hung in odd angles, protruding through the skin. Her once angelic face now took the form of starfish, budding flowers overgrowing out through white bone, a large black hole sat in the center, oozing out a sickly green slime. No longer did I hear the dulcet tones of a mother. Only alien like clicking and popping  that escaped from somewhere at no set cadence. 

It looked at me for just a moment, jerking its head to the side in confusion. 

It only took another moment for me to draw my pistol and put a round through its face.

The creature recoiled in agony, sending out a pained screech that nearly burst my eardrums. I fought through the pain and fired again. The second shot sent it sprawling to the ground. I rushed forward, trying to ignore my useless hand, as I planted a boot on its chest. 

***“You’re not a god.”*** I said quietly, through gritted teeth. ***“Just a weed with legs.”*** 

The creature roared and shot its face towards me, opening and closing with a gross suckling sound. The only thing it latched onto were the bullets that erupted from the chamber, as I emptied the mag.

It had stopped moving after the third shot. The other five made sure it stayed still. 

I looked around, waving the gun smoke away from my mask, trying to find my bearings once again. The bioluminesce that once lit the room slowly began to fade. All the vines that infested the walls started to wilt and grow limp. That’s when it hit me. 

***“Fuck!”*** I turned and sprinted back towards the doorway. Hoping beyond hope I still had time.   


***“Shit shit shit shit shit. Guys! Can you hear me?!”*** I reached the wall covered in dying vines, frantically pulling at them with my good hand. I didn’t have to dig too long before a large dark hand shot through the pile, then another. They came together and tugged at a massive clump, ripping them out with a sickening sucking sound. The massive body of Wade shot through its confinement, gasping for breath, before turning and grabbing at the vines next to him. 

***“Don’t just stand there man.”*** He shouted, gasping for breath. ***“Help me get the others.”***

It took a few minutes but we managed to claw our way through, dragging a near unconscious Eric and a definitely unconscious Paige from the tangled mass. 

***“We should be good to lay em down.”*** I said, as I sat Paige’s limp body on the dirt, letting out a sharp yelp of pain caused by my finger glancing her kit.

***“What the hell happened?***” Wade asked, as he dropped Eric’s body to the ground with a heavy thud. A low groan slowly came from him that Wade ignored as he walked over and grabbed my hand. 

I sucked in hard through my teeth and jerked away. ***“Ahh! Fuck man! I slept on it wrong. What do you think?!”***

***“Stop flinching.”*** He said, reaching out and pulling my arm into his vice-like grip. “***You’re useless until we get this fixed.”***

***“You’re one to talk…”*** I muttered under my breath.

***“What was that?”*** He looked up at me, cocking an eyebrow. 

***“Oh nothing. But we need to find Raul and grab the flower. We can take care of this later.”***

He cocked his head to the side to give me a ‘really bro?’ look, until his attention was focused elsewhere. He released his grip and stepped past me. 

***“Found him.”*** 

\* \* \*

Raul Delgado was dead. For how long I’m not sure. But his bone white body, trapped against a stone chair by vine-like chains, told me that he had been for some time.

***“Jesus Christ.”*** I said under my breath as Wade searched him. He looked as he did in the picture. Same cocoon like head. Same lattice like bone around his body. Like a weird modern piece of art.

***“Dude’s been dead for months.”*** Wade said, wiping the grime and dirt on the side of his pants. He stood up quickly and thumbed his communicator over to the OP channel.   
***“Whiskey Three to One, how copy?”***

We listened to static for a moment before Trevor came over the other side.  

***“Read you loud and clear Three. Send it.”***

***“Found Delgado, not breathing but we got him here in the basement.”***

Shay’s voice quickly cut through the other line. ***“The flower, Three, did you find the flower?”***

Wade’s eye cut to the lifeless mass of the starfish plant on the ground and let out a heavy sigh.

***“Yeah… We found it. Gonna need a trash bag for it though.”***

***“What the hell do you mean, Three?”*** Shay sounded livid as he spat out over the comm link.

***“I MEAN, that Markus filled it with enough lead to start a pencil factory.”***

There was a long pause on the radio. I was waiting to hear Shay rip me a new one. Instead, Trevor’s mountain man twang came over.

***“Mission Statement accepted Whiskey Three, Sanitation team en route. Do you require medical attention?”*** 

***“Affirmative. And Trevor… be a doll and send a few stretchers would you?”***

\* \* \*

When I left Delgado’s compound, I had to fight the urge to rip my mask off and breathe the fresh air. We stayed for a while with Eric and Paige, waiting for the medics to arrive, and even longer for them to set my finger back and splint it. It only took seeing our sanitation squads scurrying around maskless for me to give in. I quickly unstrapped my mask, breathing heavily through my nose and closing my eyes… I think that was why I didn’t see Shay’s fist as it connected with my temple. 

*“You insubordinate piece of trash.”* 

The force of the blow sent me hard against the wall of the house. I was able to duck just in time as another fist made contact with the siding, cracking it nearly in half.

*“When I give an order, you fucking follow it! This is why Delta died. You and the rest of your shitbag team.”*

I stood up and took a stance. I wasn’t sure if I could take him, in this condition, but I could take enough. I braced myself as he lunged forward. The blow never came. In the blink of an eye, Trevor and Wade had him pinned against the wall, him straining and turning even more red with anger.

*“What the hell is your problem?!”* Trevor bellowed. *“How dare you touch him!”*  
Shay eventually broke free. He was breathing heavily as he stood and pointed a finger my way.  

*“Do you have any idea the amount of money that Orchid could have carried? All for this little shit to waste.”*

*“Need I remind you…”* Trevor began, *“That was the result of immediate reaction on my team's part. I’m not going to lose another one because you’re seeing dollar signs.”* 

*“Oh yeah?”* Shay puffed his chest out and stepped in front of Trevor. They stood nose to nose, neither man taking their eyes off the other. *“Wasn’t that hard for you in Oslo was it?”*

I felt the heat coming from Trevor as he balled his fist. *“You really gonna blame Oslo on me?”*

*“You were the Op Lead, you tell me.”*

*“You got some set of balls saying that…”*  
*“Why is it that when men get into fights, the subject of testicles always comes up?”* Kate’s soft dulcet tones cut through, causing all us to turn. She was standing there with the rest of her team, ghillie suit hanging loosely off of her slender frame, rifle slung across her back. 

*“This doesn’t concern you Watanabe.”* Shay said, his eyes turning back to Trevor. *“Grab your shit and prep for exfil.”*

*“On the contrary…”* she spoke as she elegantly strode to where Shay stood. *“I’d like to think anything related to merc on merc violence would be in the front of any TL’s mind.”* She grabbed him forcefully and spun him to face her. *“Wouldn’t you agree, Shay? After all… friendly fire is a hell of a way to go.”*

The gorilla of a man growled, replying with a sneer. *“Yeah, you would know all about that, wouldn't you doll face?”*

There was a collective hush and intake of air as she giggled softly and leaned to meet his face, her lips inches from him. 

*“I know enough to know you can’t prove a thing. But if the rumors ARE true, then I would know exactly where to bury the bodies wouldn’t I?”* 

That was enough for Shay to stay quiet. He stormed off grumbling something about corporate, and margins. Kate blew him a kiss and laughed again before turning to Trevor, Wade, and me. 

*“Appreciate the help Kate.”* Trevor spoke first, breaking the silence. *“Things were looking hairy for a second there.”*

She waved her hand dismissively. *“Think nothing of it. He’s an ass and all talk. Mostly anyway. Try to actually stay out of trouble yeah?”* She smiled and laughed again, turning and walking back to her team as they loaded into SUVs that were taking us back to the city. *“Dead men are a pretty big turn off for me!”* She yelled out, not looking back as the door shut behind her.

*“I think I’m in love.”* I said after a few moments. The laughter from Wade and Trevor was so loud it masked the sound of the tires from our transport as they pulled up beside us. 

Wade shook his head, still chuckling as he grabbed my rifle and his. *“Dead man walking.”* 

*“Yeah Kid…”* Trevor spoke after seeing the vehicle carrying Eric and Paige off. *“You’ll have a better time surviving on missions than with her. Trust me.”*

*“Oh?”* I asked as I climbed into the passenger seat. *“And how would you know?”*

*“Story for another time kid.”* Trevor grunted as he shut his door. *“Story for another time. Let’s just grab some rest. Gotta report bright and early for an ass chewing tomorrow.”*

He didn’t have to tell me twice. I was already slumped against the window, quickly falling asleep. It had been a long ass night.
