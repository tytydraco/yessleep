There was not much for one to do on campus—well, not much for a woman like me anyway. Socializing or partying was never my strong suit. Plus, not everyone shared my interest in creative writing. Even with these social struggles, I had a couple thousand friends that I would talk to on a daily basis—friends on Discord, Twitch, Kick, and YouTube.

&#x200B;

Since a young age, virtual friends were the only ones I ever had. It was easy to find someone with common interests. They listened and really cared when I ranted or vented. Most real people I’d rant or vent to were terrible actors. Their eyes would say: “Get it over with so I can talk about me.” Their body language said: “I’d rather be anywhere than here.”

&#x200B;

Sometimes being able to read people was a curse. It would’ve been nice to be oblivious once in a while. Other times it was great, like a subtle manipulation tactic to get what I want.

&#x200B;

Streaming and making videos, on the other hand, was the greatest thing I’ve ever come across. You’re telling me I could play my favorite games, socialize in my own reserved way, and make money? Sign me up!

&#x200B;

After a year or so of content creation, I grew a fanbase of ten thousand people and money was rolling in. I didn’t even have to work at McDonald's anymore. After class, I would go straight to my dorm and make content. Life was great for a while, until one night.

&#x200B;

It was a Thursday night. I had just got out of English class and made my way over to my dorm. It was a claustrophobic little dorm. The walls seemed to close in on me with each passing day. It was as if they were synchronized with my shrinking patience. With my twin-sized bed, dresser, and gaming set-up taking up two/thirds of the room, there was hardly any space to walk—let alone stretch my legs.

&#x200B;

With a sigh, I placed my backpack on the bed and sank down on my black desk chair, facing my gaming set-up. My monitor was long and curved, displaying pixels as clear as real life, maybe even clearer. Under it rested a LED keyboard with blue light flickering eagerly. I opened up Kick and spun around in my chair to get the liquor bottle from my dresser. It was a Don Julio 1942 bottle I had tucked away. My father gave it to me for my twenty-first birthday after years of not talking to me.

&#x200B;

Tonight, I was doing my biggest Kick stream yet. I was going to play Call of Duty and every time I died; I had to take a sip of liquor.

&#x200B;

I had to make sure everything was perfect before pressing the stream button. I adjusted my webcam so that the liquor bottle was in the frame. I ran my fingers through my curly brown hair, making sure not a strand was out of place. My eyebrows were thick and lined up. My caramel-colored eyes were a little droopy from school, but I had a feeling they were gonna be a lot more droopy after the stream.

&#x200B;

I pressed the stream button, an icon appeared, signalling I was live. The usual top fans joined faster than light speed. I greeted them as more and more people rolled in.

&#x200B;

“Hey guys! How are y’all doing tonight?” I asked.

&#x200B;

**KittenLover22:** Fan-fucking-tastic, how are you?

&#x200B;

“KittenLover, I’m loving the energy. I’m doing great, ready to get a few kidney stones by the end of the night.”

&#x200B;

**BaddieMaddie7435:** I can’t wait to stream snipe you

&#x200B;

“Good luck, BaddieMaddie. If you can manage to kill me, I’ll drink 2 shots.” I chuckled.

&#x200B;

There were about a thousand people watching, so I loaded up Call of Duty. It was stuck on the loading screen, for some odd reason. It wasn’t the Wi-Fi, no, I had just got the latest router my provider offered. It must’ve been something with the servers.

&#x200B;

“Anyone else stuck on the loading screen? Are the servers down?” I asked.

&#x200B;

**LokiTheTrickster:** No, you just have shit internet.

&#x200B;

**PoopGrandMaster:** Yeah, the servers are down tonight.

&#x200B;

“Ah, shit. You guys want me to play Fortnite in the meantime?”

&#x200B;

**BetterCallWalterWhite:** Fuck no!!!!!

&#x200B;

**HufflePuffinOnZaza:** Nahh, just wait. Take a shot while you do.

&#x200B;

“Where’s the fun in that, Zaza? How about we play a game? If someone guesses what my real name is, I'll take a shot.”

&#x200B;

**KittenLover22:** Your real name is Mine ;)

&#x200B;

I did the sigma face into the webcam. “KittenLover just rizzed me up, not gonna lie.”

&#x200B;

**DeezNutsForPresident:** Frederick Douglass?

&#x200B;

I laughed. “Nope, I’ll give y’all a hint: I’m Mexican.”

&#x200B;

**BetterCallWalterWhite:** Maria de la santa cruz rosalina agnelia rodriguez cuellar rene

&#x200B;

“That’s gotta be racist,” I said.

&#x200B;

**HufflePuffinOnZaza:** Another hint!

&#x200B;

“Okay, okay. It starts with a X.”

&#x200B;

**SlimySlipperySackz:** Xiomara or Xena

&#x200B;

“You got it, slimy! It’s Xena.” I took a sip of liquor, my face scrunching up.

&#x200B;

**PoopGrandMaster:** Hey, btw, you can buy a digital copy of the new Call of Duty on the deep web. They leaked. I can guide you on what to do, just hop on a discord call with me. I think that’ll be entertaining. Anyone else wanna see that?

&#x200B;

“Uhh, I don’t know about that, Poop. I’ve only ever been on the deep web once.”

&#x200B;

The whole chat was spamming yes over and over. They even sent donations, saying that I should do it because it’ll be fun.

&#x200B;

“Thanks for the donations, y’all, but I don’t know.”

&#x200B;

**DeezNutsForPresident:** Ngl, that’ll be more entertaining than a drinking challenge.

&#x200B;

“Yeah, Deez, but it’s the deep web. What if something were to happen? Like an assassin hunts me down or whatever, who knows?"

&#x200B;

**PoopGrandMaster:** Haha, you’ve been reading too many fake Reddit stories. The deep web is not as bad as people make it out to be. I’ll be there to guide you. You have Tor downloaded already, I saw it on your desktop when you were greeting us.

&#x200B;

“Hmm…” My mind was going over every possible bad scenario that could go down. “I don’t know—”

&#x200B;

**HufflePuffinOnZaza:** I’ll donate $1000 dollars if you do this. I swear to god. You know me, I’ve been a fan for a while, when I say I’ll donate, I will.

&#x200B;

My eyes widened. I couldn’t even fathom that someone had a spare thousand dollars they would donate to a streamer. I wish I hadn’t accepted, but I really needed the money. That was more than I would make in a week from donations.

&#x200B;

“Alright, fuck it. Send in your username, Poop. I’ll add you.”

&#x200B;

PoopGrandMaster sent in his username and I added him. I called him and he quickly picked up.

&#x200B;

“H-Hey, poop,” I said in an indecisive tone.

&#x200B;

“A thousand dollars,” a deep voice replied. “You’re gonna get a thousand dollars for buying a sixty dollar game… That’s insane!”

&#x200B;

“No, yeah, It's crazy. I don’t believe it myself. Zaza is a man of his word, though.”

&#x200B;

“So am I. Shall we begin?”

&#x200B;

“Sure, can you see my screen?”

&#x200B;

“Yup,” he said.

&#x200B;

He walked me through everything I had to do. Using the proper VPN, where to find the website, etc. The website was, surprisingly, well designed. It was a one page layout with professional pictures and hundreds of positive reviews. Call of Duty World War 3, it was titled. There were even videos and screenshots of gameplay. The graphics were life-like. When I asked Poop about it, he told me that Activison were experimenting with a new process. *Process?* I thought, *What the hell does he mean by process?*

&#x200B;

I asked him about it.

&#x200B;

“I don’t know, some sort of game mechanic. Anywho, this is gonna sound odd,” he said, “but bear with me. So when you press purchase, the finger you use to press your mouse must be dripping with blood.”

&#x200B;

After an awkward silence, I erupted with laughter. “Good one, you almost had me for a second.”

&#x200B;

There was no laugh on the other end. “I’m serious.”

&#x200B;

“You want me to cut myself and stain my mouse with blood? What the hell is this, some sort of prank?”

&#x200B;

My gut was telling me to turn back. The entire chat was telling me to turn back. I was just about to, when PoopGrandMaster stopped me.

&#x200B;

“Do me one last favor, please. Mute the stream for a second.”

&#x200B;

A million red flags were going off in my head. Every logical thought was screaming at me to not do it. The illogical part of me said: *It’ll only be for a second. If you hang up now, you’ll want to know what he was gonna say later.* Curiosity got the best of me, so I muted it.

&#x200B;

“There,” I said.

&#x200B;

“Xena Lopez. Your childhood home is at 308 Legra Arroyo Lane. Your mother, Daniela, died when you were young and your father, Ignacio, copes by working 12 hour shifts at a warehouse. He doesn’t like being home because, without you or your mother, it’s a void.”

&#x200B;

“H-How?” I stuttered.

&#x200B;

“Need I say more?”

&#x200B;

“But… how? Why?”

&#x200B;

“Prick the tip of your finger with a sharp pencil or something, and purchase the game. It’s fairly rude to keep your stream waiting.”

&#x200B;

My eyes widened to the point where my eyebrows practically touched my hairline. My mind and heart were racing as if they were in an Olympic tournament: *How did he find this information? I was always extra careful when sharing my personal life to my fans, so how? That’s right… The VPN link he sent me. I pressed it. He must’ve got my IP Address from that. But that doesn’t explain why he knows my childhood home. Is he a stalker?*

&#x200B;

“...Xena? Still there, buddy?”

&#x200B;

“I’ll report you to the fucking police,” I said.

&#x200B;

“You can try,” he said. From his tone I could tell he was smirking. “Go right ahead. Call them and I’ll call the Lord of Light. Let’s see which responds quicker. My blood pact or your small town police.”

&#x200B;

*The lord of light? Was this some sort of dark magic witchcraft? Impossible,* I thought, *It must be some sort of blackmail to scam me out of sixty dollars.*

&#x200B;

“I’m calling them,” I said.

&#x200B;

“Awesome, but before you do, wouldn’t you like to see how peaceful your father looks sleeping on his bed, alone. Here, I’ll send you some pictures.” An image popped up in the message box. It was my father sleeping. I nearly passed out.

&#x200B;

He continued, “Those covers are a fine burgundy. I must say, he has great taste. My partner sure believes so. I don’t think your father would mind if he were to join him, right? If anything, having some company will do him good.” He giggled.

&#x200B;

My eyes watered up, tears trickling down my cheek.

&#x200B;

“Stop… I’ll fucking do it, okay? Just stop.”

&#x200B;

“The Lord of Light will be pleased to hear this, Xena. Go ahead and unmute yourself. Act like nothing happened. Buy the game and continue your challenge. The chat is starting to get impatient.” He hung up, leaving me with an unbearable silence.

&#x200B;

I leaned out of frame of the camera to wipe my tears. Clearing my throat, I pressed unmute. “Hey guys… I’m sorry for the wait. He was just giving me instructions on how to download the game safely.”

&#x200B;

Under the desk, I pricked my finger with a mechanical pencil. Blood dripped onto the carpet floor with the rhythm of a leaky faucet. I pressed purchase with my bloody finger and discreetly cleaned up.

&#x200B;

Taking a long shot from the Tequila, I finally spoke up. “Alright, well, that downloaded quickly. Let’s get started!”

&#x200B;

The chat was questioning how the hell it downloaded so fast. They were saying this was sketchy and to delete it because it may be malware. I told them it’ll be fine.

&#x200B;

The loading screen montage was just like the previous games. With flashing images of gunfire and cool-looking desert stages. I acted surprised and excited for the game. In reality, I was relieved my call with Poop ended.

&#x200B;

There was only one play option: **Campaign.** I pressed it. The chat was going crazy. Some people were still suspicious. They had every right to be. Others were just hyped.

&#x200B;

When the game loaded, I found myself looking at a character from the third person. Which was odd because usually Call of Duty games had us in the character’s point of view. I brushed it off as a new “process” they were experimenting with, as Poop said.

&#x200B;

The graphics looked life-like—by far the best compared to any game prior. My character was standing behind a school bus from another country, bullet holes and cracked windows decorating the exterior. He wore greenish-yellow camouflage gear, which sort of blended in with the desert-like environment he was in. There was a USA badge on his shoulder.

&#x200B;

He turned around, waving directly at the camera. “Hey! Give me call outs! You know, like in Call of Duty!”

&#x200B;

*Call outs?* I thought, *Is this a new game mechanic they added? Usually, call outs are something you give your gaming partner… Not your own character.* I pressed the left, right, up and down arrows, but the character wouldn’t move. Gunshots whistled past, ripping through the metal of the bus. The character ducked without me pressing anything.

&#x200B;

“Chat… are y’all seeing this? What the fuck—”

&#x200B;

“That is not a valid command!” The character cut me off. “Give me directions!”

&#x200B;

“Uhh… Return fire.”

&#x200B;

Without me pressing any buttons, the soldier waited for the incoming gunfire to pause and then peeked around the corner, aiming and shooting an entire magazine at a brick building in the distance.

&#x200B;

The gunfire sounded as realistic as they did in war documentaries. A thought occurred to me at that moment: *Was I commanding a real person? A real soldier fighting in a real war? No… That’s impossible. How would that even work?* I chuckled at myself for even thinking that. “These graphics are realistic as fuck, chat! Woohoo, are y’all seeing this?!”

&#x200B;

The chat was ecstatic, sending messages faster than the speed of light.

&#x200B;

**HufflePuffinOnZaza:** Tell him to rush forward!

&#x200B;

**KittenLover22:** I can’t wait for this game to come out! Tell him to aim for the windows. I see heads bobbing in there.

&#x200B;

I smiled seeing how excited they were. Part of me forgot all about PoopGrandMaster and his threats. “I got you KittenLover. Reload and aim for the windows, soldier! Fire when you see movement!”

&#x200B;

The soldier reloaded his M14 and crouched down. He aimed around the corner, firing precise shots at the windows whenever there was any sign of movement. On the top left of the screen, the kill count went up to five. I was cheering at him and hyping him up.

&#x200B;

“What now, chat?”

&#x200B;

**BaddieMaddie7435:** Call in an airstrike for support!

&#x200B;

“Hey! Call in an airstrike!”

&#x200B;

The soldier retracted back into cover and pulled out a walkie-talkie. He yelled some inaudible words into it and put it away. A countdown popped up on the screen, five minutes, it said. Gunfire still rained down on him. His crew of four soldiers walked into frame, hiding behind the school bus as well. They did their own thing, returning fire and throwing grenades. My character waited patiently for my next command.

&#x200B;

**DeezNutsForPresident:** Tell him to do a backflip!

&#x200B;

**SlimySlipperySackz:** Xena, holy shit, this is not a game. Look at the news, this is real.

&#x200B;

“What? Really?” I said, expecting the chat to send in laughing emojis at my gullibleness.

&#x200B;

They were all spamming the same thing, though. They said this war is real and going on in Afghanistan right now. I laughed, brushing it off as a collective prank they were pulling on me. But then I remembered my conversation with PoopGrandMaster. My smile vanished when I looked down at my finger covered with dry blood. *What did I just do?* I thought, *Was I right about this being some sort of witchcraft? Was this a real soldier?*

&#x200B;

***HufflePuffinOnZaza sent a $1000 donation:*** Fuck these trolls. How can someone possibly control a real human? Man, this new game is spectacular!

&#x200B;

I looked back at the screen. One of my teammates peeked over the hood of the bus, returning gunfire. It looked and sounded life-like. Out of nowhere, my teammate's head whipped back and he fell limp on the floor. There was a hole in his forehead. Thick, dark red blood oozed out, forming a pool under him. My jaw dropped to the floor. Rolling back to get a wide view, I realized just how accurate this looked compared to the war documentaries I would watch.

&#x200B;

I clasped my hand over my mouth as I read PoopGrandMaster’s message in the Discord chat.

&#x200B;

**PoopGrandMaster:** You two are linked with a blood contract. You are his Light. Guide him, Xena. Watch over him like the Goddess you now are.

&#x200B;

I felt sick to my stomach reading that and watching the war unfold before my eyes. This was not possible—couldn’t be. It made no logical sense. I needed time alone. I had to end the stream. There was no way I could continue without throwing up.

&#x200B;

“Chat, I’m gonna have to end the stream right here. I hope you guys—”

&#x200B;

**PoopGrandMaster:** Tell them it was a prank. They can’t know this was real. Remember your father.

&#x200B;

This person was sick, evil, wicked. He was blackmailing me to get his way and there was nothing I could do but comply. “B-By the way, guys, this was all a prank. I… I just played a prerecorded war documentary and acted like it was real. I’m sorry y’all. Thank you for tuning in… Until next time,” I said unenthusiastically before pressing the end stream button.

&#x200B;

The soldier on the screen waved frantically, awaiting my orders. The airstrike rained down on the brick building, sending debris out in all directions. Not all of the enemies died, though. Across the battlefield, opposing gunfire still rang out on the ground level.

&#x200B;

My Discord and Kick notifications were blowing up. They said I was commanding a real soldier and that I should be arrested for giving him amateur call outs. There were a few swatting and death threats in the messages. I numbly skimmed through the notifications. I couldn’t muster up the proper emotions to feel. Was I meant to be sad? Angry? Was I supposed to call the police on myself? Or run?

&#x200B;

The soldier waved and yelled at me as his comrades fell dead around him. As I sat there, paralyzed, the soldier met the same fate as his comrades. Bullets ripped through his body. He stood there for a second, body swaying, then fell lifeless to the ground. The screen went black, red letters displaying the words: **Game Over**. Silence settled over the room. All I could hear was the sound of my own heavy breathing.

&#x200B;

A Discord notification popped up. It was a message from PoopGrandMaster. I opened it up.

&#x200B;

**PoopGrandMaster:** Xena, I am beyond disappointed. You, the goddess watching over that poor soldier, have failed. The Lord of Light demands blood for your failure. No matter how much I hate to do it, I will have to give the Lord what he desires. Blood for blood.

&#x200B;

I punched in a response so quickly that it nearly broke my keyboard.

&#x200B;

**Me:** No!!!!!

&#x200B;

**Me:** Stop, please, leave him be!!!

&#x200B;

**Me:** He had nothing to do with this please. I’ll pay for my failure another way. There must be another way… Right??

&#x200B;

**PoopGrandMaster:** Well, now that you mention it, there is another way.

&#x200B;

**Me:** What is it?!?!

&#x200B;

**PoopGrandMaster:** I’ve been a servant of the Lord for quite a while now. It’s about time I retire.

&#x200B;

**Me:** ??

&#x200B;

**PoopGrandMaster:** Replace me, Xena. Use your fanbase to spread the Lord of Light’s message. Use him to guide people. Answer prayers. Give call outs. Be his Goddess. He will be eternally grateful. And, who knows, you may get someone to replace you after a while. ;)

&#x200B;

**Me:** Will my father be left alone? Forever?

&#x200B;

**PoopGrandMaster:** Yes, you have my word.

&#x200B;

*Fuck…* I thought, *it’s either this or my father dies. I can’t let him die. Not like this, not because of me.*

&#x200B;

**Me:** Shit. …Okay, I’ll do it.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Not long after that incident, I dropped out of college—Hell, I dropped off the grid for a while until the heat cooled. With my creative writing skills, I made up a false story that I fed to my fans and the press. My fans were easy to manipulate. All I really had to do was fake cry in front of a camera and then tell them I found religion to repent for my sins—the Lord of Light’s religion. I even recruited some fans. The press was difficult to manipulate, but once I did, they backed off.

&#x200B;

If I’m being 101% honest, part of me enjoyed converting my biggest fans to worship the Lord. To worship me, their Goddess. It fueled an ego I didn’t even know I had. It was fun seeing everyone come up with their own ideas about what happened to me. They got close, but never hit the mark.

&#x200B;

There are hundreds of YouTube theories linking me to the war. They said things like: “I instigated the war to continue.” Or, “I promoted violence.” Other theories said I sold my soul to the devil for fame or that I’m into witchcraft. None of which are true. I gave myself to the Lord of Light, obviously.

&#x200B;

With my father recently passing away from old age, my eyes opened. I realized just how much of an evil person I became. How the influence corrupted me and the way I saw the world. Yes, I accidentally killed that soldier. Many soldiers, in fact. I would host private live streams with my biggest fans and with their help, we’d guide the soldiers, giving them amateur call outs.

&#x200B;

I type this now not to justify my actions, but to tell everyone the truth. I’m tired of selling false narratives. I’m tired of having dead soldiers keep me up at night. Tired of hearing their helpless screams when I try to sleep. Tired of seeing the look in their eyes when they realized their Goddess had failed them. Every single one of them would plead to see their family just one last time before getting mauled with bullets.

&#x200B;

My… My conscience needs to be cleared of that burden. After typing this, I will post it everywhere and turn myself in to the police.

&#x200B;

I am no longer a servant of the Lord of Light—which is how and why I type this confession. One of my tier 3 fans, KittenLover22, replaced me. KittenLover was always my favorite. So when I manipulated him into taking my place, part of me felt bad. He willingly runs my channel now, though, spreading subliminal messages about the Lord of Light to the youth.

&#x200B;

For obvious reasons, I will not give my real channel name. But I will say this: Steer clear from the Lord of Light. The more worshipers he has, the stronger he grows.
