It's difficult to remember how I got here. My memories are becoming more hazy by the day. I'm pretty sure it was winter. Super cold already but not bad enough to stop me and my friends from strolling through unfamiliar places at night.

 It was a nostalgia-trip. Back in school we used to visit haunted and abandoned places regularly, well, anytime one of us came across a creepy story we had to investigate. However, our last venture had been years ago at this point, so we all were a bit surprised when Marc sent us a link to this urban legend site. A ghost town not far from where we grew up? How come we've never heard about it before? Cities don't just appear in no time. But I reckon no-one of us really wanted to question it. 

Our silly little ghost hunting trips were the backbone of our friendship for years and it seems we drifted apart a little since we stopped and moved to different cities. The others have missed the old times as well, so a few nights later, we all met up in front of our old school building. 

When I got out of my car, my two buddies were already there. Marc was basically glowing with excitement while Cora's main focus was on the temperature. 
"Took you long enough, Luke." 
She rubbed her arms and turned to face Marc 
"I hope it's as close as you claim. I don't care to freeze to death tonight. And how should there even be some abandoned place around here? I know every corner of this damn town." 
"Chill, Cora. Why'd you come here if you're just gonna ruin the fun? There's some kind of hidden road, you wouldn't have noticed it. Believe me, I did the research!" 
Cora just rolled her eyes and we went on our way. 

I remember we talked a lot during our walk through the snowy night, but I don't know what about. It wasn't the kind of meaningful nostalgic conversation I was hoping for. Rather some boring "how have you been?" kinda stuff. The town was so eerily quiet. I don't remember a single car passing us by. 

After around half our walk we noticed a tall, blond girl standing with her back towards us. A familiar face. Marleen, a girl from our old class, was just hanging around a frozen pond. She instantly recognised us and was eager to join our adventure. Thinking back, I have no idea what she was doing there alone at night. I don't think any of us even asked her. We didn't question it at the time. We haven't really been close with her back in school but didn't see any harm in her walking with us. Marleen seemed excited to find some lost and haunted place, she never did something like this before. The conversation didn't get any more interesting with her joining.

"It's not far from here, we should be there any minute", Marc said as we trotted down one of the main roads near the town centre. 
"Here? Why here? There's no road leading out of town from the main square. How's that supposed to work?", Cora huffed. 
"Sheesh, just trust me. It's not a road anyways!" "What do you mean ' it's not a road' ?" 
As she finished her sentence we already had our answer. There it was, right between two rundown storefronts. A staircase downward. We all just stopped and stared at it for a moment. Marc smirked at Cora who looked more worried than surprised. 
"This wasn't here, I'm sure." 
She looked at me for reassurance, I silently nodded. This staircase was huge, it resembled an underpass or entrance to a subway station, only way bigger. Dim glowing red and orange lights were illuminating every step. But it didn't come from any hanging lamps, it was the multiple neon signs that hung on the walls of the staircase. Orange lettering inside a red arrow that read "Limit Lane City". 

"Did I promise too much? It's a city, says so on the sign." Marc announced proudly. 
My gaze was fixated on the steps. There was no ground visible from where we stood. 
"Where does it lead?", I asked Marc. 
"Uh, limit lane city i guess? Why don't we go down and find out?" 
"That's so fucked up, I swear this wasn't here before", Cora said, more to herself than us. 
Marc took the first few steps downwards. He stopped to look at us. 
"Are you coming? Don't act so surprised, you knew what you got yourself into." 
Until this point our searches for the supernatural only ever led to some dirty old buildings with the only mystery being if we got to leave without catching a tetanus infection. I could tell this was the kind of place Marc had been looking for all his life. After a moment of contemplation I followed him downstairs. Cora and Marleen joined us soon after. 

Our movements became slow and calculated as we went further. Only Marc seemed to be confident we weren't in any danger. There wasn't anything obviously "dangerous" to see anyways, just a strong unwelcome feeling surrounding us. We passed by many neon signs on either side, all with the arrows pointing down, but that wasn't the weird part. 

There were randomly scattered doors in the walls. Right above steps that were just too short to cover all the length of the doors. I've never seen architecture like that. Purely impractical. We went down for a long while until we reached a normal concrete floor again. 

Weathered white walls with the occasional door. It looked like a hallway in an apartment complex. But even though this building was clearly not in the best shape, it didn't look abandoned. There was some decoration in front of the flats, loose clothing on chairs, bowls of food on outside tables. All drowned in an uncanny silence. The kind of silence you wouldn't dare to break. The walls of doors were arranged like a square going many stories up with a concrete courtyard in the middle surrounded by a chain link fence. No railways or safety measures to ensure people wouldn't just fall down from the top floors. The hallways simply ended one the side facing the courtyard. Daylight was shining down from the open top of this high rise building. As we quietly rounded a corner, Marleen stopped us in our tracks. She shot a shocked look at all of us and pointed her finger towards the inner end of the hallway where the courtyard began. This was where we finally found our missing citizens. 

People were standing like statues on the fenced-in platform surrounded by what looked like sales shelves stocked with different food items. I would have guessed they were dolls if it wasn't for their gazes turning towards us. 
Cora pulled on my sleeve to whisper in my ear. 
"Do you think they need help?" 
The concerned eyes of a young mother with a little girl in her arms followed her as she spoke. I just looked at Cora. I didn't know what to say, didn't even know if saying anything would be the right move. Marc and Marleen were just as petrified as the people inside the fence. Cora turned to the woman and took a step towards her. 

Suddenly the sound of rubber smacking on stone echoed through the building. Cora froze again. The sound came from the middle of the courtyard, but it was impossible to see this far from our standpoint. After a moment of silence Cora took a deep breath and continued forward. I didn't hear what she said to the woman but saw the woman's panicked face as she gestured her to be silent. 

Then another smack, this time not on stone. It sounded softer. The sound reminded me of playing dodgeball in school. Could it be coming from a ball? What was going on here? Cora carefully took a few steps back. Marc waved his hand to have us go up one floor to have a better view of what might be going on. My eyes lingered a moment longer on the woman. She had stopped looking at us but her daughter didn't. Right as I was about to turn and follow my friends towards a nearby staircase I heard the smack again. It really was a ball. This time it hit an elderly man not far from where the mother was standing. He stumbled and groaned as he fell to the floor. He landed behind a shelf out of my view. Every pair of eyes shot towards him in shock. As I turned to rush up the stairs to get a better perspective, I saw something dark rush by. By the time I joined my friends on the ledge of the first floor hallway, the elderly man was gone. 

From up here, the courtyard looked like a huge, monotonous grocery store which had its walls replaced by chain link fencing. Dozens of people were scattered around the square, frozen in various poses. There was still a ball slowly bouncing away from where the old man used to stand. Then, all of a sudden, the fence started to move downward into the ground. People were taking deep breaths and starting to move again. But to our confusion, they didn't act panicked or odd in any way, they just returned to their shopping and behaved as if nothing had happened. They even seemed relieved about it. 

Marc pulled us back into a corner next to the staircase we just came from. 
"What the fuck was that!?", he whispered intensely. "How should I know?!", I whispered back. "Whatever the fuck this place is, it's not abandoned and I hope to God it's not even real. We're going to leave right now!", Cora whispered sternly. 
We got back out of our little corner and rushed down the stairs. 

Other citizens now started appearing from the apartment doors, most of them walking towards the mock grocery store. Some were starting quiet conversations but stopped talking once they came near us. They looked at us a little confused but quickly returned to ignoring us. As we passed by the corner where Marleen had previously stopped us, I saw the little girl watching us. Our eyes met before her mother picked her back up and carried her away, deeper into the maze of shelves. 

Cora was leading our sprint back up the broad, dimly lit staircase full of neon signs. I could barely keep up with her. I felt my stomach drop as I saw light coming from the entrance. It was still the middle of the night. Well, it wasn't down in limit lane city, but in what we knew as our reality, it was. As Cora reached the top of the staircase she let out an ear piercing shriek. As I resurfaced as well, she was kneeling on the ground with her hands covering her face. We were facing a vast and empty field on a cloudy day. As far as I could see, there were just grass fields and distant forests. No trace of the snowy town we grew up in. Marleen was stammering something I didn't understand while Cora started shouting 
"No no no! This isn't the right staircase, we must have taken the wrong one. I want to go home!" Marc tried pulling her up, ensuring her that this was the wrong staircase and they would surely find the right one if they went back down and looked for it. He put her arm over his shoulder and helped her back down the stairs. He looked at me, I turned my head towards the field, he understood and took the girls back down the stairs without me. This wasn't the wrong staircase. The apartment complex wasn't big enough to lead anywhere we wouldn't be able to see from here. We were trapped. Marc had finally found a real haunted place like he always wanted. But neither of us wished for something like this. 

I took a moment to calm down and watched the clouds pass by. I hadn't realised how warm it had gotten since we first entered the underground city. There were no sounds but the wind and the air smelled like grass and flowers. In any other situation I might have appreciated it. After a moment of peace, I noticed movement out of the corner of my eye. There were two people talking in the distance, standing on an embankment in front of a forest. Even though I couldn't make out their faces, they seemed weirdly familiar so without much thought, I started running towards them. I saw the younger guy disappearing behind the wall of grass. The older one followed him shortly after. In that quick moment, I thought the older man looked a lot like my father. He had the short, grey hair and glasses to match. Maybe that's why he felt so familiar in the first place. 

As I reached the embankment I hadn't seen any sign from them in a good minute. As I started climbing up the incline, a horrifying sound caused my blood to freeze. Wet chewing mixed with a deep growling. I tried to stay low as I kept creeping up the hill. Wet grass was brushing past my face. I would never forget what I saw on the other side of the embankment. 

Something was taking apart the older man piece by piece. No animal I had ever seen but it must have been an animal. I couldn't look at it longer than a split second before I let myself slide back down the slope and ran back towards the staircase in the middle of the fields. The tint of dark blood was already burned into my retinas.  I turned my head a few times, worried the thing would follow me, but it must have been occupied with devouring the guy. 

By the time I reached the stairs, my heart was racing like mad. I was breathing so heavily my lungs burned and I couldn't breath as much as I coughed. My legs were trembling and I slipped and slid down the last few steps. Slamming against the concrete floor was barely an inconvenience at this point. I didn't even bother to get back up, just crawled around a corner so the monster couldn't see me in case it was chasing me after all. I held my knees towards my chest as I tried to calm my breathing again. People just passed by me, pretending not to notice me. What is this place? Where the hell am I?
