There’s a man pretending to be a cat at the bottom of my stairs. He’s been sitting there, pawing at the stairgate and making soft mewing noises, every night this week. I wish he’d stop.

A little over a month ago, he showed up at the back door, rattling away at the cat flap as though Silver, my kitty, had lost the magnet to her collar again. But no, it was him, standing gormless and draped in black. His face, a pale smear beyond the frosted glass. I thought he’d get bored, then go away. Perhaps he was off his head on drugs or something and had mistakenly arrived at my house thinking it was his own.

Then, one night—and I still have no idea how he managed it—he squeezed himself through Silver’s cat flap. I shot across the kitchen when I saw him, crouched upon the white tiles. His face lowered into Silver’s bowl, tongue slowly lapping at her food. He didn’t even acknowledge me as I stood watching him, frozen with fear and disgust. Though he must’ve understood my screams, because, as soon as I dialled for the police, he twisted his body back out the cat flap and disappeared through a loose panel in my garden fence.

But now... Now, he’s in my house every night. I’ve tried securing the place, changing all the locks, boarding up the cat flap, even replacing the entire back door. But somehow he still gets back in. 

No one believes me either. He’s never there when the police arrive. And always seems to evade sight when a friend stays the night. 

Everyone’s stopped coming over. Instead, they openly wear their frustration and impatience, their growing concern.

What's worse is that I’m pretty sure the police have now flagged and deprioritised my number, because the responders refuse to hide the sighs they blow into the receiver and repeatedly ask: “Has he done anything to hurt you yet?”

I just wish I didn’t feel so alone. 
I also wish I knew what he wanted.

Now, I sit up in my bedroom, with my duvet pulled up to my nose, and the police cackling down the phone, knowing how swollen my house is with darkness. And I trick myself into thinking that I hear him, scuttling about in my living room, clawing at my sofa and knocking pillows onto the floor. 

I wonder what he is thinking, whether he simply wants a warm place to stay in the night or something more. 

Silver hasn’t eaten in days and now enters my house through a first storey window, scaling a neighbour’s lean-to and dancing across the roof shingles. Like her, I refuse to leave my room after dark. Because when I see him, sat there, with his head cocked and those wide, unblinking eyes, I wonder when he will make his way up those stairs and decide it is time to curl up at the bottom of my bed, nose at my toes and purr in the darkness, all night long.
