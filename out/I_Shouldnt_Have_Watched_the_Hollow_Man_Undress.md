Have you ever considered that creatures from urban legends might just be people in disguise? I don’t know if you believe those histories. I did.

Until I saw them undress.

My job is brutal. It wears me down. It's horrific, really — but it’s also important. Still, after what I saw... I think I’m done.

I’m a trained journalist. I spent years chasing scoops, uncovering dark secrets, digging into the ugliest parts of our society. A while back, the police started taking notice. They contacted me — praised my work, even. Asked if I wanted to assist them on cases they weren’t equipped to handle. Things that required the kind of experience I had gathered in the field.

Most of the cases were tied to hidden forums. Networks operating on the darknet. Maybe you’ve heard of the internet cult called 764? I won’t get into it here. What they do is... disgusting. You can look it up yourself if you really want to.I helped the police track some of them down. That work nearly broke me.

The people involved in 764 — if you can even call them people — show the worst of what lives inside us. The urges that are so vile they don’t make sense.

But I’ve always been drawn to that. I’ve always wanted to understand:Why do they want it? Why do they keep doing what they do? Is it power? Excitement? Some kind of twisted thrill?

I still don’t know. And that’s probably for the best. Especially after what I’ve found now. I don’t want to dig any deeper. Because this time, I think I’ve ruined my life

There are many cases within police work that the public never hears about. Mostly for the sake of the public—because if the truth ever got out, their world would be turned upside down. The cases I’ve been involved in are often unexplainable. The police haven’t found answers—or at least not ones anyone would believe. Technically, I’m not allowed to write about them. You deserve to know the truth. And I need your help to figure this out.

One case that stuck with me, and led me to where I am now, began with a call about a tall, lanky man. In police reports, he is referred to as ‘the Hollow Man,’ a name given to him because of his unnervingly tall, faceless appearance.

In the spring of 2024, the emergency dispatch in northern Minnesota received a call from two girls, around 13 years old, saying a scaringly tall man was standing outside their window. 

He wore a gray suit, a white shirt, and a red bow tie. In the breast pocket of his jacket, the man had a matching red handkerchief. Despite the girls’ panic, they managed to give the emergency operator a very detailed description of him. They described him as… hollow. As if his clothes weren’t fitted on a physical body at all, but simply hung there, existing on their own.

The man was about 10 or 11 meters away and just standing there, staring. But he had no face. They described how he had a gray head, completely featureless. The girls were terrified. They screamed that the police needed to come right away. During the call, they said the man was getting closer and closer, still staring. Then the call cut off.

When the police arrived, the girls were gone. There were no signs of violence—everything was in perfect order. Even the door was locked. The police managed to track their phones, a mile into the woods, but no girls. No bodies. Nothing.

The family received little information about the call, only that the girls had reported a man outside. Not that he was chalk white, about 8 feet tall, and faceless.

A search was launched. They looked desperately for the girls, but found nothing. The case was closed. But I couldn’t let it go.

However, this was not the first encounter with the Hollow Man, and it was certainly not the last. Several calls had come in about a tall, gray man who simply stood and stared. They all described him wearing different suits. Sometimes expensive, sometimes worn. Black, white, gray – and in one case, a screaming red one glowing in the dark. But this particular case was special, because the girls had vanished without a trace.

Usually, when the police arrived at the scene of a report, there were no major issues. Most callers were shaken and distressed, but no one had ever been harmed. Sometimes the man had rattled the door handle or banged on a window; in those cases, the people who had called were hiding in a bathroom or some other place of refuge. There were, however, two details that always came up, a pattern that made the police call him the Hollow Man. Everyone described him as hollow, just like the girls. And then, every damn time—cologne. Each time, both the callers and the police reported a strong scent of men’s cologne lingering in the air, as if left behind by an absent wearer.

After the case with the young girls I asked one of the investigators for more details, for access to their classified database, but got a sharp no. He told me it wasn’t my case, that it was completely out of my hands.

But as you can guess—I couldn’t let it go.

So I started digging. Way too deep.

And now I think—no, I’m certain—I’ve found the answer.

After the girls’ disappearance, I started reading more about the Hollow Man. I searched the internet. Started with creepypastas, then Reddit and other similar forums. I dug deeper and deeper. I came to learn that this creature—or man—goes by many names.

At first, I held myself back from accessing the police's internal databases, but then… then I met Leah.

Leah started working as an investigator with the police in the fall of 2024. We clicked immediately and became close friends—maybe a little too close. We started a relationship and kept it secret. It’s not exactly appropriate to sleep with your colleagues, especially not your boss.

Anyway, Leah was the head of a department that primarily investigates unexplainable cases—the kind the public never hears about. She was amazing at her job and not narrow-minded like many others can be. She was open to all kinds of solutions, even the ones others would call completely idiotic. But she always made them seem naïve—Leah made us understand that there was much more out there than we dared to believe.

Leah and I talked a lot about the case with the girls and the mysteriously tall man.

One night, four months ago, we were lying in my bed. I had my head on her chest, and she was gently playing with my hair. I was about to fall asleep. Suddenly she flinched, like something clicked in her mind. And then she said something that made me laugh.

“Have you ever considered that creatures from urban legends might just be people in disguise?”

I sat up, looked at her silently, then burst out laughing.

“What?? What are you talking about?”

But Leah just gave me *that* look—the one she gave when she thought someone was being naïve. Her green eyes drilled into mine. Even though I was the one laughing at her question, her look made me feel like she was the one who should’ve been laughing at me.

“Think about it. There are many types of criminals. Tons. And there are those who hide behind a mask.”

I kept staring at her.

“Okay, but what does that have to do with mythical creatures? You mean people dress up like, what, a vampire and commit crimes? What?”

“Yeah, kind of. There’s cosplay, after all…”

I interrupted her:

“But Leah, come on…”

“No! Don’t *Leah* me. I think I’m onto something, I really feel it. I want you to look into it. Like, methodically. Or no—you will. I’m assigning it to you as a case.”

And that’s when the whole “don’t sleep with your boss” thing came up again. She looked at me in that strict way, and I knew there was no point in arguing.

“Okay… Sure. So, you mean I can use the police databases? And like… the darknet? I’m allowed?”

“Yes. You’re allowed.”

Said and done. I was now supposed to investigate whether regular people were dressing up as the Hollow Man and abducting young girls.

Not exactly what I thought I’d be doing when I signed up for the police job.

I worked my ass off. I sank deeper into the secret caves of the internet but got nowhere. I came across the strangest websites—things you wouldn’t believe—but none of it was what I needed. My sleep worsened, I barely ate, and work became indistinguishable from my free time.

But ten days ago, I found something. An anonymous user sent me a link:

[**http://dollsocietyg7xq3w.onion**](http://dollsocietyg7xq3w.onion)

*Doll Society?*

Anonymous users send random links all the time. I usually ignore them, but Leah’s words echoed in my head: disguise. Could it be connected? Was it worth the risk?

I clicked the link. The screen went pitch black. Nothing but darkness. I saw my own reflection. It looked awful. My cheekbones stuck out like sharp edges, my face sunken, my eyes hollow.

Then—suddenly—a blinding light. The screen turned bright white.

**“ARE YOU A PART OF THE DOLL SOCIETY?”**

It was written in all caps. Two options: yes or no. I chose no.

**“WHY ARE YOU HERE?”**

A text box appeared—max 100 words. What could I say? I couldn’t exactly admit I was on a secret police assignment. I kept it vague:

**“I want to know more.”**

**”OF COURSE YOU WANT. WHY?”**

What the hell? Was I talking to a person? AI? The first two questions felt automated. Now... it felt like someone—or something—was aware. Watching. Another 100-word limit. I typed:

**“I think I want to join the society.”**

The screen loaded. Blinding white again.

**“OK. KNOW YOU WILL ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS. ARE YOU READY? YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE TO ANSWER EVERY QUESTION.”**

What was this?

**“Yes.”**

More loading. Then black again. And then—a form. 204 questions. Yes or no only.

**“Have you worked with textiles?”**

I hadn’t. But something told me to click yes.

**“ERROR. TRY AGAIN.”**

What?

I clicked yes again.

**“ERROR. YOU SHALL NOT LIE. TRY AGAIN.”**

My stomach clenched. This was wrong. Very wrong.

I stared at the words:

**”YOU SHALL NOT LIE.”**

Was I being watched? That anonymous link… had they accessed everything about me? My searches? My files?

Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

I should’ve stopped. But I couldn’t shake Leah’s look. I was naïve.

I clicked no. Next question:

**”Can you use a sewing machine?”**

I actually could. Yes.

The questions continued—nothing disturbing, just detailed. Costumes, stitching techniques, embroidery, materials. About 100 questions in, the tone shifted.

**”Have you ever had your face painted?”**

Like, as a kid at carnivals? Yes.

**”Are you allergic to any makeup products?”**

No.

**“Do you like makeup?”**

Yes.

And so it went—**100 more questions**, this time about makeup.

Now, there were only four questions left.

**"Have you ever committed a crime? Have you ever thought about committing a crime? Have you ever wanted to kill someone?"**

*What the fuck?* Reality slammed back into me. What the fuck am I doing? What IS this? Where the fuck have I ended up? No, no, and NO.

**"Have you ever killed a person?"**

I stared at the screen. My eyes burned. My heart was pounding in my chest—so hard it hurt. This had genuinely, completely gone too far. I didn’t care if I was naïve.

I remembered the times I’d ended up on the wrong corners of the internet before. Seen the worst of the worst. I couldn’t go there again. Could it get worse than that?

I fought with myself. My job was to look for people who disguise themselves as creatures. But—what, they killed people too? Was I, a small, practically invisible journalist, supposed to be the one to find this? A network of people dressed as the Hollow Man, murdering others?

Was that really my role in all this?

My nose started running. I reached for a tissue. Blood. Dark red blood. I had never had a nosebleed before.

The screen flickered. Static. Then it stopped and turned white, blinding me.

**“YOU HAVE ONLY ONE MINUTE TO ANSWER EACH QUESTION. TRY AGAIN.”**

My nose was still bleeding. I shoved a wad of tissue up my nostril and clicked no.

The screen went black. The nosebleed had stopped.I looked at the clock. I had been doing this for four hours.

**”WELCOME. YOU ARE NOW PART OF DOLL SOCIETY. PLEASE READ OUR RULES.”**

I wasn’t allowed to give my real name, where I lived, or any personal details. I wasn’t allowed to ask others for theirs either. The list went on. After reading it all, I accepted the terms. And then…

I saw the Hollow Man **undress**.

It was a video. The Hollow Man stood there, staring straight into the camera. He was in the woods, maybe three meters from the lens. Then he started walking toward it. I couldn’t move.

Slowly, methodically, he unbuttoned his jacket. Then his shirt, one button at a time. He took them off. Underneath was a plain white T-shirt. Then the pants. Beneath them were legs—on stilts. He stepped down from them.

He took off his hands. White gloves. It was all just a costume. Underneath the Hollow Man was an ordinary man. He removed his mask—but his face was blurred out.

I sat frozen. **Leah was right.**

The comment section…It didn’t differ at all from posts about cute dresses or influencer makeup routines.

**“Amazing job! Did you sew the gloves yourself?”**

**“Where did you buy those stilts? They look sturdy—mine always wobble so I can’t go out as the Hollow Man yet.”**

I was stuck. And a complete idiot.I kept scrolling. Deep down I knew I was acting like the character in horror movies who runs straight into the ghost’s arms. But I couldn’t stop.

People were sharing tips—yellow contacts, waterproof makeup. Some asked for help, others offered it. I saw countless videos of the creatures taking off their costumes. A man dressed as a goat-creature peeling off his beard. A girl with black eyes and white-covered face taking of thick layers of makeup to show how well it covered. Then there were tutorials: How to pick a locked door. How to clean up blood. The best products to remove... traces. How to hide a body.

I felt sick to my stomach. What the hell was I supposed to do? Who was I supposed to tell? This had to come out. I had to tell Leah.

But something in me resisted. I didn’t understand it—why I felt possessive, jealous almost. What if someone else took credit for what I’d found? This was *my* story. No one else's.

Then the screen went black. Panic. I hadn’t documented anything. No screenshots, no evidence. I needed to go back.

Suddenly, I was in the chat again—with the anonymous user who’d sent me the link to Doll Society. I clicked it.

**"Safari can’t open the page because the page doesn’t exist."**

What?I had just been there.I clicked again. And again. Nothing. It was gone.

And that’s when it all began.

It’s been three days now. I’ve started seeing them. Dark shadows in the corner of my eye. Tall, thin shapes. People stare at me—on the subway, at the store, during walks. And then they start to *smile*. Wide, sticky grins. And their eyes… jet-black, or glowing yellow, or just—gone. Some of them just had white eyes. No pupils. Nothing but white, staring straight through me.

Yesterday, I saw him. I was coming home from work, taking my usual subway line. I always stand at the back end of the train—it’s closest to my exit. I was scrolling on my phone, barely functioning.

Then something jolted through me. My hairs stood up, one by one. I looked up.

At the far end of the platform, he was standing there.He stared at me with that blank, white face. Slender. Faceless.

I couldn’t look away. He started walking toward me—slowly.I backed away, equally slow. Then—bang. I hit the concrete wall behind me. My head slammed hard. I screamed and lost balance. When I looked up again, he was gone.

The train pulled in. I was alone. But a faint trace of cologne still hung in the air. He *had* been there. A man. Dressed as the Hollow Man.

I got on the train. Shaking. The car was empty.

I’ve lost it. I’ve gone insane. I wouldn’t believe it myself—If it weren’t for the smell. That cologne proved it. It was real. All of it. And now they’re after me.

I ran home, fast.

And now it’s just past 5:00 a.m. Someone just rang my doorbell.

I know it’s one of them. I can’t look. I don’t know what to do.

I tried calling Leah. Straight to voicemail. No one’s answering.

Now I’m here. Alone.

With a man dressed as something I don’t dare face.
