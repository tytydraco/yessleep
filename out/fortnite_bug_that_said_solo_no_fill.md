Okay I gotta get this out quick because I don’t know if I’ll remember this tomorrow.. Sorry for any grammar issues, I gotta start this now.. Okay, so I was playing Fortnite right?? Stuck late at night in a lobby with my friend, and they left the call and just got off.I decided maybe I could play one solo game and then hit the hay. I feel super lonely when I accidentally still have duos on post calls, so I always check to see that I’m on solos.. Strange enough! I looked right after he left and it already says solos!! So I’m like “damn.. That's pretty weird!!” I check again and there’s something even weirder.. Get this: it said “SOLO NO FILL”. No fucking duh “NO FILL” last I recalled I wasn’t trying for a kid. I pressed Solos on the game tab and it still said the same thing.. Whatever, it’s probably just a funny glitch like the moss news page or whatever. For some reason, I decided to still try it out.

It was a bummer thinking I found myself alone in squads again, but maybe it was just solos. Turns out it was worse. My Soulja Boy jamtrack stopped playing mid loading and I flinched from the preparation. That was normal, regular things that Fortnite just did– most games do. The loading screen was odd though, I think it was jonesy holding a red shotgun sheltering during a gunfight, but his face looked like a strange caricature. The best way I can explain it is a rubber “eraser” like texture and giant, swollen eyes. I’d say it may have looked racist, but I don’t know who would be offended by it, it was throwing way too many shots at way too many people. 

The game started, and finally “NO FILL” made sense. It’s completely empty, I can't even see myself. Cogs were turning in my head at what this bug could be, probably issues with implementing first person into the BR gamemode, and other servers conflicting with mine. I thought, if I was the first person to record it I might get some notoriety in the community, so I set up my recording software OBS in by a keybind I had made. It then started playing some ambient lofi like track, repeating every 16 seconds with a quiet audio tick sound, probably the tracks relaying imperfectly.

Timer was long, about 1,200 seconds. So yeah, this was definitely a server based bug. I still thought it was interesting so I spent that time exploring the vacant spawn island, exploring the garage usually covered up with a few battlebuses, and there was a pit to go down to a bunker, again, vacant. Sprawls of mixed textures, some glitching into each other that made it look like a shiny dress, not any different from any basic bug. Files, ones you couldn’t datamine were there. And again, the caricature faces showed up again. This time unfinished models of them, low poly, like they were meant to be seen from far away.

It kind of felt like a museum. From someone who’s only been playing this game for a few years, it's really interesting to see. I thought there would be something conclusive too, like a written message, since in some of these textures I could somewhat read text written about someone's father and how he conquered something?? Not even in the fortnite font either, it was a long stretched out serif font, that was both elegant and choppy. It was lonely yeah, but it was nice for a while to just wait and read. Another theory popped up, maybe it's free roam? I could move freely and fly wherever I'd like, even if the map felt featureless and vast. For a short while I thought it was calm, and I was dreading whatever would happen when time ran out. The clock was ticking down to an irregularly fast degree at around the middle point between 700 - 600. 


An eerie alarm sound played right then, at 660 seconds if I remember right. To calm things down, I tried to do something funny like an emote, It didn't work. I mean, if I didn’t have an avatar I couldn’t do anything with them right? Time was ticking out and right as it was getting out, one of those monochrome caricature models started moving towards me. It was careful, not even shaking, it was calm and collected. I quickly moved so I couldn’t see it and clip to the top of the island, out of the bunker. It was worse, the entire island was filled with these gray… things, proper modelling, still no texture. Their heads moved towards me.

I don’t know what happened, it just cut off, black screen again. That ambient music played.. rough, sounding.. Then nothing again. I calmed down, closed my eyes and breathed. When I finally decided to focus again, I was where the bus lets afk players go. Just hanging in the air. I could see myself again too, it was raining. Some kind of conversation between 2 women started playing through my speaker. They weren’t speaking english, it sounded almost arabic. Eventually, one of them started whispering like they were praying for them to live another day. It played on for what felt like hours on loop. Whispering. Whimpering. Until eventually, full on sobbing. A feminine face was slowly flashing onto screen with what looked to be some kind of legal document, I didn’t have time to catch it on time but I have some photos linked below.

Once she had asphyxiated onto the screen and latched to it that sorta noise filter a broken feed gets sprung and clashed to her face, pouring from their eyes. Its smiling disposition became deafening and quickly disappearing into an expressionless crawl. Vacant sockets replaced with almost bullet like holes, divots and triangular broken skin surrounding the small but delicately pitch black holes. The static had heavy contrast now, some parts of her skin I could barely see. A part of me felt disgusted by seeing her, and apart of me felt ashamed by her seeing me.

Before I could barely realize, her jaw slowly and methodically dislocated from her mouth, allowing it to be open for me. Even if the static had a visual effect, I can still remember how smooth its skin looked. No pores, no wrinkles, almost like a wax figure. Yet even still, she was moving. I heard the women’s voices clamper down as a distorted purring of a whale called for silence. I couldn’t understand what was hurting them or if it was by a person, all I knew is that as soon as the whale finally reached full silence, its jaw swung straight off its face, leaving only its esophagus.

My avatar went from skydiving, to slowly hovering up. Then, the skybox vanished. My character was floating in the dark empty environment. That text from earlier started spreading across my screen, words like:

Demand, collapsed, pyrrhic, Thought, Think, Water, Submerged, Freezing

These textures seemed old, maybe older than the first Fortnite trailer, hell, they didn’t even look like they came from a game at all. This krusty, paper krinkles and distortions made it hard for me to pin down from the few seconds they were on screen. By the time they left I could finally recognize my skin. And like everything else, it wasn’t one chosen by me. It was that perfect woman again, a real photo plastered into a disgusting infection of a model.

If games had flesh this one was rotting. My Fortnite had opened up somehow and showed me the mess of information they had been hiding from the public. Those isolated feelings separated from my emotions effortlessly overhead by adrenaline, gone. This was right in front of all of us and we never even knew. Just sitting alone at a screen, interrupted by constant bribery, desiring, wishing for something that could warm my thoughts for just a second. I stayed all night in that state, waiting for my skin to stop floating in the air. It was a Sunday so I had to get to school in the morning.
