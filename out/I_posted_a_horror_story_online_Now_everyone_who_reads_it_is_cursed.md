Ever since I was a kid, I’ve loved horror. It started with Goosebumps. I’ve read every book and watched the entire series. I still remember the feelings of fear, excitement and curiosity all at once. That was just the beginning. As I grew older, I didn’t just read and watch horror, I started writing my own short stories.

I posted them on Reddit, mostly in horror subreddits. My writing steadily improved. I explored all kinds of themes: creatures, serial killers, curses, rituals; you name it. I learned how to build suspense, mislead the reader, and twist the ending. I learned the art of keeping my readers hooked till the end. Comments and upvotes motivated me to keep going. I thought I understood how fear worked, how these stories worked. I used every trick I knew to keep readers hooked until the end.

But, nothing prepared me for what happened with the latest story that I posted online!

It wasn’t fiction this time. I decided to write about something that actually happened to me.

I must have been 12 years old when we were on vacation in Miami, Florida and we visited a  town called Lazy Lake. My mom’s best friend lived there and we stayed with her for a few nights. Lazy Lake was a tiny town with a population of less than a hundred. Being so small, it was a really tight-knit community; everyone knew everyone. It was the kind of place where strangers stood out.

But one thing happened in this town. Something I had never experienced before and something I never forgot. Every Friday evening, the people of this town gathered at the only park there. It had a small fire pit area on one side and a modest playground on the other. The place was a beautiful, peaceful spot to spend a quiet evening, but at just 12 years old, what I saw there that night left me unsettled for days. I stopped going to parks after that incident.

People were gathered around the fire pit. Some old men were chanting something and the others were listening intently throwing nervous glances at each other every so often. I was watching them from the swings in the playground. Another girl, just a few years older than me was swinging next to me. “Haven’t seen you before,” she said “are you visiting someone?”

“Yeah, my mom’s friend…Ms. Williams.””Oh, I know her. She is a teacher at my school and is very kind.” she said.

I smiled and looked back at the group of people near the fire pit. Then, without warning, a woman started jumping up and down, shaking her hands and head as if she was in some trance and had no control over her body. Moments later, a man began doing somersaults. He did five somersaults in a row, then turned around and did five in the opposite direction. Once again, he turned and did five somersaults. He did this for several minutes as if he was stuck in a loop. I couldn’t hold my questions in anymore.

I turned to the girl on the swing next to me, “ what are those people doing?”

“It’s a ritual,” she said casually. “They do it every Friday. Our ancestors learned that a lot of times, cursed individuals don’t act possessed or scream in strange voices. That’s just some clever way movie makers use to hook people to watch those shows. In reality, these cursed people are quiet and appear very normal. But they are dangerous. There have been incidents here that most kids don’t know. They are too scary, you know. And the people who know aren’t  allowed to talk about them. That’s when this ritual started. The old wise men of our village chant and people who are cursed, react and do these weird things under the influence of those holy chants. That’s how we identify them. They are the ones hiding something.”

As she spoke, my heart raced. I was witnessing something real. It wasn’t just a story or a show. It thrilled me, but my excitement soon turned to fear.

The woman and the man suddenly stopped and turned in our direction. They just stood there, not moving and staring at us for a couple of minutes though it felt like hours. There was something in their eyes I could see even from that far. They looked sunken and hollow in their sockets with their pupils glowing in the light of the fire. Then the woman raised her arm and pointed at us. A chill ran down my spine.

”Why is she pointing at us?” I turned to the girl beside me. I thought she might have some rational explanation to it. But she was gone. The swing next to mine was empty. I hadn’t heard her leave. It felt like she just vanished in thin air. I ran home and didn’t sleep that night. The next morning, I asked Ms. Williams about the ritual. She looked confused, “There is no Friday ritual here. What park are you talking about?” I begged my mom to leave the town. She didn’t argue. We packed up and left Lazy Lake for good but the memory of that night has haunted me ever since.

That was the story I posted. Nothing exaggerated, no plot twists, just my real raw experience that I could never explain. I published it and waited for someone to comment on [it.It](http://it.it/) didn’t take long. The first comment came in. “Really, I experienced the exact same thing when I was a teen.”

Ummm, that’s a strange coincidence!

Then the second comment.. “I had a dream about this two years ago. Didn’t know this happened for real.”

The third comment “ This brought back awful memories. My sister went insane staring at a mirror just like you described.”

The fourth comment was from the first person who had commented on my story. “ What the hell! I just re-read the part about the hidden attic in the house where Tom dies and my uncle died yesterday the same way, the same place. Its not similar, its identical! What kind of witchcraft is this?”

Fifth comment “Why did you write this? I’m going crazy reading this.”

I froze. I re read my story. The one I posted, The one I drafted. I even opened the site incognito and read the story. It was about my experience in Lazy lake. I never wrote about any hidden attic or any death or any mirror. What were these people reading? Why were these comments so unrelated to my story?

Then another comment popped on my post: “This part of your story isn't just a legend. It happened for real in my town.There was a myth in my town that if you stayed up late, a three headed woman came to your house in the night. She’d terrorize you and then kidnap you. If that happened, you would never be found. This myth spread rapidly across town between kids… in schools, in playgrounds. Many just laughed it out, some were indifferent and some really believed in it. My little brother’s best friend was a believer. He was so anxious that he couldn’t sleep at night. It just went in a cycle. The fear kept him awake and the more he stayed awake, the more he obsessed with the three headed woman thinking she would take him feeding his fear. My brother tried to explain to him it was just a myth but he wouldn’t believe. And two weeks later the kid mysteriously disappeared from his home in the night. The whole neighborhood searched for hours,the police searched for days but there was no sign of him. No calls for ransom from kidnappers, no traces of struggle in the house, no clues anywhere, nothing. He just vanished. My little brother still thinks the three headed woman took him.”

I hadn’t written anything like that.

Three days passed since posting my story. It got thousands of upvotes and the comments section exploded. They all claimed my story matched something from their lives. But none of them matched what I actually wrote.

One comment even said “ I like reading comments before I read any story. It kind of gives the feel. But this comment section is all over the place. How can one story be personal to everyone? This is totally messed up!”

I panicked at that point. I decided to delete the story but reddit kept giving me an error. ‘Post locked. You cannot delete this content.’ Then I thought I could edit the story and the strange comments might stop. I pressed edit and typed out a completely different story. But the edit wouldn’t save. It kept reverting to my original story. That was new! I never had problems posting, editing or deleting before.

I reached out to the moderators. Told them I wanted to take down the story immediately. One of the moderators replied “I read your story. Now my cat has stopped eating and just stares at a wall and keeps growling. I don’t know what you did but my server crashes every time I try to take down the thread.”

Not knowing what else to do, I posted a comment “DO NOT READ. THIS STORY CHANGES FOR EACH READER LIKE IT KNOWS YOU. IF YOU READ IT, YOU ARE CURSED.”My comment got downvoted and buried within the pool of other comments. Users reposted the story, it got shared in other subreddits. The story kept growing.

One day, I tried printing the story. Just to prove I wasn’t losing my mind.

My printer spit out a single page. Not my story. Not anything I recognized. Just one sentence, over and over:

**"You wrote this for me."**

I don’t know how this started. I don’t know if something latched onto my writing or if the story was always cursed. I only know that now, whoever reads it, sees something meant for them.

And that includes you.

So if you’ve made it this far, it’s too late.

Watch your back.
