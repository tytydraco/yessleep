This happened last summer, during a family road trip through the hills.
I’ve changed our names, but I’m writing this exactly as I remember it — because something followed us back.

We visited a haunted house.
It was supposed to be a joke.

Me, my parents, my younger brother, and my elder sister — we were driving through a foggy stretch when someone at a roadside told us about an old colonial house nearby.
Abandoned. Cursed.
They said it had mirrors in every room — cracked, fogged, old things that never stopped reflecting.

Mirrors that “remember more than they reflect.”

My dad laughed. My mom rolled her eyes.
We went anyway.

We only stayed twenty minutes.
But it was long enough.

The mirrors were everywhere.

Tall ones in the halls, chipped vanity mirrors in the bedrooms, ornate ones above fireplaces — some with strange dust patterns that never wiped away. I remember one had a handprint on the inside.

My sister changed first.

She stopped sleeping in her room. Covered every mirror with a bedsheet and refused to explain why. She said there was someone in the glass — someone watching her even when she turned away.
She said our reflections were “off,” like they moved too late… or blinked too fast.

We thought she was being dramatic.
Even laughed about it.

But my mom stopped laughing when she found her crying in the bathtub with her eyes shut tight.
Dad got angry. Said she was scaring my little brother.

Then I started waking up in strange places.
Once, I found myself standing in the hallway at 3 a.m., facing the mirror. Just… staring.
I don’t remember getting up.

I told myself it was just stress.

Three nights later, I found my sister dead.

Smothered. Still. Her nails were broken — she’d fought back.

My brother was outside her door.
Silent. Frozen.
His face pale, like he’d seen death… or met it.

And the worst part?

I saw him do it.

His hands. The pillow. Her muffled cries.
I was sure it was him.

But it wasn’t. Not really.

It was his body, yes — but it wasn’t my brother.
Something else was inside him.
I could feel it.
I tried to scream, but something clamped around my throat. I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe.

And when I looked at him…
His eyes weren’t his.
He smiled. Slowly. Like he knew me.
He looked at me with blood in his eyes next turn is yours 

Then… he turned the pillow on himself.
I tried to scream I wanted to run , I want to stop him 
But I was helpless I tried to crawl to stop him but I was helpess
my 
brother pressed down pillow hard on his face
Until he stopped moving.

After that, my parents stopped speaking to each other.
I was also afraid cause I am next
My brother's voice echoed in my head even at night 
My mom barely left her room. She wouldn’t eat unless I made her. My dad stayed in the garage. I heard him crying once.
He doesn’t know I heard.

The mirrors got worse.

I saw tall, slow-moving shadows behind me.
My reflection would smile when I wasn’t.
Sometimes, I’d pass by a mirror and see myself already waiting on the other side.

And then came the dreams.
Or memories.
I’m not sure anymore.


My sister’s screams.
My hands holding the pillow.
Her eyes looking up at me.

I started waking up scratching at my wrists.
Every night.

One night, I passed the hallway mirror.
And I saw it.

The shadow.

It was standing behind me — unmoving, but drawn toward me like gravity itself was bending.
It leaned in. Not physically. Intentionally.
It looked into my eyes.

It didn’t speak.
But I heard it.

“Next turn is yours.”

But it didn’t feel like a threat.

It felt like a promise.

Its  reflection felt on mirror, but its breath felt on my neck 

Like something passed into me.
Or something returned.

And when I turned away from the mirror…
I was smiling.
