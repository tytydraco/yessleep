“I don’t understand why you just can’t explain it?” Tiffany whined from bed.

Man, this bitch.

No, that’s not fair, don’t be a dick.

Fuck. How to explain it? Was there a *sequence* of words? How exactly does one figure out the *perfect string of words* that can properly articulate why I am the way I am? I’ve never been great at explaining it, I always assumed other people wouldn’t get it, why bother having an explanation?

“I just-” I stopped, still unsure of where to go. I just sort of hoped I’d find it if I started talking, but I had no idea what else to say. “I don’t know how to-” I gestured vaguely, hoping she’d understand.

She didn’t. “I’m always upfront with you, my parents divorce, the things my dad did to me. Do you have any idea how hard it was to do that? To open up about those things?”

*Yes.* “No, I can’t imagine. And I’m grateful you did, and I wish I could return that, but I don’t-” I paused again, but this time some words appeared. Not THE words, but words nonetheless, good enough for tonight. “I don’t know how.”

Tiffany softened at that, and her hand went to her belly, rubbing the bump that was going to one day turn into an astronaut. “I wish you’d learn.” She looked right at me, and it reminded me why I loved her.

I always thought she knew what I was thinking just by looking at me. I guess somewhere along the way I had started to take that for granted, and now she’s lost track of who I am under what I show.

Fuck.

If there’s ever a morning to argue with your spouse, it’s probably not the morning of a big experiment. I didn’t want to brag earlier, when we were bickering, but my name is Dr Wayne Quade, PhD in neuroscience and masters in  psychology, but Wayne will do just fine, thank you very much. What I’m trying to say is that if anyone had reasons to be stressed or anxious, it was me. I should have the answers for how the mind works, and mines a gross mess.

Which is why I steered toward more experimental projects. It felt hypocritical, trying to help people by giving them advice I couldn’t take, ya know?

Today was a big day. In a collaboration with the Neurophysics department, we were going to try to separate parts of the human mind. The idea was, if we contain the parts of the brain that were malfunctioning, we could better understand the chemical, physical, and biological aspects of the human brain.

If that sounds like bad science fiction jargon, it’s because I’m underselling it. There’s much more to it than that, I’m just distracted. I keep thinking about Tiffany and the baby, and how she feels like I can’t open up and if the baby will inherit that or worse they’ll be so much better and resent ME for it and I wouldn’t know how to explain it to them without just saying “sorry” as if that was an explanation into my-

Oh look, we made it to the lab. Almost got lost there.

A large group of coworkers who’s name I keep forgetting are gathered around two cylindrical glass tubes, connected by wires to a gurney.

“Wayne!” Shouts Coworker #7. “We’ve been waiting for you, man! You won the draw!”

The draw? “The draw?” I asked.

“We all put our names in a bowl and picked one at random, and you won!” Coworker #9, who seemed to need a xanax or other downer immediately, exclaimed.

“Oh, so what did I win?” Maybe today wouldn’t just be stressful and bad. Maybe I won a giftcard or candy or something.

“You get to go first!” Coworker #3 said.

“Whoa, wait- is that a *good* idea? I mean, shouldn’t we have a control group, or run some samples first?”

Coworker #12, who was technically in charge of us, laughed. “That’s the old way. Science isn’t moving at a snail's pace anymore.”

“Okay, well no, that’s not- you have a PhD man you know that’s not- '' I gave up the argument. “I don’t want to.”

The room got silent. It was as if I just yelled a racial slur, instead of just declining an offer I didn’t want.

“It has to be you!” Coworker #4 injected helpfully. “We calibrated the machine for you already, and we’ve been waiting on you to start.”

“What, you trust us right?” Coworker #19 asked. To her credit, she sounded genuinely concerned.

“With this,” I gestured to the machine. “Yes, of course, but-”

“Then there’s no issue!” Coworker #12, who was *technically* in charge of us, declared. “You know how the machine works. It scans your brain, detects the malfunctioning parts, and represents them in physical form in the tube. It’ll be fun!” His eyes narrowed. “Unless you're afraid?”

~~Of course I’m afraid you fucking idiot why wouldn’t you start with someone better someone undamaged someone normal I’m terrified of what’s gonna show up in that tube what if it’s terrible what if it’s the gross mess I know I am and you all see just how it looks and what if you hate it~~

Instead, my body responded without my brain's permission. “No, I can do it, you're right, it should be fun!” Great.

I laid down on the gurney, trying not to throw up or shit myself for what was about to happen.

“Okay so,” Coworker #1, my favorite, began. “Once it scans you, it’ll make two copies-”

“Wait, why two?” I asked, as if I didn’t help design the scanner.

“It makes one copy that’s a representation of the illness in the right container, and a copy that represents your normal ego in the other. That way we can compare for differences.”

“What happens when we turn it off? Wait, are they alive? Would we be killing them?”

Coworker #1 leaned in. “Do you care?”

I was only a little surprised to find that I did not.

Minutes that felt like eons past while they readied the machine and put my helmet on. Then suddenly the moment came. It didn’t hurt, not exactly, but it was uncomfortable. It felt like a million little straws were sucking out my brain.

Then there was black.

Evidently, I passed out, because the room looked relieved when I looked around. “What happened? How long was I out?”

“Only a few minutes,” one of the coworkers chimed in. “but, Wayne, look-”

I followed his pointer finger to the right tube, the one that manifests the present mental illness.

So, even in my nightmares, I had assumed the bad manifestation of me would be, well, *bad.* I did not, however, assume it would have rings of teeth around a cylindrical mouth. The thing in the tube more resembled a lamprey and a tick, skittering its eight legs around the walls slamming its mouth into the glass, looking for something to eat.

“What the- what the fuck?!” I yelled, panic rising.

The thing in the tube looked right at me, as if identifying a part of itself. I shuddered, thinking I had any relation to this creature. Then it hit me. Not physically, it was still stuck in the tube (*for now*) but a wave of thoughts and feelings.

*Stay here, it’s safe.*

*Just give in, you’ll feel better when you do.*

*Wouldn’t it feel good to just slip away? Wouldn’t that feel like a relief?*

*They already forgot about you.*

*They aren’t coming.*

*Nobody is coming.*

I broke eye contact, and my brain cleared up. Fuck, that’s part of *me*?

Still sitting on the ground, I shuffled backwards pathetically, trying to put any distance between that thing and myself as I could. As I did, I heard a familiar laugh.

Mine.

I looked in the tube on the left, the part where the rest of your healthy brain manifests.

There did not stand some horrible creature. A thinner, more toned version of me stood, laughing. “Man, you should see your face right now.”

“Wha-” I stopped. “Why, why is it like that?”

“You’re asking *me*?” He-I, I guess, asked. “I guess that’s fair. I am you, after all. Part of you.”

He gestured to the creature, who snarled right back at him in turn. “He’s like that because you feed him better.”

“Feed him? What’re you-” I got cut off by the sound of cracking glass.

The creature's teeth had started to damage the container. And it knew it, smashing away harder than before. Most of the numbered Coworkers ran off, yelling for security or the army or a bomb. Which might be fair because that creature REALLY started to freak me out. I don’t know why I didn’t run with them.

“First of all, my name is Wayne Quade, but you can call me Dr. Quade.” the man in the left tank said smugly.

“You’re me, idiot. We both earned a doctorate.”

“True, but you only got there because you fed me. Do you get it?”

And all of a sudden, I did.

The creature erupted from the container in a shower of glass, spraying the Coworkers brave enough to stay. At this display, the few became none, and they turned tail immediately.

Instead of chasing them, the creature generously turned its attention to me.

*They moved on from you and it took next to nothing for them to do so.*

*You can feel it leaving you, right? You will? Just let it go.*

*It’s quiet.*

*It’s peace.*

*It’s the best deal most of us will ever get.*

“Let me out!” the other- Dr. Quade (fine, whatever) yelled. “ I can fight him!”

“Fight him? Are you stupid?” I shot back, but found myself racing towards the container. A maintenance wrench sat nearby, so I grabbed it on the way.

Did that seem too easy? It’s because it would have been. The creature lunged, scrapping my arm. Nothing deep, but lots of little cuts.

Surprising myself, I swung back, knocking the thing in the side of the head. It lurched back, a glint of fear in its eyes.

I got myself up, rushed to the glass, and smashed it with the wrench.

“Hey, little warning?” Dr.Quade yelled, jumping out.

“Shut up! God, you *cannot* be the nice part of my brain!

He grinned. “Good. not nice. Big distinction.” At that, the Good-but-not-nice Dr.Quade gently took the wrench from my hand. “Most people aren’t nice after fighting that thing for years.”

“I don’t see how we can fight it, we should run or wait for help.” I insisted.

He laughed. Man, this guy pissed me off. Which is weird, because he’s me. Kind of. “You’ve been fighting this guy for decades, Wayne.” He turned and looked at me. “And so have I.”

With that, like a coked out maniac, the Good-but-not-nice part of my brain charged at a demonic looking creature, which roared back in return.

*Is this what’s going on in my head?* I wondered, seeing it on display for the first time plainly. *Man, Tiff needs to move away and change her identity or something.*

Dr.Quade moved like a superhero, dodging rows of teeth and sharp but small legs. The creature, frustrated with this, tried a new tactic, and rushed towards me.

I didn’t do great, I fell over like an idiot in a horror movie. The thing was on me in an instant.

The creature, *my* creature, stood over me, rows of teeth inches from my face. It let out a growl, and the wave of thoughts came again.

*Just to slip away, to feel that relief.*

*Don’t you want that?*

*More than anything, right?*

I snapped out of it, and heard the creature roar again. Dr. Quade stood over it with a wrench, snarling. “Fuck you!” He yelled, wailing at it with the wrench.

The creature lurched at him, and this time, it didn’t miss. The mouth pressed into Dr.Quade’s chest, ripping him open. Any doubt I had that these manifestations weren’t real evaporated when I saw human organs rush out through the hole.

He gurgled, trying to speak, and tossed me the wrench.

*Me? Out of everyone in the room?*

*Oh.*

*Right.*

Seeing red, I charged at the creature, and to my surprise, it backed down.

I didn’t. I ran, smacking every inch of it I could. It launched at me, but kept missing, leaving me with little cuts but nothing major. Finally, with the most satisfying **smack** yet, the creature's eye pulled back, and it crumpled to the floor, twitching.

Security finally arrived, and I got to answer a million questions. After what felt like days, they let me go. I snuck to the autopsy room, the temporary resting place for my good-but-not-nice clone. God, he did look just like me, only younger, better, healthier. What had he said, I fed him to get my PhD? The same way I fed the creature?

It was too much to try to unpack just standing there, so I started my walk home. To Tiff.

On the way home I started to realize it wouldn’t have mattered if we used a mentally undamaged person to start. We’re all fucked, in our way. I’ve never met an undamaged person, and I think, neither have you.

There’s no blueprint or standard to feel an obligation to. We are who we are.

If you told me Tiffany didn’t move all day, I would have believed you. She was in the same spot on the bed, same pajamas, hand in the same position on her belly.

“I felt sick all day, so I called in and laid around. How was work?”

I sat down on the other side of the bed. “You want to know what it’s like?”

She sat up. “What, work? Or-” a silence fell over us, and I knew it was on me to break it. This was my show, after all.

“It’s like living with a tapeworm,” I began.

“Gee thanks.” she said, giggling.

“Hey, I’m being serious!” I shot back, but soon we were both laughing.

“Okay, okay, so- it’s like I have a parasite, a tapeworm, in my head. It’s draining, and exhausting, and the best way to placate it is to feed it.”

“Feed it?” Tiffany asked.

I nodded. “Shame, guilt, excuses to ditch friends or be less than what I could be. I’ve been giving it that, for **years**, because it was easier than fighting. I think that’s what we all do, we all feed that part of ourselves because it’s easier.”

Tiffany sneezed, then looked at me apologetically.

“Bless you.”

“I don’t know what you mean, Wayne, what’re you saying?”

I sighed. I knew this would be a hard conversation for me to get through, but hell, these were *the words, the sequence that can convey.* No turning back now. “I’m saying I have to stop feeding it. The more you feed it the bigger it gets, and once it gets big enough it gets sick of the scraps you give it. That’s when it decides to try to eat **you** instead.”

Tiffany nodded, so I went on.

“I don’t love it- I fucking hate it- but it’s part of me. As much as the good parts. Even if it does come after you, and you manage to kill it, it comes back. It gets better over time, and sometimes you don’t even notice you’re feeding it until you’re the one starving.”

I sighed. “And Tiff, I feel like that *all the time.* I don’t want it, and I wouldn’t if I could, but I can’t.”

I looked her in the eyes, and went for it. “Do you understand?”

She stared at me, then nodded. “But…if it’s like you say, how it’ll just come back to fight again and again, then…”

I smiled, figuring where this was going. “Ask it.”

“Then why keep fighting it?” She forced out, sounding more like a bad cough than a question.

This one, I didn’t have the words for. I put my hand on hers, putting pressure on our little MMA fighter or president or ballerina or whatever they wanted.

“Oh.” She said, smiling.

*The sequence* worked. The right string of words, hard as hell to conjure but sure to do the trick, gave me this moment.

She understood. It was okay.

I don’t know how long we sat like that, but the sun set before dinner, and ended up ordering in and watching a movie.

It was nice.

I'm posting this because the experiment, was obviously, a failure, both on and off paper. It was a batshit idea, and the department is up our asses about it.

But that doesn't mean I didn't learn anything.
