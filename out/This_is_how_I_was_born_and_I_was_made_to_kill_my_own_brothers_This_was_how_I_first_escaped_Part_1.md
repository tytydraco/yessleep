*Darkness*.

I guess that's the first thing I can really remember. Now, before you say anything, yeah, I know full well how that sounds. Hear me out. No, that wasn't some metaphorical statement or anything, that was a real thing. I can remember seeing just this... this black cloud. Just absolute nothingness.

I have no idea how long it stayed this way. From what I understand, it had been there ever since I had been, what or where the hell "here" even fucking was. I could see my hands, pale and without any kind of color or pigmentation. The rest of my body was much the same. Two stubby, chubby little arms and legs, attatched to my chubby little body.

The weirdest part of this, I guess, was that I was aware of myself. I was aware of the fact that I was surrounded by nothing, despite knowing absolutely nothing. I'd ask if that made any sense, but let's face it, it barely even made any sense to myself while I wrote it. I suppose the first thing I can remember *hearing* \-- something that truly caught me off guard -- was screaming. Who it was, where they were, why they were screaming at me, or what they were even saying, I couldn't tell. Looking back, something I really hate doing, I don't think any of them were actually saying anything, just... screaming...

The second thing I would ever hear, though, was the voice of someone I, for the longest time, thought was God himself. It was deep and echo-ey, commanding and powerful, cold and emotionless.

**"He will do nicely!"**

Who they were talking to, or what they talked about-- again, I had no clue. I remember the screaming intensifying. my heart hammered in my ears, I remember-- the third thing I remember experiencing. My body vibrated and a pressure began building up inside of me. The screams started to fill me up, stuffing me to the gills like they were my organs. For as much as I knew, they were.

The only indication I had that I wasn't deluded was that the next thing I experienced was a wave of heat, blasting across the front of my body. This, I believe, is what terrified me the most when it happened. The feeling of having your flesh essentially broil like that. The fact that you don't even know what it is. Baking in an oven, but not even knowing what an "oven" is, not knowing what warmth is even.

It's after this that I first saw light. Bright, pure, and unfiltered. Blinding and enraged. It glared at me, looking down on me, and I was sure this was where the new sensation of "heat" came from. There was no other explanation for it, not for me, anyway. I watched it grow, assimilating the darkness, eclipsing the darkness, replacing it in angered light.

Eventually, the light pervaded and I couldn't see anything, my eyes having been seared by the light. The heat flared and my flesh scorched further. Imagine yourself being blowtorched at point blank range. Imagine the sheer intensity of the heat as it peels and sears your flesh and muscles straight from your bones. And now imagine that, not only is this blowtorch turned to its lowest setting, or at least only hot enough for you to feel the scorch, but not enough to actually fry you to a crisp, but you don't even understand what's happening to you, either. That's what all of this was for me.

The light encompassed me and, for the first time, I remember actually trying to move my limbs. I had no strength, no supple muscles with which to actually perform any such actions as moving away from the light before it would engulf me. I guess, in this way, I'd say my first real thought, my first emotion, was fear. Crippling and unfiltered.

*Fear.*

However later it was, my eyes adjusted and I could remember seeing all different manner of things. Defined shapes and colors, colors other than pervading darkness. None of it made any sense to me, but at the same time, was intriguing. New input, utterly foreign to anything that I would've been privy to before now. I watched as figures scrambled around. Each of them looked similar in shape to me, only they were bigger, and were far more mobile.

Many of them were scattering about the area, while two others stood by, reaching out to take me into this new world. Their hands, massive and consuming to my small body at the time, were cold, frigid even, unlike the scalding sensation I felt before. In shock, I wasn't sure which of the two was worse. In the end, it wouldn't matter. The one holding me spoke, "A boy, just as requested, sir."

The one whom he said this two exchanged back and forth glances between me and him before bellowing in his Godlike voice, "We'll see. Put him with the rest. We shall begin first thing tomorrow morning." I was then carried from where I came in from to this box, where I was then sat inside and sealed off after having a network of tubes inserted in almost every square inch of my body. Something else of note is that, thanks to my skin being not at all developed yet, the tubes were needles, jagged needles, when pushed in. It was awful, and I'd like to think I wailed, begging in my own, incoherent way, for them to take the damn tubes out and put me back wherever they found me.

Whether or not I did, though, it did nothing to help. So I sat there, aching all over, and all the while, the screaming deep within me never ceased. Over time, I began to hear something other than just screams. I began to hear annunciations. Syllables. I began to hear cries for help. My body ached with each palpitation of my tiny heart. The screams built once again and my head was close to exploding.

My eyes slowly adjusted to the room I was in, inside the tiny, cramped glass box, where I saw at least hundreds of others looking just like me. All of them had tubes pin cushioning them and pale skin with stubby appendages. They each had their mouths open, therefore I initially thought *they* were responsible for the screaming. They could've been for all I knew at that moment.

It carried on like this for what must've been weeks, months, years, who knew? Time, like the heat, the cold, and like every other sensation I felt for the first time leading up to then, was just a foreign concept. Even had I possessed any concept of time, though, with the constant screaming being the only thing to occupy my mind, there was still absolutely no telling how long I sat in that box for.

Eventually, though, I was taken out of it and carried into another room, one with yet another blinding light like the one from before. This one, in fact, had to have been even more terrifying. Whereas the one from before blinded me after prolonged eye contact with it, *this* one did it after literally only a second of looking into it. The one from before, I named as the enraged eye of God, so this one, in my eyes, must've been the wrathful gaze of the devil.

I felt no warmth from it. No scalding wave of heat like before, in fact, it was the complete opposite. I could feel something cold stinging my back, frigid and hard, unforgiving. Uncaring, just like the ones that put me there in the first place. The only relief I got with this was when the large figures from before stood, leering above me, which managed to blot out at least a little of the light's glare.

There were four of them, and each of them held strange tools and instruments in their hands, many of which were sharp and/or pointed. I can distinctly remember the instincts kicking in to struggle, to fight to escape. I didn't know who these beings were, what the instruments were or what they were intending exactly  to do with them, but somehow... Somehow I just *knew* it would be harmful.

A dormant instinct, "survivalist instinct", as I would learn much later on in the worst ways possible. Regardless, it made absolutely no difference. I couldn't escape by any means of my own, and by that point, it was already clear to me that my captors had no regard for my well being. And they would prove this to me by repeatedly and very much callously implementing these instruments on me. Every square inch of my body, no matter how sensitive or tender, which in my case would've been, more or less, my entire body, they seemingly gleefully poked and prodded.

Oh, if you could only imagine the pain that came with this. The feeling of your flesh being peeled away from your bones, of your bones being pulled as if by strings like you were a puppet, and all, only to be put back the way it was so it could be done again to a different area. I couldn't outright see their faces while they did this, but somehow, perhaps as another instance of this "instinct" I've been mentioning, I just *knew* they had smiles on their faces while they watched me suffer.

As horrible as this was, though, I was at least grateful that this didn't feel like it lasted an eternity. Once they'd satisfied themselves with whatever it was they were trying to do with me-- whether or not their goal was to see how much pain I could endure or if there was another purpose entirely, I still don't really know-- They took me back into the glass box. Another eternity passed before I was taken out again. By that time, I had seemingly developed a sense of trying to stay quiet.

I guess a part of me thought that wailing the way I was must have angered the beings, thus punishing me with their little torture session. In another sense, I must've just realized that, regardless of angering the beings, crying was serving me no good anyway, so why waste the energy? So I was quiet, and when I was brought into the new room, this one dark like the place I'd come from in the beginning of all of this, I can actually remember hearing the Godlike voice boom, "This one's gotten quiet."

"It must be his connection." I heard another say. This one spoke with a much softer, much smoother voice. "It would make sense, would it not? His readings show his connection with the other side being far elevated than most of the others, sir." The Godlike being made a noise that I would later come to know as a "chuckle".

"Yes, and for that, I'm quite excited for him." I was laid down, this time on a soft, cushion like surface. This would be the first of only a few times I would ever experience the feeling of comfort. I couldn't describe at the time what it felt like, but looking back, I guess you could say it's what you'd imagine laying down on a large, fluffy cloud would feel like. The only thing that diminished this was that the screaming hadn't ended. By then, though, I'd developed something of an immunity to them.

Then, from everywhere around me, the God being spoke, **"Welcome, little one, to the world."**

The echo of his voice reverberated throughout my body. At this, my boasted reserve I mentioned before was broken and I began to wail uncontrollably. Neither of the beings did anything while I all but tore my fragile little lungs apart. The softer voice spoke again, **"You show a lot of promise. We expect great things from you."**

It's worth mentioning that, though I can still remember what they said, the annunciation and forming of words in complete sentences, I had no idea of the words' actual meaning, making them, therefore, just more sounds, meaningless and void-- as if I didn't have far more than enough of that already. My cries escalated, and with them, so did the screams of agony inside my head.

My head pounded, pulsing and pulsing, full to bursting until, suddenly, I let loose a thunderous sort of cry that comprised the screams of not only myself, but each and every one of the thousands of voices in my head as well. The room began to rattle, I remember. The tremors shook the room to a point where the table was only seconds away from toppling over, spilling me onto the ground. This lasted only a moment before being silenced with a far more startling sound than even the God's voice, one that was far higher and artificial in pitch.

**"Yes, he's the one, I just know it."** the God voice boomed again. I laid in silence after that for some time. The voices hadn't thought to actually try accosting me afterward, as if they knew somehow that if they did, the startling noise would return. Lights, blinding and white, blinked to life from all around me and I found myself surrounded by what appeared to be large, grey walls, smooth and sleek.

It was spacious, this room, spanning at least a good 10 to 20 or more feet across and another 30 or so feet wide. Beside me was the table I'd initially been laid on, now turned over on it's side. Now, why exactly it was that I did what I did next, I'm still not entirely sure, but I distinctly remember reaching out toward the table. What it was I wanted, I didn't know, but regardless, I watched the table begin shaking before I heard the screech of it skidding across the floor ever so slightly.

The table shook some more then before raising into the air almost three or four inches off the floor. I cooed while this happened, like I was watching a fireworks show-- even if it was much, MUCH later in life that I even found out what a fucking firework was. I was amazed, yes, but more than this, it was humorous to me. The God being shared this as, from over the intercom, I could hear his commanding voice echo, telling me: **"That's very good. Now, let your tulpa take form."**

The words had no meaning to me, but still echoed throughout my body while I continued telepathically lifting the table. **"Do you hear me?"** asked the God being in a tone that I somehow knew to be one of agitation, **"Let the tulpa take form."**

**"Perhaps more time is needed for his capabilities to better develop."** spoke the softer voice.

**"How much time?"**

**"We cannot be certain, but remain patient."** I heard the God being make a noise, something I'd later come to know as a sigh of disappointment.

**"I've been "patient" for almost a century, Shiva."**

**"And it hasn't been in vain, this you've seen already, but time is still needed if any of them are to fulfill their destiny in this life, yes?"** The God being repeated his aforementioned groan.

**"Very well. I shall be..."** he paused for a moment before finishing with **"'Patient'."**

**"Worry not, Abba. The time is coming."** The soft voice then spoke to me, **"Are you having fun, little one?"** I simply cooed at them, having not the capability of speech. They chuckled back in reply. **"That's good, you just keep playing for a while, let your capabilities develop."**

And that's just what I did: play. I played around, moving around and levitating the table. Well, I thought I was the one doing it, anyway. At some point, though, I watched as another figure started to appear in the room with me. It, more or less, was my shadow, and I watched as it started lifting the large, heavy table. It only used one hand to do it, too.

Even so young, so unaware of anything, I can still remember the distinct fascination I felt when I first saw this. The fascination of seeing another being, one so small like me. Of course, as I've stated, while he was small, he was far from being weak like I was. He was far more animated, too, being able to walk around the room on his own legs while I remained confined to my stomach on the floor.

**"Look, he's doing it!"** cheered the soft voice, **"You see that?"**

**"Yes, Yes I do. It's strong, already more so than we expected!"**

**"I told you, didn't I? All that was required was a little time and care toward them. They can't always be quick learners, you know?"** The God being chuckled.

**"I suppose you're right. Wait,"** A small pause choked the room before they came back, demanding, **"What happened? It's not there, where did it--"**

**"There, you see?"** interjected the soft voice. **"It's over there now, by the corner, next to him with the table still in its hand."**

**"But how could it have gotten all the way over** ***there?*** **I hadn't even seen it move!"**

**"Neither had I."**

**"I knew tulpas, certain ones anyway, were capable of moving at faster than light speeds, but..."**

**"I have to agree, Abba. And especially with him being so underdeveloped, even among the others, I find it hard to believe myself that it could've gotten that powerful this quickly. It concerns me because of this, though."**

**"And why is that?"**

**"Because if tulpas can develop in power and manipulation in so short a span, could it not also stand to reason that it would find a way to detach itself from its host's body and run amuck on its own?"**

Another moment of silence passes throughout before The God being returned with: **"Yes, I can see your point. You are correct, the tulpa can detach from its host if not on his guard. That's why I wanted to start as early as possible for them to train themselves to summon and bind it to themselves while maintaining complete control over it."**

The voices vanished once more and with it, the rest of the only sound that had been present in that room. I watched my shadow walk around the room, slowly making laps around the room while still proudly holding the table high. Then, the door over at the far side of the room was shoved open and the shadow disappeared. In stepped two of the beings again, scooping me off of the floor gingerly. This, and the subsequently frightening *crash* of the chair falling back on its side on the floor, caused me to break out into a fresh set of wails.

A small part of me wondered why there wasn't another phenomenon then as there had been moments before, but there weren't and I was gently taken out of the room and placed back, where? You guessed it, back in the glass box. The screams returned but this time I didn't cry. For one thing, by this time, even as loud as they were, they weren't all that startling for me. Not anymore.

No, instead, my mind occupied itself with thoughts of who or what the shadow was, and/or how it had appeared in the room. More than this, though, how and why was it moving the table around the way it was? I wondered for hours what exactly it was planning to do with the table.

Was it planning on carrying it around with him everywhere? Was he maybe planning to perhaps hand it to me because I was reaching for it? It all sounded strange, sure, but then again, how exactly would one rationally explain anything I'd just witnessed?

Another thought had occurred to me, though: what if it wanted to hit me with it?

After another eternity passing in the glass box, I saw the shadow again. This time, they stood just a few feet from me to my right. This was the first time I got to see them in any sort of detail-- that is to say, what little there was. As I've said before, this being was more or less my shadow, therefore was small and fragile like me, but that's where our physical similarities ended. It had no face at all, save for its two small milk-white slits embedded rather close together at either side of its face.

I watched them pass a gaze around, scanning the room. Their eyes finally landed on me again and I reached out for them, softly cooing in wonder. They slowly came for me in the box. As they came closer, It raised one of its "hands"-- which were, seeing them a bit closer, more of stubs or small tentacles than hands-- out towards me.

When they reached the box, their tentacle pressed against the glass. I pushed my own hand against the glass from my side, trying to mirror their hand. We locked eyes and for a solid five minutes, the two of us seemed to look not AT each other, but *inside* each other. Dull or cheesy as that may sound, understand that I mean that not in a sappy or romantic way, but almost in a physical one. I was not only looking into a mirror, but bonding with it as well.

The two of us were one, the shadow and me. Two halves of one soul. They couldn't exist without me, and I would've been entirely empty without them.

With their free arm, they touched their chest and then pointed at me. They then passed their arm around, guiding my eyes around the room. At times, I saw them stop to point out specific spots in the upper corners of the room. I followed his lead, twirling my head around wherever their tentacle was pointing. Unfortunately, though, whatever message they were trying to push across to me was all but lost to my then infantile mind.

I simply thought they were trying to dance in a funny way, so I giggled. This attracted the attention of the two God beings, who I heard stomping across the floor into the room. Just like before in the room, their arrival meant the shadow disappeared again. I remember how devastated this made me feel for some reason. Perhaps it was the bond we'd felt, or at least, *I'd* felt, or because of something else, but watching the shadow of me vanish a second time sent me into an inconsolable frenzy.

The glass box shook again and spiderwebs formed across each of its faces. My wails escalted rapidly in pitch, once again causing the entire room to quiver in fright. "What's going on?!" the soft voice cried.

"He's spiking again!" shouted the other, the deeper one. Before I knew it, rough, calloused hands had me, hoisting me out of the box and rushing out of the room. I heard the box itself fall to the ground and shatter. None of this, however, was really noticed by me as I continued my tantrum. Eventually, it ended as it had before, only instead of a startling sound to snap me back to reality, it was merely my own exhaustion.

I woke this time to the steady rhythm of beeping from a monitor I was hooked into by nodes from my arms, chest, and head. The room I was in now was a sort of bright teal color, with smiling faces all around, all of them teasing me silently. I tried tugging on the nodes, more out of curiosity than anything else, only to be given a frightening shock whenever I tugged too hard. The sting was sharp and painful, as if I'd been pricked by ten or more needles at once. I started to cry again because of this, but found that something had been changed. Instead of quaking violently as it'd done before, the room I was in remained completely still.

My cries weren't as distorted, either. No, I was now delegated one voice, one singular wail, and it couldn't have frightened a small insect or a bird, let alone shake the entire room again. I tried flailing my limbs, thinking for some reason that would make something happen, but I was so wrong. Nothing changed. I wasn't even visited by the God beings this time. Why would they have came? What threat was I now?

At some point, my throat went hoarse and so I was forced to admit defeat and cease wailing. Then I just sat there again, prodding lightly at the nodes while thinking again about the shadow, my one and only supposed "friend" up to that point. I wanted so bad for him to come back, but I knew not at all how to even make that happen. It crossed my mind that, back in the other rooms I'd been in, all I'd done was think of him or attempt to take something I clearly couldn't take by myself, like the table, and he would appear.

Well, if this *were* the case in those two instances, then I was fooled because no matter how feverishly I tried conjuring him up with my mind, no matter how vividly I imagined him again, he wouldn't appear. This resulted in me crying again. When I did, I began to hear crying from everywhere in the room around me. This time, and it didn't take me very long to realize this, I realized these were different from the ones I'd heard before in my head.

These weren't in my head, but instead, they were outside, all around me, and I could see them. There were a bunch of others around me now, all small and feeble like me, and all with nodes sticking out of them like they were pincushions. Who or what they were, to me, was just as much a mystery as who the shadow was.

Into the room came two more of the God beings, both of them being large and broad shouldered like the chief one, "Abba". They spoke though with a sort of higher pitched voice.

"For fuck's sake, can't the big guy ever shut any of these little shits up?" said one.

"Beats the hell out of me. Be a lot nicer though, less to have to clean up." This one added a nasty sounding chuckle to the end of this. I watched them weave through the different sections, glaring down at the wailing creatures within. A few of them, I watched them slap them around a bit, laughing and shouting things like "Hello, there a brain in there?" or "Where's the off switch on this goddamn thing!"

Needless to say, this resulted in one thing and one thing only: more wailing, which made them shout even louder in anger. It got to a point where one of them decided to take it upon himself to actually seize one of the children, ripping out the nodes in a manner that I knew must've been painful to the child, with the way in which his screams instantly became deafening.

He held him in the air and began shaking him violently, screaming "SHUT THE FUCK UP! DO YOU HEAR ME, SHUT UP!" The child's screaming built in higher and higher in pitch, sounding very much similar to the way mine were, sounding like many voices combined into one. The being continued rag dolling the child until I saw his body suddenly freeze solid. His face dropped from the aggressive scowl he'd wore to a more blank, empty expression. His eyes were stitched wide, with his jaw hanging slack.

For about two seconds, his body was completely still, save only for a light trembling that started from his feet and worked its way up from there. Then his entire body shook, similar to the way the child himself was being shaken. The bizarre part came when he was lifted several inches off the floor by seemingly nothing. The child was dropped from his hands, conveniently right back onto the bed he'd been strapped into.

The child had stopped crying by the time this began and was now reaching out to the air in the same direction as the being who was still hoisted in the air. He began choking, gasping and wheezing, clawing for air as if he were clawing for food. All of the other children had ceased crying by this point and turned their heads to watch the spectacle unfold. This too prompted the accomplice to turn his head to see in absolute shock what was happening. The being now had gushing rivers of bright crimson running from his nose, as well as his eyes and mouth. Eventually, I began to see the bones in the being's neck get twisted and mangled to a point where they protruded from the skin at the points where the bones broke.

This wasn't all, though. Shortly after having his neck mangled, the being's eyes and mouth opened even wider as his temples I saw began pressing inward on one another. Before either I, the other children, or the other being could do so much as even blink, the eyes of the being were ejected from his skull as his head was flattened. His body dropped to the ground then and the other one ran, staggering in haste past all the different beds, shouting "Oh God! Oh, fucking sweet Jesus God!"

When he reached the other end of the room, I saw him smash a giant red button and shout, "Code black! I repeat, this is code black here in the nursery! We have a man down, I repeat, man down!"

To his credit, it was only seconds after shouting this at the top of his lungs that the door burst open again. In then stepped the God being himself, alongside his softer toned assistant. "What's going on in here?" he demanded.

The other shook when he spoke, pointing in the direction of us children and exclaiming "Th-they Ki-Ki-Killed him!" The two God beings exchanged a brief back and forth between one another.

"'Killed him?'"

"Yeah, g-got him right over there!" He began waving around his arms in a frenzy. The two turned to look. Walking up to his body, they found indeed the body of their fallen cohort, swimming in the middle of an ever growing puddle of his blood. I heard the God being snicker.

"Really?" he asked. The other just nodded in panic. "Hm, why don't you show me then?"

The other beings' eyes doubled in size and I heard him ask "Wha-What do you mean?"

"Exactly what I said, show me how one of these tiny, defenseless children, who barely possess muscles, far less any fighting skills, managed to turn your associate here into 'Flat Stanley'."

"B-But--" He was cut off then by the sound of something metallic clicking. The scared being looked back at his friend, and then at me with a look of unfiltered, crippling terror before pointing straight to the door at the other end of the room.

"Remember your deal, Harrison." the God being boomed. The other being took a further two steps backward the God being stayed put. The clicking sound resonated again and I heard, "Now, as I said, go over there and *show* me just how exactly one of our engineers got himself twisted in half by one of the children as you so claim."

Had I known what urine was, I'd have almost definitely smelled it coming from the other being. His legs quivered the same as the bodies of myself and the other children. Another click from the God being made the him move toward the child who'd murdered his companion. I watched their head turn and the God being asked "I'm presuming that's the one?"

"I-It is, sir."

"I see. Proceed then, show me how he was provoked into violence." The other looked back down, still shaking. The child looked back up at him, his eyes wide like mine were. I admit, to this day, I've wondered just what went through his mind, or the minds of any of the others for that matter. For the longest time, of course, I figured they were all in the same sort of turmoil I was.

The giant picked up the child then and began lightly shaking him, mimicking his brother's molestations upon him. "Just like that?" asked the God being.

"Y-Yes sir."

"Just like that? You're telling me that this child, just from lightly shaking the child, provoked him to violence like that?"

"U-Um, Yeah... I mean..." His head dropped to the floor, adding "I mean, yeah, he might've been a little rougher with him, but you get the poi--" Another loud clicking noise cut him off.

"You know, I thought I was clear with my instructions, Harrison. I told you to show me *exactly* what caused the child to act violently, yes?" The other said nothing, just standing there, holding the cooing child still. I don't think either the God being or the one holding him noticed this, but I could see the child directing his attention to the floor behind the other being and pointing, making curious noises while doing so. I remember looking in the same direction, but seeing nothing.

"P-Please sir... I-I'm scared!"

"My patience is wearing *dangerously* thin with you, Harrison." The other being then frantically shook the child, screaming at him to "SHUT UP! SHUT THE FUCK UP!" He did this for a solid minute, but nothing was happening. Unlike with his brother, the child for some reason wasn't crying. I wonder if it wasn't because of some sense of the fact that he wasn't in any real danger. Perhaps he knew somehow that this was just for show, unlike the last time. Perhaps, too, the child could sense the fear in him as I could. In any case, though, outside of his shouting, the room was quiet.

"Christ, do you *not* know how to follow directions? What are you not getting about "exa--"

"I am, sir, I promise!"

"And yet, here you are, perfectly fine. Either you're not doing *something* right with it or your alibi is a fat load of horseshit."

"S-Sir, I swear to you, this is exactly what he did to the kid, and he just went ballistic, twisting him in half and--"

"And that's enough, Harrison." shouted the God being. " Clearly, you can't demonstrate the simplest task, either to guard the children *or* even prove their gifts in action, so I am relieving you of duty." The other being fell on his knees, still holding up the child in his hands.

"Please, sir, I'm begging you! Don't so this, I promise you, I'm telling the truth, this kid went and--"

**BANG**

Immediately, I saw the other being's head explode, splitting almost clean in half. This, coupled with the loud noise finally managed to spur the child, along with the rest of us, into crying once more. He fell onto the floor from the other being's limp, lifeless hands and onto his back, where he rolled around, tearing his lungs to shreds with his shrieks. I could hear another clicking noise like the ones from earlier before I watched the room start to shake again.

The being’s body was then slowly lifted off the ground and tossed aside, being sent flying almost four feet in the air to the farthest corner of the room. Other objects, like the other children’s beds, were then lifted into the air as well, where they were then tossed around, causing the children in them to spill onto the ground and begin crying themselves.

The shaking of the room was unbearable. I watched the God being himself struggle to keep his balance. At one point, I remember seeing several figures emerge from the darkness. All of them were shadows, just like the one I’d seen in the other room before. They were all looking dead at me, their ivory slits boring straight through me, straight into my very core.

I can still recall the distinct terror that pricked its way down my tiny back when I saw this, although, as my nodes weren’t disconnected as the others were, I couldn’t have done anything about it. I may not have understood exactly what it was that was going on, but I’d understood already that the nodes were a handicap more than anything.

This, the legion of terrifying shadows, was finally ended with the high pitched noise again. Then the room was silent again. The God being and his two other followers accompanying him wobbled, still reeling from the nausea of the room quaking beneath them. The children all looked at him, curious and terrified of what he may do now.

Would he hurt them? Would he maybe try to make them hurt *him*? Maybe he’d do nothing, but then the question became, if nothing now, what would come later?

He walked up and stooped down to face the child who’d started the pandemonium. “Quite a troublesome little one, you are, aren’t you?” I saw him then turn to face means tell me, “You better watch out, kiddo.” His head did a back and forth pass between me and the child.“They might give you a run for your money.” He ended this with a booming, maniacal sort of chuckle as he stood up. The others then all looked at me, eyes bugged in wonder, cooing, trying desperately to speak.

He then picked up the child and left the room along with the two or three others accompanying him. I was left alone then with the other children. They continued staring at me. At least. I thought they were, until I realized from the way their hands were all reaching out that they *weren't* looking at me at all, but instead *behind* me.

I can remember looking behind me to see just what it could've been they were looking at, where I found another shadow being. It wasn't mine, though, this one appeared a bit different from the one I'd seen. This one stood about a good two to two and a half feet taller and had a lumpier shaped head. His eyes, too, were far larger and rounded compared to mine, which were slitted. This one stared right back at me, like it was there specifically *for* me. But...

But why?

It stared at me for about three minutes or so before disappearing. It made no motions to either move toward or away from me. In fact, the only movement it *did* make was to tilt its head to the side and point at me before passing its arm around the ceiling, the same way mine had earlier. I  looked up and I actually tried examining the ceiling, searching for whatever it could possibly be he was wanting me to find. I stared for what could've been hours-- though was obviously only minutes-- scanning every square inch of the ceiling, but couldn't find anything of any real significance.

When I looked back down, it was gone. I didn't cry this time, though, I didn't have the time to before footsteps were heard stomping into the room again. I looked to see several more giants stomp in and begin collecting myself and the other children by way of these long beds on wheels. As we were being moved, I noticed the care they took to make sure the nodes remained fixed into our bodies. It was now when I slowly started realizing the connection between these nodes and the strange things that'd occurred.

It was after the one had removed the nodes, when he lifted him into the air, that he was attacked by the unseen force. The same when the other one was killed by the God being, as the nodes were still detached. Once we were loaded onto the beds, the giants rolled us out of the room and down again through a dim lit passage into a networking labyrinth of tunnels, each with varying degrees of illumination; some being so dark it was almost impossible for me to see my own two stubby arms in front of me, while others were so bright that I almost went blind the instant we entered.

This, I'm almost certain, lasted for an eternity. I'll say, though, that "eternity" was still much a strange concept for me back then. For me, eternity was simply an extreme amount of time, time spent with little to no change at all. I understand now that I merely confused this notion with that of "Limbo". That was existence for me, though; constant control and unchanging oddities that I, nor anybody else on this planet, I believe, understand, and a small part of me knew and understood this even back then-- even if I couldn't quite comprehend it.

When we finally exited the tunnels, I know not at all how much later, we had entered into a cavernous dome-like room with this gigantic circular sort of pit at the center of it. Marking the center of this pit was a big red circle with a pointed star drawn inside of it. The room was lit only by the few torches placed along the wall around the pit's perimeter. From all around us again, the God being's voice boomed:

**"Hello there, little ones. Welcome to your home. Here is where you will eat, sleep, and grow. When the day comes, you will compete against one another until only one of you remains. The one that remains will then be met with their destiny, their glorious purpose in this life. I imagine none of you will comprehend this, so don't focus too much on that. For now, my beautiful little voidlings, live and grow."**

The more I hear those words repeat as I write, the more I can't help but notice the charming tone of voice he had while speaking. He spoke to us the way I found out long after was the normal way a parent speaks to a child, unlike we "voidlings" as he named us. The room fell silent afterward, where the giants then took to splitting each of us up into different corridors that laid just outside of the pit, just out of reach of the light. There, we passed through yet another corridor before entering a rather cramped sort of apartment, even for just my small body.

In here was a bed, a single electric lamp perched just above that, a large box or chest, at its right, and a small lamp sort of object at the foot of the bed that appeared to change colors. I was taken off of the mobile bed and placed gently into the one for the room before the giant left, leaving me alone in this quiet, empty, small room. My focus was immediately directed then to the small lamp in front of me as small moving figures started emerging from it. Little bears, I remember, though I didn't know what a bear was of course. I think I just thought of them as "little me's"; small and harmless looking, though different in most, if not every way, from the God being or the giants in his command.

They amused me, these "little me's", but I also found them curious. Mostly, of course, because I couldn't understand just how they could have come from that small light, but also I wondered what they were dancing about. Their stubby little arms flailed all about at the same time, performing in unison almost with one another. From what I could see, too, there was no God being or any sort of force guiding them as there was in that room with me. The other thing, and the thing that stuck with me the longest with this, was how they all danced together, happily following one another's lead while smiling, even joining hands.

I, however, hadn't even been allowed to really meet my own brethren. I knew of them, but I didn't *know them.* To my understanding, too, even at that time, I knew that, for most of them, I likely never would. We would always be strangers to one another. Brethren, yet aliens unto one another.
