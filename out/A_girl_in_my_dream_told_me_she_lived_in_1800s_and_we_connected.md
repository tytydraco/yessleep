Hey guys, I'm not sure if this place would be the right place but I think it is worth a try as I've told almost everyone in my network and none of them know it. I donâ€™t know if anyoneâ€™s going to know the situation but I need to put this out there. Maybe someone can explain why I'm having this connection.

Iâ€™ve been dreaming about the same girl for over a month and almost every single day. Sometimes when I try to stay all-nighters but always end up sleeping in and this dream started continuously from last night.

At first, I thought it was just a weird recurring dream because I realized I was dreaming and I could control everything in my dream, I know some people have this experience too so I was like just going with the flow, why not right, except every morning I felt extremely tired and dizzy.

There was one girl who was always in my dream. You know how like sometimes you dream about someone you donâ€™t know but they feel familiar? It was like that, but different in my dream because it didn't feel like I was dreaming, only after I woke up and realized that was a dream, and I did not know her at all, it was a face that I had never seen it in my entire life.

In my dream, we talked a lot. I can remember things about her like how she always walked barefoot on the grass in the summer (judging by the hot weather and sun, yes, I literally feel the temperature!!). She had a habit of humming when she was nervous. She told me she once saw the northern lights and cried because she thought the sky was breaking.

It felt SO real you know, too real!

And then one night, I said that if you were a real person that I could see in real life that would be the greatest gift of all time for me. I was so conscious that I knew it was a dream and if this was true how perfect was that?

AND THEN!! She looked at me and for the first time, she seemed sad and I remember she said that "I wish it was real as well"!!!

It was shocking to me, BUT! She also said that "It was wonderful to spend the last month with you every day and get to know me, this is the last time we are going to see each other. You know, you are different people than those people in town and I like you a lot, but this time t I couldn't hold you longer, you got your life and I got mine".

??? From this moment, a peculiar idea popped into my mind, I asked her what she meant, but she wouldnâ€™t explain and said it was for my own good.

Fine, I asked where she lived maybe I could find her after (I was testing her, the ridiculous idea to say to an NPC but I did it anyway because I wanted to see where the plot took me. Yes, at this point I still don't believe)

She was a little hesitant but quickly said: we call itÂ **Moose**. underÂ **Kewatin/Keewatin??**Â I couldn't remember, not even sure if this is the right spelling from the sound of it.

I of course didnâ€™t recognize the name and I have never heard of it in my life. It was for sure just a fake place made up by my brain. Then she was gone and I woke up.

I woke up with my heart pounding and still did not believe what I just heard or dreamed. I quickly checked the location and it gave me goosebumps.

IT WAS 1800s.

At this point, I'm certain that I couldn't know its place as I don't have any reason to know this, I don't study history or geographic expert, this couldn't be my subconscious.

It was almost 3 weeks past and I had never dreamed about her again. The only memory I have is the above and her name was Catherine.

Should I make a trip? I'm not sure if this is appropriate because I heard that it was not good to go to a place you dream about. ðŸ†˜
