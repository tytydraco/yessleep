At the time, I did not have much money. I was a poor boy, saving what little I had left. That was when I made the worst decision a young man could make in his relentless search for good prices at an engineering college: I found a name.

Hellborn.

I took the first plane ticket from New York to Hellborn. At first glance, it seemed like a peaceful place, somewhat melancholic, with people who barely looked one another in the face and animals that appeared to have more life than the humans.

Margot, the young woman who, for a few coins, allowed me to live on the second floor of a three-story building. The apartment was small, with a wooden ceiling full of gaps.

The college was very close, which allowed me to keep working on my online projects. They paid well and supported me throughout the week. I organized the entire apartment, trying to give life to the dead place.

I adapted easily to that place. I, an ambitious man, would not spare the last coins I had left for a good future. The routine, at first, was quiet. It was then, on one of my walks back from college, that I met her: Zara Fenlon. A young girl, no more than nineteen years old. She liked to part her short hair into two little pigtails and wear short skirts, with a top on Fridays.

My poor, innocent heart beat like an unsteady drum. Always before going back home, I dampened my hair and put on a good perfume, thinking she would notice a skinny boy whose only heavy thing he could lift was his study books. By some miracle, she did.

My weekends were filled by a blonde girl, with shallow conversations. She spoke little, but she liked my company. We always stayed watching movies, while I sat there sweating like a wrung-out cloth.

Some time later, I discovered that she was my upstairs neighbor.

Over time, things began to change. I no longer ran into her on my walks, nor in the corridors. Curious, I thought about knocking on her door, but that would be strange. I preferred to stay on the stairs, looking at her door.

I bought several movies I hoped to watch with her. I even thought about peeking through the crack of her door. That was when Zara finally appeared… on a small piece of paper, written in poorly phrased English, inviting me to have dinner at her place.

I went to college practically skipping with joy. It would be that night. I was decided; I would kiss her.

Wearing my best clothes, I applied a good amount of gel and almost used up the entire bottle of perfume. I counted the seconds on my wristwatch. When the time finally came, I almost ran.

I stopped in front of her door; I could almost hear my heartbeat in my ears. I took a deep breath. She opened the door.

A cheeky smile lit up her lips, her eyes widening into perfect circles. She was barefoot, her hair unkempt. I did not question her appearance; I was blind with emotion.

She invited me in. With my first step into her apartment, the smell of garbage mixed with something rotten filled my nostrils. I immediately covered them with my hand, wanting only to flee, but remembering my foolish goal.

I looked carefully around me. The apartment was filled with flies; trash covered half the floor; dirty rags, soaked in a reddish liquid, were thrown into the corners. An incessant dripping sound, which in my poorly slept nights I associated with some broken pipe, echoed without pause. From where I stood, I could see several dirty dishes piled in the sink.

Maybe… maybe she was just a disorganized person.

Fool that I was.

She asked me to sit on the chair in front of the small round table, on which a plate rested. With an exasperated sigh, held back by emotion, I obeyed. We talked about different topics; at every moment, I placed my wet hands on my pants, rubbing them.

I watched as the yellowish liquid mixed with the red, until there was nothing else but that. She sat across from me, wearing that same smile. Flies hovered over us, and the yellowish light of the bulb above our heads made the liquid darker. She said it was a soup, a regional delicacy.

I picked up the spoon with some hesitation and stopped halfway.

But then I went on. It was the worst thing I had ever put in my mouth. The taste was metallic, accompanied by an indescribable flavor. I forced my throat to carry the liquid down to my stomach. With a smile that made my lip tremble, I continued, until not a single drop remained.

When I finished, she asked that we watch something. I sat beside her, closer than on any other day, and put an arm around her icy shoulder, which I associated with the temperature of the room. At last, I got what I wanted: a kiss. The rest of the night went by, the low sound of the television filling the silence.

After that night, I returned to my apartment, following my routine. It was on one night, when I was coming back from college, that, as I climbed the stairs, I found several police officers. The air became trapped in my lungs.

Zara’s body was on a stretcher, her face pale, no longer the white I used to see during my walks. I stopped halfway up the stairs, unable to move. Her eyes were fixed on mine, dead and hollow. When they took her body away, I went straight to Mrs. Margot. She told me everything: Zara Fenlon had been dead for over a month.
