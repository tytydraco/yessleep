My greetings dear reader

I am a demon, born of fire and brimstone, lurking in the darkness, hiding in the shadows. For centuries, Ihave been the fuel of nightmares, the embodiment of fear. But as the world has grown more modern, I have been forced to adapt, to change my tactics. No longer do I come into the flesh, horns and all, to torment mortalshave been weaving myself into the old myths and tales, watching as people dismissed me as nothing more than a figment of their imagination. But I am very real. I feed on fear, on the terror that grips people when they sense my presence. 

They may think they are safe from me, but I am always watching, waiting for the right moment to strike. I am the nightmare that haunts your dreams and the darkness that envelops your soul. You may try to deny my existence, but I am always there, lurking just beyond your perception, waiting to unleash my terror upon the world., you don't know me but I know I have been  always watching you .

 I know who you are not from your face but from the fears inside your heart . Know that this warning will reveal a lot of questions you may have . 

This is why some people are found murdered or disappear with no clue . Keep in mind you Knowing this helps me more than but if your lucky and smart you might just escape . Let tell you a story about a man named jack.  

"Jack, was a man plagued by a demon arguably worse than me the demon of alcoholism, he had been struggling for many years with this addiction I know I have been watching him. He drowned his sorrows in bottles upon bottles of liquor, seeing no light at the end of the tunnel," 

"But then, Jack started seeing things .At first, he thought they were just hallucinations caused by the alcohol. But when he started to sober up, the shadows persisted. They taunted him, whispered in his ear, and clawed at him in the darkness reminding him of his life, of his failures, of how his wife had left him, of how his daughter had died because of him driving while drunk and of course of how he survived and continued on."



"You see  Jack knew he had to make a change. He started to quit drinking, slowly but surely, turning his life around. Almost felt bad for the guy He he had almost finally escaped the grips of his addiction, but little did he know that the monsters weren't only in his head, no we were real, very real."



"The next day, Jack was found by the Police with his eyes removed and placed on the floor looking up at a strange symbol and  his arms gone. The monsters had ripped them apart, using them to write messages on the walls around him messages you wouldn't understand my dear reader things far beyond you . 

Jack was left to bleed out, alone and terrified his now riped arms crawled to the keyboard and started writing what you are reading now"

"And now, dear reader are you sure you're not seeing me right now? With corner of year just beyond ear shit breathing's under your bed waiting for you to slip"
