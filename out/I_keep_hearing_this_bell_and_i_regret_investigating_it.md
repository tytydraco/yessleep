Let’s start off with when this began. 

I go to a small private school where everyone knows everyone. One day I heard this bell ring. It’s not like the one that the teacher uses to let us know that the class period has ended. For the purposes of this I’ll call the teacher Mrs.D. For some reason no one else, that I know of, can hear the ring of this bell. When it rings and I look around, no one has a reaction to it. I know that it’s not a ringtone or a text tone. The bell never rings at the same time either, it can ring during lunch or class. I’ve asked Mrs.D if she has heard it but she just looks at me like I have three heads or something. I’ve asked my friends but they just say that I’m hearing things or it’s part of the music I listen to, I know it’s not. 

One day I decided to investigate the ringing bell. When the Mrs.D asked me to go gets some books from the other building, I stayed and went to explore. First the floor we were on. I looked in every room, even the boys restroom. Then I explored the floor below us, the offices. No luck there. Next was the basement, to clarify our school basement isn’t like the ones in horror stories, this one is where we have our break and lunch. But it did feel a little scaring being alone down there. 

I paused my music and started searching. I had a feeling someone, or something, was down there watching me. I’ve never had the feeling down in that basement of this small, Christian, private school. When I sat down for a break I heard a thud from the stairwell area. When I got to the vending machines I looked down and saw a coke, in that little slot they fall to, and a quarter in the coin return. “Weird” I whispered to myself. Someone must have left it from yesterday, it’s before break. 

Thinking back I know no one would have left a soda in the vending machine. 

The soda got my mind off the thud. I grabbed the coke and pocketed the coin. As I sat down I opened the can and took a sip. “If someone left this then they wouldn’t care if I took it” I said to myself to justify taking the coke. 

I turned to look around while I sat  and for a split second I thought I saw a weird figure in the corner of the basement. When I looked at where the figure was all I saw was brick. 

Then I heard it. It was louder than usual. It was longer and more ominous. The ring made me spill the coke all over the table, I knew it would stain the white surface. I looked all around me and didn’t see anything but the coke stained table. 

I got up and walked over to the teachers’ table and grabbed the roll of paper towels. I cleaned up the spilled soda and threw away the soaked towels. Once I got everything situated, I sat down and drank the little bit of coke that the can had left for me. 

As I started to get worried that I was just hearing things I stood up to start getting to the task that was assigned to me. 

As I got closer to the door, it slammed shut. “Maybe the wedge gave out?” I tried to think positively. When I leaned into the door it wouldn’t budge. I tried again, and again… Still it wouldn’t budge. 

“Alright! Quit messin’ and let me out!” I half yelled to the door hoping one of my friends were leaning onto it keeping me from leaving this basement. 

After those words had left my lips, I heard that damned bell again. Somehow it was longer and scarier. More ominous. 

Then something happens that turned me paler than I already was…

All the voice said was:
“You…. Are…. Not…. Leaving…. This…. Place….”
