My name is Arjun but you can call me AR, and I never believed in ghost stories or anything like this. But after what went down in 2017, I am not very sure anymore.

It all started when I went to my grandmother's village for winter holidays. It's a small, quiet place in the middle of nowhere. At night, everything is silent—so silent, it feels like the world is holding its breath.

On my first night there, I couldn't sleep. The house felt. wrong. It felt like something was watching me, even though I was alone in the room. Around 10:00 PM, I decided to step outside for some fresh air.

The night was cold and moonlit. I had gone a little way down the path behind the house where the land stretched out flat and broken only by a few large, scattered trees. As I walked, I felt it—the heavy, suffocating feeling that someone, or something, was watching me.

Then I saw it.

A shadow. It wasn't mine. It stood near one of the trees, long and twisted, stretching unnaturally under the moonlight. Its shape didn't make sense, like it wasn't bound by the same rules as the world around it.

I couldn’t move. My breath caught in my throat as the shadow shifted, sliding closer toward me—not walking, but floating. I wanted to believe it was a trick of the light, but deep down, I knew it wasn’t.

I grabbed my phone, my Samsung Galaxy S6, and snapped a quick photo of the scene. My hands were shaking, and I didn't even dare look at the picture until I was back inside the house.

When I finally checked the photo, my blood ran cold. The shadow was faintly visible in the picture, standing unnaturally tall near the tree. Its shape looked warped, as though it was trying to take on a form but couldn't quite manage it.

I didn't sleep that night. I couldn't. Every creak of the house, every whisper of the wind outside felt like it was coming for me.

On the second night, I tried to convince myself it was just my imagination. But that evening, as I walked past the same spot where I had seen the shadow, I felt the same suffocating presence.

"Arjun...... Arjun......."

The whispers were faint at first, like the wind. But then they grew louder, clearer. They were calling my name.

I turned around and stopped. This time, the shadow was approaching, gliding across flat land toward me. Whispers surrounded me; the voices multiplied as they all shouted in my ear.

"Do not run, Arjun......."

I ran as hard as my legs could push me. I ran straight back into the house, pounding the door closed behind me. My grandmother asked what happened to me, but I could not open up my mouth.

On my last night in the village, the whispers returned—but this time, they were inside the house.

"Arjun....... open your eyes."

I felt a chill run through me. I hadn't even realized I was squeezing my eyes shut. Slowly, I opened them, and my heart nearly stopped.

It stood at the foot of my bed, towering more than it did before, and its head was almost brushing against the ceiling. It leaned in closer, though it had no face, and I could have sworn that it was looking deep into my soul.

"You can't leave me, Arjun," it whispered, its voice sharp and cold, cutting through my thoughts like a knife.

I do not remember how the night ended. When I woke up, I was on the floor, and I was covered with drenched sweat. The shadow was gone, but a photo on my phone kept haunting me: the shadow stood near the tree, just like the cold wind that had flown through that night.

Even now, years after, I can't get it out of my head. There are times when I sit alone in the dark; I still hear the whispering. And when I dare to look into the darkness, I feel it's there, waiting for me.

It's not gone. I don't think it will ever be.
