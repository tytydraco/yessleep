I looked back at the clean walls and wondered why the last family had left this place in such a hurry. 

It was literally luxury or at least it looked the part. I'm pretty sure this is just about as bougie as places get in a neighborhood like this. Loud rap music blared from four different directions outside my front door, and a drug deal or two was probably occurring simultaneously under two different sets of stairs. 

This house was definitely a beauty for what I paid per month. 

Hopefully, none of my new neighbors stopped by to say hi. It wasn’t that I didn’t like them; I just wasn’t interested in being a part of anything new. This place was perfect for a shut-in like me. I couldn’t care less about the outside world, just as long as my home was safe. 

I walked in and immediately closed every curtain. 

Great! 

The local home warehouse store had already set up my new refrigerator. I began placing my groceries in neatly. I took out all the nuts I had and put them into jars with their names attached. I did the same with my raisins and grains. I grabbed my stacks of noodles and got to work unwrapping each of them and putting them into their own jars. 

Then I heard a shuffling sound. I stopped and looked back toward the bathroom, where the noise had come from. 

No movement. 

Whatever that noise was, it could wait. I still had at least 10 hours’ worth of food to put away, and some of it would spoil in 5 hours. So, I had to rush. 

It was when I was three hours into putting away the neatly sliced pineapple pieces that I saw something dart from one room to another out of the corner of my eye. 

I stopped what I was doing and let the pineapple pieces fall from my grip into the jar in the fridge. I stared, blinking like a maniac for a few moments at the dark, open doors. 

Then I realized something more important though it should’ve been immediately obvious. The doors were open, and it was dark. 

I slowly got up and stared at the window on the opposite wall. It was already night. Crap. 

I grabbed my phone and looked at my timer. I had 40 minutes left until it rang. It had already been almost 4 hours. 

I cracked my back, moaning loudly and yawning all at the same time. It was moments like these that made me feel like an old geezer, even though I was only 22. 

At least most of my jars were put away, neatly stacked on top of each other in the fridge. The others would have to go into the deep freezer. 

I walked over to it, feeling a weird chill up my spine. I looked back instinctively to see a gun raised at me. 

WOAH! When had that gotten there? Then the gun started moving as the person slowly revealed themselves, stepping out of the shadows. 

"Oh, hi?" I said conversationally. 

"Where's the money?" said the angry, very well-built-for-business woman holding a gun pointed at my stomach. 

I looked at her and raised an eyebrow. Then I let out a loud "Ha!" "You making a joke?" 

She snarled, clearly not seeing anything funny. I continued smiling because, in God’s grace, why would she think I had money? 

"Look around, and when you find money, tell me. Or could you at least tell the money to call me sometimes? It would definitely help a whole lot." 

She snarled again. "This isn’t a joke. Give me your valuables." 

I laughed another loud "Ha!" this time it surprised me too. "Sorry," I said, looking at her as she straightened her gun, aiming it at my stomach. 

I looked down awkwardly. "You could take whatever you’d like, honestly. I wouldn’t mind." 

She slowly lowered her weapon. "What’s wrong with you? Most people literally pee their pants at the sight of a gun, yet you don’t seem " Before she could finish robbing me, we both turned to the sound of a loud \*THWAP\*. Something had fallen, super loudly. 

"Wha" "Huh?" we both said. Now we looked back at each other and then toward the bathroom, where the noise had come from. 

She pointed her gun that way at least it wasn’t at me anymore and I let her lead the way. I followed behind, feeling like a weak, pathetic chicken. 

I whispered to her, "I haven’t even officially moved in yet. I don’t know what could be making noise in there." 

She glanced back at me, anger still on her face. We both cautiously walked to the side of the empty bathroom. Then, with a swoosh, we turned the corner like trained army veterans. 

Okay, the bathroom was supposed to be empty. That was until a projectile complimentary soap came flying right into my forehead. I felt it connect and made a loud, pathetic "EHH!" noise. I quickly rubbed my now-stinging head, but that wasn’t the main thing in the room. 

The thing taking my attention and I’m pretty sure the very angry woman’s too was the teenage-looking boy tossing the soaps at the wall like he was bored and needed something to do with his hands. 

I made that weird "EHH!" noise again at the sight and quickly wished the sound would disappear from my apparent vocabulary. 

I heard the woman take in a large gasp before letting it out. "A kid?" she said, as if she thought it was going to be another robber. 

"What? You scared your competition was trying to rob this place too?" 

The kid finally looked over at us with a grace of uncaring I didn’t know was possible yet. 

"What are you losers looking at?" 

"Huh? Excuse me? This is \*my\* house," I said, exasperated. These two couldn’t just come into \*my\* place expecting \*me\* not to care. 

Then the kid froze up with a look of shock on his face. "Y-You… you can see me?" He looked shocked, a far cry from the uncaring grace he had before. 

Me and the woman both stared at him a bit longer before we looked at each other, confused, and then back at him again. 

"Yes," we both said, though mine came out a lot more annoyed. 

"What? Did you think you were wearing camo?" I said, trying for a joke. I could tell it fell flat since they both had differing facial expressions, none of which suggested laughter. 

I dropped my chin a little, sulking. Well, I thought I was pretty funny, at least, and that’s all that matters. 

"Whatever this is between you and your son, I don’t care. I’m not done robbing you." 

I gasped. "SON!" Then I pointed at him. "That kid is not mine!" 

She rolled her eyes. "I don’t care if you don’t want to pay child support either." She walked off, probably to continue robbing my belongings. 

I sighed and slowly dropped my pointer finger, only to see the craziest smile of insanity on the teen’s face I’d ever seen on another human. 

"Hey there, buddy?" I said, as if I were talking to a stray dog. "I’m not exactly sure what you’re doing or how you got into my house. I just know I’m gonna have to ask you to leave." 

His smile of crazy stayed perfectly in place. Well, this is weird. 

"You can see me…" he said again, but this time it sounded darker. 

I shook my head at him like he was being stupid. "Obviously, like I said, no camo. Also, are you here to rob me too?" 

I heard jars being moved and looked back to see the woman taking stacks of my fruit jars. 

"Hey, weird guy, and son… I’m gonna… get going. I’ve got business plans with another family soon, okay?" 

I fake-smiled back at her, trying to hide my obvious anger. 

"Great. Hope that family you rob next on your itinerary is more fortunate than me," I said, waving her off. 

She looked at me and then just proceeded to walk right out the front door. I might as well not have said anything. 

I looked back only to see the teen now directly in my face, smiling all insane-like. 

I screamed again like a man. "EHH!" 

The boy started to laugh. He better not have been laughing at me. 

"Wow, that’s some manly scream you got there." 

It turned out he \*was\* laughing at me. 

I rolled my eyes. "Well, stop freaking me out and get out of my house already." 

"No," he said matter-of-factly. 

I raised an eyebrow. "No?" 

He shook his head like now he thought I was dumb. 

"But this is \*my\* house." 

"So? And?" I sighed. Teens are so sassy, and for no reason too. 

"I’m calling the cops," I said, already fast-dialing them. 

"Sure, go ahead," said the still-smiling kid. 

"Hello, this is a 911 operator speaking?" 

"Yes, hello. I just moved into \[my address\], and I was wondering if you could send some cops over. There’s been a robbery, and there’s a kid here for some reason." 

"Yes, I’ll be sure to do that," said the woman on the other end of the line. 

I heard some tapping on the phone and just listened while I watched the kid and his still-stupid smiling face. He mouthed the words \*You’ll see\* to me, making me raise another eyebrow. 

It took 40 minutes before I heard the sirens and a knock at my door. I had gotten so bored I’d gone back to fixing my jars into the fridge neatly. 

I opened the door, annoyed, and quickly hung up on the 911 operator. 

"Hello," said the man in the cop uniform. 

"Hey," I said, letting him in. He stared down at all my jars sitting by the fridge and deep freezer. 

"He’s in here." 

The cop looked back at me, and we walked to the bathroom. 

"Come here," I said to the teen. He got down off my counter and walked over, standing in front of me and the cop. 

"See? Whose kid is this?" I said, annoyed, pointing at the side of the teen’s head. 

The cop looked at me, then back at the boy, and then back at me. 

"What kid?" said the cop, looking at me now like I had grown a second head. 

"Wha-hu-wha?" I said, probably sounding like a very weird and lost old man. 

"THIS KID!" I said, even more annoyed now. 

"There’s no kid in here. You’re pointing at nothing." 

What? 

I looked over at the still-smiling boy. 

Then the cop looked past us into the bathroom. "Unless you mean that mirror over there?" He was pointing in the direction my finger was pointing. Huh, I thought. 

"Told you, moron," said the teen, grinning. 

I looked between the two. If there was no one in the room besides me and the cop, I probably looked like a crazy person. 

To save myself a trip to a mental facility, I told him it was probably a false alarm and that the woman who had broken in earlier had scared the daylights out of me so much that I was paranoid now. 

When he left, he looked back at my giant amounts of jars on the floor. "Yeah, paranoid for sure," he said, smiling at me like he was joking. I didn’t find this funny. 

I probably just became an inside joke for his entire department. I sat down glumly after the cop had left. 

"What’s got you acting like a sad rom-com?" said the see-through boy. 

"Why couldn’t he see you?" 

The boy’s smile disappeared and was replaced with annoyance. "There’s no way you’re this stupid," said the kid. 

I looked at him with nothing but confusion, and then I saw realization hit him. "Oh, you are," he said, beginning to laugh. 

Whoever’s kid this was, he was very mean and insulting. 

I sulked some more. "I thought paranoid people like you were smart… I’m a ghost." 

I felt my eyes grow wider. "A what now? A ghost?" 

He laughed some more, clapping and slapping things, one of which included the chair. It went on for longer than was appropriate, so I knew he was just doing it to be mean. 

"Okay, I’m dead. A ghost. A boo." 

"How?" I said, looking back at him. 

He stopped laughing and frowned at the question. "Shut your face." 

I nodded. "I’m not paranoid; I’m just neat," I said, feeling slightly defensive. 

He looked over at the jars. "You don’t say." 

"Well, I don’t." 

"What?" he asked. 

I looked at him blankly. "I don’t say." He rolled his eyes. 

Then I got the heebie-jeebies that I was supposed to get the first time around at seeing a ghost. I remembered his terrifying smile from earlier, and fear slowly crept in. 

This teen was a ghost. A spirit. Whatever else words you can use to describe it. A boo, as he called it. 

"Do I spook you?" 

"No," I said, defensive again, but now I wasn’t really sure.
