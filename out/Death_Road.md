Please forgive me, as It has been almost ten years since this event took place so I am a little fuzzy on a few of the details, but I will tell it to the best of my ability. 

It was mid March, my friends and I were in our early twenties, and were really into backpacking, hiking, camping, etc. Living in the pacific northwest, we were definitely in the right area to satiate our cravings for the outdoors. 

We wanted to go on a weekend camping trip, so earlier in the week we went out scouting for an area to camp. After we drove a ways out of town, we found a rural road that looked really promising. 

A few miles down the road, we came to an intersection. We could continue straight, where the paved road turned gravel, turn left to be near a creek about twenty feet from the road, or turn right to what looked like a little-used, mostly grass-covered road. We decided to turn right and see what that area held. The grassy road followed a gentle left curve for about a hundred yards, then opened up to a small roundabout with a flat campground looking area to the right of it. The site looked like it had been used plenty of times, but there was a lot of untouched grass on the road and flat area, so we assumed no one had been there in a while. 

We liked the spot, but it was a little close to the road for us, so we decided to get out and have a look around. Shortly into our inspection, we found a trail that went deeper into the woods. We hiked up it for a quarter mile or so, and really liked the way it looked. It was rural enough that we could really "feel" like we were in the outdoors, and there was no pesky cell reception to distract us from mother nature. After deciding this would be our spot for the upcoming weekend, we packed up and headed home. 

Once we got back to cell service, one of us used Google maps to make sure our prospective campsite wasn't on anyone's property. To our relief, we were in the clear for several miles around the area. 

We decided that since we were all able to get friday off work, we would pack up Thursday after getting home, and head out that night, so as to squeeze the most out of our trip. 

Fast forward to Thursday night. All of our gear is packed, and we have all the food, water, and illicit substances we could need for three days of unwinding in the woods. 

As we pulled up the familiar grassy road and we get around the bend, we see the reflection of our headlights glaring back at us from the darkness like the eyes of a large demon, angry we intruded on its slumber.  It was the tail lights of a parked car. Our hearts collectively drop as we slow to a stop and decide what to do. We can hear a dog barking, and see a tent set up near the car, so we decide to turn tail and head home in defeat. 

After regrouping at home, we decide that if we try again the following night, it would be enough time that hopefully whoever was there would have packed up and left. 

Fast forward to Friday night. We pull up and the car is still there, along with the tent and the barking dog. Big let down for sure, but after a brief talk amongst ourselves, we decide to risk it and stay. We park on the roundabout, about fifty feet away from the car and tent, and hike up the trail so that we can be away from whoever was already there. 

We get out and the dog's barking reaches a feral crescendo. Based on the fact that it hasn't already come over and started mauling us, we assume it's leashed up or something. We quickly put on our packs and hike up the trail in the dark with our flashlights on. 

It's a creepy walk, especially since everyone is practically holding our breaths in fear of someone coming out to yell at us for trespassing or ruining their night or something, but nothing happens. 

After making it to a good spot and setting up camp, we get right to partying. We joke about what the camper, or campers we passed must be thinking or doing right about now, and try to scare eachother with half-cocked theories about whoever it is and what they might do to take revenge on us for barging in on their quiet evening. Little did we know, the memory of our trip would be ruined in a way that none of us could have guessed. Eventually we all fall asleep, and the next day rolls around. 

We spent that Saturday hiking further up the trail and exploring. Nothing major happens, and we end the night much in the same way we did the previous one. Sunday is when the story takes a turn. Everyone is tired, hungover, and pretty much ready to go back civilization, so we start hiking back to the car. 

When we get there, we all notice a complete shift in the atmosphere. I can only describe the scene as eerie. It felt like all the life had been sucked out of the wilderness. For the first time since arriving, the woods were completely silent. The car was still there, and so was the tent, but we don't hear the dog barking anymore. Being daylight now, we can see more of the encampment. It was unusual, to say the least. 

The car was up on the type of little ramps people use for working on their vehicles. The tent was opened, and there was a plastic fold-up picnic table set up next to the car with all kinds of things on it. Motor oil, transmission fluid, automotive tools, a gallon of milk with the lid off, paper plates, miscellaneous food items, etc. It looked like someone was working on their car in the middle of the woods, and stopped to prepare a meal, only to seemingly vanish into thin air. 

Curiosity overtook better judgement, and we decided to have a look around. Walking cautiously through the campsite, we looked for any clues about why the person, or people, could have left in such a hurry. My mind immediately went to the missing 411 cases.

One of my friends pointed out that the windows of the vehicle were heavily fogged up, so we tried our best to peer inside. The windows were also pretty heavily tinted so looking through them proved difficult, but the fog hadn't quite reached the edges of the glass. This made it possible to just barely see the silhouette of a large dog in the back seat. It sat there upright and panting hard, but not moving or making any other noise. My heart sank. It was Sunday morning, and for all I knew, that dog had been trapped in this car since Thursday night when we first arrived. I assumed that was why it wasn't barking anymore, as it probably didn't even have the energy to do so and was likely badly dehydrated. We debated what to do, and decided trying to break a window or open a door to let the dog out was a bad idea, since it could be violent, or hurt itself on the broken glass. 

Since we didn't have cell reception, we decided with heavy hearts that the best choice would be to drive back to town and call animal control as soon as we had service. We left, and I made the call and did my best to explain the situation to the person who answered. He told me he would head out to the area in a few hours and update me on how it went. I thanked him, and that was the end of the call. 

I waited around for hours to hear back from the guy, and I started getting restless. Worried for the well being of the dog, I ended up calling him back when it reached around  7PM. He said he tried to follow my instructions, but to my dismay, he mistakenly continued straight down the gravel road for several miles rather than turning right onto the grassy road. He had actually just gotten back to cellphone service when I called. 

He told me he would head back out there the next day and try again, as it was getting late and he had other calls he had to get to. I was distraught. I started debating heading out there myself to let the dog out of the vehicle, but ultimately decided it would be best to let the professionals handle it. I had no idea how good that decision was at the time... 

The next day, I heard nothing back from the animal control guy, despite several calls from me. By about 7PM I was really frustrated, and desperately hoping for the best, but ultimately, fearing the worst. That's when one of my friends, who'd been silently browsing her phone for a while, suddenly gasped. 

When we asked what was wrong, she started reading aloud from her phone. It was a news story from a city about four hours away from ours. To this day, I have no idea how or why they were able to report on this news so quickly. The story roughly went as follows: 

"On *redacted* road (the same one we went down to camp)  in the town of *redacted* Animal Control was called about a dog trapped in a vehicle for several days. When they arrived on scene, they tried the door of the vehicle, which was locked. The animal control employee called the local deputies, and a state patrol officer who was in the area showed up to assist. Upon shining his flashlight through the tinted window of the vehicle, the state patrol officer was able to identify the body of a woman in the back seat, accompanied by the dog in question. When the local deputies arrived, they were able to open the vehicle and help animal control capture the dog, a pit bull, who was very aggressive upon the door being opened. The woman, identified as *redacted* was deceased. Cause of death is at this time unknown. " 

We all sat in silence for about, I kid you not, maybe ten seconds, and then my phone rang, showing a private number. I answered, and a female voice said "Hello, this is detective *redacted*, is this Mr. *redacted*?" To which I answered by saying "Yes, may I ask what this is about?" Or something along those lines. She asked if I was the person who called in the dog trapped in the car, and I told her that I was. She asked me to explain to her what happened, and I told her everything from the Thursday night we went out there, up until our present phone call -minus the bit about us just having read the news story. Something in my gut told me it would be better not to mention what we had just learned. She seemed surprised, and said "oh, that's it?" To which I replied that yes, that was all. And as an afterthought, I asked how the dog was doing. She said it was alive and in the hands of animal control. I then asked if she needed anything else from me, and she said no, but that I would hear from her if anything else came up. 

The call ended, and we all started talking at once, asking each other if anyone had touched the vehicle, or anything at the campsite. To our relief, it appeared none of us had. We couldn't help but imagine what would have happened had we broken a window to rescue that poor dog though. 

The next day I called the animal control guy and re-introduced myself, and apologized for his experience after explaining that we saw a news story about what he had found. I asked him what would become of the dog, and he told me it was going to the humane society and that they were going to try to rehabilitate it. Apparently, it had been trapped in the vehicle so long that it started eating the person who was in there with it.  I asked if I could come visit the dog, and he said that right now the dog was technically "evidence" related to the case and that I couldn't see it, but he would let me know if anything changed. 

After a few weeks of waiting and wondering, I called the humane society to ask about the dog, and was told they regrettably had to put it down. I guess there was just no coming back from what that poor thing went through. I didn't get, or ask for any more details. 

Eventually we got word about the coroner's report. The woman was transient, and a mother with an ex-husband and a nine year old son. She died from a drug overdose. Time of death was recorded to have happened at approximately midnight of the very same Thursday that we first went to the camp site and saw her car. 

After all this time, I googled that old news story about what had happened just to refresh my memory on the details. What I found really took me by surprise. According to several other news stories that came up in my search results, stretching back to at least as early as 16 years before our event took place, and up until the current year of 2025, there have been a surprising number of mysterious deaths that occur on that specific road we found... 

We haven't been back to that neck of the woods since, and probably never will.
