I grew up in a small rural town in Wisconsin named Murney. It was… well– rural. The population never exceeded a few thousand inhabitants, and it wasn’t in the way of main roads so visitors were rare. Frequently, those who did drive into town were lost, and once a kind stranger pointed them in the other direction, that was the end of it. My hometown was surrounded by farmland too. In fact, I might not be exaggerating if I said there were more livestock than there were people. Anyways! I’m getting sidetracked. Sorry if I do it a lot. I have a tendency to ramble. Grew up in Murney, Wisconsin, where dense forest and farmland enveloped our livelihoods for miles.



I didn’t know if I really wanted to share this story here because I doubt I will be taken seriously. The reason why I’m sharing is because I’ve recently come to realize my own mortality. Nothing extraordinary. Just things I cannot do anymore without hurting myself. I used to love climbing trees as a girl, reaching for the highest branch and overlooking the world below me. Now, I’m waking up to new aches in my body just from moving around. I just turned 48 in December. I have no living relatives. No husband, and no children. I’m only getting older, and I don’t see myself ever marrying when there will always be far younger and prettier women than me. The thought of being forgotten frightens me, that I may never leave anything behind for the world after I’m gone. I suppose this may be my attempt at a legacy of sorts. Perhaps it’s the primal human in me that needs something to compensate for what happened, because God knows we deserve *something* to make up for the lifelong struggles we endure. Ugh, I sound like a bitter old woman…



Anywho… I want to talk about something that happened to me as a kid. A lot of things happened, but I think this one was the first instance of me experiencing it for myself. If people like reading about this, I might add more stories the more I dredge up old memories.



Part 1: Kelly In The Cornfield

TW: child death, and mentions of child abuse

A little bit of backstory. You are welcome to skip this, but much of what you read relies on my background. I didn’t have many friends growing up. Being one of the only two black families in an 80s rural town probably had something to do with it. Having vitiligo during that time also kept people away. My folks were decent, but beyond cordial greetings, we were barred from long term friendships. My dad worked from sunrise to sunset as the town’s milkman. My mom was a housewife that did her best with what she could. She made fantastic pancakes with maple smoked ham and eggs as yellow as the wheat fields during harvest. I don’t think she made anything that tasted bad. My mom was remarkable, with a plump, soft face and rosy cheeks, and the patience of a saint. I distinctly remember helping her make supper when I was really young. She would tell me stories about her childhood in Louisiana while teaching me how to make her grandmother’s gumbo recipe. I could go on about her forever, but I’m sure that’s not what people want to hear.



When I was six or seven, my mom suffered the first of many miscarriages. I don’t remember if I was going to have a brother or a sister. My poor mother was never the same. She stopped being so vibrant and active. She would make breakfast and clean the house before sleeping on the couch until it was time for her to make supper. She became tired and lonely. I wish I was more present for her. Instead, I stupidly believed as a little girl that this sadness would pass, and I would have my happy, bubbly mother again soon. 



After I ate breakfast, I would go outside and find a way to entertain myself until it was time to go back home for supper, bath, and bedtime. Sadly, I found myself playing alone most of the time. Most of the other kids in town wanted nothing to do with me. The common misconception around that time was that vitiligo was contagious. Just by touching someone with it, you’ll catch the white spots. Of course, it’s not true, but that didn’t stop kids from keeping their distance. I thought myself to be repulsive because of my spots. The only kid that would be my friend was a boy named Bill Anderson. Son of the pastor, but he got into plenty of trouble. He was a bit older, around nine years old, but I never paid mind to that. I was just happy to have one person who didn’t think I had some kind of plague. 



I still remember the day we became friends. I happened to stumble across his secret hideout; an old abandoned treehouse in the forest. I thought I had discovered the treehouse, so imagine my shock when a boy climbed up into the dusty wooden house to discover me rummaging around with his belongings.



“Hey! What are you doing in my secret base!?” He shouted as he scrambled out of the trapdoor opening and cornered me. In my defense, I was seven, and I thought the treehouse was abandoned. He snatched his He-Man toy out of my hands before noticing those pale splotches on my hands. He paused. “You’re that girl with the white spots, right?”



I shyly nodded.



His demeanor shifted from irritated to curious. He examined my hand where my vitiligo was most prevalent. “I have a dog with white spots. Her name is Leia,” he told me. “I’m Bill. What’s your name?”



I was perplexed by the sudden shift in tone from this kid. He went from being about to make me cry to telling me the name of his dog and asking me what my name was. I answered, “Noelle…” in a soft whisper.



Bill grinned, showing that where his right canine was supposed to be, there was an empty space. He must’ve met the Tooth Fairy as of recently. He allowed me to stay in his treehouse and play with his toys as long as I didn’t tell anyone about it. We must have played for hours before the sky had been painted in brilliant hues of orange and purple, and it was time to return home. He waited for me to go down the ladder first. “Careful, Noelle. The fourth step is a bit crooked. I’ve slipped a few times and hurt myself,” he warned me.



When he joined me at the base of the tree, Bill smiled again. “Come back whenever you want! Our secret base will always be open to you.”



“Our base?” I murmured.



Bill nodded. “Yeah. Our base.”



From that day on, we met up every other day to explore Murney. We would play hide and seek in the vast corn fields. More often than not, Bill’s dog would accompany us. Leia was a collie breed with a black and blue merle coat, but like me, she seemed to have the same condition where parts of her coat were littered with white splotches. When I got to meet Leia, her back and the top of her head was white. She looked as if she were coated in snow. Beautiful dog with a great personality. The three of us, Me, Bill, and Leia, would go on many adventures over the course of a few years. Whenever we wandered too far into the woods, that dog would gently grab our sleeves in her mouth and lead us back to Murney. I’d like to think that these few years were the happiest time of my life.



Then it all started to slowly fall apart. Backstory over.



I was eleven years old when things went wrong. A little girl around my age went missing. Her name was Kelly Mae, I think. I barely knew her, but I recall seeing her a few times in school. She was shy, like me, but unlike me, she had many friends. She was really pretty, with golden curls and soft green eyes like spring meadows. With porcelain skin and pearly teeth, she could have been a model as an adult. I think she wanted to be a veterinarian, though. Her parents were members of the town council. When she went missing, all of the adults, including my parents, were frantic in finding her. Me and Bill? We continued on with our lives like nothing happened because we naively assumed that she may turn up alive eventually, having gotten lost but returned home. After all, who would hurt a child?



Weeks passed, and nobody ever found her. 



Bill and I decided one day to go play in the corn fields. It was the perfect place to hide and chase one another. 



Did you know that corn stalk leaves are very sharp? They can cut straight into you if you’re not careful. We knew this, but we nevertheless zipped right into the field of razor blades sleeveless because the danger aspect made it all the more fun for us.



We were playing hide and seek tag that day. Because the cornfield was so vast, and we could not come to an agreement on what game we wanted to play, we decided to mash hide and seek and tag together. Whoever was ‘it’ had to seek out the person hiding, but the twist was that they had to physically touch the hiding person to win. Thus, when you’re discovered by ‘it’, you must run away and find a new spot.



Bill liked to cheat by bringing Leia along. Of course, his dog was going to rat me out with her keen sense of smell and he knew that. But that day, Leia refused to go into the cornfield. At some point, she stopped dead in her tracks and stared at the cornfield ahead. A low, mean growl rumbled in her throat, which stopped the both of us immediately in shock. Leia never growled, not even when she played. She barked occasionally, but never growled, so this was rather startling. Leia growled again. Her blue eyes were dead set on the towering stalks. Her ears faced forward and every hair on her snowy back stood up straight.



Bill walked over to Leia and knelt down to scratch under her neck. “What’s wrong, Leia?” He asked. The collie continued to stare unblinkingly at the cornfield. Bill tugged on her collar reassuringly. She didn’t budge. “C’mon, there’s nothing to be scared of. We always go into the fields!” He tugged again, and Leia growled once more. She shook Bill’s hand off her collar and backed up.



When I took a step towards the cornstalks, that was when the dog let out a sharp, reprimanding bark. 



*Grrrrooof!!*



I jumped a little at the noise, but stopped. Her tail stood rigid and her posture spoke more than words could ever explain. She wasn’t going into those fields, and she didn’t want us going in either. Leia was a very expressive and intelligent animal. Bill jokingly told me that she had the soul of a human trapped in the body of a dog, but I believed that wholeheartedly.



I frowned. “Maybe we shouldn’t go in if Leia’s acting this way, Billy…” I said.



“What? No way!” Bill retorted as he stood back up. “The field is going to be harvested any day now– probably tomorrow! Then we’ll have to wait until next year to play in it!”



“But Leia…”



“Leia’s just barking at shadows. Dogs do that sometimes,” he explained. Leia continued to stand rigid and stare at the cornfield. He scoffed and walked into the shadowy stalks. “C’mon Noelle! I’ll be ‘it’!”



I looked back at Leia one more time before following Bill. The dog refused to follow us there even after we disappeared into the cornfield. A feeling of doubt gnawed at me as if there truly was something wrong. I could feel it, but I couldn’t put my finger on it.



Despite this feeling, everything was fine… for a while. We played for a few rounds. When it was my turn to be ‘it’ again, I counted down from 30 while I listened to the sound of rustling corn stalks. I knew Bill ran off in the opposite direction to hide.



When I counted to zero, I uncovered my eyes. It was quiet in the cornfield. A little too quiet. Usually, there would at least be the sound of crows croaking and cawing their calls in the distance as they plundered corn from their husks. But there was nothing, not even that. I brushed off that uneasy feeling swelling in my esophagus. “Ready or not! Here I come, Bill!”



I carefully slid through the cornstalks silently. I knew that if I rustled the crops too much, Bill would know what direction I was coming from and move to a new hiding spot. My little yellow sunflower dress occasionally caught on the woody green stems. I tried to be extra careful because it was new. If I tore my new outfit before I even got to wear it to school, my mom would surely wallop my behind with the big wooden kitchen spoon. It hurt like hell, but I’d take the spoon over what Bill’s father beat him with any day.



Speaking of Bill…



I almost missed it, but I saw a little bit of movement in the cornstalks far off to the right. A giggle escaped my mouth before I could stifle it and I dashed towards the source of movement in the field. “I see you Billy!!” I shrieked as I brushed past the stalks of sharp leaves. I must have chased Bill for a dozen yards before I lost him again. I panted, out of breath, but I quickly closed my mouth when a fly buzzed near my face. I swatted it away before walking ahead. Perhaps if I was quiet, I would have caught him. I kept looking, and before long I saw the same figure in the cornstalks again. I thought to myself, ‘He is really trying to tease me, isn’t he?’



I snuck closer to the shape. I reached my hand out to part the stalks, but I paused at the smell of something musty, like old leather. Like meat left out to fester in the sun for so long it shriveled into a hard piece of brittle hide. Even now, I struggle to describe it beyond what I first thought.



Death.



At first, I figured that an animal died and since then underwent advanced rot. But then I had a closer look at the figure in the dense cornstalks. The buzzing of flies replaced the silence as I parted the veil.



What I had been chasing wasn’t Bill.



I stumbled backwards with a frightened scream. I nearly fell on my back, but I scrambled to an unsteady run and fled in the opposite direction of whatever was watching me. I needed to get away from it. I didn’t care where I ended up, as long as I was far away from it. My arms, legs, and fingers grasped at the sharp edged stalks in a desperate attempt to clear my path.



I heard the cornstalks snap and rustle behind me. I was being chased. I wailed as I ran, fearing what would happen if it caught me. At some point, I started to recognize certain paths where the bunches of corn were not as dense. I was nearly out.



Right when I saw the glimmer of the outside world unsheltered from the cornfield, I felt a sharp cut across my back. The feeling of being sliced was replaced with a searing pain, but it seemed to be just enough to propel me past the last towering row of stalks and into the soft grass. I looked over my shoulder in terror. Had the thing followed me out?



There was nothing there. I sniffled and hiccuped as I shivered where I laid. I don’t recall how long I stayed where I was, but it seemed to be long enough for Bill to come looking for me. He emerged from the stalks, looking no worse for wear. When he saw me laying stiff on the grass, covered in small cuts, he immediately ran to my aid.



“Noelle!” He tried helping me up, but his efforts only caused the burning pain in my back to intensify. He removed his hand from my back once I righted myself, paling at the red coating his palm.



I was taken to the only hospital in Murney. It was small, but the few doctors there were familiar with farm-related accidents. A tractor rolls over your foot? They see that every year. A disgruntled cow gores you with her horns? Every few months. Most of my cuts were minor and only needed to be cleaned and bandaged, but the 3-inch giant cut on my back was so deep, the doctors said they could see the tissue beneath. I got stitches that evening, and a couple whacks to my butt by my mother for playing in the cornfield. I kept being told that the cause of the clean slice in my back was the result of the razor sharp leaves I haphazardly hot footed through, but I knew what I saw, and I knew what I felt on my back was not a leaf. I urged, *begged* the adults to search the cornfield for the thing in there. They didn’t take me too seriously, but Murney’s police still went and had a look a few days later.



Kelly Mae was found in the cornstalks. She had been dead for quite a while, to the point her body was completely devoid of fluids and her skin tightly shrank over her bones. The owner of the cornfield was equally appalled at the discovery as the police. He had no idea there was a corpse hiding in there. Not his wife or his kids either. There was a closed casket funeral held that same week. Nobody could bear to see that poor girl in such a state.



The story is that sweet little Kelly Mae followed an injured animal into the cornfield and got lost. She died somehow, and because the field was so dense and vast, nobody would have been able to find her until harvest. That was until two kids went to play in the field. Noelle Hayes discovered the body and was so frightened by the sight that she fled in a hurry, causing herself to be cut up by the sharp stalks.



I refuse to believe that was what happened to me. I saw Kelly Mae in there, but she wasn’t lying dead in a heap. And it definitely wasn’t the stalks that caused the injury to my back. The rest of my cuts healed over the weeks, but the biggest, deepest one took a few months to not be painful anymore. 



There were many holes in the story everyone chose to believe. While Kelly Mae was being searched for, Bill and I played in those very same fields. We would have found her before then. And what about the way Leia acted? The lack of animal noises? Nobody wanted to listen to me though, so I eventually stopped trying to make them listen. I may have escaped with my life, but not unscathed. Even now, I have a jagged, discolored, raised scar on the middle of my back. It is planted firmly amongst the dark and pale splotches on my skin.
