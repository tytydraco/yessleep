Like, I promised, I'm keeping in touch. Me, Martin, Tracy and Jayden were walking through the forest. Martin found some abandoned Shack using his map that we could use to safely figure out a plan. Unbeknownst to me, They were armed to the teeth under their protective armour. 

They had grenades, Flash bangs, Rifles, Shotguns, Pistols and a bunch more stuff that seemed like they were not accessible to the public. 

We reached this abandoned Shack and we barely had enough room to sit down in the decaying wooden chairs.

"So, what are we going to do to defeat that thing". I said in monotone. The shock of the situation, the death, the pain. It all didn't phase me as much anymore since Darius left. I felt distant from what I used to be. I felt... cold.

"Well, y'know, me and Tracy devised a plan to stop this thing". Martin said while winking towards Tracy in a flirtatious manner.

"Well, get on with it. Me and Travis don't wanna watch you have fun with your new girlfriend". Jayden snickered.

I couldn't help but laugh. The situation almost seemed less terrible.

"Alright, Here's the plan everyone. We'll use the kid as bait to lure in the pilgrim, since he encountered it before. While he stalls, Jayden and I will use our Plasma rifles and get a shot off on that thing. That should distract the pilgrim long enough for Tracy to lead us up a cliff. Once the Pilgrim teleports to us, Tracy will stab it with this plasma knife and then push it off the cliff". Martin Rambled.

"What's with the excessive use of plasma"? Jayden asked.

"Plasma weakens the pilgrim". Martin stated.

"Also how do we know if Tracy won't be busy taking pictures of the thing to actually kill it". Jayden said, annoyed.

"Excuse Me"?! Tracy said, annoyed.

"You two need to stop fighting". Martin said.

"Won't the pilgrim just teleport back up the cliff"? I asked.

"Then we shoot like crazy and hope to kill the thing". Martin said grimly.

We left the Shack shortly after and trekked through the forest until we found a clearing. We were waiting for the pilgrim to show up since he was spotted here a while ago. It took a long time for anything to happen but eventually, as it became almost night. We heard something running towards us. The soldiers aimed their weapons where the sound was coming from and suddenly...

Bryson and Darius came running into the clearing.

I went to speak but Darius cut everyone off with his loud voice.

"The pilgrim is at Yellowstone Volcano. We need to stop it NOW". Darius boomed.

"What is it doing at Yellowstone volcano"?! Martin asked.

I remembered Kyle being dragged off with the Pilgrim, along with the pilgrim attacking the teenagers and dragging them away. 

"What if it's doing some kind of ritual"? I asked.

Jayden and Martin both went pale.

"Well, what are we waiting for"?! Bryson said.

Darius grabbed all of us tightly and ran as fast as he could towards Yellowstone Volcano.

"Bryson-" I went to say but he cut me off.

"Look, Travis, We can talk about this later ok? I made a mistake. And now we need to go stop this THING". He said.

"But what if some of us don't make it out alive-" I asked but was cut off again.

"Nobody is going to die, I promise". He stated.

We were halfway from Yellowstone Volcano when we were interrupted by a group of wendigo's.

"Shit". Martin said.

Bryson took out his gun and fired at the wendigo but they were able to hide behind the nearby trees. I took out Bryson's Desert Eagle and fired a shot into a wendigo's skull, sending it crashing to the ground as it pierced the bony exterior. Darius quickly was swarmed by two other wendigo's and was taking serious damage. We couldn't do anything since we would risk hurting Darius so I grabbed one of the wendigo by it's antlers and pushed it off Darius with immense effort. 

It lunged at me but Jayden came to the rescue and shot the wendigo several times in its head.  Darius was able to finish off the last wendigo by slamming it into the ground, crushing its bones. The rest of the wendigo ran off into the distance.

We quickly got back on track and made our way to Yellowstone Volcano.

As we reached the Caldera, we saw the pilgrim levitating in the middle of Yellowstone Volcano as small tendrils of lava slowly erupted from below.

The soldiers took aim and shot the pilgrim with the plasma rifles. As the plasma bullets got closer to the pilgrim, lava tendrils shielded the pilgrim and reduced the plasma bullets to ash.

"What do we do"?! I asked frantically.

"We need to distract-" Bryson went to say but was cut off as Darius jumped and lunged at the pilgrim at incredible speeds. Though, his efforts were in vain as he was blasted back by the lava tendrils and suffered some burns on his left arm and chest.

"Darius are you ok"?! I said, rushing over to help him up.

"I will be fine, Travis". He winced.

"I've been meaning to ask, How did you find me"? I asked.

"Someone told me where you were. I think they were called..."Ok Shoulder". Darius said.

"Oh, Figures. He told me you found Bryson". I said.

"Guys, focus on the situation at hand". Bryson said, grabbing one of Martin's rifles.

I watched as Martin, Jayden and Bryson shot at the lava tendrils. Tracy was missing though. I looked around and saw her taking photos of the pilgrim nearby. I saw the tendrils creeping up towards her and yelled out to warn her but it was too late. She screamed as she was dragged into the Caldera and disintegrated by the lava tendrils.

Suddenly, A large gust of black smoke erupted from Yellowstone Volcano. We all watched in horror as the tendrils surrounded the pilgrim and started growing. The pilgrim now was atleast 20 feet tall. It had 10 large tendrils made of lava. It was elevated 50 feet above the ground and a large grin was on the pilgrims face.  We had failed to stop it. I looked into the Caldera and to my horror, I saw the teenagers, Kyle, Daniel, Tracy and a bunch of other people. 

Suddenly a tendril slammed into the ground nearby, blasting all of us with an intense heat. 

"FALL BACK"! Martin yelled and led us back through the forest.

I saw some helicopters in the distance. My emergency alert reached the facility but would the reinforcements be able to stop this...Monstrosity? I somehow doubted it.

We reached the motel and we are currently thinking of a new plan. A helicopter just landed nearby. Hopefully the people inside have an idea because at this point. It seems Yellowstone National Park is done for. I feel as if this is my fault. If I didn't fight with Bryson, If I confronted the pilgrim sooner instead of running away like a coward. 

As I type out this post with the phone I stole, I can hear the battle raging outside. Many were going to die because of my mistakes. Maybe I should have just chosen to be in an orphanage, then this would have never happened.

I'll keep you all updated but at this point, we win.....or we lose.
