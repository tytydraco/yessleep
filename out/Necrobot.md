I couldn’t believe it worked, even as I crossed the gangplank from the icebreaker, at last setting foot onto Antarctic soil. Gravel really, mixed with dirty snow. Even the peak of Antarctic Summer hadn’t yet melted the final few traces. A slender white haired woman of perhaps sixty with a tight, smooth face approached, wearing a bright orange parka.  
  
“So you’re the bigshot writer, are ya?” I tugged at the drawstring on my hoodie, trying and failing to maintain eye contact as I turned away from the bitterly cold wind. When she handed me the parka she carried under her arm, I thanked her and eagerly pulled it on. “Bigshot? I don’t know about all that. The artists and writers residency program seemed like the only way I could realistically see Antarctica in person, that’s all.” She smirked. “A tourist, then. I thought as much.”  
  
Her name turned out to be Nora when introductions were made on approach to McMurdo. The impressive compound sat atop the buried foundations of 85 smaller buildings, torn down to make way for the future. It looked the part, too. Lots of metal and glass, something like a cross between a modern college campus and an airport.  
  
“Get a load of all those pampered grad students. They have it easy!” Nora grumbled. “Used to be, walking between buildings during blizzards was a rite of passage. Now you can go anywhere on base in your jammies.” I made a show of paying close attention, picking up on the paradoxical pride she clearly took in her seniority despite also having work done. What a relief it was to be inside, brushing snow off our parkas before doffing the heavy garments and hanging them up by a heater to dry.  
  
Aside from rows of identical parkas, the mud room, or “boots room” as Nora called it, contained racks of walkie talkies on their chargers. So many little LEDs glowing green, orange or red. There were also some first aid kits, megaphones and other assorted equipment I’d never thought about the need for in a place like this. I felt briefly ashamed that my knowledge of McMurdo didn’t extend far beyond the packet I found in my cabin on the ride here.  
  
Sensation slowly returned to my face, at last bathed in warm air. Numb before, now starting to ache. “This is the new guy?” A thin but sturdy black fellow with white tufts at his temples approached. His gray eyes studied me through a pair of bifocals. Nora slapped me on the back. Startled to be touched by a stranger, I took an involuntary step forward. “I could’ve done with my research assistant” Nora groused, “but yes, this is who we got instead. Far be it from me to diminish the importance of the arts.”  
  
After the handoff, Blake apologized for Nora. “She’s one of the old guard. This is her first Summer at the new McMurdo, but she’s wintered over at Amundsen Scott nineteen times.” I did some quick mental math. “Wasn’t it built in ‘08 though? Where was she staying before?” Blake looked surprised. “Did your homework, I see.” I had him fooled at least, if not Nora.  
  
He seemed to hold her in high regard. “Nora’s the real deal, served her time in the dome and everything.” He pointed to a framed photograph on the wall of the geodesic metal dome’s deconstruction in 2010. “She still tells all the male grad students that she’s in her fifties, so don’t let her find out that I told you…but she also worked at the original station. Built in 1957, dismantled during the same summer as the dome. Nora was all torn up about it.”  
  
I couldn’t see why. The first Amundsen Scott Station was a pitiful shack, the dome wasn’t much better, and old McMurdo was a mess to beat them both. By contrast, on our way to the dorms we passed by a lecture hall, vending machines, a cafeteria and a coffee bar. In no way would it be an exaggeration to call this an indoor town, with every amenity I could ask for and some I didn’t think to. What a difference climate funding makes.  
  
We passed through one of the elevated skyways connecting two of the largest sections. Floor to ceiling windows lining both sides of the corridor afforded panoramic views of the barren hellscape outside. I privately wondered how much windows could really do for morale, when that’s the best the view ever gets.  
  
Still, when I set out for Antarctica, the accommodations I envisioned were considerably more austere. Not the rec rooms, not the food selection or huge windows. The dorm we arrived at brought me back down to earth somewhat. Not that it wasn’t equally plush or well apportioned, just that it was roughly the same size as my cabin on the icebreaker.  
  
It had a window at least, and a desk which I availed myself of. With my luggage perched atop it, I unzipped it and lifted the lid, then got busy unpacking. It was the work of half an hour, and not long after I finished, Blake came knocking. “Oh good, you’re settled. Don’t get too comfy, though.” I asked if there was someplace I needed to be. “Not until orientation tomorrow. I just thought I’d invite you for a drink in the-...” His eyes came to rest on my opened luggage, where a battered old copy of “Perpetuum Evergreen” lay nestled among shirts, socks and underwear.  
  
“Vance Dranger, huh? So you’re one of those.” I laughed and shook my head. “No, not even a little bit. My father was, though.” Blake looked relieved. “Was? How did you snap him out of it? All the Drangerites I know are in it for life.” I cleared my throat and looked at the floor. “He…went missing some years ago.” Blake fell silent. “Ah, I see. My apologies.”  
  
I did wind up joining him for a drink. One of the few teetotalers on base, Blake ordered a hot chocolate from the coffee bar. I followed his example, and soon the two of us were seated before immense windows lining the outer wall. For all the desolation, there was at least a view of the seafront, which counted for something. I checked my watch in momentary confusion, wondering why it was still light out before realizing my error.  
  
“What was he like?” I translated the question internally to “what was it like growing up with a Drangerite”, which is usually what people really want to know when they ask about my father. “Obsessed with his own mortality, like the rest of ‘em.” Blake’s eyes softened. “Listen, I didn’t…” I assured him it was okay. “Yes you did, and I don’t blame you. It was losing my mother that did it. I was young and resilient, though I did suffer greatly. Not compared to Dad though, her death absolutely broke him.”  
  
He extended an upturned hand. I left him hanging, as I rarely even hug friends. After a moment he withdrew, instead reaching under the table and producing a copy of my latest novel. “I thought maybe it was something like that. Your protagonists have a habit of losing their mothers.” It caught me off guard. “You’re a fan?” Blake winced. “I’m not sure if fan is the right word. Nobody reads your stuff for pleasure, exactly. Would it kill you to write a happy ending?” We shared some laughter, and the mood lightened.  
  
A strange and exclusive sensation, to sip hot cocoa in Antarctica. Insulated from the ravenous cold by a technological barrier, on a continent which remorselessly consumed the lives of the first pioneers to explore it. Blake vented to me about Dranger and his army of fanboys. Dwindling since the disappearance of their great golden emperor, but still a common and pestilent contingent of the life extension crowd.  
  
“Didn’t one of ‘em attack a colleague in the elevator? At the recent conference? Some nonsense about invisible parasites.” I shrugged and took another sip. “I didn’t hear about that, but I believe you. Even among Drangerites, there’s a relative lunatic fringe.” He chuckled, with an air of smugness. “And for what? At the end of the day, what’s so special about the man? Like clockwork, every few decades some charismatic tech guy with a funny name makes headlines. Nothing new, this world has seen many men like Vance Dranger come and go.”  
  
Preaching to the choir. I didn’t interrupt though, it felt affirming to hear the same thoughts I’ve had many times since Dad disappeared, echoed by a stranger. “Each time they amass their own small army of dazzled followers ready to make excuses for his deficit of humanity, because he’s brilliant. Such men never need to perform a moral inventory, never to self reflect, as nothing in their life forces them to. Many more voices in their ear tell them they’re always right and to ignore the haters, than the opposite. It’s the easiest thing in the world to believe that the friendly, supportive voices are the correct ones.”  
  
I nodded along, ticking the boxes in my head. “Vance Dranger wanted to make an impact” I added, “and for better or worse, he certainly did. You know, Jesus said he came not to bring peace, but a sword. That his followers should expect to make enemies in their own household on account of him, and that only those who chose him over their families were worthy of him. A discomfitingly familiar ultimatum to anyone who’s lost a family member to the Vance Drangers, the L. Ron Hubbards, or the Joseph Smiths of the world.”  
  
Blake tensed up and shifted his posture subtly. “I dunno if that last name belongs in your list. Or Jesus, for that matter. We should take care not to make reckless comparisons when we don’t have all the facts.” I puzzled over it until Blake clarified that he’s a Mormon. It suddenly tracked that he didn’t order anything alcoholic. “Thought you guys couldn’t have hot drinks?” I joked. Still smiling, but now strained, Blake answered that undoubtedly I held many such misconceptions.
