Williamson cave was not a difficult one, all things considered. I had explored caves like it hundreds of times before and so I didn’t consider it much of a challenge. There weren’t many twists and turns, it was pretty stable, and there was no water or gases or anything like that to worry about: it was for beginners.

So, why would I be interested in caving there?

Well, my friend Jack had been down there earlier that week and, while he was exploring, he found an opening that hadn’t been mapped out yet. He told me and, after hearing about it, I was quite excited at the thought of stepping into territory that no other human had before.

He showed me on the map where it was: about 50 metres in, within a small room that you had to climb down to via rope. Maybe Williamson cave had some challenge hidden away.

Well… I guess I can say in hindsight that it did.

Anyway, I was looking forward to it and so was Jack, so that evening we got our equipment ready, made sure it was all in order, and agreed that at first light, we would drive down there and check it out.

 

When we arrived, we parked the car about a five-minute walk away from the cave opening, separated only by the dense woods surrounding it.

I looked over at Jack.

“You’re *already* eating?”

He swallowed the chunk of the energy bar that he had just bitten off. He pointed at the packaging.

“I need energy.”

I chuckled.

*What an idiot.*

I looked back ahead and climbed over a large tree carcass that had fallen in a very inconvenient position – directly over the footpath. It wasn’t that large however and was easy to get over.

“What do you reckon will be down there?” I asked.

“I dunno, hopefully something actually interesting.”

“Watch it be just an immediate dead end,” I laughed.

Jack indicated to the right.

“This way.”

I turned off the path and further into the woods. Above the canopy, I was able to glimpse the top of a large stone cliff ahead of us.

*The entrance must be at the base of that.*

Which was confirmed when we finally saw a gap in the trees and, as I’d thought, the entrance of Williamson cave. Pitch-black - like it ate all the light up.

We stopped right outside the entrance of the cave.

“So, what sort of stuff should I expect then?”

“Well,” Jack said, peering at the map, “it’s a pretty easy crawl from the entrance to the next bit… and then there’s a drop. There should be a rope there already but,” he held a rope up, “we’ve got this.”

*That’s probably for the best. Just in case that rope is decaying.*

We took one last look at the trees behind us, flicked our helmet lights on and stepped inside.

 

I felt the temperature drop almost immediately. No matter how many times I did this, that initial pang never quite went away. I ignored the sensation and focused my attention instead on getting to the drop.

Jack went first; he knew the way better than I did, after all.

The cave wasn’t that sensational – it looked about how I’d expected a beginner one like this one to look. That is, it was just… boring. I hoped that the unexplored area might be a bit more interesting.

It was silent, no sound at all except from our footsteps reverberating around the room. The air was dusty and thick, and I felt a slight tickling in my throat – I coughed it out.

Ahead of us, the room grew smaller until it was just less than a metre high and wide. This must’ve been the crawl space Jack mentioned.

“This way,” I heard him call.

I followed behind him and got down onto all fours. I’d been in tighter spaces before.

Just as we were about to go through, Jack turned around suddenly. He looked at me, like he was expecting me to say or do something.

“What?” I asked.

He didn’t respond, instead, I saw him shrug slightly and turn back towards the tunnel. I dismissed it as well and followed him down.

I chuckled at the thought of this passage being scary or claustrophobic to new, unexperienced cavers.

*Imagine if they knew how bad it* could *be.*

The tunnel was spacious, there were no side-passages and the rock beneath us was smooth and non-threatening.

We cleared the tunnel after a few seconds. I got up, stretched my legs, and then walked back over to Jack.

“This the drop?”

He nodded.

I knelt down and inspected the rope. I gave it a tug – it looked alright. It was still thick and seemed to have no splitting – none near the top, anyway.

“Looks fine. No need to use our one.”

“Alright… you first?”

I chuckled; the drop was only 5 metres or so.

“You scared?”

“N-no, no. I just wanted to-”

“Sure…” I laughed, “sure…”

I sighed, smile still on my face – not on Jack’s – and I clipped my upper and lower ascenders onto the rope.

*Hell, I could probably jump this.*

I released my ascenders from the rope after I’d reached the ground and then waited for Jack to catch up.

“OK – where do we go from here then?” I asked.

“It’s just there.”

At the end of the room, off to the right, was a small passageway. It was about midway up the wall, and about the same size as the crawl space we had gone through at the start of the cave… maybe smaller.

*How would that have appeared?*

I couldn’t see any loose rock, so a collapse was out of the question. I couldn’t think of what it would’ve been. It was weird… it unsettled me slightly – which I couldn’t quite believe. Williamson cave. Worrying *me*.

I pushed it all to the back of my mind and, after Jack, went through into the passageway. Whatever was on the other side, nobody had ever seen before.

 

I could feel it slowly getting smaller. The walls were closing in.

*That’s more like it.*

It was good knowing that the cave might have a little bit of challenge in it. In front of me, I saw Jack turn around once again and give me a quizzical look.

That was the second time he’d done that.

“What?” I said, more stern than last time.

“Uh… nothing.”

I pressed a bit.

“Did you hear something?”

“Uh… yeah. I thought I heard you say something.”

I furrowed my brow.

“It sounded like you were calling my name or something,” he continued.

“I didn’t say anything.”

“Well… yeah. It was probably nothing, anyway.”

We both resumed our journey. I noticed that the walls were beginning to get moister, the ground less smooth. That must mean that there was a river or some kind of body of water nearby. I hoped that the water wouldn’t be on the cave path directly because if it was, that would cause all manner of issues.

My thoughts were interrupted when Jack stopped and called out.

“There’s a turn here!”

He shuffled forwards a bit, and after going around the bend, I could hear his voice echo down the tunnel towards me.

“Hey! There’s a room here, too! You gotta take a look at this!”

I was intrigued. Whatever it was, it was enough to get Jack excited, which I know isn’t a difficult thing to do, but maybe it was something. I dunno – whatever it was, my hopes started to rise too.

“What does it look like?” I called.

He had gone completely past the bend now, and must have left the tunnel into this larger room because I could see the tunnel around me brighten a bit, light able to make its way in.

I picked up my pace and turned round that corner too and… well, let’s just say that Jack had a reason to be excited.

I stepped out and looked around.

It was incredible.

 

The entire room – chamber, really, was sparkling, practically glowing. All around us were gemstones, metals, crystals, slicked wet. A stream separated it in two, although it was shallow and easily crossable.

I started laughing. It started off as a small chuckle, and then went into full on laughter.

*I’m rich. I’m fucking rich.*

I figured that a fraction of this stuff would easily be worth millions.

Jack waded through the stream in front of me and went up to a uniquely large and radiant crystal.

“You see this, Alfie?”

“Yeah,” I said, still laughing, “Yeah I do.”

I walked over to the stream and placed my dusty hands inside. It was cold and refreshing. Clear and inviting. I think I almost ended up cupping some in my hands and drinking before I remembered that we’d packed bottled water, and I chose that instead because it was probably safer.

I felt oddly thirsty.

*Wouldn’t water like this be dirty if it was running underground?*

This cave was dusty, it didn’t really make sense why it would be this clean…

As I went to grab the bottle out, I noticed my hands felt oddly… tingly. Like pins and needles.

*They were in a weird angle while I was in that passage,* I remembered.

I brushed them hard a few times against my coat. That seemed to wake them up a bit.

“Hey Alfie!” Jack called, “There’s another tunnel here!”

That… didn’t sound right. I didn’t remember seeing any other passages when we had first entered. Maybe I missed it.

But that detail nagged at me.

“Jack maybe don’t…”

I looked up, and I could only see Jack’s feet disappearing into the passageway.

He was always impulsive, but this wasn’t how he usually acted. He’d always ask me for my approval. He’d at least give me a look.

I sighed and went through the stream at the shallow end, the water not making it past my boots.

“Is there anything in there, anyway?”

I could hear his muffled voice down the passage.

*“Yeah, you gotta see it Alfie! There's so many gems to touch and so much water to drink!”*

“What are you on about?” I called into the passage.

But Jack didn’t respond. I sighed and stood with my back against the wall near the opening that he had gone through.

It was here that I started to ask questions:

*Was that passage there before?*

*Why was Jack saying that?*

*Why did Jack’s voice sound deep and raspy?*

I looked suspiciously at my surroundings. Gems never formed like this. Not this concentrated… not this perfectly shiny. It didn’t look quite right. And, now that I thought about it, I could hear a weird hum in the thick air around me.

I got sick of waiting for Jack to call back so I shouted again.

“Jack! Get back over here! C’mon!”

But there was again no response. I was getting worried now. Out of options, I took a deep breath and reluctantly went down the passageway.

 

I could hear a rhythmic thumping sound as I crawled through. The passage wasn’t high enough to be able to rest on my elbows, so I was crawling on my stomach, head turned sideways - I guess I got the claustrophobic passageway I wanted.

It was odd. I couldn’t see any gemstones down here, or any water, so what Jack was going on about just then didn’t make any sense to me. He’d said that… what - ten seconds after entering? And here I was, a solid minute or two into the passage.

Although my head was sideways, I was able to move it enough to see directly in front of me, my headlamp illuminating the passage ahead.

I could see Jack’s feet.

I breathed a sigh of relief and, picking up the pace, pulled myself as fast as I could over to him.

There wasn’t much room around my chest to let me speak, but I still tried.

“Jack,” I rasped, “come on, let’s go back. This place is creeping me out.”

Jack again, didn’t respond.

“Jack?”

I went to grab his left foot, get a physical reaction out of him, and was surprised when his foot went with my hand easily, with no resistance. His other foot was still in the same place.

I frowned and looked down at the foot in my left hand.

 

It was stump. Cut clean off, like with a knife.

My stomach lurched. I swallowed and dropped it. I reached out with my right hand for the other one… same thing.

I blinked hard. It was cut just above his ankle, then above that was a bit of bone sticking out, and a lot of blood. It trailed off ahead in front of me, into the darkness.

I started shuffling backwards as quickly as I could. I didn’t care about getting Jack back – whatever happened, I didn’t reckon there was any hope of saving him.

My heart thumped hard and quick as I hurried out of the tunnel. When I went back out into the room, I stumbled backwards, through the river, and sat, with my back against the wall.

My entire lower end had gotten wet, including my hands again. I didn’t really care, I wanted to just get out of there as quickly as I could.

I went to move out into the passageway just behind me, but I found that my legs weren’t responding. I frowned and tried again. My legs and lower arms weren’t moving when I wanted them to – they were useless now. I tried to rock myself back and forth, but I wasn’t making tangible progress. I was just flopping around.

*The limbs I can’t move are the wet ones.*

I eyed the water again. One part of me wanted to get as far away from here as possible, another wanted to bathe in that lovely, clean water. So inviting.

I squeezed my eyes shut and looked the other way. My entire lower body was numb now, as I felt the water seep deep down into my skin.

I’m not sure how long I stayed there for. Maybe it was a minute, maybe an hour. All I knew was that I was feeling very thirsty again.

My mind turned back to the stream right next to me, but I didn’t dare look. My eyes were squeezed shut.

God, my throat stung.

I tried swallowing, but I found that it made it hurt more, so I gave up, coughing into the dusty air. I genuinely thought I was going to die, but I never thought it would be like this.

I was maybe at my worst when I heard it, calling.

*“Alfie…”*

It was in Jack’s voice, which I knew was impossible, and was in the same deep tone that I’d heard earlier.

*“Alfie, there’s a passage next to you. If you rock yourself back and forth, you can go down it. Please trust me.”*

I didn’t, but I would be lying if I said I wasn’t at least curious.

I opened one eye and peered around.

*“Yes, to your left.”*

I looked and, sure enough, a new passageway had opened. It headed down deeper, and I could see it pulsating. Reminded me of an intestine.

“Go… to hell,” I managed to croak.

*“It leads to the surface Alfie. I’m up there right now. Eating energy bars. I need energy.”*

I looked again. The passage clearly headed down.

I decided that whatever it said, I wouldn’t listen. The thought of Jack’s two stumps filled my mind. I’d rather die of dehydration than end up like that.

I think that whatever was in the cave figured this out too, as it finally stopped talking to me, and I could hear the passageway on my left slowly closing – a gross, squelchy sound.

All I could hear was silence from then on. Although when I strained to listen, I could almost hear what sounded like a heartbeat... but it could easily have been mine - I couldn’t honestly tell.

I was coughing almost every time I drew a breath. I felt like shit. I still held onto the hope that *someone* would come back down here to come and get me, although I wasn’t sure if this cave wouldn’t make them into food as well.

 

However, to my surprise, I woke up from a deep sleep hearing voices down the entrance passage: multiple people.

I tried to call out, but my voice didn’t work anymore. I tried to make a sound, but I remembered my limbs. I just had to lie there and hope that they would find me. The path was linear at least, I had some hope.

I drifted in and out of consciousness a bit, but I was awake when the rescue team came in. I could faintly hear their voices, even though they were stood in front of me. I think there were four of them, maybe five.

*“His limbs… swollen… rash? You stay here… I’ll… out.”*

I felt myself get lifted, and pulled out of the cave, back through the passage.

The last thing I saw, while getting dragged back through the passage, before I went unconscious was two of the rescue team members in the large room, washing their face with the water, smiling and then going into a side passage that I knew for a fact wasn’t there before.

And, as my eyes closed, I swear that I could hear the cave laughing.
