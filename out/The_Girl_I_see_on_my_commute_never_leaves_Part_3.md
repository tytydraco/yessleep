I sat at my desk, holding Julia’s horse toy. Not only can I see the spirits on the train, but I can also take their possessions into the physical world. Well, I had my doubts if it was actually physical or just something only I can see. Just then, my mom walked in. 

“Hey sweetie, just wanted to see if you- are you playing with a horse toy?”

She could see it. She could actually see it. If this is really something I can do, this changes everything. This puts me one step closer to solving everyone’s mysteries. 

“Yeah- I mean no. I mean, it’s…just one of my friends’ little sister’s toy. She asked me to hold on to it and I forgot to give it back.”

“Huh. That actually looks very…familiar.”

She concentrated on the toy for a second, a sense of familiarity spreading across her face. It wasn’t until after a few seconds her face perked. 

“Yeah, I know this toy. Back in the 80’s, there was this company that made a bunch of animal toys, the ones with the horses were the most popular. One year, they were declaring bankruptcy, but had a misprint on some of their horse toys during their final sales, making them pure white instead of pink. I wanted one so bad as a kid, but many got recalled, so it’s a pretty rare find. Probably worth nothing now, who knows?”

My back straightened as I spoke a bit too excitedly. “Do you remember the name of the company, by any chance?”

She raised an eyebrow, cracking half a smile. “Why so curious?”

“Just…wondering.” I tried to shape the most inconspicuous smile possible on my face. 

“Ok then, yeah. I believe it was called…PonyCo.”

It was the dumbest name I’ve ever heard for a company and I loved it. It was my first clue. I dove into my laptop and searched up everything I could find out about this company. Just like mom said, it was a toy company in the early 70s and 80s that made a bunch of animal toys, but their main focus was on the horse toys. It took some deep research, but as for the misprint, there were only 9 that had the mistake, but only 1 was able to publicly get out before it was recalled. That had to have been Julia’s toy. It was won in an auction from her family, Dave and Carly Bloom. They were pretty respected aristocrats from a long line of inheritance, entrepreneurs in nature. Funny thing is, these two were often trying to live like normal middle class citizens, even being seen roaming about in public from time to time like they had no reputation. A very odd couple indeed, but I’m sure they had their reasons. They also kept a pretty private personal life, several articles I saw were the authors *theorizing* they had a daughter. I’m not sure why they would hide such a thing, who wouldn’t want to know who’d be next in line in the will? So they definitely bought the toy, but no concrete proof that it was for Julia. Now there was no choice but to go to the source. 

I looked into the family more, turns out their lives took a dark turn. They were mugged in the subway late in the night, and the thug emptied his revolver into the couple. Carly died almost instantly, but Dave managed to survive. Still, according to the articles, there was no sign of a daughter. Dave managed to recover somewhat well physically, but he was mentally destroyed. After some more digging, I found out he was spotted being transferred from hospital to hospital, until he was eventually settled in a hospice in the middle of Manhattan. If I could see him, and get him to confirm he had a daughter, I might have enough to help Julia remember something. I grabbed her horse toy and hopped on the first train there after school, I made some excuse that I was in a late night study group. I hated lying but these are desperate times, God knows I was running out of time. It took a few transfers but I got there. I even ended up on the 7 train and got to talk to Zoe for a bit. Before I left though, I wanted to try something. When it was time for me to get off, I grabbed her hand and tried to pull her out too. I figured if I could take objects out of the train and make them physical, I could probably do the same with her and maybe the others too. Unfortunately, it was like trying to push something through a force field, she just couldn’t get past those doors. We tried on almost every stop. I know I must have looked crazy, but in my city everyone looks crazy at least a few times a week. 

“Isaac, people are staring at you.” 

I kept trying to push her out, my stubbornness shining all the way through. “Hang on, if I can just-“

“Isaac, just…stop. It’s obviously not working.”

I sighed in defeat and slumped down in the nearby seat. I still have the phone to my ear, not like it’s gonna fool the Thin Man, but more so to avoid looking like I’m schizophrenic, which doesn’t seem too possible what with the stunt I pulled.
“Sorry, I really thought that would work.”

“Don’t beat yourself up, at least you tried.”

“Hopefully Julia won’t mind me using her toy for a bit.”

“Don’t worry, we’re keeping her entertained. She’s pretending to princess and Percy is the dragon protecting her. Even Dex is playing along, and he never does anything.”

“We? So, you’ve been seeing the others more? That’s good.”
 
“Sometimes. I still prefer being alone. Well, mostly.”

I could see her blush while looking at her feet. Although I wish these moments could’ve been under better circumstances, I’m glad I got to spend it with her. 

“You really think you’ll find something at this hospice?”

“I hope so, but don’t tell Julia anything yet. I wanna be sure of what I’m trying to figure out.”

“Yeah, of course. You know, she talks about you, like a lot.”

“Really? We’ve only met once?”

“Well, she thinks you’re super nice and fun to be around. And I think she wants you to be the knight who saves her next time.

That warmed my heart. We’ve known each other for so little time and yet she sees some good in me. It’ll be a bit bittersweet to say goodbye when this is over, but I’ll have to think about that at a different time. When my stop had arrived, I moved along with the current of people squeezing out of the doors. I turned back to Zoe, who was giving me a worried look. 

“Be careful. You never know who’s watching.”

__________

I walked up the small steps to the hospice, as odd as it made me feel. It looked fancy yet very homely at the same time. It was a three story building, cream colored all the way around. Once inside, I leaned over the front desk, the lady clearly disillusioned from anything happening around her. 

“Hello, I’m here to see Dave Bloom.”

The receptionist looked up at me with raised eyes, clearly wondering what someone like me wanted with such an old guy. 

“You family?”

“Yes. Well, actually a family friend. My great uncle wanted me to see how he was doing, and I haven’t seen him since I was a toddler, so this is pretty big moment for me.”

She sighed, handing me a clipboard of a bunch of names to sign in next to. It’s a good thing this woman was pretty uncaring otherwise this might’ve been a bit harder. 

“He’s in Room 317, top floor. It’s good you came when you did, he’s not doing so well. I’m not sure if you know this, but he was shot almost to the brink of death. By the time help arrived, he was crawling for his life, dragging his wife’s body. They removed all of the bullets, but it seems like the leftover lead is catching up to him. Not to mention, his memory goes in and out. Just be gentle, kid.”

I took the elevator up to the top, each sound reminding me I’m one step closer to getting some answers. If this guy can confirm Julia is his daughter, maybe I’ll have something to jog her memory. I walked on the side of the hall, past each increasing number of the room until I got to 317. I took a breath and knocked on the door as I opened it, peeking in to slowly take in what I was seeing.

The room was cozy, a dark green palette covered the walls with a walnut brown accent coating the floors. All I could hear was the incessant beeping of the machines keeping this man alive. I’ve heard of life support, and seen it in movies. But it’s a much different feeling when it’s real, and right in front of you. 

“Dave? Dave Bloom?”

The man old entrepreneur reclined in his bed looked up at me, his face exhausted and his eyes seemed to be in a place in which joy was lost decades ago. 

“Do I know you?”

His voice was slow, with such a deep tone. It wasn’t one of bitterness, but rather one of being content in disappointment. 

“I’m…a family friend.”

“Friends? Please. They were all fake. They were all vipers, just wanting to slip into my life and take everything. The only thing real was my family.”

I sat down in the chair next to his bed, hunched over towards him to show my full attention. 

“Your family means a lot to you, don’t they?”

“I never wanted that inheritance. I never wanted the riches. When you have it all, you realize how little it compares to true, unconditional love. She loved me. Before anything, she really loved me.”

“Your wife? Do you mean your wife, Dave?”

“Yes…what was her name? I can’t…I don’t…”

“Carly, her name was Carly, right? Can you remember?”

“Yes, my sweet Carly. She became more beautiful every passing day. She..paints, did you know that? She paints the most wonderful summer landscapes. She sang to me when I had night terrors or the nights I couldn’t fall asleep at all. She has eyes so blue, it would make the ocean jealous. God, I miss her…do I know you?”

“No, but I know you, Dave. I just want to know about your family. Can you tell me more about them?”

“My family? Yes…I had a family, didn’t I?

“Yes, you had a daughter right? Do you remember her name?”

This was something he had to remember on his own, it’s the only way to prove Julia was really his daughter, and not some false memory I accidentally implanted. 

“Daughter? I had a daughter?”

“Yes, your daughter, Dave! So many people suspected you had a daughter but never made it public. What was her name? You have to remember her name!”

“I don’t…was she…do I know you?”

He moved his eyes back up to the ceiling. It was honestly heartbreaking to see his memory flickering like that. All he wanted was his family, and he was stuck here in this mental prison. Just a constant loop where all he had were memories, constantly thrown back and forth from his grasp. Could he even remember Julia? Then I remembered- her toy. I pulled out the small horse and held it out for Dave to see. 

“This is her toy, you got it for her. She loved horses and you got it for her.” I put the toy in his open hand. My breathing became less steady, I felt myself choking up. Julia was counting on me, and this was my last chance to help her. “You have to remember, Dave. This belongs to your daughter, remember her name. Please, please remember. She needs you to remember.”

The silence was deafening, only the sound of our heavy breaths filling the room. I hung my head in disappointment, nothing was going to bring back his memory. I failed. I failed Julia, and if I can’t help her, then I can’t help Zoe or Claire, Dex, Percy. I failed myself. It’s time I accepted that we’re all doomed. 

“J-Julia…”

I felt his hand close up around the toy. I looked up and saw a weak smile on his face. He said her name. He remembers. He shifts his focus from the toy back to me. 

“Julia is my daughter. My sweet princess. When she was born, I felt what love was all over again. My life was filled with deception and insincerity, but Carly and Julia were real. I didn’t want my life to publicize her, put her in headlines or have people judge her like they did me. So I hid her, and kept her a secret for years so she could have a normal life. I sat in an auction for 3 hours and got this toy because I knew she would love it. I knew it would make her happy, and that’s all I wanted more than anything in the world. That’s when the people began to talk, that I had a secret daughter to give the toy to. There were so many theories and articles, but I lied to them. I made excuse after excuse, said that I was ‘getting a collectible item’ or ‘bidding simply for the fun of it’, but it was for her. Everything I did was for her, and I love her so much. Where is she? Where’s my daughter?”

I could see his heart rate speeding up through the monitor. I wanted to get help, but I was frozen in time. I don’t know why, but I just let it happen. Maybe I’m a horrible person, but he was suffering. I could tell by the tears rolling down his face, he just wanted to be free. He just wanted his family, and hated life being wrung out of him without them by his side. The constant beeping became faster as his breathing slowed more than I ever seen on person. 

“Where is my daughter? Where is my wife? Will I see them soon?”

His heart rate was pulsing like a jackhammer. I could barely keep myself from crumbling, but I managed to hold a somewhat comforting smile as I saw him close his eyes. 

“Yes. I’m sure you’ll see them soon.”

“That’s…wonderful. I can’t wait.”

His grip on the toy softened until it went limp, and the beeping turned into one singular note. The entire Bloom family was officially wiped from this earth. I stepped into the hallway, holding Julia’s toy. I never met this man before today, but now I took a look inside his life and saw not a an entrepreneur or an aristocrat, but man. A father who loved his life and it was cruelly taken from him. But my job here was done, Dave has gotten his closure and now I can use what I know to help Julia.

“He’s gone, isn’t he?”

I looked up from my hand holding this small horse to see young blond woman in nurses outfit. She looked to be in her early 30s at the least. I wasn’t sure how to tell her how I basically let a man die. I could’ve called for a nurse, or at least someone to help, but I did nothing. I let him flatline with barely a second thought. 

“I’m sorry- I just…I didn’t know what to do. By the time I processed what was happening, it seemed too late. I know I probably should have called, but I froze-“

“It’s quite alright. He was bound to go at some point. These things happen.”

It was odd how nonchalant this woman was being. I know she’s a nurse who’s probably seen this a thousand times but I’d expect a little comforting conversation considering it only happened a few minutes ago. Not to mention she wasn’t even calling in any doctor or staff for assistance. 

“It’s a shame. Truly a shame.”

“Y-yeah. He was a good man-“

“I wasn’t talking about him. His soul was a waste. I meant it’s a shame you won’t be able to make it back to that little girl on the train.”

“What? How did you-?”

My breath ran cold, I could see it cover her face as I felt a million goosebumps spreading around my skin. Just like that, I was freezing. My entire body shook as I saw the woman’s eyes stretch to the top of her forehead. Her corneas began to foam as her jaw unhinged down to her chest, every inch of her mouth cracking to reveal several rows of tiny, jagged teeth. Her skin became baggy and grey, and her kneecaps twisted to opposite sides. Her sides bubbled and boiled until it sprouted 2 more grotesque arms, then 4, then six. The transformation reminded of the Thin Man, but this was something different entirely. This was one of his “friends”. 

“Didn’t he mention? We *all* can see you.”

For the first time, my feet moved before my body could even think. As I’m sprinting down the hall, every fiber in my being is screaming at me not to look back, but somehow I do it anyway. In my peripherals, I could see her jump perfectly to the ceiling and begin to crawl on it like an arachnid freak show. But unlike a spider, her movement was anything but slow. One claw after the other, she sped up to me, each limb propelling her closer to me. I drifted around the corner to the elevator, my ticket to freedom, until a felt a sharp breeze above my head. She launched herself from the ceiling to the elevator door before I could reach it. 

I almost slipped trying to stop myself in my tracks, but that didn’t stop me from locking eyes with her. She screamed towards me, but it sounded more like a hundred high pitched hisses layered with low pitched laughter. I darted to the stairs, quickly realizing that maybe the elevator wouldn’t have been a good idea, especially if I got stuck. I just knew I had to keep moving. I jumped from stair to stair with this new monster right on the edge of grabbing me. Every time I turned the corner of the spiraled steps, I saw her bounce from wall to wall, careening toward me. She was a relentless beast who couldn’t help but pursue me. It was as frightening as the Thin Man, but least he didn’t chase me like this. 

I burst through the door to the bottom floor, but couldn’t stop myself from tripping over my own feet. I turned my body to see the once kind looking nurse now turned monster peering under the door frame, her eyes still dripping a disgusting foam and her face wearing a toothy grin. She was almost literally laughing her head off, reaching for me, until-

“Kid? Kid, are you alright?”

It was the lady at the front desk, seeing my obvious distress. I looked back at the door, and the creature was gone. Slipped away from my sight, without even a trace of her presence. I almost got taken by another one of those twisted souls, and I didn’t know if it was just toying with me or if I was actually fast enough to evade it. I was so shook from the past few moments, I didn’t even bother to dust myself off as I got on my feet. 

“You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

“Yeah, something like that. By the way, you might want to check room 317, I’m not sure he’s doing so well.”

I somehow seethed a chuckle at her ironically funny observation. However, I slung my bag over my shoulder and brushed past her, as I was still in no mood to stick around longer than I had to. 

On the connecting trains back I had the headspace to really try and comprehend what I just saw. I had watched a man die slowly, recounting his life and his pain, but somehow still found beauty in it all. Not even a few moments later, I was stalked and chased by another corrupted soul. This terrified me, I had more eyes on me than I thought. They could be anywhere, and they could be capable of anything. I only had a few days left, and this just put me more on edge than I thought possible. 

“Hey, you ok? You look…traumatized.”

Zoe caught me off guard, I didn’t even realize I stepped onto the last train before home. I mean she wasn’t far off, so I told her everything. I’ve never seen anyone try to comfort me as much as she did, but what can you really say in a unique situation like this? She grabbed my hand and led me to the back car, saying that everyone was waiting for me. She was right, all the inhabitants seemed very happy to see me, all except Dex, who seemed indifferent as usual. Julia was the first to greet me with a hug. 

“Hiya mister! You came back for us!”

“Yeah I did. I said I would, and I’m here.”

“Now that you’re here, do you wanna play princess tower with me?”

“Oh, I don’t know-“

“Pleeeassee? Zoe said you would.”

I glanced back at Zoe, who responded with an embarrassed but guilty smile. I reluctantly agreed, not wanting to break her promise. 

“Yay! Ok, so I’m the princess, -obviously- Mr. Percy is the dragon, Ms. Claire is my lady in waiting, and Dex is-“

“You can actually count me out of this one.” Dex had his arms crossed, staring at his feet. He clearly had enough of playing whatever games Julia wanted. But she walked up to him and put on the biggest pouty face I’ve ever seen on a child. Between the big eyes and the soft tone of her voice, he couldn’t resist more than few seconds. Dex had succumbed to his role of being the other dragon. As a knight, I had had to ride through blistering winds and scorching deserts, climbed to the highest room in the tallest tower, you know how it goes. After saving the princess and lady in waiting, I had to slay the twin dragons to protect them. When they lay defeated on the floor, I knew I had won, and what a mighty knight I was. The car erupted with laughter, to a passerby it would look like I’m laughing with myself, but even if so, I didn’t care. Just then, my pocket began to glow. 

It was as if a flashlight was turned on inside of my jacket, but inspecting closer, it was the horse toy, emitting a strange glow. I kneeled down in front of Julia and held it out to her, as she stared in disbelief. 

“My…my toy.”

“Yeah. I think this is supposed to help you now. You ready.”

She nodded as she placed her hand on the toy, both resting on my hand. Suddenly, the toy began to began to shine brighter and brighter until we couldn’t see anything around us for a few seconds, it was like being hit with a flashbang grenade. When our sight came back, we saw the train had reached the next stop, except when the doors opened, everything was a white void. 

Julia held out her hand, and I took it. As everyone watched, we stepped to edge of the doors, then outside of it. Both of us were outside of the train. As we both looked around the white void, I could hear Julia sniffling through a few tears. 

“I remember now.”

The void faded from a bright white to grayscale scene, like something out of a vintage movie. I saw a couple…and their daughter. It was the Blooms, and they were taking a happy stroll through the subway. The pure joy on each face, it was a love that grew stronger with every day. The smiles on their faces faded when a hooded man rushed up to them with a revolver. I couldn’t hear what they were saying, it sounded like they were underwater. But I could tell how scared they were. The father seemed to be compliant, until he tried to be hero and reach for the gun. They struggled for a few seconds, until the hooded man overpowered him and emptied the chamber into the family, excluding the daughter, who ran and grabbed his arm to stop him. Annoyed, the man shoved the girl off of him, causing her to stumble and fall on to the nearby tracks. If the fall didn’t kill her, it would definitely be the oncoming train, with its headlights a blinding farewell. 

The scene shifted back into the white void. Before I can even empathize with the little girl, I see a couple running hand in hand towards us. They were calling out to her, the woman waving her free hand to get her attention. They stopped a few feet in front of us, and I could see them clearly now. It was Dave and Carly Bloom, looking for their daughter. They both looked younger, especially Dave, matching their counterparts in Julia’s memories. Their faces were filled with that same joy, longing for something they lost a long time ago, but now they’ve found.

I handed Julia back her toy, urging her to go to her parents. She turned and gave me a hug. 

“I’m gonna miss you, Mister. Thanks for saving me like the brave knight you are.”

“Take care, Julia.”

She ran forward as Dave scooped her up into a hug, and the three embraced for a minute. Dave turned to me, the same tears running from his eyes from when he lay in bed in that hospice. 

“Thank you. Thank you so much.”

The Bloom family walked away hand in hand, continuing their stroll in to the void until they were nowhere to be seen. They were finally together again. 

I looked back to see the train still in view, and I rushed back, as I didn’t want to be left behind somehow. As I entered and the doors closed, we began moving as usual. Only a few more stops until my home. Everyone was bewildered at what we all witnessed. Out of all us, though, Percy was breathing incredibly heavy. 

“It’s possible. It’s actually possible to be free. How’d you do it?”

“Apparently I can take whatever item to have on the train, whatever means a lot to you I guess, and I can take it in the physical world. It’s all powered through memories.”

“That makes sense, none of us can remember our lives. Here, take my coin. I can never put this thing down, so it must be important.”

Percy stopped fiddling with his coin and dropped it in my hand. Claire was next to speak up. She reached around her neck and pulled off a hidden necklace with a single blue pearl in the center. 

“Hopefully this is something. I pray you can help me remember.”

Dex reached to his leather jacket and pulled off a pin, it was the only one he had that some words on it: “The Dead Rabbit”. It was in big purple letters with a rabbit logo with flies surrounding it. 

“This better work, or else.” 

His tone sounded threatening but his eyes looked desperate. Next was Zoe, hopefully holding the key to her freedom. But as she looked at us, her face went as dark as the day we first met. 

“I don’t have *anything*.”
