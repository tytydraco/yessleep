When my grandparents passed away, we were all given different heirlooms mentioned in the will—jewelry, tools, family albums. Nobody wanted this old painting that used to hang in their dining room. It wasn’t creepy or anything, just... overlooked. A pastoral scene of grassland and trees. A partly cloudy sky. And in the center of the canvas, an old stone well.

I had just moved into a new apartment, so I figured, why not? I hung it on the living room wall—just to the left of the TV. It matched the aesthetic. The frame was ornate and gold. The kind you don’t see anymore.

The painter’s name was European. I forget the spelling, but the back of the canvas had a handwritten dedication: For Delilah – So you never forget where you came from. That was my grandmother’s name.

At first, it was just... peaceful. Birds in the trees, wildflowers in the field, the faint impression of a breeze. But within a week, I started to notice subtle shifts. Like the clouds were getting darker. Or the well was... bigger? I kept telling myself it was just my imagination, maybe different lighting, or a trick of the eye. But I’d glance over mid-movie, thinking something had moved. Like static in the corner of your eye.

After a few weeks, I started feeling watched. Not by a person, exactly—just a presence. A kind of gravity pulling my attention toward the canvas.

One night, I got up for water and walked straight toward it, almost in a daze. I don’t know how long I stood there, staring. I remember it being so quiet, the kind of stillness where you can hear your heartbeat in your ears. Then I noticed the faint chirping of birds. I looked out the window. Dawn was coming. I’d been standing there all night.

But there was something new in the painting. A black smear in the distance, standing just beyond the well. A small, shadowy figure. It was so faint I couldn’t tell if it had always been there. Maybe I’d missed it?

Over the next few weeks, it kept getting closer. Just barely. A pixel shift here and there. At first, I chalked it up to paranoia. I even measured the damn thing—counted the distance between the well and the shadow with a ruler. I swear it moved. But I didn’t say anything to anyone. I knew how it sounded.

Then the dream started.

I was standing at the edge of the well. Looking down into it. The water churned violently, like something massive was about to erupt from below. It wasn’t natural—it looked like it had a motor, like some industrial turbine was spinning just beneath the surface. My knees buckled, and I felt myself being pulled in. One foot lifted against my will. I wanted to scream but couldn’t. That’s when I woke up, drenched in sweat.

I went to get water again. My hand was shaking so badly I dropped the glass, and it shattered. But I wasn’t even looking at the floor—I was staring at the painting.

The well was gone.

Just gone. No hole, no stone, no shadow. Just grass and sky. As if it had never been there. I blinked so many times my eyes hurt. I even ran my hand across the surface of the canvas, like I expected to feel a dent or paint texture. Nothing.

I tore it down and stored it in the hallway closet behind some boxes. That night, I couldn’t sleep. My head was ringing with static. It felt like I’d left something unfinished. Like a thread was tugging at the base of my skull.

Two weeks later, I took time off work and left the city. I told everyone I was burned out, needed a break. I didn’t tell them about the nightmares. About the way I’d started sleepwalking. Or that I’d woken up three nights in a row with soil under my fingernails.

I found this quiet cottage rental deep in the countryside. No neighbors. Just trees and birds and the sound of the wind. The kind of place you’d see on a postcard or in a dream.

I’ve been here a while now, I think. The days blend together. I don’t remember booking this trip. I don’t remember the drive. I just remember... being here.

Sometimes I stand outside and look at the field behind the cottage. There’s a well out there. Just like in the painting. Same trees. Same slant of sunlight. It’s all so familiar.

And tonight—it hit me.

I can’t remember how I got here.

I don’t remember what I ate yesterday. Or what day it is. I haven’t seen the stars in weeks. The night never seems to come. The sun just loops overhead. A low, golden hour that never fades.

I try to walk away from the well but I end up circling back. My body isn’t mine anymore. I don’t speak. I don’t sleep. I only stand. Like I’m waiting for something. Or someone.

Maybe you’ve seen me.

Maybe you have the painting.

Maybe I’m almost close enough for you to notice the figure standing near the well—just a blur in the background. A shadow that wasn’t there before.

I regret storing it away. I didn’t know what I was doing. I didn’t know I was about to trap myself inside it forever. I thought I was just cleaning up.

I think I’m almost visible now.

Please. If this post reaches anyone—if these words are somehow escaping the canvas—go to my apartment. Open the closet. Pull the painting out. Hang it back up.

Set me free.

I think I’m getting closer.

I think you’re starting to see me.

Just like I once did… standing too long in front of that old canvas, staring at the distant shape no one else noticed. Someone was waiting then—trapped—until I took their place.

And now I wait, too.

I only need one more glance. One more moment of obsession.

One more person to notice me by the well.

Then, maybe, I can leave.
