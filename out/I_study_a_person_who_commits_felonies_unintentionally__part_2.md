My name is Donovan Jess, and this is my work journal on the events surrounding Victoria. The reason I am posting this is via her request. So I will explain everything that happens in the time she spends with us. It is currently 9 pm on November 16th, and I will continue to give updates as the days move on.

**November 16th - 10 pm**

Victoria has been very cooperative with us for the time she has been here. We give her the amount of food we give everyone else (Usually a loaf of bread, a spoonful of rice, and some pork chops with peas), and she does not complain about her serving sizes.

Victoria is reasonably polite. Aside from a few speeding tickets, she has had a clean record and seems like any normal person.

She spent the better half of the day walking around the room. Her mood seems to reflect boredom (I do not blame her.) As I write this, she is currently looking at the two-way mirror, making goofy expressions and drawing smiley faces in the clouded areas created by her breath. I do not understand how she was able to kill people.

The police never told her how bad the bodies looked, so I will say it now. Two victims had their arms ripped from the sockets, not cut, but forcibly ripped. Five others had holes that passed straight through their bodies and appeared made from shotput ball-sized objects. Ten others were mutilated beyond recognition, having their skulls caved in and their faces warped horrifically. The last eight were found in the river, scattered over a five-kilometre stretch in several pieces.

**November 17th - 12 am**

Victoria seems to be trying to contact someone; we believe it is her father. When she was first brought in and asked what had happened, she said her late father had called her. According to her, their conversation lasted for four hours, but once she was finished and looked at the clock, it was the next day.

The weird thing about her trying to reach her father is that she knows he's dead. We pulled up his records, and the man was cremated. We saw pictures and even saw the urn at her mother's place. He is deceased, yet she is still desperately trying to contact him. It is bizarre and honestly kind of sad. It seems she is attempting to hold onto any ounce of hope. I personally do not blame her. This is a fucked situation; I feel bad for her if she is who she appears to be.

**November 17th - 12:30 am**

Her phone rang, and you would not believe who it was. Through the cameras, we could see that she answered a call from her father. She started talking, asking him if he could get her a lawyer. Her reaction to whatever the answer was did not help us figure out what he said. She remained happy, smiling ear to ear as if she was talking to an old friend (or a dead father.)

She continued chatting for a solid thirty minutes before she stopped talking abruptly. The phone fell from her hand as she stood completely still. Her eyes are tearing up because she is no longer blinking. She has remained in this catatonic state for roughly thirty minutes.

As of writing this, she has begun to move and look around as if lost. She started calling out, asking where she was, asking why the door was locked. She seems to be getting aggravated and unresponsive to the answers given over the intercom. We will continue to watch and monitor her, but I can only assume she will become increasingly distressed.

**November 17th - 8 am**

I was correct in my assumption.

She initially was screaming for us to let her out, which we didn't. Then she began to punch the walls. They have foam padding so the occupant can't hurt themselves, but she pounded very hard. It could honestly be felt from the observation room where I am sitting. It was kind of terrifying. She then turned to the mirror and started punching it until her fists bled. The mirror is reinforced, so it is impossible to shatter without the right tool, but that didn't stop her from leaving scratches and dents.

Her strength has increased tremendously, like she is a different person. Her mannerisms have changed as well. Before, she seemed inseparable from her phone; now, it is on the ground across the room. Even now, as she continues to scream, it doesn't feel like I am looking at the same person I initially saw go into this room.

She kept shouting and demanding an audience, with her voice sounding hatred. I talked over the intercom, telling her to calm down and take a seat. In response, she threw her phone at the mirror, cracking the glass lightly and staring directly at me as if she could see me through the mirror. I am someone who doesn't get afraid too quickly, but this honestly scared the hell out of me. Looking into the previously kind eyes, I felt only bloodlust and pain.

We told her that she could only talk to one of us if she agreed to be in handcuffs and chains. At first, she seemed honestly offended by the proposition but soon agreed to our terms. We told her that the meeting would be at 12 pm and she didn't mind. Her aggravation hasn't subsided or lessened, so we will keep that in mind as we move forward with this risky meeting.

**November 17th - 11:30 pm**

So Lily officially has handcuffs on. It took us a few minutes to amp ourselves up, but we went in and put them on her and then left. When we went in, she stared at us and called us cock suckers, letting us put the handcuffs on her, letting us walk out of the room. She also told us to call her Lily instead of her original name. So I will be referring to her as Lily.

I cannot understand how she was able to do this. But now I believe that we are talking to a different person entirely. Victoria is no longer here in the room, it is now Lily, and I will try and remember this going forward.

**November 17th - 12:00pm -> 12:30pm**

The following are the words spoken between Lily and me during the time that the meeting was in session:

**Donovan:**   Hello, Lily! My name is Donovan. You wanted to have an audience, but I hope I am an audience enough.

**Lily:**   You are fine...

**Donovan:**   May I ask why you wanted to talk to us?

**Lily:**   Well, you wanted a confession, right?

**Donovan:**   Not necessarily; we simply wanted to figure out how Victoria forgot an entire day with little effort. But that does beg the question, do you have a role to play?

**Lily:**   Fuck you.

**Donovan:**   Okay, then, what do you want to talk about?

**Lily:**   Where are we?

**Donovan:**   We are somewhere safe. You are safe, and you do not have to worry.

**Lily:**   I'm not worried.

**Donovan:**   Okay, then why did you request my audience?

**Lily:**   As I told you before, I wanna confess.

**Donovan:**   Confess to what?

**Lily:**   I killed a total of 30 people.

**Donovan:**   Oh? We've only found twenty-five bodies. Can you tell me where the remaining five are?

**Lily:**   Here.

**Donovan:**   What do you mean by 'here?'

**Lily:**   You will be the bodies.

**Donovan:**   Oh? Mind elaborating for me?

**Lily:**   Sure. Since you were kind enough to see me, you will be the last to die. Your friend in that room you have been sitting in will be second last. The two guards outside of the door will be third and fourth last. And whoever comes in here and takes off my handcuffs will be the first.

**Donovan:**   I think that's all of the time I have; thank you for talking with me.

\~\~End Transcript\~\~

The entire room felt cold as I left it. That thing I was talking to did not feel human. I could feel no emotion coming off of it asides from the extreme blood lust emanating from that side of the room. This predator was hunting, and it let me, the prey, enter its den. I hope whatever the fuck this is ends soon.

**5pm**

While we observed Lily, we finally gave in and let the individual go in and unlock her chains. It was right about every single detail. The guy shot a tranq at her, waiting until she was on the ground for a minute before going over to unlock the handcuffs. He bent down and grabbed her wrists to unlock the cuffs, which was when it happened.

That thing faked passing out. Its arms went backwards, contorting in ways arms should not, grabbing the man's hand and shattering them like toothpicks. The man fell to his knees, howling in pain as she turned around; the handcuff chain split as she reached around and grabbed his arm. She stared him in the eye before turning her body and using the momentum to throw him into the fucking wall. She didn't let go of his arm; it simply ripped off from the force. He exploded on impact. This thing isn't fucking human.

The guards came in next, aiming their guns at her. Before a single shot had been fired, she was upon them. She grabbed them both by their necks and ripped out their windpipes, doing so near effortlessly. She then threw their tracheas aside before grabbing their vest and throwing them into the room. She threw them with little effort, meeting the equivalent of swatting away a mosquito, turning to mush as they hit the wall.

She is now punching the door to this room, screaming and laughing as her punches get louder. It is deafening, and I am currently hiding like a coward. I can do nothing about this. If this gets out to the world, we are fucked. I am fucked.

**November 18th - 12 am**

After what felt like hours, the pounding stopped abruptly. After a few minutes, I got up and went to the two-way mirror, honestly shaking with every instinct telling me to hide. When I looked into the room, I saw Lily standing there, holding her phone to her head, talking to her dad. When she put the phone down and looked around, she began to scream.

I brought up my complaint with the head, and I now realize he does not care. We will continue to study this issue further. I will continue to study this person and the intertwined entity, no matter how fucked it is. I'm going to die here.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me. I will answer anything I can legally answer.

So long.
