You’ve probably seen the Netflix documentary *Melissa & Marcus: Forbidden Lovers.* From the looks of it everyone on Twitter has. But if you haven’t, go watch it before reading this. It’s OK, I can wait. 

Done? Good. No doubt you have an opinion on the highschool duo, the two *star-crossed sociopaths* \- as one shitty social influencer oh so cleverly christened them. Everyone now does. I’m no different, but my opinion is steeped in a little known quantity. Something called fact. 

Because I actually knew them. Well, I knew Melissa mostly. But through her I grew to know Marcus. And when I say I knew Melissa, I only knew her for about two weeks. But that was enough time for us to make a big impact on each other’s lives.

The reason I’m telling you this is because when the producers of the documentary got in contact with me to ask if I’d like to give ‘my take’ on the story, I knew that my take - which is the actual truth - wouldn’t fit in with their neatly prepared narrative; the story that we all know and you have probably soaked up. I also knew that if I gave my take I’d torch what little reputation I have and forever be known as that batshit psychic woman. 

But maybe by writing it down and presenting it to you here, free from edited soundbites and awful spooky music, you might hear what I have to say with an open mind. Actually, your opinion doesn’t matter. The truth is the truth and I’m telling it. Enough with the star-crossed sociopath bullshit. 

This is what happened in the two weeks leading up to the events of June 14th 2005.

\*\*\*

When Melissa Rourke sat down opposite me in the school cafeteria I initially thought she had mistaken me for one of her friends. Up until then we had barely spoken to each other, except for one time when we were paired together in science, but that was a forced arrangement. She was widely regarded as one of the hottest girls in school and I was regarded as average. Well, *doable* according to some of the boys (aren’t they just the sweetest?) But she hadn’t made a mistake. 

‘Hi Amy, do you mind if I talk to you about something?’ she asked. 

The manner in which she spoke sounded forced, almost rehearsed, as if she had been practising how to address me. 

‘Erm, sure.’

‘Thank you. Do you mind if we go somewhere private?’

That sounded ominous. 

‘What’s this about?’ I asked, trying not to sound too concerned. 

‘It’s nothing weird. I just need your advice on something.’

Whatever apprehension I felt softened. *She just needs project work advice*, I thought. Although I wasn’t sure why we needed to speak in private. But whatever. 

‘Yeah. Sure,’ I said. 

I’m not sure if any other students saw us leave and thought *why is Melissa Rourke hanging out with Amy Peters?* But I sure was. 

Melissa’s private place turned out to be her car: a modest Kia 5 sedan, a step down from the BMW’s or Mercedez some of her hot girl cohorts drove. Her family had money but obviously weren’t lunatics when it came to indulging their daughter. I was grateful in a way; if we slipped into a fancy car my neutral opinion of her would have hardened into dislike. 

‘OK,’ she said. ‘This is going to sound crazy.’

Always a good start to a conversation, My face tried to stay passive and non-judgmental. She continued:

‘You know Marcus Knott?’

‘Yes.’

If you haven’t watched the Netflix documentary - and I know most of you dived into reading this before watching the series, despite my warning - Marcus Knott was the school freak. There are kinder ways to put it, but those ways are less honest. He was a weed-smoking loner who looked like he needed to be plunged in a bath. Even the saddest IT nerds kept him away. Outside of class he spent his time alone, glued into his headphones or writing on a notepad. I never got close enough to ever see what he was writing. 

So now you know Marcus. Back to it…

‘Please don’t think I’m crazy,’ she said.

‘I won’t.’ That was a lie. *Don’t say anything crazy then*, I thought. 

‘OK…I’ve been thinking about him,’ she said, before back-tracking slightly. ‘Well, not thinking about him. It’s more like - I don’t know how to describe it - it’s more like I’ve been having kind of like, *visions* about him.’

Then it all made sense - why she sat opposite me in the cafeteria and why she wanted to talk to me. And I didn’t appreciate her reason. Not one bit. You see, I had a reputation in school for being a bit of a goth, a bit into wicca. I think it’s because I went through a period of wearing crystals and reading the odd book on witchcraft. And so in the great high school tradition of labelling, that henceforth became my identity. Honestly, you read one book on summoning a demon spirit and everyone thinks you’re a paid up sorceress. But I didn’t really care what people thought, until they jerked me around, and this counted as jerking me around.

‘Very funny. Really funny. Where are your girlfriends then?’ I looked out of the car, trying to spot one of her idiot blonde buddies watching the whole thing and laughing themselves sick. 

‘I’m not joking. I swear to you.’

I wanted to get of the car and tell her to go fuck herself, but there was something about her expression and tone that pulled me back. She looked worried. Frightened, even. She had probably been hiding her true feelings, buried beneath all her smiling politeness. She knew if she’d come straight out with *I’m seeing visions of Marcus Knott!* I’d run a mile - sympathy with the occult or not. 

So I knew she wasn’t faking. I saw her in rehearsals for the school play to know she wasn’t that good an actress. 

I wasn’t sure how to react so I just gave a slow, understanding nod, like some condescending counsellor, and added a non-committal “OK.”

There was a pause. 

‘I swear,’ she said. 

I nodded again. Then there was only one question I could ask: 

‘What are the visions?’

\*\*\*

The juicy bit. Aka the bit which would have condemned me as the nut of Netflix if I had appeared in the series. But this is what she told me, after I promised again to not judge her, my fingers very much firmly crossed behind my back. She laid it out: for the last three days she had seen visions of Marcus Knott massacring students with an AR15 at the school prom, scheduled in just under two weeks.

Now I’ve embellished that a little: she said ‘shooting’ instead of massacring and plain ole’ ‘rifle’ instead of AR15, but I thought I should spice it up a bit. Plus we’re dealing with ethereal, prophetic visions here so let’s not get too hung up on the details. 

She spoke with the same nervous urgency as before. I believed what she was saying - or at least I believed that she believed what she was saying - but part of me was still offended that she would come to me in the first place. So before I went any further, I wanted to see her wriggle a bit. I needed to hear her say it. 

‘And you’re telling me this because what? Because you think I can help you? Because I’m a *witch*?’

She shook her head. ‘No. I know you’re not a witch….’I was pleased she didn’t patronise me and say it with mock incredulity - *A witch? I think you’re a witch? Moi?! How could you even think that?* ‘...It’s just that I can’t talk to any of my friends about this. They’ll think I’m nuts. And like, I thought you might know about this stuff. But look, I’m sorry, OK? I didn’t mean to offend you. Let’s just forget it-.’

‘-It’s fine,’ I said. I’d had my fill and I didn’t want her to sound any more pathetic. The truth was I understood why she would talk to me. Damn highschool labels. 

‘Thank you. I’m sorry.’ 

‘It’s OK’. It was - just.

Then there was a moment of quiet between us. I stared out of the window and watched students file back into the main building. I could sense she didn’t want to speak first; she didn’t want to risk interrupting whatever lofty sorceress opinion that was about to spill out of my mouth. The fact was I didn’t know what to say. After a minute, she broke the silence.

‘So, do you know about this stuff?’

‘A bit.’ A lie. I knew a lot. 

I felt her relax, as if she knew she was in safe hands. ‘What do you think is happening to me?’

‘Have you considered you might be schizophrenic?’

Her face screwed up. ‘That’s not funny.’

‘It wasn’t meant to be a joke. Have you seen a doctor?’

‘You just said you knew about this.’

‘Yeah but before we even go there, have you seen a doctor?’

She told me that her doctor would just accuse her of smoking weed again, the high CBT shit that can make you hallucinate. I didn’t ask if she had been. That felt insulting and I believed she was clean. She added that’s why she hasn’t told her parents as well. 

A thought then hit me followed by a laugh that I managed to keep down. Ten minutes ago, I was sitting in the cafeteria eating an awful spaghetti lunch and now Melissa Rourke, the hottest girl in the year by any objective standard, was confessing to me that she was seeing mystical projections of Marcus Knott murdering the student body in their fine dresses and rented tuxedos. Pretty weird for a Tuesday. 

‘When did they start? The visions?’ I asked. 

‘About two days ago. I sat next to him in history. Then he dropped his pencil and when he leaned down to pick it up, it was like bam! I saw the whole thing in my head. And it was so clear, like fucking TV or something. It lasted only a second but I saw everything. Then yesterday I walked past him in the corridor and again it hit me. The same thing.’

‘So it happened both times when you got close to him?’

‘Exactly. That’s what I figured.’ Her eyes were wide and eager, happy that I was giving her the first real sign that I believed her. 

‘And in the visions, what do you see? Exactly.’

She shifted slightly and swallowed. I guessed she hadn’t said the details out loud and articulating them made them feel more real. But she wasn’t going to shut up now. She told me that she saw Marcus walk into the gym, look around, take out a rifle (an AR15) from his long coat and start firing. She told me that he shoots her friends Claire Atkins and Jessica Brazier both in the chest and face and then shoots three other students, Tim Dryer, Chris Watson and Katy Poppins. She told me that he shoots Mr Dawson, the English teacher, in the face. She said that one is the worst because the bullet goes through his glasses into his left eye. She told me about screaming and stampeding and sheer panic and students wetting themselves and lots and lots of blood - on the wax floor, the walls, but mostly on students. Finally she told me that Marcus calmly pops the rifle into his mouth before launching his dome high into the rafters. 

At the end, I was pretty sure there was a slight tear in her eye. She then asked a question she’d asked before, but this time I could tell she didn’t want a snarky response.

‘What do you think is happening to me?’

‘I’m not sure.’ A half-lie. More on that shortly. 

She looked to the side, trying to hide what I figured was disappointment. I couldn’t leave her like this.

‘Let me look into it. OK?’

Those eager eyes came straight back. ‘Great. Thank you Amy.’ Then she came out with the question we were both wondering deep down.

‘Do you think it’s real? That it will happen?’

And that laugh I kept suppressed suddenly came up. ‘I guess we’ll find out in two weeks.’

She gave a crooked smile. *Too soon?*

I then half-lied again, telling her I’d look into it and we swapped numbers - a little *whoop-whoop* popping into my head. *Look at me getting Melissa Rourke’s number; we’re moving up in the world.* As I got out of the car, I couldn’t resist one more joke.

‘So in the cafeteria, when you said “don’t worry, it’s nothing weird”, thanks for being honest with me.’

She laughed at that. She needed to. 

\*\*\*

My half-lie about looking into it was really a full lie. I didn’t have any intention of rifling through my occult books for any answers. Considering her brave confession, you might think that sounds pretty shitty of me. But I can explain. 

Firstly, I thought it would blow over. I thought she’ll pull herself together, realise it was just some paranoid brainfunk - maybe left over from her weed smoking days - and we would go back to not knowing each other, save for being paired up in science where she’d never mention what she told me out of mortal embarrassment. 

Secondly, I didn’t need to rifle through the books because I was pretty sure I knew what was happening to her, assuming her experience did qualify as genuinely supernatural, and that’s assuming you can qualify the word ‘supernatural’ with ‘genuine’. 

She was becoming a *receiver*. Some people *project* their intentions and desires without realising it, and others *receive* those desires. The deeper ‘why’ relates to your branch of mysticism and morality. Some believe the conduit is forged by a kindly spirit inhabiting the receiver’s soul. Others believe it’s a curse for past misdeeds. 

I didn’t necessarily believe in spirits or punishments, but I did believe her. This might be the apt moment to mention that when it came to the supernatural, the occult, witchcraft, the whole wardrobe of spooky ass shit, I sit in the middle. Some don’t believe, others do, but if you draw a line between satanic lamb slaughterers on one side and cold as ice, rational scientists on the other, you’ll find me square in the boring, grey middle. I’m open minded, and not open-minded in the Joe Rogan playing-both-sides cowardly way. I mean open minded in that I believe there are forces beyond our comprehension but I am not going to start drinking virgin blood to appease our dark overlords. Clear? Good. 

When afternoon came and went the following day and I hadn’t seen Melissa, I thought my first reason had been vindicated. She was a messed up hot girl who just needed to up her prozac. It wasn’t going to hold it against her, we’ll just put it in the past. 

Then as I walked to the break room at the start of my free period, she appeared beside me. She didn’t preface this outburst with any pleasantries. Her face was all business. 

‘Something happened.’

This time we spoke in a quiet spot behind the gymnasium - the scene of the future crime if the visions were accurate - and this time Melissa didn’t appear nervous. In fact, she seemed confident, almost determined. She said that was walking to Maths class that morning; Marcus was walking the other way towards her and when they got closer…

‘...I smiled at him. I don’t know why, probably because I was nervous, and the vision happened again. But this time it seemed…’ She trailed off.

‘What?’

‘I don’t know. Like…milkier,’ she said. 

‘Milkier?’

‘Yeah. Is that a word?’

‘Yes it’s a word. You mean it looked like it was covered in milk.’

‘Yeah but only a little. And the colours weren’t as strong and it was a little bit blurry. Apart from that it was just the same. The same shooting and everything. Then it stopped and kept on walking.’

‘OK,’ I said. 

‘Do you know why it was different? Milkier.’

I could tell she was asking rhetorically. I knew why but I didn’t want to steal her thunder. It was fun seeing her work it out and I could tell it was good for her. 

‘No…Do you?’ I asked. 

‘I think…Because I smiled at him.’ That’s what I thought. She continued, on a roll now. ‘And it made me think, boys like Marcus, if he is going to be one of these school shooter types, they’re always loners. No one is ever friends with them. No girlfriend. But when I smiled at him, it like, affected him. And the vision went all milky and blurry because…’

I had to help get there. The rambling quickly became annoying. ‘...Because you have changed the future, or at least diminished its likelihood.’

‘Yeah. It’s like, have you seen Back to the Future?’

I rolled my eyes. ‘Yes of course I have seen Back to the Future. You think your visions have got blurrier because you have changed the future just like how Marty’s family gets blurrier when he changes the future.’

‘Yeah except my thing is actually good, whereas Michael J Fox didn’t want his thing to happen.’

‘That’s true,’ I said. 

She folded her arms as if she had delivered a big finish. ‘What do you think?’

‘It sounds…plausible. Really fucking plausible.’ One of the first proper truths I had told her. ‘But as your science partner, what should we do to be sure?’

‘Erm, you know I suck at science,’ she said.

I gave her a knowing grin.

‘Test your theory.’

\*\*\*

We devised a bold, radical experiment: Melissa would actually say hello to Marcus and engage him in a quick, harmless conversation. If our hypothesis were true and he was crying out for some kind of social connection in his sad, freakish heart, her visions would become *milkier*. Now we were still making some massive assumptions: that Marcus intentions were real and that the milkier look meant that they were becoming less likely to happen, but what else did we have to go on? We also decided that she wasn’t going to ignore or provoke Marcus to see if the visions become more crystallised and less milky. I said for all we knew that could rubber stamp the massacre into fate.

To satisfy my own curiosity - and to leap into action if anything went wrong, of course - I insisted I had to be there to see it play out. So we put our plan into action the next morning when all three of us would be in the same Eng Lit class. 

I arrived before any of the other students and sat at the back: the perfect viewing spot. The bell rang, then a couple of minutes later, students filed in, Marcus amongst them. He shuffled along, head down, and took his seat in the middle right by the window. Then Melissa came in. She looked at me and gave a knowing nod, like something you’d see a character do in a heist movie. I watched as she clocked Marcus and walked right at him. She went right at it. 

‘Hi Marcus,’ she said. ‘Have you read the chapter? I totally forgot. Eeek.’

From the looks of it, I’m not sure Marcus knew what was happening. Clearly he hadn’t factored this into his day. He looked up, his mouth gawping, his eyes fixed on the beauty who was honouring him with her presence. 

After what seemed an age he croaked a timid reply, ‘Erm, yes.’ But I wasn’t really interested in his response. I wanted to see if I could catch a glimpse of the unseen. 

I stared at Melissa. If any other student looked at her, they’d think she was acting normally - save for the fact she was talking to the school freak. But I saw it. Only for a brief moment, her eyelids flickered, her face became dead still, serene-like, and her fingers by her side twitched as though invisible wires were pulling on them. She was receiving, alright. 

A second or two later, she snapped back and smiled at him. 

‘Do you mind telling me what happens?’ she asked, as she sat next to him.

For the next two minutes I watched Marcus drip out a rough synopsis of the chapter, with plenty of *erms* and *uhs* and awkward clicking sounds from his dry tongue.

‘Thanks so much,’ Melissa whispered, just as Mrs Hawhorne cleared her throat and began the class. 

About half an hour later, a text popped up on my phone. It was Melissa: ‘Way milkier’.

At lunch, back in our spot behind the gymnasium, we talked about what I jokingly called *phase two* of our operation.

‘You’re going to need to become his buddy,’ I said. 

‘Jesus.’

‘The lives of your buddies depend on it. I hope they appreciate the sacrifice in social esteem you’re making for them.’

‘Jesus. Do I have to?’

‘Of course you don’t have to. We could just both walk away and forget this ever happened. I won’t hold it against you - that is unless I’m one of the students taking a bullet in your vision, but then I’ll be dead so who cares?’

She laughed. ‘I really don’t want people to know though.’

‘How about you keep it strictly off-campus then? Meet somewhere quiet.’

‘Where?’

I then suggested underneath the Culver Bridge (yep, that Culver Bridge, Netflix viewers) about ten minutes walk from the school. There was a bench and a small clearing and it was always quiet. I knew because sometimes I’d go there to read and write poetry. Yep, I do that. 

‘And I have to keep this up all the way till prom?’ she asked. 

‘I guess so. And if we’re sticking to our theory, then ideally we need your visions to go completely white. Meaning he’s no longer planning on doing the shooting.’

‘Right.’

I smiled as a thought hit me. ‘It’s like he’s some psycho tamagotchi that has to be cared for or else he goes freaking nuts and guns people down.’ She looked at me blankly. I shook my head and explained what a tamagotchi was.

‘Oh right,’ she said. She then stared out across the school field, an unease coming over her. 

‘So this place is secluded?’ she asked.

‘Yep. None of your friends will be there.’

‘I’m more thinking - I really don’t want him to kill me, Amy.’

‘Does he kill you in your vision?’

‘No.’

‘Then don’t worry,’ I said. ‘And besides, I’ll be watching.’

\*\*\*

I wasn’t going to miss this for the world. I detested high school hierarchies, but even I couldn’t resist the chance to witness such an unthinkable event: the unlikely meeting of a high school beauty and a repellent low-life, out in the wild. Passing it up would be like choosing to stare at the ground during a total eclipse.

And yes of course I would jump in if anything bad happened. We’d agreed on a hand signal if she got spooked. But I knew she’d be fine. Her visions had made that clear. 

So as I hid in the bushes on the other side of the woods and watched them walk along the winding path from the overhead road to the bench underneath the bridge, I couldn’t look away. I felt like a social David Attenborough. 

This initial interaction was going to be fifteen minutes tops. Just a friendly *I always thought you seemed interesting and I thought we should chat*. I could only imagine what Marcus thought - and felt - when she asked him at lunchtime if he wanted to meet up with her after school and talk. Did he think he was going to get laid? Surely. Frankly, I wondered if he got an erection there and then. 

They sat on the bench - Melissa keeping a solid three feet of space between them - and talked. And thanks to the miracle of cellular communication and Melissa hiding her iphone just inside her bag, I heard the whole thing. 

‘...Thanks for helping me in class,’ she said. 

‘Erm, no problem.’ 

‘This is a really relaxing place here. A friend told me about it.’

‘Oh yeah, it is,’ he said. I swore I could hear the sound of his throat swallowing nervously. 

‘So I know this is kind of weird, but I just wanted to get to know you better.’ She sounded convincing. Where was this actress on drama club night? ‘What do you like to do?’

‘Erm…I like to read. I play videogames.’ Big surprise. 

‘Cool. I like games, though I suck at them. Which one is your favourite?’

‘Call of Duty.’ *Surprise-surprise*.

‘I like that one too.’ I couldn’t tell if she was lying or not. Her acting had definitely improved. Then Marcus performed a social miracle: he asked a question. 

‘Which one is your favourite?’ Not the most inventive, but give the novice a break.

‘Erm. I kind of like Candy Crush.’

‘Yeah I like that too.’

The conversation continued in that riveting vein for ten minutes. But really I didn’t care about the content. I wanted to know one thing and when they said goodbyes and Melissa went one way and Marcus went the other, I soon found out. She didn’t need to tell me; the beaming smile on her face said it out loud.

We had a total white out. 

So mission accomplished, right? Yes, she would have to maintain the ‘friendship’ but we were keeping the future in check. Disaster at prom, then a week away, would be averted. 

When I look back now, I think we both knew what the spanner in the works would be. I certainly did. I just didn’t think it would arrive with such thumping intensity. 

Two days later at lunchtime in the cafeteria, Marcus, now insanely buoyant by his newfound social charisma, walked up to Melissa as she sat with her hot girlfriends and asked if she would like to go to prom with him. 

I didn’t see it. To my utter agony, I was in the library. But I heard Joey Armstrong tell his pal Mike Wilkins in art class. 

‘What did she say?!’ asked Mike, almost shaking with glee.

‘She just went so fucking red and then just got up and ran. Her girlfriends burst out laughing and Marcus looked like he was going to pee his pants.’

‘Fuck. I wish I was there.’

Me too. If only to intervene and shout ‘of course she will!’

‘Couldn’t you have just said “Yes”?’ I asked. We were back in her car this time. 

‘You weren’t there, Amy. It was fucking awful. All my friends were looking at me. Why the fuck did he do that?’

‘He thought he made a friend.’

‘I know, but - fuck.’

I broached *the* subject. ‘And what about…you know what?’

‘Yep. It came straight back. Except it looked like fucking IMAX.’

I knew not to laugh. It was funny, but I knew not to laugh. 

‘Amy. Did we cause this? Is he going to kill everyone because we tried to stop him?’ Part of me was impressed she was thinking in terms of predestination, temporal inevitably, that kind of thing, but I had to reassure her. 

‘No. I’m pretty sure he was crazy enough to do this without our help.’

‘So what do we do?’

\*\*\*

It was time to get serious. Prom was in just two days. No more fucking about. Now contacting the police wasn’t going to work. What would Melissa say? *I’m a prophetic receiver and a wall of death is on the horizon.* Nowhere near the benchmark for probable cause. But there were other options. 

On the CNN website I found an article talking about preventing high school shootings. Along with a list of the telltale signs like social exclusion, moodiness - all of which Marcus fitted - it mentioned that every school or school district should *ideally* have a threat assessment team, composed of an administrator, a school mental health professional and a school resource officer (an SRO) or law enforcement liaison. I stress ideally because surprise-surprise James Monroe High didn’t, but we did have a school counsellor who I thought was decent enough, Mr Alex Roberts. 

I went on my own to Roberts and said that I had fears about Marcus, leaving out the part about my suspicions coming from my semi-friend’s mystical revelations. He looked serious enough, his head nodding along, his eyes all sympathetic, especially when I lied and said Marcus had spoken about ‘doing things’ to students who had ‘wronged him.’ He thanked me for bringing this to his attention and that he would talk to him. 

To this day I’m not sure if Mr Roberts ever did speak to Marcus or a member of his family. Perhaps some wannabe true-crime journalist could find out? 

This was all belts and braces stuff though. We both knew what really had to be done: Melissa had to go on a full charm offensive and dilute her visions back to harmless milky nothingness. And to be one hundred percent safe, we had to make sure Marcus never made it to the ball.

On the night before prom, I snuck into my parents bedroom and stole a few of my mom’s sleeping pills from her bedside cabinet. That amount, ground up, and slipped into a bottle of bud would surely knock Marcus clean out - and if he ever did make it to the party, he’d never be able to aim straight. 

As I poured the fine dust into an envelope, Melissa called me. She’d been to see Martin, just as we planned, having got his address from Peter Thompson, his one part-time friend. She told me she profusely apologised and said she would love to go to prom with him. She said she would come round the following night and maybe they could have some drinks before heading off. 

‘What did he say?’ I asked

‘Not much. He looked too excited to speak.’

‘And the vision? Did it go white?’

She didn’t say anything. 

‘Melissa?’ I asked. 

‘It didn’t go white…’

‘...Shit!...’

‘...It changed.’ There was a resignation in her voice. ‘I saw my friends, the same students as before, but now they were laughing. Marcus and I…we were dancing together.’

‘Jesus. It doesn’t mean that’s going to happen. You just make sure he drinks the beer.’

‘Yeah.’

Another pause. 

‘You know you don’t have to do this? Any of this? We could just hang out together tomorrow night and what will be will be.’

‘I know. But if anything did happen I wouldn’t be able to forget it. I’d rather they laugh at me than be dead.’

The same thought I’d been having more and more each day came to me again: she was a better person than me. 

That night I dreamed of the shooting. I saw Claire Atkins’ pretty head come apart and Chris Watson’s throat split and spray blood. I saw Marcus shoot Katy Poppins in the face while she begged for her life and cowered under a trestle table. And most disturbing of all, I saw Melissa, her face cold and blue, lying on the ground in her prom dress, purchased with better hopes in mind. 

I woke up with tears in my eyes. I had never been so frightened.

\*\*\*

I didn’t see Melissa on the day of the prom. Not that we needed to meet again; we both knew our jobs. While she put psycho boy to sleep, I would be at the prom, dancing and talking and pretending to have a good time, all the while positioned right by the fire alarm in the unlikely event Marcus showed up. I hoped my date wouldn’t find me too boring. 

Ah yes, I indeed had a date. Andy Fuller, a sweet, normal guy in my history class. Why haven’t I mentioned him? Because if this is an accurate testament of the events and my state of mind leading up to prom, I thought it appropriate that he be pretty much absent. Considering all the chaos I barely thought about him and almost forgot he had asked me to prom two weeks before. When he texted to ask what time I wanted to be picked up, I knew it was too late to cancel. And going off Melissa’s visions, I was confident I wasn’t leading him to his death at least. 

We ended up arriving at seven-thirty, half an hour before the official start time, and said hello to the handful of other losers who showed up way too early. Andy, bless him, never asked why I wanted to turn up then. He fetched me a drink and I set up camp by the fire alarm. 

At quarter-past eight, Melissa phoned me. I knew it wasn’t good. I told Andy I’d be right back, walked to the corridor outside, and answered. 

‘I knocked the beer over,’ she said, her voice hushed. ‘He tried to kiss me, I flinched and knocked the beer off his desk.’

I shut my eyes. *Fuck.*

‘Where are you now?’ I asked. 

‘In his bathroom. We’re leaving in ten minutes.’

‘Fuck.’

‘It’s OK, Amy. We tried. I’m still seeing the same vision. The laughter. I’ll take it.’

‘OK.’

‘And I’ll make sure he doesn’t have a gun. I’ll feel him up to check if I have to.’

‘OK…I’m sorry Melissa.’

‘Why are you apologising? I should have just kissed him.’

They arrived at 8:45pm and the smirks and the looks between everyone started a few seconds later. She looked beautiful, not that anyone seemed to notice. I watched from the other side of the dance floor as Claire Atkins - soon to be dead in another timeline, the ungrateful bitch - walked up to her, dragged to her to the side and mouthed *what the actual fuck?* Melissa gave an awkward smile, shook her head and said - according to Netflix’s interview with Claire - that she was just *playing a joke and wasn’t really on a date with Marcus*. Her buddy didn’t believe her and just walked away, throwing her hands up in the air. 

Another twenty minutes passed. Melissa and Marcus stood against the wall, hiding from the lights of the dance floor. Occasionally he would say something in her ear and she would smile politely and nod. Other students, who had by then backed far away from them, gave more smirks. 

Then the slow dance music started and I knew it was about to happen. I felt sick for her. Andy asked if I wanted to dance and I took his hand. I had to be near her. As he held me to him, I turned my head and saw Marcus leading her to the floor. Students parted from them as though they were contagious. Everyone had become a social David Attenborough. They had to see it. I don’t remember what the song was, but I do remember those smirks turning into laughter. We had arrived at the future. 

They swayed for two whole minutes, every second of which Melissa looked at the ground behind Marcus’s shoulder with a fixed, determined stare that said *not long now. Let them laugh. You’re saving their lives.* 

‘Can you believe this shit?’ Andy whispered. I didn’t say anything. 

The song rolled on. Students sniggered. Melissa endured. But Marcus, who I guess had been living in oblivious sexual bliss up until then, began to notice. His expression seemed to darken, and in an instant I could draw a line between the scrawny, waif-like boy in front of me and the monster Melissa saw in her visions. 

I shut my eyes, his look was that ugly, turned my head away, and when I opened them, I almost laughed out of sheer shock. Walking through the gymnasium door was our friendly part time SRO, glock 9mm holstered at his side. Weeks later I learned that SRO’s tend to frequent events that are deemed potentially high-risk such as proms. So that’s what happens when you try to defy fate?

I looked back at Melissa. She’d seen the officer too. As had Marcus. His darkness turned obsidian. He whispered something in Melissa’s ear and strided towards the officer. 

I’d stopped dancing by then. Andy asked me if I was alright. Melissa gave me a haunting smile that seemed to say: *At least tried Amy*. Marcus drew closer.

*So did we cause this?* I thought. 

‘Run,’ I whispered to Andy. 

But that’s when fate did a 180. Marcus walked right past the officer and out into the night.  

\*\*\*

As you know, the Netflix documentary *Marcus and Melissa: Forbidden Lovers* is not about a highschool massacre. It never happened. But I have to believe it would have. Or at least I have to believe it would have to make any sense about what happened next. To make sense of what that stupid documentary is really about. 

Melissa and I spent the rest of prom night in a state of hypervigilance, ready to pounce on the fire alarm. We didn’t know if he was going to come back armed to the teeth. But as the clock reached eleven and the party began to wind down, we felt ourselves relax. We’d done it and it had only cost Melissa total humiliation. 

In the parking lot, students were getting into limos to head off to after-parties. Andy had already left without saying goodbye. Totally understandable. I’d been a terrible date. 

‘Can I give you a lift home?’ I asked Melissa. 

‘Thank you but I think I’m going to walk,’ she said. I was amazed that she still looked beautiful all things considered. 

‘Do you think he’ll do anything else?’

She shrugged. ‘I guess it’s not our problem anymore. I’m not marrying the guy if that's what it takes.’

I laughed. ‘How can you be that selfish?’

I learned towards her and she sensed what I was looking for. We hugged and then said goodbye. As I climbed into my car, I watched her walk off in the direction of Culver Bridge.

There now comes speculation on my part sandwiched between undeniable agreed-upon facts. 

The first fact: Marcus came across Melissa on Culver Bridge. 

My speculation: he tried to kiss her again, she pulled away. He asked her why and thinking that she was in the clear, she told him that she didn’t like him, that she had no intention of being his girlfriend or having anything to do with him. That she was only pretending to like him so that he didn’t commit mass-murder - I personally hope she told him that. Right to the face. Then that darkness I glimpsed earlier on rushed back into him. He hit her. Maybe she fought back, but probably not. 

The second fact: Melissa’s body was found strangled and beaten the next day, near the bench where their lives entwined. 

Marcus Knott was arrested a couple of days later. The genius had forgotten to turn his phone off allowing the police to track him to Melissa’s last known location. Then it was a quick DNA swab and bingo. 

In the weeks that followed, something darker than Marcus’s mood grew in our town and James Monroe High: a lie. It was seeded in misinterpretations of reality - when the police discovered through phone record locations that Melissa and Marcus had spent time together, once at the Culver Bridge and once at his family home on prom night. It was then watered by students like Melissa’s former friends Claire Atkins and Jessica Brazier, both of whom felt guilty for laughing when Marcus asked her to prom and when they danced cheek to cheek. Then it bloomed into our much-lauded Netflix documentary that posited a ridiculous theory: that Marcus and Melissa wanted to be together, that highschool rules kept them apart, and when they dared to break the order, Marcus reacted with uncontrollable violent passion. *If we weren’t so quick to judge, maybe they’d both be alive today and free to love each other.*  

Bullshit. I knew the truth and if you believe my story so do you. She wanted nothing to do with him. It’s not Hollywood, but it’s real. 

And if you’ll indulge me, I’d like to write this part to Melissa herself. I think she’s out there; I’m coming out of the boring, grey middle for this part.

Melissa, Claire Atkins grew up to become a paediatrician and now lives in Jefferson, South Carolina with her husband and two sons; Jessica Brazier went into teaching and works at an elementary school in the suburbs of Hartford; Tim Dryer expanded his father’s furniture business and lives in an impressive mansion with his wife and three kids in Austin, Texas; Katy Poppins became an actress and lives in LA with her two dogs; and Chris Watson apparently moved to Spain, married a hot guy and is father to a beautiful girl.

Unfortunately Mr Dawson died of lung cancer two years after your murder. But when you change the course of time, you can’t grant everyone a golden future, right?

And the psycho? He was sentenced to life without parole in the Lee Correctional Institution, South Carolina. But three years into his stay, his cellmate accused him of stealing his shaving crime and stabbed him fourteen times in the chest. I figure that must have hurt a lot more than blowing his head off in the gymnasium. 

All of these stories played out because of you. We’re living in your world now. You changed me too. My husband and I might both be unemployed graphic designers with a two year old to support, but regardless of how tough life can be, I try to live by one rule: if I sense something bad is going to happen, I make damn sure I put it right. 

I don’t think about you all the time. It’s been fifteen years, I’m not a weirdo. But when I do I usually have the same thought: after our crazy two weeks together, did we become friends? And if we did and if you were still here today, do you think we still would be? 

I hope so.
