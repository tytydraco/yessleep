It was just a girls trip. After the last few years, Meg deserved it.

Bali. The Pray in Eat, Pray, Love. 

A week later, me and the girls greeted her at the airport. 

When Morgan saw her, she sprinted through the concourse and jumped into her arms. The unencumbered freedom of a four year old. 

Back home, despite jet lag, she unzipped her bag and started handing out souvenirs. Later, lying in bed, her soft, rhyming breathing gently filling the room, it hit me how much I had missed her.  

I saw it the next morning.  After my run, stretching on the porch.  She was watching.  Wooden. Around sixteen inches tall, but somehow felt taller.  

Curly hair, rings on her toes and in her nose.  In a dancing pose. 

She looked celebratory, except for her eyes. They seemed to watch me.  Inimical. Hateful. 

“You got a statue.” A question.  Kind of.  

At first Meg looked vaguely confused.  

“The dancing lady?” she asked.  

“Yeah.”  

“How’d you know?”  She asked, again. 

“She’s on the front porch.” 

Peering through the front window, Meg saw her.  

“I must’ve put her out last night.”  She explained, although I’ve heard those explanations before. 

From my dad, when he was drinking. When the haze of the night before seeped into his memory. Desperate to explain away  missing time, cover for strange behavior. 

“I got her in Bali.”  She said.  “At this temple…”

“Temple?” I asked. 

“Bali was so isolated from the world, many of these ancient temples still exist.  Magical places, untouched by the modern world. I wish you could’ve been there…”

She kept telling me about the trip. About the beaches, the waves.  The magic.  And I forgot about the dancing lady. 

Except in the dawn, after my run. I avoided stretching on the porch; avoided her cold gaze. 

I noticed the hair first.  Kate had thrown Morgan’s ball on the porch. Older sisters. 

Running up the stairs, I saw her and suddenly felt cold.  Something was different.  Studying, trying to figure out what. 

Her hair.  It was no longer curly. Straight.  

That evening, Meg and I celebrated our anniversary.  She looked stunning in her dress. Her hair curled.  

“You went to the salon?” I asked.  “How’s Jen doing.”

Early in our courtship, Meg got her hair done every three weeks. Jen is basically family. Lately, with kids, it was a luxury she rarely indulged in. 

And she looks amazing in curls. 

“Oh, Jen.” She said. There it was. That look again. Searching for details. Covering up. 

“She’s still there?” I asked. Concerned. 

“Yeah. Of course.  She’s great. Kids growing up fast.”  She answered in stumbling way. 

“They do that.” I replied. I could tell she was bothered.  Not one to press on a weak spot.  

After what happened, I wish I had. Maybe everything that came after could’ve been prevented. 

The next morning, I checked the statue again. Curiosity got the best of me, as it often does. Despite the warnings of the consequences for the cat.  

The necklace. The statue hadn’t been wearing it before. 

A family heirloom, my grandma passed it to my wife on our wedding day.  A single sapphire pendant, set in gold, on a rose gold chain. 

The wood even had a faint blue hue where the stone sat.  The gold chain a faint gleam in the morning light.  Above it those dead eyes. Staring. 

She was making breakfast, humming a tune I hadn’t heard before. 

“What’s that?” As I kissed her cheek.  

“Pancakes.”  

“The tune” I said.  

She laughed. “Something I heard in the islands.”

I tried to force a laugh, but could taste bile in the back of my throat. 

“Hon, last night…” I said. 

“Wasn’t dinner incredible?” She interrupted. 

“It was.  But why didn’t you wear grandmas necklace?” I asked.  

That look again. 

“It, um, didn’t really go with my dress.”  She replied, flipping a pancake. 

“It’s upstairs in your jewelry box, right?” I asked, heading upstairs. 

What came out of my wife was more of a growl than words.  

I turned, shocked.  She looked at me from behind her curls with wooden, dead eyes.  Filled with enmity.  

I could see her canines.  

I took a step backwards.  She noticed, and snarled louder.  Picked up a knife from the counter. 

Just then the girls came down the stairs. Ready for school. 

“Pancakes!” Morgan yelled.

I grabbed her shoulder as she started running towards Meg. She looked at me, confused.  

“Mom made pancakes” Morgan said.  

“I did. Your favorite” Meg said.  Smiled. Eyes dead. 

Kate took a hesitant step forward.  Turned to me. 

“That’s not mom” Kate replied.  

“I know.”

Meg hissed again. 

“Into the car” I whispered to Kate. She nodded.  

They took steps backwards. 

“You girls need to eat” Meg said, menacingly. 

“Go!” 

The girls ran. Meg walked after, then ran.  I stood in her way.  She hit me with a strength that shocked me.  

I fell.  

She stood over me, humming that tune. Smiling with those canines. 

“This is my family now” she said.  

I struck her leg, hard. I heard the bone crack.  She fell to her knees. 

Stood and ran towards the table which had my keys.  

I grabbed them from our key bowl, and glanced back.  

I wish I hadn’t. Meg stood on a broken leg, hair in her eyes. A rivulet of blood ran from her mouth.  

She growled, and charged.  Hit me with full force in the chest.  

It knocked me back, through the front window, into the yard.  

Took away my breath. I lay there, dazed.  

Heard the car start. Then heard Kate. 

“Daddy, let’s go”. 

She was trying to be brave. I stood.  Saw my wife, or what used to be her, standing in the window.  

Bloodied. Feral.  

I hobbled to the car. Somehow Kate had known how to start it.  

I put it into gear.  

As I drove away, I looked into the rearview.  Meg sat there,  knife in hand, receding from view.  

After a few miles, I turned on the radio.  It was the island song, like Meg was humming. Frantically I switched from station to station. The same song.  

I drove a few hours then reached a motel. 

I’m sitting here now, on the bed.  The girls asleep in one bed.  

I don’t  know what to do. File a police report?

From the room next door, someone just turned on the TV.  

I can hear the music through the wall. 

The island tune.  

I see those cold, dead eyes. 

Hear her last words. 

It’s my family now.  

I don’t know what to do.
