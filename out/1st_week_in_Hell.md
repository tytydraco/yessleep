At this point , if you read the 1st post, you know the the 1st 2 days of married life,  my brand new husband completely flipped. Treating me like property and ordering me around.

Nate wanted me to be a stay at home wife and take care of our kids before we got married. His military disability got approved right before we married. Five days after our wedding this was the topic of a large fight.

"When my military disability checks start coming in I'm going to quit my job and be a stay at home Dad." Nate told me. I giggled assuming he was joking. Military disability is not like goverment disability, a person can be able to fully functioning in the civilian world and have full military disability.

Nate stared at me , "I'm going to quit my job when it comes through and you WILL keep working."

"The hell I will. I like my job, I like to pull my own weight, I like to contribute to the family but I'll be damned if a perfectly able body man is gonna sit on his ass at home and I'm going to be expected to work."

"I'll take care of the kids and the house. You can find a different job so you aren't working overnights. I want you in bed with me at night."

"You know there are no other shifts available at my department. Overnights is where I'll stay, besides I'm home and awake the whole time my kids are."

"You WILL change jobs, you work with all men and you are never at home in bed with me. I'll stay home and be available to the kids while you work." He was so matter of facted, like a father talking to a child.

"I will not change jobs because you don't want me around other men. There is a national wide critical shortage of police dispatchers. I love my job, the people I work with and I like the shift and I have amazing benefits. "

Nate slammed his drink down and stood up, shoved his chair hard behind him and leaned over me. "You WILL do what you are told. Wives obey their husbands." He was so angry he was shaking though his voice remained low his tone was stern, demanding and intimidating. 

"I am a human being and I am capable of making my own decisions. I will be keeping my job as long as you keep working. If you quit your job I will quit mine too and we will struggle before I support a man who wants to sit on his ass and be supported by a woman's labors." I hissed through clenched teeth. Apparently, over the last 3 years I had recovered some of my backbone and was able to stick up for myself.

He grabbed the throw pillow from beside me and thew it at the wall and stomped up the stairs. I grabbed my keys and left. It was a couple hours before my shift was suppose to start, but I had no where else to be and I took a long drive on my way to work. My emotions somewhere between fear and rage. 

I got to work early, one of my officers saw me in the break room and questioned why I was at work so early. He got a brief run down of Nate showing up for drop off and the argument of the night.

Pd942 talked to me. He tried to calm my fears and told me how when him and his wife first got married they had issues with jealousy. "It just takes some adjusting. He needs to be careful though , Guy would have been well within his legal rights to have shot him.
You need to be careful too. He could get better but you know how this sort of thing progresses. He's trying to intimidate you, isolate you and if he's throwing things he's not far from hitting you."

"I know all of that. I don't want to give up already. This is fucking crazy. He was so good before I married him. I don't understand what changed. "

Pd942 advised " He may just be having a hard time adjusting. People have ideas about what marriage looks like and marriage rarely is what they expect. Don't stay just to stay, be willing to run if it gets worse."
 
In defeat I quietly say, "It's already this bad and I haven't even moved in yet. Our house won't be ready for another 2 weeks. Every time I see him there is an argument, he keeps getting angrier."

"You always have us," Pd942 says, "our dispatchers take care of us and we take of of our dispatchers. Any of us are only a phone call away."

The next day after not being able to see Nate, he decided to meet me at work and bring me lunch and energy drinks, the latter of which is far more important for a nightshifter than food. Nate walks me inside and down the stairs to the door of comm center, we passed Pd942 on the way. 

"Why is that officer glaring at me?"

"He's just intense he wasn't glaring." I say in defense of Pd942.

No one is allowed in comm center without the proper credentials, so, Nate gives me a peck on the check and leaves me at the door.

It took 10 minutes from when Nate left for Pd942 to come into comm center. "Was that him? Is everything OK? Are yall better, or was that something else? He doesn't feel right, you learn to trust that feelings when you've done this job for a while. "

Typical officer, always insightful. He was absolutely right. Nate's act of kindness was heavily based in making sure I was were I said I was going. Since I had changed my location settings in Snap to only update when I used the app, and had decreased my snap use Nate had become more insistent on seeing me before work, or getting a video call on my drive to work. I wouldn't have stopped using snap if not for the fact he was the ONLY person I was allowed to have as a friend on snap, and he only wanted me to have it so he could keep tabs on my location.

I choose to lie, "No, we are better today. He wanted to make sure I had lunch." It wasn't a total lie. We hadn't fought and Nate did bring me lunch.

Pd942 left comm center after checking on me. "Glad to hear it's going better, I can be wrong sometimes." 

The door shut and I started to cry.

The following night, I stayed the night in my husband's home since I didn't have to work and my children were with their Dad's. Nate's home at this time  was too small for me and my children, there were not beds for them there or room for beds, so I was unable to stay with him on nights I had my children. Thank God for the small kindness of my kids not having to see how he acted.

This night Nate demanded I change my last name to his the following day.

"We've talked about this. We talked about it before we got married. I can't do that. My oldest 3 had their names legally changed to mine in my divorce from their Dad. THEY wanted MY name, they wanted that tie to me."

"They can change their last names to mine when they turn 18 then."

"No! Names are important they deserve their identity. I want to have the same last name as my children. My last name means something to me. It ties me to my dad who is an amazing man , and to my boys and I will not change my last name." 

He grabbed a towel off the back of the chair and threw it at me. Stood and started stomping back and forth. Voice raised as the went through drawers in the kitchen. And cabinets , opening and slamming them all . "I just always wanted my wife to have my last name. I thought you said you would. You promised we could talk about it. You've broken my heart. Not taking my name is shattering my heart. I don't think I'll ever feel we are married if you won't change your name."

"Then you will never feel married to me. I will not priortize your wants on this over my children. People can think my last name is the same as yours but legally it will remain the same as the boys."

Maybe I should have gave more. Maybe I am the unreasonable one. I wasn't acting out of defiance, but I can see why he would think I was.

He comes back to the front room, slams his drink down and a bowl of snacks and sits at his computer desk. "I can't believe you won't do this 1 thing for me. Your kids will get over it. "

"If they can get over it so can you. You are a grown ass man and I will not hurt my kids to appease you."

So angry he is shaking again, he yells, "You're hurting me though and I'm your husband. I am suppose to be your priority.  God, husband then children, you need to learn your place." He stands and thunders up the stairs. I hear the slam of the bedroom door and the crash of something on the floor followed by more heavy footsteps. Nate's still yelling but I can't make out his words. 

I grab my keys from the hook and leave, scared to see what more can come. The things he's thrown in my presence have been soft items, but it's a violent physical response to his anger.

I had only one place close by I could go at that hour. I drove to Guy's.  I called him on the way.

"Hey, Guy. I know it's your night with River and it's late and he's probably in bed, but can I come over."

"You're always welcome at my house. What's wrong? Are you crying?"

"I'll tell you when I get there, can I park in the garage?"

"What happened? I swear to God if he hurt you..."

I interrupt, "Nate didn't hurt me, but he'll be looking for me. I'll tell you about it when I get there."

Guy sighs before telling me " You can't park in the garage. I've got my car apart working on it, but you'll be safe here. I won't ever let anything happen to you while you're at my house." 

In this short phone call I ignore 5 calls from Nate.

I pull up at Guy's and park in the tree line. Guy jumped down from a branch of a tree near at the end of his drive way near the road.  Baby monitor on one hip, pistols the other and night vision binoculars hanging from his neck. I start to laugh at the comical sight .

"What?" Guy half whispers .

"Tactical Dad to the rescue, huh?" 

"River's asleep, I wanted to be able to hear if he needed me but I wanted to make sure fuck head wasn't pulling in behind you." Guy opens the garage door and we walk in. "So what happened?" 

I spill the nights story, while ignoring Nate's phone calls. I finish with " I'm just being to sensitive. My trauma from my 1st marriage is too much. I'm just paranoid."

"Tessie, that's fucking bull shit and you know if. If one of your friends were going through this you would have already ripped that man a new asshole and dragged her out of there. You're scared because you are tied to him and you're gonna have to deal with him again, you're scared to stand up to him because you know there will be repercussions."

I answer the phone call that is ringing in.

"Hi"

"Where are you?" Nate demands.

"Somewhere safe." 

"You were safe here." Nate's tone is still demanding and aggressive. 

"NO, I was not. You were again having a physical aggressive response to being angry." 

Guy starts to pace the garage throwing knives in hand.  The throwing knives,  or axes are his go to when anxious or troubled. He's being quiet because I'm on the phone and so pace with them is all Guy can do. 

"I'm tired of you telling  me what I am. I wasn't angry. My heart was shattered."

"OK, so you had a physical aggressive reaction to 'you're heart shattering'." I use a mocking tone when I say "heart shattering". He's already used this line on me and I don't like repeat lies, excuses, I don't know whatever this bull shitnis best identified as.

"I shouldn't have acted that way. Come back, I'm sorry." Nate doesn't ask he is still demanding.
"I'm trying somewhere safe tonight we can talk tomorrow."

"Where are you?"

"I don't believe I would be safe if I told you." I state.

"I'll find you then and we'll talk."

"That wouldn't be smart."

Guy slings a blade at the target hitting his mark as I hang up the phone. 
"Fuck head better not come here.  Our son is here and he is a threat to your safety and River's right now." Another knife embeds itself deep in the target. 

"I can stay somewhere else  I can figure something out "

"No,  I mean I am not making you stay here.  You are welcome to stay here though. You are safe here,  I want you here,  I want to know your are safe. You can sleep in my bed. I won't be able to sleep tonight ." I start to cut him off, knowing what I was going to say Guy continues, "Even if you leave I won't be able to sleep, I'll be on high alert all night. Sleep in my bed and if I find my eyes do get heavy I'll take the couch. I like to skep there from time to time anyways "

I crawl into bed ,exhausted from the emotional roller coaster that is bend married to Nate, and my phone dings.

Him: "My wife does not belong at another man's house. Leave NOW!"
Me: " No, I'm safe here and it's not like that."
Him: " Come outside"
Me: "I hope for your sake you're not that stupid to be parked outside his house. "
Him: "I drove by and I'm coming back by to check if you left"
Me: "I'm not leaving. You scared me,  you're scaring me now "
Him: "You have 30 minutes and I'll know if you don't leave. " 

I stay in bed, 30 minutes later my phone rings I ignore it. I'd followed by a text , "I warned you. We'll talk about this tomorrow. "

Guy comes inside,  " I'm pretty sure I saw fuck head's truck drive by 5 times since you've been in bed "

I say nothing of the messages besides to tell him Nate texted me that we'd talk about this tomorrow. Trying to easy Guy's mind while mine raced .
