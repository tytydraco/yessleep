Everyone has their story. Your mother’s memory about playing with a Ouija board when she was younger. Your father’s recollection of hearing noises while camping in the woods with friends. Your siblings’ tales of goblins and ghouls that you know deep down were only told to scare you. My dad had one before he passed, about a terrifying and ugly demon who lived in our family mansion for 19 years… Jacob, my older brother. But all jokes aside, I’m here to talk about mine.

It was around 2015, sometime in October. That year was particularly painful for my family as my father had finally lost his battle with cancer that Spring. He entrusted his estate to me, his only daughter, as I was set to take over his position in the family company. To make a long story short though, I let my brother, Jacob, his girlfriend, Veronica, and dog, Zeus, room with me in that mansion. The last thing I wanted to do was sulk around, all alone in Dracula’s Castle before my own inevitable demise. Even though it was spacious and probably worth more than the planet itself, there was always something so off about it; or rather something so incredibly off about the surrounding town, Darkhallow. Even the town’s name feels straight out of some Stephen King novel. There our estate stood, looming over the foggy, sleepy town perched upon the mountain like a gargoyle prepared to feast on unsuspecting prey.

It was particularly foggy driving up through the dense woods. Upon leaving the last few remnants of green foliage behind, the jagged curves and edges of the Kramer estate pierced through the melancholic moonlight. All was normal that night driving up to my childhood home. Jadis, the maid, and her husband Josiah, our groundskeeper, were just leaving for the night. Exiting my car, the air felt as if it meandered in a silent waltz with the amorphous fog engulfing the entire town. That silence however… it felt almost visceral, malignant, insidious. I had no real tangible reason to worry, but I couldn’t help feeling as if I *needed* to hurry to the two front doors. While rummaging through my keys, I finally spotted it. Sitting atop the ‘welcome’ mat laid a simple little CD; in red writing, its title practically announced, “The Lamb”.

Curiosity took over, begging me to bring the disk inside. I ended up making the worst decision of my life.

“What’s that?” Veronica, asked as I sauntered into the foyer.

“It’s… ***The Lamb***” I teased while presenting the simple disk to Veronica and Jacob. “It was in front of the door when I got home. You guys didn’t see who dropped it off?”

“Nah, I didn’t even know someone came today.” Jacob furled his brow while Veronica corroborated his testament.

My eyes fixated on the strange item now in my possession. “Hey, Jake. Can you go get my laptop from the kitchen?”

Veronica then sat down with me in the living room. Jacob wandered in with my laptop and I inserted the disk with haste. To be honest, I don’t fully know what I expected; maybe some awful local artist’s mixtape or something. But a video was the last thing on my mind for some reason. The laptop screen lit up with the static remnants of what was obviously once a VHS tape. The crackly screen occasionally gave way to a viewable image of a nun playing an acoustic guitar to a group of children. She kept singing the song “*Tonight You Belong to Me*”, a slightly creepy-in-retrospect oldie, almost as if she was on repeat. 

“What kind of fuck ass prank is this?” Jacob loudly bellowed as Veronica and I laughed at his intrusion. But just before I went to eject the CD and clear my laptop of any potential viruses, Veronica noticed something, “Her face…”

The nun in the video began to lose something about her, almost like an essence of “human” seemed to disappear. The only way I could describe it nowadays is as if her face slowly started to become AI generated, moving in unnatural and impossible ways. She no longer sang her song, but some demented version of it, like it was stuck on a short loop somewhere in the beginning and reversed. That was around the time I removed the CD and tossed it in the garbage. 

The next couple days were fairly normal, and Jacob left for work purposes for a week. Although I do recount the unexplained bumping and knocking at night that I could only ration away as the old mansion settling. Garbage day eventually came around, and off our trash went to the dump. That day definitely had a few more odd creaks around the mansion than normal but nothing that rang any alarm bells. It was roughly around two o’ clock in the morning when I felt Veronica nudge me awake. 

“Get up.” She hurriedly whispered while tugging my arm.

“Wha-”

Before I could even move, she all but yanked me out of bed. “Where’s the gun?”

“What? What do you need the gun for?” My eyes finally adjusted to the pitch black. Her eyes stared back at me displaying only primal fear.

“There’s *someone* in my room.”

I can’t even begin to explain the feeling. The closest that comes to describing it is like if my heart just ceased, like there was a giant cavity where it should be. I quietly grabbed the handgun from my nightstand and wandered out into the murky void of the hallway. The moonlight was no longer melancholic as it slithered through the windowpanes. Its malicious tendrils created unholy shapes out of the things in the dark. We silently reached her room, and I slowly grasped for the handle. Each crashing creak of her door sent chills down and up my spine, alerting my brain of some impending doom.

Her room was as silent as a crypt, but in no way did it feel as lifeless as one. Veronica flipped the light switch on and we scoured her room for anyone who might’ve been there. 

*Nothing*.

I heard her sigh out of relief as we left her room. But before I could even turn to face her, something clawed its way through the still air of the mansion’s hallways. *Creak*.

I hauled ass downstairs towards the noise, making my way through the twisting and oblique hallways, gun in hand. Veronica and I finally stopped in the kitchen, staring intently at the now wide-open back door. Sitting there on the kitchen island was a simple, small disk… “The Lamb”. 

Veronica got on the phone with the police as I closed and locked the back door. We turned on every light in that damn mansion and watched cartoons in the downstairs living room while waiting for the cops. The officers must’ve arrived twenty or so minutes later. We greeted Officer Reynolds, a pale man who looked like he did bodybuilding on the side, and Officer Carmichael, a friendly woman with darker skin. Reynolds and Carmichael did their rounds around the mansion, finding nothing. I remember Officer Carmichael talking to us while Officer Reynolds seemed fixated on something out in the backyard.

Officer Reynolds told the three of us that he would look outside while Carmichael continued taking our story. It must’ve only been about twenty seconds until all three of us jumped at the sound of Reynolds slamming the back door. He walked into view visibly shaking with his skin even paler than before. “*We need to leave*.” he uttered to Carmichael. And just like that, the two left. Needless to say, Veronica slept in my bed that night with Zeus.

Have you ever just felt like someone’s watching you even if no one’s there? That’s what the next day was like. Constant eyes peering from every shadow in that damned mansion. It was only made worse by Zeus’ newfound interest in the vents and closets. He’d give them his little sniffspections and then just… stare. Even the allure of treats couldn’t break him from whatever was entrancing him. That day, I tried going about my routine as best I could. I cleaned the east wing of the mansion with Jadis, cleaned the music room and locked it up, made a late breakfast, took Zeus outside, locked the music room up, watched TV, and then locked the music room up. That day was also accompanied by the occasional banging at the door, *knock, knock, knock*, always in threes. Always barren of a culprit.

“Jacob’s going to be gone an extra three days” Veronica alerted while I closed the music room door for what seemed like the tenth time that day.

“You told him about last night’s little spook, right?”

“Yeah, and of course he thinks we just spooked each other being alone.” She giggled. But I could still sense a feeling of terror in her eye. 

“You’re welcome to crash in my room for the time being.”

That house was already eerie enough as is prior to "The Lamb" showing up. A mansion that felt as old as time itself. Its architecture twisted and turned as its cavernous hallways felt like they led to endless voids of shadow. The foyer opened like a castle into a dark unknown as the chandeliers leered overhead. Those open, cavernous rooms carried the echoes of those three knocks as the clock struck midnight. Veronica perked up from the ottoman she was lounging on, her nose no longer buried in the Brandon Sanderson novel she was reading. We stared at each other long enough to communicate without a single word spoken. *Who the hell was at our door at this time of night?*

She lunged from her seat and made haste towards the nightstand, grabbing the handgun. I clutched onto the bat from my closet and we both wandered through the jagged halls of murky black. The both of us quietly crept across the carpeted landing of the grand staircase and traversed down into the foyer. The front doors loomed before us, their haunting windows gazing upon us both like prey. But the strange part is how nothing stood outside in the misty moonlight. *Nothing* was at our door. I should’ve called the cops again as a precaution, yet I felt silly for entertaining that idea with nothing being at the mansion. Veronica huffed as the shape of her white nightgown fluttered back up the staircase; I quickly followed suit. 

We were back within the dim, marmalade light of my bedroom within a matter of seconds. “Should we call a psychic?” Veronica rubbed her hands together as worry plastered her freckled face. I meandered over to the vanity, bags staining the underside of my eyes. “Don’t tell Jacob. He’s *so* gonna make fun of us.”

*Knock… knock… knock.*

I felt the blood freeze under my skin. Veronica stared at me with a crazed panic seeping into her eyes. It wasn’t at the front door this time. It was at my bedroom door. My fingers ached from the frost that now enveloped them. Zeus stood and stalked toward the bedroom door, the hair down his back sticking straight up like spines. I slowly stood from the vanity with the bat as Veronica readied the handgun. My trembling hands forcefully swung the door open as Veronica took aim out into the nothingness of the mansion’s vast hallways. The hallways lingered with emptiness, but that *presence* from the night before persisted.

I don’t know fully what it was, but both of us had the feeling that that door needed to be shut, and we need not speak of what just happened. Something was playing with us. Or was it taunting us? Either way, giving it the attention it sought would’ve only made it more active. We simply tried our best to sleep. Every howl of wind outside woke me, chairs morphed into *things* in the dark corners of my room, and every snap of the house settling echoed like footsteps down the hallway just outside.

The next morning, I met with Jadis and cleaned the west wing. I put my books back up on their shelves, replaced the tablecloth in the dining room, vacuumed the game room, and put my books back up on their shelves. Night eventually rolled around and I said my goodbyes to Jadis and Josiah. The foyer fell silent as I glided my way up the carpet of the staircase and wandered down the twisting hallways. The shapes tuckered away within the maroon wallpaper formed dancing little spirals leading back to my nightly safe haven.

Already tucked away under the sheets was Veronica. The comfort of another person being there lent to a swift whirl of sleep. Night crept on until something stirred me from my dreams. Paws hit the floor outside my bedroom and jogged to the other end of the hall. I quietly maneuvered from under the sheets and tiptoed to my door. I questioned to myself what I was doing, but the unmistakable clinks of a dog collar emanated through the hallway. My hand moved without thought, jutting my door open.

I tried my best to peer down the hallway but couldn’t make anything out in the pitch black. I looked like a total cliche as I grabbed the electric lantern from atop my dresser and slowly wandered down the hallway in my blue robe. I finally managed to reach the corner of the hallway and gazed down at the end. Pawing at Veronica and Jacob’s door was Zeus. His little claws dragged on the door as if desperate to escape the darkness of the mansion’s hallways.

“Psst. Zeus!” I loudly whispered as my voice bounced back and forth off the hallway's mahogany walls.

Zeus then lunged his head back to look at me from the moonlight. Something was extremely off about that movement, almost as if Zeus didn’t know his own strength, breaking his neck to look for me. His eyes shone through the piercing moonlight just staring at me. He finally stood up and turned his body around to face me. That’s when I noticed what looked like foam spewing from his mouth in the shadows.

“Zeus? Come here!” I worriedly whispered at him.

His piercing eyes then seemed distracted from my presence, slowly looking towards the deep, black hallway behind me. That’s when I heard the pitter patter of paws and clinking of a dog collar saunter up behind me as Zeus and Veronica emerged from the hallway.

“What are you doing, Amy?” She asked as I froze, looking at the Zeus who now stood at my side peering down the hallway.

I couldn’t respond to her; I could only point at the other dog standing at the edge of the shadows across the hall. Veronica’s eyes went wide as she noticed the creature within our mansion. It began to lurch forward as if just learning how to walk. Its broken waltz faded into the shadows of the hallway where the moonlight couldn’t reach. Zeus let out a deep growl as the creature merged into the murky shadows. We could only stand there as still as the dying air until a crackling made itself known. My eyes lit with a fear I’ve never known since as the crackling emerged from the shadows and closed in towards us. Brokenly lunging down the hallway was the twisted unearthly silhouette of what should’ve been a person. Its arms extended before it with disturbing cracks as its spine and head slithered in unnatural motions. The foam spewing from where its mouth was splurged onto the ground... *maggots*. Its stench wafted into the air after us. Veronica Hauled Zeus into her arms, and we took off down the hallway, through the foyer, out the front doors and into my car.

We stayed at a friend’s house in town for the night and called a medium in the morning. The state of our mansion when we met up with the sweet old woman was disturbing. Claw marks down the hallways, paint scratched off the wooden doors, every single door busted open, and “The Lamb” blaring through my laptop speakers… its haunting reversed song slinking down the mansion corridors. It goes without saying what the source of the haunting was, and the medium left with “The Lamb” securely tucked in her bag.

I don’t know if she still has that cursed disk with her all these years later, or if it made its way to someone else’s life. But I can only thank her for removing it from ours. I fear that if we kept it, we’d discover what "The Lamb" was in reference to. Whoever owns that disk now… Do. Not. Play. It.
