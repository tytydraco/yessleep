They say the Appalachians are older than trees. That the rock that formed them has been around for five hundred million years. In that time, something unnatural has evolved there to be the perfect predator. 

At least that’s my theory. There was never an official investigation launched. I won’t mention the name of the company, I signed 6 different types of NDA’s. What I can say, is despite everything being state of the art, and the company being relatively brand new, all branding, references, and imagery for the company I worked for when it happened no longer exists. I mean I’m sure I could find it if I scrubbed deep enough, but from what I gathered, they now exist as a completely different entity. It scares me to think what they may be unearthing still.

When I arrived, it was 2022. I had recently gotten my Master’s degree in robotics from Northeastern. My recruitment was by chance, my thesis matched the exact project they were working on. 

“Thermal Insulation Strategies for Sustained Robotic Functionality in Sub-Zero Environments”

I made it sound as pretentious as possible. Hey, it worked.

About a week after presenting and defending my thesis, I got an email for a job offer. The whole process was unassuming. Interviews, conversations, everything totally normal. My job was going to be working on different insulation methods for ambulatory robotics. Think boston dynamics, four-legged machines. I was stoked to find a job in my field so quickly, I didn’t even care the location stated was a remote ridge in the Smoky Mountains. I signed on immediately.

When they said remote, boy they meant it.

No roads led to the facility, the only way in or out was by helipad, although I did see snowmobile patrol a handful of times. I didn’t think much of it at the time, we were going to be working on pretty advanced stuff, and pretty much everybody assumed it was for military application. As such, we kept our mouths shut and kept at work. 

My team’s main job was to keep our robots operational in the winter snow without lock-up or freezing of the joints. We had made pretty good progress in the time I was there. One night, we made a particularly big breakthrough with battery capacity. It was so big in fact, we decided to celebrate the only way young, awkward robotics engineers knew how. Lots and lots of drinking. 

That was the night it happened.

I’ll give as many details as I can remember. My three buddies were drinking with me in my room. We’ll call them Elliot, Josh and Hasan. At this point, we had been friends for about a month and a half, and had gotten close fast, as we spent almost all day together as a group. Elliot and Josh were drinking much more heavily than either Hasan or I, and at some point in the night had dared each other to brave the cold outside for five minutes without a shirt on. 

Now, nobody ever went outside at night. We had barely any lighting, and on top of the cold and the dark, if you managed to stumble off the catwalk between buildings, there was a real risk of falling off a ledge or causing an avalanche. Upper management gave us all a big, clear, fuck no for night-time outdoor recreation. If you absolutely HAD to go outside, you were ordered to bring a walkie and a headlamp, which is how Elliot and Josh convinced us to go through with their wager.

I remember knowing I couldn’t convince them not to go through with it, but I could at least get them to wear a headlamp and bring a walkie just in case anything went wrong. They happily agreed to my concession, and stripped down immediately. I badged us into the utility room and grabbed walkies and headlamps for all of us. We put the walkies to our own channel so the security staff wouldn’t chew us out, and got going. The plan was for Hasan and I to wait just outside the door and keep on eye on Elliot and Josh as they tried to outlast each other. 

Everyone agreed. We opened the door.

It was unbelievably cold. I remember feeling like needles were hitting my exposed face, the wind-chill was almost malicious. I could only imagine how the guys were feeling.  Despite it all, they were smiling and laughing as they went further and further down the catwalk, taunting each other with every name you could think of. Hasan and I were laughing too, enjoying the absurdity of it all. That joy lasted about a minute before I saw Josh take his first step off the catwalk.

As soon as he did it, I lost sight of his body, the lights from the path no longer illuminating him. All I saw was his headlamp moving further away into the snow. In the next second, I looked back to where Elliot was standing. It was just dark, I couldn’t see him at all.

Immediately I radio’d both. 

“Elliot, Josh, you guys alright?”

Agonizing silence for what felt hours, all the while both Hasan and I could see Josh’s headlamp head further and further downhill away from us. 

Hasan and I looked at each other, and simultaneously ran into the dark after them, screaming both of their names. The wind took our voices with it, and it seemed we were only whispering. We got to the spot where we lost them, and there was no sign of Elliot or his things anywhere. The only evidence of Josh was the trail his body had made in the snow, but his headlamp was becomingly increasingly erratic, and farther away.

I radio’d once more.

“Josh, Elliot, stop fucking around lets go back in now!”

Again, nothing.

Hasan looked at me with the fear of death. We both knew this wasn’t a prank, and whatever was happening, we were now exposed too. I tried to comfort him with a hand on the shoulder, but told him sternly,

“Get inside and get the CSO out here now, tell him Josh got drunk and wandered off the mountain, I’ll find Elliot.”

I pushed him towards the door, and he went running down the catwalk. I watched him go inside, and I was out there, alone.

Everything after happened within the span of five minutes. I looked towards where the closest building was. It was the “North Ridge”, which I was told houses the extended staff that used the facility primarily in the springtime. It was empty at the moment, and hoped beyond hope that I’d find Elliot inside. I walked a couple steps over and badged in. 

I remember the door slammed behind me. I flipped on the lights, but the generator for this building barely gave the bulbs any luminance. It was like walking through a grey haze, and the brutal metal architecture made it feel all the more unnatural. 

I was starting to get really antsy, and I radio’d for both of my friends,

 “Pick up”.

As I walked down and checked out every room for signs of Elliot, I kept the same radio call every ten seconds or so.

“Pick up”.

The routine pushed me on, through room after room.

“Pick up”.

Again, and again, until I heard anything.

“Pick up”.

The walkie crackled in response. I jolted to attention, and from the other end, I heard,

“Shhhhhhhhh”.

I’ll never forget the sound. A clear, human shush. Only us four had walkies at this time, on this channel. Elliot and Josh, as stupid as they could be, would never mess around this far. 

I waited, frozen in fear. Nearly crying now, I radio’d again,

“Pick up”.

Several moments of silence, and then, not out of the walkie, but in the building, I heard it once more.

“Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhh”

My head snapped to where I heard it from. Through a doorway, and behind a table, I could barely see Elliot slumped down. Not hurt, but looking almost catatonic. As I took a step towards him, several things happened at once.

First, Elliot screamed. Not a shrieking scream, but a despair filled, low scream from his stomach. As he did that, I saw the outline of a hand come from one end of the room and stretch to where he was. It was an impossible reach, I don’t know how else to describe it, and time seemed to slow down as it crossed over the room. It enveloped Elliots face, and it changed him. 

This part fucks me up the most. Everything else my brain can almost rationalize. But I saw my friend’s features fold inward like a soft cloth. 

His eyes, nose and mouth folded in, and flattened into nothing, and then came back.

I screamed. Primal, guttural, animal screams came out of me as I ran out of that building and back outside. I’m ashamed, but I never even turned to look back or thought for another second about helping Elliot after that. I still carry that weight with me.

I bolted out of North Ridge and onto the catwalk. To my surprise, there were maybe 10 fully equipped soldiers heading towards me with weapons drawn. Two of them grabbed me
while the others proceeded into the building. As I was being taken away, I listened for gunfire. There wasn’t any the rest of the night.



They never found Elliot. At least that’s what they told me. They said that they found Josh’s frozen body huddled in the snow several hundred yards down the mountain. His headlamp was still on, and he didn’t have his walkie on him.

Of course they questioned me about everything that happened, but strangely, my interviewers didn’t act incredulous when I told them about the shush, or the hand, or Elliots face. They simply nodded and wrote it down, and asked for more details. They didn’t ask me to talk to the cops, just to sign an NDA so that the company would not be linked to any of the alleged circumstances that occurred that night.

That got me thinking of so many more questions. Why would this not become an immediate investigation? How were ten uniformed soldiers immediately there within five minutes, when this was a remote scientific facility? What was the real purpose of the North Ridge building? And come to think of it, how did my badge even work to get in? 

Theres so much more I wish I could tell you all that I feel would link some loose ends together, but my hands are tied, and quite frankly I’d like to forget most of it. I still do robotics work in the Northeast, but I will never go anywhere near those mountains again. I suggest you don’t either.
