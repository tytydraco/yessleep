I woke up to another day of my father and mother arguing again.

And not to my surprise when they heard me wake up they came rushing into my room and blamed it on me, my

 mother was yelling so loud in my face that I could feel the saliva falling onto my face, my father immediately

 after my mother stopped yelling at me grabbed a belt from his room and came back to mine and beat me with

 it Merciously while laughing and saying you're such a mistake your mom should have used a Curtain hanger

 and Aboarded you as soon as we figured out you was a thing. All along while my dad was beating me, my mother

 was looking at me with all the fear and pain I had in my eyes and was enjoying it with every fiber in her Being it

 even look as if she was feeling Exquisite happiness from seeing me in absolute pain. After my father figured out I

 was having signs of blacking out, he stopped and said, "Go to school, boy. I don't want to see your face, and I

 knew if I just laid there and curled up and cried from the tremendous beating I just received, he would do it all over

 again and wouldn't stop untill I would have to go to the hospital. I got up and put on the only other set of clothing

 I owned, which was my school clothes, and I went to school and did my work throughout the day and finished

 the day out and went home. This cruel, unjust cycle went on until my 19th birthday, and mind this, the beatings got

 worse the older I got, my father wouldn't just beat me any more the older I got he would torture me my father

 would take me down to the basement and would tie me to my deceased great grandmother's rocking chair and

 find the most Diabalical thing his twisted mind come up with the torture devices where different every year

 Progressing As my body grew more and more mature and this way my father thought that if he did it this way,

 he wouldn't have to deal with a murder case. On my 19th birthday, this all changed. I was the latest to graduate

 from my high school, and that's all because of my parents. On this day of graduation, I went to the

 auditorium and was waiting to hear my name, which was called to get my high school diploma 2 hours later, right

 when my name was called time froze and everything in the room went dark then I seen it a 7.2 foot tall  Ominous

 Creature I can only describe as a 2 headed goat with a body of a deformed goal its long black razor sharp

 bloody claws where longer than the horns of its head, by the time I was done trying to figure out what the hell just

 happened and what the fuck is the Creature looking at me from the across the auditorium it was already

 standing in front of me and it spoke to words "life" or "death" and the loudest thing I could muster out of my

 mouth was life in a week raspy voice was life, it said so be it and it disappeared and time resumes the principle

 of my high school finished calling my name and I headed up to get my high school diploma no one clapped or

 yelled YAA because Noone likes the quiet scarred kid that never talks to anyone and just does his school work

 and my parents where probably off at at bar or my mother was cooking dinner for just them both of them

 and my father was probably getting ready to torture the happiness out of the new and improved high school

 graduate. on my way home I seen what as I can Describe it in human Words as demons coming out of every nook

 and Cranny from every ally and house and started walking behind me and for once in my whole entire life I

 felt loved and looked out for the large demon I seen at first in the auditorium walked up right beside me and said

 you chosen life and that's what you will receive after it said that I said in a Farley confident voice why, why would

 you all help me and all the demons said in tandem in load
 bold words "you have felt are pain and your time to die is

 not near yet" and then I told my self in my head I'm not going to die I'm just going to be tortured. I was getting

 closer and closer to my mother and father's home and I can swear I see my dad on the porch with a 12 gage

 shotgun looking both ways as if he was trying to find an intruder that just robed his house, I stopped when I seen

 that and the main demon pushed me forward and said you will Perville so I mustard up all my confidence and

 bravery and kept walking to my shotgun Wilding father, by the time he seen me it was to late for him all the

 demon full on sprinted towards him and ripped him apart his guts they where Spewed all over the roof of the house

 and his heart was getting eaten by a very hungry demon all the demons one by one ate his Mutilated scattered

 body piece by piece. My mother, on the other hand, was a whole different setting they all pounced on her and dug

 through the ground to where I thought was hell after I witnessed that the demon from the auditorium walked up

 to me and said iT... iS... DoNe... with blood dripping from its mouths and then disappeared along with all the others 

 23 years later, the day my family got brutally murdered by demons was the most happiest day of my life
