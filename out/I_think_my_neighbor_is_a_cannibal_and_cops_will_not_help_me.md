I want to start off by defending myself, as I have done questionable things. I understand that I’m not the good guy in this situation, but clearly, I’m not the one eating people if that's what is happening. I have problems, but my problems are under control for the most part. I have these desires or an impulse. Occasionally when I’m in class I will notice a skirt that grazes far above the knee if you know what I mean. Like showing a bit of... I’m not sure of the scientific word but lower ass cheek or shorts that look almost glued onto a woman's body. There was this girl in particular named Mandy in one of my bio classes two years ago that wore skirts and never crossed her legs. On her right inner thigh, she had this tattoo of a chihuahua, that looked closer to that taco bell dog from the 90s. I have looked far longer than I should have, hoping I get even a peek at what's underneath. I’m a voyeur if you need to put a label on things, but I would never really act on these impulses, I’m not lifting up skirts, or doing anything creepy like the stories I have heard, just watching. It's just something that lingers, a voice in the back of my head I can’t shut off.  


  
I live on the bottom floor of a three-story house in a good neighborhood, I rent so it is fairly cheap. This is the type of place where neighbors know each other by name, and at night things are so quiet that we start to know each other's problems as well. I listen, I peek out my window, and I observe.   


  
So I need to talk about my backyard, it is big and I can see into three of my neighbor's top floors. My backyard lights would be off and there is nothing but darkness, but I could see into the floors of their houses. So we have the left window which is mostly just someone on their laptop at all times of the night, then in the middle, you have the Antenalies master bedroom. On several occasions, I have witnessed undressing and outright sex. I felt they were leaving the window open because they wanted to be watched, but you probably don’t want to hear about that stuff.   


  
So the house on the right is weird I have lived here for over a year and this place runs like a machine. At 7:00 PM, the lights go out. But, once a month between the 15th-19th of the month, At 9:00 PM he will just leave. His car is loud and screeches when it backs up. So he will return anywhere from 10:00 PM to as late as 4:00 AM. I know what you are probably thinking, that doesn’t mean he is a cannibal. Please just hear me out. It is the 18th, a little after 9:00 PM and the guy leaves his house. So that voice in my head I mentioned started pulsing at me, the Antenalies are home, well at least the wife. She is taking off her earrings as I stare out my window, and none of my room lights were off. She looks at me, and I can’t look away despite how badly I want to hide. She removes these red high heels that almost looked like glass. Her dress goes down, and I can see this black lacy bra and white “granny” panties. They did not match. Her husband comes behind her, kisses her… Sorry, I understand this is not what you want to hear but it's important.   


  
Mr. Antenalie has sex with her, pretty sure one or both of them knew I was watching and I watched, not only did I watch but I moved closer hiding in the darkness of my backyard, nothing better to do on a Thursday in August.   


  
I started smoking a joint in my backyard, a while ago. It is about 9:50 PMish and I’m smoking and watching them cuddle a bit. I understand that if I focused on having a real relationship instead of these fantasies maybe I could have that too. That is when the guy returns. I have never seen him before today, so I peaked at what he looked like. I had no idea what he looked like. He looked how you would imagine a villain in a kung-fu movie would look. He had dirty blonde hair, and pale skin,  and looked to be in his mid-40s. His car which I was just seeing for the first time was an old car, I don’t know much about cars it just looked old and blue like a muscle car Dom from Fast & the Furious would own but with black windows. So he drives his car close to his backyard, where I guess neighbors couldn’t see him exit and he is dragging a barely conscious woman, who looked kinda young with black hair and long legs, she kind of looked like a classmate named Mandy. The lights turned on, his backyard light must have had one of those sensors. I saw a chihuahua tattoo on this person's leg, watching is what I do and that tattoo was a 1:1 exact copy. The girl just seems out of it, and she is practically being carried by him. The door shuts and I’m way too high and starting to freak out a bit.  


  
When I wake up the next day, I peek through the cracks of the fence while casually drinking my coffee, and can see this man in his kitchen with… Meat… Stacked piles of meat in plastic bags he was putting into the refrigerator.  


  
The following week, I bring this up with my kinda close friend named “Kimi” not her real name but she asked me to use that name because of Rugrats. So we talked about school work, weekend plans, and such but nothing as serious as this prior. She dismissed it until the following week she hits me up on Facebook, saying “This girl has the same name as the girl you told me about” it was a missing person's post shared on the Facebook marketplace.  


  
So at this point, I’m trying to add all the facts, and the best I could come up with was she was still in that house, or she was in his refrigerator. The man's car had not moved since the 18th. So Kimi asks if she could crash at my house before I go to the cops. I explained everything other than the voyeurism. She spent the night on the 17th, I slept on the floor she slept on my bed. We watched movies and played until dawn and I drove her to school in the morning. She couldn’t come over on the 18th, but I promised to take a video, I wanted to smoke and she explained it was not the best choice considering. On the 19th she returned, and we were both laying on my bed just talking when the screech of the car backing up could be heard. We rushed to the backyard, and both watched together, it felt validating if that makes sense.   


  
About an hour and a half later the man returns, and parks near the same spot but this time he carried a man who looked Latino, his shirt was shiny and as the backyard's lights went on it reflected like a stop sign. This man seemed to be struggling, the back screen door opened and closed. We quietly went back to my room. Kimi was distrot, I offered to take her home but she refused. She asked if we should call the police, so we did it anonymously. We saw the red, and blue lights, heard the knock on the door, and heard conversations and laughter, the cops entered the house, and within 10 mins left. Nothing happened as the Latino man was never there. She asked me to sleep on the bed with her, and I did. It was more of “I don’t feel safe” than an “I like you as more than a friend”. Keep in mind at the time I didn’t feel safe in my own room. So this is when things start going bad, bad-bad so to speak. We did not see a flyer or anything but are certain he is killing and eating people, leaving once a month like a werewolf, he is not a werewolf, I’m just saying its a once a month thing. This is really hard for me to say.  


  
I wanted to stop, if he was killing people what could we do, nothing right? But Kimi was persistent. So we started writing down everything we saw. We made a plan, this plan was for next month around the same gap, she would spend the night, and as the man left we could enter through his backdoor and take pictures of whatever we could find.   


  
October comes around and on the 19th, his vehicle screeches. Days prior we drew straws and Kimi, had to go in while I watched for cover. Watching, The thing I was good at. So she hops the fens opens the backdoor and closes it. I get radio silence from her, I send her multiple texts still nothing. The man pulls into his driveway as I’m texting and calling her, and nothing.   


  
I’m terrified and call the police who think it is a prank call, I call the police again and again until they finally come at which point it is hours later and nothing is done. I’m scared shitless, I pissed myself waiting by the fence and had begun to cry. I get a knock on my window, it is pitch black and my blatter releases a second time. But then I hear her voice, Kimi’s voice opening the backdoor, I drag her to my room and embrace her. I can’t stop crying, everything is leaving my body at an alarming speed. We both cuddle a bit under my bed until morning, it was hard to breathe but it felt safe. I tried asking her questions but couldn’t.  


  
When I awoke I looked out the window on the balcony of the house to the right, the man was standing looking at my window. I closed my blinds, got dressed for school, and peaked and he was still looking at my window. We went to school and she told me she found a bunch of teeth, in the freezer. She tried taking a picture but stumbled. She got lost in the house, feeling she was being watched finally leaving after the cops provided her a distraction.  


  
The next few days were the same, in the morning the man would now be watching my window from his balcony. After two weeks, his car was gone while I was coming back from school. Kimi stopped showing up to school. I stopped by her house to find her mother in tears, saying her daughter was missing. It seemed wrong for me to tell her my theories. Last night 11/6/2022, I looked outside my window, and even though it was pitch black I could see him out there, outside my window just waiting and watching me sleep in the darkness. The only thing between us was a thin pane of glass. and cheap blinds I bought off amazon.   


  
I moved out, dropped out of my university, and was living with my sister. I wasn’t really planning on posting this but even though I’m in another city, even though it's only the 8th, I can still see him outside my window and he gets closer and closer every day. I don’t know how he found me, but my sister sees him too and I’m not crazy.   


  
I posted this on the Facebook missing page, and they removed it. I posted this on several subreddits and they removed it as well. I was told by an anonymous user that maybe someone here in the police, or FBI could help. I never returned to that city, but I can provide you with the info needed. I still have the teeth, Kimi gave me.  It is 12:43, and I can swear to you he is outside my window close enough to fog the glass with his breath, just mumbling. Please if you know someone who can help, reach out to me, please.
