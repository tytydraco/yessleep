I learned about sacrifice from my mother. She always told me that God imbued mankind with free will, but that freedom was a gift, not a natural right. We were poor, living in a trailer on a secluded property in Montana. It was the kind of land that could have been quite beautiful with some care and cultivation; however, the state of the place was overgrown and littered. 

It was all I had known as a child. My father was a drunk and often abused my mother and me. He couldn't hold down a job due to a disability that left him with a severe limp and vocal challenges. Yet he still had enough strength to do damage to a child and a woman as small as my mother. 

We subsisted wholly off of government assistance and a little garden in the back, nurtured by my mom. She wasn't a good cook, and barely made it a point to care for me, but one thing she could do was tend a garden. She grew beautiful, lush baby tomatoes, carrots, spinach, and zucchini. On hot days, I would sit in the garden, plucking small red tomatoes and eating them like grapes. Popping them in my mouth and letting the sweet juice gush out. 

I still love them to this day. The secret to my mother’s successful growth in the garden was love, though maybe not in the way you might think. She would show me sometimes, in the heat of the day, as I watched her work. After sowing the seeds and providing them with plenty of water, she would cut the palm of her hand with a kitchen knife and let the blood run onto the soil.

The dark red color would drip down into the earth and become one with the ground. She told me that sacrifice brings forth the blessings of heaven. Every spring, she would complete this ritual, and every time the plants would yield forth their unnatural bounty. One day, as I sat in the garden crushing the tomatoes in my mouth, I could hear my parents get into an argument inside. 

My mother came outside with tears streaming down her face and bruises on her arms. “Your father's an asshole, Kenny,” she sobbed. I buried my face in her shirt. “I'd do anything to protect you, Mom,” I told her. 

“Do you really mean that, buddy?” she asked. “Ye- Yeah. Of course, mommy”. I meant it, too. I hated seeing her upset and in pain. “There is something we can do, Kenny. Something that can fix all of our problems. I've always been too afraid to do it, but since you're offering, maybe you can help us.” 

I didnt know what she was talking about, but I nodded my head and continued to squeeze her tight. Later that night, she came into my room and sat down on my bed, looking at me with a sense of serenity. “Kenny, I love you so much. And it makes me so proud that you are willing to help me. You still want to help, dont you?” I shook my head yes. 

“Okay, buddy. But I want you to know that sometimes when we want to fix things, it comes at a cost. Like how I help the garden grow. You remember how I make the garden grow?” I thought about how much time she spent out there, pulling weeds, watering the plants, literally giving a part of herself to the ground. “I…I think so. You sacrifice for it.” 

“That's exactly right, buddy, I sacrifice for it. And the best thing to sacrifice for is family. Do you love this family?” Her questions made me feel anxious, as if each one had a more complicated meaning than the one I was understanding. “Yeah, I do, Mom. I love you, and I love Dad even though he hurts me sometimes.” 

“That's a good boy,” she said, combing her fingers through my hair. “In that case, you need to sacrifice for us. Because that's how you get things to grow. It's how you make things better. She pulled out a pair of scissors from behind her. 

I hadn't even noticed that she had them when she entered the room. “Wha-what's that for?” I asked, trembling a little. “Now, Kenny,” she said, a little disappointed. “It's for the sacrifice. You do want to help, dont you?” I felt nauseous. “I'm not sure anymore. Yeah, I think so.” 

“Good. Then give me your hand. I'll make it quick.” She grabbed my hand quickly and held it tight, making me gasp in surprise. Before I knew what was happening, she snipped the tip of my ring finger at the knuckle. I dont remember exactly what happened next. I think I passed out, though I dont remember waking up

The next thing I remember was being back out in the garden a week later. I don't know what she did with my finger, but I do know that things have gotten better. My father didnt hurt my mother or me anymore. He didnt really speak after that either. 

The best way I can describe it is that from that time on, he became inanimate. He sat on the couch and watched TV, and my mom fed him dinner with a spoon. When it was time for bed, she would lie him down on the couch, take off his shoes, and kiss him on the forehead. He wasn't really a person at that point. 

Just another vegetable in the garden. The next sacrifice came the following year. My mom got a phone call from her sister informing her that Grandma was in the hospital. She had taken a pretty nasty fall, and the doctors were not optimistic about her recovery. 

I had never seen my mom so devastated. She would howl a sickly cry for hours on end. We didnt have a car, and we were unable to visit grandma in the hospital. I didnt know how to feel. I didnt know my grandma that well, but I knew that she was family, so the thought of her slowly passing away in a hospital far away made me sad. 

Again, my mother came into my room asking for a finger. This time, I fought back a little more, but it wasn't very fruitful. She took the pinky this time. After the healing process was over, I began to take pride in the sacrifices I had made. Grandma made a full recovery and actually lives to this day, though she can't eat, walk, or talk. She never could after the night of my sacrifice. 

A few more years went by, and more problems arose that needed fixing. With my dad incapacitated, I was beginning to feel like the man of the house, and my sacrifices became more willing. I even offered the idea of a sacrifice on my own accord once. My mother was so grateful, and the outpouring of love from her was everything I could have ever wanted or needed as a child. 

But the bountiful harvest can only last so long. When the ground yields forth its fruit and it is taken up, it requires more. By the time I was 15, my mother began bringing other men home. I told her how much this bothered me, seeing as my dad was still very much alive and married to her. 

She gave her best effort at explaining her motivations, but I wasn't a kid anymore. Kids will believe any reasoning their parents give them to be just and virtuous. Now, as a teenager who had given so much for our family, I was seeing through the bullshit. One night after her romantic partner had left and she had gone to bed, I crept out into the kitchen and retrieved the scissors for myself. 

My left hand was basically useless at this point, but my right still had 4 fingers left, and with some effort and an awkward balancing act with the shears on my knee, I made a sacrifice once again. I opted for the middle finger, leaving me enough on my right hand to perform simple tasks like eating with a spoon and writing. 

The next morning, I woke up to find my mother peacefully lying in bed, eyes wide open, but no longer willing to act for herself. She was right. Free will was a gift, and it is given to those who can use it wisely. On the eve of my manhood, while I was still gaining my will to act, I had taken hers. 

I wept for a long time over that decision, but I've come to realize that it was what was best for our family. As I type this, it has been many years since I was that little boy eating tomatoes in my mother’s garden. I no longer have toes, and the only fingers remaining are my pointer finger and thumb on my right hand. I mainly use text-to-speech these days. Modern inventions truly are a miracle. I wonder who had to sacrifice to make these dreams a reality.
