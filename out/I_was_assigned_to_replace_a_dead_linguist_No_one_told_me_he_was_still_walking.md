I should have known something was wrong when Captain Varni pulled me into his office. It was late 2005, maybe early ‘06, when the Iraq War had turned into an everlasting mess of patrols and ambushes around Baghdad. I was only a sergeant in the 4th infantry, a linguist who picked up Arabic, Kurdish and a bit of Farsi from a few years at the defense language institute. Most of my days were spent translating radio chatter or calming down locals during raids. Routine stuff. I was trying to just do my time and get the hell out of the army. I’d joined for the benefits, not the glory, then this war popped off and I got stuck.

The air that night was thick with diesel fumes. Varni looked haggard, his eyes were bloodshot under the flickering bulb of his makeshift office. “Sergeant Mullins,” he said not looking up from his desk, “you’re being reassigned. Effective immediately.”I blinked “Sir?, Reassigned where” “I dont know, but whoever it is, they are from the compound,” Varni said. His voice was flat, like he was reading a death notice. “ They lost their linguist, and you're the best we’ve got right now. Report to the compound at 0400. Thats all I know”The compound was a fenced-off brick building in the far corner of our forward operating base. We called it a *Don’t Look at Me* compound. You don’t look at it, you don’t talk about it, and if anyone asks you about it, you’ve never heard of it. The rumors ran from CIA to Special Forces to Blackwater contractors or something else entirely. 

I showed up at the gate at 0350. A man was already waiting for me. “You the talker?” he said, voice like gravel.

“Yes, sir. Arabic, Kurdish, and a bit of Farsi,” I answered, trying to keep steady.

His eyes scanned me, cold and measuring. “Good. You listen, you translate, you keep your mouth shut. Clear?” He turned without waiting for an answer. “Name’s Ramiel.”

The compound's interior felt wrong. The building was much colder than the night air.  And smelled faintly like damp stone. A smell that shouldn't have been anywhere near Baghdad. 

Ramiel led me down a narrow hallway with steel doors the whole time not saying a word, or even glancing at me. We stopped at the end of the hall and entered a small room. Inside, two people in desert camo stood around a folding table littered with satellite maps and photographs. 

“This is Sergeant Mullins,” Ramiel said. “Hes replacing Dr. Dyer” 

A woman in her late thirties looked up. Her eyes were sharp, but there was something behind them, maybe exhaustion, maybe fear. Nobody said what happened to Dr. Dyer. Nobody had to.

The woman slid an envelope toward me. Inside were two photographs. The first, grainy and dim, showed a carved stone arch buried in sand, symbols etched into it in an ancient script I didn’t recognize.

The second showed the same arch, but this time one word was clear in Akkadian: *Return.*

I tried asking Ramiel about what exactly what we were doing here, but he cut me off saying “You’ll know when it matters” 

A few hours later we rolled out in a battered civilian truck, no markings, no flags. The desert swallowed us fast, Baghdad’s orange haze shrinking in the rearview until there was nothing but black sky and white moonlight 

No one spoke. The woman, Dr. Hails, I’d learn, kept her eyes on the horizon. Her finger drumming against a Bible wedged in her lap. I couldn’t help but notice the way certain verses were underlined, the pages worn thin. I caught one glimpse when she turned a page. *“The dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.”*

Ramiel drove, knuckles pale on the wheel. Something about him made my stomach twist not fear exactly, but the sense that if I looked too long, I’d see something I shouldn’t. 

Next to me was a man who had not yet spoken. He was dressed in Army greens with a trauma kit slinged on his back, so I assumed he was our medic. I tried to talk to him but he just stared silently and I got the message.

We drove west for what felt like hours until we reached a small village, or what was left of it, near the Euphrates river. The locals became skittish when Ramiel hopped out of the car.

An old woman came up to me telling us in Arabic  “not to go” and that “The king’s shadow walks”. When I was about to respond Ramiel called me over and told me to stay close. That we would be on foot for the next few miles.

As we walked I wondered what the hell that old lady was talking about “Go where?” “What King?” “Did she mean Saddam?, Saddam had been captured and locked up for over a year now” 

The sun beat down on us brutally but I seemed to be the only one that was phased by it. 

The sand under my boots felt strange. Too soft in some places, almost like it had been turned recently. I kept telling myself it was just wind erosion, but the patterns didn’t look like the work of wind. I had been all over Iraq and had never seen sand like this. It looked almost deliberate. 

Ramiel led the way without slowing, his boots crunching over the cracked earth. Dr. Hails trailed close behind him, reading from a small notebook in one hand, the Bible still tucked under her arm. Every so often I caught her murmuring under her breath, but it wasn’t English, it wasn’t Arabic either. It sounded older, guttural, like the syllables had to be forced out of the throat.

The medic still hadn’t spoken. His eyes were fixed on the horizon, scanning the dunes like he was expecting someone, or something, to crest them at any moment.

After an hour, we passed what was left of a stone wall, half-buried in sand. The carvings on it were faded, but I could still make out fragments of cuneiform. My training kicked in. The words were broken, incomplete, but I read enough to feel my stomach drop: *The king crossed the waters, the king drank of the well, the king shall rise again.*

A few feet past the wall, we found bones. Human, by the look of them, bleached white from the sun. They weren’t scattered like a battle site they were laid out in a careful line, pointing toward the west.

“Don’t touch them,” Ramiel said without turning his head.

I wanted to ask how he even knew I was looking, but before I could, Dr. Hails stopped walking. Ahead of us, the desert floor dipped into a wide, shallow basin. At its center was the arch from the photographs, exactly as I’d seen it only now, up close, I could see the carvings pulsing faintly in the shadows, like they were catching light from somewhere underground.

A wind picked up, hot and dry, carrying with it the faint scent of water, impossible this far into the desert.

Ramiel turned to me for the first time since we left the truck. “You’re up, Sergeant. Read the door.”

I stepped closer, tracing my eyes along the cuneiform etched into the keystone. The main inscription was clear now: *Return unto me, and I will give you life everlasting.*

But there was something else. A second line, half-hidden beneath centuries of grit. I brushed away the sand with my sleeve, revealing jagged, uneven symbols that didn’t match any Mesopotamian script I knew.

The air changed the second I stepped under the arch. It wasn’t just cooler, it felt thick, like moving through water. My ears popped, and for a moment I swore I could hear voices whispering in languages I didn’t know, layered on top of each other, rising and falling like the tide.

A staircase of carved stone led down into darkness. Ramiel went first, his steps slow but sure, as if he’d walked this path before. Dr. Hails followed, flipping open her Bible and running her finger along a passage without reading it aloud. The medic was behind me now, and I could feel his eyes on my back the whole way down.

We descended for what felt like forever, the light from the surface shrinking into a pinprick above us. The walls here were covered in more inscriptions, some in Akkadian, some in something older, older than Sumer, older than anything I’d seen in the books back at DLI. The Akkadian ones I could read.

*“The king sleeps in the deep. The flood could not take him. Death could not hold him.”*

Another read “*When the trumpet sounds, the gates shall open, and the dust shall walk”*

The biblical echo hit me immediately. Trumpets. The dead walking. I thought of Revelation, of Sunday school warnings about the final days.

The stairwell ended in a vast stone chamber. At its center stood a sarcophagus. Massive, black, and inlaid with gold that still gleamed after what had to be thousands of years. Carved into its lid was a figure wearing a horned crown, eyes closed, arms crossed over his chest.

Gilgamesh.

I didn’t need anyone to tell me. I knew this place was not natural. The king who sought immortality and, according to every historian I knew, failed. Only… he hadn’t.

Dr. Hails stepped forward, setting her Bible on the lid. She whispered something in that ancient, guttural language again, and the gold inlay began to glow.

The whispering in the air grew louder, resolving into words I could finally understand “*I have seen the deep. I have held the plant of life. I return”*

The lid shifted, stone grinding against stone. A crack split across its length, and the smell that poured out wasn’t rot it was damp earth, like the banks of the Euphrates after a flood.

A hand, pale and too long at the joints, slid through the gap. On its wrist was a battered Casio watch, the kind you only saw on guys who’d been in-country a long time. The glass was cracked, the strap frayed like it had been worn for years.

I froze, unsure why Ramiel’s expression had gone from stone-faced to something darker.

The lid ground open wider, and the rest of the figure emerged, a man in torn desert fatigues, but moving wrong, every motion too smooth, too precise. His eyes caught the torchlight and flared, almost golden.

“That was our linguist,” Ramiel said, voice low. “Dr. Dyer, or whats left of him” 

I’d never met the man, but hearing his name here in this place, made the hair on my arms rise.

The thing smiled, and it wasn’t the smile of someone glad to see old friends. It was possession, ownership.

“Translate for me, linguist,” it said in flawless Akkadian. “Tell them their king has returned.”

I backed up until my shoulders hit the cold stone wall. My training told me to reach for my rifle, but some deeper instinct  told me it wouldn’t matter.

Dr. Hails didn’t move. She stood with her head bowed, eyes closed, lips moving in silent prayer… or maybe recitation. I couldn’t tell if it was for God or for the thing in front of us.

Ramiel stepped forward, drawing a knife that looked older than the tomb itself. “We can end this before…”

The chamber shook. A low groan rolled through the stone like the world itself was shifting. From above came the heavy, final sound of something massive slamming into place. The faint light from the stairwell vanished.

We were sealed in.

Gilgamesh turned his head toward the sound, unfazed. “The gate closes when the trumpet sounds,” he murmured, as if to himself. “But the dead do not rest.”

Water began to seep between the seams in the floor, dark and cold. My boots were wet within minutes. It carried with it that same scent from earlier. The river after a flood.

I tried to get to the stairs, but the way was blocked by a slab of stone that hadn’t been there before. No seams, no hinges. Just smooth, ancient rock where the entrance had been.

“Containment,” Ramiel growled without looking at me. “They knew the risk. If he woke, no one leaves.”

Dr. Hails opened her eyes. “The water will rise. That’s how they keep him. We drown with the king.”

Gilgamesh stepped down from the sarcophagus, every motion precise, fluid. His eyes locked on me. “You speak the tongue,” he said. “You will carry my words when the flood recedes. That is how it has always been.”

“I’m not carrying anything,” I muttered, rifle still trained on him.

He smiled not cruel, not mocking. Almost… pitying. “You will.”

The water was halfway to my knees now. The chamber’s walls seemed to breathe with the rising tide, and the carvings shimmered in the torchlight, shifting into scenes of cities drowning, crowned kings walking through crowds of the dead.

amiel looked at me sharply. “There’s another way out. But it’s not for all of us.”

The implication was clear. Someone had to stay to seal the door again. Someone had to keep the king from following.

Gilgamesh tilted his head, watching us decide. “Choose wisely,” he said in Akkadian. “The flood takes the unworthy first.”

The water was to my waist now, icy enough to burn. Every breath tasted of silt.

Ramiel pointed to a shadowed crack in the far wall, just above the waterline — narrow, jagged, barely big enough for a man to squeeze through. “That leads to the outer ravine. It’s the only way out before the chamber floods. But once you’re through…” He glanced at Gilgamesh. “…you have to collapse it. No hesitation.”

Dr. Hails shook her head. “If he reaches the surface—”

“I know,” Ramiel said.

The water climbed higher. Somewhere deep in the tomb, a low rumble began, rhythmic, almost like a heartbeat.

Ramiel locked eyes with me. “You get out, Mullins. You tell them. I’ll hold him here.”

I didn’t argue. I couldn’t. My legs were already moving toward the crack in the wall, sloshing through the rising black water.

Behind me, I heard Ramiel muttering something in that ancient, guttural tongue, the sound almost swallowed by the rushing tide. Gilgamesh’s voice answered in kind, calm and patient, like two old soldiers discussing a war long past.

I pulled myself into the crevice, stone scraping my arms and chest. The light from the chamber grew smaller, fainter. Then a splash, loud and violent, followed by silence.

When I finally reached daylight, I was on my hands and knees in a dry ravine, gasping air like a drowning man. The sun was too bright, the sky too clean.

I looked back at the hole I’d crawled from. It was already caved in, just rubble now. No sound. No movement.

want to believe he’s still down there. That Ramiel kept his word. That the flood swallowed them both.

But sometimes, at night, I hear water running where it shouldn’t be. I hear footsteps in the hallway when I’m alone. And last week, in the market, I saw a tall man in the crowd wearing a battered Casio watch.

If you’re reading this, stay away from the ruins near the Euphrates. If you hear someone speaking in a language you can’t place run. Don’t look back.

Because the king’s shadow walks.

And when he returns, it won’t just be Baghdad that drowns.
