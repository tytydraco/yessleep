I (20 F) have had narcolepsy for over 2 years now, which is a neurological condition that causes me to be tired all the time and sleep uncontrollably throughout the day. Some other side affects of this are lucid dreams, cataplexy (basically I cant control my muscles if I laugh a lot and collapse), and sleep paralysis.

So it was almost light outside, the sun was almost up and I had just woken up in sleep paralysis. As I became more aware and conscious, I noticed the feeling of a hand gently brushing the hair out of my face. Barely awake still, my first thought was that my mum was doing it because she often would do this if she noticed I was in sleep paralysis. I then looked around and realised I wasn't at home but in my university accommodation and started to panic as I knew I was alone in my room. By this point I was fully awake but still in paralysis so was unable to move anything but my eyes. I looked up and out of the corner of my eye I saw the fingers and they brushed past my eye. The fingers were a greyish skin tone, long and bony. It felt like whatever it was noticed I had seen it and they quickly moved out of my eyeline. I then felt the cold hand move abruptly over my face down my neck, chest and legs. It then moved upwards and my whole body felt as though it was being sucked up into a void, pulled upwards into the direction of the hand. I felt my body being less pressure on my bed as if I were actually being lifted slowly off of it. I then felt like I had been heavily dropped back onto the bed and my entire body was in pins and needles, I've never felt anything like this before, usually pins and needles occurs in one part of my body like if I sit on my leg wrong and cut off circulation. It was almost painful and my entire body stayed in this pins and needles state even after I was able to move again.

I have had hallucinations before as sometimes my brain can be in REM whilst I'm awake due to the narcolepsy and I essentially dream while awake. These always freak me out especially when I'm alone. There was something different about this one though, it felt more real and more hostile for some reason, as if it was truly a separate being to what my brain had created. I do believe in ghosts, spirits and the like as me and my mum have had quite a few unexplainable encounters with things we think are ghosts and and I have no idea if this was anything to with that but it could just be my brain creating it. The weirdest part is the pins and needles that lingered afterwards that had never happened before.

Please let me know if you have any thoughts on this and what you think an explanation for this could be.
