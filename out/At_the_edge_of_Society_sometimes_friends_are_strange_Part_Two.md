Cullen had given a report on the last shift’s events. He had been taken off checkpoint security for a week, and now he was back on the job. It was like nothing had ever happened, and that was how he wanted it. The alert board had been his personal space for four months, and it would be the fifth soon. He needed the job to go well so he could be stable. He also needed it to keep an eye on his friends.

Today wasn’t anyone’s solo shift, so he wasn’t alone. Tommy had a chair pulled up right next to him, whittling away at his personal space by the second. He was a younger guy, by about half a decade. Dirty blonde, missing an eye, clean-shaven. He was very orderly, his ugly blue and yellow uniform, which was almost identical to a regular office worker’s fit, spotless clean and proudly displaying his ECFK badge.

Lupe was, for all intents and purposes, a normal human woman, and friendly. At least, in the ways that mattered. She took after Cullen and wore casual clothes. The uniform was, more or less, a formality. Some strangers liked the faces at the gate to be all proper, others were put off by excessive nicety. For a while, it had been one, then the other for clothing regulation. Eventually the ECFK realized it didn’t matter, and that ‘honest wear’ was best wear.

Cullen looked away from Lupe. Focused on the board while Tommy muttered to himself about the state of the lights and buttons. He fiddled briefly with his mug. While he’d been off, they’d monitored the lady in the coat. They’d told him she was on her way to normalizing. He wasn’t really sure what that really meant, beyond the definition of the word, but he had been cleared as normal, too.

The glass window had been repaired, or replaced. Cullen wasn’t sure. All he knew was that someone had come in while he was gone, did some magic, and now the illusion of safety was back. He couldn’t help but watch the weather monitor, though. That little slice of the alert board gave him an active report on the state of the sky: temperature, humidity, wind, precipitation, rough cloud count, and miscellaneous things like glass content.

13-A-2 lit up. The first stranger. Cullen’s eyes flicked to one of the monitors. In the forest, there was a man in a clean-pressed black suit standing over a patch of foliage. He was examining the underbrush, in detail. Every part of the forest floor was being scrutinized, and almost every item ended up warranting a note. It had a little notepad and pen, scribbled away in it with quick, pointed strokes.

Cullen’s arms felt heavy. He struggled to lift his mug to his lips, take a sip. Tommy watched with interest. Cullen and Tommy had the same space, but different jobs. Cullen was the gatekeeper. Tommy was the guy who took notes, and he was making those same strokes on his own pad, with his own pen, but Tommy’s pen was less formal. Tommy’s was some sort of collectible. It was shaped kind of like a cane with a hat on the end, but it wrote the same.

“Where’d you get that thing, Tom?”

“Improper Crimes. Supernatural crime show.” Tommy’s voice was always clipped, but paradoxically enthusiastic.

“...Huh.” Cullen let the conversation drop. The thing with strangers, they brought things with them, once you let them in. Just like regular people do. That was why Tommy existed. To figure out what was being brought over, to find patterns in behavior. He had access, far as Cullen knew, to the notes of the whole length of the northwest wall. It was almost reassuring to know there was someone here who could pretend he knew what was going on.

Cullen thought of the window. He imagined it cracking again. He flexed his jaw, wriggled his fingers. “Hey, Tom?”

Tommy glanced at him. He was still observing.

“What happens when we break their stuff?” Cullen asked the question as he watched the suited stranger pick up a doll. One of the ones Cullen had run over just a week ago, whose button eyes had been squeezed out of its head as it gave the world’s saddest death squeak. The stranger was, methodically, examining every single thing Cullen’s buggy had touched, or even gone near. It’d been the only actual reason they’d pulled him off. To let the possible backlash simmer down.

“They take things from you. Tit for tat. Eye for an eye. Your lunch for theirs.”

“Things like…?”

“You know the law of equivalent exchange?”

“Vaguely.”

“Imagine that, but we take out ‘gain something’ and replace it with ‘lose something’. Same reason they give us things, but that’s gaining.” Tommy looked at Cullen for a bit, measured him. He dropped the chipper, casual to-the-point tone for something else. “Anything go missing? Like, at home, or here.”

“Every single coffee mug is gone.” Cullen looked at his mug. “Whole collection, except that one.”

Tommy blinked. He almost snorted, but composed himself. “Must not’ve run over anything important, then. I’m sure the big bosses wouldn’t send you back out if someone was going to pull your teeth out through the window or something.” Cullen’s face must’ve gone pale at that, since Tommy went quiet and returned to observing.

Cullen followed Tommy’s good eye to the monitor. The suited man was done collecting and examining. He held up his last piece of evidence, and there was a blur as his gloved hands moved. Something that looked kind of like a friendship bracelet made of glass was pieced together in a flash, and the suited man turned towards the camera. He held it up. There were names etched into the glass, dangling from tiny spheres off a fragile band, and the man shook his head.

The suited stranger was gone in the next second, and Cullen hadn’t had time to read the names. Was there a C in there? Any T’s? Maybe even an L, an M.

Cullen took a deep, shaky breath. “Hey Tom?”

Tommy looked at him, like he was trying to read his mind. He seemed kind of on edge, like he was watching a feral cat, before he smoothed his features. “Yeah?”

“Do they accept bribes? Apology gifts?”

“Sometimes. Well, usually. But it has to be… Equal value. And that’s not always an obvious bar.”

Cullen sucked on his lip. He wondered if something from the boon box would work. But he was having a hard time trusting his luck to that kind of thing right now. He still wasn’t sure if the teeth had been a help, or a trick. And it was always the uncertain things where he broke.

He drained the rest of his coffee mug.

An alert went up. A lot of alerts. He watched the lights flicker on then almost immediately go out across his board, moving all the way from the very edge, 13-A-43, to 13-A-1. Cullen glanced at Lupe, who sat at the security officer’s desk, and saw she was relaxed. So, Cullen wiped the sweat from his brow and swallowed.

A… Creature, of some kind, with an elongated neck was now staring down at them through the window. It had beady black eyes, and a thin mouth that stretched from ear to ear. It looked like some kind of fleshy snake. Tall, had to bend down too far for Cullen’s liking to look him and Tommy in the eye.

“Do you observe the Formality?” Cullen croaked.

“Quite.” It showed him its hands, which were small and almost baby-like, loosely hanging from stretched out, pale arms. Cullen peered out the window at an angle, squinted, and saw awkward little duck feet. He looked the thing in the face again, worked his mouth to ask the last necessity, and it smiled at him. Its mouth was a black void, no teeth.

It went to the second window, and Cullen heard the usual thwump of the reception tube. Cullen briefly slid over. “What, uh, brings you to Society?” He almost called it ‘friend’, a bit put off, but remembered to cut himself short. You don’t give the title out willy nilly like that. Not ever.

“Criminal investigation.”

“...Like, crimes of manners?”

“No. Murder.”

Cullen stared for a bit, then remembered himself. “I grant you entry. You are a friend.”

He turned to Tommy as the creature went on through the gate. “Is it bad I kind of wish, sometimes, they’d give me a messed up answer? Like, I don’t know, skinning birds.”

“If I was a serial killer, especially a serial killer who was one of them, do you think I’d wait till before or after I got inside to do it?”

“Fair enough.” It was hypothetical, of course. As long as Cullen didn’t slip up, no one he let inside would ever do anything outside of human norms. As long as they were friendly. As long as they were not unfit. And, even if he got it wrong, bad things wouldn’t always happen. If he turned away someone who would’ve fit in, accidentally or even on purpose, there was no guarantee something bad would happen later.

But there was never a guarantee good things would happen. Nothing was ever certain, just orderly.

He looked towards the tube. He pulled out what was inside. His hands shook with jitters for a second, even though he knew he’d assessed correctly. It was a note. He unfurled it. It was written on old, wrinkled paper.

It said: *It’s Not Your Fault. It’s Ours.*

Lupe looked over at Cullen and Tommy, and Cullen didn’t look at her, but he felt her eyes on his neck. Cullen handed the paper to Tommy, kept his voice level as he asked the logical question. “What the hell is this?”

He saw Tommy’s lips move, probably to give some reasonable explanation in line with his knowledge, but both of them were drawn towards the monitors as lights went up. They flashed twice, signifying the presence of not one, but two entities. 13-A-33. 13-A-21. 13-A-15. 13-A-1. On the monitors, a river that was too dark, but otherwise not ominous. A random patch of desert with a few off-color patterns of sand sprinkled in with the usual pale yellow. A slice of suburbia, broken up by slightly bigger slices of woodland with trees that were tall enough you had to double take. Finally, the very edge of the forest, right across that lawn of grass and wildflowers.

He saw something spindly, vaguely womanish, get dragged into the water’s dark depths. He saw an oddly approachable pot filled with sand, with little crabby legs, scratching at the colored sand patterns, maybe in the middle of drawing shapes or disturbing them, be swallowed into the dune beneath it. He did not even get to see the third person vanish, just their hand gripping the door of a closet, the drone viewing the scene through a window, before it slammed shut without making a sound. When the door opened, there was nothing inside.

Cullen looked up. He saw the Moss Man standing just behind the treeline. He didn’t hesitate. If anything, maybe he should’ve, but he didn’t. He jolted up, startled, and was rigid for just a second before he was running to the side door. He heard Lupe growl, and Tommy fumbling after him, telling him to wait.

Cullen emerged into the cool, crisp air, and went across the field. He was quick, but careful. He did not step on the flowers. He did not let himself trample anything that did not belong to him. He went right to the Moss Man, his chest muscles frozen and cold radiating through every fiber of his being.

“Ah, if it isn’t my favorite compassionate rapscallion.” The Moss Man greeted him in his bubbly stream voice. “Why do you move with such haste? Is there trouble afoot?”

The Outside was quiet. Cullen didn’t hear any leaves rustling. There was no birdsong, no fluttering, no moving branches or secret whispers. Like a child, he reached out to take the Moss Man’s hand. He looked around, wide-eyed, and waited. He just waited. He waited, and prayed that there would be some offense to whisking away the both of them at the same time, a breach of some ancient rule or contract nobody had ever heard of. Maybe some diplomatic principle.

He didn’t want anyone else to go away because of him.

And they didn’t. The Moss Man remained. They stood there awkwardly for a moment, as if just uncomfortable, as if nothing was wrong and everything was perfectly in order. He started telling Cullen about his trip to see some relatives, but Cullen wasn’t listening. Normally, he might let his imagination wander, try to fill in the gaps where he was allowed to, compare and contrast his world with the other.

It was only when Lupe pulled him back into the security checkpoint, her grip far stronger than his and his every muscle rigid as plastic, that Cullen realized it would be okay. He looked out the window, and saw the Moss Man waiting quietly, very obviously waiting to see if everything was fine before he went through the gate without any ceremony. He was already a known factor, so he was welcomed.

Something thumped into the tube. Cullen ignored the protests of his two coworkers, Lupe’s chiding, Tommy’s attempts to check on his condition and peppered questions. He took the contents of the deposit chamber out. It was another note.

He unfurled it. It read:

*Everything will be in Order, by your Eighth span. I have granted a Boon. The Dignitary will arrive, and find Cleanliness, Organization, Health, and Offering, else the reminder will be repeated.*

A pit formed in Cullen’s gut. His palms sweated. He chewed his lip. There was a photo attached, but what wasn’t in it was far more important than what was.
