Content warning: Loss of memory, loss of limb.             
  
Exactly what the title says. I wrote three years ago about [a strange book](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/x1q2np/i_found_an_old_book_but_google_search_results/) that fell into my lap through the "charitable" donation of a man I can only describe as stale. When that book came into my possession, something shifted inside of me. Even now as I am cognizant again (we will get to what I mean in a little bit) I am unsure if I am fully me or something else. 

The last thing I remember is 3 years ago. I was forcing myself to stay awake, and suddenly I reached my breaking point where I needed to go to sleep. So I did. I just woke up a week ago, in a different part of the country, laying in somebodies bed which is not mine, wearing clothes which I've never worn before, a tattoo I didn't have before, and missing my left hand.   
  
I checked myself into a hospital for a psych evaluation, which perplexed the doctors. They have chalked it up to some sort of stress induced amnesia, at least at first. When they found out I've been legally dead for the past few years, their tone shifted. Being held in a mental institution between interviews with officers about where I've been and what I've been doing has been a lesson in patience and frustration. I have no answers, only questions. 

Peculiarly, one of the people who interviewed me, seemed more interested in the book when I brought it up. The man, clean cut and trimmed facial hair looked like a detective, but his outfit of a brown suit with a brown trench coat felt more out of a 1940s hard boiled detective novel than out of an actual police department.   
  
He at least took my concerns seriously. He inquired about the man who gave me the book, and when I mentioned that he also wore a brown trench coat similarly to his, he paused and looked genuinely concerned. This to me was almost as unsettling as my loss of memory over the past three years. Almost being the operative word. 

This goes without saying, but being legally declared as deceased means that my former position as an associate professor is no longer mine. My home and all of my possessions have been sold or thrown away.  My hand aches, or rather a phantom pain where my hand should be aches. This tattoo on me, which is really just a bunch of random nonsense symbols feels oddly warm when the rest of my body feels cold.  
  
This thing that haunted my dream previously, and that devilish grin are still in the back of my mind. When I look into the mirror, I can see its grin on my face. Its me, but its not me. I have a sneaking suspicion that whatever this thing is was using me as a meat suit the last few years. To what end, I do not know.  

I genuinely do not know what to do here. Or at least I didn't until last night. The man in the brown trench coat had given me his business card and told me that he might be able to help me reclaim some sense of control over my life. I was hesitant at first, but after discovering that every aspect of my life before is gone, I decided I have nothing to lose.

Has anyone been in a situation like this before? Ultimately I've decided that since I essentially have no life anymore anyway, that I have nothing to lose with this trench coat man. I wanted to leave this message to all of you, in case I never am able to respond again, as a reminder that I exist. I have a life, or at least had one. And I hope to reclaim it. 

And to that grinning Stale Man who gave me that book, if you are reading this, which I suspect that you are. I'm coming for you. You took everything from me, and I will seek my pound of flesh.
