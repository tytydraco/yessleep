I used to work the night shift at Willow Creek Storage. Used to. After what happened last month, I can't even drive past the place without my hands shaking. I'm typing this down now because I need people to know what's really going on there, and I don’t think I have much time left.

The job seemed perfect at first. Twelve-hour shifts, three nights a week, decent pay for basically sitting in a booth and occasionally checking on things. The facility was huge – over 500 units spread across a dozen buildings. My supervisor Jim warned me that some weird stuff happened at night, but I figured he meant raccoons or teenagers trying to break in.

I should have paid more attention to why the last three guards had quit without notice.

The first few weeks were normal enough. I'd make my rounds every two hours, check that all the gates were locked, and spend the rest of the time reading or watching Netflix on my phone. The only odd thing was that some of the motion-sensor lights would flick on occasionally in Building C, even when I couldn't see anything moving.

Then I started hearing the humming.

It was faint at first – just a low, rhythmic sound that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere. I thought maybe it was the electrical system or an HVAC unit, but it only happened between 2 and 4 AM. The sound had an almost musical quality, like a lullaby played through water.

I grabbed my flashlight and headed toward Building C, where the motion lights were most active. As I got closer, the humming grew louder, and I could swear I heard voices mixed in – not words exactly, but the rise and fall of conversation.

Unit C-47 was slightly ajar.

I knew for a fact that unit had been locked when I checked earlier. Hell, I'd rattled the padlock myself. But there it was, the metal door rolled up maybe six inches, just enough for someone to crawl under. The humming was coming from inside.

I crouched down and shined my flashlight into the gap.

The unit was empty except for a single cardboard box in the center. The humming stopped the moment my light hit it.

I lifted the door higher and stepped inside. The box was unmarked, about the size of a microwave, and when I picked it up, it was surprisingly light. I almost dropped it when I realized the humming was coming from inside the box itself.

That's when I heard footsteps behind me.

I spun around, but the storage unit was empty. The footsteps continued – slow, deliberate steps that seemed to circle the unit. I could hear them clearly on the concrete floor, but I couldn't see anyone. The motion sensor light outside flickered rapidly, like a strobe.

I ran. I'm not proud of it, but I ran back to the security booth and locked the door. I sat there for the rest of my shift, watching the security monitors as lights flickered on and off throughout Building C. Sometimes I'd see shapes moving between the units – tall, thin shadows that seemed to glide rather than walk.

The next morning, I checked unit C-47. It was locked tight, and when I asked Jim about it, he just gave me a long look and said, "Did you touch anything?"

I lied and said no.

"Good," he said. "Whatever you do, don't touch anything in the units. And if you hear humming, just ignore it."

But I couldn't ignore it. The humming got louder each night, and it wasn't just coming from Building C anymore. Units in Building F started opening on their own. Then Building A. Always the same thing – a cardboard box in an otherwise empty unit, humming softly in the darkness.

I started keeping a log. Twenty-seven units had opened over two weeks. Always between 2 and 4 AM. Always with a box inside. I never touched another one, but I could feel them calling to me, their collective humming growing stronger each night.

Last Tuesday, I made a mistake. I was doing my rounds when I heard something different – not humming, but crying. Soft, heartbroken sobs coming from Building D. Unit D-23 was open, but this time there was no box.

There was a little girl.

She couldn't have been more than six years old, sitting in the corner of the empty unit with her knees pulled up to her chest. She was wearing a yellow dress that looked like it was from decades ago, and her dark hair hung in front of her face.

"Hey sweetie," I called softly. "Are you okay? Where are your parents?"

She looked up at me, and I saw that her eyes were completely black – not just the pupils, but the entire eye. When she spoke, her voice layered with the humming I'd grown so familiar with.

"They're coming," she said. "They're almost ready."

"Who's coming?"

She smiled, and I saw that her teeth were too sharp, too many. "The ones in the boxes. We've been waiting so long, and now there are enough of us."

That's when I heard it – not just from her unit, but from all around the facility. The humming had become a chorus, rising from dozens of units simultaneously. The motion lights were going crazy, flashing in patterns that almost looked deliberate.

I backed away as she stepped out of the unit. Behind her, I could see other figures emerging from the storage units – tall shadows with too many joints, things that moved like spiders, and more children with those terrible black eyes.

I ran to my car and didn't stop driving until I run out of gas three towns over.

I called in sick the next day, and the day after that. When I finally worked up the courage to call Jim, he told me not to bother coming back. The facility was closed indefinitely due to "structural issues." But I drove by last weekend, and I saw cars in the parking lot. New night security, probably. People who don't know what they're guarding.

I thought about calling the police, but how do you explain something like this? I tried calling Jim, but his number's been disconnected. I even tried researching the property, but all I could find was that Willow Creek Storage was built on the site of an old children's home that burned down in 1952.

Forty-three children died in that fire.

I've been dreaming about boxes. Cardboard boxes humming lullabies, sitting in storage units that stretch on forever. In the dreams, I'm walking between the units, and I can hear my name being called from inside each box. The voices sound happy, grateful.

They sound like children.

Last night, I found a cardboard box on my doorstep. It's sitting on my kitchen table right now, humming softly. I know I shouldn't open it. I know whatever's inside has been waiting for me specifically.

But I can hear them calling my name, and I'm so tired of running.

If you're reading this and I haven't posted an update, don't go looking for Willow Creek Storage. Don't try to help me. Just remember – if you ever take a job as a night security guard, and your supervisor warns you about weird stuff happening, maybe listen to him.

And whatever you do, don't open the boxes.
