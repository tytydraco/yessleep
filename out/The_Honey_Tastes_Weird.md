I killed Molly Fletcher. 

I killed Molly Fletcher and I buried her body in Palmer’s Creek. 

I killed Molly Fletcher and I buried her body in Palmer’s Creek and nobody will ever know because her car went missing, too. 

Her car went missing, too, and so they think she ran away. 

They think she ran away because she was pregnant. 

They think she ran away because I got her pregnant, and she was going to run away anyway. 

She was going to run away and I know this because she wanted me to go with her. 

She wanted me to go with her, but I couldn’t go.

I couldn’t go because I didn’t want to, and I didn’t want to because I like my home and I like my school, and now she’s dead and it’s all my fault.
I killed Molly Fletcher, and now, the honey tastes weird. And you can’t tell anyone, but I killed her 7 months ago. I buried her in Palmer’s Creek in a shallow grave. I brought her flowers once, because she was carrying my child, but I figured it was better this way. We could both be happy. I wanted to visit her again. I wanted to dig her up and say hello and see how the baby was doing. 
I wanted to see how the baby was doing because it should have been born today.

It should have been born today, but it wasn’t.

It wasn’t, because I killed Molly Fletcher.

And I was wondering if it grew anymore, and if maybe it had my eyes, or Molly’s nose, or my big ears that made it hard to find a girlfriend until Molly moved here. But when I got to Palmer’s Creek, something had gone wrong. Her body must have turned to slime and decomposed. There were flowers in the shape of a girl. And this was my fault, too. Dead people make great fertilizer, and I brought her daisies, which have seeds. And if we had a girl, we could have named her Daisy, because that was always my favorite flower. 

It was always my favorite flower, so I crept closer to the garden I had inadvertently planted. It was Spring, so it was nice outside, and I watched a gentle honeybee fly onto the tallest flower. And I talked to Molly for a long time.

She was the sweetest girl in school. She never made me feel weird about my ears, or my height. She would come over and let me show her my videogames, and now that I’m looking back, I don’t think she really liked them all that much. But she wanted to make other people happy. 

She wanted to make me happy.

She wanted to make me happy, and I killed her. It wasn’t my fault. I was trying to save her. She wanted to run away, but I knew it wasn’t smart.

I knew it wasn’t smart, but I knew her parents would be mad if she stayed.

I knew her parents would be mad, but she couldn’t go alone.

She couldn’t go alone, and I couldn’t go with her. I had no solution to offer her. So I killed her. But I know she isn’t mad at me, or she wouldn’t have grown me daisies. She knows I like them. More bees come down and sit in the flowerbuds. A ladybug flies into the grass. The spring is a beautiful season. To my left, in the shape of a boy I once knew, pink roses grew. I watch a purple butterfly delicately land on a petal, and use its long tongue, like a vacuum, to consume whatever it is that butterflies eat. I watch a bee fly into a tree. 
The sun begins to set, so I say goodbye to my baby and its mother. I walk to the Fletchers.

I walk there, and her mother has made tortillas.

Her mother has made tortillas and they always eat them with honey.

They always eat them with honey, and I make her father a couple. He takes a bite and spits it out. He opens his mouth to speak.

How long have those flowers been growing? 

“The honey tastes weird.”
