Since I was very young I have always been attracted to vampires and I never really knew why. When I was still a child I dreamed of meeting an emo vampire in the forest who would take me out of the banal life of human existence... in short it's a bit cringe but I was 10 years old ok.

Enough jokes, over time I began to realize that I would never meet real vampires, until the day it happened and it was far from the romantic image I had in my childhood dreams. 

I was 17 almost 18 when it happened, it was a time when I was active on Discord and since this story I have completely deserted the site. I was wandering around the web trying to find interesting servers, especially RP servers, then I came across a vampire RP server that seemed extremely realistic and well put together, because in fact once I joined it I quickly realized that it was not RP at all but rather a server full of bloodsuckers and their prey, people who regularly gave them their own blood or who volunteered to do it in the future. 

These Sanguinarians, as they call themselves, drank blood directly from people's veins with an infusion, an incision or even directly on their teeth, posting glasses of blood or infusions from their "donors" on the various server rooms. 

The owner of the server was a man around 30 - 40 years old, he often went on trips and seemed to do very serious research on Sanguinarians, dissecting each case he encountered on his server or in real life one by one to understand this condition, this vital need for blood that he had, because according to him, his body needed it medically to survive and he was the only one on this server in this condition, most were just depressed and withdrawal teenagers of landmark, crazy people, impressionable people, or people who wanted to feel different.
 
I met several people in this server, including this "real vampire chef", I didn't know him more personally but two of them left an impression on me.

A man 6 years my senior, in a total trip and convinced of being a real vampire trying to guide young vampires who are barely discovering themselves, he was convinced that I was like him, and that I was the only one like him. him, who many signs in me did not deceive, notably the fact that I am allergic to the sun, he wanted us to drink each other's blood to satisfy our thirst, it was totally crazy. 

Another man of my age at the time this time also thought that I was a vampire and he wanted to satisfy a certain morbid curiosity and above all become a vampire himself, he had even trained to be in good physical condition for become one. 

Fortunately I have never met anyone from this server, but from what I know the administrators often organize events among themselves and with certain members.

Honestly I don't know why I'm telling all this, maybe to get feedback, similar or different experiences with vampires. I didn't go into too much detail because I might have problems because while obscuring the vast majority of crazy people in there, some members were enigmatic seeming to be hiding something even more disturbing than madness.
