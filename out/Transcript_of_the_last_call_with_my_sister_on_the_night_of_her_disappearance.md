More than a year ago, my sister disappeared. Today, the police officially told our family they are closing the case as they didn't find any evidence of foul play. It’s clear that whatever happened to her happened on our last call. So today I’m sharing that frightening last call’s transcript, hoping someone will help me find some rational explanation of the reasons of her disappearance.  


\*\*\*

*Transcript of the last call from Roman \[REDACTED\] to Tanya \[REDACTED\]. 17th of November 2021.*  
*Translated from Romanian to English.*  
Roman: Tanya!  
Tanya: Rom! How are you?  
R: I’m good! Drowning in work for my thesis… and feeling a bit nostalgic.  
T: Where are you?  
R: *\[After short hesitation\]* I’m home.  
T: …You’re in London?  


*\[Sound of clearing throat\]*

R: Yes of course… Where else would I be? Is everything alright?

*\[Heavy breathing\]*

T: Y-yes… I’m just tired.

R: What’s up? Tell me some news, come on… You never tell me anything about what’s happening down there!  
T: *\[Chuckle\]* I’m good, not much news. You know our little town…

R: How’s mom?  
T: She’s ok, she’s going out with Gabriel every day now. He seems fine, you know…

R: Oh, he does? I thought he was a douchebag just two weeks ago!

*\[Laughter on both ends\]* 

T: He is ok, and I’m happy for mom. She’s not drinking as much, you know… And she looks happier than when you left. 

*\[Silence\]*

R: I will be back for Christmas, I promise.

T: It’s ok… We got used to living without you. I mean… Don’t take it wrong! Of course we want you here, but… It’s just what you gotta do. Finish your studies… We need a doctor down here. Mr. \[Redacted\] is getting old… And he’s always been a creep!

*\[Giggling\]*

T: You know, actually something did happen.

R: What? Something happened in little Nucet? Wow! Tell me more…

T: Now you sound like an arse… It’s actually not funny. It’s… Quite puzzling.

R: I’m listening.

*\[Silence\]*

T: It’s the weirdest thing and… You know, if I wasn’t sure you knew more than what you let on, I’d be a bit scared. It’s really creepy Rom, even for your disgusting standards.

R: You know I’ve no idea what you are talking about, right?  
T: Where are you, Rom?  
R: I told you, I’m home.  
T: You are in London?  
*\[Silent, shuffling sound\]*

R: *\[In a seemingly frustrated tone of voice\]* Yes I am, that’s where I live! What got into you? Just tell me what happened already!  
T: I received a note.  
R: Ok, from whom?  
T: Well, that’s what I don’t know, but it’s… It’s the weirdest thing really. Remember Baita?  
R: If I remember Baita, the mine? The uranium volcano our town has been sitting on for 70 years? Yes, I think I do remember that! Quite difficult to miss the millions of tons of Uranium at a couple of kilometers from our house!  
T: I know you know Baita, idiot. I’m just asking you if you remember when we went there… To the pit.  
R: *\[Hesitation, deep breath\]* I went there at least a dozen times.

T: You know what I’m talking about. We went together, once.  
R: Yes. Of course, I remember that…  
T: It was 2002, I think. I was 8. You wanted to play next to the excavators, in the evening.   
R: I remember that…

*\[Silence on both ends\]*  
R: I’m sorry. I-I don’t know what happened that night.  
T: You were just trying to scare me, as usual.  
R: I wasn’t. I really… Something startled me. I didn’t mean for it to… I-I got scared.  
T: And I was already scared because of the damned bridge you wanted to walk on. So your timing was definitely well-thought… But you were 12, you didn’t want to hurt me. We were kids.  
R: I didn’t mean to scare you Tanya, really. I-I got scared.  
T: The point is *\[Deep sigh\]*... You asked me not to tell mom I broke my ankle when I fell.  
R: We would both get in trouble… It wouldn’t matter how it-  
T: And I never told a soul!  
R: What’s the point Tanya?  
T: Well, I broke my ankle because of you. You are the reason we were on the bridge, you are the one who startled me off of it.  
R: I know, I’m sorry.  
T: And yet I never told a soul… Even if you never told me why the hell you screamed.

*\[Silence\]*

T: And then, after all of that, after the big deal you made about whatever reason made you scream, after you begged me not to tell mom. After all of that, you went out and just told who, Rom? Who did you tell?  
R: I didn’t tell anyone.  
T: Well one of us did, because….

*\[Sound of shuffling paper\]*

T: Either you did, or someone YOU told is fucking with us. *\[Reading from the paper:\]* I’ve been with you since Baita. I’m with you every night.  
R: What the f– What is this?!  
T: That’s the note I got. Someone who knows what happened that night, who knows I fell from the bridge, who knows I could have easily died and… Who says he’s been \[Deep breath\] with me ever since. Whatever that means… If you didn’t tell anyone, if you are not the one who’s “with” me, then who the hell knows?   
R: I don’t… It sounds like someone is trying to scare you.  
T: Yeah, you think uh? Someone who knows we were at Baita.  
R: Maybe they don’t know, it’s a fair guess! Many children where going to bike there on summer!  
T: Maybe they did guess, yeah. But it’s not the only thing…

*\[Silence\]*

T: You’ve always made a point of startling me, especially after that night… Like it wasn’t enough I covered for you with mom… Like it wasn’t enough dad was just gone… Like our lives were doing great!

*\[Light sobbing\]*

R: It was just a game… It’s just what brothers do.  
T: Jumping out of a corner is what brothers do… The other shit… That’s sick stuff. That was never just a game. It was fucking creepy Rom. Is that what you mean, “every night”?  
R: What are you talking about?  
T: The staring game, Rom!  
R: The what now?  
T: Your creepy staring game… The face pushed against my bedroom window… Your eerie face smiling at me… Not even. *\[Deep sigh\] ...*Not even blinking. That’s fucking creepy Rom. And I don’t know how y-  
R: What are you talking about?  
T: *\[Sobbing\]* Rom!   
R: What’s going on Tanya?

*\[Sobbing slows down. Silence for a few seconds\]*

T: Where are you?  
R: Are you kidding me?

*\[Silence\]*

T: I saw you, Rom. I saw your stupid smile against the window, again. Just 10 minutes before you called me.  
R: Agai– What are you talking about, Tanya? Are you crazy? I’ve never done that!  
T: Sure, you never tried to scare me as children, you didn’t stare at me unblinkingly from the corridor and from the window… and you MOST certainly didn’t send the note to scare me! Fuck you, brother!  
R: But I didn’t!  
T: You didn’t what?  
R: I never… I don’t fucking know how not to blink. You’re creeping me out, stop it!  
T: Oh, I’m creeping you out?  
R: Yes!  
T: What about you? Where are you RIGHT NOW?  
R: Ok, I’m done with this stupid question, check your WhatsApp.

*\[Sound of fingers typing on the display\]*

T: Is this…?  
R: That’s my location. Live. How would I have been at your window 10 minutes ago? I’m in fucking London, in my house. Now would you please calm down?

*\[Heavy breathing\]*

T: I must be stressed. 

*\[Sigh\]*

R: You are not stressed, you are not delusional, and I am sorry. I thought I saw something… That night on the bridge. I… It was stupid. I scared myself, I screamed. When… When you fell down the bridge, my heart sunk. Tanya… I never meant for you to get hurt. Now… The note, that stupid note you got. That’s something different… I didn’t… I…  
T: If you didn’t tell anyone, then how do you explain it?  
R: Maybe you did tell mom, you forgot and now…  
T:...And now what, Mom is pulling me a prank?   
R: Maybe… Look, I don’t know. Maybe someone saw us and now is trying a sick prank.

*\[Silence follows for over 30 seconds\]*

T: Roman… I need to know. This, all these things are odd.   
R: I know. I’m just thinking… Maybe I should come over in the weekend.  
T: No. That’s not… Rom, I need to know I’m not crazy. I need you to admit you’ve done that…  
R: Done what? The note?  
T: The staring, Rom… I’ve startled at least a dozen times at your face peeking through the window in the last 10 years or more…  
R: I’m in Lon-  
T: Not now! Not now, Rom. I might have hallucinated because of the note, I got scared. I’m calm now. I’m asking you calmly please, Rom, to admit to me right now you’ve done the unblinking stare from the window… Not now, not today Rom. Not now, but in all these years we’ve lived together.  
R: Tanya, I… Who were you seeing at the window?  
T: I saw you! Your face. You, smiling at me with your creepy look. Your fucking eyes with that not-blinking thing you do! Even Maria saw you once!  
R: I never did th- Tanya… Please leave the house. There’s something… There’s something I need to tell-  
T: Roman, Stop! Stop! Stop! STOOOOOP

*\[Roman raises voice above Tanya\]*

R: I NEVER… I never did that. I never stared at you… Where’s mom? You need to leave now Tanya you-  
T: STOOOOOP  
R: Tanya! Tanya, where is mom?

*\[Shuffling sound, sound of door banging close\]*

R: TANYA! Answer to me!  
T: *\[In a calmer voice\]* Stopitstopitstopitstopitstopitstopit.  
R: Tanya… Tanya! I’m calling mom. You can’t be alone there, I don’t know what got into you.  
T: The bridge… The mine… Your screams, the peeking. You always wanted me dead, uh? You did? I always thought you wanted to scare me b–

*\[Loud bang, sound of crashing window\]*

R: Tanya?

*\[Heavy panting\]*

R: Tanya?

*\[Silence\]*

T: *\[In whispering voice, sobbing\]* Why are you doing this to me… Why? I never told anyone, I love you… Why?  
R: Tanya, what was that? Are you ok? Why are you whispering?  
T: Leave me alone! Leave me alone!  
R: I’m n- Tanya?  
T: Leave!  
R: What’s happening, what was that sound?  
T: Leave me alone Rom, I don’t like it, leave me alone, leave me al–

*\[Another bang, followed by silence\]*

R: Tanya? What’s happening?

*\[Silence\]*

T: *\[Whispering\]* It’s here.  
R: What? Tanya? Who is here? What’s happening?  
T: It’s here… It’s… You. Y-you are… Why are you doing this to me?  
R: Where are you?  
T: I’m… I’m under the bed, it’s… It’s in the entrance. It’s just standing there. It’s… It’s smiling.   
R: Tanya, I’m calling the police. You are not safe! Don’t move!  
T: I can hear the steps. Please Rom whatever you’re doing please stop it…  
R: Tan-

*\[Loud bang, followed by a loud scream. Then silence\]*

R: Tanya!

*\[After a few seconds, a heavy breathing approaches and eventually stops over the phone, then the call interrupts.\]*

\*\*\*

I tried to call several times after, but she didn’t answer anymore.

After a few minutes, I called the police, while I tried processing what had happened. The police got to the place and found a broken window in Tanya’s bedroom. The window had been crashed from the inside. Other than that, there was no sign of any struggle, nor of any breaking and entering from the entrance door. Whoever got in, if anyone at all, had the keys or was let in. 

I’ve been held as the main suspect in the case of Tanya’s vanishing for 48 hours in London, where I resided for studies at the time. Once it was proven I had called from my student residence in London and I had not left the country for the previous 10 months, I was dismissed.

Gabriel and my mother were also held as primary suspects involved in the disappearance. But they were both seen at the restaurant that night, and at least 5 different witnesses confirmed they were there while my sister and I were on the call.  
After months of silence, today the police closed the case without any plausible explanation of what happened on the night of the 17th of November, 2021. 

The only unofficial version they provided us with is they believe my sister called me to cover up her decision of vanishing. She crashed the window, made up some story of someone getting into the house, banged a few doors, and then just left.

Only she didn’t take any of her belongings, she had no money, and she hasn’t made contact ever since with anyone. Not with mom, not with her best friends, not with me.

She didn’t show any signs of depression or any sign she was planning to leave. 

I found out later that on the 20th of November 2021, her best friend released a statement. In that statement, she claimed she had seen me peeking through the window one night they were having a sleepover in Tanya’s bedroom. My face pushed against the window, no blinking.

The date of my alleged peeking was the 10th of October 2021. The day I gave my last exam at the university. In London.

They dismissed that and the phone call as some kind of subtle psychological game my sister played on all of us.

My mother believes this version, so does her friend. 

I don’t. I know my little sister wasn’t lying. 

I know it because of that night on the bridge at the Baita mine. Because of something I have never wanted to face.

Because I can’t stop thinking of what I saw that night at the pit, before I scared Tanya off the bridge. I can’t stop thinking of the note, of whoever was peeking, and of my sister begging me to leave her alone while on the phone.

I believe her, because I can’t stop thinking of what I saw that night on the bridge.

I believe her, because that night on the bridge I saw a boy standing, smiling in an eerie and horrifying way. 

Smiling like he wanted to hurt us.

I believe her because that boy, the boy standing on the other end of the bridge, looked exactly like me.

[And that’s why I screamed.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lost_Whispers/)
