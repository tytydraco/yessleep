After extensive testing and a thorough examination, Detective Davidson has been officially cleared of possession.

That’s right, Demon Dan has successfully vacated his system, leaving Dustin with only *slight* psychological damage.

(If you're new, you can find what my therapy sessions have covered: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpnsAthenaeum/s/uy48wEsac9)

He doesn’t remember much about the few hours he was shoved into shotgun or how he ended up getting possessed in the first place. All he’s told me is that he remembers feeling really cold and angry. Overall, it was an unpleasant experience, one he wouldn’t wish upon his own worst enemy.

On a totally unrelated note, the division will be holding a mandatory training seminar on the proper precautions to take to protect against possession in the very near future. Yes, I know it’s a mouthful. It was rather enjoyable to see Lieutenant Dawn struggle to read the memo out as he went around announcing it to everyone.

Salt, iron, holy water, a cross, and The Bible are great basic items to have in your possession at all times. If you’re a little more paranoid, or extreme, there are more *permanent* precautions. Like a protective tattoo for example. There was a certain tv show that circulated it around a couple years ago, now that I think about it.

Dustin is seriously debating getting one of these tattoo’s. He has a couple on his forearms that I’ve seen on occasion when his sleeves are pushed up. A purple butterfly and a rose I think. They’re small, but I’m sure meaningful. It might also just be an excuse to get another tattoo though, the symbol is pretty cool looking not gonna lie. That, or he’s more irked by that experience than he’s letting on.

As you can see, we take possession and more importantly precaution, very seriously at the Winchester Police Department Supernatural’s Division. Here, it will literally save your life if you come prepared for anything that might jump out and attack you.

I’m back at work, by the way, if that weren’t obvious already. How’s it going?

Well, if you were to ask me which supernatural cases I hate dealing with the most, I’d say anything involving vampires. They’re gruesome creatures, ruthless and cut throat. They’re even rarer than sirens, so when one pops up it’s a whole annoying mess to deal with. Like an actual mess. When a particularly out of control vampire feeds, it turns into a bloodbath.

And lucky me, I just can’t catch a fucking break. As soon as I set foot back in the precinct, Davidson and I were handed the case of a suspected supernatural serial killer.

In layman’s terms, three murders that share common characteristics and have a cool down period between each kill can be classified as serial murders. The first two victim’s, an older woman and a young man, were all drained of blood and their throats ripped out- classic vampire M.O. The most recent murder of a little girl made three. Like I said, I *hate* vampires.

Dustin and I got to the scene a little after three pm, taking over for the first responding officer. The girl’s body had been found in an alleyway, resting by an overflowing dumpster. The crime scene was cordoned off with that classic yellow tape, a small gathering of curious bystanders on the other side, balancing on the tips of their toes in hopes of seeing something.

The girl’s skin was pale and her little shirt was drenched in blood, throat torn to shreds. Her eyes had glazed over, the life completely drained from them. A permanent expression of terror frozen on her face as her mouth hung open from screaming out her last breath. To throw salt in the wound, a pesky fly crawled in and out of her mouth and on the skin of her face.

She’d been exsanguinated of blood, so lividity wouldn’t be an indicating factor of time of death here. But, based on the fact her jaw still hung open, Rigor Mortis hadn’t set in yet. The stench of sickly sweet iron was too strong for this to have occurred a day or two ago. That meant the body had been fresh, killed only a couple hours ago.

A vamp killing in broad daylight. Bold, but not entirely unheard of.

Lana was the girl’s name. It was written on her purple backpack. There was one of those emergency contact cards in there with the parent’s information as well.

I stood there staring down at the little girl as  a pair of blue latex gloves snapped on the skin on my hands. The background noise of the crime scene investigators, other officers, bystanders, cars, even the nature around the city seemed to fade into nothing the longer I concentrated on Lana. It was just me and her in the world, nobody else.

She reminded me a bit of myself at that age, probably because of the long black hair she had tied up into a ponytail. I also had a purple backpack in elementary school.

A tear slid down my cheek as I mourned for the girl. Lana was so young, had her whole life ahead of her, only for it to be ripped away in an instant. Her promising life in exchange to keep a greedy monster’s appetite at bay. Despicable. She was just a kid walking home from school.

A hot flash of rage swept through my body.

Then a facial muscle in her cheek twitched. Startled, I jumped back, screaming, **“No!”**

After my outburst, the activity around the busy crime scene ceased, everyone’s eyes pointed at me. My partner dropped what he was doing and made his way over to me.

I took multiple steps back, my eyes trained on the unmoving corpse. Uncontrollable tears gushed down my face. Panic gripped my heart, like a vice. Quick shallow breaths left my lungs. My head was spinning. It felt like I was going to die.

Thanks to all my therapy sessions, I recognized it as a panic attack.

Needing to remove myself from the situation, I ducked under the crime scene tape and booked it back to the liftback- Dustin en tow.

I slammed the passenger door shut and locked the car, rolling down my window to let the fresh air in. A slight breeze whooshed in, settling my nerves a little.

Dustin leaned against the vehicle with one arm resting on top of the roof and the other on his hip. He looked down at me with concern. “You good?”

“I will be,” I said with a shuddering breath. My wrists flailed around erratically as I attempted to shake the shock out of my system. I wiped drying tears off my face with my sweaty palms after taking the gloves off.

Dustin pat the top of the liftback twice. “Okay,” he said nonchalantly, walking back over to the crime scene.

Detective Davison was a dear and conducted interviews while I calmed down in his car. Then, together we went around to the surrounding local businesses and requested they hand over any CCTV footage they might have.

While most of the owners were happy to oblige, a couple of them told us to fuck off and come back with a warrant. God, I love small town Michigan. The grit on some of these folks reminded me of the Windy City.

With witness statements, interview notes, and a good bit of security tapes to sift through, Dustin and I headed back to the comfort of the precinct.

The first couple minutes of the car ride were silent. “What was that back there?” Davidson asked, breaking it.

I clicked my tongue against the roof of my mouth. “Would you believe it if I said it was first day back jitters?”

He shot me a quick, stern, glance. “Lucky…”

“I don’t want to talk about it,” my whole body shifted away from him and his gaze as my neck turned to face out the window. I crossed my arms and huffed.

Dustin sighed before he sincerely said, “If you ever *do* want to talk about it, I’m here.”

“Are you ever going to tell me what you really went through while you were possessed?” I mumbled into my chest. After peeking over my shoulder, I found him looking stone faced with his lips pressed together in a hard line.

An awkward silence filled the air between us. The tension grew so thick, you could cut it with a knife.

Then Clair de Lune, Dustin’s ringtone, started playing. He fumbled for a second, reaching around for his phone while keeping his eyes on the road. I rolled my eyes before leaning over and grabbing it out of the center console for him.

“Hey,” Dustin said as he answered the phone, putting it on speaker, “are you thinking what we’re thinking?”

“A vampire? Possibly, yes,” Jane’s semi-muffled voice rang out. Just like his car, Dustin’s phone was old. His model was a good two, three, maybe ten updates behind modern technological standards. “But there’s also the possibility it could be-“

“No,” Dustin cut her off. I shook my head in agreement. Nobody wanted the alternative to be the case. *Especially* me.

A slightly offended pause came from the phone. “I was just saying it’s a possibility. But, yeah, the supernatural we’re most likely dealing with here is a vampire.”

“Great,” I said unenthusiastically, earning yet another glare from my partner.

“Well we’re on our way back to the precinct now,” he informed. “The three of us can sit down and create a profile when we get there.”

“Alrighty then,” Jane said chipperly, “see you soon.” She then promptly hung up the phone.

The rest of the car ride was drowned out with the stale sound of FM radio.

Back at the precinct Jane, Dustin, and I met up and sat down in one of the conference rooms to start working on this profile. Files and papers were scattered and askew all over the large table as we searched for our killers pattern or something to tie the victims together.

Our victims were an old woman, a young man, and a child. Most vampires either have a specific type of person/gender they prefer to drink from. They also typically target almost middle aged to young folk since they tend to be the healthiest of the crop, so to speak. A small portion of the species, however, will drink from anything that lives and breathes. These cretins are the ones we come in contact with most. Based on what we already had, we knew we were dealing with one of the less civilized vamps.

We just needed some sort of connection between the victims that could lead to clues or a pattern that would identify our suspect.

The first victim, Gladys Stokes, was a sixty-five year old widow. Since her kids were all off living their own lives, she spent most of her time down at the animal shelter volunteering. Last week she was found with her throat torn out behind the shelter. Initially, her death was ruled as an animal attack because of the brutality and bite marks. There’s a big wolf and coyote population that live in the woods that surround Winchester. Occasionally, they’re prone to attack, especially if they feel like their territory is being threatened. The animal shelter is located on the edge of the woods so this was a pretty plausible explanation. However, the division would re-open her case and start a death investigation once the serial killer struck again.

Twenty-four year old Shane Embers was the second victim. His body was found in one of the student labs at the hospital with injuries consistent with Gladys a couple days later. Throat ripped to pieces and drained of blood. The coroner highly doubted that a wolf would be able to get inside the hospital, kill a nursing student, and get out completely unnoticed. That’s when he notified Lieutenant Dawn of a possible supernatural going around killing people.

Then of course there’s Lana…

The first connection we ruled out was that they were blood relatives. None of the victims lived remotely close or even knew each other. The next connection to go was religion. Embers was an adamant atheist and Gladys and Lana’s churches were on the opposite side of town.

Pretty much nothing connected our vic’s to one another. This guy was seriously starting to remind me of The Night Stalker.

Jane was definitely the most frustrated out of all of us. She was hardly ever stumped when it came to profiling. It came as easy and natural to her as breathing.

“O-kay! Who wants coffee?” I yelled out nervously after Jane slammed her fist on the conference table particularly hard. The woman was elegant and poise, very rarely did she get temperamental. At least that’s what I’ve noticed in the time since I’ve been here.

Jane didn’t get a choice, she was getting coffee. Dustin, who was nose deep in a file, waved me off. I shrugged my shoulders and left the room.

Lieutenant Dawn cornered me in the kitchen as I brewed Jane’s cup. “How you feeling?” He asked.

I shrugged, pouring a couple table spoons of sugar in my empty mug. “Better.”

Dawn took a step back after he heard my answer, easing the intimidating presence I felt breathing down my neck. “Anything you wanna tell me?”

“Nope,” my lips made a popping sound as I pronounced the p. The coffee machine beeped as Jane’s mug finished brewing. I switched her mug out for mine, adding nothing in hers since she takes it black.

Dawn reached for the cabinet above my head, grabbing an oatmeal cream pie from the snack bin. He ripped open the plastic packaging and took a bite, taking half of the treat with him.

“You will tell me if something happens, right? To you, your partner, even if something bothers you and it’s the smallest thing?”

A forced smile made its way into my face as I turned to my superior. I gave the man a quick two finger salute “Yes sir. I wouldn’t be doing my due diligence if I didn’t.”

Dawn stifled a laugh and rolled his eyes. He ruffled my hair up before walking off with his sweet treat, like he was my dad.

I let out a sigh of relief as I fixed the new flyaways my lieutenant had given me. The space felt more comfortable now that I was alone in it. A good amount of cream was poured into my mug before I carefully made my way back to the conference room.

“Aha!” Jane shouted victoriously, jumping up and down excitedly as I pushed the door to the conference room open with my shoulder.

Dustin threw the file he was reading down in surprise, clearly startled. “What? Did you find something?”

Jane accepted the warm cup of coffee with two hands graciously. She took a small sip with a fat grin. “Yes, I did, because I’m a genius!”

“You wanna share with the class?” I asked, closing the door and taking a seat. Sweet with a slight hint of bitter coffee slid down my throat, making my tummy very happy. “What did you find?”

“They’re all innocent!” Jane proclaimed, gathering up and throwing all three of our victims files open next to each other in the center of the table.

“Yeah, none of them had a criminal record,” Dustin said, leaning back in his chair. “So…?”

Jane crumpled up a blank piece of paper and chucked it at Dustin’s head. It hit his temple and ricocheted onto the floor. I laughed into my mug as I took another sip.

“The victims were morally innocent, ya dummy!” She explained. “An old woman who volunteered at an animal shelter, a young man who was studying health to help save lives, a pure of heart kindergartner that wouldn’t hurt a fly! Can’t you see it?”

“No,” Dustin said flatly. “You look kinda crazy right now.”

“Yeah,” I said, drowning Davidson’s dull answer out. “Whatever killed these people is pretty evil.” My heart sunk to the bottom of my stomach after I said that.

The division’s profiler snapped her fingers. “Exactly! These murders are so gruesome and so evil, and factoring in the victim’s innocence-“

“You can’t seriously be suggesting-“ I cut in.

Jane finished my sentence. “A revenant? Yes, that’s exactly what I’m suggesting. Our victims weren’t killed by a vampire, but a revenant!”

Revenants are a subspecies of vampires. Something goes wrong when they turn and they lose all sense of humanity and become nothing but hungry bottomless pits.

They’re worse than ghouls. They’re worse than *vampires*, and I *hate* vampires! They’re the scum of the earth. Some of the evilest, vilest, creatures on this plane of existence.

“In Winchester? *Really?*” Dustin scoffed, unbelievably.

“Why not?” Jane shrugged her shoulders suggestively and sat down. “There was one in a town only a couple hours away from here last year. That one was a serial killer too.”

I gulped. “What happened to them?”

“Well the murders stopped, so either they were captured and killed by that department’s supernatural division or he skipped town.”

Our very productive conversation was suddenly interrupted by a frantic knock on the conference room door. One of the secretaries cautiously poked her head through and addressed the room. “Detective Davison? Officer Hale? I have a lady on the line who is adamant that she speak with someone handling this case.”

“Is it urgent?” Dustin asked with a yawn.

The secretary nodded her head. “To her it is.”

Dustin sighed and started pulling himself up in his chair.

“I’ll handle it,” I said suddenly, getting up and greeting our colleague at the door. “You guys keep working on that theory.”

I then followed her to the front desk to take the phone call.

I owed it to him for taking over the crime scene earlier. Clearly he didn’t want to talk to this woman on the phone. I didn’t mind the work as this would make things fair between us. Besides, Dustin could sit through one of Jane’s yapping sessions for once. And I love how he squirms when he’s irritated, bored, and uninterested.

“This is Officer Hale, how can I help you?” I spoke into the receiver after Janine, the secretary, handed me the office phone.

“Hi, yes? I think I have information on the individual who might be responsible for some of these killings.”

“You *think* you have information, or you have information?”

The callers breath hitched in her throat, but she quickly regained herself. “I have information. I know who the killer is.”

“What’s your name, Miss? And how do you know who the killer is?” I asked, getting a pen and pad ready.

“W-well, I don’t *know* know who the killer is,” she started, “I just saw him leave the area where that little girl was found. My name is Sage Walker by the way.”

I started scribbling down her information and taking notes. “Can I get your description of the perpetrator, ma’am?”

I’d ask her why she waited so long to call this in later. Winchester is a small town so the news of local’s deaths spreads like wildfire. It was very possible she saw something suspicious but thought nothing of it at the time, only to find out later she could be a key witness.

“H-he’s a brown skinned man, about five foot five or five foot six. Dark, short hair. He was wearing dark jeans, black flannel and a light gray undershirt and was *covered* in blood!” Sage explained frantically over the phone. The more she talked the more worked up she got. She sounded really concerned.

As she continued to walk me through the man’s description, my free ear clued into the sounds surrounding the lobby.

The front door to reception slowly creeped open, heavy footsteps shuffled inside slowly.  The secretaries and other people in the lobby gasped.

“I’m here to turn myself in. I… I think I hurt someone.”

My gaze flicked to the person as their words registered in my head.

“I-I’m going to have to call you back,” I said before promptly hanging up the phone. It was like the person Ms. Walker just described had walked right out of the phone and into the precinct.

The man’s mouth and chin were stained with dry blood. His tanned skin, pale, drenched in sweat. A flannel over shirt was tied around his waste. Giant brown stains covered both the garment and his light gray undershirt. Over all the man looked, and smelled, like death.

Quickly, I raised my gun out of my holster and pointed it at the man’s head. “Get down on your knees, now!” I commanded sternly. “Put your hands behind your back!”

Sheepishly, the man did as I said. His eyes darted around the room nervously, looking extremely uncomfortable and more importantly, guilty.

That rage from earlier started bubbling up in my gut again.

After detaining him, I’d brought the man to one of our special interrogation rooms. We were as safe and secure as we could be in there. The walls were reinforced with a mix of galvanized steel and iron. All of the supernaturals were restrained using silver handcuffs. A tough and sturdy chain bound him to the interrogation table, which was welded into the ground. For extra precaution, I’d slipped some silver ankle cuffs on his legs in case he somehow managed to free himself.

An hour of interrogation later and we’d gotten absolutely nowhere.

The suspect claims he has no memory of who he is or how he got here. He seems to not even realize what he is. All he knows is that he blacks out sometimes. This last time he woke up covered in blood. Knowing what he did was bad, instinct told him to turn himself in. That’s about as far as we got before he started shutting down.

“Is this really necessary?” He asked as one of the forensic technicians scrapped dry blood off of his shirt for testing. A field test concluded the substance  was blood. Another test needed to be conducted in the lab to confirm whether it was human or not. He was then stripped of his bloodied clothes, the fabric being logged in as evidence.

“Yes,” I answered. Then, by my request, The technician carefully lifted up his lip using a gloved pinky finger, revealing a pair of sharper than normal canines.

“Are you sure he’s a revenant?” Dustin asked, leaning close and whispering. “He seems awfully… *there.* And his humanity seems to be intact.”

Right as Dustin said that, he lost control of himself. Our suspect snapped his jaw as the technician removed their hand from his mouth. If the appendage had poked around in there a second longer he’d surely have lost it. A guttural snarl left the suspects mouth as a string of drool started to drip off his lips. The technician quickly gathered their kit and got out of there, hungry eyes following them the entire time.

After a moment, our suspect shook his head, snapping himself out of whatever trance he had gone into. He stared down at his hands shamefully. “Sorry.”

Vampires are rare, revenants even rarer. But a lucid one? Now that’s completely unheard of.

But there I was, staring one in the eyes. They were bloodshot and his pupils were dilated. I’d come across a revenant once before… his eyes were the same.

An unwanted image flashed in my mind. I blinked and shook the memory away. “So what should we call you, revenant?” I asked, leaning over the table to get a better analysis on him.

The man squirmed in his seat under my watchful gaze. Then, timidly, he thought on it for a few seconds before responding, “I’ve always liked the name Rudy?”
