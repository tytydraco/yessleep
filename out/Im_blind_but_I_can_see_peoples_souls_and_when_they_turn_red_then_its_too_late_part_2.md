The air in my apartment was thick with the scent of rain, a cold, earthy dampness that clung to everything. I’d felt the storm brewing all evening, the distant rumble of thunder vibrating through the floorboards, but it wasn’t until the red wisp drifted toward Mia’s room that the world tilted.

My worst fear, the one I’d buried beneath every forced smile and shaky step, clawed its way into being.

I lunged blindly, my hands grasping at nothing but wet air. The hardwood was slick under my bare feet, the storm having blown open a window somewhere, letting the deluge seep inside.

“Mia!” I shouted, my voice raw, but the rain lashed against the walls with such fury that it swallowed the sound. Lightning cracked, illuminating nothing for me, just a deeper black, and I stumbled forward, my shoulder slamming into the bedroom doorway.

“Mia!” I screamed again, louder, desperate, but no response came. The silence beneath the storm’s roar was deafening.

Then I saw it, the way I always did now. A faint glow pierced the void, not the red I’d chased, but something softer. A bluish soul, shimmering like a dying ember, drifted from the room. It moved past me, and in that instant, my chest seized. My knees buckled, and I sank to the floor, tears streaming down my face before I could stop them. They spoke for me, cutting trails through the rain-soaked chill on my skin.

I knew what that blue soul meant. I’d seen it leave before, **too many times.**

I dragged myself forward, hands jolting as they swept the floor, searching. The carpet was sodden, water pooling from the storm, and my fingers brushed against the edge of the bed. I climbed up, fumbling, until they found her, her arm, limp and cool, then her shoulder, and her neck. My hands cupped her face, and I pressed my forehead to hers, willing her to move, to breathe, to laugh at me for being so dramatic.

But she didn’t. **Mia was gone.**

A stream of tears left my useless sockets, and with a lifeless gaze I couldn’t see, I whispered, “Why?”

The storm raged on, as I sat there, cradling her. Time blurred—seconds, minutes, I couldn’t tell, until I fumbled for my phone on the nightstand. My voice shook as I called Diya, our mutual friend, the one who’d known Mia almost as long as I had.

“She’s gone,” I choked out when she answered, and then I broke. I cried like a baby, sobs tearing through me, and I heard Diya’s breath hitch on the other end. She welled up too, her voice cracking as she tried to speak.

*“Ethan, no… oh God, no…”*

There was nothing to be done. We’d both lost a friend, but I—I’d lost more than that. Mia was my light, my tether, and now the dark was all I had left.

I couldn’t comprehend it. I couldn’t breathe. The truth of her departure sank into me like a blade, twisting deeper with every heartbeat. It was shaking me from the inside, hollowing me out until I felt it taking over my very soul—or what was left of it.

Then came the pain, sharp and bursting, like a fist clenched around my chest. My lungs burned, and I gasped, clutching at my shirt as the room seemed to spun. Consciousness slipped away within seconds, and I collapsed beside Mia, the storm’s howl fading into a distant hum.

But I wasn’t gone. The black didn’t swallow me whole. I could still see—souls, flickering in the void like lanterns in a fog. Diya’s blue soul hovered nearby, though tinged with a tremor of grief. Fainter outlines appeared—greens and golds, sharp against the dark—the paramedics, I realized, their voices muffled as they stormed into the apartment.

“Male, late thirties, unresponsive!” one shouted, and I felt hands on me, lifting, pressing, but it was distant, like a memory I wasn’t part of.

My body was failing, but I could still see them. It wasn’t my mind conjuring these visions, not some echo of my lost eyes. It was my soul—my own essence—reaching out, perceiving what no flesh could. After the accident, when my sight died, my soul had woken up, rewired to witness the living and the damned.

The thought settled over me, heavy, as the paramedics worked.

Curiosity—gnawed at me. If I could see them, could I see myself? I drifted towards the floor where water had pooled from the broken window. The storm had calmed, leaving a shallow mirror of rain behind. I focused, willing my perception to turn inward, and there it was: my soul, glowing in the dark. but...

**Red**. The same crimson I’d feared for a year, the hue of death, of endings. It pulsed faintly, weaker than the others I’d seen, but unmistakable.

The worst realization crashed over me. I’d seen it before—months ago, in the bathroom mirror, right before the embolism nearly took me. I’d mistaken it then, thought it was a reflection of someone else, but it had been me all along. My soul carried the red, the mark I’d watched claim so many.

I couldn’t fight it, couldn’t run from it. I had to accept it—accept my own being, whatever that meant now.

Time slipped again, and then I was waking.

“Ethan… Ethan…” Diya’s voice cut through the haze, soft but urgent. “Thank God you’re back.”

My mind clawed its way to the surface, adjusting to the sterile beep of a hospital room. I couldn’t see her face, but her soul shimmered before me—blue, just like Mia’s had been, a quiet echo of the woman I’d lost.

I lay there with an aching chest, the IV cold in my arm. Two days, they told me later—I’d been out for two days, a clot in my chest again, another brush with the red. But I’d survived. Again. The doctors called it luck, but I knew better. The red in me wasn’t done yet.

Diya sat beside me and I wondered if she’d stay, if she’d anchor me the way Mia had. But the question lingered, sharper than the pain: what was I now? The red souls I’d feared, were they warnings?, or were they me? Had I marked Mia somehow, drawn that wisp to her? Or was I just another victim, tethered to a fate I couldn’t outrun?

Outside, the rain had stopped, but the dark remained. And in it, my soul burned red.
