I don’t know if you’ll ever see this but here it is.



The fire had grown, roaring away. The logs and branches we had tossed inside were snapping and popping, as the fire consumed them. Its warmth kept the cold at bay, melting the matted down snow around the fire pit.

“How long do we have to wait again?” I asked, watching my hotdog roll in a slow circle on a weiner stick. My friend rolled his eyes from across the fire.

“One in the morning dude, I told you already.” He took a swig from his beer bottle. Most other college students spent their time partying and trying to get girl’s numbers. But not us. We were going to find a ghost, apparently. “Why, you getting tired already?” he asked. I was but he wasn’t getting that satisfaction from me.

“No but I am getting bored, is this all we have to do?” I asked. This was the lamest ghost ritual I had ever heard of. No drawing sigils or anything. You just had to sit around in the fucking boonies with your weinie stick. My friend sighed, giving a dejected look towards the fire.

“Yes, she needs to see our flame. It’ll be like a beacon to her. She’s lost out there somewhere.” He muttered. Our professor had put the idea into his head and now he wouldn’t let it go. He had begged me to come with him. I liked to pretend I had better things to do, but it would surely spice up what would have been another weekend of smoking dope and stinking up the dorm. Now I could at least do it outside.

“Then what?” I asked. “Do we talk to her?” My friend sighed, shaking his head. 

“We take her picture and then we get rich from it.” he said matter of factly. I laughed.

“That’s it? We can’t talk to her or anything? Ask her about the afterlife, or something?” I waved a hand around the makeshift campsite. “We didn’t even bring a ouija board or anything?” Ted shook his head.

“I wasn’t going to bring a ouija board dude. Bad mojo, we could get a demon to come through or something.” I laughed again.

“What kind of ghost hunter are you?”

“The kind that’s going to get super rich. I might even let you have some of the profits.” I snorted, digging into my pocket. I only had two joints left, and would have smoked both of them myself, but today I was feeling generous.

“Here.” I said tossing it over. “How did she die again, drowning?” Ted nodded. Catching the joint, as I lit mine.

“There’s that creek that runs through here. She was super crazy back in the day apparently. A fucking serial killer.” It was the only thing I had ever paid attention to in the old codger’s class. The lady had been a settler back in the day, living in the very woods we were in. Her husband had been a trapper, selling furs for hats. The wife was a recluse rarely showing her face to the small town Fernsworth had been.

This hadn’t done anything for her reputation, and people had started referring to her as what is now a proper bitch. Despite this the husband was a kind man, and they lived happily for a time. Then one particularly brutal winter had brought mountains of snow with it. The couple had been trapped deep in the woods, in their squat cabin. This had broken the woman’s mind. When the snow finally melted, some townspeople had made their way to the cabin. They had found the woman, dressed in her husband’s clothes.

The skin of his face had been turned into a mask and she wore it, her eyes wild beneath it. The townspeople had tried to run, but in their panic failed to notice the traps left behind. One man had been caught in a bear trap, his leg severed in two. The other man had run into a snare trap, not designed for rabbits, but for people. He had struggled and flailed, as he watched the woman approach him with a bloody hatchet. 

When the men had never come back, more townspeople went in their wake. They had found a grisly scene. The woman, being broken by cabin fever, had been eating the men, their limbs laying scattered on the forest floor. Upon being found, she let out a banshee-like scream and fled into the trees, before plunging into a nearby stream that had swallowed her whole. They hadn’t looked for the body. Now the legend claimed if you sat around a campfire in the woods, you could see her, or hear her.

The last of the details fizzled in my mind as I puffed away on my joint, the haze fogging my mind. Ted looked at his phone, the bright screen making his eyes squint. 

“Fifteen more minutes then it happens.” I could hear the anticipation in his voice. Fifteen minutes passed and nothing happened. My eyes kept trying to close, and my joint had burned down to its end. 

“Alright man, we tried, can we go now?” I asked. Ted sighed.

“We got lied to man, I feel like a fish right now.” I waved my hand, not bothering to say I told you so. Instead I kicked snow onto the fire. We were walking away when Ted turned suddenly.

“What?” I asked him. He stood still hands at his sides. I felt my heart beat faster, the blood beating away the sludge of the weed. “The fuck’s the matter with you?” I tugged on his arm, but he shook me off.

“Sounds so beautiful,” he muttered. He was fucking with me, desperate to make something of the night. I turned around and started walking away, expecting him to yell boo or something behind me. Instead he ran into the woods. His footsteps faded into the darkness. I whirled around watching him disappear into the shadows.

“Ted what the fuck!” I yelled. Like a coward I froze, for a good thirty seconds. Then I sprinted after him, fumbling my phone from my pocket. I swore as my cold fingers turned on the flashlight and then dropped the phone. Hurriedly picking it up from the snow I ran in what I thought was the right direction. “Ted!” I shouted. “Come on dude this isn’t funny.” My voice shook. Footsteps plunged further into the dark trees.

I ran in their direction slamming into the bark of a tree and down into the snow. The cold seeped in chilling me. Quickly scrambling to my feet I plunged further into the woods, until I ran right into Ted. It was like hitting a brick wall, my head ached, as I looked up. He was gone by the time I gathered myself the void swallowing him whole.

“Ted, come back!” I screamed. Terror shook me as I pushed through ever deepening snow. The trees stared down at me as I passed by, their frozen limbs like crooked fingers. All of them pointed deeper into the woods. Somehow I found Ted again. He stood at the bank of a frozen stream. The one in the story, I had no doubt in my mind. He swayed, his eyes vacant as he stared down at it. “Ted please, come back, we’re lost. We could die out here dude!” I pulled on his arm to no avail, his feet were frozen to the ground.

“Can you hear it Ian?” he asked. I stopped tugging, only managing to shake my head. “She has such a nice voice, listen.” His arm moved faster than I thought possible, grabbing me by the back of my neck. Panicking I struggled trying to pry his fingers off me, but he had an iron grip. 

“Let go!” I screamed into his ear, beating and flailing against him, all to no avail. That was when the song seeped into my ears. There were no words, only whistling. Ted was right, it was beautiful. Like the most heavenly birdsong you’d ever heard. It rooted itself into my brain, and I stopped struggling. My light shone across the frozen surface on the ice. Something was moving underneath it. They were hands, so many of them.

Some beckoned, and some beat on the ice. My mouth was dry and my mind folded in on itself. Ted moved, his feet crossing onto the ice dragging me with him. I fought with all of my strength scratching his hand. We moved further onto the ice, my feet dragging behind me as Ted drug me with the strength of a gorilla. The song grew in volume, growing all the more heavenly as we approached the hands moving in frenzy knocking against the ice. Something cracked.

My mind racing I lunged up and bit Ted’s neck. He jerked suddenly and let me go.

“Jesus Christ!” he turned to me, hand clamped on his neck. Then he looked around. “Where are-” The ice shattered. The hands raced upwards, grabbing Ted. His mouth made an O, and then he was gone. I ran. Somehow, some way making my way back through the woods, back to my car. It wasn’t until I had gotten back into town, that I stopped. Tears made my eyes red, and my hands shook. Ted’s face was burned into my mind, there one second gone the next.

The song still plays in my head. The police questioned me to no end. I didn’t tell them about the hands, they would have never believed me. Instead I lied. Told them he ran into the woods, and I had tried to stop him. Then he drowned. His death was ruled a suicide, his parents glares told me who they blamed.

That was almost four months ago now. Even as I sit alone in my room, I hear the whistling. It follows me everywhere. Nothing about the story said anything about whistling, and nobody said anything about how many people went missing in those woods. I don’t know what telling this will accomplish. But I’m going back out there. The whistling is calling me, and I can’t resist it.
