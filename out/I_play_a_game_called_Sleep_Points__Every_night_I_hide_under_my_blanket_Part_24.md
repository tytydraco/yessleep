Even though I had at least thought ahead enough to sleep in the warmest pajamas I could find, that didn't stop the blistering cold from making me regret not just laying down in bed and letting The Sandman take me. After all, this was only a dream, and I KNEW that. What made me wanna jump out the window with Ezra? Surely The Sandman couldn't hurt me in my dreams too, could he?

But that was just the thing: I honestly didn't know. I guess my risk averse nature just instinctively prevented me from wanting to find out. I started questioning why I even BOTHERED with pajamas in the first place. I already knew Ezra would be coming up and that I'd have to follow him through miles of snow to get to where we were going. I should've just gone to bed in the same amount of layers, parka included, that I had used when walking all the way up the Anastasia's place like a week and a half ago. Sure, I wouldn't've been able to go to sleep very comfortably, even WITH the full moon. But hey. At least then I wouldn't have to worry about Ezra infecting my dreams once again. I wouldn't've gotten access to the store, but by the time I hit the ground and felt the same intense pain in my legs as last time, reminding me of all the suffering he had put me through, in that moment I would've EASILY traded access to the Sleep Points store in exchange for not having to relive all of THAT. But of course, that trade wasn't up to me.

Just like in the last dream, I just kinda laid there pitifully in the snow for a few seconds feeling like it was impossible to move.

"Better get movin' goy. Unless ya feel like dyin'. And I don't blame ya if ya do. The world'd be better off withoutcha anyway. Kinda like Truman. Just ask the slavic bitch, she'll tell ya." "Slavic bitch" of course being Ezra's all too endearing little nickname for Anastasia. 

I looked behind me and was just in awe of the fact that The Sandman hadn't ALREADY eaten me alive. No amount of pain mattered. Fight or flight kicked in and I got up and started running with him as he took out his lighter and guided the way. I wondered how many times he had done this. How could you run through so many miles of snow so many times with an active lighter in hand without tripping and falling and burning yourself alive? I just had to remember that this was HIS dream, not mine. HE was the one who decided what happened, so I figured it only made sense that he'd let himself get away with doing the most bone-headedly reckless bullshit without consequence.

So why was I so afraid? Why did I see such a need to run? It wasn't like it was gonna help. Even if The Sandman COULD kill me in a dream, it wasn't as if whether or not he did that was up to me. I could run as fast as I wanted to and if Ezra wanted him killing me off, he just would. And it probably didn't even matter if I stood still for the same reason. If he didn't me dead yet, I wouldn't be. And yet I just kept running. It didn't matter that I knew it was useless to save me. I just kept doing it. Was it even ME doing it?

It didn't matter that I knew it was all a dream. I just couldn't convince myself of that. I knew on a conscious level that it was, but that didn't stop it from FEELING like real life. It was just like the real world, except I didn't seem to have any control AT ALL over my actions, since those seemed to all be in Ezra's hands. He controlled the dream. He controlled what I did. He even seemed to control what I thought and how I felt. It was like I was completely powerless until the nightmare was all over. Which couldn't possibly have come soon enough.

I tripped so many times in the snow while running. I got so frustrated and tried so hard to focus on where my feet were going. And yet it never helped. I just kept tripping and falling face first into a mouth full of snow. I even bit my tongue so badly when I fell it started to bleed. A piece had even gotten bitten off. And as if that ALONE didn't hurt enough, the freezing cold only made the pain a million times WORSE.

"Why the fuck do you even bother, goy? Why bother even living? You'll only spend the rest of your life in even MORE agony than right now. That's REALLY the life you wanna live? You're so cucked to your survival instincts that you still wanna live, even through THAT? You're never gonna be. You'll wake up, but you'll still be The Sandman's bitch. You'll never live free. Don't you get it, goy? There's no longer even the slightest fucking POINT. You always give up on everything so fucking easily. What makes you think you have the right to not give up on LIFE too?"

He was right. I DID get frustrated and give up pretty easily. But, as frustrated as I was in that moment, as much as I wanted to let go and die, he wasn't even letting me do THAT. He knew how to push my buttons. He knew how to piss me off enough to wanna stay alive. So I did. I got up. I didn't even give a fuck about keeping myself alive. I just needed to tackle him and pin him to the ground, while punching the everloving shit outta him, just like Truman woulda done. All I needed was the absolute PRICK going down WITH me.

I started sprinting after him. It was torture. The pain in my leg, the pain in my tongue, the blood building up in my mouth, I'd say I was in hell, but in that moment I felt like I woulda rather been in hell, since at least then I'd only have to deal with whatever Satan felt like doing to me, which couldn't've been any worse.

He just kept staying barely outta reach. No matter how far I ran, he just kept easily dashing away, evading the ass-kicking he deserved. I never even came close to catching up with him. I was infuriated. I was depressed. I was in excruciating pain. It was the new moon, so god only KNEW when I'd finally wake up. He at least didn't seem to be able to control THAT. Unless, y'know, he could. But, as it would turn out, and obviously I had no idea at the time, he actually couldn't. Whether or not I woke up was something neither he nor I could consciously decide. Not that it mattered. If he had had it his way, it probably woulda gone on for just about as long.

"WHEN THE FUCK DO WE GET THERE?" I shouted with all my lungs to make sure the bastard heard me.

"We get there when I say we get there," he said, cooly. Great. I was practically suffocating trying to get the loudest shout in possible, and he could just talk to me like it was a normal conversation and he was standing perfectly still. It's like he was rubbing in my face how fine and dandy everything got to be for HIM while I was in constant torture.

"Keep bitchin' and it'll take a shitload longer," he taunted.

I know I could've only been asleep for 9 and a half hours max, since I'd have to be up by 6:30 and I went to bed at 9, but it felt like DAYS. I didn't know if Ezra had the power to make the dream feel longer than it was or if the pain and misery I was going through just made it feel that much longer, but either way, if it had been midnight when I jumped out the window, it should've been lunch time by the time we got to College High.

"Well, you know what to do. Open the door now, if you don't mind," I said, trying to be done with this whole thing.

"Nah. I wanna make you dance. You thought you were done, goy? We ain't even fuckin' STARTED."

And he meant it. However long I felt like I had spent running up to the school, it wasn't even CLOSE to how long he had me running around it, just barely outta The Sandman's reach. He'd scratch, scrape, and claw my back, my neck, and the back of legs. But he'd never take me. He'd never just end it all. And it kept going on like that for what felt like an eternity.

Until finally he just straight up made the front door to the school disappear. He didn't even bother melting the lock off with his lighter like last time. He didn't need to. He could just make shit like that happen whenever he felt like it. Though he still had plans for the lighter. God awful, monstrous plans.

But for the time being, he just led me into the stairwell and slammed his head into it all over again. The Sandman was towering over me. The stairs were gone. It wasn't even a stairwell anymore. I couldn't run away to the second floor of the school even if I had wanted to. I was backed into a corner, with the only way out being through the wall.

But maybe it wouldn't be so bad. After all, in books like Harry Potter, whenever students have to go to platform 9 and three quarters, they have to run through a wall too, and that never hurts them. They just have to believe, and they get through just fine. Well, either I didn't believe hard enough, or it just always hurt like that. I ran into the wall headlong, just like Ezra, and felt like I had given myself a full-blown concussion as I felt the blood trickling down the sides of my head.

"Wakey, Wakey, 'fore I cum on your face-y" he sang in this demented fuckin sing-songy voice. I probably don't even have to TELL you that the moment he saw the look of abject revulsion on my face, he started laughing like a goddamn coked up hyena.

"Y'know, they don't call me 'edgelord' for nothin'. Want me to edge you, goy?" he said, with his characteristically twisted smirk more self-satisfied than ever.

"Just - " I started. "Just take me to where we're going. You sick, sick fuck," I said.

"Woah, woah, woah now goy. I ain't sick. If I were sick, there'd be a cure. And trust me. No dipshit 'scientist' is gonna come up with a cure for ME," he said. For whatever reason, he seemed really \[roud of the fact that there was nothing that cure whatever was wrong with him. I'm sure he felt like a badass, but at the same time, I'm also pretty confident it was all cope. Looking at him nowadays, he doesn't honestly seem to like the fact that he can't be cured. Not that he'd ever admit it. And hey, maybe even back then, he felt the same.

"Alright, les head to the Sacred Space then, if that you're that fuckin ready. And you're not. I already know," he said, maintaining the same twisted pleasure as before. That's when he brings in the lighter, by the way.

I was already somewhere I didn't recognize. For a moment, I had wondered if this was some part of the school that I just didn't know about. From my point of view at the time, it must've been. And, funnily enough, it was. Though soon enough, he'd take me down a path that wasn't. A path that no one who wasn't part of Sleep Points could access. And boy would I wish he hadn't.

He started down the tunnel-like area it looked like we were in. It was a pretty long, though enclosed space. All sorts of forks in the tunnel where I had no choice but to trust the guy when it came to which path to go down. Though every time I followed him, I felt like a total dipshit. Why was I trusting him? He was just gonna lead me to a place that wasn't anywhere NEAR where I wanted to be. But even though I knew that, I just kept following him. Not like I had a choice. No matter what argument I made to myself not to do it, I still did. Still Ezra kept making me. But he also knew how to make me feel as though it was all MY decision. That way, I'd still feel like a dumbass for going along with him.

"You said Anastasia'd be happy that I got Truman killed, why is that?" I asked.

"Like I said: The slavic bitch'll tell ya. Unless she's too fuckin drunk to string together a coherent sentence. I've seen these commie slavic types. Always too fuckin smashed out their minds to say anything reasonable. Lemme know if she can't talk cuza how out of it she is. Wouldn't even surprise me if she was. She basically always is," he said.

"No she isn't. She usually says plenty of reasonable things," I responded.

"Yeah, I'll bet you'd think that. Just get her drunk enough. Get her to talk enough. You'll see her for the dumbass bitch she actually is. I know you don't wanna think that, thanks to how you're always puttin' that pussy on a pedestal, but you should learn right the fuck now that it's true," he said.

"And hey, now that you're killin' Truman, she might even put out."

"I already knew Truman prob'ly treated Annie like shit. Doesn't mean he deserves to die," I said.

"Yeah he does. She'd even agree with you. But I want you to hear why from her. You wouldn't buy it from me. Truman blames the slavic bitch for his involvement with ol' Sammy. And he's right. Without her, youda never told him shit."

"You're telling me Annie MADE me tell him about the post-it note?" I asked.

"Were you not even LISTENING? Uh, YEAH," he said.

"So then... Is it her fault I'M in the game too?" I asked.

"I dunno. But prob'ly, yeah. That'd be just like her. I don't even know why you wanna get in her pants so bad. She ain't worth your time, goy. Trust me, you could do better. Anyone could."

"You're lying about her. You ALWAYS lie."

"Oh, do I really now? Didn't she already tell ya that you can't even trust me to lie?" he asked.

"Well yeah, but I still know when you are. You're not as slick as you think."

"Oh yeah? Well y'know what? Fuck it. I'll letcha think that. It'll help me more anyhow."

"Yeah. I'll bet you'd say that. You want me to THINK that I can't tell when you're fulla shit. But I do." Unfortunately, though, he was right. I really didn't.

"Welp, here's the sanctuary. Take a good look. It's the last place you'll ever be safe. Anyway, we gotta head down the Sacred Space," he said. I didn't know where the hell that was supposed to be. The Sanctuary looked like a total dead end. Maybe there was another wall I'd have to smash my head through in order to get there. But no. Cuz then he started chanting.

"nesich housh, sima at msalti, anna kah at nishmati lenze." I had no idea what the fuck he just said. Next thing I knew, I was being sucked into whatever hell-portal he had just summoned. And then, there we were. The Sacred Space. I looked around. I didn't even know how to react. I saw all the faces of all sorts of people. Dead people. People who were taken. But my eyes were drawn to one specific face. I didn't know how I knew it, but I knew on some instinctual level that that was Wendy Peterson. That was what had become of her. I was just glad Anastasia wasn't here with me to see it. I don't think she would've been able to take it. Her face was frozen, but in so much agony.

She didn't even look dead. She looked undead. Like she was still suffering so much more than even I had on my way up here. And that she would for all eternity. She was in hell. Actual hell. I thought, on my way up, that I'd prefer hell. But after seeing all these faces, frozen in stone, frozen in perpetual and infinite agony, I immediately knew better. I had to put off that fate for myself for as long as I could. And that was how I ultimately came to the conclusion that I would, at some point, have to break the clock. As of now, I haven't done it yet. But I know I will. Very soon. I'll have to. It's either that, or having to face the same fate for myself sooner than I have to.

"So now for the fun part," he said, as two metal chains sprung from the ground and clinched my wrists, making me fall to the floor, right on my face.

I still had open wounds from The Sandman's clawing and scraping. I hear a click. He turned on his lighter. He put it right up against the wounds. Even just touching them would've hurt like hell, but Ezra was putting a flame to them. To all of them. I knew that he had said some deeply Satanic shit. Something that I wouldn't wanna repeat if I wanted a snowflake's chance in hell of getting to heaven. And the worst part is the fact that when he put the flame to my open wounds in my back, and in the back of my neck, and the back of my legs, I felt like I was in complete control. That God would hold me accountable for what I did next: I repeated after Ezra.

"nesich housh, sima at msalti, anna kah at nishmati lenze." And that was it. My soul was irredeemably damned to hell. I could see the work of Christ's sacrifice for me on the cross fading away, never to return. For having said what I did, I had blasphemed against the holy ghost itself. I could no longer ever hope for any fate better than eternal hellfire. And then The Sandman appeared. But he didn't wanna kill me.

"Your wish is granted," he said with the same ghostly voice that I had heard the week prior, when he escaped my clock and I was only hours away from being taken. "You have 340 points. Choose your reward."

And then I was presented with a menu. A menu of all the things I could now afford thanks to all the Sleep Points I had earned for myself. I took a moment to look through everything I could buy. There was an elixir that could free me from guilt. I still felt horrible for having been responsible for Truman's death. I knew that if I were a decent human being, that I'd let myself feel how I deserved. But in the moment, I couldn't. I bought it for 300 Sleep Points. I've never felt guilt ever since, and it's made me a fucking monster. I drank it. I woke up.

I checked my phone. A big 40 right in the middle. And a little rectangle that I could now tap on to spend even more, if I dared. And I definitely did dare. It's the only reason I'm still alive today to tell you all about any of this. I would say I have regrets, but I spent enough Sleep Points to never regret again as well. Even when I should. I know I shouldn't've done it, but since I no longer have it in me to regret, I just don't feel bad about having done it. That's why I don't feel bad about being personally responsible for roping someone else into Sleep Points. You probably hate me, but I don't hate myself. All that's left within me is a drive to survive. To evade the eternal damnation that I bought for myself on that night. And to this day, I'm still running.
