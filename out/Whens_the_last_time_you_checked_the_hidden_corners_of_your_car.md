I opened my trunk and pulled out two bottles of Kirkland Signature moonshine. With one hand free, I decided it was finally time to move the hatchet and extra twine from my car, because it had been a month since I picked up the extra firewood. I reached inside, felt something rubbery, and dropped the moonshine to the ground when I realized it was a blue human hand at room temperature. 

The most intense moments happen just like that, getting embedded into everyday life sans the fanfare a cinematographer would deem appropriate. I watched my brother chase a soccer ball into the street when we were in elementary school, and I stared in silent shock as the ensuing car accident ripped his leg off in a bloody mess. That level of triple-distilled fear burned through me now, grasping at my diaphragm and denying me the chance to breathe as I accepted the unchanging fact that at least part of a dead body had been residing in my trunk for an indeterminate amount of time. 

I dazedly picked up the moonshine from the asphalt. At least it came in sturdy plastic bottles. I unscrewed the cap, took a sip of liquid fire, and called 911.

“Does the name Kelsey Rodriguez sound familiar to you?”

I stopped dicing my beef and turned all my focus to the phone call. Nineteen attempts over the past thirteen hours had yielded nothing but voicemails, dead ends, and every other type of runaround from the Pasadena Police Department. I was shocked to finally get a detective, and was frothing at the mouth for answers. “Um – it’s familiar, I think…” My head spun even more than it had over the past day as I tried to organize my thoughts. 

“She exchanged several texts with you last Friday night. They were the final correspondence on her phone.”

“Oh yeah – the Tinder girl,” I mumbled as the scrambled memory finally organized itself in my head. 

“We’ve IDed her as the woman in your trunk.”

I leaned over and puked in the sink. After wiping my mouth with a trembling wrist, I tried to talk again. “What – what – why?”

“We’d like to talk with you and see if we can piece together some answers.”

My head felt like a merry-go-round. “Okay. I can come by the station-”

“We’ll send a car over to pick you up. Just sit tight and wait for us, Mr. White.”

It happened again after the line went dead: all sensory input proceeded as normal, no matter how horrible I felt. I needed answers. So did the police. 

That’s when it felt like a firework exploded in my head. 

They were coming to pick me up. The guy who had a dead woman in his trunk. A woman he’d met on Tinder.

We shared a *shit*ton of DNA on Friday night. 

The world spun faster as I thought of the hatchet, twine, and alcohol I’d left in the trunk. 

I was nearly knocked over by the sudden memory of Kelsey talking about her ex: “He’s extremely jealous. I think he follows me everywhere I go… He’s threatened to hurt me. He has access to a lot of information, because he’s a cop.”

Oh, shit.

I had only seen that conversation as an opportunity to look protective, safe, and masculine. I guess it worked. Fuck. 

I looked up to see a police car pulling up outside my house. 

I looked down to see the bloody chef’s knife lying in a pool of beef blood. 

I realized that I had been ten steps behind the whole time.

I ran out the back door and didn’t stop.

I’ve been hiding in a large park by the foothills ever since walking here. I’ll post this on my phone and then ditch my cell so they can’t track me, but I have to get this out first.

I swear that I’m innocent, but a corpse filled with semen doesn’t tell a sympathetic story. I don’t know how long I can hide from the police, and I don’t know what will happen when they finally catch up with me. 

Because a few minutes ago, I found a Polaroid just behind a nearby tree. I didn’t want to look at it, but of course I did, and of course I regretted it. 

It was a shot of me with Kelsey, in my bed. 

It had been taken from outside my bedroom window. 

I dropped it and ran, realizing afterward that I’d gotten my fingerprints on something that her ex has almost certainly recovered. I only stopped running when I got to the edge of the park and found a lone police car sitting in the corner. It looked like it had been there for some time. Waiting. 

I don’t know how much longer I have. But there’s no way this ends well for me. Until then, I’ll keep running. 

It’s amazing how long fear can keep us [going](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/).
