[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13v8555/i_found_something_wrong_with_my_3d_prints/)

I apologize if my thoughts appear scattered today; my mind feels foggy, making it difficult to gather my words. It's been a struggle just to log in and start writing this. Something deeply unsettling is happening in my apartment, and I'm slowly accepting that there may not be a rational explanation. Now, as I stare at the screen, an eerie feeling creeps over me, and I can't help but wonder if this first update might be my final entry.


First and foremost, I want to express my immense gratitude for the support you've shown me regarding the strange events unfolding in my life. In case you missed my previous posts, you can catch up on the story [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13v8555/i_found_something_wrong_with_my_3d_prints/). To be honest, I didn't expect to be writing again so soon, but the past few days have been filled with unnerving occurrences, and I desperately need guidance.


After reading replies to my previous post, I tried followed some fantastic advice from the community, including the suggestion to burn sage. However, things took an unexpected turn. The sage I ordered as part of my grocery delivery was substituted with a small potted plant. The sight of fresh sage was lovely, but I couldn't bring myself to burn its delicate leaves. Instead, I decided to keep the plant on my windowsill, hoping it would offer some protection. When I'm near it, I do feel a sense of calm, similar to the feeling I get when I'm in bed. Maybe it's just the soothing effect of having a houseplant nearby, or perhaps I'm being paranoid.


I want to give a special thanks to two individuals who have reached out to help me; their assistance has been invaluable. The first person, Sarah, initially directed me to nosleep. Although she initially messaged me on a different account, she recognized my situation right away. She reassured me that I’d made the right decision by posting, and even gave me some pointers about how best to get help from the rest of you. Which may be her undoing, because I’d actually like to get some second opinions about how things are going between us.


 She started out supportive and understanding, but quickly became overbearing. Our communication seems strained, almost like everything we say always gets twisted to have just the wrong connotation, and everything’s taken in the worst way possible. She even claims I went off on her about not respecting Lord Sebu in private messages, but I have no recollection of writing such a thing. It's as if she's finding reasons to be upset with me. Moreover, she's been insistent on obtaining a copy of the Lord Sebu STL file and the G-code I used to print it. I'm hesitant to share them due to concerns about potential viruses or other dangers associated with the strange hacker-tags on my prints. It's starting to feel like she has some dark obsession with it, and I must admit, I'm feeling uneasy talking to her. Sorry, Sarah, if you're reading this. I have to be honest. What do the rest of you think?


The second person who came forward is Doctor Morgan, an Egyptology professor. Many of you recommended finding an expert, and it turns out I didn't even have to search! Doctor Morgan has been incredibly kind and has been helping me analyze the Lord Sebu statue. Strangely, whenever I try to upload pictures of it, I encounter errors. Nevertheless, based on my descriptions and the hieroglyphs, he was able to identify the statue as Lord Sebu. That brings some relief, as he assures me that statues of Lord Nebu have no history of evil connotations or curses associated with them. However, he's stumped by the strange 'umbrella with two handles' symbol that appears on every 3D print since Lord Sebu. But that's a good thing, right? It confirms that it has no connection to to Egypt at all, it must be just some hacker tag like I originally thought. Knowing I was right all along really calms me. Doctor Morgan has been an incredible friend, always saying just the right thing and providing unwavering support. Lord Sebu approves.


In a distressing turn of events, the Neb-Sebu statue has been missing for several days now. It has a tendency to vanish, but this time it's been gone for longer than usual. I know it makes me nervous but my hands feel empty without it. To make matters worse, my dreamcatcher fell again, but I've taken precautions by placing it inside a large picture frame securely nailed into the studs. I've been able to sleep peacefully since then, although I occasionally hear tapping noises against the glass, possibly from some kind of insect or rodent attracted to the scent of the eagle feathers or glue. Maybe that explains the little articulated plastic men left behind my bed and the strange red welts or wounds on my extremities. I hope it's not bedbugs, but I don't think they leave half-moon shaped marks. Any ideas?


Sarah also suggested I post a picture of my journal to see if anyone notices anything peculiar. Although I haven't written in it since I started documenting everything here, I understand the feeling of reading something you don't remember writing. I'm attaching a photo [here](https://imgur.com/49ohwDp) of the open page for your input.


To be honest, I'm starting to feel a bit foolish about this whole thing. Everything seems to have a rational explanation, unfortunate incidents that can be explained away. I'm not sure if it's just my nerves or something genuinely amiss, but I feel oddly calm, as if a weight has been lifted. Maybe it's the certainty that I'm not alone in this, that there are people out there willing to help. Or perhaps it's the soft chanting sound that comes from beneath my bed, lulling me into a peaceful, dreamless sleep. I'm not sure anymore. Maybe the answers lie in surrendering to this enigmatic embrace, for there is a peculiar serenity that accompanies the unknown. Neb-Sebu would never let any harm befall me. He is my friend. I am not afraid. In fact, I'm looking forward to what awaits me beyond the edge of comprehension.


Thank you for taking the time to read this update. I apologize if it was uneventful or boring. I'm not sure why I even bothered sharing. I appreciate your support. Farewell, friends!
