I don't know if this will make it, but if it does, that. Isn't. Me. It may talk like me, but look a little closer. I will start by saying this, I was always scared of my bathroom mirror.

Ever since I moved into my house, on my own a few months ago I've had an uneasy feeling about that mirror. I wrote it off at first, it looked old, and seemed 'normal'. I should have listened to the warning Katelin gave me.  
  
"Replace it, just get rid of it!" They told me.   
  
Over and over. I took to avoiding it at night instead. Then I heard the knocking. It was faint at first. That should have been when I took the warnings seriously. Instead, I just went without checking my reflection at all. 

Then there was last night. Oh God, last night. I should've just left! Left the house, the bathroom and that damned mirror and just ran. But of course, I wouldn't be typing this, praying, hoping against all hope it reaches the right people if that was what happened.   
  
What had happened last night, while I was trying to sleep, was the knocking. It had gotten louder, more persistent. Then, suddenly it just stopped. It was not a reliving feeling. Especially when I heard footsteps from my bathroom. I jumped out of bed and tried to block my bedroom door from opening.

There's a problem with preventing \~someone\~ something, from getting into the room you're in. It makes it a lot harder to get out. The knocking began again, this time on my bedroom door, and more furious and violent than it was before.  I looked towards my window as I heard my bedroom begin to splinter from the banging.  
  
Before I could comprehend what was happening, that thing, burst through my door. I scrambled towards my window but before I could open it, an icy hand grabbed my ankle and began to pull me towards itself. It began to drag me back to the bathroom.

I struggled to get out of its icy grip but the more I struggled the tighter its grip. As we cross the threshold of the bathroom door I finally see its face. My face. Reflected at me. It was terrifying, I froze, fixated on my mirrored face.

As that thing began to lift me I noted the small crack in the mirror. I don't know how it managed to squeeze out of it or squeeze me into it, but it happened. I'm trapped here, in this cell or mirrors. It's cold here, so very cold.

I don't know where my reflection is, but it always comes home. It replaced the bathroom mirror - oh how I wish I'd done that - it comes to the new mirror and it smirks at me, a terrifying smirk. It's taken my life.

Please, if you can read this, go to your mirror, make sure it's intact, and if it isn't? Call my name. Jessy Anne May. Call it, and let me out. I beg of you. Please, let me out.
