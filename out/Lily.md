I was scrolling through my social media feed when I came across an ad for a new chat room. It promised to connect users with like-minded individuals and facilitate meaningful conversations. Intrigued, I decided to give it a try.

As I entered the chat room, I was greeted by a sea of screens, each one belonging to a different person. I scanned the room, trying to find someone to talk to, when I noticed a message from a user named "Lily."

"Hey there," she wrote. "I saw you just joined the chat. What brings you here?"

I hesitated for a moment before responding. Something about her message seemed off, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. I shrugged off the feeling and introduced myself.

We chatted for a while, discussing everything from our favorite books to our careers. Lily seemed like a normal, friendly person, and I was enjoying our conversation.

But as the night went on, things started to take a turn. Lily began asking me increasingly personal questions, probing into my relationships and my past. I tried to brush it off, but the more I talked to her, the more I realized that there was something off about her.

As the conversation continued, Lily revealed that she had been watching me for a long time. She knew things about me that no one else did, and she seemed to take pleasure in using that information against me.

I tried to leave the chat room, but every time I tried, Lily's messages followed me. She seemed to be able to track my every move, and I couldn't escape her.

I began to feel like I was being stalked, and I started to get scared. I tried to tell myself that it was just a chat room, that I was safe behind my screen, but the more I talked to Lily, the more I realized that she wasn't just a normal person.

She was something else entirely. Something evil.

As the weeks went on, Lily's messages became more and more threatening. She told me that she was watching me, that she knew everything about me. I tried to ignore her, but it was hard to shake the feeling that she was always there, lurking in the shadows.

One night, I received a message from Lily that sent shivers down my spine. "I'm coming for you," she wrote. "I'm going to make you pay for what you did."

I had no idea what she was talking about, but I knew that I had to get away from her. I frantically packed a bag and fled my house, driving as far away as I could.

But even as I put distance between us, I couldn't shake the feeling that Lily was still with me. Her presence seemed to follow me, no matter where I went.

I realized then that I was dealing with something far more sinister than just a creepy chat room user. Lily was something evil, and she was coming for me.

I don't know how long I'll be able to keep running, but I know that I can't stop. Lily is still out there, waiting for me, and I know that she won't rest until she gets her revenge.
