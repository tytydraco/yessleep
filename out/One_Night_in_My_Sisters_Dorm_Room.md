Eight years ago, I visited my older sister soon after she started her residency at an old hospital. To save money I stayed in her dorm room behind the main building. Her room sat on the second floor of a three story block midway along the row and right next to the stairs. Three shared bathrooms were in the corridor, one was beside my sister’s room. 

The room was tiny with only a single bed and a small closet, and a rectangular jalousie window. She kept only the essentials because work left her little time for anything else, as I believed. I counted three pairs of scrubs, two casual outfits, and two sets of pajamas in her closet. A tall mirror leaned against the wall and a stand fan in the corner. It was simple but she managed to keep it clean, which surprised me since she could be lazy at home. 

It was about 10 PM when I went into the room after dinner with her. She went straight for her night shift and handed me the key to her room. We agreed that she would wake me up the following morning after her shift, and we would have breakfast together before we travel together back home for Christmass. I fell asleep right away because I was exhausted from a full day of travel.

I woke up shivering from the cold and got out of bed to fetch a blanket from her closet. I wrapped it around myself and lay back down. A minute or two later I sat up again and looked for the remote control of the air conditioner when I realized the room had none. The light was still on because I had forgotten to turn it off, so I checked and confirmed the window was closed. At the time I thought it was odd but not to cause any alarm, so I shrugged it off and went back to sleep.

I woke once more to the sound of loud footsteps that sounded like stiletto heels. The noise came from the right and seemed to move toward my sister’s room. Each click and clack grew louder - too  loud that I covered my ears. I was annoyed but did not want to confront anyone because I assumed it was a member of the medical staff or someone returning to their room.

Then the footsteps stopped right outside my door. I sat up and walked toward it, thinking it might be my older sister. I reached for the doorknob when the heels resumed and moved to the left. I heard the wooden door of the bathroom next to my sister’s room open and the faucet turn on. The rush of water hitting an empty plastic pail echoed down the hallway and sent a chill through me. It really freaked me out by how weird that was. 

So, I wedged a chair against the door then dove back onto the bed and pulled a heavy blanket over myself. I grabbed my phone and saw it was 1:07 AM. I debated calling her because she was in the surgery department and had said she would be assisting the head of the department. Maybe I was just exhausted - I told myself or maybe it was a dream or my imagination. I closed my eyes and tried to force myself to sleep until morning.

I do not know how long I slept before waking again. I peered through the jalousie window and it was still dark. Back then, I was a big woman, unlike my hourglassed body and fit older sister, and the tiny shifty wooden was uncomfortable to me. The room had become warm so I wanted to take off my socks. I sat up and nearly soiled myself when a pale thin arm reached toward my right foot from below the bed. 

I screamed and leapt from the bed. My back slammed into the closet and then two long thin arms wrapped around me from behind. I saw the dark nails were sharp and pointed, few burrowed to my skin. I froze and shook with fear - I held my breath, thinking the one exhale would end my life. 

Then, I felt a cold breeze behind my left ear, as if someone was blowing it - and the soft icy feeling touched the back of my neck. She, or whatever it was, let out a guttural whisper, as if forcing a locked jaw to speak

*“Can you be my friend?”* 

I don’t know how I did it, but your body does wonders when death is literally hugging you. I twisted and wiggled hard and broke free. I ran for the door and somehow ripped the bolt open. I remember flying down the stairs in socks and keeping my balance as if by instinct. I burst out of the building, ran across the stony parking lot and did not stop until I reached the guard house by the gate where I waited for my sister.

When I told my sister she said nothing like that had ever happened to her. We went back together to collect my things. After hearing us via phone call, my father booked a hotel and drove four hours to find my sister a new place - more importantly, a safer one. 

Later I learned she had been sleeping at her boyfriend’s condominium the whole time. In fact, she barely came to the room if she ever needed something. The same boyfriend that my parents disliked, is the one she married last year. The dorm room had been a false assurance to them that she was focused on her residency and her career. I still do not know whether to be angry with her or the fact that she indirectly caused that traumatic experience - maybe it was her fault, or maybe not. 

All I know is that I hate that room, as well as  that someone or something that is living there.
