Jason and Jeff were driving to their friend James’s wedding. They knew each other from elementary school, where they quickly became fast friends. Lining up in alphabetical order on the way to the playground, they were bound to meet each other through proximity. Both Jason and Jeff were terrible at planning ahead; they bought wedding gifts the day before and now they were running a little bit late. They cruised down the nearly-empty highway with no cell service and sparse rest areas around 85 miles per hour.

“Odd place for a wedding. In the middle of nowhere and all.”

“Yeah…”

“You alright, Jeff?”

“Yeah, I’m just kind of tired from driving. Can we switch places?”

They pulled into a rest stop about 20 minutes later so Jason could drive. Jeff also had to piss. Jason got a shitty cup of hot black coffee from a vending machine to keep him awake. Everything seemed as it should be until they walked back to their car and saw a flock of geese flying overhead.

“What the-!“

They both watched in horror as their car was bombarded with an inordinate amount of goose shit. The entire roof of their car as well as a good portion of their windshield and hood were completely caked. Jeff, suddenly much more awake, started to panic.

“Fuck, dude! We can’t go to the wedding like this! What are we going to do?”

“We need to keep driving. If I see a car wash, we’ll stop. If not, we can park farther away. This is an unlucky coincidence, I’m sure people will understand. Just try to get some sleep.”

“How the fuck can I sleep after watching that?!”

Jason took the wheel. Jeff leaned back in the faux-leather carseat, trying his best to fall asleep. He was unable; his vision eventually rested outside the passenger window. After continuing for a full hour, Jason saw an exit with a single gas station with a car wash. 

“Hey, wake up. I see a car wash, and in the nick of time!”

"I'm still up. How far out are we?"

"It's just another hour. I think we've made up enough time to stop."

The car wash didn't necessarily look new, but they had seen dozens just like it near gas stations. After refuelling, they approached the entrance. At first, Jason was hesitant.

"Looks a little sketchy."

"The car's covered in goose shit, we have to do this."

It didn't take much convincing. After all, it was just another car wash attached to a gas station... right? They paid and pulled in slowly, stopping where they were supposed to. The machine started up.

The first warning sign was when of the rotating brushes hit the side of the car a little harder than it was supposed to. The car rocked to the side, but there was no visible damage.

"What the hell?"

"Something must be wrong with the senors-"

The rotating brush attached to a vertical arm crashed into the windshield, covering both with soap and broken glass; it continued to the roof, pressing so hard that it bent the metal. The car was being crushed like what one would see at a monster truck rally. Jason, whose seat was still upright screamed for help. Jeff managed to get his car door open.

"Hang on, I'll make them turn it off!"

That's when I saw him running in my direction. When I noticed soap on his body, I had a guess as to what had happened. I ran out the door to meet him, and we quickly disconnected the power.

The security camera footage of the whole event was rather disturbing. Being a worker at that gas station, I can attest that we always kept the car wash detached from all power sources and put up a large, obvious sign to tell people it was out of order. The car wash has been disconnected since around 2010, and we just haven't had the money to remove it. Oddly, in the surveillance footage, the sign was missing. 

I personally have never seen or heard anything like this. Although Jeff escaped and told me (and the police) his story, he was far from unscathed. Both of them were taken to the nearest hospital, but that was too far away. Jason was gone by the time they got there; his spinal cord was severed near the neck. Jeff is alive, but he sustained some serious burns from hydrofluoric acid contained in the old remaining cleaning solution. We have been unable to determine how the car wash became powered again.

Has anything weird happened at your jobs this week?
