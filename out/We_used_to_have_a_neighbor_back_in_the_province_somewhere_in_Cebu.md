They lived there for more than ten years, in the house beside ours, the one with the peeling green paint and the guava tree that leaned too close to our fence.



In the Philippines, there are many ways to call your grandparents. I called mine *nanay* (grandma) and *tatay* (grandpa). It stuck with me since childhood. I heard my uncles and aunties call them that, and I just mimicked it. Even now, I still do.



It was nanay who first told us about the people next door. She said they had a tarot deck, an old one, with edges so worn it looked like it had been handled by too many hands. In our place, tarot cards weren't seen as just fortune-telling toys. Nanay said they were for people who dabbled in itim na mahika (black magic). It depended, she said, on how deep or how powerful your connection was, sometimes their manifestations could come as easily as breathing. I didn't believe her, of course. I never saw anything firsthand. But nanay always warned us, "kung lalapastanganin mo ang baraha, babalik sa 'yo 'yung sinabi mo." (if you desecrate the cards, the words you spoke will return to you). If you treat the cards like they're just for show, if you fake someone's fate or lie about their future, it'll come back to you. Not as karma, she said, but as a curse.



According to her, the family next door made their living from reading futures, love life, careers, good fortune, all that. But everyone knew it was a scam. They didn't know how to use the cards properly. They memorized patterns, repeated phrases, and made people believe. Still, people came. Hope is easy to sell when you sound confident enough. 



I remember their youngest daughter. She was quiet, probably my age back then. Her name was Lira. We weren't close, but she always watched us play tumbang preso by the road. Sometimes I'd wave, and she'd smile but never come closer.



Then one night, something changed.



It was raining hard, and nanay had told us not to stay outside because there was lightning. Around midnight, I woke up because of a loud knocking, not on our door, but next door's. Someone was shouting. My tatay went out to check, and when he came back, he looked pale.



He said the neighbor's daughter was screaming.



The next morning, the whole neighborhood was talking. People said she'd been found sitting in the middle of their living room, holding the tarot deck in her hands. The cards were everywhere, scattered, torn, and some burned at the edges. She wouldn't talk, wouldn't move. Her parents said she had been reading for herself that night, trying to prove something. They called for help, but by the time someone came, the house already smelled like wax and copper. They said Lira finally spoke, only once, and whispered, "it wasn't my future I saw." After that, she disappeared. The family said they sent her to relatives in another town, but nanay didn't believe it.



A week later, strange things started happening.



At first, it was just small things, their windows would open on their own, candles melting even when no one lit them. Then came the noise. Every night, you could hear something like cards being shuffled. Slow, deliberate. Sometimes it sounded like it came from their house. Sometimes it sounded closer, right by our window. Tatay tried to bless the house. Nanay told us to sleep with scissors under our pillows. It worked for a while. Then one morning, the entire family next door packed up and left before sunrise. They didn't tell anyone where they were going.



But they left the tarot deck.



It was found in the drainage near our fence, soaked and dirt-streaked but still complete. All seventy-eight cards. Nanay told us not to touch it, that it didn't belong to anyone anymore. But my cousin, who didn't believe in all that, picked one up just to prove her wrong. That night, he fell from his motorcycle on the way home. He lived, but barely. The doctors said his body gave out before he hit the ground, like he'd already stopped breathing.



Nanay burned the rest of the deck after that. She said some things shouldn't be returned to the earth or buried. Fire was the only way. But here's the thing, weeks later, another neighbor said they saw something by the old house. A girl, sitting by the window, holding a single card. When they went to check the next morning, the window was still open. And lying on the sill was a card that shouldn't exist anymore. I told myself it was nothing. Maybe the wind. Maybe kids playing around. 



But the following week, I was scrolling on Facebook when I saw a post in a local horror group. It was a photo. The same deck. Same burn marks. Same edges.



The caption said:  
"Found this near the abandoned house in Cebu. Planning to use it for readings. Any tips?"



I froze after reading it. Out of curiosity, I clicked the profile, checked the user's information, and kept scrolling. The deeper I looked, the more familiar it felt, until I realized it was one of the relatives of our old neighbor. The same neighbor who once owned that tarot deck. And then I remembered what Nanay said. That it is a curse. No matter where you go, it follows.



Since then, I never got any update from the person who uploaded it.
