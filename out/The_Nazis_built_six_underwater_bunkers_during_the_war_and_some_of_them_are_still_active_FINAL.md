“Manny? MANNY?” Blaine shakes the dead man’s shoulder. Rudy crouches down beside him, they test his breathing. But there’s no response.

“FUCK!” Rudy shouts, jumping to his feet. “What the hell have you done, Szymon? What have you done?”

Szymon only shakes his head, stuttering. “No… that’s not possible. How could these things be connected?”

“You acted too SOON, IDIOT!” Blaine barks, shoving Szymon in the chest. “What the hell are we supposed to do now?”

&#x200B;

“Manny…” I mutter, looking down at the body of my friend. One minute he was more or less just fine, I guess… and now he’s dead. He’s done.

&#x200B;

A terrible groan rises from the black, sewage-like tank before us, and the hairs rise up across the back of my neck. I look up to it… and realise, that despite the decay that now seeps through the tank, the glittering green light is not entirely gone.

I can still see traces of it above us, reflected faintly against the edges of some of the pipes. I can see it tinging the edges of the great steel girders and beams that support the ceiling.

“I can still see more light”, I say quietly to the group. “What if there’s another tank?”

&#x200B;

“Another tank?” Rudy splutters. “Oliver, Manny is DEAD. Who gives a shit? We gotta get out of here!”

But I ignore him. Heart pounding I stride round the edge of the tank. I ignore the calls of the others as I head deeper and deeper into the gloom, towards a slither of that same green light, spilling through a crack in the far wall.

This hall, it seems, goes further than we had anticipated. The illusions formed by the flickering shadows distorted our perceptions of the distance.

&#x200B;

“Hey!” comes a voice from behind me, along with quick, heavy steps. “Hey!”

It’s Blaine, and he takes a breath as he catches up to me, striding alongside. “You alright?” he asks.

“Sure”, I reply grimly, head spinning.

“Where are you going?” he asks me, and I gesture to the slither of green light through the crack at the room’s opposite side.

“What the-” he notices it for the first time. “Oh, shit. What do you think it is?”

“I don’t *want* to think about it”, I reply as I stride onwards, the shadows rippling around me like the water of the accursed tank. I clench my fists. “I just need to see. I need to see for myself”.

I hear the pounding of footsteps behind us. Rudy calls for us. But still I march onwards, through the dark and secretive haze to the crack at the back of the hall.

Another door.

*Doors, doors, doors.*

I shove right through, and the echo of the creaking metal scratches painfully through the air. I step out onto a gridded steel walkway, suspended high above a long, wide floor way below. The floor extends into the far distance, and I cannot see the back wall.

My boots clank against the steel as I walk to the edge. The fall to the floor below is blocked by a sturdy guard rail.

&#x200B;

I take in the view, and with a long, low breath, the cold, stale air in my lungs is gradually released.

&#x200B;

To my left and embedded in the concrete of the wall, and very partially obscured by enormous steel beams supporting the roof, is a colossal stone monolith.

The thing is ancient, cracked and heavily water-damaged.

Across its body, however, are visible a collection of long-forgotten glyphs and symbols.

This thing is far older than this bunker. Far, far older, that much is obvious. Perhaps by hundreds, or thousands of years. I could not say for sure.

&#x200B;

*Was it transported here, perhaps..? Or… or was the bunker built AROUND it…?*

&#x200B;

Six enormous and disembodied eyes are carved into the top of the monolith. And in the middle, stacked almost like a totem pole, are a series of crude faces. Outlines, really, with eyes, and mouths. The only real additional features are lines carved at the outside-edges of their eyes.

Wrinkles. Or ‘Crow’s Feet’, if you will.

The face at the top has a multitude of wrinkles. Beneath this face, a long series of markings- like veins, or roots- have been carved, and they creep down to connect to the face below.

This middle face is more angular. The wrinkles beside the eyes are fewer.

And it too has root-like veins, and as with the others, they slither down to the face below.

The lowermost face is the roundest. It has no wrinkles beside its eyes.

And below this final face are more incomprehensible glyphs. A series of symbols that mean nothing to me. Unknown shapes and twisted signs.

&#x200B;

Blaine steps up to the railing and puts a hand upon it.

He gives the monolith only a perfunctory glance. “Jesus…” he says, as he looks out over the scene below.

We are joined by Rudy and Szymon.

&#x200B;

Below us, at regular intervals and extending away into the gloom, are more of the same tanks.

Great, green, glass boxes. Connected via pipes. All whirring and hissing. Full to the brim with drifting souls.

There must be hundreds.

Hundreds upon hundreds of these monstrous devices.

Perhaps, even…

“One thousand”, Blaine mutters. He points to a plaque embedded in a control panel to our right. It reads:

“*Die Eintausend*”.

&#x200B;

“Die Einstausend”, Rudy repeats, quietly. “So it didn’t refer to the people in the tank…”

He falters, and Szymon finishes his sentence. “…It referred to the *tanks*”.

&#x200B;

We consider this in silence, and a long, low whisper echoes from the tanks and down the hall towards us.

&#x200B;

Below the plaque of ‘Die Eintausend’ is a passage, written in German. I take a step towards it and scan my eyes across the words.

*‘Vom Vater zum Sohn. Blut für Blut’*, it begins. And I read it aloud, in English.

“From father to son… Blood for blood. I pledge my soul, and I will open the eyes of the souls of my lineage. We will guide the way. For the Fatherland, and our place in eternity”.

As I speak these words, it is almost as if I can hear them repeated back to me, spoken proudly from the hearts of rows of devotees. Stark in their dark uniforms against the cold, pale walls behind, standing tall in the shadow of the trio of statues, ringed by Leviathan himself.

The vision is fleeting, and passes as quickly as it came.

There is a heavy silence that follows, a silence filled by the flow of the groans and sighs of the tanks below.

&#x200B;

…Of *Die Eintausend*.

&#x200B;

Szymon walks past me. His boots clank against the metal as he heads towards the console to our right. I don’t fail to notice the presence of a large box, similar to the one that Manny disabled, connected to the controls.

“Szymon, STOP”, Blaine orders, but Szymon does not. He turns to us, and I see his face is streaked with tears. The atmosphere freezes around us, and to my horror, he raises his gun.

“Please, put your weapons down”, he says.

“What the… Szymon-” Blaine cuts in, adjusting his grip so as to better take hold of his gun, but Szymon rattles his own and suddenly shouts, his voice like a bell ringing through the darkness. “PUT YOUR WEAPONS DOWN”, he bellows. “NOW. SLOW. ANY MOTION THAT I DEEM DANGEROUS AND I WILL FIRE”.

Rudy takes a step forwards. “Szymon what the hell’s gotten into you? Just-”

Szymon swings around his gun, cocks it. “PUT THE GUNS DOWN. I WILL NOT ASK AGAIN”.

Rudy winces. He curses under his breath. But he does as he is asked. As the rest of us remain motionless, Rudy carefully unstraps his weapon, and slowly lowers it to the ground. Szymon’s eyes are fixed on his every movement.

Once he has done this, Szymon gestures to Blaine and then to myself, and the two of us do likewise, and place our weapons on the ground.

“I’m sorry”, Szymon mutters, before stepping towards us, and with a few sweeping motions with his feet, he kicks the guns off the side of the platform, where they fall to the shadowed concrete far below with a clatter.

“What the fuck has gotten into you Szymon?” Blaine asks. “You couldn’t have known that what you were going to do would *kill* Manny. You acted bloody recklessly, but it’s not your fault Manny’s dead. But we gotta just stop for a second to process this, alright mate? Work out what it all means. We’re clearly dealing with something way beyond our paygrade here. You’re not thinking straight”.

“I have to shut this thing down, now”, Szymon tells us. “I realise that this is something that I must do. Die Eintausend. I need to shut the whole thing down”.

Rudy tries to cut in again but Szymon speaks over him. “They are alive in those tanks”, the man says, adjusting his glasses with a shaking hand. “They’re alive. Manny was connected to them. Right? He could see their dreams. He was connected to the tank through the sins of his grandfather. His whole family line is cursed. And that’s not my fault. It’s not. It’s THERE’S”. Szymon throws out a hand and gestures to the bunker as a whole. He rubs a hand across his brow, and in the corner of my eye, I see a small, subtle motion from Rudy.

Without moving my head I look his way, and following his deliberate glances, I notice that the man still has a pistol, attached to the back of his belt, and out of Szymon’s direct line of sight.

Rudy gives me a pointed look, and I nod, almost imperceptibly.

*Just don’t do anything stupid*, I try to transmit to him, though whether he interprets this or not is difficult to say.

Szymon continues. “These tanks are the products of the Nazis. What cruel purpose do they serve, exactly? Nothing that will benefit humanity, I am sure of it. The people are trapped, I have no doubts, in perpetual suffering. So the cages in which they are held need to be shut down immediately. And this is something I’m going to do. I took a look in the box that Manny disconnected. I can work out how to finish this”.

“Szymon”, I chime in, raising my head. “The tank you destroyed was, as you said yourself, connected to Manny. There’s- there’s something horrible about the way these tanks work. This mantra, the- the connections-” A flood of various images flash through my head. The three statues. The Black Sun. The terrible painting in the central hall. I see the ruined city in the waves and the shining eye. I shoot a glance over the monolith embedded in the wall to our left, at the veins and roots that connect the faces.

I repeat the words on the plaque.

“From father to son… Blood for blood... I pledge my soul, and I will open the eyes of the souls of my lineage. We will guide the way. For the Fatherland, and our place in eternity”.

My throat has gone death-dry, but I continue.

“Szymon, what if what you did killed Manny’s son, as well? What about his brother? Does the man have any cousins? How far does this thing go?”

And even as I speak, a terrible, cold thought strikes deep into my core.

&#x200B;

I think of Nina, my wife.

&#x200B;

And I think of her heritage.

Manny worked alongside Nina’s great-grandfather.

Was he, too, involved in this project?

I turn to look out over the rail and down at the tanks below us.

Is a picture of Nina’s great-grandfather marked into one of these tanks? Alongside a handprint and a blood sample and God knows what else?

I feel the blood drain my face, and my line of reasoning falters. My words die in my mouth.

Szymon scoffs.

“What are a few lives when weighed against THIS, OLIVER?” he shouts. “THIS IS SICK. THIS IS THE WORK OF RATS!”

Blaine tries to speak again. “Just don’t be rash, Szymon. The previous recon teams chose not to report on this. They left the tanks unharmed. Shouldn’t we at least consider their reasoning? Take a little time to think as a group?”

“But don’t you get it, Blaine?” Szymon chokes. “That’s exactly the point”. He mutters quietly to himself in Polish for a moment, and wipes his eyes beneath his glasses. “If I dither and delay, then my mind might be changed. I might be swayed to a decision that goes entirely against my moral compass. If every single recon team before us left *The Thousand* standing… Then logic suggests we’ll do the same, right?

…Right?

Butt… But I can’t. I just can’t. It’s not right. So I have to shut it all down before something changes my mind. Once it’s done, it’s done”. Szymon starts rambling. He paces up and down, he spits over the rail, the energy in his voice renewed:

“ WHATEVER IT IS, WHATEVER IT’S FOR… IT’S DONE! IT ENDS HERE!”

And he spins on his heels and strides to the master-console. He fires a series of bullets into the box and tears the metal door from its hinges.

“SYMON, WAIT!” Blaine roars, as a ringing echoes in our ears- there is a sudden clamour, and then with a sharp, fiery burst, one final bullet is fired.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I swear and jump in shock as a hole appears in the back of Szymon’s head.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A cloud of blood erupts through his forehead and splatters across the console. He collapses at once, all motion control instantly lost as he slumps against the controls, collapsing ungracefully onto the ground, where he twitches, then lays still, as blood pools steadily across the metal, and drips and leaks down through the metal grates.

&#x200B;

My chest rises and falls, adrenaline coursing through me.

&#x200B;

I turn to Rudy, in utter disbelief that the man would resort to such drastic measures so quickly- but I am shocked to see that Rudy’s pistol remains firmly in his belt. His hand is poised beside it, as if preparing to draw… But the pistol nonetheless remains affixed. Rudy looks at me, then past me, and I turn around to follow his gaze.

And there in the doorway, is Kim.

&#x200B;

She stands cold and silent in the darkness, her features illuminated in that ghostly green, jaw clenched and eyes fierce. In her hands is her rifle.

She slowly lowers it back down, and she releases a long, calm breath, which clouds around her face in the cold.

&#x200B;

\*

&#x200B;

Solemnly, we retreat back to the main lobby. There is a sickness here, that much is plain. Our minds are not working as they are supposed to.

We spent an hour deliberating. It’s as long as we can bear, in the shadows of such evil.

And we eventually decide, as a group, to leave the *Eintausend* operational.

We do not know if this makes us heroes or villains, or neither, but we do not know the true extent to which these machines are connected to the people back home.

It is not a decision that fills me with pride. We have no idea to what purpose the tanks continued existence supports. Besides the hints of some vague and cryptic clues, we do not know why they were built. We do not know what happened to the Nazis who worked here, and we do not know where they went, nor how exactly we would find them, if we wanted to.

But what we *do* know, is that both Manny and Szymon died the same way as the fallen French soldier.

&#x200B;

…The report will read that they suffered tragic accidents. Crushed by falling debris.

&#x200B;

We can’t have Command sending sizeable task forces down here. Anything could happen, and as has been proven, the balance is a delicate one. If Command learn the truth, then the power is taken resolutely out of our hands. We’ll have no say in what happens next, and what happens next could be monstrous.

Our official reports will note that the bunker is dangerous when disturbed, that lives will be put at risk if attempts are made to formerly decommission and deconstruct it… but with that being said, the bunker, as per our exploration, is otherwise a non-threat, and is of *no particular interest*.

No need to send any more recon teams down any time soon, that’s for sure.

The bunkers are better off left alone.

&#x200B;

We trudge back to the dock of the submarine in silence.

&#x200B;

To me, it comes down to one simple fact.

I can’t risk losing Nina, so the machines will stay operational.

And The Thousand will continue to drift. Hidden away in the dark, at the bottom of the sea.
