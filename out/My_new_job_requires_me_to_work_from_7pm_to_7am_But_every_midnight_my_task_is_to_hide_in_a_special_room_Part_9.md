[Part 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1784iki/my_new_job_requires_me_to_work_from_7pm_to_7am/)

I went back to work. I went back to that place. My kids are still in the hospital, my wife is still in distress, and I am still gangrened by the mere fact of being linked to that company. No sanctions whatsoever against me, even after abandoning my position for one good week. You know, it is as if they know that the job in itself is already a worthy punishment. I will sure get the money once again, and yes it will be useful, but the things I witnessed this week...

Before I continue with this post, I would like to thank all those who took the time to suggest ideas and tips for me to escape this mess, no matter the tone used. I also thank all those who could not provide any advice, but at least wished my family and I well. Thank you very much all of you.

On Monday, once again, but not in the same mood as the previous times, I had to wear the uniform. The gloves are still missing, but of course, this is not the most important at the moment. I do not even know what is that uniform, especially with what it displayed last time. Is it alive? Is it also an entity all by itself just like the figures on the walls of the black room? I wore the black clothes, feeling like I was wearing death, and trembling to the core. Despite me having the uniform on, my wife refused to stay alone at home and preferred to be at the hospital, where she also knows that loadshedding is not allowed.

Upon arrival at the facility, I noticed that the motorcycle guy or my new colleague, who we will call Dylan for the sake of the story, is the only person who openly shows anger concerning my return to work. Fed up with his nonsense, I confronted him about the reasons of his hatred, but everything that came out of his mouth was garbage I cannot include in this post just to avoid it being removed by you know who. Before leaving, he promised me to engineer my dismissal all by himself. I refrained to tell him that he was my guest.

For the most part of the evening, I found myself visiting the black room, building up the courage to use my flashlight in UV mode to see what could go wrong but I failed to do so before 10 pm. I then tried the UV mode outside of the black room after switching the lights off, and I was baffled by a spectacle that shocked me but at the same time did not surprise me. The patterns were there, and I could not tell if they emerged from the black room or if they instead converged towards it. Even the transparent patterns on my uniform were then shining in red when I directed the light towards me. 

Those patterns were everywhere in the company, in the kitchen, in the restrooms, at the entrance, everywhere. However, there was not even one drawn figure like those in the black room, but there were more of those small black invisible doors. Behind one of them, I could hear voices, like several people calmly discussing something important, almost like a professional meeting but I could not find the courage to open that door.

Instead, I went back to the black room, and found the courage to use the UV mode there at 11:34 pm. I could see the patterns and the small black door, but the figures were not there and the monitors did not turn to tribal masks. I left the UV mode on and waited for midnight. As soon as it was 12:00 am, someone behind the invisible small door spoke. I just blinked, and the monitors changed to the tribal masks, and the figures made their appearances on the walls, floor and ceiling. I froze, expecting them to move like last time but they did not. The voice behind the small door next to the cupboard continued, repeating the same words over and over like a recording. I could only understand the first word when I approached which was 'identify'.

Was it a machine? I almost vomited my heart when the entity started banging on the black room main entrance. I deactivated the UV mode and the entity started laughing hysterically while still banging on the main entrance, promising my family and I death that nobody has experienced before. It remained there, and I also stayed still, listening to everything until it all stopped at 01:00 am.

The next day, I went to the library hoping to find anything that could help. I do not have any picture, any video or any other evidence, except for my uniform, my contract and the name of the entity. I did not know how I could explain the situation without being labeled as a crazy person so I tried asking the librarian I spoke to about any resources concerning the entity. The moment I mentioned its name, she looked at me as if I insulted her and asked me to get out. I tried to appease the situation but she screamed for the security and just like that, I was outside.

Later, fortunately, I did not see my day shift counterpart when I arrived at the facility. Soon, I found myself completely alone in the building once again and managed to ask myself some very interesting questions: who guards the place at night when I do not work on Wednesday and the Weekend? Who did in the previous week during which I did not work?

Unfortunately, when I tried to get answers to those questions through the corresponding camera recordings, I noticed that the relevant footages were missing. As a result, I went through the normal routine until I found myself facing one of the worst situations so far.

At 11:41 pm, I heard four loud bangs coming from the storage area while I was busy making coffee in the kitchen. Confident that this was not yet the time for the spooky show, I made sure to do my job correctly, finding the courage to investigate the noises. Going to the storage area with only the radio, I could not see anyone or anything suspicious. I then heard two loud bangs coming from the entrance, and I also went to verify but did not see anything until a figure emerged from behind the circular reception counter.

His identity concealed by his horrifying clown mask, the intruder soon presented his machete before he jumped over the desk to give pursuit. Chased by the intruder, I stormed towards the black room and won the race, locking the black room door before he could catch up. He banged on the door for just a few seconds before he sped off, going back to the storage area.

When I wanted to use the radio to notify the authorities, I immediately noticed the static sound. It was midnight. For the first time, the entity had started its reign of terror right in front of the black room door instead of the reception area, then it set itself in motion. The intruder was busy using his weapon to break open some of the storage units doors, oblivious to the threat coming its way.

Many people cannot help themselves, seizing any opportunity to criticize me for breaking the rules. However, I will never regret doing something wrong like breaking a 'rule' if it is for something right like saving a fellow human being's life. Breaking the no-communication rule, I used the black room microphone to tell him to run away for his life. He did not take me seriously at first until he heard something from the entity that made him flee.

From the monitors and the distortions, I could see the entity do things I never saw it do before, like disappearing and reappearing at seemingly random places. It left in its trails new images on the monitors as I could no longer recognize some parts of the building. The screen showing the entrance for example was then showing a wall. I then heard the entity using my voice and the speakers of the building to direct the intruder back to the black room. I tried to counter its trick to no avail and noticed the entity standing still behind the black room door, while the intruder was running towards a certain death.

The man turned and saw the entity on the spot. He made small steps backwards, dropping his machete before removing his mask. I saw his face dressed in terror but I did not recognize him. He then lifted his hand as if he was pointing at the entity and screamed like I never heard a man scream before. He ended up on the floor, convulsing, while the entity did not move by an inch, the monitor showing the black room door still affected by the distortion. The intruder stopped moving at some point, and the entity remained at the door, still and silent, until it quietly spoke at 12:59 am:

"You—are—next."

At 01:01 am, I exited the black room and approached the intruder. He was dead, with tears in his eyes and foam in his mouth, after overdosing on a pure and sheer concentration of a basic human emotion: fear. I was right about avoiding to take a look at that thing, and after what happened at the library, I think I was right about avoiding mentioning its name in this post or anywhere else.

Out of nowhere, my supervisor showed up minutes later, not surprised about the dead man lying on the floor and even asked me to help him with loading the body in his car. I refused to help him and he just responded by shaking his head and chuckling, before he dragged the body away to my absolute disbelief. He then came back and warned me not to do anything stupid until we have another meeting soon and left, commanding me to continue working.

Madness. Complete madness. He phoned me later, congratulating me for my 'hard work' and telling me that the company was so happy that the higher-ups had another surprise gift for me, only available when I come back to work on Thursday.

However, I think I received a surprise gift already, in the form of a direct message. There are many messages with people asking me to give them permission to narrate this series of posts on their channels. Good people, I am not ignoring you, but understand that at this moment, my family and I are going through serious and life-threatening stuff. Please let this series and all this madness be over first, then we will discuss about permission. For now, our lives are in serious danger.

The surprise gift I am talking about is the only direct message about a man named Connor who wants to meet and help me and my family. He says he has been through a similar situation and has warned me not to approach any police car during midnight, especially if the officer inside is alone. It could be the enforcer.
