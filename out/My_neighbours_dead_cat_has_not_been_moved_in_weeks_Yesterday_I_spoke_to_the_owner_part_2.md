Some of you mentioned in my deleted post that it seemed as if Luna had been there longer than just a week, and after some consideration I believe this to be true also since the degree to which Luna’s body has deteriorated is far beyond what I would expect after only one week. For those of you who haven’t seen or read my post before this I will include the link to it at the bottom, but the title of this post should at least summarise the situation in brief.

 

As I stated previously, two other cats are now dead. One is a small ginger cat by the name of Oscar who I recognise to have belonged to the Smith family not a few houses down, and the other is a black cat who I believe to be new to the neighbourhood or at the very least a stray. Both are in similar state to Luna. Flattened limbs, visibly splayed ribs protruding out of their torsos but the head, in comparison to the rest, is largely untouched. Neither of their bodies have been moved since I say them and still no one has referred or interacted with them in any way. I was sick of waiting for someone to deliver me from this bizarre scenario, but they never came. Yesterday I took it upon myself to investigate the situation. If I knew what I know now I believe I wouldn’t have dared to have done what I did the day before.

 

Yesterday when my parents had left for work, I visited Ida. She was the first to have had fallen victim to the recent incidents and I believed that speaking with her would shed some light on what and why this was happening and most of all deliver her the news that Luna is in fact dead. I can’t bear to watch her anymore placing a bowl of milk out for Luna and her desperate attempts to coach her inside from her porch, someone should have done this far before I even arrived but now is not the time to point fingers.

  Making sure to watch my step as I navigated past Luna as I made my way up Ida’s drive, I couldn’t help but notice the state her house was in. I rarely ever spoke to Ida when I was growing up and my time away at university has made me forget entirely why I never did in the first place. The green paint on the outside of her house had clear signs of pealing that spanned the entirety of the building in symmetrical lines only to be disrupted by deep ridged cracks in the wall itself. Not deep enough so you could see the interior but deep enough to create jet black shadows that when combined with the peeling paint, made the viewer initially believe the house to be overgrown. The windows had a thick coating of dust visible from the outside which had a dispersed arrangement around odd spots from which someone could have been standing. The smell was unbearable as I had to cover my nose with the neck of my jacket. Soured milk and the progressive rot from Luna had now ventured itself into a territory of stench that I never thought possible. The wind chimes above Ida’s porch were broken save for a single chime dangling from its base playing a tune which can no longer be heard. Ida’s door was already open by the time I reached it. Only slightly ajar with no host behind it, its clear that Ida’s condition is worsening. The living room was visible from the crack within the door revealing the back of Ida’s head in an armchair.

I was overcome by an overbearing sense of dread as I doubted my reasoning for coming in the first place. Surely Ida had known her cat was dead. Surely, she was just a poor old lady with a painful yet odd coping mechanism. I had turned around on the porch to leave when I noticed that every house’s window in the cul-de-sac was occupied by my neighbours. All staring and all intrigued by what was to follow. I had heard movement coming from within the house, fear taking hold I spun round and knocked on the door too afraid to be caught by Ida and conjure up a convincing lie as to why I was on her drive. Her frail fingers wrapping around the corner of the door she opened it completely. Stood in a nightgown Ida peered at me quizzingly. Her nightgown was clearly meant to be white but either by dirt or age it had now taken to a shade of tinted yellow like her carpeted floor showing signs of mould.

“H- Hi Ida. I’m James”

She didn’t say anything.

“I live opposite. I used to deliver you the paper some years back. I was wondering if I could come in and chat with you?”

Ida stepped aside her palm laid flat as she welcomed me inside.

“Come on in James, let me be of service”

The inside of her house was as in as much disarray as the outside. The wooden staircase was wet and splintered, black mould overtaking the corners of the steps that wouldn’t see much activity. The yellow tinted carpet when looked at more closely had a hidden a layer of cream with a colourful flower pattern. The living room that I mentioned had two armchairs. One had claw marks near the base where Luna may had been and was positioned in front of an old looking radio place on top of a small table. Along the hallway and in the living room, small picture frames could be seen of a man and some children.

“Make yourself comfortable James”

Ida motioned to the living room.

“Thank you”

I had said, taking a seat in the armchair as it groaned in retort.

“Would you like anything James?”

“No no, I’m okay thank you. I don’t plan on staying long.”

Ida sat in the armchair opposite never averting her eyes from mine. She sat upright, her hands perpendicular to the arms of the chair and her legs were uncrossed and remained upright in front of her. Being able to see her more closely her eyes had become calloused. She looked older than what I thought. Countless wrinkles and thin wispy hair. It wasn’t any wonder she didn’t recognise me at first.

“What did you come to see me about James?”

Snapping me out of my train of thought. Clearly, I hadn’t been making a very good job at hiding me new found realisation.

“I’ve just come to see how you’re doing. It’s been a strange couple of weeks, hasn’t it?”

Ida appeared confused.

“I suppose”

This wasn’t going as well as I thought it would. I thought old people were meant to spring into life with any excuse to spill their guts on anything and everything from their youth to things they had seen on the news, but Ida just sat there expectantly waiting for what I would declare. I tried to save the conversation as I looked around the room for a topic. My eyes landed on the pictures. I never knew she had a husband let alone kids but then again what kid would take interest in anything other than cartoons and video games growing up. If you were anything but themselves, kids wouldn’t take interest.

“Do you have a husband, Ida?” I said motioning towards the pictures.

She looked at them long and hard standing up as she did so to get a better look. Her eyes scrunched and her top lip crumpling in frustration.

“Your family Ida, how are they?”

“Oh my family, yes yes. I have a lot of family but they’re not here”

“Where are they?”

She thought for a minute before looking back at the picture and walking out of the room and out of sight.

“Hello!”

Ida called

“Hello!? … Hello!! … Hello!?”

I followed Ida as she continued calling and entered the kitchen.

“Ida are you okay?”

“My family…I can’t find my family.”

She broke down into a deep sob.

“Ida it’s okay, I’m sure they’ll be back”

“No, no, no! I can’t find them, I can’t find them!”

Ida began to pace towards the staircase and upstairs, each floorboard creaking beneath her weight. I took in my surroundings before following her. The kitchen was covered with bowls and empty milk bottles, still Rolling across the tiled floor as Ida had knocked them while leaving. The walls were covered in grime and cobwebs occupied each corner of the ceiling. The fridge door was wide open the inside completely empty save for a few packets of cat food and chocolate with a wrapper that was outside my recognition of branding. Hearing a crash from above I sprinted upstairs.

“Ida! Ida! are you okay!?”

“You!”

“Ida.. I-“

“What are you doing here?”

“I came to-“

“Where’s my family!?”

“I-, I don’t know”

“Yes you do! You know, you know!”

“Ida your scaring me”

“Get out”

“What?”

“Get out!”

She came storming towards me, forcing me downstairs leaving me no room to turn around. She kept pushing me as I was left paralysed in confusion stumbling backwards down the stairs. I tripped grabbing the banister as the section I had clutched snapped from its frame fury bubbling inside Ida’s eyes. Taking hold of the separation made between the two of us I spun round twisting my ankle as I landed but at least I was facing the door. Running downstairs I burst through the door slamming it behind me standing there in shock. She never followed me out but if the sound coming from within was not crying then no one had ever truly cried before. I walked down the drive the smell outside the last thing on my mind. I let my instinct take hold as I walked down the street and past my house. There was no way of telling her about Luna. The state I thought her mind was in, is far worse than what I could imagine. If I had told her there is no doubt she would of accused me only to forget the incident a few hours later. Surely, she will forget what has happened and if she sees me entering my house after I had walked round the street a few times then the more the better if it helps to sweeten my innocence in her eyes.

 

Exhausted from the whole encounter I was asleep by the time my parents would have come in that evening and would not have even stirred to the noise they would make, but the sound of scampering and distant meowing heard from my window would keep me awake the entire night too afraid to draw my curtains. The following morning, which would be this morning, my father approached me.

“You spoke with Ida”

“Yes dad, she… she needs professional help”

My father stood there looking at me for a while, arms crossed.

“You never speak to her. Never.”

Before I could reply he had walked out and closed my bedroom door. I’m no wiser as to what is happening here, but I plan to investigate it further over the next couple of days. I will update here if I find anything.
