It’s a strange feeling to not be sad when someone dies. That’s how I felt when my dad told me that I was going to have to miss work to drive three states for my great aunt’s funeral. I kept waiting for something to hit me, to suddenly break down and cry like everyone else, but that never happened. Every action I took at the ceremony, every word I said and movement I made, it all felt so fake. If you’ve ever played a first-person video game, that’s how it felt. Just… going through the motions. This all sounds pretty heartless, I know, but you have to understand; I’d never even met this woman before she died. I didn’t even know that my grandma had a sister. It’s hard to muster up feelings for someone you never knew. Doesn’t mean I didn’t try. 

The wake is when things really began to feel unreal. I don’t really know how to describe it, but everyone there just felt… off somehow. Eyes burning into my back, whispers hushed the moment I’d enter a room. I felt like I was at the center of it all. The strangeness got to a breaking point right before I left. Me, my father, and his cousin, Samantha, had all been talking about my aunt. Apparently, she had been in the hospital for weeks prior to her death, suffering from acute heart failure. She had become a very standoffish and belligerent woman in her later years, so one visited her in that time. She was all alone when she died.

“I just wish I had been there… that I… could have said goodbye one last time,” Samantha sobbed.

“It’s alright. She knew how much you loved her,” my father consoled. 

Samantha looked up at me, face wet with tears.

“You being here… it really helps. You don’t look like her, but… somehow, It’s like being able to see her one last time…”

She went to hug me, grabbing me tight to make sure I couldn’t slip out of her grasp.

“I’m so sorry mom… I love you so much… you know that, don’t you?” 

I could feel her tears run down my back as see cried. All her pain, her guilt, she was unloading it on to me. I left shortly after that.


Everything started happening about a week after I got home. It started as little things. Sleep walking. Waking up in a different room than I’d gone to bed in. I’ve experienced sleep walking in the past, so I didn’t think much of it. I wish I did. About a month ago, I woke up from one of my sleep walking spells standing up. I was facing a full-length mirror in my bedroom, stiff as a board. My shoulders ached as I walked back to bed, stiff and cramping. They continued to ache the next night, and the night after that and the night after and so on. I would wake in that same spot, right in front of the mirror. 

After a week of this, I decided that I was fed up and got myself some melatonin. Maybe I just wasn’t sleeping deep enough, I certainly felt like it. My whole neck felt like rock, tendons popping with each movement. I remember getting into bed that night, convinced of good sleep to come. How wrong I was.

Like clockwork, I work up that night in the usual spot. Annoyed and tired, I began to turn my head to my bed, ready to crawl back in.

CHRCK

Pain pierced through my shoulders. It was so blinding that I didn’t even notice the warm blood drip on my chest. My eyes went wide, desperate to stop my vision from blurring. It was a miracle I didn’t faint. I really wish I had. I looked down without moving my head, eyes adjusting to the darkness. Whatever was holding me down was just out of sight, only appearing as greyish blobs in my peripherals. As slowly and as motionlessly as I could, my eyes slowly glided back to the reflection of the mirror.

Hands. Two giant, grey, emaciated hands stared back at me. Each long, boney finger dug into my shoulders, their bulbous knuckles clicking together as they shook. Their thumbs pierced either side of my neck, ensuring my paralysis. The nails on each digit were yellowed and cracked, like wood that had long since rotted. I wanted to scream, god how I tried, but with every small sound that escaped my lips, the thumbs drilled closer to my throat. A deep gurgle spurted just behind my right ear.

“Tan et…”
“Et atsma…”
“Atsmach lei…”

It coughed and stuttered, like a blade twisted in its throat with every word. A great dark mass formed at the edge of the mirror, right at the source of the garbled voice. Two eyes, deep red with bloodshot vessels rooted at a blackened abyss of a pupil stared through the reflection. Through me.

“Please… please d-don't kill me…”

I didn’t even realize I had said it out loud before the deep, rasping chuckle began being spat at me.

“Wh-who are you?!...”
…

The crackled laugh ceased, leaving only silence. The hands lightened their grip ever so slightly. And then, before I could process the loosened grip, my head snapped back, the fingers impaling my throat. I last thing I felt was my lungs filling with blood.

CRRSH

I gasped as my head colliding with the mirror ripped me back to reality. I grasped at my neck to find nothing but perfectly intact skin. If anything was damaged, it was my pointer finger, red with a raw nail, presumably damaged from my head first collision with the mirror. I faltered to get back to my feet, attempting to catch my breath.

Was that all really just a dream?

As I collected myself, the smallest glimpse of something caught my attention. Illuminated by the moonlight peering through my window, a word had been scratched into the mirror below the crack:
