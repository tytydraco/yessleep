My university has tunnels connecting all of the buildings on campus. I’ve been told by my friends from other places this is pretty unique, but I think a lot of schools around here have them. Maybe they just want to make sure students don’t have an excuse to miss class when windchill reaches -50, maybe they don’t want us all to starve if a blizzard lasts a little too long. In any case, these tunnels criss cross under the outdoor sidewalks and green spaces of our college, guiding students, staff and factually alike wherever they need go. Most of us who live in the dorms use them daily in  the winter months even if we might eventually pop outside occasionally for some fresh air. I don’t think anyone wants to brave the elements for their 8am class when they don’t have to, though. 

The tunnels are not uniform in their construction and some are absolutely sketchier than others. Some are made up of aging plaster walls, poorly lit with burnt out construction style lamps, inexplicably always damp. Most of the shittiest ones go between dorms and parking garages or cafeterias. Places they knew they could cheapen out as much as possible. 

Some of the dorms aren’t much better above ground either. The place I want to tell you about and its tunnel is one of them. Let’s call it Grey hall so I can maintain some attempt at anonymity. This shitty dorm must have been hastily and cheaply constructed in the 80s. It  always leaked, and had walls so thin you could hear your neighbor as if they were speaking directly to you. Honestly I get the sense that this building  has been  begging to be torn down practically since it was new and the last 40 some odd years has not done anything to help that. Blizzards, minor floods, a few rough hailstorms - Grey Hall has seen the worst this state had to offer. It’s probably a miracle they squeezed the years out of it that they did. 

It took first a student breaking this wrist  in the stairwell when they lost their footing on a cracked step and then another one managing to push out a window and fall from the 4th floor before the university finally stopped using the building altogether. As far as I know the kid that fell is still in the hospital. There was just too much maintenance needed all at once and the university couldn’t risk anymore lawsuits or bad publicity, so they closed it completely after the fall semester. I think they were also tired of addressing all the complaints about it. Everyone hated living there and would escape given any chance they had. By that point there were probably only a dozen students living in the entire massive thing, and heating it during January probably wasn’t worth it either. 

They closed the only tunnel to Grey Hall before they finished moving all the students out, and said it was the most structurally unsound part.

I’m sure that’s true but there is more to it. More that I wish I didn’t know, more that I wish I could just forget. If I weren’t a senior here I would have dropped out already and driven as far away as possible. I can’t tell the world, I gotta graduate, but I can at least tell you. 

I live in the next dorm over, so everyday I kept walking past the large barricade they’d placed at the entrance to the unusually long tunnel to the condemned hall.  It always looked like overkill to me. Why was there a tarp hung floor to ceiling like it was some kind of construction zone? I was certain they were trying to scare us away.  I guess it was pretty successful. Well, for most students. 

Not me though. I’ll admit maybe there is something wrong with my instincts, but the only thing I felt each day was a growing sense of curiosity that was harder and harder to ignore. 

On a Saturday night a few weeks ago, I made my first mistake in a series of a poor choices- I tried hard liquor for the first time. Half a red solo cup full of vodka later, and my inhibitions were eroding by the second. 

I was at a small party with my friends just off campus, and everyone was at least a little bit tipsy. One of my friends had the bright idea to play truth or dare. A lot of the game was spent licking nasty shit, making people embarrass themselves, and of course there were a few raunchy moments between players too. One of my friends, Mike, who happened to live in the same dorm as me,  claimed my dare later in the game. 

“Dude, you’ve been wondering what the deal is with that abandoned Grey Tunnel, haven’t you? I caught you staring at it last week, and I thought for sure you were casing the joint. You were looking for weak spots to break in!” 

I shrugged and tried to take a casual sip of vodka, somewhat unsuccessfully. “I mean yeah? Of course I do! It’s so menacing, for like no reason. There has gotta be more than just a crumbling hallway right?” 

“Well I dare you to prove it!” Mike said, slapping his hand on the ground with drunken enthusiasm. 

I rolled my eyes. “I’m not gonna die cause some loose brick falls on my head, even drunk I’m not that stupid.” 

That made a few of the others laugh, but my friend wouldn’t be deterred. “Ok, we’ll put on like gloves and our biking helmets.” 

“We’ll?” I pushed. 

“Well yeah now I wanna know too! And I’ll make Jim come along!” 

My friend’s groggy roommate looked over at the sound of his name. “Wait what?” He asked blearily. 
 
Mike playfully smacked at Jim. “Come on idiot, we’re going on an adventure for Rachel’s dare.” 

Jim groaned loudly. “But I’m so comfy!” 

Mike started tugging him to his feet. “Well that’s just too fucking bad, get up.” 

It took a bit to find all that we would need to pry our way through the barricade given that we were still inebriated, however a few folks at the party decided to help us out. One even lent Jim a spare helmet when he realized he’d left his at his parent’s house. 

We left the party to cheers of encouragement, but as we stepped into the cool evening air quiet surrounded us for the first time. It left  us each in our own silent contemplation as we crossed the street onto campus. 

“What if security catches us?” Jim asked softly. 

I could only shrug. “I guess we gotta make sure that doesn’t happen.” 

“I can keep watch!” Mike volunteered. 

I couldn’t help but laugh, “I dunno Mike, I think you might need to sober up a bit more first. “ 

Mike crossed his arms over his chest but couldn’t refute that. 

When we got to the blockade we debated how to get through without making our intrusion immediately obvious. It took a bit of awkward scrambling and teamwork but we got through without tearing down the tarp that covered most of the entrance.

Mike was the first one on the other side. He blindly fished his phone out of his pocket and put on the flashlight.  When Jim and I joined him we each did the same  in turn. Scanning the walls and ceiling it was clear that the tunnel really was pretty badly in need of repair. There were cracks and missing plaster everywhere, dramatic holes in the ceiling and several lights were broken. This tunnel had always been a little spooky but illuminated only by our phones it was downright unsettling. 

This tunnel tilted slightly downwards because Grey Hall’s basement was lower than the ones in the buildings around it, and that night it looked like it could be a tunnel straight to hell. It seemed my fear had finally caught up to me. I closed my eyes and took  a few deep breaths. It was then that I noticed a horrifying smell. I grimace and turned my head away for a moment. Mike had already started walking so he was now a few steps ahead of me. 

All three of us were now completely silent as we crept carefully forward. In my head I told myself it was because we didn’t want to alert anyone we were down here, but I knew they were just as scared as I was. 

We were quickly nearing the end of the tunnel where it joined up with grey but there was a slight turn before that happened. Mike reached it first.

He stopped dead in his tracks, gasped and frantically scanned the ground with his phone’s light before   falling back backwards, shrieking. That wasn’t a sound I’d heard him make before. I rushed forward to see what he was looking at. 

There,  below a broken concrete ledge, in a shallow divot in the ground, was a the torso of a  rotting human body.  My brain could only process the scene in pieces. In the the beam of my phone’s flashlight lay at least 3 bodies, all dismembered, some horrifyingly contorted. Their skulls tipped in silent screams and blood stained every last scrap of clothing that was visible. One was an older woman, one was an older man, but the third was a guy who was young enough to be in  one my own classes. I stumbled backwards like Mike had, but tripped slightly and dropping my phone. It fell screen side down, causing the light point upwards and illuminate the entire shallow grave before  us. Beside those first few bodies, which were probably at most a few months old, lay fully skeletonized remains. Their clothes looked older, like way way too old fashioned and weathered to be from any time in the last few decades. 

“What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck,” I muttered frantically shaking my head as if trying to clear my addled drunk thoughts like an etch a sketch. I heard Jim retching a few steps away over my shoulder. Mike  was now shakily trying to scramble to his feet. “We gotta get the hell outta here man, we have to go, we can’t be here, holy shit, he stammered incoherently,” still staring at the corpses before us. He finally turned and as he reached me he shook my  shoulder. “NOW, we have to go  NOW,” he was shouting. I was  also struggling to avert my eyes from the crime before us, but I did manage to lean down and clumsily retrieve up my phone. 

As Mike began to sprint away, I forced myself to turn and follow him. I could hear Jim only a step or two behind me. Our exit over the barricade was not as graceful as our entrance and it was now pretty obvious someone had gone through it. We barely had the sense to care. 

We paused for a minute in the better lit intersection of the tunnels. “I can’t… I can’t go back to my room.. my roommate, I just… I don’t know what I’d say…Where…where the hell do I go?!?” I met first Mike and then Jim’s eyes for the first time since our discovery. They looked at each other and seemed to silently and instantly come to an agreement.

“Rachel, come to our dorm. I know someone with a cot we can borrow if you want… just… please, stay with us, at least tonight?” Mike asked. The weight of his words were heavy with fear and concern. I swallowed and began to nod my head, looking at Jim again who attempted to offer an extremely half hearted smile. 

“Let’s go,” was all I could say in response. 

We started to head down the tunnel that lead to our dorm building but as I passed by a staircase I stopped dead in my tracks. “Actually, you guys can we walk outside? I know it’s cold but uh…” I didn’t need to finish that thought, as my friends seem to be relieved I’d thought to offer an alternative to staying down here any longer. 

The night outside barely seemed dark to us now as we trotted anxiously towards our home for the school year. The sounds of the late winter night were faint but still reassuring. 

Luckily Jim and Mike lived on the first floor so didn’t take us long to get in and collapse. I perched on one of their desk chairs, bring my knees up against my chest as I hugged my legs. There was a long heavy silence as both boys sat on the floor near by. 

Jim spoke first. “We have to tell someone.” I nodded mechanically in response. 

“Ok but like who? Anyone coulda done that, security, a professor, another student… I don’t think we can trust anyone.” Mike sounded frustrated and it was clear paranoia was starting to set in for him. 

That question and observation inspired another extended pause full of dread. 

“Those people weren’t all killed at the same time,” Jim was quieter as he spoke. 

“Do you think it was a whole group of people that did it? Like a secret blood cult frat or something? Like as a ritual once every few years or something?” Mike asked. 

I couldn’t help but snort a brief barking laugh. Mike’s head snapped in my direction as his glare shot daggers at me. 

I put my hands up defensively. “Sorry dude, I don’t mean to like shit on that theory, it’s just… this whole thing is so cosmically fucked up and unbelievable. It feels completely unreal. Like sure why not a blood cult fraternity? Anything is possible now I guess!” 

Mike sighed. “I shouldn’t have dared you to do that. We could still be shitfaced at that party, just doing stupid shit like licking a toilet seat instead.” 

“I still probably would have thrown up,” Jim offered. That made Mike and I laugh for real in a way that genuinely eased the tension a bit for the first time. 

“Maybe we should figure it out in the morning? We could try to sleep…. or at least  rest…” I proposed half heartedly, knowing deep down that anytime I actually closed my eyes I would probably only see those pale bloated faces from here on out. 

Mike looked unsure but Jim agreed with me. We decided to turn most of the lights off but kept on a single desk lamp. I was sure the boys would tease me for asking to have a little more light, but they seemed just as reassured by the idea. It wasn’t possible to get the cot that night so they tossed me a few extra blankets and I made do. I balled up my sweatshirt as a make shift pillow, and just stared up at the ceiling. Luckily it was already almost 4am by that point, so daylight was only a few hours away. 

I must have managed to doze off at somepoint because I woke up to Mike swearing again. As memories of last night began to return to me I felt myself paralyzed by dread. 

“Rachel I saw you open your eyes, come on you gotta check your email!” 

I groaned loudly, and with a lot of effort, I managed to force my arms to move. 

“Mike can we like, I dunno, grab some coffee or something first,” I asked, desperately hoping to delay the inevitable. 

Mike shook his head as he clambered down from his bunk. He shoved his phone in my face, and I blinked a few times before grabbing it. On the screen was an email that appeared to be addressed to all students. It was from our school’s President and the subject line read: URGENT SAFETY ALERT. The email went on to describe a  break in at Grey  Hall. Anyone with any leads could report them to campus security in exchange for more dining dollars. Any staff or faculty perpetrators would be fired, any current student perpetrators would be expelled, and any former student perpetrators could have their degrees revoked. The school was already working with local authorities and if the school’s punishments weren’t already enough, anyone caught could face jail time. 

The message was clear as day to me: we know that you know, and you better keep silent. I threw the phone back to Mike and curled up again. 

“Does mean they already know about the bodies?” Mike asked, still in disbelief. 

I just shrugged, “I dunno Mike, maybe they knew about them all along.”

He furrowed his brow, “what do mean Rachel?” 

“I mean you know the rumors as well as I do, they only closed Grey hall to avoid more bad press. I don’t know that they actually care that Daisy or Ishwaq got hurt. 

“So what do we do now then?” 

I shrugged again, “Pray we can still graduate?” 

“What if they kill someone else?! Someone we know? What if they kill one of us?” 

I looked him in the eyes and replied in a cold deadpan voice, “Well, then I guess I hope whoever finds me under the concrete is less of a coward than I am.”
