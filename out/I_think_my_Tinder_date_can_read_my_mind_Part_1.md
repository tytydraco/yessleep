 **-Mention of Child Abuse**

**-Mention of Substance Abuse**



I don’t know exactly how to start this, but I know that if this entire thing is going to make sense, I have to start from when things in my life began to feel ‘off.’ Eve entered into my life far earlier than I thought. I know that now. 



When I woke up a few weeks ago, I was late for work. My phone was already vibrating nearly off of my bathroom counter, call after call of concerned coworkers and even my manager. After throwing myself together, I picked up the phone. On the other end was my manager, Mark, who cut through the cloud of anxiety I felt with a calm, paternal voice that stopped me in my tracks.



“Hey kid, where are you?”



“I’m sorry Mark, I honestly just slept through my alarm, I understand how that sounds, but please know that it wasn't my intention, and it won’t happen again.”



“Sure it will, kid. Shit happens, can you stay over…” he stopped for a moment, probably to check his watch. I felt like it was a little too long. “Let's call it an hour?” 



“For sure! I can absolutely do that. That or make it up early tomorrow, whatever works for you.” The panic that I was barely concealing was clearly evident to Mark, who remained patient and calm with me. 

I was standing in my cold, decoration-less kitchen. Everything in that moment was a reminder of how few things I actually owned, and as I looked around at it all, speaking a few more passing words with Mark before hanging up the phone and getting a good look at my bare apartment. In the heat of Las Vegas summer, everything was lit by an early sun, and it felt empty. I had moved in a few months earlier, and seldom had spare funds to furnish it. But, in the cold emptiness of it, I didn’t really mind. I had been living in my car for the better part of a year beforehand.



When I arrived at the office, I didn’t go in through the front door. Wearing yesterday’s clothes, I slipped into the back entrance behind the tall building, announcing my entrance only with the idle beep of the key-fob, and speed walking through the long, beige hallways to find the mail-room. Its heavy door slammed behind me as I headed down the set of stairs, under the idle glow of roof-hanging bulbs and finally turning the corner, nearly bumping into Mark. He was a tall man, heavyset but strong and solid, and held two masters degrees. But here he was, below in the earth of the city, in a mail-room with a fresh hire on his off day, staring down at me with dark eyes. “You alright, Kid?” He said, cool and calm, like he always was. 



“Yeah. I’m alright. Sorry again.” 



“You’re alright?” His head cocked to the side, looking at my clothes, my skin, my hair. “Let me see your eyes.” He said, gesturing with his finger for me to look him in the eyes. 



“I’m not using again, Mark. I promise.” I said, lifting my chin to look up at him. 



“You know why I have to ask.” He said, flat, a little less warm than normal.



“I know, I know.” I said, taking a deep breath, the shame that settled in my chest this morning now a dull ache that moved slowly throughout me. “I just overslept, man.” 



“Alright. I’ll be back at one with lunch. Head down, nose to grindstone, buddy.” He said, a smile coming back to his face, and his warm tone returning, like a storm had passed over, and the sun had once more shined on me. 



Work moved by slowly, and I did as I was asked. I’ve always been a workhorse, if I had the right push. As I was returning downstairs, after sharing a silent but relatively pleasant lunch with Mark, my phone vibrated. I read the notification and smiled. 



‘It’s a Match!’



As I opened the app, peering at the now-not-entirely-empty list of chats, I took a look at the woman who has been entranced by my one sentence bio, my two photos from over a year ago and my daring good looks (a buzz-cut and a Pearl Jam t-shirt I got at the lost and found). And to my surprise and suspicion, she was hot. I’m talking about absolute smokeshow beautiful. Her photos were like some media influencer’s tutorial on how to make “The Perfect Tinder Profile!” Each photo of hers showed her in some picturesque setting, backpacking through Europe, white water rafting, etc. I immediately identified her as a bot.



Y’know, the kind of bot that refers you to her Onlyfans page or tries to get you to send her “gas money” through Cashapp or some other scam. I checked her bio, which was surprisingly short.



“Hi! I’m a college educated, highly intelligent woman (ask me what sapiosexual means), looking for someone to pass the time with! I love getting outdoors, nerdy stuff like watching Cult Classic movies, video games and Starbucks! :\^p."



The other lines were weird though, just a string of numbers and strange little characters that looked almost like some kind of other language. I’d put them down here, but I don’t even know how to describe what they looked like other than a collection of triangles and thick lines that were put together to almost look like letters, but I couldn’t make heads or tails of them. 



As I was about to block this bot, a message pinged through my phone, and I decided ‘Fuck it.'



Her first message was innocent enough, “Hey Adam! Long time no speak!”



"Oh hi! Have we met before?” I said, hoping and praying I hadn’t. Who knows when she met me, and if she had, I hoped that it was at least in high school, and dreaded that she may have known me after. 



“Omg. No sweetie! It's a reference, I haven’t seen you since the Garden of Eden?”



As I read the message, it confused me to no end. What does she mean by ‘Garden of Eden’? It was at that moment I realized how little I'd actually paid attention to her profile. I read her bio, saw her pictures, but somehow I hadn’t read her name, transfixed by the weird symbols, I’d totally spaced it. I ran to look at it.



Eve. 



“Omg lmao, I’m sorry, at work and my brain is totally scrambled. Hi again Eve, how are the kids?” I personally thought that was a great joke, I was hoping she’d continue the bit. It took a few minutes before she responded.



“Abel is dead, Adam. Killed by Cain. As their father it was your job to teach them how to resolve their differences peacefully. Personally, I'm disappointed, appalled, and straight up pissed. How could you not know?” I couldn’t begin to understand why it hit me so hard. Was she joking? Was this some strange dedication to the bit that hit me somewhere so deep I didn’t know it existed? The feeling of Eve being so angry with me felt like rejection. 



The moment after the feeling passed over me and I regained some of my faculties, realizing how insane this whole situation was, I turned to see she had sent another message. “Why don’t you meet me for dinner to discuss what to do next?” followed by a winky face. 



In an instant, I could feel the foreign shame wash through the rest of me. In a moment, I found myself cracking a smile I did not want to make, and before I knew it, I was picking up my phone from the desk, and thinking very seriously about meeting this girl for dinner.



In a moment like this, one really starts to think about how attractive a woman has to be for you to overlook how weird or crazy she is. My rapid emotional shifts aside, she was easily one of the hottest girls I've ever seen. Hell, my emotional shifts are my problems, not hers. She doesn’t know my past! Considering my lack of other options, the blank and empty nature of my apartment, working late, why not stay on this side of town? I hadn’t had a girl offer to take me out since Reverse Prom, and frankly, her forwardness was hot. Standing in the mailroom, mulling it all over, I realized that minutes had passed. I sent her a few restaurant ideas. 



When work was done, I reached into my backseat and grabbed up some clothes I left in my car over the weekend (thankfully, my Pearl Jam shirt was at home). I felt as ready as I could be for a date at a chain restaurant downtown. Fixing my hair in the mirror, I wondered if somehow Eve still wasn’t real. Maybe she wouldn’t show. Maybe my luxury restaurant idea being Chilis may or may not have turned her off of pursuing her biblical husband.



Standing by the entrance, looking just as perfect as her pictures suggested, stood Eve. I suddenly felt very under dressed. Whether Eve had seemingly either never heard of the standard attire for a first date at a chain restaurant, or she simply didn’t own clothes that didn’t accentuate and actually amplify her beauty, I'll never know. As I drew closer toward her, making my way through the flickering streetlight’s rays, she met my eyes. Her eyes. They scared me. 



While it might not make sense to all of you, I'll do my best to explain just how eerie Eve’s gaze made me feel. In her pictures, she was always wearing either a pair of sunglasses. That, or wearing some kind of hat that obscured her eyes from full view. I hadn’t minded, I wasn’t the kind of guy who held preferences so closely that he needed to know a woman’s eye color. But when Eve’s eyes fell on me, I realized that they were dark, an abyssal, stygian dark that made me feel like she was staring through me. They were glossy, like a predator in a nature documentary. It actually made me feel uneasy, fearful, even. But at the time, I did the best I could at hiding how she made me feel, taking in the rest of her, how her hair hung so perfectly and slid effortlessly over the back of her jacket, the way her body was less wearing her designer jeans but instead was gently embraced by them. I could see both too much and too little at the same time. She noticed my wandering eye and actually moved her body just enough so that her dark eyes entered my field of view. It felt wrong to meet them, but I braved my anxious mind and did anyway. “Hey Eve. Sorry about the kids, I went out to get milk and cigarettes, and got lost.” 



She smirked, reaching out toward me, grabbing a ball of fuzz I seemingly hadn’t seen on the collar of my polo, and flicking it away. “Don’t be so nervous Adam. I just like dressing up.” Her eyes slid down my body, and in a way, it felt like her long acrylic nails were sliding down my chest, though they remained at her side. 



“Oh!” I said, laughing nervously as her eyes wandered all over me, “Is it that obvious?” 



“Oh no, Adam. You’re doing a great job. I studied psychology at Stanford. You can say I’m just…” she paused, looking away and over my shoulder, like a cat seeing a bird out the window. “observant.” 



I tried, I did, to remain calm, but honestly, that was the single hottest thing a woman had ever said to me. I straightened my back as she sat there, looking at me, and reached into my back pocket, pulling a cigarette from the package, “Wow. I mean…” I had nothing. She had completely spellbound me in one fell swoop. “I just gotta say, you look beautiful. But you already know that.” I held out a cigarette for her. “Want one?”



She eyed the cigarette, her smirk never leaving her face as she took it from my fingers, “Oh my. Lucky Strikes.” She placed the filter between her lips, and leaned out slowly as I drew out the lighter from my opposite pocket, I held my hands up and she slid the end of the cigarette between my hands, and as I flicked it open, the flame didn’t reflect in her dark eyes. She took a deep breath that kept the end alit in orange and red blossoms, and as she drew her fingers up to it, she grasped it solely with her claw-like nails and held it away from her outfit. When I reached down into my package to grab another, she held out her free hand. “Oh no honey, I only need one.” 



I looked up with a smile of my own, not catching exactly what she meant, as she held out her cigarette for me to take. I took it without complaint, and brought it up to my lips, spying the gentle hue of her red lipstick left on the filter. Was that on purpose? As I took a deep draft off of it, her eyebrow rose slowly. “Be careful, sweetheart.” Our eyes met again as I took it away from my lips, and as the smoke drifted lazily over my shoulder in the night breeze, she and I spoke at the same time. 



“At least I don’t take the filters off.” 

“At least you don’t take the filters off.” 





She giggled after, and I was actually taken aback for a moment, letting out a huff of a laugh, “I mean, yeah. These are-” 



“Cowboy Killers.”



“Okay, stop that.” I said jokingly, watching her giggle a little too loudly, looking around and seeing that despite the volume of cars in the parking lot, nobody lingered at the door like me and Eve. When my eyes fell back on Eve, she wasn’t giggling. 



Her eyes had followed mine, and as I looked at her, she was staring right back at me. “Who are you looking at?” She said, voice no longer holding the cute, soft intonation she’d been speaking with since I met her. 



“Uh, nobody.” I said, actually realizing that she…had scared me. Her voice shook me enough to make me shudder, and she saw that too. 



“What’s wrong, Babydoll?” She said, once again soft and gentle. I felt like I was going insane. How did her voice change like that? No one else was around to confirm my suspicions, no one to side-eye our conversation. 



“Let's go inside.”



As we entered the restaurant, I confirmed our reservation, reeling from Eve’s continued silence followed by the single most electrifying things I've ever heard, which seemed to be a common occurrence. Silence, walking toward our booth near the back of the restaurant, followed by a “Hold my purse, would you darling?” Another moment of silence as I settled in the seat, followed by “Do you want to go Dutch, babe?” 



I looked up from setting a napkin or two in my lap, feeling like a real barbarian for not having much to offer in the form of conversation. “Oh, I was thinking I would pay. I don’t mind.” Her eyebrows flicked up, her nails clicking on the table as she briefly considered my proposition, her black eyes slowly rolling across the menu before her.



“Can I get a margarita? I know you wouldn’t mind driving me home.” Again, I felt like every sentence she said was a punch to the gut. It almost felt like Eve carried a confidence only the internet could instill in someone, like she was fully confident in every word that came out of her mouth, and every time she asked me a question or made a request of me I found myself having a very hard time resisting or even developing a thought around the topic. I realized I hadn’t remembered where she lived, nor had I asked, if my memory was to be trusted. I raised my hands in a mock surrender.



“I cannot confirm or deny that.” I said, with a chuckle, not wanting to openly tell a girl on the first date that I'd like to take her home after she gets blasted off of cheap margaritas. Partly, it felt like a test, and I wouldn’t be caught dead even seeming like someone who’d take advantage of a drunk girl. It seemed my answer didn’t satisfy her. Her face twisted into an annoyed sneer, like she didn’t appreciate my joke, but in a blink, it was gone. 



“Chivalry isn’t dead.” Her eyes were locked on my hands, no longer up and raised, but just staring at my knuckles as she spoke, “But you didn’t answer my question, Sweet.” I nodded an affirmative, not exactly proud of my first date performance so far, and she smiled. “Thank you! You’re so sweet, Sweet!” I nodded again, smiling, though deep inside, I was deeply concerned with her innate ability to change her emotions with such speed. It scared me, and not because she was a hot girl who was interested in me, but because her eyes never changed. Our waitress came by and I did my best to avoid eye contact with Eve as I ordered. After she left, Eve began to throw me questions that were hardly first date material. 



“What’s your first memory you can think of?” She said, and of course, I do remember. I was six, playing with mud pies, placing them on plates made of old bark and manning a miniature restaurant in the rural Nevadan sun. The memory actually made me feel warm in the moment. The memory ended in me sticking my hand into a pile of mud to make another pie, but when I did, I jammed my finger against a rock beneath the mud’s surface and broke my fingernail off of at the base.I could remember running inside to tell my mom, my muddy footprints being of greater concern to her than the fleshy string hanging off of my digit. But I didn’t think that was very cute to share on a first date, so I just shared the first half with Eve, who didn’t seem very impressed. “How did your mom react when you tracked mud through the house? Or did your dad or somebody hose you off when you were done?” 



The statement slammed me in the chest. I tried to dismiss it as a coincidence, dirty kid, dirty house, makes sense! But it was the look of disappointment beforehand that made me question, first cowboy killers, and now this? She was either the single greatest body language analyst of the modern era, or she just somehow knew about my earliest memory off of the top of her head. Had she stalked my mother’s social media? I mean, even then, that was incredibly creepy. Eve spoke again, though I didn’t hear her. I took a long sip of water before asking “I’m sorry, what did you say?” 



“I asked if you were okay?” She responded, a look of concern over her face, “You got pretty quiet there, Love.” Her nails clicked louder than they should have as she grabbed a hold of the cup of water on her side of the table, and she sipped it while awaiting my response. No lipstick made its way onto the rim of her cup. 



“Oh yeah, I'm sorry. My mom actually did get really mad when I came into the house. I actually, to be super honest, stuck my hand in my mud pile and hit a rock, broke my fingernail off real bad. She was more mad that I tracked mud through the house than that I was hurt.”



I had no idea why I told her that. I felt anxiety once again rise up through my body, realizing how reflexively I had told her the second half of that memory. “Uh, sorry, I didn’t mean to like, trauma dump on you like that.” I said, almost pitifully. Eve stared into my eyes with those dark orbs as I looked up.



“Oh sweetheart, that is terrible. I would never have done that to you. I can just imagine how sad that must have been, on your hands and knees with a hurt hand, trying to clean. And I can’t even imagine how that vinegar cleaner burned.” Her frown was deep, and she reached out and touched my hand, her claw-like nails were ice-cold on my skin. But I didn’t care, I had never told her that my mother used to make homemade cleaner. The pain in my memory was vivid and made my hand hurt. 



“I need to use the restroom. I’ll be right back.” I said, getting up and sliding out of the booth, feeling Eve's icy nails slide against my skin, holding on for just a second before letting me go. I could almost feel her eyes burning into me, but I didn't look at them, or her for that matter. I almost ran to the bathroom, hearing Eve say something quiet and quick, but I didn't try to understand, I just needed to be alone for a second. Everything was already weighing too much, and I could feel the pressure inside my chest building, like I was having a heart attack. What did Eve know? How did she know?



It was at that moment I could hear another person enter the bathroom. Please don't be Eve. I thought, hearing the strange clicks of a formal shoe echo off of the walls, loud enough to beat back the distant wails of a guitar, the music out in the restaurant loud, then quiet as the door slammed itself shut. The person inside the room with me stopped, and I could hear the sound of them, leaning against something, the little clack of a jacket zipper tapping the baby-changing station. The wall. Was she waiting in here with me? What the hell did she want? Why did she know about my mom? Why did she know anything about me? 



Questions battered me, and I could feel my legs begin to give out from under me, until a man's voice cut through the room, and reached me quickly enough that I steeled myself. But it didn't comfort me. 



“Hey bud, you alright in there?” He said, non-familiar, but warm. Older. “First date?” He said, this time followed by a laugh. 



“Yeah.” I said, not quite knowing why. But slowly realizing that I, despite how insane this all felt, really needed to calm down. I couldn't make myself just ditch Eve, run out of here and back to my apartment, whether it was ego, or some internal form of justice, I knew I would have to get back to that table. That worm of curiosity as to who she was, and how she knew my mother, or me, ate its way up from my dropped stomach until finally the man spoke again, bringing me out of my head enough to have a conversation. 



“I know how you feel. She's way out of your league. No offense.” I felt my anger burn up in my throat for a second, before reality set in and I realized he was joking. He didn't wait for me to answer. “If she came to a fuckin’ Chili's in an outfit like that, she must really like you, or you lied about where you were going.”



“Hey man, I don't know what kind of tough love bullshit you're trying to give me here, but it's getting old real fast. You don't know me.” The words spilled out of me, getting progressively louder, probably making an ass out of myself, I just hoped despite everything that Eve couldn't hear me. The man was quiet for a moment, and after not hearing any reply, or the sounds of his shoes, I threw open the door and looked. 



The man was starkly ordinary. His gray hair and soft eyes didn't bore into me, for they were locked onto the glowing screen of a smartphone. He turned the phone around slowly with a slightly shaking hand, showing me a photo of a photo. Within it lay a younger man, arm wrapped around the shoulders of a beautiful woman. “Told this lovely lady that worked at the flower store I would have loved to take her somewhere nice. Sports bar.” He smiled, a little chuckle that almost drowned out the music above us. “Turns out, she was a Lakers fan. We went to that place for every game, every year. Best players I'd ever seen. Every year, I got to share that with her."



“Who are you?” I said, confusion probably clear on my face. 



“I'm an old fart, sitting in a restaurant, watching the game, watching this girl getting all dressed up and tryna’ talk your ear off. And then all I see is this guy, in a damn polo from Walmart, run in here and hide. What are you doing, son?” 



I didn't know what to say. I just stood there, dumbfounded. This guy had been watching me and Eve since we walked in? Where was he? What had he heard? “She's a pretty girl.” The man said, watching me stand there, looking somehow even more pitiful. “Quit being all nervous for a while and try to have a good time.” 



“I know.” I said, looking down at my shoes. “I uh, I don't even know what she's doing here with me. I got all caught up in what she said, but I can't even wrap my head around why she wanted to go out with me.” I hadn't realized how long it had been, was Eve even going to be there when I got back? Did she think she did something wrong?



“Go find out.” The Old Man said, “And when you take her out for a second date,” he said, with a wink I could feel and not see, “wear a long-sleeve. Your arms look mangled.” 



Then he walked away. I could hear the creak of the bathroom door, and the clacks of his dress shoes. The lights above me flickered, and I turned to face myself in the mirror. I looked terrible. My eyes were sunken in like I hadn't slept, the bags beneath dark blue-purple. My polo was wrinkled, and my arms, I hadn't even looked at my arms. Dotted and crossed from my wrists up, reminders of a different time, a different me.



When I turned the corner, Eve was still there, eyeing the two plates of warm food that sat waiting. How long had I been in the bathroom? I chased away the thought and sat down, eyes cast up at Eve as I sat down. Her eyes met mine, and I couldn't quite see the same darkness within them like I did before. All that was left was a bright little glint of light from overhead that lay just against the calm nighttime sea. She looked at me, more sad than concerned. “I think I need to…” she said, stopping for a second, almost mouthing a thought before reconsidering. “clear the air. I uh, I realize that I'm doing a lot.” She threw her hands up in mock surrender, not unlike me minutes and minutes before. “And uh, I have a few confessions to make.” 



“Confessions?” I asked, staring at her, more confused than anything. But, the way she was acting was somehow more normal than she had ever been. I realized, maybe she's just as nervous as I am, and she just had a different way of expressing it. 



“I know you…a little more than I'm letting on.” My stomach dropped for a beat, she knows, my mind screamed. But I steadied myself, kept my face calm, and tried to slow my heart down. If she knew, and she still came, then she had already made her decision. If she knew, she still wanted to see me. 



“Okay, what do you know about me, Eve?”



“Well, of course, when I saw you, I thought you were really cute. I saw you were from Vegas, and I'm from Boulder City, so I kinda…asked around about you.” My heart sank. Who could she have talked to? All my friends, I hadn't seen them in years. With everything that happened since…junior year? I hadn't even begun to try and reach out. Too much time and too much life that they got to live and I didn't. I just wasn't…on their level anymore. “I'm sure if you asked around about me, your friends probably couldn't have found me either. We just…hadn't ever known about each other. And to me, I thought kinda…wow! A fresh face. So, I basically looked around. I tried to find your Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, anything. Nothing. It kinda seemed like you just…showed up one day.” 



“You could…say that.” I said, eyeing my chicken sandwich with less hunger, but more out of a need to avoid Eve's sad, sweet face. She smiled meekly at me, and I looked at her again, her hand reached out and touched mine. Her nails were warm. 



“I know.” She said. Fuck. I thought my worst fear was realized, even though I tried to fight it, I couldn't hide the disappointment on my face. “It doesn't make you any less of a man to me. I think you're great! It's really sweet that you're trying to be all respectful and…I don't know, normal?” 



“Yeah, normal is a way to put it. I just…I just really don't like to point it out. I was going through a bad time, and yknow, I made some mistakes and got clean, I'm just trying to live my life again.” As much as I didn't want to tell her, as I did, I felt like some part of me was finally letting some of the tension ease out, releasing steam I didn't know was putting so much pressure on my mind and my emotions. “How did you know about the cleaner, my mom?” 



“You guys don't talk anymore, but she posted just about everything.” She said, looking more guilty as time went by. 



“Jesus. What did she say?” 



“She talked about you, about how she wishes things were different, her boyfriends, a bunch of stuff. She honestly stopped posting about you after a while. I wish you didn't have to hear about it from me, Sweet. But I mean, yeah, I saw some of her stories about you cleaning up the mud when you were a kid, hand injury included. It really sucked to see how she treated you. I mean, I can't imagine the shit she didn't post about you.” 



“It was bad. Really bad. I haven't even talked to her in years. She changed her number and dropped off the earth when I went into rehab. Said all this crazy shit. I'm sorry you had to see all that. No crazy in-laws, at least, right?” I said, trying to smile, and bring some levity back into this arguably poor time out with my dream girl, internet stalking aside. 



She giggled, which made me smile, tightening her grip somewhat on my hand. “You better stop, before I fall in love with you…or something.” 



“Oh nooooo. How could I cope with that?”



It was an hour or two later when the check arrived. Eve and I had spent the time talking about life, her time at Stanford, her Valedictorian speech and what it was about. She was a mystifying woman in all aspects. I hadn't experienced a connection with another person like that in my entire life. She told me about her childhood memories, from going on safari in Africa, to embarrassing teenage anecdotes about being a part of the “Marble Hornets” fandom. Honestly, even though I didn't understand half of what she was talking about, she patiently explained most of it to me, and I was grateful. She really loved it when I asked her the deepest questions I could think of, and each of her answers made me ask more, I felt like I got to know Eve quicker than anybody. I told her almost everything. Honestly, telling her didn't bother me; it felt like I'd known her my entire life. And who wouldn't tell someone like that exactly how you felt?



She reached for the check before I had a chance to glance a look at the total. “Oh my. We went a little overboard.” She said, with a smile and a dramatic turn of the check toward me. We had gone overboard, clearing 78 dollars at Chilis felt wrong. I grabbed it from her, pulling out my wallet. “What are you doing?” Eve said, as if it was stupid idea. Thankfully her face revealed how grateful she was.



“Oh really? You don't want me to pay for this?” I said, waving the check in her direction. “Too bad. My treat, I picked the place.” 



“Oh, Adam.” She said, closing her hands together as if she were praying. Though suddenly, a devious smile took over her expression, and she grabbed the check from me as I searched for my card. “I ordered four margaritas!” Her eyes flashed over to me one more time, and when I looked up at her, card in hand, she smiled wide and said “and I don't have any money!” 



“Oh my god.” I said, guffawing at the ceiling as I leaned back in the booth. Eve was not going to stop, though, lamenting at how she was just a simple, small town girl, and how would she ever pay for such a big, big bill. She probably would have continued, breaking me down, but I caved at the last minute and nearly keeled over the table in a flood of giggles. She didn't last much longer after me, laughing so hard she hit her head on the table with a heavy thud, grabbing her forehead, laughing even harder as I frantically asked her if she was okay. As I looked around to see if anyone had noticed her bashing her pretty head into the tabletop, my eyes floated to a table near us, situated almost perfectly to both look at the front door, and me and Eve's table. It was empty, and a plaque sat above its high-backed seating, though I couldn't read the words.



 Eve settled down after a few minutes, reaching toward me with her claws, grabbing my wrist and pulling me almost across the table, her lips meeting mine. I blushed, eyes wide open, staring at her closed lids as she kissed me. It had been the first time anyone had kissed me since 11th grade, and I'd honestly forgotten how, but before I could formulate a thought on how to respond, she pulled away from my face, my bottom lip caught for a half-second between her teeth. I almost gasped, and we both fell back into our seats, her beautiful eyes staring deeply into mine, her bright red lips smudged a little around the edges. She must have seen how red I'd gotten, as she laughed more to herself than anything else, before placing a black, metallic card into the slot on the checkbook, and letting it stand by the edge of the table. 



As she busied herself shortly after in her purse, I found myself staring for a while, my mind and heart still swimming with ideas and thoughts I'd rather not share here. I didn't know exactly what they were, but they filled me up with a soft, warm feeling, and I rubbed my elbow to busy my hands, finally tearing my gaze away from her. My eyes, ever adventurous, wandered across the restaurant again, finding that blurry, old plaque above the empty booth. Something was warm in my throat, I noticed, and as I raised my finger to check it, the waiter swung by and grabbed the checkbook. 



“Are we enjoying ourselves?” He asked, to which both me and Eve gave each other a quick glance, my eyes darting back with an awkward, put-upon response of “Yeah! Yeah, it was great!” The waiter smiled at the two of us, “You both are a very cute couple.” 



My eyes flicked back to Eve, trying to make some sort of contact with her, do you say yeah? What do you even say to something like that? God, please don't say something like ‘Well, we're not a couple, but thanks!’ 



Eve responded quicker than I could. “Oh thank you! He's a real doll, isn't he?” She finally looked at me, face completely unchanged by the awkwardness of the situation, her ease almost eerie. I am severely under-prepared for this. 



“Yeah!” Was all I could muster. My face must have turned bright red again, as the waiter gave me a merciful out, departing with Eve's card. “Oh boy, sorry. I didn't know what to say to that. I didn't want to say we aren't like, dating, but I also didn't want to put pressure on you a-” 



Eve shushed me with a clawed finger, the warm acrylic touching my lip, “Don't say another word, it's okay Babe. I know, it's just one date. A really, really good one. I have had such a great time.” 



Her acrylic was still pressed to my face when I answered, “Oh, thanks! I'm so glad you're having a good time. It feels like I've known you my entire life.” 



“Maybe you have.” Her nails slid against my face as she stood on two woozy legs, grabbing her purse and striding toward me. I got up not too much later, on much steadier, sober legs than Eve. Nevertheless, as we walked slowly through the restaurant, her arm slid through mine, and I half-walked, half-carried her outside. As we stopped, I could see her eyes gazing up at me, and as I drew the cigarettes from my pocket, she was still staring. I finally flicked my eyes up at her, drawing a pair of identical smokes from the foil, and holding one out for her. She didn’t say much, and her eyes did not abate from me as she took it from my outstretched fingers. They still didn’t move as I lit hers, and she took a single, deep draft that brought the embers quickly down the stem, and as I lit my own with a much less powerful breath, I could begin to feel them digging into me. I turned to face her.



“What?” I said, innocent enough, smoke trailing from my mouth, lost to the wind. Eve hadn’t let any out yet. Her face was tense, though she wore a smile. Her perfectly white teeth parted just barely enough, and as she spoke, it was as if she had forgotten how. 



“Take me home.” She said, simply. Her gaze had once again grown dark, eyes swallowing the light, almost drawing a strange darkness over her face. I felt such a strange sense come over as she stared. I was lonely, sure, but something about the offer made me feel so insignificant and boyish that I almost instinctively accepted. 



But more than that, however terrible that sounds, I felt a sense of dread. Eve’s eyes, however dark they turned, has evaded my perception. I knew what they looked like, but I couldn’t find myself able to articulate it, even to myself. But now, I could. 



She was hungry. In that moment I could even see the outline of wetness in the corners of her mouth, threatening to run down her lips. “No, Eve. You’re drunk, I couldn’t do something like that with you.” Her face changed further as I spoke, rejection clearly stinging her. Her eyes told me most of all, the darkness in them somehow turning a deeper shade of black. 



“I’ll sober up, Adam.” She said, a pang of sadness making her quiet and soft again, though her body told me far more anger had overtaken her than the sadness I could hear. “I promise.” She said, almost through her teeth. Like I was asking her for something that offended her, like I had told her she didn’t look good enough, or something. Did she feel entitled? I thought at that moment, and that made me angry.



“Eve. You’re drunk. I’ve had a great night, and maybe we can…go back to your place next time?”



That did not help, or assuage her in any form. She took another angry drag from her cigarette, drawing the embers down dangerously close to her fingers. As it did, she stared at it, before throwing it unceremoniously into the ashtray. “Why are you trying to make this hard on me?” She said, looking away from me, into the night.



“I have no idea what you mean, Eve. I just don’t want to fuck a drunk girl. Is that a bad thing?” I said, not really understanding any part of this incredibly pissed reaction from her. 



“How do you not know?” She said, still not looking at me. “Did you read none of the signs? I fucking knew it.” She said, shaking her head, rubbing her temples with her fingers as she stared at the ground. She looked paler now, the light not being so eaten up by her eyes, I could see she didn’t look well. 



“Come on Eve. You’re drunk. I’ll call you an Uber, and you text me when you get home, okay?” It was the best I could do. I know now more than anything I'd rather not take this angry, drunk girl home in my own car.



“I’m not talking about that. You should know I'm not even talking about that. God, you should know. You don’t know, Adam. You don’t fucking know.” Her words trailed off, and as I came up to her, typing in the address of the restaurant, I put an arm around her and rubbed her shoulder. She was so cold. 



“What’s your address? I’ll stay with you until they get here, make sure you don’t walk off. It's gonna be okay.” I felt strange comforting her, as she silently stared at the ground, before her arm slowly came from behind me and she gripped me like she might fall. I felt a weird taste in my mouth as she did, but I didn’t bother to check it. She took my phone from me, her hair and her shoulders obscuring it from me as she typed it in. She had my phone for longer than I thought she would, and when she gave it back to me I saw the ride was about 5 minutes away. Thank God, I thought. 



When the man came by eventually, I pushed her forward a little, almost carrying her to the car’s rear door. I told the driver to take care of her, and fished a few bills from my pocket for the inconvenience. Eve got into the car on her own, and through the tinted window I could see her shifting in the seat, putting on her seatbelt. The driver was thankfully grateful, and as he turned and exchanged a few quiet words with Eve, she just picked up her chin and said, “Drive.” The man stopped talking, and looked at me with an awkward side-glance before clicking the window button and putting the car in gear. I could almost feel like Eve was staring directly at me as the car whipped out of the parking lot.



When I did get home, everything felt even more empty. Like I had an opportunity to share a moment with Eve, but didn’t take it. I chased the thought out of my mind as I locked every door and window (a nervous habit of mine), and cracked open a beer to go with my shower. By the time I finally crawled back into bed, the time had crawled to 11:31. An early night, I thought, as sleep began to overtake me. Pulling myself up against my pillow, I pulled out my phone, shooting a text off to Eve. “You home?” I said, staring at the screen, hoping to see the jumping dots. But I didn’t. I slid the phone back under my pillow. I tried to fight it off, but the darkness of sleep came anyway.



The darkness didn’t last. When I woke up, I could hear my alarm blaring, but I couldn’t move. Staring at the dark ceiling, I couldn’t force myself to move even a muscle. My dry eyes ached, and I could barely force myself to blink. My mouth tasted like blood. I tried to reach for my phone, to no avail. The only thing I could do was stare, and wonder hopelessly at why I felt like something was burning into the side of my head.
