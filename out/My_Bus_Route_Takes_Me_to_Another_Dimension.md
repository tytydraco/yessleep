I’m not really sure how to start, but I figured I should keep a log or a diary or whatever you want to call this in case something happens to me. My name is Jake Peterson, and if I ever vanish one day, let mine be a cautionary tale on why you shouldn't take weird jobs you find on kijiji. I leave all my earthly possessions to my roommate Alan. Right now I’m sitting outside Sally-O’s, my town’s one and only truck stop, trying to figure out if what just happened to me was real or a really long, vivid drug trip. 

I only answered the ad because I was desperate. I’d just moved halfway across Canada to the sleepy, northwestern town of White Pines with no real plan and barely enough money to split the rent with an online friend who agreed to let me crash at his place. Due to a *colourful* history with the law, not even the great Tim Horton would let me do the honour of scraping his illustrious grease pits for minimum wage. 

I found myself doomscrolling job sites yesterday, applying to whatever I came across. After sending my sparse resume to the three indeed listings that were within fifty kilometres of White Pines, I walked down the street to the unemployment office only to find that they had closed. It was the exact type of irony that, had I not been on the verge of homelessness again, I would’ve found hilarious. Later that evening, I was sprawled out on the bedroom/kitchen/living room floor listening to Alan take godzilla-sized bong rips while I scoured kijiji for odd jobs. The police here must be unemployed as well because I scrolled past two listings blatantly advertising the sale of magic mushrooms. I’m pretty sure at least one of them was Alan’s. 

I was about to call it quits when I saw a post at the bottom of the last page.

BUS DRIVER WANTED NO EXPERIENCE NEEDED MUST BE WILLING TO WORK NIGHTS. The picture attached to the listing was a blurry, unflattering selfie of a bald old man. It looked like he had taken the photo by accident. The listing was punctuated in a similarly nonexistent manner. “Bus driver wanted for Salmon Forest Transportation Company must have a full licence must be willing to work nights must be able to follow written instructions call the number below if interested serious inquiries only.” 

“Have you ever heard of Salmon Forest Transportation Company?” I asked Alan.

He hacked smoke like a dragon with COPD before choking out a weak “Nah man. Only bus that even stops at White Pines is the Greyhound and it only comes, like, twice a week,” he said as he re-packed his bowl. “And salmon don’t live in the forest.” 

“Thanks, Alan.”

“Word.” He took another cancer-inducingly large rip before holding the bong out to me, shaking it like he was jangling keys in front of a toddler. I was insulted by how well it worked. I checked the listing. It was already ten days old. One more night wouldn’t hurt. I bookmarked the page and resolved to call the number tomorrow.

\*\*\*

So today, at around nine in the morning, I re-opened the listing. It was still there and still only had two visits. Assuming it wasn’t a trap set by a murderer to lure in his next victim, I might actually have a decent shot at getting the job. I called the number at the bottom of the page and waited. On the third ring, someone picked up, and a man’s voice with a thick accent muttered something that got lost in static.

“Is this Salmon Forest transportation? I’m calling to ask if you still need a bus driver.”

“Yer callin' bout the job?” My best description of how he sounded would be like if the lucky charms elf suddenly aged eighty years then spent his remaining ten in Newfoundland drinking away his pain. He slurred all his words together into sentence soup, but I’ve spent enough time around people in various states and types of intoxication, so I could decipher him pretty easily.

“Yea. Is it still available?”

“Canye drive?”

“Yea.”

He harrumphed in what I think was approval. “Swing by Sally-O’s a’ six inth’eve,” he slurred.

He hung up before I had the chance to thank him, or ask any questions, or tell him anything else about myself other than the fact that I could drive. That meant he probably wouldn’t be running any background checks, which was alright with me. 

Everything that happened after that was boring. I shaved, got dressed in the nicest clothes I owned (jeans and a non-stained t-shirt), woke Alan from his weed coma, blah blah blah. 

Fast forward to six PM. I stood in the parking lot of the Sally-O’s, watching the *O* flicker while I waited for…whoever I was waiting for. The serial killer I was about to be abducted by, probably. It was six thirty-three, and I was about to start the walk of shame back to the apartment when the oldest bus I had ever seen pulled up next to the gas pump. 

I’m not a car guy so I couldn’t tell you what the model was, but it had to be from the 70’s at the very latest. Think of one of those brick cell phones from fifty years ago. Now paint it brown and slap four wheels on the side and you’ve got the general idea. Also, it was painted to look like a fucking salmon, with a grey to brown gradient and a pattern on the sides that I think were supposed to be scales? It was too rusty to tell. None of those were what caught my attention, though. My eyes went straight to the jagged gashes that ran along the side of the bus, concentrated near the front and back doors. It looked like someone tried to get into the bus with one of those oversized anime swords you see in video games.

*Salmon Forest Transportation Co.* was painted on its side in (fittingly) salmon pink. I was deciding whether or not having money for food was worth being known as the guy who drives the fishmobile when the door slid open and an old man hopped out. It was unmistakably the same guy from the selfie. He was short, squat, and oddly reminiscent of a thumb thumb from spy kids. For someone who sounded like he was one shot away from liver failure, he didn’t look or act drunk. “Are ye th’ new driver?” Sure sounded like it, though. 

“That’s me. I’ve got my resume—”

He waved a chunky hand in dismissal. “Dunneed it. Canye read a map?”

“Yea. I’ve also got a GPS—”

His entire forehead furrowed. “No GPS. I’ll give ye a map.” 

“Of course. Sorry.” I was a bit weirded out and I definitely didn’t look forward to driving the salmon bus, but my internal voice of reason shut up when he produced a cheque from the pocket of his tweed vest. 

“Ye start tonight.” He handed me a crumpled cheque for five hundred dollars. “Yer bonus. Fer signin’ on. Come back again tomorrow and ye’ll have th’ job.”

“I don’t have the job now?”

His eyes were unnaturally green. Like, neon, shamrock shake green. They glinted as he grinned at me, showing off bright, white teeth that belonged on a billboard selling toothpaste. “Yer on a trial run,” he said as I pocketed the cheque. “Rules’re on th’ steerin’ wheel. Map’s under th’ visor. When yer done, leave ‘er by the gas pump n’ I’ll filler up ‘fore yer next shift.”

I nodded. It seemed simple enough at the time. Follow the map, pick up nobody, because nobody in their right mind would be seen on this bus, and collect paychecks while I figure out how to fix my life. The man who I think is my new boss tossed me the keys before heading into Sally-O’s. 

A group of teenagers pulled into the parking lot and I rushed into the salmon wagon before they had the chance to associate my face with it. The interior smelled like a thrift shop that allowed smoking, the upholstery was a mouldy, forest-green plaid and the whole thing creaked every time I shifted my weight. That last one might be a personal issue. There was a bright pink sheet of construction paper with a list of rules taped to the steering wheel. They must’ve been written by someone other than the old man, because the person who wrote them seemed familiar with the concept of punctuation.

1 - Start at 6:30 pm sharp. Start and finish your route at Sally-O’s.

I checked my phone. It was six forty five. So much for rule number one.

2 - Follow the map *~EXACTLY~*. No detours or unscheduled stops.

3 - If the map changes, keep following highway 16.5. *~Do not leave highway 16.5.~* Do not switch to a GPS or any digital navigation service. Do not lose the map.

4 - Do not stare at passengers. They might think you’re being rude.

5 - If a passenger speaks to you in a language you don’t understand, nod and tell them their stop is next. Be polite. If they offer you anything, take it and thank them. 

There was an addendum squished between rules five and six. *Accept but* *~do not eat~* *any food given to you by a passenger*.

6 - In case of hostile wildlife, pull the chain beside the sun visor and speed up. You are allowed to skip stops if you deem them unsafe, but skipped stops must be recorded in the logbook kept under the driver’s seat.

I looked up. There was a chain that looked like it came from a ceiling fan swinging from the ceiling. I resisted the immediate urge to pull it and kept reading.

7 - Drive safe! 

Then, beneath it—*Salmon Forest Transportation Company is not responsible for any injury that may occur as a result of the passengers, wildlife or locations travelled to.* *These rules are guidelines and may not apply to all situations.* 

If I had any survival instinct I would’ve read those weird ass rules, marched into Sally-O’s and told the irish thumb thumb there was no way in hell I was going to do this for any amount of money. Instead, I buckled my seatbelt, flipped the visor down and caught the map with my face. I fumbled with it, trying to get it open as quickly as possible. The teenagers had noticed the salmon bus and were taking their phones out, and I didn’t feel like being the subject of a viral tiktok.

When I eventually got the map unfolded, I saw my route was marked with red highlighter. I gently peeled the tape off the rule sheet, tucked the rules under the seat and stuck the map to the driver’s side window. I could still see over it so don’t come after me about safety or whatever. I had to turn the key in the ignition twice before the bus sputtered awake.

The first stop was only a few kilometres up the road, marked with a big red X. To my surprise, someone was actually there. I stopped the bus and let my first passenger board. He was a scruffy looking homeless dude, and he flashed me a gap-toothed grin as he limped onto the bus. As he passed he placed a silver coin into my cup holder. It looked like one of those Japanese coins with the square holes in the middle, except this one was totally featureless. I shrugged. It wasn’t like there was a spot to scan a metro card, and I wasn’t about to fight a homeless dude over a bus fare. I’ve been there before, I get it.  

He hobbled past me. I blinked. The dude was barefoot—I think? He wasn’t wearing anything below his shorts, but he walked—if walking is the right word—to the back of the bus on his fists like a gorilla. Not the fists that were on the ends of his arms, where fists usually are. This guy had two pairs of hands and a wrist where his ankles and feet should’ve been, and his knees contorting at strange angles as he sat down. I turned back to the road, blaming what I just saw on whatever was in the weed Alan shared with me last night. 

The rest of the way to sixteen point five was normal. Old growth pines covered in moss, mountain slopes in the distance on either side, the setting sun peeking through the trees. It was beautiful. Peaceful. I felt like my fresh start was finally starting, you know? Like I actually made a good choice for the first time in forever. I’d dismissed my earlier concerns about a bus route going right through the middle of buttfuck nowhere, assuming the whole thing was just an old tourist trap, a relic from back when White Pines was a semi-popular skiing destination. At that moment it was just me and a double jointed hobo with weird feet on a scenic bus ride through the mountains. 

I had been keeping an eye on the map and noticed I was getting closer to highway sixteen point five, which was weird because I hadn't seen any signs for it at all. Another few minutes passed and I was starting to think I’d missed my turn, when I saw a gap between two dead pines. They wove together at the top, forming a sharp arch, like the window of a cathedral. The moss on the trees had grown so long that it formed a curtain, but there was unmistakably a road underneath it. I slowed, prayed that I wasn’t pulling into someone’s driveway and passed under the mossy veil. 

At first the forest was so dense and dark that I couldn’t see anything outside the reach of my headlights. The moss was longer there, the trees knotted and twisted and sickly-looking. If you need a better visual, look up “spooky forest” and click the first stock image you see. It’ll probably be pretty close. 

Then the forest began to change. At first it was just some thicker grasses in the ditch beside the road. Then the grass spread into the forest itself, choking out all the plants on the ground. Eventually it replaced the trees, until all I could see was shoulder height grass drifting gently in the wind under the pitch black sky. I looked up. There were no stars. Had it suddenly gotten cloudy? I didn’t recall B.C being known for vast grasslands, either. I checked the map again to make sure I hadn’t taken a wrong turn.

You know when you miss a step going down the stairs and your whole body has an *oh shit* moment? When I looked at the map it felt like I missed an entire flight. The map I had been given earlier was your standard issue general reference map. Roads, mountains, rivers, all that shit. This was *not* the map I started with. The rivers and mountains and nearby highways were gone, like they were never there. Highway sixteen point five had gone from an uneven loop through the mountains to a straight line that split the map cleanly down the middle.

I want to say that I stayed calm and followed the rules like I’m sure everyone reading this thinks they would’ve done. But the truth is, when shit like this happens to you, rational thoughts take a backseat. People try to reason themselves out of impossible things, even when they see them with their own eyes. Forget the rules, I was finding somewhere to pull over and using waze. 

Right as I was about to pull over on the side of the road, I felt a cold hand on my shoulder. The homeless man was standing next to me, pointing at something ahead of us. His smile was too wide, passing his cheekbones and stretching his lips paper thin. I looked to where he was pointing. There was a break in the grass up ahead. 

When I was close enough to see past the wall of grass, I saw a little old church in the middle of a clearing. White paint was coming off its clapboard siding in large flakes and the cemetery was full of weathered, moss covered stones. I looked back at the map. It wasn’t a scheduled stop. I didn’t see any stops on this road at all, actually, but since I was going to stop either way, I might as well let this guy off while I was here.

I pulled onto a gravel patch in front of the church, killed the engine and took out my phone. The homeless guy took a step towards the door and stopped. He stared at me unblinkingly. His smile didn’t waver as he reached into his pocket. *Fuck. He’s got a gun. This is how it ends. Shot to death on the salmon bus. Funny, I always thought it would be an overdose.* He pulled out a small black marble and put it in the cupholder. Still smiling. I smiled back as best I could. 

“Sometimes this bus finds people who need it. Sometimes it finds people who deserve it. Figure out which one you are, Jake Peterson.” His voice was a whisper that filled the whole bus. It was raspy, high and low at the same time, two voices fighting for the same space in his throat. His mouth made all the wrong shapes as he talked, like he had been dubbed improperly. I could smell his breath from the driver’s seat. It smelled like death and decay.

Before my brain untangled itself enough to respond, he stepped off the bus and, I shit you fucking not, dropped down on all fours and scuttled up the side of the church like a bug. 

I was stunned for a second before putting my phone away and restarting the engine. FUCK this. Whatever the hell that was, I wasn’t sticking around to find out more. I took a deep, shuddering breath. *Just keep following the road. I can do that. Then I’ll go home and tell Alan to stop cutting his weed with weird shit*.

I took the wheel, eased the gas pedal down, and what I can only describe as a tick the size of a golden retriever flew against the windshield.

I shrieked in a very unmacho way and floored it. The bus shot forward into the grass and the thing on the windshield screeched back at me. I could see its underbelly had one giant mouth like a lamprey, lined with thousands of tiny, razor sharp teeth. Its black body shone like obsidian as it skittered across the windshield, punching holes into the glass with four giant spikes it had in place of feet. I swerved wildly, trying to shake the parasite from hell that was crawling all over my bus.

I heard glass breaking and metal tearing I risked a glance backwards and saw more of those things jumping onto the bus from the grass, punching holes through the ceiling and tearing away the metal like tinfoil. One of them had managed to punch a window out and was trying to squeeze its round body onto the bus. If I was braver or wittier I would’ve made some sort of quip about it not paying its fare.

The bus hit a bump and a few of the things fell off. The ground got smoother and the grass parted, and I realised that I had made it back to the road. For all the good that did. None of the rules covered what to do in case of giant parasites, unless—*In case of hostile wildlife, pull the chain beside the sun visor and speed up.* I grabbed the chain and yanked.

I wasn’t sure what I expected. Some sort of alarm? Bug spray? A fully automated, salmon-themed weapons system? Wrong, wrong, stupid. The bus made a sound like a foghorn, low and deep and so fucking *loud*. Like, I do not have enough adjectives to describe how loud this shit was. It made my head feel like it was gonna cave in. The effect was immediate. The things scrambled over one another to get away. The bus jolted as a few of them fell under the tires. Even the thing on the windshield leapt off the bus like it was a burning ship. 

I’m not sure why whoever wrote the rules felt the need to include *speed up* after pulling the horn. I drove that bus like I was trying out for NASCAR. I didn’t bother to look at the map. Fuck the other stops, fuck whatever those things were, I was going back to slap the lucky charms out of the dude who put me up to this. 

After a few more minutes of white knuckling the wheel, a few trees began to stick out of the expanse of grass, then a few more, until I found myself back in the forest. The regular one, not the creepy one. I looked at the map. It had gone back to normal, but the bus still looked like it had been on the set of Jurassic Park when all the dinosaurs got loose. 

I skipped every stop on the way back. I’d get fired either way as soon as my would-be boss saw the state the bus was in. I think the grass only covered part of the route, because it took me a good half an hour at top speed just to reach highway sixteen. I pulled into the Sally-O’s parking lot and rushed inside to release the shit that I’d barely managed to keep out of my pants. When I came out of the bathroom, baldie was chatting with a cashier. 

He smiled when he saw me. “So! How many rules did ye break?” 

All my creative curse insults about his hairlessness were gone. I didn’t realise it until then, but I was so *tired*. All I could think about was going home and sleeping into next year. I guess running for your life does that to you. “I made an unplanned stop.” I paused to think. “And I didn’t drive safe.”

“Did ye pick *anyone* up?” he said in a tone of voice that made me think he fucking *expected* this to happen. 

I was too tired to worry about sounding insane. “A homeless dude with feet hands. I dropped him off at a church and he tipped me with a marble.”

Baldie spat. “*That* arsehole. He’s banned. Should’a told ye. Anyways, name’s Marvin. I’ll be yer new boss if ye stay.”

There was only one thing that could make me do that again. “What's the salary?”

He grinned. “Forty bucks an hour.”

\*\*\*

I’m still not sure if I should go back or not. On one hand, I did almost die, but on the other, fourty an hour for driving a bus is pretty damn good. I’m gonna tell Alan exactly what happened and see if he believes me or not. Alan’s told me about drug trips he’s had that are around this level of crazy, so I think he’s the only one who wouldn’t write me off immediately. 

I’ll update if I decide to go back.
