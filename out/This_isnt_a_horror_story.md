I know many of you might think this is just another typical scary story, but please, listen to me. It's serious, and if you ever find yourself in the same situation, I beg you not to make the same mistake I made. Do not search for "Nemesys," do not accept any friend request from him. This is no joke.

It all started when I read a post on a forum. I can't remember the name of the site, but it was one of those old, semi-abandoned forums. An anonymous user had written something that stuck with me:

"If you find Nemesys online, you're already dead."

The post was closed soon after, and the entire thread vanished from the site. I thought it was just a legend, one of those stories that spread for no reason. Like with anything I read on the internet, I told myself it would never happen to me. I was wrong.

One night, out of pure curiosity, I searched for "Nemesys" on the deep web. I'm not easily scared, and I enjoy exploring those darker corners of the internet. But there was nothing about him. Nothing, until, during a random search, I came across a strange link:

**nemesys\_666real.onion**

I didn’t think it was real, but curiosity got the better of me. I clicked.

The page was simple, too simple: a black background with a red phrase in the center of the screen that said:  
"Welcome. I can see you now."

When I read it, my computer shut down on its own. I thought it was just a glitch, maybe a virus. But it wasn't. That sentence was just the beginning.

The next day, I turned on my phone and saw a strange notification. There was no app associated with it, but the message said:

"Friend request from Nemesys."

It was impossible. There was no friend request on any of my apps, but the notification was there, as if someone had taken control of my phone. I tried to ignore it, but I couldn’t get rid of it. I couldn’t delete it. Then came the message:  
"I've found you."

It was accompanied by a photo. A photo of me, taken from my computer while I was sitting in front of the screen, but I didn’t remember it. It looked as though someone had been watching me in that moment, but I was alone at home.

From that point on, things only got worse.  
My webcam turned on by itself, for no reason. When I looked in the mirror, my reflection seemed to move with a slight delay. Sometimes I would hear my name whispered quietly, but when I turned around, no one was there.

I thought I was just stressed, but it wasn’t. He was really following me.

That night, I received another message. It was shorter, but even more unsettling:

"Now we play."

I clicked on the attached file, and inside was an audio recording. It was my breathing. The sound of a person breathing, but it wasn’t me. I couldn’t explain how it was possible.

I tried to delete everything, change my number, even move to another city, but it was useless. Everywhere I go, every device I turn on, every screen I look at… there’s always a message from him.

"I’m coming."

If I don’t update this post, it means I didn’t make it. And I’m not asking you to believe me. I’m just trying to warn you.  
If you ever get a friend request from "Nemesys," please do not accept it. Don’t do it. This is not a joke.

Please, don’t make the same mistake I did.
