I am 13 years old and have lots of hobbies. My main hobby is collecting teddy bears. I keep them in the top bunk of my bunk bed because I live alone in my room. I have 4 siblings and don't get along with them all the time. I love/loved my teddy bears and I always keep an eye on my siblings to make sure they don't take any.

One morning when I woke up and went to check on the bears and one was missing. I looked about frantically in my room but couldn't find it. My brother's room is right next to mine, so I went in his. I saw the bear lying at the end of his bed. I took it and woke him up. We argued for a while. He insisted that he didn't do anything, but I wouldn't hear it. I refused to believe him and took the bear downstairs.

Later that day I went up to my room and found two more bears missing. I yelled for my brother and he came in holding both bears. We argued again. I was so angry at this point that I hardly heard him say he found them on the banister. I took the bears, yelled at him to never come in my room again, and slammed the door on his face.

That night while I was in bed, I heard a rustling sound and sat up. Just for a bit of context, I don't usually sleep with my teddy bears in my bed. This night I know I didn't. When I sat up I saw the three teddy bears that went missing sitting at the end of the bed. Confused rather than frightened, I got up and took them back to the top bunk. When I climbed back down I saw another bear sitting on my pillow. Now I was getting scared. I then heard some whispering noises and looked up to see all the other bears gathered at the top of the ladder. I screamed and ran out of my room. I went to my parents bedroom and told them what happened. They came running in to find all the bears sitting as they were supposed to on the top bunk. They assumed that I had been dreaming and told me to go back to bed. When I argued otherwise they agreed to let me sleep with them in their room.

At around midnight I woke up to chills going down my spine. I sat up and looked to the door. There, sitting in front of the door, was the teddy bear that first went missing that day, staring straight at me. I shivered and lay back down.

The next day I dumped out all my teddy bears (there were about 30 or so) and never experienced anything of the kind again. But I can never forget that time I realized my teddy bears were possessed, and I can certainly never forget that bone-chilling moment when I saw one of my teddy bears staring right back at me.
