 So I recently moved into a new house in a pretty nice cul-de-sac. It’s surrounded by carbon copy houses and this one was in the same price range as the others; so I didn’t expect anything out of the ordinary. It’s only a two bedroom place with a full bathroom, a one car garage and a spacious living room. I live alone so I’ve turned one of the bedrooms into an office space so that I can work from home.
 Now I’ve gotten moved in, my bedroom looks nice and I’ve even had friends over. So when the haunting started I had already gotten comfortable with the space. At first it was small things: maybe the tv would already be on when I got up to make breakfast, or one of my dining room chairs was pulled back away from the table. One morning I even came out to see that my shelf of figurines were all turned so that they faced my bedroom door; but soon enough it got worse.

 Whatever was messing with me began to do so in my waking hours. I’d turn away from the bathroom only for the door to close and the light to come on, or I’d be watching tv and my fridge would swing open whenever my eyes weren’t on it. These always happened whenever I wasn’t looking.

 Well recently I decided I had had enough, I was tired of living in fear of whatever was living in my house with me, so I decided to set up a camera in the living room, and I posted what I saw [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cJxM4QU8RUuNCTmfe9ThP9w-eV4y_9P37YotSaMciR0/edit?usp=drivesdk)

Reviewing the footage, it was like this black figure created some sort of void and stepped out. It’d do mundane things like sit on my couch and watch tv, or admire my trinkets that I have on my shelf. Sometimes it’d go off from where I could see it and it’d come back with a plate full of food. At one point I noticed it headed in the direction of my bedroom. I hadn’t noticed anything weird when I slept that night so I decided to hatch a plan.

 I decided that I’d take something to keep me up, pretend to sleep, then catch the entity in the act to see whatever he was doing. I put my plan into action the next day and laid comfortably in my bed, eyes closed and waited. Soon enough I heard noises coming from the rest of the house, it must have started its nightly ritual. I waited an hour, then another, and another until finally my bedroom door creaked open. I didn’t dare open my eyes as I heard its footsteps approaching until they stopped right next to my bed. It sniffed, and it sounded like a dog's sniff but garbled. SNIFF SNIFF SNIFF. It then put its icy damp hand on my forehead. “Please sleep… I want dessert.” It said, but not physically. It was as if it was speaking through my thoughts.

 At that point I freaked out and opened my eyes, all I could see was the glow of its piercing white eyes and I noticed that it had no mouth, or at least I think it didn’t. As soon as I caught a small glimpse of it it ran out of my room, its long arms flapping back and forth low to the ground like how an ape would run if it was only using its hind legs. But this wasn’t an ape, it was a long slender man made of shadows.
 I’ve been monitoring my situation the past few days after the incident, and the entity seemed more scared of me than I was scared of him. I decided to leave him a note asking that he put things back the way it was before it messed with them and for the most part it seems like it’s been working. The camera is still catching it in the act but it seems to have listened to my note.
