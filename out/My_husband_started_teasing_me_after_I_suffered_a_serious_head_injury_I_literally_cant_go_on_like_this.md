Back before my head injury, my husband and I had this cheesy ritual. If I ever got held up late at the office and needed to catch the last train home, he’d wait for me at the station and ‘accidentally’ brush against me as I disembarked at the platform. He’d put on a bashful voice, acting like we were meeting for the first time, and say, “I’m sorry I bumped into you ma’am, it’s just you've the most distracting green eyes. Could I maybe walk you home?”

And every damn time, it made me melt like butter in a hot pan. (Yes I know I’m lame.)

But one night, the platform was empty when those automatic doors hissed shut behind me. My stomach lurched. Exiting the station, a concrete set of stairs spat you out into a long, filthy, poorly-lit underground tunnel, and this was the *real* reason for Darren and I’s ‘tradition’—because neither of us liked the idea of me walking home by myself.

As my calls went unanswered, I stood there, my leg bouncing up and down. Lampposts flicked on beyond the iron fence surrounding the station and the sky grew darker until, finally, I saw no choice other than to set off as quickly as I could.

Inside the underpass, sputtering halogen bulbs were spaced out every ten metres or so. I half-walked half-jogged from one flickering pool of light to the next, inhaling through my mouth to avoid the combined stink of a thousand relieved bladders.

Halfway along, a rapid skitter of footsteps rushed up behind me. I spun around. My chest collided with something solid, then two hands shot out and grabbed me by the wrists. In the dim light, I could make out dark hair and a set of deep, blue eyes. I heaved a giant sigh of relief. “Darren.”

“Darling,” the man answered. Altogether, the hairs along my arms and neck stood on end. It wasn’t my husband.

My brain went into full-blown panic mode, which means the rest of the encounter is still a giant blur, but I know I lashed out with punches and kicks. My fingernails raked the man’s left eye and gouged his nose. He kept yelling something, but it was impossible to hear beneath my screams bouncing off the walls. At one point I bit down on his hand, hard, and his skin’s rough texture is the part clearest in my mind.

After that, there are images of me lying in a gathering pool of blood while the man apologizes, and if I *really* squint my memory, there’s confused glimpses of sharp teeth intermixed with a haze of darkness. From there, everything jump cuts to a ring of empty faces towering over me.

Those faces were like the expressionless mannequins you see in shop windows. With my heart in my throat, I thrashed around in a soft bed, screaming until the ‘mannequins’ rushed to restrain me. Then I rode off into a wave of blackness.

Next time the world slid into focus, a single mannequin was beside my bed, dressed in a nurse’s uniform. A soft, disembodied voice came floating along, promising everything would be okay. From somewhere close by, the continuous *beep beep beep* of a heart monitor gathered speed, and, gradually, I realized I was in a hospital.

I swallowed a lump and asked the nurse what happened to her face. The voice asked what I meant. I said the nurse’s skull looked as if when God designed her He’d loaded up Photoshop and gone crazy with the smudge tool. It was a smooth mound of pink flesh.

The faceless nurse explained I’d suffered a serious head injury, and showered me with kindness and support while a series of torches got shone in my eyes and my vitals got checked a dozen or so times. The voice kept telling me not to move around too much, otherwise the stitches across the top of my head might have popped loose.

Another figure with an empty skull—this one dressed in a doctor’s coat—came and stood at the foot of my bed, and that’s when I first heard the term prosospagnosia, also known as face blindness. The condition can result from a traumatic brain injury. What followed was a flurry of activity. Darren, who I only recognised by his haircut and voice, was allowed to sit with me. I squeezed his hand throughout the onslaught of tears and endless visits from neurologists.

On his way to the station the night of the attack, Darren had seen a newly licensed teen driver slam on their brakes way too late to stop at a red light. An old lady got sent careening into the air, and Darren called for an ambulance while he applied pressure to the poor woman’s chest to keep her from bleeding out. That was the reason he missed my calls.

A woman named Tracey and her German Shepherd, Buster, were drawn to the tunnel by my screams. Tracey sicked Buster on my attacker, who bolted off in the direction of the station, covered in my blood.

Both Tracey and Buster visited me at the hospital, and we posed for a photo which made the front page of the local newspaper. The story about a ‘hero dog’ included a blurb about my condition, even though we specifically asked the reporter not to include it.

Two police officers, who I could only distinguish by their difference in height, questioned me about my attacker. Judging by their irritated voices, they’d hoped to learn more than ‘his hair looked sorta like Darren’s’.

Although it took days of interrogation, I convinced Darren to reveal what else authorities knew about the man. It turned out, after Buster chased him to the platform, the bastard took off running along the curved track. Tracey called the police who went after him, flashlights in hand, but only discovered a discarded backpack a quarter-mile north. So far as anybody could tell, my attacker dropped it climbing a fence to escape into the loading bay of a warehouse. Inside the pack they found creepshots of me, along with journal entries and love letters filled with strange details about our supposed ‘relationship’. The officers said he might have been stalking me for as long as half-a-year, living out a fantasy in which we were husband and wife. Their promises they’d have him in custody soon rang a little hollow.

In the weeks I spent confined to the ward, I got a crash course in how difficult life with prosospagnosia really is. Dressed in their identical hospital gowns, my fellow patients were impossible to tell apart unless they had a unique feature, like green nail polish, and I suffered a mild panic attack every time somebody in my inner-circle changed their hairstyle or bought a new outfit. After a whirlwind of scans and tests, the doctors suggested I should consult a specialist, although I could tell they hadn’t much faith I would ever recover. Good thing I never wanted to be a police sketch artist…

Because some of the creep shots were taken from the back garden, Darren and I moved to a new house on the opposite side of town. Anytime I caught a glimpse of my reflection my pulse launched into the stratosphere, so I insisted we not keep any mirrors.

Early one morning, a fortnight later, a stranger with a profile matching my attacker’s knocked on the front door. I’d already grabbed a vase that sat on a nearby side table when, in a silly voice, Darren said he was sorry to bother me, but that I had the most beautiful eyes he’d ever seen and presented me with a bouquet of roses. He was teasing me again. Playing make believe like old times.

Now on the verge of a heart attack, I told him I needed to sit. He apologized a thousand times. I told him it was okay, but that I’d prefer we never did that silly roleplay game ever again. He of course agreed.

In the weeks that followed, my confidence in my ability to read people swelled. Everybody had a ‘tell’, be it a tendency to wear noisy jewellery, or a compulsive habit of scratching their ear. In time, I adapted to this new way of seeing—or not seeing—the world.

Until tonight…

There we were, watching Rick and Morty in the bedroom. I’d never liked cartoons before, but since the diagnosis live-action stuff had become tricky to follow, so I gravitated towards anything with bright colours and distinct patterns.

Afterwards, as I lay facing the wall and scrolling through Reddit, Darren pulled on his navy robe and shuffled off downstairs to use the bathroom. I was still reading the same post when footsteps came marching along the hall.

Straight away my skin prickled. Why? Was it the speed? Or maybe the rhythm? As the door creaked open, I glanced over at Darren, still in his robe. 

By the time he crossed the room and slid in next to me, my spine was slicked with sweat. I could still smell the woody scent of his cologne, so what set off the alarm bells in my mind? 

As an arm reached out and coiled around my stomach, my heart thrashed against my chest. At the corner of my eye, a blank face stared straight at me, silent and unmoving. The way that rough hand probed my stomach and the taste of those foul breaths, it all evoked memories of the tunnel. I rolled toward the wall, suddenly trapped beneath the hot cavern of bedclothes

And that brings us to now.

I can’t tell if I’m being paranoid or if the figure beside me is my stalker posing as my husband. If it *is* my stalker, he must have learned about my condition from the article and is living out his fantasy. I’m afraid what might happen if I run or call the police. I’m not even letting myself think about what happened to Darren.

But it could also be I’m freaking out over nothing, like before. There’s no way to be sure without making it obvious I’m suspicious. So I’m just gonna lie here pretending to browse Reddit until whoever’s beside me’s breaths fall into a slow, rhythmic pattern. Then I’ll slip away as quietly as I can.

So if you don't hear from me again, you'll know my instincts were correct.
