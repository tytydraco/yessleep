Derrick first got the skeleton a couple of years ago. One night while I was brushing my teeth, I gazed out the window. In the light of my motion sensor light, I saw Derrick reaching into the trunk of his car. Out he pulled a large cardboard box with the Spirit Halloween logo on it. I had never seen have a bigger smile, even bigger than the one at his wedding. The next morning while also brushing my teeth, I saw a 12 foot skeleton sitting in Derrick’s front lawn. It stood looking across the street, with its hand in a waving position.

Over the next few years, I saw that skeleton in his yard for a majority of the time. Every time a new holiday would come around on the calendar, the skeleton would be put into a new outfit. Uncle sam hat for 4th of July, santa hat for Christmas, and just plain old skeleton for Halloween. Derrick really loved the skeleton. I would see him quickly rush it inside anytime it was slightly too windy or rainy. Even during the town’s tornado warning scare last year, before retreating to his basement he collected the skeleton outside.

But in October of last year, we got an HOA. I don’t even know who wanted it to be honest. They just showed up one day and made me cut my azaleas because they did not fit my house’s color scheme. From the start nobody really liked them, like all HOAs. One of those people was obviously Derrick. One day while walking past his house I saw Derrick cleaning up the skeleton a bit, so I threw him a wave. Instead of waving back, he came up to me on the sidewalk to talk to me.

“Hey man, I was just wondering if you had my back if I decided to stand up to the HOA? I just read through the rules and they said that I would not be allowed to display Jerry outside of October. I’m planning on keeping him up as a protest.”

“Jerry? Are you talking about the skeleton?”

“Oh yeah, sorry, forgot that’s an inside joke between me and me. So if the HOA shows up and tells me to take it down, could you speak on my behalf in the HOA meeting?”

I felt a little bit pressured. Saying no felt a little bit rude with how much Derrick loved “Jerry” and all. But since the skeleton has always been a joy to see, and since I also hated the HOA, I told him yes. He repeatedly thanked me with his hands together.  So when November 1st rolled around, I was prepared to see Jerry disappear. But I wasn’t prepared for it to happen on November 1st.

I was on my porch, sipping warm black coffee from my Jack Skellington mug. Jerry stood with his fists up, ready to fight any HOA members. Across the street, Justin was stapling Christmas lights to his roof while standing on a ladder. He had headphones in, bobbing his head to what was probably Maria Carrie. In Justin’s yard, was an army of Christmas inflatables. Santas, Reindeer, Grinches, and many others flooded his yard. This made me mildly annoyed.

As I was shaking my head behind Justin’s back, a white SUV pulled in front of Derrick’s house. The door opened and out popped a middle aged woman wearing a sweater vest. It was the HOA president, pretty sure her name was Jasmine or something like that. So Jasmine marched up Derrick path and knocked on his glass screen door. While waiting for an answer, she checked her apple watch for the time, she probably read a time around 8 AM. After a short wait, Derrick opened the door wearing a robe. Derrick opened his mouth to speak, but before he could Jasmine spoke up.

“Yeah Hello, Derrick, I was just wondering if you were aware of what day it was?” She said demeaningly, like she was speaking to a child who had to be taught a lesson.

“Oh uh yeah, pretty sure it’s Saturday.”

“Not that kind of day, the other kind.” She said as she grabbed her nose and shook her head side to side.

“Oh sorry, it would be November 1st, have a good Halloween last night.?”

“No, my kids got all hyper and wouldn’t sleep. But to why I’m here, what is that?” She said as she pointed at the 12 foot skeleton behind her.

“That’s Jerry.” He said while chuckling.

“No, it’s not, it is a violation of the HOA guidelines. No Halloween decorations up outside of October, take it down immediately please.”

“No. I’m not going to do that.” Derrick’s cheerful goofy tone ended, he spoke with a sternness I had not heard from him before.

“Okay well if you’re not then I will and I will be forced to put it in the dumpster and fine you.” She crossed her arms.

“If you do that I will literally call the cops on you, that is theft.”

“Well let’s just see who’s side they are on.”

Once Jasmine finished saying that, she turned around and walked for the skeleton. As she did Derrick pulled out his iPhone and dialed a number and held it to his ear. He then went inside with the phone. Jasmine got up behind Jerry, and put her hands on the pelvis and pushed. Jerry came tumbling over on the grass. When he hit the ground, his skull popped off and rolled to the sidewalk. Jasmine walked to it and it picked it up. As her back was turned, Jerry stood himself up. Jasmine walked over to her SUV, and opened the trunk. As Jasmine was waiting for the trunk to open, Jerry, still headless, walked to her and lightly tapped on her shoulder.

“What do you wa-” She couldn’t finish her sentence, she stood looking directly up at Jerry. Jerry gently pulled his skull out of her hands. Jasmine stood this mouth a gap, stunned, unable to move. I have to say, when I was this I too was rather frightened, but I stayed sitting on my porch to watch what would happen next. Jerry would then grab Jasmine by the neck and lift her off the ground. Jasmine reached for Jerry’s boney hands to free herself. She kicked her legs to assist the escape but Jerry must have had a lot of invisible muscle, for she did not come close to escaping. Jerry then changed his grip on her from her neck to her ankle. She swayed back and forth upside down.

Have you guys ever watched The Avengers? If you have, then you are familiar with the scene where the Hulk grabs Loki and repeatedly slams Loki on the ground. That is what Jerry would do to Jasmine. Over and over on the pavement of the road, Jerry would slam Jasmine with all of his force. Jasmine didn’t make a single sound after the first swing. After a dozen or so swings, Jasmine was dead. Most of her upper body was deformed, and her sweater vest was now soaked in blood.

I sat in silence, in disbelief of what just happened. I always wonder what Derrick’s reaction to that was. Was it like when a parent finds out their kid is a bully in school? Was it like when a parent’s child goes to prison? Or was he proud of what he saw? I really have no clue.

Jerry looked up from Jasmine’s body, and changed his focus across the street. He breathed heavily, then started to walk towards Justin. I could hear Justin faintly singing some Christmas song. I thought of how good those headphones were, to where he couldn’t hear a 12 foot skeleton approach him from behind. I thought about asking him what brand they were. Too bad I wouldn’t get the chance. Once Jerry made it to the ladder, he grabbed the top of it and threw it over. I heard Justin let out a yell before I heard him and the ladder make a thump sound.

I wasn’t actually able to see what happened next, most of it was blocked by Justin’s mini van. But based on the movement of Jerry, Justin was being stomped to death. Justin called out for help, but it was difficult to hear over the roar of inflatables. I saw Justine’s wife quickly glance out the curtains, but after seeing what was out there she promptly shut them. Jerry gave a few more good stomps before stopping. He then turned his attention to the inflatables in the front yard. He tore through all of them. Popping Santa and killing Rudolph. Tearing through the Grinch and unplugging Frosty.

Standing in a pile of now dead Christmas cheer, he changed his attention to me. I could tell he was looking at my Jack Skellington mug. So I said aloud in a shaky voice,

“Sorry, it’s actually a Halloween movie, so if you have some problem with Christmas this is not the place.”

He marched towards me anyway, across the street, through my yard and up to my porch. I tried to quickly stand up and run, but before I could do the running part Jerry grabbed me by the neck and pulled me out from the porch. He started to punch me in the stomach a few times, knocking the air out of me. As he did, I saw a police cruiser down the road, probably the one called by Derrick. I hoped that Jerry didn’t kill me before the cruiser got there. The time it took for the cruiser to drive those few blocks felt like forever. When it finally did get to my block, I saw the nod his head and drive away, while saying to himself,

“Nope, not today.”

I was now on my own, repeatedly getting punched by a 12 foot skeleton. I remembered this was how Houdini died. If Houdini couldn’t survive this, how could I? Then for a second, Jerry stopped punching me. For a second I thought he was letting me go, but then I was lifted over his head and flung across the street. I flew over Justin’s car and landed on the fallen ladder. After hitting the ground, it took me a second to understand what was around me. But after a few deep breaths that went away. The first thing I saw was Justin’s body. Oh yeah, he was stomped to death. The first thing I heard was music coming from 2 places. The first was from Justin headphones in the grass, they were playing Jingle Bell Rock. The second was from a caroling mini van coming down the road towards me.

I saw Jerry walking towards me, before he could pick me up again, I snatched Justin’s headphones. Oh their Beats brand. Jerry then picked me up by the skull, he placed my head in between his two massive hands. He started to squeeze. I could feel the pressure in my head building up, my eyes starting to pop out of socket. But before my head could be crushed like a jack-o-lantern on November 1st. I slid the headphones over Jerry's ears. He immediately dropped me. Jerry fell backwards on top of a popped Santa. He started to shake, his bones clacking together like a xylophone. The mini van was 1 block away.

I quickly think of something cool to say while I would end Jerry’s life. It had to be something sort of relevant to Christmas or Halloween. Then I thought of something.

“This is what you have to understand Jerry. Christmas, that’s in 54 days. But Halloween, that’s in 364. So whether you like it or not, it's Merry freakin’ Christmas.”

As I finished the coolest thing I ever said, I pulled my foot back and launched it forward and planted it in Jerry’s chin. His head launched off like a firework. Flying off into the street and perfectly underneath the front wheel of the caroling mini van. Without any difficulties, Jerry’s skull was crushed. The family stopped singing Jingle Bells to ask what they had just hit. I looked down, the skeleton had stopped shaking and laid still and the ground. I kicked at his ribs, he didn’t move.

I walked across the street and knocked on Derrick’s door to tell him what happened. When he opened he already had tears in his eyes. He didn’t even cry at his wedding, I thought. Before I could say anything, Derrick ran across the street and held Jerry in his arms. I went inside my own house and called the police. Not sure who will go to prison for this one, case still hasn’t happened yet. Probably a bit hard to make sense of it all. Me and Derrick have talked and we have no clue what causes Jerry to all of a sudden come alive like that. But now, if you were to drive around our neighborhood you will not see any 12 foot skeletons named Jerry. Instead, you will see a flag pole in Derrick’s front yard. Forever flying a skull and crossbones. With a small plaque at the bottom, that reads.

“IN MEMORY OF THE ONE AND ONLY JERRY.”
