There was this kid in my neighborhood called Ricky, and everyone hated him.

I mean, it was kind of obvious. From his appearance right down to his personality and interests. He had what they called a ‘baby face’, fat and round like a tomato, with baby blue eyes, freckles and a mess of blonde hair that flopped over his face.

I also never saw him below 120 pounds. He didn’t *walk*—he *waddled*—like a penguin who never quite figured out how to swim. Ricky never went around without his sketchbook, and he tried to make himself as small as possible, like that would help him at all.

Of course, it didn’t. Ricky was a walking recipe for ridicule. He couldn’t walk one step without someone throwing something at him. He endured classes with laughter crashing around him. I heard he didn’t have it easy at home either, or with any of the adults, and it showed with the bruises on his arms and legs and shoulders and the way he walked, dragging his feet like a deflated balloon.

I am sorry to say that I once participated in bullying Ricky. It was a necessity ritual in the school’s pecking order: do it or be bullied yourself. Eat or be eaten. That was how it worked.

I felt really bad for doing it too. There were times when I really enjoyed it, to be brutally honest—he was just a walking punching bag—a perfect way to get out my stress, but the more I saw Ricky, the heavier my heart weighed with guilt.

So on the last day of school, I cornered Ricky in the boy’s bathroom, and without looking directly at him, handed him a pack of markers I had just bought from the arts shop.

I quickly walked away then, not stopping to see how Ricky reacted to my impromptu gift. If my friends saw what I had just done, I would be dead meat for the rest of my life. But I think Ricky liked it. His small, fat frame straightened out, and his chest puffed out with hope. It was like he had come alive, like a flower just learning how to bloom.

I deliberately avoided Ricky the rest of the day, snickering about him to my friends, but when I got home from school, I found the purple marker in my mailbox with a grateful letter of thanks wrapped around it in sloppy handwriting.

I wondered how Ricky knew purple was my favourite colour.

The next time I saw Ricky with his markers was only a few hours later. The boys were over at my place and after playing board games we got bored and decided to get ice cream. It was a nice afternoon, and a cool breeze ruffled our hair.

And there he was, holding his sketchbook and the markers I gave him, squatting next to a drain.

He was still in his school clothes, though it was hard to tell now since it was smeared with grime and filth. He also stank and everyone pinched their noses.

“Hey Stinky Ricky!” Joe yelled.

In normal cases that would’ve caught Ricky’s attention. But Ricky was so distracted that he did not acknowledge us. 

I wondered who Ricky was talking to, and then I realised he was talking to the sewer drain. The manhole was open, the cover slanted to the side. Black smoke was rising rapidly into the air, like somebody was burning a fire inside. A murky stream trailed off into the distance.

“Ricky?”

Nothing. Ricky’s eyes were glazed over.

“Ricky!”

I didn’t even know what else to say to get his attention. Alarm bells were blaring in my head.

“Ricky! Watch out!”

Beau and Joe were staring at me in shock. I knew I was going to get flak for it later, but if it meant saving him, it would be worth it.

Ricky looked up.

He smiled at me in a way that chilled me to the bone.

Then he jumped.

I couldn’t even hear the body hit the water.

There was silence for a while, as all three of us stared into the sewer drain. It was impossible to tell how deep it might have gone. We might as well be staring into a bottomless pit.

We weren’t sure what to do then. We thought and thought, debated whether we should tell somebody (would they believe us?) or keep it quiet (would it be our fault?).

We discussed and argued, argued and discussed, all the way home. And it could’ve gone on forever, if it weren’t for Joe’s scream.

“RICKY!”

Beau and I stopped abruptly, and stared at Joe, perplexed. Joe was frozen in the middle of the road. His knees were knocking together and his face was as white as a sheet.

His quivering fingers were pointing to thin air.

“Joe,” I said shakily. That cold sick dread crept once again to my stomach. Although it was now around 3pm, the sky was darkening rapidly; the storm clouds cast a long shadow over our own.

“There’s nothing there.”

Joe snapped his head towards us, his eyes rolling to the back of his head until we could see the whites.

“Don’t you see?” he screamed. “Ricky…he’s here! He’s mad at me!”

His eyes glazed over and that cold shiver slowly crept up my spine. I recognised that look. It was the same one Ricky gave me.

Before he jumped.

“He calls me,” Joe muttered. He was rambling like a maniac. He looked past us and to the sewer drain.

“I…I’m sorry, Ricky.”

Before either of us could stop him he was lumbering back to the sewer drain. But he didn’t have to go far. The water slid away from the drain like a serpent and pooled around his legs.

Which slowly and surely, sucked him in.

Joe screamed again. Not Ricky’s name, but something else. Primal. Desperate.

For a minute we were frozen. Beau and I stared at each other.

And then, as if we reached some unsaid agreement we ran over and tried to pull him out.

It was hopeless, however. Like trying to hold water. Joe gurgled, as the oil-like substance slipped into his mouth, his lungs. He was waving his arms like he was drowning.

Then finally, the last of his arm slipped from our grasp and he was pulled under. The water dissipated, leaving behind a patch of dry concrete.

The sun began to shine.

Again we had no idea what to do. We knew Joe was gone, the same way Ricky was a few minutes earlier. We looked back at our neighborhood, a cold dread settling into our hearts.

My thoughts raced. I reached for my phone.

My vision blurred as I dialled mechanically.

“911, what is your emergency?”

I opened my mouth to speak, but the words were stuck in my throat.

“Hello?”

What should I say? That I just saw two boys taken by the sewers?

“Hello? Hello?”

I shook my head and hung up. Beau looked forlornly at me.

“Let’s go home,” he said. He was taking this better than I was. I was grateful for that.

This time nobody talked. We just plodded home, eyes on the road. We did notice the sky though, the way the clouds furrowed its brows like a grumpy old man. That little patch of sunshine was brief, like an omen that was to come.

At some point the concrete turned into mush and mud, and oily water rushed over our shoes and closed around our ankles. I looked down and found we were knee-deep in the water, which gurgled and roared and thrashed against the walls of the houses. Through the murk I could see that every sewer drain was open and every manhole cover had disappeared, and it coughed out more and more water that seemed to slowly rise.

I swallowed and felt the lump slide down into my stomach and sit there, ice-cold.

This wasn’t good.

Then we got to my house, and that cold lump in my stomach slid back out. I turned and vomited into the water.

Ricky’s father was swinging in front of my windows. At first glance it appeared he had hanged himself—I could see a bit of rope looped around his neck and snaking back through the window. But then I looked closer, and I realised someone had hoisted him up there. A long trail of intestine poked out through a hole in the back and disappeared into the gaping darkness behind.

Blood dripped out from his body and blossomed crimson in the water.

I couldn’t take my eyes off it. The body swung, a figment of my nightmares forever. His head bent up and gave me a hideous grin behind dirty blonde hair.

Beau gripped my hand until his knuckles were white. The water slithered around my ankles and crept up to my knees.

I was so busy staring at Ricky’s father  swinging against my house that I realised what was going on, too late.

I only remember a rush of colours as I was pulled under. The little patch of gray sky that grew increasingly smaller. Water rushed into my lungs.

Besides me Beau was screaming Ricky’s name, like Joe before him. In fact, when I closed my eyes I could hear thousands of screams and sobs bursting through my head. Asking for mercy, forgiveness, regretting what they had done to Ricky, again too late.

Under the ground told a different story. The water was all rushing forward in a single direction, carrying bodies along with it. I saw kidneys, hearts, and a long trail of guts. Arms and legs, slightly chewed. Rats scuttled on the walls, occasionally diving into the water to retrieve a meal.

And of course, whole corpses. I shivered when I recognised quite a few of them, including several of my classmates. Adults who I’d known and enjoyed bullying Ricky just as much as us kids.

Swimming against the current was out of the question. The water had a death grip around my torso—literally. Whenever I looked down, I saw it looping ominously around my waist like a seatbelt.

All I could do was stare at the dim shadows and the water crashing against the walls and hope, with my heart in my throat, that Ricky would spare me in some way.

But I personally didn’t think so.

***

I saw the shadow first. It glimmered dimly against the wall, as if illuminated lightly by a candle.

Then I saw a giant arm, as big and long and thick as tree trunks, come swooping down and scooping up Beau next to me. Beau’s screams disappeared in the darkness as he was swallowed whole.

The water crashed onto a bank, forming a makeshift beach. I was deposited onto a bank and the water retreated with a hiss. I groaned with pain, rubbing my head.

Colours clashed and my head spun as I struggled to regain my bearings.

Then I saw everything, and I nearly fainted in fright.

He now towered impossibly above me, and his frame twisted and turned around the dead end. He was warped thin, fuelled by the oily water that wrapped around his body. His skin prickled with stiff hair that poked oddly out like sharp thorns.

His figure warped and twisted and shook, like wisps of smoke off a candle-flame.

But worst of all, I saw Ricky’s face stitched tightly to this *creature*. His blonde hair had disappeared into the watery abyss and his eyes were not what it used to be. But it was Ricky, all right. And Ricky stared down at me and hissed, and then roared so loudly every single hair on my body stood up on end.

Another giant hand bent down and scooped me up, and Ricky brought me so close to his face that I could smell his breath. Anger danced behind the whites of his eyes, lighting them up like fire.

“Wait!” I yelled.

Ricky paused, stared at me and hissed. He waited.

“I gave you the markers, remember?” I was blabbering like an idiot, and I was pretty sure I peed in my pants. My palms were sweating. I wasn’t really sure if Ricky was going to believe me, but it was my only hope.

I pulled out the purple marker from my pocket and pressed it into his palm. The only sign of friendship I had ever given him.

“Please…” I sobbed. God, I was crying. I had never thought I would be at Stinky Ricky’s mercy, but I hoped that I could find some compassion, some forgiveness, in the monster he was now.

As cheesy as it sounded.

“I’ll do anything for you! I’ll be your friend!”

I gave him a weak smile. 

“Just like you always wanted…”

Ricky seemed to consider it. The water turned the marker over in his palm.

**TWELVE YEARS…**

He thought it over again, then frowned down at me. Tears welled in his eyes.

**“Y-you really mean it??”**

I nodded so eagerly my head nearly fell off.

**“All right then,”** Ricky finally decided, and my heart sank in relief.

**“But…”**

My heart froze up again. *What?*

**“You have to do something for me.”**

***

Eleven years.

Eleven years since I saw Ricky speak to a sewer. Eleven years since I was nearly eaten alive.

Eleven years since Ricky washed me up in this city far away from home. It wasn’t easy getting a job and trying to live on your own when you’re just sixteen, but somehow I managed. Especially when I couldn’t get the smell of the sewer out of my clothes.

I have been busy paying off my debt ever since, or at least, that’s what I have decided to call it. I’m pretty sure it mostly means–to Ricky at least–that I really mean what I said. That I genuinely wanted to be Ricky’s friend.

To him it also mainly meant buying him gifts and talking to the sewers. I feel stupid doing it. I pray every day my colleagues don’t catch me red-handed doing it. I will be a laughing-stock for sure. Yet, if I forget to pay him a visit every day, Ricky sends me a timely reminder. My walls, splashed with blood, or a nice bit of intestine or spleen or kidney hanging out on my pillow. Two days of absence means someone close to me in this city dies. He personally makes me watch them jump into the sewer.

I have never missed a visit to the sewer three days in a row.

This is the last year, I think. The last year when I have to prove my worth and my friendship to him. I’m not sure what I am going to do after that. I am more than keen to put my past with Ricky away and start anew, but I don’t think Ricky will let me. Not to mention at times I actually *look forward* heading down there to talk to him.

But for now I have one year of debt left.

One more year.
