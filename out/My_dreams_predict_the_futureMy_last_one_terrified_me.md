Ever since I was a child,I have always had weird dreams.Lots of dreams.Dreams from where I failed a test to a friendship breakup with my best friend.


At first,I didnt think much of it .But I did notice some weird things.As mentioned before,I dreamt that I had failed a test and the next day,I actually did.Dreams predicting the future is common.Its normal.Thats what everyone said.And for some time,I believed them.Until now.

Before I talk about the most recent dream,a little backstory:Every.single.dream that I had (including nightmares)has come true.With the exact details,the exact conversations said .Every single detail on point.

A few months ago,I had a dream that my best friend cut me off.3 days later it happened.

I had a dream where a boy in my class admitted to having a crush on me.A week later it happened.

Every.single.dream.

Of course I though this was weird,but nothing really affected me till the dream I had yesterday.

The dream was short. Terrifyingly short.I was walking ,I dont know where from,and a masked man kidnapped me.And then slit my throat.Before he did that,though,he said exactly the following: "Maybe if you werent cursed this wouldnt have happened"

I didnt sleep after I had this dream.How could I?But what stuck with me was the word "cursed".What do you mean cursed?I was cursed to predict the future from my dreams?What did I do wrong?Who cursed me and why?

My family is completely normal.Im a nice person.I like to believe Im a nice person.

Who would put a curse on me?That I dont  know.But what I do know is that I am unlucky.And I don't know why.Palm readers have refused to read my hand, whenever I go to a church the priests look at me weird.

A person has told me that I look like the Devil.I dont think I look like the devil.

I am unlucky,but I though that was just random.I dont know what I have done to deserve this,and maybe I dont.

Maybe someone wants me dead.

Maybe that someone is the friend I cut off.

Or maybe a boy I rejected.

Or maybe that lady that told me I looked like the devil.

Or maybe the priests that looked at me weird all my life.

Or maybe the children I beat at the spelling bee competition.Or maybe their parents.

Maybe my bullies that hate every part of me.

Or maybe Im just overthinking.Just a typical nightmare right?

Wrong.

There's nothing typical about dreams.At least mine.Especially mine.

How can I uncurse myself before its too late?


Or maybe it is too late.

Is it too late?

I dont wanna die.

Please.Not now,please.What have I done to deserve this?

Maybe fate just hates me.Maybe God does.Or maybe someone just hates me so much they would be willing to put a curse on me.So much that they want me dead.

I can't sleep.I cannot.

Is it too late?

Please tell me its not too late.

Its not too late to uncurse me right?

Right?
