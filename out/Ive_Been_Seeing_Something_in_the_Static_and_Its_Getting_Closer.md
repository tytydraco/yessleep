It started the night after they took Mr. Harlow’s body away.

The coroner said he’d been dead for weeks, but that didn’t make sense. I’d seen him just days before—standing in his yard, watering a patch of dirt where his lawn used to be. He wasn’t moving right, though. His head was tilted, like he was listening to something only he could hear.

I waved, but he didn’t wave back. He just stood there, lips moving, whispering words I couldn’t hear. When the coroner finally took him out, his TV was still on, playing static.

That’s when it started.

It’s not like I knew Mr. Harlow well, but I’d heard stories. The kind of stories you dismiss as small-town gossip. They said his wife left him years ago, and that after she disappeared, he stopped leaving his house. Some people swore she didn’t leave at all, that she was still in there somewhere. Buried under the floorboards.

A few kids in the neighborhood used to dare each other to knock on his door, claiming he had cameras everywhere, that he watched everyone through his old TV. They said sometimes, late at night, you could see his windows flicker with blue light, even though the house was supposed to be empty.

I always figured it was just kids being kids. But now, I’m not so sure.

The first time I heard the noise, it was faint—a low hum, like a badly tuned radio bleeding through the walls. I figured it was just old wiring or maybe interference from a neighbor’s TV. But as the night dragged on, it got louder. I turned off my own TV, but the sound didn’t stop. It seemed to be coming from the walls themselves, vibrating through the floor, the pipes, the air.

I lay awake, staring at the ceiling, when I realized something: the noise wasn’t random. It had a pattern. A rhythm.

It was breathing.

The next night, the static came back, louder this time. I woke at 3:14 a.m. to the sound of my TV flickering to life on its own. At first, it was just noise—crackling, hissing—but then I saw it.

Something moved in the static.

A shape. Tall and thin, with limbs too long and a head that hung at a strange, broken angle. It didn’t seem human, not exactly. Its body was jagged, like it was made of glitches in the screen, pixels snapping and breaking apart.

Then it turned toward me.

It didn’t have a face—just pale, smooth skin stretched tight over its skull. But where its eyes should have been, there were deep, empty hollows, blacker than anything I’ve ever seen. They weren’t just holes; they were voids, and when I looked into them, I felt something looking back.

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe.

And then the screen went dark.

The next day, I smashed my TV. I thought that would help. But it didn’t.

When I was dragging the broken TV to the curb, Mrs. Keller from three doors down stopped me. She didn’t ask why I was throwing it out. She just stared at the screen for a long time, her face pale, and said, “Harlow always said they’d follow him. He said the static would bring them through.”

I asked her what she meant, but she just shook her head and hurried back inside, locking the door behind her.

The static followed me that night.

It wasn’t just my TV anymore. It was my phone, my computer, even my watch. Every screen showed the same thing: static, alive and shifting, with that figure somewhere inside it. It wasn’t always clear. Sometimes it was in the background, blurry and faint. Other times, it was close, so close I could see the faint ridges of its skin, the trembling, hungry edges of its hollow eyes.

Two nights ago, it stepped out of the screen.

I woke up to find it standing at the foot of my bed. It didn’t move. It didn’t speak. It just tilted its head, as if it were trying to understand me. The room was so quiet I could hear my own heartbeat, but I swear I felt it breathing, cold and damp, brushing against my skin.

I couldn’t scream.

It leaned closer, its head jerking in sharp, unnatural angles, until it was inches from my face. Its mouth opened—slowly, impossibly wide—and for the first time, I heard it speak.

Not words. Just static, crackling and alive, pouring from that gaping hole.

When the sun came up, it was gone.

That was two nights ago. I haven’t slept since.

I started doing some digging, trying to figure out what’s happening. I found an old forum post from six years ago—someone claiming to hear static in their walls after their neighbor died. The post ended abruptly, mid-sentence. I clicked on their profile, but it was gone, erased.

Then I found another one. This time, the post wasn’t about static—it was about Mr. Harlow. Someone claiming he used to work at a broadcast station. They said he was fired for something he’d been airing late at night. “Unauthorized transmissions,” they called it. The station shut down years ago, but the building’s still there.

I want to go, but I can’t. I’m too scared.

It’s not just in the screens anymore. It’s in the mirrors, the shadows, the reflections in puddles. I see its shape everywhere—in the corner of my eye, in the shimmer of glass. And it’s not just watching me.

It’s watching you, too.

Yes, you.

I know you’ve heard it. That faint buzz from your TV when you think it’s off. The crackle in your phone when the signal drops. The flicker of a screen in the corner of your vision. You’ve brushed it off, convinced yourself it’s nothing, just interference or a glitch.

But it’s not.

Do you remember the last time your screen flickered, just for a second? Do you remember the last time you thought you saw movement in a reflection, but when you turned, nothing was there? That wasn’t your imagination.

It’s been watching you, just like it watched me.

The Static Man doesn’t just want to be seen. He wants to know you. He’s listening through the hum of your electronics, whispering through the static you ignore. And the more you notice him, the closer he gets.

Last night, I realized something.

The static—it’s not random. It’s a signal. A transmission. I don’t know where it’s coming from, but I know what it’s saying now. I can’t unhear it.

“Look closer.”

That’s all it says, over and over.

I think I know what it means. The more I look at him, the more I feel myself unraveling. He’s not just in the static anymore. He’s in me. And soon, he’ll be in you.

If you’re reading this, it’s already too late.

Don’t turn off your screen. Don’t close your laptop. Don’t check your phone.

And whatever you do, don’t look too long.

Because once you see him, he sees you.
