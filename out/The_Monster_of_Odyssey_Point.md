I had a dream where I cut my hand on a sea shell.

I've lived in this small fishing village on the coast of Maine all my life. All that time, I've just dreamed of being anywhere else. Somewhere warm, somewhere dry, somewhere the sun comes to visit once a day like it's supposed to. Instead it looks like my lot is here, with the constant storms and the inescapable smell and taste of fish. More than college, more than the idea of a better life anywhere else, the thing I think I wanted more than anything in the world was a girlfriend. Someone to talk to, someone to share bored thoughts with. That's when I saw her.

At the corner of the classroom I never looked back to, was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen in my life. She had curly, golden blonde hair that looked like it'd shimmer in the sun like white sand. She had a cute round face and cheeks that turned pink when she smiled. But the most striking part of her was her eyes. Never in my life had I ever imagined someone could have eyes so blue, like the clearest sky you've ever seen. But she did. If it's true what they say that the eyes are the windows to the soul, hers was perfect. And she was looking at me. And she smiled.

It's funny just how quickly you can forget everything else in the world because of something like that. A look and a smile and all my attention was hers. I was literally standing at the front of the class, I must've been giving a book report or something, I can't even remember what. All I know is I must've been standing up there like an idiot for some time because I started to hear the other kids laughing at something and the teacher told me, pretty aggressively, to sit back down. She must've told me so multiple times because only once that girl, that gorgeous girl, finally looked away with a bashful grin, I snapped back, and heard that now my teacher was yelling at me. Who was this girl?

I sat near the front of the class and there was no subtle way for me to look back at her. Even when I did, she was obscured by a sea of confused, annoyed, awkward classmates. I had never seen her before, how had I never seen her? What was her name, where in the world did she come from? What was I doing that made her smile? God, she had the sweetest smile. I couldn't get her out of my head for all the rest of class, and I was the first out of my seat when the bell rang, looking through everyone else for wherever she was. Nowhere.

I walked out into the hall where everyone else let out for lunch. Nowhere. Then when I sat down for lunch at the corner of a long table over a plate of -- you guessed it -- fish, after looking in every nook and cranny in the school, there she was, sitting in her own corner of the table right in front of me. For a split second I saw those eyes again, those shining crystals before she looked away again with a flair of her golden curls. She'd been staring at me. I threw my legs over the cafeteria bench and brought my tray over to hers. I'd never been this forward with any girl I'd liked, but even when she was looking down at her untouched food, I could see her giggling. But I couldn't hear it.

"Hey," I said, sitting down just across from her. "What's your name?"

She stopped and looked up, her smile reduced to a grin. She wore a grey jacket with a blue scarf wrapped and tucked around her neck like a puffy bird. She used two fingers to make a V-shape gesturing to her neck, then making the "cut off" sign. As she did, she voicelessly mouthed the words, "I can't speak."

"You can't speak?" I repeated what I thought she said, almost automatically, not knowing what to say.

She shook her head. Was she deaf? Wouldn't she be in some special school for that?

She nodded, pointing to her ears, then to me. "I can hear you," her lips read, creeping into a smile. Then she waved excitedly, "Hi!"

I didn't know a lot of sign language, just a few that were the most intuitive, some for family, mostly stuff I picked up from movies. The burden of understanding was fully on me still since she could hear me, but with every hand gesture, she silently mouthed the words to me. I imagined what her voice would possibly sound like, and conversation was fairly easy from there. She took a little piece of plastic fruit out of her coat pocket to tell me what her name was. Clementine. She brought her hands closer together almost like she was trying to clap, but her hands never touched. "Smaller, shorten... short for Clementine. Clem. Do you prefer to be called Clem?"

She nodded enthusiastically and I told her what a beautiful name it was, but not before making a complete ass of myself in failing to guess it. "Orange," "Mandarin," "Mandy...?" Please, take me out back and shoot me.

In what was essentially a game of charades for dummies, I learned that she'd only been at the school for a few months, and mostly communicated to teachers and other students through letters on notecards. She didn't have a phone and she didn't have very many friends, which shocked me. I liked to think I was the first guy to come and talk to her, but I'd be kidding myself. I wondered if my parents might've known hers, but when I said "mom," she shook her head. I said I was sorry and didn't press for more.

"What about your dad? What does he do?"

She got a look in her eyes. A grimace. She pointed to a painted portrait of George Washington on the wall of the cafeteria, indicating to me that his name was George. Then she held up one arm, flexing all of her fingers outward, twisting her wrist in an arc. "Lighthouse," I swear I could almost hear it from her.

"He works in the lighthouse?"

The Odyssey Point Lighthouse was the town's only claim to fame. Right at the very tip of the cape where the storms and the tides hit the hardest, miles north of the town proper, where everyone else lived. It must've been over a hundred years old at this point.

"That's so cool!" I said way too loudly.

She shrugged. Something in her whole demeanor soured for a minute. She hunched herself even further over the table and crossed her arms tight around her, even tugging a bit at her scarf. I don't think she liked it at home. "Do you get the chance to get out at all?"

She shook her head.

"Oh. I'm sorry. Is he really strict?"

She looked up with heavy eyes and nodded slowly. I had no idea what to say. I felt the air itself change around the words as they came out of my mouth, and I was afraid I'd just blown my chances with his girl completely. But like that, her eyes lit up again. She reached over the table and gave my shoulder a friendly shove. That got my attention. She gestured to me, eyes widening, palms up and out, like she was asking for something. She pointed to me.

"Me?"

Yes.

"What about me?"

Then she glared, her head lobbed to the side and her hair bounced. I think if she could speak, she'd ask, "What ABOUT you, dingus?"

She was giving me so many chances, I couldn't believe it. I told her a little about my home life, my favorite classes, what I liked to do to keep my sanity -- I mean, "pass the time" -- in this Podunk town, my favorite theater out in the town where one of my friends works and sneaks the rest of us in for free. I told her I played offensive line on the football team and hoped to get into college on an athletic scholarship if my grades weren't enough. Even she looked surprised by that.

"Yeah, don't let the glasses fool you. Four-Eyes can play sports too. I have contacts but just for that. Ever since I heard how my grandma went blind -- she fell asleep with hers in and when she couldn't see in the morning, she tried getting them out herself instead of going to a doctor. Yeah, I prefer glasses."

Maybe I could've avoided telling her that. Shockingly, she didn't seemed phased. Didn't react at all to that really, she just pointed to me with her left hand, raising and lowering her right like a measuring tape, mouthing the words, "How tall are you?"

Oh boy, here's the moment of truth. Do or die. "How tall am I? Six foot, even. Six-two in my running shoes."

She used her index and middle finger to run across the tabletop, "Do you run?"

"Yeah I love to run! Whenever I can. Do you?"

She stared at me for a few seconds, pursing her lips. It's like she was holding in a laugh. That's when she looked over and reached down to the bench beside her, pulling up the top part of a crutch. I buried my face so hard in my hands, I think my head disappeared. "Oh God... I'm so sorry!"

My shameful arms were opened up by her prying them apart, and I was met directly by her angel eyes and her bright-as-day smile. "It's okay," I could almost hear her say.

She paused, her hands still on my forearms. I swear I could feel her, feeling over my sleeves. Was this really happening? When she let go, she crossed her hands over her chest, and made the "V" sign over her neck, mouthing, "I love your voice."

My. God. This was happening. She was so into me, I couldn't believe it. And then I asked the next question.

"Hey Clem? Do you have... a boyfriend?"

And like an overstepping parent, the bell rang to signal the end of lunch period. Neither of us had touched our fish and my question hung in the air like my head under a guillotine. To have come so far so fast, just to fumble at the one-yard line... she knew exactly what she was doing. She swiveled herself to the other side of her bench with just her hands, picked up her crutches and pushed herself upright. What I thought was her leaning over her lunch tray appeared to be an actual hunch in her back, probably from having to walk so long on them. She looked right at me, grinning. She shook her head. I was so in.

"Cool."

English Lit was my favorite class now. The only one I shared with Clem, and always right before lunch every day. Every day for a week, it was impossible to get her out of my head, and hers was always the last face I'd imagined before going to sleep at night. When we'd walk down the hall together, it was almost like I was her bodyguard. She was such a tiny little thing, and I was built like a brick house. I really felt like she trusted me, wanted to be around me. I liked that.

There was nothing I loved more than talking to her, even if I was doing all of the talking. She'd tell me what she could, but she'd get this look on her face whenever I'd go on and on for minutes on end about favorite movies or books or pass times, all of which I said I'd love to share with her. I'd tell her how much I'd love to see her at one of my games sometime. She'd always just nod, and sigh, and stare and smile. It's like she really liked listening to me. I just wish I could've listened to her voice too.

Ironically, there was a lot it seemed she didn't like to talk about anyway. Her crutches, her muteness, her parents, the lighthouse. Whenever I'd ask or start to ask about any of those things, she'd just shrug or look down or shake her head. She seemed really closed off, even for a town like this. Like the only two places she'd ever gone was school and back home. So many times I'd mentioned the things I'd love to do together, the places to go, and that seemed to make her happy, even if she'd always look down and shake her head and sign, "Lighthouse."

She says she doesn't like it there, that she's never allowed anywhere else than school; that she isn't allowed to have anyone visit, and that she doesn't even have any real friends at school to bring over. She says everyone's uneasy around her and treats her weird. Everyone but me. At the end of every day for two whole weeks, I'd wait with her on a bench outside the school for her dad to pick her up. I swear that old garbage car gave way every time that man stepped out of it. 6'4" at the very least, stocky, and bearded like he'd spent six months at sea. And always glaring daggers at me near his daughter.

Those first few days, I'd wave and say hi, but he'd just wave her over, opening the passenger door for her. And the way she'd sullenly trudge over to that truck on her broken legs with her head hanging down... the way she'd go limp like a ragdoll when he lifted her with no effort at all into the seat... the way she'd look back at me through the car window. Her eyes always turned from bright blue as the sky, to the kind of cloudy gray you'd see before a hurricane. Something was very wrong, but she could never tell me what.

It was a Wednesday. Class was let out early for the mother of all tropical storms headed our way. Same as always, I was waiting outside with Clementine for her dad. Something was different, but I had no idea what. She was serious, she'd barely looked at me all day, even if the day was only half over. When it started to pour, I looked over to my car and asked her, "Would you go somewhere with me?"

And her head snapped over to face me with such an intense glare I'd never seen before. The storm behind her eyes brewing at full force, telling me, "No."

But it wasn't just anger or annoyance in her expression. There was something else, underneath it all. Something I knew was fear. The rain came harder and the truck pulled up. She looked back at it, white-knuckling her crutches, the fringes of her hair was damp and matted against the shoulders of her shirt, and she ran her fingers against the top of her blue scarf. The door to the truck opened and her father stepped out. I couldn't take it anymore and I grabbed her by the shoulders to face me, "Clementine, please tell me what's wrong!"

She breathed so heavily, searching my eyes for something. With her arms, she leapt up to my shoulders, tackling me into a hug. Her head reached onto my shoulder and her legs and crutches dangled off the wet ground. I could hear her sobbing over the pattering raindrops. I couldn't help but hug her back. Then I heard her dad yelling, "Boy! Take your hands off my little girl!"

Her arms gripped tighter like a vice around my back as she clung to me, the rain pouring down us both. Then, I felt a warm breath of air ghost against my ear, and a pained, raspy voice whisper:

"*Follow* *me* *home*."

It echoed in my mind and I could barely believe I heard it at all. No, I couldn't have, she was mute! Wasn't she? Why would she lie about that? It didn't even sound like a young girl's voice, what was it? No, it did, but it also sounded like how sandpaper feels across your palms. It sounded like a girl, and a woman, and the death rattle of an old crone all at the same time. It reverberated and fed back like 3 or 4 women speaking the same three words half-a-second apart from each other. How was that possible? What was that?! And what was at home?

I was stunned as she climbed off me, adjusting herself in her crutches. Then she coughed, hard and heavy into her scarf. I could see drops of blood drooling from the corners of her lips and she wiped it with her sleeve, that look of seriousness never leaving her eyes. Suddenly, the massive form of her father came between us, pointing a finger the size of a sausage in my face and commanding in a low, gravelly voice, "Keep your hands off my daughter, you little shit."

"Sir, I think she's bleeding."

He looked over the shoulder of his fisherman's coat to her, waiting passively by her closed car door, then back at me. "You stay the fuck away from her, you hear?"

He wasted no time getting into his truck and driving off, so neither did I. Even under the darkened sky and through the train of cars and trucks filing out of the lot, I kept my eyes locked on his. The rusted red paint, the empty bed, the rattling tires, the license plate "336-SRN." Through stoplights and intersections, I almost lost that bucket of bolts so many times, until I'd see that browning red, that plate turning down a parallel side street. The radio was blaring a song I don't remember and my phone was buzzing in the passenger seat. 336-SRN, red, rusted. Within 30 minutes, it was just him and me on a long, winding road.

I turned off my headlights before that so he couldn't see me, following the red of his taillights into the dark. The wind and the rain came harder, and the lightning flashed so frequently I never truly lost sight of the road, even when those two red lights got closer together to one in the middle-distance. The sea wind rocked my car like a baby's cradle and cold air blew from the AC, chilling my damp clothes, and my eyes never left those red lights. It was a red-eyed monster in the dark, slithering along the coast, with my Clementine in its jaws.

Before I knew it, the road was running out, and those red eyes had stopped fading into the distance. They'd stopped a ways in front of me. And blinked away. Alongside the lightning, the horizon slowly and rhythmically lit up with a bright yellow light like a second sun, swiveling, emanating from a single point in the distance. Odyssey Point.

I pulled off the road away from the sheer cliffside to the right of me. I couldn't let him see me, and I could walk the rest of the way. The only way was forward, illuminated by the distant signal. I ran, my shoes soaking with rain water, adding weight to my steps. But it didn't slow me down. The entire way, there was only Clem's words echoing in my mind. "*Follow. Follow me. Follow me home.*"

There was a gurgling sound to it that I couldn't purge. And the blood that came from her mouth just from speaking three words... what was he doing to her? How could he do that? I tried to answer my questions for myself, but I couldn't. In time, I hoped I could, but right now that didn't matter. All that mattered now was the lighthouse. I took solace in knowing there was nowhere else for him to go.

I found his pickup parked on the edge of the last drivable piece of land before all the ground leading to Odyssey Point was broken up into a heavy rock fault. Nearly a mile stretch of long, flat boulders jutting out of the peninsula made a pathway of step-stones straight to the light. As the fierce golden beam passed overhead, I saw him, stepping the path, her in his arms. And I followed.

With every step, every half-jump onto the rocks, I swear I could almost feel the ground shifting beneath me, like walking onto a pack of ice drifting together by sheer proximity. The rising tide and the unceasing rain made the slanted faces slick with even uneven step I took, praying for balance. I felt my heartbeat pound from my throat to my stomach with every wrong, slippery step from one jagged boulder to the next, then to be rocked by the force of the waves below. The yellow light from the middle-distant tower circled clockwise, shining itself onto the rock path every 15 seconds or so. It glared through my glasses, refracting on the speckles of rain trickling down the lenses. My only light, save for the white flashes before roaring thunderclaps; my only way to really see whether my foot would fall on rock or slip into a crevasse rising with the tide.

I tapped out to find where the edges were, where the next solid surface was, I could start to see the silhouette of the house built on a small grassy isle at the end of this broken land bridge. I could see the towering building that gave the cape it's name. At least it should've. The closer I got to it, the higher and higher the light shined, the less I could believe how tall the lighthouse was. Then the seconds passed, and the light, like some giant cyclops' eye, turned it's gaze back on me, and I saw him.

George's massive frame, even far enough ahead of me, stark black against the blaring lumens, taking wide, confident steps over the rain-slicked rocks. He was as much climbing as he was walking, weathering the heavy rain in front of him and turning his back to brace against every crashing wave that battered his right side... all the while carrying Clementine. I could see her hair clumped together in ropes that dripped with water, he arm hanging limp and hee head slumped on her shoulder. She looked dead as he held her, unmoving even when the thunder and the waves caused me to jolt. What was he doing to her?

"*Follow.*"

I followed. With every light, I'd see the path get shorter, the lighthouse climb higher in the blackened sky, and the distance between me and him got ever so slightly closer. I couldn't believe how close it all seemed. And then I felt it. As I was about to step from one rock to the next, cut in half by a foaming chasm of water, this unbelievably icy cold feeling came into my mind. No, it's like it exploded in shards of icy glass from somewhere in my mind, slicing, ripping through all my thoughts until the only one I could hear was ***DOWN***.

And it's as if all my instincts shocked me into thinking a live grenade was thrown overhead. I dove down, off to the side, into nothing, into the crevasse, sliding my hand across the rough edge into a pocket that clung to with all five fingers, thanking God I could breathe again before the fall took me into the sea. The arm of my glasses hung from my right ear, swaying the more water filled the lens. The light passed overhead and the raindrops looked like blurred tongues of fire. The cold water dripped on my face as I looked up, streaming down the rock as my feet slipped against the wallface and dangled beneath me, licked by the passing seawater. I wondered for a second as I felt my full weight tug against my arm, "why did I get down?" What was I doing? Through a narrow crack in the wall, looking straight out in front of me, I could see why.

He was there, standing stock still in the fleeting light, Clem's arm hanging limp at his side, looking back. Looking for me. While the rest of his body stood like a statue, the edges of him that had been so sharp before now blended into the dark like he was a living shadow. Clem's arms and legs dangling at his sides made him look like some kind of spider creature with four extra limbs; her head was like a fifth, severed stump poking out of his shoulder.

I saw the slow turn of his head as the light turned its own gaze away again. There he was still, looking through the darkness. Somehow I felt if I moved, he could still see me. I knew he could. I worked my other hand into the crack, into the water pouring through for one other surface to grab. The ice cold water below rose up again, wrapping around my shoes. I could barely feel my toes anymore. While I held as still as I could, holding my breath, praying for my glasses to stay balanced on my ear, I thanked God that they weren't on my face, reflecting the glare, revealing where I was. I knew if he saw me, I was dead.

I waited, hanging on that ledge, hoping he was gone. Seconds passed and the light came again, and there he was, unmoved, looking. But his face was turned closer to where I hid, desperately shaking to force my arms to hold myself up. As the light disappeared the second time I could see the slightest movement of his shoulder as if to turn around, then all was dark again. I could feel something in the crack where my right hand was, something smooth and rigid, almost like porcelain? I could feel it rub against the salt under my fingernails. Lightning struck directly overhead and the crack of thunder made me cling closer, harder to the wall, even as I felt my fingers start to slip from the pocket. Seconds. The light came, and he was gone.

I gripped hard into the pocket and harder into the crack in the boulder, my fingers digging into the rock and combing into them whatever it was hidden in there. Using my shoulder to hold my glasses to my cheek, I pulled myself up and over as the rain came down, and rolled lazily on my back, breathing in hard the cold wet air. I laughed and my eyes and nostrils stung. My faced was so soaked with water I couldn't tell if I cried. Didn't feel as heroic if I did. Then I realized I still had whatever it was stuck in the rock, turning over in my right hand. Smooth on one side, rough on the other, hard, sharp along one edge. I held it up in front of me in the pitch black darkness, waiting for the light to reveal it was a seashell. A long, jagged piece of a broken conch. The part on the inside where the mollusk had been was like silver, reflecting the lantern light. I stood up carefully, shoving it into my jacket pocket. For luck.

When I got my bearings I finally saw how close I actually was. The silhouette of the man and his daughter had vanished, and in its place in front of me, a pair of constant window lights glinting out from the caretaker's house. I could almost feel myself about to get knocked over by the winds, the waves, whatever else, but I followed. Just a few more steps, and I could finally feel solid soil, grass beneath my rain-soaked shoes. The only thing ahead of me was the lighthouse.

It was a massive towering structure. White brick like the single-story house built some 20 yards away. I crept up to see it was the window beside the front door. A shadow passed on the inside, and I crouched, hugging the side of the house. I looked through at what had to be the kitchen. A stovetop with boiling pots. Fish on the cutting board. An ax on the wall underneath a pair of crossed albatross wings. On the table was longest, thickest fish tail I'd ever seen, pouring over the side and coiling onto the floor, with green and silver scales. I moved along the corner of the window to see further inside; a dark hallway in front of the door and a corridor just out of sight. Then out of the shadows, he emerged, with steps I could feel against the wall. I ducked under the window, wishing I could hear anything. Just rain and thunder. Clem, where are you?

I wanted to go inside, or look through the other dark windows on the house to find where she was, but I couldn't let him out of my sight. He was at the stove preparing fish meat, wearing denim overalls and a white shirt. On his belt was a ring of a dozen keys, and I knew one of them was the key to wherever he was keeping Clem. But how to get it...

After a minute he turned and disappeared into the corridor again on the other side of the house. Crouching below the light from the window, I followed. I was a second away from rounding the corner of the house until I heard the distinct sound of a door to the outside creak open and closed. I jumped back, out of sight, hearing the key latch, and the lightning came again to show him trundling toward the lighthouse. Part of me wanted to follow him, but another part of me knew that he came into the house with Clem. She was still inside. I knew she was.

I went back to the kitchen window, bracing my elbow and breaking the glass, covering my knuckles with my sleeve before knocking out the loose shards. Immediately I was struck with the warmth of the house, and the smell of the cooking; fish, but something else too, like red meat. It smelled delicious.

*Follow.*

Right. I didn't have much time, and the walls seemed closer together by the second as I didn't know where was where. There was no hiding the broken window when he was coming back, but I just had to find her. I yelled out, "Clementine?! Clem, if you can hear me, give me a sign! Where are you?!"

A thud sounded from the other side of the house, across the corridor. I ran across the dark walls, feeling for a light switch, but what I found was another door, with a handle that wouldn't turn.

"Clem, are you in here?"

Two knocks from the other side, and relief washed over me, as well as disgust. He was keeping her here. Trapped against her will. I was going to save her.

"I'm gonna get you out, okay? Just stay put!"

"*AX!*" that same raspy echo from earlier erupted from behind the door, the sound of it making me freeze. "*LIGHT* *HOUSE!*"

My next clear memory, I was in front of the fire ax on the kitchen wall, pulling it from its holder. I ran to and out the door on the side of the house, overpowered with adrenaline. I threw open the door to first store room of the lighthouse. Hot and stuffy, with only a lamplight, I saw Clem's father, standing still, holding a pitcher of water, looking down at something on the other side of the room. I smelled burning oil, and I looked to see another old iron stove at the foot of the stairs, and a chain leading to the shackles of a scarred woman lying on the ground.

Her arms were so thin, I could barely believe they could fit in her chains. She had a collar on her next that was brass or bronze, I couldn't tell which, that dug into her skin. She was gaunt and pale... but beautiful. With Clem's long blonde hair. But the more I looked the more I saw, her torso and hips led into a long, slithering tail of green and silver scales flapping limply over a mattress on the floor. And I couldn't believe my eyes. For the briefest moment, hers met mine in a shimmering blue shine I'd only seen from Clementine. They were pained, calling for help, but confused and concerned, widened at the sight of me.

That's when he turned to face me, rage in his eyes. I lifted the ax over my head, but his massive arms swung behind him, dousing me, breaking my focus as he crashed into me against the wall. With both arms I clung onto the ax as hard as I could as he tried time and again to tear it away from me, knocking me over the shelves and boxes that lined the wall. I'd lost the element of surprise and he was stronger than me, more prepared. The intensity I saw in his eyes was as clear as Clem's as he ripped at the ax with one hand and pinned me by the neck to the wall with the other. As my eyes started to roll, I saw one more shelf yet to fall. I had to, I let slip one arm to throw off the wooden panel, as half a dozen full tin cans fell onto the back of his head and shoulders. Just enough to daze him, to escape his grasp, but I had to let go of the ax.

I ran for the door, but in a second he was there, splintering where my hand was only an inch away from the handle. He swung again and the weight I threw behind my dodge knocked me backwards towards the stairs. I could've sworn it was the force of the air. To the side of me, I heard the tightening of a steel chain, and the ear-piercing shriek of... God, I don't know. It was like the song of a whale and the call of a gull *and* the highest sea wind you'd ever hear roaring through a canyon. It was the loudest sound I'd ever heard and it felt like it lasted forever.

When I came to only seconds later, I saw George cupping one of his ears, still holding the ax in the other. I couldn't hear anything over the ringing sound that remained, but I saw the woman holding herself off the ground, clutching her collar, coughing blood onto floor. I looked up to see him ready to bring the ax down hard and fast, and I ran up the stairs. The heat and humidity that intensified with every step up the lighthouse tower made a fog stick to my glasses and my throat burned as the ringing in my ears slowly died down.

Behind me coming up, I could start to hear him screaming, "You're not gonna take them from me!!!"

The higher I climbed those steps in the dark, what must've been 4 or 500, the louder the thunder got, as well as George's screams, and then a light pierced through the black as the stairs led up to a segmented hatch. On the other side was a light like the yellow sun. The lantern room. It was a simple, old fashioned knob that thankfully gave way as George's thunderous steps came the closest they could. I lifted myself through, every muscle in my body on utter fire. The lantern from this close, closer than any man should be without protective goggles was blinding white; even when I covered my eyes with my hands, I could see the black and red of the bones and blood inside.

When George came through, it was just as he'd been when I followed him here, a black silhouette as the light passed behind him. The after effect of his shadow would flash in my eyes whenever I'd look away. The heat that radiated from the lantern was like a bon fire as the man moved around the light to me. He swung the ax, shattering one of the panels that made the circular gallery, and I ran for the other side of the light. Then he swung again, embedding the ax blade into the blaring lantern itself, and he cursed as he failed to unloosen his weapon from the massive trapping shards of burning glass. Now was my chance.

As the lantern moved, forcing him to move with it, I started, running with all my might, all my weight onto him. I moved my head as my shoulder collided with his center of gravity, my arms hooking around his bended knees. I had him. Together we crashed through another panel and out onto the deck, his back smashing against the iron rail. I felt cold rain on the back of my neck again as I held onto his legs, desperately trying to lift him up over the side. Then I felt the searing pain of his elbow crashing hard into my back, breaking my focus. His other hand was on my neck, squeezing forcing me off as my fingers scratched at denim for any hold anymore. And like that, he was holding me over the side, my legs and left arm clinging to the wet rail, as all I could see was the nothingness hanging below me, and his black silhouette leaning out of the lantern light.

I struggled, but the more I did, the more I felt my legs slipping, my weight falling over as he was all that was holding me over the abyss below the lighthouse. At 2 or 300 feet, in this storm, I couldn't even begin to see the ground, but I would feel it soon. I felt that fire in my chest and under the skin of my face whenever I'd hold my breath too long, and my body would scream for mercy. George's grip only tightened. The hand of mine that tried to loosen his spasmed and fell limp to my side. And the next thing I felt was his hot breath against my face. "I told you to stay away."

I was fading. Giving up. I couldn't breath, I couldn't fight anymore. And then I felt it.

Smooth, sharp. Poking out of my jacket pocket. With all the last of what I had in me, I grasped at that broken piece of seashell and drove the jagged edge into his thick neck. I felt the warmth of his blood pour out onto the back of my hand as my palm stung. His grip loosened and my other arm grabbed onto his shoulder. I gasped, breathing in as much water as air. My knee brushed against the key ring on his belt. The second my feet touched the deck, I turned back, holding him steady as I took his keys. Then I used my full weight to push him over. Gurgling, clutching at his bleeding neck, there was nothing he could do but fall. I watched as he disappeared into the dark. I didn't see or hear the impact much as I wanted to. Even when the lightning flashed seconds later, I didn't see his body on the rocks on the island shore, just the black of crashing waves, now foaming red.

As the rain washed away George's blood from my right hand, I realized just how tightly I was grasping at that silver-lined shell that was in my hand. The long sharp edge that ran along where I stabbed him had also cut a gash along my palm that stung with every small movement of my fingers, and the steady stream of blood that seeped through was slowly washed out by the rain. I'd have to worry about that later.

I walked down the length of that godforsaken lighthouse, rubbing my neck and counting the keys. Twelve. Most were rust brown, some black, but one I'm pretty sure was bronze. By the time I finally got down to that first store room, with the woman chained to the stove, she had a look of suspicious relief in her eyes as she saw me with the keys. She revealed her neck to me and showed me where to open it. When I did, the mechanism split in half down the middle, revealing six bronze spikes that went inward, cutting into her neck, her blood was thin and translucent as she clutched her wounds, gasping for air. She pointed to the water pitcher George had dropped and to a faucet on the wall. I filled it, bringing it over to her, following her lead to pour the cold water over her wounds, which healed in seconds. Within a few tries I was able to undo her shackles too.

"*Thank you.*" she spoke, her voice was clear as day and gentle as a breeze. The echoes of young and old as if she were many voices in one still remained, but calmer, and I felt so warm in her words.

"You're welcome," my response came automatically.

"*Where is my daughter?*"

In an instant I was in the house, in the dark corridor, unlocking a bedroom door. Inside was Clementine, sitting on her bed. But she wasn't the same. Under the layers of clothes she wore to school, I saw tiny packs of feathers peeking out from under the flesh of her forearms. The hunch of her back were the wings of a gigantic sea bird that were nearly the length of the wall, no doubt broken in several places to mostly fit into her clothes. And her legs were broken as well, hanging from the side of her bed, stick-thin with orange scales and webbed feet. I would've been disgusted, but her eyes shined bright as ever as she looked up at me, gesturing to her bronze collar. I took hers off too and poured water over the wounds, even if I couldn't bring myself to stand so close.

"*Don't be afraid.*"

And I wasn't. I couldn't be. She was so beautiful, how could I ever be?

"*And don't worry about us. We healed every day, no matter what he did. And we're free now, because of you. But now you have to forget about us...*"

No... I tried to say no but my mouth wouldn't move. I couldn't move. I couldn't think or feel anything else but "no!" No, please! I don't want to forget! Clem, please, don't make me forget!

*Forget.*

I heard it in my mind. Echoing over and over. No... no, I didn't want to. We were friends, weren't we?

*Forget...*

I didn't... she was so nice... what -- what was her name? I know I knew it. It was so important...

"*Forget us. And go home.*"

I had a dream where I cut my hand on a sea shell. But today I woke up with the scar.
