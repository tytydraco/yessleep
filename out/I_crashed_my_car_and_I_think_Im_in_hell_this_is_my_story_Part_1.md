Despite the title, this happened to me a few years back and while I haven’t been quite the same since, I like to believe I’m fine now. Anyway, I’ve been searching for places to share this story for a while, since no one believes me. Until recently when I discovered this subreddit and figured that a better way to share it couldn’t exist. Thank you in advance for listening.

I was heading south in my old, rusty Corolla, which, by the way, is really the only direction you can go when you live in Maine. My destination was Dover, NH - and even though visiting family wasn’t my favorite thing to do, missing my dad’s funeral would probably make mom disown me. I had been driving for hours without any pauses at this point, I figured it would be better to just get it over with. The road ahead was dark, the road lights offering just enough light. There also weren’t any cars in sight, which was something I found both eerie and comforting at the same time. The only thing I could see other than the road was the treetops of the forest, whooshing past my peripherals.

I hated driving and I had always hated it, ever since that time when my dad crashed his old, ugly Escort that he loved so much, all while I was inside it with him. But the worst part about driving was boredom, by far. As mentioned, I had been driving for hours at this point and - the boredom was getting to me. I was so bored I couldn’t help but sigh every two minutes. However, I knew that not too far ahead, there was a right turn I could make onto a dirt road that basically just made a giant, half-circle through the forest and back to the main road. So, even though it was totally unlike myself, I decided I’d take the turn. Fast forward a few minutes and there it was, that right turn that led onto the dark dirt road, just a few hundred feet ahead. I started having doubts as I gently pressed the brakes, but I told myself there was no turning back and to stop being a coward. Part of me thinks I made that turn out of spite, just to prove to my dad that I wasn’t as much of a coward as he thought I was. So I made the turn, the deep, unforgiving darkness staring back at me, almost taunting me for making such a pointless and stupid detour. Nevertheless, I kept driving. After a minute or two of adjusting to the darkness, I started thinking about the funeral again.

  
“People are gonna be crying, aren’t they?” - I thought to myself, as I thought about the fact that no one knew that side of my dad that I knew all too well.

  
Nonetheless, I didn’t like the idea of confronting that side of myself that was grieving my father’s death. The “rough love” relationship I had with my father really wasn’t serving me well, to no one’s surprise. These thoughts were becoming too much and I wasn’t in the mood for breaking down. After trying to come up with something to distract myself with, I decided the radio was the best call. I turned the radio on, increasing the volume little by little, there was nothing. I switched through the channels, trying to find one that worked, but not a single one did. Eventually, I was back at the radio channel I started on. I listened for a few seconds, telling myself I would turn the radio off if nothing started playing. And just as I was about to do so, a man sighed, like one of those sighs you let out whenever your dog decides your carpet looks like it would be better with some piss on it. I was intrigued. 

  
“Did they forget to turn the mics off?” - I thought to myself.

  
“Well folks… It's been swell, but I think it’s time to call it a night.” - The man on the radio said, sounding fatigued. 

  
“Actually… Recently, something’s been botherin’ me.” - He continued.

  
“I’m sure you can all guess what I’m talkin’ about… These disappearances we’ve had lately.” - The man said in a frustrated tone, almost like someone he knew had disappeared.

  
“It started in New Hampshire and has been creeping up towards us in Maine!”

  
“17 people in two weeks… In Maine, people!” - The man almost screamed, getting more and more frustrated.

  
“I’ve been telling people something’s up but they just won’t listen!”

  
“...Something’s not right, I just know it.” - The man said in a defeated tone.

  
“I bet it has somethin’ to do w-”

  
Before the man could finish his sentence, the radio cut out. I tried fixing it a couple times by turning the radio on and off, but it didn’t work.

  
“17 people in two weeks huh?… Strange.” - I nonchalantly said to myself out loud.

  
While totally enjoying my silent drive through the pitch black forest, I noticed a roaring, engine-like sound in the distance. 

  
“Someone else on this road? Strange.” - I thought.

  
The sound just kept growing and growing. I used the little knowledge I had about cars that I had gained from my dad as a kid, when he was still trying to get me interested in cars to no avail. I concluded that this must’ve been a V8 engine at the very least. I focused intensely on the curve 300 feet ahead of me, where the other car must be coming from. Slowly but surely, I saw the trees by the curve get more and more illuminated, these were some strong headlights. And just as soon as the blinding headlights peaked out from beyond the curve, they shut off. I could still hear the engine sound get closer and closer but I couldn’t see where the car was. My old Corolla’s dusty headlights had no chance at reaching this guy. I decided I should stop the car, but I couldn’t press the brakes too hard in fear of sliding off the road and pummeling down into the steep ditch to my right. So I gently pressed the brakes, a few moments later my car was at a near standstill, the raging roar of the car ahead continuing to grow louder… The last thing I saw was a Black Ram 3500, ramming into me - head on.

  
\*\*\*

  
I woke up with my car on its right side, leaned up against a tree, a pounding headache making my whole body tense up. My sight was blurry and there was a loud ring in my ears, but I could see what I presumed was smoke, seeping out of my engine and I could hear some kind of liquid spilling out which I presumed was oil. I started drifting in and out of consciousness, fearing that any time now, I would fall asleep and never wake up. I tried screaming for help, but all I could muster was a pained, quiet moan.

  
\*\*\*

  
I came to, for the second time, the pain had lessened but it still made it hard to move or do much of anything really. My sight was clear and the ring in my ears was now gone. It was still dark out, so I assumed I couldn’t have been out for long. Nevertheless, I decided my first objective was to make sure I wasn’t bleeding heavily anywhere, and so I did, no blood; strange. After a few deep breaths, I set my next objective, which was to get the hell out of the car. All those scenes in action movies where the car blows up after crashing was the only thing I could picture. I braced myself, expecting excruciating pain if I tried to move. I removed my seatbelt and pushed the door open, feeling barely any pain, which was also strange but - nothing I could waste time thinking about. I climbed out of my car, jumping down onto the steep incline of the slope below. I began walking up towards the dirt road, stopping halfway to look back at my car, now being no more than a big mess of metal and plastic.

   
\*\*\*

  
I was now standing on that dirt road in the dark, unsure of what my next move should be. My phone, of course, so obvious. I reached down to my right pocket, sliding my hand inside, only to find it empty.

  
“Where the hell’s my phone!?” - I exclaimed.

  
Then I remembered, I had put it in the cup holder in the car. I made my way down and back to my car, still half expecting it to explode at any moment. As I inched towards the car, a gut feeling told me to - whatever I do - DON’T MOVE. I tried to ignore it but after a couple more steps, I just stopped dead in my tracks. I couldn’t move my body and I didn’t know why. I felt the adrenaline start coursing through my body, all I could hear was my own heavy breathing. I stood there, frozen, for what must’ve only been three seconds, until I heard something snap behind me, inches from the back of my head, not the branch kind of snap, but rather the cracking your neck kind of snap. Not wasting a single second, I bolted straight ahead, way faster than I knew I could, going straight past my car. I ran and ran for what seemed like hours until I eventually stopped. I looked around and stood as still as I could to try and scan for any sounds or movement, it was completely silent. I stood there for a moment, trying my best to gather myself and catch my breath. I then sat down on the damp forest floor, contemplating what to do next while occasionally spinning my head around to look for… Whatever that was back there.

  
\*\*\*

  
A few minutes passed and I remembered I had my old swiss-army knife with a built- in compass in my jacket pocket. I had received it from my grandpa as a kid, it was the only thing I had to remember him by. I slid my hand down towards the left pocket of my black bomber jacket, pulling down the zipper and reaching in. There it was. I always brought it with me, no matter what. I looked down on it, the worn, wooden grip giving me a sense of comfort.

  
“I miss you gramps.” - I said in my mind. 

  
I stood up, feeling a sharp pain in my knee as I did so, but I wouldn’t let that stop me. Whatever was out there wasn’t something I was interested in being near ever again, I remembered the man on the radio and his short talk about the missing persons. 

  
“Could it be?...”

  
Before I could finish the thought, I convinced myself I was just being paranoid, maybe what I heard back there wasn’t even real. Anyway, I decided it was time to move, I turned the compass until the red triangle inside pointed south and started walking.

  
\*\*\*

  
The rest of the night wasn’t very notable, sure, there were some rustling sounds here and there that may or may not have frightened me a bit, but other than that - nothing special. I still don’t know how far I walked that night, it must've been at least 10 miles. After what I presumed was a few hours, the sun was starting to rise and an immense sense of relief washed over me. I had never been that happy to see the sun rise, that’s for sure. The clear sky, now with an orange hue, the newly-awoken, singing birds and the deep, beautiful green of the forest made it much easier to go on. I kept walking for a while before I saw some sort of straight, light-blue structure. It was hard to make out exactly what it was through the small gaps between the trees. I kept walking towards it.

  
“A gas station!” - I excitedly thought to myself, the little voice in the back of my head screaming out in joy.

  
Needless to say I, once again, just bolted. Straight towards the gas station. As I got closer and closer I felt more and more relieved. In just a few more moments, I’d be getting help. I reached the border of the woods that was standing atop a steep slope, I looked down on the extremely worn-down tarmac and scanned the area around the gas station for any signs of human life. There was no one in sight. I figured somebody would arrive any moment now, to open up shop. I walked down the slope and started heading towards my goal. I read the blue, neon-sign that stood on the roof over the storefront door. “Galva’Gas”, it said, in that typical 1950s diner font. I had never heard that name before but that didn’t matter now. 

  
\*\*\*

  
I sat down next to the storefront door, my hunger was finally kicking in, that aching feeling quickly surrounding my whole stomach and chest area. But, nonetheless, all I could do was keep my patience and just wait for the employee or owner or- whoever, to arrive. I waited and waited but no one came. I thought about the possibility that all employees were sick or something but I couldn’t come up with a satisfactory explanation. So I finally got up and decided a B and E charge would be better than starving to death in the summer heat. I walked up to the glass door that had been covered from the inside by some sort of black paper, I then noticed the rest of the windows had also been covered with this black paper. I thought it was a little strange, definitely not good for business but - maybe it was an attempt to discourage eventual robbers or something. I slowly turned the straight, rusty metal door handle. A loud click-noise filled the empty air and before I could think about how strange it was that the door was unlocked, I pushed the door open and made my way inside.

  
“Hello?” - I called out.

  
I stood still, waiting for a response but I never got one. I walked around the store, the only thing I could hear being the loud humming of the flickering, blue luminescent lights above. The interior was - unsurprisingly - also very old, except it was way more well-kept than the exterior of the gas station. I kept walking around, just observing my surroundings. As I got to the end of the middle-aisle I saw a door to my right, “STAFF ONLY” it said on a poorly-made paper poster taped to the door.

  
“Ah, screw it” - I thought, and opened the door.

  
“Hello?” - I called out again, this time not expecting an answer.

  
Just as I had expected, no answer again. I looked at the boxes stacked on the rusty shelves as I slowly walked through the staff/storage room. There was another door which I assumed led to some sort of office but it was locked. There was nothing to note here so I walked back out to the store. And as I walked out, I noticed something strange but couldn’t quite pick up what it was. Then I realized, it was much darker now, no light seeping in through the small gaps of the black paper that covered the windows.

  
\*\*\*

  
I walked out from the store, it was… snowing? In the middle of July? I looked up at the dark-gray sky above me, snow gently flowing through the air, a breeze of piercing cold hitting my face. I didn’t know how to react. My mind just went blank, as if my brain couldn’t even begin to make sense of what was happening. I felt completely empty and hopeless. Not knowing what else to do, I went back inside, cracked open a bag of Fritos and a beer and just sat down on the floor. 

  
\*\*\*

  
As I started munching on my Fritos, tears began to well up in my eyes, I was terrified and trying to hide it. I continued distracting myself by stuffing my face with chips and as I was chewing, I thought I heard a sound in the background. I immediately stopped chewing, and after a few seconds of silence, I heard it again. It was a knock on the glass plane of the front door, but a small knock, I don’t know how to describe it but I could hear that the knocking came from a small hand. I slowly walked towards the front door, locking it as soon as it came within my reach. It knocked again, the sound came from around hip-level. I began slowly peeling off the black paper covering the door, so as to see who it could possibly be. But before I had peeled enough paper off to see who it was, the knocking started again and didn’t stop this time. I stood frozen for a second, then… The knocking sound covered the whole front side of the building. At least 20 tiny hands knocking all over the windows, all at the same time. I turned around and ran towards the staff room, hearing the door rattling behind me as if someone was trying to get in with all their might. I dove behind a shelf of boxes and just hid, still hearing those terrifying knocking sounds. I was convinced that, if those things got in, they’d kill me. As this blood-curdling feeling of imminent threat writhed in my chest, I heard the sound I didn't want to hear, the door swung open. The sound of tens of small feet scurrying around the store made my skin crawl. And suddenly, silence. I held my breath, trying my hardest to listen for any footsteps but there was nothing, just that same old humming of the luminescent lights on the ceiling.

  
\*\*\*

  
I couldn't hold my breath any longer, the first time a real-life consequence of smoking had been made so apparent to me. I took a deep, shaky breath and before I could exhale, the door leading out to the store swung open with immense force. A child- no, this wasn't a child, it was some monster, disguising itself as a child - charged at me, at a speed that would be impossible for any child to reach in a million years. Its face was what I can only describe as "too detailed", long, thin lips with deep grooves in them, big, jet-black eyes, long, but non-pointy teeth and a scrunched up nose. The thing let out an ear-piercing screech as it pounced on me. Out of pure instinct, I rolled out of the way, just enough to get out of its reach. As soon as I stopped rolling, before I could get up and escape, I felt a sharp pain in my back, followed by a warm, wet feeling running down my side; I was bleeding heavily. I ran back out to the store, completely forgetting about the other 17 or so monsters that had just been there. I stood against the door, using all the force I could muster to hold it shut. The monster rammed the door, forcing the door to open just a few inches for a split second, again, again and again. I don't know how long I stood there and held that door shut, could've been an hour or a minute, I honestly have no clue. Even when the ramming had stopped, I still stood there, almost leaned up against the door, pushing so hard my feet sled on the white tile flooring.

  
\*\*\*

  
Unsurprisingly, I collapsed just a few moments later, I was bleeding heavily, I had strained my body more than I had done for years, all while running on half a can of beer and a bag of Fritos. I didn't know what was going on, I felt hopeless, how could I possibly survive this hell? As I laid on the floor, unable to move, I looked back at my life and concluded that I had seen enough. I had seen and done enough good and bad in my 26 years on this planet to die with no regrets. Sure, I didn't want to leave my mother and younger sister behind, but they would be fine without me.  
"Just kill me." - Was my last thought before losing consciousness.
