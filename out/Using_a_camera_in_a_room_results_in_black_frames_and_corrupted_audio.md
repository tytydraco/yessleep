I arrive at work and walk in, then greet Richard. While waiting for everyone else, I get my vest and check the shelf for any signs that arrived today. I notice Taylor and Emily have arrived, so we all gather around the table to get briefed by Richard. Richard starts to explain and show where we are headed and the signs we will be installing. I go to the shelf, unpack the packaged signs so Emily and I can inspect them, make sure nothing is damaged from transport, and ensure they match our drawings and reference papers. The signs are your standard control access signs and informational signs. This sounds like an easy job for us. All we need is silicone, VHB, and measuring tape. Since it's the four of us, we can finish our night shift pretty quickly.

As we inspect the blueprint to see where our signs are going to go, there isn’t much on it. It only shows a small part of the hallway, and midway, on the door, there’s one sign we can install. In the main room, there are pointers showing where we need to install the signs. Shaun asks me why this blueprint barely shows anything past the doors from the main room. I’m not sure, but it’s not an issue since we have everything we need. Nothing is missing from our reference papers or the signs we are installing for this night shift. I repack the signs and put them in our shop truck. I see Emily has brought the cart, tools, and supplies we need, while Shaun has the papers. Richard leads the way in his other shop truck, and we all follow him downtown.

We found a spot to park next to the entryway of the business. It’s pretty quiet at this time, with several groups of homeless people in the distance. Later, we see a police car pass by with its lights on. We know we have to watch our backs. Richard tells us to double-check that our truck is locked, along with our tools and signs. Since we now have everything on the cart—tools, signs, papers, and everything else—I hear Shaun mention that this building looks dark from above and that he doesn’t see any windows. I notice it too, but it isn’t that important to me. We all head up to the door and buzz the intercom, stating who we are and our purpose for the visit. They already knew ahead of time that we were coming at midnight. The door unlocks, and we are let in. A security guard leads us directly to the front desk, where we sign in. I see Richard talking to the security guard and the front desk lady about where we need to be and what we are installing. In the meantime, I double-check with Emily to make sure we have the signs, tools, and VHB. The security guard understands from the blueprint which room it is and escorts us to the elevator. We all go in. I see the security guard select one of the lowest floors, below the main lobby.

As we arrive, I can feel the air is colder, and we see a hallway stretching both left and right. It’s pretty quiet, except for a janitor cleaning the floors down the hall. The security guard leads the way to the right, and we keep walking until we reach a door. The security guard stops and tells us this is the room. He badges his key to the card reader and opens the door, telling us he will be standing by to supervise. We don’t mind, so we all get started. Looking around, there is an empty desk, and to the right side of the wall, there is a locker with a sign mentioning the storage of electronics. Shaun and I go around marking the doors for easy sign placement for Richard and Emily. I overhear Emily mentioning a sign she is installing and asking what’s up with all these warnings saying "SCIF" and "Transatlantic Cable Room."

At that moment, I move on to double-check the paperwork with Richard to make sure we have the correct signs at the doors in the right spots. Once we all finish, while Emily picks up the trash, I open my phone to check the time and see how long it took us. I notice I have no bars on my phone. I assume it’s because we are underground. Then I ask Richard if he has taken pictures yet, since I want to be sure if he needs me to take photos. But he tells me the phone camera pictures are black, and even when recording, the video is black, with distorted audio. I offer to give it a try with my phone. When I open the camera, the image is static-like, turning black with some black bars. It seems weird to me—what is wrong with my phone? But when Emily tries to take a photo of the door from the hallway, her picture comes out normal. I ask her to try taking a picture inside the room, and that’s when her phone camera photos turn black, with distorted audio.

I ask the security guard why we can’t take pictures of the signs inside. The security guard tells us, “Yeah, that’s normal for this area. It’s to stop anyone from leaking stuff. I really can’t tell you further about it.” I see Richard is pretty frustrated about this and has to relay the info to our boss. Well, since we are all done and the job is completed correctly, Richard tells us, “Yeah, let’s call it a night.” The security guard escorts us up, we sign out, and we go back to our trucks before heading to our workshop. Our boss is pretty dismissive about it. “How can your phones suddenly black out? It’s so stupid and absurd,” he says. But Richard and Emily convince him by showing how the audio and video looked. We were let off, but our boss said, he will discuss with the client anyway, since our boss believes we already do our job right anyway. I understood his frustration, since it is important that we document our work progress with photos, which is why the client always requests a photo, if there are any requests or issues.

Honestly, I still don’t fully know what happened that day, and neither do my coworkers—we couldn’t find a reason. I decided to go down a rabbit hole researching transatlantic cables and SCIFs, things I saw in the main room. Even after all that, I still don’t understand why this room caused strange issues with our cameras.

  


Short Summary: My crew and I were installing signs in a secured underground room when we noticed something weird—our phone cameras wouldn’t work inside. Photos turned black, and audio came out distorted. The security guard brushed it off, saying it was normal for the area. Our boss didn’t believe us at first, but after seeing the evidence, he couldn’t explain it either. Later, I fell down a rabbit hole researching SCIFs and transatlantic cables, but I still have no clue why that room messed with our cameras.
