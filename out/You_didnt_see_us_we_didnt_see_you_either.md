It's already past 5 pm when me and my club members finished the last activity during our yearly school based camp. It was really hectic that day. After the last event all I can think of was just a shower. Yes, I wanted a shower. But we're in the school grounds. Our school is not that rich, since the school is in the province, there's a lack of proper facilities. 

After we wrapped up the said last activity, I went to my tent, I saw my friend Samuel already in the tent playing with his phone.

 "Hey Samuel! Wanna go hit the showers before you laze around my pillows and my blankets, those are new so don't dirty them." 

I said to Samuel quite angrily. 

"Yeah yeah let's go take a shower, by the way I'm gonna borrow your toiletries since I forgot to bring mine, and possibly your towel also"

He replied quite frankly. I was a bit annoyed since he wants to borrow some of my things but it's not that big of a deal.

"Just leave your phone here in the tent, I'll just bring mine to play some music since this school gives me the creeps"

I said to Samuel as I handed him the towels and the toiletries. We went to the second floor comfort room near the right staircase of our building.

We were waiting there for sometime about 20 mins when we saw our friend Dianne climbed down the stairs. I immediately asked her how did she climbed down from the stairs. There's no person climbing up the stairs since we're literally by the stairs. She just shrugged that off and said she'll talk to me later as she was quite busy.

Fast forward to midnight, Dianne went to my tent, I was lazing around with Samuel when Samuel brought up what happened before.

"Dianne tell us how did you climbed down the stairs because nobody has been climbing up those stairs or even the adjacent stairs?"

Dianne then replied that she has indeed climbed up within those stairs where we were waiting. She said that she said hi to us but we didn't respond. She also added that I somehow smiled weirdly at her.

That when I got shivers. I immediately asked her what do we look like.

"I remember Samuel being at the side playing with his phone and you were holding a lot of things while also using your phone, you had a brown phonecase and oh you didnt have glasses at that time which seemed weird to me" 

I got chills over my body

Samuel never had a phone in the first place since he left it on the tent and he was holding all of our things the whole time we were there...

I'm always wearing my glasses and have been wearing them during that time...and the things is my phonecase ain't brown...it's a clear white phonecase...

"Dianne that wasn't us that you saw...and are you even the Dianne I know?"

I slowly backed away from the tent when I realized her feet were both left
