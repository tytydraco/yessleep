No stream runs through. No lake nearby. Just the well. It’s the oldest thing here. Older than the sagging timbers of the feasting hall, older even than the oldest stories Gran Fenner tells by the fire. Older than all of it, save perhaps for Lifflin, our Dryad, silent within the Heartwood of her great tree. She’s older still, I’m sure. The well itself is sunk right in the center of everything, its wide, square mouth opening to the sky. Broad stone slabs line its sides, each one set below the last, narrowing as they descend. Step by step, down into the earth’s cool belly. Damp, even at high bloom, but never, ever muddy. Its stone is worn smooth, dipped a little in the middle where countless soles have trod. Even on a moonless night, you can find your way down and up again without a torch, your feet remembering each familiar edge and hollow.



The hot spring steams near the edge of our clearing. Not the kind of water that quenches thirst, but a gift for the craft Father’s been teaching me. I spend most days there now, the heat a familiar prickle on my skin, learning the rhythm of it. Selecting the best Sagewood, straight-grained and true, feeling the moment the salt has bitten deep enough, transforming the pale wood into something dark, hard as flint but lighter, less likely to shatter against stone or bone. Spring-hardened, we call it. It’s not as simple as it sounds.



Father promised me my own spear this passing, balanced for my hand, its point honed sharp enough to draw blood from a shadow. Said I was ready for the hunt Lifflin permits each moon – one careful hunt, just enough to keep fat on our bones without souring the forest’s mood. The thought of it, walking tall with the hunters, my spear whispering in my grip… it’s been a fire in my chest for seasons.



But the fire banked low when Father came back from the elders’ council, his brow tight. We had to harden spears for the younger boys too. Bran, who still flinches when the wind rattles the thatch, would get one. It wasn’t fair. I’d waited, learned the patience of the steam, the feel of the wood yielding its softness. Why the rush? “Nerves, lad,” Father grunted, not meeting my eye. “Everyone’s jumpy.”



He wasn’t wrong. The unease had been creeping in like mist for a passing, maybe more. Since the blackbirds arrived. Not just a scattering, but a flock, their feathers drinking the light, their eyes like chips of obsidian watching everything. Always watching. From the hut roofs, from the fence posts, from the highest branches of Lifflin’s own tree. Their cawing scrapes at the quiet, sharp and incessant. Try to chase one, they just hop aside, mocking. Throw a stone, they melt into the air, gone before your arm is halfway through the swing. Lifflin forbids harming them, the elders mutter, stroking their worry-beads. Strange, how they always fly straight back to her tree when startled, vanishing amongst the leaves like dark thoughts finding their home.



The birds are part of it. The other part… is the silence where girl-children’s laughter should be. Or so the elders whisper when the berry wine loosens their tongues. Never got to hear it myself. Used to be the cradles held girls as often as boys. Been like this for a while. No young women now… there’s Lifflin, of course. I see her sometimes, dusk or early mornings, moving silent as shadow around her tree, sometimes sitting on a branch, just staring into the woods. Her skin like moon-pale bark, hair the colour of deep moss after rain. Beautiful, yes, but not in a way that invites touch or hungry eyes. Timeless. Forbidden. Not that I never thought of it, but… Not like… well, bran’s older sister… she was quick, sharp-tongued, smile like the sun. Until three moons ago. They found her crumpled at the bottom of the well steps, skull cracked open like a dropped pumpkin. Slipped fetching water after dark, they said. An accident. Such a sad, sad shame. The water ran pink for days, and tasted strange long after. Still makes me shudder. Bran… was strangely quiet about it. Didn’t see him weep even once. All boys now. Only boys. 



Rumor says it's been like this since the goats went weird. Once or twice a passing, a kid comes out wrong, two heads, limbs maybe twisted, stillborn usually. Burned quick, hushed up. But this last birthing cycle? Three of them. Three horrid little things, slick and pale, bleating silently from mouths that shouldn’t be. Father needed me to help carry the wood for the burning. I saw one close up. Curled on the hide wrap, both heads lolling, tiny legs twitching feebly. Like it was trying to live, despite the wrongness. Made my stomach heave. The blackbirds watched mockingly, cawing. Always the cawing.



Maybe all that unease, all that quiet dread, is why Mellafin found a foothold.



She started appearing seven moons ago. A Rootless woman, setting up her small camp for a couple of days just beyond the clearing’s edge, always arrived right after moonset plunged the clearing into its fifteen nights of star-scattered darkness. At first, the elders kept her at spear-point. Father stood guard himself, wouldn’t let her closer than the old crooked Sagewood. “Too much strangeness already,” he’d croaked. “Don’t need a stranger bringing more shadows.” Mother agreed, her lips tight. “Rootless folk walk paths we don’t understand, son. They carry things best left unfound.” 



But Mellafin… she was different from the gritty, ragged rootless before her, or the broken families fleeing blights further out. She was young. Alone. And beautiful. Not like Lifflin’s cool, plant-like grace. Mellafin was… warm earth, sunlight caught in honeyed hair, eyes the colour of moss just after rain. Her shape beneath her simple woven tunic… curves that promised softness, ripeness, a heat the village sorely lacked. Or so the rumor quickly spread. I had yet to see for myself.



She kept coming back, moon after moon. Patient. Never pushing. She had things we needed – remedies that cooled fevers, spices that woke up the dull taste of stored roots, salts scraped from faraway caves. Father went once, desperate, when Mother burned with the screaming sickness. Mellafin gave him a tea, dark and fragrant. Mother slept sound, woke clear. After that, the suspicion didn’t vanish, but it softened. The men started going out to trade, one by one. Mellafin insisted. “A lone woman,” she’d said, her voice soft as petals, “facing a group of strong men? I wouldn’t feel safe. You understand.” It made sense. She could be robbed of her stash. Or her dignity. So they went alone. Traded tools, carvings, some made from our finest antlers, even flowers – the pale blue Whisper Vetch that grows only near Lifflin’s roots. Mellafin prized those. “Remind me of a place I lost,” they told me she’d said.



The elders finally offered her space inside the clearing, near the edge. But she refused, polite but firm. Smiled that heart-stopping smile. “Too many strangers here,” she’d said, gesturing to the village men. “From my side, you see? A lone woman feels safer keeping her own fire. Can’t be a goat penned with wolves, even friendly ones.” Sounded wise. Didn’t stop the men from looking, though. Didn’t stop me.



I had to see her up close. Had to know if the breathless whispers were true. Mother needed more fever tea. A good excuse. I managed to find some Whisper Vetch. The clearing nearly picked clean, save for the area near Lifflin where no one would dare. Mellafin’s camp felt… different. Cleaner than the forest floor, the air scented faintly with unknown blossoms and woodsmoke. And she… she was luminous. Close up, her skin seemed to catch light that wasn’t there. Her moss-green eyes held mine, a spark of warmth in their depths. Her fingers brushed mine as she took the flowers. A jolt, sharp and sweet, shot up my arm. She gave me the tea, and a pinch of salt that tasted like lightning on the tongue.



I found reasons after that. Traded my first spring-hardened carving-a dire bear-for spices that made the pheasant taste like sunshine. Shared them with Bran’s family at the feast; I remember his sister excitement, and her smile of gratitude. Didn't look at her too long lest her father notice. But glad she got to taste that before the accident... Mellafin started calling me by name. Smiled just for me, it felt like. Asked about my training with Father, praised my strengthening arms. I started to think… maybe I was her favourite.



Then, last moon, came the strange request. She leaned close, her scent like crushed berries and damp earth filling my head. Her voice dropped to a whisper. Could I do her a favour? A secret task? She pressed a small, smooth, dark stone into my palm. It felt unnaturally cold. “A seed of sorts,” she murmured. “It needs nurturing. Could you bury it for me? Near the Heartwood, Lifflin’s great tree. Not too close, but deep, just shy of her canopy.” Her eyes held mine, serious now. “And… water it. Just once. With fresh goat blood. A small cupful, from the butcherings. An old Rootless blessing, for the health of the soil, the flourishing of the community.”



My stomach twisted. Burying a strange stone near Lifflin’s sacred heartwood? Watering it with blood? It felt deeply wrong. A violation. “Why?” I stammered. She sighed, a soft sound. “Your village feels... precarious. The animals born wrong, the lack of young life… This is a way to ask the earth for balance. A gesture of hope.” She smiled then, that soft, captivating smile. “Think of it as… planting a seed of good fortune. For all of us.”



For all of us. It sounded… helpful. Maybe even necessary. But the wrongness lingered. Until I thought of Bran. Saw him strutting past the well after his last visit to Mellafin, touching his cheek, a smug, secret smile playing on his lips. Heard the whispers – Mellafin had kissed him. Kissed Bran! What could he possibly have offered? He carves like he’s chopping wood, his family has nothing. Well except for his sister that they guarded from all of us boys like fire ants guard their mother. The jealousy burned like swallowed coals. If Bran earned a kiss… what could I earn by doing this vital, secret task? More than a kiss. A touch? The thought of her soft bosom beneath my hands, the imagined warmth… it overshadowed the fear, the wrongness.



“I’ll do it,” I heard myself say, the words thick in my throat.



Stealing the blood was easy, a quick dip of a horn while the butcher argued over shares. Never use all of it for sausages anyway. Burying the stone that night felt like wading through thick water. The air near the Heartwood hummed, watchful. The earth gave way easily under the shovel I'd spring-hardened myself. I dug quick, dropped the cold stone in, poured the warm, sticky blood over it. It soaked in instantly, leaving a dark stain that seemed to pulse for a moment before fading into the moss. Felt like planting a piece of night in the heart of our home.



The night before Mellafin was due again, moonset had left the sky an inkwell spill of stars. I stepped outside the roundhouse to piss, the air cool and still. Something fluttered down from the blackness above, silent as owl flight. Landed softly near my feet. Glowing. A faint, pearly white light, pulsing gently like a captured heartbeat. I knelt, breath catching. A Moonpetal blossom. Perfect, five-petaled, radiating a cool luminescence. Elders told stories of them, flowers of high magic, found only on mist-shrouded peaks or atop the deep canopy, glowing with the very light of the moon herself. Never down here. I looked up. Nothing but moonless dark and faint stars. Then, a single, sharp caw drifted down. A blackbird? Had it dropped this?



My heart hammered. A sign? A reward? Dumb luck? I’d done the task, taken the risk. And now this. A treasure beyond reckoning. If I presented this to Mellafin… Forget Bran. Forget the others. This would prove my worth, my devotion. A kiss? A touch? No something more, surely. Tomorrow… maybe she’d let me stay by her fire, share her blanket… The thought sent fire through my veins. Carefully, reverently, I tucked the glowing blossom into a soft leather pouch, hiding its light.



Waiting felt impossible. I had my spear now, hard and true, leaning against the wall. I wasn’t a boy anymore. I wasn’t afraid of the dark path. That night, I would go to her. Find her camp. The Moonpetal’s glow would be breathtaking in the absolute dark. A perfect offering.



The forest felt different knowing I carried both spear and magic. Sounds seemed less threatening, shadows less deep. Her small fire flickered ahead, a welcoming spark. She sat beside it, humming softly, grinding something in a small stone bowl. She looked up as I approached, her smile immediate, radiant. “My brave hunter,” she murmured, her voice like warm honey. “Venturing out into the deep dark?”



My hand trembled as I reached for the pouch. “I brought you something,” I said, stepping into the firelight’s edge. “Something… rare.” I drew out the Moonpetal.



Its light bloomed, soft yet insistent, pushing back the orange flicker of the fire, bathing us both in its cool, silvery glow.



She gasped and recoiled, her hand flying up as if the tiny flower was a rattle adder poised to bite. “What is–?”



And in the pure light of the Moonpetal, I saw it. Truly saw it. The hand she held up wasn’t smooth and lovely. It was withered, greyish-green, the skin stretched tight over sharp, knotted knuckles. Long fingers, tipped with thick, curving claws like shards of black flint.



Breath hitched in my throat. I stumbled back, dropping the Moonpetal onto the moss between us. Where its light touched her, the illusion shattered – the clawed hand, the hint of something predatory beneath her beautiful face. Where the firelight still flickered on her other side, she remained Mellafin, warm and inviting. Two beings in one form.



Her expression shifted, the warmth vanishing like mist. Replaced by something cold, sharp, furious. She raised the withered hand, the claws flexing. For a terrifying second, I thought she would strike me.



Then, a sound. Not from her lips, but ripping through the air around us. A harsh, guttural cawing noise, morphing sickeningly into garbled speech. Human speech. "Kaa… Kaa… Grinalin… Grinalin… Kaa!" Her eyes widened, a flicker of confusion, even fear, crossing her beautiful face before the predatory mask slammed back down.



I didn’t think. Turned and ran. Scrabbling backward first, then spinning and plunging into the absolute darkness beyond her fire, my spear forgotten on the ground. Crashing through ferns, stumbling over roots, the sound of that awful cry and the image of that clawed hand burning behind my eyes. I didn’t stop until I burst back into the familiar dimness of our clearing, gasping for breath, heart hammering against my ribs like a trapped bird.



I didn't dare to retrieve my spear until high-sun, after the moon had risen again. The camp was gone without a trace. As if it never existed. And Mellafin didn't return. Not that moonset. Not the next. She was gone.



Life settled back into its uneasy rhythm. Father clapped me on the shoulder, proud of the three spears I had made. "Right balance. Light enough to throw half across the clearing" he commended. We gave them to the younger boys. For the better, I was now convinced. Our clearing home may be weird, but there are stranger things out there. Scary things. Good spears ease the nerves. The more the better.



The blackbirds still watch and caw. Perched on every roundhouse some days, scaring the pheasants nervous. Another goat bore twisted young. No baby girl born. I never told anyone what I saw. Who would believe it? They’d blame me for sneaking out, for seeking her out alone after dark. Maybe they’d think I’d angered her, driven her away. They are mad about it. Thirsty. Not the kind of thirst the well water can quench.
