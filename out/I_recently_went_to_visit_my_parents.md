I recently went to visit my parents. 

They still live in my childhood home.

The house sits at the end of our block in a cul-de-sac.

Unlike a lot of houses in my old neighborhood, it demands attention with its lopsided appearance, large size, and ancient Victorian architecture. 

My parents bought it before I was born, refurbished it, and moved in just as my mother was going into labor with me.

Ever since I was little, I had an “off” feeling about the place. Long shadows filled the halls. Strange noises weren’t uncommon at late hours. Night terrors disturbing beyond my years plagued my sleep.

On multiple occasions, when I was in grade school, I experienced deep feelings of dread both day and night being in the house, and so did my friends, apparently. We never hung out at my place, which was just fine with me.



It’s strange, because most people tend to hold memories of their childhood homes close to their hearts. 

I don’t.



Schoolkids and adults alike always gossiped about our house.

Creepy and offputting.

Some might even say ‘haunted’.

I always believed there might have been some truth to what they said—and this recent trip—



We had just finished dinner.

Baked chicken, beans, rice, asparagus, very good.

As my parents and I walked through the windowless corridors, I remember being drawn toward the distantly familiar yellow wallpaper that made up almost every wall of the damned structure. The paper’s pattern consisted of a vertical bar wrapped in vines, brown flower etchings that stacked on top of one another, reaching all the way to the ceiling. 

That continuous bar-flower pattern would repeat, trailing into maddening repetition. 

Hideous.

We were winding through parts of the manor I didn’t recognize.

Finally, we arrived at an old room. The room, a barely-used guest suite, had one window, one dresser, and one bed. 

An old leather teddy bear was perched on the dresser. 

I sat my luggage down and slumped onto the bed as my parents walked away. I vividly remember the summer evening’s sun shining through the window as I unpacked my suitcase.



After settling in, I registered how nasty I felt after such a long day. 

It was dark out by this point.

I took my toiletries to the bathroom next to my room.

Annoyingly, you had to exit the bedroom and *then* use an access door from the hall to get to the bathroom. The two rooms were adjacent. 

Why weren’t they connected? Who knows.

 

As a matter of fact, I never recalled seeing the bathroom before that day.

Growing up, I had always lived in a bedroom situated towards the front of the house, a door away from my parent’s room, actually.

The rest of the house was unfamiliar to me.

Even my childhood curiosity had understood that exploring the manor was a dumb idea.

On top of that, my parents were quick to forbid me from wandering.

Both my parents and I had an emotional understanding, but not a true understanding of why.



I undressed myself to get into the shower. The tub was an antique porcelain whatnot with brass feet designed to look like claws holding glass orbs. A modern shower head and faucet knobs had obviously been installed at some point during renovation.

Anyways.

Something strange happened when I turned on the faucet. The sound of the aging backed-up pipes echoed through the walls. I hadn’t even pulled up the shower trigger yet. Red-stained water started spraying in random directions from the faucet. I thought at first that *because* my parents lived on the other side of the house, the plumbing had simply been neglected, causing a buildup of rust or debris. 

I was more so confused when the pressure eventually released, and a piece of pink muscley meat fell from the faucet, into the tub. 

It looked like a slimy piece of raw chicken. 

I remember being taken aback, confused and disgusted. 

The faucet continued to gurgle, releasing more contaminated water until it started to turn clear. I stood in the tub, cold, staring at the slab of flesh.

I figured that some animal must’ve been caught up in the pipes. 

I disposed of the meat in the toilet, flushed the toilet with my foot, washed my hands, then stepped back into the tub, turning on the faucet for a few minutes to let the hot water flush the pipes out. 

I showered, got dressed, and tucked myself into bed. 

I sat on my phone for a while, scrolling through Snapchat mindlessly. 

As time passed, that sense of dread that I had always gotten staying up late at night as a child crept back into my life. I glanced up at that leather teddy bear. 

Beady glass eyes. 

I eventually fell asleep.



I woke up in the middle of a peaceful sleep. My phone read 2 AM. My entire body was in a cold sweat. I covered myself so the only thing uncovered by the heavy pink blankets was my face.



I relaxed for a while, trying to fall back asleep.



Screaming, like a woman going through childbirth, rang from the bathroom. The cries were intertwined with a frantic gargling sound. I remember tensing up and lying still. 

The fear of the situation disappeared when I realized that my mother might’ve hurt herself in the bathroom.

I got out of bed and walked out of my room, going to the shut bathroom door. The screaming had stopped before I went in. I opened the door to a single warm-colored lightbulb illuminating the room. 



Reader, what you are about to read is up to your interpretation. If you can help me find out what happened; hallucinations, a waking dream, sleepwalking, food-poisoning, ANYTHING; please tell me.



The bathtub was full of blood. The entire room stank of what I can best describe as a mixture of raw meat, fried fish filets, and hand soap. All of that combined with the offputting dark red paint on the walls made me sick.

The entire situation felt like it was designed to be nauseating.

This was coupled with that strange, empty late-night panging in my stomach. 

The blood in the tub was being disturbed the slightest bit. 

A long cut of pink raw meat, strands of fat attached to it, twitched its way up the side of the tub, making a wet squinching noise. As it did this, something round bobbed up to the surface of the viscous red. It appeared to me as a skinless human head. It had no eyes, and its toothy mouth was gaped open, thick blood running between its teeth into the tub. I could make out the details of multifaceted tendrils of muscle from where I was. It was floating sideways, and while I was staring at it, the flesh chunk slapped onto the tile, splattering blood and other fluids onto the floor. It twitched, its muscles firing at random, creating small indentations on its slimy surface. 

I threw up the remnants of my dinner onto the floor. The meat thing was crawling towards me. The head still bobbed sideways in the blood. I came to my senses and started running. I ran through the halls until my head hit something hanging down from the ceiling with a *crack*, and I blacked out.



I woke up the next morning. My parents stood by my bed. I sat up and looked at them. They comforted me and explained what had happened last night after I hit my head. 

It went something along the lines of this.



“We woke up in the middle of the night to a loud bang from your side of the house,” my mother said, “When we went to go look, we found you unconscious in the hall. Your head was hurt, so we patched it up and took you to bed the best we could. On our way there, we passed by your bathroom. We found a pile of vomit in there, the tub was also running. I turned off the faucet and cleaned the mess up. What happened last night, Sammy?”



Even though my mom was no stranger to less-than-normal household disturbances, I made something up.

“I woke up, got sick from a night terror, and panicked, I guess. It’s all a blur,” I replied.



“It’s funny that you mention night terrors now, because you used to have them all the time,” my dad chimed in.



“Yep. Strange,” My mom had said, so nonchalantly.



My father did a short concussion test on me, then they left.



Later that afternoon, I packed my stuff, gave my parents an excuse that I was feeling sick, and left.



It took a long time of processing and acceptance for me to be able to write this story in such vivid detail.

Truth be told, I avoided eating meat for about a month after the encounter, and still have trouble stomaching it.

To this day, I have no satisfying explanation for what happened that night.

It was straight out of a horror film.



My best explanation; food poisoning, combined with a really, *really* bad waking dream based on what happened before my shower.

How I hit my head, I still don’t know.



If anyone has ever experienced a vivid hallucination like this before, it would be nice to hear in the comments what you think might’ve happened that night.



Thanks for reading.

Until next time, find peace—
