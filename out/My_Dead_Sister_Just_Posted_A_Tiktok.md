My sister passed away two years ago in a terrible car accident. According to the autopsy report, she died on impact. It was a devastating blow to our family, and the pain still lingers. We’ve tried to move on, but her absence is a constant reminder of that tragic day. Recently, while scrolling through social media after work, I noticed something that made my heart skip a beat. My sister's profile picture had been updated. It had changed from our old dog, who died about five months after my sister's accident, to our new puppy, which we got just last week.

At first, I thought it must be a glitch or some kind of cruel joke. But the more I looked at it, the more real it seemed. The profile picture was definitely changed, and there was no denying it was our new puppy. Confused and creeped out, I decided to ask my mother about it. She was in the kitchen, preparing dinner, and when I brought it up, she seemed genuinely puzzled. She said she knew nothing about it and suggested maybe someone had hacked the account. Still feeling unsettled, I tried to push the thought out of my mind and spent the rest of the night gaming on my computer, hoping the distraction would help.

The next morning, a Saturday, I woke up around 10. The sun was shining through the curtains, and feeling completely rested. I made myself some breakfast and, somehow forgetting about what happened the previous night, I opened TikTok while eating. The first video on my feed was from my sister's account. My heart dropped as I saw a slideshow of four photos of her and our new puppy. The images were clear, and they looked like they were taken recently. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. My hands started shaking, and I nearly dropped my phone.

Now, I was really freaking out. I had no idea what to do. I rushed to my mother again and showed her the video. She looked just as shocked as I felt. We sat down together, trying to figure out how this was possible. My sister’s account was supposed to be inactive. Who could have access to it? And how did they get these pictures? We hadn’t even posted any photos of the new puppy yet.

In a desperate attempt to find answers, I decided to message the account. I didn’t expect a reply, but it was worth a try. I typed out a simple message: "Who is this? How did you get these photos?" I hit send and stared at the screen, waiting. Minutes passed, and nothing happened. I felt a mix of relief and frustration.

Later that evening, as I was about to shut down my computer, I received a notification. Someone had replied to my message. My heart raced as I opened it. The reply was chilling: "It's me. I miss you." It was signed with my sister’s name. I felt a cold shiver run down my spine. Could this really be her? Was someone playing a sick prank, or was there something more sinister going on?

Unable to sleep, I spent hours researching anything that could explain what was happening. I read about haunted accounts, digital ghosts, and hacking incidents. But none of it seemed to fit. The next few days were a blur. I kept getting notifications from my sister's account, each one more unsettling than the last. Photos, messages, even videos. It was like she was trying to reach out from beyond the grave.

My mother and I finally decided to contact the authorities, but they were just as baffled. They suggested we delete the account, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. What if it really was my sister, trying to communicate? 

As I sit here now, typing this out, I’m filled with a mix of dread and hope. Dread because I don’t understand what’s happening. Hope because, maybe, just maybe, my sister is still out there somewhere, trying to reach us.
