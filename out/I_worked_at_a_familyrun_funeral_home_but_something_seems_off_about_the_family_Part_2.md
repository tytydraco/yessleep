I couldn’t sleep that night. The events I witnessed haunted me, swirling in my mind like a fever dream. The Eddison family was hiding something, a dark, twisted secret that went far beyond the macabre nature of their profession.

The next morning, I returned to the funeral home, determined to find answers. As I walked through the front door, everything felt different. 
Allison greeted me in the hallway, her smile as warm as ever. It was impossible to tell that she had been dead the night before, laid out cold on that metal slab.

“Good morning, Phillip,” she said, her voice bright and warm “I hope you’re settling in well.”
My mouth went dry, but I forced myself to respond. “Yeah… everything’s fine.”

As we talked, I couldn’t shake the feeling that her eyes were different. They had a glassy sheen, like a doll’s eyes—lifeless and artificial. Every word she spoke seemed rehearsed, as if she was merely playing a role.

“I was thinking,” she continued, “you should join us for dinner tonight. It would be good to have everyone together.”

I nodded, unable to refuse. “Sure. I’d like that.”

The day dragged on with excruciating slowness. Every corner I turned, every door I opened, I half-expected to stumble upon another horrifying secret. Patrick and Fergal were their usual unsettling selves, but there was something else—an undercurrent of anticipation as if they were waiting for something.

As evening fell, I found myself seated at the long dining table in a dimly lit dining room. The table was set with fine china and polished silverware, and a feast was laid out before us. Mr. Eddison sat at the head of the table, with Debra on his right and Allison on his left. Patrick and Fergal were across from me, their eyes glinting in the candlelight.

The meal was surreal. Everyone was too cheerful, too perfect; their movements synchronized as if they were performing a well-practised play. The conversation flowed easily, but I could feel the tension beneath the surface.

“The dinner looks amazing, Debra,” I said. I looked around the table as everyone started to eat theirs, too scared to touch mine. 
“Do you mind if I use the bathroom,” I hesitantly asked. 

Mr Eddison shot me a cold look as if I had committed a mortal sin. 

“Course you can, my dear. It's upstairs to the right,” said Debra. 

As I made my way up the stairs I noticed the family pictures that line the wall. Most were in black and white as if taken in some bygone era. It was pictures and portraits of the family that seemed to span different generations of time.  

I made my way down a long corridor. As I looked for the bathroom I came across a steel door that seemed out of place to the rest. On the other side of the door, there was a spiral staircase that seemed to descend endlessly into a dark abyss. 

The pungent smell of pickles grew stronger as I neared the end of the stairs. My gut was telling me to turn back, but my curiosity pushed me further into the darkness. My heart was beating with nervous apprehension until I made it to the end.  

I came to a large dark room hidden behind another steel door. When I flicked on the light I gasped loudly at the sight of faceless bodies held in glass cabinets. 

The expressionless bodies were like soulless blank canvases waiting to be brought to life. It was then I realized the reason behind Bobby’s miraculous transformation from a burnt corpse to a pristine copy of what he once looked like. 

“They’re magnificent, aren’t they.” said a voice from behind me. 

I turned to see Mr Eddison standing behind me. I could feel my legs start to tremble as his soulless black eyes burrowed into mine. 

“I need to know what’s happening here. I saw Allison last night in the embalming room, she was dead, but you brought her back. And Bobby… the body upstairs, it wasn’t him, was it?”

Mr. Eddison sighed deeply as if the weight of his secrets was finally bearing down on him. “I see you’ve seen more than we intended.”

“What are you doing to these bodies?” I demanded. “And what happened to the last employee? Why did he disappear?”

“Phillip, the Eddison family has a unique responsibility. The Method we use to preserve bodies is something passed down through generations. We don’t just prepare bodies for burial, we preserve them in ways no one else can.”

“What exactly is this Method?” I asked, my voice trembling.

He hesitated before answering. “It’s a process I developed many many years ago, based on an ancient technique invented by the Egyptians, but enhanced with modern chemistry. The fluid we use, it doesn’t just preserve; it rejuvenates, repairs, and, under certain circumstances… reanimates.”

“Reanimates?” I echoed, feeling a cold dread creeping up my spine.

“Yes,” he confirmed, his voice dropping to a whisper. “It can temporarily restore life, or a semblance of it, to the dead. But it’s not true life, Phillip. It’s more like… borrowing time from death. The bodies remain animated, but not for long. Each time we are brought back we lose a part of our soul. 

I recoiled, horrified. “Why would you do this? What’s the point?”

“To give families closure,” he replied, his voice steady. “We allow them to say goodbye in a way that provides comfort. They see their loved ones as they remember them, not as death left them. But that comes at a cost. The Method is powerful, but it’s dangerous. Sometimes, things don’t go as planned.”

Like with the last employee?” I asked. 

Mr. Eddison’s face hardened. “He grew too curious, just like you. He couldn’t accept what we were doing here. We tried to reason with him, but he threatened to expose us. He left us no choice.”

I felt a wave of panic. “What did you do to him?”

“He became part of the process,” Mr. Eddison said coldly. “We used the Method on him, but something went wrong. He became… unstable. We had to contain him.”

“Contain him?” I repeated, my mind racing. “Where is he?”

Mr. Eddison glanced toward the door. “He’s here, Phillip, but you don’t want to meet him.”

I took a step back, realizing the full extent of the horror I was dealing with. “I need to leave. I’m not staying here.”

“You can’t leave,” Mr. Eddison said, his voice firm. “You know too much now. We can’t let you go.”

I bolted for the door, but before I could reach it, Patrick and Fergal appeared, blocking my path. Their faces were eerily calm, devoid of the usual teasing grins.

“You’re not going anywhere, Phillip,” Patrick said, his voice cold.

“We have to take you downstairs,” Fergal added, his tone menacing.

I turned to run, but they grabbed me, their grips like iron. I struggled against them, but they were too strong. They dragged me down the hall, towards another room. 

They shoved me into the dimly lit room, filled with large glass tanks, each containing a body floating in a murky fluid. The air was thick with the stench of chemicals, and the low hum of machinery filled the space.

“This is where we perfect the process,” Patrick said, his voice echoing in the chamber.

“You'll get a chance to find out what happened to the last guy that worked here,” Fergal added, his tone devoid of emotion.

They pushed me toward an empty tank, but before they could force me inside, I lashed out, kicking Fergal in the knee. He stumbled, loosening his grip on me, and I took the opportunity to break free. I bolted for the door, my heart pounding in my chest.

“Get him!” Mr. Eddison’s voice roared from behind me.

I sprinted up the stairs, hearing the heavy footsteps of Patrick and Fergal close behind. As I reached the top, I slammed the door shut behind me and locked it, knowing it wouldn’t hold them for long.

I ran through the funeral home, desperate to find a way out. As I rounded a corner, I nearly collided with Debra, who stood in the hallway, her face pale and eyes wide with fear.

“Debra, please help me,” I begged. “They’re going to kill me!”

She hesitated, glancing down the hall toward the approaching footsteps of her sons. Then, without a word, she grabbed my arm and pulled me into a side room, quickly closing the door behind us.

“You have to get out of here,” she whispered urgently. “There’s a back exit through the embalming room.”

“Why are you helping me?” I asked, bewildered.

“I can’t let them do this to another person,” she said, her voice trembling. “Allison and I… we’ve been trapped in this nightmare for too long. We’ve had to watch as my husband’s obsession with the Method consumed him, and our family.”

“But Allison—” I started.

“She’s not truly alive,” Debra interrupted, tears welling in her eyes. “The Method keeps her functioning, but she’s not the daughter I once knew.

The door rattled as Patrick and Fergal pounded on it from the other side. “They’re coming, Phillip. You have to go now!” Debra urged.

I nodded, adrenaline surging through me as I followed her out the back of the room and into the embalming room. 

As I reached the door, I heard Allison’s voice behind me. “Phillip, wait!”

I turned to see her standing in the doorway, her once vibrant eyes now dull, her skin pale and lifeless. “Please don’t leave me here,” she whispered, her voice cracking with desperation.

For a moment, I hesitated. But then I remembered the bodies in the tanks, the horror of what this family had done—and what they planned to do to me. I couldn’t risk it. I couldn’t trust her.

“I’m sorry, Allison,” I said, choking back the guilt. “I can’t.”

With that, I pushed open the door and fled into the night. The sound of shouting and banging faded behind me as I ran as fast as I could, not daring to look back. My heart pounded and my breath came in ragged gasps, but I didn’t stop until I was far from the funeral home, the Eddison family, and their horrifying secrets.

When I finally reached the safety of my home, I collapsed onto the floor, shaking with relief and fear. I had escaped, but I knew the nightmare would haunt me for the rest of my life. The Eddison family was still out there, and so were their twisted methods.

As I lay there, gasping for breath, I realized one thing: I had to tell someone, anyone, what I had seen. I had to expose the Eddison family before they could claim another victim. But deep down, I knew it wouldn’t be easy. The Eddison family had kept their secrets for generations, and they wouldn’t let them go without a fight.

But I was determined. No one else would disappear into that darkness. Not if I could help it.
