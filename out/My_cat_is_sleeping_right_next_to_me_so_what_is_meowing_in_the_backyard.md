I’m so confused.  My cat is outside, pawing at the glass door leading to the backyard, but he’s right here. On my lap. It just meowed, that sounds like my cat but slightly off. Does my cat have a doppelgänger? Or is it a S-walker? I’ve heard stories peoples cats who got killed and replaced by those creatures which later killed the owner. Or maybe Inky is outside and the thing is next to me.

Okay so, inky heard the meow and he woke up. He looks completely like Inky, he has a shadow, his fur pattern is right, and his eyes look like a cats.

What the hell? Inky noticed the imposter Inky and now he’s going feral. He ran up to the door and is hissing and yowling like crazy. He’s a sweet little baby, he never does this!!

I’m not letting that thing inside.

Update: I locked me and inky the bathroom with a gun and knife and cat food for Inky jus in case and I heard glass shattering and shrieks. Inky is shakimg anf he also stopped yowling. He’s scared, like me.

Update again I put towels between the door cracks, conered the mirror and pushed the shelf tbats in the bagnroom against the dokr. I’m shaking like crazy so I’m making lots of soelling mistaked I’m so sorry but it’s screaming and breaking things I’m so scared, i hid inky in a cabinet with food and water just in case the creature breaks in.

Oh my fucking god it snelled us it’s gonna fucking break in. It’s banging against the door oh my god help me

I just called the cops but there’s no signal. I don’t know what to do inky is meowing again and trying to get out but I locked the cabinet so it can’t get him.

I have to be brave and kill it I have to. I’m Christian so I have a little holy water stored in every room I’m gonna take that and splash it on it and shoot the thing.

Fuck ing it stopped bangimg and is knocking on the door. It sounds like my mom and it’s trying to get me to let it in

Update I went outside and splashed to holy water on it and it started SIZZLING and shrieking, then it tried to lung at me but I shot it in the legs and then the head and then it’s torso a couple times. I think I killed it. Now I’m sitting in my car far away with inky and im gonna go to my moms house.

Now let me describe how it looked. It was absolutely hideous. It had a bald head and had to be at least 5’10. It’s skin was really pale and it’s rib cage was showing. It had yellow eyes and sharp yellow teeth. And it smiled. It fucking smiled right before it died and said to me “I’ll be back.”

It also scratched me and it bleeding really bad so im going to the hospital after this. Inky was unharmed thankfully.

I’ll update you if something happens.









This was my first story on Reddit and I tried to make the typing seem rushed and panicked so sorry about the misspelling.
By the way this is completely fictional, not real in ANY way.
