I got into work one day a couple weeks ago, only to find some random guy under my desk, sitting in what seemed to be a state of utter shock, or extreme panic.

See, when I got into the office, a few other employees had already arrived and were standing by the front reception area muttering on about the mess. Our office is on the 6^(th) floor of a large office tower. I had gotten off the elevator, which was functional, but had some damage on the button console. I walked through the hall to our office, noticing that the door to the stairwell looked like it had been thrown open, leaving a small, doorknob-sized hole in the wall. When I got to our office door, the buzzer was smashed in and there were scratches all over the steel door, exposing the raw metal underneath the paint. It was obvious that someone had gotten into the building and was attempting to break into our office for whatever reason. The only things worth stealing were a couple of dozen not-so-new stationary computers and maybe the espresso machine in the conference room. It was evident that whoever was trying to get in failed to do so, seeing as there was no sign of break-in…aside from the random guy under my desk.

I picked the phone up off the floor and placed the handset back in its cradle to silence the constant dual-toned fast-beep. I hadn’t heard that sound in a long time and didn’t even think the digital phones had that capability. Usually they just “hang up” on their own after some time off the hook. I knelt down and asked the guy if he was okay, but he didn’t speak, or even blink his eyes. He just sat there shaking uncontrollably and breathing as if he had just finished the Boston Marathon. I reached out to touch his arm, but as soon as I made contact, he let out a blood-curdling scream and swatted my hand away. I stood up and my coworker, Brian, had run over to see what was going on. I asked if anyone had called 9-1-1 yet, and he said they did as soon as they got in and noticed things were off. They hadn’t even noticed the guy under my desk. I pointed at him and Brian stumbled back in fear.

“I need to call Susan,” the man repeated over-and-over after the paramedics were finally able to get him out from under my desk. They were trying to get him to say anything else about who he was or why he was there, but he persisted, “I need to call Susan!”. One of the medics shrugged and grabbed my desk phone, handing it over to the guy, but he waved it off. “That thing doesn’t work. I already tried it.” So the medic pulled his cell phone out of his pocket, unlocked it, and handed it to the guy. He looked at the device for several seconds before dropping it to the floor. “That one won’t work either. I need to charge my phone.” I pointed to my desk, which had a charging cable connected to my desktop computer. The guy turned around, plugged his phone in, and then stood there completely still, watching as the phone sat lifeless. After a couple minutes, the screen flickered on, showing that it was starting to take charge. After several minutes of waiting in complete silence, the medic said, “I think you might be able to power it on now and try it.” The guy waved his hand and said, “Not yet.” The medic shrugged and turned to his partner, whispering something in his ear. I watched as the phone’s screen flickered on and off several times, as if it was having trouble charging. We must have waited another ten or so minutes before the guy finally picked up the phone and tried turning it on. It buzzed, indicating that it was booting up, but the screen just continued to flicker on and off. The guy was shaking a bit still, and was mumbling something under his breath.

“Hello? Susan? Can you hear me?” The guy insisted that his phone was the only one that would work, but it didn’t seem to be working at all. He pressed her name several times, waiting for the sound to indicate it was connecting, but the sound never came. There was only silence. One time, it faintly sounded like it might start the call, but it was buzzing in and out, as if there was some interference. That was when he started yelling into the phone, hoping she would be on the other side hearing him. After several minutes of that, the medics, probably out of sheer impatience, told the guy he would have to go with them, and they could try again later. He started screaming at them about how he was never going to be able to leave. He shouted something about a cab ride and driving for miles, only to end up back at his office. It was totally incoherent, or so it seemed to all of us. That was when we all heard the words coming from his phone, staticky, like it was coming from space. “Fred? \*buzz\* Fred?! \*buzz\* Are you there?!” He held the phone up to his ear and yelled, “Susan! I’m here!” but there was nothing but static coming through. He shouted a few more times, but after several minutes of static, there were no more responses from who we all assumed was Susan.

The medics were about to restrain Fred and drag him out when he started telling them what happened. I was trying not to make it obvious that I was eavesdropping, but I had to know. He told this crazy story about how he had stayed at work late because he was mad at his wife, even after she had warned him that something bad was going to happen. He ignored her, if only to spite her. He worked until midnight, only to find out his car was dead and when he called for cab, the driver disappeared. He stole the cab and tried finding his way home, but got lost and somehow ended back up at his office building. But everything seemed off. The night guard wasn’t at his desk, but when the lights flickered, he was there, but something was off. There was some thing walking around, dragging something behind it. It chased him up the stairs and to the office. That was when he typed his story, explaining what happened so his wife wouldn’t worry. But he was unable to send it because the internet was shut off for some reason.

Fred thought he had fallen asleep eventually, but when he woke up, everything was different. None of the phones would work for him and the internet was still out. That was when I walked to my computer and unlocked it. Everything looked normal, except there was an email draft opened – it was as if someone went on a drug-addled rambling tirade. Not much made sense, as the words were a jumbled mess. The guy turned and looked at the screen, his face dropping in disbelief. “That is NOT what I wrote!” He insisted that his message was clear and explained everything in great detail. The only thing that was coherent in the entire message was the very end: “Love you always, Fred”. I shrugged and closed the draft.

The medics managed to finally talk Fred into leaving with them. They helped him walk out, both holding one arm each. I watched out the front windows, looking down as the ambulance drove away, sirens blaring. I went back to my desk and was about to start working on one of my many projects when I remembered the draft. I clicked on it so I could delete it, but when the preview popped up, it was suddenly different. Some of the words were still jumbled, but most of it was legible. I started reading it, but as I browsed through the paragraphs, words were flickering and letters moving around. I rubbed my eyes, thinking maybe I was just coming into a migraine, but it continued flickering and moving. I hit the delete key on my keyboard and the draft disappeared. I got up and walked into the kitchen to get some water when I heard the sirens come back down the street and stop in front of the building.

As I walked back to my desk, I suddenly felt what could only be described as an instant rush of static. I quickly sat down in a chair and noticed that I was now the only one left in the office. I looked at the computer on the desk I was sitting at and it said it was midnight. I sat in disbelief for a minute, wondering how I somehow managed to lose about thirteen hours in an instant.

There was loud banging on the side door of the office, so I got up and walked over to crack the door open. I looked out and Fred was standing there, drenched in sweat, and shouting at me to let him in. I moved my foot from the door and opened it. He ran in and shoved the door out of my hands, closing it and locking it. He put his hands on his knees as he crouched there, breathing heavily. I asked what was going on and he pulled me over to my desk.

“We got into the ambulance and drove off. I didn’t know where they were taking me, but after only a few minutes, they stopped and wouldn’t move any further. They wouldn’t speak to me or even look at me. So, I got out and looked around. I had a familiar feeling of panic rush over me, so I went up to the driver’s side door only to find nobody in the cab of the truck. I knew then that everything was wrong again. I got in and drove off, trying to get out of this place – out of the city. I literally drove straight ahead, away from this building, but after about ten or so minutes, I was right back in front of this building. I broke down in tears before coming back inside. As I waited for the elevator, I heard it. Again. The dragging. The scraping. The clicking of…shoes? Boots maybe. It was all happening again.”

That’s when the bell started ringing at the front office door. Fred looked down and muttered, “not again.” I took a few steps toward the door when Fred said, “don’t go, don’t look.” For some reason, I trusted Fred, so I sat down with him. We sat in silence, well, our own silence, while the bell continued to ring, over and over, for what felt like hours. I checked the time again, only to find that the clock on my computer still said midnight. I looked at Fred and before I could open my mouth, he shrugged, as if he already knew what I was going to say. After some time, not that I could tell how much, I started feeling drowsy and must have drifted off.

I woke up, still sitting at my desk, but I was alone. And it was dark. I moved my mouse, waking up the screen and blasting my eyes with the bright image of a meadow…some lame built-in image that Microsoft decided I wanted to see. The time read 4:56 AM. Fred was nowhere to be seen, and it was quiet. But normal quiet. I could here the distant hum of some HVAC system running, as well as the whir of the computer fans on all the desks around me. I thought about getting up and just going home for the day, but decided I would just stay and get some work done, since I basically missed all of the previous day due to Fred and his…antics?

Sometime a few hours later, I heard a small beep at the front door and then heard it unlatch and open. Brian came walking in, whistling some tune. He stopped in the kitchen to put his lunch in the fridge and then noticed I was at my desk, so he walked over. “You’re here early. What happened to you yesterday?” I gave him a look of confusion. “You just kind of disappeared after that weird guy was taken away.” I shrugged, as I had no idea what he was talking about. As far as I knew, I had never even left the office, not even to go to the bathroom. I was a little freaked out at that point and said I wasn’t feeling well and needed to go home. Brian said he would cover for me, so I left for the day.

I still don’t know what happened, who Fred was, or why I apparently disappeared for half the day. As far as I could tell, everything seemed normal until Fred came back. Two days after the events had transpired, I looked in the drafts folder of my emails after noticing an unsent message that was saved during the time Fred and I were together that night. Again, it was mostly incoherent and jumbled, except for the very last line, which read, “I hope you got out, Fred.” Strangely, the next day after I found that, it was marked as read, even though it was never sent. I can only assume that someone with access to my email found the message and read it. I hope it was Fred, but somehow, I don’t think it was him. Just a feeling.
