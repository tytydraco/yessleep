Has anyone ever had those weird lightning dreams that hit you in the 5 minutes between pressing the snooze button on your alarm and it going off again?  Well I get those pretty regularly, and most of the time, they're pretty strange.

This morning, my wife's alarm went off at 5:15 so she could go to the gym before work.  I'm not typically a morning person, so I was planning to go after work myself. Anyway, I was awake and we talked while she got ready before we said our morning prayers and I sent her off.  I didn't feel like it would be worth going back to sleep, so I decided to just sit in bed and scroll on my phone until my alarm went off at 6:15.  About 30 minutes after my wife had left, my phone rang.  It was the police.  My wife had been in a car accident on the way to the gym and was dead.  I jumped out of bed and ran for the front door, only when I opened it, I was suddenly back  in bed again. 

It was a dream, and I had, in fact, fallen asleep again.

As I was still coming back to reality, I could hear my wife pulling into the driveway, so I went to the front door to meet her. When she came in, she was talking to someone on the phone and looked pretty distraught.  I couldn't hear what the other person was saying, but my wife's responses indicated that whatever was going on wasn't good.

“What do you mean?”

”Okay, well, what did she say?”

“So then what's gonna happen?”

When she hung up, my wife let out a big sigh.

“Everything okay?” I asked.

“No, apparently something happened at my parents’ church and now there's this huge fallout.”

“Are we talking like a scandal or something?”

“I don't know, but apparently word is getting out and it's probably gonna make the news, so my mom is worried that it's gonna make everyone there look bad.”

“Well, can we do anything to help?”

Before she could answer, I felt a sudden pressure on my thigh, and I suddenly snapped awake again to find myself back in bed.  My cat had squeezed through the crack in the door to the hallway and was now loafing on top of me. I shook my body and she skittered off.  

I heard the front door open, but I was hesitant to get out of bed this time.  After a few seconds, my wife stormed into the bedroom, absolutely covered in white paint.

“Holy cow, what happened?” I asked.

“Well you know how they're building that gate on the street into the neighborhood?”

“Yeah, of course.”

Our entire HOA had recently pooled together for that project.  As HOAs go, it wasn't insane like some of the stories you hear.  Really all it was good for was street maintenance or paying to clear a fallen tree after a storm.  There was a small park at the back of the neighborhood that was meant to be for residents only, but people who weren't came in all the time.  There had been a few instances where people had a full-on cookout and left the entire place a mess. Since it was technically a private park, us residents were the ones who had to clean it all up. I personally didn't care either way, but I certainly wasn't a fan of the people who came flying off of the main road into the neighborhood, and a gate would put a stop to that particular problem too.

“Well I was coming back from the gym” my wife continued as she peeled off her formerly black lulu lemons that now looked like a dairy cow hide, “and when I turned into the neighborhood, there were all these hooligans standing in the street where they're building that gate, like they were protesting, because God forbid they go to a different park.”

“Okay?” 

Real supportive, I know.

“Well I rolled down the window to ask them to move out of the way so I could come home, and they threw a cup of paint at me, like I'm the problem”

As she climbed into the shower, my next thought was what the inside of the car looked like.  It felt insensitive to ask, but thankfully I didn’t have to, because I heard the doorbell ring.

I woke up in bed yet again, now more annoyed than confused.  The doorbell rang a second time, but I noticed that the chime didn’t sound like it normally did.  We have one of those smart camera doorbells with a digital chime plugged into the wall, but this sounded more like a traditional bell.  Stranger still, it sounded more like the ring was coming from outside in the front yard more than it did from in the house.  Naturally, I grabbed the pistol that I keep on my bedside before heading to the front door to investigate.

Unfortunately, the cat had beat me there. She had recently figured out how to open lever-style doorknobs, and wouldn't you know, that's the kind we have on the front door.  Standing just beyond the threshold were two elderly women, dressed up like they were going to an Easter Sunday service. One was holding a stack of fliers and the other carried 2 small hay bales like the ones you buy at a craft store.

“Whatever it is, I'm not interested,” I said as I held the gun at my side.  They didn't seem to notice it, or they did and just didn't care.

“Oh we don't mean to be a bother”, the lady on the right said through a toothy smile. “We just want to ask you a couple quick questions.”

“No thanks,” I said as I walked forward to shut the door. “You need to leave.”

“Come on, now, dear,” the lady on the left began. “It'll be no trouble at all.”

For whatever reason, I paused holding the door about halfway open.

“You have ten seconds” I said flatly.

“Well, we're just going through the neighborhood-”

“Don't care.”

I slammed the door shut and turned the deadbolt.  

I reached for my phone to call my wife, but realized I had left it in the bedroom, so I went to grab it and dialed her number while returning to the entryway. When I got to the front door, I looked out of the fanlight window to see if I could spot the two old ladies, only to find my entire front patio absolutely covered in fall decor.  I'm talking dried corn stalks, pumpkins, decorative gourds, the works.  And of course, there were several of the small, craft store hay bales scattered about too.  This disturbed me for a number of reasons: first was that the two women were nowhere to be seen. Second was that the patio had, up until now, been devoid of any decorations aside from the wicker table set and a few dried leaves that blew in from the yard.  Third of all, it's the middle of March.

My phone rang, and I stirred from my slumber yet again, back in bed.  It was my wife, probably calling to see if I was up and getting ready.

“Hello?” I said warily.

“Hey I'm almost home,” I heard my wife say. “Can you come help me?”

I figured she had stopped in at the grocery store across from the gym and needed help bringing in bags.  That wasn't out of the ordinary, but I still wasn't going to take any chances at this point, so I grabbed my gun for real this time and tucked it into my waistband before heading for the door. 

Just as I walked outside, I saw my wife's car coming down the street.  As she pulled into the driveway, I heard a commotion over the rise in the road that she had just come over herself, and I looked just in time to see a horde of children come scrambling down the road toward our house.  They all looked between the ages of 5 to about 8, and every one of them wore dirty, torn clothes and were covered in grime and filth.  Before my wife could get out of the car, about 20 of them surrounded her car while the rest began romping around in the front yard, wrestling with each other, throwing rocks back and forth, and so on.  The children around the car were equally as rambunctious, but didn't seem to have any hostile intent or desire to actually get inside the car, they were simply blocking my wife from getting out.

I had the fleeting thought to start popping off rounds at the children, but a brief return to reason (or perhaps lapse in reason) led me to put the safety back on.  Besides, what were 8 bullets going to do against 50 feral children?

I should have grabbed my AR instead.

I rushed outside and began shooing the kids off, and a few scurried away into the empty lot next to our house.  As I reached the car and grabbed the handle to the door, I heard the loud rumbling of a massive vehicle coming down the road.  Sure enough, a big red dually rumbled over the hill and pulled into the driveway.  It had an excessive lift kit, and LED strips covering nearly the entire undercarriage as well as the rims. 

You know, a Bro Dozer.

A man looking like he had just come from a Limp Bizkit concert stepped (more like fell) out of the driver side door and clambered over to me.

“Dude I am so sorry,” he said.

“Is this all you?” I asked, motioning to the swarm of rugrats in my front yard.

“It's hard to keep track of em all sometimes, you know?”

“I don't care,” I shot back. “You need to get them off my property.”

“You got it, Bro.”

As he started herding up the children, I opened the car door for my wife and helped her out.

“Get inside,” I said.

She went into the house without a word.  A long white van pulled up on the street in front of my house, and the man started ushering the children inside.  I turned on my gun's flashlight and began walking around my house to check for any stragglers.  The left side was clear, and so was the backyard, but as I came around the right side of the house that faces that empty lot, I heard a rustling in the brush.  I moved my light in the direction of the noise and saw two of the kids ducking out from behind a fallen tree.

“You can't be here,” I shouted sternly.

They scurried off towards the van, and as they did, I noticed that they both had a mass of thick vines growing across their back and wrapping around their limbs.

Once the van drove off and the truck pulled out of the driveway, I went back inside and locked the door.  My wife was standing there in the entryway, waiting for me.

“Did that really just happen?” I asked.

“Are you serious? Why would you even ask that?” she replied.

“Well I know this sounds crazy, but I've kept on waking up this morning from different dreams that have gotten progressively weirder.”

“What do you mean?”

“Well first I thought you died in a car accident on your way home, then there was apparently a huge scandal at your mom's church, then you had a bucket of paint dumped on you by some protestors, and in the last one these two old ladies basically broke in to sell me hobby lobby hay bales and I almost shot them.”

She smirked.

“Really?”

“And then,” I continued, “I wake up to find our yard infested with dozens of feral children.”

My wife's face suddenly looked puzzled.

“What are you talking about?” she asked with confusion.

“Really? Did you not just see 50 ratty kids outside?”

“Babe, I didn't see any kids.”

“Are you serious right now?”

“Those weren't kids outside.  To me, they all looked like demons.”

A pounding on the front door woke me up again, and I could hear the voice of my wife calling out for me to come open it and let her in.  I grabbed my phone to check the time, and it hadn't been long enough for her to go to the gym and come back yet. Besides, she would have had the car keys, meaning she would have had a house key as well. 

I reached for the gun yet again when i felt my phone buzzing in my other hand.

It was a text message from my wife.

“I'm on my way home.”
