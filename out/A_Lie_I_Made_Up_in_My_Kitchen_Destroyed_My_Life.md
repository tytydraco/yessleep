In 2021, I was deeply involved in the crypto world. I ran a 7-megawatt mining farm, operated a swap service, and life was going great—until, out of nowhere, everything collapsed.

My farm was seized, my site went offline, and a wave of chaos swept into my life like it had been meticulously planned. That year, I was living alone. One evening, while smoking under the kitchen hood, I suddenly heard the familiar sound of a Skype call *coming from inside the hood*. It was just a faint voice at first—my girlfriend talking to her friend. I froze.

At first, I thought I was hallucinating. But over the next few days and weeks, the voices became more frequent. They always seemed to be coming from somewhere nearby, like an upstairs neighbor who talked obsessively about me.

After three months of solitude and mental exhaustion, I broke. I started talking back—to the voices. I wasn’t sure if they were real or not, but I told myself: *“Let’s play along. Let’s bait them.”*

So I made something up. I said aloud that I had 20,000 Bitcoin hidden in the forest on a flash drive, reserved for my son. It was a complete lie—something I whispered into an empty apartment, alone.

But that lie... ruined everything.

From that moment on, things spiraled into the surreal. I was followed, threatened, manipulated. I lost \$19,000 USDT from my wallet under suspicious circumstances. My family didn’t believe anything I said. When I tried to explain the voices, or show the audio I recorded with my phone and a stronger microphone I later bought—they said I was insane.

Even when I used an audio spectrogram and identified familiar voices—my friends, my own name being discussed—no one cared. I even asked strangers on the street if they could hear what I was hearing. Some could. But anyone close to me said I was delusional.

Eventually, I was forcibly hospitalized—twice. Once for 4 days, another time for 14. A psychiatric file was opened, and I was labeled schizophrenic. But I had researched the diagnosis thoroughly. I didn’t match the criteria. I never hallucinated visually. I didn’t have disorganized thoughts. I had *clear*, repeating audio phenomena—specific voices, specific people, specific words I once said privately.

Then in February 2025, a friend called me and said:

> “Hey... I heard people saying you have 20,000 Bitcoin hidden somewhere?”

I froze. That lie. That *one line* I whispered in my kitchen four years ago. Something I never repeated, never typed, never shared—just said aloud in an empty room. That was the moment I knew for sure:

Someone had been listening all along.

Later, my own mother—after years of denial—confessed something terrifying. She and others *had heard my voice through strange means*... and someone had poured an enormous amount of money and effort over the years trying to find “the treasure” I spoke of.

Except there was no treasure. Not even a single Bitcoin left. I lost it all long ago, trusting the wrong people.

So here I am, in 2025, trying to rebuild from the wreckage of a lie I told to ghosts in the walls. A lie that turned into an obsession for strangers, that got me labeled insane, locked away, stripped of everything.

All because of a single moment.
A whisper in my kitchen.
A lie no one was ever supposed to hear.
