Today was the tipping point. For months, I've been working as a secretary at a small FBI office in Lancaster, a sleepy town on the outskirts of Los Angeles. My job as a secretary includes what you’d expect; phone calls, donut deliveries, but also a constant need to redirect old people to the police department. Believe it or not, the Bureau doesn’t care that your neighbor’s dog constantly barking. Despite the monotony, I've come to appreciate the stability of my job, something I’ve desperately needed as I approach my late twenties. But today didn’t include any of those things. Or maybe it did. That’s the problem, I can’t remember.

I arrived at the office and fired up the hissing Keurig coffee machine, and the next thing I knew, I was waking up in a daze as my boss wished me a happy weekend. This wasn't just a momentary lapse in memory induced by a boring day – no, it was a complete blackout. Poof. Gone in an instant and transported 8 hours in the future.

Strange things have been happening at the office for a while now, but they are becoming more frequent and severe. I hadn't told anyone because I knew no one would believe me. But today I’ve decided to share what’s been going on as I finally have some proof of the weird shit going on here.

After rubbing my eyes deeply from what felt like a long slumber I checked my desk for any clues about what happened. I woke my computer from sleep checking Outlook and Teams before shifting my gaze to my second monitor. That's when I saw the Word document, over 15 pages long, single-spaced. It was a detailed record of my activities, with time stamps down to the minute. The words on the page were familiar, but I couldn't remember typing them. As I read through the document, my heart raced faster with every line.

I’ve summarized the document below and omitted timestamps that seem irrelevant:

\[10:45 AM\] There’s an old man in a pink poncho sitting in the waiting room. I’ve asked him if he needed anything but he’s ignoring me. His eyes are glued to the wall as if he's waiting for something. Look, I’ve seen ‘California crazy’ but this is just bizarre... It’s not even raining out.

\[10:50 AM\] The Barley twins swung by and took an exaggerated double take in an eerie unison motion. When I asked them what was wrong, they said quote “Just checking if the smoking hot chick is back”. I told them what I’ve told them a thousand times; that my temp job replacing the old secretary is now permanent. They chuckled at my annoyance as they walked away, their eyes lingering on me a little too long. I could hear them complaining about not getting a female replacement and that I’m just not “fun”. I rolled my eyes and went back to reading my novel.

\[11:03 AM\] I swear the old man in the pink poncho is looking at me. In my peripheral vision, I can see his dark black eyes gazing at me. It's like he's studying me, waiting for me to make a move. But when I look up, he's back staring at the wall with an uncanny fixation. If he keeps it up, I’m going to have to ask him to leave.

\[12:35 PM\] The sound of a revving engine outside signaled the arrival of the FedEx driver yet again, demanding to know about 'the package'. Irritation bubbled inside me at the relentless daily visits from this delivery person. I couldn't tell if it was some twisted prank from the Barley twins or if the driver was genuinely delusional. I told her no, that we never will have a package for her, and that she’s frankly stupid for asking. She rolled her eyes, blew a bubble from her gum, and popped it before walking away.

\[12:36 PM\] The pink poncho man is gone.

\[12:44 PM\] Jenson swooped by and caught me by surprise. He had that gleeful childish smile on his face as he peered over my desk and asked “Waaaatttchhaaaaa doooinnngggg?”. I could tell he didn’t actually care but I mustered up a response.

“Uh, nothing, just cleaning out some--“.

“Hey so did you see any packages come in? Or taken? Or any with the packages at all?”

He tapped his foot nervously on the floor. Right when I was about to respond he cut me off once more, face pale and eyes twitching searching for something behind me.

“Never mind, pfff, it’s, uh, probably nothing…”

He wandered in an aimless direction behind me at a hurried pace.

\[1:00 PM\] I confronted the Barley twins while they were “working”. James had his feet up on his desk, lazily flipping through a magazine, while Tommy was intently focused on a game on his computer. I could feel my blood boil as I approached them. James looked up with a grin and spoke.

“Hey sweetheart, here to bring us coffee?”

"You two better stop with the whole package thing," I seethed. "Jensen blew it, his acting sucks. You know better than to take advantage of our boss’s innocence. And besides, this whole damn thing is too complicated. What's the point?"

James squinted his face in confusion. “Look man, as much as I would like to take credit for whatever bothering you, it ain’t us.”

“We’re busy with work, just like you should be.” Tommy joined and let out a playful wink.

As I glared at them both, I couldn't discern if they were telling the truth.

\[1:14 PM\] I caught the FedEx driver trying to sneak past my desk. She had a hoody up and obnoxious black sunglasses. I whistled at her and motioned with my hands for her to come over. She sighed at getting caught.

Before she could speak, I shouted “I don't have it, I don't want it, and I don’t want anything to do with it! Got it?"

She proceeded to flick me off. In response, I threw a pencil at her. I missed but it’s the thought that counts.

\[2:32 PM\] After enduring an hour-long meeting, I entered the bathroom and was hit by the putrid smell of urine and mold like a wall. I quickly scanned the three stalls, only to freeze when I saw the old man in the bright pink poncho standing in the middle one. My first thought was to leave and hold it, but my bladder had other ideas. I took the urinal to his right and did my business as fast as I could.

That's when I felt his eyes on me. I tried to ignore it and keep my eyes on my feet, but something compelled me to look up. And there he was, his eyes locked on mine slowly fixing his drooping frown to a sinister twitching grin. He pulled down his poncho hood revealing a tattoo on the side of his bald head that I couldn’t quite make out. I backed up and the man followed imitating my movement and maintaining eye contact like his head was a gyroscope. It was at this point I noticed the partially see-through poncho was in fact his only article of clothing.

I yelled “Yew dude, what the fuck?” as I lifted my hand blocking my vision. But when I could smell his wretched odor get closer, I split my fingers creating a small peephole. The man’s face was only inches away from mine with an inhuman smile that stretched to the sides of both of his eyes. His eyes consisted of only a black dot pupil slowly dilating, pearl white sclera, and no iris. His ivory teeth were sharp daggers tainted yellow and rotten dry red. He wailed nonsensical words that reverberated off the walls of the cramped bathroom.

I screamed at him to stop, hoping someone would hear me. But he just kept moving one step closer as I took a step back, his smile growing wider and wider. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest, and I knew I had to make a break for it. I frantically tore open the bathroom door, praying that he wouldn't lunge at me as I fled.

\[2:38 PM\] Susan from HR brought me a free T-Shirt, thanks Susan!

\[2:45 PM\] Security came by to get my report of the incident. As far as they can tell, it’s just another crazy homeless person. I tried to tell them there was something different about him, that his smile was unearthly but they thought I was being hyperbolic.

\[3:59 PM\] After making a long pitstop in the breakroom to fully decompress I returned to my desk to find a cardboard box. It lacks any address, and the cardboard is weirdly fresh without any dirt or damage. I think I’m going to open it.

And that’s it. After that point, just 1 minute after, I woke from my daze apparently. I don’t remember any of these events. I don't even know this FedEx driver that I apparently lost my cool with and allegedly knew from the prior week. And that guy in the pink poncho? I'll have to ask Dan at IT if he has access to the security tapes and get this report I submitted to security. The only evidence I have that this happened is that I’m wearing the new FBI logo embroidered shirt Susan gave to me.

I want to be clear again: I'm clean as a whistle. I haven't taken any drugs or even had a drop of alcohol. So, unless I'm developing early dementia, does anyone know how this could have happened? I appreciate any comments or insights that you may have to offer, and I'll make sure to respond to them this week. I'll also post a follow-up with any new information I come across, as well as some other stories from my past that I think you'll find interesting. Thank you for reading.
