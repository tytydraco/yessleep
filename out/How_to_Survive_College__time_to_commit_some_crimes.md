[I did not talk to Grayson](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15pn7c3/how_to_survive_college_i_shouldnt_have_broken_his/).  I started to, but then something came up that was more important.  No, this is not my attempt to stall for time.  It legit was urgent and had to be dealt with and I think once I explain everything, you all will agree with me.

But to start with, let’s go over how the laundry lady has been working on her own schemes while I’ve been floundering out here by myself.

(if you’re new, [start here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/rnauck/how_to_survive_the_holidays/), and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/s75n1c/how_to_survive_college_index/))

Talking to the laundry lady was a high priority on my list of things to do.  The only thing ranked higher than it was “study for finals” which should tell you how seriously I’m taking my grades.  What would be the point of surviving college if I didn’t get out of it with a degree, after all?

She’s been consistently taking care of my laundry, but she’s not waking me up for it anymore.  I wasn’t about to stay up all night in the hopes of catching her in the act, and in fact, I doubt that would even work.  She seems like a contrary sort of inhuman.  I set my alarm and went to the laundry room instead, late at night when no one else would be up.  I checked my closet before I left.  Sure enough, my hamper was empty.

The washing machines were all spinning when I arrived at the laundry room.  The laundry lady was sitting in one of the hard plastic chairs, reading a celebrity gossip magazine.  The sight of it took me aback.  I didn’t think inhumans would have an interest in something as mundane as celebrities.  It made the situation feel even more surreal than it already did.

“Look at this,” she said as I entered.

She flipped the magazine around, folding a page back so I could see a full page photo of an actress wearing what looked like a white slip dress with half of it covered with soccer ball sized fabric flowers that protruded from the dress like barnacles.

“Can you imagine what it’s like to clean that thing?” the inhuman mused, flipping the magazine back around to study the dress some more.  “I’d love to get my hands on it.”

“And… wash it?” I ventured.

“What else?”  She snapped the magazine shut and tossed it onto the chair next to her.  “What do you want?  You never come here without a reason.”

I told her about my latest encounter with the flickering man.  How he’d ripped out Professor Beatrice’s tongue and broke my nose.  She clucked her tongue in what I assume was mock sympathy, she doesn’t seem like a type to hand out genuine sympathy after all.

“Well that explains your face,” she said.  “But unfortunately, noses can be fixed.  That’s not going to be enough to get him into trouble.”

“I didn’t think it was.”

I glanced around for a place to sit.  She was in the middle of the three plastic chairs and I didn’t want to sit next to her and all the washing machines were running, so I settled for awkwardly leaning on the edge of the folding table.

“But it worries me because if he’s being careful,” I said, “that means this is just a waiting game to see who slips up first.”

“And you think it’s going to be you.”

I nodded sadly.

“I think it’s going to be you as well.  To be honest with you, I didn’t think it’d drag on this long.  Guess he’s more afraid of them than I thought.”

“Them?”

I believe in making sure we’re on the same page here.  I feel like the inhumans tend to assume you know the same things as them, which is definitely not the case most of the time.  It’s probably why a certain inhuman was always exasperated with a certain campground manager… one of the reasons, at least.

“What did you call them?” the laundry lady mused.  “The administration, that’s it.”

“Is that not what they are?”

An uneasy feeling was building in the pit of my stomach.  But she only shrugged dismissively.

“I’m not the one that gets to pick out names here.”

Y’all I think I done fucked up here.  It might not have been the administration and whatever it is, I might have named it.  My only consolation is that I haven’t used the name that widely.  I’ve told the laundry lady, you all, my friends, and that’s *it*.  From our prior experiences with naming inhumans, it takes quite a bit of time or extraordinary circumstances, like old land turning ancient.

I really really really hope this land isn’t turning ancient.

Or if it is, that I graduate before that whole process finishes.

“Don’t worry so much about aggravating the flickering man anymore,” the laundry lady said.  “I’m not sure we can incite him into making a mistake without putting you in too much danger.”

I thought it was very considerate of her and I guess she saw the expression on my face, for she immediately snapped that I shouldn’t feel so special.

“I need you as bait still,” she said grimly.  “I have a plan of my own and it’s almost ready.  It was originally meant to be a backup plan, but let’s go with it instead.”

And of course she wouldn’t tell me what that plan was.  I asked.  She ignored my question and went back to the magazine, flipping through the pages and muttering over the celebrity outfits and whether she’d want to try washing them or not.  Clearly we were done talking.  I sighed and reluctantly sidled to the door.

“We’ll talk again soon!” she said cheerfully, “In the meantime, try not to die!”

A+ advice.  Very helpful.

The next day I was going to meet with Grayson and ask him about the whole graveyard incident and if he had a hand in it.  I’d been rehearsing what I was going to say as well as some responses for possible reactions he might have.

We were going to meet up at my old workplace, because unfortunately it was really the only place on campus to get a decent cup of coffee.  I was too embarrassed to go inside, so Grayson volunteered to get the coffee for us and we could drink it outside.  I paced back and forth, trying not to think about all the horrible things that could go wrong while I waited.  Most of my scenarios involved my manager coming outside and inexplicably yelling at me, though she literally has no reason or inclination to do anything like that.

Maria calls this sort of thing my own personal brain doomscrolling and I’m working on not doing it so much.

Nothing happened until Grayson returned with the coffee.  He handed me my cup and I was about to take a sip when a commotion from behind the store made me freeze.  We just looked at each other for a moment and then with a deep sigh, Grayson followed me in that direction to see what was happening.  There was something banging, some sharp impacts, and as we rounded the building I could make out my manager cursing.

“Damn thing *bit me*!” she snarled.

There was a muffled reply and then my manager heaved a sigh.  I had frozen in place just at the corner, unwilling to go any further so she wouldn’t see me.

“No, it’s just a possum,” my manager said, likely to an employee still inside the building.  “Nothing to worry about.  They don’t carry rabies and I’m up-to-date on tetanus.”

I waited another moment and heard the door to the building slam shut.  Only then did we creep around the side of the building.

The possums hadn’t left.  My former manager had just given up trying to chase them off because her broom had snapped in two.

And there were six of them.

They prowled around a torn garbage bag, hissing at each other from the multitude of mouths covering their skin.  They all looked vaguely the same, their hair color was muddy red-brown, their eyes glittered like obsidian, and they had a lanky, feral look to them as they circled the spilled trash on all fours, their fingernails scratching the pavement.

“They’re, uh, multiplying,” I whispered to Grayson.

“Yeah, I don’t like this,” he whispered back.  “Look how skinny they are, too.”

They were inhumans that looked like humans, but at the same time, there was something very animalistic about their nature.  They’d multiplied to the point the local prey population - the students - could no longer sustain them.  Now they were starting to starve.

“We should do something about this,” Grayson said.  “I like their coffee and I still kind of want to use nepotism to get you your job back.  I’d hate for something to happen that got this place shut down.”

I had to agree.  My former manager was gruff and maybe a little indifferent, but I didn’t want her to get eaten by these creatures.  It would be a horrible way to go.  Grayson and I retreated a bit to figure out what to do.  It was apparent that these creatures were living partially up to their nickname - which is a concern I’ll worry about some other day.  But it gave us a starting point to theorize about their behaviors and possible weaknesses.

Well, weaknesses other than being hit with a broom, that is.

Grayson didn’t know much about possums, bless him for the city boy he is.  I, however, not only knew a bit about wildlife but also knew about inhumans and how Kate dealt with them on the campground.

“They probably have a nest,” I said.  “We should follow them to it.”

“And then what?”

We’d figure it out when we go there, I said grimly.  If nothing else, we could take a look and then leave and decide what to do at another time.  But if the possums were numerous enough now that the manager couldn’t fight them off… well, someone was going to get hurt.  Someone was going to die.  So we waited in breathless silence as the possums squabbled over the garbage until we finally heard them leave.  They resumed walking on two legs as soon as they were within eyeshot of the street.  Grayson and I glanced at each other, then we peeled off the side of the building and followed them.

They went to the old power station.

It’s impossible to miss on campus and I had walked past it countless times by now.  I tried not to look at it or even think about what happened inside.  It became merely part of the scenery.  But now, faced with going inside, I found myself frozen in place.  My heart was pounding in my chest and my stomach twisted with nausea.  I saw in my mind Patricia and the others, flattened underneath the mass of the eyeball, their bodies limp and limbs splayed in awkward directions.

“You okay?” Grayson asked.  “I can go by myself.”

I swallowed hard and asked if he’d ever been inside.  He shrugged nonchalantly and said that yes, he had.

I wanted to ask if he knew of the slab in the basement, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it.  Not because I was afraid of the answer, but because I didn’t want to admit that cursed thing exists.  I’d gone all semester trying to not think about it.  Besides, that wasn’t what we were here for.  It didn’t matter.

It doesn’t matter.  As long as it stays hidden, it can’t hurt anyone else.

“No, I’m fine,” I said.  “Let’s go.”

I got lucky.  The possum nest wasn’t actually in the building.  It was in an unused dumpster around behind it, one that had been abandoned for so long that it was rusted through at the bottom.  We watched it for a few moments, listening to the rustling and thumping coming from inside as the possums tried to make themselves comfortable in the nest they were clearly outgrowing.  I scrutinized the structure.  The lid was shut, which meant we could possibly trap them inside.  And with the rusted out bottom, I could see a sliver of the material with which they had made their nest.

Paper.  It looked like they’d scrounged up every lost or discarded piece of homework and made it into their nest.

Which meant it was flammable.  *Highly* flammable.

Humanity’s oldest weapon.

One quick trip to the nearest gas station and we were ready.  We didn’t have to worry about security cameras, as Grayson knew for a fact that the ones that were installed in the power station weren’t watching the back of the building.  It wouldn’t take long for the smoke to be noticed, though.  We’d take cover in the art building nearby as soon as the fire was lit so that we wouldn’t be seen leaving the scene in any capacity.  If we found the right classroom, we could also keep an eye on the dumpster to see if any of the possums got away.

I want to state that I had equal parts in planning this.  It wasn’t like Grayson is intimately familiar with how to get away with arson.  We figured it out together.

We weighed the top down with some chunks of cement we found out near the art building loading dock.  I think they were part of a failed or discarded mold, maybe?  Either way, they were heavy, and it took two of us to hoist them on top of the dumpster.  That was the scariest part.  We had to get uncomfortably close to it and my heart was racing, afraid that at any moment the top would fly open and one of those creatures would fall on me, all those tiny mouths biting and sucking at my flesh.

I don’t think I could have done this alone.

As it is, I almost chickened out.

“Do you think that maybe we shouldn’t be doing this?” I asked Grayson nervously as he uncapped the spout on the gasoline can.

“We absolutely shouldn’t be doing this,” he replied grimly.  “This is arson.  But Ashley… the people that make the rules aren’t going to do shit about this situation… so let’s do the right thing the wrong way.”

He poured the gasoline all around the base of the dumpster.  I kept a lookout while he did this, but this part of campus wasn’t widely trafficked and it was a time of day when a majority of the students were in classes anyway.  The power station was on the fringe of campus and the back of it was only facing the parking lot.  I didn’t see anyone walking around in it and even if there was, there was enough distance that they’d have trouble identifying us later.

Also Grayson assured me that he could get us out of any trouble we wound up in.  Being the president’s son carried a lot of weight around here.

“Okay, let’s do this,” he said, straightening.  “We light it and then walk away.  We go straight to the art building, go inside, and then watch what happens.”

“But what if it doesn’t work,” I said.  “What if it makes things worse.”

Grayson turned to face me, his expression stoically determined.  He held the lighter out to me.  I stared at it.

“We won’t know unless we try,” he said quietly.  “You said that fire is one of the weapons that *does* tend to work against the inhumans.  I think it’s worth the attempt.”

He pressed the lighter into my shaking hands.

“But it’s your call,” he continued.  “We can walk away right now.”

I took a deep breath.  My fingers closed around the lighter.  Mechanically, my body moving as if of its own accord, I lit the end of a rag we were using as the fuse.  It didn’t feel like I was doing this.  It felt like someone else was in control and I was just watching as an observer.

Then Grayson grabbed my hand and pulled me away from the dumpster.  We didn’t have long before the flames reached the gasoline pooling at its base.  He whispered at me that we had to go and I followed him, walking away even though everything in me screamed that we should be running.  The back of my spine itched, right between the shoulderblades.

We made it halfway to the art building before a screech ripped through the air.  I jumped, Grayson swore, and our nerves broke and we ran the rest of the way into the art building.  Luckily, no one was there to see our panicked flight.  Grayson ducked into a side classroom and I followed him.  He dropped the blinds, leaving only an inch at the bottom open, and we both dropped to a crouch by the wall and stared through the narrow sliver of open window.

We could only see the edge of the dumpster.  Black smoke was curling out around the corner of the building and I could see the flicker of flames at the base, illuminating the cement around it with a yellow sheen.  I felt like a taut wire, every muscle in my body tense with fear.  What if we got caught?  What if this didn’t work?  Beside me, Grayson was also tense, his fingers clutching the windowsill and his eyes reflecting the spark of the flames licking out from the top of the dumpster.

For a few moments the dumpster burned with no indication that anything was happening inside.  I felt vaguely sick, thinking of those creatures burning up with no escape.

Then the entire dumpster shuddered.  It jumped sideways.  Shuddered a second time.  I shrank further towards the ground, not wanting to see what was happening, but unable to look away.

The rusted bottom of the dumpster curled open, like the burning pages of paper floating away in the updraft.  The metal cracked and split and then turned outward from the force of the impact coming from inside.  And the fire spilled out, rolling clumps of charred glowing paper scattering across the concrete in the billowing smoke.

Something came with it.  A massive body, lumpy like a badly stuffed cushion, its flesh blackened and trailing smoke.  Its head was stuck on at an angle, like a doll with a crooked neck, and black beady eyes stared out of a pointed skull.

A possum.  A giant, distended possum.

That was now on fire, thanks to us.

It screamed and when it did so, its entire body split open on a seam.  A line appeared, running from the nose to the haunches, and then it opened , the top half of its body raising up to reveal a row of white teeth, dripping with saliva.

Human teeth, I realized with shock.  It had human teeth.

And beyond that wall of white enamel was a roiling mass of flesh.  I caught a glimpse of red hair and the bright flash of beady eyes.

It was looking at me.  They were looking at me.  They knew we were here.  What we had done.

Then the possum slammed its mouth shut, enclosing its children safe inside its bulk once again.  It began to run, fleeing the flames, dropping bits of charred fur and burnt paper in its wake.

I slipped entirely out of sight, putting my back against the wall, covering my mouth with both hands to hide my frantic breathing. Tears were forming in the corner of my eyes.

“I-I don’t think we killed it,” I panted.

“Maybe we need to use more fire next time,” Grayson said thoughtfully.

I turned to him, wondering why he didn’t sound that surprised by what we had just witnessed.  Perhaps his composure was just that unshakable, or perhaps, like my fears with the graveyard, he knew far more than he was letting on.

“Next time!?” a voice shrieked from the doorway.

The flickering man stood in the doorway.  I’m serious.  That asshole decided to just… *show up*.

“But it’s not raining!” I cried.  “This isn’t fair!”

“I have legs, I can walk, I can follow something as troublesome as you around if I want to,” he replied peevishly.  “You are… *not great* at noticing you’re being followed.”

Then his attention slid off me and onto Grayson.  His expression hardened and he stalked forward.  Grayson stood and positioned himself between us.  The flickering man stopped short and stared down at the student.  It was fine, I told myself.  He was the president’s son.  He wasn’t in danger.

My nose throbbed with pain, remembering what happened last time I encountered this creature.

“W-what are you doing?” the flickering man asked in bewilderment.  “You aren’t supposed to be doing this.”

“Doing *what*?” Grayson snapped.  “I can do whatever the hell I want around here.”

It’s a mutual relationship, the flickering man had said.  The school takes something from the president’s family, but they get something in return.

The flickering man seized the front of Grayson’s shirt, nearly pulling him off his feet.  His face was contorted with anger, his lips peeled back in a snarl, but I thought I saw something of desperation in his eyes.  He stared down at Grayson, who returned the creature’s glare with perfect calm.

“Let go of me,” Grayson said quietly.

For a moment, the flickering man didn’t move.  Then something in his face softened and the anger quickly slipped away, replaced by wide-eyed shock.  He let go of Grayson’s shirt and the student stepped back, raising one hand to smooth out the wrinkles.  It felt like a calculated gesture.  He wasn’t rattled by the inhuman and he wanted the flickering man to know it.

Y’all I’ve never been so jealous of someone’s poise in all my life.

“You don’t treat me like that,” Grayson said calmly.  “You can bully everyone else but not *me.*”

Grayson flicked a glance up at the flickering man.

“Oh, and you leave Ashley alone too.  She’s getting a bit tired of it all and honestly, so am I.”

For a moment it looked like the flickering man was going to say something more.  He glanced between the two of us, clearly torn between his anger and his frustration at… not being able to defy Grayson?  Just what kind of authority did he have over these creatures?

“Fine,” the flickering man finally grated.  “Those things were getting out of hand anyway.  They probably need to be culled.”

I realize that he didn’t agree to leaving me alone.  In fact, I’m sure that was a deliberate omission.  This isn’t over.  But he left.

He pulled the fire alarm on the way out too, so we mutually decided that was our cue to leave the area before the fire truck arrived to put out our literal dumpster fire.

“I’m sorry you had to see that,” Grayson said as we walked away from the scene of our crime.

I took a deep breath.  All those rehearsals be damned.  I had to know.

“Grayson, what is going on?” I said.  “You can boss those creatures around?  I-I need to know what’s happening here.”

He paused and glanced sideways at me.  Then he quickly looked away.

“Don’t worry about it,” he mumbled.

Then he left and I… I was just… rooted to where I was standing, any words I wanted to say stuck in my throat.  Like all that practice had been for nothing.

I don’t have answers yet.  I know I promised myself that I wouldn’t divulge Grayson’s secret… but I think it’s time to bring in extra help, because… I don’t know.  I don’t even know what is wrong with me this time, but I’m learning that if I can’t do something alone, then I need to rely on the people around me who *can* do it.

I’m going to tell Cassie. [\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)
