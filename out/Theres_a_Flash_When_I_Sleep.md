I never considered myself particularly sensitive or easily scared. I’m not one of those people who sees a haunted house in every flickering light. But what’s been happening to me over the last few weeks goes way beyond *strange* or *unusual*. I don’t even know if I’m truly sleeping anymore.

It started with a tiny detail. Every night when I lie down and close my eyes, I see a quick, bright flash—like someone taking a photo with a camera. It’s not like headlights from a passing car, not like the glow of my phone screen. It’s pinpointed. Sudden. Sharp. Right behind my eyelids. So bright I can’t ignore it.

The first time it happened, I thought it must’ve been a car outside. Headlights. Maybe lightning from a storm. But there was nothing. No storm. No cars. No light. Nothing.

I live alone. Small two-room apartment in an old building with creaky floors and paper-thin walls. You hear everything in this place. If someone walks down the hallway, I know it. If someone coughs upstairs, I can tell which floor it came from. And yet—after every flash... total silence.

I tried to brush it off. Put my phone in night mode, darkened the room, changed pillows. Nothing helped. The flash kept coming. Every time I closed my eyes—*snap*. Like a photo. I even set up my phone to record during the night, just in case I was accidentally triggering the screen or something. But the footage? Black. No light. No sound.

Last week, it got worse.

I was lying in bed, almost asleep. Eyes closed. Another flash. But this time... I *heard* something. A click. Like a camera shutter. Right next to my ear. And I swear, I felt a small gust of air, like someone was standing right by my face. I jolted upright, turned the lights on—no one. Door was locked, windows shut. Everything normal. But I wasn’t alone. I *knew* it.

Since then, it’s been happening every night. Same routine: I lie down, close my eyes—*flash*. Then the *click*. And then... silence. Sometimes I think I hear soft breathing. Or a rustling sound, like something shifting in the room. But every time I open my eyes—nothing.

I’ve searched the entire apartment. Every corner, every shadow, even under the bed. I set up cameras—hell, I even bought an infrared one. And guess what? They show... me. Sleeping. Twitching slightly every few minutes, like I’m reacting to something. But the weirdest part? Every time I flinch, there’s a brief distortion in the footage. Static. Interference. And sometimes... for just a frame or two, it looks like a shadow hanging directly over me.

But there’s nothing. Just me. I even watched one video in slow motion—there was a single white flash. For a fraction of a second, it looked like... an eye. Open. Staring. Right into the camera. And then it was gone.

I haven’t told anyone. Who would believe me? I can barely believe it myself. But I’m losing my mind. I haven’t slept properly in days. And when I do drift off, I dream of dark rooms where I’m not alone. I feel eyes on me. I hear the *click*. Again and again and again.

Last night, something happened that almost made me run out of the apartment.

I left the camera running again. This time with audio. I needed proof. I passed out around 3AM. This morning, I reviewed the footage. Same thing: me, sleeping, occasional flickers, visual noise. And then, at exactly 3:12AM, I flinched. And a second later... you can *hear* something.

I had to replay it ten times to be sure. It’s faint, broken—but clear:

**“You don’t see me. But I see you.”**

I almost dropped my phone. I deleted the video. I don’t even know why. Maybe because I couldn’t stand hearing it again. Maybe because I knew... it was *real*.

I’m not sleeping tonight. I can’t. I threw the camera out the window. I checked every outlet, every wall, every dark spot. But deep down, I know: it won’t change anything. This thing... it’s not *out* there. It’s *with* me. Maybe inside my head. But what if it’s not?

What if the flash isn’t coming from outside... but from somewhere I’m not supposed to see? From something that only exists when I’m not looking?

And what if it wants more than just to watch?
