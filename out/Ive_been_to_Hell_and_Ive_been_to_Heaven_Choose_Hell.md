I'm writing this in a hurry. I don't have much time, and any second now he will find me. I don't even know if this will go through. Let me explain.

3 days ago, at 10:58 PM on a cool Wednesday night, my life came to an end. I was a limo driver for an exceptionally douchey client. He treated me like garbage. Eventually, I snapped. In a fit of rage, I crashed the car. There was a blinding flash of light, and then heat. 

The heat always comes first. Then, you're blinded. Its only natural, of course. You just aren't used to the lighting, I suppose. Afterwards, your eyes begin to adapt. You start seeing shapes and colors. Then, it hits you.

Everyone sees the same thing at the same time. A massive, gleaming pillar of smooth black stone piercing the sky, an earthy roof stretching to eternity. There are gasps, then tears. Finally, there is collection. When it happened to me, I simply stood, shell-shocked. Then, the floor crumbled beneath me. I fell into a pitch-black void, where a voice spoke to me.

"Welcome to Hell, Patient 117567853558." The voice was gravelly and deep, malice filled.

"What's gonna happen to me?" I choked out.

"Absolutely nothing. We are bad people. You are bad too. Thus, we shall thrive together." The voice finished. Another flash of light hit me.

When I could finally see again, I stood in front of a towering mansion. It had at least 3 floors, with outdoor water features (how did those even work?) and painstakingly good detailing. 3 supercars sat in the garage, though I couldn't see the brands. To my left stood a short, red man with horns. I shrieked and jumped back, but he didn't even look at me. Instead, he spoke.

"2 people in one go? That's impressive. You will sleep here. In the morning, you will work grueling labor to make up for your sins. Afterwards, we offer you a choice." In a flash of smoke, the red man disappeared.

My first night in Hell was a restless night. I tossed and turned in an extremely comfy bed. The room was dark, but deathly hot. I toiled for what seemed like hours before sleep hit me. When I woke, I found myself standing, holding a pickaxe and waist deep in a hole. The same red man was standing over me.

"You have 300 days of sins to account for. Now, pick up your pickaxe and start mining. I don't care what you mine, just do it." Then, again, he disappeared.

I began mining. The rock was smooth and red, and my pickaxe bounced off. Eventually, I found a more effective stance and began to claw my way through. After about an hour of digging, I heard more clanging from my left. 

"Hello?" I asked, hoping for a response.

"Yes, who are you?" A sharp tiny voice pierced through the boiling hot day.

"I'm a patient, same as you. How many days do you have?"

"Oh, me? I'm done. But sticking around here is better." He said.

"What do you mean? Don't you want to go to Heaven?" I interrogated.

"No, but they gave me the option. Heaven isn't as great as they say. If you knew what goes on up there, you'd want to stay down here." He concluded.

"What goes on up there-" But the man was gone, leaving me to think for the rest of the day.

Eventually, I settled into a rhythm. I would wake up in the mines, give 30 minutes of good work while thinking about my sins, and I would also talk to the stranger. He told me his name was Thomas. Although I prodded about the topic of Heaven, he refused to answer my questions. He said I needed to see for myself or I wouldn't believe it. That's all I needed to hear.

A day turned into 2. Then 5. Then 10. Then 50. Then 100. At long last, day 300 rolled around. I woke up, but I wasn't standing in a mine. Instead, I stood in front of a huge winged creature, red and scaly, with huge fangs and claws. He extended both hands for a handshake. One hand was marked "Heaven". The other marked "Hell". I knew this was it. This was my decision point. I reached a hand out for Heaven, and shook his hand.

It took 10 seconds in Heaven for me to regret it. 

When the light cleared, I was horrified. There were men, women and children of all ages strung up in unnatural positions. There were limbs scattered about here and there, and the floor was a sea of blood. It wasn't just humans. There were animals too. All of the people had terrified screams still glued on their face. And was that- no, it couldn't be- I could've sworn I saw an eye blink. 

I walked through the sea of torture, until finally I saw something. In the middle of a field of eyes and teeth was a white table, pristine and untouched. A woman was laid on the table, and a man stood over her. A feeling of divinity struck me, and in that moment, I knew without a doubt that I was looking dead at God. The man didn't look anything out of the ordinary. That's the only description I came up with.

"Hey!" I shouted. "What is this place?"

The man turned around calmly. Something was off. Wind began to blow, and chills ran down my spine. "I'm God. Are you ready for your divine purpose?"

Fear filled me. In that moment, I knew that if I stayed, I would end up like the men and women strewn up all around me. I ran as fast as I could. As I ran, I heard cackling. 

"More fun for me. See you soon!" A gleeful crow rang around the entire realm.

I've been running as fast as I can. Along the way, I found a phone. It somehow had internet. I'm trying to get this out there, and I'm typing while I run. Impressive, I know, but the point still remains. GET THE WORD OUT. HEAVEN IS A TRAP! DON'T GO! CHOOSE HELL!
