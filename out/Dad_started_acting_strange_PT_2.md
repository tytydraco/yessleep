Hello, and thank you for reading the first part of my story. I’ve still been trying to make heads or tails of how I feel about the responses but overall I think I’ll be okay. My therapist tells me that if it helps me process the loss maybe it’s worth finishing, but I don’t know personally. My friends seem to think it's a good idea too but, so far what seems to make me feel close to my brothers is doing the things they used to do. Maybe I’ll tell you more but I think this is more important.

The morning of Milo’s disappearance was nothing unusual. People say that when you experience tragedies you remember everything that happens, even the boring stuff, and I’m here to tell you that that’s true. At 7:30 AM, I woke up. My phone alarm vibrating softly beside my head, I’ve always been a light sleeper. As I get up, I shake Brick to wake him up, he grumbles and rubs his bald head. Thomas hardly goes to school unless it’s to sell drugs so I leave him be. That night he went to sleep in his clothes, hardly moving his stiff sheets on his dirty bed. I step out of the room and make my way to the shower, clothes in hand. I quickly wash off while Brick makes coffee. Archer is normally the second one into the shower but today it was Thomas. I was surprised but his eyelids were half shut which means he just came to pee or something.

Sitting at the table Brick and I share some cereal while he makes the kids breakfast. Usually a quick couple of pieces of bacon and a waffle or something. I check the news and read an article about Queen Elizabeth dying. I was bummed but it’s not like I knew the lady.

“Dude, Queen Elizabeth died yesterday.”

“Yeah, I know. I saw that yesterday.” Brick replied.

“Man that sucks. Oh, well. It’s not like I knew the lady.”

“Yeah, same.”

At 7:47 AM, Archer came to the table, with the rest of the boys. He must have overslept but the boys always wake to the smell of food. Ted and Cud sat next to each other and Milo looked extremely pale. He refused any food and barely drank his chocolate milk. After a few minutes, he ended up throwing up near the trash.

“Whoa! Brick you trying to poison us?” Archer yelled.

“What? No! Milo, you okay buddy? You need to lay down?”

“I got eggcrack.” Milo said.

Milo called vomit egg crack because he didn’t know how to pronounce it, nor did he know what it meant. Brick picked him up, forced him to drink some water and tucked him back into his bunk bed. I cleaned the vomit and watched everyone sit about the table and Archer had already started eating Milo’s share of food. 

At 7:53, Brick came back looking upset. He told us about Milo having a stomach bug and left a small trash can with him. The other boys brushed their teeth, freshened up, and got ready for the bus that arrived at 8 o’clock. Then Archer and I got ready for the bus that is almost always late and sure enough it showed up at 8:25, despite having more stops and school starting at 8:30. It didn’t matter, because before then, surprisingly enough, Thomas was up and about freshening up too. 

“What are you doing up?” I asked him.

“Hey, the streets don’t sleep man. Besides, you think I’m gonna let Brick be the breadwinner?”

“Thomas that’s dirty money, that actually might fuck things up more.” 

He reached into his shoes and pulled out a rolled-up wad of cash, unfurling a 20-dollar bill and stuffing it into my pocket with his forefingers. “That’s for lunch today buddy. Think of how much better it’ll be now that I’m helping out.”

“Thomas I don’t think…”

“Silas, if you’re going to suck Brick’s cock, why don’t you go talk to him then, huh? I’m getting ready.” I stepped out of the bathroom threshold and he slammed it shut. Gathering our bags, our father’s raspy rattle began again. This time it sounded more pained than the night before. We all cocked our heads and heard some clattering before my Dad stepped out of the room. 

As he stepped out he was wearing a wife beater and grey sweatpants. His head, shirt, and pants were stained with sweat and flecks of blood. His nails were ragged as if he had chewed them down to the nail bed. He moved like a boulder filling the hallway and we all averted his path. Reaching into the fridge he grabbed packaged steaks that Brick was going to cook.

“Oh hey Dad, I was planning on-”

Dad looks at him like he was seeing through him or something. I only saw Brick’s face in that moment and I could watch as his personality crumbled inwards. Dad grabs the meat and slowly looks around the room, like an alien identifying a new environment. Then Thomas came out of the bathroom, still drying off his now clean body. 

“Hey, Dad! What’s going on man? Hey, I know Mom just passed and all, but how would you like to hit the town with me, huh? Stop at a strip club or something? I know some girls in there that might be-” 

Like a pistol, my Dad shot his arms around Thomas's throat, strangling him at a moment's notice. With gasps and sudden shock, I could hardly bring the words together in that moment but Brick was there in a flash. He stood trying to pry his arms off him and soon Archer was too, I was just scared and trembling. After he let him go, Thomas fell to the floor choking and breathing deep.

“What… the fuck… I’m just… trying to help…” Thomas wheezed.

“Thomas just shut up!” Brick yelled.

“Brick, you’re not the one who just got choked!” Archer blurted.

My dad spun his head towards Archer who quickly backed into the wall. Then retrieving his meat, he took off into his room the same way he had left it.

“Thomas… maybe you could try being sensitive to Dad?” I said.

“Fuck… you… what did you do, huh? All you did was watch me get choked. I mean, what the hell?” He walked over to me, snatched his 20 dollars, and gave it to Archer instead. Begrudgingly he looked at Brick. “Thanks.”

“Can you stop trying to piss everyone off?” Brick said.

With an acknowledging finger lifted in the air, Thomas’ lips were pursed to say something smart, but he let his hand fall, and he shook his head. Clapping Brick on the shoulder and leaving through the screen door. 

We had agreed that Dad went overboard, but Thomas provoked him. Archer was more on Thomas’ side than Dad but that’s to be expected. Archer never had much of his own personality and seemed to be latching onto Thomas more and more every day. We boarded the bus and went to school. 

School had gone by easily enough, moving from classroom to classroom avoiding people, and talking to one or two people here and there. At about 11:15 AM, the classroom had received a call. My teacher, Ms. Thompson picked up and answered it and sure enough I heard ‘Williams? Okay. Yup. Okay. I’ll let him know. Thanks. Okay. Bye.’ She excused me to the office and told me I was leaving early. When I got there, Brick was waiting for me, I could see the dry tears on his face, and with a quivering lip, he told me that Milo had gone missing.

Rushing home we had gotten back at 11:38 AM. Three police cars had parked along the street our house was on and people were taking photos and documenting the surroundings. As we stepped inside I saw the crime scene before me. There was a chair at the counter near the sink, and a half-finished glass of water, half full? Maybe. The counter was missing a piece from it, as if something had hit it, then came the blood on the floor. In tiny spatters, they led from the kitchen to Milo’s room. From there the blood was in his bunk, on the floor and on the window. The window had been smashed and there was glass everywhere, only it wasn’t on the inside, it was on the outside. 

I drew the conclusion instantly, but I let the detectives do their job. I wouldn’t dare assume I knew more than they did especially if they were seasoned in their jobs. They told us the state of the house and that they’d be on the lookout for potential suspects which also might include our brother Thomas. My Dad was also present and he seemed fairly hurt, especially around his hands and face. Once the cops left it was 2:12 PM. 

Brick and I were sitting at the table trying to figure out what to tell the boys, Archer included. We left him at school and I could tell Brick was already regretting it. 

“What did the cops say to you?” I asked. 

“They said someone must have broken in, and a fight took place. Then Dad fought back and got hurt before they took Milo.” 

“Why do you think there was blood in his bed?”

“I don’t know, maybe he tried to hide? I always tell him if he’s scared to hide under the covers.”

“Yeah, but what about the window?”

“What about it? It was smashed.”

“Yeah, but the glass was on the outside.”“Yeah, so?”

“So, whoever broke the window did it from inside.”

“So they broke in from the back-”

“Brick, the door is locked, and there’s no sign of forced entry.”

“What are you saying?”

“I don’t know, Brick. I think…”



I couldn’t say it. I just couldn’t. The man that loved our Dad the most, I couldn’t tell him I thought Dad took Milo.
