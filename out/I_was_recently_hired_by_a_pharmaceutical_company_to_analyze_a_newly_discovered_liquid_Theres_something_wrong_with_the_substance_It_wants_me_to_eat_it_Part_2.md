With temptations addressed, let's continue on to assumptions; another fundamentally misunderstood concept. The discrepancy here is relatively straightforward.

Assumptions - to a certain degree - are just lies.

Not the brazen, reality-breaking kind like *Watergate* or the ancient Greek diplomat claiming *“there are no soldiers inside this giant, wooden horse,”* with a shit-eating grin painted across their face. Assumptions are quieter falsehoods. Self-directed lies of omission. We assume things to be true when we desperately *want* them to be true. Clarification carries the distinct possibility of proving the opposite of our preferred truth, so why bother? It’s a bad bet. A risk not worth taking. Better to smooth out the harsh edges of reality with a healthy dose of conjecture and just call it day.

Unconvinced?

Or, even more telling, in disagreement?

Allow me to provide an example.

**Assumption:** My boss hasn’t fired me. *CLM Pharmaceuticals* hasn’t put me down like a horse with a broken leg. Therefore, they didn’t see me dip my hand in the sample jar. They don’t know I left the compound with a piece of the oil. No need to worry.

**Truth:** Jim, the head security officer, said it best:

*“We’re always watching, my dear. Remember that.”*

Need another? Something more recent? Fresher?

**Assumption:** The security camera stationed in the northwest corner of my lab is *just* a camera. Hasn’t done a damn thing to suggest otherwise. Feels like a safe bet, right?

**Truth:** Apparently it’s an intercom, too. The Executive responsible for hiring me called me to his office today through a speaker concealed on the underside of the device.

The unexpected swoon of his familiar voice materializing from the void as I was attempting to work quite literally put the fear of God in me. I leapt backward from my lab table and shrieked like a banshee. Some rogue gesture, whether it was the flailing of my arms or the spasming of my shoulders, collided with the company’s weathered microscope, knocking it off the edge and sending it crashing to the floor. When all was said and done, I couldn’t even recall what he said. Thankfully, that deficit seemed apparent to my voyeur.

*“…need me to repeat the instructions, Helen?”*

I gave the empty air a meek, hesitant nod. He relayed the instructions a second time. Still quivering a little under the influence of epinephrine, I tiptoed over to the steel double doors, and pressed the *up* arrow on the dashboard. The doors opened immediately, almost as if the carriage itself hadn’t moved an inch since I’d entered the lab three hours prior.

But that couldn't be true, right?

**August 28th, 2025 - Morning**

*CLM* headquarters was certainly a monument to their dominance of the industry: a decadent altar to a once boundless prosperity and an impenetrable, corporate stronghold in the most medieval sense of the word. It just wasn't apparent *when* that dominance occurred, because it clearly wasn't ongoing.

Based on how empty the place was, that golden age seemed to have long since passed.

The compound’s architecture was reminiscent of a colossal, upright plunger: a domed foundation that narrowed at the center, with sleek, box-shaped offices that extended upwards floor by floor, thousands of feet into the atmosphere. All the communal spaces were within the dome, things like the cafeteria, security office, greenhouse, gymnasium, bar, nursery, library, chapel, apiary…so on and so on. The functional spaces were above. To continue with the plunger analogy, my lab was about one-fifth of the way up the handle. If it had any windows, I’d probably be able to see a faint silhouette of the city’s skyline from that height.

When I arrived in the morning, I’d pace through the modern, conservatively-furnished lobby, past the aforementioned communal spaces, towards the compound’s singular elevator. Before ascending, however, I’d have to navigate the security queue, an expansive, almost maze-like series of roped-off walkways. There was never any line for the elevator, because I seemed to be the only person who *used* the damn thing. Despite that, protocol demanded I endure a stroll through the entire labyrinth, which was always as vacant as a church parking lot on December 26th, as opposed to skipping the redundancy and saving a few minutes by walking around the side of it all. The *clack* of my heels tapping against the linoleum floor would echo generously through the chamber as I gradually made my way to the end of the queue, twisting and turning until I finally reached the abandoned security checkpoint, which was nothing more than neck-high desk with a dusty sign that read *“Please wait your turn”* and a drab, beige umbrella to shield the non-existent guard from being cooked by beams of sunlight radiating through the windows scattered across the ceiling of the dome.

I say *non-existent* because I never saw anyone posted there, so I believed, until recently, that there was no guard. In retrospect, however, I do recall noticing cheap disposable coffee cups appearing and disappearing from the surface of the desk - there one day, gone the next - so perhaps there *was* someone on duty; we just never crossed paths. Odd, but not impossible. Another assumption proved hollow.

Another lie for the pile, another temptation obliged - so the old saying goes.

Anyway, I’d close my eyes, count to ten, and *"wait my turn"* per protocol. Why do it? Well, as mentioned, they were always watching. Security cameras littered the outside of the elevator shaft like boils on the skin of a peasant about to succumb to the black plague, haphazardly placed and too numerous to count, all angled down to monitor the lobby. Just as with the mandated meditation, I didn’t push back against protocol, even though the protocol felt patently ridiculous in practice.

On the count of ten, I’d pass the checkpoint, call the elevator, type *32* into the elevator’s digital keypad, tap my badge against the reader, and *presto -* the doors would soon open to my home away from home.

This morning, however, The Executive instructed me via the previously undetected intercom to leave my post, enter the elevator, and type *272.*

The gears and the pulleys whirred to life before I even placed my badge against the reader. Made me wonder if that step was necessary to begin with. As the machine carried me higher and higher, I tried to remember *why* that was part of my routine. Where did I learn it? Was it part of the protocol? Did I just start doing it of my own accord for some inane reason? My futile attempts at dissecting that mystery were fortunately interrupted by the shrill chiming of a digital bell. The gentle humming of the elevator motor died out. When the doors opened, he was staring right at me from directly across the room, bloodshot gray-blue eyes full and seething with either rage or excitement.

God, and I thought the lobby was *conservatively-furnished*.

Wood-paneled flooring, lacquered with some ancient, jellied varnish.

Blank walls the color of table salt to match the identically blank ceiling.

A small, unadorned desk,

A red-leather, wing-backed chair, decorated with strange, runic symbols embroidered in the leather with silver thread,

and *him*.

*“Helen! What a pleasant surprise…”* he remarked, waving me in from the safety of the elevator carriage.

I crossed the threshold. Instantly, a strong chemical scent wafted into my nostrils: bleach with a tinge of sweetness. As my feet crept forward, my head jerked back from the odor, searching for cleaner air.

*“Surprise, Sir? You called me up here,”* I replied.

He leaned over the desk and gave me a deflated, mirthless chuckle.

*“Oh, I never count my chickens before they hatch. Living without expectations can be ferociously joyful. For me, everything’s a bit of a surprise.”* Recognition flashed across his face. He pulled open one of the drawers and began rummaging through its contents.

*“You really should try it. But enough catching up - surely you know why I summoned you?”*

I *assumed* it was to discuss the specimen theft I’d committed months ago, as detailed previously, and the series of events that followed, which I've only partially documented for you fine people, but you know what they say about assumptions. He slammed the drawer shut and dropped a stack of papers on the desk. As I brainstormed, calculating a strategic answer to his question, the chemical odor sharply worsened. He interpreted the coughing fit that followed to mean: *"no, I don't have the faintest idea why you summoned me - please, do tell”*

*“Well…”* he continued, reaching into his suit jacket and flipping on a pair of reading glasses, *“here’s a hint.”*

After some uncomfortable trial and error, I discovered a pocket of air in the back left corner of the room that was decidedly less harsh. My hacking slowly abated. In a weird moment of symmetry, the Executive began forcefully clearing his throat, as if he was taking over where I left off. He then gathered the stack of papers and began reading.

“***The light was off, but critically; I didn’t watch it turn off. How long had the feed been dead? One tenth of a second or nine? It was impossible to know.”*** His voice was overly animated, with tight punctuation and crisp enunciation, like he was recording an audiobook. He glanced up at me, the bottom half of his face hidden behind the transcript.

My jaw practically hit the floor. I’d been stewing over my lustful ingestion of the oil for *months* now. I held cavalcades of half-answers to what seemed like millions of unasked questions between the folds of my brain - so much so that my head felt heavier on my shoulders - in an attempt to be prepared for this moment. The point at which I’d either have to defend my actions or lie through my teeth.

I feel a bit embarrassed to say I was unprepared for this *particular* angle, but I suppose I have no one to blame but myself.

*“No? Not ringing a bell? Curious.”* He leafed through the packet and located another excerpt.

*“Ah ! How about: ‘* ***I*** ***always liked the way her blonde curls danced over her shoulders, but I couldn’t stand the sight of the graying strands buried within. The color was a pollutant. It matched the oil to a tee. Made me want to cut the follicles from her skull and swallow them whole.’***”

The Executive smiled at me. It felt like his lips didn’t know how to do anything else.

*“You…read what I posted online?”* I whimpered.

He lobbed the stack of papers over his shoulder.

*“No, of course not! I had someone print out what you wrote, and then I read it. Edited it a little, too.* ‘*I always liked the way her blonde curls danced* ***over*** *her shoulders’ reads a lot snappier than ‘I* ***had*** *always liked the way her blonde curls danced* ***on*** *her shoulders’, but that's neither here nor there.”*

He cupped his hand around his mouth, swollen eyes cartoonishly darting from side to side, lowering his voice to a whisper.

*“My secret to success? I* ***never*** *go online; just isn’t safe anymore. You know that’s where he lives, right? The thing that makes the oil? The man who's here to end it all?”*

My hand began reaching for the elevator’s control panel. He wagged a smooth, alabaster finger in my direction.

*“Helen! Where on earth do you think you’re going?”*

Honestly, a new plan had abruptly crystalized in my mind, and it was exceptionally simple.

Get downstairs.

Find my car.

And drive.

I recognize this next statement may be confusing - mostly because I haven’t gotten to this part in the story yet - but I think it still deserves to be said, even without the appropriate context:

What did I have left to lose by leaving, anyway?

The people I loved were long gone, and that was my fault.

Might as well just fuck off into obscurity.

*“I mean…I was going to leave. I’m assuming I’m…fired…for what I wrote?”*

A lengthy, pregnant pause followed.

I really had no way of anticipating what came next.

He tried to appear stoic, but failed, discharging a tiny, capricious snicker.

From there, the dam broke.

He simply couldn’t hold it in anymore.

The Executive erupted into violent laughter. His cheeks became flushed. Tears streamed down his face. He cackled until he’d divested every single molecule of oxygen he had to his name, and then he just began wheezing, his expression twisted into a surreal caricature of elation throughout the entire episode. I closed my eyes and placed my hands over my ears. I couldn’t absorb the brunt of it.

There's something desperately wrong with that man.

Eventually, I creaked a single eyelid open. His joy-flavored seizure seemed to be calming. He flicked a tear from the bridge of his drenched nose and sent a tight fist down onto the desk like a gavel.

*“Oh, wow…good one, Helen. Truly superb. Lord knows I needed that.”*

I think I smiled. I tried to at least.

*“Back to brass tax, though: No! Of course you’re not fired. What a downright silly notion!”*

A rapid exhale whistled through his teeth, and he released a few more sputtering giggles. Aftershocks. Fear aggregated in the pit of my stomach. I thought his fit was going to start over again anew.

*“It’s just…it’s just such a comical scenario. Let me help you understand. Picture this: you wake up at home. You trudge into the kitchen - starving, depressed, and at your wit's end - just hoping for the smallest, most measly of comforts from your steadfast companion: the toaster. To your complete and utter heartbreak, however, it burns your toast. It burns your toast no matter what, because it’s old and newly broken, and…and then the toaster pipes up and asks you if it’s fired! What a lark! The absurdity! The gall of that appliance, thinking so highly of itself! Oh, yes, certainly, you're fired, and you know what, let me get your severance package…should be at the bottom of this trash compactor…of course I don't mind helping you in, no trouble at all...”*

The implications of that statement shuddered down my spine in waves. Can’t imagine my distress was subtle, but he didn’t seem to react to it. Either he didn’t notice or didn’t really care, the latter being the more likely explanation.

*“All jokes aside, Helen - you’re our most promising refiner. We need you; we really do. And this story you've created is so…fantastical! Grandiose and high-falutin and profoundly, profoundly dumb. Idiotic to the point of parody. Talk about not seeing the forest through the trees! You’re firing a bazooka at point-blank range and somehow still missing the point.* *Ugh, and the narrative choices - just outlandish! The 'meditation'? You, a 'world renowned chemist'? It's hysterical! Finally, a well-deserved ounce of levity for us up top. I'm sure you've seen the state of the compound; the disrepair of our company. To say your 'recollection' has been a much-needed light during some very dark times for upper management would be an egregious undersale. You’re of course planning on finishing it soon, correct?”*

I peeled my gaze away from his bloodshot eyes, sheepishly scratching the back of my neck.

*“Uhm…I’m not sure. I’m struggling…I’m struggling to find the ending. The point of all this isn’t…isn’t as evident to me, I guess. Originally, I thought I was doing it for myself. Like a protest, or a confession, or something. Really, though…really, I was doing it for Linda, but, as you’re well aware…she’s gone.”*

Silence dripped painfully into my ears. All the while, I kept my gaze sequestered to the floor, tracing the lines in the wood flooring repeatedly, waiting for him to respond.

He never did.

Not till I looked back up at him.

For the first and only time, his smile was absent.

*“We can bring her back, you know,”* he said, voice coarse, like it was laced with gravel.

*“I mean,* ***we*** *wouldn’t. Not personally, not directly, but we could put the dominos in motion, and then* ***you’d*** *bring her back. Like I said, you’re our best refiner.”*

My heart began to somersault. My mouth felt dry, nearly moisture-less. I begged my fingers to reach for the *down* button, but they refused to listen. I was paralyzed where I stood.

*“I can’t imagine that’d be pleasant from your side of things. Not one bit. That wouldn’t be the end of it, either. We would dismantle her. You'd* ***watch*** *us dismantle her. Then, you’d bring her back again. Takes talent and genetics to be able to create a Barren, but it takes practice, too. I’d be more than happy to burden you with some very, very specific practice. As much as it took to internalize your position in this hierarchy.”*

*“Am I understood?”* he growled.

I nodded.

Having touched nothing, the elevator chimed, and the doors opened.

*“Perfect! Can’t wait, Helen, truly I can’t wait,”* he purred.

His perfect smile returned. I backpedaled, refusing to take my eyes off of him for even a second. Practically fell as I stumbled into the elevator.

As the doors began to close, he bellowed one last request.

*“Feel free to dramatize this meeting as well! Really excited to see how you spin it, with your tried-and-true piggish emotional density and your apparent grasp on black humor. And, to be clear, this is more than just a creative recommendation, Helen.”*

They shut with a heavy click.

I heard him begin to laugh again as I finally, mercifully, descended.

Took about a minute before I couldn't hear him any longer.

With that out of the way, I suppose I can continue where I left off.

Here's a teaser:

*Why does the carbon-based, non-cellular grease move with purpose?*

***Because it wants to be whole.***

*What’s the unidentifiable five percent?*

***Well, it’s what’s left over, of course.***

***Left over when he’s done with you.***
