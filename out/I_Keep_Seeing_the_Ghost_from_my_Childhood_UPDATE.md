Hi guys. 

Since last night It’s gotten worse. So much worse.
I see her everywhere now, all the time, even outside the confines of my home. Last night she stood over me in bed all night, just gurgling at me. I can feel her spittle on my face as she talks with what must now be a broken jaw dangling out at me. I couldn’t sleep, I just closed my eyes and prayed it stopped. 

She looks worse every day. It’s like she’s decaying. Her skin is mottled and looks rotten, her milky eyes look like marbles, rolling around in their sockets. She won’t leave me alone for even a second. 

I followed your advice and contacted a medium. She took a look around my house for all of fifteen minutes, stared into my bedroom from the doorway, then took off running. Despite her fake tan, she turned white as a sheet. I guess that was a waste of $400. That’s what I get for looking on Facebook Marketplace for spiritual help.  

It’s left me more broke than before and feeling really uneasy. I moved up my psychiatry appointment to this morning. Without sleep, waiting till Monday just wasn’t feasible. The psychiatrist says if I’m having auditory and visual hallucinations, then I’m probably having some kind of schizophrenic break or a psychotic episode. He prescribed me something…I don’t think I’m going to take it. My gut tells me this isn’t in my head, at least not entirely. There’s got to be a reason this entity, whatever she is, is so persistent. 

I called my dad and asked him if I could come visit the house for a bit and he seemed okay with it. I didn’t tell him why, but can you blame me? He’d probably commit me. Carl says he can manage mom for a week if I need to take some time to see dad. My flight is tonight. I guess I’ll update you all from Montana. Wish me luck.

Hi again, 
I figured I would put these updates together since it’s only been a day. 

I got to my dad’s house yesterday and it’s been really nostalgic. I’m back in my childhood bedroom on the second floor. The house is much quieter than it used to be, dad spends less time in the basement, if any at all. I asked him why he’s no longer as interested in his hobbies down there, and he told me his back isn’t what it used to be so he isn’t physically able to do this work anymore…I’m not really sure how a bad back would prevent him from doing taxidermy and carpentry, but I guess it’s not my business. It’s also padlocked now, which he didn’t offer an explanation for, and I didn’t ask. That’s kind of how our relationship has always been, I feel like asking too many questions would only bother him. 

Now, back to the main point. 

I haven’t seen the girl since I arrived, save for one instance. When I got up last night, she was sitting in the corner of my room, curled into a ball. She almost looked pitiable, if not for the repulsive decay of her body. 

I got up and crouched beside her. She wasn’t speaking or doing her chant, and I wondered if something had happened. Maybe this silence signaled the end of her torment of me. The silence, while at first welcome, became eerie. She looked up at me, her dark hair parting down the middle of her palid, rotting face, those milky eyes staring vacantly in my direction. Her mouth opened and I prepared myself to hear her chant again, but the silence continued. I stared at her, her jaw dangling like a ventriloquist dummy. Then, she softly groaned. The air from her open mouth smelled like death and must. I stifled a gag.  A rush of wriggling, white insects began to pour from her open mouth. She wretched as the swarm of maggots spilling from her mouth intensified. Tears streamed from her vacant eyes as the insects continued coming. I fell back away from her, crawling back away from her as quickly as my body could carry me. I involuntarily cried out, and my dad came running, throwing open my bedroom door and frantically looking around. It may have been my imagination, but I swear I saw his eyes lock on the girl. Something like recognition, and perhaps fear, glinted in his eyes. When I turned to look back at her though, she was gone. I told my dad that I had a nightmare and it just startled me out of bed. He nodded, gave me a strange look, and left the room, wishing me goodnight. I returned the sentiment and crawled back into bed. I didn’t sleep again that night. 

Since then there’s been no sign of her, it’s only been 24 hours but I’m hopeful. This is the longest I’ve been without her. My dad has been a little weird today, but I’m sure he was just startled by my episode last night. 

I’ll keep you all posted.
