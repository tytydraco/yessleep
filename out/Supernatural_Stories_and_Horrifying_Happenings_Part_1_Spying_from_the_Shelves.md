I'm writing this hoping someone knows something, or just getting this out there helps someone, or helps me.

This all started five years ago. I had just graduated from university and was working at my local library, the same job I'd worked all throughout school, while I looked for jobs to start my career.

I was working a night shift, putting books away and organizing the shelves. It was a cold autumn night, the wind whistling against the walls. The moon was out in full, its pale light shining through the windows. The lights were dim and flickering, old and useless. As I was going through books, my headphones on and blasting music, the floorboards creaking as I walked between shelves, I came across a book I had never seen before. It was covered in dust, its dark green leather cover weathered with age. The only identifier on the book was an embossed title that read “Supernatural Stories and Horrifying Happenings”. I went to the computer to find where it goes since I didn’t know the book. It didn’t come up in our system so I assumed it was old enough to have dodged the computers and probably sat somewhere in the archives where all the old books go. I opened it to look for an authors name to sort it properly. 

On the first page, it had a regular horror story warning, “All events in the book were, are or will be true. Read at the risk of your sanity.” A stupid cliche that every horror story needs to make it sound scarier from the start. When I turned the next page, instead of a publication page or authors note, or even a table of contents it instead was a title page, numbered 33,716, named “Spying from the Shelves”. Curiosity got the better of me and I decided to read, I was already done most of my work so I figured why not. I sat down at a table in the archives and began to read. The story began by describing a library, a dusty place with old flickering lights and creaky floorboards, on a cold, windy, autumn night. The main character wasn't given a name, but was just refered to as “the character” in the third person. While reading a strange book, he heard something behind him, and when he turned around, something was watching him from the shelves. 

As I read, I felt uncomfortable, the description of the library was too familiar, and then I heard it. A faint, quiet laugh from behind me, muffled by my headphones. I whipped around, scanning the darkness behind me, but couldn't see anything. I turned on my phone flashlight and shined it on the shelves behind me, and there it was. A pair of eyes, staring at me from the second to the top shelf. As soon as the light hit it, it disappeared and I couldn't see what the eyes belonged to. It was then that I realized the book was describing my library, that I was “the character” and that I was being watched. I slammed the book shut and ran to the door to leave. When I reached the exit, the door was locked and my key wasnt working. I ran to the window and got ready to open it and jump out, but when I looked outside, probably ten different pairs of eyes stared at me from bushes and trees and behind road signs and telephone boxes. I heard the laughing again from behind me, and when I turned around, the library was different. 

Hallways the shouldn't be there split off from the walls, shelves twisted and bent, making curved towers stretching to the roof that now was domed and seemed to keep going up. Doors and door frames were scattered on the floor. Everything was wrong. And from every darkened hallway, shadowed shelf and cracked door, a pair of eyes stared at me. I didn't know what to do, this wasn't something you could ever be prepared for, so…

I ran. 

I ran to the closest hallway, shining my light on the eyes, and ran into the darkness. The eyes hid away, and the hallway seemed never ending. I ran for atleast an hour, before coming to a set of stairs downwards. I followed them, just trying to get away from the eyes. At the bottom of the stairs, the hallway turned right, then another right, and then another before a set of stairs leading up to a door was in front if me. It didn’t make any sense, the stairs should've crossed over the ones I just took down, but they didn't. They just were. The laughing was behind me, getting closer. A short, guttural chuckle, that caused me to shiver, the noise unnatural and horrifying. 

I ran up the stairs, each step seeming meaningless as the door never got closer. The laughing was getting louder, echoing off the claustrophobic walls of this hallway. I glanced behind me and saw peeking over every step I had passed on the stairs, a pair of eyes, bloodshot and dilated, staring at me, this time, their mouths were showing, wide unnatural smiles that showed too many teeth, sharp and hungry. If I slowed or fell, I would no doubt be torn apart by those very teeth. I kept climbing, the stairs seeming to get steeper and steeper, the laugh louder and louder, more voices overlapping, each laughing the same way, just in different pitches and speeds. As I climbed, bookshelves began appearing, with eyes and teeth watching me from the ledges, the shelves were everywhere, the roof, the walls, different heights and sizes and everything, but each one had something watching me, laughing at my fear. I was tired, gasping for breath, I had been climbing the stairs for what felt like hours, and pracitcally climbing straight upwards at that point, and finally the door was in front of me. I grabbed the handle and pushed with everything I had, tumbling into the door and falling through, back into the library I knew. 

I glanced back for a second, as the door slowly squeaked closed, and a massive face stared at me, smiling, its teeth yellowed with rotten black spots covering them like sickly polka dots. Its eyes, bloodshot and strained, like they were going to pop out of its head, the pupils pitch black and dilated, taking up most of the eye. It watched me with hungry glee, laughing and smiling and waiting. As though it was expecting me to jump back through to door. Its skin was rotten and peeling, showing raw flesh and bone under. Bugs seemed to crawl within its wounds. Its nose was missing, just showing the holes in the skull where it should be. Its hair was grey and splitting and thinning, its ears had chunks taken out of them, like a animal had gnawed on them. I stood up and slammed the door closed, the laughing becoming muffled before I turned around and it stopped entirely. 

When I turned back, the door was gone. Replaced with a window, the sunrise visible from here. The night had passed, I was alive. And I collapsed, taking deep breaths and trying to calm down. When I finally regained some composure, I went back to the archives where I had been reading the book, but when I got there the book was gone. The table I had sat at was empty, save for a small leather pouch on top. It was tied with a neat bow made of green silk. On the bow was a small note. It read, “For your troubles. Thank you for the inspiration. The Author.” I pulled open the pouch and inside was a detailed coin, made of what looked like gold, it depicted a small bird with the head of a man on one side, and the other side, a phrase in latin circled a book, the latin read “fabulae in hominibus servantur”. Under the coin was a small glass cube, encasing an eyeball, bloodshot and dilated, staring with the same intensity as that face that watched me. I dropped the pouch immediately, it slamming on the desk with a glassy clink. I shuddered, the laugh echoing in my memory. I wrote a note saying I quit at that table, grabbed the pouch and left. 

I never went back to that library.

Nothing has happened since, but I still hear the laughing when I’m alone. The pouch is in a safe in my new apartment. I don't want to keep it, but I can't seem to get rid of it. So I keep it locked away, hoping it can't see me.

If anyone has seen that book anywhere or knows anything about it please let me know, and if you somehow stumble upon it, I hope you are safe.
