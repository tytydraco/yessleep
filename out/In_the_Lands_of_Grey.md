*In the Land of Grey and White- the mist swirls and only shadows stay the night.*

The house was a steal, even for being an obvious fixer upper.  The plan had always been to buy a house, sink money into it over time, and eventually sell for a tidy profit. Timelines were fuzzy but the 10 to 15 year ballpark to modernize and overhaul did not seem entirely out of the question.  The usual problem with these kinds of setups would be buying sight unseen but we had done our research and walked the floor plan at least a dozen times over the course of the negotiations.  This is what made stumbling upon the door so bizarre.  
  
“Tiff…?” I started, looking back over my shoulder to see if she was still in the living room. “Hey! Tiffany! What’s with this door?” I half shouted when I realized her unpacking must have taken her to another area of the house.  I heard her coming down the stairs before I saw her round the corner into the hallway.  
  
“What door?” she asked, puzzled.  
  
I motioned to the door at the end of the main hallway. The house had an older layout. Not the open concept that became so popular over the last couple of decades. Pretty much every path through the house converged here. To get upstairs was one stairway off the hall, the basement on the other end and the kitchen, an office, a bathroom, living room, TV room, and a guest room all branching directly off the hallway. Exactly where they had been on the multiple tours they took. Everything was accounted for...   
  
Everything but the door at the very end of the hallway, where a plain wall should be, a door stood in defiance of common sense and experience.  
  
“I don’t remember ever seeing that on our walk throughs, is it a small closet? Maybe it was covered up or something?”  She asked as I continued to stare at the end of the hall. We both walked towards the door as I let the questions hang unanswered in the air.  
  
The door itself was also strange. While the wood matched the rest of the doors in the house, it had no knob but instead four holes placed a few centimeters apart on the far left side. They were slender and deep, as if you were meant to pull the door open with your fingers in them.  I slid my pointer finger in the highest hole on the side. “I don’t remember there being anything in the hall to cover this.” I said as my finger slid all the way in.  
  
“Careful!” Tiffany exclaimed suddenly.  
  
I nodded as I pulled on the door, a metal click could be heard but the door didn’t move any further. “It’s stuck on something, sounds like it’s locked almost” I stated, my finger still curled around the door through the hole.  
  
“It doesn’t look like there’s a lock, there isn’t even a knob…” Tiffany trailed off towards the end, letting the statement hang in the air for a few moments.  
  
“Yeah, weird…”  
  
We both stood at the new door and a stunned silence had washed over us. Though I'm no locksmith or architect, I knew a few things for sure: the door would not open despite my pulling and there was no obvious locking mechanism on the outside. Moreover, whatever lay beyond the door must be windowless, as there wasn’t a corresponding one on the outside of the house.  
  
We stood quietly looking at the door for what seemed like an eternity until Tiffany eventually broke the silence. "Well, as much fun as this mystery door is, we still have lots of boxes to unpack!"  
	  
“Yeah… yeah, you’re right.” I said, only just noticing that my finger was still wrapped firmly through the top hole of the door. I let go and we both got back to unpacking. The mystery of the door passed into the back of both of our minds as all of the normal logistical issues of moving into a new house held our attention.  
  
At some point between deciding which drawer in the kitchen was officially to become the junk drawer (the one on the left of the stove, if anyone was curious) and setting up a wall mounted TV in the living room, the door faded out of my mind and the task of unpacking became the singular focus. Nearly a month passed in that time; between being busy at jobs, unpacking and settling into our new home, and meeting the neighbours, the door continued to fade into obscurity. For all I knew, the door could have stopped existing entirely for the next month and I would have been none the wiser.  
  
We could have continued on in that state for years. Maybe even fully refurbishing the house and selling it before the door ever returned to the forefront of our minds. Instead, we blew a fuse. For anyone that doesn’t live in the northeast, you might not understand how cold the winters can get. Being near the ocean didn’t do us any favours, either.  Long winter nights paired with bone cutting ocean winds and old to nonexistent insulation landed us with our first adult purchase for our new old home: a small space heater. The heater wasn’t big or fancy. Just enough to keep it pleasant in our shared office. Silence and darkness enveloped us all at once. Gone were the glows of computer screens, the whir of fans and the beats of the music we had been listening to.  
  
“Is it a blackout?” Tiffany asked fumbling for her phone’s flashlight.  
	  
I moved over to the window to check the rest of the street, “Hmmm, I don’t think so. The house down the road has all of its lights on and the street lights are still on too. We must’ve blown a fuse or something. The heater probably just overloaded the old thing.” I said getting out my own flashlight app and bathing the office in a cool white.  
  
With our lights leading the way we came out into the hallway, making for the basement stairs when I froze. Projected on the far wall were four perfect circles of not-light. I say not-light because I don’t want to give the image of four little light dots on the wall. Instead the circles were more akin to old TV static than actual light but even that didn’t do the phenomenon justice. I turned back and saw the door, the door I had forgotten for the last month. The door we had dismissed as a simple oddity for far too long. Tiffany saw the dots as well.  
  
“I’ve never seen a gray LED like that.” she said. A lightning bolt of recognition struck me. What my brain had cataloged as TV static was in actuality a strange, fuzzy, grey shade of light.  
  
“Why is that room on a different power source than the rest of the house? Is it hooked up to some kind of generator?” I asked aloud as we continued to make our way down to the basement. Without waiting for any kind of answer I firmly stated, “I’m getting in that room once the power’s back.”  
  
We made our way back down the hallway to the basement stairs leaving the ever growing mystery of the door behind. As we descended the creaky steps, I couldn't help but feel a shiver run down my spine. There was something eerie about being in this old house during a power outage. Tiffany must have felt it too, as she was walking close to me and had a tight grip on my arm.  
  
When we reached the bottom of the stairs, Tiffany fumbled for the light switch, but nothing happened.  
  
"Great," she muttered, “Whatever is powering that room isn’t powering the basement.”  
  
I nodded. Even though I knew she couldn't see me as our flashlight beams struggled to pierce the endless black for the fuse box. We felt our way along the wall slowly making our way towards the back of the basement. I remembered the general location of the box but navigating the basement was difficult in the dark. Especially with the random collection of miscellaneous items representing two lives scattered around the room.   
  
Suddenly, I heard a faint sound, like the shuffling of feet.  
  
"Tiff, did you hear that?" I whispered.  
  
She paused for a moment, then shook her head. "I didn't hear anything. Are you sure it wasn't just the house settling?"  
  
I wasn't convinced, but I didn't want to scare her. "Yeah, you're probably right. Let's just keep going."  
  
We finally reached the fuse box, and Tiffany started flipping switches. After a few tries, the power came back on.  
  
"Thank goodness," Tiffany exclaimed, visibly relieved.  
  
As we made our way back up to the main floor, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. Maybe it was just the power outage, but I couldn't help the thought that there was something else going on in this house.  
  
As we returned to the main floor the door stood just as silent and eerie as we had left it with one major difference, the strange dots no longer appeared on the far wall.  Even placing my palm near the holes could not replicate the strange grey light, it was as if someone inside hit the light switch on whatever strange bulb had been there before. My brain raced back to the shuffling sound from earlier, conjuring horrible images of shapeless monsters, knife wielding serial killers, and eldritch horrors.  
  
With slight confusion and major apprehension, I put my finger back into the top hole, this time feeling around a bit more when a faint click sound could be heard as I depressed a small switch.  
  
“I think I found whatever was keeping it locked!” I cried out, the level of excitement shocked even me for a moment and I could see Tiffany jerk in surprise out of the corner of my eye. “Sorry.” I said sheepishly as I pulled on the door. A louder, deeper click rang out as the door met with further resistance. I put my other three fingers into the holes and felt more switches around each. Pushing down on all the switches at once I pulled the door towards me for the third time, and finally it began to pull away from the frame, opening onto a darkened room.  
  
A totally empty, boring, ordinary, darkened room.  Thoughts of elder gods and shadow monsters rushed away as the practical adult took over once more. The colors of the walls were the same as the rest of the house: an off white. The trim? The same. The overhead light fixture? The same. The carpet? The same (if not a bit more of a “vibrant” tan due to the lack of sun bleaching).   
  
This room seemed to be smack dab in the middle of the house. No windows to the outside and the only egress inside being the hallway. Any logical builder would have put a set of windows on the outer facing walls but no such window existed. Nothing about the room’s placement made any sense. The interior was as plain as any of the other rooms in the house. Basically, the size of a small guest room or a very large walk in closet. For all intents and purposes, aside from the odd door and strange placement, it was a totally normal room. I fiddled with the light switch but the bulb was either not in the fixture or it had burned out somewhere between us noticing the not-lights and turning the power back on.  
  
“On the upside, it’s not a murder room.” I said half joking. A small part of me hoped that the room would be something interesting to break up the monotony of adult life. A larger part of me was excited that we basically got a whole room thrown in on our original offer for free.  Becoming an adult is truly the death of imagination.  
  
“We could convert this into a cute little study! Or storage! Or a nursery when the time is right!” I could already tell Tiffany was running through a list of interior design DIY projects with our new found extra room. She turned in a quick little circle, taking in the room in its entirety and paused suddenly.  “What’s that?” she asked, pointing towards the top of the door.  
  
Even with my flashlight shining directly on the door frame it was difficult to make out the words without squinting.  I said the words out loud as I slowly traced my fingers along the scrawling cursive writing, “In the Land of Grey and White - the mist swirls and only shadows stay the night.”  
  
A strange spark of static ran through me while my mouth became dry as I turned back to Tiffany. “This room must have belonged to some kid who wanted to play a prank on the new owners.” I said with a half chuckle. I think the words were an attempt to make myself believe it more than to comfort Tiff.   
  
I took a deep breath, closed my eyes and collected myself.  
  
“I think that’s enough excitement for one night.” I finally said, letting out the breath I hadn’t realized I was holding. Tiffany crossed the room and took my hand and with that we retired for the night. Any projects we had been working on prior to the blown fuse were forgotten for the time being. Our singular thoughts were of bed. I fell asleep nearly the second my head hit the pillow, as cliche as it sounds, the strange discoveries of the evening had really taken it out of me.  
  
Ever since I was a kid I’ve been able to remember dreams. Growing up, my mother had had a new aged medicine friend (we’re talking crystals, incense, oils: the whole shabang) who told me I had a natural predilection for lucid dreaming. All of this to say that it was not out of the ordinary for me to have vivid dreams. I woke up within the dream, laying in bed and looking up to the ceiling. I looked to my left and Tiffany wasn’t in bed, this fact combined with the decor now matching my childhood room as opposed to Tiffany’s design choices made me realize that it was a dream. I stood up and suddenly I was in front of the room, the odd door already open.  Against my will I moved forward across the threshold.  
  
As I stepped into the small room I felt a chill run down my spine. The air was thick with an eerie stillness and a sense of foreboding hung over me like a dark cloud. It was as if I had entered one of those liminal spaces, a space that existed between multiple planes of reality, a place where the laws of physics were distorted and the boundaries of the physical world blurred.  
  
The room was dimly lit by a single flickering grey bulb casting eerie shadows on the walls. The walls themselves seemed to shift and waver as if they were made of some kind of liquid that was constantly in motion. I could hear strange whispers and murmurs in the air, voices that seemed to come from all around me and yet nowhere at the same time.  
  
As I walked further into the room I felt a growing sense of unease. It was as if I was being watched by unseen eyes. I suddenly had the distinct feeling that something was lurking in the shadows, waiting for me to let my guard down. The floor beneath my feet felt unsteady; as if it was made of shifting sand rather than solid ground.  
  
I tried to shake off the feeling of dread that was building inside me but, it was impossible. The room seemed to be alive and pulsating with a malevolent energy that was palpable to the senses. I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end; my heart pounding in my chest.  
  
I knew that I needed to get out of the room as soon as possible but my feet seemed rooted to the ground. It was as if I was being held captive by the dark forces that were at work in this strange, otherworldly place. As the whispers grew louder and the shadows grew darker, I forced my eyes closed tight trying to regain some semblance of control over the situation.  
  
When I opened my eyes again, the room became more solid. The walls and floor stopped their antics and remained motionless. Where once there was a totally empty room, there was now a chair and a man in a suit that swam and swirled like the walls had before. On his head rested a pinstripe fedora and on his lap a briefcase. I tried to open my mouth but I stood paralyzed. I was even powerless to close my eyes as I felt the burning sensation of so many childhood staring contests set in as the man began to rise and turn.  
  
He was tall. Taller than me. Must've been pushing 6’5”.   
  
As he finished turning towards me I was pulled in by how dark his eyes were (my thoughts immediately went to “Vantablack”. I had never seen the colour in person but the complete lack of light in the stranger’s eyes made me believe that this must be what it looked like). The second thing I noticed was the flawless chocolate skin of the stranger. While the shadowy liquid of his suit rippled and spiraled, his skin was a smooth unmoving velvet.  With his briefcase by his side he walked forward until we were mere inches apart from each other.   
  
He leaned in even closer and in that moment he said the single most terrifying word he could: “Marcus.”  
  
I became aware of my own screaming first, then the familiar sights of our bedroom, and finally Tiffany’s shaking and pleading, “...wrong? Marcus! It was just a dream! What happened, what’s wrong?” She repeated the phrase a few more times like a mantra as I sat panting in a cold sweat.  
  
After a few more minutes I had finally caught my breath and senses enough to answer. It was barely over a whisper but I answered her: “He knew my name…”  
  
Tiffany's expression changed from concern to fear as I whispered those words. "What do you mean, he knew your name?" she asked, her voice trembling.  
  
I shook my head, struggling to find the right words to describe the terror I had experienced in the dream. "I don't know Tiff...it was just the way he said it. Like he knew me... like he'd always known me... and he'd been waiting."  
  
Tiffany wrapped her arms around me, trying to comfort me. "It was just a dream, Marcus. A bad dream. It's over now." she spoke softly and calmly as she held me.  
  
Despite her words trying to guarantee it was just a dream and now over, I knew that wasn’t the case and it was just the beginning. The dream had felt too real - too vivid - to be just a product of my imagination. And the stranger, with his Vantablack eyes and liquid-swirling suit, seemed too detailed to be a mere figment of my subconscious.  
  
I couldn't shake off the feeling that he was still out there, waiting for me. The worst part was, I didn't know what he wanted or why he had appeared in my dream. Obviously, he had something to do with the strange room... but what?  
  
Over the next few days, I became increasingly anxious and paranoid. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the stranger's face, his dark eyes boring into mine. I started to have trouble sleeping, and when I did manage to drift off, I was plagued by nightmares despite my attempts to control my dreams as I had all my life. I had even started nodding off at work finding myself springing awake at my desk unsure how much time had passed since I had fallen asleep.  
  
One night, as I lay in bed, I heard the ghost of the sound from days ago in the basement. It was a soft rustling, like someone moving around quietly.   
  
A cold sweat broke out along my skin as I got out of bed and crept towards the door, trying to make as little noise as possible. I turned back to face the bed. Tiffany was curled up tightly under the blankets with only her face showing from the covers.  
  
Before I even reached the bottom of the stairs I saw the not-lights on the far wall. I froze as waves of chills and nausea washed over me. I stole myself and continued down the stairs.   
  
Under my breath I whispered to myself, “This is how everyone dies in the movies Marc, don’t be stupid.” but I continued on just the same until I once again stood in front of the door.   
  
As I peered into the darkness of the room, I saw a figure standing by the window. It was the stranger from my dream, his liquid-like suit now perfectly still, his fedora tilted at a jaunty angle on his head.  
  
I froze, unable to move or speak. The stranger turned his head towards me, his Vantablack eyes glinting in the moonlight. He raised his pointer finger to brush against the faint smile on his lips in an almost mocking, “Shhh…” motion.   
  
Then he was gone, vanishing into thin air.  
  
I stood there for what felt like hours, too terrified to move. When I finally regained my senses, I ran to the phone and called the police. Just like every movie, every spooky campfire tale, every Goddamned Shakspearean play even, they found no sign of forced entry and no evidence of anyone being in the house besides Tiffany and myself. They searched, what we had taken to calling “The Grey Room”, thoroughly.   
  
No secret buttons or hidden switches, just a normal, empty room.  To their credit, the police took the whole ordeal very seriously despite a total lack of evidence to support my claims.  I’m sure they thought I was sleepwalking or daydreaming or Hell, maybe they chalked it up to some random dude having a bad trip in the middle of the night.  
  
After the police had gone, assuring us multiple times that there was no one in the house, I began to tell Tiffany what happened as we sat at the kitchen table; coffees forgotten in our hands. She sat and patiently listened to the whole story and when I was finally done she spoke slowly, barely above a whisper. “Marc, you said you saw the stranger standing near the window.”  She let the statement hang in the air for a moment before turning to fully face me.   
  
“Yeah, I could see the moonlight on him, that's how I knew he was the same person from my dream.”  
  
“But we both know that there isn’t a window in that room.” Tiff said as the chills and nausea from earlier all came flooding back to me two fold.  
  
Suddenly I was up and moving leaving Tiffany behind in the kitchen. I ran to the door. My fingers struggled with the mechanisms for  just a single moment but I swung the door open and entered the room.   
  
The totally ordinary, empty, windowless room.  
  
Any remaining speculation I had was wiped from my mind at that moment, I knew then that the stranger from my dream was real, and that he wanted something from me.  No matter how hard I tried to fight it, I couldn't escape the feeling of his dark eyes following me, even when I was wide awake.  
  
The days turned into weeks, and my obsession with the stranger grew. Tiff and I had started to refer to him as Vanta or Vantablack due to my description of his eyes. Tiffany still hadn't seen or felt anything but she remained steadfast in her belief in my story when she could have just as easily dismissed everything as some crackpot delusion of a quarter life crisis.   
  
Soon, a month had passed since the night the police had searched the room. In that time I had started researching everything I could about the supernatural, the occult, and any other esoteric knowledge that might shed light on my experiences. But the more I delved into the subject, the more I realized how little I knew and how vast the unknown truly was. It also wasn't helpful that so many of the accounts I would find researching online were unreliable at best. This, coupled with the fact that I still couldn’t get a consistent full night’s sleep, made research arduous at best and pointless at worst.  
  
One such night while unable to sleep, I found myself sitting in the living room surrounded by books and articles about dreams, lucid dreaming, remote viewing, and astral projection. I had read about the concept of traveling to different realms or realities through dreams and a thought crossed my mind. What if Vanta and the room were somehow connected to a different plane of existence? What if they were manifestations of a hidden dimension, a realm that existed beyond our comprehension? It made as much sense as anything else and it helped explain the window I would see in dreams and when Vanta was present. If I were somehow accessing some other universe (or he was accessing mine), perhaps the builder in that timeline had installed a window where one didn't exist in our world.  
  
As the clock ticked closer to midnight I made a decision: I would attempt to enter the dream world once again, to confront the suited stranger, and uncover the secrets of the room. I prepared myself mentally, since Vantablack had appeared in the waking world I had attempted to force myself to stop dreaming all together or more accurately I just forced myself to dream of a black screen but even then I would sometimes be pulled away into nightmares that were hazy upon waking.  
  
Finally, exhaustion took hold and I drifted into a fitful sleep. This time I was determined to guide my dream. The familiar black screen flew up to meet me and I focused on what I wanted. I focused on the mental image of the cursive script above the door frame and soon the environment shifted. Usually when I was lucid dreaming and I wanted to change my dream it felt like flipping channels on a television, but this felt vastly different. The best way I can describe it was turning. First my body turned, the sensation was like turning a corner extremely tightly in a hallway, a near 90 degree turn.  Once my body finished, the same sensation happened again but instead of feeling it physically, I felt it mentally, like my mind turned. Even that description doesn't do it justice, however.  
  
I was standing in the familiar room, moonlight shone in from the window. I knew that this was my chance to venture further, to try and find answers and to hopefully rid myself of Vanta. The room felt different now, the air heavy with anticipation, as if it were aware of my purpose. The letters of the cursive were bright and vibrant. I could read them from where I stood instead of having to trace to make them out like in the real world.  
  
I found the window and while the moonlight was bright, casting the shadow of the window onto the floor, the window itself was opaque. I wasn't able to see through it to the outside world. Taking a deep breath, I stepped forward and placed my hand on the window, the glass cool against the palm of my hand. I barely had time to register the sensation before the room transformed around me. The walls dissolved into a swirling mist of grey and white, and the floor beneath my feet seemed to vanish, leaving me suspended in an ethereal void.  
  
As I floated in this otherworldly space, I felt a strange sensation, as if my consciousness was being pulled in different directions. I focused on the image of Vanta, specifically his pinstripe fedora, willing myself to find him.  
  
Suddenly, the mist parted and my feet hit solid ground, revealing a desolate landscape stretching out before me. A slow realization dawned on me that I was in our side yard. I turned around and there stood our house, the window to the grey room now transparent.  I could still make out the glowing script from where I stood outside as well as the chair I had originally seen Vanta sitting in. Turning back away from the house I took in the rest of the environment.   
  
The land was devoid of colour, a monochromatic expanse of greys. A thick mist clung to everything, swirling and shifting, obscuring my vision and making the familiar scenes of our yard strange and intangible. It was an eerie and unsettling sight, but I pressed on. As I left the yard surrounding our house, the environment stopped resembling the real world, and by the time I reached the end of our driveway nothing familiar remained. With each step I took, the mist thickened, making it difficult to see more than a few feet ahead. I continued to move forward, time lost all meaning, I couldn't tell if I had been walking for minutes or hours.  Every once in a while I would turn around, the house grew smaller and harder to see so I was at least making progress.  "Well, unless I'm standing still and the house is moving away..." I mumbled to myself aloud.  
  
Looking back ahead I saw his eyes first. Black spheres piercing the mist. His silhouette was distinct against the grey and white backdrop, his liquid-like suit now flowing and undulating with an otherworldly energy.  As I moved closer it became apparent that Vanta stood atop a hill. As the mist continued to swirl and recede a squat concrete structure emerged from behind him. I ascended the hill and soon stood directly in front of him.  
  
"Marcus." He spoke, his voice resonating in the stillness of the land.  
  
I opened my mouth to respond but no words came out. I tried again trying to focus but my thoughts swirled away from me, gone with the mist that used to hide Vanta and the hill itself.   
  
With a hand he motioned around him, "This is the Lands of Gray."  
  
"...and White." I added remembering the elegant cursive written above the door. A smile crossed his lips, the same small "Shhh..." smile from over a month ago when he had invaded my home.  
  
"No." he stated flatly, letting his voice once again punctuate the silent world we stood in. "The Lands of Gray is where we are now. Think of this as a train station, a terminal with many branching paths leading one way or another. The Land of Gray and White is through here.  Although, the seal is weakening and the mist that the Land of Gray and White is known for is beginning to bleed through into the terminal."  It was the longest he had ever spoken, his voice was deep and calm, yet still threatening. As he finished his explanation he stepped aside revealing the door frame of the building. The frame held the same exact four holed door from our house, mist seeping through the holes pooling to the ground like dry ice.  
  
All of the stress of the past month caught up to me in a single moment. Sketchy shadow man be damned, I was done. "What do you want with me? You come into my house, make me feel like I'm going insane and now we're supposed to embark on some rip roaring adventure through some fucking Lovecraftian ghost land attached to my spare room?"  
  
Vanta's lips began to move but no sound came out. He paused, adjusted his hat and began again. "You're not ready to hear the secret."  
  
“I don’t want to hear the secret. I don’t want to explore some twisted dream reality. I don’t want some freak in a fedora ruining my sleep. I just want you to stay out of my damn house!” I finished, exasperated as my final statement echoed around the empty Land of Grey.  
  
Vanta waited for the last ‘ouse’ to finish bouncing around the monochromatic landscape before locking his eyes on mine. The dark holes bore into me and the bravado leaked away from me as if through a sieve. “Even if it could help you find Evan?”  
  
I shot awake, the dream world gone in an instant, replaced by the living room. Papers, books and my laptop went sprawling away from me with a crash.  I heard footsteps from upstairs while I caught my bearings, I must have woken Tiffany. I silently cursed myself as I looked at my watch: 12:35.  
  
Tiffany rounded the corner frantically, she had a vase of pampas grass raised above her head ready to bring it down on the fictional intruder’s head. The emotions on her face passed in a blur from fear to worry to anger before finally landing on annoyed concern.  
  
“He has Evan.”
