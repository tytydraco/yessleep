I know it's been awhile since yinz last heard from me. Rest assured, there is a very good reason for that. 

Remember that chairman that Victor and Briar terrorized? He disappeared a couple of days after the Avalon's indefinite postponement was announced. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U) 

Naturally, our first thought was that the Hunters were responsible. It would only make sense, considering the development's board has been on the Hunt's shitlist thanks to all of the deforestation that they're responsible for. But then later that week, another man vanished, leaving his wife and three kids without a trace. And it didn't end there.

Over the span of two weeks, a total of five different men from five completely unrelated backgrounds had gone missing. 

To narrow things down, I thought it best to confirm any possible involvement with the Hunt directly with the mechanic. 

Due to the polar vortex, we’ve had to change up where our training sessions take place. For those who haven't been affected by this extreme winter weather, I'll summarize by saying that temperatures dropped to the point of being unsafe to be outside for any extended period of time. 

To my chagrin, our new, temporary arena was below the Mounds. As yinz could probably imagine, I did not appreciate this suggested change. At all. 

“It ain't gonna be like the last time,” He'd been annoyed by my reluctance. “For one thing, you'll be armed. For another, I'm the one bringin' you there. I wouldn't throw ya to the *malwr*. Though, gotta say, on some days, that idea is *mighty* temptin’.”

Feeling extra stupid as I got into his truck to get some relief from the terrible weather, I asked with my teeth chattering, “What's the *malwr*?”

He wasn't tolerating the cold much better than I was. I wondered if he was cold-blooded, considering that he looked similar to an insect beneath his disguise. It was safe to assume that his physiology worked the same way. But then again, one would think that he would've been instantly frozen within a few hours of the winter storm coming in, if that were the case. 

Thankfully, that old truck's heater gets warm quickly, despite its vintage status. Iolo set his hands on either vent closest to him, presumably to dethaw his fingers. The backs of his hands were bright red, the skin looking chapped, between his work and the weather. 

“That serpent ya loved so much,” He said with a snicker. “It woulda *loved* you even more!”

Suppressing a shudder at the memory of an amputated arm falling between the huge snake's scales, I retorted, “You’re not doing a very good job of convincing me that this isn’t a horrible idea.”

Wordlessly, he briefly took one hand off the vent and with the click of a button, the truck’s locks sank into the doors. 

Giving him a harsh stare, I delivered what had to have been ground-breaking news to him, “You know, you won’t die if you stop being a psychopath for five minutes.”

He cheerfully responded, “Yeah, but why risk it?”

*Fucking jagoff.*

However, he did unlock the truck. Then he simply watched, waiting to see what I’d do. In the end, I told Victor where we were going and what was happening in case something went wrong. If he didn't hear from me in the next hour, there'd be a search party dispatched. 

While I still don’t trust the mechanic, I could at least trust that his possessiveness would keep him from allowing anything else below the Mounds to harm me. And like he’d pointed out, I was going to have Ratcatcher with me this time and, most importantly, I would be adequately clothed. 

“Fine, let’s go.” I muttered, wondering how long it was going to take for me to regret this decision.

As it turns out, not long. When he reached over me into the glovebox, I eyeballed him suspiciously, prepared to fight him both physically and verbally if he attempted to sedate me. 

The proximity of the glove compartment put him uncomfortably close to me as Iolo gave me a withering look, “Relax. Just a blindfold this time. We ain’t goin’ to the cabin. This is just ‘cause the journey to the other side can be a bit… let’s say, *discombobulatin’,* for mortals.”

Even though I hated this idea, it was considerably better than getting dosed again. And after my encounter with the Replacement, I was inclined to believe him about the journey being strenuous for humans. With incredible reluctance, I sat still as he tied what felt like a bandana over my eyes while somehow managing not to get any of my hair caught in the knot. 

As he did so, he muttered, “You'll thank me when you still have your mind.”

On a related note, I had not gotten much control over the second sight by that point. And to be honest, I still don't. At least the migraine and fever have subsided, though I have been getting headaches more often than usual. When it came to my current predicament, I was morbidly curious about if my newfound curse/blessing would alter the way that I experienced the Mounds compared to my last unwilling visit. 

Once Iolo was assured that I couldn't see anything, I felt the truck beginning to move. Not having much better to do while my eyes were covered, that was when I chose to bring up the chairperson's disappearance.  

When he responded, he sounded somewhere between amused and embittered, “Someone else had more claim on him than we did. Shame, too. Woulda been somethin’ to turn him inside out.”  

That was *not* a pleasant mental image. 

While visions of exposed organs danced in my head, I almost asked a stupid question, “Who would- *Oh.* The Wood Maiden.”

It made sense. The chairperson was one of those responsible for attempting to destroy her home, after all. Meanwhile, he hadn't caused any direct harm to the Hunters. Claims are held in high regard to the Neighbors, and even the mechanic has to accommodate that. A fact that has saved my life on more than one occasion.  

When it came to the disappearances, local law enforcement had ended up calling Orion after they found peculiar moss growing in each of the missing men's homes. As such, Wes and Reyna had been tasked to aid the sheriff’s department in their search for the missing people. But that was before I got to speak to the mechanic. 

Now that I had more information, I formulated a plan to search the woods by the Avalon construction site the day following this dubious training session. Even though I doubted that any of these poor souls were still alive, if someone I cared about were to go missing, I wouldn’t want anyone responsible for finding them to give up on them. It was worth a try, at the very least. I would love to be wrong about those men being dead. 

Morbidly speaking, I suppose I was. But I’ll get to that. And before I could entertain the idea of finding any of them, I had to deal with the banjo bastard on his home turf first. 

Once the blindfold was removed, I discovered that the truck was parked in a field of purple flowers. The exact same ones that shielded me while I was lost down there. The petals were soft against my fingers as I delicately touched one. At the same time, I tilted my chin up, watching as those strange lights twinkled above me in the din. 

Even though being below the Mounds again made me intensely uneasy, I will admit that it was nice to be somewhere that was warm enough that I could take my heavy coat off. I can’t emphasize enough that Pennsylvania had been a frozen hellscape for the past week. And as dangerous and horrifying as the Mounds could be, their world really is breathtaking. 

“What are they?” I asked curiously. “The things that look like stars?”

Tossing his own coat off to lay it on the side of the truck’s bed, Iolo knelt on to his tailgate to retrieve the wooden sword, telling me ominously, “As far as you're concerned, they're just that: *stars.*”

*Excellent. I love it here.*

Before he'd leapt back out of the truck, it occurred to me that his back was turned. As such, I took a page out of his book, making the split-second decision to turn the tables on him and strike first. Disappointingly, he simply ducked away, moving further into the bed while giving me yet another annoyed look. 

I held Ratcatcher up towards him, ready for his retaliation.

“The fuck was that?” He demanded. 

It was hard to tell if my answer amused him or irritated him further. Probably a combination of both. “Just keeping you on your toes.” 

He shook his head at me with a short laugh that sounded more like a warning than anything else. “Alright.”

He had to jump over the side of his truck's bed when I went for him again. It wasn't often that I went on the offensive with him, and I'm irked to say that it showed. Most of the time, the majority of my training sessions were spent defending myself against an onslaught by him or one of his colleagues. I was definitely out of my element, which the banjo bastard did not hesitate to point out after the way I dared to pester him. 

“What’s wrong, Fiona?” He asked snidely, stepping away from another horizontal slash that I’d aimed towards his nose. “Is it that much harder to go at someone when their back ain’t turned?”

“You should’ve known better than to leave yourself so open.” I told him petulantly, blocking a strike that probably would’ve given me a concussion if I’d been even a second later.

The mechanic chuckled, circling me slowly, “Yeah, I’ll grant ya that. Even so, gotta say, you’re *really* disappointin’ me right now. Thought you were above such cowardice.” 

“You’ve never hesitated to exploit *anyone’s* weaknesses.” I pointed out. “Why should I hesitate to exploit yours?”

His smile became mysterious as he told me, “Now you’re thinkin’ like a Hunter.”

I didn't like the way he said that. Still don't, for the record. 

Not long after, Iolo had me on the defensive, forcing me to block a flurry that rivaled the brutality of the winter storm ravaging our region. As soon as I got the chance to, I danced away, trying to get out of his reach. He wasn't relenting. When he went for my midsection, I parried, but failed to successfully disarm him.  

While ducking away from his next slash, I remarked, “At some point, you really need to teach me that bullshit you pulled on me that one time.”

Lo and behold, when I attempted to strike him, he did *exactly* the maneuver I had mentioned, twisting the sword in such a manner that it wrenched Ratcatcher from my hand. 

Looking devious, he chirped, “You mean *that* bullshit?”

Glowering at him, I didn't have the energy to dignify that with a response. Rather, I counted on my expression to speak for me.  

The rest of the session constituted me failing to learn that move. It was essentially parrying, but with even more precise timing, and I know I've mentioned previously that I've only recently gotten comfortable doing that. 

To sum up the rest of that training session, it was filled with disappointment. I'll get it eventually, but it'll be a while. Of course, me getting my rear end handed to me in a perfectly wrapped package while contending with the mechanic shouldn't be news to anyone. 

By the time training ended, I was amazed at how many different ways I could be made to drop my own sword. Not something I wanted to learn about myself, but, shit happens, right? 

In other, more exciting developments, I met the Wood Maiden. 

Following the Hunger Grass incident, Orion had made repeated attempts to calm her with offerings prior to this encounter. These attempts included the classic (cream), honey, baked goods, raw meat, and even freshly cut flowers. She left every single one untouched. 

Before venturing into the woods with a jar of honey in hand, I informed my colleagues of my plan. At first, there was some contention from Victor about letting me go alone, but I reasoned that more than one of us showing up could be perceived as threatening. He sustained that he still thought it was a terrible idea, but he, Wes, and Reyna all had calls they were dealing with, leaving Deirdre to hold down the fort; our office was stretched thin. 

And before anyone else asks: no, we are not currently hiring. Vic has made it clear that he has no intentions of onboarding anyone else any time soon. 

When it came to the jar of honey, I wasn't  certain that it would do much good, considering that the Wood Maiden had rejected everything thus far, but turning up empty-handed *and* armed could potentially anger her further. And I was not about to show up in an aggrieved Neighbor's territory without some sort of protection. 

Before crossing the threshold into the trees, I heard something that gave me pause: *Deirdre.* 

(Edit: It has come to my attention that the song I'm about to describe has a weird effect on those that speak Danish. Please take caution going forward.)

She was singing. But why was she there? 

*“Drøymde mik ein draum i nótt
um silki ok ærlig pell,
um hægindi svá djupt ok mjott,
um rosemd með engan skell.”*

While I'm not well versed in the language, that didn’t sound like Gaelic. And as far as I knew, she spoke only that and English. 

Something wasn’t right.

Suspiciously, I looked around while withdrawing my phone, calling the office. Sure enough, Deirdre answered. So something *was* imitating her. Afterwards, I assured her that everything was alright, I just needed to confirm that this was a trick. She urged me to be careful and to call her the moment I got done. 

*“Ok i drauminom ek leit
sem gegnom ein groman glugg
þá helo feigo mennsko sveit,
hver sjon ol sin eiginn ugg.”*

I swear, if I had a dollar for every time I've had to follow ominous music into the woods, I'd probably have enough to open a second location for Orion.

Jaw tight with anticipation, I followed the song, apprehensive about who or what I would find.

When I located the singer, I froze in place. The figure was turned away from me. White hair, loose and wavy around her shoulders. Navy blue Orion Pest Control jacket. Slight, demure stature. 

It looked *just like her.*

*“Friðinn, ef hann finzt, er hvar
ein firrest þann mennska skell,
fær veggja sik um, drøma þar
um silki ok ærlig pell.”*

Her shadow. It was strangely long, not matching the golden light of the setting sun as it moved independently of her, traveling in an arc towards my right. I followed it with my eyes with my hand poised over Ratcatcher’s hilt. 

The Not Deirdre's head turned, giving me a lovely smile, just as warmly as the real thing. Her eyes even twinkled like twin stars. 

Normally, when I encounter imitations like this, there's always something that's just not quite right about them. Maybe it's their eyes, or their body language, or their speech patterns. Whatever the tell may be, there's always that little alarm bell that rings in your head at the sight of such uncanniness. The best comparison is that same discomfort that most people feel when they see a wax figure that looks a little too human. 

However, save for singing a song in the wrong language, this imposter was damn near perfect. 

Then Not Deirdre suddenly began clawing at her chest, eyes going wide. A shuddering, agonized whimper escaped her open mouth as she crumpled to her knees. 

*It's not real. It's not her.*

Even knowing it was a trick, I had to grit my teeth, tears clouding my vision as I sought the source of that bizarre shadow. It was closer. 

Not Deirdre's red lips kept making shapes as if she were struggling to speak, tears streaming from her eyes. Weakly, she reached for me, pleading silently for help with one pale, shaking hand.  

A new voice drifted on the biting, winter wind, “You must not love her very much.”

Resisting the urge to tell this newcomer to go fuck themselves, I blinked to clear the tears from my eyes, feeling them freeze on my cheeks in the bitter wind as I withdrew the sword. 

The Wood Maiden finally strode into view. A gown matching the same deep green of pine needles swayed with each step, revealing that she was barefoot despite the snow. She held a hand up by her waist, fingers curling slowly, in time with Not Deirdre's movements. A puppeteer pulling a marionette's strings. It was also worth noting that those fingers were tipped with brown, sharply-curved claws. 

The Wood Maiden appeared to be the same height as Reyna, making it so I had to look down at her once she got close. Her large, doe-like eyes had the same scathing heat as hellfire. 

Even with the way she'd gone out of her way to upset me, I didn't immediately resort to violence. It was difficult, with how much Not Deirdre sounded as if she was suffering, but I managed to remind myself that both people and Neighbors are capable of doing terrible things when they're in pain. The Wood Maiden is no different. 

At the very least, I had to try. 

Holding the honey out, I attempted to reason with her. “Hey, *hey*, I didn't come here to fight you. I know you and your home have been hurt, and all I want to do is try to make things as right as I can.”

The Wood Maiden suddenly clenched her fist. A *crack* ricocheted off of the trees, as loud as a gunshot. Not Deirdre's neck was bent the wrong way, her mouth held open in shock, gray eyes vacant and glimmering with unshed tears. 

Even though it wasn't real, my heart shattered as devastatingly as it would have if I'd truly watched Deirdre die like that. The imitation was too close. Too convincing. 

*It wasn't her. She's back at the office. She's safe. It wasn't* **her.**

“I'd know that blade anywhere,” The Wood Maiden said apathetically as I shook, chest quaking with sobs I refused to release as I forced myself to look away from the vision of my dead beloved. “And I saw you with the Huntsman before. I imagine he sent you here on his behalf.”

Struggling to collect myself, I tried to keep my voice even as I explained, “I'm not in the service of the Wild Hunt. Not willingly, anyway. This sword is the product of a deal I was forced into by that Huntsman you saw. And I'm not here because of him.”

“Then why *are* you here?” Her expression hardened with contempt. 

Wiping another rogue tear away, I answered, “The Hunger Grass and the abductions. We’ve successfully stopped the destruction. They won't bother you any more. All that any of us want is to find a solution. A real one.”

The Wood Maiden appeared unmoved, raising her hand again, “For what? To have only borrowed time before I have to watch more of my home be reduced to splinters? To wait until my blood is next to moisten the soil?”

Her shadow changed as her fingers moved, separating into five points. There were footsteps all around me, now. Slow. Stiff. 

“It will happen again.” She remarked bitterly. “It always does. And I'm tired of it.”

I dashed towards her, holding the sword up with the intention of slashing at her raised arm. 

However, whatever she was controlling began to shuffle fast enough to match my speed. There was a strange smell permeating the air. Something metallic, yet earthy. 

My assailant turned out to be what was left of one of the abducted men. His clothes were shredded. The skin covering his torso had been clawed to ribbons, exposing his still-beating heart. Once he drew nearer, I could see that what appeared to be fluffy, yellow-green moss was growing in the muscle, pulsating with each beat. Even more of that peculiar moss grew in thick patches along his forehead and the tip of his nose. His tongue, swollen and gray, hung limply from his bloated blue lips, flopping around as he rushed towards the Wood Maiden. 

Rather than being as concerned for myself as I probably should have been, my first worry was that he was still aware. Trapped inside himself as she piloted his body. 

I diverted my attack at the last moment as he got between us, using his own flesh to shield her. Others were moving closer as she began to retreat further into the forest. Now, I could see the tip of a tail peeking out from the bottom of her long skirt, resembling a donkey’s, complete with a little patch of coarse hair on the tip. The back of her dress had a peculiar bagginess to it as well. Patches of moss poked out of it, tracing her spine. 

The first of the entranced dead men lunged for me. I stepped around him, following her in pursuit. Quickly, I realized that catching up to the Wood Maiden was a lost cause. She moved with inhuman speed and grace through the woods; I imagine only someone like Wes or one of the Hunters would've been better equipped to keep pace with her. 

The landscape is a part of her, and her a part of it. She was essentially navigating an extension of herself, while I was just an extremely unwelcome trespasser bumbling through. 

As she sped further and further away, I heard the dead men under her control struggle to follow me. If I couldn’t free them by subduing her, maybe there was some other way. 

*Would stopping their hearts be enough to put them at rest?*

The first one to reach me was completely unrecognizable. Moss covered his mouth like a gag, trailing out of his empty eye sockets like he was mourning for himself. There wasn’t much left of his right hand, like most of his fingers had been bitten off. Identical to the other man I saw earlier, his heart was exposed and gradually being overtaken by that accursed moss.

Later, I learned that *this* was the chairperson. It was in the news; they’d needed to use his dental records to identify him.

I thrust the sword towards his heart, feeling the blade glide with sickening ease into the muscle. Instantly, he dropped to the ground, the strings the Wooden Maiden was pulling to control him abruptly cut. The silhouette connecting him to her also dissolved, assuring me that I'd done the right thing. 

*One down, four more to go.* 

With a terrible pit in my stomach, I shoved the next one to approach away with a whispered apology. I recognized one of my pursuers as a former client of ours. 

Remember the [first Housekeeper case](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/ka1KkuY0gS) that I told yinz about? Feels like forever ago, doesn’t it? He was the one that got shitty at us for not also doubling as a maid service. Yeah. *Him.* He’d definitely been a prick, but even he didn’t deserve this. 

Once I withdrew the sword from the chairperson’s chest, our former client was the next one that I released. Similarly, he crumpled to the ground, limp as a ragdoll. 

The Wood Maiden’s remaining moss-meat puppets continued to converge on me. Ratcatcher wasn’t designed for clean stabbing; its leaf-shaped serrated blade was better suited for slashing. As such, it was difficult to remove the sword with any amount of grace, needing to occasionally push or kick the dead men away during the hasty process. 

While the moss men weren’t agile, they were unexpectedly strong. I discovered that the hard way when one of them seized my left arm by the bicep, instantly cutting off my circulation. Clenching my teeth as I felt the muscles forcibly shift beneath his hold, convinced that my bones were twisting in his clutch, I brought the blade down on his wrist.  

The marks are still on my arm, and the muscle is undoubtedly bruised. Moving it doesn’t feel good, to say the least. 

The skin of the dead man’s wrist split in a crimson waterfall, unveiling that pincushion moss was growing beneath his skin as well. He didn’t seem to feel the deep cut, reaching for me as his hand dangled from his arm by a thread. Needing to get some distance, I ducked beneath another of the moss men’s outstretched arms, then thrust Ratcatcher at the third. He fell to the ground, no longer moving. 

One of the remaining moss men attempted to grab me. By some miracle, I managed to pull the sword from the other’s heart in time to pierce his. The problem came when he fell on top of me, the weight of his rotting bloated body knocking the wind from me. The stench choked me. Grunting, I struggled to get him off of me. 

The weight increased as the final moss man crawled on top of us both. *Shit!*

A strangled noise escaped my clenched teeth as I tried to free my aching arm enough to push the advancing dead man away. I couldn’t get it free. His gray fingers continued to inch closer.

A flash of white. I could breathe again. Then there was growling, followed by the nauseating and the now far-too-familiar sound of flesh tearing. 

After taking in a desperate breath, I rolled the heavy corpse off of me, discovering that his blood stained my shirt. The liquid froze me to the marrow. 

A gloved hand appeared in my face. I didn’t look up, knowing better than to meet the Houndmaster’s gaze, but accepted her help up. Getting to my feet was painful. My ribs ached. They still do.

“I thought I was screwed.” I admitted to the Houndmaster by way of thanking her.

Meanwhile, my heart was racing as I became acutely aware of how little I knew about her compared to the other two. Would she try to indebt me as Iolo had? And what would be her price?

“You were.” She told me bluntly.

Unlike the mechanic, she didn't appear to be bothered by the cold. Of course, it wasn't often that I saw her bothered by anything. 

A snort caught my attention. For the first time, I saw what her ‘hound’ looked like without the veil to conceal its true appearance. 

The upper half of its face was humanoid, the jaws lined by rows of sharp, crooked teeth. Its arms and legs had been broken and reformed, the hind ones featuring knees turned backwards so that they bent in a way that resembled a typical dog’s. In the meantime, it absentmindedly scratched at its red ear with one of those misshapen limbs, unintentionally disturbing the bandana tied around its neck.

She noticed me gawking at the mangled thing as it happily wagged the lump of white flesh that served as its tail, saying with a sigh, “I’ve never made a hound against their will. They choose this. That one, in particular, was quite enthusiastic.”

I thought back to how the mechanic had used tricky language to coerce the man who’d helped him break into Reyna’s apartment into becoming a crow. 

“Did they know what they were getting into?” I dared to question. 

She calmly asked in return, “Do you recall what I said to you in the library? Back when you were seeking the captain’s true name?” 

*‘If you give your soul to me willingly, I'll be kinder. Kinder than anyone else.’*

As the reality of that old offer dawned on me, I confirmed that I did.

“You were fortunate to not only leave the temple with your life, but to find someone who was willing to risk everything to translate that ledger,” She continued. “If just *one* of those strokes of good fortune had not aligned for you, where do you think you would be right now?”

She wasn’t wrong about that. If Deirdre hadn’t been willing to read the ledger. If I hadn’t had the support of my colleagues. If the mechanic hadn’t had the arrogance to give me that hint. So many ‘ifs’ that could’ve led to me not being here right now.

I admitted, “I imagine I would’ve joined the ones in the trees.”

As the Houndmaster watched the transformed soul sniff around the forest floor, tracking a scent, she elaborated, “If you were faced with having your soul unraveled thread by thread, and I made my offer to you again, what would you have chosen?”

Silently, I allowed myself a brief, uneasy moment to deliberate on it. The soul, despite its dehumanization and servitude, seemed content. But was that a forced contentment that was a part of the transformation, or did it come from a place of genuine satisfaction? Was it *truly* happy to be this way? How much of their own will do they retain?

I don’t believe that the Houndmaster informed me of this out of any malicious intent. Maybe I'm being too trusting, but I think that her offer back at the church had been her idea of mercy. And under worse circumstances, I may have accepted it. 

“Is it safe to assume that at least some of your…” Now that I could really see them, it felt insulting to refer to them as dogs. However, it made phrasing the question difficult. “Were some of *them* in the same position as I was in?”

“No.” She answered simply. “They merely wanted a purpose beyond death. And in turn, I gave it to them, provided that they were what I was looking for. And for the record, you would’ve made an excellent hound.”

That is, to date, the worst compliment I’ve ever received. 

Attempting to joke (poorly), I said, “I have been known to be pretty stubborn and resistant to change. Just ask my girlfriend. Her pet name for me is ‘mule.’”

Her steely gaze drifted towards me. Naturally, I avoided it. “You might consider that the captain has changed you. You did continue your swordsmanship willingly, after all. We are experts at transformation, especially in those most resistant to it.”

At first, I wanted to defend myself, but as I measured her even expression and the relaxedness of her posture, it appeared that she didn’t point this out to be cruel. It was simply an observation. Or possibly even a warning. 

*Is* he changing me? I may use his sword and the techniques, but my heart and intentions haven’t been altered. At least, I don’t think they have. But if the vicissitude was subtle, becoming more pronounced over time, would I even notice? 

Suffice to say, I’m paranoid now. Have any of yinz noticed anything different about me? The way I interact with you? The way I recount the events of my career? 

Maybe I’m thinking too much about it. It’s entirely possible that the Houndmaster had said this simply to get into my head. At the end of the day, she *is* a Hunter. But she hasn’t tried anything of the sort before; headgames seem to be more Iolo’s thing. 

Perhaps I should distance myself more from him. I think I’m getting too comfortable. 

Before we parted ways, she said, “When it comes to repaying me, I do need a favor.”

*Here we go.*

Uneasy, I prepared for the worst. “What is it?”

“I just bought a house and the seller failed to mention a rat infestation.” She explained as she briefly checked her watch. “I have the day off tomorrow. Afternoon would be best. It'll give me some time to wake up.”

Oh. That was it? 

In disbelief, I told her, “Yeah, I can come by tomorrow.”

She gave me her address. Just outside of town. After that, she called her ‘hound’ and was off. 

It can't be that simple. Can it? Guess I'll find out.

But back to the more pressing issue: the Wood Maiden. It's clear that she has no intentions of stopping her vendetta. As far as she's concerned, it's not just the development company responsible for assaulting her home - it's all of us. We'll need to find some way to subdue her, and quickly. 

Victor is working on it, even contacting his friends back in Ohio to see if they've had anything similar come up. I'll keep yinz updated as best as I [can.](https://www.reddit.com/r/atypicalpests/s/SO6b77lmMD) 

Edit: [Guess what? The rats weren't normal. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/msxmN3bLwD)
