On the evening of a rainy day in 2020, I found myself sitting next to my grandfather, whose aged gaze seemed to penetrate a world much older than ours. The ticking of the clock marked the passage of time, and I knew my grandfather's days were numbered. With a sigh, he looked at me and began to narrate his story, one that had remained in the dark for decades.

"It was the year 1950, a dark time when the war still left its mark on Europe, and dictatorship weighed heavy on Spain. I was only 20 years old and lived in a small village surrounded by tense calm and dense forests."

"Back then, I worked as a carpenter, carving wood in a humble workshop. But, son, what I'm about to tell you is not just a tale, but a confession of what really happened."

Grandfather looked at his wrinkled hands, three fingers were missing from his right hand, a mark from his past that had always piqued my curiosity.

Grandfather always said he lost his three fingers in an accident with the woodcutter.

His scars exuded violence.

"I didn't lose these fingers in a simple accident, as I've always told you. It was a cursed night when I was alone in the workshop. A dark shadow emerged from the darkness, a presence that froze my blood. In the blink of an eye, a cold and sharp claw seized my hand."

His words left me breathless as he continued the story.

"A whispering voice, laden with sinister promises and a scent of sulfur, offered me a deal: wealth and power in exchange for my fingers."

"I accepted without thinking of the consequences."

"The sensation of a cold knife cutting off my fingers still haunts me in my nightmares."

"The hand stained with blood."

"My severed fingers."

"And that demonic presence disappeared into the darkness. Emitting sinister screams that sounded like joy."

I couldn't forget those screams, he told me. It was what frightened him the most.

"At first, the wealth came as they promised, but so did the darkness. Nights became endless, filled with lamentations and terrifying visions."

"Though I lived a good life, the lost fingers became a cursed mark."

"A reminder of my sin."

Grandfather concluded his tale with a sigh, and in his eyes gleamed deep remorse. As the story settled in my mind, I understood that the line between the mundane and the supernatural was thinner than I had ever imagined.

The eerie atmosphere of his story enveloped me, and I felt a shiver run down my spine, as if the words themselves were an echo of the demonic presence he had faced for decades.

Both of us knew that hell awaited.

He had known it for over 60 years.

Grandfather ended his days living like a vagabond.

Stripped of all luxury and comfort.

He believed that by abandoning that life of excess, he would somehow find redemption.

A thought worthy of a madman, I thought, pitying him. Knowing that he would hear the devil's screams for all eternity.
