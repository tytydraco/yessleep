I sat behind my bedroom door, listening in on the conversation happening in the living room.

“Maybe you can take a look around you and realize that you’re abandoning your own child, you stupid bitch!”

“Oh and you’re much better when you go around fucking your mistresses and secretaries?”

“OH MY GOD!!! Here we go again with your bullshit!”

My mom and dad were at it again like usual. I always knew what they were yelling about because the walls of our home were so thin. Somedays, I was even convinced that they both enjoyed screaming at each other since they did it so often, but of course, how would I ever know. All I could do was sit behind that bedroom door and wait for it to end, which it usually did with my dad going out to cheat and my mom drinking half a handle and passing out on the couch. The next morning, I would have to wake myself up, sneak money from her purse for lunch, and catch the school bus alone. After school, I would always stay as long as possible to catch the last bus out of here. My parents didn’t really care that I came home so late. Some days, they wouldn’t even notice I was back home until the next morning. Rinse and repeat for all my life. 

I’ve never been the confrontational kind. I would always keep my head down, making sure not to talk to the people around me. I was the shy kid, and because of that, I never became friends with the other kids in my class. Instead, I would spend my time watching videos on the Ipad my uncle got me for my birthday.

I was fascinated with Youtube and the internet culture. I would always surf websites like Reddit or NewGrounds, finding new content and personalities to watch and engross myself into. The older I got, the more and more I got into horror stories and creepypastas, but I had read and watched everything that was out at the time. After all, the creepypasta community was niche, so I would end up starving for more content at the end of the day. All of that changed when that video came into my life. 

One day, during lunch hours, I was eating my lunch in the cafeteria like usual when I noticed a huge crowd of kids circling around one table. I didn’t want to approach at first, but something in my body made me instinctively move towards them. As I got closer, I could hear their conversations more clearly. They were all cheering on and goading the kid at the table to do something, although I wasn’t sure yet. I tried to get closer to the kid, but there were too many people in my way. So, I mustered up my courage, and asked one of the kids what was going on.

“Oh you don’t know? It’s this new challenge going around. Apparently, some guy posted a video that is 120 hours long and people are trying to see how long they can watch it for.”

As some of the crowd cleared out, I could finally see the kid sitting at the table by himself. He was on his phone watching the video, although I couldn’t see what it was. Everyone stared at him intensely, joking and teasing him like typical high schoolers. After a couple of minutes, the kid at the table turned his phone off and looked up at everyone.

“Man this is boring as hell!” 

The entire cafeteria went into an uproar, insulting and laughing at the kid for not making it very far. Before anything else could happen, security came to get us back to class. 

Back home, all I could think about was that challenge. I needed to know more about it. It was like there was an itch in the back of my head that would never be scratched unless I found it. I looked it up at first, and all I could see was people recording their reactions to the challenge and whatnot. I tried to look up the origin of it, but couldn't find anything.  I scrolled for hours, searching for it on different forums. Did that kid at school lie to me? Did it never actually exist? All I knew was that I had to find it. Finally, after scrolling endlessly into the late night, I found it.

It was called the IZO challenge. It was the number 120 written with letters, kind of like how you would spell “Boobs” on a calculator, but the opposite. I started by reading how the challenge came about, which was thankfully brief. A couple of months ago, an unknown email account was going around sharing the video to random people online with the subject “Grace”. When the email got in the hands of one of the creepypasta moderators, they uploaded it to Youtube but went missing a couple of days later. That’s when the challenge and stories came about. Already, this was gearing up to look good, so I kept reading. Next were the rules, which thankfully, there were only 5. 

“1. DO NOT SCRUB/STOP THE VIDEO AT ANY POINT!! A witness is meant to experience from START TO END. 

2. DO NOT MUTE THE AUDIO FOR ANY REASON. A witness is meant to see and hear.

3. This video is meant to be viewed ALONE. No other witnesses should be present.

4. Please keep your mind empty while watching. An empty mind is an open mind.

5. If you do not follow any of the listed rules, then your attempt at the challenge will be deemed NULL AND VOID.”

I could tell from the start that this wasn’t made by an amateur. The rules were odd, but honestly, everything in the creepypasta forums is odd in some way or another so I figured this was just part of the game. Finally, all my sleuthing for a new horror story had landed me into the jackpot. I was properly hooked. Unfortunately, it was getting late, so I went to bed eager for the next day.

When I got back home to the smells of burnt food and stale beer, I got to action. I brought out my Ipad, got a snack, and searched for the video. I couldn’t contain my excitement as I finally pulled up the link. 

The video was titled “Grace.mp4”. 120 hours, 7 minutes, and 33 seconds. The only words in the description were “for death, desire, and the self.” I was ready. Before I could hear the booming sounds of my parents arguing yet again, I put on my headphones and started the video.

At first, the screen was black, but after a couple of seconds, the first frame of a cartoon appeared. It was from an old episode of Pepe Le Pew, but instead of playing normally, it was stretched for so long that it was only able to play frame by frame. The audio had gone through the same treatment, so it was more like a jumbled cacophony of sounds being coerced into my mind at every frame. It made me uneasy even though it shouldn’t have, but I figured it was because I was alone so I didn't feel too bad about it. After watching a little more than 10 minutes, I started growing annoyed with the video since it wasn’t really scary. So just like everyone else at my school, I shut it down and went to bed thoroughly disappointed.

I had half given up on the challenge and went back to my old schtick instead. I got home, locked myself in my room, and watched Youtube. As I was watching, I accidentally let the auto-play roll. I picked up my tablet to stop it, but what I saw took me completely by surprise. It was Grace.mp4.

I felt a coldness run from the base of my spine all the way up to my nape. I immediately shut it down and clicked on another video. That gave me an error. I was used to that happening with Youtube, so I went back to the home page and refreshed it. It was the same old front page I was used to seeing everyday, but for some reason, every single video I clicked on gave me an error. I refreshed the app this time, and when I opened it, my heart dropped. The first row of videos was gone, except for one. It was Grace.mp4 again. I was scared, but my brain quickly clicked and figured this was part of the challenge, so I got excited. I clicked the video once again and this time, my goal was to make it further than 10 minutes. 

It started with the cartoon again, still going frame by frame. Even though the audio was piercing and the images were stale, I persisted. 

2 hours in. The cartoon finally changed. I was now watching an episode with Foghorn Leghorn in it. It still played it frame by frame and the audio was still shrill, but I could recognize the old classic “Boy! I say boy!” even through the heavy distortion. As I kept watching, something caught my eye. Although I couldn’t confirm it, I swore the frames for this cartoon were shorter than the last one. I figured it was probably because this episode was longer, so I didn’t think too much of it and kept going. 

4 hours in. I hadn’t noticed it but it was dark outside now. Despite that, I pushed through. For these two hours, I got to watch a very old episode of Daffy Duck in WW2, which was interesting to see even frame by frame. Once again, I would have sworn the frames were shorter and that the audio was starting to clear up too. I could feel shivers creeping down my arms to my fingertips. What was going on? Was the video speeding up without me knowing? Despite my nerves, I stayed planted in my bed with my eyes fixed on the video. 

6 hours in. I was growing increasingly tired. My eyes wavered as I looked at my screen. My body swayed from sheer exhaustion. I was feeling myself ready to crash, but I pinched myself and stayed up looking at the video.  I wasn’t even paying attention to the cartoon, I was simply watching with an empty mind. As I kept watching, the frames were faster again. Now, it resembled more like I was watching stop motion than anything else. The audio was clear and I could make out what the voices were saying. Despite all that, when the cartoon ended, it still showed that 2 hours had lapsed.

8 hours in. I don’t know if I was awake or if I was dreaming. Everything in my peripherals went black. Not like night black, but total darkness. Everything was gone. I couldn't even muster any fear in my body from how tired I was. All I could feel was my body tensing up, not wanting to be awake anymore. Alas, all I could do was sit there and watch the video. I don’t even remember what cartoon was playing, all I knew was that I had to keep watching. My brain hadn’t even noticed it, but the video was fully fluid now. No frames played or anything, just the fluid video and audio.

When the cartoon finished, the video was black again. I could see the reflection of my tired face peering back to me in that black mirror, but that wasn’t all. I shifted my eyes slowly towards the corner of the screen, and then, my entire body froze. There was a man behind me. I couldn’t see his face. All I could tell was that he looked way too tall to be a normal person. He didn’t move an inch, like a statue. Then, in the silence of my room, I heard him speak with the sweetest voice I had ever heard. 

“You’re doing great Andrew.”

I violently woke up, gasping for air. I looked around the room in a panic searching for the man. No one was there. Just me and the peaceful chirping of the birds outside. I couldn’t be more relieved. Now that I was a little more relaxed, I looked out my window. It was a bright sunny day today. I looked at the alarm clock. 11:35 am. I freaked out for a second, but then I remembered it was Saturday, so I was fine. I looked down at my bed and saw the Ipad on my lap, headphones still connected. I turned it on. Youtube was still open. Curious, I checked the history, but the video was gone. Actually my entire history was gone, like I’ve never watched Youtube before. My fingers suddenly felt cold again and my forehead was starting to sweat. I needed fresh air. I got out of bed, got dressed, grabbed my bike, and left making sure not to wake my drunk mom on the couch. 

I wanted to go play outside but I had no real friends. That fact always came to bite me in the butt, but it was my fault so I just rolled with it. In the end, I just decided to go to the library. 

As I rode my bike, I thought about last night. The figure, the video, my fear of it all. I didn’t know what to believe. Was I really scared of something, or did I make myself believe I was scared of something? As I pondered, something had come back into my memory. I remembered how I felt reading my first ever creepypasta. The fear I felt then made me not want to leave my room for a week, and that story was not plausible at all. I figured I was completely exaggerating and that what happened last night was nothing more than a dream. A figment of my own imagination. That made me feel better, and before I knew it, I was smiling again as I arrived at the library. 

I tried to look up more about the challenge and the video itself, but the only available information was from the thread talking about the challenge. I knew if I wanted to learn more, I would have to dig deeper. I tried going to sub-forums and other threads to see if anybody was still talking about the challenge. I even typed messages to different accounts that interacted with the thread to see what they knew, but nobody answered. I figured everybody had moved on to another challenge or got bored with this one just like with everything on the internet, so I didn’t press further. I was ready to leave back home when I noticed a ping notification coming from my account on the computer. I sat back down and checked who had messaged me. 

It was from some account called “r0man61214”. Before reading the message, I had to check who this “Roman” person was. Their account was created around 2 years ago and they weren’t very active on the forum. They only had a handful of comments and remarks on threads, but as I kept scrolling, I had hit the jackpot. Turns out Roman was the creator of the IZO Challenge thread. I quickly went back to the message and read it.

“Are you the one asking about the video?”

I quickly replied.

“Yeah. Are you the one that made it?”

I leaned in closer to the monitor waiting for his reply. It came only a couple of seconds later.

“No.”

“Then who did?”

“I don’t know.”

I was getting frustrated with the brevity in his answers.

“I need to know more. Where did this video come from?”

“It came from upstairs.”

“What does that mean?”

He didn’t answer that. I tried asking another question.

“What happens if you finish the video?”

He didn’t answer that either.

“What is this video for?”

There was another pause before his answer came in.

“Salvation. The video is for salvation.”

I was confused, was this part of the game? And even if it was, why was I feeling tense about it? I typed once again, despite my fingers starting to shake.

“What? What about salvation?”

The man didn’t answer. I sat there on the edge of the chair waiting desperately for a response. The sounds of the library had drowned out as I stared intently at the conversation on screen. Something was off about the interaction. I couldn’t confirm it, but I was starting to think that this Roman guy wasn’t real. It felt like I was either getting pranked by some kid on the forum, or…well I don’t know. I wanted to be sure, so I shot my shot.

“Who are you?”

The conversation fell silent once more. As I sat fixated on that screen for a couple of minutes, the familiar “r0man61214 is typing…” text appeared. When the message finally came on screen, all the color drained from my face.

“I think you should just finish watching the video Andrew.”

I fell out of my chair. The librarian lady came to see if I was okay, but I panicked and slapped her hands out of the way. I bolted out of the library all the way home without turning back a single time. I was gone so fast I even left my bike back there.

At this point, this wasn’t a game or challenge. The guy knew my name. My fucking name. How the hell did he know that? I tried my hardest not to have a panic attack. I gripped my chest, I tried to control my breathing, but nothing could stop the shivers I was feeling in my entire body. For the first time in my life, I was properly scared, but this time, it wasn’t fun at all.

When I got home, the first thing I did was hide my Ipad away in a place where I couldn’t get to it easily. I tried everything in my power to not think about it. I couldn’t think about this challenge anymore. I don’t know how, but I knew that if I kept thinking about it, if I kept getting involved, something bad would definitely happen. So I recollected myself and put all my mental power into getting the challenge out of my mind. Finally after a couple stressful days, I had forgotten about it.

For the next week, I was back in my normal groove. I woke up, took money for lunch, and went to school. Something about going back to that routine made me feel sane. It wasn’t the best life by any means, but it was a life I was used to, so I was grateful to be back. At school, everything was the same. Went to lunch, took a math exam, and I even had the courage to talk to some of my classmates and make friends. Life was gearing back up for me, and I was proud of myself.

Although everything seemed perfect, I couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something wrong. I could have sworn that the day was going by faster, like someone hit the fast forward button a single time on the remote. My classes, which were usually an hour long, felt more like 40 minutes. Even the people I talked to at lunch seemed faster than usual. I knew something was off, but also knew I wasn’t going to confront it, so I just ignored it and went on with my life. At least I thought I was.

One day when I came back home from school, I was finishing up my homework like usual when I felt I deserved a break. The first thing that popped into mind was to watch Youtube and relax before going to bed.

Without thinking, I grabbed my Ipad out from my closet and set it on my bed. It was dead at this point, so I put it to charge. After 30 minutes, it came back on again. I picked it up and put the password in like I always did. When it came on, my fingers went cold and I dropped the tablet. The Ipad had Youtube already opened up with a video ready to watch. It was Grace.mp4.

My fight or flight response immediately kicked in as I tried to close Youtube out. It didn’t budge. I tried restarting Youtube, the Ipad, everything, but no matter what I did, I always ended up back on that video. It was haunting me. Why was it following me? Why me? What did I do to deserve this? I picked up the tablet and collected my thoughts.  It already knew my name, and now, the video was haunting me. I tried to think of every different outcome, but the fear had crept over my entire body. So, I did the only thing that seemed logical to me at the time: I got into bed, put my headphones in, and I watched the video.  

It started with the cartoons again. The progression was the same. The first one was frame-y and the last one played smoothly. Once again, I could tell that the outside had gone dark. As I kept myself awake through the slog, I looked into the black mirror sitting in my hands. The figure was back. I still couldn't see his face or expression. Just his tall, unmoving figure standing there like a bad omen. No matter how much I looked at the tablet, I could feel his piercing gaze on my neck sending a wave of fear throughout the nerves in my body. Despite that I kept watching.

After the cartoons, the screen went black again. By this time, I found myself hitting that sweet spot when you’ve kept yourself awake for long enough that your body doesn’t want to go to sleep anymore and you’re able to stay awake for a lot longer. I felt relieved knowing I wouldn’t have to fight myself to stay awake anymore, but I quickly snapped out of it as my eyes glazed back to the still figure still lurking. 

Finally, the video was back. It was an old broadcast showing a man in front of a crowd of children with a camera next to him.

“...and this part tells you the frame rate of the video. Now, we learned that frame rate tells us how many pictures the camera takes in a second in order to capture movement, but watch when I do this.”

He fiddles with a couple of settings on the camera, and just like magic, the video gets slower and faster. All the kids wow before the man can speak again.

“If you change how many pictures the camera can take in one second, then you can give the video the illusion of slowing down or speeding up.”

The video hard-cuts to another clip, this time of a doctor.

“...but some scientists believe that you are able to shift the patient eye’s frame rate beyond the 30 to 60 frames per second. This would allow them to see motion not visible from the naked eye, although their perspective of the world would seem short as all other motion would look too slow to them. Now the same can be said for the opposite…”

The video cuts abruptly and goes back to black once again. Although I was listening to what was being said, I couldn’t take my eyes off of the figure. He was still standing there, although it was getting harder and harder to see him as the light from outside faded. He remained unfazed, still peeping at me from behind. I wanted to look back at him. I wanted to see who was in the room with me. I wanted to run. I wanted to see my parents again. I wanted to go anywhere but here, yet I stayed planted in that bed, paralyzed by the fear I once sought after. I had no other choice but to keep watching. Finally, the video changed again.

Before an image appeared, there was text. It simply read “For Death”. Then, it cut to a large empty white room. The tone of the room was loud from how quiet it was. Then, the faint sounds of rustling came on. From the left side of the frame came a baby. It started off crawling from left to right, and before I knew it, the baby was walking. As the baby kept walking to the right, you could see it was slowly aging, like one of those biology book diagrams. Once the baby became a kid, something about him was familiar. Before I knew it, the boy became a teenager and  it clicked. The kid in the video was me. That was me as a baby, me as a toddler, and now I was becoming a teenager. 

“What the fuck?!” I whispered to myself in a panic.

I started hyperventilating while watching myself walk across the room, the camera panning with him. The video couldn’t be real, so how the hell were they able to get such an accurate depiction of me? I couldn’t do this anymore. The coldness in my fingertips, the anxiousness in my breath, the figure still lurking behind me, it was all too much, and just like at the library, I panicked. I immediately shot up out of bed to make a run for it, but before I could do anything, the figure finally moved.

He made his way to me and placed his hands on my shoulders. Although I knew he was tall, I could now feel how gigantic his hands truly were on me. They must have been a foot long, evident from how his fingers nearly reached under my breast. They were the softest hands I had ever felt, like that of a woman. My mind was screaming at me to keep running, to get away, to do anything but stay put. Despite that, I stayed locked in place. Then, the figure tightened his grip on my shoulders and forcefully yanked me back onto the bed.

“How about we finish what we started this time.”

There it was again. That soft, angelic voice spewing malice and devilishness as his hands squeezed tight enough to leave a bruise. Without an ounce of retaliation, I picked up my tablet and nodded. He let go of me, and I started watching again.

It got to my current age and it showed me as I am now. Same clothes, same haircut, same everything. I felt my heart rush once again, but I needed to push through, so I did my best to keep it down. 

Next was me as a young adult, then a full grown man, and before I knew it, I reached old age. I was terrified, but there was something about seeing myself as an adult that was weirdly calming. I can’t explain it, I just felt at ease seeing myself grow older. Of course, that didn’t last too long. I thought he would stop growing once he was old, but he didn’t.

Suddenly, his hips gave out and he fell to the ground hard. I instinctively flinched at the fall, like I could feel the pain too. He tried his hardest to get up, but he was old and frail, so he kept failing. He did this for several minutes, heaving and gasping for breath all while still pushing forward to the right of the screen. It was sad to watch me struggle there trying to move forward as my body was failing me. It made me feel disgusted and awkward. I wanted to help myself, but I couldn’t, so I watched. At some point, the old me stopped trying to get up and instead crawled towards the right. His movements were short and weak, barely making it a couple of inches as he desperately writhed using the last of his strength. Then, he died.

A tear ran down my face as I watched myself take my last breath. It’s weird, even though I watched myself die, I felt…relieved, like the worst part was over and I was able to relax again. I was ready for the video to cut to the next part, but it didn’t.

After a couple of seconds dead on the ground, liquids of all colors started coming out from under old-me. Then came the bugs. They started out as one or two small insects, but it quickly turned into hundreds of thousands of bugs and critters coming from outside and inside the body to feast. By this time, the old man was unrecognizable. All I could see on the ground was his leather-like orange skin slowly leaking and getting eaten by the nature it once came from. Then, all the skin started to sag as they kept devouring the insides of my helpless corpse. Finally when the bugs were done, the screen cut to black again.

I was sick. I couldn’t get the images of that old man’s carcass getting slowly devoured like that out of my head. Without getting up, I put my head over the side of the bed and vomited what I ate that day. I got back to my sitting position and I could feel my body failing me once again. The figure knew that too.

As my eyes started shutting, I was startled when I felt his soft hand on my back once again. He slowly ran his index finger up my spine, each of my joints going cold as his finger passed them. When he reached my neck, he clasped his hand around it and clamped down. I audibly exclaimed in pain, but I was for sure fully awake now. I shifted my eyes back to the tablet and through it, I saw the figure let go of me and go back to his original position. I kept watching with tears in my eyes as the video started back up again.

There was text again, and this one said “For Desire”. It then cut to a shot of a modest but dirty bedroom. It had two beds separated and the dressers and cabinets were littered with ashtrays and half drunk bottles of Jim Beam. I knew that bedroom anywhere if I saw it. It’s my parent’s bedroom. I panicked for a second thinking the figure might have gotten to them, but as I looked closer, I could see them calmly resting in their beds. This was the first time in my entire life where I saw both my parents at peace. It was nice seeing them not scream at each other for once. I gave a faint smile through the tears. Then, my brain perked up. I checked the reflection in the corner of the screen and lo and behold, the figure was gone. I gave a big sigh of relief.

“Finally..” I told myself solemnly.

At the same time as I said that, I saw something in the video. Somebody walked into my parents bedroom. It was the figure. I got up out of the bed, ready to run to help my parents, but the fear was too deeply instilled, so I defeatedly sat back down in the bed and watched what unfolded with teary eyes. 

The figure walked into the room without opening the door. It opened for him. He walked over to each of the beds and whispered something in each of their ears before standing in the corner away from view.

First, my father got up. I could hear him get up from my bedroom. He switched on the lights and went over to my mom to wake her up. She gets out of bed and they both stand at the foot of it, staring at each other. They kiss, and after that, they start dancing. I could hear my dad’s clumsy steps and my mother’s laugh through the wall. More tears ran down my face, but this time, they were of happiness. I couldn’t believe my eyes as I watched my parents be a loving couple for the first time in my life. It was heartwarming, but it wasn’t long lived.

Quickly, they stopped dancing and started arguing again. I could hear their screams through the wall, but I didn’t dare stray from my bedroom, so I kept watching. Their screams escalated as they got louder and louder with each other.

Finally, my father snapped and he hit my mom, knocking her to the ground. My mother jumped up and hit my father back. Next thing I knew, they were wailing at each other non stop. I could hear the impact of each strike through my headphones and walls, echoing those terrible sounds right into my brain. I sat helplessly as I watched my parents mercilessly attempt to beat each other to death. Sadly, it wasn’t a fair fight and my mother was on the ground, beaten and bruised. That didn’t stop my dad though.

He grabbed one of the many glass bottles from the dresser and made his way back to my mom. He lifted the glass bottle high above her head, and in one fell swoop, he cracked it down on her face. He lifted the shattered bottle and brought it down once more on her mangled face. He did this not once, not twice, but continuously for 15 minutes. I heard it all. Then, he stopped. My mom’s once beautiful face had now resorted to being a mushy red paste as the last of her life seeped out of her body. My dad was covered in blood and before I knew it, he grabbed the same broken bottle he used to kill my mom and did the same to his own face. 

I howled and cried in desperation. Was the same going to happen to me? I begged for forgiveness. I apologized to every god I knew. I cried for my parents. I cried to go home. All sense I had prior was gone as I sat like a helpless coward bawling my eyes out. Then, the figure came back.

I tried to force myself to stop crying, but I couldn’t. The figure gently glided to me, placed his hand on my chin, and lifted my face up to him. At last, I could see his face. He was beautiful. His skin looked so smooth that I could have sworn it was porcelain. His eyes, his nose, and his mouth didn’t move at all, carved in that harrowing half smile resting on his face forever. Then, without a single muscle in his face moving, he spoke.

“We’re almost done Andrew.”

He sat me back down on my bed and handed me my Ipad. I already knew what he meant by that, so I played the video.

It finally cut off the gruesome scene in my parent’s bedroom. It was black again. In the tablet, I could see the figure, but he was a lot closer to me than before. So close I could see his face in the reflection. Then, a white glow emanating from my hands told me the text for the final section appeared. 

The title for this one said “For the Self”. At first, it flashed photos of old Christian Renaissance paintings, specifically the ones with the Virgin Mary surrounded by cherubs. They seemed pretty normal, but I quickly picked up what was wrong with them. All the cherubs in the paintings had my face. My body wanted to be scared, but my mind felt like a giant hole at the beach constantly being dug out. I couldn’t feel anything.

Soon the paintings disappeared and what I saw was a bedroom. My bedroom. I could see myself watching the exact same video on the bed at the same time. I turned my head to where it seemed to be recording me from, but there was nothing there. I looked back at the screen and saw myself turning my head towards the corner, and back to the tablet. I took a deep breath, braced myself, and kept watching. 

Nothing was happening in the room. It was just me on the bed and the figure behind me just out of shot. But then, he moved. I quickly looked back. He was still planted firmly behind me, so I kept watching the video. 

The figure walked up to me on the bed and put my tablet down. I gave him my hand and got up. He hugged me lovingly for an uncomfortable while before a white light opened up above us in my room and we flew up. The video went black again with the final solemn words. 

“Congratulations, you have been saved!” 

Then, the video ended. All 120 hours, 7 minutes, and 33 seconds were done. Just like that, I had done it. I completed the IZO challenge. I dropped my tablet to the ground and started crying. The nightmare was finally going to be over. I looked behind me, and the figure was magically gone. I jumped out of bed elated and screamed at the top of my lungs. I started dancing, I started laughing, I started singing. I did everything that made me feel alive. Then, I looked out the window. It was afternoon already, which made sense in my head since the video was so long, but a couple of minutes later, it was dark. 

“Man the day is going by fast”

I took my clothes off and got changed. When I was done, it was bright again outside. Confused, I made my way to the window and stared at the outside for a bit. My eyes couldn’t believe what I was seeing. Time was fast forwarding outside, and I quickly learned that in one hour, an entire day passed. My heart was beating so fast that it was hurting. I panicked and ran into the living room. That was a mistake. 

Standing in the middle of the room in the same pose, was the figure. He never left, he just wanted me to believe he did. My heart sank into the deepest abyss. I started to lose consciousness and fell to the ground. The figure glided over to me and reached his hand out. I was ready to put my hand out, to reach to the godly figure in front of me, to touch salvation. 

But I didn’t. 

In that last moment, I said what I never thought I would. 

“No, I’m not going with you.”

All at once, all sounds and movements coming from the figure stopped.

He took his hand back and reset himself to his original pose. The house was as quiet as ever. In that silence, my mind knew that it had said the wrong thing. I messed up. I braced myself for what was about to come, but that wasn’t enough. 

In an instant, the figure snapped my way. He grabbed the sides of my head and lifted me off the ground. I was powerless as he made me stare into the black of his marble-carved eyes. His calm half smile broke off from his face and turned to hostility. His mouth opened wide and for the first time, I could hear his real voice.

“Disappointing.”

His face turned to vitriol as I felt his hands slowly squeezing my head. I wanted to beg for mercy, telling it all the apologies and prayers I knew. But that’s exactly what it wanted. So, for the first time in my life, I fought back.

“You can’t take me! You’re nothing! You’re just a demon! Just… go away! Go away! GO AWAY!!!” 

I screamed all the obscenities I knew. It was the last ditch effort I had in me. But the figure didn’t listen. It kept squeezing my head more and more in between its giant grasp. I closed my eyes and stayed strong. I kept shouting and shouting, never stopping. My throat strained from the fervor of my words. The air in my lungs was expelled at every vowel and consonant. I was not going to get taken by this demon. Not today and not anytime ever.

Suddenly, I fell to the ground. I quickly picked myself up and braced myself again, but when I looked up, the figure was gone again. I wasn’t going to fall for this again. I thoroughly checked every room, making sure I didn’t miss anything, but to my surprise, it was truly gone. I was free for real this time. 

I went to my parent’s bedroom to check on them, but they were also gone. It was as if they were never home today. 

I checked the windows next. The clouds and sun outside were stationary again. I went back to the living room and I basked in the silence of my quaint home. I wanted to smile again, but I couldn’t bring myself to it. I had won, but at what cost?

The next few days after this, the police came around to ask about my parents and what had happened. I tried to tell them about the video, the challenge, that my parents died and were taken, but the police kept looking at me with wide eyes the entire time. In the end, they couldn’t find anything pertaining to their death or the haunting, so they concluded that they both abandoned me at home to go live their lives. I knew that wasn’t true, but what could I possibly have said to change their minds? Instead, I kept quiet as tears flowed down my face.

I was escorted to a foster care facility where I lived for 6 years. Got my first apartment a month ago and I’ve been living my life calmly with a steady job and even a girlfriend. I kept seeing therapists even after all these years, mostly mandatory by the facility and state. They would always ask me about the incident and everything that had happened with my parents, but every time, I told them that I had forgotten about it and was simply sad about being abandoned. But that isn’t the truth. 

See, I never gave up on the challenge. I needed to prove its existence, I needed to show the world what had happened, I needed others to believe. And finally, it came to me. 

Yesterday, as I was laid in bed bored with what was on TV, I opened my phone to Youtube. I watched a couple of videos before it started glitching. I refreshed it, and there in front of my eyes, was “Grace.mp4”. 

And this is where we are today. As I sit here writing this out, I wanted you to know: the IZO challenge is real, the figure is real, and demons are real. And I am going to prove it to the world. 

Tonight, I will be watching the video again and coming back with my findings. I will not let this demon roam free. I will fight back. If this is my final message, then just know, I put up a damn good fight.
