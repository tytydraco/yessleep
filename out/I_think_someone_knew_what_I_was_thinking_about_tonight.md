Ryan knew the letter wasn’t meant for a man who planned to see Wednesday.

It waited for him on the mat like it had patience — like it understood timing better than people did. Thick. Cream-coloured. No stamp. No address. Just his name, typed neatly, exactly centred.

He didn’t remember opening the door.

That bothered him more than the letter.

The flat felt wrong in the way a room feels after an argument. Heavy. Charged. The air smelled faintly metallic, like overheated wires or blood you only notice once it dries.

Ryan stood there longer than was reasonable, keys still in his hand, staring at the envelope.

He’d spent most of the night before deciding. Not dramatically. Not crying. Just calmly weighing options like a man choosing between routes on a map. He’d even slept afterwards, which felt like cheating.

He nudged the envelope with his shoe.

It didn’t slide.

He frowned, then bent and picked it up.

The paper was warm.

Not *recently printed* warm. Not *sunlight* warm.

Warm like it had come from a body.

His stomach lurched. He dropped it immediately. The envelope hit the floor and split slightly at the corner, exhaling a dry, papery breath.

“Get it together,” he muttered, though there was no one left to impress.

The flat was silent. No fridge hum. No ticking clock. The kind of silence that presses against your ears until you become aware of your own heartbeat.

Ryan crouched and picked the envelope up again. This time it felt normal. Cold. Lifeless.

Inside was a single sheet of paper.

No letterhead. No logo. Just four words.

**THE FRACTURE HAS OPENED.**

**WE ARE WATCHING.**

Ryan read it once.

Then again.

The words didn’t move, didn’t shimmer, didn’t change. They just sat there, black and absolute.

A laugh escaped him — sharp, humourless. “Of course you are.”

He turned the page over. Blank.

Except… not quite.

At the bottom of the sheet, pressed deep into the paper, was the faint outline of a seal. Circular. Intricate. Old.

He couldn’t explain how he knew that.

His chest tightened anyway.

The symbol tugged at something behind his eyes, like a memory that refused to surface. Not recognition. Familiarity. The way a place feels familiar in a dream even when you’ve never been there.

Ryan shoved the paper back into the envelope and stood too quickly. The room swayed.

He crossed to the kitchen and flicked the kettle on.

Nothing.

He tried the light switch.

Nothing.

The pressure behind his eyes became pain.

“No,” he said, louder now. “No, no, no.”

He checked his phone. No signal. No Wi-Fi. The time read **21:49**.

It had been morning when he came home.

Hadn’t it?

Ryan sank onto the sofa, the envelope clutched in his fist. His gaze drifted to the kitchen drawer. The one he’d emptied last night. The one he’d left open on purpose, like an invitation.

He hadn’t planned for this.

That was the worst part.

The envelope pulsed.

Once.

Twice.

Like a heartbeat that didn’t belong to him.

His phone vibrated.

Ryan flinched so hard it slipped from his hand and landed face-up on the carpet. The screen lit the room in a cold blue wash.

**UNKNOWN SENDER**

A single message.

*We need to talk before you do something irreversible.*

Ryan’s mouth went dry.

No one knew.

Not about the drawer.

Not about the note he’d written and torn up.

Not about the way he’d practised the end in his head until it felt merciful.

His fingers hovered over the screen, shaking.

Another message arrived.

*You’re closer to the edge than you think.*

The lights snapped on.

All of them.

At once.

Ryan froze.

The television screen reflected the room back at him — the sofa, the open drawer, the envelope on the floor.

And behind him, standing far too close, was a figure he hadn’t heard enter.

Tall. Still. Featureless where a face should have been, as if reality had forgotten to finish drawing it.

Ryan didn’t turn around.

He couldn’t.

His phone buzzed again.

*If you turn around now, the fracture completes.*

The envelope slid across the floor by itself.

And stopped at his feet.
