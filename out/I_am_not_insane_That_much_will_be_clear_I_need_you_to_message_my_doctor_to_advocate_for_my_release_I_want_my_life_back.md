I am forced to post this because of the flat refusal of my doctor to accept my version of events. The *truth*. I believe you will read this, understand I am logical, rational, sane, and surely support my release. It might only take a few minutes of your time, but it would mean I would get my life back. Please message the hospital at the e-mail I've left at the end.

It all began when I awoke to find before me in the bathroom mirror a face that was not my own. The features were grotesque: jaundiced skin stretched tight, a narrow nose heavily marked by pox. The worst of it was the lips, contorted into a taunting smile exposing the teeth below. *My* teeth.

Perhaps this was dementia or delirium, my lack of recognition the symptom of a diseased brain, rather than a hostile intrusion by this smirking usurper. I left the bathroom, found my wallet, and pulled out my driving licence, hoping the face photographed would be the one I saw in the mirror.

It was not. It was *my* face, the one now lost to me. I returned to the bathroom and, looking in the mirror again, found the pox had spread from my nose onto my cheeks. The sores wept with a thin, watery substance, the colour of curdled milk.

It is strange how man is not much different from a machine; our patterns programmed into us. Even in this, the most extraordinary of circumstances, my first instinct was to go to work, hoping I would find salvation in drudgery.

None of the other commuters paid me any mind on the tube. In the reflection of the dark windows of the carriage, the face no longer smiled. In fact, it displayed no emotion. It was blank, but I wasn’t fooled. This was a predator’s instinct, like a lion paused mid-step to avoid alerting the herd of the gazelle it had already marked out as its prey.

When I arrived at work, Lisa was in the office. *Good*. *Embrace normality. Greet he*r.

“Good morning.”

 The words emerged muffled. The face refused to move its lips. Lisa recoiled. *Who is this diseased man? Is he contagious?* She murmured hello before returning to her work. *She wants you gone.*

So there it was. There could be no further denial; Lisa’s reaction confirmed my face had been stolen by a hideous impostor. What could I do except lose myself in project plans and emails? One by one, as my colleagues entered the office, *people I had known for years*, the very air of the room changed as they looked upon this deformed stranger they found among them. Stolen stares gave way to hushed whispers. *What does he want? Shall we call the police?*

There were thirty-three unread emails in my inbox. *Concentrate on the emails; work them down*. I was into single digits when Harry approached me.

“Please leave. You don’t belong here.”

Harry was a friend. I had attended his wedding, had been to his house, had looked after his kids. All our history instantly rendered irrelevant as he gazed upon the face. He winced as I tried to speak. Those foreign lips still refused to part, forcing me to shout my words past them.

“It’s me, John.”

“I’m sorry but John is a colleague and a friend of mine. You are not John.”

*What could I do to convince him?*

“I was born in Plaistow. You’re married to Susan. Last year I was project manager on the…” and so it went, my desperate attempts to convince him to no avail. He asked me to leave. *Again*. Perhaps you would have fought harder, expounded more on your shared history? I tell you such efforts would have been in vain. The man did not know me, so I had little choice but to depart.

As I walked back to the train station, the face stopped blinking. How often does one really think about blinking? It’s an automated act, as natural as breathing air. I hadn’t considered the face would have power over it as well.

Take a moment to understand. Try not to blink. Doesn’t the realisation you are unable to close your eyes cause irrational panic? Don’t stop now; keep them forced open. Do you feel the slow burn creeping in, accompanied by a primal fear? You have no control. You have *no* control. *You* have *no* control.

You can close them now.

I couldn’t.

Any man would have begged for mercy from the face like I did.

“Come on, let me blink. Don’t do this.”

Merciless. Cruel. The face knew no pity. It forced the left eyelid shut and opened the right as far as it could go. Again, the burning. Again, the deep, primitive panic. The rest of my body, still loyal, still mine, reacted with instinct. I barely registered the ragged breaths sucking in cold air, or the build-up of lactic acid as my legs moved me closer and closer to home.

I do not recall arriving back at my flat. All I remember is the sound of running water and the cold feel of the stainless steel tap in my hand. Before I could plunge my face beneath the water for relief, the face forced the right eyelid shut, leaving me engulfed in an awful and lonely darkness. The horror was too much for a conscious mind. One moment I was in the darkness, the next I awoke hours later, still in that terrible black void.

Was the face still upon me? My fingers confirmed the worst, not only was the face still there, the pox had spread even further; the lesions now crusted over. I pressed one just below the nose and it burst, emanating a foul-smelling discharge which would have made me vomit if I had eaten.

What could I do but plead once again?

“Why are you doing this? I haven’t done anything.”

Without my consent, the tips of the mouth began to move slowly to the sides until eventually they stretched as far as they could into a sneer. A deep ache ran from my jaw into my neck, the face in total control and relishing its dominion. Finally, I understood. The face wanted to kill me. It would deprive me of water, drying me out, my last moments consumed by thirst, then, when I lay in my grave, it would remain, contorting and twisting, relishing in my defeat.

*No*.

I would not go alone. We would go together.

*The kitchen.*

The thousands of journeys from the bathroom to the living room to the kitchen, which I had never paid any mind, now enabled me to find my way there, blindness be damned. My legs took me where I needed to go. I knew if I reached out to my right I would feel the cold laminate surface below my fingers. I did. Running my fingers to the left led them to the plastic base of my kettle, where directly below was the cutlery drawer.

As I opened it, the metal inside clanged loudly. There were three sections in the drawer, forks on the right, spoons in the middle, and knives on the left. There was one knife I needed, the one I wrapped my hand around, my liberating instrument. It had a large wooden handle, so unlike my other knives, so much easier to discern, so much *sharper.*

I began with the eyelids. The face tried to stop me, keeping the left eyelid pushed firmly down. Its efforts were feeble, hardly any strength was needed to pull it open. I pierced the thin sheet of skin and slashed it away with a quick flick of the wrist. It came apart so easily, like cheap one-ply toilet paper. Pain swept backwards through my skull and I heard a loud, distant scream. It took me a moment to realise it was coming from me. No, not me. *The face.*

I laughed, *oh how I laughed*, drowning that pathetic scream out.

The right eyelid went the same way. Warm blood ran down past my cheeks and onto my chin, but I didn’t care. I could see. Next were the lips which had gloated so proudly.

As I pulled the bottom lip out towards the blade, the face desperately tried to pull it back. Pointless. A quick jab and the lip was skewered upon my knife. It was slightly tougher than the eyelids, although not too tough. Tearing away both lips felt like stripping pulled pork.

Now for what remained of the face. I started at the hairline, placed the blade horizontally and shaved downwards, peeling away the face piece by piece. *That* is what I remember most; the sound of each scrape as I rid myself of it.

Was I in pain? Of course, but also triumphant, euphoric, my foe vanquished. The deed completed, I found myself staring up at the kitchen light. I thought about a jam sandwich my sister had shoved into my orange juice when I was a little boy, and how it had looked the next morning, soggy floating clumps of strawberry and bread.

I didn’t die.

The neighbours heard the whole commotion and I awoke in the hospital. Assessments, court orders… I won't bore you with the details. I don’t see any point in discussing them further. What is the surest sign of a madman, if not his rambling?

As I said, the doctor has repeatedly asked why I did it and he's never believed me. I’m committing these words to Reddit so I can make it clear. To be honest, I’ve always felt the real me existed only in thought, and what is writing if not the commitment of thought to paper or the screen? Maybe this disconnect was what empowered the face to conduct its invasion.

I believe I have proved my veracity, and my sanity, and that you will strongly support my release so I can get my life back. If you doubt me, I actually have a question for you to put this to bed once and for all.

If what I tell you is not true, then who am I, for the man with my face who lived in my flat and worked my job, has never been seen since?
