We were just kids. We would play on the backs; it was 2 separate dirt paths running concurently next to each other with tress and garages separating eachother. The trees were English oak and hawthorns and had huge thorn bushes between them. Growing up around here was magnificent, all our houses were connected as they were terrace and were on a long street and again, we had the backs. In summer it was amazing, the grass was green, the trees glistening in the sun and late nights. The winter was also fantastic as there was a big mound of old tar and coal that we could sled down and it looked magical as old uk towns do. 

 The neighbours were all so kind. You had Gordon and Wendy who were an elderly couple and would always bring us ice pops. You had Luke and Jason who were what we believed were brother at the time however as I reached older years realised they were happily married, but always took the time to talk to me and my friends. There was also Scott and Linda who lived on the end; Scott would regularly drive around in his Subaru and give us rides up and down the back strips so fast and Linda, his mum, was disabled however we would help her mow the garden and pick up leaves in the winter.

My best friend was Alan. Alan was a great student and a formidable tennis player. Alan also had a younger sister called Annie who was also a talented football player and was in our county under 10’s team. Me and Alan would regularly sit on the back up until late and go climb some trees and hang out. We did this for years, it was so peaceful and we were only around 8 and technology hasn’t really taken off like it had now. 

It was on a warm may evening in 2005. Me and Alan were in the biggest tree on the backs when we here Annie shouting for Alan to come home as his mum had asked her. I climbed down the tree with Alan and we started walking down the backs where we saw one of the other kids on the street Josh. We were quite a distance away so we  didn’t stop to talk and just waved. I waved goodbye to Alan and Annie at their door and continued down the road to my house where I took of my clothes and got into bed, falling asleep quickly. 

I awaken to heavy thuds on our front door. It must be the middle of the night I think to myself. I go to my bedroom door where I see my dad stood at the top of the stairs frozen as the banging intensified. My dad walks down and asks who’s there.
‘Have you seen Josh he hasn’t come home! The police are out looking for him right now’. 
The next few days were a blur. He was all over the news, the school sent out huge search parties. The streets were quieter and eerie. I can remember speaking to the police in multiple occasions. However nothing was ever found or was any arrest ever made. 

Josh went missing in may in 2005. He has never been found. 

Around 5 months later, news had died down. It was small town England. It was colder now but everyone started staying out a bit later again and our parents allowed it ‘as long as we stayed in groups’. Me, alan and Annie were yet again climbing trees when we hear my dad calling so as per usual we begin our route home from the back around to the front. We get to their house and I wave them inside and start walking towards my house just further down the street. I walk passed an alley way that disconnected two of the house between number 18 and 20. A similar place to where we had waved at Josh. 

‘Hey!’ A voice beckons 
I turned around shocked and caught off guard. The alley way is dark but I can see a silhouette of a man, thinking back now around 5’5 with shoulder length hair and thick glasses. It was hard too see him. 
‘I’ve dropped my car keys somewhere in here can you help me find them’ 
My stomach sank, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up and my heart started racing. It’s strange, I’ve never felt a feeling of utter terror in my life. It felt like a bad seed had just been planted in my stomach and something was telling me to just run. 

I got home slammed through the front and explain what has just happened to my dad. My dad walks out of the house where we see a red mini flying down the street. He goes halfway down the street to were the alleyway is and there is nobody there. We go home call the police and explain what happened. I had 2 officers come down and again speak to me. 

Fast forward around 2 years, nothing has happened. The streets are back to the way things were. Me and my friend group were coming on 10/11 at this point however plenty of new children were filling up the backs. Just as we had. I’m now allowed further out and about 10 minutes away there’s another street with similar backs however a bit more run down than ours. We were all playing with new friends we had met when the sun started to set so we walked on home. It was me Allen and Annie again, the usual 3. It was a Friday so they were going to come to mine to play some Xbox.

We were walking close to number 18 and 20 when me and Alan stopped to look at a new lamp that one of ours friends Jordan had put in his window and Annie kept strolling forward when we heard “hey!” 
Again my heart dropped. The same feeling of dread and death I had felt years before.
“I’ve dropped my keys down here think you can lend me a hand” I scream at her to come to me now and we cross the road and to the other side of the street. I look down the alleyway. The same shadow, the same thick rimmed glasses, just looking and staring. 

We explained the situation to my dad and he again called the police. This time I can remember more officers arrived and the street was full of lights. 

After investigations took place and news spread like wildfire the shocking truths came out; inside the house was an old ping pong table with ropes coming off the sides, Bone saws, hammers andnails. It turns out that 4 different children’s DNA was found at the crime scene. The house belonged to an old man who had been living in a facility for 7+ years so nobody lived there. 

Upon further investigation there was evidence of cannibalism and torture. I don’t know what I escaped that day and I don’t think I ever want to know.
