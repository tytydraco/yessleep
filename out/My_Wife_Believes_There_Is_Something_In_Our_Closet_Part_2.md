[I ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/snrVGTZ46s) felt my heart lurch into my chest, matched only by the speed of the car lurching forward as I raced to beat the yellow light ahead, barely making it to a string of angry beeps from oncoming traffic.

I went on like that until I reached the house. I hardly paused to turn the car off as I pulled into the driveway, leaping out and up to the door as I fumbled for my keys.

“Janice?” I called, as the door swung open to reveal an empty foyer and living room, only the echo of my voice as a response.

I stepped inside and immediately felt my skin crawl, an awful charge buzzing in the room, like the feeling of the air after a violent storm.

The floor creaked under the weight of my work boot as I stepped inside, scanning for any sign of my wife. A quick glance into the living room revealed no sign of her, save for a half-empty coffee mug on the table in front of the couch.

The television was on, playing some Netflix reality show or another, but it was muted which felt odd given the circumstances. I felt a cold snake of dread coil tighter around my gut, making my way through to the kitchen, which was equally empty, and finally towards the stairs that would carry me to the second floor.

As I approached the foot of the steps, I could hear the faintest whispering echoing from somewhere upstairs. It was so faint I couldn’t make out the words, and while I tried to dismiss it as perhaps coming from our bedroom television, I couldn’t do away with the sick feeling it gave me.

Suddenly, I felt transported back to the hallway in Mrs. Aldridge’s home, each step nearer to the top of the stairs eerily familiar to that moment before the doorway.

I called for her once more at the top of the stairs, my voice echoing through the hallway with an effect that was uncomfortably isolating, and yet every creak of the stairs raised the hairs on my neck to attention and forced a glance over my shoulder. It felt like I wasn’t alone, that much I was certain of.

As I stepped into my bedroom there were two things I felt immediately, the first was a wave of what I can only describe as abject terror. I flicked on the light, casting the empty room in a warm glow that somehow did little to do away with my fears. The second was the cold.

The room was freezing - as though someone had left open a window amid the negative temperatures outside, though a quick look around proved that not to be the case. No, it wasn’t coming from the window, I realized, but the closet…the realization of which only added to my fear and confusion.

A cold sweat began to knit at my brow, my stomach wavering at the sudden and overwhelming sense of surreality that clung to the air like an awful stench. My eyes fell immediately on the closet door across the room from me. It hung just barely ajar, and yet there was no mistaking the source of that indiscernible whispering, coming from somewhere within.

I felt an almost magnetic pull away from the door, every molecule in my body charged with a primal panic that screamed only “danger”, and yet, I had to find Janice and if she was in there for whatever reason…

I steeled my nerves as I approached the door, the source from which the surreality that filled the air seemed to pour like a busted fire hydrant. I flicked the light switch, once then twice, to no avail. Cursing the damn bulb to myself, I pulled the door open. In an instant, the odd whispering ceased.

Inside, I found a darkness, so oppressive I was sure I was seeing wrong. The light of the room seemed to reach inside only to be smothered by shadow so thick it seemed almost tangible.

Something in me screamed for me to step away, to shut the door and leave the room behind, and yet, a louder voice, almost audible in my head, called me forward. I reached out, my hand moving past the boundaries of the doorway as I felt for the opposite wall. We’d lived in the house for years, and from previous renovations, I knew our closet was barely more than four feet in length.

And yet, as I reached inside, I couldn’t help but feel as though I was grasping into a void, a creeping sensation rising in me that at any moment I would feel the clasp of cold hands around my wrist, pulling me into an abyss waiting to envelop me. I pulled back, feeling no hint of the wall on either side and that rising dread threatening to swallow me whole.

“Janice,” I mumbled, “You in there?” My voice came low almost by instinct as though if I spoke too loud the wrong thing might hear me.

My ears perked as I listened for the sound of movement, or anything, and after several moments I could hear it - the faintest, wet breathing. A sensation like thousands of cold needles rolled across my skin, raising every hair in its wake and leaving a pit in my chest which the dread flooded to fill.

I reached for my phone, almost cursing myself mentally for forgetting its presence in my pocket as I pulled it out, intent to aim the light into the darkness ahead. The feeling of a hand closing on my shoulder set every nerve alight, as I spun with a fist raised, ready to meet my assailant.

The sight of Janice, shrinking away from me at my immediate aggression was like a bucket of ice water on the fires of fear-induced anger rolling through me.

“I’m sorry, fuck, I,” I searched for an excuse, my hand gesturing lamely at the closet door behind me, “I thought I heard something and -”

Before I could find an excuse, I found myself pulled into a hug so tight it silenced me on the spot, a conflicting mix of confusion, and yet an undeniable relief at the sight of her all surged through me at once. And still, there was that lingering unease, made no better by her sudden appearance to my disappointment, if anything it seemed to grow, that sensation that something was wrong - something in plain sight and yet obscured.

It was like forgetting a word, just at the tip of your tongue, a disconcerting, almost surreal sort of sensation.

“It’s okay,” Janice spoke, her tone heavy with emotion, “I’m just - I’m glad you’re home.”

There was something in her expression that I couldn’t read, like a vague sort of wildness in her eyes that she was doing her best to hide. She ran a hand along my face, as though it had been years since we’d last seen one another, and I felt that her palm was freezing, cold, and clammy as though she’d just had her hands buried in snow.

“Jesus Christ,” I breathed, shuddering as a chill wracked my body, before grabbing her hand and cupping it between my own in an effort to warm her.

“You’re freezing, like, ice cold. Were you outside?” I asked, getting my first good look at her in hours.

Her features seemed to confirm the answer before she could speak, her eyelids the palest of blues as were her lips, which seemed chapped beyond anything reasonable. And there was more, something to her appearance I couldn’t quite peg, yet felt off…

Looking back, it was all too obvious, but at that moment, with my mind everywhere it lurked just beyond my recognition.

Still, I could feel the questions piling up, overwhelmed with everything about the situation, I elected only to pull her into a hug.

“Yeah, I - I’m alright. I was waiting outside for you.”

She could see the question on my face before I could ask it.

“I don’t know - I freaked myself out today, I’m sorry. I - I know I worried you. Everything is fine, I promise.”

There was a look in her eyes that told me whatever had happened, she was eager to forget about it. Perhaps it was some embarrassment at the whole ordeal, nothing had really happened, and she was hesitant to acknowledge she’d let childish fears get away with her, the behavior certainly uncharacteristic. And yet, after all my uneasy experiences throughout the day, even moments prior, I found it difficult to accept.

“Are - are you sure?” I could hear the consternation in my tone, voice wavering as the hair on the back of my neck still perked, the door behind me seeming to loom uneasily.

“I’d thought I heard you up here…” I began, though I realized quickly I was unsure of how to even explain the moments before her arrival, my own recollection feeling almost dream-like, the surreality of it all making it feel foolish.

“I don’t know.” I silently relented the question. “It’s been an…odd day.”

She nodded, smiling though the expression didn’t seem to reach her eyes.

“It has. I’m sorry if I scared you, I think maybe I didn’t get enough sleep. Why do you come to bed, warm me up?”

She smiled at that, running a hand along my face once more. It was a gesture clearly meant to calm my nerves, and yet in that moment, I felt my stomach sink as though a black hole had opened itself within me. Suddenly, as though whispered by a ghost, I could hear the last words Janice had said to me over the phone.

*It’s not me Calvin, I know what it will look like but it's NOT me. I’m so sorry, but you can’t trust her.*

That cold, seeping dread ran down my back like melting ice as realization struck an awful blow.

Her dimple, that little detail that I’d all but obsessed over in our time together, something I knew all too well, was on the left side of her face. It may seem a small thing, perhaps, but it struck like a bolt of lightning. I know that woman's face better than my own, I could only wonder how I had missed it for this long…her face - it was…wrong.

The features were all reversed or misshapen in subtle but apparent ways, as though I were somehow staring into a reflection or computer recreation of my Janice, and once I noticed it was impossible to unsee. At once, I felt a coldness clinging to my skin, a lingering unease that made my stomach turn.

Something was deeply wrong. Though I couldn’t put the pieces together, they were beginning to grow clearer in my mind though still disordered. Something had happened while I was away, something involving that damned closet.

I could see the frown working its way into her features, my consternation apparent in my expression, despite my best attempts to conceal my growing panic.

“Are you okay? I’m…sorry if I scared you. Just forget about it, okay? Everything is alright.” She spoke with that voice that was so familiar, and yet even that, now that I listened closely, was off, just a tad deeper and slightly more raspy than it ever had been before.

This - person, whoever it was, she wasn’t my wife. The thought felt insane, conspiratorial, and utterly devoid of reality, and yet I was as sure as anything. I tried to force a smile, though I knew it was weak.

“I’m - yeah, I’m good,” I lied, trying my best to force some levity in my voice where I felt an utter void, growing with each question that occurred to me by the second.

Where was Janice? My Janice? What was happening, and why? And perhaps, most importantly who, or what had replaced her and what had they done to her?

I wanted to blurt them out at her, yet that little voice in my head that had seemingly screamed out from the moment I’d entered the house seemed to warn against it. Whatever had happened, I knew better than to act until I learned more. To do that, I was going to have to act clueless.

“Exhausted but I’m okay. I’m glad you’re fine. I’m hungry,” I began, doing my best to appear as casual as possible given my every nerve seemed alight.

“I’m thinking Chinese tonight,” I offered, before adding, “I know it’s your favorite.”

She smiled, and I felt something cold lurch in me at the expression, none of the usual warmth present in her eyes.

“You know me well.”

That was last night. It’s 2:13 A.M. now. I’m writing this from the couch on my laptop. “Janice” is asleep upstairs. I’m not sure what my next move will be.

I know I can’t go to the police, there’s nothing concrete to tell them. For now, I’ll have to observe and see what I can learn, and collect it here in hopes that one of you good folks can offer some advice.

Thanks in advance, and wish me luck or pray for me, whichever I suppose.

And for Janice, wherever she is right now.

…

I don’t know where to begin. The past day has upended everything I thought I knew about my wife, my life, and the town I’ve called home for as long as I can remember.

I waited until “Janice” or whoever it was upstairs, had gone to sleep. It had been hours before she’d left my side, and all the while I couldn’t shake the feeling that she was watching me. I would catch her eyes on me every so often, and though she’d feign a smile, I could always feel that sensation that I was being observed, my every action scrutinized.

We’d spent much of the night in relative silence, between bouts of eating from “Janice” as though it had been weeks since she’d had a full meal.

Every so often she would return to the kitchen, fixing herself some meal or another. I would listen from atop the stairs as the kitchen fell silent, and I swear, I could hear the faintest sounds like an animal tearing into flesh, low growls, and sounds I knew were impossible for any human.

I don’t know when I settled on the conclusion that the person in my bed may not be human. My mind felt a storm of paranoia, everything about the night feeling eerily like I was losing my grip on my sanity, and yet I couldn’t escape the strangeness at hand - that feeling like I was in a waking nightmare, and the true horror was yet to begin.

By the time she’d fallen asleep, I knew I needed to search for information.

I’d managed to sneak Janice’s laptop downstairs, intent on going through it for some hope of a clue. A short search for her phone had proven useless, and none of the calls I’d discreetly made had gone through, leaving the computer as my only potential lead.

I made my way to the couch, angling myself in such a way as to maintain a view of the stairs leading towards the bedroom.

Opening the device, I felt my stomach turn at the screensaver.

It was an image of the two of us, Janice as she truly was, taken months before on a hike. I felt a strange sort of yearning for a woman who, by all accounts, was only a floor away, though I knew there was something more at play. Resolve burned like coals in my chest. I was going to get to the bottom of…all of this, this strange web of half-formed mysteries, somehow, and I was going to return to that happiness. I possessed a confidence that would serve as a straw shield under the onslaught I would soon find myself against.

I could see several notifications on the screen, displaying a series of missed video calls and messages. Though most had come from me, there were several emails from a .gov account I didn’t recognize, all of which raised my suspicion to a fever pitch.

The headline of one caught my eye immediately, setting my heart to pounding with a nauseating suspicion.

‘URGENT: Project Doorway -  Unforeseen Effects, Potential Dangers’

It had been sent a mere three hours prior, unopened by the looks of it.

“Project Doorway?” I found myself repeating the words, nothing in them ringing even the faintest of bells.

I couldn’t understand why something that reads so…official and almost threatening would be being sent to Janice. Her work wasn’t the sort that should have any sort of danger attached. She was a college professor and an archeologist, neither job was known for its ‘potential dangers’.

At any other time, I might have disregarded the message, assuming it to be some spam missed by the filter. But with the events of the day, it all felt too coincidental to leave to chance.

I tried the password she used for most of her accounts, shared with me long ago ‘in case anything ever happened’. Janice had always been one for precautions, the sort of person who had her emergency contacts numbered. At the time it hadn’t seemed odd, but as I entered each of the passwords, I found none of them worked.

I had never had reason to go on my wife’s computer before, we were much too old to check one another’s messages, and I had my own. The possibility that she had changed it at some point, and forgotten to tell me seemed to lurk overhead like a guillotine, threatening to cut off the only potential leads I may have as to what was going on. I could feel desperation growing in me with each attempt, the device eventually warning that another failed attempt would result in its locking for several hours.

“Fuck,” I spat, standing for a moment as if to better allow myself to think.

I ran my hands along my face, the full weight of my situation seeming to press in around me.

A thought occurred, like a flashlight shining in a dark forest, and I found myself quickly returning to my place, opening my phone, and navigating to Janice and I’s text thread.

The last message she sent had been entirely out of place at the moment, but now it felt like a thread of understanding had emerged, guiding me forward. I punched in my name and birth year, clapping my hands together in a momentary wave of satisfaction before the need for silence occurred to me, suspicion like thistles on a vine creeping over my brain.

I navigated to her messages, scanning the missed calls using the caller ID application she used for work.

“Always prepared.” I muttered, smiling at the thought though it felt bittersweet.

There were several from me and three more from someone appearing only as ‘Unknown Caller’. They were spread out over the last few hours, the most recent arriving a mere hour prior, when “Janice” had still been in my company.

I could recall no such phone calls being made, no ringing, or even the briefest moment of fumbling with her phone. It had grown obvious to me at some point that whoever, or whatever, this doppelganger was, she didn’t have my wife’s cell phone. The thought offered the faintest ray of hope, though as I made my way into her emails, I found it quickly buried under a growing mound of confusion.

I clicked the first, the only labeled ‘Doorway Project’, and found myself reading the most recent email in a chain that spanned several months - the content of which only made me feel as though the hole I was in had grown deeper, the truth of whatever was unfolding even more obscured.

The emails seemed to detail the preparation, and results of some sort of experiment - or a series of them - government-run by the looks of it, taking place between staff at the local college in Redbrook and its counterpart at the nearby town of Cold Lake, apparently the old military base just outside of town - which until that moment, I’d known to have been decommissioned since the 80’s.

I’ve never considered myself a dumb person, in fact, quite the opposite, my field requires a certain level of technical know-how and yet, I found myself utterly dumbfounded by what I was reading.

From what I could gather, the procedure seemed to be some sort of experiment dealing with energy and theoretical methods of transportation, but that was the extent of what I could gather before it devolved into a level of scientific lingo far beyond my paygrade, and more than that, I was sure I had to be misunderstanding as what I was reading seemed…impossible.

Beyond the messages received, I found myself both perplexed and disturbed by those my wife had seemed to send in response, her tone every bit as clinical, her responses as arcane and unfamiliar as those before. I’d talked to my wife about her work at the school before, and while there were things about being an archaeology professor I’m sure I was yet to understand, there was no doubt in my mind that whatever she had been involved in was far beyond that.

My eyes scanned the months of emails, anxiety passing over in waves of a rising tide as I did so.

There were all manner of official-looking titles and bold warnings about confidentiality, each making my stomach turn with the sensation that I was stumbling into something larger than I had realized.

I swallowed hard against the knot I felt forming in my throat. I had to start somewhere, I realized, lest I risk being drowned under the sheer weight of it all. Beginning with the most recent of the unread messages, I began reading.

‘*Dr. Rodgers,*

*Dr. Anders has made multiple attempts to reach you, to fill you in on the events of the past day. There has been an unusual increase in our readings at the Redwood Field Office. The test was a success, perhaps too much so. The device seems to have expanded its reach beyond our intended area of effect.*

*If the numbers are to be believed, the magnetic activity in the town has spiked, and we’ve received some concerning reports from some of your fellow staff regarding potential unforeseen side effects of the project. We would like for you to report back to base as soon as possible for something of an unofficial “quarantine” of those we believe may be most affected.*

*While the situation is urgent, I would like to encourage caution and level-headedness as we begin. It is imperative that the matter is dealt with swiftly, and effectively, and any panic on the part of our staff might prove greatly detrimental at this time.*

*We thank you for your cooperation.*

*Dr. Brian Alexander, PhD*

*Head of Operations at the Redbrook Research Facility'*

None if it made any sense to me. Janice had never at any point mentioned taking part in any sort of experiment, especially none that might require a quarantine. I wanted to believe it had been sent on accident, but her messages from earlier had disproved the theory. She’d been hiding something from me, something massive by the looks of it.

I could feel a strange mix of irritation, and dawning horror at the realization that as complicated a web as I already seemed to find myself in, it had grown all the more complex, and had been weaving itself around my household long before I was aware it even existed.

“Oh Janice,” I found myself breathing, an odd and sudden sort of grief taking hold, “What the hell have you gotten us into?”

I began the following email, sent just over two hours later.

‘*To all Staff,*

*If you have received this message, you are requested to report back to the nearest base or military installation in your area. We are working closely with local officials to ensure all procedures are followed effectively. This request is mandatory, with failure to meet the requirements potentially punishable under 42 Code of Federal Regulations, parts 70 and 71, by either fine or imprisonment.*

*We encourage discretion and urgency in your handling of this process. Personal belongings capable of being fit in a backpack or something of similar size will be permitted following security checks, however, we will be requiring all cell phones, cameras, and devices capable of recording be temporarily confiscated.*

*We appreciate your prompt cooperation.*’

I could feel my heart thudding like a hammer against my chest, as I tried to make sense of it all.

My wife had gotten herself involved in something massive, and whatever it was it seemed to have gone catastrophically wrong. The notable shift in tone between the messages struck me as important. Despite the almost clinical tone of the last email, I could sense the urgency behind it.

The faint creak of the floorboards above my head made my stomach lurch. It was followed by several more. She was awake, that woman who looked so much like my wife and yet not quite. I had to hurry.

I scrolled to the final message, feeling my face grow warm with the rush of blood moving through me as I read.

‘*Staff,*

*Disregard the prior messages. We apologize for any inconvenience or panic they may have caused. Dr. Alexander will be on leave until further notice.*

*Project Doorway will continue. We have made great progress, and the fears of the few shall not stand in the way of the progression of the many.*

*Dr. Anson Aldridge*

*Acting Head of Operations at the Redwood Research Facility'*

“Aldridge,” I breathed, the name itching at my brain with a faint familiarity.

As if a match had been struck amidst the darkness, it clicked, my mind returning to the image of the man I’d seen that morning, several times throughout the house I’d been sent to.

Mrs. Aldridge, the woman had been called, the realization hit like a ton of bricks. And her husband…she’d mentioned his name, hadn’t she? I could feel a nauseating sort of unease as I recalled her words. Her husband was dead, wasn’t he? I could have sworn she had said as much and yet here seemed evidence to the contrary. Perhaps it had been an assumption on my part, with all that had unfurled throughout the day, such small details seemed impossible to recall.

The sudden rush of movement from somewhere upstairs, a cacophony of thuds like some large animal bounding across the floor just above my head, made me freeze in my tracks. The blood in my veins seemed to grow thick and syrupy, moving through my veins with a chilling effect.

“Janice?” My voice wavered far more than I’d anticipated as it seemed to hang in the impending silence with an unusual weight, anticipation weaved into the quiet that seemed to grip the very world around me.

I shut the laptop, rising as carefully as I could, feeling that odd sensation that warned me that making the slightest sound would be dangerous. I winced as the floor creaked beneath my weight.

“Honey?” I called, the word feeling like poison in my mouth as I addressed the person upstairs.

I felt insane. Surely none of this made any sense, surely I was being ridiculous, misunderstanding…something about what had happened throughout the day.

“Calvin…” Janice's voice seemed to float through the air with a singsong lilt, from somewhere upstairs.

There was something in her tone, something in the almost cruel humor with which she spoke my name that made me stir uneasily.

*“Come to bed, Callllvin, I miss youuu…”*

Something was wrong, I could feel it in my gut, a churning unease all too similar to what I’d felt that morning, standing in Mrs. Aldridge’s living room while that voice summoned me from the open doorway. Her voice - it wasn’t right…there was something in it, a wheezing sort of hiss that made my stomach turn.

“You okay, babe?” I called, doing my best to hide the strain of fear from my voice.

She knows. The thought was like ice water doused over me, setting the goosebumps to rising across my skin.

There was another sudden scurry of movement upstairs, this time closer, perhaps in the hallways by the sounds of it.

I rounded the couch to get a better view up the stairs, feeling the voice again practically shrieking for me to leave, to turn my back on that house, and not look back. I knew it wasn’t an option. Wherever my wife was, I wasn’t going to stop until I had found her, and understood just what she’d gotten involved in.

“Janice?” I called again.

I peered up the stairway, cloaked in a darkness so thick it almost seemed like I could reach out and touch it, the top of the landing sitting empty, just barely illuminated by the faintest light stretching up from the living room.

A long, errant creak rang out from somewhere just beyond where even the light seemed able, or willing, to venture.

I could just barely make out a form, standing mostly obscured by the wall, with long dark hair hanging over the face.

*Tttap. Tttap.*

Janice stood unnaturally still, hiding herself behind the wall as she peaked around the corner in an almost childish fashion, her neck craned at such an angle that I couldn’t make sense of it, certain the shadows were playing tricks with my vision. A single hand gripped the corner of the wall, muscles tense like a claw as she tapped repeatedly, almost absentmindedly.

I could feel the blood turn to ice in my veins, everything about the scene before me oozing an uncomfortable surreality that made the air feel of static and awful tension.

*"Sweetheart,”* the voice that echoed from the top of the stairs made my skin crawl.

It was Janice’s but not quite, as though it had come through a broken recording or some cheap AI program.

*“Come to bed…”* there was something almost mocking in the way she - it spoke to me, as though an unspoken threat lingered between each syllable. I could feel a sudden rage burning hot in my chest, momentarily greater than the fear that had rooted me in place.

This thing - whoever, or whatever it was dared to mock me in my own home, mimicking the face and voice of the woman I loved. I could feel hot indignation driving me forth as I took my first steps up the creaking stairs.

“I don’t know who you are,” I growled through gritted teeth, hoping it would serve to stave off the fear still lingering in my voice.

“I don’t know what you are. But you are not my wife.” Her head cocked to the side with such suddenness I paused momentarily, as it watched me in a way that was oddly reminiscent of an owl, head turned at an angle that seemed impossible to replicate. I still couldn’t make out much of the face, but I could now barely see its mouth, lips thin and gray pulled back into a humorless smirk.

Still, I pressed on, driven forth by a bravery fueled only by rage and a mind teetering unsteadily on the borders of mental exhaustion.

“So you’re going to tell me where Janice is, and what the fuck you’ve done to her, and then you’re going to get the fuck out of my house and crawl back into whatever hellhole you stumbled out of. This is not your home.”

I found myself paused, halfway up the stairs, hardly aware I’d stopped at all. For a moment, the air held silent, with a tension so heavy it felt almost gravitational. My eyes didn’t waver from the woman at the top of the stairs. For a split second, I almost allowed myself to hope the tirade had worked.

As if it could read my mind, the reaction was instant.

The thing that looked like Janice threw its head back, her hair falling back to reveal its face, and in an instant, I felt all of that artificial bravado drained from me.

Her mouth hung open like the victim of some heinous car accident, the bones jutting out at the right side of her face in such a way that I could feel a sharp pain in my own jaw at the sight of it. Her skin clung to a skeletal form, thick and paler than the fresh snow, though all through its surface ran dark, jagged cracks as if left in stone, all leading up to those eyes - or rather, the twin pits that glared back at me from where her eyes ought to have been.

It screamed - although that is perhaps not the best way to describe the sound that it made. It was something like the shriek of a victim in a horror movie, raw and ragged and helpless, and just as present was a deep howl, almost wolf-like, that made my very bones tremble.

I watched, rooted in place by a fear so palpable I could feel my knees growing rubbery under my own weight, the scene before me every bit something from a nightmare. Its head began to twitch, turning almost clockwise with all the grace of a jammed gear, the sound of crackling bones ringing out and making my stomach turn in unrest.

It stuttered forward, neck swaying unnaturally as more of its form came into view, and suddenly I felt the sensation return to my legs - that primal part of my brain screaming only one thing - run.

I stumbled backward, barely managing to catch myself on the railing as I watched it sway forth. Its neck seemed to stretch twice the length of anything that should be possible, head bobbing side to side under its weight, its arm stretched around the wall, bending in ways my mind strained to understand as those tapping fingers began to dig into the drywall.

I opened my mouth to speak, a question dying in my throat as only a sharp breath was managed. I turned for a moment, taking the last few steps in leaps, nearly landing awkwardly on my ankle as I hit the ground.

I chanced a glance behind me for just a second, just in time to see it emerge from behind the wall. Its body was a stretched mockery of the human form like those stick figures drawn by children, limbs grotesquely elongated and sharpened at every angle.

“*C - C ome to beeed…*'' it groaned the words, jaw wavering uselessly as it spoke - its voice sickeningly reminiscent of a car accident, like metal on flesh, wet and harsh.

It moved down the stairs with such discordant motion for a moment, I thought it lost balance before realizing what I was seeing - it wasn’t falling, but bounding after me, its body twisting impossibly as it gripped the stairs below with clawed hands and feet, twisting like a slinky as it moved. Only its face remained still, like a fixed point amidst its storm of crackling limbs as those gaping sockets bore into me with a look of empty-minded fixation.

“*Through the door…through the door…you’ll cling to the devil for warmth, through the door…*”

It crooned, repeating the words like some hideous song as it rushed forth.

For a split second, I considered going for the laptop.

The couch was only a few feet away, but it was behind me, and to do so I’d have to risk bringing myself nearer to the thing on the stairs - barely a yard away now. There was no time, I realized, and I hardly had the wherewithal to grab the keys from the bowl on the table in the foyer before fumbling against the doors lock.

My fingers felt like they had a mind of their own, adrenaline coursing through me making my movements twitchy and ungraceful.

“Come the fuck on,” I hissed, finally managing to pull the door open as the beast's thudding approach grew impossibly loud, the heat of its breath almost singeing the hairs on my neck.

I didn’t take the time to look, or even grab my boots, tearing out through the entryway into the stinging cold. I had hardly realized I was screaming until the sounds of the neighborhood dogs, baying and barking in response alerted me to it. I could see lights flickering to life in the still windows of my neighbor's homes, shadows moving behind curtains as they looked to see the cause of the commotion.

The snow bit at my bare feet as I tore down the driveway, rounding my work vehicle in an instant, allowing me a momentary glimpse of the doorway.

There it stood, its figure draped in darkness, the shadow cast across the frozen lawn by the light of the house. It looked…normal again, or as normal as it ever had, glaring at me with hate-filled eyes.

I pulled the door open, climbed into the car, and locked it behind me in one clumsy motion before fumbling the keys into the ignition - all the while, my eyes stayed on the form of that thing…swaying gently in the doorway, fingers twitching at its side as though desperate to be digging into my flesh.

Her lips moved, and though I couldn’t hear her through the roaring wind, I somehow knew what she was saying. That same eerie sentence.

“*Through the door…through the door…you’ll cling to the devil for warmth, through the door…*”

As the car hummed to life, I tore out of the driveway, not slowing down until my neighborhood had disappeared in the rearview. Eventually, realizing I was going nowhere fast, I pulled into the edge of the parking lot of a local gas station.

I punched the steering wheel, once, then twice, again and again until my fist had started to bleed, crying out all the while. It did little to make me feel better, but the outburst had been building from the moment it all began.

When exactly was that? I couldn’t tell anymore. It had all begun for me that morning, with the visit to the old woman’s house…what was her name? Mrs. Aldridge. No, perhaps even sooner than that. I could recollect the vague images of a dream, there had been something the night before. It scratched at the back of my mind like an animal against a locked door, desperate to be heard.

The snow. The doorway. It came back as if a switch had been turned, the nightmare before the morning this had all begun. I could almost feel the snow biting at my skin again, blinding my every direction until I’d seen it…what had I seen? I shook my head, as though the motion might shake loose recollection.

“*Through the door…through the door…*” the thing that wore Janice's face seemed to croon out in my head.

The doorway. I’d dreamed of a doorway. It had to mean something, as ridiculous as it seemed to assign such meaning to a dream, I was at my wit’s end, and anything felt possible. I stepped out into the parking lot, the slush underfoot gnawing at my skin - still numb from my mad flight from the house.

I needed shoes. It was a small thing, but whatever was to come, I wasn’t going to do it barefoot.

Strolling into the gas station, I ignored the odd glance from the lone cashier as I grabbed the cheapest pair of shoes available, a pair of ugly cheap things that looked like the sort every grandmother owns. They were half a size too small, but they’d prevent me from losing a toe to frostbite, which felt dangerously possible at the moment. Throwing a twenty on the table I quickly exited, muttering an apology to the cashier for reasons I wasn’t certain, modeling the newest addition to my wardrobe.

As I slid into the driver's seat, I found myself unable to move for several moments, gazing ahead at the mundanity of the gas station. I had to stifle a laugh. It all seemed so normal, there were monsters in my house, my wife was gone, and yet the world had the audacity to seem normal.

Without any other ideas of what to do, mind racing with impossible events, I pulled out my phone and began updating my account of the day's events. It seems foolish now, but at the moment, with my very grasp on what I understood to be reality failing, I needed to do something that made sense, and it felt that if I at least wrote the events out, perhaps it would make it all less…insane.

And beyond that, there was a hope, faint though it was that I’d be able to share it all with Janice soon enough, and somehow, she’d use that big brain of hers to explain how I’d simply misunderstood it all, and through some scientific phenomenon or another It’d all been a stress-induced delusion. I bit back a smile, the thought of her long, drawn-out explanation bringing the first sense of warmth I’d felt since that morning.

I still didn’t feel any better by the time I’d finished, nearly an hour had passed and several uneasy glances from the cashier shot at me through the window. I sat alone in my car, freezing, feet crunched into shoes two sizes too small, and with an impossible story to which I had no conclusion, no hint of what to do next.

It was then that an idea occurred to me, and before I could consider whether it was a good one, I’d pulled the car forward and out of the parking lot the hint of some perceived progress pushing me forth.
