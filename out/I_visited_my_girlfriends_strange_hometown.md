I was dating a blonde woman named Amanda in her early 20s. 

She was still in the process of calming down her recklessness after her father had shortly released her from her gilded cage a few years ago.

 She was fun, but in my opinion a bit too clingy sometimes.

 I met her courtesy of living in an area that would usually be out of my means. 

We lived in a medium sized city apartment in a part usually reserved for people in the upper class. 

Our house was smaller than the others and it's contemporary exterior being a gray square made it an eye sore of the neighborhood as it rivaled Victorians, Tudors, and even Georgian style houses. 

The rest of the city was marked by large skyscrapers which made it unremarkable to other cities although outside of it were a few suburbs which shielded the city from the otherwise rural terrain.

This time my girlfriend wanted me to meet her parents in a small country town away from our usual urban stomping grounds. 

This was her hometown; a small grouping of normal houses rivaled by a hill filled with large mansions. 

We drive through that hill. She had driven us to a country club in a white colonial looking large house which was part of a larger complex.

 I could see the tennis court and the pool from the large ballroom we sat into. This is my father and my mother said Amanda smiling.

 An old grey man in a military uniform appeared with a happy expression, but dead intense blue eyes. A woman with also grey hair, wearing a pearl necklace, black dress, and a black pillbox hat came forth.

 I shook their hands. 

"What brings you here?" said her mother

" I was just passing by." I joked. 

"Oh this one is so funny." said the mother, "how about you enjoy some food you must be hungry." 

"We don't normally allow visitors here they would get a bit weirded out knowing we eat human meat." said the father. 

"I bet they would." I said as I thought he was joking. 

They took us to the snack bar in a large room without windows. The room was decorated with taxidermy humans used as furniture which did actually pair well with the actual furniture which was red velvet. 

All the humans chosen were extremely good looking men and women. Moreover, human bones, skin, and organs were used as decoration. 

>!With a human hearts being used as center pieces for each persons' tables. A man and woman sewed together into a love seat. Also, a group of four woman somehow misshapen into a working fountain.!<

Human meat was in the form of sausages, wings, and finger food. It was not well cooked and very bloody. 

I never had the pleasure of eating human meat, but I know that it can not be good for one's own mental and physical facilities. 

They all seemed fine or they maybe they were good at hiding their decay states. Either way they did not seem to be bothered by my presence, probably because they knew if I talked, I would become one of their many cruises. 

I turned to Amanda eating bloody human meat wings and being awfully messy about it getting sauce and blood all over her face. 

Even though my nerves were shot, I tried to hand her a napkin. However, in my mind I was worried she would take a large bite out of my hand. 

She asked me if I wanted some, but I insisted that I am trying to be more healthy and would prefer a salad. I went to the snack bar and looked for something without meat in it. 

Eventually, settled on eating a bit from a veggie tray while Amanda continued eating her human meat wings staring at me sadly. 

I looked at the guests happily eating their meat with disgust. I saw another woman eating a human hamburger leaking blood. She looked and me and so I looked away.

Eventually Amanda came over sensing that I was probably not comfortable with everyone at the party eating human meat. 

We got into the car and saw drive home in silence. When we got to our home. I asked her the meaning behind what I just saw. 

She said that the rich were eating human meat to stop overpopulation. She explained that the earth has too many people and so the rich started eating the homeless and prisoners and those that didn't seem to function well in society. In fact, one of the guests owns a prison where the death row inmates are turned into meat after they are euthanized. However, there is so many people that the rich can not eat them all at once, so they are buying lot swaths of farmland and force people to dress up as cows in order to preserve the human meat while not drawing attention to them.

I want to see if she was right, so we drive through the countryside. I managed to go into the back of one of these farms. 

Once I was able to sneak in the farm. I was in a meadow and could see a massive red barn from the distance. I looked at the cows which were people in obvious cow costumes. 

I saw two "cows" mooing in male human voices. I walked to one of them and kicked him to get him to speak English. 

"Moo" he said. I kicked him again. He gave an anger moo. 

A farmer walked up and said why are you kicking my cows in a frantic voice. He was a middle-aged man with denim overalls and gray hair patches on an otherwise bald head. 

"You know those are not really cows," I said. 

"Those are cows look at their udders" he said. 

I took out a knife and cut through one of the guys' cow costumes revealing a rather nerdy looking white man in his mid 20s with curly brown hair and a black T-shirt and jeans. His mouth was sewed shut and all he could do was make sounds. 

"Moo" he said even when he knew he was caught. 

"They are going to eat you!" I said to the man. 

"Moo" he said. 

"You are going to be their lunch!" I said. 

He continued to moo, so I left, and the farmer made no business stopping me. The farmer brought the man back into the barn probably to get him another cow suit.

I went back to my car with Amanda waiting. We drive back to the city. She asked me if I was ok, but I was too scared to say no. 

I realized I didn't know who she was and what she was capable of. I tried to think she was the same person I knew before, but I could not get that picture of her eating the bloody human wings out of my mind. 

"I knew you would be uncomfortable with eating human meat." said Amanda, "but it is something you will have to get used to. I did not want to eat human meat when I first saw people eating it either. However, I got used to it as a necessary evil. "

"It is only a matter of time before we convince society into the benefits of human meat and then we will not need to make them dress as cows." she said. 

"The humans we are removing are the problems of society, those are the homeless, criminals, and those that do not conform to society's norms. We are fixing society. It may be crude and disgusting to think about the fact you are eating another human being, but you will get used to it. I mean we eat cows, pigs, and even lambs and they have feelings and scream when you hurt them. " said Amanda

"Yeah, but you don't see the pigs eating each other." I said.

"Hamsters eat each other and humans have been eating each other since the beginning of history." she said

"I can't deal with this!" I said angrily, "I will not eat my own kind."

Our relationship started to drift apart from there. She would try to act like how she was before or nag me about the benefits about eating human meat, but she noticed I was cold towards her. 

Even worse, she was mad that I would not eat the meat she served me as I was paranoid about her slipping in human meat. 

However, one day my hunch was found true. In early in the morning, I felt her slipped away from her bed. She drove off to some place. I trailed behind her in my car as she went to a farm. 

It stand on a hill overlooking that farm. It was the same farm I had been to before. 

I had binoculars and saw the human cattle in their poorly acted performances as cows. 

She then went to the butchers and ordered some of that meat. I beat her home and went back to bed. I heard her car arrive and then she went back to bed.

She was extra happy that morning. I guess she thought if she could get me to accept human meat then her relationship would be back to normal. I tried to act like I did before, but deep inside I knew it couldn't be. 

This attempt at least was somewhat pleasing for her. We watched some television, and she went to get the human meat from the fridge and began cooking it. I didn't know what to do. Should I escape. We have been together for so long.

"How many humans have you eaten?" I said jokily. 

"Plenty" she said somewhat joking and somewhat concerned about where I was going with this question. 

"Have you killed any yourself?" I said. 

"No, because my father usually hunts them down himself." she said in a rather matter of fact way. 

"Oh" I said "but would you do it yourself?" 

"No, but I don't see you going around killing pig!" she said, "I would prefer not to see how it is done as long as they don't suffer."

"So, what are we having for dinner, honey?" I said. 

She paused. 

"Chicken" said she with a lack of confidence. 

"Chicken" I said as I got out of the coach to look at the meat cooking, "that looks more like beef."

"Beef!?" she said 

"you know it is hard to find good chicken these days. I got it straight from the butcher's." she said. 

I said "I hope you did not get it from butcher shop near the farm we last visited, that guy looked shady."

"You follow me!?" she said with disbelief. 

"Was I wrong to?" "you trying to trick me into eating human meat like your rich friends" I said. 

"Cannibalism does not need to be a taboo she said, it could be a way further for our society." she said. 

"That is not a way further, cave man learned to work together and not kill and eat each other a long time ago." I said. 

She grow with angry and said our relationship is basically on its death bed because you can't just embrace the fact that society is going further while you are standing still. 

"We only eat bad people, we have to eat them to make society a better place." she angrily explained. 

"That is a dumb argument." I said.

 Amanda said in a death, cold tone, "I know you can't stop people from embracing cannibalism, but you better not try". 

"Maybe, I would" I said. 

She said "I can't let you do that we have come so far and I can't let a person even though you are my boyfriend from getting in the way of that."

 I said "looks like you are choosing cannibalism over me".

She said still in a cold tone, "yes, in fact you are too much of a threat anyways". 

She pulled out a knife and began trying to hit but I kept ducking her attacks. 

I dove at her as we wrestle with the knife. 

She was gaining leverage, but out of nowhere in almost with instinct, I stabbed her in the heart, and she plunged towards the floor.

I stood there shocked. She was motionless and not moving. I couldn't call the police. I knew the easiest move was to turn her into meat. 

So, I hid her in my truck and gave her to the butcher near the farm. 

He was a middle-aged man with a surprisedly clean apron, black hair, and a long thick beard. 

"I have a body for you." I said. 

"Is she alive?" the butcher asked. 

"Barely, she was freshly killed." I said. 

This pleased the butcher in a rather twisted way.

A sheriff came to the butchers. 

He was not shocked and knew the butcher was selling human meat. 

"Howdy!" said the sheriff. 

"Howdy!", I said, very nervously 

The butcher and the sheriff got into conversation as the sheriff was interested in looking about how to best cook meat and what seasoning to use. 

I left the butchers feeling awkward.

I started to date another girl; a black haired woman named Chloe.

 Although I was not fully over Amanda I still proceeded with the relationship. 

We went to a Thai restaurant. 

"You enjoy the food?" I ask her said. 

"I don't usually go to Thai restaurants." she said. 

"Really!?" I said concerned about her choices in places. 

I like my meat rare said she to the waitress. 

"Ohh you do!?" I said. 

She eventually went to the bathroom and returned and then we walked out.

 I drove her to her door and then he made out for a couple minutes. 

Then was when I knew I messed up.

 I realized when she went to the bathroom, she had brought human meat. 

She must have known I was avoiding cannibalism and wanted to suck me into it. 

I pretended like nothing happened. 

"Goodnight!" I said. 

"Goodnight!" she said.

I spent that night trying to get rid of my newly found addiction to human meat. 

I locked the door and windows.

 I laid on the floor convulsing and trying to remove the cravings that was trying to enter into my head.

 I woke up to a gathering of people. 

The rich guests of the party I went to, the sheriff, Chole, and Amanda's parents were all here and they were coming towards me. 

They held me and forced human meat into my mouth. I tried to gag from all the meat.

 I fell asleep and woke up to Chloe cooking me something in my house. 

Even without seeing it I knew it was human meat and that I was carving it. I found myself on the couch instead of the floor. She was making bacon and eggs. 

"If don't eat your meat you will become meat." she said concerned. 

She ended with saying: "the others you met before are watching, you better eat up."

Unlike Amanda, Chloe's conviction towards ending meat was not out of desire, but survive.  

She had fallen into the same trap that I had two years ago. 

Once a broke college graduate desperately job hunting. Despite any lack of training she became the assistant for a local, big shot movie art director who lived in one of the same affluent hill mansions near the rich cannibals' country club. 

He himself a cannibal would forced her to embrace that lifestyle in exchange for allowing her to become an art director of our area's rather small independent film scene. 

She had made some questionable films definitely under their influence which had either references to the occult and or cannibalism usually expressed through metaphors or subtle hints.

Her addiction to human meat was like a bad drug. But I was helping her and himself to get off. 

We have move to the other side of the country to an arid, desert climate. 

Although we were able to detoxicate from cannibalism. We would get letters from the cult telling us to say silent.

I stayed silent for awhile as I was unsure how large the cannibal cult's influence was. 

Although, I believe now that it probably global. They had no problem reaching us. 

We lived peacefully for awhile. Taking in small jobs. Occasionally we felt we were getting dirty looking from passing strangers. 

Despite that we felt that we were safe, but we won't. 

One day, Chloe got into a car accident where she was bleeding. Although instead of going to the nearest hospital which was 35 minutes away the ambulance instead strangely went to the hospital two hours away.

 She did not make the trip and I felt by myself again.

I left the country and now live life on an abandoned barge in the middle of the Pacific Ocean that I am currently swatting. 

I am waiting for them to come and get me. It has been ten years seen the car accident.

 I wonder if they couldn't find me or if they know where I am and just want to watch me suffer.
