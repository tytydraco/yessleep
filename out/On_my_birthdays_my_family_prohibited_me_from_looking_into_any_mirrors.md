Ever since I was little, my family—my mom, dad, and sister—had one strict rule on my birthday:
I wasn’t allowed to look into any mirror.

No explanations. No answers. Just a house full of covered mirrors and vague warnings.

By the time I turned 16, I’d given up asking. My mom would always cover every mirror with white sheets before midnight and send me to bed early, like clockwork. I stopped trying to peek.

But that year... she forgot one.

It was just past 1 a.m. I’d gotten up to drink water and, half-asleep, turned on my phone’s flashlight. That’s when I saw it—the ornate oval mirror above the basin at the end of the dining room. Floral wooden spirals surrounded the frame. My mom had picked it out herself.

And she’d forgotten to cover it.

I didn’t mean to look. But my eyes landed on it—and I froze.

My reflection… wasn’t moving.

Even when I stepped back, it just stood there, staring. Every time I blinked, it seemed closer.

I wanted to run, but my legs were heavy. I couldn’t look away. My mind spiraled into panic. What if it crawled out when I look away?

I fumbled with my phone.

“Bixby... call sister.”

The seconds it took felt like an eternity. Finally, it rang.

“Hello—?”

“Sis, I saw a mirror! I'm in trouble!!”

There was a pause. Then, groggily:
“What the fu—”
“SISTER PLEASE WHAT DO I DO!?”

She hesitated.
“Did Mom never tell you what to do... if you ever looked?”

“No! She was shady about it! Dad avoids it! You’re my only hope!”

“...Alex. Look away.”

“What?! I can’t! Every time I look away it steps closer!”

“Alexander. LISTEN TO ME.” Her voice changed—firm, cold. “The more you stare, the more it learns. LOOK. AWAY.”

“But it’s moving—!”

“LOOK AWAY! LOOK AWAY—!”

Her yelling didn’t even sound human anymore. My stomach dropped. In panick I ended the call.

My hands were shaking. I was panicking, exhausted, and trying not to cry. I couldn't even blink. I almost turned my gaze when I heard a familiar voice. 

“Thank god you didn’t look away!”

I jumped. It was my sister—in person—standing in the doorway, holding a small mirror.

"Sister...? "

“Why did you stopped talking after said you looked at a mirror!" she asked.

 but I was talking to her... when I realized my guts were right... that voice at the end wasn't my sister...

She stepped sideways, holding the small mirror up to the big one—and it cracked, shattering into pieces.

My eyes widened as the glass shattered.
“What the—how??”

My sister stood still, catching her breath.
“I created a loop of infinite reflection,” she said quietly, holding up the small mirror.
“The reflection of you in this mirror is now trapped... for a while, at least. And-”

She leapt back and glared at me.

“Stupid!! Why did you look at it?!”

“I—I’m sorry!” I stammered, but she hugged me suddenly. Tight.

“If I wasn’t warned, it would’ve replaced you. Don’t look at any mirrors today. No matter what.”

I nodded, still trembling, hugging her back—

Then she whispered:
“Or you’ll end up like your sister. Stuck in the mirror.”

That sentence still haunts me.

Because after that night, she acted like her usual self. She never brought it up again.

And even now…
I’m not sure how long I can stay quiet...
Not when something feels wrong living with her under the same roof.
