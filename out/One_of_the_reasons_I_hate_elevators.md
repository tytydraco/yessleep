I was leaving the hospital from the 4th floor.  
There were 2 elevators that opened their doors.  
One had a hospital bed, some family and nurses  
The other a woman her 6 snotty children,  
One look at me and she clutched at her purse.  
I stepped back, looked at the stairs and considered  
Then I heard a soft ding, a 3rd elevator just opened.  
I stepped on hit the lobby, a gentle voice said "Going down"  
The doors closed then there was a lurch, a pitch and a fall,  
I felt myself pinned up against the wall  
Ya, we were going down, and down,  
Seriously, when did this building get this freaking tall!  
The doors opened, I swear I heard that voice chuckle,  
I jumped out, looked around.  
This was not my floor.  
The women in dresses with buttons and bows,  
Men in hats, ties and suit coats  
Me in jeans a t-shirt of my favorite band,  
Guessing not a lot of Dead Heads on hand?  
Everyone staring, a whisper, a shout,  
A blood stained doctor marched out.  
I spun around, the elevator was better by far,  
But there was no sign of an elevator, just a long hall.  
The whispers were louder, "Is that a boy or a girl?"  
"Whatever it is, It must be a whore"  
"It's a witch!" A man shouted with a pompous scowl,  
Well this took a bad turn, I ran toward the hall  
Then I saw it, a dumb waiter.Â  Hmm? Worth a shot..  
I opened the door and climbed in,  
it seemed much more spacious than it had before.  
I stood up to find the elevator doors,  
And the panel with all of the floors,  
I decided to try to start over again, I hit four.  
"Going up", the voice much less gentle than before.  
It pitched and it lurched like a rusty old rocket  
I felt like a fork in an electrical socket.  
The doors opened slowly,  
Oh ya, the voice chuckled, I heard it quite clearly.  
I stepped out, the floor it was dusty,  
It smelled old and musty,  
With a hint of wet pennies, well that's never good.  
Not a person in sight, not a sound, not a light,  
Just a sky that looked cloudy and grayer than gray.  
I stepped on some papers, some wrinkled up chart,  
I looked at the date October the 30th 2030,  
I walked to the window too dusty to see, I gave it a wipe  
The glass fell away with a tinkley, crash, and a smash  
The streets were all empty, the roads overgrown,  
The buildings were gutted, there wasn't a soul.  
Then I heard a buzz growing louder like a great fog of bees  
Then the shadows grew longer and headed toward me.  
There were things in those shadows I did not want to see!  
Back to the elevator, the doors were all broken,  
All that was there was impenatrable darkness,  
Seeing that I had no other choices,  
I closed my eyes and stepped, and felt the floor under my feet  
Then I opened them to see, I was back in the elevator  
Safe as can be, sort of, sort of not.  
I looked up at the ceiling with it's faceless voice  
"Surprise me!" I shouted,  
it whispered back "You must choose"  
I chose 2, maybe the middle was a good try?  
It moved down so smoothly I thought this was the end,  
Then the doors opened and another I was standing there.  
The other me shouted "Not again!" Then "Go! Go! Go!"  
I know better than to question myself.  
The elevator doors closed painfully slow.  
She put her hands on my shoulders and looked in my eyes  
What happened next is hard to describe  
It felt like tickle, then like a surge,  
It felt like a hug and a hammer  
Then somehow we merged,  
Now there was just one me there, I know it's absurd,  
But no more crazy than there being two.  
I had all of her memories and she had mine  
My mind it felt crowded as I thought the new thoughts  
We'd tried every floor, but hadn't found out.  
We tried it again, Or I did, it was just me now,  
3 was on fire, 2 had been flooded,  
With bodies just bobbing all bloated and gutted.  
4 the buzzing and shadows were there  
Just waiting for me, waiting for anything human that breathed  
The basement was bad, the morgue overflowed,  
A sea of people shaped sheets that weren't white anymore.  
We pressed the Lobby for the hundredth, thousandth, millionth time?  
It's hard to keep count, there are so many me's in my mind.  
The door opened, I was standing there, I grabbed me and yanked me right out, I felt that tickley surge,  
that hammery hug.  
I was free! We were free! All the we that was me. We, I stumbled away, the doors closed behind me  
Heard the elevator voice say "Have a good day"  
I ran out the front doors, I ran to my car,  
I soaked in the wind and the colors of Fall.  
No more elevators for me,  
I hear stairs are healthier anyway.  
But still late at night when the dreams keep me awake  
I think 2030 is not far away.
