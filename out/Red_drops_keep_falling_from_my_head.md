"Just don't drink or eat anything!" the lab technician in Ohio blurted with that weighty authority that meant, "I ain't fucking around here, Jack!"

"Is that it?" I asked incredulously.

"Well, that and I'd recommend a hyperbaric chamber. And maybe a priest. It's amazing you didn't die in Cleveland, Jack."

Yeah. Me and Howard the fucking Duck. Fucking toxicologists and their toxicology reports. Why didn't you tell me when it counted, Jack? Like two weeks ago. Fucking shitty coverage at my shitty job. Now it looks like my name is Drew cause I'm in the DOA queue.

It must have been those fucking spirulina smoothies. That bitch. Cyanide. Mother fuck a duck.

It all began a month ago with the headaches. Those were soon followed by chronic irritability and the jake leg. I chalked it all up to just another stressful week on my shitty consulting job until I experienced what I later found out was *vertigo*.

My job was high stress but only due to my psychotic manager. But that's enough. I once saw Miguel kick a chihuahua at lunch time then laugh. He thought nobody was around, but I was coming out of the pisser and saw the whole fucking thing. And it was at a company team building picnic no less.

Anyway, Vera wouldn't let me quit my shitty job. Vera Costigan was my wife. Vera and her daddy were worth, well she once put it like this, "more than God," but I didn't need that much to quit.

"Don't be a worm, Warren. A man needs to stand on his own two feet. I'll do me and you do you," she had once told me before she pulled away in her Bentley for another shopping spree at the Costigan Mall.

So, I kept chasing that paycheck. Vera was giving me a good discount she said but my share of the manse was just shy of four grand a month. That's a big enough nut that I didn't even push back when fate dealt me a hand almost worse than death. Emergency with a difficult client. Flying coach to Cleveland. Guess who?

Yeah, was it really just last month I was working late night in that shitty hotel room in Cleveland? I'm only from back east but one airline flight, uber and client meeting later and my psychotic manager, Miguel, was raging at me. Raging at me for not load testing a mobile solution I hobbled together fast and furiously under relentless pressure in my DMs. Then, in person.

"You can lose your job!" Miguel snarked as I looked at the big generic 503 message on my screen. "Maybe you should stay in the room until you figure out *your* mess."

I wanted to say, "Say it, don't spray it," but instead I tried to think what the issue could be. I only had to deal with a hundred users or so. That shouldn't have crashed anything.

"I TOLD YOU SO!!!!!!!" Miguel bellowed after the game.

Then I felt it all spin out of control and didn't know what happened until later when I came to on a gurney.

They kept me for observation and Vera flew to Ohio to be by my side. After a few days a doctor named Zugsmith told me I could go back home, and they'd be in touch. Vera flew me back to New York on her dad's private jet and she sure was swell to me once we were back home. I was back at work after a few days and even Miguel wasn't too, too much of a prick. For a few days anyway.

Then the new deadlines came from Javier, and he passed them on to Miguel emphasizing how he couldn't emphasize the *urgency* and of course one Miguel call later, I, too, felt the pressure.

I was settling in for a long night of toil. I was stressed and had that anxious Sunday night feeling in the pit of my stomach, but it was also noticeably different this time.

I was stress drinking these fucking chocolate superfoods smoothies Vera kept giving me because she said it was good for my nervous system and that it would help me harmonize with, "all the negativity I clearly was struggling and floundering with." Vera loved to tell me I was, "floundering."

That pendulum feeling in the pit of my stomach made me double over and say, "Gar."

This time it wasn't just my stomach, though. Evil rhythm was palpitating in my breast. I felt a beastly humidity in the air. Like there was an invisible silverback attack to the soundtrack of Gene Krupa on crack and it was all coming from under my hirsute chest.

I shook my head. I was a big boy. I was sipping an espresso with a scoop of vanilla ice cream Vera had brought me with a kiss an hour ago and I saw no reason to stop.

I had just stopped procrastinating with the weed pen hoping to quell my nausea. Speaking of nausea, a voice in my head cajoled; it was time to ***review specs*** I had printed out, spread like a losing poker hand across the folding Staple's table I used for a desk.

I was sipping caffeine and trying to make heads or tails of Miguel's schizophrenic ramblings and diagrams when the first spot suddenly appeared; crimson and angry too. It made a splash that settled into a chaotic floral imprint reminiscent of Jackson Pollock or King Crimson. Who gives a fuck?

Then another blood drop fell and settled into the same fractal Fibonacci stochastic portent. I recognized a pattern. A bad omen. A bad moon rising. It began looking like a bloody spirograph pattern.

"VERA!" I screamed. All I heard was my own voice echo through the empty manse.

The voice in my head said, "The first time could be coincidence. The second time is a pattern. Third time? Enemy attack, son. Enemy attack."

Then my phone rang and my hallucination that looked like Sterling Hayden evaporated. I snuffed some bloody pulpy stuff that gave me postnasal pause.

The phone kept ringing.

More blood came out but maybe a bit faster this time. I heard a strange buzzing in my ears. It crystalized into a sound like, "company town". I heard my teeth grinding without leave.

The phone wouldn't stop ringing.

I answered. It was Vera.

"Vera?!? I thought you were in the hou-"

"It's Daddy's town," Vera said over me with no preamble or context.

"We Costigan's own this town, dope. We run everything from the police to the town council to the cell phone towers. I told you Daddy diversified away from arms. That's so war on terror. So yesterday. So," Vera's voice sounded like someone looks when they make vague Italian gestures. "So, you, Warren." She said my name like it was a dirty word.

I wiped some blood away from my mouth and chin. Some slid in between my lips. It was salty like tears.

"What are you saying, Vera?" I asked, panic putting an arm around my shoulder that said, "I'm not here to reassure you."

"You're such a dope, Warren. I just needed a patsy to get out of a marriage without jeopardizing Daddy's deal with Harvey and Abdul. And there you were. All doe eyed and butt hurt divorced by that floozy whatizname."

I wiped some more blood away. Then some more.

"You'll never get away with it, Vera. They have the report. Cyanide. That's Cleveland. Not Costigan's Bluff. They didn't know how I got it, but I knew it was you. I just don't know why."

"Warren, you worm. You're baggage that's out of style. I hate divorces. Being a widow, now that's really what makes me happy. I just really want you gone, and I don't want to pay you one thin dime you worm."

"You bitch. I'll call the FBI. I'll go to the press. Reddit!

"No, you won't. Those reports out of Cleveland. Daddy's people are already on it. That lab technician is toast along with his so-called records. Who's going to miss Warren the Worm? Who? Who's going to ask questions? You were nervous. A pansy. A heart attack kid and-"

I was up on my hind legs. I would drive to the next town. I ran out of the house, but I never made it past the front door. It was stuck.

I ran to the back sliders. And there they were.

A pack of snarling German shepherds. Must have been a dozen. And they all looked at me and licked their chops.

"The doors are locked from the outside, so you won't be going anywhere soon. And your IP is now blocked from the outside world. Any last words, worm?"

"Bullshit."

"No bullshit. You're like North Korea. You're fucking sealed in my town. My rules. I'm GOD, Warren. You gotta sing a sad song now wormsy. Now, now you worm, get hip to the click."

The call ended. I bled some more. I tried to call the police, 911, everything but all my calls are getting blocked. I think they hacked my phone. Those dirty Costigans. This dirty company town. This sleep might be the big one.
