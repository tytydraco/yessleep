I don't know where to start. My name is Gabriel, or at least it was. If anyone from my past is reading this, they probably think I'm dead. Maybe I am. After what I lived through, the line between being alive and being a monster is very thin.

It all started with a scream in the dark. A high-pitched scream that cut through the night and then... silence. I woke up with a taste of iron in my mouth, like I'd bitten my tongue, but worse. It was dark, damp. The sound of dripping water was my only company, besides the chains on my wrists. The cell was tiny, the size of a shipping container. The kind of place where you can scream until your lungs give out, and no one will hear you.

But *someone* was watching me. I could feel it.

In the first "days" (if you could even call them that), I realized I wasn't alone. There were others. Murmurs in the corridors, insane laughter that sounded like it was from a horror movie, and the smell... my God, the smell of raw and rotten meat. Someone was eating something they shouldn't.

I met a guy, André. He whispered through a crack in the wall. He said we were lab rats. "They take people no one will look for," he said. "The homeless, illegal immigrants, addicts... They test how long it takes for us to turn into animals." He laughed, a laugh with no joy, just pure desperation. Hours later, I heard his teeth tearing into something they threw into his cell. He cried while he ate.

I learned quickly that trust was a death sentence. There was a traitor among us. Marina tried to organize an escape. I almost joined her, but something held me back. Three days later, she came back. But it wasn't Marina anymore. Her eyes were empty, like a doll's. She walked like the guards. Some of us had already become *theirs*.

When they took me to the Room, I thought it was the end. Two guards with gas masks, the old-fashioned kind that make a noise when they breathe. They strapped me to a chair. There were scalpels, saws... but they didn't touch me. Instead, they turned on a projector.

And then I saw my mother. In our kitchen, drinking coffee. So normal... until she turned her head. Her eyes were black holes, leaking something that wasn't tears. Her mouth opened in an impossible way and she screamed. A voice from a loudspeaker said, "You abandoned her. You knew she was sick. You ran away."

It was a lie. It had to be. But after hours of that, with the chains forcing me to watch everyone I ever loved being tortured and blaming me... part of me started to believe it.

Time lost all meaning. I wasted away to bone. My hair fell out. I started talking to myself. One night, I woke up with a piece of warm meat in my hand. I don't know where it came from. I don't know what it was. I ate it. And I cried while I ate. I wished for more.

That's when the man in the next cell made me an offer. "I can get you out of here," he said. In exchange for information. In exchange for betraying the others. I felt disgusted. But also... tempted.

Until I discovered the truth. A tiny camera, hidden in the mold. There were several. They weren't just watching us. They were *filming* us. This was entertainment. A snuff show for rich people. I wasn't a prisoner. I was an actor.

The chance to escape came when a guard left the door open for three seconds. I grabbed his head and smashed it against the wall. I felt pleasure. That scared me, but I was beyond fear.

I led a revolt. Dozens of us, skeletal and bloodied, massacred the guards. It was brutal. Inhuman. Until we reached the final door.

It was a huge room, with a giant mirror covering the wall.

And we saw.

Monsters. Mutilated faces, destroyed bodies, humanity erased. Someone started screaming. Marina (or what was left of her) cut her own throat. Others followed. A mass suicide. Seeing themselves was the final torture.

I stood still, looking at my reflection. Was that still me in there?

That's when the guards came back. And they took off their masks.

It was André. Marina. The man with the offer. All of them. Prisoners who had become executioners to survive.

"Sorry," André whispered, as he handcuffed me again. "It's you or me."

I didn't fight back. I just laughed.

And then the lights came on. Behind the "mirror"—which was just one-way glass—was the audience. Men in suits, women in dresses, champagne... applauding. As if it were a play.

When the scalpel finally cut, I thanked them. Because it was over.

Or maybe it wasn't.

You can never really know in The Colony.
