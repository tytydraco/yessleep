It’s a common practice in the food industry – at least where I work – to not do your job perfectly. Just well enough that the customers don’t complain. At the same time, it’s easy for your subjective opinion of “good enough” to be skewed over time.

When I noticed the small, oblong black dots clustered in the strip of salmon I was filleting – I didn’t mention it to anyone. I looked at it, I took a slice between my fingers, I held it up to light… then excised with a pocketknife all parts where it was visible in the meat.

I work in a sushi restaurant. I’m a kitchen assistant. I make minimum wage, and work long hours. On this particular confinement, I was working a twelve-hour shift in the cramped, fluorescently lit back room.

We had started to exhaust our supply of prepared salmon. If we had been dealing with a rush of orders that would have been normal. But the reason we were almost out? Incompetence. It was another chef’s job and they had been taking their time. It wasn’t my problem and I didn’t care to make it mine. All I had to do was ride out the last few hours of my shift in the back room, trying to look busy.

“Brent,” someone called from behind me. I bit the inside of my cheek. I turned behind me to see Mack, standing in the kitchen doorway. He wore a black facemask, white hairnet, and the company uniform – black. His mask was pulled down, his disgusting, wiry stubble poking out of his oily chin like quills. He stared at me without expression, though I knew he was mocking me.

“We’re almost out of salmon,” he said.  
Now, it was my problem.

As I entered the kitchen, I situated myself at a chopping board shoved into a corner. Hints of spotted black mold saturated the walls and floor, but we called it sterile. Mack had been working here and was halfway finished before he abandoned his task and gave it to me.

I made one cut into the salmon when I saw them. Small, black dots.

They were arranged into clusters, thinning in quantity around the edges before another cluster began. Dots small enough to be considered dust, and at first I thought it was just that. My fingers brushed over the top of the meat. It had no effect on the clusters, which I now knew to be embedded inside.

My options were either notifying my boss or making do. I usually made do; it’s just standard practice. I tried – as best as I could – to trim off the sections of meat infested with the spheres. I remained with about six slices of fish, which would be free of the contaminant.

I layered the bottom of a small plastic bowl with paper towels and grabbed the first slice of salmon. The six slices of meat landed in the bowl with a soft smack. I clicked the lid into place, lifted the bowl, and carried it off to the line.

Trish was our supervisor for the day. She stood in a corner of the kitchen, rubbing her thumb on her cheek. Her facemask dangled off her ear, and her curly blonde hair was messily tucked into her hairnet. Her eyes traced over me as I set the container down. They had a way of roaming over me.

I set it in front of Mack so that he knew that I did what he asked of me.  
“Should’ve had that done ten minutes ago. I don’t know why you keep closing the bowls, you know I need to check it,” Mack said, clicking open the container. He took a morsel between his fingers and held it up to the light. “These are really sloppy.” The idiot did not know the state I had found them in, with what precision I trimmed the soft, firm meat.

Mack made a sushi roll with the salmon.  
I knew he was making it for himself because there were no tickets in the kitchen. I watched without comment as he arranged the sushi in a plastic container. I didn’t warn him when he clocked out for his break.

The motherfucker had pulled me off what I was doing to make him his lunch. The uncovered bowl remained on the work-station, the meat glistening as it caught the light.  
Were the remaining slices really clean?

I raised a slice of salmon to eye level. There were no discrepancies on the surface of the meat. I took it between my forefinger and thumb and squeezed. Though there was nothing visible on the disfigured meat’s surface, I could feel something hard under the surface. It felt very rough, like a tight bag of marbles.

There was another thing within me, little black dots of my own – dark spots of evil within my heart. I’ve been in bed with the sentiment all my life – I am not truly clean. I’ve been saying “dots” up until this point, though I knew well what I was looking at.  
Eggs.  
And I was protective.

The feeling horrified me at first – the pride I felt when I put the bowl of salmon into the freezer. How would this affect our productivity?  
Would they even know it was me?

I caught Trish’s gaze, still watching silently from the kitchen corner. Her eyes were weary but always had a subtle way of lighting up when they ran over my body.

I made myself comfortable at her side. She stood a few inches taller than me, still rubbing her thumb along her cheek.

“Having a good shift?” Trish chuckled, knowing full well that I wasn’t. Nobody is having a good shift during the last couple hours of a double. I knew she especially wasn’t. Her expression was friendly, as usual, but I could see her pupils were contracted. Her posture ever so subtly jittery.

We were at a party the night before and Trish had been a sight to behold. Arms long and bare. Her legs stretching from beneath a short black skirt, a headband sitting on her long, dark hair. What I saw now was a shell of that deity, tired and restless. If I was being honest, the main thing that made me admire her where I disliked Mack – she was pretty.

Trish knew how to party too. She was drinking herself into a hole last night, even though she knew she would be on her feet for twelve hours the next day. She came to work hungover. Judging by her eyes, by her posture, by her frequent bathroom breaks and her sniffling – she was coping with it using less-than-moral means.  
At the end of the day, she got through it.

I admired Trish for that, but I don’t know why she tolerated me the way she did. Every friend I have had has abruptly cut ties with me at some point or the other. At some point, it felt, they would see something undeniably abhorrent lurking under my skin. I would wonder – through lethargic days – what exactly had tipped them off.  
And every time, I would find something new to dislike in the mirror.

“I’m having a good shift,” I smiled at her. I’ve never been told I have the prettiest smile, but something about Trish made me comfortable. “Did you see that?”

Trish didn’t direct her attention to me. She kept looking out into the now empty kitchen. Her hand fell from her cheek and she crossed her arms. She chewed the inside of her cheek.  
“I’m guessing Mack made something to eat?”

I nodded, “Pulled me off what I was doing just to cut salmon, just for him.”

Trish laughed. “Well, he’s a special boy. Can’t be so harsh on him.”

“Special is one word for it.”

And at the end of the night, before we closed, before Trish would take me to the utility closet to tell me that I was beautiful, Mack said he was sorry.

We were sitting on the floor next to the register when he started. The moon hung bright in the night sky, sending its rays through the window and onto Mack’s face. “Brent,” he said. And to me, the apology was already over. “I’m sorry about earlier. It’s just—working a double, we’re all tired. I should’ve cut the salmon myself. In the moment, I just couldn’t be bothered.”

I smiled, I nodded, “It’s alright. I understand.”  
Scumbag.

After the shift, I savoured the few hours I had to myself, then went to sleep to begin the cycle again. I woke up to the beginning of birdsong, put on my uniform, and drove to work.

At times, I did enjoy it – when the kitchen felt like a tight ship, when I felt like my work mattered. Those times had become more and more few and far between. Even when we worked like a well-oiled machine, I was reminded of my disdain for the people around me. I know that being self-aware doesn’t excuse me, but I think on some level – I wanted to see them hurt.

The restaurant sits in the midst of a shopping plaza, between a trendy clothing store and a clockmaker. In front of the restaurant was a large parking lot, with far more parking spaces than the run-down plaza could have needed, even in its heyday.

Apparently, when it was built, the owner had intended to make a large expansion. However, the plaza never really had much business. It wasn’t for a lack of trying. The plaza had extensive marketing, as well as its fair share of workshops and festivals. No matter how hard they tried, the plaza would see maybe fifty visitors in a week, and rumors began to float around that it was cursed.

The owner – whoever they were – their dreams of a broad, extensive shopping plaza were thrown to the wolves. SushiFresh was one of few stores still in operation there.

When I pulled into the parking lot that day, I noticed several off-white vans parked to the outer edge of the lot. I remember thinking that it was strange. It would have been the most people I had seen at the plaza in a long time.

I clocked in to work that day almost excited. Maybe all those people would decide to buy sushi, and we’d be occupied enough that I wouldn’t have to spend time talking to my coworkers or trying to look busy.

Trish was in the same spot I had seen her the day before, just after the front desk. She looked notably less energetic – irritated. Still, her eyes lit up when she saw me. I didn’t know how to feel.

Trish smiled at me, “Good to see you clock in today.” She gestured towards the backroom, further toward the bathroom. It was small, only one stall and a sink. “Mack’s in there. Seems under the weather today. You’ll be on the line.”

I found one order waiting for me. It was a Firework roll, requiring seared salmon, cream cheese and cucumbers. There was cream cheese and cucumbers already taken out. All I had to do was get the frozen salmon from the freezer.  
The frozen salmon which I suspected to be contaminated.

Trish watched me head to Mack’s spot, grabbing at his knife and bamboo board. He would have thrown a fit, but he was too occupied shitting his guts out. Maybe food poisoning really had taken him. Ha! Serves him right.

Trish’s eyes were following my every move. My shoulders, to my elbows, to my hands, to my fingertips. I was nervous. Trish was never unkind to me, never hostile. Still, I saw her expression when I came in today. Maybe she was dreading the second I’d push open the front door.

Coughing, from the bathroom.  
I uncovered the bowl of salmon. To the naked eye, inscrutable. To the sickly black tar that had nested in my heart? A resonance was found. I reached into the bowl, taking a thick slice of salmon between my index and thumb. The meat was slimy yet firm in my hand. It was like holding someone’s tongue. I could’ve sworn that I felt it pulse and throb, like a still-beating heart.

Wet coughing, from the bathroom. A small plastic object – maybe a bottle of soap – clattered to the floor.  
The stove had already been turned on, and waiting on top, a pan slicked with oil. The pan was already scorching, just waiting for something to be thrown in and seared.

A loud clatter, from the bathroom. It sounded more like Mack had fallen over. Trish broke her scrutiny of my actions to turn her head towards the noise.

I threw the salmon into the pan. Yes, there was the expected hiss of the meat searing – but beyond that, a sound not dissimilar from metal grinding against metal. Loud enough to obfuscate the hiss. A screech.

Many, many brown, shrimp-like insects burrowed out of the salmon. Long, needle-like antennae extended from their bulbous heads, and a single red stripe bisected their exoskeleton. They leaped from out the pan and skittered onto the walls in such quantity that it seemed impossible that just seconds before, they had been packed into the small slice of salmon. Their number was easily in the hundreds.

Trish’s head whipped around, and she shrieked as she saw the pandemonium of bugs swarming into the corners of the room. She backpedaled from the stove, swatting frantically at her arms and legs as the insects pounced from the walls and ran up her sleeves. One of the bugs made it all the way to her neck before it was crushed, leaving a reddish-brown stain.

“What the fuck!” I yelled. I looked to Trish for direction, and for a moment, she was paralyzed. I could see the fear, shock, and disgust in her eyes, shortly before she regained her composure. I had seen fear in the eyes of many of those I held dear.

And for a brief moment, it was cathartic to know that she was no different.  
Though she had looked at me with hungry eyes before, I knew she had seen something that wasn’t truly there. Now, she had seen proper.

“I—I need to make a call,” she stuttered. “Have the day off, I gotta get our pest control guy down here.” Trish threw open the sliding door and stepped out to the front desk, then tapped – with shaky hands – a number into our landline telephone.

Mack was still in the bathroom. Though the infestation was disgusting, he would be fine when he got out. Truth be told, I was happy to have the day off. I would have even sat among the bugs if it meant I could rest.

Several beams of light shot onto my chest the second I stepped out of the restaurant. Several people had emerged from the off-white trucks parked in a half-assed circle in the lot, and were now shining laser pointers at me.

“Get back into the restaurant!” a voice boomed from one of the vans.  
It only took me a second to realize what was happening. I had no plans of getting shot – the croaky voice startled me enough that I dived back into SushiFresh. Still, I can’t deny the frustration I felt. I wanted to clock out and go home.

Trish stared at me, then out the front glass. She put the landline back on the hook, slowly. Then pinched the bridge of her nose.

“This complex is being put under quarantine. You will remain in the nearest building until told otherwise!”  
Trish cursed under her breath.

I said, “Is the pest control guy on his way?”

She responded, “That’s them.” Trish reached into the front pocket of her apron to retrieve a shitty disposable vape. She took a long drag. “They’re always so fucking dramatic. Management insists on them. ‘90% success rate’.”

The sliding door to the kitchen remained closed, leaving no sign of the pandemonium of skittering insects in the room beyond. Trish followed my gaze.  
“Mack’s still in the bathroom?” I asked.

Trish nodded, “See if you can get him out here.”

The scene in the kitchen had only gotten worse. When the bugs lurking in the meat made their exodus, it set off a chain reaction in the pantry. They came creeping along every surface in the kitchen. They came from our coolers, our cupboards. Our pipes, our vents and our dreams.

The vent was always the loudest sound in the kitchen. A heavy, droning whir present almost at all times. Now, below the ambience I could make out a soft, yet wide clicking that seemed to come from everywhere. Below that, at the edge of my perception, I could hear their wailing.

They cried, they sang. It was a song inlaid with the sorrows of a musician who knew it well – they were lonely. It wasn’t their fault. They were born on the stove of a dirty kitchen, and I had given them the neglect necessary for it to happen. It was my fault. Yet I somehow felt that they deserved my scorn.  
Yes! I was revolted. I dry-heaved in my mask as I shut the door behind me. Even so, I cannot in good conscience say that revulsion was all I felt, even as I type this from my hospital bed.

My heart pounded in my chest as I pushed past the stove and headed toward the toilet. I tugged the door handle and pushed it open with a creak. Inside, the light flickered, illuminating toppled buckets and mops. A bottle of bleach had fallen and come open, spilled on the floor.

Mack stood facing away from me and towards the sink, deathly still. He must not have heard me open the door. “Mack! You need to come to the front. There’s an infestation of…” I trailed off.

Behind me, I could still hear the swarm chittering and clicking, climbing and leaping, hissing and sobbing. Mack was motionless, his knuckles white as he gripped the edges of the sink.

“Mack…?” I whispered. I took a step closer, resting a hand on his shoulder. As soon as I did so, his body twitched, and I recoiled backwards. He spun around and faced me.

Mack’s throat had burst through his own sternum and folded in on itself, erupting from his neck like a tangled ribbon. The soft, red rope of his GI tract was torn open. It spilled half-chewed food and bile onto the floor, which mixed with the bleach he had knocked over. A slow, steady drip of half-processed waste.

The damage was not relegated to his throat. His tongue had bloated into the kind of thing you’d tie a balloon animal with. It hung limply on his chin and puffed out his cheeks as it bloated almost all of the space in his mouth. Mack’s eyes bulged from their sockets. Pulsing, throbbing. They were bloodshot and crazed, yet behind them I could sense a heartbreaking pain.

Crawling from his torn GI tract, biting and hanging onto his face just like the stubble I so despised, were the same stiff-jointed insects that were infesting our pantry.  
And I was satisfied.

What could have made me hate him that much? Mack was never intentionally hostile. I had never confronted him about how much he bothered me. I know the reason for this well – I am a coward. I never saw a need to talk to him directly. Everyone is allowed their petty grudges.

I was satisfied. I was horrified. No matter how much I may have hated Mack, the sheer state he was in – his throat hanging out of his neck, his tongue about to pop – sent a cold shock through my system. He stumbled towards me. Whether he intended to do me harm or seek help, I do not know.

I jolted backwards, tripped over the raised step at the toilet’s entrance, and collided with a rack of utensils. Pots, bowls and covers crashed to the floor. I hit the back of my head on the rack, and had the wind knocked out of me.

There was no time to hurt. Breathless, I shot to my feet. Mack continued to stumble towards me, his arms outstretched and constricting and crawling with bugs. I backed up, trying to put as much distance between us as I could manage in the cramped kitchen.

Mack stopped moving. Then, he began to convulse. The piece of his throat that hung outside of his neck made a noise like a balloon deflating, the expulsion couldn't find its way to his stuffed mouth. A wet mass of the brown insects wriggled its way out of his torn throat, splattering against the floor with a damp smack. I could see every mass bulging within his GI tract before it came out.

By now, Trish had heard the commotion. She slid the door to the front open and came into the kitchen probably not knowing what to expect. The pantry was already swarming, and I imagine she had steeled herself before entering. But now she was face to face with me and Mack. Or what remained of him.

Mack vomited clump after clump of writhing brown bugs onto the moist kitchen floor. The newborns in each clump, once fallen, would remain stunned for a moment, then right themselves and skitter away as Mack’s eyes promised to pop out of his face with every mass dripping out of his throat.

Trish stared in horror, tears running down her cheeks. Her hands covered her mouth while she surely tried to settle her own stomach. Seizing the moment, I ran to her, took her by the hand, and led her to the utility closet. Just like she had led me so many times before.

The next few minutes have been on my mind ever since I woke up.  
The utility closet was where we kept most of our non-reusable kitchen supplies. Takeout boxes and chopsticks, detergent and sponges. Aside from a few stragglers that crawled through the cracks of the door, it was still sterile – by our standards.

Trish was slumped against the door, and I, right next to her. I could almost pretend that it was time to close the store. We had just finished for the night, and Trish was about to leave.  
With every crash and retch in the kitchen behind us, I knew that it was no such night.

Trish was taking deep breaths. In… out… in… out. She looked almost as helpless as I was, with her knees tight against her chest.  
“What the fuck happened?” she choked out.

“I don’t know! He was in the bathroom,” I replied.  
My hands found the soft fabric of my right pocket, and retrieved my knife. I depressed a button on the side. The blade traced a perfect semi-circle in the air, then clicked into place. Its edge was razor sharp, the grip already slick with sweat.

To leave the restaurant, we would need to leave the closet – we would need to find a way past Mack. Either way, I don’t know what I planned to do with the knife. If I had to get that close to Mack, then there was no doubt some of the bugs would find their way back to me. I shouldn’t have taken it out of my pocket at all.

“Well, he looked fine when he came in today,” Trish choked a sob back.  
For a moment, the air hung still. Trish eyed my knife.

Another crash rattled its way through the spaces in the door. Mack had, in his pain-blind rampage, pulled a shelf to the ground. Some cups clattered to the floor, some broke on impact – a sharp, ear-piercing noise. Mack wailed.

My heart skipped a beat. “I don’t know what you’re trying to say.”  
But I saw the black clusters lurking in the meat.

“It was just an observation; I’m not trying to say anything.”  
And how silent I was.

“Do you think this is my fault?” my voice was a whisper, guilty and withdrawn.  
I had to know this would happen, and I let it.

“What? Why would it be your fault?” Trish spat.  
My knuckles were white with exertion. I was a helpless little girl, clutching my last, selfish hope of making it out alive. All of this was my fault.

She shouldn’t know that.

“What did you do?” Trish’s eyes were manic now. I recognized them from every time I had gone drinking with her. This was a deity restored. Trish stopped her panicked breath, and a calm fell over her. She was deathly silent as she pushed me against the door, and straddled me.  
Her hands were a vice around my neck. Her nails dug into my skin as she showed me the hatred I always knew she harbored for me. And it was saccharine sweet.

“I couldn’t have known,” I sobbed. “Get off of me."  
I raised the knife, pressing its blade against Trish’s neck. “It wasn’t my fault. Say it.”  
The knife bit into her neck; razor-sharp, as I’ve said. The slightest pressure sent blood crawling down her skin. I looked into her eyes, they accused me – damned me – between my own pathetic strangled sobs and stolen breath.

“Say it!”

Trish grinned. “It’s not your fault.”  
Her grip on my throat tightened.

The blade carved through Trish’s throat like fish meat. A torrent of bright crimson fluid poured from her throat as Trish gurgled. Have you ever heard someone suffocate to death? Living creatures do not go quietly. They go fighting.

But Trish did not hit me. She did not fight. She made no effort to keep the blood from leaking out of her. She poured the last drops of her strength into her chokehold, her nails drawing blood from my own neck. I felt her grip leave her as her blood stained the blade, the floor, my clothes, and my conscience. Through teary eyes, I could see her smug smile fade, and the light leave her.

And it felt good.

I pushed the corpse off of me. It was human no longer, nor divine. Now, it was nothing but meat. I left it for the bugs. They would have me as well.

I don’t know what I did after I left the closet. I woke up in the hospital with several new holes in my body, shot five times while trying to leave.

SushiFresh was reduced to a brittle mess of ash and soot. Or so I was told. Either way, I’m out of a job.

The doctors here are nice, though I’ve always hated hospitals. I’ve received a handful of visits from members of the pest control team. They asked for my side of events. It was made known to me that silence was not an option.

And I lied through my teeth, lying back in my bed, under the influence of several painkillers. I told them Trish never came to work that day. I never noticed any contamination in the kitchen or in any supplies used.

At nights, I am occasionally roused by a dull, pulsing pain in the holes that run through my legs and torso. It feels like it spreads through more and more of my body as the nights crawl by. Sometimes, I can feel tickling under the bandages – under my skin.  
I just need someone to tell me it wasn’t my fault. I did my best. I’m sorry.
