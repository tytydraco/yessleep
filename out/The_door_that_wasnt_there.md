The first time I reached for it, my legs refused. 

My feet were traitors, rooted to the rug while my arm stretched forward like it belonged to someone else. The door just… sat there. At the end of the hall. Wrong color, wrong height, wrong in a way I couldn’t explain. 

It wasn’t always there. That’s the worst part. Some nights my apartment looked normal. Just a two-bedroom I’d overpaid for in a city that eats people alive. But every now and then, when the lights hummed a little too loud or the silence pressed in heavy, the door appeared. 

And when it appeared, the whole place felt off. The air went stale, like the apartment hadn’t been lived in for decades. My walls seemed closer. My phone screen dimmer. Even my own reflection in the black of the TV looked slightly delayed, like it was waiting for me to notice. That night, I did notice. And I tried to walk closer. 

But my body rebelled. My legs shook so violently I thought I might collapse. My chest locked, every breath jagged. Pushing forward felt like leaning into a gale-force wind that wasn’t there. My mind screamed at me: Go inside. Just see. Just one step closer. But my body shook and locked, and all I could do was stare. 

The door wasn’t special to look at. White paint, plain brass knob. If you’d walked in without context, you’d think it had always been part of the place. But I’d lived here for months. I knew every scratch, every loose tile, every crack in the ceiling. There was never a door at the end of that hallway. 

And still, part of me wanted to touch it. I don’t know how long I stood there. My teeth chattered like it was January, but sweat slid down my back. At some point I blinked, and the hallway was empty again. Just smooth wall where the door had been. I didn’t sleep that night. The next few nights, I couldn’t sleep. 

I kept checking the hallway every hour, convinced I’d wake up to find the door again, and every hour I did, empty walls, silence, normality. But I could feel it. Somewhere behind the walls, the floorboards, the air. A weight pressing against the ordinary. It returned on the fourth night. 

This time, it lingered longer. Far longer than before. My apartment smelled wrong immediately, metallic, damp, like something had been rotting in a sealed room for decades. My furniture felt… wrong, too. The couch sagged in places it had never sagged. The rug seemed stretched, uneven, a little darker than I remembered. I could hear it before I saw it. A faint hum, almost musical, rising from the hallway. Like the building itself had started vibrating. 

I told myself to stop. Don’t go near it. Just let it be. But my mind wouldn’t listen. I walked down the hall again. My legs quivered violently, the muscles refusing to cooperate. My heartbeat thundered in my ears, my chest tightening until every breath was a struggle. Every inch closer felt like moving through water. And yet, my hand reached forward. My eyes fixed on that white rectangle, that impossible doorway that had no business being there. 

The doorknob moved again. A tiny click, barely audible. My stomach knotted as if the air itself had tied a rope around me. The room beyond the crack was darker than it should have been. A corner of a shadow, a faint gleam of something reflective. But it didn’t matter. My brain wanted in. My body screamed no. I froze, shaking, sweat and tears dripping onto the hardwood. My apartment returned to normal. No door. No sound. Nothing. But in the silence that followed, I could still hear the faint echo of a breath. 

By the end of the week, the door had become a regular visitor. Not predictable — it never stayed long enough for me to time it — but long enough that I could feel it coming. Sometimes it appeared while I was cooking, the smell of burnt toast suddenly mingling with that metallic, damp scent. Sometimes I caught it out of the corner of my eye while scrolling through my phone. 

Every time, the apartment betrayed me. Furniture shifted subtly. Floorboards creaked in ways I knew they shouldn’t. Shadows pooled in corners that had never existed before. 

I tried documenting it. Photos, videos, timestamps. Every evidence came out blank, the hallway smooth and normal. The door wasn’t there when I showed anyone. They smiled, shrugged, called it stress. 

I didn’t sleep. When the door appeared, I would hear whispers — faint, unintelligible at first, then my name, repeated over and over in low, almost musical tones. The vibrations ran through my body, making my legs tremble and my knees lock. My chest constricted, my lungs burned, and my hands shook uncontrollably. But my mind… my mind wanted it. 

One night, I forced myself toward it again. Each step was agony — muscles burning, joints locked, feet dragging. My fingers grazed the frame, and the world shifted. Lights flickered violently. Floorboards groaned beneath me. Walls leaned in, watching. Then I felt it, a pull. Deep, insistent, like gravity had been rewritten. My body wanted to retreat, my knees screaming to collapse, but my mind surged forward, dragging me toward that impossible room. 

Through the crack, I saw it. Not much, just darkness. Shapes moved inside, folding over themselves, stretching impossibly. Shadows pooled along the corners, thick and wet, like oil. Light bent in ways that should have been impossible. I felt… seen. Watched. Evaluated. 

And then the doorknob turned. Slowly. Deliberately. Clicking as if inviting me in. I fell to my knees. My mind screamed, my body shook, my chest ached. And still… I wanted in. It was the fourth night in a row. The door appeared earlier than ever before, a thin rectangle at the end of the hall, the white paint almost glowing in the dim apartment light. My legs locked. My chest tightened. My mind screamed at me to step closer. 

But my body refused. Or at least, it tried. Each movement was agony. My knees buckled. My arms trembled violently, useless. Even my fingers itched with pain as if every nerve were warning me off. And yet, somehow, I kept inching forward. Step by excruciating step. The apartment warped around me. Floorboards bent under unseen weight, furniture groaned, even the walls leaned forward as if watching. 

The whispers started again. Not my name this time — words almost familiar, but wrong. Each syllable pressed against my skull, my chest, my stomach. Come. Touch. Step inside. I could see more through the crack than ever before. Shapes moved, twisting, folding, alive but wrong. Shadows pooled along corners like oil. Light bent unnaturally. I felt seen. Watched. Evaluated. The doorknob moved. My chest burned. My lungs protested. My muscles screamed. And still, I wanted in. 

I don’t remember how long I stood there. Seconds, minutes, hours — time had lost meaning. The door waited, patient and relentless, pulsing like a heartbeat I could feel in my own chest. My legs trembled. My chest heaved. My fingers brushed the frame again, and the pulse of the room shot up my arms like liquid fire. I wanted to step back. I tried. But the pull was stronger. 

The shapes inside, twisting, folding, alive, seemed to reach toward me. Shadows clawed at the floor, walls, and corners of my vision. The apartment warped. The rug buckled under invisible feet. The couch tilted. The walls leaned. My mind bent, slipping. Every nerve, every muscle, every thought was consumed by the pull. I wanted to fight it, to resist, to run, but my body wasn’t mine anymore. 

I wanted it to win. The door opened fully this time. Not wide, just enough to show the room beyond. Inside… I caught a glimpse of myself. Or someone like me. Half-formed, twisting, stretching into shadows, standing in a strange glow that didn’t belong to this world. It mirrored me, beckoned me, whispered in ways I could feel rather than hear. I froze. My mind screamed. My body shook. My chest ached. And yet… I wanted to step in. 

I didn’t. Or at least, not entirely. The next moment, I was on the floor, gasping. The door was gone, the apartment normal again. But something had followed me back. The air was heavier. Shadows lingered too long. And in the kitchen, my reflection in the dark window blinked a second too late. I know it’s still there. Waiting. And every night, I feel it calling me. 

Calling me toward the hallway. Toward the door that might not exist for anyone else. Toward the place where my body refuses to move but my mind wants to go. I don’t know how long I can resist. But I also don’t think I want to.
