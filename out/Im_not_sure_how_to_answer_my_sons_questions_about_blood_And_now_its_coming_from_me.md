I heard that Jeffrey’s dad caught his kid with porn.

I envy Jeffrey’s dad.

[I caught *my* kid performing some kind of a Satanic ritual](https://redd.it/18cv6rj). Actually, I don’t know the difference among Satanic, demonic, Pagan, ASMR, or occult. The important fact is that I came away with deep claw wounds in my chest that burn when I cross the “bloodmark,” and my house suddenly turned dark and freezing. 

When he was younger, Damien walked in on his mother and me performing a Nasty Salamander on each other. I think that might have knocked him off-track.

At any rate, there we were, watching our breaths mist up in the middle of our living room, having been just locked into our home by an unseen creature who now stood guard at our front door. 

I took a deep breath and tried to find a way to communicate with my son. He needed to understand the urgency of the situation, but also know that I was coming from a place of love while constructively criticizing his choices.

“The fuck did you fucking do, you little shitfuck?” 

Fear has a way of translating my intended speech, and I could affirm without any doubt that I was experiencing the greatest terror of my life in that moment.

“Father,” he interrupted, “we need to act now. Please trust me.” He stared up at me with a surgeon’s eyes, and I shuttered at my own son. 

“Oh no,” I whispered, “you’ve *lost* whatever privileges you used to conjure this thing-”

“FATHER!”

I stood aghast at his interruption. 

“Do you really believe that I conjured this beast?”

I cocked my head. “Well *I* certainly wasn’t the one playing with blood at midnight, Damien!”

“That was needed for the *protection* spell,” he answered, frustration etched in his voice. “How long do you think you would have lasted without it?”

I folded my arms. “I’ve lasted my entire adult *life*, Damien!”

He gritted his teeth. “And how long do you think I’ve been casting spells in your sleep?” 

The icy chill ran down my spine, circled my gut, and fell asleep in my colon. “I don’t know, Damien? Do I *want* to know?”

He shook his head. “Probably not.” Sighing, he bent down and removed a hidden panel from the floor.

“How long has that been there, and how do you know about it?” I demanded. 

“We’re not going to get anything done if you’re this distracted by the light questions,” he answered.

I stared in shock as he pulled out a book, a candle with “1913” carved into it, a bundle of sage that made my chest burn as he lifted it, and a knife. He drew a lighter from an unseen pocket and lit the candle, holding the blade over the flame.

“Damien, what have I told you about playing with fire and knives?” I stammered, struggling to control any aspect of the quickly unraveling situation. 

As the flames danced in his eyes, I saw that they had turned pure white. “Father, you would do well to realize that you are no longer the one bestowing lessons.” He licked his lips. “Now hold still.”

“Damien, put down the fucking-”

My breath ceased as he plunged the blade into my diaphragm. 

And… it didn’t hurt. I watched in abject horror as he turned the knife in my torso, emitting a sound like a wild hog fucking an entire can of Spaghetti-Os. He pulled it out and stuck his fingers into the oozing wound. I was helpless to do anything but watch as he yanked. 

Sulfur hit my nostrils, thick and angry, as he extracted a wriggling blob from inside of me. A sense of light shot through my core as tension I didn’t realize I’d been holding spilled out.

Then Damien raised his knife and plunged it into the blob. Whatever was standing outside the front door screamed at the same time a bloodpool-shaped patch on my living room floor glowed fluorescent yellow-green.

“I’ve gotten it out of you,” my son explained in a voice that was somehow both very high and very low at the same time, “but that means our problems are only beginning.”

I stared at the stab wound near my stomach as it stitched itself back together. 

“I hope you’re ready for a fight, Father. Things are about to get messy.”

Obviously, I made it out alive, but not everyone did. I’ll update more [when I’m feeling up to it](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).
