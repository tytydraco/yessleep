Er yeah, I’ve never used Reddit before but apparently this is for scary stories? I dunno. The only thing is, this is actually happening to me and I need some advice but I thought this kind of audience might be more interested in what I have to say.

Okay, it started yesterday. I’d just moved into my first house in Portsmouth (I’m 20). I don’t have a lot of money yet but I got this place really cheap. The landlord said no one would buy it but didn’t tell me why. I didn’t need a reason but I sort of wish I’d asked now.

It seemed pretty normal to me. The house was small, obviously, and had green carpets which I swear every new house does. Like, why green? I don’t know but anyway, it looked like a university dorm which wasn’t the end of the world. It could definitely be worse. One tiny bathroom that you could barely fit yourself into, one bedroom (with a single bed), one kitchen and one living room. 

I got the WiFi done immediately. Besides from entertainment, I might still need it for texting my parents and all that. I was wondering around my house and got to the bathroom when I stopped. There was this little vent thing on the wall. Perfectly normal I’m sure but it gave me a really weird feeling. I’ve never been a scaredy cat but this made me feel an unprecedented fear in the pit of my stomach. Anyways, I shook it off and went back to looking about the place. Swiftly, I might add. That thing had made me jumpy.

That night, I was playing candy crush on my phone. Basic, I know but I’m hooked. Almost on level 2000. Anyway, the phone was on full brightness, right? And you know how it very slightly lights up the surroundings. Well I could see, in my peripherals, that vent thing in the bathroom. I wanted to go close the door so I didn’t have to look at that beastly vent but my legs wouldn’t let me. I had that feeling again. There was something seriously wrong with this thing. I decided to go to sleep, that way I wouldn’t have to look at it.

I did that thing that kids do, you know? Where they’re scared so they slam their head on the pillow and pull the duvet over their head. Yeah pathetic but you had to see this thing. I just got the most overwhelming feeling of dread. I was breathing quite heavily. If you’ve ever tried to breathe with a duvet over your head, you probably know that it gets pretty stuffy and, in a way, you kind of start to mildly suffocate. 

Well anyway, my breathing was pretty loud but I heard something else too. It was like another person’s breathing but very slightly out of time with mine. It was deep and raspy. It sounded like a sick man. I was breathing faster now; so was- it. Yeah I think I’ll refer to this thing as it for the rest of the story. 

I stayed there, unmoving, with my heart beating so hard against my ribs, it felt like they were gonna snap and the thing from Alien would pop out. I don’t know when but I guess I must’ve got to sleep because next thing I knew it was morning and here I am now, writing this. 

Well I’ll keep you updated on if anything else weird and wacky happens. Tell me if you know what this could be or if you have any advice at all, that would be great. Bye for now.
