Before I tell you this story just realized this, I don't know how I got out, I don't know how I got in and lastly I don't know how long I dreadfully was in that miserable rusted hell.

A small room, cramped, cold and eerie would spook anyone to some level, but somehow in this darkness I felt calm at first. Just moments ago I awoke to the screeching of steel grinding against itself with so much violence, it caused a lasting ringing in the depths of my ears. My heart thumped like a violent burst of explosions in my chest. Reaching out my palms I can place them against both sides of the petite room, if you can even call it that. The walls felt like rough grit steel with little bumps every inch and thick overlapping gaps where the steel met. 

Moving my hands around to look to see if there's anything else in here besides my dreadful fear, I felt a few fallen scraps of rusted metal, a thick plastic bag and a bucket. Pulling them close to horde the petite list of things, I noticed something. A round bump on the wall, but this one was bigger, felt like worn rubber. Pushing it caused a flicker, flash and the slow buzz of a red light came on in my little existence. Blasting bright blasting like a surgeons light in your eyes.

My vision faded in with it, now being able to see the rotting riveted chamber of my mysterious unknown prison. The sensation of the wicked fear wavered just enough for the thumping of my chest to slow like a train grinding its brakes to a slow halt. Though I can see now, it just gives me more questions. Why red, how did I get here and what is that foul odor slowly getting stronger…

The creaking of the steel panels slowly came to a halt, that or my focus went all onto one thing, the thump, thump thump. Footsteps would have been a compliment for this, it sounded vile, with each thump taking a slurp of liquid squishing... Getting closer... And closer… 
Total silence swept in, and then suddenly my miniature world of mine returned back to the depths of darkness. Slow hissing filled the silence, such as an early morning fog creeping in. My vision slowly wavered, my hands grew numb and then like that, I woke up again. This time the cold steel panels I laid on at least gave me a sense of me knowing I was still in the same room, prison or place. 

Once I collected my thoughts I dragged my hands to inspect the rough rotted riveted walls of my world again. Hoping to find that button that gave me a searing red light of vision and hope. After a lifetime feeling of searching I found it, I pressed it closed my eyes and… Still nothing, out of anger, fear and despair, I slammed, and banged it. Even yelled at it so loud my throat felt torn apart.
