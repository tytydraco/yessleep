I woke up, head throbbing, a sensation making it known that the place I'm in is moving, the interior is almost alien to me.

A singular note lays on the desk next to me, reading the following:

*Hello, I see you may be confused but unfortunately I have only a couple of questions.*

*I only know this, through eavesdropping: there are 500 floors, you are on the 500th floor, unfortunate..*

*Meet me on the 387th floor, and I will give you a bunch of helpful tips to survive this hellscape, such as the following, there are conductors on each floor, more and more hostile, you'll know immediately when you see them, also, another rule: do not be seen.*

*DO NOT BE SEEN*

**Good luck!**

I was astonished.. to say the least..

I decided to walk out into the hallway, and the note was correct.

Conductors on my "floor", but with one, giant, pulsating eyeball that took up the entire face like a tumor, a gaze without a blink that haunts dreams.

The interior was metallic, haunting. Passengers walking through the hallway, but one was arguing with the first conductor, didn't end well, to say the least, melted through the floor..

Nobody seemed to care, like it was a regular thing, but I get the conflict.

That guy was probably stuck in there for ages, so bottled anger processed onto the one eyed "beast" as he called it. Very extreme reaction to just melt the poor dude though.

I didn't know what to do, so I followed the other people walking towards their rooms, but I wanted to leave, get to the lower floor, the *lowest* floor.

"Hey, can I get past?" I asked politely, pissing myself in fear.

The conductor looked at me, a yellow gleam inspecting me, it's head tilted a little bit, by this point, I'm considering heading back to my room. The other passengers looking at the situation with curiosity and a nervous energy.

The eye flickered between green and red for a few seconds, the tension rising. 

A singular word was said,

"Yes."

*Phew*

I walk down the stairs, a new interior welcomed me into the new environment.
A singular sign saying the floor number:

499

The aformationed interior was still hostile, a crimson colour filled the room, and my dread was not going to leave anytime soon.

I then remembered the note, I shouldn't be seen from now on. I tried walking into a random room, and started my new life.

Then, a person walked in.

"What the fuck are you doing in here?!"

"Hey, I escaped from the floor above, don't tell anybody about me, keep me hidden from the conductor, please!"

He pondered for a bit, his head tilted, until he accepted to keep me safe.

I woke up, head throbbing, a sensation making it known that the place I'm in is still moving, the interior is still alien but I'm almost getting used to my surroundings.

Another note lay on the table next to me,  reading the following:

*Congratulations on moving one floor! Now here's the deal. I will keep giving you information, but only if you move one floor a day, then the deal is cut off.*

*Here's the next tip, possibly your last: some floors are traps, some floors are hallucinations, some warp your mind to project your thoughts in them. DO NOT FALL FOR THESE*

*Good luck*

My new roommate walked in and noticed the note I was reading, he didn't say anything but the atmosphere explained his feelings. A sour feeling lingering.

"Now that you know, you have to join me to escape, I'm trapped in a corner right now and I need your help!"

"So, you have contact from the outside? Fuck you."

"I've been trapped in here FOR YEARS! And you just have a fucking note guiding you around.."

"Okay, I know how this seems, but I didn't choose this, I woke up just yesterday in an unfamiliar environment and I just discovered these notes appear. So if you are going to jump to conclusions, think twice before you fucking say it."

Then, the train finally stops, presumably at a location for the passengers below, the atmosphere lifting a bit.

"Y'know, I've never been outside the train, I was born here you see... Maybe, we could see the world together?"

"Sure!"

He then introduced himself as Sam, and the journey has officially begun.

What a day, *what a day indeed.*
