I wasn't sure where else to post this, but I felt the elements and my experiences' with my friend are too disturbing to post in many other subreddits. I should say this has a lot of trigger warnings so just be warned. This is basically an in depth examination of someone dealing with unchecked Paranoid Schizophrenia over the course of 15 years from a close but outside perspective. 

We met in High School around 2008.   
We were both loners with an appreciation for movies and filmmaking. We connected deeply on this level and wasnt long before we were inseparable, like brothers.   
He had some personality quirks about him but nothing really out of the ordinary for angsty teens.   
Only 3 things really happened around this time that I want to note leading up to his condition. One, his father was wealthy and his mother had a bad case of Bipolar disorder. Id often come over to his house with her passed out in a depression coma on the couch or in a heated argument between my friend or his father. I only bring that up because I know mental issues can be inherited genetically and they'll also play a role later on.   
Two, out of the blue, on our school myspace page, him and some other dude i had never seen him with or have i ever talked to decided to troll me and two of our close friends in an open forum about personal information only shared between friends. Basically rippin on us for literally no reason or with any provocation. Me and my other friends didnt know what to make of it so we just stopped talking to him.   
Three, The next school year, he wasnt there, we heard he had some issues through his family and was getting schooled somewhere else. Never got any more info on it.   
He showed up, back at my school, the final year like nothing happened but I kept my distance. Slowly we talked here and there. Even after we graduated. 

Eventually, We were back to being friends like we were.   
He went to our local college and had an apartment down the street from it.   
The whole time he was there things seemed fine. We were just going about our days doing what we did. Until, one day i got invited to a house party that was going on. I told him about it and he seemed pretty hype about it. I told him id pick him up and everything. Then the evening of I texted him and got no response, i must have texted him 100 times and called too but nothing. so i said fuck it and went to the party by myself. Days went by and I didnt hear back from him. I drove out to his apartment, his car was there, so i knocked on his door and everything but I got no answer. I tried talking to his landlord and he said he had saw him or talked to him recently so i figured he was mad about something or i mean who knows, so i just left him alone. 

I didnt hear from him for I think 3 years. 

In that time i often tried to see if he got arrested, killed himself, died, couldnt find any of his families info to ask so i was just in limbo wondering. 

Out of the blue one day, he messaged me and told me he had some crazy shit to tell me. I told him to meet up with me that night so we did outside of a starbucks, we just sat and talked.   
He said the night before we were supposed to go party, that he came back to his apartment and the whole place was lit with candles. like hundreds of candles. With postit notes everywhere with different weird sayings about things in his life like he was being watched. He told his landlord and changed his locks. He then preceeded to say the next night someone broke in and anally raped and burned him. He said he had evidence of this (He always said he did, photos, videos, etc, but i never once saw anything).  
Now, a lot of this is going to be muddy because its been so many years and i heard sooo many stories so forgive me if the connotations dont flow too well but he eventually went down the common skitzo phenomenon known as gang stalking (which if you dont know about, its a paranoid delusion commonly found in people with this condition, where they think random people are a part of a group dedicated in singling out this person and stalk them, record them, whatever...theres conspiracy theories made about it but its 100% just a delusion and the irony is that THEY become the stalkers and harassers because they start recording and confronting people who they think are gangstalker and the people they call out are just confused...like imagine a hobo coming up to you off the street accusing you of something you didnt do. that kind of mentality)   
of course I had never heard of this phenomenon at the time and didnt know what to think of it. I didnt believe it because it didnt make any sense, but what could I say. He went on to say he sold everything he had, got on a plane (where they were even stalking him on the plane) and he flew somewhere to the midwest and got by that whole time just living out there doing god knows what. He cut off all communication to the outside world basically.   
I tried to make points like why would anyone spend the time and money to do all this but he always had some excuse for it. I want to make clear that at this time he didnt ramble like a crazy person, he talked in such a matter of fact way like we have talked for years. so it was very strange to hear and I really didnt know what to say about it. I was just happy to get my friend back, honestly. 

For the next couple of years, he settled into a new apartment and from there things just spiraled.   
When we were out he would offten say people were talking shit about us. like people walking by and everything. Never heard anyone say anything, not once.   
He would change the locks on his door once a month.   
He'd change his phone once a month.   
He stopped listening to our favorite rappers because he said they were sneek dissing us, usually me personally in a lot of songs by making vague comparisons.   
He would often search his apartment because he thought he was being recorded.  
He said his gangstalkers were using highly sophisticated tech to blast radiowaves into his house that would keep him awake and sick and in immense pain (a lot of times would cause him to go into no contact for a week)   
He would talk about videos that were sent to him of people being brutally raped, murdered, or committing suicide. He said they were of his gang stalkers as in some form of trying to torture him. He said he had all this recorded, again, i never saw any of this.   
Unlike a lot of Skitzos, he didnt think his stalkers were the government, he often refered to them as r\*\*\*\*\*ed crack smoking hobos. To which i often asked how they would have the time or power to do this too him but he would just brush it off.   
He also often talked about wanting to brutally murder them.  
  
Now, within this time his family knew this was going on and tried to intervene. But he thought his parents were in on it too, giving away information about him to his stalkers. Kinda culminated to him having a freak out at a dentist office where he thought they were gonna drug him and do something. He was baker acted and his parents tried to get him medicated. it worked for a bit but he figured it was their doing so he stopped taking them and never really trusted them after. 

This is why i never really said anything to him about all this. If i did, he would have said i was a part of the problem and never talked to me. not to mention after hearing about it for a few years it gets pretty tiring. I would just listen to his rants for a minute and be like yeah thats nuts and then hed just naturally go back to being normal and the rest of the time was fine. 

A little bit after he somehow managed to get a girlfriend, I felt bad for her because she didnt know what he was really like for a minute. He also got a rabbit which will come into play later. During this time, he became super isolated and only wanted to be with his gf.   
I didnt see him the entire time they were together.  
  
One day she contacted me about all of this and I explained it to her, she felt bad for him and scared for herself. Apparently he ripped out the entire interior of his car, seats, consoles, everything trying to find recording devices. eventually it was too much for her. He called me trying to get me to convince her to come back and too look in his attic to prove there was a recording device in there but of course i told her to stay away because i have no idea what he would be capable of doing at that point. She told me other random bits like anytime he saw vanity plates on a car it was some direct reference to her or them. that famous people on insta were posting photos directed towards her. all kinds of stuff.   
She left for good and I took a break from him indefinitely. I saw him a few more times after this but just because my now then new best friend and i both knew him and hung out with him once in a great while.   


Each time I saw him he looked worse. his teeth were almost black, looked like he was smoking crack, but i think it was because he was chainsmoking cigarettes in his apartment and not brushing his teeth. the whole apartment was a mess. and it got to the point where anything he said was a delusion.  it was impossible to have any kind of normal conversation with him so we never stayed around long. 

in between this time he was often on social media and would make long winded cryptic rambling posts, ususally very violent in nature. Usually I wouldnt want to out my friend but he hasnt used this account since 2019 and never posted anything personal about his name or where he lived so if you want to see what im talking about his old insta is [https://www.instagram.com/codamvhs/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/codamvhs/?hl=en)  
He erased a LOT of ramblings from it, but if you look in the comments on the photos hes just commenting to himself. just to get a sense of what he became.   
I mean he would go into book lengths of stuff that made no coherent sense to anyone. 

He even hit up an old high school girl friend of mine that he was friends with to ask her if she remembered that time we all watched someone get brutally murdered.

He called me one day and said someone had his rabbit taken away and then said he came home to blood everywhere. im pretty sure he brutally killed it at some point. 

He got kicked out of that apartment and moved into his now divorced moms house, one of them (wealthy). He hit me up one day and said she called the cops on him after he woke up to someone in his room who proceeded to analy rape him. The cops didnt really do anything and he of course said they were all on it. His mom, dealing with her own issues, gave him the house to himself to do whatever while she went to one of her other homes. 

My best friend at the time that i mentioned earlier needed a place to stay after a hurricane fucked up his house. I didnt have the space so he was like ill ask (skitzo friend) if he could stay with him for a bit. I highly recommended against it because of everything that had gone on and he was like i dont have any other choice so he did. He wasnt even there for a night. He said he was super weird, had shit ton of notebooks filled page to page with ramblings. He said he browsed through one and saw shit in it about ME going against him or something and that he wanted to murder me. or that someone took my place, he often said people were basically stolen and replaced like invasion of the body snatchers. As we were texting each other while he was in his room with the door locked, he slipped a note under his door and it said something strange (cant remember its been about 6 years since then. but that was enough for my friend and I went and picked him up that night. 

The next day, my Schitzo friend tried to text and apologize but I had heard enough. It was wayyy too much for me. So i cut off all ties with him after that. 

Couple years later I moved to Taiwan. He saw my photos on insta and DM'd me to say I was some imposter. I clarified it was me and then I blocked him. That was the last time I talked to him. 

Every once in awhile I check to see what happened to him. Did he kill himself, did he hurt someone, what.

Last thing was that a couple years ago he was arrested after going into a CVS and impersonating as an undercover cop, kept asking the clerks for a package and that hed arrest them if they didnt give it to them. they called the cops, the cops asked for identification which he couldnt prove, and he went to a mental ward but was released after being deemed mentally fit somehow. I read all of this on the court documents. 

No updates since. No idea if hes alive or what. But its just wild to think how self destructive the human brain can be to itself. Scary, more so, that people like this are walking around every day next to us. Never know what they are capable of.
