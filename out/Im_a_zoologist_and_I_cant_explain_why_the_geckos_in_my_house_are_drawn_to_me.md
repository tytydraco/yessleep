I didn't panic at first when I noticed an unusual number of geckos skittering across the walls in my house. It was July, the hottest it had been here in years. The air was thick with heat. It was the kind of weather that drew out every cold-blooded thing from the cracks. The geckos seemed to be just following instinct. 

You learn to live with decay on this island. Damp baseboards, swollen door frames, mold glooming behind every goddamn nook and cranny. The atmosphere so humid, it threatens to suffocate you. It's the kind of environment where cold-blooded creatures thrive. 

You'd think I'd be better equipped for this, considering I'm a zoologist. Spent 8 years in herpetology before shifting to contract research and animal behavior consulting. If it crawls, slithers, or hisses, I know what makes it tick. I have tagged lizards in deserts, wrestled alligators in brackish swamps, even stood face-to-face with a komodo dragon in Komodo fucking National Park. I have known and understood reptiles until now. 

The behavior of the geckos I mention is not instinct as we have been taught. It is not behavior I can predict, and it's happening inside my house. 

They even look off. They are not those translucent little things that cling to the corners of kitchen walls. These have thick bodies, heavy with what looks like gestation, but bloated in a way that defies biological efficiency. Their skin is a curiously dark shade of green, almost black under certain light, and thick and leathery. They look like they have been soaking in something for a while. 

Their movements are not typical of normal geckos either. No twitchy, panicked, zig-zagging. They move in long, slow glides. It looks like they’re swimming like water snakes. And the smell, oh god, the smell. Damp, faintly sweet like rotten fruit, my whole house smells like them. 

Being a herpetologist, the irony was not lost on me when I ended up calling pest control. Well, pest control on this island is a guy named Harry. He's the only guy who does this sort of thing. I think he used to be a sailor, but he's retired now and spends the better part of his day smoking joints by the dock, occasionally showing up if you have a rodent or snake problem. 

He came by late afternoon one day, carrying a beat-up fishing net. “Jesus, fat bastards”, he said, poking one of them off the wall with the blunt end of a broomstick, then scooping it into the net. “Havent seen ‘em this bloated ever.” Harry squinted at the thing writhing in the net. 

“You'd be surprised to know that's not reproductive bloating. They're not pregnant,” I responded, unable to take my eyes off the gecko-covered walls. 

He grunted and swatted another one off the window sill into his net. “Well, they're here, that's for sure.” 

“They're not eating,” I blurted out. “There's no trace of feeding, no bugs, no excrement, just swelling, it's odd.” 

“Right,” he said, nudging another one of the geckos in the nest and cinching it closed. “That's a lotta notice for lizards.”

Harry left, and the house remained clean until the next day. Until they were back again. More of them now clung to the walls, the furniture, moving in that peculiar manner that drove me insane. It was truly maddening. I turned off every light in the house. Reptiles are drawn to heat and light, standard behavior. 

I worked under that rational assumption only to find one of them stuck to my face one night in a blacked-out room. I shoved it off and sat upright in the dark, switching on the flashlight I kept by the bed. 

The gecko was on the floor, belly to the tiles, its huge eyes focused directly on me. I swept the light across the room to find dozens of them. My bookshelf, my desk, the inside of my open closet, all of them occupied. 

I ran out screaming and called Harry again. By now, his appearance was so frequent that I didn't even bother with pleasantries. 

“You really got a pull with these ugly bastards, don't ya?” He laughed as he scooped another one off the ceiling. “They really like you.” 

The casualness in his tone made my skin crawl, but the next day, there were no geckos, and so I almost let myself believe the nightmare was over. 

Later that night however, I woke up with one on my face again. Its belly was soft and cold and slick, like an undercooked egg. Its limbs spread over my forehead and jaw, its tail curled neatly under my nose. I gritted my teeth and commanded myself to neither scream nor open my eyes. I convinced myself I was dreaming and drifted back to sleep somehow. 

But the next time I woke, I was unable to move. 

They were on me. All of them. From neck to toe. Dozens. Maybe a hundred, their bloated bellies rising and falling against my skin, their eyes gleaming in pitch black darkness, their mouths slightly open, flicking their tongues, and the smell so rancid I don't even know how to describe it. 

All I knew in that moment, all I could think of, was this strange thought: They're not here for light, not heat, not food. They're here for me. 

After that night, I don't remember how I broke free. It's all a blur, and I hate remembering it. 

Since then, I've been sleeping over at a neighbor's house. Inside my own, I'm unable to escape them. 

I have not left for good yet, because I need to understand what is happening. My entire career as a herpetologist has been built on identifying behavioral anomalies in reptiles and amphibians. 

But these geckos, or whatever they are, do not behave normally, and they remain only in my house, nowhere else on the island as far as I have been able to explore it.

I don't trust the spaces I inhabit anymore. I'm always looking around, scanning the walls, no matter where I am, hoping for what? I don't even know anymore. 

I keep telling myself there must be a rational explanation, some obscure phenomenon, some missed variable, but it only gets worse. 

I'm documenting everything, hoping someone out there knows something I do not. If any of you can help me, please do, because I just want to sleep in my own bed again.
