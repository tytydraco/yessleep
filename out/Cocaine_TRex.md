Skulls sat there, teeth bared. I felt uneasy, staring at the main one â€”the skull of the Tyrannosaurus Rex, king of monsters. The light shone down onto it, in a ray, while darkness draped a veil of black all around the gleaming ivory. Darkness and dinosaurs, I shivered in dread.

I've always had a bad feeling about dinosaurs, like, they are real, in my life. I know they are, I've always known. I thought the one in the movie was real, when I was a kid. Strange, when I saw one for real, it was just an animal, it didn't look real, somehow, staring at the real thing.

I was taken, shoved into the van with two other children on the field trip. They'd stolen three of us, and I was the only one who didn't get eaten. I wriggled, tied, under the heavy bar fence. The dinosaur wasn't trying to get through, I doubt the bison fence would withstand the rage of the monster, if it wanted out of its enclosure.

They tried to catch me, the weirdos in the dinosaur masks. Some kind of weird cult, led by a guy who looked almost exactly like a young Jerod Leto. He wasn't in a mask, and ordered them to catch me. I ran as fast as I could and escaped into the forests. I wandered out onto the highway, where I was picked up by the State Patrol after I stood there trying to hitchhike.

I was sitting in the back of their vehicle, locked in, and witnessed what happened next. I had already had a harrowing and frightening experience, but I hadn't seen anything yet. I didn't actually see my classmates get eaten, or at least I don't remember seeing it happen. Somehow, I suspect the memory is buried in my mind, and I cannot remember seeing it happen, I just know they were devoured by the monster and I then panicked and also escaped.

The two State Patrol saw two of my pursuers and one of them got out and gave chase to them on foot, back to their compound. When they were on the road leading in, the driver picked up the sweaty patrolwoman who came out the bushes on the side of the road waving us down. We then proceeded to the entrance of the dinosaur cult's compound, owned by some rich guy, who denied them access without a warrant.

We sat there for three hours while more police showed up and then there was a warrant for immediate search of the premises for the missing children and suspected kidnappers. They found them, but the dinosaur cage seemed empty, and the rest of the cultists were gone, somehow. The kidnappers were arrested, their van impounded as evidence.

It was then discovered that there was a back road, leading out to the forestry road, also known as Smuggler's Highway. We followed it, along the bumpy route, until we found where a collision between a four-wheel vehicle and the special cage truck for the dinosaur had occurred. There was frightening evidence of the t-rex everywhere, tracks and destruction. There was also blood, but what was scary was that we found no bodies. Everyone was missing.

I thought, 'well at least it has eaten' but then we found that the smugglers were bringing a ton of cocaine on their vehicle. The State Patrol looked worried, seeing that a large animal had eaten a ton of cocaine.

"It's like in that movie, Cocaine Shark." One of them said.

"You mean Cocaine Bear, I think it was a remake." The other said. Before they could discuss the movies, the real-life T-Rex silently, without trembling the ground, moved in, leaned over, and ate one of them; its eyes were all dilated and crazed-looking.

I was screaming in absolute dread and terror. The other State Patrol, she got out of there and hid, while the high T-Rex searched for her in futility. Every time it tried to sniff her out, it sneezed instead. Then it heard me screaming and took note.

The smile on its face, I do not care for. It still haunts my nightmares. It was staring through the flimsy bullet glass, which wouldn't have stopped that thing, the reptilian dragon beast. It wasn't exactly like a t-rex should look or act, and not just because it was stoned, but because it was genetically mutated, crossed with something else, hatched from something else's egg. It vaguely looked like a crocodile, or perhaps a Fallout Deathclaw, or something in-between. Its arms weren't as t-rex like as they should be, and its face was too broad, making its grin unbearable.

I was shrieking in insane hysterics of panic. Then the State Patrol started firing the assault rifle she had found near where someone was plucked from the ground and eaten in basically one vicious gulp. To that monster, a person was like a very large bite of steak, and it had to be full, I thought, but then again, it was crazed from its overdose.

The assault rifle was emptied, and did little more than make the monster angry. I had always wondered what a gun would do to a dinosaur, since they never shoot any dinosaurs in the movies, making me wonder if dinosaurs all have some kind of plot armor that makes the use of guns impossible.

My throat hurt and my eyes were blurred with tears, as the tail struck the car and moved it across the road. The jolt stunned me, so that I was looking all cross eyed at the goat State Patrol woman who had found a rocket launcher in the smuggler's vehicle. She let the t-rex have an anti-tank slug through one eye, which detonated on the inside of its skull and disintegrated its entire head. The poor animal never even knew what happened. One minute it was eating a psychedelic buffet of screaming cheeseburgers and the next - darkness.

"Got a little extinction on your face." She coughed out a one-liner, glancing around with the feral eyes of cooling adrenaline.

She dropped the bazooka and got in the patrol vehicle. Shakily she backed up and we drove away, down the forestry road.

I'm very glad to be alive, and enjoying life, glad I'm not extinct.
