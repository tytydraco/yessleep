It was October. The kind of cold that clings to your clothes and sinks into your bones. I was thirteen the year Lauren Whitmore disappeared. I remember the sky was low that morning — like it didn’t want to look us in the eye.

Black River, West Virginia isn’t on most maps. We’ve got one diner, two churches, and a gas station that’s never open past ten. It’s the kind of place people don’t leave — and if they do, they don’t come back.

Lauren was seventeen. Kind. Smart. The sort of girl you just figured would get out. She walked to work at the diner every morning. Twenty minutes down a winding road through the woods.

She never showed up that day.

They said it wasn’t like her, but folks didn’t panic. Not yet. Teenagers go off sometimes. But by sundown, her parents had called the sheriff. And something shifted in town. Like a silence had crawled into our guts and settled there.

I remember Sheriff Keaton — big guy, always kind — saying it didn’t sit right. No signs of a struggle. No dropped bag. No footprints. Just… gone.

Search parties started the next day. Everyone pitched in. People who hadn’t spoken in years were suddenly side-by-side in the woods, calling her name. But the forest kept its secrets.

Until the fourth night.

That’s when it got strange.

A father and son heard whispering near the old sawmill. Thought it was Lauren. They followed it, but it always stayed just ahead of them. When they reached the clearing, the sound stopped.

They found her scarf — caught on a window frame six feet off the ground.

It was dry. Warm. Like it had just been left there.

After that, things unraveled.

An old couple heard knocking at their door one night — soft, deliberate. No one was there. Just small footprints in the mud, leading to and from the forest. No indentations in the grass. Like someone had been floating.

Then came the photo.

The town newspaper received it in the mail. No return address. Just one picture: Lauren standing in the woods, her eyes wide, unblinking. Behind her, something tall and thin lurked in the shadows.

They didn’t publish it. But everyone heard.

People started locking their doors — which sounds normal, but in Black River, we didn’t used to. Porch lights stayed on all night. Kids were walked to school in silence.

Then came the tape.

A cassette, mailed to the newspaper. Static for three minutes — then a voice, faint and slow.

It said her name.

That was it.

Lauren’s parents got a final letter. A photo of the woods. In the middle — a wooden door standing upright in a clearing. No walls. No house. Just the door.

On the back, in red ink: “You can still get her back. But only if you stop looking.”

People started leaving after that. One by one. Quietly.

We don’t talk about Lauren anymore.

But sometimes, if the fog rolls in just right…
you’ll hear someone whisper her name in the woods.

And God help you if they whisper yours next.
