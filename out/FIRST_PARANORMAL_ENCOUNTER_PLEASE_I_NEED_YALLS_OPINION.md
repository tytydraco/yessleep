Honestly, I was never a big fan of ghosts or anything related. I always thought it was pretty stupid and just some mockery or sort.

However, what I experienced today with my girlfriend is absolutely weird and gives me chills till now.

Basically, I was meeting my girlfriend outside her house which is an apartment and we met until like 2 am and I took her home.

She typed the passcode in to open the front door of the apartment. As she was doing that I was able to notice footsteps approaching. When I mean footsteps like genuine footsteps on the ground and it was exactly three steps right behind where we were. At first I didn’t bother to look back but when my gf opened the door she looked back to see who was behind us but she noticed nothing and asked me “Did you also hear those footsteps?”

This already made me a little uncomfortable. I was looking through the windows to see if it was a man or like an animal that was just crossing by. We thought it was weird so we decided to just go past but I was extra scared so I made sure that we passed the automatic door censor so that we don’t open the door. Then, i got her an elevator to go home and I was planning on just leaving back out UNTIL I heard the automatic door open again. I panicked, she panicked we ran to the 9th floor where she lives.

We discussed what we heard. We only heard the door open but no footsteps or any other sound, just the automatic door opening by itself. Because theres two elevators in her apartment we sat and watch to see if the other elevator will move floors from the first floor which then we can say someone has actually came in when the door opened. For a solid 5 minutes, nothing budged.

I instantly called a taxi, and went down the elevator and whilst going down it felt like the elevator stopped on the first floor for extra few seconds (not just me my gf also waited to see if the elevator will stop 1st floor but she also said her heart dropped because it stayed on floor one abnormally longer than other floors)

We were discussing maybe like the footsteps might have been just like an animal or like a man walking by but genuinely the footsteps sounded like they were right behind us.

Maybe the automatic door can also just be malfunctioning but for the past few months where i waited for my gf outside, it never has malfunctioned once where it just opened randomly.

I thought it was so scary and the fact that they all happened together scared me. What is this? Am I just being sensitive? I also want to emphasize the fact that I am a strong believer of none ghosts and I always thought those type of stuff were all just bs thats been made up to scare people. However, I feel like theres no other words to describe this situation other than "paranormal". Help me please.
