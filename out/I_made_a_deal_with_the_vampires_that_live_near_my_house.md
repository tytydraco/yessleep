If you drive past the old city hall and turn left at the dairy farm on the river’s edge, you’ll find an old bridge with three street lamps. That’s where the vampires live. 

No one knows when they first appeared or why they’re there. We just live with them and hope they don’t harm the ones we love.

My name is Violet and I’m the only person who’s ever seen them…and returned home to talk about it. 

It was just last month. Mom and Dad had sent me to bed. Vanished into their room to binge TV. It’d been an intense night of arguing.

We’d fought like that, nonstop, ever since my brother, Jaime, died in the car accident. It was the heartache, splitting us apart. Making us miserable.

Well…I found a way to solve all of it. 

As soon as my parents were asleep, I cracked open my window. Grabbed my backpack. And climbed down to my bicycle below.

It took about two hours before I finally reached the bridge. The place was eerie, surrounded by darkness except for those three street lamps.

I dismounted my bike, leaned it against the railing, and waited.

About five minutes passed and I heard rustling. A slight breeze brushed my hair as…

…a pale figure, six feet tall, descended onto the railing, bound in a black leather trench coat, ears pointed like an elf’s. 

This was Pointy Ears. 

“You shouldn’t have come here, Warm Blood,” he said, stepping down from the railing. 

I unslung my backpack. Pulled out a clove of garlic.  

“I didn’t come all this way to talk to a lackey,” I said. “Where’s your leader?”  

Pointy Ears slunk back. The garlic’s strong scent frightened him. He knew I was serious. 

Then, another cold breeze swept past us. 

Two other forms, wearing the same garments as the first, appeared before me.

One was gaunt and looked like a creature who hadn’t fed in centuries. The other was a woman, or used to be, with flowing hair and deep rose-colored eyes. 

This was Rose Eyes. She was the one I was after, the leader of the vampires.  

“You must have a death-wish, Warm Blood,” she hissed, with a voice both beautiful and dark. “What do you want?”

“To make a deal.”

She leapt to the ground. The other two crept close on either side, hemming me in. 

“The dead do not make deals with the living.”

I held out the garlic. Fear knotting my stomach. For the first time, I felt uncertain: ‘What was I doing here?!’

With the speed of a cobra, Rose Eyes snatched the garlic from my fist. Crushed it in her palm. Licked the juice from her fingers. 

Pointy Ears laughed as I gawked in disbelief. This wasn’t supposed to be happening. Vampires were afraid of garlic, right?!

“How did you—?”

“Your history books don’t mention my kind,” Rose Eyes hissed. “If they did, you’d know the standard deterrents don’t work.”

“What are you?” 

She just smiled. 

My mind drifted back to my house. I envisioned my parents waiting for me on the porch. Begging me to come home. Praying for a second chance for us to be happy.

I reached into my bag. Grabbed my crucifix.  

“That won’t be necessary.” Rose Eyes said, waved her hand.

I went still. The crucifix and backpack fell. Trinkets scattered: a bottle of blessed water…a wooden stake. 

Pointy Ears and Gaunt One leapt back, startled by the items. But Rose Eyes perused each one, curious, then shoved me back toward the railing. Her face inches from mine. 

“What do you want?” 

“…to be like you.” 

She tilted her head, curious. 

“My parents hate me. All we do is fight. My brother’s…gone. No one at school likes me and there’s no reason for me to live so…” I exhaled, feeling the weight lift off my shoulders.
“I want to be dead. Like you.”

Rose Eyes turned to Gaunt One. He just licked his lips, said: “Give her what she desires.”

Rose Eyes slammed me against a street lamp. Tore open my jacket, exposed my throat. Bared her fangs.  

“Wait!” I shouted. Peering up at her. “Does it…hurt?”

“Of course it does.” 

Her teeth sank into me. Ripping into my flesh. It was agonizing. My knees buckled as I gasped. Held in her impossible grip. 

I wanted to scream. But a hand pressed against my mouth. It was Pointy Ears, silencing me.

I was so scared. Fear flooded my face as I stared into Rose Eyes’ merciless gaze.

And yet…I felt peace at the same time. I was so tired. I just wanted to sleep.

…just wanted to sleep…

When I opened my eyes, I was in my bedroom. Still in the same clothes. Blankets piled on top of me. 

I remembered the night before. Sat up. Felt my neck, fingers searching for a scar. Found none. 

I held up my phone. Scanned every inch of my throat with the camera. No signs of any struggle. And there, under the bed, was my backpack filled with trinkets. 

“Damn.” I stared at the clock: Six AM. 

The entire sequence had been a dream.

I glanced to the window. The sun was rising. School, the place I hated most, would be starting soon. 

I hopped out of bed. Pulled the curtain aside. 

“Ouch!” I stepped back. Pain shotgunning through my body. 

I looked down. There on my wrist was…a small patch of burned skin. 

The sunlight had hurt me!

I closed the blinds. Breathing heavily, allowing the oxygen to fill my lungs. 

It was the first time I noticed…my eyes…in the vanity mirror. 

They were rose-pink. 

And my teeth…

I opened my jaws and they came out…incisors sharp as a piranha’s.

Rose Eyes had fulfilled my wish. 

She had given me a new life. 

Not as a vampire…but as something else.

I couldn’t wait to start my day.
