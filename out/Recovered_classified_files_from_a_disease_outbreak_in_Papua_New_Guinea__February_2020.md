The following excerpts were obtained from documents recovered during the downsizing of Mactan Air Base, Cebu, in late 2023. Most were found in a sealed personnel file marked OPERATION WHITE SPIRE. The material appears to contain both official military reports and handwritten diary entries from CDC Liaison Dr. M. Harrow. The final transcript was recorded two weeks before the majority of global COVID-19 lockdowns began in March 2020.

*[CLASSIFIED FIELD REPORT / EXCERPT / 23 FEB 2020]  
SUBJECT: Dr. M. Harrow – CDC Liaison, Operation White Spire  
LOCATION: Western Highlands, Papua New Guinea*

Deployed via rotary transport to Village Kumba. Casualties reported by local health ministry: 17 dead, cause unknown. Rumours report tribes eating each other. Local liaison (Ministry of Culture) present on arrival. Liaison dismisses rumors of inter-tribal cannibalism as “superstitious nonsense” and claims practice was abandoned decades ago. Notes that “Westerners always believe the old myths.”  

Area assessment: multiple bodies in varying stages of decomposition, scattered through jungle clearing. Wound patterns inconsistent, tearing, crushing, and missing tissue noted. 

Sustained bite wound to left forearm from hostile male during inspection. Hostile neutralized. Wound irrigated, tetanus booster administered. Recommend further pathogen screening.

*[PERSONAL DIARY ENTRY – 24 FEB 2020]*
Bite itches like hell. Probably got half the guy’s dirty teeth still in there, but the medics just slapped a bandage on and told me to get back to work.  

Rations are running out faster than they should. Can’t even feed us properly in this shit hole, budget cuts. Wildlife is smart enough to stay the hell away, except for the bugs.  

Locals look wrong. Healthy ones still twitching, teeth grinding like they are chewing something that is not there. Can’t focus their eyes. They stare through you. Some just drop mid-sentence. Liaison still says it is nothing. Said they have chewed too much Buai, found out that’s Betel Nut. I mean that’s psychoactive sure but this is different.

*[CLASSIFIED FIELD REPORT / EXCERPT / 27 FEB 2020]  
SUBJECT: Dr. M. Harrow – Operation White Spire – Secondary Deployment*

Second site: Village N’Kala. No survivors on approach. Observed multiple hostiles engaged in active mutilation and ingestion of human remains, confirming initial reports. Hostiles non-verbal, exhibiting violent motor activity and absence of pain response.  
Test results: prion disease markers present in all available samples.  
Orders: Contain and prevent spread.  

Containment achieved via total incineration of site and remains. Liaison avoided further discussion, showing no visible distress despite casualty count. Recommend follow-up interview to determine scope of local awareness prior to outbreak.  

One enlisted casualty sustained during clearance operation. Remains transferred to FOB morgue for post-mortem.

*[PERSONAL DIARY ENTRY – 28 FEB 2020]*
Noticed myself lingering near the morgue before departure. Cold air, the smell of steel and something underneath it. Did not go in.  

FOB stores empty. No explanation. I am hungry all the time. Wound has healed but it is still warm, like a bruise.  

Monkey wandered too close today. Shot it. Did not even think about cooking, I just tore into it. Blood hot in my mouth. The taste was  
Never mind.  

Did not even fill the gap. Still hungry.

*[CLASSIFIED FIELD REPORT / EXCERPT / 2 MAR 2020]  
SUBJECT: Dr. M. Harrow – Operation White Spire – Liaison Interview*

Conducted follow-up interview with Ministry of Culture liaison regarding prior statement on inter-tribal cannibalism. Liaison refused to give direct answers regarding historical practices or recent evidence observed in N’Kala. Deflected questions, stating “you people always want to make it something it is not.” When asked about absence of visible distress during site clearance, liaison responded: “Why would I cry for people who chose their path.”  

Interview concluded without cooperation. Subject departed without shaking hands. Observed no apparent fear of proximity despite confirmed pathogen transmission risk.

*[PERSONAL DIARY ENTRY – 2 MAR 2020]*
Do not remember walking here. Cold tiles. Freezer hum. The air in the morgue is thick, metallic, almost sweet.  

Door opens. It is him. The liaison. Says my name like he has been looking for me. Look of shock cuts him off when he saw me. He must want something, money, a signature, I do not care. I watch his mouth moving but all I can see is the skin at his throat pulsing with each beat.  

Something breaks in my head. Red mist.  

Hot blood on my tongue. The noise he makes is short, wet. I am still chewing when I realise I am on the floor with him.  

Still hungry.  

I’ll request shore leave. Tell them it’s trauma from what I saw. A break will help. Somewhere quiet.

*[TRANSCRIPT / MILITARY POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM / 14 MAR 2020]*
MP: “You understand why you are here, Doctor?”  

HARROW: “You think I did something wrong. I did not. It is just natural now. Necessary. Evolution.”  

MP: “We have you linked to 47 civilian disappearances since you landed at Mactan Air Base. Your hotel had three freezers. We are seeing early-stage symptoms in Cebu hospitals. You brought the disease here.”  

HARROW: “Brought it? No. The liaison told me it was a dead tradition. But traditions only die when nobody wants them anymore. The tribes still wanted it, even if their government refused to believe. Now I want it.”  

MP: “You have started an outbreak.”  

HARROW: “Outbreak? No, Sergeant. I am continuing an age-old tradition, and now it is mine.”
