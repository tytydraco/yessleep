One is the loneliest number, as they say (or sing). I grew up as an only child in a sprawling, decrepit manor that was a solid 14 miles outside of town. And the town that I’m referring to wasn’t exactly a metropolis, either. It helped that I had two cats to be my best friends / partners in crime and that usually, my younger brother Casey was around as well.

I must’ve been six or seven when I met Mr. Lickety-Split. I was sitting in the sunroom coloring in a book of mandalas that my mother had given me for my birthday. As always, my babysitter Jeanine was on the sofa in the living room, no doubt texting her latest meathead boyfriend. Every six to eight weeks, Jeanine would come over with bloodshot eyes and eyeliner smeared halfway down her face; before too long, she’d meet a new guy and there’d be some manic “up” energy before the cycle repeated itself and the relationship imploded. Jeanine didn’t even pretend to like kids (in general or me specifically, for that matter); the only reason that my parents used her was because her family’s house five miles down the road was the only one close enough to ours to make the arrangement feasible.

I looked up from my mandala and there was Mr. Lickety-Split. He was spindly, with neatly coiffed gray hair and a wide smile too perfect to be anything other than dentures in a man his age. His features were vaguely British, and he wore a tux with tails that had clearly been cut to the fashions of another time and place. But Mr. Lickety-Split’s most spectacular feature were his blue-green eyes: They had these sparkly celestial swirls, like something that the Hubble Space Telescope would capture an image of. Something about his mien and his posture seemed playful, inviting.

“Hey -” I exclaimed, ecstatic at the thought that my prayers for a human friend had finally been answered.

Mr. Lickety-Split brought his index finger up to his lips: the signal for quiet. I nodded, then looked over into the other room to verify that Jeanine hadn’t noticed anything. Mr. Lickety-Split introduced himself, and then he made me a proposition:

*Want to play a joke on that insipid little bitch?*

I was shocked that Mr. Lickety-Split had used the b-word; I looked over at Jeanine in a panic, sure that she would hear and get me and my new friend in trouble. But Mr. Lickety-Split had a way of talking without speaking aloud – just sort of planting his words in my mind and letting them grow there. He tended to use a lot of words that I didn’t know yet, in those days.

I nodded.

*You have to follow my instructions carefully, and you must never, ever question me or disobey me. Understand?*

Again, I nodded my assent. Over the coming years, this would remain Mr. Lickety-Split’s one and only rule.

Mr. Lickety-Split led me to the kitchen, where he opened the refrigerator door and pointed to the casserole that my mom had left there.

*Put this in the oven,* he ordered me. I lifted the heavy pan and transferred it to the middle rack on the oven as he directed.

My mom had left a sheet of instructions on the kitchen counter that said to heat the casserole at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 45 minutes to an hour; it was only 2:00 p.m., and we weren’t supposed to eat until 6:00 p.m.

I felt uneasy as Mr. Lickety-Split told me to turn the dial on the oven all the way to the right, past 450 and then 500 degrees. I didn't know what temperature it was normal to cook at, at that age, but 500 sounded high to me. Still, I did as he commanded. He rewarded me with a smile after I completed each little step – brought the chair over from the kitchen table to the stove, stood atop it and pressed the temperature dial in to engage it, and so on. There was something *special* about Mr. Lickety-Split’s grin. It was like he was stroking the pleasure centers in my brain a little bit, giving me a surge of dopamine; almost like a drug, although I didn’t know what that felt like yet, of course.

Mr. Lickety-Split helped ease Jeanine into a comfortable nap so that she didn’t notice the smoke that emerged from the kitchen -- first in tentative tendrils, then in dense, billowing clouds. He showed me how to hold a pillowcase over my mouth so that the smoke wouldn’t bother me so much, and he pointed out a spot by the window where I was able to get fresh air and relieve my stinging eyes.

The smoke detectors finally woke Jeanine up at around 5:30 p.m. By then, the kitchen was so filled with smoke that she couldn’t even enter it, not even with her shirt over her face. She looked at me like she expected me to know what to do; I could tell that she was terrified -- not of me getting hurt, but of her getting in trouble.

Mr. Lickety-Split laughed his merry cackle as Jeanine used her cell phone to call 911, yanking my arm as she led me outside. Mr. Lickety-Split didn’t like how rough she was with me, so he made sure that Jeanine tripped on her way down the front steps.

My parents weren’t too happy with Jeanine, either: They berated her with phrases like “totally negligent” and “suspect you of using drugs” as the firemen ran in and out of the house like busy worker ants. Jeanine didn’t even look back or say goodbye to me when she got picked up an hour later. Her makeup was smudged for a different reason on her way out, I noticed.

Without a babysitter, my parents started staying home a lot more on the weekends. One day, Mr. Lickety-Split adopted his iconic “shh” pose before leading me from the English formal garden in our backyard into the kitchen through the mud room. My parents had asked me to stay outside for a couple of hours, but Mr. Lickety-Split had grown bored.

We creeped up the service staircase that accessed the second-floor hall. I knew that I wasn’t supposed to be up there on a Saturday morning, and I had a vibrating-stomach feeling that made me worry that I would puke or have diarrhea.

We emerged at the top of the stairs, and Mr. Lickety-Split crossed the hall and inched open the door of my parents’ bedroom in that soundless way of his.

I heard Mom screaming, and I almost rushed in to see what was wrong. But Mr. Lickety-Split held me back.

*They’re just having some grownup fun,* he assured me. He pointed into the bedroom, where the heavy damask curtains had been drawn.

My mom was laying naked on the end of the bed, I saw, and my dad was kneeling on the carpet at the foot of the bed with his head leaning in toward her stomach. This pose struck me as so funny that I almost started giggling, but Mr. Lickety-Split silenced me with another stern gesture. I saw Daddy kiss Mom’s stomach and then reach down and do something between her thighs.

Somehow, I knew that it was wrong for me to watch this. It was like showering or going to the bathroom, I realized; something private that only rude or bad people would want to view.

“Those brownies were good,” Mommy moaned as Daddy kept licking her down there. I realized that I was grabbing myself down there, too; it felt like I had to pee.

*Come on, let’s go,* I told Mr. Lickety-Split, and we raced back down the stairs. For the rest of the day, I searched for those brownies. My mom mentioning them had triggered a craving in me, and I scoured the refrigerator, the oven, even the glass-covered serving dish on the coffee table in the living room that Mommy sometimes filled with treats for guests.

Mr. Lickety-Split said that he didn’t know where the brownies were, but I knew that he was lying. He did that, sometimes.

The first time that I saw the other side of Mr. Lickety Split – the very not nice side – was during the summer after sixth grade, when I was 12.

By now, I knew that Mr. Lickety Split wasn’t going away. A couple of years earlier, Mom and Dad had sent me to an expensive child psychiatrist who asked me about Mr. Lickety-Split. He was a short little guy with a bowling ball belly and tufts of black hair coming out of his ears and nostrils, and his office smelled like peppermint. He asked me about when I met Mr. Lickety-Split; what the two of us talked about; if Mr. Lickety-Split had anything to do with God; if Mr. Lickety-Split told me to do things; and so on. I answered every question exactly as Mr. Lickety-Split told me to, and the psychiatrist assured my parents that I knew that Mr. Lickety-Split wasn’t real, that I had simply invented him to cope with my loneliness – a sign of an active, creative mind and a *rich inner world*, as he put it. Mr. Lickety Split said that this was exactly the kind of thing that they said before they decided you were crazy and locked you away forever, and that we had to be very careful to hide him from then on.

My dad had given me the responsibility of mowing our gigantic lawn once a week for the summer. He’d promised me 20 bucks a month, which was an unthinkable sum of money for me at the time – equal to eight comic books, 12.5 slices of pizza, or three movies with popcorn and a drink. I didn’t mind forcing our rusty old push mower over all of the hills and divots; to tell you the truth, I liked proving to Mom and Dad that I was strong enough to handle it.

Mr. Lickety-Split had never cared for Oscar and Neon. He said that he didn’t like it when the cats woke me up by using me as a springboard and landing pad in the middle of the night; he claimed that it interfered with my ability to sleep, to grow. But I knew that this was only part of the story. Those cats hated Mr. Lickety-Split – they went berserk every time he showed up, hissing and crying up a storm – and I knew by now that Mr. Lickety-Split resented, *detested* anything that took my attention away from him.

*The cats have to go, Josh,* he notified me as I swung the mower around at the border between our yard and the woods that surrounded it.

*Go where?* I asked him, distracted by the elegant chiaroscuro show of light streaming through the trees in the forest.

*You need to get rid of the cats.* Mr. Lickety Split put the *get rid of* into my head in bold and italics. He said it in such a way that I knew unequivocally what he meant.

*No no no* I begged him. I loved those cats.

*All good things come to an end, Josh,* Mr. Lickety-Split chided me. *And this way, we'll have even more time together.*

*And it’s time to get rid of those ugly, irksome cats / rhymes with spats / rhymes with gnats / rhymes with rats / rhymes with brats / rhymes with SPLAT (rhymes with vats of blood and slats of wood in a coffin).*

Mr. Lickety-Split got carried away like that, sometimes.

*No no no* I insisted.

*I’ll take them to the pound,* I promised.

*Not good enough,* Mr. Lickety-Split told me.

*Remember what I told you, Josh: Never question me. Don’t make me show you what happens if you do.*

Next, Mr. Lickety-Split did something he had never done before. It wasn’t that he *entered* or *invaded* my mind; he had already been there for a long time, I realized. Except now, instead of being a harmless passenger, a backseat driver, Mr. Lickety split took the wheel.

At first, he found it awkward to move my gangly teenage body. My arms and legs were moved jerkily, spastically. I prayed that my Mom or Dad would see from the kitchen window, assume that I was having a seizure, and run out to save me. Anything to interrupt what was going on. At first, I fought him, hard. I ordered every nerve and muscle cell that he attempted to control to do the opposite of whatever Mr. Lickety-Split was commandeering them to accomplish. But that wore me out much faster than I could’ve anticipated.

And it wasn’t just that. Mr. Lickety-Split was able to do other… things. He put pictures in my head, for instance. Pictures of me doing things to myself that are so twisted, so awful that I won’t even describe them. Pictures of me doing things to other people that are even worse.

Eventually, when I couldn’t resist any longer, Mr. Lickety-Split hunted down the cats. They ran like bandits when they realized who was with me. With the help of treats and my own traitorous, soothing voice, Mr. Lickety-Split was able to coax them out of their hiding spot in the garage. He stuffed them into a single cat carrier and headed back out to the yard.

I watched - screaming myself hoarse internally even though I couldn’t make a sound - as Mr. Lickety-Split walked back to the edge of the forest. In those dreadful moments, I prayed fervently for the power to close my eyelids, for the grace not to see. But it was my curse to watch - a quaking, forlorn bystander to a nightmare within a nightmare - as Mr. Lickety-Split got his revenge on Oscar and Neon: He hummed “London Bridge is Falling Down” as he flipped the lawnmower over, leaving it running as he threw first Oscar, then Neon into its whirling blades. Sheets of blood and chunks of tissue spun out in a hellish arc as Mr. Lickety-Split used *my* body to kill my cats, my friends. At one point, something small and solid ricocheted off the blades with a *ping* before hitting me in the cheek. I wiped the spot reflexively, then looked down and saw my palm coated in gore. I searched the grass in front of me and found it: It was a section of jawbone with several teeth still attached.

*See, Josh,* Mr. Lickety-Split declared, *you and I can have fun in so many ways.*

I realized with a shame and horror beyond description that it was my own hands that had wrought this horror; my own legs that carried me to and from accomplishing this Devil's work.

Mr. Lickety-Split grinned psychotically. He’d developed a lazy eye recently, I observed. These days, something had entered his grin that sent centipedes wriggling up and down my spine.

There were times when Mr. Lickety-Split proved himself an invaluable friend, of course. When my first boyfriend posted the intimate photos that I had sent him on a dirty website, then opened it on the SmartBoard screen during the homeroom period that he and I were both in, I knew that Mr. Lickety-Split wouldn’t let that ride. For once, I didn't resist him as he made his plans.

Mr. Lickety-Split ordered me to get some pills from the dealer in my class – told me what to ask for and how much to pay – and then explained how to grind them up with a bit of sugar. Under his direction, I added the powder to Adam’s drink during homeroom the next day. I waited 30 minutes and then texted him a message saying *I’m so horny, babe; I don’t care about what you did; let’s meet in the supply closet and have fun for old time’s sake.*

Adam followed his dick to the supply closet, where I started giving him pleasure in the way that he preferred (without getting too crass, it was orally). Adam moaned as I performed the usual routine. Mr. Lickety-Split retrieved my phone from my pocket and reached out my arm so that he could record what I was doing. I assumed that he wanted to show my entire class what a tiny dill pickle Adam had for a member, but a moment later, I felt Mr. Lickety-Split take control of my body. Before I could realize what was happening or even consider resisting, it was over. Mr. Lickety-Split had bitten down ferociously – not hard enough to sever the tip, exactly, but hard enough to scar and to keep Adam from any kind of amorous fun for months and months (or so I heard). The best part was that Adam never admitted to the school what happened or who did it; he was too afraid that I’d post the video online and that he’d go viral.

One day of my junior year, Mr. Lickety-Split sat me down for a talk.

*We’ve been good friends for years now, Josh, and you’re growing up into a fine young man. You’re 16, going on 17; you’ve had your first love, your first hate, your first kills – your first everything, really. You’re growing up, and it’s time for you to be more independent. For* us *to have more freedom.*

At first, I thought that Mr. Lickety-Split wanted us to run away.

*You know who stands between us and the freedom that we want, that we need,* Mr. Lickety-Split clarified. What he had planned dawned on me; my guts, all the way from my stomach to the other end, felt as though they had been pumped full of lead.

***No,*** I insisted, I resisted, I screamed inside. Just **no.**

*You know what happens when you resist me,* Mr. Lickety-Split answered in a quiet, even tone that was infinitely scarier than any bellow he could’ve mustered.

Over the following weeks, Mr. Lickety-Split made sure that I never slept. As soon as I started to drift off, he’d shout some threat or obscenity in my head. All day I heard his muttering, a susurrant hell-track that took me to the edge of my sanity.

*You’re nothing. You’ve never been anything and you never will. Your father curses the day that he and seven other men sprayed their seed on your mother, the gaping whore.*

*You’re nothing. You’re never been anything and you never will. All your friends talk behind your back about how weak, how ugly, how pathetic you are. Even your teachers don’t like you: They can barely hide their contempt.*

When I did collapse into short stretches of sleep, the dreams that Mr. Lickety-Split put into my head were ineffably frightening – scenes from other dimensions where the Devil is God and breakfast is made from meat harvested from living, terrified donors strapped down to the kitchen table, fully awake and given nothing for pain as the diners make their choices and their meat is carved up, cooked, and served… Places where children’s pain is like caviar, where tricking confused elderly people never fails to give a kick. Sometimes in these dreams, Mr. Lickety-Split would make me *do* things. Abominable things, the very worst. And he would slow down time so that a 15-minute nap could encompass three months of horror.

*I can make it go on forever, Josh,* he’d tease me in his sick sing-song. *What do you think it feels like to go insane? Or you can choose to end this right now.*

I thought about “ending this right now” in the other way, but every time I so much as considered it, Mr. Lickety-Split took control before I could raise a finger to harm myself (although he would force me to burn myself with the cigarettes that I’d started chain smoking or stand in the shower under boiling hot water as punishment for resisting him).

And so, as I turned 18, I prepared to murder my parents. Mr. Lickety-Split developed a very intricate, cunning plan for how to accomplish this in such a way that we ended up getting the house and my parents’ sizable death benefits to party with; it hinged on framing Jeanine for the crime.

Even now, I can’t bring myself to recount the details. Suffice it to say that I remember every twisted second of that accursed day. Drugging my parents so that they fell asleep early. Kidnapping Jeanine while she headed out for a date with a guy she met online (who happened to be Mr. Lickety Split).

*Then Lickety-Splitting / ripping / hitting / whipping / chipping (their skulls so strong so fine) / slitting (their throats so fun so wide).*

After Jeanine had “committed suicide,” Mr. Lickety-Split made me call in the murders, ordering me to pretend that I had come back from work and discovered the scene. My screams of terror and anguish were real, of course; I didn’t have to fake a thing.

As we finished providing our statement, Mr. Lickety-Split was growing tired; I could sense it - a slowing down that was separate, more severe than the one affecting my own body and mind. It cost him a lot to maintain control for this long, I knew. Mr. Lickety-Split didn’t say anything, just then; just relaxed as he issued a long, contented sigh.

The detective ordered me to write down my version of events before they released me.

My moment had arrived: I grabbed hold of the pen and began to write. Mr. Lickety-Split tried to stop me, but he had underestimated me, doubting that I had any capacity left to resist him (an impression that I had carefully cultivated and then reinforced through minor incidents in the preceding weeks). Before he could stop me, I began committing to paper what had really happened. I used every ounce of my energy to focus on the words that I was writing even as Mr. Lickety-Split screamed over them in my mind.

Mr. Lickety-Split threw the pen across the room; the detective calmly handed me another. I kept writing even as Mr. Lickety-Split grew louder, more frantic in my mind, screaming threats and obscenities. He was panicked, I realized, and a surge of hope set me to scribbling ever faster.

A moment later, Mr. Lickety-Split grabbed the pen from me and stabbed it through my left hand; it passed through the smooth skin below my middle finger and protruded out the other side. Frantic, I explained to the Detective what was going on – that there was an evil entity controlling me, which had committed the murders, and that if I didn’t get the truth down on paper now, I might never be able to – and he let me continue writing. Mr. Lickety-Split wept in defeat as I signed our name to the confession:

Josh \_\_\_\_\_

Alias Mr. Lickety-Split

They gave me a pretty nice cell, all things considered. The press called me a monster, but a jury of my peers judged me to be an insane monster, so I was sent to a secure psychiatric facility rather than a prison. I’m kept in solitary confinement, of course; after that incident with the orderly who wears an eye patch now early on in my stay here, I’m only allowed out of my cell for an hour a day. And I'll never, ever be released, of course; that much is a given.

I take my meals in my cell, and for the most part, I am content. I beat Mr. Lickety-Split; he can’t hurt anyone else ever again. I remind myself of that when the memories rise up to the surface and things get too dark. I pass the time with books and writing, and they take me to other places, other times, other lives; through them, I swim, I fly, I travel back to a time before all of this horror. In time, I even earned the privilege of a small TV.

Mr. Lickety-Split is furious with me, of course, but there is little that he can do. He’s invented a thousand ways to punish me by making me cut, burn, and punch myself, but whenever he gets carried away, the orderlies step in and strap us down. There’s a nice one named Bob who sits by the bed and reads to me on days when that happens, and it feels good – like I’m young again, with Mom and Dad both coming to my bedroom to read to me while I fall asleep. My dreams are what I dread the most, but even there, Mr. Lickety-Split’s power is diminished; he knows that I know that he can’t really make it worse anymore.

My biggest concern is that when I die, Mr. Lickety-Split will simply transfer himself over to a new friend. He hasn't aged a day since the day I met him, and he's hinted at such a possibility before. So, if you or someone you love - a child, a nephew, a friend - come across a benevolent, mischievous imaginary friend - getting on in years, dressed a bit like the quintessential British butler - kindly turn and ***run*** the other way.

This is the story of me and my friend Mr. Lickety-Split. I believe that I have done my best in the course of these trials and these terrors, and only God will be the true judge of me.
