A few weeks ago, my wife and I went on a road trip for a family reunion in El Paso, Texas.  I am now sitting in the hospital waiting room, desperately wishing we hadn't...



“How much longer?” Melanie asked, leaning her seat back and putting her hand into the small of her back in a feeble attempt to find a more comfortable position.

“Google says we’ve got a few more hours to go,” I said, glancing quickly at my phone sitting in the cup holder then putting my eyes back to the road.  “Do we need to stop again?”

Melanie shifted in her seat a bit, removed her hand from behind her, then sat it back up to its original vertical position.  At seven months pregnant, her options for “comfort” were quickly dwindling, and none of them involved the front seat of a car.  “No, let’s just go.  If we stop again I’m not going to want to get back into the car.”

*“SIGNAL LOST”* my phone’s robotic female voice announced.  

“God dammit…” I sighed.  The phone had been doing that for the past couple of hours at increasing intervals.  There had apparently been an accident or something on the main highway which would have backed us up by at least an hour according to the all-knowing Google.  In order to avoid that, we’d taken a detour that snaked around the accident through the desert on a two-lane highway.  That had been three hours ago, maybe more - it was hard to keep track of when it had happened because even before the phone had alerted us of the accident the whole trip had been little more than a pallet of browns and grays broken up only by the regular bathroom break.  As I saw it, the New Mexico desert was the skid mark on the underpants of America, and if I never had the pleasure of driving through it again it would be too soon.

The sun had set about an hour ago, not long before the signal started getting more spotty, and the highway hypnosis had really started to get to me.  There was nothing but desert on either side of us, and even with the high beams on the darkness covered us like a thick blanket.

“Got any more RedBull?” I asked.  “If we’re gonna go for a few more hours, I need some wings.”

Melanie reached into the back seat for a second, grunting with discomfort, then returned with a can of RedBull.  “Last one,” she said.  “This was sitting on the seat, so the sun warmed it up for you.”

“Great,” I said, taking the can, cracking the seal, and swallowing three large gulps.  “This will sit well with all the other junk I’ve been eating for the past two days.”

Without a baby on the way, Mel and I could have driven the stretch between Bozeman and El Paso in two days without a problem, but with her being as pregnant as she was, we had to carve out almost double the time and she was still miserable.

I let out a burp that tasted like all the atrocious snacks and truck-stop food from that day mixed with the warm energy drink I was layering on top and solemnly promised myself I would eat nothing but salad and water for the rest of my life.

TURN LEFT HERE FOR THE CHURCH OF CHRIST

“I thought the Church of Christ was back there,” Mel said, reading the dilapidated sign as we passed it.

“No, that was the church of *Jesus* Christ,” I said.  “Big difference, apparently.”

All through the drive  we’d seen a wide variety of local churches, mostly generic, but after passing one called “The Church of Liberty” over a backdrop of a poorly-drawn confederate flag, we had turned it into a sort of game to see who could find the most outlandish one.

We sat in silence for a while, listening to the hum of the engine and the intermittent *Signal Lost* notification from my phone.  I had looked at the phone earlier when the signal was stronger and saw that we just needed to go to the end of this road, turn right, and we’d find ourselves getting back onto the freeway, so although the intermittent announcement from the cupholder was annoying, I wasn’t particularly concerned.

That was until we saw a sign that said “*Freeway Entrance - Left - 1 Mile*.”

“I thought you said it was a right at the end of the road,” Melanie said, sitting up and grabbing the phone.

“That’s what it said,” I insisted.  “I checked it last time we had service like half an hour ago.  We had about sixty or so miles to go and then it was a right.”

“How sure are you?” she asked, putting the phone back into the cup holder.  “Cause your phone is still saying it has no service so it’s not going to be any help.”

“Pretty damn…” I said.  Just then we passed another sign *‘Freeway Entrance - Left - .5 Mile.’*’  

“At least, I think so…”

“I think we should follow the signs,” Mel said.  “I don’t wanna get lost out here and the phone hasn’t had consistent service in a while.  It could have reset and changed routes or something to have us avoid the highway - remember last time?”

I DID remember last time - a Vegas trip that ended up being four hours longer than it should have been because my phone reset and had us taking frontage roads and city streets.  It would have been longer had Mel not thought to check the route on her phone.  

I was sure that I had seen it was taking us back to the highway, and that the next turn was a right in about thirty minutes or so given our current speed, but with the evidence to the contrary quickly approaching me in the darkness, illuminated by my headlights, I made the single most critical mistake that I would regret for the rest of my life.

I followed the street sign and turned left.

Mel leaned back in her seat, embarking again on her quest for a comfortable position, and I continued to stare at the lines in the road as we passed.

Time begins to lose meaning when you’ve been on the road in the dark for as long as we were that night.  It could have been hours that we spent speeding straight down the desert road, or it could have been days.  With no focal point, it was really up to the clock alone to tell us how long we’d been there, and the clock on the dashboard had inexplicably reset at some point - something it did on occasion for most of the time I’d owned the car - another bullet for Melanie to fire at me whenever we got into our marital spats.  I didn’t care, and she really didn’t either, but it was another straw to load up on the camel’s back nonetheless.

My faith in the phone had begun to waver even further, as I was becoming sure even that clock was running slow somehow.  We’d go for five or six miles according to the odometer, and the clock would read only a minute or two had passed.

I drained the last bit of RedBull down my throat, again promising myself nothing but clean eating after this trip was over.  Moments later I felt a dull pressure in my bowels - the last drop of liquid must have been the last straw for my bladder.  Mel slept quietly next to me, having finally crashed a while back, and I made the second decision I would come to regret.

Although we hadn’t seen another car for miles, I flipped my hazard lights on and pulled over to the side of the road.  I turned off the car and stepped out of the car and relieved myself, relishing one of the finer points of being a man and having the ability to take a leak in the middle of the road without much fanfare and returned to the car.

Mel stirred then and asked if we were there yet.  “Not yet. Just a bit further - had to take a leak.”

She rolled her eyes and closed them again.

I turned the key to start the car back up and heard a sound that sunk my heart into my stomach.

*Click Click Click Click.*

“Aww shit,” I said under my breath.  “Please don’t do this.”

I turned the key again and once more heard the series of clicks telling me that my car didn’t have enough power to start back up.

“Fuck…” I sighed, resting my head against the steering wheel in defeat.

“What’s wrong?” Mel asked, opening one eye.

“Battery’s dead.”

“What?” There was a hint of panic in her voice and she sat back up, totally awake now.  “But the car was just running.”

“Yeah, it was running off of the alternator.  The battery needs just enough power to start, then the car can run off of the power generated by the alternator.  All we need is a jump and we should be able to get the rest of the way, as long as we don’t turn the car off.”

“But who’s gonna jump us?” Mel asked.  “When was the last time you saw a car?”

“It’s been a while,” I admitted.  “Definitely not since we made that turn back there.”

“Fuck,” Mel spat.  “Fuck fuck *fuck*.”

“Stay here,” I said, unbuckling my seatbelt.

“Where are you going?” she asked, the panic in her voice rising.

“Just up there,” I said, pointing down the road.  “I think I see a sign maybe a hundred yards out there.  It might give us an idea of which direction we need to go or if we need to just wait until the sun comes up.”

I could tell she didn’t like it, but she didn’t say anything.

“I’ll keep my flashlight on so you can see where I am.  I’ll just go there, then straight back.”

She nodded.

“Unless I see a Denny’s, then you’re on your own.”

She flipped me off, I kissed her cheek, and stepped out into the night.

The air was brisk, despite having been downright hot during the day, and I remembered learning in science class as a kid that desert wildlife had to be tough enough to endure not only the heat during the day, but the cold, sometimes freezing temperatures at night as well.  I shivered and hugged my arms around my torso and made my way down the road to where I thought I’d seen a road sign.

As I approached, I realized it wasn’t the kind of sign I was hoping for.  It was made of cracked wood that looked just a little better than the sign for the church we’d seen a while back and on it painted in white letters it read: “Gomper’s Farm” above a crudely drawn arrow pointing down a dirt path to the right.  My gaze followed the arrow and I thought I could see a light far off in the distance.

A scream broke through the darkness that turned my blood to ice.

“Mel?” I called, wheeling around and bolting back the way I came.  “Melanie!”

I could see the shape of the car in the distance, but it was too far away for my flashlight to do much good.  I sprinted down the road screaming my wife’s name in a hot panic.

“What? What?” Melanie called back, alarmed.

I slowed when I heard her voice and held the light up again.  She was standing on the passenger’s side of the car with the door open.

“I thought I heard you screaming,” I said through heaving breaths.

She looked around, confused.  “No…”

“You didn’t hear that?” I asked.

She shook her head.  “No, I don’t think so.  I was in the car until I heard you yelling though.  Where did it come from?”

“I don’t know,” I said, shaking my head and spitting the bitter flavor of adrenaline into the dirt.

“Maybe it was an animal or something,” she suggested.  “What did the sign say?”

“There’s a farmhouse or something about a mile down the road I think,” I explained.  “It’s not exactly ideal, but if I jog it I could make it in about ten minutes or so.  If anyone’s there, all they’d have to do is give me a ride back and help us jump the car.  If nobody’s there, we’ll probably have to wait till morning unless a car happens to pass by.”

She mulled it over for a moment, then I saw the resolve on her face and I knew what was coming next.

“I’m going with you then.”

I didn’t like it, but I could tell that arguing wasn’t going to get me anywhere but the dog house, and considering the scream I heard, or thought I heard anyway, I preferred having her close.  “Fine,” I agreed.  “Grab your jacket though.  I’m gonna grab mine and a couple of water bottles from the back.”

A moment later we were hiking down the road, our silhouettes illuminated intermittently by the orange hazard lights we’d elected to leave on.  I doubted the battery would last if those lights were on too long, but if someone was driving past I would hate for them to miss it.  Mel had thought to leave a note on the windshield telling whomever found it that we’d gone to the farmhouse and would be back shortly.  If anyone was kind enough to stop, they’d hopefully see the letter and stick around long enough to help - that or they’d know where to look for us coming back so they could take whatever they wanted out of the car before we returned.

There was a cool breeze that played with our hair as we walked; not uncomfortable, but enough to make me zip my jacked up just a bit more.  Mel held the only flashlight we had and the beam bounced up and down in the darkness like a buoy.

The car was barely visible when Mel shrieked so suddenly I nearly tripped on my own foot.

“What? What?” I asked, suddenly panicked.

“Look,” she said, extending her finger past the head of the flashlight.

“What?”

“It’s gone now.  You didn’t see it?”

“No, I was too busy asking myself why I’m hiking with a pregnant banshee.”

“There’s something out there,” she said, ignoring my jab.  “Just past that rock.  I saw a pair of golden eyes.”

“Probably a coyote,” I said, starting to walk again.  “They’re cowards.  If we keep walking and talking, nothing should bug us, especially if we stick to the road here.”

Mel nodded then caught up to me.  “How much longer do you think it’ll be till we get to the farm?”

“Dunno,” I shrugged.  “Ten or fifteen minutes maybe.”

Just then I saw the eyes she was talking about.  Out in the distance, next to a large boulder on the side of the road, sat a pair of curious golden eyes.

“Definitely a coyote,” I said, pointing at it.  “You can see its shape a bit - all fours, low to the ground.  It looks like it might be a little bit bigger than the ones I’ve seen, but there’s not much else out here that looks like that.  That’s probably what I heard earlier too - one of these guys catching a rabbit or something.”  I wasn’t sure I believed it, but it felt good to get some sort of explanation on the record.

We kept talking as we walked down the path, closer to the eyes, and when they disappeared I was a bit disappointed, but not surprised.  Part of me wanted to see the coyote up close, but if we got close enough to see it, that probably meant we were close to a den, which is the last place we’d want to find ourselves.

We talked about what we’d do when we finally got home and how soon we’d find ourselves laughing about the whole ordeal when Mel stopped suddenly in the middle of the road.  “Shit.”

“What is it now?” I asked, looking around another pair of eyes.

“I have to pee.”

“No chance you can hold it?” I asked, holding back a chuckle at the poor timing.

“Not unless you can talk this kid out of using my bladder as a water bed,” she replied, handing me the flashlight.  “Where should I go?”

“Why not right here?”

“Are you kidding?”

“Not even a little bit,” I said.  “You probably shouldn’t wander too far off the trail, and it’s not like anyone’s around to see you anyway.  Hell, if someone showed up and the universe decided NOW was the time to embarrass you, I’d still take that over the rest of the walk.”

“Fine,” she sighed, pulling her maternity pants down and squatting.

As she did her business, I took the opportunity to scan the surroundings with the flashlight.  I found a few more pairs of golden eyes on either side of the road, which quickened my pulse just a little.  I didn’t like being outnumbered, and I liked being surrounded even less.

Melanie finished her business and with some assistance from me to get back up to a vertical position, we were off again, our feet crunching against the dirt as we walked.

I thought I heard something then, and this time it was my turn to stop.

“What?” Mel asked.

“Shhh,” I said.  

I started again, then stopped.

“What is it?” Mel whispered.  “Another scream?”

“Nothing,” I lied, picking the pace back up.  “Thought I heard a car.”

We walked again in silence, Mel forgetting to keep the conversation going to keep the coyotes back, and me listening too intently to think about topics to discuss.

I knew I’d heard something behind us.  I hadn’t noticed it at first, or maybe it hadn’t been there at first, but after we stopped I could make out the faint sound of footsteps on dirt that stopped almost as soon as we did, and picked up, or so I thought, as soon as we had.  I’d also heard a strange lapping sound just after we started walking again, like something licking the urine off the dirt road.

When the farmhouse came into view the relief between us was palpable.  We had both been too preoccupied with the growing number of eyes on either side of the road that we hadn’t noticed that the light I’d seen from the road had shut off.

It was a small house, but I hadn’t expected much more than what it was given the location.  If it had four walls and a roof I would have been happy, but from the outside I would have guessed that it had at least a few bedrooms, and behind it stood a structure that looked like it may be a detached garage or large shed of some sort.

We approached the house and I was just about to walk up the wooden porch steps when Melanie grabbed my hand.  “Hold on.”

I turned to look at her.  Her eyes were wide and the pupils were so dilated from the darkness they were nearly black.

“What’s wrong?”

“Do you think this is a good idea?”

I rolled my eyes.  “If it wasn’t, you could have said something twenty minutes ago.”

“I know, I mean…” she paused for a second.  “Do you think these people will help us?  We’re strangers in the middle of nowhere and it’s the middle of the night.”

I shrugged.  “I think the worst that can happen is they tell us to leave.  They’ll probably answer the door with a shotgun in hand, but who wouldn’t?”

Melanie nodded and I saw her throat work up and down in a dry, nervous swallow.

I walked up the few steps, the wood creaking beneath my feet, leaving Melanie at the bottom.

I held up my fist and rapped three times on the storm door.

We waited, listening intently for sounds inside the house, but heard nothing.  Instead, I heard what sounded like the soft, padded feet of a coyote in the dirt behind us, but I brushed that away - they were known for being incredibly quiet.

That thought didn’t make me feel much better.

I opened the storm door and knocked again, this time on the wooden door.  The sound carried far better, but again we heard nothing but silence.

“I think we should go,” Melanie said.  “Something isn’t right.”

The knot in my stomach agreed and I turned to leave just as the door opened.

“Who’s there?” a man’s voice said.  He hadn’t turned the light on in the house, so when I turned back around all I could see was a silhouette in the dark, illuminated only by the ambient glow of Melanie’s flashlight that was pointed directly at my back.

“I’m sorry to bother you sir,” I said.  “My name is Matthew Howell and this is my wife Melanie.  Our car died down the road and we were hoping you could give us a jump.”

“No,” the man said under his breath.  “No no no no no.”

“Sorry?” I said, thinking I misheard him.

“Sorry, no, we cannot jump your car tonight, it’ll have to wait until morning.”

“Sir, I’m sorry to impose, but we really can’t-”

A twig snapped behind me - very quiet, but clear nonetheless.

“Please, come inside,” the man said.  “You’ll stay here tonight.”

I turned to look at Melanie, who was already walking up the steps.

The man opened the door wider to let us in and clicked on a light in the hallway, bathing us in a glow that immediately made me feel better.

The farmhouse looked on the inside just as I would have guessed.  It was modestly furnished with what looked like hand-crafted furniture. Paintings of flowers and landscapes adorned striped wallpaper-covered walls that looked like they were most recently renovated in the 70s, and faded area rugs covered wood floors that creaked beneath our feet even with the slightest weight.  

The man who stood before me now looked just like the kind of person who would live in a house like this.  He had thin white hair and a large beard with yellow tobacco stains around his mouth, and he wore a set of beige long johns under a pair of pants held up with suspenders - the outfit of a man who had been disturbed in his bed.  I guessed he was somewhere in his 60s - still reasonably muscular from working on the farm, but well past his prime and settling into the atrophy of old age.  He had been holding a shotgun in one hand and just then put it down and leaned it up against the door frame.

The man turned and called to someone inside the house.  “Ma!  Put a kettle on, would ya?  We’ve got two here for the night!”

“Really,” I said, “I don’t think we can-”

“I insist,” the man said, turning back to me.  “The roads aren’t safe at night.  It’s too easy to get turned around.”

“Yeah, I can see that,” I admitted.  “I thought we were doing well until we saw that sign for the highway back there.”

The man looked at me, and for a brief moment I thought I saw something in his eyes, but before I could make out what it was, it was gone.  “The sign,” was all he said, and gave an understanding nod.

“Do you have a restroom I could use?” Melanie asked, cutting in.

“Yes, down the hall and-” the man stopped when he saw her, and again there was something in his expression I didn’t like, but again I couldn’t make it out before it was gone.  “To the right,” he finished.

Melanie thanked him and made her way to the bathroom.

“We’ll be just around the corner in the kitchen,” the man told her.

He turned and led me around the corner where I now heard someone else bustling about, presumably putting a kettle on.

“My name is Arthur,” the man said, sitting down at the kitchen table.  “This here is Ruthy,” he said, gesturing to a small woman in a white nightgown who was just then lighting the gas stove.

Ruthy turned around and offered me a smile.  “Hello,” she said.  “Did I hear your name is Matthew?”

I nodded.  “Yes, and my wife’s name is Melanie.”

“They’re in the family way,” Arthur told Ruthy.

“Oh dear,” Ruthy said pleasantly.  “How exciting.  How far along is she?”

“Not the word I’d use,” Arthur said under his breath.

“Seven months,” I told her.

“Seven months!” she exclaimed, beaming.  “And where is she now?”

“She’s in the restroom,” I said.

“Oh I’ve got some things for her, let me run and get them,” Ruthy said pleasantly, then disappeared around the corner.

Arthur and I sat in silence for a moment, then I said “are you sure you can’t just give us a jump?  Or do you have a phone I could use?”

He shook his head.  “Sorry, but no.  Ruthy and I don’t go out after dark, and we haven’t had use for a phone in twenty years or more.  We’ll be happy to give you a ride back to your car and get you on your way as soon as the sun’s up.”

“What if we-”

“Listen,” Arthur said seriously, leaning forward.  He again wore the expression I’d seen earlier.  It was one I didn’t understand, but looking back at it now I think my father, who had served in Desert Storm and had seen the expression worn by men as they stood on the other side of a loaded gun but were determined to show courage in the face of fear, would have picked it up in an instant.  “You were with your lady the whole time, right?”

“Ever since the car broke down, yeah,” I said.  “And even before that we’ve been elbow-to-elbow for just about every second for the past two days.”

“Alright, good.”  He leaned back in his chair.  “That’s good.”

“What’s this about?” I asked, and perhaps he would have told me then, although looking back I doubted that he could have, not then, but the tea kettle began to whistle and Ruthy returned quickly to shut it off and poured the contents into four mugs.  Melanie came around the other corner and took a seat next to me.

Ruthy asked us if we took cream or sugar in our tea, which neither of us did, then she brought mugs over with chamomile tea bags steeping in each of them and took a seat next to Arthur.

“We have a guest bedroom at the end of the hall you can use until the morning,” Ruthy said.  “I’m glad you found your way here safely.”

“Yeah,” Melanie said, bobbing her tea bag up and down in the water by the string it was attached to.  “Those coyotes were really giving me the creeps.”

“Coyotes?” Ruthy asked.

“Yeah Ma, coyotes,” Arthur said in a tone that sounded like they’d had the conversation a thousand times.  “I gotta chase ‘em away from the chickens at least a few times a week, you know that.”

She nodded.  “Yes, I just meant I hadn’t seen any tonight was all.”

“Probably because they were all with us,” I said.  “There were about a dozen sets of eyes following us up the road.”

“A dozen you say?” Ruthy asked, surprised.

“Yeah, that’d make sense,” Arthur said.  “They didn’t try to get at ya though, did they?”

“No,” Melanie said, taking a small exploratory sip of her tea, then another larger one, satisfied that it wasn’t too hot.  “They stayed off the road.”

“I think one of them was behind us though, so I don’t think they all stayed off the road,” I said.

Melanie looked at me reproachfully.  “And when did you plan on telling me?”

“As soon as we didn’t have one behind us anymore,” I told her, shrugging.

“They didn’t get too close though?” Arthur asked.

“No, they kept their distance,” I told him.  “I’m pretty sure the closest one was the one behind us, and that was still a ways back I think.”

He nodded and sipped his own mug.  “That’s good.  Those coyotes are serious business.”

“Do you get many of them out here?” Melanie asked.

Arthur ran a hand through his thin silver hair.  “You could say that, I suppose.  More than most, but less than some.  I think they like the chickens we keep in the back - not much else to eat around here that isn’t burrowed away somewhere, so it’s an easy meal if they can get at them before I hear the commotion and fire off a round of two.”

Melanie shivered.  “I’m glad I don’t have to worry about that sort of thing.”

“Where are you folks from?” Arthur asked, sipping at his own mug now.

“Montana,” I said.  “We have coyotes up our way too, but they mostly stay in the more rural parts, and we don’t have chickens or anything to worry about.  I found one rooting around in the garbage though when I was a kid.  I told everyone I thought I saw a wolf.”

“The boy who cried wolf,” Melanie teased, jabbing my side with her elbow.  “That’s Matt alright.”

I rolled my eyes and fiddled with my own tea bag.  I wasn’t one for tea, especially chamomile because it reminded me of being sick as a kid.  My mother swore by her herbal “remedies,” especially those that came in the form of tea.

“Are we really staying the night?” Melanie asked, turning to me.

I looked at Arthur, who gave me a clear, solemn nod.

“Um,” I said.  “Yeah, I guess we are.  It’s late and Arthur and Ruthy say they have a guest room we can stay in for the night.”

“Are you sure?” Melanie asked, turning to Ruthy.  “It won’t be too much trouble?”

Ruthy waved the idea off like a fly.  “None at all.  We haven’t had visitors in… ten years or better.  Not since the Pruitts came for Christmas.  And aside from my boys, you’re the first to come to our door in just about as long.”

“Oh, you have children?” Melanie asked.  

“Long grown now,” Arthur said, nodding and staring into his mug.

“Twins,” Ruthy said, beaming.  “They’re about your age I’d guess.  I’ve got most of their old clothes and things in the back room if you’d like to take a look before you go to bed.  I pulled the chest out of the closet already.”

Melanie looked at me and I gave her a shrug, then she returned Ruthy’s smile and together they made their way further into the house.

“You two are lucky,” Arthur said when the women had left.

“How do you figure?” I asked.

“When the coyotes are hungry, they’ll try to get at just about anything that moves.  If you really had as many watchin’ you as you say, you could have been walking to your own graves.”

I wasn’t sure I believed him, but the shiver that crawled down my spine certainly did.

We sat in silence for a while, listening to the distant voices of our wives talking about children and the tick of an old grandfather clock somewhere in the house when I heard the scream again.  It was coming from outside - somewhere close to the house, but it was hard to tell.  I sat up in my chair, but Arthur didn’t move.

“Birds,” he said flatly.

“Sorry?” I asked.

“We’ve got birds out here that sound like that sometimes,” he said.  “Sound like a lady shriekin’, or sometimes a child cryin’, but it’s just the birds callin’ to each other.”

“Birds? “ 

He nodded.

“What kind of bird sounds like that?”

He shrugged.  “I don’t know.  I heard them called liar birds once, not sure if that was the name or just a fitting description of the things.”

“Yeah,” I said, feeling the name scratch away something on the surface of my brain - a fact buried under the dust and cobwebs in my mind.  “I’ve heard of those, I think.  They can copy other noises like parrots can, right?  I thought they lived in Australia or something.”

Arthur shrugged again.  “Couldn’t say.  I don’t even know if that’s what they are for certain, but I know that the sound we just heard was one of them birds.”

I settled back in my seat, feeling better about the scream I’d heard earlier.  It would have made sense if it came from the air - that could explain why I wasn’t sure where it had come from.

“That reminds me of something that happened to me as a kid.  Nothing like cryin’ wolf, but it was an important lesson I think,” Arthur said, his words careful somehow.

I took a sip of the tea between my palms - not because I wanted it, but because it felt impolite to leave the whole mug full.

“You ever heard of a…” Arthur searched for the word.  “A brood parasite?  I think that’s what they call it.”

I shook my head.

“It’s a kind of bird that leaves its eggs in another bird’s nest.  Sometimes it’ll push the other eggs out, but usually it just leaves their egg there for the other bird to care for.  I heard about these when I was a little boy - maybe eight or so - and I found a robin’s nest with a bunch of little blue eggs and one single black and white speckled one.  I thought I’d found something really special, so every day that spring I would climb that tree to see if it hatched.

“A couple weeks went by and eventually the egg hatched - it was the first one - and I was so excited to see the little black chick inside.

“Not long after the others hatched, and each of them was a little robin that looked nothing like this black bird, which was now twice the size of these other ones.

“The days went by and one day, as I was about to climb the tree, I found one of the baby robins laying in the grass.  I picked it up and climbed back up the tree to find that of the four robins that had started in the tree, there was only one left, and of course my big black bird that was now far larger than the others.  It had started to knock the other birds out of the nest.  I put the chick that I had saved in the grass back into the nest, and do you know what that black bird did?”

I shook my head.

“It killed it right before my eyes.  Tore it apart like it was nothin’.  I ran to tell my father, and that’s when I learned about birds that impose their eggs in others’ nests so that the other birds will raise them.  I thought that-”

A voice outside interrupted us.  It was a cry that almost sounded like it had words this time, but the words were indistinguishable despite the fact that it sounded like it was coming from right outside the window.

Arthur sat bolt upright and turned his head quickly to the window.

He stood from his seat and crossed the room with three large steps.  “I was just tellin’ a story!  Leave us be!”

I couldn’t be certain, but I thought I heard something scurry away in the dirt.

“What was that?” I asked, trying not to sound as nervous as I now felt.

“Them damn coyotes,” Arthur said.

“I thought you said the cries were the birds,” I said.

“Them too,” Arthur said, his tone coming off more annoyed than anything, although there was something else as well.  “The coyotes get curious and the birds get agitated and before I know it this house is the busiest place in all of New Mexico.”

He walked around the house and I heard the door knob shake.  Was he checking the lock?  Then he returned.  “I think it’s best if we call it a night.  Ruthy’ll be up early to make y’all breakfast, but feel free to sleep in as late as you’d like.  In the morning we’ll take the truck down to the road and I’ll jump it for you and you’ll be on your way.”

I took another gulp of tea, trying to get the mug down at least halfway, and agreed.
