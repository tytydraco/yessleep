If I had been paranoid before, now I was even more so, and the worst part was that I couldn’t tell anyone about it. It’s true that the second encounter took place in a public setting, but the shadow of the first one still weighed heavily. How could I explain how—or from where—I knew that guy?  
  
My lack of reaction had been evident from the start. In the bathroom it was more about attraction, until I saw the signs; in the movie theater, it was curiosity and the sense of safety that comes from being in a public place, surrounded by people who even noticed his strange way of walking. And then that liquid on the popcorn…  
  
I spent several days barely eating, disgusted by what had happened. From the moment I noticed the strange substance in the cinema, I couldn’t stop myself from rushing to the bathroom and vomiting. I ran out of the place and stayed awake all night, checking my vital signs and waiting for any signal that would make me call emergency services. At least that viscous liquid wasn’t toxic.  
  
Needless to say, I haven’t set foot in a movie theater again, nor have I eaten popcorn since. As for the man, he remained a complete mystery. All I knew was that he appeared in short films and minor roles in movies no one watched and about which nothing could be found online, and that somehow he was connected to that film archive closely enough to feel comfortable walking all the way into the concession stand.  
  
If it was him who poured that stuff… why was I so sure? Was it paranoia?  
  
What came next would confirm my suspicions.  
  
One week after the movie theater incident, I took a hot shower in the morning before heading to my part-time job. The water felt pleasant; everything was normal until I soaped my lower back. I let out a small cry of pain when I ran the brush over the area and scraped what felt like a pimple. An intense itch and a rash spread across the spot. As best I could, I looked at myself in the mirror and noticed my back was red and densely covered with small welts. In the area I had scraped, I could see blood and yellowish pus.  
  
Days earlier I had already noticed a few small pimples and mild itching, as well as small rashes on other parts of my body, which is why my surprise at seeing myself in that state was so great.  
  
I tried not to panic; after all, they were just welts. I stopped by the pharmacy on my way to work to buy an ointment. I work at a dessert shop, mainly selling bread and cakes.  
  
That day one of our best customers arrived very early—a senior man who had placed an order days before. I went to the back to get the glazed rolls he had ordered for his grandson’s birthday party. When I walked in, I startled several cockroaches that were already beginning to swarm over the pastries.  
  
Just as I grabbed the tray, my back itched so badly that I dropped everything onto the floor. I tried to keep the bugs away, picked up the rolls, and walked out to the counter with them inside the shop’s glamorous branded bag. I handed them to the customer with a smile that hid my desperate urge to scratch myself. I felt awful—not to justify myself, but because of the itching I didn’t realize what I was doing, or I was just trying to get out of trouble quickly so I could keep scratching. If I remember correctly, I even came up short in the register that day.  
  
As soon as the customer left, I ran to the back and applied the ointment I had bought earlier. It did nothing. The itching wouldn’t stop. I felt desperate; I thought about apologizing to my supervisor and going to the emergency room.  
  
The door opened and I returned to the counter before my supervisor could scold me. At that moment, it was just him and me in the shop. I swear that, almost as if he had been waiting for me, the strange man appeared before me for the third time.  
  
From the moment he arrived, I knew that this encounter—and perhaps none of the other two—had been a coincidence. I felt like confronting him, even hitting him, but my supervisor had spent the entire morning checking the display cases for cockroach eggs and had stepped out minutes earlier to buy cleaning supplies.  
  
The man, dressed in dark clothes, completely covered and with his eerie air, looked at me with an affliction that, to my mind, seemed rehearsed. He brought his hands to his back, as if miming that he knew what was happening to me.  
  
It didn’t strike me as strange that my condition was connected to him. Before I could say anything, he pulled an ointment out of his pants pocket—the same one I had noticed during our encounter in the bathroom. He said, in his warm but carefully measured voice:  
  
“From now on, you’ll need this as much as the air you breathe.”  
  
And he left, leaving me with more questions than answers.  
  
The rash and the welts didn’t stop. Nothing I used managed to slow them down. In fact, I had to start wearing dark clothes to hide the stains of pus and blood left behind when the welts burst from friction. Ironically, the only remedy that gave me any relief was the ointment the stranger had given me.  
  
At first I refused to use it, but when nothing else brought relief, I applied it to a small area. When I noticed it soothed the itching, I spread it over a larger area, and so on. That was when I recognized the man’s smell, which was now also mine: the ointment mixed with the odor of infection from the welts. What had that man done to me? Not even the two doctors I had visited so far could give me a clear answer.  
  
They talked to me about allergies, opportunistic infections, stress, a possible bacterial infection, even something autoimmune. Nothing they prescribed worked. The only thing that helped was that cream-colored ointment the creature had given me. One of the doctors mentioned that if I didn’t improve, they would have to hospitalize me.  
  
Within weeks I began to eat and sleep very little. I lost a lot of weight; dark circles formed under my eyes, my skin grew pale, and the welts spread to other parts of my body, forcing me to start wearing long sleeves, gloves, and buttoning my clothes all the way up. In short, little by little I was turning into the strange man. I dressed like him, scratched like him, and smelled like him. While doctors ran endless tests on me, I continued with my normal life as if nothing were happening, despite others’ confusion at seeing me act, dress, and smell so strangely.  
  
My parents, my girlfriend, my friends… everyone was worried by my evasiveness. I look at myself in the mirror and see my skin covered in welts, and I can think of nothing but my social death just around the corner. Even the soles of my feet filled with welts that burst with every step, causing pain when I walked, so I began to lift my feet slightly, almost on tiptoe, as if I were wearing invisible high heels.
