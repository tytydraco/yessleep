After I would say around 12 hours we arrived at our destination. It was a small airport just outside of Lublin. The fathead, suits, and us from the university got off the plane and were met with more men in suits, though these ones were wearing overcoats. The fathead approached them in a professional manner and shook the hand of one of them. In fact, his whole interaction with them looked totally professional. Guess us lowly doctors (and master’s degree holder) aren’t worth professionalism. The fathead then came back to us and said “Alright, the coats over there need all your ID’s. Go on, chop chop.” He clapped his hands. The five of us from the university were pretty fed up with this guy but we went over to the people dressed in overcoats regardless. We presented our IDs without word and the overcoats extensively checked them. The others were given their IDs back after a couple of seconds, but my overcoat was spending a considerable amount of time on mine, looking back and forth from me to my ID to some kind of tablet they were using that scanned the IDs.

Though after a minute or he handed my ID back to me, slowly. Before I could grab it, the overcoat tripped me but then caught me. It was at that moment he said something quick into my ear. He said “Wenn Sie die richtige Antwort gefunden haben, rufen Sie sie laut.” German? I expected there to be other countries looking into this site, but security details are meant to be handled by the host nation. The weirdest part was when he lifted me back up he yelled at me in Polish “Uważaj na swoje nogi!” which roughly translates to “Watch your legs!” Despite this incident I was cleared, and the other overcoats motioned me to and the others from the university to go to another set of SUVs.

The fathead was waiting by the SUVs, but he was put into his own. Our luggage was also being brought with us it seemed. No hotel? Maybe we’re going to sleep on sight in campers. We were loaded up and began driving but we only drove for like ten minutes until we reached some place in the woods. At the place there were a couple of Tarpan Honkers, basically the Polish version of a Humvee but this model was lighter and without the machine gun on top, some more people in overcoats and a squad of Polish soldiers.

We stopped and one of the soldiers went up to the SUV with the fathead in it. They exchanged words and the other soldiers began circling the over vehicles, including mine. One stared directly at me. I then heard a muffled yell. The soldier looked over to the first SUV with the fathead in it, nodded and then opened my door. He said “Out.” in a thick Polish accent and, being rather skittish due to the circumstances, I immediately did as he said. The soldier slammed the door to the SUV and then escorted me to one of the Honkers.

I looked over and saw the others from the university were also getting escorted in a similar way. This time we were all put into the back of one vehicle. Kal looked very angry about this but was holding it in with a very unamused look on her face. The other three just seemed more shook up than anything. I lost track of the fathead. Two soldiers got into the front part of the Honker and started it up.

Suddenly a soldier wearing a black barrette with the Polish Land Forces eagle on it appeared behind the Honker in front of us and spoke in a less thick but still noticeable Polish accent “I am Plutonowy Greg (Not his real name). You probably wondering why you are being escorted by the army. I will explain along the way, but for now I will lay down some ground rules. You are guests here in Poland and we will protect you, but you are to in no way compromise the safety of my soldiers or to disobey any order given by them. If you break any of these two rules, you will be immediately arrested or shot. Is that understood?” I gulped but nodded. I didn’t bother looking at the others, but I think they did the same cause Greg smiled and said “Welcome to Poland, hamburgers!” He then hopped on the Honker and banged on the side of it. We then began moving and Greg took a seat right next to me.

“Ok, now I tell you why the guns.” Greg said to us. “I’m sure you know about war in Ukraine. Well, Białoruski not much better. Sometimes incidents happen so close to the border, and especially since you are hamburgers, we thought it best to take no chances.” Almost as if on que we heard gunfire in the distance. “Hah!” Greg let out a laugh “See what I mean?” He slapped my arm. I nodded sheepishly. Suddenly, Kal, who was sitting right next to me, spoke up and asked what everyone was thinking, “Where the hell are we going anyways?”

Gregs playful expression suddenly turned serious. “Guess no one’s told you. Ok, listen up. This was just recently discovered. It is very close to border and surprisingly well intact. It is a bunker, we think.” For once one of the others spoke up. Doctor Mobius asked, “You think?” Greg shrugged “We were given orders to not go in until you people arrive on site.” The five of us from the university looked at each other puzzled. I understood that heritage sites are usually left untouched until professionals arrive on site but usually the military is an exception to this rule. Then again, the military rarely gets involved with such things, so this might be something more. I don’t know whether to be excited, or worried. I know now that the answer was worried.

We eventually arrived at our destination. We rolled up to a concrete structure smack dab in the middle of the forest. It looked exactly like a bunker used by the Germans during World War 2, though slowly being overtaken by nature. There was something unique about it though. On these bunkers there is usually a thin opening for soldiers to look and shoot out of. On this one though, there were three circular holes on the top of it. Sometimes these bunkers have holes as well for machine guns, but they’re small for protection.

These didn’t look like they provided much cover as they were rather large. I’d say a person could easily climb through it. Additionally, there was what looked like a garage next to the bunker. From a distance it looked like… like the Powerpuff Girls house. “No…” I thought to myself at the time. “I’m just overthinking this. Get the Powerpuff Girls off your head man, this is serious.” I mean, the Powerpuff Girls house was inspired by the Villa Arpel in Jacques Tati's 1958 film Mon Oncle, right? I was right about one thing though, this was serious. Surrounding the bunker were more soldiers. The weirdest thing though, there were American soldiers. I study a lot of military history and modern as well so I’m pretty good at identifying military uniforms. Though it really didn’t matter considering the soldiers had the flag of the USA on their shoulders and helmets.

“What the hell?” Kal said looking at the soldiers. The other three boys and I from the university were looking at the soldiers as if we were children seeing someone with a gun in person for the first time. Greg hopped off the Honker and ordered us to, “Wait here.” He walked up to one of the US soldiers. I couldn’t hear what he was talking about due to the engine still running but he pointed to us multiple times and the US soldier looked at us just as many times. Greg walked back to the Honker with the US soldier and said to us “Alright, time to make a full happy meal. French fries here will oversee you for now.” The US soldier looked at us then pointed directly at me. “Doctor Rainer?” He asked. I nodded sheepishly. “Come here.” He pointed at the ground in front of him.

I looked back at the others, and they just looked at me like I was a cow or chicken getting ready to be slaughtered. “Now!” The US soldier yelled impatiently. I then scurried right to him. Once I was in front of him, he ordered me to walk in front of him to the bunker. I did as instructed. Despite my growing anxiety in this whole situation, it didn’t dull my curiosity, or my theories. I looked around, observing everything from the trees of the forest to the soldiers who had set up a couple of tents and coverings, and to the bunker itself. Alarm bells were ringing in my head like mad. That’s when I knew that this wasn’t just some ordinary heritage site. Though I still didn’t know what exactly I was brought here for.

We reached the bunker. I noticed a red door on it. Usually, these bunkers have either an open back for quick movement of troops and ammunition or have the entrance hidden away somewhere as a hatch on the ground. This had not only a garage but an easily noticeable door. I immediately knew what this meant. This wasn’t a frontlines fortification; this was a black site. “Alright Poindexter,” the soldier said to me “Tell us, is this door genuine?” Genuine? Weird question coming from a soldier. I wanted to give a witty retort, but the guy was holding an XM7 and I could see the safety was off, so I analyzed the door quietly. I could tell this door was authentic just from the creek it made when I pushed it, but it did not open. I tried pushing harder but it wouldn’t budge. I knocked it and could tell that something was behind it.

“Um… sir-“ “Don’t call me sir, I work for a living.” The soldier cut me off rudely. Didn’t know they still used that joke, though I could tell he was more annoyed with me than anything. I continued “There’s something behind this door.” The soldier then held his arms out and said “Well look what we have here, a regular Sherlock Holmes. Yeah, no shit there’s something behind the door. I asked you if it was authentic. You gonna give me the answer I asked for or are we gonna stand here ‘till Russia starts World War 3?” Well excuuuuuse me princess. I analyzed the door again. Yup, fully genuine, as before. “Yes, it’s genuine.” The soldier then nodded and shoved me aside.

The soldier pushed his earpiece and mumbled something like “Go ahead.” The next thing I knew a group of three Poles rushed the door, one carrying an enforcer, which if you didn’t know is basically a modern handheld battering ram. Two took position on each side of the door and the one with the battering ram bust open the door after a couple of hits. When the door opened, I noticed there were boards and chains that were behind it. Now I know why the soldier asked me to evaluate it. I’m also sure they must have scanned for explosives beforehand, but that’s because of the equipment that I just noticed next to the door. The soldiers then rushed in with their guns drawn. I heard the soldiers rushing through the bunker, but all I could think of at the time was what was actually going on here.

As soon as I arrived here, I knew there was something wrong with this whole thing. We were the only scientists, heck, the only civilians in this whole place. I could tell we were the only ones because the soldier didn’t even ask my profession, he knew who I was just by my name, and I’m no celebrity.   
Speaking of the soldier, the American who was keeping an eye on me put his hand to his earpiece again and said “Ok, I’m sending them in.” He then waved over someone. I looked over and saw the other four from the university being escorted by a couple of soldiers over to us. They all looked very uneasy, and so was I.

When they arrived, the soldier said “Alright eggheads, I’m going to tell you why exactly we’re here. I’m sure all of you have been fed some nonsense about this place being a mineral deposit or some heritage site, but the truth is we knew about this place for a long time. It wasn’t until recently that we actually found its location. We don’t know exactly what is in here, but we know it’s something dangerous. However, it could be very valuable to us. Your job is to find out exactly what it is, that’s why the five of you have been chosen. You are going to go down there and find out everything you can about this place. We will be monitoring you the whole way so anything you find you will immediately report to us. Now, I’m not saying you have to do anything we tell you to, but we are in the middle of the woods in an undocumented location, and we are close to the border of a hostile nation, so it wouldn’t be too much of a surprise of someone was… lost. Perhaps you even willingly defected, but I know loyal Americans such as you five would never dream of doing that, right?”

He juggled his gun as he gave a smug look at us. I was scared out of my mind at this point, but I had anticipated something was off since the black SUVs. The others, even Kal, I could tell, were trembling. We were strangers before, but now we looked to each other for comfort.

After what felt like forever, Kal and I looked at each other and gave a nod. We then looked to the others and nodded. I spoke up to the soldier and said “Ok, let’s get started.” The soldier smiled smugly and motioned for us to go in. I went in first and the others followed suit. There was a short set of stairs that led down to a rather large open area for a bunker like this. It had a couple of rooms. One was a canteen I guessed, but it looked more like a kitchen with how small it was and a couple of rooms with hanging lights, some tables and seats. We continued walking until we reached some stairs going down. I said, “Watch your footing, stairs here.” to the others as I started descending.

The stairs were dimly lit by some glowsticks placed by the soldiers that initially went in. Flares would have been a bad idea in these tight spaces. Eventually, we reached the bottom of the stairs. It was very dark, but I could see glimpses of things as the soldiers who went in before were already in this room shining their headlamps around. “Um, anyone found a light switch?” I said into the dark. One of the soldiers spoke into their communicators and said something along the lines of “Light it up.” For a moment I was afraid I was about to be executed but actually “Light it up.” meant the power. I had guessed the soldiers outside plugged in a generator or something. The lights came on and that’s when I saw… the lab.

This room was big. Not as big as a hanger but big for a bunker, roughly around 20-40 square meters would be my guess, and the ceiling was high for an underground facility. Along the walls ran multiple pipes and tubes with some fans, I assume were for air circulation. Along the walls were multiple Z3 machines, old computers used by Germany during World War 2. Around the room lay forlorn countertops, tables and carts. On many of them were empty beakers and bare clipboards. Weirdest of all was a strange rubble littered a corner of the room. Despite our current situation, this room was fascinating to the five of us from the university. We were looking around the room like we were kids who had just entered a candy shop. “Alright, the five of you go find out what this place is hiding. Remember, report everything to us.” The American soldier said to us as he waved us away and stood by the staircase. We knew that meant ‘don’t try to escape’. The five of us from the university began wandering around the room, examining anything we could. Kal and Oppen went straight for the tubes after he put on some gloves that were provided to them.

Mobius began examining the machines to see if any of them worked. Oak began aimlessly walking around looking for anything relevant to his field of study. I started checking the drawers of the countertops to see if any documents were present. The only thing I found in them was burned or rotting pieces of paper and some surgical tools. I told Kal about them, and she said she would get to them later. I checked a little more and just before I gave up I found one folder that was just intact enough to read. It was thick with paper, so I immediately opened it up.

The first thing I saw was a picture of a man holding an infant. The minute I saw this, I dropped the folder and stepped back. “What’s wrong?” Kal asked me. Oppen also looked at me and I said, “Look in the folder.” Kal walked over and looked in the folder. She froze in place for a solid moment, then she waved Oppen to her. When Oppen arrived, Kal showed him the folder and Oppen looked concerned. “Who is that?” He asked. “Sigmund Rascher.” I answered. “One of, if not the evilest doctor of the Nazi SS who conducted horrendous experiments on humans.” I walked over and stood with Kal and Oppen. Oppens face had immediately dropped. Kal spoke up “He experimented on anyone. Elderly, adults, children… infants. Human life meant nothing to him.”

Oppen’s expression grew more and more disturbed. He looked at me many times for reassurance, maybe he hoped I would tell him Kal was exaggerating or making it all up. I could offer him no comfort, only the truth. Oppen was beside himself and Kal had had enough. She closed the folder and shoved it onto my chest. I grabbed it as she returned to searching the laboratory, but this time with more vigor. She knew exactly what she was looking for. Oppen was still trying to wrap his head around this whole ordeal. I opened the folder once again and looked past the picture.  
I found multiple reports, some written with a typewriter and others were handwritten letters. All, of course, were written in German. Thankfully I know German so I can transcribe these reports and letters here. The first one was an official report as follows:

“Entry No. 1-9-9-8.

November 18, 19\*\* (the year date was burned)

Experiment Codenamed: Anubis

Status: Suspended Indefinitely

Result: Failure

Anubis

After Action Report

In our attempt to breed a more obedient population from an otherwise disobedient or undesirable population, we had attempted to inject human test subjects with canine DNA. No noticeable change aside from rejections of the blood transfusions. We examined the bodies, but other than further examples of blood types, nothing of interest is to be noticed. These bodies were subsequently incinerated. In conclusion, I must deem the findings from the SS in Egypt nothing more than fantasy. I would also like to personally interject that perhaps the tales of cynocephaly and werewolves are also false. I request to cease all human-canine hybridization experiments immediately so that we may focus our resources on expanding the human mind.

SECRET

Signed: Sigmund Rascher”

After reading this, my mind began going into overdrive again. It took me a moment to realize why I was feeling this way, but after reading the title for a third time, it hit me. “Monkey See, Doggie Do.” I muttered. Apparently, these words snapped Oppen out of his trance as he looked to me and said “What?” It was too soon for me to say anything about my own hypothesis, so I told Oppen it was nothing. He took a few breaths but nodded understandingly. Back in my own head I wanted to say I was over exaggerating, but everything was there. Anubis, the date, the number, the experiment, even the fact it was a failure. If this was coincidence, then it would go down in history as the most perfect coincidence of all time.

I then jumped after hearing a loud noise of what sounded like metal being scraped across the ground. I looked over and noticed Oak pushing a door open. The others from what I saw also looked over to him. Oak shouted “He guys! I found another room!” I closed the folder and walked over with Oppen and a soldier. Kal and Mobius I had guessed were still focused on what they were doing because they didn’t come along. While walking over I noticed Oak put his hands over his mouth and stepped back. “What is it?” the soldier asked, noticing his reaction. The soldier then peaked into the room and said, “Oh god that’s disgusting.” Oppen slowed down but still came to see what was in the room. I looked in and aside from my initial horror, I froze again.

In the room were surgical tables, chairs with straps on them with lights and tools hanging above them. Additionally, there were cages around the area and cells along the walls. Worst of all, in the room were multiple tanks of formaldehyde. In some were bodies. My curiosity overtook my dread as I rushed in and began examining the tanks. It was hard to tell with the formaldehyde having fogged a bit, but I could faintly see an outline. I would guess that these were monkeys. I hoped they were monkeys. Oak walked up next to me and stared into the tank. I looked over to him and tears were streaming down his face. I attempted to comfort him by putting my hand on his shoulder, but he just walked forward and put his hand on the tank. He could tell they were animals.

I didn’t know him personally, but I knew he was an animal lover. This must have been traumatizing to him. “Who… who could have done this?” I opened the folder I had and showed him the picture of Sigmund Rascher. He slowly took the picture then began ripping it to shreds. He started stomping it into the ground and banging on the tank. The soldier noticed this outburst and had to restrain him for a moment before he could destroy anything else. After a short scuffle, Oak resigned to crying on the floor. Oppen was watching from the doorway and walked in after Oak’s breakdown.

“This doesn’t make any sense.” Oppen said looking at the tanks “If these tanks are filled with formaldehyde, then it should have eroded away long ago.” I don’t know much about chemistry or working in a morgue, so I took his word for it. “There must be something more to it then.” Kal said as she entered the room. “I heard Doctor Oak crying and came over to check on him. I see now why he is.” Kal walked up to the tank Oppen and I were at and put her hand on it. She knocked on the glass and said “We need to run a test on this. Soldier, can you get us a chemistry kit as well as medical equipment?” I expected the soldier to say something like “Don’t tell me what to do” or be resistant but he immediately put his hand on his earpiece and nodded to Kal. Kal then walked over to one of the tables and cleared it of the junk that was on it.

While waiting for the soldiers to come down with the requested equipment, Kal looked at me and said “Doctor Rainer, search your file for anything on this place. Also, try searching this room for any other documents that could be useful.” I nodded to Kal and started flipping through the files. I found a letter from Heinrich Himmler. If you didn’t know, Himmler was one of the evilest people within the Nazi regime. Some say he was even worse than Hitler. I took no pleasure in reading this, but I will still transcribe it for you.

“Herr Rascher,

I am disappointed with the lack of results as well as the fundamental disproof of one of the integral beliefs of our beautiful culture. Nevertheless, I see another opportunity for the Übermensch project. We have received intelligence from our Japanese allies of the discovery of a new element. Manshu Detachment 731 has requested to cooperate with your unit, and we have approved their request. A detachment will arrive within the week, and I expect your full hospitality and cooperation with them. From what I hear, they are some of the best scientists in the world, rivaling that of the greatest minds in the Reich, even yours. Prove to them that we are superior.

Hail Hitler,

Heinrich Himmler.”

Oh god… Unit 731. If you don’t know, Unit 731 was an Imperial Japanese biological and chemical warfare research and development unit during World War 2. The experiments they conducted are considered my many worse than that of the Nazis. I won’t go into detail, but I will say this. They further discovered that humans were mostly made of water by setting people on fire just to see how they die. That’s one of the least horrible things they did. Just the sick, horrible people I would expect Himmler and Rascher to work with and admire. This is huge in another way though. Never before has there been direct documentation of the Germans and Japanese working side by side. The closest there have been are naval skirmishes in the Indian ocean. I needed to continue reading. I flipped through more of the pages and found the report from the first day Unit 731 arrived at this compound.

“Report

Presiding Overseer: Sigmund Rascher

Day 1

Manshu Detachment 731 has successfully arrived at Black Site C. A division of 10 men arrived on \[REDACTED\] by three trucks. With them was Japanese Surgeon General Shirō Ishii. This man is a genius way ahead of his time. Despite his… undesirable traits, I respect his intellect. Perhaps later we can fix that. They have also brought with them additional equipment as well as some animals, primates to be exact. The Fuhrer would not be pleased about this, but should we produce results, I think he can forgive us. As the men began moving the equipment into our laboratory, Surgeon General Ishii explained to me that his spies within the United States of America have retrieved a new element the yankees have cooked up. He calls it Utonium. Apparently, this new element is made from uranium, which we possess plenty of. Once our equipment is properly set up and Surgeon General Ishii and his men are properly adjusted, we will begin experiments immediately.”

At this point I was shaking. Despite two of the evilest people having been here, I kept rereading the word “Utonium”. I kept looking at that spot on the page to see if something was off, maybe a faded letter or a mistranslation, but no. It said Utonium. Once though my shock subsided, read what it said about the element. It was made from uranium. I decided to ask Oppen if he knew what this meant. Before I could ask him the soldiers, along with some men in trench coats, had started to bring in and set up the equipment that Kal had asked for.

It was now or never, so I pulled Oppen aside and asked, “Doctor Oppen, do you know of an element that is made from uranium?” He looked at me puzzled, but nevertheless answered my question “That would be neptunium and plutonium. Why?” I explained what I was reading and pointed him to the word “Utonium”. However, he brushed it off saying it was probably a mistranslation, or perhaps the at the time they didn’t know the full difference between neptunium and plutonium, so they considered it one element. Yeah, that makes sense. My mind calmed down after hearing that perfectly rational explanation. Still though, such a coincidence.

It was during this time that the equipment and table was finally set up for Kal. She then pointed to one of the tanks with a monkey corpse in it and made another order “Ok, I need the contents of that container on this table. If any of you are medically trained, I’m going to need nurses. Doctor Oppen, I’ll need your help too, so start scrubbing up.” Oppen nodded to Kal and went off to get properly dressed. A couple of the soldiers began moving the tank while some of the men in trench coats began scrubbing up as well.  Kal looked at me and asked “Doctor Rainer, have you found anything yet?” I looked at the page I was reading and told her “Make sure to scan this body, It might be radioactive.” I really had no idea what I was talking about, but Kal nodded in approval and asked the soldiers for a Geiger counter. They gave her one and she scanned the outside of the tank. “Safe. Hopefully the inside is too.” Kal said as she put the Geiger counter on the operating table.

She then walked over to Oak who was still sitting on the floor in the fetal position. Kal spoke in a very soft and calming voice “Doctor Oak, I know this is horrible, but we need your help dissecting these animals.” Oak shuffled back but Kal persisted “These animals died at the hands of evil men. I’m not asking you to cut them open for our amusement, or because we’re surrounded by jarheads with guns, I’m asking you to help me find out what happened to them so no more animals will have to suffer the same fate.” Kal put her hand on his shoulder. There was a brief pause, then Oak looked up at Kal and nodded.

Kal handed Oak a rag and he wiped his face of the tears and snot. Kal then lifted Oak up and escorted him out to, I assume, get him scrubbed up. I don’t know if Kal was being genuine or just saying the right things to get Oak to help her with the dissection, but the display of kindness was enough to make me smile for just a moment. My smile quickly faded though when I noticed one of the trench coats glaring at me. I stared back at them in the eyes. His eyes then quickly darted down then back to my gaze. I think he was hinting at my folder. I took this as a sign to read another page out of the folder. I flipped through and found another.

Day 2

The proper facilities and arrangements for the Japanese have been finalized. The only issue is a slight language barrier with some of the Japanese but one of our officers will serve as an interpreter thanks to his ability to speak and read Japanese. Our first experiment was an attempt to recreate the Utonium element. We used two pounds of our uranium reserves as our first test samples. Our first attempt to recreate Utonium resulted in an unprecedented discovery of the element Plutonium, one of two elements that the Japanese spies had reported from the United States (see report 12-14-40 for further information).

This method of creation will be relayed to our other sites for further experimentation and production of our wunderwaffe. Our second attempt to create Utonium resulted in another unexpected discovery. The spent within one of our reactors produced a strange byproduct. From further reports from the Japanaese, this element was known as Neptunium. We theorize that this will also help in the production of our wunderwaffe, specifically in the field of electricity. This information will be relayed to Group 935. Further attempts to create element Utonium will continue in the following days.” Attacked to this document were scientific notes that I could only barely understand.

Oppen was wrong, so very wrong. Utonium was not a mistranslation, it was an element itself, but how? There is no element Utonium on the periodic table. Maybe I was hasty to say that Oppen was entirely wrong. Perhaps Utonium was a myth that Rascher and Ishii were chasing, like many of their country’s foul institutions did. I noticed the soldiers had dislodged the tank and began removing the contents onto the table. Kal, Oppen and Oak had returned into the room wearing the proper attire for surgery.

Kal noticed me reading another page and asked “Anything?” I handed her the report with the scientific documents on them. She handed it to Oppen who quickly glanced over it. “These are the formulas for Plutonium and Neptunium. Crude and outdated, but I can confirm that’s what this is.” Kal nodded. One of the trench coats overheard this and confiscated the documents Oppen was holding. He then noticed me and said “Sir, you’ll need to step out of the room while the operation is in progress.” I looked to Kal for reassurance, but she nodded in agreement with the trench coat. I was then escorted out of the room, but I noticed an observation room next to it, so I took up residence in it so I could watch the procedure through the one way mirror while I skimmed through more documents. It seems there was a gap in reports as the next one was the seventh day.

Day 7

After days of failure, we have made a breakthrough. After combining the Plutonium, Neptunium and Uranium in a vat of oil and heating it up by process of nuclear fission, we have created a new compound which we have designated Chemical X.”

After reading this I dropped the paper and had a small nervous breakdown. I don’t remember much from this point, but I do remember sitting in the fetal position for a bit trying to wrap my head around this. Once again though, my attempts to rationalize the situation happened again. Chemical X is a good way to designate unknown compounds and I’m sure even the government has used this as a designation. Utonium, also, could be pure coincidence. I can assure you now that this was not true. There are no coincidences. I continued reading.

“Though not the pure element, we have discovered trace amounts of what we believe to be the Utonium element. We have begun experiments with other elements but nothing of note worth has been observed. Tomorrow we will begin experimentation on living organisms.”

I stepped back again to clear my head. Needless to say, even with my attempts to rationalize what I was reading I still couldn’t denounce the idea that these documents are somehow connected to the Powerpuff Girls. I looked out into the room that Kal, Oppen and Oak were preparing to form an autopsy. They were still trying to safely extract the body from the formaldehyde. As I turned back to the file to continue my research, I noticed something interesting. A film camera. It was pointed at the surgery room. I decided to examine it and noticed that it was in decent shape for being almost a hundred years old. I shook it and heard something rattle inside. It might have had film in it, I think. I needed some help with it, so I decided to get help from the one person who wasn’t busy, Doctor Mobius.
