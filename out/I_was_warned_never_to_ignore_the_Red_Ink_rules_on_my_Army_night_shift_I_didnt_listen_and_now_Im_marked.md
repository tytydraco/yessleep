For those who didn't see my first report, [you can find the details here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1psti9l/im_a_sfc_on_staff_duty_i_ignored_the_red_ink_sop/).

Short recap; I’m a SFC (Sergeant First Class) in the army, and I’ve been in long enough to know that rules are usually there for a reason. But last night, I thought I knew better. I ignored the 'Red Ink' SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) while on staff duty, and I thought I’d gotten away with it.

I was wrong, and I brought the shift home with me....

I was in my apartment. My kitchen was exactly where it was supposed to be, but the hallway... the hallway was different. It was longer. And I was hearing that damn floor buffer again.

I’ve been off the desk for over twelve hours at that point, and should have been in a deep post-Staff Duty coma. Instead, I was standing in my pajamas with my knees bent inwards as I shook with my 9mm in hand.

I thought I escaped that building. I thought Miller being in the clinic meant the "event" was over. But when I woke up from a nap an hour ago, I realized I didn't bring just my laundry bag home.

I went into the kitchen to get a glass of water, and there, sitting on my counter, was a DA Form 1594. It wasn't a copy. It was the original from the desk. But the entries... they aren't mine. Carefully written in each block respectively, I read the notes:

>**1800:** *SFC Crawford arrived at residence. Subject believes he is off-duty. Subject is incorrect.*  
**1930:** *Subject entered REM sleep. The Third Floor moved into the crawlspace above Subject’s bedroom.*  
**2100:** *Subject is staring at this log. The Red Ink is dry. The Runner is waiting behind the refrigerator.*

I froze. I live alone. I checked the "Red Ink" folder I’d swiped—the one SSG Halloway told me was the *real* SOP. I flipped to a page I hadn’t seen before. It was hand-written, the ink so fresh it smeared under my thumb:

>**Rule #9: The Ghost Roster.**  
*If the NCO in Charge leaves the AO before the 'Recording' on the 3rd floor finishes, the AO expands to include the NCO’s primary residence. Do not check your closets. If you hear a floor buffer in your hallway, do not look at the floor. The 'Janitor' does not like to be watched while he cleans the blood.*

I heard it then. The unmistakable, rhythmic *whir-slap, whir-slap* of an industrial floor buffer. It was coming from my hallway—the one with the hardwood floors I just waxed last week.

I grabbed my phone to call 1SG, but the screen didn't show my wallpaper. It was a live feed of my own kitchen. In the video, I’m standing there looking at the 1594, but there’s a hand—a pale, grey hand with fingers that are too long—reaching out from the gap behind my fridge. It’s holding a pen. A red pen.

Then my phone buzzed. A text from an unknown number.  
*" Hey, 'Sarnt, this is Miller. I’m at the clinic, but the doctors say I have 'Cursive Throat.' They’re going to sew my name tape onto my skin now. Are you coming to visit? The Third Floor missed you. It’s much bigger now. It’s everywhere."*

I looked at the hallway. The floor buffer sound stopped. In the silence, I heard a TikTok audio. It was that same six-second clip that was playing on repeat from Miller's phone from the incident much earlier, but now the lyrics were just my own name being chanted in a guttural, wet rasp.

I’ve survived three deployments and 15 years of the green machine, but as I watch the door handle to my bedroom slowly turn, I shriek like a little girl as I realize the "Red Ink" SOP wasn't a warning for the building...

*It was a warning for me*.

I stood in my kitchen, my 9mm heavy in my hand. My apartment hallway didn’t lead to my bathroom anymore. It stretched into a dimly lit corridor of concrete and eggshell paint. The smell of industrial wax was overwhelming. I wasn't in my home; my home had been annexed by the 3rd floor.

Then I saw him.

Miller was standing at the end of the long hallway. He wasn't scrolling on his phone. He was holding a floor buffer, moving it in slow, rhythmic circles. His OCP uniform looked charred, and that cursive name tape was glowing a faint, sickly red.

"Sergeant First Class Crawford," he said, his voice sounding like it was coming from the bottom of a well. "I didn't finish the log. You left before the 'Recording' ended. Now I have to stay until the ink runs out."

I didn't think. I dropped the pistol. It wouldn't work against a ghost anyway. Then, I ran. I didn't run away from him, but rather, I ran *at* him. I grabbed him by his uniform top and slammed him against the wall. The wall felt like cold meat.

"PFC Miller, look at me!" I roared, using my best 'drill sergeant' voice to break the trance. "You are on my roster! I am your NCO! You do not take orders from a manila folder! We are clearing this AO right now!"

The floor buffer shrieked, a sound like a human scream. The 'Janitor', a shadow taller than the ceiling, bloomed behind Miller. I felt a searing heat, like the "Heat Bloom" from the parade field.

I pulled out the Manila folder. I realized then what the "Red Ink" really was. It wasn't just instructions; it was a contract.

"I’m the NCOIC!" I shouted at the shadow. "I am the primary hand-receipt holder! If Miller is 'Short' on his shift, I’ll cover the balance! Sign him over to me!"

I bit my thumb hard and smeared my own blood across the 'Relieved by' line on the DA Form 1594.

The world tilted. The sound of the TikTok audio reached a deafening crescendo and then... silence.

I blinked, and I was back in my kitchen. The hallway was normal again. The smell of wax was gone, replaced by the scent of my cold coffee. Miller was slumped on my floor, breathing hard, his uniform back to normal. No cursive. Just "MILLER" in standard block letters.

He looked up at me, his eyes clearing. "Um.. 'Sarnt? Where are we? I thought... I thought I was on the 3rd floor." I helped him up. He’s alive. He’s safe. He’s back on the roster.

  
It’s now 23:30. Miller is back at his barracks, tucked into his bunk. The clinic staff called me earlier, confused, asking how he’d 'discharged himself' without anyone seeing him leave. I told them he’d just walked back to the company area and I’d caught up with him. I’m a SFC; they didn't question me. They just filed the paperwork.

But I’m looking at my hand. The 'Red Ink' I used to sign the form? It didn't wash off. It’s stained into my skin, right across my palm. It’s a permanent hand-receipt.

I’m still deployment ready. My PT score is good, and my weapon is clean. But I know that the next time my name is on that Duty Roster, the folder won't be behind the printer. It’ll be waiting on the desk, already open to my name. If it's anything that might give me PTSD, it won't be my past deployments, but rather, this damned staff duty I now have to deal with.

The 3rd floor didn't want Miller. It wanted an NCO.

I have Staff Duty again in three weeks. Gods help whoever is my Runner for that...
