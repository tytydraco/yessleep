My brother died when I was seven years old. He was thirteen. He drowned in the lake down the street from our house.

My parents never touched his room. They tried once but they couldn’t do it. Too raw. After that, the door just stayed shut. His room became a kind of museum of him. 

That was eleven years ago. His room still looks the same.

This morning, while I was packing for college, I thought I’d finally go in there. My plan wasn’t anything dramatic. I just wanted to grab a few hoodies, maybe a keepsake or two to take with me. Something to hold onto when I got homesick.

Full transparency, I’ve been in his room plenty of times before. I’ve sat on his bed. I’ve looked through his shelves. But I’ve never really gone digging. That felt wrong, and I really had no inclination to. I just missed my brother. 

That wasn’t my intention today either. It wasn’t my intention to find a stack of DVDs shoved into the bottom drawer of his dresser.

There were three of them. Just labeled 1, 2, and 3.

The only DVD player in the house is still hooked up to his old TV. Everything else went streaming years ago. For a minute, I told myself not to do it. They weren’t mine. They probably didn’t matter.

I picked up some of the items I had collected, put the DVDs back in his drawer, and returned to my room. 

Tonight they started calling to me.

I know how that sounds. I know you’re thinking it was just my curiosity eating at me. But it wasn’t like that. It felt physical. A pull in my chest. 

So I crept back across the hall. Slipped into his room. Locked the door behind me so my parents wouldn’t hear, and I put in the first DVD.

It was a home video.

I didn’t even know we had any. I don’t remember my parents ever owning a camera.

The video starts with static, then clears just enough to show something. The picture is muddy, warped. It could be the living room, but the furniture looks wrong. Everything is too big or too small, shifting every time the frame jitters. Sometimes it almost looks like a bedroom. Sometimes, like a hallway.

No faces. No clear shapes. Just flickering shadows that don’t match what the voices are saying.

Because there are voices. Familiar ones. Laughter, clinking dishes, and my mom calling my brother's name. It sounds like family in the background, just out of sight. I hear my brother's laughter, and the sound swallows me whole. It rings through my head, bouncing off the bones that make up my skull.

Then, beneath it is another voice.

Low, deliberate, close enough that you couldn’t miss it:

*"You haven’t noticed yet."*

Then the video cut off. Just like that.

I scrambled to replay it, not even thinking about the other two discs still stacked under the TV. I just wanted to hear him laugh again. That laugh. I tried not to think about the end, though the fear of it was crawling slowly up my spine as I hit play.

Because the way it spoke, it sounded like it wasn’t part of the recording at all. Like it was speaking to the camera. To me.

I pressed play again, this time pausing every few seconds, desperate to make sense of what I was seeing. But nothing held still. Everything on the film looked almost familiar, like a room you swear you’ve been in but can’t place. The walls are a little too narrow, and the colors are washed out enough to make it something you’ve never seen before. It made me feel like my brain was short-circuiting. 

Then I froze the frame just before the moment he laughed.

And there it was. A caption, faint and yellow, burned into the corner of the screen.

**July 30, 2015.**

Seven months after my brother drowned.

My first thought was that it was a glitch. It had to be. The camera must have been off by a year. There’s no other explanation. I forced myself to breathe and to shove back the rising panic.

Then I pressed play again.

His laugh filled the room, and for a second, my fear washed away. It was just him again. He was alive, warm, present. A bittersweet rush of comfort and grief.

But then the voice returned.

Closer this time. Wet against the microphone, broken and cutting in and out like static.

*"You noticed."*

I ripped the DVD out of the player and threw it across the room. I don’t even know why I did it. Adrenaline, I guess. My hands were shaking so hard I couldn’t control myself.

I’m trying to think of logical explanations. I want to believe there’s one. But every reason I come up with feels paper-thin.

I just bolted back to my room and dove under the covers. Like that would help. I don’t want to watch the other videos. I don’t. But I can feel them pulling at me, like they’re not finished. Like I owe them something. I can’t sleep.

It’s dark. It’s late. The rain just started. 

The bathroom faucet always drips, but tonight it sounds so much louder. You could almost confuse it for footsteps.
