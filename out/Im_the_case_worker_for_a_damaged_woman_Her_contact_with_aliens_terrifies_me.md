*(My name is Matthew, but this is not my story. This is Suzy’s story. For two years I have been her care worker, and apart from these commentaries, everything here is in Suzy’s own words.)*

Hello. I’m Suzy, and it’s nice to talk to you.

My friend Matthew says that everybody has a story. He says mine is really important. I’m going to talk, and Matthew is going to type it so other people can read it.

I’m not very clever, but I used to be really really clever. I had an important job. I can’t remember how to say it but it was about space and stars. I like space.

*(Matthew: Suzy was director of astrobiological research at the SETI institute.)*

Matthew says maybe I could be clever again. He says talking about what happened to me might help me. He is very friendly and helps me with lots of things like shopping and cooking.

I like looking at stars. Sometimes I go outside at night and lie on the ground for ages. The stars twinkle. Did you know some of them aren’t stars? There are planets, big round things like the Earth, and they go round the Sun. Sometimes I see spaceships going past. It’s very exciting.

Sometimes when I had an important job I finished my work and went outside. Sometimes the sky was really black and the stars were so bright, and I lay down on the grass and watched them. It was nice and fun.

One day when I was watching the stars the sky went strange. It went really dark and I was a bit scared. Then some shadows came down from the sky and grabbed me. Then I went somewhere else. It was like swimming, but I was all underwater but I could breathe okay. It was a funny feeling. I was tingly all over, like when you sit on your hands for too long. The water was funny colours. I liked swimming in the funny water until the shadows put me back on the ground.

>Last night I was running analyses of annual fluctuations in the atmospheric composition of Gliese 273b. Despite its environmental similarity to Earth, there has to date been no real evidence of significant organic compounds in its atmosphere. Although commonly believed to be tidally locked - and thus making life processes extremely unlikely - given Gliese 273b’s orbital eccentricity, there remains the possibility that it possesses a spin-orbit resonance which could result in a more stable environment. If we can show significant seasonal variations in things like atmospheric water content, Gliese 273b could be one of the strongest contenders for extra-solar life.

>My word, it was nice to be doing actual science for once! I’m honestly sick to death of hosting departmental meetings that everybody knows are pointless, and writing quarterly justifications for the budget of projects that, at best, require years of research to show results. The bosses would have a fit if they knew that I was getting my hands dirty when Derek should be doing the grunt work, but screw them. It’s not like I’m going to put in for overtime.  
>  
>The cleaners had already been and gone. I was the only person left in the lab when I realised it was almost 01:30 LMT, and I had a board meeting at 08:30. I miss the days when I would work to sidereal time.  
>  
>I knew I should have gone home to catch a few hours sleep, but I didn’t. Instead I turned off all the lights, and lay on the grassy quadrangle in the middle of the building.  
>  
>It was glorious. The sky was darker than I remember seeing it in a very long time. Mars was bright and high in the sky, at an altitude of nearly 60°, and I could make out at least eight of the badly-named Seven Sisters. I’d had a difficult day, and I knew I was in for a difficult morning tomorrow, but right then I felt … *content*.  
>  
>I had been gazing at the sky for maybe an hour when it darkened. At first I thought some faint clouds had gathered, but as I looked more carefully, I realised that wasn’t it. Even under the darkest conditions, there is light from the atmosphere and the zodiacal band. What I saw that night was not just the absence of light. It was *darkness*. And as I watched, I saw the darkness take form. Great branches of darkness stretched across the sky, obscuring the stars, looking a lot like tentacles. And then - the tentacles *reached down*. Four or five of them actually touched me. It felt like the world warped, sort of vibrated at infrasonic frequencies. The faint outline of the buildings around me distorted. And suddenly -  
>  
>I blinked in the bright light.  
>  
>No, not blinked. And not bright; it wasn’t that bright, not really. And I don’t think I blinked, because I don’t think I had eyelids, or eyes. Certainly my vision adjusted a lot quicker than the normal biological adaptations.  
>  
>I was no longer lying on solid ground, because there wasn’t any. I seemed to be in a cloud, but one of deep blue and dark orange. Light diffused through the cloud; not much, but enough to see clearly.  
>  
>My first thought, which I still believe to be true, was that I was in a gas giant. Or at least my mind was. The orange colour could be from sulfur, and the blue from methane. My second thought was naturally - how is this possible?  
>  
>I tried to move, and found that I could do so easily. I drifted through the clouds just by thinking. I had no way of judging speed in that landscape - gas-scape - but my movement seemed very fast to me. I could change speed or direction almost immediately, and as I drifted I watched the clouds change.  
>  
>Even given my sudden unexpected predicament, something looked wrong, and it took me a while to realise what it was. There’s something you see every day. So often that you forget it even exists. It wasn’t until I looked “down” and saw no body, that I realised I couldn’t see my nose. I did have sensation, but it seemed unrelated to the effect of the environment on my body. It was a cross between pins-and-needles and the way a storm or a Van de Graff machine makes your hair stand on end. I wondered if this was physical or just psychosomatic.  
>  
>Time was difficult to judge, but based on my phone when I returned, I believe it to have been about two hours when I saw something else. Black tentacles reached out of the clouds, feeling their way towards me somehow. From how they moved it seemed a lot like they were sniffing me out. I hadn’t really experienced emotion for the whole time I was there, but I felt afraid of those things. I tried to move away - but fast as I was, they were faster. They grabbed me - if that’s the right turn of phrase - and I felt the same vibrations as before, and then a sense of falling.  
>  
>I woke up back on the grass.  
>  
>Now this could easily have been a dream. Certainly the stress of the job has been getting to me. But I’ve never had a dream like it, nor so vivid. I checked my phone, and it was 05:22. I didn’t have time to go home, so I wrote this account. Now time to find breakfast before another stupid board meeting.

The next day I went back to the funny cloud place. I swam around a bit. I like swimming and it was really easy there. Then I saw some animals. They swam towards me and talked to me. They didn’t talk with their mouths. They talked with their brains. It was very exciting but a bit scary. I don’t remember what we talked about. Then we finished talking and I was back on the field again.

>*(Matthew: Suzy’s diary, Saturday.)*

>I couldn’t focus in the board meeting. Funding blah blah, cutbacks blah blah blah, return on investment … I made the mistake a few years ago of writing a program to solve the budgetary problems. For goodness sake, they couldn’t cope with simple quadratic equations, and when I demonstrated the use of triple integrals across time, money, and staffing to maximise scientific output for a given budget, I thought they were going to cut me out of future meetings. (No such luck.) I thought better of livening up the meeting with a description of my journey into a gas giant!  
>  
>In the afternoon I reviewed the chemistry of gas giants. They’re not generally that conducive to life, so I’m a bit out of touch compared with my terrestrial planetary science. I did figure that I would have been quite deep into the upper atmosphere to see clouds as thick as I had.  
>  
>That day, yesterday, was Friday, so I didn’t have to worry about being tired the next day. I stayed back after everybody else had left, worked a bit more on the spectral analysis, had a nap for a couple of hours on the sofa in the staff lounge, and then around 00:30 I went out to the quadrangle again.  
>  
>The grass was slightly damp from dew, but not uncomfortably so, and it was another clear but warm night. I gazed up, naming as many stars as I could for about half an hour. Then it happened again.  
>  
>I could make out little more than the night before, but now that I knew what to look for I saw them coming. Great shadowy tentacles, reaching down out of the sky. They gripped me, and again I felt the sensation of vibrations and of the world shimmering out.  
>  
>Concentrating carefully, I saw the gas giant sort of fade in, though it took only a second or so. The rich colours of the night before surrounded me, and I decided to explore a bit. I plunged deeper into the clouds, and saw the light gradually dim until all I could see was deep blue below me and faint orange above. Then I rose, and watched the detail return to my vision. It was exhilarating!  
>  
>I rose higher than the night before, and eventually made out some white wisps far above me. Possibly ammonia or water ice. But before I could get close enough to investigate, I saw something else.  
>  
>One at first, then three, then a dozen dark shapes floated into view, coming out of the haze of gas. At the top of Jupiter’s atmosphere the density is less than that of air on Earth, and visibility is very good; if I really was in a gas giant, I must be a little ways down, as I had already surmised yesterday morning. Especially if the density was enough to support the creatures that approached me.  
>  
>It’s difficult to tell size and distance without a familiar frame of reference, but I believe the creatures to have been about ten metres across. They were black and squid-like; their body plan was round and flat, like a manta ray, undulating through the clouds as they “swam” towards me. But unlike a ray, they also had a great many tendrils. These were tucked behind them, like a bird’s legs in flight, until they got near to me. They swam in circles - I suppose they need continuous motion to maintain their lift - and their tendrils reached out towards me.  
>  
>Each of them had four yellow eyes, two on the top and two on the bottom of their body. They had mouths, but those were not what they used to speak to me. These creatures, who called themselves something like “Marth”, spoke directly into my mind (I won’t say my brain, as I am now convinced it remained, in my body, on the grass back on Earth).  
>  
>They communicated in ideas, rather than words. The Marth are highly intelligent, and despite having no technology to speak of, understand the concepts of science. Somehow they are aware of other planets and astronomy. They told me that others have visited them in the past, and shared knowledge with them.  
>  
>I had travelled through a wormhole, they explained. I didn’t understand everything they told me, but my scientific background was a great asset in our communication. Small wormholes are spread throughout space, capable of transmitting information but too unstable to carry matter. And so my mind had travelled through the wormhole.  
>  
>The Marth explained this as best they could, though I’m an astrobiologist, and my general relativity is limited. In exchange I told them what I knew about science, about human culture, about our planet, and about our search - fruitless until now - for extraterrestrial life.  
>  
>They were fascinated. This was a true cultural exchange; I was the ambassador for Earth to an entirely new sentient species!  
>  
>But all too quickly it was over. The Marth have talked to many other species, and learned that a mind disconnected from its body cannot last long without losing the connection permanently. Soon enough I saw those same dark tendrils reaching through the clouds to pull me back.  
>  
>I will return tomorrow night.

The animals were very friendly. We talked and talked with our brains. I liked them a lot. They had a funny name, I think it was “Mars” like the chocolate. They’re really clever. Maybe I’ll be clever again one day too. It would be fun to go back there.

>*(Suzy’s diary, Saturday afternoon.)*  
>  
>I’ve done a bit of research on wormholes. I can’t figure out how they work.  
>  
>A wormhole is essentially two black holes, connected and then separated in spacetime. But they’re not ordinary gravitational black holes; a wormhole should collapse immediately when something enters it. A Schwarzchild black hole is traversable in one direction only, without the use of negative mass to hold both ends open - something that seems improbable without it being deliberately engineered with highly sophisticated technology.  
>  
>Even if these did exist, I can’t for the life of me work out how they could float around in the Earth’s atmosphere, whisking my consciousness off to the other end for a few hours.  
>  
>I can’t do the maths. I’ll talk to the Marth tonight, and send an email to Kip Thorne tomorrow.

But I can’t go back. The next time I went there they said it was my last time so I only went there three times.

I didn’t understand a lot of what they said. They said they need to come here. They said they want to live here, and then we can go somewhere else.

They said they needed to keep my mind to help them come here. They said I know the way to Earth and they’ll use my mind to find out how to get here. They let me keep a bit of my mind. I suppose that's why I'm not very clever now.

I hope we get to live in the cloud place. That would be nice. And I’d like to see them again. I hope they come soon.
