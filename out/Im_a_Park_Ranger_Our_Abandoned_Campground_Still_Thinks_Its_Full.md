I don’t go into Birch Run Campground after dark anymore.

On the staffing spreadsheet, I’m still “Senior Ranger – East District.” My badge still has my name on it. But when someone on the radio says “motion alarm, Birch Run,” I suddenly remember the copier is jammed or there’s a training module I should really finish.

The incident report is short.

“September 28 — Ranger Benjamin Ortega responded to motion activation and 911 hang-up at decommissioned Birch Run Campground. Cleared scene at 02:03. No subjects located. Evidence of unauthorized entry, ongoing missing persons investigation.”

Four lines. Suitable for filing cabinets and audits.

This is the rest of it.

Birch Run used to be the busy place.

Families, scout troops, RV caravans with plastic flamingos and those hokey “The Smiths’ Home On Wheels” signs. A paved loop, forty sites, a little amphitheater where someone used to do campfire talks about bears and Leave No Trace. The whole thing sits in a shallow bowl of mixed pine and aspen a mile off Highway 17, between mile markers 142 and 143. The old green “142” marker has two bullet dents that have been there longer than I’ve worked here.

Ten years ago a freak storm rolled off the plateau, dumped too much rain in too little time, and the creek that usually minds its business turned into a battering ram. It ate half the lower loop, took out two footbridges, and undercut the slope behind the amphitheater until part of it slumped. Nobody died, but a couple of tents went for an unexpected swim, and the photos of RVs with water up to their hubcaps made the local news.

The state did a cost-benefit analysis and slapped CLOSED - AREA UNSAFE signs on everything instead of fixing it.

These days Birch Run is technically a “non-operational asset.” In practice that means we use one of the upper bathrooms to store old picnic tables, check the road culverts twice a year, and chase off teenagers who want to drink warm beer in abandoned campsites.

If I’m being honest, for nine and a half years it was just one more place on my patrol list. No special feeling, no ghost stories.

The night everything changed was a Thursday at the tail end of the season. Late September. The main campground at Lake Hermit still had a few trailers hanging on to their spots, clinging to summer. The air smelled like dust and cooling pine. Day crews had clocked out around six. I was at the ranger station finishing a report on a fire ring someone built directly under a low-hanging juniper.

The base radio burped.

“Ranger One, County.”

I clipped my handheld off the charger and thumbed it. “One here. Go ahead.”

“We’ve got a 911 hang-up pinging off the tower by your Birch Run turnoff,” the dispatcher said. Her voice had that half-tired, half-wired tone you get on slow nights when something finally happens. “Call came in at 00:41. Open line, background noise only. They didn’t answer callback. GPS puts it near the old payphone by the Birch Run entrance. You still have a landline out there?”

“Payphone’s been dead since I started,” I said. “We cut the copper five years ago.”

“Okay, that’s weird,” she said, and I could hear her scribbling. “Also, your motion sensor on the Birch Run entry gate tripped at 00:39. That one went to your office voicemail.”

I glanced at the little blinking light on the desk phone. We get deer false alarms a couple times a month.

“Any units closer than me?” I asked.

“Negative. Trooper’s tied up on a rollover down by the canyon. SAR coordinator’s asleep and will bite my head off if I call him for a ghost at a closed campground.”

“Lucky me,” I said. “I’ll go check it out.”

Behind me, the old analog wall clock ticked. 00:49. The fluorescents hummed. The coffee in the pot had gone from bad to something worse; there was already a dark ring burned into the bottom of the carafe I’d be scrubbing in the morning.

“You going solo?” County asked.

“Yeah. I’ll only be out there long enough to tell some kids to pick up their beer cans.”

“Copy, One. Check back when you hit the gate.”

My truck knows the Birch Run road by feel. So do I.

You leave the highway at a brown sign that still says BIRCH RUN CAMPGROUND in faded letters, someone’s stuck a “CLOSED” plaque over it with self-tapping screws. The paved spur turns to rough chipseal after two hundred yards, then to cracked asphalt with grass down the center. Reflectors on the posts are half shot out, half peeled. We keep meaning to replace them; there’s always something more urgent.

At night the road is a pale stripe between trees. Headlights catch the birch trunks and turn them into bare bones. A little rabbit ran ahead of me for a stretch, staying just inside the beam like it wanted a ride.

The gate came up faster than I expected. Two square posts, a galvanized pipe strung between them, a sagging length of chain and a Master padlock the size of my fist. Someone had slapped a NO ENTRY / AREA UNSAFE notice on each post in plastic sleeves. A camera about the size of a deck of cards watched from the top of the right post, red LED winking.

I pulled up short, put the truck in park, and hopped out.

The padlock was hanging from the chain but not snapped shut. The chain itself was hooked, not threaded. Whoever had gone in had tried to make it look closed again.

I lifted the chain off, let it clatter. The sound bounced around the trees in a way that made the night feel more crowded than it was.

“County, Ranger One at Birch Run,” I said into the handheld. “Gate’s been opened and re-hung. No other vehicles in the turnout. I’m going to roll up to the kiosk, see if there’s a car parked inside.”

“Copy, One,” County said. “Time check is 00:57. You solo?”

“Affirmative.”

I eased the truck past the gate and up the cracked entry road. Old reflector stakes flashed, then went dark. The first thing you hit is the fee kiosk and a tiny parking apron. After that, the road turns into the loop.

The kiosk appeared out of the dark like always: a little brown cabinet with a metal roof, tilted slightly from frost heave. The glass behind the bulletin board was spider-cracked in one corner. Inside, the campground map had faded until the green for “trees” and the blue for “creek” were almost the same color. Someone had popped off one of the plastic holders and stuck a faded brochure for a zipline park over the “You are here” dot.

The parking apron was empty. No cars, no motorcycles, no bikes abandoned in a heap. Just old tire marks in the dust and a mound of gravel we’d dumped there a year ago and never spread.

I stopped, sat for a second with the engine idling. The only light was my headlights and the faint reflection off the kiosk glass.

On the inside of the kiosk door someone had taped one of our “Campground Full” tags from back when that mattered. It still had the little tear-off stubs for reserving sites. Every stub along the bottom edge had been neatly torn off.

I don’t know why that detail snagged me so hard. I made a mental note then. I didn’t know yet why it would matter.

“County, no vehicles at the kiosk,” I said. “I’m going to drive the upper loop once. If I see anything that looks like a party, I’ll call for a unit.”

“Copy, One. You are not to enter any structures alone, you hear me? No collapsing bathhouses, no scouting amphitheaters. We’ve been over this.”

“You spoil all my fun,” I said, out of habit more than anything.

I eased the truck forward.

The upper loop lives in that uncanny place between “completely abandoned” and “someone just left.”

The pavement is cracked but not gone. The site posts lean a little, but the numbers are still legible. Old reservation tags ride the clips, some bleached to tan rectangles, others with names you can still read: KHALIL, PETERSON, LIU. The picnic tables are gray and splintery. The fire rings are filled with leaves and pinecones and the occasional glass bottle some kid lobbed in.

I kept the truck in first and rolled slow, windows down.

My headlights washed over Site 3: empty pad, table, fire ring, post.

Site 4: same.

Site 5: same, except the ring of rocks around the fire pit looked… fresh. Uneven ring of rounded stones, some still damp like someone had recently hosed them or pulled them from the creek. No ash in the center. No scorch marks. Just an empty circle, too deliberate.

The way the stones leaned inward bothered me. Like they were all tilting a fraction toward the imaginary center.

I told myself it was kids. Teenagers love moving rocks more than they love anything except leaving trash.

Site 7 had another rock ring. Site 10 had two.

“Somebody’s been playing,” I muttered.

At Site 14 I hit the brakes.

The pull-in, on the outside of the loop overlooking the drop toward the creek, was occupied.

Not by a car. By a campsite.

Chairs—four of them—sat in a semicircle around the ring. Folding camp chairs, the cheap kind you buy at Walmart or Family Dollar, all different colors. An old Coleman two-burner stove rested on the picnic table. A blue cooler sat open on the ground, lid propped back. A lantern on the table flickered on low, lighting the whole scene in a pale, dirty yellow.

Nobody was there.

I killed the engine by reflex and the world dropped into quiet. The little hiss from the lantern suddenly felt loud.

The chairs faced the fire ring but were too close, their feet almost in the circle. One chair had a child-sized fleece hoodie draped over the back, sleeves hanging like arms. Another had a baseball cap parked on the seat. The cooler was full of melted ice water and floating cans. When I stepped closer and shone my flashlight, I could see that the labels were still sharp. The expiration dates on the juice boxes inside were current.

This wasn’t leftover from ten years ago.

“Anyone here?” I called. “Park service!”

My voice fell flat. No answering “yeah?” No rustle of someone climbing out of a tent. The right way to do it would’ve been to stand still and listen for a full minute. I managed maybe ten seconds.

The lantern on the table was an old battery model, plastic base, frosted tube, little dial on the side. The beam from my handheld caught the brand name: RAYOVAC ROUGHNECK. It flickered again, not with the smooth fade of a dying battery but with odd stutters, bright-dim-bright, like someone was blocking and unblocking the LED inside.

That’s when the smell drifted up.

Not rot. Not smoke. Pine cleaner. The same sharp, fake “fresh” the bathhouse used to have when it was still open and the maintenance crew dumped a gallon of concentrate in the mop bucket.

It was faint, but wrong out here. Too indoor.

I gave the site another sweep with my light. No tents. No hammocks. No footprints I could see without getting down on hands and knees. Just the set dressing.

“County, Ranger One,” I said quietly. “I’ve got an active-looking camp setup in closed Birch Run. Chairs, stove, food, but no people present. One battery lantern lit. No vehicle on the loop. Please advise if you’ve got any missing persons reports from the last few hours.”

“Stand by,” County said. I heard keyboard clacks. “Nothing reported in the last six from your area. We had a domestic in town and a shoplifter at the Walmart. That’s it.”

“Copy,” I said. “Any chance trooper could swing by the Birch Run road and sit on the gate?”

“He’s still on the rollover,” she said. “You want me to wake Miller for SAR?”

“Not yet,” I said. “I’m going to finish the loop, check the bathhouse. If I don’t find anyone, then we start making phone calls.”

“Copy. Time check is 01:12. Check in at quarter.”

The farther I went, the more “almost a campsite”s I found.

Site 18 had two chairs and a tablecloth laid out, white with little strawberries printed on it. The cloth was wrong-side up, the tag showing. The edges were folded under instead of hanging. The chairs faced the wrong way, backs to the fire ring.

Site 21 had three sleeping bags laid side by side on the pad, zipped up with nobody in them. Pillows at the top, indentations in the foam like heads had pressed them recently—but when I ran my hand over one, the impression was cold and bounced back too fast, like memory foam recovering from being squeezed while I wasn’t looking.

At Site 24, every item was centered. Chair in the exact middle of the pad. Cooler in the exact middle of the table. Fire ring stones aligned like someone had taken a carpenter’s square to them.

It all felt like whoever had arranged it had a list that said:

CAMP = CHAIR, FIRE, FOOD, NIGHT

and was checking off boxes, but had never actually sat by a fire in their life.

The bathhouse loomed up out of the dark after Site 30, at the bend where the loop starts to drop toward the amphitheater. Single-story cinderblock rectangle, green metal roof, men’s on the left, women’s on the right, “SHOWERS” sign so faded it just looked like white ghosts of letters.

In my headlights, the doors looked shut. The security light over the center had burned out a long time ago. The tiny window fans were dead. It should have been a black, blank shape.

Instead, light leaked out under the men’s side door. Not bright, not flickering. Steady, like a fluorescent or a cell phone flashlight left face-down.

A minivan squatted in the pull-through next to it. Silver Honda Odyssey with an “I BRAKE FOR HIKERS” bumper sticker, plates from our state. The front windows were fogged. One of those little tree air fresheners hung from the mirror, perfectly still.

My stomach tightened.

I pulled up behind it, angled to point my headlights at the bathhouse door, and got out.

The van’s hood was still warm under my palm. Not hot, but not cold-soaked either. It hadn’t been sitting there for days.

Driver’s door: closed. Back doors: closed. No visible damage. When I cupped my hands around my flashlight and peered in, I saw the usual family disaster: snacks in the cupholders, a crumpled map of the state on the passenger seat, a stuffed animal face-down on the floor in the back.

In the middle row, a kid’s booster seat sat empty. The seat belt lay slack over it like someone had unbuckled in a hurry.

“County, I’ve got a silver Honda Odyssey at Birch Run bathhouse,” I said, giving her the plate. “Appears recently parked. Lights inside men’s side are on. I’m going to make entry.”

“Copy, One,” she said. Her voice was tighter now. “Trooper is twenty-five out if he leaves right this second. You do not go in if you hear a domestic; you back out and wait. You hear me?”

“If they’re screaming at each other, I can live with that,” I said. “If there’s a kid stuck in a stall, I’m not waiting twenty-five.”

I walked up to the bathhouse door.

The light under it pulsed once and steadied. When I touched the handle, it was smooth with Pine-Sol residue, the kind that never fully washes off.

The door opened on the second push. The hinges complained. The smell hit me like a shove.

Pine cleaner, stale piss, old damp concrete. The usual. Under it, something else: a faint metallic tang and a whiff of something like singed plastic.

The light came from three ceiling fixtures in a row, flickering slightly. Tubes coated in dust, buzzing. Those should not have been on. Power to the campground had been cut at the main panel when they closed it.

“Hello?” I called. “Park service. Is anybody in here?”

My voice bounced off tile and cinderblock. No answer.

The men’s side had the usual layout: sinks on one wall, urinals and stalls on the other, showers in the back. Graffiti from before the closure was still visible: “LOGAN ’09,” a crude peace sign, “S+J” in a heart. Someone had tagged “FREE CANDY” on the paper towel dispenser and drawn an arrow to the tampon bin. People are imaginative in the most boring ways.

The stall doors were all open.

The first sink dripped. It had been dripping since the last time I’d done a walk-through in March, and probably for ten years before that. Our plumber keeps telling us he needs a new gasket; our budget keeps telling him to get in line.

On the counter by the third sink, someone had lined up three toothbrushes in a row. Red, blue, purple. Their heads all pointed the same direction, equidistant. No toothpaste in sight.

On the floor next to the diaper changing station, there were shoes.

Four pairs, all neatly against the wall, toes pointing out. Two adult sneakers, women’s size, a little dirt on the sides. One pair of men’s hiking shoes, still knotted. One pair of pink light-up kids’ sneakers with tiny rainbows on the sides.

No socks in them. No feet.

I don’t know how long I stood there looking at that row. My brain tried to make it into “family got ready for bed, left shoes there, went to wash up.” But you don’t leave shoes in the men’s side like that. You don’t line them up like a display.

Something ticked in the far corner, metal on tile, soft and quick. Not pipe noise. Something small making contact with something hard.

“County,” I said, keeping my voice low. “I’ve got a family van, an active-looking campsite, and four empty pairs of shoes lined up in the men’s bathhouse. No people present. It smells like someone mopped in here about an hour ago.”

“You’re not funny, One,” she said. “Trooper is en route, SAR pager is warming up. You get out of that building and wait.”

I took a step toward the shower area instead.

Rationally, I know that was stupid. Or at least unnecessary. But once you’ve seen empty kids’ shoes in a line, you don’t walk away without checking behind the next wall.

The showers were in their own alcove: four stalls with mildewed curtains, two on each side, drains in the middle. The floor sloped, slick with a decade of grime.

The first curtain on the left was closed.

The others were half-open, bunched.

If this were a movie, this is the part where the audience would be yelling at the screen. Real life doesn’t come with background music. It just comes with the sound of your own blood in your ears and the occasional drip hitting tile.

I reached for the closed curtain and pulled it aside.

Empty.

No body in the stall. No pile of clothes. No blood.

Just a plastic laundry basket in the corner with a few damp towels neatly rolled, like a hotel. The towel on top still had the fold crease.

I let the curtain fall. It moved sluggishly, plastic sticking to itself.

Something brushed my shoulder.

I jerked, spun, nearly slipped.

Nothing was there.

The air, though, had moved. A slow shift, like someone had walked past quickly.

The dripping at the sink had stopped.

All three fluorescent fixtures flickered at once, a quick stutter, then steadied. The buzz rose a pitch, then settled.

“Okay,” I said aloud. “Okay. Enough.”

I backed out, step by step, never turning my back fully on the room until I hit the outer door with my shoulder and pushed through into the night. The cool air hit my face like a slap.

The minivan sat where I’d left it. My truck’s hazard lights winked, forgotten. The arranged campsites stood in their careful little patterns.

Every hair on my arms was standing up.

“County, One,” I said. “Men’s bathhouse is empty of people. I’ve got fresh personal items and some weird staging: shoes, toothbrushes, towels. I’m going to do a quick check of the amphitheater hill and then get the hell out of here until backup arrives.”

“Language noted,” she said. “Miller’s awake. You’re on a short leash, Ortega.”

“Understood,” I said.

The amphitheater sits below the bathhouse, down a short footpath lined with timbers that are now mostly rot and moss. Four curved rows of log benches face a concrete pad and a metal fire circle. Behind it is a little wooden stage with a roof and a place to hang a projection screen.

When they closed the campground, they stacked benches from the lower loop there. Last time I’d seen it, it was a messy pile under dust and leaves.

Tonight, the path down was clear.

Every log bench was back in its original place. Four rows, evenly spaced, facing the stage. Someone had scraped moss off the tops and flipped the ones that were too rotten. The concrete pad had been swept. No branches, no leaves, no dirt.

The fire circle in front of the stage was full of stones, arranged in a tidy ring.

My flashlight cut across the benches, then landed on the stage.

There was someone standing there.

For half a second, that was the only way my brain could phrase it: someone. Upright shape in the light.

Then the details came into focus.

It was built out of campground debris.

A stack of camp chairs formed the torso, nested together, their legs splayed for balance. Two coolers stood where hips should be. Four folding tables leaned together to make the rough outline of legs. A bundle of rolled sleeping bags was lashed across the top for shoulders. On that sat a cluster of lanterns—five of them, old Coleman fuel lamps and new battery ones, arranged in a rough circle with their glass globes facing out.

All of them were on.

Not bright. A low, gut-level glow from each, so the cluster of them made a single dull corona. Light fell across the benches in a fan.

From where I stood, it looked like a person giving a talk. A ranger in a pile of borrowed gear.

No one had tied this together with rope. There weren’t any obvious straps holding it. The pieces seemed to lean and balance on each other in a way that shouldn’t have held as still as it did.

As I watched, one of the lanterns in the “head” bundle pulsed. The light inside flared, dimmed, flared, not in sync with the others. The surrounding glass caught and magnified it.

A sound drifted out.

Not a voice at first. A murmur. The faint rustle you get when a campground is half full and people are talking at their own fires, layered on each other. Laughter in the mix, kids arguing about s’mores, someone playing music too low to identify.

It seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere. Then my ear picked out the source: a cheap Bluetooth speaker wedged on the stage floor by the table-legs, its blue light blinking. It crackled and repeated a four-second loop.

“…no, you had the last one—hey, quit it—no, you had the last one—hey, quit it—”

The same snippet, over and over. Young boy’s voice, maybe nine or ten. The laughter on the loop didn’t quite match the words.

I took a step back up the path. Gravel shifted under my heel.

The whole figure on the stage tilted a fraction in my direction.

Not much. Just enough for the lanterns to throw new angles of light.

I hadn’t seen what was behind it before.

Against the back wall of the stage, in the shadow line, there were outlines. Three. Human-sized. Slumped.

As my light swept, it picked out fabric: a grown man’s jacket, a soft blue women’s hoodie, a child’s red raincoat. They were arranged upright, empty, sleeves dangling. The hoods were pulled up. The fronts were zipped.

Under each set of clothes, at floor level, sat a pair of shoes that matched the line I’d seen in the bathhouse: the adult sneakers, the hiking shoes, the little rainbow light-ups.

Their toes pointed toward the stacked gear figure.

I didn’t go up to touch them. I’d like to say I was thinking about evidence preservation. Mostly I was thinking about my own hands never forgiving me.

The lanterns on the “head” flickered again. The light inside one, a green Coleman, wavered like heat. Around the glass, just at the edges, I saw movement.

Not reflection. Not dust.

Something pale, slick, and many-jointed slid along the inner curve of the globe. It looked like a centipede had been flattened and stretched, its segments pushing against the glass in tiny waves. Where it passed, the light brightened for a heartbeat, then dimmed, like it was pulling power.

The Bluetooth speaker glitched.

The loop hiccuped, then changed.

“…Ben, did you get the—”

My name cracked out of it in an adult woman’s voice, half overlaid by static. It wasn’t my full name, just the first syllable, but it hit hard enough to make my chest tight.

The lantern glow swelled. The gear structure shifted a little more, pieces creaking. One of the sleeping bags at the top slumped and then righted itself like something inside had flexed.

Whatever was in the lanterns moved faster.

The scent of pine cleaner and burnt plastic got stronger.

A spray of gravel shot down from behind me as if someone had kicked it, though I hadn’t moved. The hair at the back of my neck prickled.

There’s a moment on a call when you realize you’re no longer in control of the scene. That you’re not the one deciding what happens next. I’ve had it with drunk drivers, with angry parents, with a black bear that wasn’t impressed by bear spray.

This was different. Less “someone’s going to punch me” and more “something here doesn’t care whether I exist.”

The stacked gear figure gave the tiniest lurch, like it had tried to take a step and hadn’t quite worked out how.

The second lantern from the left in the “head” cracked. Just a hairline. Light flared through it like it was pushing to get out.

I didn’t wait to see what happened if it did.

I turned and ran.

I wasn’t graceful about it. I slipped twice on the gravel path, whacked my shin on a timber, caught myself on a birch trunk at the top. My radio banged against my chest.

“County, One, I’m leaving the amphitheater,” I said between breaths. “There’s… I don’t know how to phrase this without sounding insane. There’s a large structure made of camping gear on the stage, with active lanterns and some kind of… insect or fungal growth in the globes. I’ve got empty clothes arranged like people against the back wall. No bodies. I’m backing out now.”

Silence on the other end for a beat.

Then: “Copy, One,” County said, in a voice that said she was writing every word down even while her brain was rejecting it. “Trooper is fifteen out. Miller wants you at your truck. Repeat: at your truck. Right now.”

“Already on my way,” I said.

As I skirted the bathhouse, every fluorescent tube inside blinked off at once. The seam under the door went from white to black. The humming stopped dead.

The van’s hazard lights flashed once, even though I hadn’t touched them. All four at the same time.

I threw myself into my truck, turned the key, and swung the headlights toward the entry road.

For a second, as the beams passed over the loop, I saw every site that had been arranged—the chairs, the coolers, the sleeping bags, the rings of stones. Each one caught the light at a slightly different angle. The metal parts glinted.

A breeze came down the hill, gentle, carrying the faint sound of something soft shifting. Canvas. Nylon. Tarps rubbing against each other.

I did not look back as I drove out.

At the gate, the chain I’d left hanging loose was threaded back through the posts, the padlock sitting open in its usual place. The camera’s red LED blinked twice, then died.

I pulled through, got out, and snapped the lock shut myself.

My hands were shaking hard enough that it took three tries.

Officially, the search started at first light.

Unofficially, I was back at Birch Run with Miller and two deputies before sunrise, watching our breath in the cold and telling myself daylight would make everything look stupid.

We swept the campground: upper loop, lower loop, bathhouse, amphitheater, creek crossings. SAR volunteers in orange vests pushed through willows along the water. A K9 unit sniffed the trails. The helicopter from the next county over did a couple of lazy circles at mid-morning, servo whine drifting down.

We found the van, same as I had. We found the campsite at Site 14, chairs, cooler, stove, lantern—now dead. We found the neat shoes in the men’s bathhouse, the toothbrushes in a row, the basket of towels.

The amphitheater was not the same.

The benches were piled again, all heaped at one side like someone had broken down an event in a hurry. The stage was bare. No stacked gear figure, no lantern bundles, no speaker, no clothes arranged against the back wall.

We did find a few things that shouldn’t have been there.

A patch of the concrete at the edge of the stage was scorched in a perfect circle about two feet across, as if someone had set a metal barrel there and burned something hot. The blackened area smelled faintly of melted plastic.

In the crack between the stage and the back wall, Miller reached down with gloved fingers and fished out a sliver of glass. It was curved and cloudy, with a thin smear of something pale along the inside.

“From a lantern globe?” one of the deputies asked.

“Maybe,” Miller said. He held it up to the light. The pale smear had a texture. Not powder. Not dried fuel. More like the membrane inside an egg.

He dropped it into an evidence bag and sealed it.

We logged everything. We did the door-to-door with the plate number. We got a call from a worried sister in Tucson who said her brother, his wife, and their eight-year-old had left on a camping trip and hadn’t checked in. Their names matched the registration on the van. We kept looking.

We never found them.

The official narrative settled into place with depressing ease. “Family entered closed campground, possibly via social media tip. Camped in unsafe area. Evidence suggests they may have gone down to the creek after dark. High water from upstream release could have swept them downstream toward the reservoir.”

People like water stories. They’re neat. No monsters, no questions about what else we don’t control. Just current and bad luck.

There’s a line in the final report about “unusual staging of campsites and personal effects, likely the work of unrelated trespassers over years of closure.” It made someone at Region headquarters feel better to put it there. It makes me feel worse every time I see it.

A week after we stopped active searching—the first week of October—I went back once, in the middle of the day, because apparently I don’t learn.

I told myself I was checking the locks and batteries. Making sure the signs were still up. Seeing if someone had broken into the van now that it had become part of the scenery.

It was a bright, thin noon. Aspen leaves had just begun to go from green to gold at the edges. The sky was that high, blank blue that promises colder nights soon. Highway 17 sounded different in the daylight; tire noise has a separate pitch when you’re not listening for anything else.

At the kiosk, someone had flipped the old “Campground Full” tag around so the blank side faced out. All the little reservation stubs along the bottom were torn off again except one.

That one had a name written on it in block letters: ORTEGA.

I stared at it for a while, counted to fifty, then carefully pulled it off and folded it into my pocket. It wasn’t my handwriting. The ink was fresh enough that it smudged on my thumb.

On the upper loop, the sites were messier than before. Rocks scattered, chairs knocked over. Like someone had taken a hand across a toy box.

At Site 14, the cooler was gone. The chairs were still there, collapsed.

The bathhouse was truly dead this time. No power, no smell of cleaner. The row of shoes was missing one of the adult pairs; there was a damp mark on the floor where they’d been, shaped like the soles had been wet when someone stood in them.

I did not go down to the amphitheater.

I stood at the top of the path and listened. Wind in the leaves. A jay complaining. A distant truck on the highway.

Under it, for a second, I heard the faint, tinny burst of a child’s laugh, cut off mid-giggle. Not from the stage. From somewhere between the sites, like someone had turned a speaker on and off.

I walked back to my truck without looking toward where I thought it came from.

We never did get footage from the gate camera that made sense.

The system out there is old. It records motion in twenty-second bursts, overwrites itself every seventy-two hours. That night, at 00:39, the logs say it triggered and saved.

The file plays as fifteen seconds of empty road, headlights just leaving frame, the edge of my truck as I drove in.

For the last five seconds, the chain across the gate moves.

It lifts, droops, lifts again. Not like someone took it off. More like someone underneath it was trying to wriggle out without being noticed. There’s no hand, no body, no shadow. Just the metal rising and falling in smooth arcs, then settling.

I’ve shown it to two different IT guys and one state wildlife biologist. The IT guys shrugged and blamed compression glitches. The biologist watched it twice, frowned, and suggested wind gusts.

There are no leaves moving in the background when the chain lifts.

Nobody’s written anything about that part down. Files are already thick. Budgets are already thin. The last thing anyone wants is a line in a report that says “chain moved on its own.”

So Birch Run stays on the spreadsheet as “Closed — Unsafe Infrastructure.” We tell people the ground there is unstable. That the creek could cut the bank out from under them. That the bathhouse is condemned. All of that is technically true.

We don’t mention the amphitheater. Or the shoes in the men’s side. Or the way campsite setups appear and disappear between patrols.

Every once in a while, a motion alarm still goes off on the gate, usually on still nights. We send the newest ranger out to “take a look,” in daylight, with a partner. They come back with stories about beer cans, graffiti, the usual.

Last month, one of them mentioned seeing a fresh ring of stones around the fire circle at Site 18, no ash, no soot. He said it looked like someone did it just to do it.

“Probably kids,” he said. “Bored kids.”

I nodded and wrote it down like it was nothing.

When I’m honest, I think there’s something in that bowl of trees that hates an empty campground.

I think it learned some version of “camp” from decades of families showing up with their coolers and chairs and plastic lanterns, playing their little songs into the night. I think when the state shut it down, whatever was watching didn’t understand why the pattern stopped.

Now, whenever somebody sneaks in, it studies them. It takes their layout. It copies what it can. It keeps trying to build a full house out of whatever people leave lying around: chairs, shoes, towels, recordings.

Maybe it miscounts sometimes. Maybe it keeps more than it should.

These days, when I’m on lakeside patrol and catch the Birch Run turnoff sign in my side mirror, I keep my eyes on the highway. If the radio crackles and County says “motion at Birch Run” and “911 ping near the old payphone,” I have a sudden urgent need to check the far west boundary fence, or count buoys, or anything that keeps me busy somewhere with other people in shouting distance.

The new rangers roll their eyes. They think I’ve gone soft. “It’s just an abandoned campground,” one of them said last week. “What’s it going to do, bore you to death?”

Miller doesn’t say much. He just glances at me when Birch Run comes up on the call sheet, then quietly assigns someone else.

On the nights I can’t sleep and end up driving, I sometimes pull off at mile marker 142 and sit where the highway curves. From there you can see a suggestion of the Birch Run bowl, a dark patch of trees against slightly darker hills.

If I roll the window down, I can hear the wind and the occasional hiss of a semi on the grade.

Once—just once—I thought I heard something else under it. The sharp little thunk of a cooler lid closing. The click of a lantern dial.

When I got back to the station that night, the coffee pot had boiled itself dry. The ring in the bottom took twenty minutes of scrubbing to get out.

I try not to think about the timing.

I didn’t say my name out loud in the truck on the way home.

Some things out there don’t need any more help putting a place card down.
