It started when I moved into the old Victorian house just outside of town. The rent was almost suspiciously cheap, but as a broke college student, I wasn’t in any position to ask questions. The place had charm—creaky hardwood floors, high ceilings, and enough room for me to actually stretch out. It was perfect, or so I thought.

During my first week there, I found the door. It was in the basement, tucked away behind old furniture and dust-covered boxes. Heavy and made of iron, it was padlocked with a thick, rusted chain. I didn’t think much of it at first. Probably an old storage room the previous owners had locked up and forgotten. I wasn’t curious enough to investigate.

But then the noises started.

At first, it was subtle—just a soft scratching sound, almost like rats scurrying behind the walls. I figured it was an old house, probably full of pests. But then, after a few days, the scratching turned into something else. Faint, barely audible, but unmistakable: whispering.

It came late at night, usually around 3 AM. A soft murmur of voices, too quiet to make out, but constant. I tried to ignore it, convincing myself that it was just the wind, or my mind playing tricks on me. But no matter what I did, the whispers persisted. They seemed to come from behind the locked door, almost as if something—or someone—was trapped behind it.

One night, the whispers stopped, replaced by something worse. A knock. Three slow, rhythmic knocks. Then silence. I stayed awake, heart pounding in my chest, waiting for the sound to return. When it did, I was frozen in place. Three knocks. Silence. Over and over again, every few minutes, like clockwork.

I finally worked up the nerve to call the landlord. I hadn’t wanted to bother him with complaints, but this was different. I needed answers. When I asked about the door, there was a long pause on the other end of the line. “Whatever you do,” he said slowly, “don’t open it.”

I laughed, thinking it was some kind of joke, but his tone was deadly serious. “Just leave it alone,” he warned before hanging up.

That night, the knocking was louder. More insistent. Every time I tried to fall asleep, it would jolt me awake. I went down to the basement, heart hammering in my chest, and saw the door, standing there like always—silent and unmoving. I shone a flashlight on the padlock, tugged at the chain. It was still securely fastened. But the knocking continued, louder now, more frantic.

Two weeks passed, and the knocking never stopped. By this point, I was barely sleeping, nerves frayed from the endless sound. I started to hear my name in the whispers, soft but unmistakable. Then one night, something changed.

Around 3 AM, the knocking grew violent, like someone—or something—was desperately trying to get out. Then came a metallic click. I ran down the stairs, only to find the padlock lying on the floor. The door was ajar, just a sliver, and cold air was seeping through the crack.

I stood there for what felt like hours, flashlight shaking in my hand. The door creaked open a little more, revealing a staircase that spiraled down into darkness. It made no sense—the basement shouldn’t go any deeper. But as I stood there, trying to comprehend what I was seeing, I heard it again. A whisper. My name, spoken clearly this time.

Against every instinct, I reached out and pulled the door open wider, shining the flashlight into the void. I could see nothing but black. Then, from the darkness, I felt it—a cold, skeletal hand wrapped around my ankle.

I screamed, stumbling backward, kicking wildly until the grip loosened. The door slammed shut on its own, and the padlock snapped back into place. For a moment, everything was quiet.

But now, every night at 3 AM, I hear that familiar metallic click. The padlock breaks, the door creaks open, and something whispers my name from the darkness below.

I don’t know how much longer I can resist.
