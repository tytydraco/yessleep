That night, I found myself staring at the clock hanging on the grim, grey wall of the office. Just one more minute until it struck twelve. My eyes tracked the relentless march of the second hand, each tick pounding in my skull. I waited, almost holding my breath, eager for the chime to echo throughout the room to momentarily shatter this oppressive silence. Glancing at the window behind me, I noticed the rain coming down hard now, a relentless torrent barely visible through the fogged glass. I squinted, trying to see through the thick mist, and managed to make out the blurred shapes of the street and a solitary tree swaying violently in the storm. My eyes fixated on a single raindrop, slowly crawling down the window, its path lost in the drowning sound of rain echoing louder in my ears. I felt a smile crept onto my face as I slumped into my chair, giving it a spin. The motion was disorienting, but I didn’t care. I stopped abruptly, my hands slamming onto the desk, slick with sweat. My gaze fell on the phone beside me. Not a single call had come through since the start of my shift. The silence was unnerving, especially on a night like this.



The chime finally ceased, leaving me once again in suffocating quiet—only the relentless ticking of the clock to keep me company. A wave of nausea crept up on me, the air growing thick with the stench of rot, like sulfur and decay. The room felt colder, more oppressive, and I felt my heart heavy. A cold  touch brushed along my shoulder. I felt eyes on my back, watching, waiting. I fought the urge to look over my shoulder, then the phone rang.

“Ring… Ring… Ring…”

 

I froze, my breath catching in my throat, my gaze locked on the ringing phone. My hand hovered over it, trembling. Just as the fourth ring was about to dissolve into silence, I finally picked it up. The voice on the other end made my blood run cold, not because of what it said, but because of who it sounded like. The voice on the line grew more frantic, more desperate with every passing second. Tears welled up in my eyes, dread settling in my gut like a leaden weight. My hands shook as I forced out the words, my throat dry and tight.

“This is 911, what’s your emergency?”

 

A shaky, terrified voice responded,

“Th-there’s someone outside my house. He—”

 

A sudden flash of lightning illuminated the dark office, followed by a deafening crash of thunder that seemed to come from the phone itself. The sound of the rain, once a comfort, now felt distant, drowned out by the rising panic in the caller’s voice. I cradled the phone between my ear and shoulder, fumbling through my desk for a pen.

“Ma’am, what’s your address?”

 

The sobbing quieted, replaced by the sound of sniffling.

“12 Avenu—”

 

The words cut off abruptly, leaving an eerie silence in their wake. Then, I heard it—a soft, almost imperceptible knocking, and the ticks of the clock seemed to grow louder, more menacing, echoing out of the phone speakers. The sensation of being watched returned, colder, more intense.



I looked out the window again. The mist was thicker, but I could just make out a dark figure standing motionless in the middle of the road. It looked up, and I felt its eyes on me, a malignant presence that seemed to seep into my very soul, almost as if it was right in front of him. I couldn’t blink, couldn’t look away. Something about that figure held me captive, a sickening sense of déjà vu, as if I’d encountered it before—in a nightmare, or worse. The stench of blood filled my nostrils, and I knew, deep down, that this was far from over.

“She’s gone,” came the voice, now eerily calm, devoid of the earlier panic. I was stunned, my mind struggling to process the words.

“I’m sorry, you were too late.”

 

The line went dead, replaced by the cold, mechanical tone of a recorded message.

“The number you have dialed is unavailable. Please check the number and try again.”

 

The phone slipped from my hand, and I collapsed to my knees, the weight of despair crushing me. I stared out the window, tears streaming down my face, as the dark figure remained still.



And then, as if by some cruel twist of fate, a car hurtled down the street, its headlights cutting through the mist, and struck the figure. The impact was brutal, final, and the silence that followed was even more terrifying.
