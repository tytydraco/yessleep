I was chosen to participate in this experiment where I get to live in the mall for two weeks. It was a research to find out if a person can survive in the mall with just what's inside the mall and nothing else, it's also for mental/psychological purpose.

My brother envied me. He joked about trying it out if another experiment like this will be held. I told him it's not a big deal and it's just for two weeks. Besides, I'm not allowed to use wifi and internet. They gave me an old keypad phone for emergency purpose only, no social media for me.

"Oh, honey why did you agree to this? This is dangerous, ooh." Haha, my mom, like any other moms, she's worried about small stuff like this.

"I'll be fine, Mom. Also this is fun!" I hugged her and then I slapped my brother's back. "You take care of Mom and Dad will ya?" He smiled at me and hugged me. "I will, Bro."

My dad doesn't care much but I know he thought of me and Bro as stupid for getting too excited for this. "Don't mess things up. Your mom is surely gonna miss you and I'll never forgive you if she cries. Take care of yourself." He patted my shoulder. "I promise, Pops."

"You ready, kid?" One of the researchers asked. "Yes." I'm ready and I sure am excited.

They opened the huge glass door. I stepped in. My first steps felt like I'm in an intro of an action movie. I looked around and slowly turned in circle. I feel like a kid being transported to a candy town.

I looked around and every corner seemed to hold a promise of comfort and new memories.

My keypad phone rang and I picked it up, a final message before I'll be left alone. "We will be leaving you now," a man said. I smiled. "Ok, thank you."

I walked around. The whole place felt like it belonged to me, wait... it does belong to me in some way! I'm allowed to use and eat everything in there. They took away the expensive ones like TVs, fridges, laptops, etc., but I don't need them so it's ok. I immediately looked for the books section and there it was. I wondered through the aisles with a sense of wonder. Every books offered a new world to dive into.

I grabbed one that took my interest the most so far. "I can spend my time here as long as I can when I have these things around." I giggled and started my reading adventure.

After reading I felt sleepy. I looked for something to lay my body on. They took away the beds too for sure. I found a cheap comfortable flat sofa and I slept there. "Hmm comfy. Not bad." I thought.

I think I slept for 3-4 hours. When I opened my eyes I forgot that I'm not in my home. I sat on the sofa for awhile trying to warm up my senses. I stood and wandered around again. The mall was still lovely as usual- silent, mysterious, fun, full of possibilities.

I looked outside the glass walls from the outermost part of the mall. I relaxed my mind. "The outside view from here is so peaceful."

I went back to the book shelves to read again. And after I read I felt sleepy again. And just like before, I slept on the sofa.

The night came. I was looking for a more comfortable thing to sleep on. I found a pikachu-designed mattress and I unrolled it and layed it on the floor. It was a good thing they let the lights on even during the nights so I can grab anything I want before I sleep.

Something bothered me that I wasn't prepared for- mosquitoes. I looked for an insect repellent lotion and squeezed a handful and rubbed some all over my body, even my face. The amount of mosquitoes attacking me was insane I let out a soft rage. The repellent wasn't enough. I looked for a mosquito net and set it up.

I woke up, it's morning. I forgot again that I was in the mall and not in my precious home. I stood and looked for stuffs for my hygiene. I brushed my teeth and took a bath.

And for my anti-boredom routine I went to the books again to read. When I tried to read I wasn't in the mood. I wanna try something else.

I looked in the toys section and found a lego set. I played it for like 20 minutes until I got bored. I found a play-doh and played it for the same amount of time and got bored. I went back to reading again.

The same routine happened. After reading and endulging myself in different kinds of entertainment I'm gonna sleep early. My mattress and mosquito net were already set up cause I didn't put them back just in case I'll be lazy to set them up again.

As I was trying to sleep, for the first time alone in the mall, I felt fear. The silence was killing me and I felt like someone or something was observing me. I tried not to think of anything and closed my eyes until I successfully slept.

The next morning I woke up still lying on my mattress, I felt a bit of loneliness. Just like the days before I forgot that I'm in the mall. But I can't just lie there, I need to enjoy. I still have days left.

This time I did a workout to stay fit. I exercised and lift dumbells. I jogged around the mall and did a 1 minute plank later.

I sat on a soft chair to catch my breath. I drank water and took a rest.

When I stood up and walked around I felt some kind of anxiety. It didn't take long for me to finally fully realize that I'm alone. I'm alone in a huge mall. It is something many people are scared of, and now I'm starting to feel it too.

I want to shake off my fear so I sang a joyful song "Tell me why, ain't nothing but a heartache ðŸŽ¶" I sang loudly and I try to sound funny. But my anxiety is also fighting back.

"I want it that way, yeeaahh ðŸŽ¶" I started dancing also. I'm desperate to fight my fear. I went to the book shelves and found a book that has Mr. Bean as a cover. This is what I need. I need to laugh, I need to be happy.

The funny book helped a bit. I forgot how scared I am. Until the night comes.

I try to sleep as fast as possible. I'm starting to be scared of the empty silent vibe of the mall. But then I feel something I don't wanna feel, I wanna pee.

I wish I can just pee in the mattress since I can just replace it with a new one. But what am I gonna tell them if they saw a wet mattress in the trash? "Oh haha the participant who was a grown ass man peed on that." I maybe scared, but I don't wanna get embarrassed.

I looked for the bathroom. But then I suddenly imagined being followed and I ran as fast as I can to find it quickly. Finally I reached the bathroom and flushed and ran again.

I stopped running and walked towards my sleeping area. But as I was walking I half-consciously saw a dark figure facing towards me from afar. I know I'm just imagining things but I'm really scared and I gasped. "Ahhh!! Ahhh!! No no no!!" I got scared and went inside my mosquito net as fast as I can and tried to sleep immediately.

The next morning is the time I finally thought to myself "I don't feel fine." The same routine as usual, I read, played, read, exercised, anything I can do to avoid boredom and loneliness. I slept for a few minutes. And then I looked for another book to read.

As I was exploring the books I saw something I shouldn't see. A horror book. The cover itself was scary. It showed an old woman sitting in her chair. She's crying, her eyes were all pure black and on her lap was a decapitated head of an old man, probably her husband.

I want to forget that image. When the night comes that image stayed in my mind. When I got ready to sleep and lied on my mattress I turned to my side and my mind created an illusion that someone was facing me. I screamed.

"AAAAGGHHHH!! AGGHHH!!"

I can't believe what was happening to me. I started to cry. That's it. I gave up. I called the number in my phone.

"H-hello? (sob)," hoping someone will answer. "Yes? Are you ok there?" Someone replied, thank goodness.

"I wanna stop this now. I wanna go home (sniff) I'm sorry."

The man tried to reassure me "Are you sure? You don't want the prize? We will surely give it to you if you make it in two weeks. You just made it through 4 days."

The prize money was $200. It wasn't much because they know everything you need is in the mall. They just set a prize because they want to make sure someone will participate in this experiment.

"Yes I'm sure. I wanna stop this. I'm sorry." I wiped my tears.

"Tomorrow we'll pick you up. Just hang on."

"Thank you." I put down my phone. I closed my eyes and hoped to finally be set free tomorrow.

The next day came. I was waiting outside with my eyes still red from crying and not enough sleep. A black van came, and then our car. First to approach me was Mom.

"Oh my baby!" My mom's warm embrace. I miss it so much.

"I miss y'all." I wanna show them that I'm fine.

Before we head home the researchers interviewed me. I talked about my experience and how I used my time and my resources wisely.

"Thank you for participating." The man shook my hand.

When the researchers went on their way they left a folder containing papers about the previous attempts of their experiment.

"They forgot something." I showed it to my family.

"We must give it back. Honey, do you still have their number?" Dad asked. Mom took out her phone. "Yeah I'll give them a call."

I got curious about their papers so I flip through the pages. I saw a page that contains photos and aftermaths of the previous participants:

David Jackson- 1 week and 3 days. Suffered from paranoia. Can't speak. Shell-shocked face.

Belle Clarisse Martin- Presumably dead after 2 days. Suffered from stomach rupture and possible cause was eating everything she can eat in the mall.

Gavin Taylor- Presumably dead after 6 days. We forgot to give him the phone. Was found dead with glass shards all over him but the cause of death was poison. Was probably trying to escape by throwing chairs at the glass door but shards got into his eyes and slipped on the floor full of glass shards. He suffered too much pain and eventually grabbed any inedible liquid to kill himself.
