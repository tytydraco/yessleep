My parents live up North, and so every Christmas my drive to their house is defined by a lot of grey, brown and white, as well as bitter cold.

Never liked the cold. I spent the first 18 years of my life in it, so I think I definitely have an educated opinion on it.

I don’t like the passionless white-skied coldness, or the stark freeze of the deep dark night where you can see your breath billowing out from you like a smokestack, and I especially don’t like when the sky is a deceptive bright blue sunny, the rippled clouds all golden and hazy purple, and you go outside thinking it’ll be warm and it’s still fucking cold. I’m not a fan.

This year, I was alone driving up. My girlfriend of one year left me for some skier shithead a month ago and I thought better than to take my dog all that way with me, I didn’t want to clean my brand new car of dog crap or piss.

It wasn’t that bad really. I mostly just listened to this podcast I like, or when I got bored of that, turned on the radio and endured whatever shit people like nowadays.

Come to think about it, it was probably the first of these Christmas drives in years where I’d been alone. I always had ‘the new girl’, as my Dad called them, with me. Even though looking back he was right to call them that, but it was always nice company.

Though this time, I was all alone with my thoughts. You must have heard that horribly recycled thing about being alone with your thoughts?

I thought a lot about what I’d done to deserve everything I currently have. Don’t get me wrong, I could have a worse life, I could be on the streets or live in some exotic place where they blow up kids, but I could certainly have a better life.

A lot of people talk about ‘seasonal depression’, but I like to think that the specific depression I was feeling on the way there was a bit more circumstantial, even if I do hate the winter. At some point, I guess the crappy music just got to me, and I resorted instead to just seething.

Point is, I was feeling shitty, and what happened on the way to my parents did the antithesis of helping.

Around four fifths of the way to my parent’s house, I killed something. 

I’m sure that when it wasn’t a mound of vaguely grey woolly flesh horrifically croaking for a clean death I would have been able to tell what it was. 

However, when I disembarked, cursing, from my nice AC-warmed car out into the bitter shittyness of rural buttfuck nowhere, I thought at first I’d run down some kind of alien.

The bump I felt when I hit it was terrifying. I literally felt myself bouncing an inch off my seat when it happened, and I hit my knees real hard on the steering wheel. If it had felt smaller, I probably would’ve kept going, but considering how wracking it felt, I thought I should probably check it out. Initially it even crossed my mind that I might have hit a human being.

I never got too close to it (I was probably going faster than I had any business going) but I’d estimate it was around the size of some kind of deer.

As you may have guessed from my likely annoying amount of complaining about God’s Green Earth, I’m not too much of an outdoors person, so I’m not 100% clear on all the beasts of the wild. I don’t think it was a deer, anyway. I couldn’t see any antlers or horns or anything.

I’d like to say that I went over and gave it a humane, clean shot to the head like I was Davy Crockett or something, but instead I just sort of…watched it. I did have a gun, but I just couldn’t be bothered.

I should have, I guess. I hit it, I could have at least apologised by blowing its brains out.

I realised how morbid it was for me to just be watching whatever it was die so I went back to the car.

Like I said, it looked like a deer, and since in most places you’re meant to report hitting that kind of stuff, I phoned 911.

As you can imagine, the connection in some frosty rural road is pretty shaky, so the quality and the swiftness wasn’t incredible.

The sheriff of the nearest town (which was actually pretty far away) got on the call after a bit, and I told him what happened. 

I initially thought that he sounded a bit too concerned for the circumstances, though I guessed this may have just been the effect of the crappy connection out there messing with the audio.

“Any idea what it might have been?” He asked. He had a very warm, firm voice, the sort of male you might refer to as a ‘feller’, or a ‘bloke’ if you had the misfortune of being British.

“No, I’ve not gotten a look at it up close. Don’t really want to, y’know, get all personal with it.” In comparison, my voice was small and weedy. The sort of male you’d call a ‘boy’, or ‘son’.

“Perfectly understandable sir.” I could tell right off the bat he didn’t respect me. He said this with that sort of professional amusement that has just a hitch of sarcasm in it. “You see how big it was?”

“Yeah, around the size of a deer.”

“Shit.” He said. Now there was a kind of fear in his voice, I thought, an extremely sudden switch. “Alright. Shit, uhh, I’ll come get you, I’ll be about an hour. It’ll be dark by then.”

“What? What do you mean you can come and get me? I have a car-”

“No, listen, you gotta stay there son, okay?” He said. “I can’t really explain it, alright, you just gotta stay put. You can stay in the car, but you can’t drive anywhere. Roundabout where are you?”

I told him. The car was feeling quite cold at this point.

“Fuck.” He said. The car got colder. “That’s close. Listen, you see any signs for a town called Orwell?”

“Yeah. Isn’t that where you are?”

“I’m from Maypool.” He said. “Listen, don’t move and definitely don’t get any closer to whatever the signs say is Orwell, alright? I’m coming, son.”

“I don’t understand-” The call cut off before my timid little voice could protest.

*Well great.* I thought. *Stuck with the rotting corpse of some thing in the middle of nowhere near some town that doesn’t exist where it’s also fucking freezing.*

I lasted about ten minutes waiting for him before I gave up. *I bet he was probably just trying to mess with me, I don’t need to ‘stay put’. Anyway, I have somewhere to be!*

But when I tried to move the car, nothing happened except it crawling a few inches then making a sorrowful gasping noise.

I got out, and before I could look at what happened, I was struck by how silent the forests were now. The thing I’d hit had finally given in, but I also noticed that there were no more birds singing in the trees.

It was dusk now, the reddish sky making the snow capped trees look like the shadows of giant slender creatures.

My tires had been scratched out. Not popped, but clawed, with clear scratch marks on them.

This, combined with the eerie silence, terrified me.

At this point, I was pretty damn certain that I wasn’t waiting around with that rotting thing in my broken down car, so I set off running down the road, breathing faster than the speed at which my feet hit the gravel.

I was also pretty certain that the sheriff was, for whatever reason, trying to trick me somehow, so I ignored his orders and headed straight for Orwell.

The woods were all silent, not a single sound but the hollow wind between the nearby trees.

At one point, I spotted a small creature, what I assumed was a wolverine or a beaver or something, skitter across the road, followed by several other small creatures which I assumed it would usually hunt.

There was something so orderly, so official about the way they pounced before me one after the other, that gave me the impression that this was a show of some sort of power, meant to intimidate me.

At this point I was regretting leaving the car. I could suddenly hear the birds, just about as the sun began to go down. I got out my revolver, which I’d taken from the car, and clutched it into myself.

By this time it was nearly pitch black, the road before me almost as dark as the thickness of the forest.

All the time, I’d been following the signs to Orwell, and as I passed one, I noticed a little brown bird sitting on it, staring at me.

I looked at it too for a while. The little beast didn’t do anything for a moment, just continued to look back at me with its beady, dead little eyes. Then it spoke to me, spoke broken English in a high pitched, hushed voice.

“Your leaving this place. It does not belong to yours anymore.”

I did not respond, only looked at it dumbfounded, my eyes and mouth wide open.

“What?” I squeaked.

“Leaving. Your did to brother. Splat! Him vengeanced if your stay.” Then it took flight, flapping rapidly away from me.

“Risk by talking to your. Take it as bless.” It said as it disappeared into the woods.

Refusing to think about what just happened, I immediately got my phone back out, going back the direction I went. *Fuck this. The cop was right.*

“Maypool Police Department, who-” The sheriff answered. His voice was properly distorted now, however I could faintly hear the sounds of the landscape whipping past outside his car, as well as what I thought were several more people inside of the car with him.

“I-its me, the guy who called you earlier?” I stammered.

“Right. I’m still on my way.” He said, gargled slightly by the shitty connection. “You’re still in the car, right?”

I was tentative to answer. “No, I got out.”

“What!? Why-fuck. Never mind. Get back to the car right now dumbass! Shit, have they seen you yet?!”

“Have who-”

I stopped in my tracks.

On the road before me were three figures.

Each was upright, like humans, and held large poles with sharp tips. It was apparent, however, that they were far from human.

The things on the road were too long, too lithe and strangely proportioned to be human, and even in the dark I could see that all over them they had fur.

Two had great antlers, sprouting from their heads, which made them appear almost regal, alongside their great slender bodies.

The third, who was shorter and more squatter, had the curved horns of a ram.

The anthropomorphic nature of the creatures was not, however, the most disturbing part of what I had been faced with. All three were mounted on wretched creatures much smaller than them.

The three beasts which the bipedal animals sat on, shivering and dribbling on the road, where humans. Naked humans, with their tongues gormlessly lulling from their mouths and their bleeding, hardened knees and hands on the gravel of the road.

The antlered rider at the front called something to me, and the men on all fours began to trudge forwards.

I immediately turned and ran towards the sign which indicated that Orwell was nearby, still clinging on to the hope that it was a real town.

I heard the things behind me give chase, whooping and bleating in what sounded like excitement as their ‘steeds’ cried out in pain, hands and knees slapping across the gravel.

I turned left, stumbling through the thick tangle of the snow carpeted woods. I had dropped my phone somewhere along the road, and now all I held was my gun.

I dared not look back, even as I heard them crying out mockingly for me in the distance.

Distracted by the need to move from my pursuers and quickly as possible, by foot caught on a tree root and I was tripped, hitting the ground hard. I then fell down a short crop of hill, tumbling into the underbrush and ripping my coat beyond repair in the roots of the tree.

When I got to the bottom, I felt a pang of sharp pain reverberate around my skull as my forehead struck another rock.

While I rolled, I attempted to curl up into a ball, still clutching the pistol. I also bit my lip to the point of drawing blood, as to not cry out from the pain and doom myself.

Hearing the beasts who pursued me in the distance, suddenly sounding slightly irritated and lost, I decided to simply lay there in the snow, hoping none found me.

I lay there for about four minutes before I heard the sound of the poor human steed’s hands crunching around nearby.

What I heard first, however, was the panting sound of the rider. He sounded smug, speaking in a similar mangled version of English that the bird had spoken.

“Found your!” The thing smacked the man it rode on the head, urging him forward. “Is dead already? Or maybe…is pretend?” 

The thing chuckled horribly and leaned down to the steed, talking to it in a patronising, childish tone. “What your think? Is pretend? Hm?”

Wordlessly, while still gritting my teeth with desperation, I rolled over onto my back, my gun out at the ready.

The ram, who barely even had time to sit back up to take a good look at me, caught the bullet directly in his head. Giving out one last, short and surprised *‘maahhh’* it gracelessly flopped off of the human’s back.

The gunshot rang out like a gong in the empty forest, and I could hear cries of panic, and thankfully, retreat from the other two.

The man who the goat had been riding, terrified by the gunshot, reared up, snarling at me, and began to prance around, on its legs but standing with an inhumanely bent posture.

“Chill out!” I said in a harsh whisper, pointing the gun at it. “You’re free!”

The man looked at me with frenzied eyes as I spoke, frothing at the mouth. Up close he looked like a fucking caveman, clearly hadn’t washed, shaved or eaten properly in ages. He had shaggy hair hanging from his armpits and crotch, his hairy skin stretched tightly over his jagged bones, all of which were perfectly visible from outside.

The man snarled at me, his mouth frothing with frenzied eyes like that of a feral junkie. He then turned around, bounding on all fours once more, and disappeared into the darkness of the woods.

I began to cry from the shock. *What the fuck was this? Why the hell did I leave my car?*

After a few more moments of weeping I decided to take a look at the thing I’d killed.

The fact I landed that good of a hit on it was incredible, I hadn’t shot a gun since five years prior when I went to a range with my dad. The animal had taken the bullet directly in the left eye, and it had probably gone all the way into the brain. 

I noticed that the thing’s cloven front feet had mutated somehow, one part of the hoof elongating and splitting into several small, toothlike claws that looked like fingers, with one large one that served as the thumb.

However, apart from being able to stand upright, the dead animal looked like any normal bighorn sheep.

Stumbling away from it, I tried to decide what to do, head still spinning from the encounter. I was certain that those other riders wouldn’t stay away for too long.

However, before I could think more, I was interrupted, once again hearing the calls of birds.

Looking up, I saw what must have been at least twenty birds, all sitting on the branches of the trees.

They were of various kinds, however the one which caught my eye was the huge eagle that seemed to be in the centre, the leader of the ambush. His largeness and the wickedness of his talons seemed to command a form of majesty and intimidation.

Before I could even turn to run, they descended on me, shrieking and clacking their beaks, an orchestra of winged terror.

First, a small robin smashed into my head, tearing into my neck and pecking my ear savagely. As I stumbled to the ground, crying in pain, more birds came for me, ripping me apart with their claws and reducing my clothes to tatters, exposing my skin to the cold.

After a few seconds of enduring this pain, I felt myself slip into unconsciousness.

When I woke up, I was being pulled across the gravel of the road by my feet.

I was still bleeding from what felt like hundreds of claw and beak marks all over my skin and I was half naked, most of what remained of my clothes hanging from me like skin in the process of being shed.

It was still bitterly cold, and I still appeared to be in the woods

The moon in the black, misty sky shined down on me, almost too bright for my bloodshot eyes, which had also been damaged by the assault.

I painfully craned my head up to see two more of the bipedal animals dragging me.

Both were deer, like the beasts which had pursued me before, however they were now both standing on their hind legs, walking with a jittery, jolting gait, like their knees had been damaged.

One of them turned around and saw me, its typically expressionless face curling into something that somehow resembled malice as it noticed I was awake.

It grunted something to its companion that was either in some language they shared, or too quiet for me to hear in my disorientated state.

Both dropped my feet, turning to me with sneers beneath their snouts.

“Your walk yourself. Walk to Orwell.” One of them grunted.

I hastily did as it asked, noticing that with one of its strange hands the deer who had spoken was holding my pistol. Stumbling to my feet and shivering with fear, I looked at them for further instruction.

As soon as I was standing, the other deer’s thin leg flashed out, its heavy hooves catching me right between the legs.

The thing howled in amusement as I fell back onto my knees, gasping with pain.

After they’d roughly hoisted me back to my feet, I was commanded to walk with them, and so continued down the road between them, still hunched from the pain in my dick.

I thought several times of making a break from them, maybe running back into the woods, but then I thought of how the small army of birds had ripped into me.

All the while, the deer who kicked me stole many glances at me. The looks it gave me were horribly amused, as if it was looking forwards to doing something to me. Somehow, this made it seem both monstrous and humanoid at the same time.

I have no clue how long the journey was, but to me it felt like the longest walk of my life.
