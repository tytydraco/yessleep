A few days ago I decided to go on a hike on a small trail by my house. I had just bought a new Polaroid camera and wanted to test it out by getting some nice pictures of nature. Truth be told I had bought the camera with the intention of capturing all the fun things me and my friends did over the summer. Only there weren’t many memories to capture or that many friends to see. I spent most of my summer on solitary hikes, bike rides, and anything else I could think of to get myself outside. So if I’m not going to collect pictures of my friends and I, I am at least going to get some pictures of the hikes that I had been taking. I drove to the trail that was about 15 minutes from my house. I had the day off and it was a beautiful afternoon with the sun shining and perfect weather. I wasn’t planning on being out very long so all I had brought with me was the camera and my water bottle.



When I got to the parking lot of the nature trail, I noticed that I was the only car there. Nothing too out of the ordinary, but I would have expected at least a couple other cars to be there with the weather being so nice and it being 1 in the afternoon on a Sunday. Not that I was complaining though, I was looking forward to not having any awkward interactions with people also enjoying the trail. As I started walking along I took a few pictures of some trees and flowers that I noticed along the way. I was surprised at how nice the pictures looked. I don’t know exactly what I was expecting but found myself surprised at the clarity and detail I could see in the pictures. I was enjoying my hike and getting lost in my thoughts as I walked along. I had been to this trail multiple times this summer and was starting to get the feeling of familiarity in the woods. Ever since I was a kid I loved to get to know new places in the wilderness. It’s amazing how when you look at any piece of wooded area, it all looks the same. The branches, the brush, the leaves, they all blend into each other. Once you walk a certain area enough though, you start to notice the distinguishing features. The tree with a knot protruding out, or a limb that splits off at just the right angle to sear into your memory. I’ve always felt that when I can reach that point in specific area of wilderness that I am somehow connected with it. That it stays with me.



This specific trail was starting to feel that way to me and I was happy that I would have physical pictures to help tie me to it. I was coming up on a bend in the path when I first noticed one of my favorite distinguishing features. As the trail curved to the right, there was a tree with a large protruding knot on the left side of it. I raised my camera, paused for a second, took a picture of the tree, and continued down the trail. I kept walking as I waited for the picture to develop. As much as I wanted to, I had read on a review of this camera that shaking Polaroid pictures are actually bad for them despite what the Outkast song from my childhood had told me. I had walked a fair distance, at least 5 minutes, when I figured that enough time had passed for the picture to have developed. At first the picture seemed fine. In fact I was surprised it wasn’t blurry, as I was afraid that I hadn’t stopped moving long enough when I took the picture. I noticed something though as I stared at it. There were two knots on the tree. One on the left, like there had always been, but there was also one on the right this time. I stopped walking and pulled the picture closer to my face. That wasn’t a knot on the right side of the tree. It was someone's head. It was a face. And it was staring directly at me and my camera.



In an instant I could feel the silence of the wilderness. It felt like the trees were pushing in on me. There weren’t any other cars. Had someone gotten here after me and somehow gotten ahead of me? There’s no way I thought, I would have heard them. The face in the picture was that of a man. I couldn’t tell how old they were but I could see an unkempt beard and long hair. More than anything I could see they were smiling. I started to scan the environment around me at a blistering pace. Were they following me? Had they been following me this whole time? I decided that I wasn’t going to stick around to find out. The trail that I was on formed a big loop and I had already passed the halfway point. Not only that, but I had no intention of going back the way I came and running into whoever was in that picture. Why were they hiding behind that tree and why hadn’t they said anything? If they were following me I didn’t want them to know that I had seen them so I decided to just keep walking the way I was going, if not a little faster now. My senses were all on red alert, I felt like I could hear and smell everything in the woods. Every stick that broke, branch that groaned in the wind, it would send a panic all over my body. After about 5 minutes of this I couldn’t shake it. There were sticks breaking behind me. Not randomly either. Someone was definitely following me.



I turned to see and all I could see was the camouflage of the wilderness. Whatever sense of familiarity that I thought I was gaining about these woods was now completely gone. It all blended together again and looked like somewhere I had never been. One thing immediately jumped out to me though, I saw him. He was crouched down in some brush, but he was there, looking at me. SMILING at me. I’ve never seen a smile like that. His teeth were yellow and rotted out and it looked like something was hanging out of his mouth. There was. There was some kind of animals tail sticking out of those cracked and smiling lips. I could see now that blood was dripping from his beard. My mind registered these things and I turned as fast as I could into a full on sprinting stride. As I took that first giant step my right shoulder hit a tree that I was standing next to. The camera was in my right hand and fell to the ground. I don’t remember if I even registered that it had happened as all I could think about was running and not falling. The run back to my car was a blur. I almost lost my footing a few times but was able to stay upright and made it back.



In my head I could hear him the whole way, inches behind me. That smile still on his face. I don’t know if that’s what really happened or if my mind created that in its fight or flight response to get me to run faster. But I swear I could smell him. It smelled like death was following me. I drove faster than I should have to get home and collapsed on my bed when I got there. After a couple hours I realized that I didn’t have my camera on me anymore. I did still have the pictures that I took though. I had been putting them in my back pocket as I went along. I pulled them out to look them over. The picture on top was of the tree. Of the man. Of that smile. I threw it across the room before I could get a good look at it again. I don’t know if I ever want to look at that picture again. The next picture was a close up of a flower that I had seen. Again, it turned out great. Man I’m going to miss that camera.



The next picture was a straight on picture of the trail. As I looked close I saw him. Along the East side of the trail. He was standing next to a tree and this time I could see his whole body. He had on a dark trench coat with black military boots underneath. He had something in his hand. I could see the tail and then made out the rest. It was a mouse. Well not a whole mouse. The top half of the mouse was missing and I could see the blood pouring down. I also saw the blood on those dry cracked lips. Was that the same mouse from the first picture I saw him in? I didn’t see anything in the next two pictures. The last picture was a selfie of me sitting in my car before I started the hike. I hadn’t looked at this one after I took it, but now I wished that I had. Behind me in the picture standing at the backside of my car was the man. Only he wasn’t smiling this time. This time he had the head of the mouse in his mouth and it looked like he was biting down. His eyes. I’ve never seen such hatred and anger in someone's eyes before.



I decided to burn the pictures. I didn’t want them, or him, around me. I didn’t want to become familiar with that spot after all. I went out to my backyard to put the pictures in my fire pit. As I got to it and looked down, I saw there was already a picture sitting on top of the fire wood that was stacked in there. It was face down so I picked it up and turned it over. Hanging in front of the camera and in focus was a mouse. It was obviously dead as one of it’s eyes were bulging out and blood was dripping from it’s mouth. Behind the mouse and out of focus was a house. My house. I could swear I could hear sticks breaking and could catch the faintest scent of death on the air as I burned all the pictures.
