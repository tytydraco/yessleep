I’ve felt the sensation for weeks now. I’ve been tugging at my skin for days, but I just can’t reach it. I swear I can feel everything now. The villi in my intestines push like tingly hands, and I feel them caressing me from inside. I feel my organs pumping and moving with the blood in my body, all working together as a wet, sticky system. I feel the itch on the edge of my stomach, right between my ribs and the meat, and I tug at my skin again. I feel everything. But mostly, I feel the itch. I think it started with the man who gave me the coins. 

I grew up in the kind of poverty that stunts your growth, rips you of every opportunity. I was born into a constant struggle. Finding food every night was a war. I can’t say I was surprised when my father finally passed, and my home was taken back when I couldn’t afford the bills alone. 
People have always avoided eye contact with me. I’ve been berated on the streets more times than I can count. When you’re homeless, people try their best to avoid you. I make them uncomfortable. I make them angry. Some people pity me, but a lot of them just feel disgusted by me.

Weeks ago, a group of young men approached me in the park, where I had managed to set up a small shelter. They slashed my tent to pieces. They were laughing, telling me I was no good. One of them pointed his knife at me and said “You’re just like the roaches who run in the streets”. Then they left as quickly as they came. But I don’t remember much about that experience. Because as soon as the men left, another one came to me. I remember this one very, very well.
The new man was no more than skin and bone. I first assumed he was homeless too. His clothes were clean and new, but they clearly revealed all the places his skin had been rubbed raw. I was immediately uneasy when he approached, but I thought it was because of the men who attacked me. I was wrong.

The thin man looked at me pitifully. “People drive the homeless away like dogs,” he murmured. “This culture is deeply rotten.” 

I only nodded. I was still feeling the devastation of my shelter destroyed. 

“You get to thinkin’ you’ve got bugs in your brain, and that’s why you’re like this.”

I frowned at that. At the time I didn’t understand him. But I think I do now. I think even then, there was a part of me who knew what he meant.
The thin man stepped closer to me, and I saw his raw skin was much worse than I realized. There were deep red holes where the flesh had been torn away. Scabbed over, and torn away again. I thought I could see his veins underneath it all, moving peculiarly. I watched his wounds for minutes, and they never once stopped twitching. 

The man leaned forward, inches from my face. His breath was so pungent I almost gagged. It smelled strangely of bleach. 
“Please take this,” he whispered. He held his skinny fingers, and dropped several coins into my palms. 

He immediately left the park. His steps were wobbling and pitiful, and something about his movements made me shudder. I looked back the coins he gave me, but quickly realized it wasn’t normal money like I had thought. Each small brass piece was engraved with the picture of a lotus, floating upside down like a ghost in the water. I narrowed my eyes and examined every coin closely. They had no dates, no motto, no mint mark. No nation. Only the upside down lotus. It was as if they had been born right from the skinny man’s palms. As if the metal had been forged from his raw wounds. 
I don’t know why I kept them. The coins were utterly worthless. Maybe I saw them as a gift, as a sort of kindness he was trying to do for me. I didn’t focus on it at the time. I was too worried about where I would sleep. 

I was lucky enough to find a homeless shelter with an open bed. Everyone was crowded into a large room, every sheet a matching blue. We all slept together in a sea of discomfort. I always had troubled sleep in places like these. It made me paranoid to rest next to strangers. I knew they were struggling just like I was, but I had seen the worst of humanity. I grew up in the meanest places imaginable.
I brushed these ideas away and shut my eyes. And that’s when it started.

The itching was bearable at first. I thought it was the bed sheets, or something in the air. But no amount of scratching would relieve the feeling. It was as if tiny legs wiggled all over me. I sat up in bed and rifled through the blankets, searching for bugs. I looked to figures laying beside me and whispered “Do you feel that too?” No one said a word. 

That’s when another figure emerged in the dark room. I thought someone had heard me, and come to check on me. But the figure came towards my bed and I knew it was nothing good. I almost mistook it for the skinny man. But it came closer and I saw it wasn’t a person at all.

It didn’t touch the ground. It moved constantly, like the man’s open wounds, but it wouldn’t touch anything. Its body was long and fowl, and its skin was tight over its shape like it didn’t belong. There were stretches of skin in its head, some bigger than others, that almost gave the impression of facial features. But it didn’t have a face. It didn’t have an identity. It was just filth. 

It really didn’t look like a bug. It was nothing like a bug, but that’s the closest thing I could compare it to. 

I was still scratching the itch while I stared at it. I drug my fingernails all over my body, even when it started to hurt. I just wanted it to stop. I wanted to feel clean again, but I only felt vile. I watched the bug-thing and I swear it was watching me too. 




I don’t think I slept at all. When the sun started to rise, my whole body was raw. Someone next to me woke up and asked me what happened. I didn’t answer. But I took out the coins and showed them to her.
“I’ve never seen money like that,” she told me. “But I’ve heard the lotus is a symbol of purity.”

“But it’s upside down,” I said.

The woman stayed quiet for a second and shrugged. “I don’t know. Maybe it means the opposite then. Like sickness.”

“Or infestation.”




We didn’t talk again after that. I left the shelter quickly. I went back to the park I had been before, and I buried the coins in the soil. I found my way to what was left of my tent, and tried to salvage it. I thought of the men who did this, and cursed them. Then I thought of the thin man, and I cursed him too. I wanted to feel clean again.

“This is what they do to the bugs,” I told myself. My home was destroyed. I was chastised, I was hated. No one wanted to see me, they didn’t  want to know I was there. They let people like me die in the streets, and be chased out. 
“This is the same thing they do to the bugs.”

Maybe this thing was after me because we were the same, in a sense. Unwanted.

When I slept that night in the ruins of my tent, the figure came back, and it brought the itch. 
I scratched and scratched but it was as if my skin wasn’t connected to the rest of my body. The itch was so deep inside me, I couldn’t reach it. I felt it in my muscles, in the sinuses in my skull. I felt it in parts of my body I had never been conscious of before. I felt it in my brain, and I gagged. The figure hovered in the air, touching nothing. Its body never stopped moving. I was so tired my eyes stung. I looked at my own wounds and saw how they moved the same. 



I’ve thought about it a lot since then. Of sickness, of contagion. I am disgusting now. That’s why the thin man smelled like bleach. When the chemicals react with organic matter, they breakdown the proteins and cells. I just need something to break down the sickness. Anything to be clean again.

I raise a white bottle to my lips now, and it burns all the way down my throat. The burn spreads to the rest of my body, and I feel the lining of my throat peel off in layers. But underneath the burn, I can still feel the itch.
