I am a wildlife photographer, and once I found myself deep within a dense forest, seeking the perfect shot of untamed creatures. After a long day of capturing the essence of the wild, I returned to the comfort of a quaint cottage. As I settled in, enjoying a moment of tranquility, a mesmerizing violin melody floated through the air, captivating my senses. Intrigued, I embarked on an investigation to uncover the source of this enchanting tune.

Following the ethereal music, my search led me to a hidden trapdoor concealed within the cottage floor. Opening it revealed a vast and mysterious basement, comprising several locked rooms. Among them, a single room stood broken and neglected.

 Curiosity compelled me to venture inside, where I discovered a violin box covered in a thick layer of dust. Gingerly lifting the box, I cleaned off the grime, revealing a beautiful wooden violin nestled within. To my surprise, I also found a note written in vivid red ink, bearing a foreboding message: "Whoever plays this violin shall meet their demise." 

Puzzled, I wondered if it was some sort of macabre joke. How could playing a violin lead to death?
Just as I pondered this enigma, my two friends, who happened to be picnicking in the same forest, contacted me. They informed me of the darkness enveloping the area and the absence of hotel accommodations. 

Upon learning that I was staying in a small cottage nearby, they requested if they could spend the night, as there were no other options available. Though the prospect of sharing the cottage with a newly married couple amidst the secluded woods felt peculiar, I reluctantly agreed, realizing they had no alternative.

After a brief wait, my friends arrived at the cottage, parking their car and joining me inside. I extended a warm welcome, and we sat down to enjoy a meal together. During dinner, their curiosity piqued, and they inquired about how I had stumbled upon the beautiful cottage. I chuckled and confessed that it was not as idyllic as they imagined.

 I proceeded to share the unnerving discovery of the basement, with its various locked rooms, and the peculiar find of the crushed violin within. The intriguing aspect was the belief that anyone who had played it before had met an untimely demise.


To my surprise, my friends burst into laughter, dismissing my tale as an attempt to frighten them. Undeterred, they challenged me, claiming that I couldn't scare them so easily. A bet ensued, and my friend's wife, skilled in playing musical instruments, proposed that we play the violin in the middle of the night, performing the specific tune mentioned in the note I had found—although I apologize for neglecting to mention the violin's existence earlier.


Against our better judgment, we descended into the dimly lit basement. Taking hold of the violin, my friend's wife gracefully began to play the haunting melody described in the note. In that moment, a shift in the atmosphere was palpable—the air turned chillingly cold, and ominous cracking sounds emanated from the surrounding woods. Despite our trepidation, we persisted, disregarding the warning signs and continuing to play.


Suddenly, one of the locked doors in the basement swung open, unleashing a malevolent spirit into our midst. As the night wore on, each door in the basement began to open, one by one, liberating vengeful spirits into the world. Plunged into a nightmarish ordeal, we found ourselves pursued by these wicked entities, their wrath relentless and unforgiving.

Desperately attempting to escape, we rushed towards our car, only to discover that the engine refused to start, leaving us stranded in the clutches of the malevolent spirits. Hunted down one by.
