I received a letter in 1989  from an uncle I had never met. What transpired almost cost me my life. This is a simplified retelling of the events.



Until then, I had never met any of my family besides my parents. Whenever I asked my father about them, he would evade my questions and say that they’re gone. 



You can understand my surprise when a letter came from a person who introduced himself as my uncle, offering his condolences after my father’s passing.



This time was especially hard for me. My mother passed when I was just a small child, so my father was the only family I had. His long battle with cancer took a toll on my mental health. I was still in college, so the stress of money and how I would take care of myself gnawed at my mind.



We moved around a lot with my father, so I never managed to make real connections with people. There wasn’t really anyone I could ask for help.



That’s why my uncle's letter was like a glimmer of sun during a heavy rainstorm.



My uncle outlined in that letter that he’s devastated by the death of his brother and the knowledge that his nephew has no one to fend for him. He proposed a visit to his village the summer after my classes. We would discuss how he could aid me financially until I finished my studies. He urged me to come before June 21st for the summer solstice.



I had signed a work contract that obliged me to stay in my college town until June 19th.



In a reply, my uncle said that it would not be an issue, but to get on the road as soon as possible. There was a strange urgency in his second letter, and he seldom spoke of anything else, but I didn’t give it much thought.



I couldn’t find the village on my map; luckily, my uncle sent the precise directions to it.



I managed to arrive at the village on the night of June 19th. The way there was strange. After getting off the highway, I had to crisscross through narrow country roads until it eventually turned to a full dirt path through the woods for the last 20 miles. 



What surprised me even more was how scarcely populated the area was. My country is very densely populated, and you seldom go more than 20 miles without seeing a village, but since I exited the highway, there were just fields and forests for more than 70 miles.



My uncle's house was at the end of the village. Some people were standing outside their homes or looking out their windows, waving to my car. I knew people here were friendlier than in the city, but I wouldn’t expect them to be out at 1 a.m., greeting a stranger.



My uncle stood outside his house flashing my car down. He greeted me with a big hug. Tears were already in his eyes. I started crying too. He let me in and put a teapot on the stove.



“The last time I saw you, Danny, you were about this big.”



He showed about 25 inches.



“But now you’re a big man. You’re larger than I am.” He laughed. “And you look so much like your father. I tried to reach out to him to get him some help, but he wouldn’t listen. I’m sure it must have been so hard for you.”



“Yeah, it was.”



“Poor man, but I don’t want to bring up any past trauma now. We’ll talk about it later. Tell me how your school is?”



We then continued to talk mostly about my life. My uncle was very interested and kept asking me questions. I can’t remember the last time I talked this much. It was good to have someone listen to me again, as Dad used to.



After a while, my uncle said that I was probably tired and he didn’t want to exhaust me even more.



“Before I go to sleep, I also need to ask you, Uncle Ron. Why did my dad never speak of you or this town? You said that our family has lived here for hundreds of years. Why would my dad leave?”



“Eh, Danny, this is a complicated story. Your father married a woman, your mother, who was not from this town and was very Christian. I could immediately see something was wrong with her. Your father slowly withdrew from the community until a few days after your birth; they left in the dead of the night.”



“I hoped you and your father would return once she died. But let’s not talk about that too much. You’re here, Danny! Please go rest up before tomorrow, we have two eventful days in front of us.”



He ran his hand through my hair and let me go to my room.



I was torn as I left the table. My dad always painted my mom as a beautiful person, but why would he leave his brother and community behind and never come back?



Before I went to sleep, I looked around the room. Strange paintings of a big dark creature inside a forest were on the wall. This area of the country was well known for its folklore, but I couldn’t remember any old legends I had heard about anything that looked similar to it.



The next morning, I woke up late, around noon. There was a loud noise coming from the street. Women were dressed in beautiful, flowery dresses while men wore black and white shepherd costumes with large canes and black hats decorated with long bird feathers. They were parading through the streets singing songs in a language I didn’t understand.



My uncle left a note on the table saying to meet him in the village hall. There was the same shepherd's costume sitting on a chair in exactly my size. 



On the street, everyone greeted me with joy and happiness in their faces. 



In the village hall, I was greeted by the town's mayor. He let me sit in an honorary seat at the head of the table. 



Homemade plum liquor was passed around. I didn’t drink often and tried to refuse the offer at first, but they kept being so persistent that I caved in. 



There were paintings of the same creature my uncle had at his house.



The villagers called him Belzír. It was an old folk creature that came out of the forest every twenty years to feast on a chosen one from the village. They said it would bring them a good harvest and fertility.



In my drunkenness, I began laughing at it, but they all seemed serious.



Then a few villagers walked to the stage and began playing music. The people started dancing. The flowery dresses spun around like a Ferris wheel while the men tapped their canes to the rhythm.



I tried to get up and join them, but as I stood up, my head started spinning, and my world went blank.



I woke up gasping.



The morning dew felt cold on my feet.



I tried to move, but my hands were tied to something.



Splinters dug into my hands as I moved around more.



I tried to open my eyes, but there was only darkness.



Then faint footsteps came closer.



Someone started taking off the rag over my head.



It was my uncle standing in front of me.



I looked around frantically.



I stood naked in a field, tied to an effigy of the creature from the paintings.



Around me were two wooden terraces with all the people from the village staring down at me.



The mayor stood on a wooden podium on the left terrace.



“Ro..Ron..what is going on?”



I screamed out.



“Shhh, boy, silent, let the mayor speak. You’ll soon understand.”



“Oh dear Belzír, we bring to you now Ron’s nephew to ensure the fertility of our women and land for the next twenty years. Please accept these gifts from your humble and loving servants.”



The crowd roared as my uncle waved and bowed to the masses.



My heart sank.



“Let us sing now.”



The crowd started singing another tune, this time sounding more ominous. Their throats were calling out in unison.



The forest went silent, and the birds stopped singing.



The noise was so terrifying that I wanted to pluck my ears, but my hands were still tied.



I tried to loosen the knot slowly, but it was tighter than I thought at first.



The trees then began moving.



The ground echoed with loud stumps.



A roar sounded from the trees.



My ears began ringing upon hearing it.



The air was filled with a smell of rotten fruit.



The people began lighting fires.



Loud drumming echoed from the stands.



I tried digging harder into the knot.



Then the trees parted closer and closer until the last one gave in.



Before me now stood a creature more than 12 feet tall. Its skin was bare and dark. Its red eyes stared right into mine. It let out a huge roar and made its way towards me.



The air now turned hot.



My whole body was in panic.



The creature was getting closer.



I started jerking myself around.



Then my body hit the effigy hard. 



It slowly fell and shattered on the ground.



The whole crowd gasped in surprise.



Belzír stopped dead in its tracks.



My hands were free now.



“What did you do, Danny?!” My uncle screamed.



“He broke the ritual!” The mayor yelled out.



Belzír roared, hit the ground, and started charging the wooden structures. People fell to the ground, piling on top of each other.



All I heard were the screams and cries of terror as I ran away.



I ran for as long as my legs let me, stopping and hiding every 10 minutes.



My head was still spinning from the drink.



After hours, my legs gave in, and I stopped at a forest opening far away from the town.



There were cuts all over my feet. My legs burned so hard I could barely stand up.



The days became a blur. I can’t remember what I ate or drank, or if I even did at all.



A group of lumberjacks found me two days later. I first tried to fight them, believing they were from the village, but they managed to calm me down.



I reported my experience to the police, but they were unable to locate the village. It wasn’t on any maps, not historical or current.



They wanted to close the case as drug-induced psychosis, but after multiple calls, I managed to persuade the local police chief to send a patrol to the location my uncle gave me.



I rode with them that day. The roads were as I remembered, but when we arrived at the place where the village used to be, there was just an empty meadow.



Nothing, no buildings, no village hall, no bones, just the meadow.



I broke down on the ground, crying. The police had to take me to a hospital.



I tried to persuade the police chief to continue the case, but he had had enough and stopped answering my calls.



Years later, I’m still haunted by images of the town and Belzír. I never finished college and moved away to a different place.



This morning, I opened my mailbox, and inside was a letter with my uncle’s handwriting on it. It was a postcard with the image of Belzír from his room on it. It was dated on the 21st of June, 1989.
