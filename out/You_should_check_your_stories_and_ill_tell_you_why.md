Hi.  
I'm Luna.  
I'm from a comic book reality.  
  
I'm posting here to warn you about something.  
  
When you write a story, you have to be careful whether your story is badly written or not, otherwise what we call the "Black Sea" will destroy that reality with its contents and there will be nothing left but dead versions of the writings you see.  
  
You don't want to kill the living, do you?  
...  
I think I need to explain everything.  
  
Here's the thing: Books, pictures, comics, digital devices, dreams, digital games,... In short, what everyone considers to be fiction and non real are actually infinite hierarchies of reality that go downward into a less real realm we call "Pata Reality" and can exist within each other.  
  
Let me explain why I say infinite hierarchies of reality: These book realities that you see as fiction see another book reality as fiction. Then that book reality sees another book reality as fiction, and this goes on forever.  
And this also applies to realities outside books.  
  
As for this "Black Sea" thing...  
  
This thing comes into realities with badly written stories and destroys them until what is left is what you see.  
  
I have encountered it many times and I can tell you that I doubt whether this thing has a mind.  
  
This thing is a natural disaster.  
You can see it coming with technology, but you can't do anything to prevent it except fix the story.  
  
If the story doesn't get fixed until the time comes to that reality... That's the end of it.  
  
Let me tell you my story.  
So maybe you can understand it better.  
  
I come from the top 40th floor of a comic book hierarchy.  
  
My comic book was a superhero story.  
  
The comic book was mostly about a guy called Hero Boy.  
  
He had gotten things like flight, super speed, super strength, laser eyes from a lab accident.  
  
At first he used them for money, but after the death of his sister he started to use them for good.  
  
As the comic progressed, he became more and more mature.  
  
He even got married.  
  
And he was helped by the Organization of Heroes, which I was a part of.  
  
I was working... every job at that place.  
  
This is where things started to get complicated.  
  
Sometime after the marriage, Hero Boy defeated a Lovecraftian Monster that was beyond the concept of Dimensionality without any weapons, even though the most powerful thing he could do was lift New York.  
  
Still, it was okay because he learned from that incident and matured.  
  
This coincided with our organization's discovery that comic books are a reality and our reality is a comic book that exists in a hierarchy as a 40th floor.  
  
Then we decided to go beyond and below our reality and develop our technology.  
  
While we were developing our technology, other things happened.  
  
Hero Boy started getting beaten up by normal people for beating up the Lovecraftian Beast.  
  
Meanwhile, a black mass swallowed the neighboring galaxy.  
  
While we were dealing with that Black mass, we were also dealing with the transition to the lower realities.  
  
As the first experiment, I put on the astronaut suit, which was a transitional suit, because we could be directly in space, and I went into the sub-reality.  
  
This comic was like your modern Spiderman comics.  
It's pretty bad, basically.  
  
The first thing I saw was an endless void on the floor with the pages of the comic I had entered.  
  
I honestly call it "The Comic Book Void".   
  
Apparently this was another place between the comic book and the reality above it.  
  
There I went from a page to a moment where there was a fight.  
...  
But what I saw was not a fight.  
  
What I saw was a sea that was completely black.  
  
There were melted skeletons and other remains of people in it.  
  
The moment I saw this thing I was really, really uncomfortable.  
  
After I took a picture of this thing, I immediately went back to my reality.  
  
While I was there explaining what I had seen and showing the photo, our alien allies brought a photo from that swallowed galaxy, which was identical to mine.  
  
We called it the Black Sea because it looks like a black sea.  
  
And that day we started to work on this new threat while working on the transitions.  
  
While we were doing that, other things happened.  
  
Hero Boy revealed his secret identity.  
  
And one of the bad guys shot his mom.  
  
In order to save his mother, he made a deal with a demon petitioner to save his mother in exchange for her marriage.  
  
After this event, the Black Sea slowly began to grow.  
  
Our allies investigated it but all that was found were skeletons.  
  
While all this was going on, the new issue of the comic book I had been to before came out. So we decided to do the same thing in this issue and see if it gave different results.  
  
I went into one of the random pages from the blank space of that issue with taking a video.  
  
This time there were some buildings around the Black Sea and a tall, handsome man in the middle of the sea.  
This person was the character who broke the 4 walls of the comic book.  
  
I approached him and called out to him.  
"Hello."  
  
When he turned to me, I was very scared.  
Because he had no eyes, and something black was coming out of his mouth and he started to rot.  
And he was very unhappy.  
  
He spoke to me.  
"Are you a reader?"  
  
I said, "I don't read this much, but I'm from the same place as the readers."  
  
His body and the buildings next to him started to melt.  
He said, "Please save us."  
And eventually the buildings melted and there was nothing left of him but bones.  
  
I went back to the base with the video I took at that moment and the fear.  
  
After I showed the video, we had a meeting.  
We had a meeting and we decided that this thing came to my bad writing based on the fact that this thing came after that comic and our comic went bad.  
So we decided to speed up the transition to higher reality.  
  
Of course, while we were doing these things, the bad writing started happening more and more.  
  
This time Hero Boy got beaten up by everyone, including his ex-wife. Then, even though he learned a lesson from a previous incident, he forgot that lesson and made the same mistake again.  
  
This time, the Black Sea take everything expect the solar system.  
  
Everyone was panicking.  
  
The only thing left to do now was to go to the reality above us and warn the people there.  
  
At least we finished the technology to cross over to the higher reality.  
  
Now we could go there.  
  
I was up for the job and I put on the suit with the necessary tools.  
  
Meanwhile, outside the building, everything was melting and being covered by the Black Sea.  
  
The Black Sea had arrived.  
  
As I was getting ready, Hero Boy came in.  
  
He was of normal height and handsome.  
  
But his face... his face was the same as that character.  
  
This time I was surrounded by the Black Sea, the walls and people around me started to melt and only skeletons were left.  
  
Me and Hero Boy were getting scared.  
  
Hero Boy turned to me.  
"Please... please save everyone."  
And then he melted too.  
  
And just as I was about to melt, I used the suit and went into the space beyond my reality.  
  
From there I went beyond again, to the 39th floor.  
  
When I looked around, I was in a closed bookcase.  
  
It was dark. So I turned on the flashlight.  
  
And when I looked behind me, there was a comic book with every issue of Hero Boy ever made, at least 1000 pages.  
  
That was my world... and it was gone.  
  
On the other bookshelves were copies of the same book.  
...  
I had to save new ones...  
  
...  
So... that was part of my story.  
I think that's enough for today.  
  
I have a lot more to tell   
but maybe I'll tell you about that another time.  
  
Take care of yourselves.
