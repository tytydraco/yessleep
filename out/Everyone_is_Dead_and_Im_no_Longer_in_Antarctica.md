As I write this, it is currently 2226 hrs. on April the 3rd of 2025. For now, my name is Rich. I cannot say much about who I work for other than that I was U.S related personnel who had been assigned to a remote research station deep within the East Antarctic Plateau, in the vicinity of Vostok and Concordia Station.

I’m leaving this memo in case… Something were to happen—

—

In Antarctica, nothing drifts off course by accident — not the wind, not the snow, and certainly not the dead. We operated Vireo Station under strict compartmentalization protocols. No satellite uplinks. No GPS beacons. Not even a formal designation in the Antarctic Treaty registry. It was a black-site research outpost, established well outside the operational boundaries of known facilities — far southeast of Vostok Station. The fewer people who knew we existed, the better. That included the ones delivering our lifeline.

Our resupply was orchestrated with clinical precision to maintain plausible deniability. We were provided with a sustainment palette via airdrop every three months. The Globemaster pilots flying out of Christchurch were given one simple instruction: “Drop at coordinates XX°S, XX°E.” A dead zone. A patch of polar plateau that, to nearly anyone looking at it on paper, meant nothing. The crews didn’t know who or what they were supplying — just that they were to fly a designated corridor under EmCon and drop a sealed pallet from altitude at a timestamp synchronized with satellite overpass windows. The idea was simple: even if someone intercepted the flight data, saw them on radar or observed via eyesight, they still wouldn’t be able to trace it back to us.

My role here was equally stripped-down. I knew nothing of what my other colleagues' business was- Just the basics… We were there to do “science things.” I was the field systems tech — electrician, diesel mechanic, infrastructure maintenance, comms specialist, everything short of med and bio. Titles like “Systems Specialist” sounded tidy on paper, but in the field, it meant I was the one crawling through snow drifts with a multimeter in my teeth and a wrench in my glove. When the drop window opened, I was to drive exactly 25 statute miles due true north — 0° by fluxgate compass — from the station’s hidden position. GPS devices were explicitly restricted. We had several GD300s locked in the comms rack in a faraday cage, encrypted and off-network, but they stayed off unless under direct instruction or in case of an extreme life-threatening emergency. No tracking. No transmissions. No exceptions.

The BV206 — a dual-cab, articulated tracked carrier designed for deep snow traversal — was our workhorse. The Norwegian Hägglunds had been retrofitted with a reinforced fuel bladder, insulated cab seals, and a military-grade Arctic preheater. It handled well over uneven snowpack and sastrugi, and its low ground pressure let it float over most drifts. Navigation was done the old-fashioned way: map grid, magnetic bearing, fluxgate repeater, and a wristwatch. I left mid-morning. Weather forecasts were clean — a minor low-pressure system over Dome C, nothing unusual. Visibility was sharp, atmospheric clarity near 100 kilometers. I confirmed my bearing at 000°T and engaged low gear. The BV rumbled across the ice shelf at a modest 25 km/h, stabilized by the vehicle’s independent torsion bar suspension. It was a straight vector — No deviations, no landmarks. Just the axial drift of the wind and the view of my only safehaven fading behind me.

The journey was expected to take three hours round trip at most. Retrieve the crate. Return. Eat reconstituted stew. No variables.

I’d made it, the bright orange chute desperately tried to escape the load in the heavy wind. After unsecuring all six crates from the roll-off pallet, I hauled them into the rear cabin of the BV, my fingers aching at their weight through my thick mittens.

On return at around kilometer 45, the barometric pressure began to drop faster than forecast. A warm-core polar cyclone was forming from the east, surging along a jetstream wobble out of Queen Maud Land. The visibility collapsed from 30 km to 300 meters in under 30 minutes. Whiteout.

Whiteout isn’t poetic. It’s literal. No ground. No sky. Just a luminous, depthless void. My visibility was reduced to the arc of the BV’s forward halogens — twin cones stabbing into milk. The compass showed 180°T — my return vector. I stayed glued to it like a lifeline. I was blind and at the mercy of chance I’d stay directly on course. No margin for drift. Luckily, there wasn’t much to crash into out here — Just a couple spots we’d plotted previously on the map to avoid crevasses as well as possible hidden bergschrunds and randklufts.

The BV groaned against crosswinds, and I kept one hand on the fluxgate repeater, correcting heading in ten-degree bursts as the wind shear pushed me west. All I could do was trust the odometer, correct for any skid slippage, and pray to every mechanical god that the calibration held.

By the time I reached the station perimeter, the entire site was ghosted in stormlight. The heliostat mounts were buried to their elbows in snow, and the steel-frame comms tower swayed ominously. I rounded the thermal outbuilding and coasted to a halt in front of the station airlock. Something was wrong.

The main door was sealed.

Now, in Condition Two, the protocol was full lockdown. I knew that. But I also knew my team — Mark, Keller, and Anja — would have had a live band on the UHF. SOP was to monitor the return frequency from the moment I left until I was physically back inside. There was no excuse for silence.

I keyed the mic. “TARS-5, this is Rich. On final approach. Open up.” Nothing.

I cycled the frequency. Tried the backup. Even triggered the old tone squelch band we used during maintenance cycles. Still nothing. The VHF carrier light blinked green — active — but the signal was empty.

“Comms rack might be iced over,” I muttered to myself. Or Keller tried to toast something again…

It wasn’t a joke. He’d once blown a circuit rerouting power from the UHF amp to the galley toaster oven.

I let the BV idle. The heaters held steady at 38°C. Cabin temps were survivable. I leaned back, gloves off, thermos in hand. Just a few minutes, I thought. Let the wind pass. Then I’d try again.

I blinked.

When I opened my eyes, it was morning.

The BV was silent.

The heaters were dead. The cabin air was brittle. Ice had crept across the inside of the windshield, curling like veins. My boots were numb. My fingers — darkening at the knuckles — twitched back into their mittens as I registered what had happened: I’d fallen asleep. The BV had run dry. I was sitting in a block of freezing steel with no comms and a storm still pounding outside.

The latch resisted at first. Ice had frozen it shut. I braced and kicked. The door cracked open with a report like a gunshot. Snow blasted in.

That’s when I saw the tracks.

A single set of bootprints. Leading to the BV. Stopping at the driver’s side. Already softening under fresh powder.

Someone had come.

Someone had looked inside.

And left me.

I dropped from the pilot seat into the waist-deep waves drifting up the side of the cold, dead, vehicle. The cold burned through my thermals like dry ice. I staggered through the gale, following the marker flags toward the vestibule. The main door was ajar.

No light spilled out. Just wind and frost and the faint whine of air moving through a dead vent.

I stepped inside and found the station silent.

Then I smelled blood.

The metallic tang hit me just as I rounded the inner vestibule door. It was faint, but unmistakable. I froze. Even beneath the cold, the air carried it—acrid, stale, clinging to every surface like a residue of violence. My headlamp cut through the gloom, illuminating scattered papers, a fallen chair, and the mess table.

Keller was the first one I saw — I ran to him, nearly slipping on the frosted laminate. The gruesome scene hit me like a truck. Eternally seared into my conscience —

He was slumped forward across the table, body stiff, face submerged in a broken bowl of now frozen chicken noodle soup. Blood had seeped from a dark hole at his right temple and formed an icicle that stretched from his skull culminating into a frozen crimson puddle on the floor below. A second exit wound populated the back of his right shoulder. His lifeless eyes stared back at me — Begging me.

I stumbled back. My breath hitched — The station, our remote sanctuary, had become a tomb. Frozen in time.

I made my way to the lab—each step a battle against disbelief. My boots echoed down the corridor, crunching over shattered glass. The lab door was ajar.

Inside, chaos reigned.

Equipment was overturned. Sample vials shattered across the floor. Papers were everywhere—cabinets and compartments raided, as if someone had ransacked the place with purpose. And amid it all, I found the others.

Anja was lying on the ground near the centrifuge, blood pooled beneath her. Her expression was blank, her eyes wide open, frozen in the moment of her death. The exit wound had bled heavily before the sub-zero temperatures stopped everything cold. She’d been shot at close range in the back of the head. Blood painted the space before her.

Mark was crumpled at the workstation, collapsed over his laptop in his chair. A bullet had torn through his neck, punched through the monitor, and embedded in the wall behind it. One hand still rested on the keyboard, forever paused mid-keystroke.

I couldn’t breathe. My team—my colleagues, my friends—were dead.

They had been executed. Coldly, efficiently. And judging from the disrupted state of the lab—someone had clearly been looking for something. I backed out of the room slowly. I needed air. I needed to try to restore the power before the generator froze over completely and I was dead too — Who knows how long the power was out.

Outside, I fought through the wind and reached the generator housing. The gen-set had been shut down—manually. Breakers flipped. Fuel valves closed. Whoever did this didn’t just kill—they wanted the station to die.

I re-primed the system, flipped the breakers, and cycled the ignition.

The generator coughed and sputtered after a few attempts, then roared to life.

Power returned in sections. Emergency lighting flickered on. The heaters whined as they started their cycle. The ambient temperature began to climb, but the chill inside me wouldn’t leave.

I locked the doors behind me.

Inside, I went straight to comms. Every attempt to raise help returned static. The emergency satellite relay was offline. Sabotaged. The terminal showed clear signs of tampering—connectors yanked, wires clipped, and when I checked the dish itself, the feed horn was grinded clean off.

The shortwave CB still had power. I tried transmitting on emergency bands. I received nothing.

Then I noticed the missing gear.

The GD300s were gone. All of them.

I returned to the lab and took inventory. Files were missing. Cabinets emptied. Sample containers—especially those labeled from Site Delta—were broken or gone entirely. Whoever came wasn’t just cleaning house. They were targeting something. Information. Data. Evidence.

—

The storm lingered for days, oscillating between shrieking gales and deceptive calms that lulled me into hoping it might finally pass. I kept the station sealed and subsisted on the cache of rations from the most recent supply drop — shelf-stable MREs, powdered soups, vacuum-sealed snacks — the usual lineup tailored for long-haul missions in isolated conditions. Vireo’s pantries had been stocked for a crew of four (hauled the near 35 kg crates from the supply drop back inside through three feet of snow myself). I calculated that I had enough caloric resources to last me nearly twelve months if I rationed properly…

The station felt larger now. Not in any physical sense — the modular structure was still a prefab steel skeleton atop stilts, anchored into the permafrost — but in spirit. With my crewmates gone, every corridor echoed. Every door I opened whispered grief.

The bodies had begun to thaw.

Though I’d restored the station’s primary heat loop and localized HVAC systems, I’d sealed off unused compartments to conserve power. The makeshift morgue — formerly the mechanical storage annex — was too insulated to keep the ambient temperature low enough. The smell had begun to creep into adjacent compartments, a grim reminder of entropy reclaiming order. I took an afternoon, grim and cold, to wrap each of them in thermal mylar and stuff them into surplus sleeping bags. One by one, I carried their remains out into the white.

There was a flat patch behind the generator shack where snow accumulated less readily. I used a folding entrenching tool and dug three shallow trenches into the permafrost, just enough to lay them side-by-side. I left markers — simple laminated ID tags on stakes. Thinking back, I may not have even known their real names…

With the crew buried and the wind howling outside, I kept to my routine. Morning diagnostics on the generator, voltage checks on the UPS battery rack, thermal readings from the hab modules. I ran each system through its test cycles manually. The old ways kept me sane.

Then, on the eighth day, the generator failed.

It didn’t sputter. It didn’t warn me with flickering lights or a coolant alarm. It just… stopped. I heard the change before I saw it — the station had a particular hum when fully operational, a subtle vibration that carried through the floorplates. When it died, it felt like someone had sucked all the energy from the air. I was halfway through thawing a meal packet when the lights dimmed and the blower fans went silent.

I sprinted to the power module. The 30kW genset was dark. I checked fuel: half a tank. Oil level? Good. Battery? Fully charged. The control panel threw a general fault, but gave no error code.

I began a manual inspection. Fuel filter: clean. Fuel line: no obstruction. Fuel pump: silent.

I bled the line. Reprimed. Tried to restart.

Nothing.

The solenoid engaged, but the starter didn’t crank. I bypassed the ignition relay with a jumper wire — a risky move in any condition, but necessary. Still nothing. I opened the access panels and felt along the injector rail. Cold. Dead. It was as if the entire engine block had seized despite regular preheater cycles and no prior signs of mechanical stress. With limited tools and no spare components beyond filters, belts, and fluid, I was out of options. The genset was down hard.

The solar array — a modest bank of PV panels ground mounted at the north side of the station — could only supply about 300 watts during peak twilight. Just enough to trickle-charge essential systems and provide minimal lighting. The battery inverter rack still held a decent charge, and I could stretch it by shutting down all non essential loads.

I turned my attention back to the comms rack. The satellite uplink was a loss — connectors severed, circuit boards fried with an unknown, sticky liquid. The coaxial runs had been removed cleanly from their couplings. Not yanked — cut. Whoever did this clearly had a precise understanding of the system architecture.

I stripped back the primary line, rerouted bypass power from the UPS, and jumped the feed into the auxiliary port. Nothing. No initialization. No signal lock. The modem was dead. The backup control board had burn scoring across its terminals and hairline fractures in the SMD components.

All I had left was the shortwave CB and the handheld.

I keyed up and tried transmitting across every emergency band I could. HF, UHF, legacy Antarctic field ops frequencies, even maritime and aviation SAR channels.

Carrier present.

Dead air.

No one was listening.

Or maybe rather, no one could hear me—

And then I made the call.

I’d prep the Hägglunds.

Vostok Station was approximately 402 statute miles southwest, across a hellscape of sastrugi and open plateau. It was the only manned facility within range other than Concordia, Russian-operated, and well-equipped. I could only pray they didn’t mind a stray American.

Concordia was technically closer, but there was no way in. Overwinter crews go into full lockdown — no ingress, no egress. Even in an emergency, they wouldn’t break isolation. It’s not heartless — it’s survival. Opening the station during winter risks internal contamination, depressurization, and exposing the crew to pathogens or unknowns they’re not equipped to handle. With no air access or traversable supply route mid-season, it might as well have been on the moon.

The only reason we could move outside during winter is because Vireo wasn’t a traditional overwinter station. We weren’t built for long-term habitation — no pressurized cleanroom, no medical containment, no psychological screening protocols. We didn’t have the same biosecurity concerns because, officially, we weren’t even there. If one of us died, no one asked questions. Concordia? That place is under constant international scrutiny. Vireo was different. Disposable.

Vostok was farther, sure, and Russian-operated — which raised questions — but I couldn’t see a reason they’d risk killing U.S. personnel over whatever the hell they may have wanted here. And if I was going to make it out alive, it had to be somewhere — anywhere — with a working link to the outside world. Vostok was the only shot I had.

I ran through the loadout checklist line by line. Fuel: topped off. Four reserve jerrycans loaded and secured in the aft module. MREs, snacks, and sealed water bricks packed. JetBoil and propane. Two sleeping systems, double-layered with thermal liners. Ice axe, a shovel, pick, and other tools. Three days of batteries in a vacuum-lined thermal case for my headlamp and flashlight (trust me you’d regret it if they got wet or too cold). Emergency HF whip and trailing wire antenna mounted to the roof rail, etc…

The old machine was idling smoothly now, engine block purring under a preheater cycle. I checked the fluxgate compass, zeroed the heading to 189.61° — my intended track to Vostok from our current position, and did one more exterior check of the rig before my departure.

I climbed into the operator’s seat, sealed the door, and eased the rig forward. The treads bit into the hardened drift.

And I left Vireo Station behind.

Into the cold. Alone.

And headed straight into the unknown.

— Roughly two hours into the drive, the rig’s front-left track threw tension. I didn’t need a warning light — I felt the shift immediately through the chassis: a sluggish veer to the left, followed by an audible slap and grind that cut through the low drone of the engine. I killed the throttle and eased to a stop.

I dismounted into the crunch of firm wind-packed snow, the cold cutting instantly through the seams in my jacket. Light levels were low — unending dim twilight casting the world in a silver-gray hue, the ambient band of light along the horizon barely perceptible from the rest of the icebound sky. Polar twilight. Perpetual dusk. No sun. No stars. Just endless horizon and shadow.

I crouched down beside the track assembly. A thrown idler or snapped guide link, maybe. The entire lead segment of the portside track was loose, having de-tracked around the front bogie, dragged along at tension by the rear module. Catastrophic — enough to halt any serious forward movement. I swore loud into the muffled wind.

I could idle. I could even keep warm. But any further travel was shot unless I wanted to break out the tools and spend hours under a half-ton steel undercarriage in -40°C windchill with no help if something slipped and took a finger.

And that’s when I saw it.

A glow.

Soft. Blue. Static. Roughly two miles out by my estimation — low on the horizon, barely visible through a light veil of blowing surface snow. At first I thought it might be the aurora on the horizon — but it was localized. Too steady. It was a ground source.

Help, maybe? I climbed back into the BV, fetched the binoculars, and propped my elbows on the dash. No radio towers. No structures. Just a single low, steady point of bluish-white light.

I checked the map again, fanned out on the rear seat. According to every known coordinate plotted on the Vostok route vector, there shouldn’t be anything out here. No weather station. No field camp. No markers or terrain features at all. Just bare glacial plateau.

I switched on the onboard CB. “Any station this net, any station this net, this is TARS-5 on mobile. How-you-me, over?”

“TARS-5” was the designated callsign we used for any long-range or unsecure radio transmissions if required for emergency use. Officially-unofficially, it stood for Temporary Atmospheric Research Shelter — a generic label used to mask the station’s true purpose under a plausible civilian research designation. Static.

Nothing but the hollow wash of carrier noise.

I hesitated. Then packed a daypack, slung on my outer shell, and stepped back into the wind. Conditions weren’t terrible. Winds steady at 5-10 knots from the east, with visible low stratiform buildup on the horizon. Maybe five miles out, maybe less. I gave myself an hour to walk out, recon the light, and return. I left the BV running — battery warmed, alternator cycling, cabin temp at 30°C. I topped off the tank manually, cracked the valve on the reserve jerrycan to compensate and then marked my departure point manually with reflective, fluorescent, survey tape on a tall wooden stake and began my walk. It was probably overkill with the obvious bright lights on the rig and all, but if a whiteout swallowed the BV while I was still within walking distance, I wasn’t going to guess my way back through thirty-knot winds if it lost power again- Though even still, it would come down to luck.

I moved fast.

The snow was light and dry — the sort of grainy surface accumulation that made snowshoes practically worthless. Every step sank to just below the knee. I adjusted my gait accordingly, breathing steadily, maintaining heat output without sweating. The wind bit at the gaps around my goggles. The light ahead remained unchanged.

At about the 10-minute mark, I began to notice more of them.

Other lights.

At first just a second, maybe a third point of illumination. Then more. Spaced irregularly along the surface, each casting the same eerie blue halo into the ice and snow.

At 36 minutes, I reached the first about two and a half miles from the rig.

A cube.

Roughly one meter by one meter. Perfectly proportioned. Featureless. Its surface was pure white — not just painted, but impossibly white — albeit near 100%. A thick mist clung to its surfaces, like vapor rolling across dry ice. It sat flush with the ice below, grounded, unmoving.

I walked a slow circle around it, reaching out just short of contact, pulling my hand away quickly. No seams. No ports. No panels- Nothing. I was scared to touch it. Dumbfounded-

The glow had no visible source, nor did its thick mist.

My watch was dead.

I pulled it back inside my glove, tapped it. Nothing. Screen black. No frost, no damage. Just inert.

I glanced north. The BV was still visible. A warm yellow pinprick in the distance. I could still make it back. The storm hadn’t reached me yet.

I began my return back, defeated, extremely confused, and quite unsettled. Though I wanted to investigate further, I knew I needed to leave and head back towards the rig if I wanted to beat the storm.

–-

I heard it first — a sharp, high-pitched tone, just at the edge of perception. It pierced the air like a sustained whine, mechanical yet organic, almost like white noise—except it wasn’t. It was layered, unnatural, vibrating in my teeth. I stopped dead in my tracks, chest tightening. My ears throbbed. And then, instinctively whipped back around-

—and the cube was gone.

In its place — a hole.

I walked back towards — whatever this was — the noise growing louder with each step.

Perfectly square. One meter by one meter. No disturbed snow around it. Just a seamless void in the ground. A negative space. Like a pixel removed from our reality.

No depth. Just endlessness.

From it came the noise — high-pitched, electrical, layered with something deeper. A rumble buried in the frequency.

I stepped closer.

Inside was sky.

Not like the sky above me, but bright, daylight summer sky. Clouds. Blue. Depth. Sunshine.

It was peaceful…

Like someone had cut a square in the ice and opened a window into an entirely different place.

I felt nausea rise in my gut. Not vertigo— Something else. My balance shifted. The pressure in my ears changed, like descending rapidly in a pressurized aircraft. I stumbled back, away from the edge.

The snow had begun to fall and I turned, ran, the noise fading as I gained ground. The snow whipped harder now. The wind’s velocity increasing. The warm glow of the BV slipping in and out of view, obscured by powder and looming darkness.

Then came the sound.

An explosion.

Not concussive — not airburst. Electrostatic. Like the sky tearing open via live amperage.

The world illuminated behind me– I turned again.

The cubes — all of them — were erupting. Shafts of blinding white light firing vertically into the atmosphere, cutting clean through the clouds, illuminating the dense snow like stadium floodlights.

Panic took over. I sprinted.

The terrain was gone, obliterated by snow and noise and light. My chest burned. My lungs clawed for air. My scarf soaked through and froze in layers. I coughed, choked— Vomited into my mask.

The rig was gone… Lost... Swallowed whole—

I fell to my knees — Defeated.

And there — rising from the snow in front of me — another.

Slow. Silent. Steam rolling off its surface like breath from an unseen mouth. It was identical to the first. Unmarred. Impossible.

Divine geometry.

I crawled towards it—

Hand over hand through the drifts. The cold crept into my joints, my spine, my soul.

I stared at the anomaly a foot or two in front of me. Studied it through the curtain of wind and snow…

Slowly, I slid my right glove off… Reaching out — fingers bare now — burning in the negative temperatures. My hand shook as I extended it, inch by inch. The whirlwind I find myself at peace with, now enveloped me in entropy — I’ve accepted my fate.

My final moments.

This is it.

This is how I die.

Face to face with impossible.

Death— Relief from the frozen desert.

The cube illuminating my outstretched arm and naked hand.

The surface met my palm.

And I vanished.

A flash of bright white light—

Silence.

Peace.

Nothing.

Darkness.

Moments later I woke.

The first thing I felt was the heat — thick, dry, and utterly alien, my body violently shaking from the sudden change in temperature. My face was pressed into coarse, sun-baked soil, the scent of wheat and dust thick in my nose. I blinked into a brilliant blue sky framed by golden stalks swaying in the breeze, the wind warm against the back of my neck. Everything was too loud — insects chirping, distant crows calling, the whisper of thousands of dry heads of grain brushing against each other and a slight ringing in my ears that slowly faded — I hurled once more.

My parka clung to me like a wet tarp. I was still in full gear, every zipper and strap accounted for, my boots sinking slightly into loamy, fertile earth. I pushed myself up slowly, the weight of my pack unfamiliar in this heat, my breath ragged — Disorientation. Disbelief.

Shock.

I turned in place. There was no snow. No cubes. No station. No ice. No Hägglunds—

Just field after endless field of wheat, stretching as far as I could see, broken only by a rusted barbed-wire fence and a pale white water tower far in the distance. I staggered backward a few steps, nearly tripping over the only mark left behind — a patch of scorched earth beneath where I had lain, perfectly etched into the soil. My hand still burned. Looked down at my one gloveless palm, half expecting my skin to be gone. But it was there — red, raw, shaking — the anomaly still imprinted in my nerves.

I checked my radio. Fried. I looked at my wristwatch. Still blank. I was somewhere else now. Somewhere real. Somewhere…

Wrong.
