Recently my Boston Terrier ripped up my daughter’s favorite bean bag. We’d been searching on Craigslist for weeks and non drew her attention, until this bright pink Hello Kitty bean bag chair popped up for only $10. It seemed a little suspicious to me, so I went to JohnMayer1989’s account and there were no reviews. I realized at that time I could either disappoint my daughter or man up and take the risk. So I hit JohnMayer1989 up and I said:

StrongSingleDad1: Hey. I am interested in your pink Hello Kitty beanbag. I would like to set up a time and place to meet.
Then I listed my number (which I won’t list here). 

A few hours later, John Mayer responded. 

JohnMayer1989: Sure. I would like to meet you at Crossing Road at 10pm. 

StrongSingleDad1: Can we meet around 5pm? 

JohnMayer1989: I don’t get off until 9:30, so I don’t think that will work. 10 will have to do. 

StrongSingleDad1: Okay, then can we at least meet at a specific location?  

JohnMayer1989: Yes. How about we meet at Walmart parking lot at 10pm. Does that work? 
StrongSingleDad1: Yes. Sounds great. See you then!

The day passed. It was about 9:30 and I decided it was time to take off. My daughter wanted to go with me so we got in the car and drove to the Walmart parking lot. When we got there, the only lights were from the streetlamp and the lot was nearly empty. It was now 10, so I texted John Mayer:

Hey. I am here. Where are you?

He responded:

My truck broke down at crossing road. We can either call this off or you can come meet me here. 
I had a bad feeling in my gut, but my daughter was begging for the chair and said she would never forgive me if I didn’t get her the hot pink Hello Kitty bean bag. So I started up my engine and I put Crossing Road in maps. It said it was located 5 minutes away, so I drove and parked on the side of the road. Surrounding me was deep woods on both sides. I texted John Mayer:

I’m on Crossing Road. I don’t see any other cars. 

He said: I see you Just come out. Just walk straight ahead. I have the bean bag. 

I told my daughter to stay in the car, and I locked her in safely and got out with my wallet. I figured I couldn’t see him because his truck had broken down, and it was too dark to see more than ten feet ahead of me without the help of another’s headlights. I walked down the street using my phone flashlight, and the closer I got the more suspicious it started to seem. I saw a man emerge from the woods holding what appeared to be a bean bag. The man looked decently normal. He had a tall and muscular build with wiry hair and a crooked smile. The closer I got to him, the more off-putting he seemed to be. He was very jittery, darting his eyes  everywhere but at me. 

I walked toward him and said, “Hey man, I’m here for the bean bag.” 

The man said, “Oh yeah, I got the beanbag. Right  here.” 

I shined my light and inspected it. It looked nothing like the beanbag in the ad. It was dirty and spotted with brown and red stains, and it looked like it had been staying in the woods with him for days. I immediately noticed a foul stench. He tried to hand me the beanbag while smiling a very creepy smile. 

I said, “I’m not paying for this. It will cost me more than $10 to refurbish it.” 

The man’s expression immediately changed. 

Two cars pulled up beside us, driving headlightless in the dark. That was my first clue that they had no regard for other people’s wellbeing, and might be accomplices of this strange man. As their doors flew open, John Mayer threw the beanbag at me. It was much heavier than I expected, I stumbled as I caught it. The three men lunged toward me. I caught a glimpse of something sinister in their hands so I ran as fast as I could toward my car and locked myself and our new piece of furniture inside. Outside, all three men were banging their heads against my window. The thud of skull on glass was sickening. I started my engine as fast as I could while trying to explain to my daughter what was happening. We zoomed down the road and never looked back. 

Once home, we were both rattled, but safe. I let my daughter watch Octonauts while I got to work in my craft room, drenching that rotten sack with stain remover and Ozium. I finally put my screen printing skills to good use and with a few google images of Ms. Hello Kitty herself, I was able to make the beanbag look pretty close to as advertised. Although I did give the seller a poor rating, the experience could have been a lot worse. 

One thing has been strange, though. 

The beanbag won’t stop leaking. Styrofoam balls, sure, but sometimes I swear it’s more than that. I’ll find a dead rat on the floor and have no idea how it got there. The other day I found a doll’s head. And when I am very sure my daughter is asleep I hear the scariest moan of a serenade float from under her bedroom door. 

So, JohnMayer1989. Let’s NOT meet again.
