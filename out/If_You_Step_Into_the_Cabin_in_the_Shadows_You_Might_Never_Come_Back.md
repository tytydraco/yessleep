Part 1: The Door That Breathed

I was five when the cabin first saw me.

People said it had no windows, yet something inside stared. Its eyes burned the back of my neck while my parents chopped wood.

“There’s a man watching,” I said. Mud swallowed my shoes. The air reeked of rusty metal. My father froze. My mother’s eyes went hard.

“Nothing lives there,” she whispered.

That night a girl from our street vanished. Her mother screamed until dawn. At breakfast no one spoke. A fresh child-sized handprint shone on the cabin door.

We moved the next week. They called it opportunity. I called it escape.

Twelve years later my art class returns for “local color.” New roads, new lights, same rotting cabin. Its door hangs open, breathing in and out. Mist that smells like wet soil drifts from inside.

The class spreads out to sketch. I should join them, yet the cabin pulls me closer. My skin prickles. I step onto the porch.

Up close, the doorway swallows light. The threshold is warm, beating slow like a heart. Splinters stab my palm, but the wood feels alive.

I never choose to enter. My foot slides from sunlight to dark, and the outside world muffles, distant, like sound behind thick glass.

A child giggles in the dark.

I spin, reaching for light.

The door swings shut.

Click.

The cabin has me.

Part 2: The Things That Wait Upstairs

The door didn’t slam. It clicked, sealing tight. The knob will not turn. No keyhole. Gray air stinks of mold and iron.

From the road the cabin looked like one room. Inside, the ceiling rises into blackness. Stairs float in mid-air, thin boards twisting upward into dark.

I should scream. I only stare.

Shoes carpet the warped floor—tiny sneakers, cracked sandals, single boots. Some ancient, some almost new.

Cold fogs my breath. Something soft bumps my heel. I turn.

A teddy bear slumps against the wall, fur filthy, eyes gone. A Polaroid sits in its lap.

Me.

Taken seconds ago, backpack strap sliding off my shoulder.

Above, a board groans. Slow steps creep downward, each creak buzzing in my teeth.

I press into a corner, clutching my sketchbook.

Halfway down, something drags. Thud, scrape, thud, scrape, as if it can’t decide how many legs it has.

The bear tips over. The photo skids to my feet.

I’m not alone.

The cabin never meant me to be.

Chapter 3: The Voice Behind the Walls

Thud. Scrape. Thud. Scrape.

It creeps closer. I hold my breath.

The steps stop overhead, yet the staircase is empty. Sound still pulses from the ceiling, as if something crawls inside the wood.

A chill slides across my neck though there are no windows. The walls exhale dust. A whisper leaks out, first sighs, then words.

“Do you see them too?”

A child’s voice, too near.

I spin. No one. The bear now faces the corner. I never touched it.

Another photo flutters to my shoe.

It shows the stairs. Something tall waits at the top, long arms, no face. It watched me.

I back away. My fingers brush letters carved into the wall.

Don’t speak back.

The whisper dies.

Footsteps stir again, inside the ceiling, slow and hungry.
