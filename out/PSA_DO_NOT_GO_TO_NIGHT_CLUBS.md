So as the title states please do not go to night clubs. I’m going to tell you my experience. Hi, my name is Maggie. I am a 32 year old male. Silly name for a guy, I know. My friends affectionately call me Maggot. If you’re reading this, we are now friends and you may refer to me as Maggot as well. Maggie works too for those of you worried about offending me, trust me you won’t. 

I guess I’ll start with how I got in this situation. My partner of 8 years, whom I will refer to as Jack for privacy reasons, apparently was a scum bag that cheated our entire relationship. No, I don’t want pitty. It’s important to note, due to this circumstance my friends deemed me as desperate, which led me to the situation I was in. 

Friday I went to work as usual. Afterwards I went straight home. When I got home to my small 2 bedroom apartment, that still faintly smelled like Jack’s cologne, my “friends” anxiously awaited me, sitting on the couch. 

I use the word “friends” loosely. They were trouble. Every time they were around, we were getting into some trouble that only I could get them out of. They were still stuck in their teenage years, even though we were all well into our 30’s. I think that’s why I was kept around. I don’t think they really enjoyed my company, but I was needed. To keep the peace. To smooth talk our way out of situations. Being an attorney by day, it’s what I did for a living anyway. 

As I let out a sigh, audible enough for the neighbors to hear through the thin walls, my friends excitedly greeted me when I entered the door. They were so elated to tell me about the new night club in the city. How everyone was talking about it, how it was time for me to get up and put myself out there again. 

The fact that I didn’t want to go had nothing to do with the harsh reality that I wasn’t over Jack. Night clubs weren’t my scene. I wasn’t the kind of person interested in one night stands and random hookups. Truthfully, I wasn’t interested in anything at all romantically from anyone. My friends knew that. They needed me once again, in case they needed a designated driver, I don’t drink, to get them and their “lover”, for the night at least, to a hotel safely.

Against everything in me screaming  that this isn’t my type of scene, that obviously they are abusing our “friendship” and are using me once again. I said “yes”. I know what you’re going to say. “Maggie, these people aren’t even your friends”. To which you would be correct. Maybe I thought I needed a night out. It has been a while. Jack loved the night life. I never went out with him, which I blame the reason for his infidelity. I think the new Maggie needs to be more adventurous, and that starts tonight. 

I got dressed in my best casual attire. Nothing fancy. Not the usual suit and tie I was used to. Just a nice pair of dark wash blue jeans, a freshly pressed white button down with a few buttons undone, my friends doing, to show my dark thick chest hair, my hair styled perfectly, and a pair of black Gucci loafers. I’ll admit I looked silly beside my friends with their own variations of leather vests, assless chaps with fishnets underneath, leather newsboy hats, gold gender symbol necklaces hidden in their chest hair, and those black leather combat boots that had huge heels on them. That wasn’t my style. It was, however, very much their style so I thought nothing of it. 

We all took turns having one final look at ourselves in my full length mirror in my apartment Correcting any imperfections. I was last and when it was my turn I said some positive affirmations and then closed and locked the door behind me. 

I drove for what seemed like forever. It felt like we were driving out of the city into a whole new city. One that was only accessible if you were a member of the queer community. There were all kinds of bars, lounges, clubs, all geared towards people like us. Like our own little safe haven from the outside world. Places we could be who we wanted to be without fear of being judged or harmed. I started to let my guard down as we passed all the bright colors of neon signs and people like us, walking the streets, able to be who they wanted to be. It was almost euphoric. I suddenly seemed to feel like it wasn’t as bad as I thought it was going to be. I was almost excited, comfortable. 

As we drove away from the bright, beautiful, sights that I became excited to be apart of, we pulled up to a different building. This one was not colorful. This one made me feel that same awful overwhelming feeling of I don’t belong. This one was scary to me. A place I thought only existed in hardcore pornography. A place that shouldn’t really exist, at least in my mind. 

I parked the car and as we walked up I studied the strange building more closely. The outside of the building was all different shades of blacks and greys, even the mortar used to slap the black bricks together was a shade of blackish grey. We rounded the corner and I stood in shock as my friends ran past me to get to the end of the line. I saw men, all dressed similar to my friends, some silent, emotionless, awaiting their turn to enter the dull building. That’s when my thoughts were confirmed. This was a gay BDSM club. 

I realized I was probably looking foolish just standing and staring. I was so out of place and uncomfortable, but I didn’t want to offend anyone so I found my place in line with my friends. I didn’t put up a fight as not to cause a scene, I wasn’t the confrontational type unless I was working. I figured I’d have plenty of time for that when we finally left this place.  This wasn’t my idea of a night out at all, but since I’m out why not make the most of it? I did say I wanted to be more adventurous.

My friends were in line laughing, jumping up and down, and having a good time. My eyes went to the men in line with the blank expressions and almost robotic movements while flashing their phones which contained their tickets to the bouncer at the entrance. I wasn’t worried about the ticket part. I knew for a fact my friends purchased a ticket for me. They did need me of course. As we got to the bouncer they showed their tickets, which obviously as I thought, they had a ticket for me as well. 

When we got inside I was met with the smell of sweat, cheap alcohol, and the sound of techno music no one recognized but all seemed to move perfectly in sync to. My friends looked at me and told me to keep an eye on my phone as they all fled different directions in search of their prey for the night. I was alone. Looking around at all the grinding and other inappropriate for public things that were going on,  alone didn’t seem too bad. 

I found myself an empty seat at the bar looking out at the sea of men and having a better look at the inside of the building.  Much like an abandoned warehouse the floor was concrete and there were exposed metal beams on the ceiling showing chipping paint. Every sex toy you could imagine lined the walls. Half of the men seemingly were having a good time, while the other half just didn’t sit right with me. As an attorney my job is often to study and read people. Try to figure them out. There was something off with about half of the men. Their same blank expressions as in line. 
I tried to ignore it and loosen up as the music boomed through the inside of the building.

Remember, I don’t drink so I was sitting at the bar trying to strike up a conversation with the bartender when I heard it. A sound that will never escape my mind. I heard a man let out the most primal scream I have ever heard. 

I turned to look and what I saw wasn’t anything my brain could comprehend. It was a chubby man with Snow White hair and beard bent over in his leather outfit and one of the emotionless men behind him. It ripped off its skin and bdsm garb allowing everyone to see what it really was. It was all white, thin, tall, alien like, with sharp teeth, no eyes, and a huge retractable spiked rod where its penis should be. I looked closer as the man was still screaming and saw the barbed rod enter through his anus and exit through his mouth.  Blood dripping from every one of his orifices. 

The being that impaled the man let out a high pitched scream. Which looking back now must have been their way of communicating to one another. One after the other all the emotionless men shed their human costumes all letting out the shrill screams and exposing their barbed “penis”. 

All the actual human men started yelling and attempting to escape. The beings all jutting out their barbed penises impaling the real men mid sprint. Blood and screams saturated the dance floor as everyone attempted to run away. 

The bartender grabbed my hand and pulled me to the emergency exit behind the bar. I was happy to see he was an actual human. We ran out of the building not caring if anyone else made it out. He ran to his vehicle and I ran to mine. We both simultaneously drove away as fast as we could. Never looking back. 

I was safe. I made it out alive. There were never any news stories. It’s like that place rid all real people whom could tell what happened and all that was left were the beings. I never got a text from any of my “friends”. I can only assume the worst. I guess this is one situation I couldn’t get them out of, although I didn’t even try to help them. Maybe they sort of deserved it? Life is returning to normal and I haven’t discussed what I saw with anyone, until now of course. This is my official PSA to all. PLEASE DON’T BE TEMPTED TO VISIT NIGHT CLUBS. If you do go, please be on the lookout for those with blank, lifeless expressions. Chances are they aren’t as they appear.
