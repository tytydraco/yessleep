The night was unusually still as I stepped into my old house, the air thick with dust and memories. It had been years since I’d last visited, but the urge to return had been nagging at me. The floor creaked under my weight, and I was immediately reminded of the countless times I’d wandered these rooms as a child.

As I moved through the darkened hallways, a sense of unease settled over me. I flicked on my flashlight, the beam cutting through the gloom, revealing faded photographs and cobwebs. The house felt alive, whispering secrets in the silence.

I paused in front of my childhood bedroom. The door was slightly ajar, a strange invitation. I pushed it open, and the stale air rushed out, mingling with something else—something sweet and rotten. Inside, everything was as I remembered, except for the faint scratching sound coming from the closet.

Curiosity piqued, I approached the door, hesitating for a moment before grasping the handle. With a deep breath, I pulled it open, but the closet was empty. I felt a chill run down my spine and chalked it up to my imagination, but as I turned to leave, the scratching resumed, louder this time.

I slammed the closet door shut and backed away, my heart racing. I tried to convince myself it was just the house settling, but the scratching persisted. I grabbed my phone, the only source of light, and shone it into the dark corners of the room, hoping to find some rational explanation.

Suddenly, the scratching stopped. I stood frozen, the silence deafening. Then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw movement—a shadow darting across the room. I spun around, but there was nothing there. The air grew heavy, thick with an unshakeable dread.

Feeling the walls closing in, I hurried down the hallway, desperate to escape the oppressive atmosphere. As I reached the living room, I froze again. The front door was ajar, swinging gently as if someone had just come in—or perhaps gone out.

I stepped closer, my pulse quickening. That’s when I heard it—a soft, childlike giggle coming from the shadows. I turned, scanning the room, but only darkness stared back. “Hello?” I called out, my voice trembling.

No answer. Just silence. I backed away toward the door, ready to bolt when a soft hand brushed against my ankle. I yelped and looked down, but again, there was nothing—just the empty space where a child might have been.

Panicking, I pushed the door open wider and stepped outside, gasping for breath. The night air felt cool against my skin, but the sense of being watched sent chills down my spine. I looked back at the house, its dark windows staring at me like hollow eyes.

And then I saw her. A little girl stood at the edge of the porch, her face pale, eyes wide and unblinking. She wore a tattered dress, her hair hanging in tangled strands. She pointed toward the house and whispered something I couldn’t hear, but the expression on her face was clear—she was warning me.

Before I could react, she vanished, dissolving into the night like mist. I stumbled backward, terror gripping me. I turned and ran, the echoes of that giggle haunting my ears.

I didn’t stop until I reached my car. As I drove away, I glanced in the rearview mirror. The house loomed behind me, a dark silhouette against the moonlit sky. I could swear I saw a figure standing in the window, watching, waiting.

But when I looked again, there was only darkness.
