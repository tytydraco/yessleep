Every night at exactly eight thirty-five, my father would secure the front door. The lock on the knob, two locks up top (one with a chain, another a latch), a childproof doorknob cover, and last of all a doorstopper was wedged as far beneath it as he could manage. No minute too late; no minute too early. It was a ritualistic chore, one my mother used to just shrug off with a *‘your father just likes being safe.’*

I remember the first time I’d caught him doing it. It was eight thirty-three and I was just about to drift off to sleep when I heard shouting from down the hall.

“What have I always told you, woman! Eight thirty-five!”

“Jim please, I let you do this idiotic ritual every night for nine years. Don’t you *dare* yell at me!”

“Well I wouldn’t have to if you’d fucking listen! It needs to be done at thirty-five, not thirty-three! Undo that goddamn lock!”

A huff of frustration was quickly followed by the jingle of various locks before the door creaked open.

“I just can’t with you tonight.” the shuffle of fabric “I’m going out for a walk.”

“Irene, *do not* go out there. They’ll come after you and I won’t go out there to save you!”

“I’ll take my chances.”

*“Irene–”*

The door slammed shut behind my mother just as I crept out from the hallway. I saw my father give the door an angry stare before he whipped around with a grumble about *‘needing a drink.’* He began to stomp away to the kitchen before noticing me in the shadows. The anger from before drained instantly.

“Hey buddy… you’re supposed to be sleepin’.”

My arms tightened around the stuffed toy in them.

“I heard yelling…Is mommy okay?”

My father sighed. “Your mother just… she needed some time to herself.”

“Is she going to be okay?”

“She…” a pause. I watched his face sadden. “I don’t know, buddy.”

My face paled; the toy fell from my arms. My father seemed to sense the shift in the air and quickly dropped to one knee so his hands could wrap over my shoulders.

“Hey, it’s going to be okay. Your mom’s a fighter. If anyone can survive out there, it’s her.”

“S-survive?”

Lips pulled back in a grimace. His hands tightened for only a moment before falling away as he rose to his feet.

“Did I say survive? No, no, I meant uh–”

The words died on my father's tongue as a melody began to play from his back pocket. I watched as his face went white as a sheet before heavy footsteps barreled in the direction of the front door. Each lock clicked into place at rapid speed thanks to muscle memory. I walked up to my father just as he was starting to kick the doorstopper into place.

“Daddy, what’s going on? Isn’t mommy still outside?”

“Not now, buddy!”

After one last kick he began to run around the house, shutting off every light and pulling closed every curtain. When the house was well secured my father scooped me into his arms and carried me to the couch where he dropped onto it with a grunt.

“Da-”

A large hand covered my mouth before I could try to say anything. Frustrated, I tried to lift my arms, but they were bound against my sides by my fathers own, which held me securely against his chest. My head strained to look back, my legs kicked at the air. I opened my mouth to scream against his palm when I heard it.

*Rattle. Click. Rattle.*

My father held me tighter as prayers fell from his mouth.

“Heavenly Father, I come to you in the name of Jesus, acknowledging your power and sovereignty,”

*Rattle. Rattle.*

“I pray for your divine protection over me and my loved ones. Surround us with your angels and create a hedge of safety around us,”

*A knock.*

“Jim?”

I felt my father shift from behind me, felt the hand over my mouth loosen.

“Jim, this isn’t funny! Open this door right now!”

“Mommy?”

As soon as the word left my mouth the hand was back against it. My father shuffled us further against the back of the couch.

“Guard us from harm, both seen and unseen, and keep us secure in your loving care.”

“Jim!” my mother knocked angrily at the door. “Damnit won’t you ju- oh! Oh hello, hi. Could you help me?”

I could feel tears wetting the back of my neck.

“I trust in your promise that no weapon formed against us shall prosper–”

“My husband locked me out of the house. If you could just- wait. No, no, stop. Stop! Get away from me!”

“In Jesus' name, I pray. *I pray*,”

The door shook like something had been thrown against it. The world fell silent as my mothers screams and begs for mercy echoed into the night, mixing with the soft sound of my father crying into my hair. I was in shock. What sort of monster was currently taking my mother from me. Why wasn’t anyone helping? Why weren’t *we* helping?

*“Amen… Amen, Amen, Amen…”*

We held her funeral two weeks later. It was a small thing; My aunts and uncles, a few cousins and my grandparents who babysat me while my father attended to everything. There was no body to put in the casket, so we placed a few of my moms most precious possessions in her place. An old music box from her parents, a pair of shoes from when I was a baby, and a framed photo of our family.

I remember small parts of the event; mainly how people yelled and scolded my father for not doing something. For hiding like a coward while my mom was out there all alone. He didn’t fight back. He just sat in one of the foldable chairs with the most defeated look on his face.

That was fifteen years ago.

Since then my father has been different. Quiet and skittish; like a baby deer. I was pulled out of school and was taught exclusively at home. I didn’t have many friends and the few I had could only come to my house, I couldn't go to theirs. But no one wants to come to the house of the kid whose dad checks on him every half hour. Whose dad has over twenty locks on the front door and just as many on the windows. Whose dad insisted every bedroom door be open at all times so if anything happened he could get there as soon as possible. Whose dad was afraid of losing what little family he had left.

But I’m twenty-four now. I have a girlfriend, somehow, one who understands my father to the best of her abilities. She never questioned our small practices and always respected his three house rules. 

1. *Always come over before eight pm*
2. *Never unlock the doors or windows until at least nine in the morning*
3. *Always say nightly prayers before bed*

We were supposed to meet for lunch but something had happened at her job; so we postponed it until later that night. My father was more than happy to have her over and spent a good few hours preparing dinner. I could see him giving the clock a glance every time he walked past it. Could see the way his hands began to twitch with nervousness the closer the clock's hands got to seven. And when they reached eight-fifteen, he was in full panic mode.

“Maybe you two should reschedule for tomorrow.” He said while pulling back the window curtain to peek out at the street.

“Dad, it’s okay. Elowyn sent me a text that she was on her way like five minutes ago.”

“But the building is at least twenty minutes away! What if there’s traffic? An accident? You have to call her and tell her to go straight home.”

“Dad-”

“Son, please.” he turned to me, eyes wide with terror. Trembling hands grasped the front of my shirt. *“Call her.”*

I hadn’t heard my father talk like that in a long time. The way his words trembled like he was on the verge of tears. The layer of fear that clung to him like barbed wire. I hadn’t heard him speak like that since the night my mother passed. So I nodded, took out my phone, and called Elowyn. The phone rang three times before her voice crackled to life on the other end.

“Charlie?”

“Elowyn! How far are you from my house?”

“I don’t know, like… maybe thirteen minutes? Why, what’s wrong?”

“Okay, I need you to get over here now. Or try to get to your parents place, just race over to either one.”

“What, like… go over the speed limit?”

“If you have too.”

“Charlie, I'm not breaking the law.”

“I don’t care about the law! Just–”

I felt my father tug the phone from my hand and turned just in time to see him put it to his ear.

“Elowyn, you listen to me right now. No, you are gonna shut up and listen.” he glared briefly in my direction before looking at the floor. “This isn’t a fucking game. It’s life or death. Now you are gonna put your goddam foot on the pedal and get over to a fucking house!”

I tried to reach for the phone but my father pressed his hand to my chest to keep me back. I could hear Elowyns voice on the other end shout briefly in anger before it settled. Another minute passed before he finally relaxed.

“Thank you.. Now I'm serious, you hurry over here. And if you can’t get here in time just lock the car and lay on the floor in the back. I’ll… I’ll pray for you.”

She said something, probably a thank you or a goodbye, before he hung up and tossed the phone onto the nearby couch. He let out a heavy sigh and ran a hand through graying hair.

“She’s on her way.” a beat of silence. His smile was weak. “Come on, let's get something in our bellies before she gets here. I made a damn good pot roast.”

It’s eight thirty-four now.

She’s not here.

I was pacing around the living room, pinky nail caught between teeth. My eyes kept drifting to the front door where my father stood, waiting for the alarm on his phone to chime. But we couldn’t do the locks, we just couldn’t! Not with Elowyn still out there!

I grabbed my coat and walked to the door but my hand was smacked just as it reached for the knob.

“Ow- Dad what the hell?!”

“Don’t even think about it. It’s one minute till thirty-five.”

“Yeah and Elowyn’s still out there! I have to go get her!”

“No you don’t. If she’s smart she’ll do what I said and stay in the car. All we can do is wait until morning.”

“Like hell. I’m going to get her.”

I tried to push past him but my father elbowed me in the chest and knocked me onto my ass. I barely had time to register what happened before that familiar melody began to play and he started shifting the locks into place. I was able to reach out and grab onto his pant leg before he could start kicking in the doorstopper.

“Dad, please. We can’t leave her out there–”

I could barely make out the shift in his expression; the way his brows met and his lips pulled downwards. He didn’t want to leave her to the beast outside, he didn’t want to risk her having the same fate as my mother. I know he wanted to go out there. But he didn’t. Instead, he placed a gentle hand to the top of my head and pushed. My back hit the floor as the sounds of him kicking the doorstop echoed off the walls.

My chest fell hollow. My body felt like it was made of steel. I prayed silently in my head for Elowyn's protection and for forgiveness. I know I didn’t deserve it; I was leaving her like a sheep in a den full of wolves. But I knew the dangers, my father knew the dangers, I could only hope that she understood it too.

“Charlie.” my father bent at my side. “Let's go say our prayers.”

I don’t remember how he got me off the floor and to the table but suddenly I was sitting across from him and watching him light a lavender scented candle. My favorite.

Once the candle was lit he set the lighter down and brought his hands together over the table. A few seconds passed before he gave an encouraging smile.

“Do you want to do the prayer today?”

I didn’t say anything. I just put my hands together and closed my eyes.

“Lord, we pray for the safety and protection of our family members. Keep us safe from harm and lead us–”

*Rattle.*

My fathers chair squeaked as he moved. I cleared my throat.

“Lead us in the paths of righteousness.”

*Knock. Knock.*

“Charlie!”

The chair fell over as I stood, eyes opening to stare in the direction of the front door.

*“Elowyn?”*

I heard my father stand up.

“Charlie, I'm here! Open the door!”

“I- I’m coming! Just hold on!”

I made a run for the door but my father was quick to grab the back of my shirt. Limbs flailed as I fell back.

“Let go of me! Elo-!”

His hand covered my mouth as I tried to scream out to her, to let her know that I hadn’t forgotten her, that I wouldn’t let anything happen to her.

“Charlie, stop-” he hissed as I threw myself around in an attempt to loosen his grip. He only held on tighter. “You can’t!”

“Charlie please! I know I’m late, I'm sorry! But let me- oh! Hello.”

We both froze, listening in as Elowyn spoke to whatever was out there with her. I could hear the fear in her words growing stronger as she knocked desperately on the door one last time. When her scream broke through, I panicked. My head reeled back to uncover my mouth before it opened to bite down against my fathers thumb. He yelped in pain as I bit down harder, enough to draw blood. The metallic taste coated my tongue as he dropped me to clutch his hand in pain. Me? I bolted to the door.

“I’m coming, Elowyn!” I shouted while kicking at the stopper until it came loose and skidded across the floor. I pulled back each lock and cupped the cover with both hands to throw open the door. I was going to run out in some heroic act of bravery but one foot was barely out the door before I froze in place.

Out on the porch was Elowyn, cornered against the railing with a pocket knife in her hand. One of her eyes was squeezed shut and bleeding, five long scratches running along it to her jaw. She looked in my direction and whimpered, mouthing the words *‘help me.’*

The person, no, *monster* above her, slowly turned to me. 

It was human *shaped* but... wrong. Its knees were backwards and the arms went all the way down to the floor. Its body was entirely black, like you were looking into a void. It was also entirely naked, though it wasn’t like you were able to see anything because again; it was black. But it had a mask. A plastic one where you could only see the eyes, which seemed to glow an ominous red.

And they were looking right at me.

The creature made a soft clicking noise as its body turned fully, clawed hands dragging along the porch. Its head cocked to the side like a curious bird as I took a step back into the house. I could hear my father somewhere behind me running to the other end, probably to get a weapon; hopefully to get a weapon. Meanwhile I was stuck with this *thing* that was slowly coming towards me. In a panic, my hands shot out in a stop motion.

“Get out of here!” I shouted, stomping my foot once like I was trying to scare away a wild animal. “Stay away from us!”

To be fair, it *did* stop… for about five seconds. Then it lunged, knocking me onto the ground so hard that I could feel the breath in my lungs give out. It didn’t attack though. It hovered over me like a beast, letting out short clicks as its mask twitched and pressed against the sides of my face like it was searching for something. I tried to lift my arms to push it off but it was quick to restrain them above my head. I tried to shout, but the words died in my throat. All I could do was watch as those horrid eyes met mine once more. It clicked. One hand dragged up to the mask, and lifted it. Its face was just as empty as the rest of it; the only exception being the two beady red eyes that refused to look away. Another click. It leaned in and nudged its face against my mouth. I watched as those same eyes grew wider in horrifying delight.

It smelt blood. My dads blood. The blood currently drying on my chin.

My eyes widened in fear as I watched it sit up above me, its clicks making a melody that almost sounded like laughter. A line formed on its face and slowly opened. A mouth. One filled with razor sharp teeth and a split tongue that danced in the air. My body trembled as it freed my arms to grab my face. My hands shot out to press against its chest as my mouth was forced open. I tried to scream but it was blocked out by the monster's tongues forcing into my mouth and down my throat. They worked to slide along every crevice, making sure no speck of blood was left unnoticed.  I could only thrash beneath it, kicking and clawing at skin that felt like cold metal. My eyes burned with salty tears and I could feel bile working its way up just to be stopped by the appendages in its way. 

I started growing limp; weak. My muscles burned and my mouth tasted like sulfur. I’m sure it had gotten it all, that I had nothing left to give. But it persisted, claws digging into the side of my head as it forced my mouth to open wider. My eyes started to shut. I gave up.

“Hey!”

The monster stilled. I felt its tongues slowly retract.

“Get the hell off my boy!”

A gun cocked. *Bang.* 

My body lurched as the monster was thrown off me. I heard it hit the opposite wall. It gave one last click then fell silent. My eyes opened to find my father hovering above me with a shotgun in his hands.

“Charlie! Charlie, can you hear me, buddy?”

I groaned, rolling onto my back. “Dad? You… You own a gun?”

“Of course I do, dumbass.”

He chuckled and shifted the gun into one hand so the other could reach down. My own hand lifted, fingers barely brushing his before a light clicking came from the side. Our heads turned just in time to see the creature rising on bent legs. Its claws scratched against the mask laying on the floor, one finger hooking against the string on the back to lift it in the air. Red eyes locked onto my father who was already reloading the shotgun.

“Do your worst, you son of a bitch.” he cocked the gun, aimed, and fired.

A short screech left the creature as it knocked back against the wall for a second time. It recovered quickly though, pulling the mask over its face before rushing at my father who was trying to get another shot in. I scrambled to my feet as it knocked him down, claws sinking into forearm. He screamed in pain, fist pounding against the side of its face as he cursed at it.

I ran for the shotgun. My fingers managed to brush the handle before I was knocked back by a clawed hand. That same hand came around my throat as I hit the wall, lifting me so my feet dangled. It hissed from behind the mask, pulling me forward before slamming me back against the wall. It pulled for a second time before it screeched as Elowyn drove her knife into its shoulder. It threw me as it turned and my head hit the corner at the hallway. I could hear my name being shouted as everything went black.

The sun was barely cresting over the horizon when I finally woke up. My head throbbed as I forced myself onto my feet, eyes scanning the living room.

“Dad?”

I forced myself down the hallway, peeking into rooms and switching on lights that made my eyes feel like they were bleeding.

“Elowyn?”

No response. I made my way back to the living room where the front door was wide open and barely hanging onto the hinges. The porch was covered with scratch marks and streaks of blood, but that's where it ended. No trail. No sign. Just two abandoned cars in the driveway.

I don’t know how I did it, but I managed to drive myself to the hospital before I could pass out a second time. The doctor said I was lucky to have survived such an attack. Most people didn’t.

I asked if they could contact the police. I needed to put out a watch for my dad and girlfriend. They could still be out there and that thing needed to be killed! She refused. She just patted me on the shoulder with an unconvincing look of sympathy and told me to move on. I tried to argue, tried to say that they could still be alive. But she brushed me off. She said she’d seen lots of people like me. People that refused to believe it, refused to let those monsters get away with snatching up the ones they loved.

After an hour of begging she finally called the cops, but not for my family– for me.

She said they had a program for victims of attacks. A home where we could live with similar folk, recount our stories, and learn how to be ones with society again. She even gave me this dumb brochure but I tore it up when she left. I don’t need a fucking brochure or some kind of rehab center. I need my *family.*

So I left. I slipped out when she went to go check on another patient and bolted to the bus station. From what I've heard the cops completely blocked off my house which leaves me with nothing but my bloody clothes from last night and enough bus money to get me across town. I don’t know where I’m going to go but I know that I'm going to look for my family. My dad spent my whole life protecting me from that monster and if there’s even a chance they’re still alive I'm going to do the same.

Keep your doors locked. And if you're stupid enough not to, then you better learn how to fight. 

You’ll lose, but at least you won’t make it easy.
