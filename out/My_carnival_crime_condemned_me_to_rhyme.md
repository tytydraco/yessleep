Perhaps it seems I'm faking it, for such a tiny crime. That carnival has altered me, and I can only rhyme. I wish I never went that day, that I just stayed home. But now that my fate, it has been sealed, I write with this new tone.

The carnival was in my town, I thought it might be fun. Some interesting performances, and junk food by the ton. I sat within the tent that day and watched it all take place. I got my twenty dollar's worth but didn't leave with haste.

When all was done, the crowd filed out, their laughter filled the air. The ringmaster took off his hat, and gave a practiced stare. He thanked the folks for coming by, then vanished through the veil. The tent seemed smaller once he’d gone, and dimmer, sickly pale.

I lingered where the curtains split, to glimpse behind the show. Just canvas, ropes, and shadowed forms that swayed so soft and low. A voice behind me whispered, *“Sir, The exit’s to your right.”* I nodded, but my feet betrayed, and led me to the night.

Beyond the tents, the air was still, the rides no longer spun. A fog crept in across the grass, and hid the setting sun. The game stands leaned like crooked teeth, their prizes torn and gray. A puppet show still whispered lines though no one watched its play.

The puppets twitched on tangled strings, their painted mouths ajar. They bowed before a shadowed form that waited by the bar. I thought it was a person there a worker left behind. But when it turned, I swear I saw No eyes of human kind.

The blackened form rose up like smoke its visage dark as night. Only piercing through the void two eyes, and smile bright. Those eyes, they pierced into my soul and made my heart despair. All I wanted from that point was to be far from there.

It spoke, or maybe somewhat *sang*, a humming low and deep. The words slid round my reason’s edge and burrowed in like sleep. It said my name in broken tones, then laughed, as if in jest. And from the dark, the ringmaster stepped forth in crimson vest.

*“You’ve seen the part of our show, the one not meant for men. You took a step past curtain’s* edge. *And won’t step back again.”* Before I turned, the strings were thrown, the dolls began to climb. Their grinning faces whispered soft, and wrapped me up in twine.

They dragged me to a farther tent and fixed me to a cart. It sat upon a set of rails, from whence I would depart.

I yelled and screamed, *please let me go!* But my cries they would not heed. The ringmaster stepped into view, and gave his practiced screed.

*"You've seen something that you should not, We can't just let you go. But how severe your consequence, is just for you to know. You'll play a game, maybe two or more. Your success in each determines what's in store. So step right up, the first draws nigh, it's time to see where your future lies.*

The cart took off, into the dark, it screeched and slowed as it came to park. The spotlight shone on my makeshift train, revealing my task, my first skill game. On top of that, to make things worse, A crowd of beings appeared, observing my curse.

Before me lay in tight array, dozens of heads floating in jars. Each awake in greenish brine, looking at me from afar. Their eyes though distorted by rounded glass showed pity I could sense. As if, if I got this wrong, I might soon be thece. *"You've got three balls to toss ahead, Get one of them in a jar. It's your life you'll be wagering If you don't make the par."*

Trembling hand, I took the first. And said a silent prayer. I raised my arm and gave a toss, The ball flew through the air. It landed on a jar's thick rim And bounced off through the dark. Two more tries to save my life. I had to meet my mark.

The faces in the jars all turned, their mouths began to hum. A hollow choir of bubbling sound It made my fingers numb. I cast the throw with shaking hand, it veered, then curved askew. It struck a lid, rolled down the side and vanished from my view. The ringmaster spread out his arms, and said, *“One chance, here it comes.”* The final ball felt heavier, As though it knew my crime. I whispered once, *“Lord, let it fall,”* and threw for one last time.

It arced across the stagnant air, and hung there for a beat. Then dropped into a waiting jar. The crowd leapt to its feet. A cheer rang out, half joy, half pain, that echoed through the gloom. The heads all blinked, then slowly sank, each vanishing in its tomb.

The ringmaster removed his hat, and bowed with practiced pride. *“Well done,”* he said, *“You live for now. But there are more who’ve tried.”* He snapped his cane, the cart lurched forth, And vanished down the track. The laughter followed through the dark, and dared me not look back.

*"You've won your life, you must be glad but now we have to see, if you will be leaving here With your sanity."*

The next game came into my view, my countenance, it fell. As I beheld that classic game, with the hammer and the bell.

*"If you like your mind, you'll listen now.* *For this I won't repeat. For every inch you fall below, your sanity retreats. So strike with heart and don't fall short, you'll only have one shot. So take the mallet in your hands and slam it on that spot!"*

I took the mallet, picked it up, And felt a sudden shock. As if the tool within my hands was silently taking stock. My mind felt fuzzy, I reigned it in, And swung with all my might. And kept my focus razor sharp, on that ascending light.

The bell I missed, by just an inch, but felt I did quite well. But vaguely I received the change, My cognizance, it fell. But only by a small amount, I really can't complain. So with a sigh I felt me move onto my final game.

*"You've done quite well, I'll tell you. The worst is yet behind. But given your grave trespass, a consequence you'll find. You're still alive, your mind is sound, so you might hope to tell, our secret to the watching world, and put us all through hell. So, something we must do to you, and you'll determine which. Just spin the wheel that's up ahead. We'll end without a hitch."*

The wooden wheel before me, painted and lit up, Each slot contained a curse for me, a drink that I must sup. I surveyed the possibilities, and shuddered with a fright. Would I lose my tongue, my ears, or possibly my sight?

The choices seemed offputting, but nothing could be done. I placed my hand upon the wheel, and pulled it til it spun. My readers know what happened next, what my lot would be. But compared with the choices on the wheel, this one relieved me.

*"You've survived the trial, with little but a scratch. But no one will believe you, when you talk like that. So find yourself lucky, That all you do is rhyme. But one more thing, you work here now. Your first shift starts at nine"*

So if you find the carnival, Avoid it at all cost. For those who see the final act, can never count [the lost.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MattBenjamin/)
