I found him on Craigslist. The ad’s description was short and to the point:

“Too Lazy? Death motivates! Hire a personal hit man for $100/month to meet your goals. No refunds. No cancellations.”

I thought it was funny. At first. There was a whole profile page for the guy. He was bald, had a squashed nose. His eyes were like tiny pinpricks in his thick face. Piggy eyes. His ears were cauliflowered out, big and swollen. 

He kinda looked like a cartoon character made out of flesh. 

The strangest bit: he was *smiling*. I didn’t think hit men were supposed to do that. His upper and lower lips were drawn into a soft, knowing smile, like there was some old joke between us that he was remembering. It would have been comforting–if I had known what the joke was.

He creeped me out, but I was intrigued. 

I’m a writer, and to be honest, I’ve always been a little lazy.

It comes down to a problem I’ve been dealing with most of my life. Let me paint a picture. On any day of the week, I’ll go to my computer and sit down to write. I have every intention of finally doing it, finally getting to that one scene I’ve been going over in my head for weeks. I’d open up the document, stretch my fingers and wiggle them around to warm them up.

Then I stare at the blank page for ten seconds. Thirty seconds.

I blink, and somehow it’s thirty minutes later. And I’m balls deep in *Diablo 2*

I was a mess, but I knew that if I had the proper motivation, I could finish my book. It’s a book I’ve been working on for the past five years: a swashbuckling mystery-romance-historical-musical (with inspiration from Faulkner.)

Its use of ska really embellishes its themes.

But every time I would make progress on it, I’d get distracted again. My window of opportunity was closing. I wasn’t in high school anymore. Adult things like taxes and insurance were pressing down on me. The imminent loss of my freedom was closing in on all sides, making my brain claustrophobic. I knew if I didn’t get this done now, I’d be stuck waiting tables at the Golden CorralTM for the rest of my life. Everywhere I went, the smell of mac and cheese, cheap steak, and old people past their expiration date hung in a cursed miasma around me. 

Even after a decade of working there, I had never gotten used to that combo.

I needed professional help.

I gathered my courage, and responded to the ad.

I got confirmation of the contract, and was asked what I wanted my weekly goal to be. I took a while to settle on a number. I had to make it a reasonable one, that’s just good goal setting. Third letter in SMART: attainable. I decided 10 pages was a good amount to start with. 

At the time, I thought it was odd that the “hit man” didn’t ask me my address or phone number. But I didn’t question it too much. He was the expert here, not me.

I sent off the email, and a bubble of nervous gas knotted itself in my lower intestine. Anxiety cramps. I drank some pepto and tried to relax. I reminded myself I wasn’t doing anything dangerous. I was just getting my ass into high gear.

I was going to be fine.

That first week, I was motivated. I finished my 10 pages in three days. I sent them off to my “goal consultant” at midnight on Wednesday. I was triumphant, like Sir Gregor in the medieval portion of my musical-book when he had taken out a horde of space-zombies with iron age tech. The jazz saxophone solo was a lot of fun to write.

After a few minutes, I got a notification on my phone. A response email from my hit man.

It was a thumbs up emoji.

I relaxed. I didn’t even realize I was tense.

Looking back, I might have spent too much energy on that first week, because the next week was a lot slower. By the time Thursday rolled around, I only had about four pages.

That night, I was sitting at my computer, making weird noises with my mouth and pretending I was a professional drummer when I noticed something on my wall.

It was a small red dot.

It looked like it was some kind of laser pointer. It was weirdly steady, jiggling a bit here and there, almost like a little heartbeat. I stared at it for a long time, trying to figure out what it was. The anxiety cramps came back, bubbling in my gut like a dormant volcano.

I told myself it was some weird neighborhood kid playing with their new laser pointer. I went back to goofing off, even though pains in my lower stomach were growing sharper.

A minute later, the doorbell rang.

I went to get it, and on the doormat was an envelope. It was pristine and unmarked, which was weird. I picked it up, and shook it. It seemed to have only a piece of paper inside.

I opened it up, pulled out the paper, and read it.

“Three Days.”

It took a moment for me to get it. Was this a joke? Was the gas company mad at me again for not paying my bills three months in a row? Then I remembered the hit man I had hired. I almost laughed out loud. I had completely spaced. Whoever this guy was, he was good. I took the letter inside and went back to my computer. 

The red dot was a few inches closer to my screen than it had been before.

I started typing.

I finished my ten pages on Friday. Again, I was filled with feelings of victory. Just like Czar Bryan, the time-traveling Russian, when he saves Abraham Lincoln from a cyborg John Wilkes Booth. Another beloved scene from my book.

I sent in the pages to the hit man. The red dot was still on my wall. Still trembling with a strange regularity that made my chest clench up.

The response email arrived. Another thumbs up. 

When I looked back at the dot, it had disappeared.

I sighed, and my anxiety cramps went from an eight out of ten to a four.

I re-upped my subscription at the end of the month. It was hard to argue with the results. I had written more in a week than in the last two years combined. It was working.

Besides, a large part of me didn’t really think he was going to kill me. That would be illegal. In my moments of doubt, I told myself someone would stop him if it ever came to that.

But a small part of me wasn’t so sure.

The next two weeks, I met my goals no problem. I think it was because I had nailed the letter I had gotten to my wall. Every time I glanced over at it, I felt my fingers move faster on the keyboard. They shook with an eagerness I had never felt before.

I kinda loved the rush.

The next week, I ran into a bit of writer’s block. There was a romance scene between a reanimated George Washington and a sexed up Jimmy Carter that wasn’t coming together for me. It was a pivotal moment in my book, basically the climax, and I couldn’t move past it.

On Friday, I only had one page written.

That was when I started to get worried.

At first, I tried to fudge the system. I typed in a whole bunch of random words to make it *look* like I had written ten pages. When I pressed the send button, my stomach felt like it was full of knives. Two minutes later, the response email arrived. 

It had only two words:

“Nice try.”

I couldn’t fake my way out of this. I stayed up all that night at my computer, trying out every sort of idea in my head. I was blocked up, both in my gut and in my brain. By the time the sun rose the next morning, I still only had one page written. I had also downed an entire bottle of tums to try and soothe my stabbing stomach. It didn’t work.

I had limited writing time on Saturday since I was working a double at the Corral. I had bills to pay. There, I was desperate enough to ask my coworkers for help with the romance scene. The only “help” I got was Creepy Tommy pulling me into the bathroom to watch gay porn. 

I stayed until the end of the video so I wouldn’t hurt his feelings.

I was the last one left in the restaurant when it came time to close up. I was wiping throw-up off a table from an 80-year-old’s birthday party when I felt my gut suddenly seize up again. It was so bad, I bent double. As I tried to keep from adding to the vomit on the table, I felt my back tingle, little ripples and spasms that made me shiver all over.

Someone was watching me.

I turned around slowly, holding my stomach.

My hit man was standing at the door.

My heart stopped. He was tall, and large in an almost fake looking way. He was so still, it was easy to think he was actually made of plastic. His body rippled with muscles in a way that was grotesque and unreal. Like pulsing animals underneath his skin. His face looked exactly like his profile picture. Piggy eyes. A soft chin. The small smile, so knowing, so…unnerving. I felt vomit rise to the back of my throat again. The streetlamp cast a sharp glare off his bald head that hurt my eyes. My knees went slack, and I braced myself against the table. I felt my hand touch throw-up, but I didn’t care. I tried to control my breathing, but it was like trying to stop a runaway train with one hand. Pointless.

My hit man stared at me for a long time. He didn’t blink. He didn’t flinch. I wanted to cry.

He moved, and I jumped about ten feet in the air. I also pissed my pants. After my body was done spazzing, I realized he wasn’t trying to attack me. He had only moved one of his arms in front of him, his pointer finger sticking up towards the sky, straight and still.

He mouthed something I couldn’t hear through the glass. I tried to read his lips. It took a few seconds.

“One day.”

He said it three times. He smiled a little wider. Then he turned around and walked into the night.

I didn’t even finish cleaning up. I ran out the door, got into my car, and went home as fast as I could. I almost crashed three times. Eventually, I pulled into my parking spot, leapt out, and sprinted to the front door.

I fumbled with the keys for a moment. Every second counted, and my sausage fingers were wasting them. After a bit of effort, I got the tumblers to turn, and I slammed open the door. I got inside, locked it, and pounded upstairs to my computer. I booted it up, not even taking time to change my pants.

I started writing.

I tried, I really did. By the time Sunday morning came around, I had three pages. I had broken down and used some of the stuff Creepy Tommy showed me, but I had to delete it. It didn’t feel right for Jimmy Carter to say things like that, sexed up or not. At one point I got so desperate, I called the police. But they stopped talking to me the minute I mentioned my contract. Thought it was some kind of practical joke.

Also, I might have spent a bit too much time describing my book. I couldn’t help it, I needed to practice my elevator pitch.

I barricaded myself in my room. I locked the doors, put stuff up on the windows. Anything to buy me time. I watched youtube videos about writer’s block while I worked. When that didn’t help, I switched to romcoms. At one point, I was watching three different films all at once at two-times speed. I was also blasting the audiobook of *A Court of Thorns and Roses* on a portable speaker.

The hours ticked by. 

When it was two hours to midnight, I had my breakthrough. Halfway through Jerry Maguire.

It was so simple! The scene needed Tom Cruise, and it needed him bad. The third member of the throuple. The person who ties them all together.

I went to the page and started typing. 

An hour passed. One hour to midnight.

I was at five pages. I did the math in my head and knew that I had to type faster. I focused on the story, not the smaller mistakes. As I typed, I let the typos build up to a pile the size of a mountain. Every thought I had I put on the page. I let myself go onto tangents, explain things in long and circuitous ways. I could fix that in revision. And it wasn’t half bad if I say so myself. 

Half an hour to midnight. Seven pages.

As I typed, I heard something shift behind me. Was something in my closet? For a moment, I paused. Then I got back to work. I didn’t have time to check. I kept writing. I stretched out a conversation about what date the three were going to go on just so it could buy me another page.

Ten minutes. Nine pages.

I heard another noise behind me. I knew I shouldn’t have looked. I *knew* I should have ignored it. 

But I ended up wasting thirty seconds of my precious time to glance behind me.

At first, I didn’t see anything. My room was empty, illuminated by my desk lamp with a strangely flat orange light. Then, I caught a flash from a dark corner.

I saw him.

He was peeking out of the closet. A sliver of his face was visible, that same half-smile pulling on his cheeks. Was his smile wider now? The door pushed open at a snail’s pace, and there he was. He emerged from the closet like some biblical giant, shoulders hunched and head bent so as not to brush the ceiling. My heart froze. He had gotten taller. He saw me staring at him, and his teeth became visible as his lips pulled back. His mouth was so terrifying, it took a while for me to realize that he was not bearing his incisors at me like a wild animal.

He was grinning.

My heart was flushed with adrenaline and I pushed onward. I didn’t want to die. *I didn’t want to die.* I wrote and wrote and wrote. So many typos. So many lines of cheesy dialogue. I might have even plagiarized lines from *50 First Dates*. Adam Sandler was with me, even in the face of death.

Five minutes, a little more than half a page left. 

With each minute I could feel the thud of my hit man’s footsteps as he took another step towards me. I instinctively looked backward, and saw he had nothing in his hands. That didn’t make me feel better. My imagination grew wild with all he could do to me with those positively huge hands with his strangely long fingers. The digits were tensed, ready to grab, to smash, to do something horrible to me that would leave me broken and mangled on the floor. I saw it all and knew it would happen to me with the certainty of a prophet.

I typed furiously, my fingers aching with the effort. 

Half a page. A quarter. An eighth.

The hit man continued to advance.

I slammed my index finger on the period button. Done.

One minute to midnight. Ten pages.

I took a breath. I had finished. I turned to face the hit man. He raised his eyebrows slightly at me, still grinning.

A horrifying realization hit me.

I still had to send the email.

My fingers slid along the buttons like I was drunk. Twenty seconds left. I dragged the wrong file. I didn’t even try to delete it, I just kept dragging until the correct one fell into place. Ten seconds. I typed in the hit man’s email address, and I felt his breath on my neck. It was hot. It burned. Sweat poured down my nose.

Five seconds. I missed the send button on my first click.

Two seconds. I lined up my mouse with the paper airplane.

One.

I hit send, and backed away from the computer. I huddled in the corner, staring at the hit man, my arms held out protectively in front of me. The hit man stared back, still grinning, his arms held slightly forward and his fingers crooked in midair, reaching towards me.

A buzz came from his pocket.

He reached in his pocket and pulled out a phone. His grin faded back to a smile. He scrolled for a moment.

I didn’t move. For ten minutes I watched him read.

Finally, he looked up at me, I could see his brow crease down.

I held my breath.

He raised his hand, and I closed my eyes. When I didn’t feel him throttling me, I peeked out of my closed lids.

His fingers were pulled into a fist, and his thumb was pointed straight into the air.

A thumbs up.

I threw up. All over the carpet. What felt like a full knife block was rolling around in my stomach. I was vaguely aware of the hit man leaving the room, and closing the door with a click.

His footsteps were so soft.

That was the last straw. I couldn’t handle it anymore after that. I sent an email letting him know I was cancelling the subscription and his services would not be required. I hoped he would understand. I didn’t get anything back.

I laid in bed for three days. At least, I think I did. I’m not sure, I kind of blacked out a bit.

It’s been a week, and I’ve started to regain my bearings. I don’t jump at every small noise anymore. I do find myself looking over at my closet a lot. Sometimes, I think I see eyes peeking in at me. But every time I’d go check, nothing’s there.

It’s Sunday again. I got an old notification from my phone telling me to submit my ten pages. A part of me wants to stay up and write, just to be safe.

But I’m just paranoid. I need a bit more rest and I’ll be back to hbg;lyadfsopkdfjnchtygvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgv
