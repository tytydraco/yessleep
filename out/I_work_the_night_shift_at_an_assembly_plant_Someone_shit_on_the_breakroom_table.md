I only had fifteen minutes to go when the intercom chimed overhead, the distraught and obviously frustrated voice echoed across long dusty aisles.   
  
“All employees report to the supervisor’s office. *Now*.”  
  
The final tone made me uneasy, like I was getting sent to the principal’s office. I checked the time on my phone. So preciously close to leaving, and now this. I wheeled my cart over to the nearest rack and started walking in the direction of the supervisor’s office, in the center of the plant.  
  
I work at an assembly factory. Portable and industrial compressors. I’m a “material handler” as they call the position, which is a fancy way of saying scramble around to find parts that aren’t where they’re supposed to be, and chase down where they actually are to deliver them to their proper spot. A repeating cycle of hell, honestly. Except with air compressors.  
  
“Ayyyy girl, aren’t you supposed to be gone by now?” I heard the unmistakable voice of Hot Tuna, and heard him jogging up behind me.  
  
We call him Hot Tuna because he’s always microwaving tuna and broccoli on lunch.  
  
“Hey HT. Yeah, less than fifteen minutes.” I said, as he matched my pace. He was a big guy, huge into weights and carb-cutting. He ran the test cell on the shift, mostly machines that were backlogged due to leaks or faulty wiring. Although he must’ve been hiding somewhere on his phone away from the cameras, because he clearly wasn’t in his work area.  
  
“Always something stupid with this place, I swear.” He said as we came to an intersection in the racks and turned left.   
  
We were a skeleton crew on night shift, a slow expansion due to the company’s recent boom in business. Something about a partner company blowing up, blah blah. There were four of us in total on the shift—three grunts and a supervisor.   
  
“Sounds like somebody fucked up, bad.” HT said, his phone going off. He dug it out and started clicking away at a text, nearly bumping into a palette jutting out from the second shelf. The place was a mess.  
  
“Yeah, just a shame I couldn’t escape first.” I groaned, wishing I was on my way to the time clock. I was thinking of my date night, and the four hours of PTO I put in to be able to make it. Of course, of all days for an “emergency” meeting.  
  
“He must’ve been hawking the cameras again, maybe it was—” HT was cut off by what sounded like a dog barking through the vocal cords of a human. Part Timer.  
  
We call him Part Timer because he calls off work once a week, almost every week. He works in assembly, and is probably on his way out.  
  
“What did you fuckers do now? I’m sure it’s something I didn’t do,” PT joked, making another grotesque dog noise before addressing us, “wattup HT. Big Water.”  
  
They call me Big Water because I always have a giant water bottle. It’s a 1.75 liter. I cut caffeine two weeks ago, and have been drowning my sorrows in H20 since. It’s not really helping, I’m miserable. My name is the only one that doesn’t get abbreviated, nobody knows why, but its funny.  
  
“Part Time. What did you do now?” HT clapped him on the shoulder, the way a bear would bully a small child.  
  
“Hey, I made it in today. At least.” PT coughed as we weaved through a line of unfinished machines, large portables with their guts exposed. He chuckled shamefully, and we laughed.  
  
“Let’s hurry up and get this done so Big Water can get out of here. She’s got PTO.” HT said, motioning for the door.  
  
“You’re leaving early? When?” He gasped, scowling.  
  
“Seven.” I grinned.  
  
“Oh, fuck you.” PT rolled his eyes.  
  
“At least I earned the time.” I shrugged.  
  
“Fair.”  
  
Beyond the machines was a little dusty shanty, an “office” erected in the middle of two different assembly lines. Seeing it made me feel nervous. There was no shortage of the usual antics in the shop, but the tone on the intercom. Somebody fucked up. Pretty bad from the sounds of it.  
  
The little shanty felt oppressive as we drew near, and I could feel the atmospheric oppression of someone higher on the totem pole. It was a uniquely dangerous vibe, especially for a non-union shop.  
  
“All right. Let’s see what Piss Baby wants, and get you on your way.” HT chuckled, reaching for the door.  
  
We call him Piss Baby, because he’s the supervisor.  
  
HT opened the door and held it for us, probably so he could tower innocently behind us. As the three of us filed in, I felt like I was back in high-school, awaiting a broad scolding because someone placed a tactful whoopie-cushion, or wouldn’t stop handing gum out in class. It felt simultaneously sweaty and trivial.  
  
PB sat at one of the three desks in the little “office”, obviously furious, and sweating. His eyes reflected the plethora of cameras from his screen, his eye balls flicking from one to another, like he’d catch something as we walked in. HT was the first to pipe up.  
  
“Hey boss, what’s up—” The cutoff was swift and angry.  
  
“All I can say is: Are you fucking kidding me? I like to think I run a pretty loose leash—I’m cool with most of the shit I have to put up with— but *this?* I don’t even know where to begin. I don’t even know— who in their right mind? To pull this shit. The blatant disrespect, I-I can’t even believe it. The atrocity, to do something like this. Why? *Why?* If I find out *who*, you’ll be on the unemployment line faster than, faster than— as if the vandalism in the fences, and the ripped up roadkill wasn’t enough. You had to do this? Who did it?” he turned to us, out of breath, flustered.  
  
A coyote, or something like it, had been burrowing under the fence that surrounded the property. It seemed to be happening at night, when there were way less people around. Not to mention the roadkill carcasses left around company grounds, that seemed like they had been… *played with* before leaving them as a present.  
  
“What’s going on here?” I asked, trying to be a voice of reason. PB scoffed and started clicking with his mouse, focusing and enlarging one specific camera angle, then zooming in, all on a live feed of footage.  
  
“He’s good with the cameras, that’s why they hired him.” PT muttered under his breath.  
  
“This. This! Does anyone want to explain themselves? Anyone want to ‘shine a light’ on this depravity?” PB was irate, pointing to the screen that we all started to hone in on.  
  
The little flatscreen showed the layout of the breakroom through the window of a camera stationed above one of the lines, zoomed in on a specific table top.  
  
On top of the table, was a pile of what could only be described as… shit.  
  
PB continued, spittle flying from everything syllable.  
  
“I go to get some coffee— just some coffee, and what do I find? Shit. I found that someone, one of our employees, has *shit* on the table. A human being. On a place people eat, for god’s sake. Why?!” He leaned back in his chair, exhausted.  
  
We all looked at each other, then without a word, HT leaned in and eyed it seriously.  
  
“Hmm. Yeah, that’s definitely not me. If it was me, it would’ve been bigger. Much bigger, probably.”  
  
“This isn’t a fucking joke. I had half a mind to call corporate tonight. Just imagine how that would turn out. We’d all be fired.” PB fumed.  
  
“Wait, you don’t think one of us *actually* did that, do you?” I asked, unable to look away from the mess through the camera’s feed on the monitor. The more I looked at it, the nastier it got. Clearly someone was having a hard time properly digesting.  
  
“Surely there has to be… uh… some kind of explanation.” PT said, scratching his head, a stupid smile on his face. I wondered for a moment if it was him, but the more I looked at the pile, the less it looked human. It almost looked like there were bones in it.  
  
“This isn’t funny.” PB warned. HT shrugged. The three of us looked at each other, probably conjuring the mental image of someone going through the trouble to squat on the table.  
  
“Look, I have PTO that starts in like, less than ten minutes. Can you just cut to the chase and tell us who did it? I’m sure you looked at the cameras.”  
  
“That’s the problem. Whoever did it, toyed with the footage. It gets all distorted. Someone fucked with it. I don’t know which one of you did it—maybe its all of you.” He looked at us one by one, his face flustered. It looked like smoke would billow from his ears at any moment.  
  
“Well that’s obvious. A ghost did it.” PT said, chewing his lip. Right before he burst into laughter. HT only lasted two seconds before he joined in. Funny as it was, I couldn’t help but look at the clock. *Eight minutes.* I still had to wash my hands, and walk to the time clock.  
  
“I should fire you both.” PB seethed.  
  
“If you fire them both, you’ll be stuck cleaning it up. I’m out of here for the night.” I tapped my wrist where a watch would’ve been, had I worn one.  
  
PB groaned. I made my way to the door of the little shanty.  
  
“*Look*. I don’t have any evidence either of you did this, *but I know one of you did*. I don’t know how you pulled it off, but you did. Ha-ha. All I ask, if you guys get this shit cleaned up in time for day-”  
  
HT and PT chuckled, and PB stood from his desk, momentarily halting the amusement.  
  
“I’m serious. Get this—mess, cleaned up. And since she’s leaving, it’s up to you two. If you clean it up, I’ll let it slide. But. If I somehow find *how* one of you did this, I’m firing the hell out of you. Even you, Janice.”  
  
I felt myself freeze at the door, my hand hanging just inches from the knob. PT coughed, and cleared his throat.  
  
“Uh, her name is Big Water.”   
  
It took everything in me not to snort.  
  
“Clean the mess up. Now.” The supervisor seemed at his breaking point, and I could hear the other two filing out behind me.  
  
Hot Tuna and Part Timer followed me out of the supervisor’s office, barely containing themselves. By the time we weaved back into the part racks they burst into laughter, a depraved cackling that echoed for rows of dusty stock. Something Piss Baby surely heard.  
  
“Oh my god. That’s good, that’s so good.” PT wheezed.  
  
“Dude, my fucking sides. His face—please tell me you saw his face. Man. Don’t even care if I get fired.” HT said.  
  
“Does that mean you shit the table?” I asked.  
  
More deranged laughter, the I-wanna-go-home-and-not-be-here-kind.  
  
“Like I said, it would be bigger.” HT shrugged.  
  
“I don’t even think with my wonderful diet of alcohol and pills I could produce whatever was on that table. He’s either fucking with us, or it was you.” PT said, before stopping and looking at me.  
  
HT stopped as well, suppressing what looked like another booming laugh.  
  
“Stop. The only thing I had backed up in me was the urge to get the fuck out of here.” They looked at each other, and promptly died.  
  
Jokes aside, we made our way to the locker rooms, and sadly for the other two, the janitorial closet. Neither of us really addressed who was behind the monstrous “shit” in the breakroom, nor did we seem to want to talk about it. It was apparent HT and PT were going to clean it, but there was an unsaid disturbance underneath all of it; whether someone didn’t want to mop someone else’s shit or their own, or simply just questioning how a shitty job had gotten them this far. Or why they’d compliantly clean it.  
  
Hot Tuna had a baby on the way, and was currently trying to soak up whatever overtime he could get outside the skeleton shift.  
  
Part Timer had mentioned in passing that he had trouble holding a job for long, and was trying to make right by his girlfriend to fend off some of his building debt.  
  
We parted ways, and selfishly I ducked into the women’s locker room, ready to get changed and out of there for the night. I changed quickly, feeling the agonizing fly of time at work against my precious minutes outside of it. Despite the laughs of the current “vandalization” on the company property, there was something unsettling about the whole ordeal.  
  
Someone shitting on the table was funny. But the fact that nobody knew what was going on, or at least pretended not to, was equally fucked up. I chalked it up to laughs being laughs, but as I left the women’s locker room, I couldn’t help but feel sick at the thought of it.   
  
My last memory of Hot Tuna and Part Timer was watching them wheel the mop bucket reluctantly towards the break room as I passed them to the time clock. They snickered and sneered as I left in good fun, but when I got a chance to actually see the sight for myself, it carried the weight of a punch to the stomach.  
  
The closest table to the door of the break room had been absolutely covered in what could only be described as ‘shit’, but that was almost putting it lightly. There was something more to the collected mass on the table—something sinister lurking within the waste. In my brief time passing the view of the collected rectal purge, I couldn't help but notice the signs of jagged bone jutting through the waste. Or the sickly runoff of blood that secreted through the pile.  
  
“Take it easy, Big Water.” HT said.  
  
“Yeah, have one for us.” PT added.  
  
I returned the courtesy and said that I would and that they should too, but as I swiped my time card and hurried across the parking lot, I couldn’t help but forget about the event altogether.  
  
Work seems grueling and important while you’re present, but once you left the premises—or more importantly get to your car, the world you leave behind ceases to exist. I don’t mean that heartlessly— it’s the same for me as it is for everyone else.  
  
So I hurried home. Showered and changed into something nice, and applied makeup while thinking of a good glass of wine and the hours of monotonous labor I would luckily be missing out on. The hours you wished more than anything you could skip, despite how fun the banter was.  
  
I was at dinner when the texts started to come in. I glanced at the first one, barely registering the words before locking my phone. The waiter was approaching with the food, and I wanted to place myself as far away from the working life as I could. Even as the table was set with a nice seared steak and fingerling potatoes, I couldn’t help but think of the text as it played through my mind.  
  
\-Looks like PT left too? Haven’t seen him in-  
  
The text was from Hot Tuna, but I canceled it out just the same. Readying my knife and fork, I assumed he had decided to leave after having to clean up the unexplainable mess. I didn’t blame him, but I was surprised HT went through the effort to text me. It was something that happened quite regularly, aside from the nights where there was a discovered shit in the break room.  
  
I put my phone on silent, and continued the night like any other.  
  
The wine was starting to get to me and I began to forget about my phone, as well as anything else that faded outside of my night out. The phone continued to vibrate and I continued to ignore it, deciding whatever it was it could wait until morning. By the time I was on my third glass I forgot I had a phone entirely, until my SO reminded me I left it on the table as we were about to leave.  
  
The rest of my night moved in a smooth and sultry blur, one away from the chained anxiety of finishing a shift and watching the clock.   
  
  
When I awoke, I saw the building on fire.  
  
Not in person, but on the news. The erratic and inexperienced sprawl of a local news team handling a camera while the fire department put it out, my hungover brain trying to make sense of the heavy spray of a hose that blasted the plant from a safe distance. My mind jumbled half-forgotten memories of the night before, and while I watched the local news report, I couldn’t help but feel for my phone.  
  
I had several missed calls, as well as a number of unnoticed text messages.  
  
The first was from Hot Tuna, one I vaguely recall seeing a glimpse of.  
  
\-Looks like PT left too? Haven’t seen him since we cleaned the mess. There was a scream on the other side of the plant, and he ran off when I went to find the Piss.-  
  
His other messages were rushed—fucked up compared to watch he usually texted.  
  
\-Theres no one here, someone shut the lights off, I’m trying to find PB. You guys organize this?-  
  
I felt a sickening feeling in my gut, seeing that as his last message. The next string of notifications being from PT.  
  
\-Fuck you for leaving early, drink a bottle of wine for me-  
  
\-Whoever made this shit ate roadkill and eggs, are you sure it wasn’t you-  
  
\-Gonna need to shower after we mopped that, it was D-Day up in there-  
  
\-Tuna is missing. Someone shut off the lights, and I’m lurking on the portable line. This place is a dump-  
  
\-Seriously, no fire department or anything, this place is tr-  
  
I frantically scrolled through PT’s texts, to find the abrupt end.  
  
There was a string from my mom, but I ignored it after seeing the odd texts from PB. An attachment that was still loading with several texts behind it.  
  
\-Just tell me who shit on the table, and I’ll save your job. You’re better than the others. Enough games. It’s impressive, I’ll give them that. But I won’t stand for it.-  
  
\-They’re playing hard to get but I know it’s one of them. Don’t leave me hanging here. You could maybe even get that office job you talked about.-  
  
\-The lights are off. I don’t know what you guys did, knock this shit off.-  
  
\-I can see it. Out of the corner of my eye, I can see it-  
  
The image buffered and I clicked on it, and my mind tried to make sense of the shape shown within the camera’s blur. Whatever it was—it had been moving fast, fast enough to barely register the security cameras. Like a glimpse frozen between digital time and space.  
  
Caught in the frozen still, was the image of something crouching atop the break room table. Bowed legs— two human and two canine, flexed as bloody shit rained down on the table below it. Even in the blurry picture, it looked pained—angry. Amongst the strange limbs was a cluster of faces atop its shoulders, all of them looking in different directions, unable to hold the focus of the camera. A split face of a man with a woman on either side, a look of agony splayed across their faces. Protruding between the two was the gnarled snout of a dog or something like it, its teeth bared angrily, saliva trailing across them.  
  
He did say he was really good with cameras.
