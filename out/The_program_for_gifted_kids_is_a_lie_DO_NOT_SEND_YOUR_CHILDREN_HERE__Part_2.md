The doll looked disturbingly realistic. Its rubber head had a massive dent on it and the cloth connecting the fake hands and feet had torn in half from the impact. The glass bottle that had been inside it had shattered in dangerous little pinpricks and the jam had made a sticky mess of the floor. It looked like cherry jam and pieces of digested flesh.  
Two hands settled on my shoulders, gently turning me away from the sight. It was Mr. Charles. He grinned down at me with a row of perfectly white and definitely false teeth. On closer inspection, the doll looked more human than he did. Its eyes had more life in them.  
“Please, remain calm. This is just a training dummy that fell from the roof because of the wind. You’ll be cracking these things open like soda bottles starting tomorrow.”  
The same janitor from before walked calmly outside, still in his gloves and mask. Mr. Charles grabbed my arm and held it up, forcing me to wave at them.  
“I’m sure the janitor will make the place spotless again. How about we thank him for doing his job so well?”  
“Thank you,” I said stiffly.   
Mr. Charles nodded, releasing me from his grasp. He picked up the doll’s head by its hair and gave it a little shake. It rattled like it had something stuffed in its skull. Then he proceeded to throw it in the garbage can with more force than he had to.  
I swallowed.  
I practically fled back inside, pushing past the revolving doors into the warm hallway where the other program attendees had gathered and were lively discussing what exactly he’d meant by that. There was a complete sort of lack of concern that in itself was concerning to me. Did nobody think that the dummy had been a purposeful joke in bad taste? Or was I just being weirdly paranoid?  
My skin crawled and there was that itch again. The sweater was just too thick to wear in the heated rooms and I was drenched. At that point I must’ve smelled like a used sock and even my hair was damp.  
I wiped my forehead. My vision blurred slightly and all the voices was starting to fade in a consistent buzz in my left ear. I squeezed my eyes shut and counted to five, pinching my cheeks. It helped to steady me slightly, but it also made me aware of how thirsty I was. Was there water nearby?  
I looked around, trying to find a cooler. Instead, towards the end of the corridor, was a pink vending machine, filled with candy and drinks.   
Nice. I could get some skittles while I was at it.  
I had crossed half the length towards it, when a loud whistle stopped me. Mr. Charles was standing above us, Morty and the other unnamed guard on each side like the muscle in a mobster movie. “Please gather so I can assign you your rooms. The schedule will be posted by dinner time, until then, you’re free to go anywhere you want, the pool, the computer room, the library are all open. But you mustn’t leave the building for any reason. A snowstorm is coming and the doors are locked.”  
A hand shot up. The bleeding guy again was itching to be noticed. I had reluctantly joined the group by then, waiting for him to finish talking. I wanted to throw my hands to the air in frustration. I wanted to make him bleed for real.  
“Will the storm affect the internet?”  
“No. Here we store very important machines, so our connections are very secure. There’s nothing to fear, unless there is an ax murderer on the loose.” He laughed. “But that’s what Morty and Billy are here for.”  
So his name was Billy. Good to know.   
They lined us up and he handed each of us one of these little colored cards, which looked almost like military dog tags. They were tied around a thin chain meant to go around the neck as a necklace. Mine was a silvery gray and I was surprised at the weight of it. It was heavy, metallic and not at all plastic as I’d assumed.  
It had my name, the number #44 and a QR code engraved on it. They were thin and small and surprisingly sharp, almost like tiny practical shanks.  
“These will function as your IDs. You must wear them at all times, even when you are sleeping. If you lose them, contact one of the guards immediately. The number on them is your room and the code is the key to every door you’re allowed to go through. Now, if you scan the code with your phones, you’ll get your profile, your test scores and most importantly, your points. You’ll earn these points if you solve 90% or higher on any given test. And with these points you can use the vending machines all around the building or the arcade on the second floor. There is, of course, the VR machine, for which you’ll need 100 points to use for an hour. Is everything clear?”  
For the first time, I was the one to raise my hand. “How many points is one test worth?”  
“Depends on the test. Most only 5 points.”  
“But that will take forever!” Someone whined. One of the twins, I think.  
“There will be many many tests and a lot of opportunity to move forward in the ranking.”  
The atmosphere shifted slightly. Eyes scanned around, whispers were covered under coughs and he’d just said the magic word. Ranking. Competition. Every single person was on honors roll or on top of their school; we were all gifted. We were the future doctors, lawyers, CEOs, CFOs, CTOs, C whatever Os.  
*Maybe*, I thought grimly, *some of us will crash and burn in college*.  
“There’s a ranking?” Another asked sheepishly. The bug girl.  
“Yes. All the points will be recorded and put on a statistic board. It’s all part of the experiment. Who is ready to unpack?”  
He didn’t wait for a response and simply began to walk away. We followed. Dimly, I remembered he’d said we were free to go wherever we wanted, but the headache had only gotten worse. My mouth was dry and tasted foul from the leftover tea.  
Where had I put the cup after I had finished it?  
I played with the card, rubbing my thumb over the edges as we toured the different areas. Mr. Charles’ talked in a monotone, whirring voice, so boring and incomprehensible that I could only guess what he was talking about.   
There were paintings on the glass walls, classic and modern art. We must’ve passed a thousand different renditions of Kronos eating his children, some so large they replaced entire doors, others tiny and hanged on random spots. A few of them seemed to shimmer like they were underwater, others moved their heads to watch with horrible eyes.  
The modern art was somehow worse. Random scribbles on a canvas, or straight up on the wall. Curse words and ravings and quotes were left on the floors absent mindedly, like they’d been too lazy to cover them up with a carpet. That’s another thing I noticed. There wasn’t a single carpet in the building, anywhere. Just marble, tiles and wooden floors.   
**GET OUT! GET OUT!**   
**HELP**  
All had been written in yellow markers in a weirdly Russian cursive.  
I only realized we had reached my room when I saw my luggage by the door.   
By then, I was minutes away from passing out and all I wanted was to curl up and take a nap. A strong wave of relief washed over me when I remembered I had a small bag of snacks and a Pepsi hidden away on my sports bag.   
The key wasn’t hard to use. All I had to do hold it to the scanner under the handle and the lock clicked open. It gave out three melodical chimes and I could see the insides for the first time.   
It was a neat and tiny room, in muted grays and navy blues. There was a closet on the left and a bed on the right, separated by a long desk that had a potted plant on top of it and a bin on the bottom. A stack of books had been left in a pile of unopened stationary.   
It looked… eerily similar to my bedroom back home. Even the ceiling seemed to have the same uneven tint that dad had messed up when he’d repainted the house. The only difference was the massive window in front of me, that replaced that entire wall. The only thing I could see out of it was heavy snowfall and the rocky side of the mountain.  
It made sense they’d named this place Glass Glacier. Most of the building was glass and glaciers are made of ice, of which there was plenty so high up. Still, a glacier is a large, perennial accumulation of crystalline ice, snow, rock, sediment, and often liquid water that originates on land and moves down slope under the influence of its own weight and gravity. Wouldn’t that mean the building could just slide off? Seemed like bad luck.  
I sat on the made bed, zipping open the luggage. I’d left the sport bag on top, so the weight of the clothes wouldn’t crush the chips into dust. I’d snuck in all the bag would hold: four full sized snicker bars, a ten-piece pack of twinkies, a bag of limited Christmas edition mini marshmallows, three bags of coca cola gummies, three bags of berry skittles, a box of sour patch kids, two bags of lays salt chips and of course, a Pepsi to wash it down with.   
My actual sport clothes had been folded in with everything else.  
I gulped down half the can in one go, only stopping when it started to spill. The fizz burned on the way down, but it was cold and made me feel a lot better instantly. I wiped the sweat off my forehead.   
I stayed still for a moment, taking deep breath. The crisis had passed. The day was mostly over.  
“Okay, Alice,” I said out loud to myself. “Let’s put ourselves back together. One, two, three, four…”  
I counted as I got back up, digging my feet against the floor and moved my upper torso from left to right.   
*One, Two. Left, Right. Left, Right. Left, Right.*  
*I got this. I got this. I got this. You got this.*  
I put the can down on the desk and emptied the luggage on the bed. I’d packed light, taking not just the essentials but also clothes that were compatible with each other. There must be a washing machine somewhere in the building, maybe we’d even passed by it. There were around twenty students and ten adults from what I counted, and the place was simply too large not to have a designated place for laundry. And showers.   
I pulled out the little notebook from my pocket. It was still something I was trying to make a habit out of, so I’d completely forgotten about it.   
*To do:*   
*Find laundry room.*  
*Find shower*.   
I peeled the sweaty turtleneck off of me, feeling immediately ten pounds lighter. Somewhere on the pile was a deodorant and a pack of wet wipes, so I took them and cleaned the best I could. Now if I could find where I put the…  
Something slammed against the window.  
It startled the hell out of me and I let out a short yelp of surprise. I tightened my grip against the bottle of perfume, looking towards the massive window where the sound had come from.  
A round splat of blood was dripping from the outside, a small feather still glued to the spot of impact. Some bird had-  
Another bird hit the glass.  
“What the fuck?!”  
The view was indescribable. The snow had picked up and was moving sideways in a flurry of sharp ice. Hail began to hammer incessantly against the building, sending another wave of anxiety down my spine. Just how sturdy was the building exactly?  
Another bird hit the glass. Then another. Then another. Soon there was a new storm, all dying on her window. And they were getting bigger. Bam! Bam! BAM!  
The biggest one hit its head with such force that I felt the rumble shake beneath my feet. There was the sound of breaking glass and I let out a screech, waiting for the window to come down on me, hands raised high.   
It didn’t come down. It wasn’t until I felt the strong scent of peaches that I realized that it wasn’t the window that had cracked. The bottle of perfume had slipped from my hands and landed harshly on the floorboards, breaking into a thousand tiny shards.  
The window was just washed in red at that point.  
I need to clean this up.  
A bucket. I needed a bucket and a rag and maybe some Windex. My stomach began to churn from the smell. It was so strong that the chemicals were digging into my nose and taking bites out of it.  
I rushed out, holding the tag in my palm, afraid to let it go.  
Cleaning supplies. Cleaning supplies. Where do I get cleaning supplies?  
The place looked completely different than it had only few minutes ago. The hallways were bare, with little decoration, lit by bright lights that were installed down on the edges of large window panels.   
\#42, #41, #40. Pool. Botany Class. Toxicology Class. Biochemistry Class. Bioinformatics Class. Pool. Toxicology Class. Botany Class. Bioinformatics Class. #40, #41, #42. Pool again.  
*Am I going in circles?*  
I closed my eyes, then walked straight ahead until I hit a wall. Left, or right? Do I go left or right?  
Somewhere, my mom had read that if you hold your left hand against a wall on a maze and follow that wall, eventually, you’ll get out. It was worth a try, at least.  
Yellow Room. Blue Room. Red Room. Laboratory #2. Security Office. Sanitary Supply Closet!  
The door slid open with a satisfying hush. It was equipped with solutions of every color, in spray bottles, insulated or collapsible. It also had about twenty buckets and so many rags they could make blankets for everyone out of them. I grabbed all I needed, including something that looked close enough to Windex and rushed back to the room.   
It smelled fucking awful. The moment I opened the door it hit me like a brick to the face. There’d been about three-fourths of the perfume left and cracking it open had not been a good idea, no matter how pleasant the scent was supposed to be. A slice of cake is pleasant too, but you wouldn’t want the whole cake shoved up your nostrils either.  
I carefully avoided the mess and dug through the clothes’ pile to find a scarf to cover my face with. My eyes were starting to water. And I needed to open the window.   
It was still bloody and it would probably get inside but I had no choice. If I opened the door, someone could come in to ask about what had happened, and I couldn’t handle it at the moment. There was something in the back of my head, on the back of my throat, itching, but I just couldn’t understand why. I didn’t know why I didn’t want them to know, but I just did.  
Cold air rushed in. The wind wheezed violently, but that was for the best. It would make the process faster.  
I went down on my knees and began to pick out the big pieces first, tossing them in the bucket. Then the tiny ones. Then the shards I could see.  
I poured some of the bluish liquid on top before giving it a good run with a rag. I moved in circular motions, carefully but firmly. When it looked dry enough, I wrangled the cloth over the bucket. It came out stained with blood.  
I let out a small frustrated sigh, opening my hands to see where the glass had cut through skin. But there wasn’t any. I was still holding the key tag and its corners had made a perfect outline of its shape on my left palm. How long had I been holding it like this? Had I left bloody fingerprints all over the hallway wall? There were marks where I’d handled the bucket… that I hadn’t seen before.  
“It doesn’t matter,” I whispered. I needed a drink.  
My legs were wobbly, but I made it to the desk in one piece. I finished the now flat soda in another long gulp, then burped loudly. “Everything is going to be okay. It’s just a little cut. It’ll heal. It’s just a perfume. I’ll get a new one. A body mist. With all natural ingredients. That’s right.”  
I began to count again. The clothes still needed to be hung up on the closet. I’d put them away and I’d put the bucket back into its place and I’d get some sleep.   
“Yeah” I said to the empty room. “Yeah, that’s exactly what I’ll do. Great plan, Alice.”  
First sorting out what is what. Undershirts and underwear would go on the first drawer. Socks on the second. Sweaters over the shirts, pants hung up, leggings folded. Hat I would put with the socks. Big coat gets its own special hanger. PJs I would wear immediately. Dirty clothes I would put in the third drawer until I found the laundry machine.  
I walked over to closet, opening the door. A headless corpse just fell out.  
It just fell out, shattering on the floor. Its guts cracked open like they were tanghulu of human flesh. And it got all over the place with a stench of complete rot. It had no blood though. It had reached a state where it was just food for mold and maggots that wormed their way out of their crystallized caverns.  
“FOR THE LOVE OF FUCKING GOD, I JUST CLEANED IT!”  
I dove for the bucket, trying to visualize with my head if it was big enough to hold the thing in it. Probably not, but it didn’t matter.  
When I turned around, there was nothing. Nothing broken, nothing stained. And the windows. They were clean too. The snowstorm must’ve washed away the bloodbath. I sank to my knees a second time. Then I just laid on the floor, looking up at the ceiling.  
*Well, at least it scrubbed itself out.*
