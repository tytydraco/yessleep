It was a dark and rainy night. I was settled in for the evening, scrolling through my phone and trying to unwind after a long day. I had just finished up a long shift at work and was looking forward to a quiet night in, maybe catching up on some TV or reading a good book. But as I sat there in the comfortable glow of my living room, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

I couldn't quite put my finger on what was causing the sense of unease, but I couldn't shake it. It was like a sixth sense, a feeling that something was about to happen. And then, just as I was starting to get really freaked out, I heard a noise outside my window.

It was a faint sound at first, barely perceptible over the sound of the rain and the howling wind. But as I listened more closely, I realized that it was the sound of footsteps, approaching my window. My heart skipped a beat as I realized that someone was out there, walking up to my house in the dead of night.

I had no idea who it could be, or what they wanted. All I knew was that I was terrified, and I had to find out what was going on. So, with a trembling hand, I reached out and pulled back the curtains, peering out into the darkness.

At first, I couldn't see anything. It was pitch black outside, and the rain was coming down in sheets, making it nearly impossible to see more than a few feet in front of me. But then, as my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I saw a figure standing there, clad in a long, flowing black robe and wearing a creepy, featureless white mask.

I couldn't see their eyes through the slits in the mask, but I could feel their gaze upon me, as if they were staring right through me. It was a feeling of intense, almost palpable fear, like something was lurking just beyond the veil of reality, waiting to snatch me up and Roz]: carry me away to some unknown and terrifying place. I was frozen in place, too terrified to move or even speak. I could feel the blood pounding in my veins, my heart racing as I tried to make sense of what was happening.

Who was this figure, standing there in the rain and watching me through the window? What did they want from me? And why were they wearing that strange, unsettling mask? I had a million questions running through my head, but no answers.

I don't know how long we stood there, locked in that intense and terrifying gaze. It could have been seconds, or it could have been hours. All I knew was that I was trapped in that moment, unable to move or speak as the figure continued to watch me.

And then, just as suddenly as they had appeared, the figure turned and vanished into the night, disappearing into the darkness and the rain. I was left alone and shaken, my mind racing as I tried to understand what had just happened.

I never saw the figure again, but I still think about that night all the time. Who was that mysterious figure in the mask, and what did they want from me? I can't help but wonder if they were some kind of supernatural being, or just a deeply disturbed individual with a twisted sense of fun.

Either way, I don't think I'll ever forget the feeling of being watched by that eerie, faceless presence. I really hope it doesn’t come back…
