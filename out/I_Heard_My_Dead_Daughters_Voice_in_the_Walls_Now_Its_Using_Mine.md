They told me not to go back to the farmhouse. *“It’ll rot you, Paul,”* my brother warned, gripping my shoulder like he could physically trap me in his pity. But grief isn’t a thing you outrun—it’s a mouth, always hungry, and mine had been gnawing on my ribs since the day Lila’s tiny casket vanished into the ground. Six years old. Leukemia ate her like a slow, careless god. So I went back. To her room. To the peeling yellow wallpaper she’d covered in dinosaur stickers. To the silence.

The first night, I slept in my truck. The second, I dragged a mattress into the parlor, whiskey burning my throat as I stared at the water-stained ceiling. But on the third night, the house spoke.

*“Daddy?”*

I froze. That voice. *Her* voice. Faint, muffled, like it was trapped under layers of old wool. It came from upstairs. From the attic.

I don’t remember climbing the steps. I just remember the cold—a wet, living cold that clung to my skin as I shoved open the attic door. Moonlight cut through the filth-caked window, and there, in the center of the dust, was a single small handprint. Perfect. Delicate. Pressed into the frost on the glass.

“Lila?” I whispered.

The house creaked. Something skittered behind the walls.

It got worse.

Every night, her voice returned. *“Daddy, I’m scared,”* she’d whimper from the basement. *“Help me, please,”* she’d sob inside the closet. I tore the house apart. Ripped up floorboards with crowbars, smashed through plaster with my fists, my knuckles splitting, my breath ragged. The neighbors called me a ghost-chaser. A madman. But then Mrs. Harlow from down the road brought me casserole and heard it too—a giggle, high and bright, echoing from the empty fireplace. She dropped the dish and ran. Never came back.

I stopped sleeping. Started seeing things. Shadows that bent the wrong way. A flicker of pink—the same shade as Lila’s favorite dress—darting around corners. And the smell. God, the *smell*. Sweet and rotting, like apples left to ferment in the sun.

Then, one morning, I found the hole.

It was in the kitchen wall, beside the rusted stove. Not a crack or a chip, but a perfect circle, about the size of a teacup saucer. Inside, the darkness shimmered, like oil on water. I reached in, my fingers trembling—

—and something *grabbed* me.

Small. Cold. A child’s hand.

*“You’re close,”* Lila’s voice giggled, but wrong now, gurgling, like she was talking through a throat full of mud.

I jerked back, falling against the table. My finger was smeared with something black and sticky. Sap? Blood? I didn’t care. I grabbed a hammer and swung at the wall, tearing open the hole until I could crawl inside.

Big mistake.

The house… changed.

The walls weren’t wood and plaster anymore. They were *flesh*—pulsing, veined, hot to the touch. Nails jutted like teeth. Wires squirmed in the ceilings like parasites. I crawled forward, my knees sinking into something spongy, my flashlight beam shaking.

*“Keep coming, Daddy,”* the voice cooed, but deeper now. Familiar.

*My* voice.

I found her in what used to be the root cellar.

Lila stood there, bathed in the greenish glow of fungi clinging to the walls. Her face was hers, but *wrong*—mouth sewn shut with copper wire, eyes hollowed out, beetles spilling from the sockets. She held out her arms, and the wire snapped, her jaw unhinging like a broken doll’s.

*“You left me here,”* she said, but it wasn’t her. It was *me*. My own voice, ripped from my throat and twisted into something jagged.

The walls screamed. Not metaphorically—*screamed*, a hundred voices overlapping, tearing at my eardrums. I stumbled back, but the tunnel collapsed behind me. The floor dissolved, and I fell into a wet, churning darkness.

It wasn’t empty.

Things brushed against me. Hair. Fingers. *Faces*. All of them whispering, *“Stay. Stay. Stay.”* I recognized some—old Mr. Grady, who’d owned the farm before me. A girl from town who’d gone missing in the ’80s. And Lila… but not just Lila. Dozens of Lilas, their mouths sewn, their hands clawing at me.

The house wasn’t haunted.

It was *alive*.

And it was hungry.

They say drowning is peaceful at the end. This isn’t drowning. This is being *digested*.

The sawdust comes first. It pours into my nose, my mouth, my lungs, gritty and thick. Then the memories—not mine, but *theirs*. The ones the house ate. I feel Mr. Grady’s despair as he buried his stillborn son in the field. I taste the missing girl’s terror as the floorboards swallowed her whole. And Lila… God, Lila.

She never made it to the hospital that last night. The house took her first. Fed on her while I slept in the chair beside her bed, too exhausted to hear her whimpers as the walls peeled open.

Now it’s my turn.

The house stitches my lips with its wires. It hollows my eyes, fills them with squirming, hungry things. And when the new family moves in next month—a young couple, pregnant, eager to “restore the charm” of this old place—I’ll be ready.

I’ll sing to them in their own voices.

I’ll make them believe.
