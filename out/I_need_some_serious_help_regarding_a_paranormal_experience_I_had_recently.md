Okay, so I am a 21yr old college student recently left my hostel and shifted home for a while due to personal reasons (uni in my city itself). As my room was in the middle of a renovation, and me moving back was quite sudden, my parents asked me to sleep with them in their room until the work was over. 

During my first night sleeping with my parents, my mum slept on one end, dad in the middle, and me on the other end. Once i fell asleep, i dreamt of waking up after being asleep in the middle of the bed, that is, between my mum and dad. Dad also woke up in my dream at the same time and asked me to find his phone for me, which also began ringing around the time he asked. My dad often keeps his phone on the bedside table but, in this case, the phone was ringing outside, in the dining region, which was quite weird. An important point to be noted is, in reality, and not only in the dream world, there is this huge window next to the dining region that we have that faces towards our neighbour’s dense backyard, and especially during the dark nighttime, it gives quite a creepy vibe whenever I pass by it. I had the same vibe during the dream and I ended up not getting the phone. On the other hand, I ended up crashing at the bathroom and heading back to bed.

Now, I am sleeping at the same place in the dream as I did before I fell asleep, mum on one end, dad in the middle, and me on the other end. I usually cover my eyes with my blankie to prevent the dim lights in the room to prevent me from falling asleep. As I was about to fall asleep in the dream, and right before covering my eyes, i quickly glanced over the edge of the bed near my feet for something, or someone, precisely. I had this lingering, weird, anxious, lowkey scared, feeling in me since dad had asked me to pick up his phone from the dining area. Anyways, I took a quick glance and there was nothing down there.

Here it where it all began. As i proceed to cover my eyes with my blankie, leaving my nose and mouth in the open, I sense something on my right, near my right foot, while i slept on the right edge of the bed. I really don’t remember what happened next quite clearly, but I began having trouble breathing. I felt as if I was being choked. I remember screaming for my mum, continuously. At one point I could see my dad sleeping next to me from a little gap from the blanket covering my face, but he wasn’t responding to any of my cries. Until I screamed for one last time, and he finally heard me.

I was back to being awake, all sweaty, heartbeats that could be heard by my dad, shaking my hands and feet vigorously so that they don’t go numb. Dad asked me what was wrong, I told him I had a nightmare, a really bad one. Mum was still fast asleep. He made me sit up, and asked me to drink some water. I was still shaking from the entire experience. He noticed that and asked me to chant some mantras, especially the Gayatri Mantra. Exactly two minutes later, we hear the terrifying screeching noise right outside the window near the bed, which we later found out was that of a barn owl.

The experience still gives me the chills, and it just happened two nights back. Few weeks back to a month back, I used to have nightmares of a dark entity following me EVERYWHERE, continuously, for days. They stopped for a while, coming back only once or twice a week since. 

I just wish to know what I witnessed that night. And, If I’m cursed or anything. This is scaring the shit out of me and my parents, I won’t lie.
Has anyone had a similar experience before?

Any information would be appreciated.
