Her name is Star. Star the doll. My Best friend. I had her since I  
was three years old, now I'm thirteen. Ten years with my Best  
friend. She is made by fabric filled with cotton, she has long  
blond beautiful hair and dark brown eyes in which you can see  
her soul, I guess. She knows everything about me. Every little  
scandal that I had with my parents. Every time someone has  
bullied me, or she even knows about my first crush when I was  
10 years old in school. I tell her every little detail in my life. She  
is my best friend. In school, I don’t have many friends, but I  
don’t need them, because Star is always there for me. I don’t  
have very good connection with my parents because they don’t  
understand me, they don’t listen to me like Star is. For them, it is  
not normal to have imaginary friends at this age. She is not  
imaginary, she is real.   Her real name is Isabel. Isabel was  
murder by her parents when she was eleven years old. I don’t  
know why or what happened, Star doesn’t like to talk about it.  
She is more of a listener, not a talker. A couple of months ago,  
my parents were in the living room just watching TV and talking.  
Sometimes me and Star liked to stalk my parents and to listen to  
their conversations. This evening was the same. My and Star  
we were hiding in the dark corridor. My parents were talking about  
moving to another city, I was filled with happiness because I  
didn’t like this little town nor the people in it. But then my  
mother suggested it's time to take Star from me. I was angry. I  
could feel it in my bones. They wanted to separate me from my  
best friend. They hated me. Not only that, but they hated Star.  
They wanted to kill our friendship. They wanted to kill Isabel like  
her real parents. I couldn’t let them do it. I had to stop them. We had to stop them. I remember hearing Star voice whisper in my  
ear:  
— Kill them. Kill them for me, Jess. Show them your power.  


So I waited for them to go to bed. I waited and waited… Then  
the clock hit midnight. They were asleep. But we, we were  
ready for justice, like Star likes to say.  
So I grabbed a knife from the kitchen. I was walking slow and  
quiet in their room. In my right hand, I was holding the knife,  
and on my left hand, I was holding my best friend. We went  
into their room. I was standing in front of their bed.

  
— Let's take first your father. Cut his throat so he cannot  
scream. Then stab him in the heart.- Isabel told me with her  
calm voice.  


So I did it. I cut his throat. Blood was splashing everywhere. I  
stab him several times in the heart. I was covered in blood.  
Then I cut open my mother tummy. I cut her throat. The bed,  
the sheets, the walls, were covered in blood. Everything was in  
blood, except Star. She was clean like nothing had happened.  
But justice was served.  
This was four months ago. Now I'm in some place for  
mentally ill children. Here the people are nice I guess. They  
give me pills and let be play with dolls. Star is no longer with  
me. During the investigation, I lost her somewhere. But it's not  
a problem at all. Star is no longer with me, but Isabel is  
always next to me.   You see, I'm not crazy and my best friend is  
real, not an imaginary. She doesn’t like my doctor, Dr. Ross.  
Because once he said that she wasn’t real and for me to get better, I should understand that. So tonight I'm helping Isabel,  
to give justice. It's time for Dr. Ross to start believing in  
imaginary friends.   Have a wonderful evening and never forget  
about the imaginary friend sitting in the corner of your room  
watching and lessening to you. Be ready to served justice. To  
show them your power.
