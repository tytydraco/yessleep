I followed your advice and I replied Anne's message. Not sure I should've...

FIRST POST HERE: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/y6fe52/i_got_a_text_message_from_anne/


So, I posted some days ago about Anne and how she was a weird girl who seemed to predict events. In case you haven't seen the post, long story short, she sent me a message telling me she was sorry about my accident. I didn't have any accidents (yet) but considering Anne's tendency to foresee stuff that didn't happen yet, I'm terrified.


In the last post's comment section, there were about three things most people agreed on: 1) I need to get the priest (on it, by the way), 2) Anne is probably a seer who hasn't yet come to terms with her ability and 3) I should ask her how it goes down.


I did follow your advice and texted Anne:


*-Hey, how are you? I am ok, don't worry. How did the accident you mentioned happen, though? What do you mean?*


First of all, yes, I know it makes no sense and the way I phrased it is poor, to say the least. But hey, as you might have learned from the previous post, I'm not exactly on a first-name basis with the occult or whatever this is.


It didn't take her long to reply:


*-Your car accident, silly! Lol! The one in May.*


*-Anne, I don't even drive... and May? Like... Last May?*


*-Next, actually!*


I thought, *"well, hey, I have a date with Death, I guess... In May"*, but refrained from making the joke. I texted her again:


*-Can we meet? I wanted to know more about that.*


*-Oh really?! Now you take me seriously? I'm shocked, LMAO! But sure, let's meet. 2pm, at the coffee place you usually go to.*


I don't know why, but something told me I didn't need to ask if or how she knew what coffee place I used to go to. The passive-aggressiveness caught me off guard, though. I had been very understanding with her; truth be told, I believed her so much that it terrified me. 


I arrived at 1:55pm. As I sat, I got a text from Anne:


*-I know you just sat, but it's time to get up. You won't want to have this conversation in public. Come and meet me at the alley to your left.*


Oh, hell no! If the prophecy is fulfilled, I'll be in a wheelchair, which I've been in before. Not exactly fun (pretty much one of the worst things I've been through), but hey, I'd be here. If I follow her into that weird-looking alley, I'm not sure if I'll come out alive.


*-No. Meet me here. I don't care for the public.*


*-As you wish.*


Anne appeared from the alley. Somehow, I'm almost sure she didn't change one bit. She must be nearly 30 now, but she still looks the way she did when we were 9. Maybe taller, I guess. Or is this just my brain messing up my memories. She sat beside me, looked me in the eyes and gave the weirdest grin. As if she was feeling love, hate, regret, and revenge... all at the same time. It was like her whole soul was trapped in that grin, and, at the same time, she had no soul at all.


*-Ok, let's cut to the chase, shall we? I know why I'm here. It's not because you miss or are concerned about me. You are trying to understand if you can avoid the accident, right?*


There was no point in disagreeing. I nodded and made a mental note to apologize for running from her. Anne sighed.


*-You're still as brilliant as always, aren't you? - her sarcasm bit me as she scoffed - There's no such thing as fate. Your fate is not sealed. It never is.*


*-So you're saying I can prevent the accident?*


Anne laughed.


*-I said there's no such thing as fate. Fate as a natural determinism. I didn't say there aren't people who can meddle with your future. For whatever reason, I don't know... Like... Maybe being abandoned by their best friend?* 


*-Anne, I'm sorry, I-*


*-Or maybe telling on their friend, "she said this, she said that blah blah blah". Or being stupid, dumb and careless enough to SENT THEIR BEST FRIEND TO A NUTS HOUSE?*


She was yelling now, but she looked so... I don't even know how to explain. She had the biggest, genuinely happy smile, but her eyes were full of rage and sadness. I didn't know what to say. I fell absolutely mute. I must admit, it was shitty of me to stop talking to her altogether, but I was a terrified 10-year-old. What was I supposed to do? That's when it all fell on me.


*-So... you were institutionalized for mental problems... and you... blame me? What are you trying to tell me? That you'll cause the accident to punish me? Because of what I did when I was 10 and scared?*


*-Oh, it seems like you're a bit brighter nowadays...*


*-Anne, for fuck's sake... We were 10. There was nothing I could do. My mom had noticed the patterns, too. She was the one who asked me. I didn't just volunteer the information. Please... Think about it...*


*-Think abou-... Th-... HAHAHAHAHA! Are you kidding me?! Do you know what it feels like to depend on everyone? To be stuck? To be imprisoned without committing a crime? Do you know what it feels like to see everyone walk away from you, and you can't follow them? You can't go with them. Because you're broken. And holy hell, do you KNOW you're broken!*


Suddenly, it all made sense. The accident... Being paraplegic... She wanted to make me go through the same as she did. But that's when a question started forming in my head.


*-Wait... What about your grandma? And the guy who broke his leg or the other one who fell from the roof? Or your hamster? What happened?*


*-My grandma wasn't thinking straight. She didn't allow me to eat dessert. Who forbids a kid to eat dessert?! The guy at school tripped me when I was in the cafeteria, and I dropped my lunch. He apologized, but the damage was done. The guy from the roof was my uncle. He once dropped me while playing with me when I was a toddler. I skinned my knee pretty bad!*


What was she talking about? What the hell?! Is this what she sees as equivalent punishment? I swallowed hard, my stomach in a knot, and asked her:


*-What... what about Mr Pickles...?*


*-Well, he bit me, and there was some blood.*


*-...So, what happened to him?*


*-Funny story! He caught his paw on the wheel and had to chew it off to break free, haha!*


WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK! How is this funny?! This girl is deranged! None of these things should require any form of punishment, but THIS? I got up and told her I needed to leave. I was feeling sick, ready to throw up. She stood and smiled, waving at me until I was out of sight. I looked back a few times, and she kept waving with that sick smile plastered.


I tried to get my mind off of that encounter. I just got home a few minutes ago, and I would probably be a lot more chill by now if it wasn't for the fact that I got a letter in the mail.


**Guess when my final driver's license exam is scheduled to happen...**
