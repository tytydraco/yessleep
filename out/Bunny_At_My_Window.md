There was always this one tale around the camp of "Little Creak." A figure dressed up in an Easter Bunny suit with grimy, matted fur and tall, oversized ears that drooped down. They told tales of the Bunny-- with large, hollow eyes that stared unblinkingly at you from the corner of your room, nestled underneath the thick layer of the darkness. The tales started to spread mysteriously around the camp one day, and that's when I found out about the *rumour.* 



Back then, I was only seven years old. The children around the camp started to speak wild fantasy tales of the figure in the Easter Bunny suit. That it would stand inside the forest, it's cold, hollow eyes staring at you from afar-- just *watching* you. I thought back then that these rumours were nothing *but* some made up fantasy tale, used to scare me, as well as other kids.




*That was until I* ***saw him*** *one night.*



I remember wrapping myself underneath the gentle, completely tender embrace of my bedsheets. Oak walls remained hidden underneath the sheet of darkness coating my bedroom, a dull, moonlight poured inside the small gap of my window, the etheral light dancing across the walls delicately, illuminating certain objects inside my bedroom with a soft, comfortable light. 



I press my back against the mattress of my bed, immediately leaning into the vast, contemptuous warmth that funneled across my entire body, wrapping me in a transparent blanket. As soon as I was about to pull the covers in my hands straight up over my face, something stopped me--



*Thump.*


...


..



***Thump.***




Something seemed to collide against the glass of my window, pressing gently but with enough force to make the noise audible to me. At first I thought it was just a bird ramming against the stained glass of the window, but the thumps against my window continued to keep going. Constant tapping, almost as if *whatever* it was behind the shield of my curtain knew I was there-- *begged* me to come towards the window. 



Without thinking I let my feet lean over the bed, silently planting my feet onto the ground. It never took me long to walk slowly over to the window, my breath frozen inside my throat as my pale, shaky fingers reached out to pull the curtains back-- and there, standing just an inch away from the glass of my window illuminated effortlessly by the moon, was the figure-- the ***Easter Bunny.***


It's white, originally fluffy suit was stained from head to toe in dirt, the fur soiled beyond repair and looking closely-- great splatches of something red splattered up the suit, staining the grimy white fur of the suit everywhere possible. Huge, cold hollow eyes stared into my own-- dark, not a hint of emotion or light pierced the gaping black holes that were eyes. The suit had a mouth, a wide, brimming grin that stretched all the way up the suits cheeks, only stopping halfway beside it's hollow eyes. The grin of the Bunny wasn't playful, happy-- it was beyond mortifying. 



I can't remember how long *it* had stared at me, and *me* staring at it, all it did was just stand there-- motionless. The breath was completely stuck inside my throat, my heart hammering violently in my chest, fear bubbling up inside me intensely as I couldn't *look* away. I had wanted to scream in that moment, *desperately* scream so my parents would hear me from the other room-- but I *couldn't.* 




I could only watch as after stretched, long periods of what felt like minutes the Easter Bunny stared at me-- it finally started to move. I could only stare, my eyes wide with complete horror, as the Easter Bunny raised one gloved hand to its mouth-- a singular, red stained finger coming to graze against the lips of it's elongated smile, slowly moving it's finger down it's lips. A *shushing* gesture. 





***And then, as quick as that, it was gone.***




For the rest of that night, I couldn't get to sleep once. The fear clung to me, convincing me that If I dared even close a singular eye, the Bunny would come back and this time-- it would stand *right inside the corner of my room.* ***Unblinking.*** That thought alone was enough to keep me wide awake, constantly straining my hearing-- just to see if I could hear that subtle ***tapTaptapTap.tap***





The next few days were ominously quiet, a false sense of security spreading across the entirety of the camp. The entire camp seemed to be tense, batting their breaths as they waited for something-- *anything* to happen. Then it did, the disappearances started to happen. It was slow, almost quiet at first-- one kid didn't show up for school, then another, and *another.* Nobody seemed to know where they went. And the whispered rumours of the camp only grew louder. 






I stumbled across my friends one day speaking about the Easter Bunny in low, shushed voices, each one describing the same thing: the dirty white suit, the cold, hollow eyes, and the wide, brimming smile-- each one describing the strange feeling that it was *watching* them. It wasn't just in the corner of their rooms anymore-- it followed them, lurking in the shadows. They said it would only come in the crack of night, tapping at the window or standing motionless at the foot of their bed, *waiting like a* ***predator*** *towards* ***prey.***






*Then, one night, it* ***came for me once again.***





I laid wide awake in my bed, heart hammering inside my chest, it's force so violent an agonising pain swelled inside his chest, scorching hot. I somehow knew that I would hear those familiar sounds, and when they came, the horror still streamed down me like an overflowing waterfall constantly shifting into frothy, rippling waves. 





***TaptapTaptapTap***






The taps were slow, deliberate, as if the grotesque Bunny was waiting for me to acknowledge it. The fear crawled up me, tightening around me with a heavy, unshakeable pressure. It threatened to freeze my body, stifen the function of my limbs, but I pushed it down. I slowly shook my legs off the bed, placing them down on the floor to get up to check. A massive, unswallowable lump formed inside my throat, soaking up the remaining glands of saliva inside my throat-- leaving a rawness that burned the insides of my throat with a soreness I couldn't quench. 






I hesitated, the air thick with a suffocating dread that threatened to overcome me. All I could do was shake off the feeling, creeping towards the window, pulling back the curtains slowly and there it was--**him** -- standing inches away from my window, exactly like before. The grin stretched impossibly wide up it's cheeks, the dirtied white fabric of the suit twitching, as if the Bunny was itching to move. 





My breath hitched inside my throat as it's arms raised up to place themselves on either side of the window ledge, each step it took closer, an unsettling dragging noise sounded unnaturally loudly against the grass. My entire body stumbled back in paralysation, body clashing loudly against the wooden furniture as I frantically pushed myself backwards on the floor away from the window, body searing with boiling, white pain-- but I could only *watch* as the Bunny started to **open** the window from the outside. 






I was frozen in place, just staring, wide eyed with horror up at the window. Wooden hinges screeched as the Bunny pushed up the hinges of the window, it's arms starting to crawl through the gap of the hinge, grasping down and attempting to push its body through the tiny gap the window hinge and ledge created. 




I truly believed that this was the end for me, just sitting there on the floor, paralyzed-- watching as the Bunny crawled disturbingly slowly through the gap of my window. I never expected that my room door would creak open at that moment, but when I turned back towards the window-- ***nobody was there.***




The next few days blurred together in an array of fear and desperation. Every night, I would hear the ***"TaptapTaptapTap"*** against my window, and every night, the Bunny would grow closer to me-- until one evening, I woke up to find it standing in my room-- it's tall, slender body completely motionless in the darkness, it's dirtied suit hidden. The only thing I could make out were those tall, oversized droopy ears upon it's head, and that wide, inhumanely stretched smile on its face, it's teeth shining a sinister golden in the darkened room. 




I remained completely frozen once again, breath stuck inside my throat, heart hammering and the function of my limbs no longer working. But something was different this time. It wasn't just unblinkingly watching me, it was waiting for me to *move*, staring at me through those cold, wide hollow eyes with an immense intensity I couldn't comprehend. 





*After that...*





***I can't remember what happened that night.***






The only thing I knew for sure was that the whispered rumours spreading throughout Little Creak like wildfire suddenly ceased, stopped. The disappearences had stopped, and soon the children of the town were never seen again. People moved out from the camp due to its history, and the entire place had never been so quiet. 




*Even then...* 





Sometimes, when I lay in bed, even as I write this unable to sleep, I hear it again-- the "***TaptapTaptapTap***" against my window. And when I pull the curtains back, I see it....





***The Easter Bunny.***
