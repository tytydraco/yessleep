Dad shut the door behind Mum, drummed on the roof of the car, turned to me, and said, "I know you're not the type, but no parties while we're gone. There's money for food on the kitchen counter and a list of chores on the fridge. You get 'em done and I'll buy you one of those video games you like."

 I rolled my eyes. "You know games are like $90 a piece these days, right?"

 After a beat, he said, "You get 'em done and I'll give you $60 toward one of those video games you like."

 "Thanks, Dad."

I watched the Corolla pull out of the driveway and, as soon as they were out of sight, I fist-bumped the air. Not once- never- had my parents left me home alone or taken a vacation together. Mum was too invested in her side business- making bracelets and charms for her Etsy store- and Dad would rather be in his woodworking shed.

I opened Messenger on my phone and texted Lana: *Still good to meet at mine at 7:30? ;)*

Since starting high school, I’d been crushing on Lana. Hard. We were both swimmers for our school team, the Marlins, and she was the most driven person I’d ever met- first one in the water, last one out of the locker room. I admired her- and, if I have to admit, her body. Nothing kept me more dedicated to swimming than a curvy girl in a nice swimsuit.

Lana replied: *Yes I am, Mr. Winky-face ;)*

I went inside and plucked the sheet of chores from under a fridge magnet that said "Forget the dogs, beware of the kids!" and skimmed through. I had a couple of hours to get them done before Lana came over, and I planned for us to be very preoccupied.

*Vacuum the house*

*Load the dishwasher*

*Feed the fish*

*Clean your room (for Christ's sake, Charlie, you're 17. It's gone on long enough)*

*Mow the yard (LOCK the doors- do not make this mistake again)*

For a month now, we’d been locked in a war of attrition. My Dad was stubborn, but I was worse. They refused to clean my room until I tidied up first- not that my room was ever messy to begin with- but I had to meet Dad’s standards, and there was no one I knew who could accomplish that. So, out of spite, I let the dirty clothes pile up on the floor and old bowls and cups stack on my study desk (which I'd not once used for studying). Whatever was left, I kicked under my bed. Out of sight, out of mind. There was Lana to worry about, so I'd just have to steer her clear of my bedroom.

The lock was another thing entirely. When we bought the house, it came with an old storm cellar that was only accessible through a hatch in the backyard. Mostly, it was used to store gardening tools, old junk, and wood for Dad’s woodworking. There had been a series of incidents where Dad found signs of some animal- probably a raccoon- living in there. Little, gnawed at pieces of food from our garbage, odd items like 2B pencils and floss- junk like that. Of course, I had no need to be down there. Hell, it creeped me out. There was only a single string-operated light, and the dark still scared me. But nonetheless, Dad accused me of leaving the cellar doors open, and I’d been paying for it ever since.

Four simple tasks- minus cleaning my room, as that’d never be done in time- and I’d have no more responsibilities for two days. I put in my earbuds and flicked through a list of rock playlists on my phone, vacuumed the floor as quickly as I could, sprinkled a few orange flakes of fish food in the tank, and mowed the lawn like I did my face; haphazardly, leaving patches.

Next, I got my night ready- the real high-stakes stuff. It would be romantic and seductive- well, as romantic and seductive as any teen boy could be. I ordered the best pizza in town, Giovanni’s, swiped a bottle of Longneck Goose Vodka from Mum’s liquor cabinet, and prepared a selection of movies: Fright Night, Princess Diaries, and Avengers. A wide spread- one was sure to hit.

At 8 pm, I heard footsteps approaching the door. Lana was late, but this wasn’t new; she had a habit of turning up at any hour but the agreed-upon time. I eagerly awaited her knock- the familiar knock-knock, knock, knock-knock- but it never came. She hadn't texted me that she was out front either, so I opened the door. She wasn’t there. I shut it and texted Lana to see where she was, but got no reply.

8:30 came and passed. Ghosted. My heart hurt- I really thought she felt the same way I did about her. I did the next best thing anyone can do when ditched on a date: I lined up the vodka shots and threw them back. One, then two, then three. Buzzing with drunk energy, I devoured an entire cheese pizza and moist loaf of garlic bread. Halfway through the movie- Avengers, because I scare easily- I was starting to have a pretty good time, which made me feel a little sad. Healthy people aren’t happy spending a night alone drinking. One thing was strange- between the crescendoing shakes of our surround sound speakers was a soft thumping sound, like when the water pipes are on the fritz. I knew it wasn’t in my head because the vodka in my shot glass wobbled.

At some point, I drifted off to sleep. It was a deep, vivid sleep. I had a nightmare about an old alarm clock that wouldn’t turn off no matter how much I bashed it. When I finally woke up- with a stinging headache in my temples- the movie had finished, and the TV had entered sleep mode, leaving me in a dark room. I needed my warm bed and a good night’s sleep. I left the empty pizza box on the coffee table and started flicking off the lights. As I did, I noticed one light still glowing- the cellar. It illuminated the window by our side door. Had I left it on after mowing? Maybe Dad wasn’t wrong to blame me for being so forgetful.

I exited the side door and rounded the corner to the cellar doors, which were wide open. Standing there, I let the light spill onto me. The light was several magnitudes too bright for my drunk ass, and my head swirled. All I knew for certain was that if I called the police, my parents would never let me stay home alone again.

I tip-toed down the creaky steps, lowering my head to duck under a wooden beam. The cellar was just as I remembered it: the lawnmower and a bucket full of gardening tools in one corner, our Christmas tree from last year, and boxes full of old, forgotten junk. After giving it a quick once-over, I pulled the string light and headed back out. My feet were a stumbling mess, and I grabbed onto the open side door to steady myself.

The incident had woken me up, so I plopped back down on the couch and flicked through the TV until I found the infomercial channel. I had this weird feeling I couldn’t quite place- a sense of being watched. I found myself looking toward the shadows at the top of the staircase to the second floor, but nothing was there.

At 11 pm, I got a text from Lana: *Sorry, my phone died. I was gonna charge it when I got to yours. Are we still good for next week?*

I sighed. There was no chance I’d get another weekend like this.

*I thought you were good for this weekend.*

*Wait- your dad told me they delayed their trip by a week and you had to go help your grandma with errands or something?*

*When did you speak to my dad?*

*Well, when I was at your house tonight. Your dad was cleaning out the cellar and let me know you were busy- he even offered to drive me home.*

Just then, the staircase creaked- a slow, soft creak- as if someone, diligently, was creeping down the stairs.

I shot up from the couch and ran for the front door. The staircase was silent, but I could feel eyes burrowing into the back of my head. I fumbled with the lock, tripped out the door, and sprinted over to my neighbor’s house.

I explained to them what had happened, and they phoned the cops. They showed up twenty minutes later and did a walkthrough of the house. When they finished, they stood out front looking calm, but one of the officers kept checking his phone- his eyes were a little too alert.

"Am I okay to go back inside? You aren’t going to tell my parents, are you?" I asked.

The officer hesitated before countering with a question of his own. "Do you drool in your sleep?"

"What- no? Why would you ask that?"

The officer pressed his lips into a thin line. "Because the pillow we found under your bed was stained with drool."

He left it there, and I, for one, am glad for it.
