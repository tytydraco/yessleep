My wife’s long, black hair swept over her shoulder as she turned to tell me to hurry up.



Six miles into the hike and she was still bounding with energy while I neared the brink of collapse.



\*bang bang bang bang\*



Taking no notice of the pounding that had just drifted through the trees, she paused to allow me to catch up with her, and teased me for becoming an old man. Our tenth time making the trek—an annual tradition to return to the place where I’d proposed—and she looked as beautiful as she had on the first.



\*Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang\*



It was louder now—enveloping us. Desperately I tried to ignore it too—fighting to stay in the moment—fighting to stay with her. I knew what was waiting if I gave in…



\*BANG BANG BANG\*



“Fuck…”



I opened my eyes, and she was gone.



And I was back… \*there…\*



Light bringing no warmth streamed in through the window, and I shivered, uselessly pulling the meager, moth-bitten sheets tighter to my body.



A full month’s worth of frigid mornings had taught me to expect the chill air forcing its way through the cracks in the crumbling, plaster walls, which brought with it the scent of fresh snow.



“And so continues the endless winter in Hell…” I grumbled, half-awake, as I reached blindly towards the bedside table and wrapped my hand around the glass that I knew would be waiting there—full to the brim with poisonous medicine.



Swallowing its entire contents in two large gulps, I gagged on the flavor of tepid, watered-down, cheap whiskey—potent enough to keep the shakes at bay, yet not quite so strong as to bring any measure of real peace. At least its pain-numbing qualities exceeded those of the booze in the outside world—allowing me to choke back the tears brought on by my shattered back.



\*BANG BANG BANG BANG\*



The cacophony that had woken me continued down on the first floor.



From the sound of it, our fresh arrival was still violently trying to come to terms with his new living arrangements—angrily shouting, pounding on the walls, and, based on the scraping and then the loud crashes that followed, attempting to hurl the dining room chairs through the windows.



“Henri will be furious about having to rebuild those again…” I murmured.



I took another swig from the glass that, by then, had refilled itself, and listened more closely to the man’s words. With only two semesters of college Spanish under my belt, it was some time before I recognized anything that he was screaming.



“¡¿Dónde está la puerta?!” was the only thing I picked out that I fully understood.



‘It will return soon enough.’ I thought to myself, polishing off my second helping of swill, and setting the glass back on the table—feeling the weight of those words more heavily given the events of the last couple days.



‘Best not focus on that part, though.’ I shuddered, propping my back up against the metal bars of the headboard and reaching once again for my only comfort in \*there\*—topped off, as it was, for a third time.



Confined to my bed for the foreseeable future, I heard Henri’s door open and his footsteps thump passed mine as I knew, for the third day in a row, he was going to attempt and calm the fresh tenant.



And, watching the haggard, dirty, broken man in the mirror that faced the bed raise the glass once again to his lips, I reflected back on my first day in The Winter House.

\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*



\&#x200B;



Two years.



It was two years to the day that I lost Sherry.



It had all happened so quickly.



We were on our anniversary hike when, for the first time in our relationship, she fell behind me; then, without warning, collapsed in the middle of the trail.



Hospital visits, tests, diagnosis, treatment, fighting, losing, withering.



Dead.



Six months—that’s all it took. Thirty-seven years of healthy existence, ten years of happy marriage—so much life still left in front of her.



Dead.



Every time I closed my eyes, I could still hear the high-pitched squeal of the machine announcing to me that her heart had stopped when I felt the last of her strength evaporate from the hands I was holding.



For the next two years, I tried to carry on without her—did everything I knew to pull myself out of the swirling pit of despair I’d dropped into the moment she stopped breathing. Friends, family, hiking, lifting, church—I even debated going to therapy, but my father had always told me that that was only for weak men.



Every day, I fell deeper into the hole, and every day, the bottle loomed nearer.



You see, Sherry and I had met in Alcoholics Anonymous. She was already three months sober at the time, and comforted me on my very first day—helped see me through the worst of my detox, kept me going back to meetings, became my biggest advocate.



We were two broken souls that had enough pieces left to hold each other together, and once she was gone, mine was shattered once more.



But she had made me promise that I would keep my sobriety in her absence—made me swear it on the ring she’d worn on her hand every day of our marriage, and that I then wore around my neck every day after her passing.



Yet, one night, I found myself in a bar.



A bar I’d been to many, many times in my pre-Sherry life. A bar so familiar that, though I hung my head in shame, the feet I was watching carried me to a stool that, even after years of my neglect, still felt like home when I sat in it. And, without me uttering a single word, a drink appeared in front of me.



Double-whiskey, on the rocks—the bartender winked and asked where I’d been before shuffling off to take another patron’s order. Staring at the ice cubes suspended in the amber pour of my failure, I apologized to Sherry before downing it in one practiced motion.



Five more helpings of the same tonic at the bar, and a stop at the liquor store on the way home, and I was feeling the best that I had in a long while. In fact, it was the only time in the last two years that I hadn’t felt the crushing weight of Sherry’s death bearing down on my chest, and I was experienced enough to know that the minute I sobered up again, the pain of her loss would return even more intensely than before.



So, I decided that night, on the walk between the liquor store and my house, that I was never going to be sober again. My plan was to continue drinking in every waking minute of every hour of every day of the remainder of my life, until my liver finally would give out on me.



And, in that instant, I felt an incredible sense of relief.



Everything seemed so simple then—I was a locksmith who worked for himself, so I didn’t need to worry about being fired for intoxication. All I needed to do from then on would be to make enough money to afford my rent, utilities, food, and booze while I waited for death to take me.



What I did not know, at the time, was that I’d just made myself a target.



\&#x200B;



\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*



\&#x200B;



When I arrived home that evening, I immediately stumbled my way into the kitchen and grabbed a plastic cup from the cabinet. Given I was already nearly toppling over with each step, I was certain I’d shatter anything glass if I tried to use it, and therefore was more than happy to fill my NASCAR chalice with a heavy dose of whiskey and ice.



The next hour or so, I melted into the couch watching trash TV—working myself halfway through the fifth I’d purchased. It wasn’t long before I passed out—empty vessel in hand—dreamlessly fading into nothing.



I awoke with a headache around three in the morning needing to pee fiercely and, stupidly, I tried to sprint to the restroom—kicking the coffee table on the way there. Blind pain seared through what I imagined was likely a broken pinkie toe on my right foot, necessitating that I limp the rest of my way to the toilet in our master bathroom.



After I’d finished my business, I debated brushing my teeth and laying down in bed for the rest of the night, but with the way my head was feeling, I knew that if I didn’t get some more alcohol into my system before I fell asleep again, the morning would horrendous. And walking back out into our bedroom, I caught sight of something I hadn’t noticed when I’d crossed through the space with my eyes bleary from the tears of my shattered toe.



There was a glass on my bedside table.



Brimming with a brown liquid and ice effortlessly floating through it—tinkling softly as the cubes moved up and down—it appeared as if someone had just placed it there a moment ago.



I blinked repeatedly to make sure it didn’t disappear, but after closing my eyes and opening them for the fourth time, I resigned myself to its reality and focused then on how it could have gotten there.



As I mentioned, I was only planning to drink out of my plastic cup for the evening. Moreover, as far as I was aware, I’d been knocked out on the couch until about five minutes prior. ‘Had it been there when I came into the room initially?’ I pondered. ‘It must have been unless there was someone else in the house with me…’



My heartrate increased considering the possibility that someone had invaded my home, and I stood stock-still for a minute, listening intently for the sound of any other movement in the house. But all that met my ears was the gentle clink of the ice, which I felt should have settled by that time. Yet, when I looked back at the table, it was impossibly still stirring—as if disturbed by an unseen hand.



Grabbing a baseball bat from the closet, I planned then to search the house and started first by checking that I had, in my drunken stupor, remembered to lock the front door. Sherry and I had had a break-in a couple years before she passed and I had personally installed a special deadbolt that used keys which I’d made myself. Of those keys there were only two in existence, and of those two I retained sole possession. So, when I reached the door and found that I had indeed thrown the bolt behind me when I’d returned home earlier, I relaxed slightly.



Confident that no one could have picked the lock and entered through the main entrance, I conducted a thorough search of the remainder of the modest domicile. In doing so, I established that all other doors and all of the windows were locked, sealed, and undamaged, and I detected no trace of anyone besides myself within the walls.



I was alone.



So, I returned to my bedroom, praying as I crossed the threshold that the beverage would simply have vanished, and I could chalk the whole thing up to a hallucination.



But I was sorely disappointed.



There it still stood, solid as the moment I first laid eyes on it—ice continuing to bob up and down. The only explanation that I had for its presence, then, was that I had woken up (or maybe even sleep-walked) sometime before I had arisen to pee, made myself the drink, placed it down next to my bed, and wandered back to the couch.



‘But why in the fuck would I do that?’ I confusedly considered.



If that had been what happened, I would have had to have done it very recently as the ice looked un-melted. And it seemed so odd that I wouldn’t have drank any of it before heading back to the living room. However, as it was the only explanation I could come up with that made any sense to me, and given I had been on my way to the kitchen to fix another drink before I spotted the one already waiting for me, I begrudgingly accepted that it must be the truth—brushing off the concerns that kept popping up in my head.



With that, I approached the table and saw that as I did, my footsteps shook the contents—answering for me how it had appeared to be in a constant state of disturbance. I had been stomping around the house and creating the vibrations that were making it look alive.



So easily, I ignored all of my worries. So easily, I lifted the glass from the table.



So easily, I took a sip…



And…



It was euphoria.



The most delicious drink that had ever passed my lips. In fact, the most delicious thing I’d ever consumed in my life. Far beyond the quality of the piss I knew to be sitting in the plastic bottle in the kitchen that it should have tasted like.



But I didn’t care.



I could not stop myself.



Down, down, down; I gulped its entirety down in a wild frenzy. Unable to move from the spot, unable to care for anything else—I ate the ice—I licked the inner walls of the glass clean—I was about to bite down on the glass itself when I snapped out of it.



For a moment, I felt nothing. But then, as I lowered the empty container from my face, I was struck with an intense surge of pleasure. Every nerve ending surged with warmth—every pain I’d ever known drifted away—Sherry’s hollow, sickened face dissolved from my memories and was replaced with the smile that greeted my mornings for so many years.



I needed more.



Then, as if a bartender had heard my thoughts, I looked down to see the glass was full again.



Madly, I snatched it up—draining the elixir even faster than the first helping. And I was rewarded. I began tingling with the sensations of every joyous minute I’d ever experienced—the best days of my life all flashed before my eyes—the smell of Sherry’s perfume crept into my nostrils.



At that moment, I was positive that I was happiest being on the planet.



While I basked in bliss, a voice rose from the back of my mind, carrying with it only one word.



“MORE!” It demanded.



The glass was full again.



And the third dose barely lasted a second.



I felt Sherry’s arms around my waist—wrapping me in a hug from behind. The weight of her head pressed down on my shoulder and she pulled me gently down onto the bed. Lovingly, she ran her fingers through my hair, and whispered tenderly in my ear.



“Don’t worry—I’ve got you now.”



It was so sweet to hear her voice again, so sweet to feel her warmth beside me.



“I’ve got you now.” She repeated, yet this time, the tenderness was gone.



This time, a darkness filled each syllable.



Panic replaced ecstasy, but I was helpless to do anything about it. Overwhelming exhaustion overcame me, and I was forced, powerlessly, into a heavy and dreamless slumber.



\&#x200B;



\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*



\&#x200B;



Sunlight shone on the inside of my eyelids, and I cracked them open to find it was morning. Nothing about my bedroom appeared different than any other time I’d woken up there, besides that it was absolutely freezing for the middle of summer. Yanking the covers closer to me, I cocooned myself to attempt and warm my bones, but it was to little avail.



A pounding headache prevented the events of the previous evening from returning immediately, but when I rotated my head to look at the clock on the bedside table, there was an empty space on it that I knew, for some reason, should have been occupied.



The glass was gone.



It all came back to me and I, with a start, sat up in bed—quickly to be greeted with an incredible bout of nausea.



Frantically, I ran for the restroom and began to vomit so furiously, I worried that I might not just expel what was inside my stomach, but actually launch my stomach itself into the toilet. It was the most miserable I had ever felt—a hangover so severe that I legitimately considered calling for an ambulance. You would have thought that in that instant, I’d be swearing off alcohol forever. Yet in reality, once I felt assured that I had nothing left inside my body to chuck up, the first thing I did was crawl, like a baby, to the kitchen to find my leftover whiskey from the night before.



Any alcoholic can tell you that the fastest way to cure alcohol withdrawal is to consume more alcohol.



So, with trembling hands, I snatched the half-empty bottle down from the counter and, forgoing any imitations of sophistication, took two large pulls directly from it. I gagged and my stomach churned—it took every ounce of my fortitude to keep it down, but I was able to hold it. Sitting on the floor, I leaned against a cabinet and continued to take small sips every few minutes while I waited for it to take effect. And gradually, I began to feel the hangover symptoms subsiding.



Once I was able to focus on anything other than feeling horribly ill, I thought again about the night before—about the mysterious glass. About how… perfect… it had made me feel. With its conspicuous absence that morning, I wondered if it had all been a very lucid dream—maybe it really had been a hallucination brought on by the binge I’d gone on after such a long period of sobriety.



Whatever the case, as the whiskey displaced more and more of the healthy ingredients of my blood, I focused less on the, likely, imagined events of the night before, and more on my growing hunger. With that sensation returning, I knew that I would be feeling well enough to stand and hauled myself to my feet.



Swaying a bit more than I expected, I continued to take intermittent gulps of drink as I managed to fumble my way through a shower, teeth brushing, and getting dressed, so that I could at least head out to get a greasy fast-food breakfast and another bottle for the afternoon.



Feeling at least presentable enough for the liquor store, I stepped out through the front door, closed it behind me, and turned my key in the deadbolt to lock it. But when I spun it back to the center position to remove the key from the door, it got stuck.



Yanking on it as hard as I could, it refused to pull free from the lock. I tried jiggling it a bit, but couldn’t shake it loose. Then, I tried twisting it back to the locked position, but it wouldn’t budge that direction either.



Annoyed, I was about to head to my truck to grab some of my smithing tools to force it to come out, when something… happened…



The key rotated on its own to unlock the door.



I stared at it in disbelief for a moment—there was no way that should have been possible. Even if someone was standing on the other side of the door and had spun the deadbolt handle, it wouldn’t have moved the key externally.



Confused, but significantly inebriated such that I was more frustrated than scared at the time, I tried to turn it back to lock the door again, but found it was now frozen in the unlocked position.



Unsure of what to make of the situation, I decided to open the door to begin investigating the entire mechanism when I was met with a sight that I’ll never forget.



My living room was gone.



Instead, the door had opened to reveal the dingiest interior I’d ever seen. From what I could make out under a thick coating of dirt, there were wood floors where there should have been carpet—a dining room with a sloping table and three crippled chairs took the place of my kitchen—and a sitting room with one tattered sofa occupied the space where my recliner and TV should have been.



Every surface was topped with such a thick layer of dust that the only distinguishable color was gray. And the most confusing part was that directly in front of me, straight-away from the front door itself, was a flight of stairs leading up to a second floor.



But I lived in a one-story home.



I moved backwards one step and surveyed the exterior of the house just to make absolutely sure that I hadn’t somehow blacked out and found my way to the wrong abode, but there were the numbers of my address on the letterbox right next to the door.



As I had the night before, I blinked again and again in the hopes that my living room would return, but the decrepit image beyond the entry remained unchanged—there were the stairs leading up to the floor that could not exist.



Fear began to eat its way through my liquid courage, and I reflected back on the glass from the night before. Maybe it hadn’t been a dream…maybe I’d been drugged…maybe it was part of a government experiment of some kind with LSD. There needed to be a sane explanation for what I was seeing as it was impossible that my door had randomly decided to open itself into another home.



I went to take another step back, as my instinct then was to take off running, but before I could, a hand shot out from behind the door.



A hand the size of my chest.



A hand with haphazard, jagged spines jutting from the back of it.



Pointed fingers as long as my forearms wrapped themselves around my wrist, and I was pulled inside the dismal foyer before being violently thrown to the ground near the foot of the steps.



I felt my elbow shatter as it slammed into the floor and I heard the door crash shut behind me. Screaming in pain and terror, I turned now to face what had just ripped me into a nightmare only to find my concept of a nightmare had been childishly underestimated.



A naked, pale creature towered over me.



Moving on all fours, it circled me like a predator considering its next meal. And, given the daggerlike, carnivorous teeth it displayed in a mouth that opened wide enough to consume my whole head in one bite, I believed it would not be too long before I discovered what it felt like to be prey.



Its face was rounded—containing slits for nostrils and sunken, black holes where there should have been eyes, but even lacking those, I knew it could see me—it met my gaze no matter what angle I watched it from. If not for the shape of the head and the humanoid hands, it would have appeared much like a twelve foot long, hairless dog but for one additional feature.



The spines.



I’d seen them on the back of the hand that grabbed me, but now that my eyes were adjusting to the light, and I’d blinked away many of the tears that had formed from the pain in my arm—I could see clearly that there were four-to-five-inch spikes sticking out from its flesh on nearly every part of its body sans its face, palms, and soles.



Hundreds of them.



There was no pattern or organization, and when they caught the light from the sun streaming through a window, I took them to be made of bone. On top of the talonlike fingers and the razor teeth, I then pondered that the spines on this thing might be venomous, and I started to cry once more thinking through the horrible, painful ways in which I was about to die.



It moved closer to me, and I braced myself for the inevitable, but then, it simply stepped over my body, and climbed the stairs behind me. I heard it make the hallway above, its steps receding further and further into the house, and then a door slam.



And I was alone again.



Gingerly, I got up from the floor, and backed myself towards the entrance, never taking my eyes off the stairs in case that thing came charging back down them. I felt behind me for the wall, and eventually made contact with it—blindly running my hands along its surface, I searched for the handle, but continued to feel nothing but smooth wood.



Getting nowhere, I risked a look behind me to find the door, but was met with yet another shock.



It had vanished.



\&#x200B;



\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*



\&#x200B;



Staring at a bare wall between two windows, my brain broke momentarily and I began laughing. Laughing hysterically at what, I wasn’t sure, but I knew one thing.



It wasn’t real.



It couldn’t be real.



It was a joke of some kind—it had to be. I turned around expecting people to pop out from behind the moldy sofa, but no one came. I pulled my cellphone from my pocket to see if I had any messages from friends saying they, “got me” to find that it wouldn’t turn on, though it’d had a full charge when I’d walked out of my house just minutes earlier.



Surveying the room around me further, I saw only candles and oil lamps for lighting—no outlets or appliances.



I wondered if I’d somehow stepped outside of time.



With the dire nature of my situation setting in more and more by the minute, I again felt panic building in my chest. Sprinting to one of the windows that flanked where the door should have been, I peered outside to see if I could flag down someone from the street to help me, but my street was not outside those windows.



I don’t know what I’d expected—I’d been pulled into a home not my own, and could then see that the world outside was not the one I’d left behind either. The world outside didn’t even appear to be in the same season as the one I’d come from.



Thick snow blanketed the ground in a sea of trees that stretched further than my eye could discern. Somehow, I’d traveled from summertime in suburbia to a winter forest in an instant. What little buzz I’d had going before leaving my house that morning was fading rapidly and I was not going to be able to contain my terror much longer.



Feeling that fleeing on foot through the woods would be better than exploring any deeper into the house and possibly running into even more terrible creatures, I tried to pry open the window I was looking out of, but it wouldn’t move. I searched for a lock that might be holding it shut, or nails, or screws, anything that would prevent it from letting me out, but there was nothing that I could locate.



Throwing all caution away, I started to punch and kick the window following my body’s instinctual desire to run, but it seemed nothing I did could crack the glass. Overtaken by dread, I forgot even the fear that the monster I’d already met would come soon to devour me and yelled for someone, anyone to help me while I smashed my body into the panes. Eventually, I even tried to throw a chair though it, and it did nothing more than break the chair into pieces.



And it was when I did this that I heard a voice behind me curse in a thick, French accent.



“Motherfucker, it took me weeks to mend that last time!” It snapped.



I shouted and jumped back against the wall after finding a waif of a man behind me. Dressed in the remains of what had possibly been business attire at one time, he’d previously had a mustache, but now above his lip were a few tufts of unkempt mange. And much of the gray, matted hair on his head looked to have been yanked out. His teeth were rotting and his skin browed with dirt, but not enough to cover the needle marks in both of his arms.



A junkie.



“Where am I?! What do you want??” I blurted at the man, who threw a finger in front of his mouth and shushed me threateningly.



“I want you to shut the fuck up and quit breaking shit…



“It doesn’t like it when we fight.” He whispered, ominously—eyes darting to the second floor.



I dropped my voice lower.



“Who are you? What is it? What is this place?” I asked.



“I,” he indicated himself, “am Henri Laurent.



“This,” he gestured to the room around him, “is The Winter House.



“And it…” he pointed up the stairs where the creature had disappeared, “…is The House. And The House is it.”



He was speaking nonsense—clearly high on whatever he’d shot into his veins. My face must have shown my distaste for his bullshit when I was clearly in distress, as he smiled and continued.



“You think I’m fucked up and spouting gibberish at you, no?” He gave a quiet chuckle, “I thought the same thing when Bo explained it to me, but he tried to… gently… deliver the news. I feel it’s easiest for you to hear the blunt truth. You’ll come to accept it more quickly that way.”



“Accept what?” I inquired.



“That you are dead.” He said, nonchalantly.



“I’m dead?!” I snapped, involuntarily.



“Not quite yet, exactly. But you will never leave here alive. Think of this place as a sort of… purgatory… A miserable purgatory…” He trailed off.



“Please,” I pleaded with him. “I just want to go home—can you help me get out of here?”



“Were you not listening?” He quipped. “You cannot leave! No one leaves The House once it has them! It brought you here to feed on you—and there it will never let you go.”



“Stop…” I begged him. It was too much—my whole body was shaking, and I was struggling to breathe. “Please, I don’t want to hear anymore. I just want to go home.” I sniffled with tears returning to my eyes.



“Oh, but you are home.” He said, unsympathetically. “There’s already a room prepared for you upstairs.”



“This isn’t my home!” I shouted.



“Of course it is—you accepted the invitation.” He gave a yellow-toothed smile.



“Invitation?” I racked my brain for a memory of accepting an invite to live with a monster and a junkie Frenchman when it hit me.



The glass.



The drink…



“You remember now, no?” He pestered. “What was it? Pills? Cocaine?”



“A whiskey…” I stammered.



“Ah, yes—alcoholic then. Mine was heroin—the best I’d ever had—three needles full. The shit here is terrible, but it’s all there is…” His expression dropped to one of deepest longing.



“There’s heroin here?” I was astonished.



“Heroin, alcohol, pills, meth, cocaine—whatever brought you here will be here for you, always.” He paused momentarily.



“The House provides.” He finished, then walked towards the shattered chair and picked up some of the pieces. There was a pile in the corner of the room with the remains of several other pieces of furniture, and it appeared he was going to try and mend the chair using pieces of different chairs and still more pieces of chairs as tools.



“You’ll see.” He started up again. “Go check your room—up the stairs and first door on the right—there will be something waiting for you in there that I’m sure you’re beginning to get desperate for.”



“Upstairs? Are you crazy? That thing is upstairs!” I had every intention of keeping as much space between me and the monster until I could figure out what was going on.



“Oh, it won’t bother you now.” He said, “It was only down here to let you in—it’ll stay in its room until it’s time to feed again or unless we try to kill each other.”



He could see that I did not trust him at his word.



“Fine,” he sighed, “would you like me to show you to your room?”



I did not want Henri to show me anywhere—I wanted to wake up. I tried to slap myself several times, but only found Henri’s laughing face staring back at me each time that I did.



“Follow me.” He made a motion behind him and walked towards the stairs. “Come—there is something in your room that will make this easier.”



I saw no reasonable alternatives. I could continue to try and smash unbreakable windows and find an invisible door, or I could follow Henri to “my” room (being I was unwilling to explore any of the rest of The House alone). So, trepidatiously, I accompanied him.



Henri showed me up to the second floor, which comprised a single hallway that led straight back to a door at the end with three others branching off on the sides.



“The Warden lives down there.” He pointed to the door at the end of the hall, “I’m in here,” he threw a thumb towards the first door on the left, “Bo’s in there,” he jabbed a finger to the second door on the left, “and that leaves you in here.”



We stopped in front of the only door on the righthand side of the hall.



I opened my mouth to ask him more questions, including why he’d referred to the creature as “The Warden,” but he shushed me for a second time.



“Just go in and get your head right—I’ll explain how it all works, well at least what’s been passed to me and the little I understand of it, once you’ve taken the edge off a bit.” He gave an encouraging nod towards the door, and I opened it to see a small, and rather shabby room.



My initial reaction was that it had no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and I was unsure what Henri was referring to as something that would help inside. A small cot one might generously call a bed sat under a window on the righthand side with a mirror facing it from the opposite wall. On the left, there was a putrid looking toilet, and the only other furniture was a small nightstand which was barren except for…



A glass of whiskey.



The adrenaline had been masking it, but now that my body no longer felt it was in imminent threat of death, the withdrawal symptoms were encroaching and the pain in my elbow was peaking. I don’t recall entering the room or walking to the edge of the bed—all I know is one second I was at the entry with Henri, and the next I was holding the glass in my hand.



Hesitating, and remembering the many warnings I’d been given during my life to not accept strange food or drinks, I turned back towards the door expecting Henri to be there providing affirmation that it was okay to take a sip, but he’d gone. Instead, I was startled by the touch of another hand on the one that was holding the drink.



A gentle hand.



Sherry’s hand.



My body was frozen by its presence other than the arm she was guiding—she pushed the glass towards my mouth and from behind me, she cooed when it reached my lips, “It’s okay baby—you need this.”



So, I drank.



It was a pale imitation of the quality of ‘The Invitation’—warm and with a flavor more reminiscent of top shelf booze than the transcendent experience I’d had the previous night. However, in that moment, it was everything that I craved. My body relaxed the instant the liquid touched my tongue, and while the powerful ecstasy did not return either, the calming effect was exquisite—even the pain in my elbow receded. Though the high was muted from what I knew was possible, it was still enough for me to beg for more.



And my wish was granted.



I stood, rooted in place, while Sherry’s hands nudged me through two more helpings. And, while I considered that it could have just been due to my intoxication level increasing, I couldn’t help but notice each glassful tasted less potent. 



When I set the glass down the third time, Sherry left me.



“No… No, no—come back!” I yelled.



But she did not return.



Alone once more, and with my fear then sufficiently muted that I could begin to process the position I'd landed in, Henri’s words floated through the drunken haze.



“The House provides.”



Looking down at the table, the glass was yet again full, and the meaning of that statement sank into my mind. The House could give me a chance to feel my wife’s touch again—hear her voice—see her smile. And it would furnish me with as much alcohol as I wished to drink.



“It brought you here to feed on you.”
