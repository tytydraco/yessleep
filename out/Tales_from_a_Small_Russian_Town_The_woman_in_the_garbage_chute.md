I came back to my house after intruder broke into my house one night, thankfully i got some money for the new window. Police said that they are still investigating the case and they will find the culrpit, but something about their faces.. it made me feel like something is wrong. They looked puzzled, maybe even confused. Of course, i would understand if they actually saw the things unfold that night, but i haven't told them that the man leaped to my window like a frog. I was at least happy that i changed my window, it was not really pricey, and it's security measures, so person who installed the window told me i can pay half the price, cause he felt bad for my situation.

So now i am in my house again, of course it felt unusual to come back after what just happened and i gotta admit, i still feel paranoid about the whole thing. That man definetely made me feel like a character from a slasher movie. Luckilly, he did not show up again. How do i know this? Well, i decided to ask one of my neighbours on first floor to give me one of his cameras. I will explain later why he has them, but he was happy to give them to me and even helped me install one if them outside my window. So i was able to watch the footage without leaving the comfort of my bed and not looking outside. But if he does show up again, i would be ready.. i think.

But before we get to the story, i want to ask you something. How often do you take out the trash? How often do you horde the trash bags? Do you ever look at the full bag of trash and go «I will throw it away later» and just forget about it until you have 5 of them? Well, i am the kind of person who does that. Because i am mostly busy all day, I sometimes feel too tired to do anything, and i end up procrastinating and leaving things undone. I want to tell you a story that happened way before the incident with the intruder, related to the subject. Let's start off with talking about my place and where i live.

Most of the russian folks live in apartment complexes that are usually connected together like a big wall. But my house is a singilar building, we call these «Candles». It is 9 stories tall, and each floor has at least 6 apartments, maybe. I live on seventh floor, just a reminder. I lived here with my mom for over 7-8 years, until she moved out to another city for work related reasons recently, leaving me alone to take care of the apartment. The building itself is definitely old, it even has different drawings and writing on it left by people who lived before me, outside and inside mind you. And on every second floor we have a garbage chute. These are installed in every single apartment building. 

We started to use the chute more often, because neighbors thought that leaving garbage outside the building may not be a good idea, plus we want the building to look appealing. If there's trash outside the house, people will think druggies and alcoholics live here, not good people basically. I found out about this the hard way, when i left an old coat next to my house, thinking maybe someone can take it for themselves. After all, i found a whole book of Lord of the rings in perfect condition near my house along with a bag of old books. But as it turns out i was not supposed to do that and i got called on the intercom and told to throw it away into the garbage chute. My mom scolded me for what i did. That's why my neighbour had these cameras, because he installed 2 outside the house and one outside his apartment door pointed at the first floor chute, cause it gets stuffed all the time.

Our garbage chute is old and narrow and sometimes trash bags don't want to fall down the pipe properly, leaving them stuck inside the chute. So the best solution i found for these situations is beating the bag with a broom few times till it falls down the pipe. Also, like i said before, someone keeps stuffing bags into the first floor chute, so we have to dig them out so all the trash falls right into the bin. After awhile, i started to wonder if it is possible to actually fall down the chute into the basement floor of the house? Yeah, i am weird, but you would probably wonder same thing out of sheer curiosity. Of course i was not planning to do that, i would probably die trying. But i was still curious about what happens inside..

So, one day, while throwing away my garbage, i wanted to look inside the chute. Because i was on the top floor, and my. Chute was the last one, so don't worry, i wouldn't get hit in the head with a bag of god knows what from above. I menaged to take a look inside.. honestly the smell was terrible, of course it would be, so much trash and spoiled food gets thrown here. But that's not what made me feel amused, it was something else. I saw a pale looking object deep in the chute. I thought maybe someone's bag got stuck.. but then i tried to look at it closer, the best i can at least. Then i noticed strange features.. eyes.. mouth.. nose.. a face.. it was a face. I couldn't believe my eyes. I do not drink, smoke, or do drugs, so it's impossible for me to have these kinds of hallucinations. I was ready to take a photo, but then i thought that maybe its just my imagination or a case of pareidolia. I threw my bags into the chute and left as i heard my bags falling to the bottom, but not hitting the bin. Usually i can hear the echo of the bag falling into the bin, but this time i didn't. Guess the first chute was stuffed again.

On the next day, i forgot about it, cause i got too focused on building a deck for my YuGiOh master duel. I made so many steam accounts just to build all the decks i want to play. As i went to the kitchen, i realised that i forgot to throw away a pizza box that was sitting on my table for few days now. Of course, i can always leave it here till i eventually throw it away, but i thought «Get your lazy ass to the chute, it takes a second». So i folded the box and went to the chute.As i opened the chute door, my mind reminded me of the face. I was still curious of what i saw, so i decided that maybe i can look again just once. I looked into the chute, and my eyes widened. The thing was still there.. and it got closer? Just a little, but i could see it a little better. My heart jumped a little. I tried to think rationally, but what kind of explanation do i come up with to convince myself that this is not a literal human face. As i looked at it, i started to realize that face appeared to be of a woman.. a smiling woman. Her face was upside down, and she stared right into my soul..she was not too close to me, but the fact that it even got close scared me a little. Then a thought came into my head, maybe i just didn't realize how close it was, and it may just be a bag with a magazine maybe, a magazine with a woman's face on the cover. I decided to calm down and just throw the pizza box in. And again, it reached the bottom, but not the bin.

And on the next day.. things took a turn. I was cleaning my house from all the trash and things that laid around the house that i forgot to throw away, like some old bread in the cupboard, bottles, old electricity papers. I had a whole bag of «goodies» ready to be thrown away. The idea of going to the chute again made me feel uneasy after i saw the face. As i went to the chute, i decided to just throw it away, not even look inside the chute. I heard the sound my bag not falling into the bin once again, and i started to get infuriated. So i grabbed my broom and went to first floor to clean up the mess, cause this was getting ridiculous, and if they won't clean it, i will. When i got to the first floor, the chute was clean, it was not stuffed. So that meant that it was somewhere on one of the top floors. As far as i remember it didn't go too far, so it must be on fifth floor, which was not odd, since bags can get stuck anywhere.

I went to fifth floor and just as i thought, something was definetely inside. I assumed it was some bag of old clothes that got stuck inside, or some old stinky blanket, cause the smell coming from it was horrible. I grabbed my broom and started pounding whatever was inside, thinking i can get it into a position where it would smoothly slide down the pipe into the bin. I heard the sound of something breaking or cracking, like twings snapping, or maybe even bones, something felt off. Suddenly, something grabbed my broom and started pulling it.. a hand, a pale feminine hand held the broom by it's handle. It was definitely not a blanket, i thought, and that's when i saw it once again, the same face that stared at me from the chute, smiling once again at me. It's face peeking from the hole, it's eyes red with anger. I watched as it tried to pull the broom, i kept pulling with all my might, i may look like a twig, but i went to boxing lessons so i have some meat on my bones. The thing was slowly crawling out of the chute, i had to do something. Something snapped in my head and with all my rage and strength i pulled the broom out and hit her face with the end of the handle. She kept smiling, like she didn't even mind that i was basically ready to turn her face into a bloody red rose. I menaged to get her deep back into the pipe and i hit her the final time with the broom into her neck, causing her to fall. I heard the sound of her falling right into the bin. 

I ran out of there back to my floor, a neighbor of mine was on his way to throw out the trash, he asked me what happened. I didn't want to tell him about the lady, i just told him that i saw a rat jump out of the chute and went back to my place. I didn't have any blood on me, it's almost like she never had any to begin with. I locked the door behind me, and went to the bathroom to wash my clothes and broom from the stench. My dog hid under the bed from my god awful smell, to be fair, i don't blame her. After what happened, i just had to lie down and distract myself with something, so for the rest of the day, i just played cards..

Apparently after i told the neighbour about rats, exterminators came for a visit. The line about the rat.. was not exactly a lie, we did have few rats running around near our house. And along with few actual rats.. the cleaning lady discovered the body in the bin under a few other bags of trash. Police came to investigate the case. Turned out that one of our residents disappeared recently, and.. apparently they found her corpse in the bin. They asked everyone if they knew the woman, even asked me, but i told them i didn't know her, but i did feel an unbearable smell coming from the garbage chute. Eventually they found the culrpit, the husband of the woman who lived on the fifth floor with her. He tried to fight and run away from house as soon as he got caught, but resistance was futile. I watched as he was getting taken away.. sad sight to behold. 

I only found out what actually happened in a newspaper i got in the mail box, we get these sometimes, i usually throw them away, but this time i got curious. The article talked about a murder of the man's wife, and how he revealed to the police that he tried to throw her body into the pipe. He put her in a bag and threw her down the pipe 5 days ago. As far as i remember, five days ago the pipe was filled with trash, so nothing could go down the pipe to the bin. Wanna hear something even more strange? When they got rid of all the trash in the first floor chute, they found not only all of my bags and my pizza box too, but also a huge torn bag that didn't have anything inside..
