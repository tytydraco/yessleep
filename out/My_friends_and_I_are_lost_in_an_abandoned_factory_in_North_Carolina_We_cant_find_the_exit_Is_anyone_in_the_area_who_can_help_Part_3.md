***also known as "Devorator Textiles"***  


Hey Reddit, it’s Mark the urban explorer again. This is the third part of an SOS post from 2009 on some old internet forum by someone with the username “DastardlyDan” on an old urban exploration site. I have to manually transcribe each one since the copy-and-paste doesn’t work so it’s kind of pain in the ass the get these up. This one took an especially long time; it’s the end of the year at the high school I work at so it’s been pure chaos out here. But on the bright side, soon I’ll have more free time! 



I’m planning my trip to the factory soon! Any advice or things you think I should look out for?



***Third post in the thread: July 9th, 2009***



Paul looked straight through me. Like I wasn’t even there. It was him, but it couldn’t be. 



Jackson stood in the doorway, careful not to enter the room so it didn’t change. He stood just as dumbfounded as me. 



“He was dead, right?” Jackson asked. He no longer carried his camera. There didn’t seem to be much of a point for him anymore. After he realized we had accidentally descended deeper into the factory, his eyes had no life in them, like he had given up. 



“You saw what I saw,” I responded, avoiding discussing it directly. “Do you think this is a ghost thing?” I asked him. 



“I mean, it’d make sense,” Jackson said, still staring at ‘Paul’ who had returned to the paperwork on the desk. 



I walked over and peered over his shoulder. The documents were blurry, like they were out of focus. Except for one thing. 



I could see the date.



I looked up at Jackson. “Welcome to 1928, I guess.”



He stood outside, looking at the textile machines and workers. “We haven’t time traveled. It’s like a movie. We’re watching something.”



He seemed to be intently watching a couple of the workers, a man and a woman. I stepped out of the office leaving it open. Even if it changed, it didn’t matter. It was creepy seeing Paul here. 



I watched him seize and bleed out on the ground ‘outside’. My head was swimming. Since coming into this factory I don’t know what has happened to me, but my thoughts feel loud, like they’re screaming at me. 



“Can we talk?” I nudged Jackson.



He shook his head. “Yeah, man.”



“What are we going to do?”



He looked at me with no light behind his eyes. “Wait for help, I guess. What can we do?”



“Let’s both go in the office and see what happens.”



I turned back to the office. Nothing had changed, surprisingly. ‘Paul’ still sat behind the desk, pouring over paperwork. We walked in, and I immediately closed the door. I noticed the paintings from before had no creepy details now, and just depicted a countryside and a party. 



I looked at Jackson, and opened the door.



Nothing had changed.



“So what exactly are the rules of this place?” I asked aloud. I knew there wasn’t an answer.



“I think we just have to stay here a while. Something tells me there’s something we’re supposed to see.”



We sat there for a moment, nothing really happening. The workers kept working, and ‘Paul’ continued scribbling on documents and throwing certain ones away. 



“It sucks we can’t go outside. What do you think was in that upstairs window?” Jackson said.



I suddenly remembered when we first arrived how Jackson claimed he saw something move in the factory. We had to break in, so there was no easy way in from what I could tell. 



“Probably a ghost. It’d make sense,” I explained.



“I don’t know. This didn’t feel like that. It felt like an animal or something. Something alive.”



“Dude, you just looked in an upstairs window and saw movement. It isn’t that serious.”



Suddenly Jackson looked pissed. “Look around us, man. What isn’t serious? I’m just trying to put it all together.”



“Maybe the puzzle has something to do with it,” I carefully said. 



“A date isn’t gonna help us.”



“The factory wants us to know dates. It’s the only detail I could see on Paul’s desk.”



We stood in silence for a moment, watching the workers.



“Do you think the answer is 1928?” I asked.



“The number of copies has something to do with it. I don’t think it’d be that obvious either.”



“What numbers were mentioned in the files?” I asked.



“Check your phone. Didn’t you take notes?” Jackson said, gesturing to my pocket.



I pulled it and found my notes. “The woman went missing for nine months. The company stayed open for ten years after the woman died. Workers were paid seven hundred dollars a year. The manager got paid thirty-six thousand. And there were thirty-one copies. Six packets of info as well. And all the numbers in the end of year report. And there’s a bunch of buildings in the factory. And the pages of the document. Among others.”



He sighed. “So there’s just too many possibilities?”



“For now. Maybe we’ll get more info. Something tells me we already have it, but we’ll see. I wrote down the formula.”



We sat there, still staring at the workers. 



“Do you wanna walk around, see if we find anything on them or something?” I asked. 



He shrugged and began walking over to the machines, weaving between them and stopping for a moment at each worker. I did the same.



They all seemed to just be normal people, working their jobs. Most of them were black, but that wasn’t necessarily unusual for this time period and this area, as I’m sure most of you know. Each had a Devorator Textiles logo. They were focused in on their work, not lifting their gaze. Occasionally someone would shout some kind of order or warning, things would pause for a moment, and then resume. We couldn’t really make out their speech. It sounded like we were hearing it from rooms away. 



“It’s so mechanical,” Jackson commented from between two workers. 



“I was thinking the same thing. It’s like they’re brainwashed or something,” I said, carefully stepping behind a worker weaving some kind of shirt or blouse. 



“They’re not brainwashed. They just seem fully committed to their work,” Jackson said. He was still watching the two workers. It was a man and a woman at some kind of machine with a rotating spool above it and a piece of fabric behind it above several smaller cylinders. They rotated mechanically, and pieces of something fell out of the cotton. 



I began making my way over towards Jackson when the machine stopped. The man walked over and began removing the fabric. Suddenly, as his fingers were between the cylinders, it wobbled and slowly began to crank up. The man shouted, his indeterminate yell echoing on the work floor, as he tried to get the fabric out without ripping. Many other workers looked up in his direction. The woman beside him raced behind the machine, seemingly trying to find some way to shut it off. Jackson stood on in horror, suddenly realizing what he was witnessing. He began to take a step back.



And that was when everything shifted. 



Suddenly, everything was crystal-clear. The strange, disconnected feelings we had from the scene were gone. It felt so vivid, like we were there.



And God, I wish we weren’t. 



Because at that moment, the man let out a guttural scream as his arm was pulled into the machine. The sickening crunch of bone against metal accompanied it like a sick drum beat. He screamed, nonstop, as his mangled arm lay between the cylinders, crushed to literal pieces. 



And the blood. Oh, God, the blood. It leaked out from beneath the machine, pooling quickly, touching the edges of Jackson’s shoes. He stumbled back and ran over to me, only ten feet away. The factory workers were still, The man slumped over, no longer screaming, with his eyes closed. The woman rushed to his side, screaming. 



“Someone help him! Call a doctor! Something!”



She began pulling him away from the machine, and with a wet tearing sound, his arm detached from his shoulder as he fell into her arms. We could see, just barely, her holding the man closely with her head buried in his chest. Whispers filled the room as she lifted her head and shrieked in anguish. The sound repeated over and over in our heads as the room began to stand still. The factory workers began to fade and the machines progressively began to look more and more decayed. The light from the windows faded as Jackson and I looked at each other from about six feet away.  



There were tears in his eyes and his teeth were gritted as a phantom wind began to swirl around us, stirring up dust and dirt on the ground into a sandy spiral around us.



“What’s happening, Dan?” Jackson yelled, trying to stumble over to me.  



I fell to my knees as the winds picked up. A numbness began to overtake me. 



“I think this is it,” I said quietly. 



Somehow, over the cacophony around us, he heard me. I could tell from his reaction. His face became more desperate and panicked than ever before. 



The wind swept him off his feet, carrying his feet into the air. He fell the ground, striking his head against the concrete, and laid on the floor. 



“Oh God, please don’t be dead, please don’t be dead,” I prayed as I began to crawl over to him in a panic. 



Then a piece of lumber hit me in the head and my vision went black. 



And then when we awoke, we were in some kind of board room, completely alone.



The room was silent.



We woke up at exactly the same time somehow. 



My head throbbed. I sat up and curled into the fetal position, placing my head behind my knees. 



“Holy shit,” Jackson muttered. 



I lifted my head. “Thank God you’re not dead.”



“Jesus, I almost wish I was with how much my head hurts,” he said chuckling, placing his back against the wall and his legs stretched out in front of him. 



I scooted over to him and assumed the same position. 



“So where are we now?” I asked, not really expecting an answer. 



Jackson looked around the room and his eyes settled on a window. Slowly, he stood up and walked over to it and peered outside. 



“I think this is the room I saw movement from,” Jackson said.



“No way,” I responded, standing up and walking over. My head hurt so bad that my vision went cross-eyed for a moment after I stood up, and I had to stumble around to regain my balance. 



I looked outside. We were definitely in an upper story window, and I could clearly see where we entered from. In fact, I could see our car and the smashed window. 



“Wait, does that mean…” I began, racing over to the doorknob. 



As I began to reach for it, my head began to hurt exponentially worse. I put my hand down and shook my head and tried again. I focused on the doorknob and tried to ignore the pain. The room began to fade from view as I focused on the doorknob. Freedom was on the other side.



Suddenly, Jackson shoved me. I blinked. There was something wet coming from my house. I brought my hand to my face and was horrified to see blood all over my shirt. I gingerly touched my face, and realized my nose had been bleeding. 



“Jesus Christ!” I screamed, flinging my hand and sending blood spraying. 



“Dude, chill,” Jackson said, bringing his hands to his face. “I think I got it figured out. We just gotta watch it play out. I think it has to do with the downfall of the factory.”



Suddenly, it hit me how obvious that was. The packets and documents, whatever the hell we just saw, us being trapped here in the first place.



The factory wanted us to see this. 



“What about the bird?” I suddenly asked. 



“What about it?” Jackson retorted. 



“What’s it’s connection to all of this? And we still haven’t figured out the puzzle.” I began pacing around the room. 



“Let’s just wait it out. I’m sure it’ll all come in time. Maybe…maybe this isn’t a bad thing.”



“Um, did you forget about Paul?” I suddenly yelled. Out of nowhere, I had a burst of rage.



“Paul didn’t follow the rules. That’s why he had to go,” Jackson said calmly, looking out the window yet again. 



I walked over and took a closer look at Jackson. His eyes were glazed over and an easy smile had crossed over his face.



“Hey man, you doin’ alright?” I asked, gingerly touching his shoulder. 



He shook his head and then beamed. “As good as I can be!”



I took a step back. This was all wrong. Something was seriously messed-up with Jackson. Maybe it was hitting his head or something. 



I sat down in a corner. I noticed the battery on my phone stopped going down, staying at 3%. 



I began typing this post.



If you’ve read this far, please come help us. We’re trapped in this room and if someone could just get to us, maybe there’s still hope. Maybe Jackson can get some help. Maybe…maybe Paul’s somehow still alive outside of this room. All we know is that we’re stuck here. 



Jackson is still staring out the window. He said we just have to wait in here until the next scene unfolds. I’ll post again soon.
