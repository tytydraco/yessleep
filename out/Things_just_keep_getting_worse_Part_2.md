July 21.

Ok I’ve compiled some more text for anyone who might come across my entries here. You can read my first little blurb here (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/YgNcpri3Wn)

So after that last interaction with Dave, I avoided him at all costs, as you can imagine. I had my dad come over and put an extra heavy duty lock on my entry door and check the locks on all my windows. We installed a Ring camera that shows me an area of my apartment including my entry door, most of my bed (a sleeper sofa that I only close if I have company), the kitchen area and part of the bathroom doorway. So I felt pretty good after that!

It was pretty much business as usual for the next couple weeks actually, until the first week of July. I was having trouble falling asleep one night, so I put the original Twilight Zone series on streaming. It’s my go-to comfort show to fall asleep to, and it usually takes less than an episode to put me out. I woke up at about 2:50am, to my TV blaring loud, on the episode about the camera that tells the future. I scrambled for the Firestick remote as I heard a thumping under my floor—Mrs. Lovetts with a broom, I guessed. I called down “I’m sorry!” as I grabbed the remote and got the volume back down. While I was panting and waiting for my heart rate to go back to normal, the volume started climbing again all the way back up, and the episode started skipping forward a few seconds at a time, making a horrible disorienting sound. I jumped up and unplugged the TV before anyone started banging on the ceiling again.

I had finally calmed down about a half hour later, praying to get some sleep before morning, when my land-line phone rang. YES, I know, no one has a land line anymore, and yes, my dad was probably being overprotective when he insisted we have one installed at the new place. But I have to say, it is nice, when my iPhone is low on battery or service, to know there’s another option. In the middle of the night, however, that old-fashioned ringing made me jump out of my skin. 

In an instant I realized it must be my dad calling (no one else knew the number really), and for him to call at 3:30 in the morning, it must be news of some horrible accident or death in the family. So I grabbed up the phone and said “Dad! Is everything ok?”

All I heard back was a series of clicks. I spoke again, “Are you ok? I can’t hear you!” I heard a few more clicks on the other side, almost like a clock ticking really loudly, except the sounds weren’t evenly spaced apart. For a split second the thought of Morse Code flashed in my mind, but I don’t know Morse Code so that was no help either way. I listened for a few more seconds, and was about to hang up when I heard a voice start to speak… but it was NOT my dad’s voice and it was speaking so fast I don’t even know what language it was in. I hung up quickly and unplugged the phone too.

So once again, I was harassed by an electronic device. Two, actually. My mind turned against Dave again. I hadn’t seen or heard from him since the day he was in my apartment, and I still had no reason to be suspicious, besides knowing he could probably hack these things easily if he was as great as IT as he boasted when I first met him. 

Here’s the problem. The next few things had nothing to do with technological devices. 

Skip forward to July 11th. After a week of being on edge after the Twilight Zone night, as I call it, I began to feel normal as things had been quiet since. I even had a few normal-feeling interactions with Dave, bullshitting about the horrible heat this summer and reflecting on some of our favorite childhood summertime memories. I didn’t bring up any of the stuff about my computer, phone or TV, although it was hard not to. I didn’t really have anyone else to confide in at the time, and it had begun to feel easy to talk to my across-the-hall neighbor. I guess I’m just a bit cynical at heart though, because something in me screamed to keep him at a safe distance still.

Anyway—July 11th. I finished my shift at 6pm as usual and started my walk home. It takes me about 20 minutes if I cut through the park, 30ish minutes if I don’t. That day I did. The park is relatively big, and usually pretty full of people, but when the Real Feel temp is pushing 100°, not so much. I was glad to be coming to the last part of the park path, where the sidewalk is lined with trees on both sides, making a canopy of leaves above you. It’s so much cooler in the shade. Darker too, though. And as I came around a curve in the sidewalk, I was nearly startled into pissing myself when a woman dressed entirely in black appeared in front of me. 

OH MY GOD it was like a scene out of Celebrity Ghost Stories, except it wasn’t a ghost. This lady was really standing here, for who knows how long before I nearly walked into her. She was wearing a long-sleeved, completely black, floor length dress. Her hair was shoulder-length, a bit messy, and totally gray. She had very light blue eyes, and the type of facial features that obscure age—she could’ve been a younger-looking 60 or an older-looking 40, or somewhere in between. It took me a few seconds to take in the whole image. It was much too hot to be wearing what she was, and I was taken back by the look in her eyes.

I stumbled back a little and got out, “oh, excuse me” with a small nervous chuckle. She blinked but didn’t say anything. I looked for words, and a way around her on the path. “Kinda warm out!” I felt really awkward until she started to speak to me. She said, “You have the color on you,” which took me by such surprise that I couldn’t answer. She continued, “You have the color… you need peace… you will not have peace…”

That really creeped me out. Partly because she was right, I did need peace after those incidents at home; but also because I had been feeling like that stuff was done and past, and now I felt like I was wrong about that. Then she turned around to face away from me, took a breath, and started to loudly chant or yell or something in a language I don’t know, but (upon reflection later), sounded similar to the voice on the phone the week before.

I ran right past her and the rest of the way out of the park, and all the way home. By the time I got inside and locked all my doors I was drenched in sweat. I have no explanation for who or what the hell that was.

I’m gonna leave it there since this entry is already so long. I’ll tell you the rest the next time I have an hour or two to get it all down.
