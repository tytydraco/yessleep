I'm not sure if anyone will see this, but I feel like I need to share my story. My name is Owen, and I'm a teenage camper. I grew up in a small town in Southern California, and I've always loved spending time in the great outdoors. My parents were big hikers and campers, and they passed their love of nature down to me.

I had always wanted to go on a solo camping trip, and I finally convinced my parents to let me go. They were a little hesitant at first, but I promised them that I would be careful and follow all the necessary safety precautions. After a lot of convincing, they finally agreed.

I did my research and decided on Mendocino National Forest as my destination. It was a beautiful, secluded area that was known for its stunning wilderness and abundance of wildlife. I packed my backpack with all the essentials - a tent, sleeping bag, flashlight, water bottle, and enough food and supplies to last me a few days. I also brought my phone and a small speaker for some background music.

I arrived at the forest on July 3rd, 2021. The sun was shining, and everything seemed normal. I parked my car at the designated camping area and set up my tent in a clearing near a small stream. I spent the day exploring the woods, marveling at the beautiful trees and the wildlife that surrounded me. I saw plenty of deer, and the forest was alive with the sounds of birds and small animals.

But as day turned to night back at camp, the forest began to fall silent. The crickets stopped chirping, and the only sounds were the crunching of leaves under my feet as I sat on the ground and the distant howling of a wolf. Feeling creeped out by the sudden silence, I went inside my tent and tried to ignore it and focus on my dinner, an MRE that I had brought from home.

But as I was eating, I heard something calling my name. It was a faint, whispery voice, and it seemed to be coming from the tree line. I froze, my heart racing in my chest. I tried to stay calm and think logically. Maybe it was just the wind, or some other animal. But as I listened, the voice grew louder and more insistent. It was definitely saying my name, and it sounded like it was trying to lure me out of the tent. I was terrified and questioned my psychological state. Had the isolation cause me to hallucinate? Or was this some kind of  prank by other campers who somehow got my name?

I was terrified, but I knew I had to stay put. I zipped up the tent and huddled in my sleeping bag, trying to force myself to sleep and to block out the voice. But as the night wore on, the howling grew louder and more frenzied. I couldn't sleep, and I was starting to feel like I was being watched.

That's when it happened. I felt a sudden sense of heaviness wash over me, and I knew I was in the grip of sleep paralysis. I couldn't move or speak, and all I could do was lay there, helpless, as the creature approached the tent. I could hear it scratching at the fabric, trying to find a way in. And then, I felt it trying to unzip the tent. As it attempted to unzip the tent, I could hear and smell the thing's breathing, a putrid stench that made my eyes water. Its claws were scraping against the fabric, trying to find a way in.

I don't know how long it lasted, but eventually, it walked away, dragging its feet across the ground. The paralysis lifted and I was able to break free. I stumbled out of the tent feeling the cold air on my face just for it to be standing behind my tent, peeking behind a tree and staring back at me with glowing yellow eyes. My heart pounded in my chest as I took in its twisted, humanoid form, covered in slimy, black fur, its face like that of a man but disfigured and animalistic in nature. I turned and ran the opposite direction through the forest, not looking back until I was sure I was safe.

But the creature didn't give up that easily. It followed me, stalking me through the woods as if it was planning its next move. I could hear its voice now guttural, calling my name, and I could feel its presence lurking behind me, and I could smell its stench growing stronger as it drew closer.


 I was terrified, and It knew that. I had to find a way to scare it off. That's when I remembered the music on my phone. I had connected it to a speaker that I had brought from home, and I had left it on mute back at camp. I didn't know if it would work, but I figured it was worth a shot.

I grabbed my phone and turned up the volume as high as it would go. The music blared through the forest, and the creature let out a bloodcurdling scream. It retreated into the darkness, towards the music.

I made it out of the forest just as the sun was rising, and I collapsed on the side of the road, completely exhausted. I was found by a park ranger a few hours later, and he took me back to Fort Bragg. He was shocked and disturbed by my story, and he told me that I had actually been missing for 12 days and discovered 8 miles away from my camp, not a few hours as I was led to believe with search and rescue discovering my tent in ruin.

 With my foot prints from my tent disappearing as I left my camp. and the scent dogs not picking up anything he went on to tell me that there have been other cases like mine in the forest. People disappearing without a trace, never to be seen again, typically people who go alone or are separated from their group. The park ranger explained that they paused the search due to heavy rain fall after my disappearance.

He said that there are things in the forest that are beyond human understanding, and that we should be careful when we venture into the wilderness. He gave me a stern warning not to go back to the forest alone.

I took his warning to heart, and I vowed to never go camping by myself again. I don't know what happened to the creature that stalked me, but I can only assume that it's still out there, lurking in the shadows and waiting for its next victim. I'll never forget that night in the forest, and I hope that my story serves as a warning to others. Be careful, and always be prepared for the unexpected.

As I left the forest and returned to my normal life,
I never told anyone else about my experience in the forest, the police told the media that I simply got lost on the wrong trail. but I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something more to it. I began to research the history of the area, and I discovered that there have been numerous reports of mysterious disappearances and strange occurrences in the forest over the years. Some people believe that there is an ancient, supernatural force at work in the woods, preying on unsuspecting travelers, While others simply believe thereâ€™s a drug operation.

I don't know if I believe in any of this, but I do know that I'll never take the forest for granted again. I'll always be careful and stay alert, just in case. The forest is a beautiful and mysterious place, but it can also be dangerous.
