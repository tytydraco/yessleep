Before I get started on my story, have any of you ever heard of Mr. Men & Little Miss. For those of you who haven't, it's a book series that features many anthropomorphic creatures who represent different aspects of human aspects. The book series statted with a man named Roger Hargreaves, a British cartoonist who, after being asked by his son, Adam Hargreaves, what does a Tickle look like, wrote and illustrated the first installment of the Mr. Men & Little Miss books: Mr. Tickle. The story exploded with popularity, that he followed it up with Mr. Greedy, which was soon followed by Mr. Happy, and so on. After a while, Roger began writing the first installment of the Little Miss series: Little Miss Bossy, a Little Miss whose bossy mannerisms are that of a drill Sergeant.

After his death, Roger's son, Adam, took on his legacy and continued the books, now having the characters go on all sorts of wacky adventures. The books proved so popular that it spawned two Television series: Mr. Men & Little Miss, and The Mr. Men Show. Due to their rising popularity, a company known as Endeavor Content wanted to make a series based on the children's book series. They said it would be out sometime in 2023. Unfortunately, it never came. Well, I can tell you why. You see, I used to work at Endeavor Content. However, recent events caused me to quit. Allow me to explain.

It all started with the cancelation of the Mr. Men Show. You've probably heard the reason of the show's cancelation. The series producers said they didn't want to continue. The reasons for this were never given, but I know exactly why. You see, the Mr. Men Show changed a lot of things with the book characters, such as their personalities, their designs, and even their own genders (some original characters were even made to make it more interesting). Adam didn't like these changes. He constantly demanded that the series producers to cease their discretion of his father's work at once. Everybody just pushed him aside and continued their work.

That's when Strange things began to happen. For a small few instances, some scenes in the US dub were mysteriously cut from the UK dub, some scenes that were planned for the show were unable to be digitally animated, and in some rare occasions, the voice actors reported seeing the characters they voice in their own dreams. The events got so bizarre that they ultimately decided to cooperate with Adam Hargreaves and canceled the series. Despite being a cult classic, the Stagg were deeply unnerved by the curse it carried. When Endeavor Content decided to create their own show starring the titular characters, it seemed that the curse was reignited.

Some things were made to spice up the show a bit: Mr. Noisy and Little Miss Chatterbox would be in a romantic relationship, Little Miss Sunshine, Mr. Happy, and Mr. Cheerful would have a love triangle,, Mr. Bump would have depression from being in so many accidents, and Mr. Tickle would be the youngest Mr. Man in all of Misterland (those are just the more interesting ones). As production began, accidents began to happen. Ventilation would act up, people would end up mysteriously injured, and blackouts would periodically occur within the studio. There was one particular experience that crossed the line. I was animating a scene with Little Miss Star and Mr. Perfect performing a duet on a variety show episode. I kept looking back at my reference sheet to be sure I had the proportions correct.

Suddenly, the lights began to flicker. This mildly annoyed me, but luckily, there were some spare light bulbs in the storage closet. I walked out the animation department and entered the hallway. As I walked towards the storage closet, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was being watched. After what felt like hours, I finally found some spare bulbs and returned to the animation studios. Entering inside, I dropped the spare bulb. There, scribbling on my animation was a crudely made Mr. Tickle costume. What made it even more chilling was the fact it was in the same style as our show's version of the character. It was as if Mr. Tickle had jumped out of the show's pages and entered out reality. It looked at me, and the costume blinked. Not the person inside, the costumes eyes actually blinked. Next thing I knew, the lights flickered, and it was gone. I found myself writing my resignation papers in a heartbeat.

I don't know what we did to anger Adam this time, but one thing is clear, if you want a Mr. Men & Little Miss Show made, be sure it suits Adam's standards. Otherwise, you might fall victim to it's curse like I did.
