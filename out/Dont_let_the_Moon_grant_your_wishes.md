The year was 2002. I was a young man who had become detached from a tour group in the midst of the Australian Outback. After a few hours, I started to succumb to dehydration. I was envisioning a plodding, laboured death in the heart of nowhere, but that didn’t happen. It seemed like a mirage, but \*the Moon spoke to me\*. Looking upon me with far-flung craters, which felt like remote eyes, the talking rock said it could save me. I followed a misty, moonlit trail across the arid landscape, and I eventually stumbled onto the town I’d been trying to find.

Later that night, in my hotel bed, the Moon called to me. It offered three wishes. I rushed to the window, confused as to how my replenished body, now fed and watered, could still be hallucinating. And yet, I somehow knew that it was real. I knew the Moon had saved me from the desert. *What do I have to lose by making some wishes to find out?*

So, I wished for three things:

1. Money
2. Safety
3. Health

The creature had many conditions, but I heeded the warnings from ever story I’d ever been told about both genial and ghoulish genies. The Moon made the parameters of its wish-granting quite clear.

*No wishing for more wishes.*

*No wishing for more wish-granters.*

*No wishing for things to give to other people.*

*No wishing for anything that would contradict the laws of your natural realm.*

The ideal wishes seemed obvious.

**Money.**

More money than anyone could ever need. Obviously, I couldn’t shower loved ones with wealth. I kept my job to support my family, but I used the riches to support my own needs.

*There’s always a catch with wishing. Becoming the wealthiest man on earth will make me a target.*When I realised that, I had the idea for my second wish.

**Safety.**

I was not asking for security beyond the laws of nature. I simply wanted assurance that my financial safety net, if it were ever discovered, would be protected.

*But what about security against the passage of time? I can’t wish for immortality… I can employ the world’s greatest doctors, of course, but that’s not enough.*

**Health.**

I specified to the Moon that I was simply talking about safeguards which would abide by the laws of nature. For example, if I had a genetic proclivity towards developing certain diseases, either physical or mental, perhaps the wish-granter could provide a cure. Perhaps the Moon could simply conjure a cure for *every* ailment that could ever face a human being.

The rock conceded that, even if there were no current cure for certain illnesses, it *could* provide a solution for every health problem that might befall a human being. The Moon couldn’t make me live forever, but it could ensure that I live for an absurdly long time.

I thought I’d covered all of the bases. I truly believed I’d outsmarted some sort of deity. I was a fool. I never should’ve made *any* wishes, but I *certainly* shouldn’t have made the third wish.

Twenty years after my Australian encounter, my wealthy and healthy life took a sour turn. The Moon ensured that there would always be a cure in place for any ailment I would face. It had abolished my mental illness, thanks to a wondrous pill that I wasn’t permitted to share with others. So, this November, I wasn’t phased when my doctor gave a harrowing diagnosis.

“Congestive heart failure,” The woman tentatively said.

*Not to worry*, I thought. *The wish-granter will fix it. It gave me a pill for my mental well-being, and I’m sure it’ll give me a new heart, too. Perhaps it’ll simply grow one for me.*

I waited.

Like a werewolf in a kennel, I howled at the unresponsive moon for attention.

Nothing.

After weeks without solution, I started to feel consumed by dread. *Has it forgotten about me? The wishes were supposed to apply for the rest of my life.*

Then, one night, the Moon arrived. It didn’t speak from the sky, this time. It spoke from the darkness of my house. A floorboard groaned in the far corner of the living room. Heart thumping rhythmically against my ribcage, I found myself staring into the depths of my lounge’s darkened corner. Something was watching me. The direful creature I hadn’t seen for twenty years. It had no eyes or discernible shape, but it had awful white lips, which glowed like a deformed moon in the night sky.

Fear gripped me.

“It’s you,” I croaked.

“I am sorry,” The creature wheezed. “You do not have much time.”

“There’s a waiting list for heart transplants, but I thought you’d have some means of speeding things up,” I replied, trembling at the hidden thing in the corner of my room.

“Yes. I *must* grant your desire. It is my only purpose,” The Moon mouth maliciously whispered. “A wish is a contract. I will find a heart for you.”

Before the creature evaporated, its white, lifeless lips curled upwards into a malevolent grin. The almost-human expression filled me with a feeling of terror which cannot sufficiently translate to words.

Suddenly, I realised the dread in my heart was more than dread. *Oh, no*, I thought, as I clutched my chest. *It’s happening.* An invisible blade twisted into my heart, and I felt my body seize. Blackness swallowed my surroundings. My vision faded. *Just one more time*, I remember thinking. *Let me see Wendy and Maisie one more time.*

When I woke, I was in a hospital room. My chest felt light. It was the healthiest I’d felt in weeks. Wendy was sitting at my bedside, tears flooding her vacant eyes, and a smile was forcefully painted on her pale face.

“You’re awake,” My wife whispered.

I smiled. “Hello, sweetheart. I must’ve given you a scare. I feel much better now, though.”

She sobbed and squeezed my hand with tremendous strength. There was love in that squeeze, but there was also rage. Inconsolable *rage*.

“They did it, honey. They gave you… They… You…” She moaned like a wounded animal. “You have a new heart.”

That explained the lightness in my chest, but it didn’t explain the fear on my wife’s face. Her agonised expression haunted me. *Why is she so distraught?* I wondered, shuddering.

“Wendy…” I whispered. “What’s-“

“- Maisie,” My wife interrupted, now bawling. “This evening, she was in an accident. She… She… She didn’t…”

Wendy didn’t need to finish any of her sentences. I knew what had happened to my daughter. I knew whose heart was in my chest.

I knew what the Moon had done to grant my wish.
