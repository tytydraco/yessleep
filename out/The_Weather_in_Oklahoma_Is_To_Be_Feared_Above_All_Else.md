This happened to me when I was a little kid. I moved to Oklahoma when I was about 6 years old. I was pretty young at the time, but I remember it well because my mom and dad had gotten a divorce. And it wasn't one of those cordial, "let's still be friends" kind of divorces. It was the crying and getting drunk, hitting each other, screaming arguments in the middle of the night, parents-trying-to-pit-you-against-each-other, throwing plates at the wall, ugly custody battle kind of divorces.

My mom ultimately gained full custody of me, and rather easily too, because my dad was a drunk. She wanted to get the hell of Ohio as fast as humanly possible after. I'm not sure of the details, but she got some job down south in Oklahoma. We packed our shit and were on the road in less than a month.

We moved to a small town, I forget the name now. Was about a 50 minute drive to OKC. Real small place, maybe three, four thousand people. All I remember is green trees and fields, red soil and rotting roadkill, and the sticky humidity. If you've never lived in Oklahoma and you suddenly move there, the humidity is killer. The air just sticks to you like some kind of lotion you can't wipe away. Like someone has rubbed your entire body in vasoline or vaporub, put you back into your clothes, and you now can't get it off. I don't remember a whole lot about life in Oklahoma, except for some memories of school. A few birthday parties I went to. Mundane little kid stuff.

I do remember Tornado Season though. I remember it really fu>!cking!< clearly too because some crazy shi>!t !<went down when I was a kid. If you live under a rock and have never heard of Tornado Alley, here's how it works:

Every year massive air masses slam into each other in the Central US and produce violent storms. The air is moving because of the changing seasons, and hot air from the Caribbean slams into cold air coming southwards out of Canada. The Central US is situated just perfectly to allow these air masses to hit and they form violent and very large thunderstorms with rotational spin.

What results? Tornadoes, and a lot more of them than anyone should ever be okay with. Oklahoma has the lucky position of being the location with the most active tornadoes per capita on the planet. It hits its peak in April and May, and its a genuinely dangerous time for everyone. Your local weatherman becomes a hero, and everyone gets glued to their TV screens. A lot of people down there are pretty used to it, so they don't really fear them like they probably should. A lot of people go out to watch tornadoes, and the really brave and stupid ones go chasing after them.

So it's the first year that we are in Oklahoma, and its the middle of April. I remember that because the teacher I had had a calendar and there was this big old bunny rabbit and Easter eggs on it, and it was all pink. I was at school, and the teacher told us that we had to be extra careful today and remember our tornado drills. I remember they'd have us go out into the hallway and curl into a fetal position while sirens went off in the school. I thought we were gonna have another drill again, but actually the day went by without much incident. Teacher was checking her computer a lot, and I remember there was a radar screen up and some anchorman speaking.

The school day ended and my mom picked me up. She had the radio on and I remember the station had regular add breaks with updates about the weather, and how there was a high risk for tornadoes that day. I asked my mom what a tornado was because I had never seen one before. She explained to me what they were and how they could be really dangerous but that we'd be okay if one happened near us because we had a shelter we could go to. We lived in a small shack of a place at the time, and we shared an underground shelter with our immediate neighbors, because our house had no basement. We got home and my mom made some dinner. While I ate she sat down at the dining room table and started looking through some kind of paperwork.

It was a pretty typical evening for us until the sirens went off. They blared, and for a six year old kid, they were terrifying. Tornado sirens have this ethereal, almost ghost-like noise to them. They blare really loud and go up and down in pitch this really long and unsettling way. I suppose they are designed on purpose to unnerve you, to let you know something is wrong. If you've never head them before I recommend you look them up on YouTube to get a sense of what I'm talking about. Take that sound and make a little kid listen to it outta nowhere when they've never heard it before.

It was nighttime kinda early-ish in the evening by this point, 'cause the sun still wasn't rising all that early because it wasn't summer yet. Six-year-old me is covering his ears while my mom gets up right away and turns on the TV. The weatherman was on every station and it was a local emergency broadcast. Apparently we had a massive severe thunderstorm headed our way and it had spawned one or two tornadoes. They were advising us to take shelter. My mom grabs my hand and starts walking me to the front door so we can get to the neighbor's shelter across the street when she stops dead in her tracks.

She lets go of my hand and has this really puzzled look on her face. It was dark, but the sky was perfectly clear. We could actually see the moon and stars out. The wind was pretty strong, but besides the sirens going off, pretty clear. She steps outside, looking around, and I followed her onto the porch. She's looking out into the distance at the horizon. There are these pitch black clouds coming in, not very small from our viewpoint because they were several miles off, but you could see them lighting up like crazy with lightning. And all you could hear was the trees swaying and the wind rustling the shutters, and some wind-chimes going ham, all the while the sirens going off in the distance. She takes my hand again and we walk across the street to our neighbor's house, and knock on the door. There isn't any answer, so my mom tries again, knocking harder this time.

The whole time I keep looking at those clouds. It was like watching a snail slowly move across a surface. It was slow, but it was growing in size, and the lightning in the clouds was this eerie blue and white. It was like some kind of strobe light. All the time the wind is getting stronger, and gusts start knocking over some lawn chairs. The neighborhood was silent, and I noticed you couldn't hear any birds out or crickets chirping, just dead silent except for the wind and the sirens. My mom is tired of knocking at the door and drags me over to the side of the neighbor's house to where there cellar doors are at. They had one of those classic cellar doors, like kind you see Dorothy get into in the Wizard of Oz, but they were locked. My mom starts tugging on them to get them to open up, and she's shouting for the neighbor's to let us in, and that she's got her kid with her. But there's just no response and after a few minutes my mom gives up. They were the only people we knew, and so she tries a few other houses, dragging me along, but basically the same thing happens.

All the while the storm is clearly coming in, and the wind is picking up speed. We were starting to hear the sounds of thunder rumbling, coming in one after the other. Every once in a while the sky would illuminate only to be crashed into darkness again followed by the deep guttural crack of thunder. At this point its pretty obvious we are fucked, and not getting into any shelter. So my mom rushes us back home and goes into the living room. The weatherman is going on about how the storm is huge and that people need to take shelter. 70mph winds and 120mph wind gusts. The storm doesn't seem to have reached us yet, but the wind just gets stronger and stronger outside. I can tell because the trees and bending over more and more with each passing of the wind. The branches flailed about like drunken man's arms, and every so often they were lit up by the lightning. Our windows are rattling and you can hear this whistling noise as the wind licks away at the looser seems of our windows managing to get in.

My mom has this really worried expression on her face. Suddenly we get a Tornado Warning on the TV, with the loud bleeps of the Emergency Broadcast System. The robotic voice tell us that a tornado warning was issued for our area, to seek shelter immediately, and if we couldn't, to get to the lowest area of our house. The weatherman comes back on and he's speaking enthusiastically about rotation in the storm. My mom holds me tight to her, and all the while the wind is just getting stronger and stronger.

Sometimes these really powerful gusts would hit, and the trees outside would stretch into these impossible shapes. Then the rain started. It was really, really heavy. Like heavier than you've ever seen. So heavy that the windows were totally obscured and all you could see was a blur of colors and flashing blue light. The lightning is going off at this point literally every few seconds, and the thunder is coming in rapid succession. It sounds so loud outside that we start to struggle to hear the television. The lamps hanging from our living room ceiling are ever so slightly swaying as this is all going on.

The weatherman is going on and on. And then power goes suddenly goes out and we are left in pitch blackness. I let out some scream and my mom told me to shush and patted my back. How it's all right and we'll be okay. I'm look at the windows, which are now our only source of light. Thunder is booming and making the whole house shake. The rain was hitting our windows like bullets.

We are sitting there in the dark with the lightning strobing when we hear this low wailing sound. At first I thought it was the sirens again, but I had noticed they went silent when the power died. We look at our windows and we see this shadowy figure appear with the lightning. It was there one second then gone the next. I wasn't sure if I had actually seen anything, but it was really distinct even with the blurring of the windows by the heavy rain. My mom gets up from the couch and goes to the window. It's usually a pretty bad idea to get near the windows when you're in a storm like this one, but the shadowy figure had appeared again. The next moment it was gone.

"I think it's just a deer." she told me.

We can hear something scraping up against the side of our house. And the weird wailing is just getting worse and more loud. My mom turns to me and tells me we need to get into the center of the house. Her back is turned from the window, and I can see the lightning illuminating the window again for a split second. The figure is back, and it's huge. It knocks on our window. My mom turns to look at the window when everything goes dark again. The house lights up again, and its gone. A huge boom of thunder goes off.

Light again. There are two figures at the window. I couldn't really tell their shapes with the rain pouring down. The blur distorted their dark silhouettes like a kaleidoscope, so I couldn't tell what they were. We start to hear banging on the side of the house. It's dark now and we can hear thunder. You couldn't really be sure it if it was hail falling or if it was the rain or maybe you were just mishearing things with all the activity outside. But I swear I could hear banging like someone was trying to get into our house. I yell at my mom that I think it's someone who needs help.

She lifts her head up as the house lights up again. She sort of sat there thinking about what she should do. The banging is getting louder, and the wailing is starting to sound more and more like screaming. She gets up off the floor and goes slowly up to the window near our front door. She puts her face up to it slowly but carefully. Then there's this huge bang on our door. My mom jumps at the sound, and stands there kind of shaking for a bit. The lightning hits again, and my mom can see out of the window onto our front porch. I don't know what she saw, but she gasps. She ran into the living room, grabbing my arm and telling me to we need to go into her bedroom. We get there and you can hear the banging outside, echoing the banging of the rain on our house. We can hear muffled screaming.

My mom was has a window in her room, and I can see the lightning peaking through the curtains. My mom is holding me at this point, faced away from the window. There's a flash and then darkness. There's a flash and this hideous face is illuminated by the lightning. Whenever I think about this I really just hope it was my young mind tricking me, or maybe that I was remembering it wrong. But this face is pressed up against the window. It was some guy, or what I think was a guy. It had bluish skin, and I remember its face was all cut up, bloody, and sagging, like it was rotting. It had no lips, just teeth, and his nose was missing. Its eyes were the worst part. They bulged out of its skull and were touching our window. It had his hands next to it on the window pane, pressing its disgusting teeth on the window. It opened its mouth and the wailing sound came out, louder than ever. I screamed.

My mom turns to look at the window, but the lightning is gone at this point, and the room was plunged back into darkness. I can hear the rumble of thunder. Then I hear our window break. Rain comes instantly pouring into the room, cold wind rushing in at us. My mom scrambles in the dark to get me to the hallway. We can hear something scrambling in the dark. There is this rasping noise, with ragged breathing. I can't tell if it's my mom or something else. Its still pitch black, and I feel around the hallway for my mom. I touch her arm, but it was all wrong. She felt ice cold and wet. Something sticky is on it and her skin feels rough and full of bumps.

The lightning flashes again and I can see it isn't my mom. The thing that had been at our window is crouching there and I withdraw my hand in an instant. I scream again and my mom suddenly pushes me away from the thing. The thing wails and the house goes dark again. I hear my mom screaming and telling the thing no. No, not my baby. The house lights up like a bad rave. I see my mom struggle with the thing. One moment in a position like a photograph, and the next instant in another position. She tells me to run. I hear her screaming as crawl my way out of the hallway.

My eyes are filled with tears and I crawl into a nearby closet. The house lights up and goes dark on and off. I close the doors and I'm left in darkness. Only the occasional burst of light from the lightning leaks through the slits in the closet. I hear my mom struggling and screaming. I hear the raspy breathing and I can hear something ripping. My mom is screaming over and over again. The air is fucking thick and humid. I can feel the air sticking to my nostrils. I'm covered in sweat and raindrops. It's so oppressively sticky and hot. Like someone took a wet towel and forced me to wear it as a shirt. I sit with my knees under my chin, wrapping my arms around my legs, looking up at the slits in the closet doors. My mom has stopped screaming. The storm is somehow getting worse outside. The rain is beating down harder than ever and the wind is whipping around. I can hear the trees outside snapping their branches. And worst of all, I can hear that ragged breathing, slowly moving its way up the hall.

It's so dark now. I can't even see my hand in front of my face. But that thing, it knows I'm in here. I can hear its wheezing outside the doors. I cover my mouth to stop it from hearing my breathing. The lightning lights up the hallway and I can see it's shadow right in front of me. Then I hear this rumbling. A deep rumbling that shakes the entire house. Then I hear what I can only describe as sounding like a train. In an instant the house is thrown into chaos. The walls are ripped from around me. I watch helplessly as one wall falls down nearby and as our roof is flung over a hundred feet away. Everything is debris and shrapnel and wind. I get hit with stinging rain and slaps of wind. I see a log from a nearby tree fly off towards me and then after that I see nothing.

I remember waking up to a rescue worker carrying me. He tells someone else that I'm alive. I manage to murmur out about my mom. They tell me she's okay and not to worry. I'm loaded onto a gurney and taken to a nearby hospital. I had a broken arm, but other than that and some bruising and scratches I'm alright. My mother did not fair so well. Her arm had all of the skin it completely ripped off. It had exposed all the muscles and veins in her arm. The doctor commented about how perfectly skinned it was. She had managed to avoid any major injuries. As you can probably guess, a tornado had hit our house dead on. The doctors said that tornadoes are so powerful they can rip the skin of peoples and animals. Many farmers have reported their dead cows it by tornadoes skinned alive just like my mom's arm was.

Our house was totaled. We didn't get back to it for several weeks, but there was nothing left of our neighborhood. Just rubble and broken wood and glass. And our neighbors had been out of town at the time of the storm. All of them. They had all claimed they were on a business trip, or that they had visited someone else or were stuck at work and couldn't make it home. My mom got into a big argument with one of our neighbors over the basement being locked. Dude claimed he had never given us permission and that it wasn't his fault we couldn't get in. That was a straight-up lie, 'cause he had promised us we could use it. Oklahomans are known for being pretty nice, and I wanna believe our neighbors are all telling the truth. But I'm just not sure I trust them.

It seems awfully convenient for all of them to leave just before the storm. Of course their own houses had been largely destroyed too, except for a few very lucky neighbors of ours. One neighbor had his house missed by a few meters. The tree in his yard was ripped and torn to shreds though. A few neighbors had lost their animals. Some had their skin torn off too, while others were mutilated horribly. I had my arm in a sling for the rest of the time we were in Oklahoma. We ended up moving again a few months after everything. We must have gotten some kind of financial help or something. We moved back to Ohio and stayed with family.

I think back a lot about what happened to me as a kid in Oklahoma. I'm not sure what I saw or what happened to us. I'm not sure if I hallucinated the whole thing or if it's my traumatized memories distorting to make me think the storm was a monster of some kind. When I try to talk to my mom about the experience though she immediately refuses to talk about it. She says it's too much for her, and we should just be grateful we survived the storm. We lost everything that day, she says.

I think about how some of the people in our town didn't make it. Some had been killed by debris, while others were ripped to shreds like the cows. I've read a few articles about the tornado, and its pretty famous. It eventually went on to hit Moore, a downtown area of Oklahoma City. It hit people's houses directly. A lot of people died or lost their houses. I know tornadoes are incredibly strong but sometimes I have a hard time believing a tornado can kill people like that. Rip them to shreds. Drain them of their blood. Skin them alive.

Luckily here in Ohio tornadoes are a lot rarer than in Oklahoma. They do happen, so we do have to watch out for them sometimes. My friends tell me I have irrational fear of them. As soon as I get a hint that we have a risk day I go into my basement and don't come out. Maybe it is irrational. But I'm not taking any chances. I don't know what happened to us. I don't know what that thing was. I don't know what was in that storm.

But I'm not planning on finding out anytime soon.
