It is grotesque. That is the only way I could describe it. A vision of hell. It was a painting, if you could call it that. 

Red smeared darkness as a background and what I can only assume was supposed to be a demon. It was  gnawing on the stomach of a naked person who’s face twisted with horror. One of those medieval paintings about hell that make you want to start going to church.

I remember the first time my wife hung it in the foyer and after a brief protest upon its existence, I realized there was no use in fighting it being hung.

“It is a keepsake!” She would exclaim

Whatever that means. I could hardly stand to look at it. 

But what bothered me the most is how my wife would stare at it. As though it was her first and true love. Admiring its handiwork more than anything I dare try to create to match. 

I even attempted to paint my own oil canvas with red and black but she refused to acknowledge it even after several attempts.

“I know what you’re trying to do” she’d say, “we are not getting rid of that painting! It’s a keepsake.”

“It gives me bad vibes, Margo,” I continued, “I don’t know how to explain it but it makes me sick.”

“You’re being over dramatic,” she quipped 

“Where did you even get it? A slaughterhouse? Is that even red paint?” 

She giggled, “it’s a keepsake!”

I started to think it was a bad joke. Every time I would enter or leave there it was, and oftentimes, there was my wife marveling at it. 

I can’t place the time she must have gotten the painting or maybe she kept it a secret, but one snowy rotten cold day it was heaved onto the wall to my dismay.

“You really shouldn’t find it creepy…” laughed Margo, “it likes your skin!”

“Stop it!” I shuddered

There was something about this image. No matter the time of day or light on the image: it always seemed to be visible like shadows feared crossing it.

Almost a full year and after one unusually heated argument on its mere placement, I finally got up the courage to scowl deeply at the smudge work she seemed to obsess over.

“She must have paid a pretty penny for you” I started, “because I cannot fathom what she sees in you.”

I followed the longest red paint smear from left to right, scouring for any hint of value when the paint seemed to drip. 

“That must be it, it’s an optical illusion” I said triumphantly, “or I’ve gone mad…” 

I reached out to touch the paint that dripped and it felt wet and actually stuck to my finger. As I looked upon my red stained finger tip I felt wind ripple by as if someone had passed me and even saw a shadow out of the corner of my eye. 

Before I glanced behind me, I first looked up towards the painting. Somehow the movement seemed to come from it. 

“Must be too much moisture in the room” said my wife from behind me as I almost hit the ceiling in fright, “I’ll go turn off the humidifier.”

“O-Okay” I stuttered.

I, for some reason, was still facing the painting. As if there was still more to see. As if I was afraid to now turn my back to it.

I avoided the foyer altogether. Even going as far as to leave out the garage even if I was not taking the car out. 

My wife’s obsession seemed to become more obscene, also. She had moved her art supplies into the foyer so she could work in front of it, but everytime I would peek around the corner at her, she was simply staring at the atrocity she called art.

“It inspires me,” she said


After several weeks, I asked where her finished pieces were going. She told me she was selling them up before she even finished them. All commissions. I asked her what the commissions were of and she replied,

“Portraits. All of them from photographs.”

I finally built up the courage one day to call her bluff. After she had left to go on an errand upon my request, I went into the foyer. 

My heart raced as I approached her easels and brush stand. First, I found the photographs the commissions would be based on. After much inspection, however, I could not find any paintings except for the one still on the easel.

The easel was still covered but I slowly removed its covering. Underneath was a pastel painting of a man’s torso with no background. 

As I stared at it, I noticed the shirt on the torso was red like mine and even the body type was somewhat-

The phone rang.

It was a lady on the other end. She said,
“Hello, how do you do? I responded to your advertisement on pastel portraits and I have yet to receive my commission yet. It has been several weeks and I was promised it would be finished yesterday.”

“Well, that’s odd. I am not the artist but the artist is my wife and I-“

The woman interrupted with a gasp.

“I’m sorry,” she stuttered “something is staring into my kitchen window.”

“Something?” I asked

“Y-yes” she sounded shooken up

“Are you okay?”

No response on the other line. 

“Hello?” I said, but when there was no response for a minute I hung up.

My wife returned home, and before I could ask her about the woman’s painting, she was already sitting down to paint.

“I have a lot of commissions to finish,” she said exasperated

I left her to finish, and assumed she must have to finish the commission the woman spoke of.

Later that night, as the moon became shrouded in dark clouds I heard something coming from the foyer.  

The mere existence of the painting made me weary so I cautiously crept to the stairs to peer into the room where it hung. 

There stood my wife covered in paint from the days work. Her arms outstretched, caressing and she was *humming a lullaby* to the painting!

I wanted to vomit, but before I could sneer at what I could only assume was a bad joke she grabbed a painting off the easel so I remained hidden.

She turned towards the painting arms outstretching, holding a painting to the other painting.

“A special treat,” she whispered

I couldn’t believe my eyes, in her grasp she held a painting of none other than me!

My stomach turned into knots. I wanted to double over in pain. 

I saw a flash of movement in the painting like before but this time I clearly saw the reach of two gnarled, soot darkened arms reach through the painting and grasp the painting of me she offered.

I turned and run back upstairs. I locked myself in the bathroom and sat in the dark breathing heavily. 

The moon started to peak out through the clouds, shining a light into the room. 

As I looked over to the window, a jolt of electricity shot through my spine as I saw a face staring back at me in the window. *The twisted, red-eyed, fanged smile of the demon from the painting!*

I crawled back to the door and threw open the doors.

I ran until I came to a library. I don’t know how much longer I have left, but if you’re reading this: *please, destroy it.*
