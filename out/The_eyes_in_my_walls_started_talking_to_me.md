There was an eye in my wall. From a tiny hole in the brick of my fireplace, the eye stared at me. I could feel it before I could see it, that feeling you get when something hidden is watching you from afar. Then I saw it, the green irised eye that was just barely visible through the gap in the bricks, as if a face were impossibly trapped in the fireplace. The eye blinked at me, then looked away as if embarrassed. It didn’t seem natural, so I got a bit of caulk and sealed the hole. That’s better. I rest myself on the couch once again, assimilating into the stillness of this old house. It’s lonely here. But no… I’m not so alone am I? Of course, my wife is here, upstairs knitting a sweater I believe. She always makes the most adorable tiny clothes, so that should we have a child someday we’ll already have some made. What days those were, I did love my wife. Yes, it isn’t so lonely here. 

I used to shingle roofs in the mornings. Shingling roofs is hard work, a bit of a lost art nowadays. In my time, we didn’t have machines for these sorts of things. I worked through rain and shine, summer and winter, with nothing but a hammer, nails and a strong will. It’s hot out today. My hands are slicked with sweat, making it difficult for me to keep a grip on my hammer. I put the nail in place and strike it down with force. BAM. I sort through the box and find another. I put the nail in place and strike it down with force. BAM. It has only gone in half way this time, so I strike it again. BAM. Much better. I sort through the box and find a new nail, this one a little rusted. I put the nail in place and strike it down with force. BAM. I sort through the box and find another. I put the nail in place and… my hand trembles. I try to steady myself but my hand refuses. My arm bumps like a heart beat and a piercing pain pulses through my veins as I stare down at the nail. My breathing wavers for a moment. I hold my breath and reel my hand back, striking the nail down with fury. BAM. A circular dent is left in the shingle. I allow myself to breathe again. Much better. I look upon the completed roof, not a single imperfection in sight. This was work to be proud of. 

After I packed up for the day, I went to pick up my son from school. The school was far from our town, so it would be a long ride to get there. He would have been better off closer to home. I tried to tell Silvia as much, but she insisted that private school would be “enriching” for him. It wasn’t. He didn’t belong in that environment, with those teachers, around those stuck up rich kids. There was too much pressure on him there, it just made him afraid to go to school. Because of that, we ended up with an idiot son. She didn’t like it when I said that, but it was true. We did have an idiot son and it was because of that damned private school. Speaking of which, where is that school now? I’ve been driving for hours and I feel like I haven’t gotten anywhere. Now that I think about it, I’ve never seen this road before. How could I have ended up here? The land that surrounds me is flat and desolate, the blackened soil scorched of life. I slow the truck to a stop, attempting to reorient myself. The sun is already beginning to set. I pull out my phone, hoping I could message Silvia to tell her I’ll be home late. To my dismay, the phone is dead. Maybe there’s a charger somewhere around here, maybe stuffed in the glove compartment. I open it to check. There is an eye there. I close the glove compartment swiftly. I step out onto the dirt, my boots sinking slightly in the dried dusty earth as I begin to look around. There are no other cars on the road, no birds in the sky, no bugs wriggling under my feet, not a single indication of life. But faintly, faintly, I see something far away. There is a light off in the distance, far off of the road. Without thinking, I begin to walk towards it. 

The setting sun is still hot as ever and my throat is becoming dry. I turn to get some water from my truck but it isn’t there anymore, I’ve already walked many miles away from it. I look up to see the moon shining down on me, stars now dotting the sky far above. I stare up bewildered while my legs propel me forward, dragging the rest of my body mindlessly. The dirt grips my boots with every step but I march forward still. I look to the horizon and see the light once more, brighter, clearer now. The air becomes thinner the further I go, reeking of burnt wood chips. As it gets closer, the stars that once dotted the sky begin to fade away. One by one they disappear until the sky becomes empty. Above me is a pitch black void, but the pillar of light in the distance has become ever brighter. One step after another and I inch forward, closer, closer, closer, closer. The soil beneath me turns into sand as I continue. The dunes roll across the landscape but they cannot hinder my progress. The sand is blown about by gusts of wind that burn my eyes which cannot close, lest I let the light out of my view. Step by step by step, the light becomes closer and closer and closer. Yes… I can feel it now… The golden pillar's warmth is just within reach. But no… no, I wasn’t there. Of course, I was at home with my wife. She was asleep on the couch, an unfinished sweater lying in a ball on her chest. There is an eye poking out from between the cushions. 

The dreams started that night. While my body lay peaceful and still in my bed, my mind was somewhere far away from there. The dreams were vivid, more real than any dream I’d ever had before. Everything around me was incomprehensible, a swirling vortex of sounds and colors that mixed into a cacophony of noise, but it all felt more real than reality itself. I was falling, falling, falling, falling, falling, falling…

When I landed I was back in my bed, rays of morning sunlight shining into my eyes. 

I descended the stairs into the living room, trying to shake the strange dream from my head. I found Silvia there, sitting on the couch and rubbing her temples. She turned towards me as I approached, pulling at her messy black hair. I suddenly felt sick when I saw her face. Something about her felt different, something in her… No, no that's not right. She shines me a bright smile, wisping her perfectly groomed hair away from her eyes. I sit beside her, kissing her on the cheek. 

“Long night?” I say, motioning to the tiny sweater. She giggles.

“I guess so,” She concedes, sighing. “I thought I could make some progress on this one after work, but I fell asleep.” I nod. The sweater has become bunched up, a messy ball of yarn. Me and Silvia have always wanted kids, we’ve been trying for some time now. I’ve always thought that maybe she was too stressed for it, so I tell her to take more time for herself and let me do more of the work for her. But ever since I got back home, she’s been a lot different. She tells me about dreams she began to have, dreams where she would meet a sudden and gruesome demise. She says that in them, it feels like her head is caving in on itself. She’s paranoid that something bad could happen to her if she isn’t careful, or maybe that something has already happened? I dare not tell her why she feels this way. 

The work day was long, the laborious shingling robbing me of my energy. Silvia was there to greet me when I walked into the living room. She stood with her arms crossed, her hair messily drooping behind her ears. The scowl on her face spoke volumes before she ever began to talk.

“Where have you been?” she said, her voice hoarse. 

“Working,” I responded tiredly as I collapsed onto the couch. “Working like I do everyday. The client's house was a little further away today if that’s what you mean.” She scoffed and rolled her eyes. 

“I can’t believe you,” she spit. “You’ve been gone all this time and didn’t even…” She continued berating me, her face burning red as she yelled and swung her arms wildly. I sat and observed, hardly retaining any of what she had said. I’ve never been confrontational when she does this, I find that it only serves to make things worse. Instead I sat, waiting for her to finish her rant. She grumbled out of the room, mumbling curses to herself as I slumped further into the couch. I was too tired to be frustrated. For a moment, my skin felt moist and sticky, but the feeling subsided quickly. 

I didn’t see Silvia before I left for work the next morning. The coffee hadn’t been made and I didn’t have any time to brew a pot. The drive to the house felt longer than it should have, the roads twisted and turned in odd directions and the architecture of the neighborhood's houses began to shift. Their roofs curled into spikes, the trees were melting and the asphalt was boiling. The neighborhood began to fade around me, crumbled to dust and blew away in the harsh winds. The air became thin as the landscape morphed into something different, something bright. I knew this place. I know it well. I was falling, falling, falling… 

No I wasn’t.

I was on top of the house, holding a new shingle in place. Then the voice said it again.

“No I wasn’t. I was on top of the house, holding a new shingle in place,” It said. It was my voice. My hands were slicked with sweat, making it difficult for me to keep a grip on my hammer. I put the nail in place and struck it down with force. BAM.

“No, that's not right,” the voice chimed in. “Didn’t I do this already?” Of course I did, I’ve been shingling roofs for years. I reached into the box to grab a new nail, digging around to find one that hadn’t been bent yet. Something cold and wet touches my hand. It’s viscous and pulsing, I can feel it crawling up my fingers and oozing into my skin. I pull the nail out of it, the contents of the box sloshing around as I do. I raise my hand up and find that it’s become stained red, the liquid dripping from under my finger nails. My eyes dart to the box. There are only a few nails left. I knew I should have gone to the store before I came here. I put the nail in place, making sure to keep it as straight as I can. I look down to find that the shingle has fallen away and a hole has appeared where it used to be. There is an eye in the hole. I readjust the nail, sticking it into the wide open eye. I push and prod until it sticks to my liking. The nail shifts with the emerald eye as it looks around. I hold it in place, reeling my hammer back and smacking it down. BAM.

The sky is dark when I return home. I lost track of time, it really has been a long day. Was it a long day? This is my home isn’t it? Of course it is, but it looks different somehow. The paint has chipped a bit more and the bushes have become overgrown. Has it really only been a day? No, that’s just what the voice says. It says a lot of things, but I know that it's lying to me. I had actually been gone for days, weeks maybe? A month? I stepped out of the truck and approached the home. I’ve just been stressed out recently, that's all. It wouldn’t be so bad if Silvia made coffee in the mornings like she used to. How long has it been since I’ve even seen her? I had been walking towards the house for a minute but didn’t move any closer, the uneven brick path stretching further forward with every step I took. Maybe if we hadn’t spent so much money on some private school we could have saved to buy a nicer house. Maybe we wouldn’t still be in this hole if we would have done what I said. The outer edges of the front door glowed with the crimson hue of a hellfire that burned inside. The smell of smoldering wood was overwhelming. I’m doing all I can and all I ever hear is complaining from you, you and Thomas both. 

“Bullshit, Roger,” She retorted sternly, stomping her heel into the hardwood floor. “You do this all the time now, leaving for days at a time and coming back like nothing happened. What have you been doing all this time? Where have you been?” Her hair was frizzy and tangled, skin wrinkled and sagging. More wrinkles and more sagging, the features melted together as she continued yelling. Her voice became distorted, monstrous, like a broken radio playing static. I could hardly understand what she was saying anymore, the awful noise making my ears ring. Her face bubbled and a giant eye emerged from its center, the skin revolving around it like fish in a pond. All at once her voice became intelligible again and she screamed one word clearly.

“ROGER” She shrieked. She screamed again and again and again. ROGER. ROGER. ROGER. ROGER. I could hear her voice all around me, the very walls had begun to speak. They whispered to me tenderly, all in sync with each other. ROGER. ROGER. ROGER. The walls bent and groaned as they too began to bubble and burn, becoming scorched black like burnt coals. Eyes popped out of the walls like acne, dotting the room like stars in a dark sky. They fell from the ceiling, emerged from the floor, wriggled out from under my boots. Every one of them screamed my name. ROGER. ROGER. ROGER. Silvia’s arms and legs were invaded by a plague of eyes, swiftly spreading across her body and consuming her. Every eye was looking at me. They spoke in unison. ROGER. ROGER. ROGER. ROGER. ROGER. They are so loud. I can’t make them stop. Please, please make it stop. I cried in anguish as the screaming hammered at my eardrums. I held my ears but it didn't help, their voices were inside of my head. ROGER. ROGER. ROGER. ROGER. I reached for my toolbelt. I grabbed my hammer.

I used to shingle roofs in the mornings. Shingling roofs is hard work, a bit of a lost art nowadays. In my time, we didn’t have machines for those sorts of things. I grabbed the nail firmly and struck it with all the force I could muster. BAM. I hit it again. And again. And again. BAM. BAM. BAM. BAM. BAM. I pushed her over and threw away her hand as she tried to defend herself. BAM. BAM. BAM. She grabbed my arm, nearly tearing the hammer away from me. This nail was stubborn. I brought the hammer down once more and her grip loosened. I hit the nail in. I hit it again. I hit it again. BAM. BAM. BAM. BAM. BAM. The nail squished and cracked as I continued. I hit it again. I hit it again. I hit it again… My hammer became stuck, lodged deep into the broken shingle. I took deep shaky breaths as I tried to calm myself, my heart pounding in my ears. Silvia was there, laying motionless on the floor. No, that's not right, is it? Is it? 

My hands, my clothes, the hammer, the couch and the walls were all covered in blood. It soaked into the pillows, dripping down the white and yellow wallpaper. I could taste the iron in the air. The hammer was stuck upright in the cavern I had made in her skull. She was unrecognizable. I looked down at my trembling hands which were caked in red chunks. This was real. My stomach stirred and I resisted the urge to vomit. There were no eyes left, none on the walls, none on the ceiling or the floors, none on Silvia. But somehow, I still felt like I was being watched. Thomas stood over us, staring down at the scene completely frozen in awe. Tears fell silently from his eyes. Her eyes. His quivering mouth showed fear and the eyes showed disdain. I hated looking at those eyes. 

Me and Silvia had always wanted kids, we’d been trying for some time. This drive reminds me of when I used to take Thomas to school, as much as I hated it at the time. But I’m not driving to the school today, I’m driving away. Away from the family, away from the stress, and to somewhere I can’t quite put my finger on. It’s so dark out. I can barely see where I’m going as a sand storm blows over my car and scratches my windows. I step hard on the gas and speed across the bumpy terrain, the truck jolting up and down as I drive over potholes and stones. I don’t know which direction I’m headed but somehow I know I’m going the right way. I can feel it. When the engine eventually sputters and the truck slows to a halt I throw the door open and fall out onto the sand, hardly able to stand as the winds push me back to my knees. With every ounce of energy I have I push forward, slowly marching through the storm. The truck disappears behind a thick wall of yellow fog. The rushing sand cuts deep wounds into my skin and I can hardly keep it out of my eyes. Up and over the dunes I trek, shambling through the thick fog of sand. In the distance I can see it, the golden pillar growing ever closer. Just a little further.

I walk and walk and walk until my legs give out and I stumble to the ground in complete agony. I crawl forward through the pain, through the sand. Every inch forward drives a spike of pain through my entire body and I heave trying to find oxygen in the sand. When I am incapable of moving my legs, I drag myself forward, my exposed hands covered in blood from my wounds. I pull forward an inch. I wheeze. I pull forward again, a little less this time. Just a little further, just a little further… Then I collapse. 

I lay sick and weak. I begin to lose track of time, submerged in the ever growing mounds of sand. Slowly, the rushing winds of the storm begin to silence. Soon, I can feel the rough sands disappearing from under me, the pain in my eyes dissipating. After a long time I regain strength in my limbs and bring myself to my knees. I can feel my skin sizzling as a blinding light pierces through my eyelids. When they open, the pillar's light consumes my vision. It’s radiant, emanating with some divine energy. The pillar dwarfs me completely, reaching up further in the sky than I could ever dream of seeing. It’s so impossible gargantuan that it nearly surrounds me. I surrender myself to it and sob. I wallow at its base, marveling at its grandiosity, its absoluteness. I curl forward, throwing my blood covered hands forward in submission. For the first time in my life I feel centered, anchored to reality for a brief moment in the presence of this higher being. 

From the radiance something emerges, the shape of something that I don’t recognize at first. As it approaches I identify it as the shape of a man, but only the shape of one. He is pure light, a man made of star dust. He emerges from the pillar's core, stepping on air as if walking down steps. He floats in front of me, his face completely indiscernible in the luminescence. Something begins to emit from the man. He speaks to me without speaking, but I understand the words perfectly. 

“Roger,” I feel him say, the cadence of his voice unclear to me. “What has brought you to me?” His voice is calm but booming, echoing across the terrain. I sit up, stifling my tears and gasping for air. I speak the best that I can.

“I have done bad things,” I choke out, bowing my head. “I want to be free of this place. Please, let me be free of this nightmare!” My throat burns from mucus. The man stares down at me unwavering as I plead. His gaze burns into my soul. He’s deliberating, or maybe he takes amusement in my suffering. After a long time he finally speaks again. 

“You have done bad things,” he says. “I cannot erase your actions, nor can I erase the memory of those mistakes from your mind. However, I may be able to give you a second chance,” My sobbing calms and I look back up to the man with intrigue. The man continues, “I have also been trapped in this place as you are now. What I had looked for here was found, but I became stuck. But you can get me out, and I can bring you to someplace better. You can escape the actions you’ve committed here and go back to normalcy, be with your wife again,” I sit before the man dumbfounded, considering what he said. Is that possible? Can I really see her again? I have to try.

“What do I have to do?” I ask. The man drifts towards me, reaching his bright hand forward. 

“You just need to focus,” He answers. You will know when you arrive there, you will feel it. I cannot take you all the way there myself, but I will guide you.” He reaches out further, extending his light tipped fingers. I shiver, uncertain of what to do next. I’m unsure about the man, but I know what he speaks of. I can feel it, tugging me down. I take a deep, trembling breath and nod. 

“Okay,” I respond simply. I reach out to him slowly. My hand almost moves by itself, magnetized to the god that hovers in front of me. Our hands connect and the man's entire body explodes in light. I suddenly feel myself falling, falling, faster and faster. I fall through hundreds, thousands of layers in seconds. Indescribable shapes and colors flash before my fragile eyes, the beginnings of lives, the deaths of the galaxy, the universe itself reaching out and invading my mind in complete sensory overload. The further I fall, the harder I feel its pull. I fall and fall and fall and I can feel that I am coming closer, closer, closer, closer, closer…

Then everything stops. When I wake up, I am home.

Silvia lays down beside me, the stress of her workday apparent as she collapses in bed and falls asleep almost instantly. I smile as I watch her lay, her chest rising and falling as she rests peacefully. She’s different now. Her hair is cleaner, her face is brighter and her eyes turned blue. She’s happier now, like she was when we first met. After all of the ups and downs, it seems like we made it somehow. I begin to feel the weight of the day on my tired muscles as I begin to drift off. I roll over and hold her as I begin to sleep. But just outside of my blurred vision, in the corner of my room, I can still see her eyes watching me from afar.
