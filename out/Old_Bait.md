The box was full of tiny, shriveled, decaying bodies. Blank, lifeless eyes staring into space. Skin, split and dried, revealing a dark, gooey surface beneath. Some of them still had all their limbs, if they were the lucky ones. Should I have expected anything more from my old box of fishing bait? 

If I wasn’t running so late, I would have had time to buy some proper lures. But if I hadn’t stayed for “just one more cup of coffee” with my parents, I wouldn’t have gotten to my storage unit late, and maybe, if I just left on time to begin with, I wouldn’t be late for my best friend's bachelor party.

I hadn’t been back home in years, and for me, that home is a little town in the middle of nowhere, Northeast USA. It's one of those towns that time seems to have missed its march across the world. The air, the scenery, the buildings, they all reminded me of life here as a kid. Even looking at my tacklebox, covered in Ben 10 stickers I bought with money from mowing lawns. There was that scratch it got when it fell off the dock the night my friends and I bought a pack of Monsters and went fishing. 

And there, on the lid, was one of those plastic, glow-in-the-dark stars everyone used to have on their ceilings. I laughed looking at it, remembering how I’d stolen from my friend Nick’s bedroom and hid it from my parents until I thought the coast was clear. Looking back, they may have let me off, knowing the kind of guy Nick turned out to be. It was stupid, but I stole it because it reminded me of the earrings that woman was wearing on that billboard.

That billboard. The memory crept into my mind, or better yet, heaved itself up from the depths of the past. 

It sat on Route 161 on the way into town. “WHO KILLED ME?” was written across it, in bold yellow letters, followed by a name and a number still lost in the deep. But what I did remember was her face. Her photo must have been from the late 80’s, if I were to guess. She was young, mid-20s, around my age now. Her face was kind, framed in bleach blonde hair done up in a ponytail and laid over her shoulder. And hanging clearly from her ear was a gaudy plastic earring in the shape of a star, not unlike the one on my tacklebox. 

I was too young to really grasp the idea of murder as a kid. I remember whenever we would pass that stretch of road, I would always look at the woodline, hoping to see her alive and well, just lost. I remember asking my poor parents if the poster was wrong. I don’t remember exactly what they said, but it wasn’t the answer I wanted to hear. 

The memory of it cast a shadow as I loaded the kit into my truck. I could only assume whoever paid for that poster never found their answer. A few years later, someone covered her over with some new advertising. “What are YOU waiting for?” it said. Probably an ad for real estate or boat sales…

A ping from our group chat pulled me back to the present, back to why I was here, for my friend, and to celebrate. It was the man of the hour himself, asking where I was, saying I was one of the last to show. I texted back that I was on my way, before turning over the engine, and pulling out of the parking lot. 

The sky was painted in one of those orange and purple sunsets, leaves swirled in the air behind my truck and I took off down the road. It was a backroads kind of evening, and just my luck, the backroads would take me where I needed to go. I turned off the main paved drive onto old Bog Road, which dipped down to the flatlands of the valley, and came out by where we’d be staying.

The further I drove, the more the darkness of twilight filled the valley like a rising, murky tide. I turned on my headlights, which beamed out into the growing night. The air cooled; the woods deepened. It was an offness. Like waking up as a kid and finding your nightlight off, or as an adult, falling asleep by a woodfire, and waking up in the dark. I rolled up my windows.

As the sun gave way to moonlight, an unease I had of night driving set in. I began looking out for deer, or anything else that might step out from the woodline. When I rounded a turn, the bright red flash of a silver BMW’s reflectors grabbed my focus. It was pulled over to the side of the road, lights still on, driver’s side door open. For the moment, I assumed someone stopped to take a leak, though, he’d have to be desperate to do that here.

Murky wetlands bordered both sides of the road, and the forest opened into a great bog, dotted with clusters of trees and debris, muddy, brown, and ripe in the decay of autumn. The water was flat as glass, reflecting the moon in near perfection, barely disturbed by some movement. 

I tried to make out what it was. It didn’t dash like a fish, but it was too glossy to be any sort of log. I took my eyes from the road, just for a second. 

A flash of color emerged into my headlights. I swerved, slamming my brakes and skidding down the road. I didn’t think I hit something, but I gripped the steering wheel white-knuckled, and turned on my hazards.

Behind me, about twenty feet back was a person. I could just make her out as the lights flashed. 

I got out, stumbling over my words in apologies. But she just waved her arms dismissively, staggering in place.

Drunk, clearly. The BMW suddenly made sense, rich tourists loved getting on benders at the lake houses down here, them and druggies alike. I was equal parts pissed and sympathetic.

“Hey!” I shouted. “Look, just- stay where you are, I don’t want you falling in. Is there someone I can call to pick you up?” 

She began to stumble her way towards me, getting closer with each hazard blink.

“I can give you a lift, you’re in no state to drive.”

She said nothing, but came closer. At this point, I leaned back into my car. Whoever this was, she was drunk at best, and at worst, had someone waiting in the woodline to jump me. I’d have to be late, the cops could deal with this, but I’d wait to make sure she didn’t fall in.

Looking back to her, she’d stopped. Stooped down where the water ran beneath the road in a culvert, fiddling with some rope that went off into the bog, tugging on it and wrapping it around her wrist, when in-between blinks, she was gone. Right after, I heard a splash, and the sound of limbs smacking against water. 

“Shit!” I shouted, running down to where she fell in. 

I could make her out in the moonlight as my eyes adjusted. The ripples and waves in the water rising like silver threads. One foot sinking into the muck, I reached down, ready to grab her, when I stopped. Something turned in my gut. Above the splashing, the forest, the bog, everything was silent. The hairs on the back of my neck stood like pins, and I froze. 

When I stopped, she stopped. Total silence fell over the bog, and she floated still, face down.

Then, it started again, but with a single twist of her arm, which snapped backwards on the elbow. Her skin rippled, something squirming beneath, when her knees buckled back on themselves – even her spine writhed like a worm beneath her skin. The water splashed in a great line, all the way out to the bog’s center, where I could just catch for a second, something dark, wrinkled like a great, bloated leech that heaved itself up from the deep.

My adrenaline spiked, going pale as a ghost, I ran back to my truck. Behind me I heard the water splash, something soaked flopped onto the dirt road, scrambling and kicking up dirt and rocks. I jumped in my truck, slamming the heavy steel door, less than a second before something crashed against the window. 

In the fading warm glow of the cabin light, I made out her hand, sinewy and pale, sliding up towards the top of the glass. Her face emerged from the dark, blank glossy eyes that stared into space, skin dried and split, housing writhing white maggots in its damp pockets. And from the ear she was lucky enough to still have, hung an earring, cracked and sunfaded, but unmistakably, in the shape of a star. 

I nearly punched a hole in the floor beneath the gas pedal, barreling down the road. As she was pulled away, I could hear scraping on glass, ending with the abrupt sound of dry \*SNAP\*. 

I got to the cabin a few minutes later, feeling relief as that automatic floodlight filled my cabin with a warm, halogen glow. My heart was still racing. I gathered myself. I could’ve called the cops, but I know this town, I know our police officer. Whatever was out there, if he went to investigate, he’d go alone… No, I couldn’t risk that, risk whatever that was taking advantage of someone trying to help. And if I told my friends, same story. Nobody travels that road, not unless they’re coming here, and at this point, I was the last to arrive. I kept it to myself, just for now. 

Swallowing down all of what happened, we made it a night to remember. Though all the while, I watched the windows. Every time that light tripped on, I’d step to the window, looking out into the dark. 

Come morning, my friend and I shot out early for a trip into town to grab some doughnuts and coffee for the guys, and thankfully for me, some new fishing lures. 

“Sorry about being late last night.” I said, looking out the window into the woodline as I drove. 

“Seriously man, don’t worry.” He replied. “Least you’re not Nick.”

“Nick? He was coming?”

“No… Well, he wasn’t planning to. Not until he messaged me and said he had a new toy to show off, fancy silver BMW apparently. My bet was drug money. Never showed though, bailed last minute.”

I said nothing, but stopped where our road met the one that led into town. There, sunken into the woodline sat the remains of that billboard. Big chunks of the new ad had peeled away, showing what had been buried for years. Now a Frankenstein mix of old and new, the moss-covered billboard read: “WHAT. killed me?”

I heard my friend open up my tacklebox. 

“What the hell?! Good thing we’re getting you some new lures” he said, holding one up to inspect it. “Unless we’re going for the dumbest fish in the bog, you’re not going to catch anything using old bait.”
