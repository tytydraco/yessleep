Well, my grandparents and great-grandparents came from rural areas, and in the countryside, paranormal or strange situations tend to be more common, don’t they? I want to share another story my grandmother told me when I was a child.

My grandmother told me about a night in her little countryside home, a quiet hamlet near the town where she lived with her parents and sisters. It was an ordinary day gradually fading into shadows as the sun set behind the mountains. Her mother was finishing up gathering the laundry from the clothesline and locking the chickens in the coop. My grandmother and her older sister, Rosa, were in the kitchen preparing dinner. Pecas, the loyal companion of my grandmother’s father, a mare, was with him in town selling the harvest. At home, there were three dogs: Negra, Salchicha, and Lule, a big and sturdy dog, a mix of German Shepherd and mutt. Suddenly, from the yard, her mother screamed urgently:

"Close the door! Don’t go outside, and don’t open it for anyone!"

My grandmother always said that scream filled her with fear because her mother was not easily frightened. She hid behind Rosa, holding onto her waist, as they both heard something that unsettled them even more: scratching at the kitchen door.

"It's Lule or Negra, they're probably scared," Rosa said, but the scratching was intense, desperate, as if something was trying to break the door down.

Despite my grandmother's pleas not to open the door, Rosa turned the doorknob. The door swung wide open, letting in the cool night air and revealing nothing but emptiness. No one was there. My grandmother peeked out from behind her sister, scanning the moonlit yard. For a moment, everything seemed normal. Rosa stepped outside to look for the dogs, calling their names, but no response came. My grandmother stayed in the kitchen doorway, uneasy. Then she heard it: a low, menacing growl coming from the back of the house, where the shadows were deepest.

"Rosa…" she said in a trembling voice, pointing toward the darkness.

Both of them turned and saw it. It was Lule… or something that looked like Lule. Under the moonlight, the dog seemed larger than normal. His fur was bristled, his eyes glowed like burning coals, and his mouth, filled with sharp teeth, was twisted into a terrifying snarl. Saliva dripped from his muzzle as a deep growl vibrated through the air. My grandmother screamed, and Rosa reacted, running toward the kitchen. They shut the door just before the creature slammed into it with force. Scratches and thuds shook the wood, as though claws were trying to tear it apart. Inside, both of them trembled, waiting for it to end. After what felt like an eternity, a loud thud echoed, and everything went silent. Minutes later, they heard their mother’s voice:

"Girls, open up! It's me."

When they opened the door, they found their mother with a pale face and heavy breathing. Behind her was my grandmother's father, holding the peinilla (a type of axe used for fieldwork) in his hand and with blood stains on his clothes. The earth was marked by a trail of blood that led towards the mountain. Upon seeing this, my grandmother broke into tears.

"What happened to Lule?" she asked between sobs, believing that her father had hurt the dog.

Her father kneeled in front of her and said in a serious voice:

"That wasn't Lule, María."

My grandmother looked beyond and there she saw him. Lule was with Negra and Salchicha, wagging his tail as always, without a scratch. Her mother was petting his head while soothing him.  
From that night on, my grandmother said she never looked into Lule's eyes again without remembering that red glow and the deep growl. They never knew what that creature was that tried to enter the house, but her father always slept with the peinilla nearby, as if waiting for it to return one day.

That thing that happened with the fake Lule is like if my grandma had encountered a skinwalker?
