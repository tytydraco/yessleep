A few years ago, I was working as a home care nurse in a small town in the south of France. One evening I was called to an emergency for a new patient, an old man living in an isolated house on the outskirts of town. I remember being surprised by the location of the house, hidden behind a row of trees with faded red shutters.

When I arrived, I was greeted by the old man's daughter, who seemed nervous and agitated. She briefly explained that her father was bedridden and needed immediate attention. So I entered the dark and dusty house, feeling immediately a heavy and oppressive atmosphere.

The old man's room was at the end of a long hallway, lit only by the dim glow of a bedside lamp. As I approached, I noticed strange marks on the walls and floor, as if something had scratched or pounded the surface. The room itself was chilly, and the old man was lying on his bed, his eyes wide and fixed on a specific spot on the ceiling.

As I began to administer care, the old man began to mumble in a shaky voice, speaking of a malevolent presence that haunted the house. He said that this entity had begun to appear at night, first as stealthy shadows, then taking on the appearance of a woman dressed in black with a veil covering her face. She always stood at the foot of his bed, muttering unintelligible words and staring at him with cold, empty eyes.

I tried to calm the old man down, assuring him that these were just hallucinations caused by fatigue and illness. However, I couldn't help but feel a vague worry growing inside me.

After finishing the treatment, I returned to the living room to talk to the old man's daughter. But to my surprise, the house was empty and silent. I searched everywhere, without finding any trace of her. In a panic, I decided to leave the house immediately and go back to my car.

On my way out, I took one last look at the house with the red shutters. And there, through the window of the old man's room, I saw the silhouette of a woman dressed in black, her veiled face turned towards me. My blood ran cold and I ran to my car, praying that I could leave before she reached me.

I never saw the house with the red shutters again, and I never found out what happened to the old man and his daughter. But I do know one thing: that night I witnessed an indescribable evil and I never forget that terrifying experience.

For the next few weeks, I was haunted by nightmares and visions of the woman in black. I was unable to sleep properly, and often woke up sweating, convinced that she was in my room, ready to grab me. My work suffered and my social life fell apart.

One day, I decided that I could no longer live with this constant fear. I contacted a local psychic, hoping she could help me find a solution to this problem. After listening carefully, the psychic explained to me that the woman in black was an ancient and malevolent entity attached to the red shuttered house and its inhabitants. She advised me to return to the house to try to put an end to this curse.

Armed with my courage and some sacred objects that the medium had given me, I went back to the house. The door was open, as if waiting for me. I stepped inside, hands shaking, and headed for the old man's room, where I had last seen the woman in black.

The room was empty, but there was still that icy, oppressive atmosphere. I began to recite a prayer, while placing the sacred objects around the room. Suddenly, I felt a presence behind me, and I heard an unintelligible whisper that made me shiver. I continued to pray, tears streaming down my cheeks, hoping that this malevolent entity would finally go away.

Finally, the room warmed up, and I felt a weight lift from my shoulders. I left the house with the red shutters for the last time, convinced that I had succeeded in chasing away the woman in black.

Since that day, I have never been haunted by that terrifying entity again. The nightmares stopped, and I was able to resume my life as normal. However, I will never forget this experience, which left me with an indelible scar.

As for the house with the red shutters, it remained abandoned, leaving a sinister aura over the city. No one has ever dared to move in there again, for fear of awakening the woman in black and her evil designs once more.
