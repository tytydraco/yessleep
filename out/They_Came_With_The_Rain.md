Holy shit, I finally got a connection. I have been trying for weeks now and nothing has worked. Maybe I  shouldn't celebrate too soon. If my calls haven't gotten through I'm as good as dead anyway. That said, I can at least try to explain what I'm going through. I still don't fully understand myself.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I just woke up and everything felt off. You ever get that weird gut feeling no matter how irrational that something is out of place? It was like that except tenfold.  It began in the afternoon. I'm a night owl so I always wake up later.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There was a certain vibe to everything. Hearing the rain outside, I chalked it up to that. Power still worked fine so I wasn't concerned. I then went to check my phone for missed messages and there was no connection whatsoever. Annoyed, I assumed a tower must've gone out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Again, nothing was happening that got me too concerned, plus I had a few days off so I could use that to catch up on some reading. The only thing I found strange was how only my internet and phone service were out. The tower is located pretty close to town. Storms have happened here before and when the tower gets hit the houses in my neighborhood are usually affected too. Regardless, I passed the time as best I could, figuring it would be good to unplug from social media.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I've spent most of my time reading The Talisman by Stephen King followed by Black House which he wrote with Peter Straub. I'm not a speed reader or anything. I just have a lot of time on my hands now. I was over halfway through the first book when it was time for my walk. Something to know about me is that I am pretty committed when it comes to routines.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Exercising was no exception. A little rain didn't bother me so long as I had my umbrella. Nothing immediately concerning stood out to me during my walk. However, I did find some things odd. There was nobody else on my walk. I don't mean only outside. I didn't see anyone in any stores either.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This wouldn't have been strange if it weren't for the fact the lights were still on as if they were open like normal. I tried to go into a convenience store and sure enough, the door was unlocked.  When I stepped inside, I found new packs of food and soda meant to restock shelves.  They were open like someone was putting their contents away and quit halfway through. I figured it was just an ex-employee.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I tried calling out to someone and got no response so I went up to the register. I found something there that left me scratching my head. There was money still on the counter and I don't mean just change either. There was a fifty-dollar bill. Along with it was some beer and snacks.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The latter appeared to have been scanned since they were bagged. An employee walking out is one thing, but why the hell would a cashier and customer up and leave mid-transaction? In retrospect, I should have seen this as a sign to get out of dodge. Even though I didn't go inside any other stores, trying the doors showed me they were unlocked. I tend to be a logical-minded person, or at least I was. I thought there had to be some logical explanation for everything.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What I came up with was an emergency evacuation.  For what, I don't know. It would explain why people would leave amid their activities. The obvious problem with this is why didn't anyone tell me? I wondered about this when I got home.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I thought they overlooked me which felt shitty. I mean I am a bit of a recluse. Aside from my walks, I don't get out much so getting missed wasn't too surprising. You may be thinking at this point if I thought there wasn't an evacuation, why didn't I leave town? I didn't feel like I was in any immediate danger.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

While the storm was heavy, it wasn't hazardous. Therefore, I thought there was a massive false alarm and everyone would return soon. I finished up The Talisman, then got started on Black House. The next day was spent like the last, just me trying to keep myself occupied while the rain was still pouring. When it was time for my walk, I went out as usual, thinking that by now everyone was back.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I went my usual route and still nobody was around. I even went to the same convenience store and everything was how I saw it the night before, even the money which I didn't take for two reasons. One, I'm not a thief, and two, if I found it gone it meant someone else had passed through. Seeing it was still there made me uneasy. That's when I thought about driving out of town.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My plan was straightforward. I wanted to go somewhere with cell service and contact people I knew to let them know what was going on. Too bad it had other plans. What it is I don't know other than that it's the last thing I want to be alone with. It was around ten when I noticed it after leaving the convenience store.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There was a tall silhouette in the rain. I didn't think much of it. I thought what I was looking at was another person and that meant everyone would return soon. I glanced at them and continued about my business. Then from my peripheral, I saw them walk. The way they moved was odd like it was their first time standing on two legs.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Immediately my mind went to them being a drug addict. They did show up occasionally in my town. Most of the time they wanted some loose change or a lighter. Ignoring them or answering no would make them move on to someone else. I have heard stories of some attacking people which is another reason  I had my umbrella.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It wasn't a normal one. It was a combat umbrella.  In short, they are made far more durable so they can be used in self-defense. I know I could have gotten a gun. I just don't think I have it in me to shoot someone and potentially end their life even if it is justified. Anyway, as the figure got closer, I tightened my grip on the handle.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The tweakers tended to be more aggressive which is what I thought I was dealing with. I steeled myself under the impression I could tell them off or if they tried attacking me lay them out. They got closer. They were a lot taller than I thought. I'm over six feet and they were a head above me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Even with the rain, I was within shooting distance. That meant fortunately for me they didn't have any weapons on them or at least, none that would be effective against mine. When they were closer, I could see they were wearing a raincoat. I still couldn't make out any features because their face was. We stared at each other. I noted their legs were shaking and expected them to say something.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They just stood there. I wondered if I could walk away or if they would start something. Not being able to take the awkward silence anymore, I spoke up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Can I help you?" I asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I kept getting looked at in response.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Freak," I thought and was about to keep walking when it got in front of me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I went from nervous to pissed off. I collapsed my umbrella and brandished it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Look, you fucking weirdo, I don't know what you're trying to pull, but you better back the fuck off."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This elicited a reaction from them and it wasn't the one I hoped. In one swift motion, it threw its coat off. What was underneath caused any words to get caught in my throat. It wasn't human. Its skin was sickly yellow-green and slick like an amphibian.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was naked with arms so long they reached to its ankles. Its hands were huge and could probably crush Congo melons with a single grip. Its belly protruded, giving it an almost pregnant appearance. The worst part about it was its face. I don't know what was worse, the sharp teeth and shark-esque eyes that seemed way too big for its head or that it was smiling at me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I hadn't even fully processed the situation when it grabbed at me. Instinct kicked in and I ducked it, then brought up my umbrella against the side of its head. It was like hitting a metal baseball bat against a boulder. The fucking umbrella bent against its head and the shock from the impact made me drop it. The creature picked it up, studying it with mild interest before tossing it aside.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Against something that could probably lift a car with an arm and without any weapons, I only had one thought, run. I found out there were speeds I didn't think my body was capable of. Despite its size, the monster was keeping up with me. Every so often I would feel a gust of wind as it tried to snatch me by the neck. My house was a half-hour walk away and there was no way I was leading it there.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I needed to get this thing off my trail and fast. Luckily, I had my phone on me. I just hoped what I was about to do worked. I hit the flashlight app and shined it behind me. The illumination left the creature momentarily dazed and I escaped into a nearby clothing store.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was able to duck behind some shelves as it came back to its senses. It looked around, sniffing the air, then let out a cry somewhere between a croak and a growl. Presumably, it wasn't too happy about me getting away. It stood outside, waiting and I debated on what to do. Even if I went out the back, the path leading home would be in the monster's sight.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was willing to bet its eyes gave it a greater range of vision. I debated with myself on what to do, then my eyes fell on some mannequins. This was a long shot. I switched my shirt out with one that was roughly my size and also wearing jeans, then I put it by the window while the creature's attention was focused elsewhere. Its gaze eventually fell on it and sure enough, my half-assed plan worked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It let out the same noise as before and bull-rushed the window.  I was ducked by a check-out desk. When I heard the window shatter followed by the mannequin being attacked, I sprinted. I only had seconds before it realized I duped it. Thankfully, the woods provided a shortcut back to my house.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When I slammed and locked my front door behind me, I collapsed to the floor. I thought my lungs were going to burst and I was soaked. Christ, what was that thing? Where did it come from? Questions for later.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

First, I needed to dry off. I didn't go out for days, choosing instead to exercise inside. All the while, the rain never let up and in fact, poured harder. No way I was going to step foot outside with that thing waiting to rip me apart.  That said, I wasn't too keen on the idea of staying in either.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A week had passed by the time I worked up the courage to head out. Again, my plan was simple. Get in my car, go the opposite way I encountered the monster, and never come back unless I know it's taken care of. This went off without a hitch at first. It was during my drive I found out my method for salvation was doomed to fail.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The nearest town from where I was heading to is over an hour away. I drove double that and found nothing aside from some abandoned cars on the road. They gave off the same presence as the stores. It was as if everyone suddenly stopped mid-drive and left their vehicles. There were even still groceries in some of them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was at a loss for my next course of action. I could have kept driving for a while, sure. The issue is what would that have amounted to? It would eventually be dark again and if that creature was out there it probably meant other things were as well. In the end, I didn't have any choice other than to return home.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

On the way back, I broke my no-stealing rule and took supplies from cars. Then again, can it really be called that if nobody misses what's taken? I pushed aside my moral dilemma and filled the back of my car with nonperishable foods. Then I made it back to my house. It's been nearly a month since then and it's only now that I have wifi.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm not sure how long it'll last. In the meantime, I can upload this. I was right about there being more monsters. I've seen them on the occasion I've glanced outside. Some are nearly identical to the one I encountered.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Others are covered in fur or scales. I've observed ones that were also bipedal while others moved on four or even six legs. Due to this, I am not keeping any lights on besides my laptop which I've been typing this on. I can at least keep myself busy by using it to play games or watch movies. I also have a pair of headphones on. The possibility of those things having advanced hearing isn't a risk I'm willing to take.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I haven't even used my microwave because of this. If they have strong hearing, chances are they also have a super sense of smell. This means I have not used any food that requires the use of heat. Good thing I didn't have much anyway. I've been holding out alright, sustaining myself on canned beans and produce.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Some of them have that weird metallic taste. Oh well, beggars can't be choosers and I can count my blessings that the things roaming the streets aren't smart enough to check houses. I hope so anyway. The thing is, I don't think they were responsible for everyone else vanishing. My reason for this is that there was no damage to any of the locations I visited and those monsters are strong enough to rip a car door off its hinges.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I can hold out for a while, but not forever. What has scared me the most is what I checked before typing this up. I went on Google Maps to get a screengrab of my town's location. It's gone. I even searched it up and nothing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm willing to bet whatever made the people in my town disappear is also responsible for this. I guess the best I can do is  hope someone can track my connection. If anyone does make sure you bring a lot of firepower. Speaking of, I'm seriously regretting my no-gun rule. Too late now.

I do have some knives on me so I'm not entirely defenseless. Wish me luck I can last long enough for [help](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) to [arrive.](https://www.threads.net/@rose_black2222)
