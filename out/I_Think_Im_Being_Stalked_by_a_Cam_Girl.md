It started with a chat request on Instagram. I was 14 at the time and when I clicked on the request it led me to a group chat with around 36 other people. There was only one message.

 

**Rebecca69XOXO**

“Hey! Anyone interested? ;)”

 

Attached to this message was a link. This had happened a few times before, so I already knew not to click on the link. Besides the potential virus I would have gotten from doing so, I was also hesitant since one of the kids from my school called Bryce did a similar thing a few months ago and had uploaded a zip bomb instead. “Coincidentally” the people in the group chat besides Rebecca69XOXO were from my school and let’s just say the last time Bryce pulled this trick a few people couldn’t get their phones to work for weeks afterward. Her profile had no posts and no followers, and the profile picture she used was a girl with brown hair sitting on a sofa wearing a grey tank top.

 

**Me**

Nice try Bryce

 

**Rebecca69XOXO**

Aww thank you so much, You’re so sweet! How about you click the link and see how sweet I am ;)

 

**I\_MARSH**

I think she likes you man hahaha

 

Ian Marsh used to bully me a lot as a kid. Being a little overweight and having to wear glasses made me an easy target.  Ian liked to flex his influence every now and again. I think this was one of those times.

 

**Me**

Shut up


**Rebbeca69XOXO**

Nothing much, how are you? ;)

 

**I\_MARSH**

Geez man keep it in the DM’s hahaha

 

I left the group chat after this. There wasn’t much point arguing with what was clearly a chatbot as well as being ridiculed by Ian. Little did I know, this would play into Ian’s narrative of events when I went to school the next day. The rumour spread like wildfire around the school that I was apparently “in love” with a cam girl. In every class, break, and group chat the rumour was told, manipulated, and made its way back to me with an ever-developing narrative and an insult to go alongside. Loser, freak, perv, that sort of thing but this isn’t why I’m making this post. I think I’m being stalked by a cam girl.

 

This has been going on for over 6 years. Just as Ian suggested, Rebbeca did in fact keep it in the DM’s. I received thousands of messages. She wouldn’t leave me alone. “Hey”, “What’s up?”, “You're cute”. Just to give you an idea of what she would send. Each message was always followed up by the link. When I was 14 it didn’t matter all that much. My account was private at that point, so a lot of these messages appeared as requests which I didn’t really receive a notification of, but since coming to University I’ve had to use my account as a way of advertising my commitment to engineering in the hopes of being picked up by a company for placement. I need to keep my phone on silent due to the number of times it gets set off by her, and it’s not just Instagram anymore. Snapchat, Facebook, Tik Tok, Twitter and even emails. I don’t even know how she did it, but she even managed to get a hold of my school email. My name isn’t even in the email since my university creates them in accordance with our student number. I have no idea how she would even manage to associate 80764327 with me whatsoever. She started making personalised messages with things I would post or put in my bio.

 

**Rebecca69XOXO**

I’m all wet from kayaking today, maybe you can help me dry off ;)

 

**Rebecca69XOXO**

I’m struggling with homework, maybe you can teach me a lesson or two ;)

 

**Rebecca69XOXO**

I’m going to be doing squats at the gym today, think you can spot me? ;)

 

I never reply to her. Why would I? She’s clearly a bot and that link is clearly just going to be some sort of virus. As you can tell I wasn’t popular at school. From the messages she sent, you may have gleaned that I started to take better care of myself. I went to the gym, I did cardio, I ate better, and I even started to wear contact lenses instead of my thick, black-rimmed glasses. I started to feel good about myself. Something I hadn’t done in a very long time. Because of the rumour I never had a girlfriend. I never had my first kiss or a high school sweetheart. I had no one. A year ago I received a message from Tracy Lin. I had, had a crush on her for a long time. We worked on a group project together and when I contributed, she called me the “smart one”. I think about that compliment a lot.

 

**TracyLin678**

Hey

 

**Me**

Hey, what’s up?

 

**TracyLin678**

I’ve been thinking about you

 

I double-tapped to like her message.

 

**Me**

Oh yeah?

 

**TracyLin678**

Yeah, do you want to meet up this weekend?

 

I double-tapped to like her message.

 

**Me**

Sure, what did you have in mind?

 

**TracyLin678**

Maybe you can help me pick out a new bathing suit for the summer ;)

I blushed at this message. Finally, a girl was taking an interest in me. I told myself to play it cool. I’d like her message and then leave it for an hour. I didn’t want to appear too keen, but I also didn’t want to come across too uninterested. I hadn’t opened the message yet as it sat in my notification bar. I wanted to leave enough time to think about my response and not mess it up. I put my phone down and neatened up my already neat pile of books, fumbled around with my already solved Rubik’s cube, and then picked the phone back up again. I went to like the message when I realised something. The message had been highlighted in blue and underlined. It was a hyperlink. I didn’t like the message. I stared at my phone for a couple seconds confused and clicked on the profile. TracyLin678 had no followers, no posts, and was only following one person…me. My mind spun trying to find an answer. Was this Rebbeca? Was she learning?

 

TracyLin678 sent message after message for days. The real Tracy seemed to be in her prime with daily posts on her story of her and her new boyfriend. Their profile pictures were both the same. One day TracyLin678 stopped messaging. I think they knew I wasn’t going to fall for the link trick. Rebbeca continued to message me each hour though.

 

Last month I received a notification that someone had added me to another group chat. This time I only recognised the name of one.

 

**Rebecca69XOXO**

Hey! Anyone interested ;)

 

Attached to the message was a link.

 

**Bradders566**

Don’t mind if I do

 

This is as far as the conversation went. I assume Bradders566 or Brad had opened the link. Maybe he just got some free content or maybe he saw something he really shouldn’t have. Either way, he went radio silence on all his platforms. Believe me, I checked. I looked at his profile from where he sent the message, and he was an avid poster. Anything and everything no matter how uninteresting he would post about. Sometimes 3 times a day. His last post was a month ago same day as his message in the group chat.

 

She keeps sending me messages. It's not even a message anymore it’s just the link. It's every minute now. I block each of her accounts, but she just makes more. She wants me to open the link, but I won’t. I can’t. Not after seeing how Brad ended up.

 

I’ve been falling asleep at my computer for a couple of nights now. I’ve got a pretty big assignment, and the deadline is only getting closer. I keep having the same nightmare. In the dream, I click the link. The computer loads for a few seconds and then turns black before thick black cables launch from out of the screen and wrap around my wrists and ankles. Like snakes, they wrap around my limbs tightening until my fingers turn blue. My heart racing I gasp for air, but the cables keep coming. They enter my mouth. I choke as they tunnel down my throat and into my intestines. Lastly, they go for my eyes. Two cables each with a clip on the end which project into my sockets and clamp down. I wake up when this happens. Drenched in sweat and gasping for air. Call me paranoid but I swear the computers never the same as when I fell asleep. Whether it’s the keyboards in a different spot, the mouse being moved or a different window being open, it always different.

 

I couldn’t handle it anymore. Even if I didn’t fall asleep at my desk, I would still have the same nightmare night after night. I messaged Bradders566. I needed to know he was okay.

 

**Me**

Hey, man, I know this is a weird message to get, but are you okay?

 

**Bradders566**

Hey, I’m going kayaking this weekend. Maybe you can show me the ropes ;)

 

Attached to the message was a link. My stomach dropped and I felt like I was going to be sick. My hands were drenched in sweat as I shut down the computer. I don’t know what’s happening. I can’t trust anyone online anymore. Exam links sent by my University, Google Docs sent by my peers in group projects, and Facebook links sent by my parents, I can’t trust them. This is really starting to affect my life in a way I could have never anticipated. I need help, and I need it now.
