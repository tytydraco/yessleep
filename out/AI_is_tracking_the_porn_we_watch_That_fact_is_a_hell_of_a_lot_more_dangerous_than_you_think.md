I watch a lot of porn.

A *lot*. 

Homemade, professional, solo, group, lesbian, straight, coulrophilia, you name it. I’m not gay, but I sometimes dabble in the “gay” section of PornHub. I’ve even gotten into some scat videos when I was high as a weed kite. Pretty much everything except for furry shit, because that’s just weird.

Well I’ve watched *some* furry shit.

And after losing my internet connection for an entire day this summer, I swore that I’d never again go that long without access to some smut. So I got into downloading everything that tickled my pink. As a result, my computer’s alternate “user” page now has 1,913 different files on its desktop.

Needless to say, both my guard and my pants were down at around 11:30 p. m. last night. 

Which means I lost my shit in more ways than one upon hearing a furious pounding at my front door. 

And the fear shot up to eleven when I heard my door burst *open*. 

I hit the ground, my primal brain convinced that I could stay safe as long as I crawled to the darkest corner of my tiny apartment. I scrambled to the edge of my bed.

Heavy footsteps pounded through my living room, getting louder with each thud.

They were running toward the bedroom.

Nausea hit me as I realized that I’d left my phone by the computer. After a decisecond of consideration, I turned around and leapt to my feet. I grabbed the phone, bobbled it, nearly dropped it, then slammed it against my chest before doubling back and racing to the corner of the room.

I dove and rolled under the bed just as the bedroom door slammed against the wall.

I tried to quiet my breathing to inaudibility, but that’s impossible when your heart is racing 180 beats a minute. A cacophony of footfalls told me that several men had entered my room.

Covering my mouth with one hand, I dialed my phone with the other. 

9-1-2 *shit* 9-2 *no* 9-4 *control yourself* 8 *that’s not control*

Tears stung my eyes as I grappled with the realization that my fingers would not stop shaking enough for me to dial 911.

Then the footsteps halted beside my bed and yanked the covers aside, and it didn’t matter anymore. 

I looked up to see two policemen staring down at me.

I had been terrified when fearing that 911 wouldn’t respond fast enough. That fear grew a new dimension when I realized that the agency I had assumed to be my safety net was, in fact, the thing coming to hurt me. 

Two sets of hands grabbed my legs and dragged me from under the bed, slapping handcuffs on my wrists before I could show them that I wasn’t resisting. They pulled me to my feet and stared.

“For *fuck’s* sake, Johnson, would you look at that? He’s still got the boner.”

The next couple of hours were a blur. I imagine they read me my Miranda Rights, but I don’t have any memory of it. I oscillated back and forth between calmness at the knowledge that I didn’t do anything wrong and sheer terror *because* not doing anything wrong wasn’t keeping me safe. A deep dread settled into my gut as I realized that the world I had assumed and believed was not the same reality that was coming to hurt me. 

I was eventually assigned a public defender. I knew who he was right away, because his forlorn look of resignation told me this was the only person who didn’t want to fuck me over. 

“Can you tell me why I’m here?” I asked as soon as his butt hit the chair.

The pale, balding attorney stared back at me. The bags under his eyes had bags. He slid an image forward. “Do you recognize this photo?”

I looked down at a generic still shot of some girl sucking a guy’s dick. “Um – not really? It’s… porn. There’s a lot of it floating around.”

“This particular porn was taken from your computer.”

“There’s a lot of porn floating around on my computer.”

“And this particular couple are both three months shy of their eighteen birthdays.”

“Ooooooooooh, shit.”

We stared at each other. 

“Um – how does anyone know that?” I asked, fear outrunning my awkwardness to force my mouth to speak. “I mean – I don’t remember this particular image, though I wouldn’t be surprised if it was in my hard drive. But how could any person possibly know the age of people in random internet videos?”

My attorney ran his hands furiously through the few wisps of hair left on his head, pulling several of the final strands with him. “You’re right. No person could possibly know. A *program*, however, one driven by artificial intelligence, can cross-reference a photo from the images it’s scraped and banked, then determine the subject being photoed and the age of the file. Where did you get this specific video?”

I shrugged. “The internet’s mostly porn.”

He shook his head. “It sounds like you didn’t know what you were looking at, but that’s not going to save you, unfortunately. Even if we could prove that you were deceived – which we can’t – you were still in possession of contraband at the end of the day. Did you click every disclaimer before entering a website?”

I shrugged. “Doesn’t everybody?”

His shoulders slumped.

He was nice enough to allow me to borrow his laptop, which I’m using now. He made me promise not to tell *anyone* about what just happened to me, so I lied to him. Yes, I’m fucking over my case. But I had to let someone, anyone know. Maybe I can make up for what I did if I save just one person. 

So please, the next time you’re jerking off in front of the computer, just remember.
