After an incident happened with one of my deliveries and I be forced to pay for something I didn't do, I decided to install a hidden camera on my cap. It seems strange, but it was a suggestion from a friend to stay protected. It seemed like the only solution to me.

I deliver documents, it's a fairly easy job, however, the recipient doesn't always accept receiving the documents and wants to blame me for them. There are divorce papers, outdated bills, in short, what you don't want to deal with, but sometimes you have to.

Even though it was self-employment, I needed to complete some bureaucracy to be a kind of "self-employed postman", sign a liability contract, so if anything happens to the documents, I'll take the responsibility.

One night, I was on my way to my last delivery, I was hungry, I couldn't stand sitting behind the wheel anymore nor talking to people who were always in a bad mood. But I needed to then I had to deliver a paper to an office downtown.

I arrived at the building, I told the security why I was there, I was looking for Dr. Phillip Durant and here are divorce papers. I got permission to go up and knocked on the doctor's door, it was ajar, I asked for permission and went in. Doctor had his head down on the table, and through the reflection of the painting on the wall, I could see a wedding picture on the computer's screen.

It wasn't rare when I went to deliver divorce papers to find people in this situation, sad, crying, angry, so, unfortunately, I was already used to it and become a bit indifferent. 

After a few seconds, I decided to make a noise and he raised his head, he looked horrible, he looked like he had been crying for hours, his face was completely pale, huge circles under his eyes... his lifeless eyes. He asked me what I wanted, in a harsh tone, before asking if I wasn't polite enough to knock on the door before entering.

As I said, meeting people in the worst possible mood was nothing new, I didn't answer, I just apologized and left the papers on the table and said good night.  When I left, I closed the door and heard the doctor crying inside as I walked towards the elevator. I swear I was a little shaken. I mean, an extremely successful doctor with a beautiful family cried like a child. I couldn't just ignore that.

The next day, I was talking to the security guard outside the tribunal and he mentioned a suicide last night. I didn't care much. Then I was called by one of the lawyers probably to give me more documents and I could start my work day.

I had to deliver a testament to a widow, you might think it's strange that I knew the type of document, but it was an informal warning so I wouldn't forget how important the document was and not do anything stupid.

Anyway, I arrived at the widow's building and read the recipient's name before arriving at reception 

"I come to deliver a document to Mrs. Isabela Durant"

I didn't even pay attention to the surname until I arrived at the apartment and came across the coffin of Dr. Durant, to whom I delivered the divorce document less than 12 hours ago. I tried to hide my shock, I just handed the document to Mrs. Durant and left.

I couldn't resist my curiosity and asked one of the cleaning ladies who was in the hallway. 

"Do you know how Dr. Durant died?" 
"It was a shot in the mouth inside his office. Are you a relative or a friend?" She asked me
"No, but you know that I gave him a document last night. I was probably the last person he saw in life" I said
"Really? What time was that?" She asked curiously.
"8 o'clock at night, maybe 8:30pm" I said
"No, baby, don't talk nonsense. When the doctor left to another dimension it wasn't even 6:30pm"

That information gave me chills. I immediately ran home to check the footage of the cap cam and what I saw that night, in fact, what I DIDN'T see terrorised me. 

I skipped to the last hours of footage, until the part where I walk to Dr. Durant's office, I enter and the camera didn't capture anything on the office table, no one was there, I was alone looking at an empty office and apologising nobody. I wasn't crazy, I saw the doctor with his head down, talking me rudely and the camera even captured the sound of crying when I closed the door. I didn't know what to say. I had no words.
