Guilt can eat you alive, I can say I experienced it first hand. 

When people think of cannibalism, notorious serial killers like Jeffery Dahmer, Ted Bundy will pop into anyone's head

Though there is another type of cannibalism that is far less comprehensible then just regular, and that is auto cannibalism. Eating oneself.

Its even been labeled as a disorder called autophagia, usually co-morbid with things such as schizophrenia, psychosis, the types of things that will put you strapped to a bed basically.

I have autophagia, but I'm not crazy? I work, I go to school, I have friends, I have a life. 

Sure I may have a little bit of darker thoughts then some people but that can be hidden

Until I decided to take action on it.

First it started with scabs, disgusting, I know. Eating scabs is something you wouldn’t normally see but it's just like someone biting their nails or chewing their coffin nails. It wasn't a bad thing, even if the taste was bad. 

Food fills your senses, you can feel it on the flavor coating your tongue till it goes down your throat. Scabs on the other hand are grainy and have somewhat an iron kind of taste. It could go from feeling liquid pus to dried blood at times to. I accepted these tastes, I don't know why. I don't know.  
 Then a stench, a stench you can taste, it's as if eating a band-aid that you have had on for the weekend was shoved down your throat.

I know it was disgusting

I felt disgusting

And somehow it just made me keep doing it

  
  


After a while of this I needed something more, I needed more tastes. 

What is beneath the pale skin that I see, how white is a bone, what will muscle tissue look like before a wound clots with blood.  
What did all of these things taste like inside of me.  
 I could go on about the details I was so morbidly curious about my body.

But I am not fucking crazy.

I can't be, I still function, I can see, I can work, I can eat. I can do everything a person can do, it's like living a double life of just someone I truly wanted to be and it was a curious person to explore, needed to explore what lied beneath me. 

I started cutting myself, first it started with tiny, open wounds that showed a white sheet beneath. It was intriguing. I would pry at my cuts, open them with my fingers as wide as I could, try and peer at what was inside of me. 

Eventually I got to see though.

Now, before I go into to much detail about this I did at this point show some kind of… off-ness my friends realized. I would get band-aids more often, not caring to answer my friends questions on why I was. I started to take energy pills because I was always cutting I got tired, so quickly. I stayed awake to cut, I maybe got two hours of sleep those days.

My family told me during this time of my life, there was nothing behind my eyes. It was was just dark, there was no flickering interest of anything. I would avoid there eyes but when they caught a glimpse it was as if they were struck with the fear that I wasn't human anymore because of my lack of life.

I had an obsession at this point.
