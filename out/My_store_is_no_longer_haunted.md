Hey folks, I know I left you all hanging, but I finally had time to wrap up my story. As you read through it, you'll understand why. If you need the latest Part, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/18d11bc/i_honestly_dont_know_if_i_can_purge_the_curse/). Anyway, thanks for sticking around. Have a great end of the year and happy holidays to all of you. May God help us!

Well, the room was tense, filled with silence only broken by the distant rumble of Butch's Jeep. I looked at Kenway, a mix of confusion and determination in his eyes. He nodded, conveying a confidence I wasn't sure he possessed.

Kenway: You can do this, Jake. Remember, he's vulnerable now without the amulet. You can use some weapon or whatever to stun him. He may not die, but he can still feel pain, very well.

Butch, outside, continued yelling as he approached the door, anger overflowing in his words. I decided to act quickly, rushing to lock the entrance and buy some time. After doing that, I went to the counter and fumbled blindly underneath to grab the weapon as quickly as possible. I couldn't find it, and Butch kept advancing, now more slowly. I crouched to look, and the old smoke-stained barrel wasn't there. I heard a mechanical click behind me. It seems I had found the weapon, and it was cocked and aimed at me.

Mr. Gonzales: Jake, my boy. You've got yourself into trouble, huh?

He smiled, but it was an empty smile, betrayed by hidden malice. Butch approached, eyes fixed on me, and Gonzales blocked my escape route.

Me: What's going on here? Mr. Gonzales, are you betraying me too?

Mr. Gonzales: Betrayal? Not exactly. I'm just doing what's best for me.

Still with the gun pointed at me, he walked backward to the door and unlocked it, letting the Sheriff in.

Butch: Looks like your boss here made the right choice. Now, Jake, it's time to pay for your misdeeds.

He aimed his rifle.

Butch: Come on, bring it. I hate shooting people like you, need a good excuse that you attacked first...

I stood still, looking at him. There was nothing that could be done.

Butch: Okay, you've exhausted me. Say goodnight, Jake.

"Goodnight, Jake!" - A ghostly voice echoed, and with that, all the lights in the store went out (except, I think, for the soda machine).

Butch: What the hell, Gonzales! Quickly, find the circuit breaker!

I felt like a guiding hand, an intuitive force showing me where and how Butch was. I lunged at him, turning his gun away, just seconds before Gonzales lit the light. We were then in this body-to-body game to try to take the gun from each other, when a sharp crack whizzed by my ear, making me deaf for a while. Gonzales almost shot me.

Mr. Gonzales: Don't make things harder, be a good collaborator, Jake, as you always were.

Butch tried to push me into the line of fire; I was lost. That's when, over his shoulder, I saw the office open. Under his desk, an empty meat plate. Would I die? Maybe, but it was a necessary risk. I grabbed the gun more tightly and pushed Butch with my shoulder. He grabbed my shirt and pulled me along, the gun flying from my hands and landing at the feet of my (now ex) boss. I quickly locked the door when we entered. It was time for the nightly snack, and if I had to send this damn racist to the devil, God, I would be part of the feast with pleasure. The sheriff clung to the bones like talismans (and now that I could see them clearly). It was a few seconds of silence and tension... but nothing. Suddenly, outside, a noise started. It was Gonzales; it started with shouts that seemed like fear, then panic, and finally, pain and suffering. He begged to die two or three times before falling silent again. Wet noises of things breaking and swallowing filled the air. I and Butch didn't even react for that moment until, suddenly, I jumped on one of the bones, untying its knot skillfully.

Butch: You damn traitor, what's happening here?

He said, regaining his senses and advancing towards me. I put my full weight on the ground and pushed him up, giving a kick with all I had. He flew backward, hitting his back on a filing cabinet and falling. I ran to the door and opened it, ready to see a sea of blood. However, nothing. Just one of the guns, a standard deputy's rifle. I quickly ran to the gun while already hearing Butch approaching. I threw myself on the ground to grab it, and when I turned, he was almost on top of me. I saw his expression change when he saw the gun and realized I was about to shoot. I pulled the trigger, and I watched as the quick fragments opened spots leaking red all over his shirt. He fell, and without wasting time, I stood up and gave two more shots, one of them in his face. I checked for a moment his vital signs. He was dead, but I knew not for long. I looked at the amulet in his hand; it was loose, almost hanging. I ran my fingers over it. Instantly, like a contraction, his fingers closed, and his hand became a fist hitting my face. I fell backward seeing stars as he took the rifle from my hand. I walked back helplessly as he pointed the barrel at me, about to shoot. The empty click echoed one, two, three times. There were no more bullets.

Butch: No problem...

He took the gun as if it were a bat and hit my stomach. I fell, unable to breathe.

Butch: It's going to be more fun...

I grabbed a can from the bottom shelf and hit his face, now decayed but quickly taking its original form again. He howled as I struck the rough-edged metal on his nose still without skin. I gave another blow, breaking the thin aluminum can. He, however, held my hands. He squeezed my fist into a closed shape, causing one of the fragments of the can to pierce my palm with more and more force. I lost strength doing that, and he handcuffed me.

Butch: We always got along, didn't we?

He spoke while rubbing his nose, now almost complete.

Butch: You just had to play your part. But you had to meddle where you weren't called, huh?

He hung his macabre pendant around his neck while I tried to deal with the pain and move away as much as possible. He noticed. And calmly, with the same sadistic smile from his past photographs, he took a hunting knife from his belt.

Butch: You're going to bleed, kid... like a pig.

I had walked to the wall. He was a few steps away. There was no way out. I was helpless, hands tied... But then it came to me, the idea that could end it all. I projected myself toward him, raising my arms. I think he didn't expect that because he didn't defend himself. I drove the fragment that was in my hand into his neck, passing through the cord of the amulet. At the same time, I felt a sharp pain on the side of my body. We both hit each other.

Butch: You... got me... for real.

He spun the knife.

Butch: But if I go down, you're coming with me...

Blood started to trickle from his mouth, and he recoiled.

Kenway appeared, along with Beth. She stepped on the small bone, crushing it.

Kenway: Judgment time has come. Time to reap what your actions have sown. Not just for what you've done to us, but for all those who died in your place... for this entire town...

Butch: Get on with it already. You're going to give a little speech now? You guys are just a bunch of Ni-

Beth lunged at him, tearing a chunk from his shoulder with a bite. He screamed. Piece by piece, inch of flesh by inch of flesh, she devoured him. He remained conscious the whole time, even though biologically it shouldn't be possible. I turned away not to look when there was only half of his body.

I felt a hand on my shoulder.

Kenway: You can look now, Jake... We, again, apologize for everything. I guess we caused trouble too. But at least it's over. Don't worry about anything; we'll figure out a way to clear your name.

I felt a pulsation in my abdomen. The cut was bleeding thick blood. I fell to my knees.

Kenway: We... called the police and an ambulance. Thanks again.

My vision blurred a bit as I fell face-first onto the cold floor. I saw the couple walking out; they walked hand in hand. After a few steps, they stopped, turned to me. Kenway tipped his hat in a greeting, and Beth, in the same manner, lifted the corners of her dress in a brief curtsy. And with that, I blacked out.

I woke up hours later. In a hospital. The staff asked some questions, and days later, the police came. Apparently, someone had made an anonymous tip by phone, saying they saw the sheriff trying to shoot me and stabbing me. He is now a fugitive, and Gonzales is considered his accomplice. Legally, there were no heirs, so until further notice, I'm in charge of the store now. I started walking freely two days ago, made some changes to the store, cleaned the place, rearranged the stock, and now, you could say there are no more special rules for the night shift. There haven't been any more strange incidents. Or rather, just one...

Yesterday, I was in the store during the night shift when I decided to close. It was around 1 a.m. I walked through the cold parking lot when something hit my foot. It was a can. I looked up, and I saw a figure in a hoodie looking at me. He started approaching, and by the moonlight, I saw his face.

Me: Didn't expect to see you here... Everything okay?

Ryan: I've been talking to Dave, and well, it seems like you need some employees. What do you think?

I smiled.

Me: Mind working the night shift?
