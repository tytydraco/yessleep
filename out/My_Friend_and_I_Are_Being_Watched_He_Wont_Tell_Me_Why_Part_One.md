I really don’t know where to begin here. First off, I’m not a big technology guy. I really only learned how to use computers for work, which probably sounds ridiculous coming from someone who’s 30 and not 80, but I just don’t get the appeal. I was raised on a little farm in the woods, and even when I moved out, I yearned for the peace that a night in the chilled forest air under the stars provided. 

Nowadays I live in a little town just outside a major city–I won’t say which one–and I work at a small fast food place. It’s a chain, technically, but you haven’t heard of it. There’s only like three of them. We pretty much only serve steak with various starches (potatoes mostly, but also mac and cheese for some reason) slapped on top. It’s not great. It probably doesn’t sound that bad at first, but remember: this is fast food. With a drive-thru. Imagine trying to eat an overcooked steak in your car. With plastic cutlery. 

This wasn’t exactly my dream, but because my family owns some land, I’m able to live comfortably in a little cabin in a wooded area. I save on a lot of expenses by keeping my technology very minimal, and I’ve been able to save a decent amount because of it. Fortunate and frugal, which is pretty much all I can hope for considering I never attended any formal schooling. Doesn’t make me stupid, just means a lot of people think I am. 

Now, you’re probably wondering why I, someone who is literally writing this on a flip phone right now, is even on Reddit in the first place. Well, I made a new friend recently. And since then, I feel like I’m being watched. Not by him. Like someone was watching him when we met. And now they’re watching me. 

I was alone at work that morning, I often am. Honestly I could probably leave the place on its own for several hours and we’d hardly miss any customers. But I never did, I had just enough integrity for that, barely. I took my time getting ready to open, not expecting anyone to show for a few hours anyway. Then when I walked over to flip the sign and unlock the door, I saw a man just waiting outside. I slowly flipped the sign to open, a little confused why someone was here, I mean there are so many better places to get breakfast. 

When I unlocked the door, he immediately came in, I barely had time to remove the key from the lock. He looked to be about my age, either slightly older, or slightly more stressed. He had a single streak of gray in his hair, and uneven stubble like he hadn’t shaved it right and just gave up. His eyes were wild, darting back and forth, paranoid. His hands were shaking.

“Hey, can I getcha something? Like water?” I asked it kindly, and I wasn’t gonna charge him. I mean, from appearance alone, I was genuinely worried about the guy, he looked freaked out. But he just shook his head.

“I’m fine. I’m sorry.” he spoke like he was only just remembering how. At the time I thought maybe English wasn’t his first language, or maybe he was a. *Massive* introvert. “I’m sorry,” he repeated.

“It’s okay, man. You didn’t do anything wrong.” The man’s shoulders seemed to relax at that statement, “Aaaand I can get your food out real quick since no one’s here.” he stiffened again.

“I’m not hungry, sorry.” he glanced away, and then glanced back, eyes landing on my nametag, “Ee-van-der… Evander, I… I need work, if that’s okay.” 

“O-oh. Okay. Um.” I hoped I didn’t seem too surprised, but I’m sure I did, “I’ll see what I can do. Do you have a résumé?” he nodded and handed it to me, “Can you hang out here for a sec? I’m gonna call my boss.” he nodded again, and I headed to the back room. 

I‘m sure I know what you guys are thinking at this point. This guy was clearly weird, maybe mentally ill, kinda paranoid. He made no move to sit when I left, standing still, wringing his hands nervously by the front door. But I don’t know how to explain it. Something about him was just. So genuine. I’ve always been a decent judge of character, and I could tell this guy was just a little lost in life, completely harmless. And. well, we needed a new guy. Right now it’s just me and Katie since Carlton quit. Plus summer’s almost over, so Katie’s hours will work around her class schedule soon. I looked over the résumé in my hand. Senric. Not a ton of work experience, but claims he’s a quick learner, so he’ll be alright. Not a lengthy résumé, but honestly it isn’t required here. I called the owner.

“What?” She answered immediately, sounding irritated I bothered her, “I’m busy.” I wanted to ask why it was my fault she answered the phone when she’s so busy, but I knew better than that.

“A guy wants to work here, what do I actually do with that? Am I the interview guy now?”

“It’s Carlton.”

“No, he quit, remember?”

“Right… yeah you’re the interview guy.”

“Cool. Do I need training for that?” I asked, and she just hung up on me, “Awesome…” I walked back out to the entrance, the guy–Senric–was still just standing there, “Senric?” He looked up at me like a deer caught in the headlights, like he was surprised to hear his name, even though he knew I had his résumé, “We can do an interview now, if you feel ready.”

“Y-yeah. Sorry if I’m a bit strange… I haven’t had a real job before.” That wasn’t what his résumé said. 

“That’s okay. Let’s sit here.” I gestured to a table and pulled out a chair for him. We didn’t have a good interview area, so the front tables are as good as any. “My name’s Vander, or Evander, whatever.” I shook his hand, his handshake was firm and professional. Very practiced.

“I’m Senric. You uh…” he shrunk in on himself as he said, “You might’ve seen me… on TV.”

“Oh no, I don’t have a TV.”

“Really? I thought everyone did. It *seemed* like everyone did.”

“No, just most people.” 

“That’s amazing.” His entire attitude changed immediately. Nervousness gone, like a weight was lifted, “So you actually don’t know me? That’s amazing!” He repeated himself a lot.

The rest of the interview was charming. I hired him. And for whatever grain of salt you take reddit posters’ word for, he was a good guy. I don’t blame him for anything. Even if his employment marked the start of something really fucking weird. 

I don’t really know how to talk about what’s happening quite yet, so I’ll just ask this: How does one go about asking their already-paranoid friend about people watching from the woods? And more importantly, how do I inform him the whole being watched thing started after I hired him without implying it’s his fault? I don’t wanna make the guy feel bad. Any advice is appreciated.
