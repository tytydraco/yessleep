Three months after I got the IUD, the pain started getting worse. Not the dull ache they warned me about. This was sharper. And it was building. It didn’t feel like my body was rejecting it. It felt like it was… building something. I started bleeding only on Wednesdays. Always Wednesday. Always at 3:17am. Like a schedule. Like a ritual.

But it wasn’t bleeding, not really. It was slower, more deliberate. A kind of leaking, like the earth giving up its secrets one clot at a time. Lately, it came laced with white flecks. Calcified specks. Fragments that scraped when they passed. I started bruising in strange shapes: circles, rows, outlines that looked too much like petals pressed into skin. I’d wake with the taste of iron in my mouth and this pressure low in my abdomen that didn’t feel like pain. It felt like intention.

My hands started trembling. Words slipped out of reach. Eventually, even my thoughts felt slippery. Some mornings I’d forget my own address. The stairs made my heart race. Light hurt. My body started flinching at the smell of red meat. The one time I forced down spinach, I vomited so hard I burst vessels in my eyes. It wasn’t that I wouldn’t eat iron. I couldn’t. It felt like the thing growing inside me wanted me hollow.

The scans showed shadows. Then shapes. Then silence. And then something worse: inconsistency. The technician frowned, said the formation near my left ovary was no longer there. That it had “shifted.” I asked what he meant. He didn’t answer. He just printed the image, handed it to me, and left the room. A curve that looked like a jawbone. A white cluster that looked like teeth. A delicate arc of something that could be ribs. Too small to live. Too defined to ignore.

Not a fetus. Not a tumour. Something else. Something blooming.

I started naming them. The parts. Not like children. Not like people. Like plants. Bones budding like lilies, pale and still as grief. A tooth blooming from my endometrium. A spine stretching from the wall of my womb, curling like ivy in spring. I could feel them sometimes. Shifting. Rearranging. Not violently. Not cruel. Just... trying. It wasn’t a baby. It wasn’t a tumour. It was a garden. Of all the things my body had never been allowed to carry. Of all the pain it had been told to swallow. It bloomed with ache. It flowered with grief.

Sometimes I dreamed of roots curling through my pelvis, of ribs sprouting like branches, of molars nesting in soft muscle. Sometimes I didn’t dream at all. I’d just wake to the feeling of something settling. A weight inside me. Not cruel. Not kind. Just there.

One night, I tried to remove it. Not the garden. The IUD. I was careful at first. Sterile gloves. Mirror. Breath held. But the moment my fingers found the string, the pain came. Searing, full-bodied, like my insides were clamping down to protect it. My knees gave out. My vision went white. I woke hours later on the bathroom floor, cheek pressed to the tile, fingernails caked with dirt I didn’t remember touching.

I stopped going to appointments. Stopped asking questions. No one believes a body can grow sorrow. No one wonders what a womb might remember. I stopped speaking aloud.

It doesn’t matter.

The garden is listening.
I don’t bleed anymore.
Only grow.
