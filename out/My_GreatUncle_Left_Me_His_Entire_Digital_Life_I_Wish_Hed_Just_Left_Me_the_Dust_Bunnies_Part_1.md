Okay, look. I’m not prone to flights of fancy. My job involves staring at spreadsheets until my eyes bleed, my hobbies are stuff like "watching TV" and "occasionally assembling IKEA furniture." I’m grounding this right upfront because what I’m starting to find… it feels like the opposite of grounded. And I need someone, anyone, to tell me I’m just overtired or stressed or seeing patterns where there are none. Please.



It started three weeks ago when my Great-Uncle Bernard passed away. Eighty-something, lived alone in the same slightly crumbling suburban house he’d owned since the seventies, mostly kept to himself. I barely knew him – maybe five encounters total, mostly awkward family funerals. He was the quiet, vaguely academic type: thick glasses, tweed jackets even in summer, always smelled faintly of pipe tobacco and old paper. ‘Eccentric Bernard,’ the family called him, and left it at that. No kids, never married. Turns out I, being his closest living relative not in a nursing home or overseas, inherited… well, everything.



Which mostly meant the house and its contents. The house is… fine. Needs work. A lot of work. But the real inheritance shock was his office. Bernard wasn't just eccentric; he was a digital hoarder on a scale I can barely comprehend.



We’re talking PC towers from different decades humming under dust, tethered to a terrifying Medusa’s head of external drives spanning forgotten eras – USBs, older SCSI blocks, even Zip drives. Alongside sat boxes overflowing with floppies, CDs, and DVDs. Shelves crammed with photo albums, binders bulging with scanned documents, receipts, letters. Tucked away in one binder, amidst yellowing utility bills, I found a receipt from '78 for a single shovel and three bags of lime, nothing else, with a weird little spiral doodled in the margin. Just Bernard being Bernard, I figured then, meticulously filing even the mundane oddities. And in a closet, a shoebox holding about twenty unlabeled microcassette tapes. My job, as executor and sole beneficiary, was to wade through this digital avalanche, find the will (thankfully filed properly with a lawyer), locate any vital financials, and then… decide what to keep, wipe, or toss. Monumental. Depressing. Who saves this much?



The first week was a blur of wrestling with ancient operating systems (hello, Windows XP!), finding adapters, and listening to the groan of dying hard drives. Most of it was digital detritus: corrupted data, endless duplicates, and thousands of bafflingly mundane photos – shelf arrangements, close-ups of wallpaper patterns, the same garden gnome from ten different angles. His scanned journals were equally riveting: decades of tiny, meticulous script detailing weather observations, grocery lists, books read, and brief, factual notes on local happenings – "Mrs. Henderson’s cat missing (Persian, grey)" or "Power outage 3:17 AM - 4:52 AM, transformer suspected." My system became brutally simple: boot a drive, keyword search for 'will,' 'account,' 'policy,' glance at the root directories for anything obviously vital, then mentally tag the drive for the scrap heap. It felt less like archaeology, more like digital waste disposal.



The first crack in the mundane appeared last Tuesday. I was navigating an older IDE drive, clicking through a folder labelled “Summer\_1988”. Inside were typical Bernard photos – his backyard, a bird bath, the same stretch of fence from slightly different angles. Standard definition, slightly grainy shots from some early consumer camera.



Then I hit IMG\_0742.JPG. It showed the side of his house, afternoon sun on peeling paint, overgrown rose bushes in the foreground. Normal. Except… deep in the background, visible through a gap in the foliage near the back corner of the neighbour’s property line, something was wrong.



The resolution was poor, partially obscured by leaves, but it looked like… a figure. Tall, unnaturally thin, and angled strangely, as if bent or leaning too far forward from the waist, almost like a hinge. Dark, lacking detail, practically a silhouette despite the daylight. My first thought: trick of light, weird shadow, garden statue I couldn't quite place. Or just digital noise, a random cluster of dark pixels. Zooming in only dissolved it into blocky colours.



I stared. Vaguely human-shaped, but the proportions felt off. Too thin? Limbs too long maybe? And that angle… it didn't look physically natural, like a joint was stressed past its limit. I eventually shrugged it off. Pareidolia. Seeing faces in clouds, figures in static. Classic brain glitch. Plus, a 30-year-old photo from a primitive camera. I clicked to the next image, IMG\_0743.JPG – same scene, likely seconds later. The figure, smudge, whatever it was, was gone.



See? Glitch. Shadow. Odd neighbour. Nothing. I closed the folder, pushed it from my mind, and moved on.



Until yesterday.



I’d progressed to a newer drive, "System\_Backups\_2015-2017". More system files, browser caches, photos. And a folder named "Ambient\_Recordings". Inside: dozens of MP3s, meticulously labelled with dates and locations. "Kitchen\_Sounds\_Oct12\_2016", "LivingRoom\_Night\_Feb04\_2017", "Office\_Hum\_May30\_2015".



Why? Why record hours of household noise? Bernard’s eccentricity striking again, I supposed. Tinnitus maybe? Seemed unlikely. Boredom and morbid curiosity won out. I double-clicked one: "Back\_Porch\_Evening\_Jun17\_2016.mp3".



It delivered exactly what the label promised: crickets chirping, distant traffic hum, the clink of ice in a glass (Bernard must have been sitting out there). An hour long. I skipped forward randomly. More crickets. A far-off dog bark. Faint wind chimes.



Then, around the 43-minute mark, I skipped right into something else. Beneath the crickets, incredibly faint, almost lost in leaf rustle or maybe static, was another sound. A voice.



Not clear speech. A low, raspy whisper. Sibilant, guttural, barely audible. I couldn't parse words, just this… texture of sound for maybe three or four seconds before it vanished back into the night ambience.



I rewound. Headphones on, volume cranked. There it was again. Faint. Unsettling. It didn’t sound like Bernard. Didn’t sound like background TV or radio. It sounded… close. Like someone whispering right beside the microphone.



My skin went cold. Okay, that was undeniably weird. Radio interference? A neighbour talking, distorted by distance? MP3 compression artifacts? I listened again. The quality of the sound… it felt dry. Ancient-sounding.



I tried another file, "Office\_Hum\_Jan22\_2017.mp3". Just the computer's low drone, house creaks. Normal. Another, "Garden\_Noon\_Aug05\_2015.mp3". Birds, distant lawnmower. Normal.



I almost closed the folder, ready to dismiss the whisper as audio junk. Then I glanced back at the file name: "Back\_Porch\_Evening\_Jun17\_2016.mp3". June 17th.



Why did that date ping something in my brain?



I pulled up the spreadsheet tracking processed drives. Scanned the list… no. Not a date I'd noted. But it snagged at my memory.



Wait. The photo. IMG\_0742.JPG. The one with the weird figure. When was it taken?



Ten minutes of navigating back through the old IDE drive’s labyrinthine structure later, I found it again. Selected file. Checked properties.



Date Taken: 6/17/1988.



June 17th.



Okay. Hold on. Not the same date. One is 1988, the other 2016. Exactly 28 years apart. To the day.



Coincidence. Has to be. June 17th isn't magically significant, right? It's just a date. People take photos on dates. Record audio on dates. See weird shapes in blurry pictures and mishear static. Totally unrelated events, decades apart.



It has to be a coincidence.



But sitting there, staring at the two file names, the photo properties window open beside the audio player paused on that near-silent anomaly, I felt a chill that had nothing to do with the dusty air conditioning.



It’s just… so much data. An overwhelming, suffocating amount. And finding two distinct anomalies, two points of unsettling static in the mundane signal, landing on the exact same calendar date, decades apart…



It feels like spotting a correlation in static, a faint pattern in the random noise that suddenly makes you question if the noise was ever random at all.



I packed up shortly after that yesterday. Couldn't stomach digging anymore. But I can’t shake it. That thin, wrongly-bent shape in the photo. That dry, ancient-sounding whisper.



It's probably nothing. Just Bernard's eccentricities amplified by digital decay and my own fatigue making connections that aren't real. Being in a dead relative's house is inherently creepy, right?



Probably.



I’m going back tomorrow. Three towers, maybe ten hard drives, and those damn microcassettes still wait.



I’ll let you know if I find anything else. Or maybe I’ll just find proof it’s all noise, and I can finally wipe these drives clean and walk away.



I really hope it's the latter.
