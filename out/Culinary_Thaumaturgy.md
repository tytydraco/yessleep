It appeared to me suddenly, one autumn morning. The incantation to everlasting life, carved into my bedroom door. The raven said I could only cast it on three, only three beings. 

He never said it had to be people, so I casted it on my swine, my cow, and my chicken. Three of my animals, so I could feast on the meat, eggs and milk they would produce me, without ever passing away.

However, I'd be shocked to discover what happens to an animal when it lives past its expiration date. My hen, who once produced plentiful eggs, now laid rotten, putrid things.

Things that smelled of death, things I wouldn't even consider the same species as their mother. The eggs hatched with gray yolk and squeaked out half baked bird abominations, despite never being inseminated.

The half formed chicks looked up at me with fear from the pan that I had cracked them over. With gray skin and lifeless eyes, they squirmed in puddles of embryonic fluid for mere moments before they expired.

I decided I would stop eating the hen’s young. The ever regenerating meat of my swine remained the same delicious flavor, however, the animal itself was now more of a beast. 

With each chop of flesh I took off the animal, the stronger and larger it grew, till it began to stand on two legs, walk around my house, wear clothing, and even speak short sentences. 

“Have you…you can… you are…you make me…” It would oink, in a deep piggy voice. I feared it would attack me, given its sheer intimidating size. I decided I would stop butchering the pig. 

Lastly, the cow stopped moving much at all, which is saying a lot for a cow. It was literally frozen solid on the ground, you'd think it had died. 

Though you could see no color in its eyes, no rising and falling of its chest when it breathed, I can assure you it was very much alive. The first assurance of its life was the amount of milk it produced. 

Not from its udders, no, from the ground. I plugged my nose the morning I smelled it, the smell of curdled milk. It fumed out of my basement, and upon walking down the dark, creaking steps, I saw it. 

Pooling in my basement in a thick, frothy foam. The soil was always damp, giving in to every step. I even noticed that the trees that once leaked sap from their trunks now dribbled cold, flavorless milk. 

I didn't know how to stop the cow. I took an axe from my woodshed, these animals now lived decades longer than they should've, it was time for it to end. First to go was the chicken, who I chased with an axe. 

It ran around without a head, quickly growing one back. I hacked it to many pieces, cut it up faster than the infernal feathered freak could grow back, then burned the writhing pieces. 

Still, eggs appeared without the body. I stomped on the eggs, to no avail. They kept appearing. I tried to ignore it. Next to go was the cow. It put up no fight as I set the beast ablaze, but it did scream. 

I watched as it wriggled weakly, screaming and moaning quieter and quieter, then it stopped. Much to my surprise, the bones of the cow continued to shift without any flesh, and I grinded the bones into powder, and spread them in the lake. 

Milk still appeared without the body. Last to go was the pig, the one I feared the most. However, the wretched pig was nowhere to be seen. I searched the barn, the house, the field, nothing. 

By the time the sun had begun to set, I grew incredibly weary from my search, and took off to bed. I barely got a wink before I heard it, at the dead of night, snorting and stomping in my living room. 

“God…house…make you…how is it?...” The pig moaned. I grabbed my rifle and shot it in the back. It stood firm, turning around to match its black eyes with mine. I shot it again, twice in the head. 

It howled with pain and ran, I couldn't keep up as it ran into the woods, out of sight. I relaxed momentarily, lounging on my living room couch. 

I held my rifle toward the door, half asleep, waiting for the monster to return. My blood froze solid when I heard a familiar bellow echoing in my basement, a shrill shriek that rang through the wood of the old cabin. 

I bolted down the basement stairs to investigate, and reeled my head back in shock from the sudden stench. Several inches of red, frothy liquid pooled at the bottom of the stairs. 

Rising and bubbling from the creamy mixture of fetid cream and blood, arose the skeleton of the cow I had failed to kill. It howled at me. Despite having little body besides the half formed muscle that wrapped around its weak bones, it still screamed. 

I fired two shots at the animal in vain, missing and creating spurts of liquid in the pool. I winced and returned back upstairs, locking the basement door behind me. 

I then collapsed to the ground, panting and dripping sweat onto the dry wooden floor. “RAVEN!” I cried out. “REVERSE THIS CURSE! I BEG YOU!”

My own desperate yells could barely be heard over the bellowing of the monster below, whom I could hear slowly approaching. It dragged its heaving body up the stairs, the old wood of the cabin groaning in protest. 

“You wish to reverse this blessing I have given you?” The raven, who had appeared at my window, suddenly asked. “Why raven? Why has this happened to my animals?” I questioned angrily. 

The raven cackled. “Is it not obvious? You let them overpower you.” The raven answered. “You wished for their longevity, after all. Not yours. Surely you didn't think you would outlive them?” 

I gritted my teeth at the raven and pounded my fists at the floor. “REVERSE IT NOW!” I demanded. The raven ignored me, and flew away. The basement door flung open, the wretched screaming of the skeletal cow louder than ever. 

I panicked, scrambling to my feet and running for the door, down the field, to my truck. I slammed on the gas, recklessly careening down the road in the dark of the night. 

I drove and drove, and after minutes of speeding down the dirt path, I slammed on the brakes when I almost hit someone in my path. My pulse pounded in my head, standing in the headlights, mere feet in front of my truck, stood the pig. 

The bullet holes had sealed, leaving dry blood on the clothes he had stolen from me. He held something in his large, human hands. A road sign, a large metal rod with which he wielded like an axe. 

I fumbled the gear shift to reverse, but it was too late. The pig slammed the road sign down into my truck, again and again in rapid motion. The engine was destroyed. 

“Nothing…you are…you are…you have nothing.” The pig grumbled. It walked over to where I was sitting, and ripped the truck door off of its hinges. “How many…you are…you and me…” It said, inches from my face. I felt its hot breath. 

The next moment was a blur, he grabbed me, I kicked and struggled, he slammed me on the ground, I bit his arm, I tried to run, he pinned me to the ground. 

He raised the road sign above his head, and swung it down full force, taking off my left arm with a sickening crunch. I screamed as blood gurgled like a fountain out of the socket, soaking into the dusty road. 

I don't know how, or why, but after that moment the pig let me go. I looked up at his massive, intimidating frame as he glared down at me. 

It was at that moment, boring his soulless black eyes into my soul, that it spoke its first coherent sentence; “I'll be back for more.” 

I ran and ran desperately down the dark road. I ran until I felt my lungs would explode, before collapsing into the dirt from exhaustion. I lay on the ground panting, my hot saliva dripping out of my mouth. 

I lay there in fear and agony, unable to beat the pain from my left arm being severed. However, moments later, I realized that the twisted, unbearable pain from my left arm had begun to relax. 

Confused, I raised the remaining stump to my eyes, and widened my eyes in shock. My left arm was beginning to grow back.
