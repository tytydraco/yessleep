It started with a dream. Five months ago now. Feels more like five years, though, with all the shit that’s been happening. It was a night like any other: spaghetti and meatballs, story time with the wife and kid, then T.V. with the wife. Mundane, domestic, wholly unremarkable. If it weren’t for that damn dream.

At first, I thought I had woken up. My eyes snapped open, and I felt myself lying in my bed, staring out into a dark void above me. I gave my eyes a moment to adjust, rubbed at them to awaken as I teetered on the border of sleep. I had expected the vague outlines of the familiar forms of my room to take shape, but they did not. I squinted my eyes tight and peered into the darkness, but it would not relinquish such details to me. Alarmed, I sat up groggily and looked down at my bed.

Except, it wasn’t my bed. I sat on... well, whatever the hell was in front of, above, behind, all around me. Just void. I stood, whirling around in the black, desperate to find some anchor point to my reality. All around me, I was met with endless darkness. An inky infinity that stretched on as far as I could perceive. I stumbled as I careened through the strange space; I felt off balance. It was hard to get my bearings in a place where everything looked the same.

I could see no source of light. Yet, my clothing, my hands, legs, feet – all there, lit by a soft glow that emanated from some unknowable source. I did a double take and realized my clothing was amiss as well. I did not sport my typical bedtime t-shirt and briefs, but rather a dashing suit that fit me like a glove. I had just recently lost some weight, and I admired the way the fancy outfit flattered my form. I was interrupted by a loud CA-CHUNK that stirred me from my self-examination. I followed the sound with my gaze and saw in the distance a shaft of warm yellow light that shone down from a point of infinity high above. It illuminated a long, heavy-looking oaken table studded with deep character that was surrounded by chairs of similar make.

I stumbled towards the solemn scene. At this point, I was sure that I was dreaming. I had lucid dreams from time to time, familiar with their concept from a past passing interest. I tried what lucid dreamers call “reality testing” as I continued my march. I looked down at my left arm, checking for the ragged old scar that marked my first attempt to leave this world so many years ago. Gone. Other arm? Gone too. Yep, I was definitely dreaming. Definitely the most “real”-feeling lucid dream I had up to this point. They only got even more real from there.

I was close enough to the table now to recognize an old rotary phone that sat upon its storied surface. A small paper card lay propped up on the phone’s base with the words:

For service, please dial 607-7891

I picked up the note and scoffed under my breath. I looked around, a smile cracking my lips. I was beginning to appreciate the absurdity of the dream. I shook my head and laughed at the void surrounding my island of light. “Okay. What the fuck is this? Service? Alright, I’ll humor you.”

Nothing answered back from beyond the borders of my refuge. I waited a few more moments, in case they took their time in ponderance, but still nothing. Satisfied, I picked up the phone and dialed the number.

Ring. 

Ring. 

Ring. 

Ring. 

Ring.

 And then someone picked up. “Hello sir, how may I help you?” 

“Uhmm, I - uh, I’d like to be served.” 

“Very well sir, pleased to be of service.” The line clicked off. I chuckled internally as I wondered in what way I was about to be attended to. My curiosity was piqued further as I heard what sounded like the rapid tapping of feet approaching from the distance. At first, I had to strain my ears to hear it, unsure if it was real. But then, the soft patter grew into a rattling crescendo. Whatever it was, as it grew closer I realized - it was fucking big.

I braced myself for “service” by some void-born behemoth, imagining Lovecraftian horrors of incomprehensible form lurching from the darkness to peel and probe at my body for their unfathomable purposes. I cringed back behind the table on the opposite side of where the sound came from, cowering behind a stolid chair-back, peering through slats. Then, even as the sound climaxed to a rumble that felt like it could break me in two, it stopped.

My eyes had been glued shut in terror. I peeled them open, chancing a glance at whatever this strange dream had offered up to me. I inched my head over the table and felt sweat bead on my brow. There before me stood Shrek.

I burst out laughing. “Shrek? What the fuck, Shrek, what service can you offer me?” The massive green ogre smiled, the bulk of his form towering over me from across the table. 

“I want you to eat me.” 

The green cones of his ears twitched in what almost seemed like pleasure as the words came out. His eyelids fluttered, and his smile had a satisfaction to it, like he had just finally gotten some great burden of admission off his chest. 

“I’m sorry, what?” I sputtered an incredulous laugh. 

“I want you to eat me!” This time the force of the words nearly blew me off my feet. They were said with a conviction I don’t think I had heard up to that point, nor since. Shrek pointed at the respective “you” and “me” he referred to in order to clear up any confusion. Again, it seemed the conveyance of those words painted ecstasy across his visage, an almost sexual release that melted the tension away from the corners of his tired eyes. I looked the green son of a bitch up and down and shook my head, laughing again. “No, I am not going to eat you. I may be an omnivore, but not in the true sense of the word. You understand?”

Shrek frowned. He seemed honestly devastated by the words, not even insulted, just absolutely dejected. Imagine if someone told you every person you love had just died at the same time. THAT is how Shrek looked. Tears welled in the green monster’s eyes and he fell to his knees with a rumbling crash, where he began to beg. “Please sir, please! I want you to eat me! Please! Besides, I’m all spaghetti and meatballs on the inside! Here - let me show you!”

Shrek unsheathed a long-bladed katana that had been slung across his back, his hulking form previously obscuring it from my view. I reached out towards him in protest, but the table between us cloyed my attempt to stop him. The bastard took the sword and impaled himself without hesitation, the cold steel driving effortlessly into his bulbous stomach where it met his pelvis. He looked up at me, the fervent smile that painted his lips a mirror to his zeal. “Eat of me, please, I beg of you!”

With that plea, Shrek pulled the sword upwards in a sharp jerk, the still-impaled blade making a clean incision that spanned from pubis to sternum. I cried out in disgust, fear, and shock all at once as I watched the two halves of his bulbous belly peel away from each other, a verdant portal opening with sticky promise. Sure enough, a tsunami of saucy spaghetti and steamy meatballs slid smoothly from the open wound, spilling onto the floor between us, forming a mound that slowly spread out as it pancaked from its own weight. 

“Pleaaaaseeeee!” The deflating form begged and pleaded as it crumpled in on itself, the spaghetti seemingly endless as it flooded underneath the table, a tide of crimson sauce marking the chair legs where noodles lapped against them. It just kept going and going, forming a veritable sea of spaghetti and meatballs whose waves danced to the lamenting appeals of their progenitor.

In my shock, I had only stood and watched. It was horrifying and hilarious all at the same time; the absurdity tickled at my funny bone, but the realness of the bizarre scene was deeply disturbing. The smell of butter, tomatoes, and garlic swirled in the air, and my ankles were now wet with a tangle of grasping noodles that had overtaken them. As I regained composure, I tried to back away, but the tangle of noodles held me firm, and I fell over into the stuff. I splashed into the mess and was alarmed to find there was seemingly no bottom. I sank.

Deeper. Deeper. Noodles and sauce tried to fill my nostrils and mouth as I coughed and spluttered, trying to find some purchase. But there was none to be found. I felt myself sinking further, my lungs filling with chunks of saucy meatballs and bits of spaghetti. They burned from the red sauce’s acidity, and my head seemed to split with pain as I struggled to oxygenate my blood. My own gurgling shout mixed with the wet sloshing of noodles and the muffled plea that repeated still, now so far above me. Then, blackness.

I had awoken at 5 AM. **Goddamnit**. I had wanted to sleep in, it being a Saturday morning. But I knew once I was up, I would not be able to return to sleep. I was relieved to see the familiar outlines of my furniture lit by slivers of light from a peaking sun. I sat up and looked over at my wife. Still asleep. I took care getting out of bed not to wake her. At least she’d get to sleep in.

I shivered in the cool morning air as I stumbled to the bathroom. I rolled my tongue over in my mouth, noticing a strange taste. It smacked of acid, nightshade, herbs, and starches. I felt the lapping of bile against the sphincter of my throat and rushed to the toilet. I vomited profusely, a torrent of spaghetti and meatballs. I tried to expel it as silently as I could so as not to wake my wife. I stared down at my unsavory makings, rivulets of spittle and food clinging to my wiry beard. There, in the ivory bowl of our toilet – still unaccountably whole, apparently undigested, and a far greater amount than I had eaten for dinner the night prior – a heaping pile of spaghetti and meatballs. It was an impossibly large amount. It filled the bowl to the rim, overtaking the waters they swam in and forming an island of fetid Italian Cuisine.

I spent the next fifteen minutes working to flush my shame, to hide it away from those closest to me. I could hear the children stir downstairs, waking from their rooms to begin their morning Saturday routine of using the bathroom, getting a snack, and putting on cartoons. It was only moments before the rattling of the bathroom doorknob and my wife’s entrance that I had finished concealing my ignominy; she strode in as I washed my beard in the sink. 

“What are you doing, honey?” Her voice was still laden with the tenor of sleep. 

“Ah nothing dear, just got some toothpaste in my beard from brushing, washing it out.” 

“But - I didn’t hear your toothbrush running?” 

I shrugged and offered an apologetic look. “The damn battery is dead again, check it.” I feigned pressing the button to show that the vibrating motor would not engage. 

“Alright, well, thanks for letting me sleep in.” She leaned in close to give me a kiss; I obliged her and reciprocated. 

“No problem, babe. I’ll be down in a few.”

That day was as normal as any other: a quiet, slow morning followed by taking our older boy to his soccer game. I tried to act my normal self, tried to socialize with the other parents at soccer, tried to be warm and loving to my wife. But something had changed in me. The dream dominated my thoughts in truth. Even as I chatted with the assistant coach at soccer, I was really dialing a number on a rotary phone in my mind. Even as my son scored his second goal of the day, I was quaking in fear behind an oaken chair as something large and terrible rushed towards me from the void. Even as my wife put her hand in mine and offered me a warm loving smile as we drove our boys home, I was drowning, sinking deep into a pile of endless spaghetti and meatballs.

And below all of that: a hunger. A smoldering desire that burned quiet but consistent. I wanted more. I felt myself yearning for sleep. Yearning to go back to that lucid dream once more. I secretly hungered for more of Shrek, and I would soon get exactly what I desired.
