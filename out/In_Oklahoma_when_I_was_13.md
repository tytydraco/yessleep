This is always a fun story to tell. I havent told it in a while, but its a personal encounter so it I can honestly say this all happened. I am 32 now, and I dont know what to think about it. Truthfully, I try not to think about it too much. Anytime I do, I end up sleepling with the light on.

I was hitting the age where I didnt want to hang out with my family anymore. Family trips to the grocery store and Walmart were boring to me. Even with the promise of a movie before and a restraunt meal after couldnt get me to leave the house. Nothing could compare to having the whole home to myself.

   My parents were understanding about this, and surprisingly, the didnt mind me going my own way. My dad would even go out of his way to rent me a random video game if they were going out of state.

   I was king when they were gone. I would use my allowence to get snacks and set up my console in the living room on the big screen. Fun times.

   It started in the middle of the school year. I was in middle school, 7th or 8th grade. I dont remember which. I just remember jolting awake in the middle of the night. Looked around my room, saw the clock. 3:00am. I am not a morning person, I sleep hard. It was annoying and unusual to be this awake this early. I turned over and tried to go back to sleep. The next night, I woke up again. When I looked at the clock and saw it was exactly 3:00am again and it bothered me a little. This had never happened before, and to have it happen two nights in a row was making me nervous.

   I am a Kickapoo Tribal member and we have stories about shit in the night. My head immedietly jumped to the worst ones and I certainly didnt want any part of that. The reasonable part of my mind was telling me its probably a normal thing. Just move the curtains and look out the window, nothing is gonna be there, its irrational fear. The night just a time of day when the sun isnt up. Lack of light doesnt mean anything, even if its 3am. I will be honest, never once did I give into that idea. I live in the country of Oklahoma next to the woods. My curtains and blinds were closed at night always. 

   This would continue on and off for a few weeks. Always exactly 3am. Always a sudden jolt, never a slow stir. I began to lose my fear of it. It was becoming normal to point of annoyance. Then came the time were my mon needed to go and help some tribal members in mexico with traditional work. It was going to be a 3 day trip. 1 day to get down there, 1 day to help, and one day driving back. There was gonna be lots of family and all my sisters wanted to go. As you can imagine, not my scene. I asked to stay home, rented a video game, and said my good byes. Hugs, kisses and I was home alone. 

   Oven pizza, and gaming started the night. I was chilling on the couch, it was around 9pm. Doors were locked, my aunt was just down the road if I needed anything. My youngest sister was still on a tricycle kick so there was this purple tricycle with ribbons on the handles and unicorn stickers always in the way somewhere. Today, it was behind me where the kitchen meets the living room. I am gaming, volume is up to take advantage of the lack of sleeping people.

   Suddenly I hear it. Its a giggle. Like a little kid laughing. It was so real, I thought my little sister was home for a sec. I turned around a gave a quick glance, but nothing was there. I pause the game. I was so sure I heard it, but all was quiet. I got annoyed with myself. Clearly it was a sound in the game I was playing. My brain just had an audio hullicination from some of the background music or sound effects. I unpause the game and go about my night. About 15 or so minutes later, I hear it again. This time I was sure it came from behind me. A giggle. A little girls. I paused and muted the TV. It had come from the direction of the tricycle. (Slightly to the right and back of were I was sitting.)

   My heart was pounding. I wasnt sure of what to do. I kept looking at the bike expecting something to happen. Not taking my eyes of it, I walked over to the wall and turned on the light. I had the whole house dark for gaming. When nothing happend and my heart calmed down, I braved my way into the kitchen and started flipping light switches. I looked around for anything that could put me at ease. Something that couldve made that noise. There was nothing. I slept with the light on.

   The next day I had moved on, it was daylight and I was beginning to suspect it was my mind playing tricks on me. I watched movies and gamed all day. I had chips and dip for dinner and it came back around 9pm. Same scenerio, but it was while I was marathoning starwars. I didnt want to be scared and I couldnt really do anything about it so I would give it a glance and then ignore it. The 3rd time it happend I even mustered enough courage to yell at it. “Shut Up!” I said. Still pretty proud of that, but in hindsight, I probably shouldnt have engaged whatever it was. 

   The 3rd day was the worst. My family was driving back, they had already called. It was maybe noon. I forget, it was broad daylight though. I dont even remember what I was doing, but I heard the backdoor slam shut. I have cousins who live on the same street. It wasnt unusaul for them to just walk in, but it was rare enough to warrant suspicion. I peeked towards the kitchen expecting to see somebody walk around the wall. Its literally like 5 steps to the back door. After a few seconds I realized it wasnt any of my cousins. The floor creaks when people walk in the kitchen, and there was no creaking. I heard my parents door shut. Not slam, but shut. Thats when I really panicked. I grabbed the phone and dialed my dad. I dont know why, but I didnt know what else to do. Luckily he picked up after the first ring. I told him somebody was in the house and that I was scared. He got mad immediately and told me to go see who it was. Honestly his anger was exactly what I needed, it brought me back down to earth. He stayed on the line while I grabbed a knife from the kitchen drawer. I walked around the kitchen, then the back door and then my parents room. I didnt want to sound crazy so I explained the noise away to my dad, but he still told me where the keys where to the gun safe. I pullled my rifle out and stashed it in my room. Just in case. 

  My family came home that night and things went back to normal. My version of normal. The 3am nights started back up. Then they started getting worse. I wasnt just waking up anymore. I would become conscious, but would be paralyzed. Someone would be sitting on me with their knees on my chest. I wouldnt be able to breath or open my eyes. I could move my fingers and toes, but that was it. I would struggle and just when I was about to run out of breathe I would be freed and jolt upright for air. Always at exactly 3am. I dont remember how long this went on before I broke. Not long, maybe a week?

    I only saw it one time. The last time it happened. I was paralyzed and stuggling, my head wasnt upright this time. It was resting on my pillow to the left, with my eyes facing my bedside. I dont know why, but I was bound and determined to open my eyes during the struggle. It was like trying to lift a barbell with my lashes. My toes wiggled and I tried raising my body, but my limbs were so tired. Finally with significant effort, I could feel my eyelids raising slightly. I could make out my shelf, and a little bit of my window. Everything was so dark. Then I realized I was looking at it. It wasnt just dark, it was the dark. Like a solid shape made from black. My eyelids were still mostly closed so I couldnt see it very well but it was right next to me. We made eye contact. Its eyes were red. Like 2 little beads of red in the dark. The moment we made eye contact it shocked me. Like I had grabbed an electric fence. My body vibrated painfully. My eyes closed again, and a few seconds later I was released. It was 2:59am. Was pretty disturbed by that. Didnt want to go back to sleep until early dawn.

   That morning I told my dad. I told him everything, balled my eyes out. He tood me to stop crying and got mad I didnt tell him sooner. We went to my grand parents house down the road and my grand father and him had a ceremony. They made me a medicine pouch. When it was done, my dad gave it to me amd told me to never lose it. Always keep it in my home. It all stopped after that. No more 3 am wake ups, no door slamming , no paralyzing. I havent heard or seen anything since. I think back on it now, wondering how much of it was real. I can explain away the paralsis and the 3am stuff. But then I remember the doors and the giggles. I wasnt an over imaginative 5 year old. I was 13, basically a young man. It happened and I dont know what to think about it. 

   I wonder what would happen if I were to lose my medicine pouch. My grandfather has passed since then, I dont know if I could get another one. Would it come back? I have no intention of finding out, though I almost did once. I had pulled out the pouch for a show and tell with some friends while trying to get laid. I didnt put it back in my drawer. A few weeks later I had to turn my apartment inside out looking for it because I was about to move. I learned Its not a interesting toy to show off, its my protection. Never again. If you guys have any similar stories I would love to hear it. Maybe somebody knows what it was. I have a few ideas myself, but like I said, I try not to think on it too often.
