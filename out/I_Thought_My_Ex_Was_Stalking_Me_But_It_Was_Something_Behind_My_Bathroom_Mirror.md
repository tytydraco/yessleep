Nobody believed what I’m about to tell you until it was nearly too late. Even now, as I’m typing this I don’t think I’m safe. What happened to me could happen to anyone, and you’ll understand once you know the whole story.


Everything started when I moved into that apartment. It wasn’t much, but it had seen better days that’s for sure.

Aged paint, carpet stains of unknown origin, and the occasional centipede darting across the kitchen floor were just some of the issues with the place. 

The landlord said it was primarily “quiet” and he wasn’t wrong. The neighbors kept to themselves, except Mordecai in 2B. He could stretch “nice weather we’re having” into a 30 minute conversation. But it was home nonetheless for Piper and me.

She’s my best friend. Half shepherd, all shadow, and the only other heartbeat in my life.

After grad school, every day was a test to see if I was able to stretch what little was left of my savings. We moved in with nothing but a mattress, a dying coffeemaker, and a box of miscellaneous stuff from my days in college.

It was a fresh start, and the only distraction I had was hunting for employment. I stayed inside and chewed pen caps, all the while telling myself that I was saving money living on canned soup and rejection emails. But as boring as this was, it was safer this way.

After my last boyfriend… well, let’s just say I’ve had enough of men for a while.

He used to send me messages. Not the kind that would make your heart flutter, but the kind that made it stop. I try not to think too much about it these days.


For the first week, everything felt almost normal. I was just slowly starting to piece together my post-graduation life.

Until the notes started appearing.

At first, I thought I’d written them and had forgotten. A sticky note on my pillow, curled at the edge like it had been there a while read:

“Don’t cry like that. It doesn’t sound like you. Try again.”

I found another that was tucked into my sock drawer:

“Tonight, wear the blue shirt. The one that makes you softer.”

Then came the Polaroids.

They were photos of me brushing my teeth, cooking breakfast, sleeping. Each one was perfectly framed, timestamped, and impossibly candid.

The grain was heavy. The colors sickly and yellowed. They smelled faintly of mold and old chemicals like they’d been developed in some damp basement darkroom.

When I held one, Piper growled until it faded into a whimper. It was a sound that I’d never heard from her before. She pawed at the photo like it carried something foul.

Still, I tried to ignore it. Told myself someone was playing a sick joke.

Until the notes got more… personal.

“You look beautiful when you cry.”

“Stop wearing your hair up. I like it down.”

“You’re getting better at saying the lines.”

The lines? What lines?


I started to wonder if it was my ex after all. He knew how much I loved that blue shirt, the way I cried when I was truly overwhelmed. The kind of crying you didn’t want anyone to know about.

He used to always accuse me of “putting on a show” when I displayed my emotions like I used to. I couldn’t help but shake the feeling that the notes I had found would be something he would say.

I checked the restraining order again that night. It was still active, yet useless.

I was so weirded out by these events that I brought everything to the landlord. I told him someone had been inside my apartment.

He asked if I had locked the door. When I said yes, he shrugged as if I was wasting his time. 

“You’re probably just nervous being in a new place. The brain can be fickle and make things up when under a lot of stress.”

When I went to the police, somehow, they were even worse. They suggested that it was all a prank, a neighbor with a bad sense of humor, or a secret admirer.

Even when I mentioned my ex, even when I begged them to investigate it, they said there wasn’t enough evidence to pursue such action.

Their advice?

“If you feel unsafe, maybe move to a different part of town.”

I couldn’t. I had no choice but to go home. I thought about calling my sister. Or even my friend Jade — we fell out of touch last year, but she would pick up if I called.

What would I say though? “Hey, someone’s leaving me notes that sound like my ex, and sending me Polaroids of myself sleeping — can I crash on your couch?”

I had already leaned too hard on people during grad school. With no money left to my name to break my lease, this was my burden to carry.

Besides… what if I brought him with me?

I told myself I’d be more careful…


The next morning, I found a note stuck to the bathroom mirror:

“Snitches don’t make good wives.”

They knew, but how? How did they know I had gone to the police?

After that, I noticed something strange about the mirror. Sometimes, even hours after my shower, it would be foggy, like someone had leaned in close and breathed on it.

Worse was the odor that would creep out from the walls. It was a cloying, acrid tang that carried through the air that smelled like vinegar.

Then came the sounds when I would lay in bed at night.

Click.

Days later, a hairline crack appeared in the lower left corner of the bathroom mirror. It wasn’t a clean break, it was as if something behind it were trying to break free.

I pressed my phone’s flashlight against it and saw not insulation or drywall... but a hollow void. I saw nothing but black, empty space beyond the glass.

Shortly after this, that’s when I began receiving the gifts.

A charm bracelet I lost in middle school, a pack of discontinued gum I used to love, and then, most disturbingly, a snow globe that I was sure had been lost in my grandmother’s house fire many years ago.

These weren’t just keepsakes, they were memories. Whoever this was ...they weren’t just watching me, they knew me.


I started recording voice memos to try and wrap my head around things. I talked to myself and journaled the day’s events, and for a while it helped.

Until one day, I played one back and heard a two-minute clip I didn’t remember recording.

Soft breathing came first and then a sigh. Coughs became sobs before they were cut off by a man’s voice.

“No, no... not like that. You say, ‘I’m scared’ like this.”

Then the sound of my own trembling voice:

“I’m…scared.”

The man’s voice returned in a harsh whisper.

“I just want you to love me back.”

I felt sick to my stomach at the revelation that there was now a voice to the weird occurrences inside my apartment. Piper whimpered and hid under the couch, refusing to come out for hours. I ended up sleeping with a hammer beside my bed that night.


It all came to a head sometime around 1 AM. I was sitting in the dark hugging my knees, my heart racing as I listened to the clicking of the radiator.

Then came a long grating drag, like metal being pulled across stone. Something was rasping along the drywall in the bathroom.

Tap.

I grabbed the hammer by my bed and crept to the bathroom silently. Piper scratched at the door as I shut it behind me. 

“Good girl,” I whispered through the crack underneath.

I stood in front of the mirror as the silence engulfed the apartment. The noises had stopped completely.

I breathed a sigh of relief but as I went to leave, a pale finger slid forward through the crack in the glass. I gasped in horror as I watched it twitch and retreat.

Weeks of paranoia snapped as I brought the hammer down again and again. The mirror exploded, glass raining down onto the tile.

Behind it was a crawlspace that was narrow, musty, and smelled of rotted earth, and crouched inside…he was there.

His pale skin shone with a wet sheen, slick with sweat like he’d been marinating in the dark. His knees were drawn up, camera dangling loosely around his neck. Dozens of photos covered the walls behind him, photos of me.

His cracked lips curled into a disgusting smile as he said with delight:

“You broke the stage. You weren’t supposed to break the stage.”

Then, mimicking my voice:

“Don’t you see? This was our favorite part.”

“You’ve been here this whole time?” I asked, my voice shaking with rage and disbelief.

He nodded slowly with wide, fearless eyes.

“It’s cozy in here. And you… you’re so easy to watch.”

I raised the hammer with trembling hands, doing my best to look intimidating.

“You need to leave.”

“Why would I leave? You’re my favorite thing.” He spoke with sinister infatuation.

I stumbled into the tunnel and swung blindly. He grabbed my wrist, his cold fingers wrapping around my skin like wire.

I kicked the man repeatedly and managed to free myself, allowing me to wriggle around the crawlspace.

The flash of his camera lit the tunnel and for a second, I saw all of it. The Polaroids pinned to the walls like trophies, the wires, the vents peering into every room.

I crawled faster; the grimy, stale moisture of the air tasted faintly of copper beneath my tongue.

“Say it, say you need me.” He hissed as he reached for my foot.

“No!” I spat back as I continued through the crawlspace, my heartbeat thudding in my ears.

“Wrong!” his voice broke in anger. “That’s not your line!”

I turned a corner, and then another. The tunnel forked. Left or right, I didn’t know. I darted forward towards the left tunnel, my chest burning as I tried to keep my breaths shallow.

He skittered in the darkness behind me, his laugh echoing in the tunnel. The laugh didn’t sound human — it sounded rehearsed.

And then, another burst of light from his camera. The flash forced my eyes to squeeze shut. My grip loosened on the hammer, and it fell from my grasp with a metallic clang.

I was disoriented, lost, unsure of where I was. When I regained my senses, I realized I had reached a dead-end.

He emerged slowly, camera up, that awful smile returning.

“There you are.” He breathed, and the stench hit me, like old batteries and bile. 

As he continued towards me, I desperately lunged for the hammer that was still within reach. He tried to stop me, but I brought it down with all my strength — it connected with a sickening crunch against his collarbone. He screamed in agony and stumbled back.

I quickly crawled past him and turned a corner, slamming my shoulder into the wall as I pivoted through the darkness. 

After frantically traversing the dark with scraped elbows and hands for what seemed like an eternity, I finally emerged out of the wall and found myself back in my bathroom. 

Piper barked wildly as I grabbed my phone and began dialing 911 with trembling fingers. I clutched the phone as it rang, and Piper and I fled to a neighbor’s apartment.

The police arrived not too long afterwards to investigate the scene. With their weapons drawn, they found the hole and the contents inside.

A makeshift bedroll, boxes of instant noodles, and hundreds of Polaroids were just some of the items found, but they didn’t find him.

They said they would continue to search and that he couldn’t have gone far, but I knew better. He had never been far; he had always been just inches away.

I moved three weeks later.

With the help of my friends and family, I was able to afford a new apartment. It took everything in me to ask. I thought I’d burned those bridges but they answered without hesitation.

The new apartment was bright and sterile with no stains on the floor or cracks in the mirror, only smooth surfaces and quiet hallways. The faint smell of white paint and new carpet made it feel like the kind of place where nothing bad had ever happened.

It felt like a reset button, like maybe here I could finally breathe for a change. Piper curled at my feet again, and I told myself that I was finally safe.

But last night…Piper growled.
