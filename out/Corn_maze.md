I’ll never forget my 13th birthday.

Dad had left us just two months earlier. Mum had screamed and cried, pleading with him to come back. My sister Layla had clung to the bottom leg of his trousers like a little kid. We sat in silence for about an hour, slowly realizing that we were never going to see him again. Mum used up all her eucalyptus-scented tissues.

Layla and I stayed up all night watching random TV shows on ABC Family. I can’t remember most of them, but one really stood out to me: Bunheads (a series that followed Gilmore Girls). We had found it while scrolling through our old, crappy remote that clinked and clunked with every press. It was a show about ballerinas. Layla had always dreamed of being a ballerina. She started in the summer of last year and worked her way up. I always imagined watching her in a beautiful Swan Lake dress, cheering her on as the audience erupted in applause. The show had just aired. We binge-watched as many episodes as we could.

I laid my head on the back of Layla’s collarbones. Her dirty-strawberry-blonde hair surrounded my face. I silently choked on tears left in the shock of everything that had just happened. She brushed my hair away from my forehead. I prayed it was all a dream, and then my eyelids gave way and my vision faded into black.

I awoke to the sound of a mourning dove. I looked around to see if it had all been a bad dream. I tilted my head back. I was on the fuzzy grey couch, and the TV was still playing. Some low-budget shows flickered on-screen, the kind that looked like they were filmed through steam. Probably rated MA. I tiptoed quietly through the house. It was 6:00. Mum was asleep, covered in tissues piled over her like mountains.

I decided to call Dad on the kitchen landline, again and again, until my fingers got tired of pressing the numbers. It always went to the message bank.

Mum was a wreck for the next few days. Layla helped her as much as she could. She was only fourteen, trying to care for her little sister—me. But I wasn’t her little sister anymore. I could do most things myself. Maybe it was because she’d lost the parents she thought she loved. She didn’t want to lose me too. I was a second part of her.

Weeks bled into each other. The days leading up to my birthday passed quicker, but I wasn’t looking forward to it anymore. Money grew tighter. Mum struggled to hold down jobs. I was becoming more angry, more bitter toward Dad.

The night before my birthday, I ran to a payphone after school. The word Telstra was slapped across its edge. I called him again. It still went to voicemail.

I thought about throwing the phone down and running home. But instead, I left a message. I still remember my exact words:

“Hi, Dad,” I said. My voice sounded like I’d been crying.

“I really miss you,” I forced out, choking on tears.

“Please come home.”

There was only the soft crackling of the line. No person could be that silent. I tilted my head back, trying to dry my tears in the hot summer breeze.

I waited ten seconds.

“Please. Please. Please,” I whispered.

I waited again. No one answered.

Anger built up inside me.

“Fuck you!” I shouted, slamming the phone back and grabbing my backpack. I ran through traffic in a fit of rage. As I paced home, I peered through the window. Layla was wrapping my presents in dollar-store polka dot paper. I turned away so I wouldn’t see the gift.

Going to sleep that night was harder than usual. And I know what you're going to say—“Everyone struggles to sleep before their birthday!” But no. There was a small sense of dread, lurking above me like a storm cloud. I brushed it off, thinking it was a me problem.

I was barely asleep when Layla jumped on her bed.

“Jenny! Jenny!” she said excitedly, shaking me awake.

She handed me the gift wrapped in polka dots with a bow made from hot pink tissue paper. It was a pair of real UGG boots. The price tag was still on them. I hugged her.

“You paid for these yourself?” I asked, staring at them in awe.

Mum came in with pancakes dripping in maple syrup. She told us we were going on a day trip to a corn maze. I had always wanted to go to one, to laugh with Layla while we figured our way through, trying not to trip over our own feet.

Layla grabbed her dusty old camcorder—the one we used to record summer holidays—brushed off the dust, and packed it in her bag.

We drove in Mum’s red Jeep. Cyndi Lauper blasted from the CD player. Mum fake-sped while Layla shook her headrest like she was at a concert. I stuck my head out the window like in those cheap 2000s Malibu movies.

After what felt like forever to a little kid, but no time at all to us, we reached a small town. The buildings looked untouched by time. Moss crawled up the bricks where mortar used to be. The whole town bustled, like there was never a moment without people.

Before the maze, we stopped at a little bakery. We got a cake topped with strawberries. It tasted like heaven. We had to stop ourselves from devouring it all.

“Ahh, here it is!” Mum said, pulling up to the corn maze. The corn was fresh and tall. A scarecrow stood nearby, dressed in hastily stitched 90s clothes. Mum pulled out her leather wallet and handed some cash to a man.

The host looked surprisingly normal—a middle-aged guy with grey around his temples. Mum paid him, and we entered the maze.

Layla turned on the camera and hung it around her neck. We walked in, screaming with laughter. I found a bit of hay and stuck it over my nose like a pig snout. Layla laughed hysterically. We bumped into each other. Mum told us she was going a different way.

“Mum! That’s how everyone dies in horror movies!” I laughed.

I turned around to find her, but she was already gone.

Layla talked about all the big-sister things: dating, boys, fashion. I smiled, grateful not to be at school.

But as we walked, the silence grew louder, until there was nothing left.

“Layla,” I said, a little uneasy.

“Yeah?” she replied, sounding unfazed.

“Shouldn’t Mum be back by now?”

She didn’t answer at first. She tucked her hair behind her ear and listened for footsteps.

There were none. Just silence. The sounds of the town were gone.

Layla broke the quiet. “Mum!” she called out.

“Yeah?” came the reply. A familiar voice from… somewhere.

We both sighed in relief. I didn’t want to lose Mum on my birthday.

“Where are you?” Layla asked.

“Over here!” the voice called back. We laughed. Mum was always like that.

“No, I’m over here!” the voice added again.

My heart did a somersault. That voice—it didn’t sound quite right. It had the same pitch, the same call. But it lacked warmth. Layla and I looked at each other. She heard it too. The voice wasn’t coming from a single place. It echoed from different directions.

Footsteps approached. They sounded wrong.

I grabbed Layla’s hand.

“Oh, Jenniveve. You’ve always been so silly! I’m right here!”

Instinct kicked in. That wasn’t our mum. She had never called me Jenniveve. That was Dad’s name for me.

“No, Lydia, we’re not calling her just Jenny, and that’s final.”

A name soaked in shame, not even spelled right.

I was already running. Layla screamed. Whatever that was, it wasn’t our mum. It was a mimic.

We ran toward the entrance, not daring to look back. We found the real Mum near the center of the maze.

“We need to get out of here!” I panted.

“Why? What’s going on?” she asked. Her real voice calmed me instantly.

“I just want to go,” I said.

“This place is weird,” Layla added.

We began walking. Layla’s camera was still recording.

“Wasn’t the entrance here?” I asked, panic creeping into my voice.

We walked more. Finally, we saw it. We sighed in relief.

But standing there was the man who ran the maze.

He looked... wrong. Like someone pretending to be human and missing something. His features were off. His pupils reflected no light. Layla shifted the camera toward him.

Later, when we drove back, Layla pointed the camera at the townspeople. They smiled—but not happily. Something in their smiles made every bone in my body go cold.

“Well, that was an interesting trip, wasn’t it?” Mum said.

We nodded silently.

“Didn’t you think that guy was a bit strange?” I asked.

“All guys are a bit strange,” Mum replied.

When we got home, Mum tried to cheer me up with chewy candies and lolly snakes. We curled up on the couch to watch Friends, Mamma Mia, and The Princess Bride.

Mum said it was time for bed. I had school tomorrow. But Layla insisted we watch the footage.

We watched the video. It was cute at first. But when “Mum” returned in the maze, Layla paused it.

“Wait… who are you talking to?” Mum asked, her voice suddenly flat.

Me and Layla laughed, thinking it was a joke. But she looked serious.

“Wasn’t that just you playing around?” I asked.

“No… No,” she said.

“Then WHO was it?” Layla whispered.

We played it back.

“No one can sound that similar,” Layla said, swallowing hard.

I fast-forwarded to the man. Zoomed in on his eyes.

Black sockets. No light.

We sat in silence.

Even Mum, the skeptic, looked scared.

“I was going to leave a bad review,” she muttered, knocking her new Sarah Dessen book off the table. “What was that town called?”

“Non-Est-Verum Lane.”

We couldn’t find it. Not on maps. Not in reviews. Not even in the darkest corners of the internet.

We stayed up watching Gavin And Stacey  to take our minds off it. Layla opened the mailbox and found five presents inside. Mum tried to explain it away with some bad theory like the internet hadn’t found that place yet.

But I don’t know what that town was.

We even tried driving back. We took every root we could think of.

 I’ll never forget my 13th birthday.
