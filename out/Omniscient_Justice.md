I remember the day I met Michael Cronwell. I couldn’t forget that name since I killed his sister.

I was awoken late by the droning of my phone’s ringtone. As I rose, I noticed it was accompanied by the rain masking the sound of the decrepit city. When I answered my phone, I was met with the chief of police: “Hey, I’m sorry to call so late, but could you come down to the station? It won’t take too long, but we need a psych eval on paper.” I can’t believe they would let a man so pitiful and naive have so much power. The sorry sap lost his wife last month. You can hear it in his voice. He still hasn’t recovered.

“You know I’m out of my working hours. Can you not call someone else?” I replied begrudgingly.

“I understand, but you’re the closest, and he said he knows you,” he replied, determined. I’ll give credit where it’s due — he’s nothing like his wife. He would put up a fight. Even though I can’t stand this conversation anymore, I had to know.

“Who is he?”

The chief sighed. “Michael Cronwell.”

On the way to the station, the rain seemed to grow heavier and louder the closer I got.

“It’s getting quite bad out there. Looks like another storm.”

The taxi driver ruined the silence with his pointless observation. I could only reply with a grunt to get that sweet serenade back on track. He got the message. I got out the car. The police station looked like an out-of-tune TV with the heavy rain. I approached the door and shut out the weather. The sound of the storm was snuffed on the crossing of the threshold. I’m in the eye of the storm, and I’m being watched.

I smile and scanned all the officers and victims surrounding me. Walking past all the terrified parents and husbands brought me a sense of accomplishment. I always knew I could be something great. Missing kids, missing wives — all of this is up to me, and they will soon know how important I am.

I approached the desk hosting the newly trained receptionist. Her fiery red hair and her dark, burnt eyes calling to me. She’ll be next. Slut.

“I—”

Then she fucking cut me off.

“I know who you are. The chief is waiting for you. I’ll call him down.”

Of course she does. I am the best psychologist in the world. After too long of smiling and pleasantries, the chief arrived and called me to the surveillance room for a debrief.

“It was nice to meet you,” she called.

I know.

As we arrived, it was instant — the irrational babbling of a madman.

“I don’t need to go in there to tell you he’s mad.”

I can’t believe they brought me in for this. The chief sat down and told me to join him. He explained how Michael had bludgeoned a man to death at the local mall and then waited to get arrested, laying on the ground mumbling to himself when officers arrived. He then proceeded to tell me the man was a sex trafficker — but he didn’t have to. I knew the man well.

Apparently, Michael had evidence of his crimes on his person, and they perfectly fit into their ongoing case. I stared at the chief, waiting for his next word, but it never came. So I shifted my gaze to the monitor. My eyes were tainted with the sight of a frizzy-haired, balding, middle-aged white man — his snaggle-tooth mouth still rambling to the camera, beckoning me in.

“I think it’s time I met this Mick Cro—”

“Michael Cronwell.”

Cunt.

As I approached the interview room and the doors opened, his stammering stopped, and his stature shifted. I was no longer burdened by the sight of a middle-aged man dressed in rags, but blessed with the sight of a well-dressed man I presumed was mid-20s. No longer was his hair wired and a mess, but sleek and styled. His eyes still carried the madness — but not of delusion, of wrath. He smiled at me and gestured to the seat across from him.
