Where do I even start with this? Everything I am about to tell you is one hundred percent non-fiction, even though I so desperately want it not to be true. A dream. A figment of my imagination, if you will. I’m going to put my cards down on the table and fully admit that right now, I’m more frightened, cold, isolated and alone than I’ve ever been before and it’s all because I made the trip across the pond and ended up in this almost unheard of town in the arse end of the American midwest. Ohio, to be specific. A town by the name of Whitehawk Springs. A remote city nestled within the heart of the state. Not a big town whatsoever. A population of around 36,000 maybe? Those figures might not be entirely accurate, but you get the point. 



For a bit of context, I grew up in a relatively socially depraved area of South London. My mother died when I was around six and not long after is when my father walked out on me. Since then being raised by my Aunt. I love that woman to death and want more than anything in the world to be with her again right now. Over the years, let’s just say, I’ve had my fair share of “issues”.



It’s no secret that growing up working class in the inner city is a very “dog eat dog” kind of life where you have to toughen up and be ready to defend yourself to avoid being mauled to death (usually by pimps or loan sharks if not literal feral Kaynines). So when the opportunity to take a temporary escape from this life came along, I was more than on board.  



It started in college with the student exchange program. Designed to give disenfranchised young people from broken homes the opportunity to broaden their horizons. As in, a troubled kid from somewhere overseas gets to experience life here and someone like me would fly half way around the world to end up working on a farm somewhere, at least that’s what I assumed at the time. I’d just turned eighteen years old and what I wanted more than anything was to be able to decompress and live my life, just for a bit, instead of looking over my shoulder 24/7. 



So that’s exactly what I did. I woke up at around 5 in the morning, said my goodbyes to my aunt and set off to spend some time overseas for around 4 weeks or so. I travelled to the airport with around six other students who were also taking part in the program. Our college instructor, Tracey, gave us all words of encouragement “I went to America when I was your age and had the time of my life, but be prepared, even though we speak a common language, Americans are about as foreign as the Russians”.  At this point, I knew very little about the United States in general, let alone Ohio. All I had to base my expectations off of was the vast catalog of American movies and TV I grew up watching. You know, the typical slices of Americana that are constantly drip-fed all across the globe through popular culture. The white pickett fences, the freshly cut lawns and the endless stretch of roads and houses that seem to go on for miles. Suburbia. The American dream. Quite a different reality to life in South London. 



I ended up flying for around 9 hours on a British airways flight non-stop to Chicago international. I arrived at around 7:45 in the morning, jetlagged and exhausted. It wasn’t the worst journey I’d ever experienced (not that I had that much experience anyway) . The dude I was seated next to on the plane, who was also part of the program I learned was called Jason. We quickly started chatting and became friends. Jason had also grown up in South London and was here for the exact same reason as me. I think most of the students here had the same mindset. 

After leaving the airport, we boarded a coach and drove for around 5 and a half hours before finally arriving in Whitehawk Springs. From the very first time I laid my eyes upon the sign-post for the town’s entrance, a part of me wondered what I’d gotten myself into. “A very warm welcome to the settlement of Whitehawk Springs, Home of the Whitehawk Corporation” 

When I signed on to this trip, I had no idea that Whitehawk was a company town, not that I even really knew what a company town was, being from another country and all. The whole concept was rather alien to me at least. Another thing that caught me off guard was the amount of American flags literally everywhere, as well as the amount of religious paraphernalia that littered almost every front yard. On the whole, I knew Americans were generally more religious than the Brits but to this extent, I wasn’t prepared for. 



Soon enough, I came to my stop and learned that Jason and I would be staying in the same home with the same family who were called the Ashbrooks. They consisted of Jerry and Darline Ashbrook and their two adult children. Henry and Joanna, ages 18 and 19 respectively. As soon as Jason and I started up the long, heavily tarmaced driveway, Jerry and Darline appeared to greet us. Darline, a petite woman with a bob-style haircut was the first to embrace us, each both in enormous bearhugs and donning a smile that was so aggressive, it might as well have been forced. The house was huge, and to someone who grew up in a British council house, it seemed like a mansion. A wooden porch snaked around the entirety of the house with a beige cushioned porch-chair to the left of the front door swaying lightly in the wind. Jerry smiled. He was a tall bloke, around 6,1. His hair greased back across his scalp with a single curled strand laying across the left side of his forehead. He wore a pair of thick black-rimmed coke-bottle glasses and a grey suit with a red tie neatly tucked underneath his jacket. Jerry shook both our hands and introduced himself, Henry and Joanna. As we went inside, we were shown to our room which we’d be sharing, a spacious room at the back of the house with two single beds, both of which had nicely wrapped picnic baskets full of various snacks and baked goods, much to our delight. 



Dinner that night was also amazing. Turkey, mashed potato, cranberry sauce, mac and cheese, it was all there. Everything was incredible. It was everything the movies depicted. Almost too accurate. I remember Jason and I joking about it being like living in a real-life version of The Truman Show, and, to be honest, we weren’t far off in that regard.



The next day, we learned that we’d be spending our days, not in a traditional American high school or a community college but instead, all overseas students would be training as interns for the Whitehawk Corporation, this was a company town after all and Jerry, it turned out, was the deputy executive on the company board, Darline was a stay-at-home housewife of course, there to maintain the garden, clean the house and cook the evening meals consisting of a more than generous helping of carbs and red meat. So much for feminism. We learned that Henry and Joanna would be our guides since they were already employees at the company and had been for quite some time. We were given our uniforms, Navy blue overalls with our names stitched onto the left side of the chest and we were good to go. 



We got in the Ashbrook family car, a 1950s DeSoto custom station wagon and drove for around 25 minutes to the Whitehawk Company HQ. During the drive, I couldn’t help but notice the excessive array of numerous fast food establishments that lined the highway. I must’ve counted around fifteen at least. All with drivethroughs. Pavements, or “sidewalks” seemed completely absent. No room for walking here. In Whitehawk, the automobile was the primary choice of transportation. 



When we arrived at the Whitehawk Company HQ, We were greeted by a large herd of people in hard-hats and high-vis jackets all standing in a cluster by the front gate. A good number of them were wielding various signs on placards stapled to wooden posts. I couldn’t quite make-out what they said but they seemed to be shouting or rather chanting in unison. 



“Eh, god damn unions” Jerry muttered to himself as he navigated the vehicle at a steady pace around the block to avoid any kind of coalition with any of the people. We pulled up at the gates and were greeted by a security guard sitting in a booth. Jerry flashed his keycard and the barrier lifted letting us through to the parking lot.



 a mandatory introduction for all new trainees by the head of the company. Mr Alistair J Whitehawk was the first thing on the table as soon as we entered the building. Mr Whitehawk was a shorter bloke, possibly around 5’6 and had a short black, neatly groomed circular beard plastered firmly across his face. He wore a dark, blue velvet suit and a pair of brown loafers. The dress-style of a man with more than a bit of personal wealth. 



“Welcome, all these new faces” He declared, in his upper class American accent. I figured he probably went to Harvard or some other fancy college that someone like myself could only ever dream of being accepted into. 



“My name is Mr Alistair J Whitehawk, CEO and co-founder of the Whitehawk Corporation but I’m a nice guy, so you can all just call me Alistair or Ali for short” We walked as he spoke, around the enormous factory floor. He continued his speech. “The Whitehawk corporation formally known as Whitehawk Industries was founded all the way back in 1916 by my great great grandfather, Sir Winston Whitehawk and his son Harvey a.k.a my dear father” 

I looked around, behind the hard hats and overalls, I recognised a fair amount of people who I went to college back home with as well as a few people who probably just moved to the town for a job and were probably on their first day. 



“Since then, Whitehawk Industries specialised in providing the best and only the best nuclear power structures, not only in the midwest, but the best the whole United States has ever had within its borders. After my old man retired and handed the company over to yours truly, I’ve been determined to not only upgrade nuclear power as we know it, but transport humanity itself into the year 3000. 



As we walked, we followed Ali through a set of double doors and found ourselves on a long metal platform and underneath it looked to be what I would assume to be a large pool, like the ones you get at gyms or waterparks but this was way deeper, well over twenty-five metres. Eventually, my curiosity got the better of me and I decided to ask Jerry what it was for



“This is the cooling tower," Jerry said. He shifted and glanced over the barrier into the fluorescent blue water



“Every nuclear power plant has one, It’s where the reactor sits, right at the bottom, The water keeps the fuel rods at a reasonable temperature” 



“Why is it so blue?” I asked 



“Cherekov’s Radiation is what they call it, The glow of the reactor causes light to be emitted with large concentrations at a specific wavelength. When the rods come out of the reactor after several years they ain’t gonna stop pumping out that radiation, in fact, they ain’t gonna stop for another hundred years or so, that’s for sure. So we just put em in water to keep em at bay, Just got to hope the water cycle keeps changing otherwise that water is gonna boil and we don’t want any more accidents”



“Anymore?” I asked. “So there have been accidents here?”



Jerry bit his lip nervously



“Let’s just say we’ve had a few incidents over the years”



I looked at him. He already understood that I wanted him to elaborate



“Some poor bastard fell in once, when the water filter was broken. This whole pool was filled with nuclear waste, the folks here refer to it as the 97 incident” 



“Did the guy survive?” I asked sheepishly 



Jerry then gave me a look of anxiety that made me realise that whoever this bloke was, he didn’t get lucky in the end



“I wouldn’t worry about it too much fella” Jerry said as he tried his best at some form of reassurance. “Since then, our health and safety policy has come a long way. We have special procedures for when any of our team handles anything around the area. Plus, only qualified individuals are permitted to enter the platform.”



Well, that was good enough for me, I guess.



As the day went on, we were shown what our assignments would be. As an intern, my job would be on the first floor, operating the various types of machinery used to transport radioactive supplements. It wasn’t bad at first, the machines were fairly easy to get my head around, and the pay was more than generous. I became friendly with the other workers. I already knew Jason and it was nice to familiarise myself with my other peers. One of them I learned was named Marcus. He must’ve been in his mid 20s or so. He was a latino guy who’d been struggling to make ends meet over in California and had relocated to Whitehawk after being offered a job, I also learned that he wasn’t actually qualified to work in the states but Ali had taken a chance on him because quote “everyone deserves the opportunity to make something of themselves” He seemed nice enough though. A good laugh and fun to be around as well. Henry and Joanna Ashbrook were both pretty cool once I got to know them. Joanna was loud and feisty whilst Henry was quieter and softly spoken. We ended up becoming good friends, which I guess is what you need in a work environment like this. Another was a stocky, bald, middle-aged mustached bloke named Biff. Biff, who I recognised from the picket line, was the boss of the Whitehawk Company Union and an avid believer of worker’s rights. 



I first encountered Biff when the guys and I were slacking off in the staff lounge. We were having a contest of  how many butterfinger bites each of us could carry in our mouths at one time. Juvenile? Sure, but we were off shift and we were bored. The moment came when Henry spat a whole bite out so hard that it flew across the room and hit the far wall. We all lost our shit which is when I heard the voice from the hallway.



“Can you shitheads keep the noise down?” Biff stood in the doorway, a scowl plastered across his face. “I’m out there leading the picket lines every morning tryin to keep you and all the other schmucks here from dyin, maybe you could stop these games and lift your weight a lil bit” He turned and carried on down the hallway and out of sight.

“That’s Biff” Joanna said formally as she sat down and sipped a paper cup of coffee. “He’s nice, I promise”



“Eh, He’s alright” Henry said in response. 



After about a week, things seemed to be going okay. I spent my afternoons off shift wandering about the town and exploring the nooks and crannies of the place. Everything seemed more old school than back home, the stores didn’t use contactless payments, I had to carry cash around on me at all times and the endless sprawl of strip malls and houses seemed to be an almost cartoonishly stereotypical American daydream. Then things started to take a rocky turn, I found myself getting nauseous whilst on the factory floor, the vast amounts of overprocessed snacks from the local 7/11 probably didn’t help sure, but this was different, Even after a good night sleep and countless cups of coffee and energy drinks from the Vending machine, I still felt tired all the time, Almost nodding off on various occasions. I began to experience headaches, migraines, stomach pain and nausea. It got to the point where I felt I couldn’t function and needed a break. I needed to find Jason. I hadn’t seen him in a few days. Apparently he had voluntarily slept over at the plant these past few nights, a lot of workers in the industry do so as I’m told. To “keep everything in order at all costs”. 



As I entered the staff lounge, I saw Henry sitting on one of the couches with a pen and a sticky note enthusiastically scrawling something on it. When he saw me walk in, he looked up and stopped what he was doing. . He and I were the only ones in the room, I sat down across from him with my head in my palm



“You good man?” Henry asked

“Yeah, Well, no, I’m not actually sure. For the past couple of days, I’ve just been feeling sick all the time.



“Yeah, we get that a lot, It’s what happens when you work in a place like this. Being around this much radioactive material all day everyday gets to your insides”

 

“You mean I’m breathing in these toxic fumes and that’s what’s making me sick?” I asked



“You got that right” he answered 



“Well, can’t we wear masks or something to avoid things like this happening?”



Henry looked at the floor.



“We tried that multiple times, heck, that’s what Biff is here for, to make the demand for better working conditions but Ali made budget cuts to reduce company spending a while back and said all us worker folk needed to make sacrifices, whatever in hell that means”



I zoned out in disbelief. What kind of boss would do this to their own employees? Was he trying to kill all of us? How in the fuck was this even allowed in the first place? Maybe, it’s being a stuffy European and all but I’m pretty sure none of this would ever fly back home. Health and safety is all we ever talk about whereas here, it seemed to be seen as some kind of privilege.

  


Henry looked over at me and sighed. “Look, I ain’t gonna pretend that I know Ali too well, I only work for the guy but if you go to his office and explain the situation, He might just let you take the afternoon off, he’s understanding like that”



“Alright man, see you at home later I guess”



“Sure thing fella” Henry replied 



He patted me on the shoulder as I left the room and made my way to the elevator that would take me to the basement floor where Mr Whitehawk’s office was located. As I made my way to the elevator and pressed the button for the floor I wanted, I felt something stuck to my back, something loose and crumpled. As I reached back to feel what it was, I realised it was a small piece of paper or more specifically, a sticky note. It was the same one Henry had been writing on as I walked in the room. I plucked it from my back and held it in front of me. What it said made my blood run 

cold. Written hastily in biro pen were the words: LEAVE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD LEAVE, WHILST YOU’RE STILL ABLE TO WITH YOUR LIFE.
