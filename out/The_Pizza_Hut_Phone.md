**Part 1**

 

I still dream about my grandmother’s old house. These dreams aren’t particularly scary, but the longer I dwell on them, the more unsettling they become. Despite my childhood fear of that house, the dreams carry an eerie calm that disturbs me most. The rooms
 are empty—no furniture, no pictures on the walls, no view beyond the windows, no color, no sound, just a thick fog blanketing everything. In these dreams, I wander aimlessly for what feels like hours, always ending up in the upstairs hallway. As the dream
 unfolds, the lights grow brighter and brighter, making it harder to see where I’m going. At the peak, just as the light threatens to blind me, I hear it: a ringing sound. A phone ringing. Then I wake up. 

 

This is a stark contrast to how the house felt when my grandmother lived there. It was a typical old lady home: dozens of family photographs adorned the walls, antique furniture filled the rooms for family gatherings, and garish 1940s wallpaper—often clashing
 between rooms—covered every wall. During the day, the house bustled with life. My grandparents entertained guests, and extended family always stopped by to visit. It reminded me of an antique store, brimming with knickknacks and vintage treasures. A deteriorating
 mirror hung above the fireplace, an oversized piano nobody could play sat in the living room, and an ancient television connected to a Nintendo 64 was always on when my cousins and I were there. And, of course, there was the Pizza Hut phone on the wall. 

 

That phone was an eyesore—a bright orange rotary model from the 1970s or 1980s, its long-coiled cord darkened with years of use. A faded Pizza Hut logo and an old phone number were stuck to the bottom. Nobody knew where it came from, and the older family members
 loved teasing my cousins and me about it, chuckling as we fumbled with the rotary dial. They found it hilarious that many of us didn’t know how to use it. But my brothers and I, raised on classic old movies, surprised our uncles by dialing it without a hitch.
 It was all good-natured fun, but the phone was purely decorative, nailed to the wall and unconnected to a landline. Nobody even knew if it worked. 

 

Everyone called it “The Big House.” Built in the late 1800s, it was one of the oldest livable homes in their small Southwest Virginia town, untouched by modern developments. Its size, central location, and three generations of family ownership made it the de
 facto spot for reunions and gatherings. As a child, I assumed the house had always been ours, but my uncle later told me it was built by another family. A man had constructed it for his wife and son, but the boy died of typhus shortly after they moved in,
 and the family left to escape the memories. My uncle loved teasing me, claiming the boy’s ghost haunted the house, but my grandmother always shut him down. 

 

“Don’t pay him no mind,” she’d say, her voice firm. “I’ve lived here my whole life, and I ain’t never seen or heard anything like that.” 

 

I didn’t believe my uncle’s stories, but years later, my dad confirmed the tale about the boy was true. 

 

Throughout my childhood, we visited my grandmother’s house often. As I got older, the visits grew longer, and she’d invite my brothers and cousins to spend the night. Those were magical evenings filled with fireworks in the backyard, water gun fights in the
 dark, and late-night Nintendo 64 marathons fueled by Pibb Xtra. I loved those sleepovers—until one night when I was nine, when I vowed never to sleep there again. 

 

It was the summer between fourth and fifth grade. My younger brother Thomas, my older cousin Jesse, and I were staying over at my grandmother’s. Around midnight, a heated wrestling match broke out over cheating accusations made during a game of Star Wars Episode
 I: Racer. Jesse, defending his honor, flipped Thomas over his shoulder, landing him squarely on the inflatable mattress my grandmother had set up. It didn’t survive the impact. 

 

“Nice going, Jesse,” I said, glaring. “Now we’re down to the couch and the recliner. One of us has to sleep on the floor.” 

 

Thomas, sprawled on the deflated mattress, looked relieved when he saw that my irritation was aimed at Jesse. 

 

“Make Thomas sleep on the floor,” Jesse said. “He started the fight, and he’s the youngest.” 

 

“No way!” Thomas shot back. “You were cheating, and that floor’s gross. You sleep there.” 

 

Jesse hadn’t cheated, but I had to back Thomas up, especially since he’d taken that suplex without complaint. I know that must’ve hurt. “Come on, Jesse,” I said. “You know this one’s on you. Just sleep on the floor.” 

 

“How about we grab the mattress from the guest room upstairs?” Jesse suggested. “We can drag it down here, and I’ll sleep on that.” 

 

“You know Grandma doesn’t want us upstairs,” I said. She wasn’t being strict; she just kept her fragile, valuable items up there and didn’t want us roughhousing around them. The wrestling match I’d just witnessed proved her point. Still, I knew Jesse wouldn’t
 drop it, and I didn’t want to end up on the floor. 

 

“We’ll be quick,” Jesse promised. 

 

“Fine,” I said. “But be quiet. I don’t want to wake Grandma and Grandad and explain what we’re doing and why at 1 a.m.” 

 

We crept up the stairs and down the hallway to the guest room. I’d never been inside it before—it was usually reserved for older relatives crashing overnight. As I eased the door open, a wave of hot, muggy air hit me. The house had no air conditioning, but
 this was stifling. The heat almost distracted me from the room’s unsettling decor: a glass display case filled with my grandmother’s childhood doll collection. I’d heard about her valuable dolls but never cared much, preferring camo clad action figures with
 plastic rifles over dolls with hairbrushes and dresses. Sweat trickled down my back, mingling with a growing sense of unease. I glanced at Jesse, who looked just as uncomfortable but stifled a laugh. 

 

“Seems like your kind of thing,” he whispered, smirking. 

 

“Shut up,” I hissed. “Grab that end, and let’s get out of here.” 

 

We carefully carried the mattress down the hallway, down the stairs, and into the living room. Thomas had started another race in the game. As we set the mattress down, Jesse asked, “Did you grab the sheets and pillow?” 

 

“Did it look like I had spare hands?” I snapped. 

 

“Fine, I’ll get drinks from the garage fridge, if you go grab them. That room was hot as hell.” Jesse said 

 

Rolling my eyes, I trudged back upstairs. As I approached the guest room, I noticed something odd: the door was closed. I hadn’t shut it—my hands were full with the mattress. A wave of unease washed over me. I considered turning back, but the thought of Thomas
 and Jesse mocking me pushed me forward. Gripping the doorknob, I braced myself. Would the dolls be out of their display case? Would someone be inside? My mind raced, my heart pounded. I closed my eyes and slowly opened the door. 

 

To my relief, nothing had changed. The dolls sat in their case, the room was empty, and the air was just as muggy as before. I grabbed the sheets and pillow, turned, and carefully closed the door, turning the knob to let it latch silently. Satisfied, I turned
 to head downstairs—and froze. 

 

The hallway stretched endlessly before me, an impossible expanse where the familiar walls of my grandmother’s house should have been. The stairs, which moments ago had been just a few steps away, were gone. The soft glow of the living room lights, the faint
 hum of Thomas and Jesse’s game downstairs—vanished. A suffocating darkness swallowed the far end of the hall. My breath caught in my throat, sharp and shallow, each inhale was dry and tasting of dust and something metallic, like old coins. My legs felt rooted
 to the floor, heavy as if the worn floorboards had fused with my feet. Panic surged in my mind, a cold wave that prickled my skin and sent my heart hammering so fiercely I thought it might burst. 

 

A pounding rhythmic buzz filled my ears, low and insistent, like a swarm of large insects trapped inside my skull. My vision narrowed, the edges of the hallway blurring—not from fear alone, but from shadows that seemed to writhe at the corners of my eyes. They
 were faint at first, like smudges on a window, but as I began to focus on them, they took shape: long, bony fingers, skeletal and deliberate, inching closer along the edge of my sight. What I had perceived as sweat trickling down my back now felt like fingertips—cold,
 deliberate, brushing against my spine. The sensation grew heavier, more distinct: hands, pressing against my shoulders, tugging me backward toward the guest room door. I wanted to scream, to run, but my body betrayed me. I was paralyzed, my muscles locked
 as if bound by invisible chains. 

 

The buzzing in my ears sharpened, and I realized it wasn’t my pulse causing the pressure in my ears. It was a ringing—a low, mechanical chime, but warped, as if it were echoing from some distant, hollow place. With each ring, the sound grew louder, more insistent,
 vibrating through my bones as if it were burrowing into to my head. The shadows thickened, curling like smoke, their bony fingers stretching toward me, brushing the edges of my vision. The air grew heavier, thick with the scent of mildew and ash. The hands
 on my back tightened, their grip no longer tentative but possessive, as if they meant to drag me into the darkness of the guest room—or somewhere deeper, somewhere I’d never return from. 

 

My heart pounded so hard I could feel it in my throat, each beat a desperate plea to move, to fight. I squeezed my eyes shut, the only act of defiance I could manage, and my mind scrambled for something—anything—to anchor me. Then I remembered the St. Michael
 prayer, the one my dad had drilled into me and was always prayed at the end of mass on Sunday mornings at church. Its words were etched into my memory, a lifeline from my childhood. I clung to them now, whispering them in my mind, my lips trembling as I formed
 the words. 

 

“St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil…” 

 

Each syllable felt like pointless flailing against the growing dread growing in me. The ringing grew louder, a piercing wail that seemed to mock my thoughts, echoing as if the phone were ringing not downstairs but inches from my ear. The shadows pressed closer,
 their fingers grazing my arms, leaving trails of ice on my skin. The hands on my back tightened, their touch no longer faint but sharp, like claws digging into my flesh, tearing at the thin fabric of my shirt. I clutched the sheets and pillow tighter, their fabric
 crumpling in my fists, grounding me as the house seemed to tilt and sway around me. The hallway stretched further, impossibly long, the darkness at its end pulsing like a living thing, hungry and waiting. Still, I pressed on, forcing the prayer through the
 fog of terror. 

 

“…by the power of God, cast into hell Satan and all the evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls. Amen.” 

 

Then the ringing stopped. 

 

I opened my eyes. The stairs reappeared, and the soft glow of downstairs lights flickered below, accompanied by the faint chatter of Thomas and Jesse playing their game. Soaked in sweat, hurried down the stairs, each step a desperate escape from the darkness
 above. In the living room, Ben and Jesse were sprawled on the floor, engrossed in their game, oblivious to the terror I’d just faced. I tossed the sheets onto the mattress and collapsed onto the couch, my heart still racing. 

 

“Jeez, did you piss on these?” Jesse asked, inspecting the damp sheets. “Why are they so wet?” 

 

“They were like that when I found them,” I lied, not wanting to admit how tightly I’d clutched them or why. “I’m exhausted. Keep it down—I’m going to sleep.”  I wrapped myself in a blanket, turned away from them, and faced the wall, where the orange phone hung
 silently, its orange plastic gleaming faintly in light from the TV. I repeated the St. Michael prayer in my mind, over and over, until exhaustion pulled me under, but sleep offered no escape from the unease that clung to me like damp cloth. 

 

**Part 2**

 

Years later, we moved a few states away, and I couldn’t have been happier. My parents thought it odd that I refused to sleep over at my grandmother’s anymore, but I brushed it off, blaming the uncomfortable old places to sleep or its nighttime heat. They never
 pressed me. When I was a junior in high school, we learned that new developments had reached my grandmother’s part of town. The state needed to widen the highway, requiring the demolition of the Big House for an exit ramp. They offered my grandparents a fair
 price to relocate, and while some family members were upset, my grandparents were relieved to move to a home with less upkeep and fewer stairs to climb. 

 

As they moved out, family members took pieces of the Big House—hardwood doors, bricks, cabinets, windows, anything they could salvage. By the time everyone was done, the house looked ready to collapse. Since my mom grew up there but now lived far away, my aunt
 sent her a box of items she thought she’d want: cast iron pans, some silverware, and, notably, the Pizza Hut phone. Before my dad got home from work, my mom hung it in our kitchen on a nail, just like it had been in the Big House. 

 

When my dad saw it, he laughed. “Really, Beth? You want that thing there? It’s hideous.” 

 

“What? You don’t like it?” my mom teased. 

 

He shook his head, still chuckling, and went to change out of his work clothes and put away his bag. 

 

That evening at dinner, my dad had just finished a comical story about his incompetent coworkers and turned to me. “So, are your grades improving yet?” he asked. Thomas and my older brother Cody snickered, knowing this was a recurring dinner topic. 

 

“Dad, I’m not planning on going to college anyway,” I said. “Why does a C in chemistry matter?” 

 

“It’s not about that, son. It’s about your work ethic. You think anyone will hire you if—” 

 

A sound cut him off, one I hadn’t heard in years. The Pizza Hut phone was ringing. I didn’t place it immediately—not until years later, when I began writing this story. The memory of that night at my grandmother’s, buried deep, clawed its way back, sending
 dread up my spine. 

 

“Did you plug it in?” my dad asked my mom. 

 

“We don’t even have a landline port,” she replied. 

 

We sat in stunned silence for a few rings. “Well, answer it,” my dad said. Before my mom could move, Thomas leaped up and grabbed the phone. 

 

Silence. 

 

No dial tone, no static—nothing. Thomas laughed, passing the phone around so we could listen. I forced myself to press it to my ear. At first, I heard nothing. But as I pulled it away, faint whispers brushed my ear. High and feminine whispers, almost like a
 child. I snapped it back, but the sound was gone. Nobody else seemed to hear it, and they didn’t notice my unease. We laughed nervously at first, but as we returned to our meal, we speculated about the cause—residual electricity, static in the air, something
 logical. None of us knew much about phones, so it seemed plausible enough. We finished dinner, chalking it up to just another addition to the family lore. 

 

The next day, Thomas and I returned from school, tossed our bags down, and I started making a sandwich in the kitchen while he loaded Black Ops Zombies on the PS3 for a split-screen game. Mid-bite, the phone rang again. I froze, looking at Thomas. His face
 had gone pale. We were alone, and it was far less funny without Dad there. Swallowing hard, I approached the phone with cold hands and lifted it to my ear. 

 

Whispering. 

 

Not like a phone call, but like murmurs from behind a closed door. I glanced at Thomas and waved him over. He sprinted to the kitchen and grabbed the phone, listening intently. 

 

“Do you hear that?” I whispered. 

 

“Are you screwing with me?” he replied. 

 

“What? No. You seriously don’t hear that?” I yanked the phone back to my ear. 

 

Silence again. We passed the phone back and forth a few times, but I could tell he didn’t believe me about the whispering. He probably thought I was being the typical older brother, trying to make an already unnerving situation worse. I hung up the phone, and
 after a moment, we both chuckled nervously. I could see the unease in Thomas’s eyes, mirroring my own, but what else could we do? It was a bright, sunny day, the house lights were on, and the TV sat idle with the pause menu of Black Ops Zombies glowing. It
 wasn’t exactly a horror movie scene. We brushed it off with the same excuses from the night before—static electricity, maybe—and returned to our game, content with a strange story to tell our parents when they got home. 

 

This scene repeated for months. Sometimes the phone stayed silent for days; other times, it rang twice in one afternoon, always around 3 p.m. Some days it rang once or twice and stopped; others, it kept ringing until someone picked it up. It became a game.
 After school, Thomas and I would linger near the kitchen, waiting for the ring, then race to answer it first. When friends came over, they’d sometimes hear it too, proving we weren’t lying. A small legend grew at school—classmates I barely knew would ask about
 the “haunted phone.” Some bought into the tale wholeheartedly, while others were skeptical. Even my earth science teacher pulled me aside one morning after class. “Why do you think your phone is ringing?” he asked. “Do you think it’s really haunted?” 

 

The attention almost dulled the phone’s eeriness. I thought hearing it ring so often would desensitize me, but it never did. The whispers persisted, faint and fleeting, but I stopped mentioning them. Nobody believed me—not even Thomas—and they thought I was
 exaggerating to scare them. So, I stayed silent, hanging up each time the murmurs brushed my ear. 

 

After a few months, the novelty wore off. To most of our friends and family, the ringing became an annoyance. My mom would be in the kitchen, hear the phone, and lift the handset just to set it back down, silencing it with an exasperated sigh. But Thomas and
 I kept our tradition alive. After school, we’d race to answer it, listening intently for something—anything—beyond the silence. I’d hear whispers; Thomas would hear nothing. “I’m not a baby,” he’d snap. “You’re just trying to freak me out.” I stopped admitting
 what I heard, knowing he didn’t believe me. 

 

One day, about a week before summer break, we got home early after finals. Thomas booted up the PS3 in the living room while I started making lunch in the kitchen. The phone rang at 11 a.m.—earlier than ever before. There was no race this time; Thomas was preoccupied
 with the game. I walked over, picked up the handset, and pressed it to my ear. Instantly, a deafening, blood-curdling scream tore through the phone. A wave of panic crashed over me. In the half-second before I dropped the handset in sheer surprise and terror,
 I heard something unmistakable—not a fake horror-movie scream, but a raw, anguished cry, as if someone were standing beside me, screaming in pure agony. Beneath it, faint but clear, was the sound of another phone ringing on the other end. 

 

Every hair on my body stood on end, and my stomach lurched so violently I thought I might vomit. My face drained of color, my legs trembling as my body screamed to flee. The handset hit the wall with a clatter, and the scream continued, echoing through the
 kitchen. Thomas rushed in, drawn by the noise audible even over the TV. We stared at the phone in dumbstruck silence for several seconds until the screaming stopped. The house fell quiet. With trembling hands, I approached the phone, lifted it, and listened.
 Nothing. I placed it back on the hook, my heart still pounding. Thomas and I couldn’t muster a laugh this time. Dread hung between us, thick and heavy. 

 

“W-what was that?” Thomas stammered, trying to stifle the fear in his voice. 

 

I shook my head, staring at the phone. My expression must have unnerved him further. 

 

“What the hell was that?!” he demanded, his voice rising. 

 

“I—I have no idea,” I managed. 

 

Nothing like that had ever happened before. The terror I’d felt in the Big House’s hallway at nine years old flooded back, crashing over me in waves. I wanted to cry; the fear was so overwhelming. My mind scrambled for a rational explanation—an electrical surge
 through the nail on the wall, maybe? But it was a clear, sunny day, no storms, no flickering lights. Every electronic in the house worked fine. I was at a loss. 

 

That evening, my mother came home, balancing her cell phone on her shoulder as she fumbled with keys in one hand and grocery bags in the other. She kicked the door shut, glancing at Thomas and me with mild annoyance when we didn’t help with the groceries. We
 were too lost in our own world, having spent the afternoon rehearsing how to tell our parents about the scream, debating whether they’d believe us. We’d decided they probably wouldn’t but agreed to try anyway. As Mom set the bags on the kitchen table, she
 finished her phone call. 

 

“I know… I know… It really is tragic. I’m glad you guys were there to see it, though. Able to send it off, you know?” she said. “Well, tell Mom I’m sorry I’m not there. I wish I could be. There were a lot of memories wrapped up there… Listen, I just got home,
 and I need to start dinner. I’ll talk to you later… Right. I love you too. Bye.” 

 

The same thought struck Thomas and me. We exchanged a glance, then looked at Mom. 

 

“Who was that?” I asked. 

 

“Your aunt,” she replied. “She called me on my way home from the store.” 

 

“What did she say?” I pressed, urgency creeping into my voice. 

 

She gave me a quizzical look. “She was a little upset today. The demolition of the Big House was scheduled for noon today. She took a long lunch to watch them tear it down with Grandma and Grandad. It’s a sad day,” she said, her lips pursing slightly. 

 

My mind raced, connecting the dots. She said noon, but that didn’t add up—until I remembered the time zone difference. They were an hour ahead of us, meaning the phone rang at the exact moment the Big House was demolished. 

 

I blurted it all out, abandoning the careful, rational approach Thomas and I had planned. I told Mom everything—the ringing, the whispers, the scream. She laughed, rolling her eyes. 

 

“That’s quite the ghost story you guys will have to tell your friends at school,” she teased, turning to unpack the groceries. 

 

“I swear it happened, Mom,” Thomas burst out. 

 

“Sure, sweetie,” she said. “Do you guys have homework to finish before dinner?” 

 

She didn’t believe us, and I couldn’t blame her. The story sounded too fantastical. But the terror lingered, my hair still standing on end as I recounted it. Over dinner, I told Dad the same story. 

 

“Ha!” he exclaimed. “The guys at work are going to love that one. I can’t wait to tell them on Monday.” 

 

He shared a grin with Mom, and I glanced at Thomas. We were thinking the same thing: Nobody will ever believe what happened. 

 

As the school year ended and the hot weeks of summer dragged on, the phone never rang again. After months of constant ringing, the silence from it was noticeable. I was grateful for it, but the longer it went without ringing, the more my parents seemed to consider
 our story. They never fully believed us, but I could tell they wondered what had caused it to stop. 

 

To this day, the phone hangs on a nail in my parents’ kitchen. I’ve become the uncle who teases my nieces and nephews about not knowing how to use a rotary phone, scaring them with ghost stories about the phone that rang despite being unplugged. I tell the
 tale at bars, over campfires, or to coworkers over lunch. But I always leave out my dreams and my experience in the hallway. I’ve never found the courage or the words to describe that terror. When I visit home, I see the phone, but it has never rung again—not
 since the day the Big House was torn down. The only place that phone still rings is in my dreams.
