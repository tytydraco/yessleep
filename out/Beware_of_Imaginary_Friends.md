When I was a kid I had a lot of "imaginary friends". One could say that I had an overactive imagination. There were five and they all had complex personalities, as if they were real people. They weren’t just imaginary to me, they felt so real. It was odd, though, as I would only play with them in one of three places: my room, the basement, or my treehouse. The weirdest part was that the area where I was playing would also seem to decide who I could see and interact with. As if specific “friends” could only exist in certain spaces, which was the oddest thing, even to my young mind. All my real friends could see their imaginary friends anywhere and anytime. At the same time, though, their imaginary friends were things like talking animals or combinations of different animals. All of mine were people, kids just like me. 

For context, you must know that Julia and Fred were my "basement friends", while Lisa and Sylvia were my "treehouse friends". Carlos would only appear in my bedroom, but George was different. George was with me everywhere I went. He was my best "friend", he'd go to school with me, play at *real* friends' houses with me, and he would sleep in my bed. It even got to the point that I asked my parents for a bigger bed, so George and I could have more space. We were attached at the hip, and George seemed to love me. As I mentioned, it felt like more than just an imagined friendship. It felt like he was real. To the point that he would create indents in my bed and pillow.

Another odd detail that I can clearly remember is that anytime I was in the basement playing with Julia and Fred, George would typically sit in the corner. He always seemed upset when I would play with those two specifically as if he didn't like them or something. George didn't seem to mind the rest as much. As I grew I just chalked it up to my overactive child imagination. That I was just giving too much into these characters. Little did I know that I would receive some form of confirmation that they perhaps were not, in fact, just in my head.

As I got older and older, they slowly went away. Not George, though, he still stuck around everywhere I went. Then, when I was 16 and a sophomore in high school, I had to do a research project for my history class. I was at the library, thumbing through old newspaper archives. That's when I found it, the article that would change everything I had ever thought about my childhood. It was a paper dated April 23rd, 1957 and the headline read: "Missing Children Found; Local Man in Custody". As a true crime junkie, this caught my eye. I had never heard of such an intense local case. I looked around, no George, and no real people. So, I dove headfirst into the craziest rabbit hole I would ever encounter. 

"Local man, George Redding, was arrested today in connection with the disappearance, and subsequent deaths, of five local children. These children disappeared over the previous year, and their remains were recently uncovered at Redding's property. Redding, pictured above, is being held on five counts of murder. The supposed first victim, Frederick Downs, was reported missing on February 2nd of last year. His remains were the first to be uncovered in the basement of the home, which is located at 2357 East Eagle Road." 

My blood ran cold and I stopped dead in my tracks. I was unaware of the history of my childhood home. I was not privy to these missing children, who were thirty years dead by the time I was born and brought into the home. Could my parents have known about this? Some of the kids were my dad’s age when they disappeared. I continued reading, and things became more and more clear. Lisa and Sylvia appeared in my treehouse because their remains were found in the woods. Fred and Julia appeared in the basement for the same reason. Maybe some part of them had become attached to these places. 

The part that disturbed me the most was that Carlos was found in *the bedroom closet*. Apparently, after doing more research, Carlos had been George's favorite. So much so that, even after death, George would keep Carlos' body right with him. George detailed this in a sort of deathbed confession. Just before his execution, a journalist recorded his final words, which mostly consisted of him talking about how much he had favored Carlos. Carlos was "easier" than the rest, he didn't fight as much. Fred, however, was the opposite. Fred, who was 13 at the time he died, fought back so aggressively that he had broken a couple of George's fingers. In the end, Fred failed to overpower that monster. 

After I finished digging through documents, I had nothing to contribute to my project, but I did have goosebumps and a lot of information to process. Could my whole childhood truly have been spent playing with ***ghosts***? Up to that point I had been a skeptic in my own right. I couldn't seem to understand it, not then anyway. It did explain some things, like the specific locations that I would see these…kids. As well as their complex, lifelike personalities that I still fail to remember making up. One thing that it did not explain though, George. 

George appeared to me as a child, not a young adult. His obituary pinned him at about 25 when he faced the chair. When he had abducted Fred, George would have been about 23. So, why did he come to me as a child? Another thing that I spent some time questioning was this: how did George seem to follow me everywhere I went? How come I was the only one to see him and not my friends and family as well? I was left with more questions than answers, so I began to seek out someone who may have had the answers. Someone with more spiritual knowledge than my skeptical mind held.
