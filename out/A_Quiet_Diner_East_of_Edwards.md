I was outside the diner smoking a cigarette when the cops rolled into the parking lot.


The pair was in an unmarked car, which meant they were experienced - it takes time to get to the level of wearing plain clothes when you’re on duty. There was only one reason a couple of high-ranking law enforcement agents would be here in Edwards and I knew why. Everyone in town did.


Three murdered . . . in three months.


I’ve had a good sense of hearing for a long time, and as the two cops walked toward the diner I could hear them discussing between themselves on how to handle the interview.


Interview?


Shit.


I tossed my cigarette butt on the ground and offered them a pleasant smile.


“Hey, y’all,” I said with my drawled Southern accent. “Come on in, get some breakfast. Can I get you fellas some coffee?”


The two men were tall and well-manicured: clean shaven faces, no nonsense haircuts. They wore the same cologne, which I thought was funny, but their suits were different.


“Sounds great, ma’am,” Navy Suit said. “I take my coffee black.”


“Cream and sugar for me,” Gray Suit said.


They took a booth by the front window and I went around the counter to find Lola bringing out three plates of breakfast food. The plate balancing on her forearm tilted and I reached to grab it before it dumped eggs all over the customers sitting at the counter.


“Thanks, Grace,” Lola said. “Great reflexes.”


“When you’ve worked at diners as long as I have, you learn how to spot accidents before they happen.”


Grace nodded toward our newest customers with a puzzled look.


“Cops, I think.” I said. “I’m getting their coffee now.”


I brought them their drinks and took a notepad out of my apron. The faster they ate they faster they could leave. Everyone in the diner knew why they were here and it was making the customers nervous.


“What’ll it be, boys? You seem like waffle men to me.”


They didn’t watch my smile, but instead looked at my chest.


“We’re not here for breakfast, ma’am,” Navy Suit said. “We’re here to see you.”


“Me?”


Gray Suit pointed to the name tag on my chest. “Your name is Grace? Grace Burton?”


I nodded.


Navy Suit stood and offered his hand. “I’m Detective Hartwig, this is Detective Cable. We’re from upstate and have been called in to assist in the ongoing investigation-”


“Let me stop you right there, detective.” My voice was more acidic than necessary. “I know why you’re here. Everyone does. In a town with 1,034 people-”


“1,031 people now, ma’am.”


I stared at my feet. Hartwig moved into the booth with his partner and pointed across the table. “Please sit. We only want to ask a few questions.”


“If I refuse?”


Hartwig gestured to his coffee. “We could finish these . . . at the police station.”


I rolled my eyes then sat across from them. 


Cable removed a folder from his inner jacket pocket and scanned the papers inside. “It says here you are 62 years old.”


“That’s correct.”


He smiles. “I hope you don’t mind me saying, but you don’t look a day over forty.”


“I get that a lot. I’m a vegetarian. What do you gentlemen want?”


Hartwig straightened his tie. “When you were 25 years old you were involved in an incident at this diner.”


My skin grew cold. “You want to know about what happened in 1987?”


“Yes. Particularly the events that lead to the death of your boyfriend at the time -” he looked at his notes - “Peter Callen.”


“Why do you want me to bring up painful memories, detectives?”


“Three people have been murdered in Edwards over the last few months,” Cable seethed. “We’ve been gathering information from the past about this small Mississippi town and your file came up. There have only been two major incidents of homicides in Edwards: now and in 1987. And you’re the only connection between the two.”


Hartwig quickly added, “We aren’t saying you’re a suspect, mind you, but we refuse to leave any stone left unturned. We’ve seen the briefs about your testimony from that night, but we want to hear it from your own mouth, Ms. Burton.” 


“Okay.” I grabbed Cable’s coffee for myself and took a sip. The men traded glances. “My shift at the diner started late that night. I remember walking through the parking lot and being amazed. The moon was so full and bright it left shadows under the cars.”


***


I pulled my 1980 Chevy Citation into the lot and reapplied my lipstick while Bob Seger blasted over the radio. The song was from his newest album, Like a Rock. Great album by the way. Anyway, I got out of my car and walked toward the building. Like I said, the moon was so bright that night.


I’d been working at Silver Spoon Diner for two years, so I knew what to expect. The usuals ate earlier, before my shift started, so the only ones stopping in a diner that late were those society might deem uncouth: truckers coming back to empty houses; randoms just passing through on their way to Jackson; insomniacs wasting another sleepless night; people running from trouble or people running toward trouble.


I came into work every day with a smile on my face and that night was no different. Wendy, another waitress, greeted me with a hug, a Marlboro Red 100 propped between her lips. Back then everyone smoked. The diner itself could get foggy during busy hours from the secondhand smoke. Anyway, Wendy walked with me to the back while I put my personables in my locker.


Since I had worked at the diner the longest, I had a copy of the key that locked the front and back doors. I slipped it in my pocket then put on my waitress apron while Wendy went on about a new movie she’d just watched in theaters.


Wendy removed her cigarette. “Oh, you should have seen him, Grace. He was lifting her so high and spinning her around like she was weightless.”


“So I should go see it?”


“It’s worth the $3.50 movie ticket price to see Patrick Swayze. When he took his shirt off I was drooling . . . like, literally, drooling.”


“Big whoop. You know how Peter gets when I look at other men. He’s the most jealous boyfriend ever.”


Wendy kissed the air and rolled her eyes. “More Swayze for me then.”


She went to help customers while I made a circuit around the kitchen. Our cook, Penny, dropped some thin bacon on the stovetop with a sizzle. He was athletic and tall, but an injury took away his chances at a football scholarship. He was hilarious though, and worked his ass off.


“What’s up, G,” he called when he saw me. “It’s been a slow night. You’re lucky.”


“Slow night means slow tips.”


“Word. I feel that. I only have a few hours left until I’m outta here. Marco should be in soon to take my place.”


I went to the front of the diner right as a man in a tan suit came in. It was rare to find someone like that in here this late at night but I assumed he was traveling for business or something. I took the notepad out of my apron and offered him a smile. Smiles always increase tips.


“What’ll you have, darling?”


“Water and coffee to start.” He scanned the menu. “And since my name is Toast, I’ll have three pieces of toast. Strawberry jelly too.”


I jotted down his order. “Your name is Toast?”


“Robert Toast.” He patted his pocket then gave me a business card. “I’m a real estate agent. I’m traveling to Texas for a convention.” He held up his briefcase. “You in the market for a new home?”


I winked. “Depends how much you tip me.”


I left him laughing and went to the prep area to hang the ticket for Penny. Wendy found me with a worried look on her face.


“He’s such a fucking asshole,” she whispered.


“Who?” I asked.


“Bill. He told me he wanted some chicken breasts . . . hold the chicken.”


We all knew Bill. He was a trucker with irregular hours, but preferred to drive at night. He usually ate at the diner before he got on the road. He was young, around my age, and he had a thick bushy mustache and wore very tight jeans that showed his bulge. All the waitresses at the diner knew he wore them to try to impress us but it had the opposite effect. He was boorish, lewd, and a pervert. I told Wendy to switch customers with me and she obliged.


“Ah, Grace,” Bill said as I approached him with his plate of waffles and bacon. “Two waitresses in one night. It’s not the first time I’ve had two women in one night.”


“I doubt it.”


I turned to go but he grabbed my wrist. “Hold on, girl.”


I jerked away. “Don’t touch me.”


“Feisty. I love em’ feisty.” He laughed harshly. “I dropped my straw on the floor. Can you bend down and get it for me? Bend really . . . really . . . low.”


“I’ll get a new one from the back.” I left before he could keep being a creep and went behind the counter to help a woman sitting with her young son. She had on a button-up shirt and her name tag said “Erin”. It was clear she’d worked all day in retail, probably a double shift. She looked absolutely exhausted but her child was wound up like a ball of energy. 


“How can I help you, ma’am.”


“Hash browns and two waffles. Does that sound good, Jonah?” Her son tapped his little fingers on the napkin box and giggled. The noise was an irritant to his mother who patted him gently to stop. He didn’t.


Feeling bad for the fatigued mother and wanting to help in any way I could, I got close to the little boy and acted like I was telling him a secret. “If you’ll stay on your best behavior, and don’t make a mess, I’ll give you some free ice cream later.”


Jonah’s face lit up and he looked at his mother for reassurance. She nodded then mouthed “Thank you” to me. The kid stopped tapping the box and sat very still.


Fifteen or twenty minutes went by like that. Wendy and I checked on the customers in the restaurant: Robert Toast, the real estate agent; Bill, the pervy truck driver; Erin, the mom and her little boy, Jonah. It was a small crowd but that was expected on a random weekday night. What happened next was unexpected.


My boyfriend, Peter Callen, came through the diner’s front doors in a mad panic. He had blood on his arm.


The customers stirred as Peter rushed to me.


“Grace! Grace! Lock the doors.”


“Peter, oh my God. You’re bleeding-”


“Lock the damn doors. Something is outside!”


I fumbled the key out of my pocket but Peter snatched it from my grasp. He ran to the front door and locked it, pulling at the doors to make sure the lock held. He ran past me and I saw he had a wound on his right arm.


Blood dotted the floor on his way to the back door. I heard him lock it too.


“What the hell are you doing?” Bill shouted when Peter came back into the seating area.


Peter jumped on one of the empty booths and peered through the large windows that faced the parking lot. “Something is out there. Something big.”


“Peter,” I gently touched his back. He swung around like a frightened child. “You’re bleeding on the table.”


He looked down at his wound. Small ribbons of ripped flesh made a line along his forearm. “Shit. I need to clean this up. It bit me. It fucking bit me!”


“What did?” Toast, the salesman, asked, hugging his briefcase.


Peter glared back through the window, into the deep dark night. “I don’t know. Some kind . . . some kind of dog or something. I came here to surprise you, Grace. I had flowers and everything, but something came out of the damn woods. It was fast . . . so . . . fast-”


He trailed off. I took him by the hand and helped him off the booth. “You’re safe now. Go to the bathroom and get cleaned up.”


“Unlock the fucking doors first,” Bill shouted. “I gotta leave soon.”


“Please stop cursing around my son,” Erin shouted back.


Peter looked around the room. “I had to lock the doors. If that thing got in . . .”


He trailed off again and searched the faces of everyone. Wendy and Penny were standing by the food pick-up area, watching intently at what was going on. Peter was always one to lead in a sticky situation. Me, Penny, and Wendy knew that. He was shrewd and didn’t spook easily, so his unraveled temperament made us all a little nervous. Something had happened. Something he couldn’t wrap his head around.


Peter continued. “I’ll get cleaned up and then we can call the police.” He held his stomach and winced. “I’ll unlock the doors when they get here. It’s not safe outside.”


He disappeared into the men’s bathroom while Bill protested. Everyone ignored him. Me, Penny, and Wendy knew if Peter was advising everyone to stay inside, then everyone should listen.


“A raccoon bites him and he wants to call the police?” Bill shouted. “This is bullshit.”


I felt the need to defend my boyfriend. “If Peter says we should stay then that’s what we should do. You don’t know what’s out there.”


Bill lit a cigarette and puffed out a plume of smoke under his mustache. He sarcastically looked out the window and pointed the lit end of his cigarette at the glass. “I see a few parked cars, some trees, and a big full moon. That’s it.”


Toast clutched his briefcase and looked back toward the bathrooms. “Do you hear that?”


His question was interrupted by a question from Erin. “Cops? Why does he want to call the cops?” Jonah was scared now from all the shouting. His eyes never left the dots of Peter’s blood on the tiled floor.


“Cops have guns. Guns mean safety,” Penny said from behind his kitchen window. 


Bill shook his head. “Cops won’t do anything except laugh their asses off when they find an overgrown rat running through the parking lot.”


“A rat couldn’t do that to Peter’s arm,” Wendy objected. “I’m not going outside until the cops get here.”


“I hear something,” the salesman said again. No one paid him any attention. Emotions were too high.


Wendy leaned against a wall, wringing a dry towel out over and over again. “Are there bears in Mississippi? Is there a bear outside?”


“A lion, a tiger, a bear, oh my,” Bill said with a huff.


Penny said, “This discussion is ridiculous. Everyone stays put until we know what’s going on.”


Bill stubbed his cigarette into an ashtray. “A lowlife fry cook isn’t gonna tell me what to do. Stay in the kitchen and keep your mouth shut.”


Penny hopped through the pick-up area window and paced past the counter. “Or what? What the hell are you gonna do if I don’t?”


Bill and Penny got into each other’s faces while Wendy and I shouted for them to call down. Erin shouted for everyone to stop scaring her child. Jonah was frowning now, tears welling in his eyes from the confrontation. The shouting intensified and emotions ran high. A fight was about to break out.


“Shut up and listen,” Toast shouted. Everyone stopped and turned to him. He was shaking and staring at the door to the men’s bathroom. Peter was in there. “Do you hear that?”


And we did. It was a light, crunching sound. The patter of something hitting against the bathroom walls came from behind the door and the entire group took a step closer to hear it better. 


“Peter?” I called out. “Are you okay?”


“He might have passed out from blood loss,” Penny said. His comment cinched my heart tightly. My boyfriend was not only wounded, he could potentially die? The thought crushed me. I started toward the bathroom door and twisted the knob.


As soon as the door’s latch disengaged, the door was rocketed open, hitting me back several feet. My eyesight went blurry and I felt a knot swelling on my forehead. My world spun around before finally coming back to focus on the open bathroom door. I thought I’d find Peter, apologizing for accidentally knocking me to the ground.


But it wasn’t Peter.


It was something else.


“Oh my God,” I mumbled and scurried backwards on the cold floor. Away from the monstrosity that was before me.


A thick furry body stood on four powerful legs. Clawed paws clattered on the tile floor. The head was oddly human and . . . . familiar.


“Peter?” I asked, astonished.


What remained of Peter’s face bent and gnarled under some internal pressure. His strong chin jutted forward into elongated jaws. His forehead scrunched down, forming the slope of a canine skull. His eyes drew back, the irises milking over then darkening like ink had been spilled into them. He opened his mouth and a guttural moan escaped, but not before his nose jutted forward and developed into a snarling snout. 


Wendy ran over and helped me to my feet. Everyone watched in horror as my boyfriend changed. 


Now, standing before us in the small hallway that led to the bathrooms, was no longer Peter, but some kind of bizarre wolf-like creature with a thick gray mane and hairy muscles rippling over its body. Black, soulless eyes regarded my wide-eyed stare. Tall hairy ears twitched and jerked at sounds unheard by human ears.


The creature lifted its lips to reveal a set of incredible teeth. Jagged, sharp, numerous. It looked more like the mouth of something out of the depths of the ocean than something that would live on land. The jaws unhinged, the lips drew back farther, and a deafening howl echoed around the diner.


We all covered our ears but the volume and pitch seemed to rattle me to my core.


The terrifying sound thrust everyone into action.


Bill lunged for the door and pulled the handles with all his might. The lock held. Toast scrambled over his table and fell onto the ground, his briefcase still gripped in his hands, then he followed Wendy and Penny who jumped behind the counter. Erin and Jonah ran to the far side of the diner and squatted between the jukebox and a booth.


I stood there, staring stupidly at the thing that used to be my boyfriend.


“Grace,” Penny yelled. “Get over here.”


My legs churned toward the counter just as the wolf leapt away from the bathroom. It moved with unbelievable speed, dodging potted plants and cardboard boxes with deft athleticism. I dove headlong over the counter and crashed into Wendy.


We heard Bill scream.


Penny slowly lifted his eyes above the counter. His face went pale and slack, then we squatted down again. He tucked his legs against his chest and put his head on his knees.


Bill’s wet pleas were replaced by grotesque sounds that filled the diner. A chorus of ripping flesh and snapping bones. I went to look but Penny clutched my arm and held me down. He shook his head intently. Whatever was happening, he didn’t want me to witness it.


We all stared at one another, in complete shock, until the noises of violence stopped. They were replaced by deep inhalations from near the front door - the sound a bloodhound makes when it discovers the scent of a favorite quarry. Claws clacked against the diner’s floor. Peter, or whatever it was, was moving away from the door and toward the corner of the room.


Toward the jukebox.


Erin and Jonah didn’t have much time.


I reached across Wendy, who silently sobbed, and grabbed a glass of Coca-Cola out of the mini-fridge. I hurled it toward the other side of the restaurant and it smashed loudly against the wall.


The slow-paced click-clack of canine paws stopped, turned, then jolted toward the sound.


I crawled to the far end of the counter and found the mother and her son in an embrace, heads buried into each other’s shoulders. “Erin,” I whispered. She turned and saw me and I waved her over. They left their spot behind the corner booth and ran to us.


Peter was faster.


The force at which the wolf-thing hit them slammed them into the jukebox. Sparks shot out then the internal mechanism began to play something, but the speed at which it played was so slow the instruments and voice formed hollow wailing bass notes. I reached out for the both of them, finding a small hand and latching onto it. I pulled with all my might to get them to safety behind the counter.


It was only Erin.


Jonah’s neck was fixed tightly between powerful jaws and his gurgling protests were immediately halted with a snap of teeth. I covered Erin’s mouth to prevent her from screaming while Penny held her back from doing something as stupid as trying to take on the beast bare-handed. It was no use . . . her son was dead.


My heart sank with the thought that Jonah would never get the ice cream I promised him.


Penny forcibly pulled the mother into the far side of the L-shaped counter. Wendy, Toast and I followed, scooting on the ground as silently as we could. My heart beat so loudly I knew Peter would be able to hear it with those monstrous ears. We all collected into the small space behind the counter, a huddled mass of appalled, anxious people who had no idea what was happening. People who had no idea how it was happening.


The warbled, low-pitched music seeping through the damaged jukebox ceased and there was a sudden palpable stillness in the air.


Deep inhalations started again, as did the soft clacks of claws on tile. Peter had transformed into something murderous. Something evil. A predator eager to slip some more prey between its teeth. Fortunately, the posture of being on all fours prevented him from easily seeing over the countertop, thank God. 


I didn’t know what was going on but I did know that once Peter turned the corner, we’d all be sitting ducks. We had to get out of sight. I motioned for Penny to go over the counter. He understood immediately but Erin was pale as a sheet. Her eyes were glossed over, a look of dissociation etched on her face. Her limbs were noodles. The only way to get her over the counter was to toss her over.


Peter moved closer, his deep breaths echoing off the wall that housed the jukebox. 


Wendy went over first while Penny manipulated Erin. She didn’t fight or talk. Toast wept silently while he slid over the smooth counter, doing a bad job of staying low and out of sight from Peter. I aided Penny with Erin, then he slid over too just as I saw long whiskers jut from the other side of the aisle.


The dark curve of a canine nose passed the threshold just as I slid over the opposite side of the counter.


Now we were back where we started, near the hallway, but we were out of sight from whatever the hell Peter had transformed into. Our backs were against the wooden foundation of the counter. To our left was the men’s bathroom. To the right was Bill’s body . . . and the front door.


The door!


I checked my pockets for the key before remembering that Peter . . . uh, human Peter . . . had taken it.


We were trapped inside.


Wendy touched my shoulder and pointed toward the stationary stools lined under the counter. She motioned there then back, signaling we had to get into the kitchen area. It was mostly enclosed and was the only place to hide. However, we would have to sneak past Peter to get there. It was our only option. I nodded, then tapped Penny.


Before I could gesture, Erin jumped to her feet.


Our attempts to stop her were in vain. Erin grabbed a steak knife from the counter and dove over the edge. She wailed her son’s name, bringing the knife up and down in a savage cutting motion. The rest of us looked at one another in rapt amazement. There was a sharp cracking of glass and of cans tumbling from their homes on shelves.


Then the screams started.


Knowing we were powerless to save her, we crawled like toddlers around the stationary stools, willing ourselves to stay low to avoid being seen. Or from seeing the devastation so close to us. 


We reached the short arm of the “L” and hesitated. Peter was crunching on something wet and tough. Between each slurp slipped out an unsatiated growl. He wanted more.


Penny was the first to hop through the open space of the counter and into the kitchen. He held the door open for Wendy. She hesitated once, found her inner strength, and made it across.


I was next and my legs felt like they were formed out of concrete. I concentrated on the door, on the signaling hands and faces of my coworkers, and began to push myself toward them. Toast blasted past me, causing me to stumble. He sauntered through the door.


I was left exposed in the middle of the open area.


Peter was lying down on the rubber mat next to the soda dispenser. He faced away from me. Thank God for small mercies. What wasn’t merciful was what he was doing to Erin’s body. An arm, severed at the shoulder, lay parallel to his bushy tail. Her torso rocked back and forth with every hinge of his jaws on her flesh. Her head lolled lazily on a bloody neck, her lifeless eyes piercing me like they were willing me to continue. To go on. To move, dammit!


I did.


With the four of us out of view in the kitchen, Penny flipped the small door bolt that fed into the floor. It wasn’t much protection against what lay outside so he began to stack boxes and crates against the door as silently as he could. He was sweating, his lips forming a soft prayer with each additional pound placed against the door for our protection. Every rattle of glass or tinkled of metal made me flinch.


“Is the backdoor locked?” Wendy whispered.


I nodded. “Peter locked it too.”


She wiped her eyes and gave me a combative stare. “Did he do that because he knew what was about to happen?”


Had the situation not called for silence, I would have slapped her. Peter . . . or, at least the old Peter I knew . . . would never do something like this. He had a good heart. He loved people.


He loved me.


I held her hands in my own. “Peter would never do that. You know that. Something . . . changed him.”


A fresh stream of tears rolled down her cheeks. “Then what do we do since both exits are locked?”


Toast was close now, eavesdropping to see what plan I would come up with. Penny stacked a cardboard box full of paper towels on the top of his barrier then joined the group. He, too, was waiting to hear our next move.


“Peter took my keys with him when he went into the bathroom. They must still be in there.”


“And?” Penny whispered.


“We need to get them.”


Toast sat on the floor and brought his briefcase into his lap.


Penny looked toward his makeshift barrier. “How do you expect us to do that?”


“We have to trap Peter or-”


“Or what?”


“Or fight.”


The small serving window became alive with violent life. Peter’s canine head filled the space and we all jumped back in surprise. The creature squirmed and jerked its torso but it couldn’t fit through the small opening. Sharp teeth snapped together like the sound of grotesque chimes. The movement shot globs of gore toward us - pieces of Erin.


“We’re trapped! We’re trapped,” Wendy screamed.


“No, we’re not,” Penny announced.


He had a saucepan in his hands. It was filled with the hot grease from the fry station he used for french fries.


He turned to me. “It’s time to fight.”


Before I could respond, Penny stepped toward Peter and hurled the hot grease onto his face. Skin sizzled. Flesh bubbled. The smell of burning dog fur filled the kitchen.


Peter fell away from the counter, whimpering and pawing at his snout. The four of us backed away to the far side of the kitchen, each finding something as a weapon: a knife, a ladle, a skillet, a broom. Our tools were meager but they gave us a sense of comfort to have something in our hands.


The barking shrieks of pain eventually softened to whines. Then Peter was silent. We didn’t dare look into the window to see where he was. Instead, we huddled together on the kitchen floor, silently praying that someone would find us soon. We stayed like that for a long time. A hour? Maybe three hours? Once fear overtakes your brain, time loses all meaning. Eventually Toast began to weep.


“I lied,” he mumbled through his tears.


Wendy grabbed his shoulder. “What are you talking about?”


“I lied about being a real estate agent.” He shook his head and stared at the dirty tile between his legs. “I used to be a real estate agent . . . but not anymore.”


I touched his hand, knowing he was having a breakdown. “It’s okay, Toast-”


“No, it’s not.” He wiped the snot from his nose. “I made a few bad deals . . .  got into debt . . . then I made a few more bad deals . . . and now my wife has left me and taken the kids. I’m a failure at real estate. A failure of a husband. A failure as a father.”


I touched his briefcase. “I thought you were going to Texas for a convention?”


His expression grew solemn when he spun the briefcase around and opened it. “I lied about that too. I was going to use this on myself in the parking lot.”


There were no papers in the briefcase. No folders full of files or real estate contracts. The only item was a pistol.


“Holy shit,” Penny whispered. “Is that thing loaded?”


Toast nodded. “I figured if I was going to die then why not have one last meal. I found this diner and decided I’d do it here . . . away from my family.” Toast planted his head on his knees and began to sob.


While Penny and Wendy consoled Toast, I secretly grabbed the pistol and checked the magazine. Toast was telling the truth. The pistol was fully loaded.


Suddenly my plan to fetch the key became a lot easier.


“Where are you going?” Wendy asked when I got to my feet.


“I’m going to get the key. We have to get the fuck out of here.”


I ignored Penny and Wendy’s protests and bellied up to the service window. Bloody paw prints made laps around the counter and dining area, but I didn’t see Peter. I knew he was close though.


I eased out of the window but when my feet touched the group there was a loud clang. I held my breath, wondering what the hell I landed on. Then there was another clang. And another.


“Grace! Grace, let me in!”


Marco, the backup cook, was standing outside the front door. He waved and smiled at me as I stood there in disbelief. Clang! Clang! He knocked on the glass door again and yelled. “Hurry up, Grace. Why are the doors locked? Wait, oh shit, are you holding a gun?”


Then he looked down and saw the mangled body of Bill.


A rabid snarl erupted down the hallway before a blur of fury charged. Marco only had time to brace himself before the hulking mass of fur and teeth exploded through the doors, buckling them off the hinges and sending shards of glass into the parking lot.


Marco, now covered in small scratches, quickly got to his feet and sprinted toward his car. Peter lay on what was left of the doors and I knew that Marco would make it. He’d get into his car, speed toward town, and soon every police officer in a hundred miles would be here to save us.


Then something dashed out of the dark woods and tackled Marco.


It was another wolf creature. Bigger than Peter.


I gasped and held the pistol tighter.


It was the one that originally bit Peter. It had been waiting in the woods. Waiting for us to escape the confines of the building. It had set a trap.


Knowing both creatures were at the front of the diner made a lightbulb go off in my brain. The backdoor. We could escape through the backdoor.


I ran into the bathroom where Peter had begun his transformation. Tattered clothes and blood littered the area. I found his jeans - well, parts of his jeans - and searched through damp pockets. My treasure hunt was successful.


I held the key up high like a mighty scepter. All I had to do now was unlock the backdoor and gather everyone through it. From there we could climb onto the roof and wait this thing out. We could spy on the creatures from above and stay quiet. My plan was fool-proof.


What I didn’t expect was that all the commotion going on alerted the people in the kitchen. They found the front door busted open. No creatures were in sight. No sounds were audible. To them, it appeared the coast was clear to make a break for it.


It was like watching something in slow motion when they left the safety of the kitchen. I spotted Penny first. He leaped over the broken door and made a break for his car. Wendy was behind him, sprinting toward her own car in the hopes that once she was inside it she was safe. Then there was Toast, who tripped on some glass and landed squarely on his ass right outside the diner.


I yelled out for them to return but my screams were muffled by a pair of harsh howls. I saw two dark shapes maneuver around the parked cars and interrupt my coworkers’ getaways. Claws tore through flesh. Teeth ripped bone. Tongues lapped up blood.


I witnessed both creatures turn their attention to Toast, who was still sitting and sobbing, as I unlocked the backdoor. Toast had lost his mind in the ongoing situation. He lifted his hands in subservience, mumbling incoherent wishes for these beasts to take away all his pain. He begged those gods of the night to end his suffering.


The screams I heard as I exited the building was enough evidence to know they answered his prayers.


My escape was quiet but my run to the wall ladder was not. I tripped over a cardboard box, then slipped on some grease leaking out of a garbage can. Once I found the ladder I conquered the rungs as fast as possible.


But they were so damn fast.


In an instant they were around the corner and lunged for my legs. The bigger one missed but Peter’s teeth grazed one of my calf muscles. I yelled in pain but kept moving up. My hands felt the cold rooftop and I hoisted myself over the roof ledge. I risked a peek over the edge to find the creatures were more intelligent than I’d believed.


They were attempting to climb the fucking ladder!


I aimed the pistol, eyed the sight, switched off the safety . . . and fired a round.


The big one toppled over, a gory hole in the center of its skull. Its death did nothing to hinder Peter’s ascent. Long claws gripped the rungs in cumbersome ways as he made his way to me. I fired a shot at Peter, my boyfriend, the man I loved.


It struck his shoulder but didn’t stop his progress.


Now he was within striking distance of me so I squirmed back to the far edge of the roof. A pair of furry ears sprouted above the ledge and I let off another round. Then another.


Peter continued.


I noticed how dark it had become outside. The once brilliant full moon was slipping past the horizon. Peter was nothing but a monstrous silhouette as he planted his paws on the roof. He no longer stayed on all fours but erected himself to his hind legs.


He charged.


I fired what remained of the bullets to the mass of motion and violence charging at me. Once the gun stopped firing, the magazine empty, I closed my eyes and waited for my death.

“Obviously, you didn’t die,” Detective Hartwig said. “What happened?”


Detective Cable looked at the documents in the folder. “Your original testimony says that when you opened your eyes you found Peter. Dead. He was shot in the shoulder, the chest, and the head.”


I nodded. “Yes. Peter was on the roof with me. Human Peter.”


The detectives traded glances. I knew they didn’t believe me. Just like the other police officers who arrived after the sun came up that day in 1987. Neighbors had heard the gunshots and called them. They arrived at a scene of carnage. A hundred explanations were presented, none of them similar to my story about what ACTUALLY happened. There must have been some kind of cover up. I shouldn’t have expected anything differently.


“What about the farmer?” Hartwig asked.


“Richard Bowler,” I answered. “He’d been missing from his home that night, according to his wife. She said he had been bitten by a large dog a few weeks prior. He was the bigger creature that originally bit Peter. After I shot him, he returned to human form.”


“Human form. Right.” Cable rolled his eyes.


Hartwig offered a fake smile. “You’ve been very helpful, Grace.”


The men gathered their folder and stood up from the table. It was clear they thought I was insane or outright lying. I wish I had been lying. My life would be so much different had I not gone into work that day.


Hartwig gave me his card. “We’re leading the investigation into the three missing people here in Edwards. If you remember anything else don’t hesitate to call.”


I took the card and nodded, knowing I would never call. There was plenty of information I could have told them that they didn't know. Like how I knew exactly what happened to the missing people. Like how careful I’d been all these years only to slip up over the last three months.


“If I remember anything I’ll definitely give you a call. Thanks, officers. I hope you find what you’re looking for.”


As they left the diner I felt an itch on my calf. I scratched the spot where Peter had bitten me all those years ago. Even in his altered state, Peter had left me with a gift so remarkable I’ve had to hide it from the world. Normally, I like to hunt in different states a thousand miles away from Mississippi, but recently I’ve been lazy. Prowling Edwards was a stupid idea and I’d have to be smarter from now on.


The next full moon is in two weeks. I haven’t decided where I should hunt next.
