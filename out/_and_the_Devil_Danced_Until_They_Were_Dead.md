The following is a true story, now whether or not you decide to believe in the supernatural aspect of this story is up to you, but the main plot point of this story truly occurred, and I'm sure with a little digging, archival news articles about the event could be found. This story was told to me by a friend of mine who I'll call Bren, and was confirmed to be true by my grandfather who was alive at the time it took place.

Our story takes place in rural Newfoundland in a small community called Perry's Cove, during the 1960s. There was this family of 8, whom I'll call the Smith's (Not their actual name) . There was the husband, wife and their 6 children living in this two story biscuit box style house on the hill. They were generally good people, well liked among their peers, and a church going crowd as well. They were a poor family and the father and sons worked hard to keep the family going, however, they could not afford electricity. They got their heat from a fireplace, and their lighting from candles and kerosene lamps.

One cool, calm night, not much wind, no cloud cover, stars out and glimmering across the sky, the Smith house, with all 8 occupants inside asleep, mysteriously caught fire. The fire spread quickly and seemed to engulf the entire home in a matter of mere minutes. The house was very old and made from primarily old, dried wood, and also had wooden cedar shingles. It wasn't long before the fire caught the attention of the townsfolk. All the men from Perry's Cove rushed to the scene to try and assist, but it was no use. The fire was too large and burning too hot for buckets of water to make any difference.

The closest fire department with trucks was the Harbour Grace Volunteer Fire Brigade, which at the time would most like have been a 30 - 45 minute drive. Regardless, the fire Department was called and the people of Perry's Cove could only look on in horror as the house burned with 8 people inside. It is said that the men standing and watching could hear screams of terror coming from the house, begging for someone to save them. It went on and on. Those on the ground all testified that they looked up and saw what looked like the Devil himself dancing on the roof, cackling and laughing as the occupants of the house burned alive. He danced on the roof until the screaming stopped, then he jumped into the air and took off into the night.

Once the fire department arrived, the house was too far gone to save, and it burned to the ground and left only a pile of ash. Afterwards, there was an investigation, and the investigators could not find the source of the fire. They said the house burned too hot, spread too quickly, and fell to the crowd so fast, that it was impossible to find the source of ignition. 

The above is a true story, and the entire Smith family perished that night. Hold your loved ones tight, tell them that you love them, because you may not live to see tomorrow. RIP to the Smith family, and Merry Christmas/Happy Holidays to all.
