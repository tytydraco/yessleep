Only that I was sucker punched by one of those ogres, turning my world black. I had that salty, metallic taste in my mouth and my head felt like someone had used it for batting practice with a sack of bricks. When the world swam back into focus, I was tied to a damp metal pipe, rough rope digging into my wrists.



The pounding wasn't just in my head, it was external. There was music, but only the bowel loosening rumble was making its way down here.



Maya was across from me, similarly bound, her eyes spitting fire. The air was thick with incense, that sickly-sweet rot smell, and the thudding bass of Aetheric Echoes’ final set vibrating through the ceiling. It felt like we were in the guts of the festival, directly beneath the giant Ember Heart effigy.



And Eddy… God, Eddy. He was strapped to a crude wooden frame, facing a rough altar. He was barely recognizable. The dark, bark-like growth had consumed most of his right side like a body cast of soggy bark, split open in various spots to allow spongy polyps and various plant nubs to poke through. And where there wasn't bark, there was grotesque, pulsing nodules that now covered his skin and wept a thin, oily black fluid. He was making a low, continuous moaning sound, like wind whistling through a cracked tomb.



"A pity you chose the path of… interference," Silas said, their voice cutting through my stupor and jolting me awake.



Oh yeah … *this* guy.



They were decked out in full ceremonial gear, robes embroidered with golden spirals, flanked by several other equally creepy *Elders*. Silas poked a small, wickedly sharp obsidian knife into my stomach - not cutting me, but I could feel the danger behind it. "Such a vivid life force. Wasted." They then gestured to Eddy. "Our Eduardo, however, was most receptive. He will achieve his true path shortly, his essence feeding the Ember Heart, ensuring the festival’s energy revitalizes our sacred purpose."



One of the Elders, a withered woman with eyes that seemed to suck the light from the room, presented Silas with a steaming ceremonial goblet. "The sacred offering is prepared, *Voice of the Bloom*," she rasped. "The essence of joyful surrender, to share in the communion."



Silas took the goblet and for just a moment, peered into it, looked up at me with a wry grin as if about to say something, then took a deep, theatrical sip. A small wet tendril of red seeping from the corner of his mouth. A wave of nausea hit me.



Beneath the incense and the earthy decay, a new scent had crept into the air, carried on a draft from a nearby alcove where other cultists were reverently consuming something from a clay bowl they passed around – a thick, dark, steaming *stew* of some kind. The aroma was faint, almost imperceptible under the stronger odors, but I knew it - where had I smelled it before?



Silas drifted closer to me. Their voice was a silken caress that made my skin crawl. "So much… unexpected fire beneath that charmingly simple exterior."



"Yeah, well," I mumbled, testing the ropes subtly, "some of us are multi-talented. You should see my macramé."



Silas leaned in, a flicker of amusement in their obsidian eyes. "What was that, dear one? Speak up. Share your wit with the congregation." Their face was inches from mine.



I couldn't believe that worked.



With a grunt, I snapped my head forward, putting every bit of frustration, fear, and fury into it. My forehead connected with Silas’s nose with a sickening crunch.



Silas shrieked, stumbling back, hands flying to their face. The black knife clattered from their grasp, skittering across the stone floor.



"Maya!" I yelled, craning my neck. "Three o'clock!"



Without a second thought, I kicked out, my boot connecting with the knife, sending it spinning towards where Maya was tied.



Things happened fast then. Silas was still reeling, blood streaming from their nose. I doubt they'd ever felt pain their whole life, so this was probably a shock. One of the cave troll cultists lunged for me from across the room. I twisted, and the ropes gave a little. Maya, meanwhile, had managed to snag the knife with her foot, contorting her body to saw at her bonds.



The cultist grabbed my arm but I was ready this time. Adrenaline surged. I don’t know, maybe it’s all those years of lugging equipment on construction sites, or maybe I’d just had enough. I roared and thrashed, and the old ropes, weakened by my earlier struggles, snapped.



I was free. The cultist stared in surprise for a split second before I decked him. I’m no pro fighter. I watch wrestling, sure. I punch the heavy bag at the gym sometimes to blow off steam. I’m not great, but I was pretty sure I was better than these vape-huffing weirdos. He went down with a surprised grunt.



Across the chamber, Maya was also free. And she’d gone… feral. Like a cornered animal. Eyes wide, teeth bared, she brandished the obsidian knife, a primal scream tearing from her throat. Two robed figures who had been advancing on Eddy froze, clearly not expecting this level of *goblin mode* from the quiet photographer. Maya didn't hesitate. She launched herself at them, a whirlwind of desperate fury, slashing and jabbing. They stumbled back, yelping. She wasn't aiming to kill, just to create chaos, to get to Eddy. And it was working. She cut the ropes holding Eddy to the frame, and he slumped forward, moaning.



I took down another robed nerd who tried to intercept me, a sloppy right hook connecting with his jaw. "Stay down, Gandalf!" I panted, then scrambled towards Maya and Eddy.



"We gotta go!" Maya yelled, trying to support Eddy, who was dead weight, his body rigid and uncooperative.



"Defilers!" Silas’s voice, raw with pain and rage, cut through the din. Blood was smeared across their face, their serene mask shattered. "You cannot steal the Bloom’s chosen! He belongs to the Eart—"



Suddenly, the whole chamber shuddered violently. The music from above reached a frenzied, almost unbearable peak. With a deafening crack, a huge wooden support beam, stressed by the vibrations and the age of the tunnels, tore loose from the ceiling. It crashed down between us and Silas, sending up a shower of dust, rock, and splintered wood, effectively cutting them off. 



The whole chamber lit up from the inferno directly above. The burning timber crumbled like a pyroclastic snowfall.



"That’s our cue!" I yelled. "The opening over there! Let’s move!"



Hauling Eddy between us was a nightmare. He was heavy, unresponsive, and the strange, bark-like growths made him awkward to carry. The pustules along his skin would pop with the consistency of rice pudding, making him slippery to keep hold of as well. We half-dragged, half-carried him towards a narrow opening.



Behind the wall of fallen debris and crackling fire, we could hear Silas screaming threats and exhortations to the other cultists. But they couldn’t reach us. And the music was so loud, no one could hear anything above -  all they probably saw was a giant fire pit. 



We squeezed into the shaft, the loose earth and rocks scraping against us. It was a desperate, claustrophobic scramble upwards, towards what we prayed was fresh air. The smell of incense and that sweet, cloying decay still clung to us, but now, mixed with it, was the faintest, almost subliminal trace of another scent. A delicate, floral note. One I vaguely associated with our tent. It was so faint, I almost dismissed it, but it snagged in my memory, unsettling and out of place amidst the chaos.



Just before we reached the surface, I heard Silas, their voice echoing up the tunnel, no longer beautiful, but raw and filled with ancient malice. "The cycle is unbroken! The Bloom always finds its nourishment! Always!"



We burst out into the cool night, off from the main festival grounds, the sky lit by the hellish orange glow of the burning Ember Heart. We didn’t look back. We just ran to my car, dragging Eddy with us, the sounds of the ecstatic, oblivious crowd a terrifying counterpoint to our escape.



The glow of the festival grounds, and smoke from the burning effigy slowly vanished in my rearview mirror.



Months later, the physical scars are mostly gone. The mental ones? They’re dug in deep. Emberbloom was lauded in indie magazines as a "transcendent experience." Aetheric Echoes announced a hiatus shortly after, Silas citing "the need for deep spiritual replenishment after such an intense outpouring of communal energy." No one questioned it.



A few *missing persons* reports were filed – drifters, runaways. Chloe’s parents were gutted their daughter didn't say any goodbyes, but the official story was that she just "embraced a nomadic lifestyle. Like some Grateful Dead groupie." We knew, or at least suspected, a truth far more horrifying, a truth hinted at by a phantom scent and a cryptic, possessive phrase about "becoming our communion" that Silas had uttered, something I only pieced together later with a sickening lurch in my stomach. But there was no proof. Nothing but our fractured memories and a shared, unspoken dread.



Eddy is… well, he’s with us. Physically. He’s in a specialized clinic. The doctors use words like "unprecedented fungal colonization" and "extreme lignification." The bark-like shell has spread. He doesn’t speak. He barely moves. But sometimes, if a particular song is playing, or if the wind rustles the leaves outside his window in a certain way, a thin, sweetish, dark sap weeps from the fungal blooms that cover him. It’s like some part of him is still trying to resonate with… something.



Maya is quieter now. She still takes photos, but mostly of stark landscapes, empty rooms. The vibrant colors of life seem to have muted for her.



I went back to my construction job, back to my classes. I try to be the guy I was. But sometimes, in the quiet of the night, I’ll catch a very faint, floral scent on the breeze, something that shouldn’t be there. And I’ll remember the humid, musty air of those tunnels, and Silas’s voice.



"The Bloom always finds its nourishment."



And I find myself looking over my shoulder, wondering what seeds were planted at Emberbloom, and where they might choose to sprout next.
