josh woke the boys up at the crack of dawn, preparing them as if they were about to go to war. he was so loud so the rest of us were up not long after, i swear i wanted to punch him in his face. after he saw the rest of us up, he asked us to look around for things to use as a weapon. we’re in a fucking high school, does he honestly think we’ll find anything useful? maybe in a college, but not here. though, i did find a sharp ass pair of scissors. leena found a baseball bat, and cage let zayn use his pocket knife he just casually had on him the whole time - why did nobody question this ? i have no clue. i gave, more or less, josh the scissors i found after travis asked lee for the bat and the boys were off. as soon as they stepped out the door i started looking for a weapon of my own, i just felt defenseless. maybe that comment josh made last night got to me just a little bit. i managed to get ahold of another pair of scissors, i felt save ish for the moment. 

that moment didn’t last long when a terrifying scream was heard from the hallway. cage and i had the same idea as we both bolted for the door. i had my scissors in hand, but he didn’t have anything from what i could tell. “this way.” he said, pointing to the left hallway. i didn’t have time to think, i just listened to him. we rounded another corner to see the boys and a bunch of the…sick. i recognized one as a girl in my history class, we didn’t talk much but she was fun when class wasn’t. she was only 15. 

“help us!” josh yelled, right before he stabbed the girl in her shoulder. he just stabbed her. just like that. but, she didn’t even seem fazed. she kept trying to bite his face off. cage looked at me, almost worried. i looked ahead, gripping the scissors. i couldn’t believe what i was about to do, but growing up in the household i did i knew what to do. i knew, kind of, what these…things were. i jogged up to the nearest one, which happened to be the one that somehow was winning against travis. his bat was on the floor beside him, i dropped the scissors and picked the bat up. i whispered and ‘i’m sorry’ before striking the oozing woman in the head, knocking her back onto the floor. i grabbed the scissors once more then climbed on top of her, before stabbing the scissors in her left eye. 

i slid the scissors to travis, silently telling him the bat was mine. he didn’t seem to have an issue with it because he just stood up with the scissors in his hand. the others had already taken care of the other…things. josh threw a hissy fit that i came out, saying once more that i was small and didn’t do anything anyway. but, thankfully, travis and cage both shut up him but tell them that i went ‘psycho mode’ on the english teacher. 

josh didn’t say anything about the subject after that, he just told us that if we wanted to go to the cafeteria with them we could. i wanted to stay, cage went back, and so did travis because he’d been scratched real bad. as much as i hated josh, i was still starving. plus i have a feeling i’ll find a better weapon somewhere in the kitchen. josh somehow got the impression i wanted to have a conversation with him, and started talking. 

“did you really hit ms. andrew in the head?” i rolled my eyes, “what? you think i’m weak just because i’m half your size?” he just ignored me and kept walking, so i did the same thing. as we walked past the nurses office i called out for the boys to stop walking. “make sure you guys grab more weapons, anything at all that could be useful. i’m gonna get some meds for travis.” they agreed, saying to just go back to the library when i was done. 

when i walked in, the first thing i saw was ms. c, she was on the floor covered in blood, and there was a huge wound on her stomach. it smelled horrible in there. i felt bad. i covered my nose and mouth with the sleeve of my hoodie before grabbing the teal bag ms. c always had with her. most of the stuff in there i kept out, but i found a water bottle and her car keys. i kept the water bottle in there, but stuffed the keys in my pocket. 

i rummaged around the main room first, finding a loads of stuff - mostly bandages and stuff to clean a wound, plus some antibiotics. no painkillers though, i didn’t expect it but it’s nice to dream. i grabbed the pillows and blankets from the cots, there were four of each. it’s not much but it’ll do for some of us. i opened the door to the examination room, id been in this room a number of times and i know for sure there’s got to be some good painkillers in here. this is where they kept the meds kids’ parents approved of. i moved as quickly as possible getting every single bottle of pills, plus a few asthma pumps and epipens. then more bandages, and stuff like that. with all of this stuff, travis would definitely be okay. hopefully. 

the bag was nearly full, but there was one more room. the office. i always suspected the second nurse to be drunk or high or something during the school day, maybe she has some good stuff in there. without thinking, i opened the office door. the second nurse, whom i never cared to learn the name of, was in there. and she looked just like the rest of them. green. she came running full force, thinking she was getting her next meal. once again, not thinking, just acting, i dropped the bag on the ground and lifted the bag up just in time. i swung it before she could get within a foot of me, thank god. i accidentally broke some things on the shelf, but i don’t think the nurses care now. 

i quickly looked around the room, grabbing anything useful. i tried not to look at the nurse on the ground, it would’ve made it all too real. but as i was walking out i almost tripped and i had to look down, thank god i did. on the floor beside her were a set of keys, while looking through the room i’d found a safe. i grabbed the keys and tested them all on the safe until finally one worked, and i found the greatest thing of all time. besides some now useless cash, besides maybe as tinder on a fire, there was a pretty dagger. i obviously grabbed it, putting it between my belt. 

when i walked back into the library, leena was crying and freaking out, yelling to about travis. i asked her what was wrong and she said travis wasn’t doing too good. i have the bag to leena, i remember her mentioning her mother was a nurse so i figured she’d know the most about this stuff. 

i’ve been posting my notes to reddit, as for some reason it’s only app that works on my phone. not even facebook works. please, if anyone is reading this and you think you might have some clue about what’s going on, enlighten me. some good news would be great right about now. i have to stop writing now, travis sounds like he’s going through hell and he’s asking for me.
