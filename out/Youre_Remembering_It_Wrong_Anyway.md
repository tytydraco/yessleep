I fell asleep at 1:30 PM. Just a nap. Nothing heavy on my mind — no trauma, no movie I shouldn’t have watched. Just me, sinking into a sleep I didn’t even expect to remember.

But then I was in the middle of it.

Not a dream. A scene.

Me. My younger brother. My sister.
We were sitting at a table, eating something I can’t recall. The food didn’t taste like anything. I don’t remember chewing. I just remember the glow of the TV and the strange silence between bites.

Then suddenly, no one was there but me and my brother.

I said something meaningless to him — some casual thing. Then I shouted. I don’t know why. It wasn’t real anger. It felt triggered, like a reflex I didn’t control.

And just like that, his body gave out.


He didn’t fall naturally. He crumpled — like something inside him had stopped functioning all at once.
His eyes turned red, then puffed, then leaked blood.
From his mouth too. It poured slowly, like thick syrup.
No scream. No collapse. Just a quiet shatter, like a glass child breaking in reverse.

He slumped into the corner of the room — maybe a bed, maybe a couch, I don’t know anymore. Everything around him blurred like the world had softened.

I picked him up in my arms.

He weighed nothing.
His body felt cold. Not like death — but like something unfinished.


I shouted for my parents.

They came down slowly from the stairs — both standing, both dressed like they’d been frozen in place for years. Their eyes were open. Their lips moved.

But they didn’t see him.

> “The kitchen light keeps flickering again,” my dad said, looking past me.


> “Did you bring in the milk?” asked my mom.


I was holding my brother. Bleeding. Barely moving.

And they asked about groceries.


I screamed. I cussed. I told them he was dying.

They blinked and nodded.

But still—no reaction.

I turned to leave. I don’t remember opening a door.
Suddenly I was outside, running toward the hospital.


There were two paths:
One short and clear, the other long and winding.
someone behind me–told me that short one was blocked, due to some religious gathering. 

> “Just take the other way,” they said.
“The other one is blocked, and somehow we have to come back the other way only.”

But I wasn’t in a state to compare anything or even listen. I took it anyway.While taking the route, I kept telling him—you’re gonna be fine, you’re okay, over and over. I was murmuring it in his ear, frantic, my voice breaking. I was shouting—talk to me, dammit, say something! I kept shaking him, begging—open your eyes, please, just look at me, just once! He was right there, just there—and slipping.
I felt my menage behind me murmuring about something, Nothing blocked me. But when the path ended... I felt he wasn’t conscious anymore.

After goes past some flickering long yellow street lights, was standing at the hospital doors.
Just there.

---

Inside was quiet.
Unnaturally quiet.

The nurse didn’t ask questions. She looked at my brother once, nodded, and said,

> “Sepsis. Surface bleeding. Might be mnemonic syndrome.”


She took him behind a curtain.

I never saw him again.


Then my family appeared again.

They were sitting in the waiting room, whispering to each other.

> “Do frogs know they’re real?”
“What if eyes are just mirrors the brain holds?”
“He should’ve taken the long path, you know.”


They weren’t talking to each other. They were talking past each other — like badly programmed robots trying to imitate a conversation.
I was infuriated about the conversation,...but I couldn’t say anything. 


I tried to explain to the doctor — really explain — what happened. From the start.

She didn’t blink.

 “Might be too late to reverse it,” she said.
“If the memories were exposed directly, we can only suppress the effects.”


Suppress? Suppress what?

My voice cracked. My legs shook. I asked if my brother was okay.

She just repeated:

 “We’ll suppress the symptoms. The patient can’t re-experience the origin event.”

I didn’t know what that meant.

Then I looked at my family again,

Their face didn’t register. Their clothes were familiar, but off. They looked at me.
And smiled.

I woke up at 2:13 PM, eyes wet, mouth dry, chest pounding.

My brother is in the next room right now. I think. He just came back to school. I heard the belI, heard his voice earlier.

But I haven’t seen him since I woke up.

Every time I try to find him, someone in my family pulls me aside and says,

> “Just let him rest. You’re remembering it wrong anyway.”

But the food is still on the table.
Untouched.
And someone left the hospital band on the kitchen counter.

It says:

> Patient: NULL.
Symptoms: Unconfirmed.
Status: With Family.
