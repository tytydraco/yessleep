When I was a teenager, I was a member of the Boy Scouts of America. Fun, right? A cute little club for boys to learn how to be good citizens and become friends. Yeah… no. The scouts was a cesspool of some of the worst individuals in the world, committing casual social and legal taboos on a daily basis. Anything you’ve heard from survivors of the organization is true.  I remember my first meeting I went to, I found myself hog tied and dragged through the mud in an initiation ritual, an action which had gone completely unpunished. I believe now they are a lot more strict with hazing, probably someone sued, but back when I was there, we ran wild. You know when you start talking about fond memories of your childhood with someone who wasn’t there, and all you’re met with is a blank stare or a look of complete horror? Yeah, every single story is met with that. The thing is, there’s one story that I haven’t yet told. Never, because I’m worried that if this gets out I’ll be locked up in some looney bin. Because it really makes no sense logically, and if I were to hear it from someone else, I’d ask what they were on and where they got it. But it is becoming more and more pressing that the world hears my story. 



I am one of two survivors of a massacre at a Summer Camp, one that no one has ever heard of. 



The year was 2004. I was 15, tall, lanky, smelled weird. You know, a teenage boy. I had just gone through a growth spurt that winter, so none of my summer clothes fit me right. I ended up with a couple of accidental crop tops, which, if you weren’t aware, was not a good look to have when surrounded by teenagers. Boy Scout summer camps were a place to knock out merit badges you didn’t feel like working for outside of a fixed environment. They ran like school, with designated class times, lunch times, etc. Structure that was needed for these bunch of kids. However, there was the added freedom of autonomy. Nobody cared if you didn’t go to your merit badge classes. Nobody cared if you stayed up all night playing cards and listening to soft rock on a shitty battery radio. That was the real reason we went. Not the soft rock, but the freedom. The only rules were as such:



1. Before breakfast and after dinner, you must meet at the flag poles for colors. Dinner you must be in uniform.
2. Buddy system. Self explanatory
3. Attendance at the firepit was mandatory, in full uniform.



That last one was only the first and last night. Otherwise, the world was our oyster. On the drive up we were split into 4 cars, two per patrol. We weren’t made of money like some troops were, we didn’t have our own bus, nor were we able to rent a van. It was shocking how rich some troops are. 652 showed up in a fully decked out school bus, complete with their name painted on the side. In my car, there was me and Randy, we came in at the same time and were always grouped together. I grew up with him through the cub scouts and into the boy scouts, so naturally we became close. Zach, a short Filipino kid, and Paolo, but we just called him Pao. He was this really edgy kid, one of those kids who wore black sweatshirts in the middle of a heatwave, black hair covering his eyes, we thought he was the peak of cool. Both were a year younger than us. We got stuck in Zach’s dad’s car, Mr. Ramos. We had convinced him to blast the beastie boys all the way down the 7 hour drive from our home town to Camp Anawaki. Half way down, we had decided that the name “Camp Anawaki” was a completely made up bullshit word, and laughed at how stupid it was. Randy said it sounded like a star wars concentration camp, which made sense for our sense of humor back then. 



We arrive at the camp at 4:30 P.M. Mr. Ramos had long since banned us from our Beastie Boyz concert, most likely due to us almost causing him to crash by Zach suddenly cranking the volume during the chorus of Brass Monkey, which meant all but I was asleep as we pulled into the gravel lot. The camp was mainly a huge open field with a giant log cabin towards the back. Behind the cabin was a forest, with many trails leading back. In fact, the entire field was surrounded by dense forest, aside from a small break that led to the lake. I remember thinking to myself how stereotypical the site looked. How boring. I began to try and wake Randy up, but Mr. Ramos grabbed my attention and put his finger to his lips, pleading for my discretion. I was confused until he pointed at the steering wheel, and smiled. With a sudden and very loud honk, the other three boys had been successfully jolted from their slumber, Zach hitting his dad in the shoulder. Mr. Ramos and I share a short laugh, before we all escape his car and head towards check in. 



We were the last of our troop to arrive, so we approached our designated site as everyone else was almost finished. The site had army tents ready and waiting for our arrival, Randy gravitating towards one on the far end of camp, the opposite end of where the adults had marked their territory. I followed. That’s what usually happened. He would make a decision, and I would follow. I was his side kick, and I had long since accepted that. Zach and Pao’s tent buddies were already at camp, thus they did not get a say in which tent to claim. Zach’s tent buddy, Brady, picked one close to the entrance of the site. Pao’s buddy George picked one by the latrines. Considering he had IBS, this made sense, but still sucked for Pao. We only had one tent near us, with two kids from the younger patrol. Danny and Zeke. Danny was a small kid, black hair, glasses, and the palest skin I've ever seen. Supposedly he was 12, but he looked closer to 10. Zeke was a beefy kid, dorky, a bit mean. Not fat, though we called him fat a lot cause we knew it would set him off, but really he just had a little extra meat on his bones. Randy and I unpacked our belongings, he had brought a shitty radio, and set it up towards the back of the tent. Outside of the tent we set up a table and chairs with the intention of running a card tournament later that night. As we finished, a counselor had arrived to guide us to our swim tests. 



Every year, you had to participate in a test to see whether you were proficient, aka you were allowed to swim in the lake, developing, you had to have an adult with you, and learning, or you around allowed past waist deep water, ever. The lake was unremarkable. A dockhouse sat right on top of the lake containing changing booths, a bathroom, and showers. The dockhouse lead right to the dock. Once changed into my trunks, I meet Randy on the dock. He wastes no time, immediately leaping into the lake. I went to follow, until my eyes met the brown water, stained by the mud below, made it impossible to see if you were swimming alone. That was an eerie thought to me. I considered opting out of the test. Something about the fact that you couldn’t see past your chest once you got all the way in terrified me. I stared at the mucky abyss below me, my brain telling me to jump but my knees were unresponsive. 



“Don’t be a bitch, Hen.” Randy said, point blank. I glance over at him, already fully in and wadding. “It's not that bad. Not even cold. Just get in.” He lied. The water was absolutely freezing in contrast to the 90 degree heat of dry land. 



I hated when he called me that. Hen. Made me feel like a girl. But he insisted on not using my full name. Somehow, “Henry” was too long for him to handle. So I was Hen. To his utter enjoyment, it caught on with the younger kids, and thus their parents. Before long, that’s all anyone ever called me. 



As I began to tread water, I tried my best to ignore the rancid depths below me. My ears muffled, I could still hear laughter and shrieks and whistles and orders, but nothing was clear to me. Breathing was manual, in rhythm with each kick as I tried to keep my mouth above water. I knew I had to start swimming, start moving, but something was stopping me. Something was in there with me, I could sense it. It wasn’t Randy, or any of the other boys. Something else. As this knowledge sunk deeper and deeper into my brain, I could feel something slithering its way around my left leg. I was still frozen- why was I still frozen? I just needed to shake it off of me. The rational part of my brain was screaming for me to just kick it off. It’s probably just some seagrass or stray rope. But I couldn’t move. It slid its slimy tendrils up my leg, snaking itself under my trucks and around my waist. I could feel its gentle pull under water, and I was just letting it happen. First my shoulders, then my neck, my mouth…



A splash of icy water hits me in the face. Trance broken, I start shaking frantically. Unbeknownst to him, Randy had just saved my life by being a dick. Once I settled, I witnessed him belly laughing,forgetting the fact that he needed to stay afloat. On an inhale, he swallowed about a liter of shit water, leaving him choking, and me laughing in return. Prick got what he deserved.



I finished my swim test as fast as possible. Proficient, of course. I had to get out of that water. I left without waiting for the rest of my troop, still frustrated, still shaken. I told him I didn’t want to be called Hen. And I’m not a bitch. The water was fucking disgusting. I was well within my mind to not want to marinate myself in the filth. But, I needed a buddy. I looked up on shore to see if anyone else had finished, and noticed Mr. Ramos and Danny on the shore. Danny was on the floor, hugging his knees with his trunks on but dry. Lucky me, Danny was scared of the water too. Unlike me, he did not have someone barking orders at him. Tear lines stained his face, his eyes swollen. I got the impression this was not the first time he had cried today. I could never show it, but I took pity on the kid. So I grabbed my towel, dried off my feet, and walked up to Mr Ramos trying his best to console the small boy.



“I can take him back, sir.” I assured him.



“You sure? If you want to stay I can take him back-”



“It’s fine. I’m done.” I gave him a small pleading look, and he shook his head in understanding.



“Alright. Class A’s for dinner.” I nodded, and Mr. Ramos walked towards the rest of the boys. Danny didn’t look at me, he just grabbed his towel, got up, and started walking. I got the message, and followed suit. 



“I didn’t like the water either.” We were halfway back to camp and neither of us had said a word yet. It was awkward, I didn’t know how to deal with silence well. “If Randy wasn’t being an asshole, I wouldn’t have even taken the damn test. Stupid anyway, if you can’t swim by the time you get here maybe you shouldn’t have come.”



“I can’t swim.” He said, still not looking at me. Of course he can’t. 



“Oh. Why not?”



“I was never taught. Never any water near my house.” He mumbled. 



“Oh. Then that makes sense.” I can hear him sniffling as he walks ahead of me. He hasn’t looked at me once. “Hey…Um. Are you okay?”



“Fine” He said shortly. 



“You’re crying.”



“I’m not”



“Sounds like you’re crying.”



“I’m not crying!” He whips around to face me. He was crying, but trying as hard as he could to not show it.



“Alright. Sorry man, just trying to help.” 



“Just stop then. I’m fine, I’m not a baby, I can handle myself-” He tripped on a root in the trail, and I hear a snap. I rush over to him, if something breaks while he’s with me I’m fucked. I don’t know shit about first aid, that’s why I was at summer camp. To learn shit like this. 



“SHIT! You okay?” he shoves me off of him.



“I’m fine, it's…damn it.” He lifts up his glasses, one lens now sporting a giant crack down the center. Tears well up again, and I try my best to comfort him.



“He its…its okay dude. It was an accident. I’ll tell them it was an accident.”



“Its not fine! I just got these! Mom said I needed to take care of them cause they’re the last one’s I’m gonna get. Fucking root in the fucking trail god fucking damn it!”



I turn to look at said root, let the counselors know to take care of it. Get it off the trail. But there was no root. There wasn’t anything on the trail. Some disturbed dirt, probably from when he fell, but otherwise a clean trail.



“What root?”



“The fucking root! Right…” Once he saw what I had, his face flushed red. Now he just looked stupid, more than he already had. He said nothing else, just folding his shattered glasses and putting them in his pocket, brushing himself off, and storming up the trail.

We continued the rest of the walk in silence, arriving at camp to change into our Class A’s, and waited in our tents for everyone else to show up. About an hour later, Randy got back.



“I was wondering where you went.” He said, taking off his shirt.



“Danny was scared of the water so I took him back.”



“Yea. Ramos told me. Kid’s a pussy.”



“He’s just scared. He doesn’t know how to swim”



“Yeah. A pussy.” I met him with silence, just rolled over in my cot as he changed his pants. We were boys, yes, but some modesty was required. Plus, I was mad at him and didn’t want to talk anymore.  “Why are you being a dick?”



“I’m not.”

“You are. Icing me out and shit. Get over yourself.”



Just shut up, I thought to myself. “I’m not in the mood right now, man.”



“Whatever.” It was days like this where I wondered why I was friends with him. But my annoyance with my asshole of a best friend would pale in comparison to what would continue during my week at Camp Anawaki.
