**Content warning for animal abuse and self harm.**

^(I’d like to note that what follows is not my own work. A good friend of mine, who for the purposes of her privacy shall be referred to as Trinity, sent four text documents to me with instructions that “the four stages” be distributed over a period of four days, and that I am not to open the documents prior to their appointed posting date. She did not explain the reason for this, simply stating that it was imperative I obey her instructions to the letter, and I swore to her that I would. She thanked me, and I have received no message from her since. All of my subsequent attempts to reach Trinity for further information have been ignored.)

^(The mundane details of this first document do seem largely to conform to what I know about Trinity’s personal life, and I can thus verify their accuracy. Beyond that, I’m afraid I cannot provide an explanation for the more unusual portions of her story.)

It’s their fault. None of this would have happened if it wasn’t for them. I would have been fine. I could have lived out my whole life in peace without ever looking at *it*. But it’s too late to think about that now. There is no undoing what has been done.

Don’t ever get married at 21. I don’t care if you’ve known them for years, I don’t care if you feel like you want to grow old with them, *never*, under any circumstances, give into that impulse, especially if it’s your first real relationship. You’re not old enough to understand what is good for you, and you won’t understand if you’re being abused.

My own ill-advised marriage lasted 3 years before it fell apart, though the warning signs were there long before they slipped a ring on my finger. Their name was Seth, and they possessed just the sort of low cunning necessary to twist a woman like me around their finger. Trans girls freshly out of the closet are an easy target for manipulation. We’re desperate for validation, possess extremely little in the way of self esteem, and are generally very easy to trick into doing anything you want if you deliver a dose of targeted misgendering masked with social justice jargon. Is your wife upset? Clearly she’s behaving aggressively due to her male socialization, you should let her know that sort of behavior makes you feel very afraid. Does your wife have difficulty performing all of the housework in addition to being employed full time to support the both of you? Obviously an example of weaponized male incompetence, she should unlearn that toxic masculine behavior. This sort of thing works especially well if you happen to also be some flavor of gender outlaw. *Trinity, I’m nonbinary, how on Earth could I be transphobic? You saying that sort of thing is just perpetuating lateral violence.*

Needless to say, those 3 years were some of the darkest of my life, to the extent that I passively accepted the terms of the divorce when Seth finally grew tired of me and tossed me aside in favor of a new model, proudly proclaiming that they had managed to move on and heal from their past trauma, but that I simply hadn’t been able to grow with them. They still took my money, of course. It’s my fault really; I should have never agreed to paying alimony. It’s not like it was required given the short length of the union, after all. But they were always very good at convincing me to do whatever they wanted, and they had explained to me that I owed them payment for the years they had spent dealing with the burden of being in a relationship with me.

The alimony agreement was odd, at least that’s the diplomatic way that the clerk put it when I showed her the paperwork. They wanted to have a portion of my monthly income, 25% of it, for a year. The clerk even explained to me that I didn’t have to agree to this sort of thing, that under state law there was no obligation for me to accept it, but my mind was filled with 3 years worth of fine-tuned brainwashing, and she wound up accepting the signed document with a sigh.

It took a few months of talking with my friends about the divorce to even realize that *I* was the one who had been abused. It’s not like I was trying to gain sympathy about it, for a very long time I felt as though everything was my fault, that I had been a terrible wife. But the more I talked about my marriage, the more alarmed my friends and family members would become.

I know this sounds like I’m just complaining about a bad marriage, but it’s necessary in order to understand the context of what has happened to me.

It was exactly a year and a day after the divorce was finalized when my grandmother died. I was incredibly surprised to find that in her will she had listed me as the inheritor of her old house. It made sense, I suppose. My father and aunt both had their own houses at this point, my aunt had no children, and I was an only child. I just wasn’t expecting to become a homeowner at 25.

In addition to the house, she also left me a not insubstantial sum of money, enough at least to rest comfortably for a few months while I settled into my new home. I wound up quitting my job, a dead-end retail position that had long since overstayed its welcome, and moved into the house nearly immediately, getting to work cleaning it up.

If I’m being entirely honest, I wasn’t too fond of the house. It’s not that I had many bad memories there or anything like that. Beyond my grandmother’s descent into some nutty conspiracy theories in her old age, we always managed to get along pretty well. But it was a house that was too large for just one person. It wasn’t a mansion, not by any means, but it had 3 bedrooms, the sort of place you were meant to raise a family in. I converted one of them into an office, used another for storage, slept in the third, but even then, there always felt like there was far too much space. When you live alone in a house that is too big for you, you never feel like you’re actually the only one there, especially at night.

At some point Seth caught wind of my inheritance. I guess they must have heard about it through the grapevine, or stalked one of my social media pages, I don’t really know or care how they found out. All that matters is that they had discovered I’d inherited a large sum of money the exact day after I was no longer required to pay them a portion of my income.

I got the call in the afternoon, as I was looking through some job boards checking to see if there were any openings near me that seemed even slightly more tolerable than unskilled labor or retail drudgery. I saw that it was Seth, and hesitantly picked up the phone, thinking to myself that I should’ve blocked their number a long time ago.

“So when exactly were you going to tell me?” came the voice from the other end of the phone.

“About what?”

“The inheritance. The fact that you own a house now. Real convenient that it happened the day *right after* your alimony ended, isn’t it? You always were a terrible liar.” Their voice was filled with hatred and contempt, the kind of tone you used to talk about cockroaches and maggots.

“Listen, Seth, I’ve paid what you asked me to already, it’s not my fault that this happened the way it did. I’m sorry, but-”

“Don’t lie to me. I want my share. I know you were hiding this from me, and if you don’t give it willingly I’m going to talk to an attorney. Do you understan-”

I hung up the phone. Nearly instantly another call came through. I declined it. I then proceeded to decline 3 more calls and ignore nearly a dozen messages as my phone’s buzzer continually went off during the minute or so that it took to block Seth’s number. I felt a wave of adrenaline washing over me, my heart beating faster, my body convinced that it was in danger. I took some deep breaths. Closing the job board site, I shut my laptop and decided to go for a little walk around the block, leaving my phone behind.

The walk helped to steady my nerves quite a bit, even though my surroundings were simply identical suburban homes and fenced in yards. Just being out in the sun and the warm spring air helped to remind me that I was in the here and now and not back in my marriage. After a few minutes of strolling, I got back home, only to find a fresh source of stress.

Numerous notifications on my phone indicated that someone had been trying to sign into my email, my bank account, and social media profiles. I realized then that I hadn’t changed most of my credentials following the divorce, and remembered that Seth had insisted on knowing my passwords “just in case anything happened.” Fortunately, two factor authentication, ever a thorn in my side, seemed to actually do something useful for once, and the only sites that had been breached were a couple of social media profiles, which had been promptly deleted in an act of petty revenge. I sighed and began getting to work changing all the passwords to my various accounts, as well as putting in requests to have my deleted profiles reinstated.

It was while I was doing all this, which required the use of my email, that I noticed something odd in my inbox. There was a new email, lurking among the numerous “Password Confirmation” messages, simply titled “look at me.” The email address wasn’t one I recognized, a gmail account with a random string of characters for its name. It didn’t have any body text, just a single image attachment. My immediate assumption, of course, was that this was Seth.

Part of me wanted to delete it right away. I wish I did. But instead, motivated by morbid curiosity and anger, I found myself clicking on the email to download the image, which was named *lookatme.png*.

In the past, Seth had an upsetting tendency to hurt themself in front of me whenever they got upset at me, purposefully banging their head against a wall or punching their chest until I intervened, whereupon they would begin to take out their violent impulses on me instead. Once they even cut themself with a kitchen knife in front of me, the blood dripping down onto the stained gray carpet as they screamed at me that I did this to them, that I was so impossibly stupid that they had to do this to make me understand that I was wrong. I don’t even remember what the argument had been about, I just recall the smell of iron and the sight of fresh, red, blood, the sound of insults ringing in my ears.

I assumed that the image would be a picture of Seth hurting themself in some way. If it was, I had some half-baked idea of contacting a lawyer and getting some sort of restraining order set up against them. I braced myself for the worst, and opened *lookatme.png.*

When the photos program launched, however, it wasn’t what I was expecting whatsoever. In fact, I couldn’t even tell what exactly it was that I was looking at. It was a very dark image, so dark I could barely make out anything at all, just vague shapes in a field of shadow. Pressing the “edit photo” button, I began to fiddle with the contrast, shadows, and brightness settings to try and get a look at what was there.

As I messed around with the image settings, a shape began to emerge out of the mass of darkness. It was still too dark to make out exactly, but it was recognizable vaguely as a face of some sort, cocked at an extreme angle and facing the camera. The eyes were too shadowed to make out, and long, dark hair covered most of the face, but I could tell vaguely that the mouth was stretched into something almost resembling a smile. There was something subtly familiar with the proportions of the face, but as I started to try and further lower the contrast to get a better look, the screen suddenly went completely black. I could hear my PC’s fans turn on at full speed, and smelled the scent of hot plastic that comes when you push a computer’s processing power to the limit. Panicking, I pressed down hard on the power button until the fans stopped.

Rebooting my computer, I sat there with bated breath, silently praying that whatever I’d downloaded hadn’t completely wiped my PC or locked me behind ransomware. The log in screen came up as usual, and I let out a sigh of relief that there wasn’t any obvious sign of damage when the desktop loaded up normally. I checked the downloads folder to go and delete *lookatme.png*, but it wasn’t there. Similarly, a peek into my email inbox revealed nothing unusual either. I was still convinced that it had been some sort of malware, so I performed a routine scan with my antivirus, but everything turned up normal. It was as if nothing had happened.

For the rest of that day, everything did seem more or less ordinary. I made dinner, read a little bit, and then spent a few hours watching mindless videos on the internet before heading off to sleep finally at a frankly irresponsible hour of the night. I was still upset, of course, over Seth’s attempts to break into my accounts, my deleted social media profiles, and the strange image that, at the time, I assumed had been sent in an attempt to unnerve me. Seth knew I was a very paranoid person, and it seemed in character for them to send me a disturbing image that would mysteriously vanish after crashing my PC. I wasn’t quite sure how they could have pulled it off, as Seth never was particularly technically competent, but at the time I had no doubts that it had some sort of conventional explanation.

The morning after my downloading of *lookatme.png* began with me checking my email to see if my deleted social media profiles had been restored. Unfortunately, there was no such luck. Grumpily tossing aside my phone, I got up to make myself some breakfast.

I knew that I was running low on food, as my next scheduled grocery run was set for the next day, so I decided I would make some steamed white rice with sausages as my breakfast. Not exactly a conventional meal to start off the day, but food is food, and I hadn’t yet opened the fresh bag of rice I’d purchased last week. I opened up the pantry and reached for the bag, but stopped short just before I could grasp it. The canvas sack was squirming slightly, and I could hear faint rustling sounds coming from inside. There didn’t seem to be any holes or tears in the canvas for something to have gotten in, and I felt slightly nauseous watching the faint writhing through the cloth. Cautiously, I opened the bag, bracing myself. I was greeted with a mass of dirty white fur and dozens of beady red eyes, worm-like tails whipping around in confusion.

Rats.

As soon as the bag was opened, they poured out in a torrent, a tide of fur and scrabbling claws squeaking as one as I shrieked in surprise and disgust. Several of them seemed to be badly wounded, having seemingly started fighting one another after their confinement in the sack, leaving bloody and eerily human-like footprints on the wooden floor. I felt myself hyperventilating as I tried desperately to keep them away from me.

I spent the next several hours catching every single rat that I could find, putting them in a large plastic storage tub that I had hastily emptied and made into a makeshift cage. I picked them up by their tails, skin crawling as the vermin tried to bite at me through my gardening gloves. Even after I couldn’t find any more of them, I still spent a long time searching every nook and cranny in the house, desperate to make sure that all of them were gone.

I didn’t bother eating breakfast. Or lunch for that matter. I’d woken up at around 10:30, and the unpleasant surprise in the pantry had utterly and completely ruined any appetite I may have otherwise had, especially after I found what remained in the canvas rice bag.

There were a handful of infant rats, “pinkies” as they’re commonly referred to. They all showed signs of having been cannibalized by their elders. A couple were still half-alive, and I put them out of their misery as humanely as I could, before taking the adults to animal control.

I remember when I first learned to hate rats. You see, Seth kept a large number of snakes. By the time of the divorce, there must have been dozens of the things. Ball pythons mainly. They had explained to me that different colorations and patterns of pythons could be sold for huge sums of money, and ultimately planned on breeding them as a primary source of income, something which never came to fruition for as long as we were together. In order to pursue this dream of financial stability, they had insisted that most of our spare cash go towards the purchasing of suitable breeding stock. However, there was a slight issue; a single income meant that buying frozen rodents for the snakes’ food wasn’t economically viable. As a solution, they had insisted on raising live rats as well.

Unlike their scaly executioners, the rats multiplied extremely quickly, and we were frequently inundated with a large supply of the vermin, their huddled masses swelling to fill the cramped cages. No matter how many culls Seth carried out, there were always too many. I was responsible for feeding them and cleaning their cage, something I wasn’t particularly fond of, but had agreed to do in order to keep Seth happy. One evening when I was feeding them, one of them bit me. I pulled my hand back reflexively, but this had accidentally knocked their cage to the ground, and in an instant dozens of the things were scrambling to escape. I wasn’t able to get any sleep that night, with Seth demanding that I take care of the problem I had caused while they went to bed, locking the bedroom door behind them. To make matters worse, we had a cat at the time, and I wasn’t able to successfully lock him up in the bathroom before he’d managed to catch and disembowel a handful of the smaller escaped rodents, leaving their entrails strewn about the living room of our apartment.

Anyway, perhaps understandably, my encounter with the rats in the pantry left me something of a nervous wreck for the remainder of the day, periodically checking all around the house over and over to make sure that not a single remaining one of the vermin was left, jumping at every single perceived movement. Everything felt filthy, contaminated, as though the rats had rubbed their greasy bodies against every surface in the house. Whenever I thought about that horde of squealing things emerging out of the sack, I’d wind up needing to wash my hands to feel clean again. I couldn’t recall a time in recent memory that my obsessive compulsive disorder had been triggered this badly.

I wound up taking a shower, just to try and relieve as much of my contamination anxiety as possible. As soon as I stepped foot into the hot, flowing water, I could feel my shoulders untense, and I let out a deep breath that I didn’t realize I had been holding in. The calming steam combined with the purifying, sterile odor of soap helped to steady my nerves considerably.

It was as I was rinsing off that the lights suddenly went out. I was understandably startled, but not too shocked, I’d known that the house had some faulty wiring. Blackouts like these typically only lasted a few seconds. However, whatever electrical issues were affecting the lights had clearly interfered with the water heater as well, and I found myself flailing to get out of the range of the suddenly ice cold water. As I backed up to try and get away, however, I felt something sharp rake against my back.

It was difficult to hear over the rushing water and the beating of my own heart, but I could have sworn I heard rattling breathing right by my ear.

I’m not ashamed to admit that I screamed out of a mixture of pain and terror, tripping on the slick surface of the shower floor and banging my shoulder quite painfully. A second afterwards, the lights turned back on. I looked about frantically, trying to catch sight of the intruder, but I was alone in the bathroom. My body ached, and adrenaline pumped through my veins like rocket fuel. As I took deep breaths to calm myself down, I watched the water spiral down the drain of the shower, tinged slightly pink. I touched a hand to my back and it came back stained red with blood.

I did eventually manage to calm down enough to prepare dinner at least, though with considerable difficulty. I felt exhausted and tired, the mental strain leading me to decide to head to bed early. I tried to chalk up my injury in the shower to stress, lying to myself that the four slash marks I’d found on my back must have simply been inflicted during my fall. I tried not to think about how there were no possible sharp objects in the shower that could have caused this. It wasn’t very convincing, but it was the only rational explanation, and contemplating any other potential source made my head spin. I knew that even with my exhaustion I wouldn’t be able to effectively get to sleep without outside assistance, and decided to take a combination of diphenhydramine and melatonin supplements to help ease me into unconsciousness. I took the pills with dinner, so that by the time I was finished I would have no choice but to go to sleep.

After lazily dumping my dirty dishes into the sink, I stumbled into my bedroom, shutting and locking the door with a reassuring click. I clumsily changed into pajamas and slipped into bed before turning off the bedside lamp. The cocktail of sleep aids didn’t leave me with much capacity to focus on anything stressful, and fairly soon I was in that pleasant state of half awake near-sleep that precedes dreaming, only dimly aware of where I was. Even still, the dosage I had taken wasn’t anywhere near enough to induce hallucinations, nor was I yet unconscious.

In the foggy, rapidly dissipating remnants of my consciousness, I became dimly aware of a noise coming from close by. I turned my head slightly, half-lidded eyes receiving the dull image of my bedroom, faintly illuminated by the moonlight. My bedroom door was open, an image that I was sure must have meant something in waking, but which my fatigued mind was incapable of understanding the significance of. As my eyelids slowly drifted shut and I fell into a blissful sleep, I could faintly discern something large and pale crawling past the doorway on all fours.
