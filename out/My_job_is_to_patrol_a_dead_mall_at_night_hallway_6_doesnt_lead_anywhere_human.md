Okay so listen. I working night as security in this dead shopping mall, you know, like they shut it down but not completly. They gonna turn it to office or storage something like that. My job is just walk around and see nothing crazy happen, just doors locked, no squatters inside, you know. Easy work. I can listen music and walk slow with flashlight. Nobody bother me.

So first nights, is totally normal. Bit boring actually. Just me walking in cold and some echo. But then, third night, I see something weird.

A hallway

It was next to Pretzel Palace but like... it was not there before. I’m pretty sure. It have sign that say “Hallway 6” but there is no Hallway 6 in map I have. I look at map again and again, nothing there. But I also see behind paper someone write with pen:

don’t go in Hallway 6
tell manager if you see

So I think okay, haha, funny prank maybe, from old guard. Or maybe it’s storage space they open. But the hallway? It don’t look normal. The lights is like too long? Like stretched? And the air inside feel strange like... no air moving but still cold?

And it play music

Old music from the mall, very old, like when I was kid. But slow. Like broken tape slow

So I radio to my coworker (we are two people in night) but only noise come. Like TV static.

So I go inside

Yes I know. Stupid.

Inside is more quiet than I like. And long. Very long. Store on sides, but no store names. Just glass. Empty. Some fake plants, all dry. Dust in air. Everything feel like, someone just leave it one day and never come back.

After some minutes I turn around

The entrance is gone

Behind me only more hallway. I say what the fuck out loud. Try to walk back but it don’t work. Is like hallway just stretch longer.

Then I hear sound

A voice say: “Exit is at the end of Hallway 6”

But is no speaker no radio. Just the voice, close to my ear like someone behind me but nobody there. I almost cry little

I walk more

Pass a shop window and inside is mannequin with security uniform. Same like me. Same badge. My name on it. My real name. But I never tell it to anyone in job. I only give them nickname.

Then I look in the glass, try to see what’s behind me

I see something move. Like shadow but fast

I turn fast. Nothing.

I start to run now. I don’t care. This is bullshit.

There is food court but not like old one. It look new. Like people just eat there. Food still on tables. Burger with bite in it. Tray with soda.

I feel sick

A phone ring. Old payphone on wall. It ring and ring and ring

I answer

The voice say “You’re late”

I don’t understand. I say who are you. No answer. Then the wall touch my hand. It feel like pulse. Like it’s breathing

I run more

Every door I open lead to more hallway. One have escalator but it never end. One is dark cinema with no movie, just noise. One is storage room full of mannequin heads

I walk for long time. My legs hurt. My flashlight dying.

Sometimes I see people. But not real? A girl cry near empty pet store. A old man sleep in info desk. I try speak to them but they vanish.

Then I see mannequin again. Now he wear my jacket. With same rip in arm. Same shoes. Same pants

I feel like maybe... maybe I already disappear?

Voice come again

“There is exit at end of Hallway 6”

I not believe it anymore

But I still walk. I don’t know what else

Now music play again. But is slower. Like underwater

If someone see this, don’t go inside if you see hallway with no number in map. If you hear music, just leave. Even if someone call you. Don’t answer

I’m still walking

I think hallway want me to forget how to stop

Do not play this game

Please
