  I'm twenty today! It's gonna be a great week. Five day's and night's in a nice hotel with a view. A bottle of, uh, damn what was it? Bourbon? Some blunts to myself. That was so gonna be fucking great! Just a hour drive on 95 North, exit here and there. Then Bob's ya uncle! Instead...

My eye's open to black. A choirs of pain and madness greats me. " What the fuck?" I murmmer under the hood. Hands grab me and holst me from the table. When the bag is removed I see my heroes. In the dim torch light of the cave, two jet black masks come into view. One, in the form of a bird. The other, a beast resembling a big cat. "Hey, man let's go! I gotcha" the cat man said. My eye's scan my surroundings seeing a mass of bodies in sheer agony. "What the fuck is going on!?", I yelled. "A spell" said the bird guy. They were suited like tactical unit but it's their day off. Jeans and hiking jackets. Everything else said business. "Fuck ya mean, "A spell"? We don't get magic here! Dog, this earth!" I screamed as they dragged me out of the chaos into a corridor. "Listen, I'm Hawk. That's Linx. We will explain everything. Everything when we get back to the safehouse." Safehouse? Linx walked over and said "It's cool. We're only doing what's right. Dead cultists is a necessity." We began our walk to what I presume the exit from this pit of my death. This had to be a dream right? A sudden ear piercing screech came from behind us. In the dark, from the dead cultists. 
"OH shit! Is that what I think?" said Linx, in a tone that sounded almost fearful. "Double time!", said Hawk and we hauled ass. I started to out pace the pair of super agents and  nearly tripped and broke some and died again when gunshots rang out. In the confines of the passage, it's deafening. Raid thunder claps and wailing of the creature they're battling. Hawk yanks me off the ground and we're back to beating feet. Then a got damn explosions happens. Linx appears by my side, right in stride. "Sorry, I hate wasting ammo".
 
"Move it, boy's", called Hawk. After maybe, ten minutes of walking we reached a ladder, presumably the exit. Then we heard a blood curdling, inhuman scream. "Hawk, up first. Swapping systems!", called Linx. "Go right behind, and be quick about it!" Hawks as fast as damn cat on the rungs as I'm barely three up. Loud pop's ring out from below. Followed by grunts and shrieks of pain. I don't look down again and climb for my life. I'm  yanked upward to my feet, when I was near the near the top. I yelped in fear, only to come face to mask with Hawk. "Run!" He said " Linx!? Incoming! Car right God damn Now!!" And like in the tunnel he was there keeping pace. Never saw him leap. From the car I got a good look at where we came from. A rusted old house. Crumbling walls and a shell of a roof. Then the creature climbed out of the hatch but it stopped. Looking up to sky as if for the first time, I thought. A calamity fell on that fucking thing. It had to have seen it. Had to! The impact shook the world. My world. Something far more impossible. I could feel it's presence from here. It felt like love and the deepest hate. Death and loss. War and joy? It's shining yellow...eye's as bright as gold. Gleaming and dance with the fire it brought. The creature was nothing in comparison. It was too much to bare. Yet I do.
