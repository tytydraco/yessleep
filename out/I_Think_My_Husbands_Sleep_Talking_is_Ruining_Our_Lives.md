So, I had originally typed and posted this story to another subreddit, but figured I could get some actual advice here. This is the closest to the original story, but with some changes for this subreddit’s rules. Any and all advice is appreciated.

So I am writing this during my lunch break at work and can't fit everything together at once, but I will come back to update this post whenever I can and know that my husband doesn't think I'm writing this (hence why I'm at work).



For some background, we married back in January, after dating for under 2 years and living together for 1, and since marriage we moved into a new apartment, and adopted two cats, Hazel and Greta. They were 7 and 8 years old when we adopted them, and they are very independent cats who maybe join us in bed for 30 minutes to get some attention, and then they disappear and do whatever they do in the night.



Back in the beginning of August, for about a week, Hazel started coming to bed with me. I have to get up at 4 in the morning so I am always the first one to go to bed, and my husband will stay up for a little bit playing on his computer before coming to bed. I thought it was strange, but I just assumed the cats were finally warming up to us and wanting to cuddle in bed. She sat on the pillows above head. On this night, my husband came to bed about an hour later.



I couldn't sleep very well as I have on and off periods of insomnia, and the Benadryl hasn't kicked in yet. After a little bit of tossing and turning, I noticed my husband staring past me, looking straight at the wall with his eyes half opened, whites only showing, and whispering very quickly. I couldn’t make out what he was saying. I just stared at him, completely stunned. He has talked in his sleep before, but it was always very brief and he said actual sentences. After a minute of this weird whispering, he ended it with a shhhh like you do when you try to get someone quiet. His eyes closed all the way.



I stood up in bed and stared at him, in a complete shock. 



"Are you fucking with me?"



He put his hand over my face, saying shhhh again, sliding his fingers down my face. He turned over in bed and snored. I was freaked out, my cat was freaked out, and I woke him up.



"What the fuck was that?" I asked him.



"What was what?" He said half awake.



"Your sleep talking."



He shrugged and went back to sleep. Hazel came down off the pillows and slept next to me for night, but I didn't sleep for hours.



My alarm went off at 4 in the morning, and I got ready for work. I was completely dead from the lack of sleep, and ended up being a few minutes late to work. The factory I worked at made fishing line, and the machine I was at had been locked out by the night mechanic. My lead had already taken the day off, so I had to make my way down to the maintenance department and ask for one of the day mechanics to unlock it so I can finish my work order assigned to this machine.



I was power walking and not really paying attention when I went around the corner and my foot caught a piece of metal that was sticking out from a shelf. I tried correcting myself to avoid falling but it rolled on the shelf seemingly sticking to my ankle. Because it was still clinging to my ankle I fell awkwardly and basically dove into the concrete ground. The maintenance's parts lady happened to see me fall and came right over. My hand was shaking uncontrollably, in a pain I've never felt before. Their supervisor ended up taking me to the hospital where they (painfully) found out I had broken my arm.



My lunch break is almost over but I swear when I can sit down and write again it will make sense why I believe it has something to do with my husband's sleep talking as there are more instances like this happening. Hopefully I can get back to this tonight.

I apologize if the first part sounds really choppy. I am not a writer and haven't written anything since high school and I only had 20 ish minutes to get it all out.



Breaking my arm at work was a trippy thing to go through. I had never broken a bone in my body and I had never been so creeped out by my husband.



He did take really good care of me though. I didn't have to lift a finger to do anything while at home, he cuddled me very gently, drove me to all my appointments, he made me feel as though we are an old married couple. The way we talk to each other and all the boring old couple stuff we do. The way our bones are constantly popping and cracking when we get up and stretch. The way his eyes are the same you see on a very old man who has seen the life flash before his eyes while on his deathbed.



I started to joke about his sleep talking was what broke my arm. It seemed so silly to connect the two incidents after a few weeks.



September had rolled around, his birthday passed, and we were planning our anniversary for October. His grandfather had passed away back in July, and my husband was feeling like himself again. It was a Friday so we had a few drinks and were enjoying the evening. It was pretty late by the time we got into bed. He fell asleep instantly, but I had to go to the bathroom first.



Hazel had taken her place on my pillows, and Greta at the foot of the bed on my side. I had to stumble gently on the bed to avoid squishing the girls. I found it odd my husband was pretty rigid in bed. Sleeping on his back was his normal pose but it seemed like he was really uncomfortable. His arms and legs seemed far too stretched. I tried to shake him awake but he didn't wake. He made this weird groaning sound or maybe it was a wheeze. I don't remember I just remember thinking it was weird as hell. He snapped out of it and we cuddled for the night.



November 15th, 2025





Its been a few hours since the last update but my husband was summoned to his computer by one of his buddies. I don't think he's ever played on his computer this early in the morning on a weekend.



But from where I left off last time: his cousin passed away that Saturday afternoon. He was in a car accident.



The news hit my husband like a truck. He had barely recovered emotionally from his grandfather's passing and now the closest thing he had as a brother from his early childhood was now gone. It felt like my husband was gone for about a week.



It's why I feel conflicted about posting these things happening and especially why I don't want my husband to know I'm writing this. It just feels wrong to connect these horrible events to something as seemingly benign as sleep talking. I feel bad because it's like I'm almost blaming him for these things happening when he has no control or memory of even doing it. I've gotten to the point where I'm considering getting holy water to keep on my side on the bed for when he does start sleep talking.



I've also been trying to pin point when he did sleep talk normally to when his sleep talk happened the night before an event would happen. I considered the earliest possibility being back in March when my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer but that feels like a stretch and a really shitty thing to pin on my husband. Pinning all these things on my husband feels like a really, really shitty thing to do and I pray he never finds out I've written any of this. It's all a little too coincidental for it not to be connected



I think the most likely when his 'normal' sleep talking stopped was after the drive home from his grandfather's funeral. We live in Western Colorado and his extended family lives in Southern Arizona. He dreaded the drive to and from there, figuring out hotels, dealing with Phoenix traffic.



The drive there wasn't terrible it was just a long and hot 9 hour drive. Me and my husband have been married for about 6 months on paper but never announced it to anyone. We haven't had a proposal either so as far as anyone knows we're just dating still. We did this on a whim on a random day in January but the titles office was closed due to MLK Jr day so we got married that Friday after work and celebrated at a restaurant that was close by. My parents wouldn't have cared because they absolutely adore this man and after a year and a couple of months of living together they said they already see us as a married couple. His parents would have made our lives hell if they found out we were already married. They would continually downplay my importance to my man since we started dating. When he had moved into my apartment after about 8 months of dating they tried to stop him, despite him being a 25 year old man. They didn't want to meet my parents, as they remarked to my husband, "Do we have to meet the parents of every girl you date?". I was his first girlfriend.



We attended the funeral at different times since they don't know we're married, and I have never met any of his extended family so it felt disrespectful to show up at the family's open casket time slot. I waited at the hotel until the funeral was opened to the public and met with my husband there. I got strange looks as I was a complete stranger to all of them except my husband and in-laws. His parents stared at me with disdain, as if they wanted to ask why I even showed up. I ignored them as they ignored me and focused on comforting my husband and sister in law.



We started the drive home in the morning with the intention of getting home by 8 the latest. That did not happen.



The drive was fine until we had to pass through Phoenix. Traffic there is already hell but with all the construction they were doing just made it worse. We were just happy he had a newer car with air conditioning that could keep up with the hellish Arizona heat. The speed limit was reduced to 40 in most areas and some areas it was down to 25. It set us back by several hours that by the time we started driving through the reservation the sun was already setting and he was getting uneasy.



Since he grew up in Arizona and with his family being mostly native, he was superstitious about driving through reservations during the night. He also hated night driving in general since he is prone to sleeping behind the wheel, which has caused two accidents, which happened before I had met him. He made it clear he refuses to do night driving when we first started dating and planning trips.



I'm not that superstitious. I don't really believe, but I also don't not believe either. I'm more of a "don't fear it but respect it" kind of mentality towards that kind of stuff. I was talking to coworkers about the drive to Arizona a week before the drive and all of them had their own stories about being in Arizona. Ed, one of the mechanics at my work who is from there, had his own story about why he would never drive through the reservation at night.



Ed was driving during the night to get to Denver in the morning and sleep away his day off. He said he saw a hitchhiker along the road. He said fuck that and continued driving. Two hours later he saw the same hitchhiker and hauled ass all the way home.



I think my husband fell asleep behind the wheel after it got dark. I have never seen anyone fall asleep while driving so it freaked me out. He was staring at the road as if in a complete daze. I was trying to keep him talking to keep him alert and not fall asleep but he stopped talking back to me, but was doing his usual non sensible sleep talking. I waved my hands in front of his eyes and he didn't react. He was driving normally, going around the winding road as if he could see just fine. I wasn't sure how to wake him up, I didn't know if that would cause him to jerk and crash the car. I waited until the speed limit dropped to 30 before gently squeezing his arm. I told him to slow down and stop. I carefully shaked his leg. He didn't wake up but he did slow down to about 20 on a straight stretch of road. I grabbed the wheel to keep it straight and yelled his name, shaking his leg much less carefully.



He slammed the brakes and was panicking. He started crying, told me he felt guilty for sleeping, especially when I was in the car with him. I told him he was fine, I was safe, and nothing bad happened. I told him we could switch and I would drive the rest of the way home. He only asked me if we were still in the reservation.



My husband refused to step out of the car. He insisted on driving until we reached Utah. I tried to reassure him he was stressed out about the funeral and the driving and he just needed to rest. He drove on before I could even finish my sentence. The whole drive home from then he was constantly looking out his driver window, and then to my passenger window. The last hour of driving he would stare intently at the rear view mirror, despite no one else being on the road until we got back into town.



November 16th, 2025



I'm in bed with another sleepless insomniac night. My husband came to bed with me as he's had a long day and wanted to rest in bed. Hazel was on her perch above my head, and Greta laid in between me and my husband, in this little pocket made between our legs and the blanket was fluffed up a bit.



He fell asleep in about ten minutes. Something I've long been jealous of him for.



He started snoring, but then just stopped suddenly. He rolled over, with what I was assuming to get comfortable. Greta wasn't too happy to be moved, and she moved over onto my legs, glaring at my husband.



My husband let out this weird exhale, bordering on a wheeze. I shook him gently to wake him up as I didn't want to know what would come out of his mouth. He grabbed my hand, and got on top of me. His eyes were the gross half open whites only visible. The terrible wheeze returned, crescendoing into an impossibly high pitch sound.



Hazel hissed at him, and the sound stopped. He pushed the cat off the bed, and laid down next to me.the snoring resumed.



I took the cats, grabbed some pillows and blankets and got in my car, making sure all the doors are locked.



I don't know what to do. I don't know where to go.



All I know is something terrible is going to happen.
