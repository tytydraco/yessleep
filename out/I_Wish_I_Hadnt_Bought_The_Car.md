I’m James, and I used to work at a factory located about forty miles from my city. Before that, I worked at a gas station convenience store. Its owner, who ran the place alone and had no heirs, disappeared one day and never returned. He was young, charismatic, and had a natural businessman’s charm. I remember the last time I saw him clearly. He wore a hoodie and avoided letting me see his face. His hands stayed tucked into his jeans, and he seemed to be in a hurry. Still, when I raised my hand for a handshake, he accepted. His hand felt strange, light and wrinkled, as if I had shaken hands with an old man. That was the last handshake I ever had with him before his disappearance.

A year later, while searching for work, I stumbled upon a vacancy at a factory that produced tyres. I don’t think I should name the factory or the brand. My daily routine involved boarding a bus that constantly ran along that route. There were usually only two passengers: me and an elderly woman who worked at a nearby factory. She was always sad, often sobbing quietly over something she never spoke about. Ever since my first day at the factory, I had seen her there, boarding the bus, usually sitting beside me.

She often said she felt alone, that her days were numbered. She used to commute in her own car, but she had stopped driving. She said she could no longer manage it and preferred public transport, just to feel accompanied. Ironically, all I wanted was a vehicle of my own, a second-hand car that would spare me the dirty, noisy bus. I never told her that. But whenever I said something like, “You should be using your own car instead of this crap. I wish I had one,” she would reply, “You’re young. You should definitely buy one,” ending with a tense smile, as if holding back something she desperately wanted to say.

She often showed me photos from when she was younger, holiday pictures, even her Instagram. Then she would start crying and place her feather-light, almost weightless hand on my shoulder. Once, she showed me a few pictures she had taken near a gas station when she was younger. Strangely, the station looked too familiar, almost identical to the one I used to work at. I shrugged it off as a mere coincidence. Before she could show me more, her spectacles slipped from her face and fell onto the bus floor.

The change was instant. She became horrified, truly horrified, and let out a short, sharp scream, as if she had seen something violently wrong. She fumbled blindly, panic spreading across her face as she reached for the glasses. “I can’t see,” she cried. “Please...please, I can’t see without them.” I noticed her grey eyes then. She said it was impossible for her to see anything without those glasses, not even light.

She had grown very old, and all I could do was sympathize. She deserved that sympathy. Still, her obsession with her younger self unsettled me. She clung to it as though she had aged only days ago. Once, I suggested she quit her job. She never responded only changed the topic every time.

The bus driver was another unsettling presence. He constantly watched us through the rear-view mirror, like a watchman assigned to observe. Whenever I told him, "Keep your eyes on the road," he would reply, "The road knows me. It knows who’s driving it," followed by manic laughter. His gaze, his laughter, his reckless driving, it all made me uneasy. Sometimes, when I looked into the mirror, I could see only his eyes, with no forehead or surrounding features, as if the rest of him didn’t matter.

Eventually, I decided to abandon the bus routine entirely. A friend offered me a small jeep he hadn’t driven in a while, at a great price. I loved it. The next day didn’t begin at the bus stop, but at my own house. I turned the key and heard the soulful hum of an engine that was finally mine. It felt wholesome. Liberating.

After an eight-hour work shift, I was whistling as I entered my car and began driving home. The road was completely empty, no vehicles at all. After a mile or two, I saw an elderly man standing beneath a tree, holding a walking stick and stretching out a hitchhiker sign. He looked to be in his seventies. I stopped. He got in, smiled, and stared at me for a long moment.

When I pressed the accelerator, the car didn’t move. I tried changing gears. Nothing happened. His eyes locked onto mine. I couldn’t look away. My body began to feel weak. I watched his grey hair turn black, his wrinkles smooth away, his frame grow strong. At the same time, my own body shrank, my hands thinning, my muscles wasting, my vision dimming. Darkness crept in.

Before I lost consciousness completely, he pressed a pair of spectacles into my hand. "Here,” he said softly. “Put these on. They’ll let you live the few days you have left." I slid them on. He leaned closer. “Don’t remove them,” he warned. “If you do, they’ll make you see what you shouldn’t.” Then, almost as an afterthought, he added, "People don’t last long once they stop riding, That’s all I know."

I’m on the bus right now. I typed all of this from here. The woman is sitting beside me again, showing me a selfie she once took at a gas station while refuelling. I’m in the background of a few of those photos. I had unknowingly ruined her selfies. Now we sit here, holding hands, sobbing together.

A while ago, my spectacles slipped off. And I saw them. Countless people, screaming, crying, sitting silently throughout the bus. Faces stacked upon faces, lives trapped in reflection. I realized then that without the glasses, we see through the driver’s eyes. The mirror is not for watching the road. It records everything.

The driver slowly turns his head completely around and smiles at us. His head has no eyes. They are fixed inside the rear-view mirror. And I know what’s going to happen next.
