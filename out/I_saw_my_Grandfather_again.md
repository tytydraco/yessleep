I (F27) know what you're thinking. "Of course you did! He's your grandfather!". Well, obviously, he's passed. It happened about 3 years ago. He was an old man, 87, and slipped in the shower. I heard it was pretty painless and I never had to see the body. It was a closed casket funeral.

When he was here I was close with him. Closer than most with their grandparents I'd say. My father died when I was 3 so he basically took up the role of dad for me. I remember how he'd take me to this little forest-y area in our city. It's a loud, vibrant city but there? Not a sound. It's so peaceful. He'd take me to it and tell me stories about my dad while sitting on a tree log. Those are the moments I missed the most after he died.

I remember the last time he talked to me on that log. Telling me some story about a hero fox saving a village from invading monsters. The fox ends up realizing the actual monsters were hiding within the village itself, and had to find them all.

He left me inheritance. It was a pen, a small pen that was painted gold with his initials on the end. I remember he'd write his diary with it. He told me about how his friend got it for him. It was after being fired. It was to remind him better things were ahead. Every day I'd write a small note for him. Just about how my day went. The good, the bad, the scary, the serene. Anything that happened. Then I'd lock the note and pen in a small box until I wrote the next. I locked it. That's the important part.

Last night, I went to write a note and the pen was missing. It was locked, obviously, so it couldn't role away or anything. However it was nowhere in the box. Right at that moment I looked outside and a tiny fox runs through my garden. I saw it, something reflective in its mouth. It could only be the pen.

That was him, right? As a spirit animal or something. I mean, a fox coming to save me, like his story. 3 years after he died, the same age I was when my father passed. How else could it get the pen? The pen I would only ever use to write to him.

It has to be him. He wouldn't leave me like he did. Especially not dying in such a trivial way. He wasn't one to quit or abandon people. I see no other explanation than that being him coming back to help me.

I called my family but they think I'm wrong. I don't believe them. They didn't know him like I did. It's not just the coincidences. I felt his soul from that fox. Has anyone else had similar experiences with spirits? Does anyone know what I can do to contact him? I know he's trying to speak to me.
