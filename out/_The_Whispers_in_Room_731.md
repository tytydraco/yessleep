I never should have taken that job at the old Oakwood Sanitarium. The pay was good, sure, but no amount of money is worth what I experienced during those three horrifying nights as a security guard. The decaying building loomed over me as I approached for my first shift, its Victorian architecture a stark contrast to the modern city that had grown around it. The sanitarium had been closed for decades, but a local historical society was working to restore it as a museum. That's why they needed someone to keep an eye on things at night.

The moment I stepped inside, a chill ran down my spine. The air was thick with dust and the unmistakable scent of decay. My flashlight beam cut through the darkness, revealing peeling wallpaper and abandoned medical equipment. I tried to shake off the eerie feeling as I began my rounds, telling myself it was just an old building, nothing more.

The first few hours were uneventful. I patrolled the corridors, checked the locks, and tried to ignore the creaks and groans of the settling structure. It wasn't until around 2 AM that things took a turn for the bizarre. I was on the third floor when I heard it - a faint whisper coming from one of the rooms. At first, I thought it was just the wind, but as I approached Room 731, the whispers grew louder.

I stood frozen outside the door, my hand hovering over the knob. The whispers were clearer now, a jumble of voices speaking in hushed, urgent tones. I couldn't make out the words, but the desperation in their tone was unmistakable. Against my better judgment, I pushed the door open.

The room was empty, save for a rusted bed frame and a cracked mirror on the far wall. The whispers stopped abruptly as I entered, leaving an oppressive silence in their wake. My flashlight beam trembled as I swept it across the room, searching for any sign of the source. That's when I saw it - a flicker of movement in the mirror.

I spun around, but there was nothing behind me. When I looked back at the mirror, I saw dozens of faces pressed against the glass, their mouths moving silently, eyes wide with terror. I stumbled backward, my heart pounding in my chest. As I watched, horrified, a hand emerged from the mirror's surface, reaching out towards me.

I ran. I ran faster than I ever had in my life, tearing through the hallways and down the stairs. I didn't stop until I was outside, gasping for breath in the cool night air. I called my supervisor and quit on the spot, making up some excuse about a family emergency. I couldn't bring myself to tell him the truth - who would believe me?

But that wasn't the end of it. Over the next few days, I started seeing things out of the corner of my eye - shadowy figures that disappeared when I turned to look. And at night, I could hear the whispers, even in my own home. They were calling to me, begging for help.

I tried to ignore it, to convince myself it was just stress or lack of sleep. But the whispers grew louder, more insistent. I found myself drawn back to the sanitarium, standing outside and staring up at the window of Room 731. I knew I had to go back, to face whatever was in that mirror. Maybe then the whispers would stop.

As I write this, I'm preparing to return to Oakwood Sanitarium. I don't know what I'll find there, or if I'll even make it out. But if you're reading this, and I haven't been heard from in a while, please - whatever you do - stay away from Room 731. And if you hear whispers calling out to you in the night, for God's sake, don't listen.
