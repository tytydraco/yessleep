My day started as usual. I was busy signing contracts and papers. This made me tired, so I decided to take a break. I took a walk around the office. 

That's when I heard one of my employees sing. I stopped. The song made me stop dead in the tracks. It fascinated me.

It fascinated me. I asked the employee where he heard it. He told me it's sung by a friend of his, by the name of Julius, an aspiring singer. My record label could use such talents, so I decided to go to Julius to offer him a contract.

I drove to Julius' house. The streets were empty. I knocked at the door. No answer. I opened the door. I called Julius. No answer. I continued. I saw a mirror.

It reflected a horned human head just floating behind me. I turned around. Nothing. I felt someone breathing from behind. I decided to leave. To hell with Lucius! But then I heard the song.

I followed its source. I got upstairs. Lucius was on his bed, singing with his eyes shut. A cross on the wall. It swung to the rhythm.

"Could I please have a word with you?" I asked. No answer, as he kept singing.

Then, he opened his eyes. Fully dark, with no pupils. Julius levitated. I fled.

I decided to let a friend of mine, who was a priest, about the state I found Lucius in and what happened there. He told me not to worry.

Later that day, I was home having dinner when I heard the song on the radio. It was an old radio I had. 

But then it hit me. The radio had no batteries in it. I decided to hit it with a baseball bat. I kept hitting it harder and harder, as it kept playing the song. I destroyed the radio. The song stopped.

That night, I heard footsteps. I woke up. They stopped. I got on my feet, thinking someone entered my house, maybe a thief. But there was nobody except myself.

The next day, I was driving around. I saw a shadow man in the middle of the street. I almost had an accident. I got out of my car. I heard the song again. I decided to follow it. It was as though it was coming from a nearby building. 

I entered the abandoned building, though I was scared. The song kept luring me in. I kept going from room to room, following the song. Always the song. I heard it coming from below a staircase. 

But it was dark. Then, it stopped. I saw a pair of eyes glowing in the dark. And another. Growls. I fled. Then, I heard the song again. It was beautiful. I decided to follow it. This time, I left the building and followed it. It took me into the forest.

It came from the woods. Deep from the woods. I reached a hut. I saw its source. It was, this time, sung by a woman. Young. Beautiful like the song. 

She invited me in. I noticed my shadow on the wall. There was laughter and fun. There were people there. They all sang the song. I joined them.

Young and good-looking men and women all singing and having a good time. They danced. I joined them. But then, I saw their shadows on the walls.

The people moved, but the shadows stayed in place. Something was off. I screamed. I grabbed a nearby wooden plank. They all turned their eyes fully black. Then, their skin turned lizard-like. Gray. Decayed. Demonic.

They cornered me. The song stopped. I ran. They chased me. Growling. I ran like crazy. The demonic legion was after me.

I reached a river. I stopped. Nobody followed me anymore. I noticed I was carrying an axe. It was bloody. Sirens blared. I heard footsteps. I turned around to see the cops.

They told me I was on a spree of violence where I destroyed cars, and property and even hurt people. I... I did that? How? When?

They had me filmed. The cops cuffed me. I heard the song again. But this time, I couldn't follow it, as the officers prevented my escape and put me in the car. I told them about what happened. 

No one believed me. No one else ever heard that song. Julius was real but was murdered six years ago. 

My employee's name never appeared in my company's records. I'm writing this on my way to a psychiatric evaluation. 

They said they might have to restrain me. Tie me on that bed, so I couldn't do any more harm.

But even then, even now, I will always hear that song. That beautiful song.
