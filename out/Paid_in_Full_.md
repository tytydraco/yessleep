The phone startled me out of a dream. The dream was about a bartender I spent a fortune tipping the last year I was in med school. She had coxcomb red hair, big tits, and a tattoo of a satyr on her bicep. In the dream we were on a desert island, fucking. I woke up in a big, cold bedroom alone.

Down the stairs, groggily. Careful, careful. A sleepy misstep and it’s a trip to the ER, as a patient. Godforbid.

Standing in my dark kitchen, bare feet cold on the black slab floor. I picked up my landline. “Hello?”

No answer, just crackle and static. “Hello,” I repeated, impatiently.

“Took you long enough. Busy getting drunk or somethin’?” It was a woman’s voice, and she sounded old and angry.

“Who is this?”

“Don’t play dumb, sonny. You know why I’m calling.” The line was crackling and buzzing like she was calling from a payphone in Moscow in 1985.

“Who the hell is this?”

“Oh you think you can take a tone with me? You know damn well your rent’s overdue. You know what’s good for you, you’ll pony up pronto.”

“I don’t know who the hell you are, but I don’t pay rent. I’m a big boy with a Porsche and a mortga…”

And then came the sound of a phone being hung up furiously on her end. 

“Some senile lunatic,” I muttered to myself and went to turn the ringer off on the phone. But that must have been the first thing I did without even thinking about it when I got to the phone, drowsy and confused, because it was already off. So I just left the damn thing off the hook.

I stared out the big window in my kitchen for a minute, shuddered at the snow that had accumulated outside, renewed my vow to move to Santa Cruz before I was 50, and headed back to bed.

=====

The next couple of weeks were smooth and easy. I saw patients. I wrote scrips for beta blockers and statins and the occasional dick pills. Bought rounds of drinks at bars in Druid Hills like Moonglow and Wurster’s Pub–places with truffle fries and 15 dollar cocktails. Watched Succession while I stared at my near-mint condition Peloton rowing machine.

The next couple of weeks went smooth and easy. I saw patients. I wrote prescriptions. I’d occasionally have a few drinks with colleagues and nurses at one of the spots in Druid Hills–Moonshine, Cake and Ale, Swan Song. Truffle fries and a 15 dollar cocktail and some shoptalk. Maybe a nurse would get flirty but nothing would come of it. Then back home to an Elmore Leonard book and bed.

Mid-month I had a date with a woman named Pam, who I met on Match.com. A couple of years ago I naively assumed I’d be a hot commodity on dating sites. Turns out savvy women learn fast that a middle-aged, divorced doctor has twice the baggage and half the money of a slightly younger, never-been-married doctor. So Pam was my first nibble in some time.

We met on a Friday night, at The Griffin and the Unicorn in Upper Druid Hills: good bistro food, good drinks, parking’s a bitch.

Pam was 41 and very pretty. She was tall with short dark hair and bright blue eyes and a parakeet beak of a nose. She smelled expensive when we hugged hello. Nice ensemble too: black cashmere sweater (rag and bone, probably), tight jeans, and a pair of duck boots from LL Bean. She had a JD from Northeastern and worked in commercial real estate but was way too civilized to talk much about it.

It all made me a little self-conscious about my own pudge and receding hairline and tendency to dwell on work stories, and so when we got flirtatious over fish tacos and brick chicken, and when it turned downright dirty sipping Old Fashioneds, I was over the moon.

“You wanna go back to, uh, my place?”

She giggled. “Been a while since you said that to someone?”

“With any expectation of them agreeing, yeah. What gave me away?”

“Lawyers can smell desperation.”

“Oh. I was hoping all the Tom Ford Noir I doused myself in would cover that up.”

“It does help.”

We drove over separately and walked up to the door together.

“Nice place. I love Victorians.”

“I bought at a bad time, but I needed a place. Didn’t want to do some kind of divorcee’ dirtbag transition where I stayed in an apartment and waited out the hot market.”

“This ran you, what, high 7s?”

“Low 9s.”

“Shit. Yeah you got screwed a little. Still.”

I turned on a brushed nickel halogen lamp and lambent lighting wafted through the room. Pam looked around and grinned. “So uh, did you just call Restoration Hardware and ask them for the second most expensive of everything?”

And she had my number. The cappuccino colored leather couch; the halogen lamp; the decorative spotlight, the bar shaped like an old globe of the world, that swung open revealing crystal tumblers and six kinds of whisky; the driftwood coffee table; and even the bleached elk horns hanging on the wall all came from Resto. “Good eye. But actually I carefully selected each piece myself, out of the catalog.”

She grinned. “Doctors.”

“Hey. I’ve got more money than time.”

“Or taste.”

“Well. You don’t want too much taste. You have too much taste and you end up working at Restoration Hardware.”

“Touche’. Just got out of a relationship with a guy like that. Cool tattoos, though.”

I gestured for her to have a seat on the couch. “Wine?”

“Always.”

And while I was in the kitchen picking out a bottle of white from the rack–reaching for one, putting it back and selecting a less pretentious but more expensive bottle–she called out “Actually, I have this very same coffee table. I just mixed and matched with some stuff from Pottery Barn too.”

“How Bohemian.” Ransacking a drawer for a corkscrew. If I’d found the damn thing faster the date might not have ended so abruptly. 

But then, pushing aside five or six sizes of measuring cups to finally get at the corkscrew, I heard someone pounding on the door.

“I’ll get that,” she said.

Well. Shit.

I walked back into the living room with a bottle of wine and two glasses, expecting something weird but putting on a brave face. The look on Pam’s face–like a badger who had gotten into an amphetamine warehouse, wasn’t a good omen. And the room suddenly reeked of burnt matches.

“Uh. Wine?” I held up the bottle in my right hand and two glasses in my left and tried to look sexy.

She was sitting back on the couch, staring at a piece of paper. Then she said “Christ, who do you owe 200 thousand dollars to that’s trying to collect banging on your door on a Saturday night?”

“What? I’ve never owed anyone that kind of money. My med school loans were less than that and they’re paid.”

“Well when I got to the door there was a note there,” she held up a piece of yellow legal paper,rather dramatically, like she was presenting damning evidence to a jury. “In big, angry looking writing it says ‘You owe me 220. Pay up or else. MM.’ Who the fuck is MM and why do you owe them so much money?”

“Oh. I uh, I think that’s actually 220 dollars.”

“That’s worse! You owe someone two hundred bucks and you can’t or won’t pay?”

“No. I mean, I think this is some older woman, maybe mentally ill?” And I explained as succinctly and sanely as I could about the weird phone call.

“Look. I”m sorry. You seem like a nice guy and all. But for a first date this is all VERY red flaggy.” And that was that. Pam and her Bean boots and cute butt walked out of my life. Whoever this senile lunatic, this ancient crone was–MM presumably–she was complicating my life badly. I even spoke with my lawyer about getting a restraining order, which he pointed out is difficult to do if you don’t know what someone looks like or even what their name is. 

The Big Scene though, came two weeks later–on a Wednesday, the 15th of the month.

I was sitting in a fat, soft leather chair next to my living room window, scrolling through my phone. The night was quiet, clear, chilly and dark. The only light on in the house was the reading lamp on the table next to my chair. Someone on a medicine subreddit had said something so blatantly wrong I doubted they were even a medical professional, and I was hunting and pecking my way through an acerbic reply when the window shook like it had been hit with a brick.

I tensed up so fast and so hard that my neck knotted and I jumped out of the chair, turning to face the window. I saw my own reflection, faint and translucent, and visible around and through me I could see the room reflected. Outside the window was dark and indistinct but a small, human silhouette lingered right in front of the window. I turned to run the hell away, and then thought again and lunged for the lamp, shutting it off and throwing the room into darkness while making the outside clearer.

The shape I had seen resolved into an old crone who had pressed her face directly against the window and was peering in. Her mouth was pressed against the glass, but her breath was not fogging up the window the way it should have been. I remembered the old method of holding a mirror up to a corpse’s mouth to see if it was breathing.

The face was white and bloated. Teeth rotten, gums mottled. One eye was wide open as if in shock–the pupil so dark it could have been black. The other eye was missing. Just an empty socket, shockingly clean. The overall effect of the face made me think of a lily in a hothouse, wilting and prey to beetles.

With her good eye, the woman was scanning the room while she pounded on the glass. She was mouthing words, angrily and urgently. Then I took a step back, and suddenly she turned to the side and strode angrily toward the front door. In profile I got a glimpse of how ragged and gaunt her face was–the pallid face and livid red cheeks and bulbous nose were frozen in my brain. And I saw that behind her she was lugging a huge purse.

And then I heard pounding at the door. Then I heard her try the door knob. I would realize later that I had a magnetized strip full of expensive knives, but in my panic all I could think to do was grab a letter opener from the coffee table. It was brushed nickel and had cost 17 dollars, I thought idiotically.

Strangest of all, I could hear rattling and jingling outside, as though she was going through keys. Then she was trying to jam a key into the keyhole but it was useless, it cleary didn’t fit. 

“Okay deadbeat,” she yelled, “Have it your way. But I’m coming back here with Sheriff Carter, then we’ll get you out of here then we’ll change the damn locks back.”

I sat on the floor, leaning against the wall and pulled my knees to my chest and breathed deep, in and out. When I had calmed down I went to the door and threw it open. That was when I saw bloody footprints leading from the porch up the driveway and then disappearing. 

As far as I knew, there was no Sheriff Carter in Druid Hills. Calling the police did, however, seem like a hell of a good idea.

Officer Watkins was a cautious, tactful man with a head full of silver hair. He sat in the red and white Regency chair next to mine and took notes gravely. It was hard to imagine him lasting a whole shift in any police department outside Druid Hills, but here he seemed to fit right in.

I told him about the phone call and the note and now the horrible looking old woman showing up at my door. Window, in fact. 

“I just, I’m afraid someone who is mentally ill has gotten a bad idea in her head. It might be unsafe. For both of us. I feel like there needs to be some way to find out who she is and get her help.”

“Get her help far away from you and Druid Hills,” he noted wryly. And then when I said nothing he added, rather obliquely, “You know, this used to be the bad part of town.”

“I wasn’t aware there was ever a slum in Druid Hills.”

“Oh, in the 1980s the money started to run out for some folks who had never thought that would happen to them. The Victorians in this part of town started to go to seed–repairs went undone, taxes weren’t paid. Like the man said once, it happened slowly at first then all at once. Houses in this neighborhood got turned into cheap apartments. Then of course a few years ago they got bought up and turned back into the sea moss green and cape cod blue manses they used to be when folks like you started moving in.”

“I don’t see what this has to do with me. Do you mean the crazy woman harassing me maybe used to live here and thinks she still does?”

“Well you said she was jabbering about rent. And calling you a deadbeat. And the note was signed MM.”

“Right.”

“See a lady named Mildred Miller used to own a bunch of these houses. She was maybe the first and last slum lord, slum lady I guess, the Hills ever had.”

“So I’m being stalked by a crazy woman who thinks she still owns the house that I am, you know, paying a mortgage on? I guess she shouldn’t be too hard to find if you know who she is?”

“Well. Actually Mildred died 30 years ago or so.”

I stared at him. He looked back placidly. “Is someone playing a joke on me here, officer?”

“Folks here have a lot of things: they have a lot of money, they have a lot of insecurities, they have a lot of….predilections. Two things they don’t have much of are time on their hands for practical jokes, or senses of humor.”

“Then maybe…”

The mild mannered man put his finger to his lips and shushed me. It was the last thing I expected. I shushed. “I think you need to listen. Mildred died long before I became a cop here. By the way, she was married to this much younger, very handsome man. Troy something. And Mildred–well you saw Mildred. She was worse for the wear tonight, I’m sure, but she was never a sexpot. After she died, Troy and a woman who ran an aerobics studio in town took Mildred’s money and moved to California. I heard all this from the chief who was here before me. So that was always queer.

But after she died, a few folks through the years have had little run-ins with her.”

“With the ghost of a slumlord?”

“Not sure ghost is the right word. Spirits are supposed to be noncorporeal. Everybody whose run into Mildred seems to think she’s about as corporeal as it gets, even still.”

I thought of the rotting face and bloody footprints and shuddered. “You’re not pulling my leg, are you?”

“I guess Mildred was a miser and a ball buster who nickel and dimed her way to a fortune. Whatever she is now, she’s still nickel and diming people. Most folks just give her what she wants, and that’s that.”

“I see.”

“Of course some folks haven’t given her what she wanted.”

I stared at him.

“That’s gone real, real bad for some folks,” he noted. “I guess whatever Mildred is now, she’s real strong and real mean.”

“So I should what?”

“You said she thinks your rent is 220? Well if I was you I guess I’d put 220 in an envelope and write Mildred’s name on it and leave it taped to your door. She’ll leave you alone.”

“I should pay rent. To a…revenant. On a house I’m also paying a mortgage on.”

He looked around. “220 a lot of money for you, doc?”

“Not really, but it’s the principle of the thing.”

“Yeah, there’s that. But I don’t know what I can do for you if Mildred comes back and doesn’t get what she wants.”

“This is…kind of a lot.”

“Doesn’t have to be,” he noted, standing up and walking toward the door. “Sometimes the cost of doing business just gets a little weird. Folks forget that, but The Hills have a way of reminding us.”

For the next couple of months, I put 4 50 dollar bills and a 20 in an envelope and wrote “Mildred” on it and left the money taped to the outside of my door on the last day of the month. Once I heard some scuttling and some whooping outside, and the next month I didn’t even hear that but when I got up in the morning the envelope was gone and Mildred didn’t bother me.

But I don’t really like paying rent to a ghost and anyway, I’ve come to respect Mildred for whatever godawful tenacity and force of will keeps her running errands and collecting debts, so last night I put a couple of extra things in the envelope. I put a photocopy of her obituary from 1989, which I found in a Druid Hills Register on microfiche in the library, and I put in a handwritten note saying “Sorry to be the one to break this to you. They say Troy took all your money and moved to California with the girl he was cheating on you with. Bet a determined old girl like you can still find them wherever they are are now.”

Laying in bed after midnight, I heard the worst sounds. There was an anguished baying, a high pitched hysterical scream, and then a long string of the profanest profanities I have ever heard. In the morning the envelope was gone, as always, but a piece of paper was jammed under the door. In an angry, spidery handwriting it said “PAID IN FULL.”
