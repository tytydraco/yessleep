I think the big men upstairs know I’m journaling about this shit. I’m getting real tired of this dude watching me at night. But it’s not just at night anymore. 



My apartment is like fifteen or sixteen floors, so we got an elevator. I’m ‘bout half way up, so I just always take the elevator. Taking the stairs after a long day of just walking and walking is hell anyway, especially at my age.



I keep seeing that same kinda guy hanging out in the elevator. All smooth and almost fake looking. No hair, nothing. At first, I thought it was the same guy who watches me at night but what I’ve noticed is the difference in their head shape. The one in the elevator is a bit more squared, while the one who watches me at night is a bit more circular. Maybe they’re cousins.



I’ll nod at him or whatever when I get on, sometimes he even holds the button to keep the door open. I don’t feel any danger, but I don’t feel safe either. He doesn’t follow me off or onto the elevator. He’s always just there. Hanging out, staring at me. But he never moves his head to look at me, it’s only his eyes. 



One time, when I stepped off on my floor, I decided to turn around and watch him in the elevator. He just stayed on as always. We sat there for a good ten or fifteen minutes until someone called the elevator up to the fourteenth floor. 



He rode it up, and I waited, peering through the little window on the doors waiting for it to come back down. I wanted to see if he was still on it. The elevator is a little old, a little slow, so I was able to get a good look into the elevator when it passed back down my floor. There was a guy on it, probably going to work, but the weird dude wasn’t on it. He just disappeared.  



One night, I brought home a pack of beer. I had already cracked into them on my way home. Stepping onto the elevator to ride with my little friend, I had a thought. I wondered if these dudes drank anything? Did they eat? I was curious to find out.



So, as I gave him my usual nod as I stepped onto the elevator, I tossed him a can. His reflexes were pretty sharp, caught it no problem, and my drunken little toss was terrible. Even in the tight space of the elevator, I managed to be way off target. I guess I had already been drinking at Lar’s earlier too, so that probably helped me nail that toss. 



It’s the first time I ever tried to say anything to either of them. I stood next to him and his eyes followed me as usual. I raised my can in a little “cheers" motion, said "cheers", and took a drink. He just held his, said nothing.



So it seems they don’t drink nothing. Can’t even have a little fun with a beer. Although, now every time I ride the elevator, he's just holding that can. I wonder if I gave him other stuff he’d just hold it forever. I bet I could do something funny with that. 



You’d think instead of just watching me they’d shut down my internet access or confront me. I’ve seen them do it to others. Whether it was mentioning something about the job or life on base online or on a piece of paper, didn’t matter. It’s been so secret, so I’m confused as to why I am the exception. 



Anyway, now I got two of those weird dudes watching me around my apartment. I hope it stays only those two. Where are they coming from?



Every night when I get home my door is always slightly ajar. I’m sure that the dude in the elevator has to call it and step on himself, right? He works the buttons just fine. 



But what’s odd is that I’ve never seen any evidence of them leaving. Leaving the elevator, leaving my apartment. They are gone in the blink of an eye. I’ve stopped really thinking much of it though. It’s crazy what you can get used to when it happens all the time.



Jose is still gone, he’s been gone for a good minute. I was hoping I’d see him around Lar’s. But I haven’t, haven’t seen his girl around either. They replaced her at Lar’s pretty quickly. 



New girl’s pretty stand out from the rest. Rather than being that crackhead bimbo, she seems fairly fit. All the dudes love her, but she doesn’t love any of the dudes. She just does her job and leaves. 



She ain’t tryna play into any dudes second heads for a chance at a second paycheck. I respect that. Suppose you still pay for her to love you, but in the way all strippers do. Hold up a bill and you might get a little attention.  And she's got some nice boobs. It’s nice to see a pair that doesn’t have their nipples pasted on near their armpits rather than where they're supposed to be. Big balloons like that are only fun when you’re a kid.



Kinda makes me wonder though, why is she here? Makes me wonder why I am here? I keep saying I try not to think about it. But I guess I am, this journal is proof of that. 



As I stated in my last little entry, stuff has sped up around here. New people come in faster, and old folks die faster. Feels like the people running the show have kinda gone into panic mode over what happened a little bit back.



I’ve worked almost every day. I’m taking my time off  to write here (and drink more than usual). 



The maze has been odd. As stated last time everything has kinda moved around. People are becoming more hesitant to follow the red string, which has always been so safe. 



A couple days back we were doing the usual. Strolling through the maze, heading to the starting point, which was a good half day’s walk deep. But, halfway through our walk to the starting point, the dude behind me started leaking blood everywhere.



It started when a pimple on his face popped. Nobody thought much of it, but his little grunt of pain did cause us to pause for a minute. A couple guys looked down instead of at the guy in pain, thinking we maybe had accidentally walked past a dead end marker. But we was still following that red string.



So, we took a few more steps forward, and there was a little grunt of pain again. Same dude. That's when we all just stopped and turned to face him. The guy was wearing short sleeves despite the cold, so we were able to see what was happening. 



Little spots all over him boiled up and popped, instantly leaking blood. 



A few popped and spat something fierce at a couple of the guys closer to him, aka me. His blood smelt a little nasty, and I was wondering if it was really blood. It was kind of thick, and its color a little more yellowy red. Kinda like a pimple I guess, when you pop it and the puss and blood mix. Foul shit.



Everyone just watched as he slowly turned pale and collapsed. What else could we have done? There was this newer guy, though, in our group that day. He started freaking out and kept trying to plug the holes, but it did nothing. He was dying, that was for damn sure, seemed he knew it too. He never panicked, just occasionally let out a little yip when one boil was a little bigger than usual. 



We cut the string and replaced it with a blue marker to mark the new dead end, pulled the old string in so nobody would go that way anymore, and headed back. I saw my little friend in the elevator and took the biggest shower ever. I think I scrubbed for a good hour or two. 



The one dude trying to plug all the holes got the brunt of the nasty fluid spurting out of him. If I scrubbed for an hour only cause of a little bit of that gnarly shit hitting me, I wonder if he's even done showering yet. 



Stepping out my shower, I found myself staring dead at the polaroid of that one new guy’s baby momma and his baby. It was just resting on the mirror of my bathroom. I had thought I had thrown it away. Guess not. Sometimes, I still can feel the bits and pieces of him stuck all over my back. Sometimes when I run my hands through my hair, I swear I can feel more chunks still  being pulled out. 



Still felt a little greasy too from the blood and pus on me, despite my desperate scrubbing.



Based on our report of the little pimple explosion, we were sent to the dead end the next day where previously, another pimple explosion was reported to have happened.  So you know, smart dudes and all their tech did their research, found the dead end with the similar report, and had us go there. It’s become a part of the routine now. If you find a dead end has moved, you gotta go back the next day or same day to take the marker of the dead end, then continue exploring the maze from there. 



When we got to the marker, and the leader reached down to grab it, he missed. There was a wobble in his feet, as if someone gave him a light shove. A couple of guys laughed hard, few snickered, I stood and watched. 



“Drink too much this morning?” One guy teased.



“Nah, I don’t drink in the morning man.” The leader responded.



He reached down again to grab it, and that's when we all felt it. A shift in the ground, like a little earthquake or something. Caused us all to wobble a little, the leader missed his grab again. 



“Told you man! I don’t drink in the morning!” He blurted out, taking pride in his proof of sobriety. 

  
“Fuck was that?” The mule asked. 



When the leader looked back towards the rock, it had actually moved forward away from us, or did we move back away from it? Couldn’t tell you, but it was odd for sure. We brushed it off and carried on. Replaced the rock and started a fresh line of red string.



Eventually we hit a few new dead ends. People died, you know the drill, and then got called to come back.



We gave the report about the shaking and shifting. Apparently it wasn’t the first, there's been a bunch of it happening actually. Sure I suppose the new happenings are surprising, but what was more surprising was the fact that for once, the suits and scientists informed us of something happening.



For once, we didn’t really feel like lemmings. I mean I suppose a lot of the weird stuff happening outside of the maze too was something. They haven’t informed us on that, so to an extent I kinda feel like I’m the only one experiencing it. 



That would be bad. Maybe it was a mind invisible dead end whatever the fuck. That would mean, there would have been two dead ends in one spot. That's worst case scenario, but with the disappearance of Jose, I highly doubt that's the case. 



But we haven’t heard anything about stuff happening outside of the maze, on base, so I’m finding myself overthinking things. But I guess here moving forward, I’ll just drink more at Lar’s to keep my thoughts at bay. Gives me a good excuse to get some beer and wings anyway.
