I don't have any idea from where to start from but here I am .

Sorry for any kind of typing mistakes as I am on my phone 

I and my family lives in big old rustic mansion located in sparsely populated remote area .
Their are more than 50 rooms in my house but only 5 of them have electricity connection and other rooms are either empty or filled with old rustic furniture.

Their are many hidden door and hidden chambers in my house that I still don't know about every chamber .

I live with my grandparents and my sister .

My grandparents always restricted me from going to any chamber or hidden room after dark 

My grandpa went out of station for some reason and my grandma goes to dairy farm daily for bringing milk .Since dairy farm is quite far away from my house my grandma goes at 4am and returns after 8 am .

Most of time I am alone at home but I still don't go upstairs in any dark room or any hidden chambers .
Their is old library in my house ,that mostly have old rustic book but also some of old books of computer science of my uncle .

I never went to library after dark since it don't have any electricity connection but I don't know why for sudden curiosity I sit their with a fire lamp for reading books .Some were old books of my uncle and most of them were really old book even before my father was born .

I just went on finding some interesting book in library and came across a book named "Maledictio "
I don't know what it means since English or any other language written in Roman script is not my first language as I am South Asian .

Infact the launguage written on it was not even English it just have English alphabets but still that book really attracted me may be due to its really attractive and different cover that stand out from every other book .

It was a book with brown coloured cardboard cover with golden floral design and dragons made up of copper at side of it at middle their was title of book .

It was a book like in purse shaped brown cardboard and has a lock kind of thing and I was unable to open it .

The book was given a series number like some old books in library.

So I went on searching in desk and drawers at library for a register that had all records of books kept at library on searching I found that register and then I found about that book .

It was a book written in Latin launguage .
It was written by an Anglo Indian priest around a century ago .I don't remember author's name right now  but the book had a lock and could be only opened by it's key but in register their was no mention where the key was kept .Then I started looking around and then remember while cleaning during festival recently I saw some keys ( most of them were normal keys but I remember one small copper key that has dragon kind of handle ) in one of chamber that has access to library .

So I went in chamber along with my fire lamp .

Suddenly from nowhere I felt a sensation and fire in lamp extinguished suddenly and then I hear someone calling my name from behind and I literally froze for a while .

When I came back to my senses then I ran away fr  as fast as possible.
