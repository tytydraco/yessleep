I was walking alongside the train tracks when I saw it at a distance. Some garbage, white and fluttering in the breeze. I kept walking and got curious as I got closer to it, then stopped when it was at my feet. A dirty white plastic shopping bag with a yellow smiley face and the text "HAVE A NICE DAY".

Just as I was noticing the long silvery hair dancing from out of the fluttering plastic and the faint rotten steak smell, the breeze suddenly changed directions, opening the bag to show me its contents.

I gasped and gagged at the same time. It was a head. A woman's head, and by the looks of her--not that I was a forensic expert or anything--but by the texture of her skin, dry and sunken and graying, she looked to have been dead for a few days. Her eyelids were half-closed, baring cloudy eyes of indeterminant color. I immediately pulled out my cell phone to call the police and had dialed 9-1-1 but hadn't initiated the call when I noticed something poking out from between her shrunken gray lips, between her bared teeth, something that gave me pause.

The corner of what could only be a bill--the gray-green betrayed it. I pocketed my phone and crouched down to look closer. The denomination of it was barely peeking out. A twenty.

Before I could let the gravity of what I was doing get to me, I pinched the corner of the bill between my fingers and gently tugged, then pulled it out. It was coated in sticky yellowish saliva and the corner that had been at the back of the throat was dyed brown with blood. But it was a twenty.

"I'll, uh--" I said out loud, stupidly. *I'll deal with this later.* I didn't want this DNA-slick bill in my possession when I called the cops.

I hurried back the way I came, dizzy and vibrating, and got back on the street and walked to the grocery store. In the bathroom I wiped the bill down as best I could and then went grocery shopping. I prayed the cashier would accept the bill in its state as I was standing in the checkout line and practically broke out in giggles of glee when she did.

Back at my dark studio apartment--the lightbulbs had long burnt out--I ripped some packages of ramen out of my new boxes of them and shoved the rest into the otherwise empty cupboard, then had a feast of chicken-flavored ramen soup. When my belly was full, the thought of the head returned to me. I thought of what to tell the police the next day.

It was still there when I returned to the same spot the following afternoon. 9-1-1 was dialed and my thumb was poised to send the call. There was a piece of paper sticking out from between its teeth, maybe something I'd missed yesterday that had probably been pulled out with the bill. I really wanted to know what it was but also kind of wanted to be done with this whole thing.

I stared into its cloudy irises for much too long. Of course I should have called the cops by now, but what if the paper was something good? Like a gift certificate for a free donut or something?

Finally, I put my phone away again and crouched down to pull out whatever it was, gently tugging it with two pinch fingers.

It was larger than I expected, folded up and shoved almost down its throat. Printer paper sized, staples still stuck in it at the top and bottom. When I carefully opened it, I was thoroughly disappointed. A job ad for some janitorial position at a local elementary school.

My gaze shifted from the filthy ad to the grimacing head. I couldn't envision how or why any of these items had ended up in its mouth at all. In my wonder I gave the ad a second look, which I wouldn't have done if I'd seen it posted on a telephone pole or whatever. Actually, I thought, it advertised a pretty good hourly rate. Better than any equivalent position I'd ever had, and certainly better than my cashier job I'd just lost.

Instead of calling the police, I carefully lifted the plastic bag by the handles with my sleeve covering my hand, not expecting how heavy a human head was, and quickly carried it nearby and out of sight, in a grassy impression at the base of an oak tree, nestled between the roots.

Before I left the head for the day, I slightly pried open its mouth to make sure I wasn't missing anything this time. All there was was a dry shriveled tongue. Then I covered it in fallen leaves and went home.

I don't know what I expected to happen by putting it there.

By the next evening, I had an interview scheduled for the job from the ad. The sun was sinking down behind the horizon when I went to go check on the head. I was almost a bit panicked when I couldn't remember where exactly I'd put it until I recognized the tree and its snake-like roots. I shined my phone light down at the ground and was a bit startled by the face and its grin peeking out from under the leaves.

It had something for me, shining out from between its teeth. I held my breath and stepped closer, cautiously, to make sure. A shudder shook my spine. There was a quarter, a dime, and a raspberry-flavored lollipop still in its wrapper.

I whirled around and shone my light all around me. Looking for what, I don't know. All there was was train tracks and gravel and trees. The only explanation I could think of at the moment was that whoever did this was coming back and shoving stuff in the head's mouth. But how had they known where I'd hidden the head? *I* had barely remembered where I'd hidden it.

But like, who the hell cares? I thought. Someone wanted to help me out. I felt like it was for me specifically. And I had this silly notion that maybe the head wanted to help me. It couldn't be that the killer wanted to help me because then that would mean I was a bad person for not calling the cops.

And I wasn't calling the cops. I arranged more cover for the head after plucking the little gifts from between its teeth, covering it with branches and more leaves, then went home.

I visited it almost every day. It didn't always have something for me, but it usually did. Mostly coins, little pieces of candy or cough drops still in their wrappers (which I didn't eat, just stowed away in a drawer), pages from coupon books, beads. But sometimes it was something really good, like another crumpled bill--it even brought me a ten once--and a couple of times some gift cards, though only one had a non-zero balance of a few dollars. Everything was dirty and seemed to have been scraped out of the gutter.

After getting hired for that job, I wasn't in desperate need of pocket change--I didn't struggle with rent anymore, I always had food in my kitchen. I kept going back because I felt like the head cared about me. It was a nice feeling and I tried not to think about how or why any of this was happening.

I dreamt about it anyway. There was a recurring nightmare I had for weeks. I stood at the top of a hill overlooking the train tracks, and the head was rolling slowly up to me, its frozen white face flashing in and out of view, and it would almost reach me but would roll back down again, as if it were too tired to go on. And then it would try again, and again. Sometimes *I* was the head. It was always that kind of dream you get when you're sleeping in an uncomfortable place and you're not fully asleep and the dream just goes on and on and you wake up exhausted and confused and nauseous. There was another one I had only once that I swore was real until I woke up. I was in bed watching the snowfall out my window one night when suddenly someone draped in what looked like a dirty bedsheet walked right up to my window and put their hand on the glass. They didn't have a head. I started awake and looked out the window and there was no one there.

On my birthday, I trudged through the snow to go visit the head. I hadn't visited it for like three days, probably the longest I'd gone without checking its mouth for anything. I just wanted to see if it had anything for me. Not that it mattered because my boyfriend, a teacher at the school, was taking me out for dinner later that day and getting me a present anyway. I just had to.

Sure enough, I uncovered the head from under its branches and pulled down the plastic bag from over its pale face and saw a couple of items sticking out from between its teeth. I picked out a dangly earring with tiny faux ruby stones still wet and dirty with slush.

The other thing I pulled out of its mouth was the ripped and soggy front cover of a card with a picture of a puppy playing with alphabet blocks that spelled out the letters "HAPPY BIRTHDAY". An adrenaline rush sent an ooze of cold sweat out of my pores. I dared to look into the head's shrunken eyelids, where its eyeballs had long sunken down into its sockets.

"How did you know it was my birthday?" I hissed, scrambling to my feet and backing away from it. A breeze picked up the edge of the plastic bag, covering the head with the yellow smiley face. HAVE A NICE DAY.

I quickly threw the branches back on the head and speed-walked away just as an approaching train started to rumble the ground.

I was shaken but kind of settled into my usual attitude about the situation. There was a severed head that gathered random garbage and pocket change for me, just like the sun always rises and sets and death and taxes, et cetera, et cetera.

I had a good time at my birthday dinner. My boyfriend suggested that we move in together. I said yes.

A few days later I visited the head and took the two dimes from its mouth and told it I was moving away and I wouldn't be able to come anymore. That there were always hobos walking along the tracks who might need its services. When I said it, a sort of dense, heavy silence hung in the air. I said an awkward, "Well, thanks for everything" and went away unceremoniously.

I kind of felt like an asshole for it, but it's not like this could go on forever. I wasn't going to take a bus every day just to retrieve whatever trash it found in the gutter. In fact, I thought I would finally call the cops about the head in the spring.

My boyfriend and I moved into a one-bedroom apartment in January. We were in the middle of loading things into the apartment when we decided to go out for a late lunch. When we came back that evening, I stayed planted in the doorway while my boyfriend went into the kitchen to put our leftovers in the fridge. Among the mountains of boxes and junk on the countertop sat a dirty white bag with a yellow smiley face on it. I don't know how he didn't smell it yet.

I asked him if he had brought that bag inside. Then he looked in the bag.

There was a torn piece of a greeting card clenched in its teeth that said "I love you".

The cops were suspicious of us at first, but we got cleared pretty quickly. Unfortunately there were no cameras in the halls or outside the building, so I never found out how the head got there. But there was someone just barely caught on a gas station security camera, just at the top of the frame of the video, carrying a white bag down the street during the right timeframe. They assume this person put the head there, but the video isn't detailed enough to be of much help in identifying them.

DNA tests found that the head belonged to a 54-year-old woman who had been reported missing the previous fall, shortly before I originally found the head by the train tracks. She was known to police through various run-ins with the law, mostly for shoplifting and prostitution.

But the most important thing I found out was that the head belonged to my biological mother, who had given me up for adoption when I was born. Because of this, I was able to make the decision about what to do with her remains. I had her head cremated and scattered her ashes in Lake Superior.

But the rest of her? That was never found.
