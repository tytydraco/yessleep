  
I was on the road alone, just trying to get back to the west coast after a rough year. I didn’t expect to end up posting here. 

But something happened on a stretch of road in southern West Virginia — something I still can’t explain. 

If anyone’s heard of a station called Highway 83 Radio… please tell me I’m not the only one

A dense fog clung to the road, swallowing the headlights as I drove deeper into the void of southern West Virginia. The silence pressed down on me, oppressive, suffocating. The low hum of the tires against the road was the only thing breaking it.

I was taking a cross-country trip to visit my family that I had moved away from on the west coast, while seeking solace and reconnection with myself after a year of life-altering events. I have had a lot of trouble adjusting to life here in the middle of nowhere, but after what had happened, I needed a fresh start.

There was nothing for miles in every direction, the only things around being myself and the rusty, four-door sedan that lacked not only heat and air conditioning but also a license plate that disappeared off it during the move. It feels like the white lines of the road are turning into a single blurry vision due to the sheer hours I’ve spent looking at them. My eyes flicked across the dashboard to the dimly lit analog clock. 2:18 A.M., it read. The energy drink that I drank hours before began to show signs of wearing off, and the half-drunk water bottle I had bought to accompany the energy drink sloshed slowly back and forth with the turns of the road under my seat.

With the effects of the energy drinks slowly wearing off, I knew it would only be a matter of time until I started to drift off to sleep while on the road yet again. To attempt and push this seamless never-ending need for sleep away, I turned on the radio and began to try and tune to a station.

At first there was nothing, just static. For channel after channel I searched, finding nothing but static. Eventually the entire radio seemed to jump to life, a soothing, even calming voice suddenly came onto the radio.

“*This is Highway 83 Radio. There are many options out there, so we thank you for listening to us on this dark and gloomy night.*”

After this short commentary from the host, what sounded like old-timey blues started pouring out of my speakers.

“Well, I don’t like the blues, but it’s better than listening to that damned water bottle for the next 50 miles,” I thought to myself.

As I began to fall deeper and deeper into the music, a sudden thought occurred to me: if I had spent so long searching for a station, why had the DJ mentioned choosing theirs over so many others? Also, that voice — that calm voice — it sounded so familiar, as if I had heard it on a previous drive.

After throwing these thoughts around for a couple of minutes, I decided to just throw it up to my old rust bucket of a car not having a good enough antenna to pick up on the other stations in the rural areas of West Virginia.

As soon as this thought left my mind, the music suddenly stopped and back on came the DJ:

“*You would be incorrect, listeners. There is nothing strange about Highway 83 Radio. Except for the fact we are always willing to listen to our listeners.*”

And just like that, back to the blues.

At this point, I became extremely unnerved and freaked out. It was one thing for my car to have a busted antenna, but for the DJ to perfectly know what I was thinking — there just had to be something wrong.

I had the urge to pull off somewhere and just sleep the night away, thinking that all the caffeine and lack of sleep had finally caught up to me. Had I not been nearly 45 minutes from any form of a town or parking lot to sleep in, I decided to just keep pushing until my booked hotel only 45 miles away at this point.

When suddenly the radio went dead.

I smacked the radio, which usually seemed to work, and still nothing. Suddenly it burst back to life, with an ear-piercing static that clawed at my ears and sent shivers down my spine, which nearly made me lose control of the car.

I regained control, and the voice crackled through the static, warped and distorted, as if it was speaking from some long-forgotten place — a place where the laws of time and space no longer applied.

“How sure are you that you are alone?” the voice said.

At this point I was fully freaking out. I knew I was alone. I have been alone in this car for a full day now.

The voice spoke again.

“*You are wrong. Do not look behind you. Keep looking at the road and they cannot get to you.*”

Thinking that this was some kind of joke, but partially because I was getting truly horrified at this point, I went to turn around just to make sure, when the voice on the radio suddenly screamed:

“*DON’T.*”

Every fiber of my being screamed at me to turn and look, to know what was creeping behind me, but the radio’s voice — a command wrapped in fear — pulled me back.

“*Don’t*.”

It wasn’t a warning anymore. It was a plea.

My heart rate seemed to hit a new high, and I couldn’t help but think that I was seeing shadows of movement in the rearview mirror. I kept driving down the road, tears beginning to well up in my eyes.

“This can’t be happening to me,” I thought.

The voice on the radio returned, still covered in static and seeming increasingly strained as it continued.

“*All you must do is what I tell you, and I can keep them from you. Just stay on the road, in about 2 miles take a right*.”

I continued to drive. 2 miles pass and nothing. There is no road, there is no turn off — hell, there is nothing but brush and dead grass.

The voice came back, louder, meaner than before.

“*You think you can just do what you want, huh? Just do what you want and whatever happens, happens*.”

“What is happening? What are you talking about?” I screamed into the radio, expecting a response — as crazy as that still sounds.

“*Do you think I don’t know? Do you think we all don’t know what you did?*”

The voice on the radio screamed, the anger making the voice come through as clear as if it were a person sitting next to me.

In that instant, I understood. The voice was not trying to get me to do anything at this moment — it was trying to make me confront my deepest and darkest truths. The reason I moved here, the reason I ran from my past — it wanted me to remember the blood that is on my hands.

About a year prior to me moving here, I had been in a car accident — not a little fender-bender either. I mean a full-on, fiery, no-one-is-sure-how-I-survived car crash. I had been out late one night, had a couple of drinks, on maybe 3 hours of sleep, and decided that I was still okay to drive home.

I was about 10 minutes away from my house driving down the road, when I started to drift. I wish it had been off the road or any other direction, but instead it was directly into the oncoming lane. I collided head-first with another car that immediately burst into flames.

I was hurled from the wreckage, my body crashing hard back down into the earth. The impact rattled me to my core. As my body skidded across the asphalt, I laid there knowing I would die. And suddenly I saw lights.

The paramedics had brought me back to life, and treated me for my wounds, which for the crash were minimal — limited to only a couple of broken ribs, an arm, a deflated lung, and a fractured fibula.

The driver of the other car, however, did not make it. The memory of that night haunted me, like a shadow that followed me wherever I went — suffocating me with its weight, a constant reminder of my reckless choices and the consequences of them.

Their life had ended abruptly and for no good reason, consumed by flames, while I had the audacity and for some reason the ability to keep living — scarred but alive.

Even now, the guilt grew larger and took an even greater hold on me, an ever-growing shadow that grew darker with every living moment I spent on earth. The other driver was burnt so badly that they couldn’t I.D. the body. The car had no plates, and no one ever came forward with information.

I was charged and served my time, but the things that I did will never leave me.

Suddenly struck back to the present by headlights in the far distance down the road, I began to sob.

“Please, I will do anything. It was a mistake, and I wish I could take it back. I wish it could have been me,” I cried and begged to my empty vehicle — except for the shadowy figure seemingly growing by the second in the back seat, which I still dared not to look at.

The voice on the radio, much calmer — almost scarily calm after the yelling:

“*Do you truly mean that?*”

“Yes,” I cried. “Yes, it should have been me. I was dumb and it cost that person everything, and we never even knew who they were.”

The voice in response said only one thing:

“*You have always known who it was. Now check the back seat.*”

Accepting my fate for what I had done, I turned slowly, the weight of my guilt pushing down on me while tears streamed down my face. Each second seemed to stretch for an eternity, my breath catching as I braced for what shadowy nightmare might appear before me.

Finally, I turned completely, facing the backseat — and found nothing.

While looking back, I heard the radio finally cut back to nothing but static, just as it was at the beginning.

Confused and crying, I turned around just in time to see the headlights of the oncoming car suddenly drift into my lane.

The worst part wasn’t the crash, or the burning, searing pain I felt as my skin cooked off the meat and my bones.

It was the fact that when I looked into that other car, I could have sworn I saw myself looking back at me.
