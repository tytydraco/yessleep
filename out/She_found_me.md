I was up late scrolling on bumble and this girl that I knew popped up, so I swiped right, but I didn't think we'd match. The next day I wake up to the notification she had matched with me, I was pleasantly surprised and we started talking. I had met her a few times in group settings, we had chatted quite a bit and got along well, so at some point in the conversation she mentioned that she had a large stash of weed, but nobody to smoke with, I took the hint and said I'd smoke with her and she immediately jumped to making plans to meet up and smoke. She's cute and I've enjoyed talking to her so I was excited, but then our conversations became very odd.When we were talking I had asked about making intentions known and she said "what do you think my intentions are", not knowing if that was playful banter or just a genuine questioned I answered her honestly. I said "I honestly don't know. I have no intentions. I've enjoyed talking to you and I've enjoyed when we've hung out. If you wanna just hang out, smoke, and see where things go, that's cool with me" she said she also had no intentions with me. The conversations became a little more flirty After that but then she seemed to get very nervous talking to me, and I understand why but something about the way she behaved now that there were some romantic implications to our interactions made me uncomfortable. We had already made plans to hang out that coming Thursday, but at this point I'm just waiting to get it over with.

 She comes over in nice clothes with her makeup done, and I noticed her legs were freshly shaved, that surprised me a little because she had always been much more casual when I had seen her in the past, and it made me wonder if she intended this to be a date. I quickly learned she very much wanted this to be a date. We sat on my couch and started talking but she kept staring at my lips and seemed very uncomfortable. It felt like she clearly wanted/expected more out of this than what had been discussed when I had been deliberate about making intentions clear and known. Maybe that was naive of me but now I felt kinda trapped because she clearly thought this was gonna be a date and I'm not prepared to give her that nor do I want to. We didn't end up smoking but we took some edibles and spent a long time talking about basically nothing and then I asked if she wanted to watch some TV and she said sure so we picked out a show together and turned it on. We watched that for a while when my roommate came home and she got really uncomfortable and kinda rushed out the door even though my roommate actually left the room and we were still alone. She thought we'd have total privacy and got uncomfortable when she realized that wasn't an option.

I felt like I had dodged a bullet but then a few days later I was going to see a play and mentioned it to her, so she got tickets for the same night. There was no assigned seating so when I sat down to watch the show she came and sat next to me. I was really uncomfortable that she just showed up and kinda sprung this on me and was trying to turn it into a date, but that was the situation I was in so i tried to just enjoy the show, but at some point during the show she leaned her head on me, and as uncomfortable as I was I didn't want to hurt her feelings so I just let this happen. I enjoyed the play anyway despite this and when I came back from the bathroom during intermission I went to a different seat, she took the hint and didn't sit next to me. She left in the middle of the show and I kinda figured that'd be the end of it. She left the group that we had met through so I figured I wouldn't be seeing her again, at least on purpose. The next day she texts me like nothing ever happened. I decided I was okay with this for whatever reason and just decided to continue speaking to her like nothing happened as well. I wasn't showing any romantic interest, but if she messaged me I'd reply, but I definitely wasn't going to tell her about my plans again, the last thing I need is her popping in on me again and forcing a date on me. 

A while later I was in her city and I ran into her out and about. I was happy enough to see her so when she offered a hug I obliged, but she held it a little too long, it just made me slightly uncomfortable, but I also know she has issues in social situations, so I don't think much of it. We talked for a little bit and she asked what I was up to in the city, so I told her I was just taking a stroll and popping into shops on my way, but I was in the city go begin with because I was doing a play there. She asked where and when so I told her, and we both went on our way. 

The next few rehearsals I felt like I was being watched when I stepped outside to smoke, and I saw something large moving quickly in my peripheral vision. We have some animals that can look pretty large out of the corner of your eye, but it almost looked like a person, still, I didn't think much of it.

Around this same time a friend of mine stopped responding to my messages on snapchat and stopped posting anything, a few days later she told me she had been hacked. She was still trying to get the account back so I didn't bother blocking whoever hacked her. 

Most of you can probably guess where this is going, but I certainly didn't. My friend got her account back and at the same time I stopped seeing that shadow when I went outside. I thought that was creepy and I did make that connection, but I didn't think that girl had anything to do with it. Around this time she started asking me where I was sometimes or if I had rehearsal on particular evenings, I didn't make that connection so I told her and I noticed that shadowy creature returned. 

If you haven't put it together she had hacked my friends snapchat account and been using the snap map to find when i was at the theater, then when she lost access to that she started just asking me and showing up. One night I was outside with a friend talking when I noticed that shadowy thing again and mid conversation I flashed my flashlight at it. It was her, she moved fast but not fast enough to not recognize her. She was out of sight almost as fast as she was there and I had no clue where she was. My friend walked me to my car because I was nervous and we hugged goodbye before I got in my car and started driving. I noticed another car following me home, the windows were tinted so I couldn't see who it was but I figured it was her, so I didn't go home. I drive an RV so I basically just focused on trying to lose her so I could just go find a spot to camp for the night.

I managed to lose that car that was following me, I waited 3 hours before even trying to go to sleep, she was definitely long gone. I wasn't 100% certain it was her but I couldn't think of anyone else it could be. I got a good night's sleep and decided it was time to hit the road again anyway, so I left that city after my show was done and moved back to my home with my mom. She let's me park in her driveway for free so I basically still live there, just not in the house. I still payed the rest of this month's rent to my former roomie. I know finding a replacement takes time. 

That girl tried to message me a couple times like nothing had happened but when i ignored her she got the hint. I'm not totally certain that she hacked the account or that that car that followed me was her, but I definitely know I saw her outside the theater. 

I've gone camping near where she lives a couple times and I have been nervous, but nothing has happened yet. In case any more friends of mine get hacked I've turned off my snap map. I also blocked her from seeing my Instagram stories and my account is private so unless she hacks my friends on Instagram she won't know where I am, and I don't post where I am often. I'm glad my lifestyle involved a lot of moving around. My mom hasn't said anything about noticing her hanging around at her place, and she does know where my mom lives, but I'll keep you guys posted.
