Blood rushes to my ears.

“Wh-what?” I whisper.

My stomach drops.

&#x200B;

The Shinigami speaks on, it’s great voice rumbling around my head: “**The yokai has taken the form of your partner,** ***Minami***. **The true Minami remains captive. Behold**”.

Light shines from behind me.

I turn, and I see that that Shinigami has allowed me to see through the walls.

I see my girlfriend.. Or… or what I THOUGHT was my girlfriend, huddled on the bed of our room… And above her…

…Above her, is Minami.

There are two of them.

One below, and one above.

The one above is trapped in crystal. That same substance spread out across the windows and the surfaces of the shelves, only in much, much greater quantity. She is frozen in the glass-like substance, though her eyes are wide. They dart to mine, full of terror, and the vision through the walls is lost.

My head pounds with dismay.

“WHAT DO I DO, SHINIGAMI?” I cry out loud as the winds whip round and around. “WHAT DO I DO?”

“**Let me in, Takuya**”, the Shinigami replies. “**Let me in and I shall root her out. Remove the restrictions you have placed upon my entry, and allow me in. I will take care of the rest**”.

And with this the Shinigami fades back into the mists. The walls re-harden and the bathroom returns to the way it was before, with little more than a miniscule burst of plaster from the ceiling.

The flame of the candle flickers from white, back to orange, then fizzles out entirely, and I become simply a man sat alone in the dark on his bathroom floor.

&#x200B;

“Minami…” I whisper, heart aching.

&#x200B;

Terrified, but full of renewed purpose I rise to a cautious stand and slowly open the door with a creak.

&#x200B;

…The hallway is dark.

&#x200B;

*Was it a trick?* I can’t help but think. *Is the Shinigami trying to convince me to just open the doors and let it in?*

To my left is the bedroom, to my right, the kitchen.

&#x200B;

I hesitate.

&#x200B;

*Fuck, I don’t know what to do.*

The Shinigami said that I didn’t have much time. Why do I trust this monster more than my own girlfriend?

…I decide to creep to the right. My heartstrings are pulled taut and tight, they *beg* me to return to the bedroom, but my head urges me on. I head into the kitchen, and with shaking hands begin carefully- and as quietly as possible- removing cups of tea. Pouring them down the sink, one at a time.

&#x200B;

“…What are you doing, Takuya?” Minami asks from behind me.

“Fuck!” I blurt out as I drop the cup into the sink with a clatter, spinning around.

&#x200B;

Minami stands there in the darkness of the doorway, hands at her sides, watching me.

Sweat buds on the back of my neck.

“I- uh, the passages, Minami. I think I’ve found one that’s going to work. I’m going to face the Shinigami head on, no more hiding”.

“Takuya, don’t be stupid. We just have to hold out for one more day and we’ll be safe, this is too dangerous”.

*Just one more day.*

I let out a quiet, anxious laugh. “Sure, yeah, okay. I’ll put this stuff back, I guess”.

Minami watches from the doorway as I return the items.

She turns back to the hallway, glancing over her shoulder. “Come on, let’s get back to the bedroom. Help me barricade it, okay?”

“Of course”, I reply, and as she turns I quickly and silently grab up the ceremonial knife from the table, stowing it into my waistband.

Minami waits for me to catch up with her and she slips her hand into mine.

&#x200B;

…It feels cold.

&#x200B;

I have to force myself not to flinch or recoil.

*What the hell is wrong with me? This is MINAMI. My GIRLFRIEND. This is insane. Should I really trust a monster’s word over hers?*

But the seeds of doubt have been planted.

&#x200B;

Once in the bedroom Minami releases me to go to the bathroom. I take this opportunity to glance up to the shadows above the bed. To the place where the Shinigami showed me the crystal. The crystal with the *real* Minami trapped inside.

I squint, but I can’t see it. It’s some trick, perhaps? Now that I look, that I REALLY look, it’s almost like the little light that the room allows is being *bent* somehow… Concealing an invisible shape….

&#x200B;

“What are you looking at?” Minami asks me.

My eyes drop to hers.

She’s staring right at me. I didn’t even see her turn around. How did she do that? She didn’t even leave my field of vision.

&#x200B;

My throat has gone death dry. I can feel it crack as I force out my words.

&#x200B;

“Nothing”, I reply quietly, and unconvincingly.

&#x200B;

There is a long, strained silence. It stretches, and I can almost hear the threads snap… one, by, one.

She doesn’t move, and neither do I.

The tension grows. I have to do something, say something before it becomes too much.

“Minami-”

She steps towards me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

…And I take a step in retreat.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Her eyes widen.

&#x200B;

*Fuck.*

&#x200B;

The shadows darken and the tension snaps. Her face contorts with frustration and she runs right at me, eyes wide and white and angry, and I panic. I stagger back in alarm and draw the blade from my waistband in a wide and warning arc.

“STAY BACK!” I shout out loud, and she stops at once, all hatred vanished from her face in place of fear.

Sadness. She looks me at with eyes full of accusation. Of betrayal, and my heart hurts in response.

I falter and lower the blade a little. What the hell am I DOING?

“Minami…”

And the rage returns.

For a second, just a split-second, I catch a glimpse of something behind her face. Something inhuman, and she rushes me. Screaming.

I cry out loud with terror as she grips onto me, we crash to the wall and belongings fall from the shelves, I fling her off of me to the chest of drawers and race from the room, slamming the door tight shut behind me.

“WHO ARE YOU?” I shout through the door, “WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH MINAMI?”

I grab the lampstand in the hall and shove it up against the door. The lamp tumbles to the floor and smashes. I turn and run to the kitchen, kicking away the cups of tea and tearing down the wallpaper that I scrawled the mantra passages all over.

I grab up the hammer and start smashing away the barricades on the window. I reach through and grasp the handle, throwing the window wide open.

I start hastily pushing away the furniture we stacked against the door, as quickly as I feasibly can as the shadows swim across the walls and up the ceiling like water.

I shoot a terrified glance over my shoulder, though there is only the hallway, and shadow.

&#x200B;

“Takuya!” comes the voice of Minami from the bedroom. “Please, HELP! It’s going to KILL ME!”

***What’s*** *going to kill her?* I think to myself as I sweat and panic. *And who’s voice am I hearing? WHICH Minami?*

It’s all so cruel. Such cruel and dangerous tricks and lies.

“HOW COULD YOU LIE TO ME, MINAMI?” I shout out in response as I haul away one of the cupboards we’d stacked against the door.

I wrote some of the mantra passages directly onto the wall itself, and as there is no wallpaper to tear away here I start throwing water up against it instead. Soap. Desperately scrubbing.

I start to wonder if perhaps this was why ‘Minami’ was so against the use of the mantras. They work on spirits, after all. Not just Shinigami, but shape-shifting yokai too, perhaps.

I hesitate.

Should I start reciting one?

I look to the door as the walls begin to rumble.

I need the Shinigami. I can’t risk casting it away… But will the passages also work on the thing in Minami’s skin?

&#x200B;

“…Your hesitation will be your death, Takuya”, whispers a voice just above my head.

&#x200B;

I look up in alarm to see Minami spread out across the ceiling. Like a spider, or a lizard. Her neck has turned 180 degrees, and her face stares down into mine.

I scream and jump away to the corner of the room. My hands scrabble for the knife… But it’s not there. I must have put it down as I was moving the furniture. My eyes scan the room, but I cannot see it.

&#x200B;

Minami starts to creep across the ceiling towards me in the darkness.

“I was so close to a perfect transformation”, she mutters, her voice sounding less and less like the Minami I know with every word.

“So close to avoiding detection…”

Her tongue slithers out from her mouth and licks her teeth in frustration.

“But that tattoo… That damned tattoo. So difficult to copy. I was close. So, so close. But I just couldn’t get it right…”

I glance to her leg.

The tattoo is nothing more than a mess of lines and spirals, now.

The yokai has given up, it would seem.

&#x200B;

Again I catch a flicker of the monster behind her face.

And she leaps from the ceiling towards me.

I jump back a few paces and sprint down the hall to the bedroom. Looking up and over the bed, looking in the shadows… But I cannot see the crystal that the Shinigami showed me. I get that same sense that I did before, that there is *something* concealed here out of sight, that some object of significant mass occupies the empty space… but I just can’t see it. I jump up onto the bed and start waving my arms.

“Minami!” I shout out-

\-And my hand connects with something invisible. As it does so, little shards of dust-like crystal start raining down.

And the yokai appears from a dark corner, screaming as it wrestles me to the ground with a sharp thud.

“I was so CLOSE!” it hisses through Minami’s lips, now dry and cracked. “Just a little longer… That’s all I need, and you will be RIPE Takuya. She grips my wrist and pins me to the ground with a sudden flow of strength. Her eyes glow like shards of amber. “The crystallisation ruins the taste, but I’ve expended too much effort to quit now...”

Crystals start appearing from her palms and fingertips. They spread and grow like a glue and bind me to the floorboards. It flows like a mist, and little dust-like traces of the crystal start forming on the edges of the bedposts.

“NO!” I shout out, bringing a hand up to her face and forcing a thumb into her eye. She shrieks and retracts her hand, and with a burst of force I am able to break myself from the crystal shackle, sending shards of the stuff flying out in all directions.

I stagger back, avoiding a swiping claw, and retreat rapidly the hallway, back into the kitchen, throwing all the doors closed behind me, as I did before. The walls are shaking with greater fervour now. The sink full of cups is rattling loud, mist has begun to creep in through the open window, broken barricade litters the floor…

...And there. There on the counter, is the knife. I rush over and grab it up at once, pushing aside the last of the furniture and freeing the door to the front-door-hallway, and I swing it wide open.

An icy rush of air billows into the room, and I turn to see Minami stood silently and furiously in the doorway, her neck cracked to the side at an impossible angle. Her eyes are embers in the darkness, and one is bruised.

I hold out the knife in shaking hands.

“Don’t make me hurt you” I mutter, and the yokai spits on the ground, eyes never leaving mine.

“You don’t have the constitution, Takuya”, she replies, and with a motion of sickening speed she darts towards me.

My back is pressed up against the wall in terror, and as she rushes forwards…

&#x200B;

…She *trips.*

&#x200B;

Her amber eyes go wide in surprise as she stumbles to the floor, balance lost as she trips over a small dark blur by her feet.

A dark blur with one green eye, one blue.

She staggers towards me and I side-step at once, watching as she stumbles right past…

…and into the waiting arms of the Shinigami.

&#x200B;

It brings with it the wind and the mist. Around and around the room they go. The yokai struggles and screams in the Shinigami’s grip. “HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TAKUYA?” she screams in Minami’s voice, one last desperate trick, a final attempt to win me back to her side, but it is too late.

The wings of the Shinigami stretch and ripple and it looks down at me, extending a ghostly, flickering hand in thanks as the yokai’s cries devolve into an animalist screeching. Minami’s skin starts falling away and the horror beneath is gradually revealed.

The Shinigami uses one of its fingers to draw a symbol on the yokai’s forehead, a symbol I do not recongise.

“**I will take it from here Takuya. Your house will be returned to your plane. Once I have removed the yokai, Minami’s prison should become clear, and weak. Thank you**”.

And the Shinigami says no more. It turns with a rush of wind and disappears through the hall. It folds in its wings and flows like water through the open front door, taking the flailing, screaming yokai along with it.

…And as quickly as the winds arrived, they go. They follow the Shinigami out with a rippling blast, and a now-battered picture still hanging on the wall collapses at last to the floor with a crunch.

The front door is closed behind the Shinigami, and there is peace.

&#x200B;

Just like that.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Quiet.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I stand there for a moment, like an idiot, watching as the cat jumps up onto the table and settles into place. Watching me.

&#x200B;

*…Minami.*

&#x200B;

I rush to the bedroom, and there she is- just above the bed. Embedded in crystal, in plain sight.

“Minami!”

I jump up onto the mattress and start bashing and clawing away at the crystal hung impossibly in mid-air.

It doesn’t take much effort. The crystal crumbles into dust at my touch, and as Minami is gradually freed she is able to help in her own rescue attempt. Helping, until at last the crystal dissolves into nothing and she falls right into my arms.

She cries, then, for a long time. And I hold her. Us two, together, in the wreck of our house.

&#x200B;

\*

&#x200B;

**Day seventeen.**

Within the next hour of that sixth day our house had been returned to our neighbourhood. Looking out the window provided sights of a blue sky, of leaves blowing gently in the breeze, of people going about their days, and of cars driving calmly down the road.

We spent the day doing our best to clean our home, then that evening we went out to get food. Just the two of us. To get out of the house, essentially. We wanted, no, NEEDED a little space. Some distance from the horrors of the past week.

Minami has suffered greatly. Six days she spent trapped in that crystal. Six days unable to move, unable to speak, simply watching.

…Trapped. Frozen.

I dread to think what she must have seen. It hurts my heart to think of what torture that must have been for her.

She’s healing though, we both are. And the house is looking better by the day.

I don’t know how our home became ‘infected’ exactly, nor why the yokai chose to copy and shapeshift into Minami, but these I suppose are mysteries for another day.

&#x200B;

…The cat stuck around, by the way.

It purrs against my legs tonight, and hops up into my lap as I sit alone in the office. Illuminated only by the dim blue glow of my laptop screen. The glow shines also on the edges of my little wooden kappa. I decided to move it here, onto my desk.

It has a crack in its base, unfortunately. One I hadn’t noticed before. Damaged in the destruction, most likely, but then again I didn’t actually *check* the base when I took it out of our suitcase, so I guess it could have been damaged all along, or cracked in transit.

Ah well. It still looks nice.

&#x200B;

I reach out and adjust it, before returning to my work.

&#x200B;

It’s 2am. Minami fell asleep hours ago.

I glance over my shoulder and peer down the hallway, just to make sure, but she’s still sleeping, for sure.

So I get back to it. Peering close to the screen. Clicking away.

My obsession.

&#x200B;

I’ve been looking through old pictures of us. Of Minami and I. Holiday pictures mostly, searching desperately.

I began this process on day two, of course, but I’ve redoubled my efforts.

I need to find a picture of her tattoo. Just one. Just ONE good, quality picture.

&#x200B;

I locate a picture of Minami at the tattoo parlour, squealing with excitement as the artist begins his work. But he has barely started.

I find plenty of us at the beach, but her leg is always just ever so slightly tilted away from the camera. Every damned time. Even in the candid shots.

I search my phone. All the pictures she sent me when she first got the thing, they were through Snapchat, and have now long-disappeared.

She’ll have some on her *own* phone, surely. She must do. I don’t know why I didn’t think of this sooner. I’ll have a look tomorrow if I’m unsuccessful again tonight. I can work out her passcode. Shouldn’t be too difficult.

&#x200B;

I check through her Facebook, her Instagram, but always, nothing. Nothing.

&#x200B;

Because you see, readers, the problem is that whilst everything might be going back to normal, whilst everything is slowly healing… I cannot shake this terrible, lingering doubt.

My girlfriend’s tattoo is supposedly fixed, now. Back to the way it was.

And why wouldn’t it be?

This is no shape-shifter, trying to emulate an intricate design. This is Minami. The girl who got the tattoo herself. The tattoo that remains unchanged and permanent on her skin.

&#x200B;

…And yet…

&#x200B;

…And yet I could have *sworn* that grey heron faced the opposite way.
