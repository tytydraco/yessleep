We have asked the students that live at the Psihology Univercity campus if they want to be part of an experiment, we would pai them 1000$ at the end. 

The experiment consists of putting the students in separare white rooms for one week and monitor them. 

We've got 3 volunteers. In the next notes I will be reffering about them by S1, S2, S3, S standing for subject. 

Day 1: 

Everyone seemes to be doing just fine, the subjects are sleeping for most of the time. Although they are alright for now, I think that'll change in the next days. 

I find it rather difficult and anoying living in a white box, the only color you see is white, even your chlotes matching the envitoment. 

Day 2: 

Still, nothing particular interesting, apart from S2, witch is talking more to himself and thinking out loud. I don't really know what you can thing about in there, but everyone has to busy their time by doing something. 

Day 3: 

The madness is starting to get to them. Everyone is starting to show diffrent signs of suffering from the experiment. 

S1 is moving in circles continuously and hitting his head with his arms like his felling mosquitos biting his ceeks. 

S2 is talking more and more, sometimes laughting histericaly and falling on the ground. 

S3 is hitting his head off the walls. Luckly they are made out of fome so he can't hurt himself. 

All of them had one thing in common, yelling "Let me out!". 

Day 4: 

The subjects are starting to prezent halicinations. S2 and S1 have been seen talking to someone, exept, there's no one else in there. 

S3 is crawling to the corners of the room with terror in his eyes, as if something is coming after him. We could hear him say "Stop!" and "Help!", but his voice was so low as if his neck was hurt. 

Day 5: 

The subjects haven't slept at all last night. All of them were very panicked all times. I have reviewed the photage and on camera in S3 room I have noticed some strange shadows on the walls. I have no idea what it was, but we can't intervine or the experiment would be ruined. 

S1 is doing better, at least that's what I think, he is sitting in the middle of the room staring at the camera. 

S2 has attacked the man who was bringing him food every day. He bit his arm. 

This experiment is starting to creep me out. 

Day 6: 

I couldn't sleep all night. S1 couldn't stop screaming, while staring at the camera. He hasn't moved an inch. 

S2 is hearing and seeing all sorts of things. He has described the halucinations as wind sounds and faces in tha walls taliking and talking. "I just want them to shut up.", he was saying. There were tears running out his eyes. 

S3 keeps on breathing rapidly and beeing more and more panicked saying "They are getting closer.", he has been repetting that for about 3 hours, but I don't think they know what time is anymore. 

What I was seeing in these rooms were not humans anymore. Thay all had lost weight and had dark circles arund their eyes. Every single emplyee was creeped out by them when going in to feed them or just watching the cams. 

Its like it isn't a form of torture just for them, but also for us, everyone seeing them or interacting in any way. 

Day 7: 

After this day I regret everything I hava done by starting this experiment. It all started at midnight when every subject said at the same time "They are here.". 

I felt the chills coming down my spine, while I looked at the crucifix hanged on the wall in the room I was standing in. 

Suddenly there were shadows surrounding all the subjects. 

S1 started taring his skin on his face apart with his nails. I guess he finally saw something else then white, the red blood. He was screaming, while he was dystroing his face. When the personal got in his room it was to late. I heard a crack and he felt dead on the floor. Once white, the floor was red. 

I imidiatly orderd the workers to go get all the students out of the rooms. Unfortunetly they were pussing the doors in vain, they weren't opening. I could just watch on the cams and take notes. 

S2 was in his knees begging for mercy, but there wasn't any, as his blood was just starting to drain out of his body throught his skin pores. 

I didn't know what were those shadows that circled them, I just knew they were killing them. 

S3 was hitting again his head of the walls, even tho they ware made out of fome, he was getting injured. Then finally the workers managed to enter. 

He was restrained and tyed up to a hospital bead. At least one of them got to live. 

Of curse, I don't consider that living, as he would come to become just another lab rat for another scientist.
