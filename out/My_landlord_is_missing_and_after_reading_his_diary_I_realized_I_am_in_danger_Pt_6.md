He continued touching my neck, gingerly stroking his bite marks. 

I looked away and tried to hide my grimace. “I have no one but you. I don't want people to find us.”

He laughed, “Yes, you do! Stop lying to yourself and your audience. You're as much of a cold-blooded killer as I am and you will do whatever you need to do to get blood. Admit it.”

A rage flashed through me, “You forced me into this life! I won't stand here and let you belittle the only connection that I have to the outside world! You turned me into a vampire because you are the monster. We are not the same.”

He was silent for a long moment and eventually shrugged.

“Be that as it may,” he smiled ear to ear, “I won.”

His hand wandered down from my neck to my chest and his touch became more aggressive. “Is your device still recording? Why don't we keep it on and let all your little fans know that you're still my whore. You do what I say and you enjoy every minute of it.”

Tears fell silently as he began his onslaught of domineering touches and words. I reciprocated when demanded and enjoyed it when he told me to. He pumped in and out of me for what felt like ages and I just laid there silently, taking it. 

The “punishment,” the “gift,” it was all the same. I had no autonomy and just wished more than anything that I could feel like a human again.

When it was over, I continued laying there in silence as he held me in his arms. 

“Enjoy this. It's not every day that I want to cuddle you afterwards. Is intimacy from a monster not better than no intimacy at all, my love?”

His words stung. I felt myself involuntarily leaning into the cuddling. “Yes, I suppose it is.”

His arm wrapped around me tightly, “You are mine and always will be. Your listeners are delusional if they think they can save you.”

I shakily exhaled and tried to ignore that he was almost crushing me. “Forever is a long time, maybe you're wrong.”

“Maybe, or maybe I could twist your mind even further to put a complete stop to this.”

I felt myself freeze and silently panic.

“Oh, but I won't do that. Don't worry your pretty little head.” He kissed my forehead. “I enjoy breaking you down too much to do that.”

I frowned and his grip on my torso tightened. 

“You will succumb to me and you will succumb fully when you are ready to do so.”

I glared at him. He was so sure of himself but I was determined to prove him wrong. “No.”

The cuddling continued in silence until he got bored. He got off the bed and bent down to kiss my lips. He tasted of blood, like a fresh kill.

He liked to kill right before sex. Perhaps it was intended to unsettle me, I didn't know. 

He kissed me once more, a long and deep kiss. “Perhaps one day you will grow to love me. But until then,” he stood back and looked at me, “time will come and time will go. I am the only one who stays.”

I looked down sadly. He was wrong, wasn't he? Was he wrong?  

I opened my mouth to speak but words failed me. Forever was a long, long time.

I laid in bed, despondent. 

This was my life now and it killed me to think that all I could do was just accept it.

I closed my eyes and absently wondered if I could still dream. I wondered if there was a way I could let my family know that I was alive.

I rolled onto my side and looked out the window, absently wondering if another brave listener would try to save me again today. 

Maybe he was right. I was complicit in the death of my fans, even if I genuinely saw them as the only link left to my humanity.

I shook my head. Was wanting that selfish? Should I just give up and give in to him? Should I just stop fighting? I bucked against the thought immediately. 

No, no matter what, no matter how desolate my life became, I would not give him that satisfaction. I would retain a piece of myself or I'd die trying.

I stared at my indestructible immortal body and sighed, could I even die?

He told me that it wasn't possible and that vampires have survived nuclear blasts, plane crashes, sharks, volcanos, and even space.

But if we couldn't be killed, who was going to save me from him?

I clutched my head in my hands and laid on the bed in a fetal position. “You're not giving up, you're not giving up!” 

I repeated this to myself over and over again, hoping that with each word, I would believe myself a little bit more.

I inhaled and sat up on the bed. I looked outside. Deer grazed about in the yard and one looked directly at me. Its heart beating and its blood circulating throughout its body pounded loudly on my eardrums.

I covered my ears and looked away. I wasn't sure I would ever get used to that, especially not at a distance. 

But after I looked away, my ears picked up another heartbeat.

I swung my head around but didn't see anyone. I rationalized that it was a fan and turned back around, but before I fully did, I heard a voice.

“I can get you out of here.”
