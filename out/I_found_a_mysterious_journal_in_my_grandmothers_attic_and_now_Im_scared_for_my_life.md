I never thought I'd be the one to post on r/nosleep, but something has been happening to me that I can't explain. It all started when I was cleaning out my grandmother's attic after she passed away. I stumbled upon an old, leather-bound journal that looked like it hadn't been touched in years.

Curiosity got the best of me and I started flipping through the pages. It was filled with strange symbols and drawings, but I couldn't make sense of any of it. That's when I noticed something odd - the journal was written in a language I had never seen before.

At first, I thought it was some kind of code, but as I continued to read, I realized that it was something far more sinister. The author of the journal claimed to have made a deal with a powerful entity in exchange for wealth and power.

As I read on, the entries became more and more disturbing. The author wrote about sacrificing innocent people to appease the entity and gain its favor. The more I read, the more I felt like I was intruding on something I shouldn't be seeing.

That's when strange things started happening. I started hearing whispers in my ear when I was alone, and I felt like I was being watched even when no one was around. Objects in my house started moving on their own, and I could hear footsteps coming from empty rooms.

I tried to ignore it, but things only got worse. The dreams started next. Vivid, terrifying nightmares that left me feeling drained and helpless. I could feel the presence of the entity, and I knew it was coming for me.

I've tried to get rid of the journal, but it keeps finding its way back to me. Every time I try to destroy it, it reappears in my house. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm scared for my life, and I don't know who to turn to.

If anyone out there has any advice or has experienced something similar, please let me know. I'm desperate for help, and I don't know how much longer I can hold on.

The more I read the journal, the more I realized that the author's deal with the entity was not something to be taken lightly. It seemed as though the entity had complete control over the author's life, and that it would do anything to maintain that control.

As the days went on, I became increasingly paranoid. I started seeing strange symbols and patterns everywhere, even in my own dreams. I knew that the entity was watching me, waiting for the right moment to make its move.

One night, I woke up to find the journal on my nightstand, open to a page that I hadn't seen before. The page was filled with a complex set of symbols and incantations, and I could feel an ominous energy emanating from the book.

Suddenly, I heard a voice whisper in my ear - a voice that was not my own. It spoke in a language that I didn't understand, but the message was clear: the entity had come for me.

I tried to run, but I felt as though I was moving through molasses. My limbs felt heavy, and I could barely lift my feet off the ground. The entity was getting closer, and I knew that I was running out of time.

In a desperate move, I grabbed the journal and started reciting the incantations on the page. I didn't know what I was doing, but I hoped that it would somehow protect me from the entity's wrath.

Suddenly, I felt a surge of energy coursing through my body. The symbols on the page started glowing with a bright, white light, and the voice in my head started to fade away.

When I looked up, I saw that the entity was gone. I don't know what happened, but it was as though the journal had somehow banished it back to whatever realm it had come from.

I haven't seen or heard from the entity since that night, but I know that I can never let the journal fall into the wrong hands. I keep it hidden away in a place that no one can find, and I hope that it will never come back to haunt me again.
