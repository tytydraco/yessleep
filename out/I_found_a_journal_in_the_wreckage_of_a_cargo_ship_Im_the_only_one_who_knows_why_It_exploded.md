I was an Alaskan king crab fisherman from my 20s up until I retired at 65, my body had finally had enough of turbulent waters and freezing temperatures, and I wanted to spend more time with my Wife and grandkids.



I don't have that many stories of strange encounters, sea monsters, or ghosts. What I do have is a journal I found in the wreckage of a cargo ship.



It was back in the early 80s, if I remember correctly, we were in the middle of checking our nets. When a loud Boom caught all of us by surprise, we turned and saw that the source was a massive explosion that looked about 70 miles away from us.



We quickly dumped our bounty of crab into the tank and went in the direction of the explosion.

As we got closer, we had to maneuver around shipping containers bobbing in the ocean, our suspicions were confirmed when we came upon what looked like a cargo ship that was stuck into the side of an ice shelf.



There was a massive hole where we presumed the fuel tank had been in, the force of the explosion had pushed the ship on its side, looking like it had embedded itself further into the wall of ice. We debated whether to check for survivors since we didn't have the room for extra people.



That's when I suggested we try to check for survivors; we still had to report it to the NOAA regardless.



Our way of getting on board the cargo ship involved using our crane to pick up a few of us in one of our empty crab cages and very carefully dropping it on the top deck. It was stupid, reckless, and dangerous, but like my grandson used to say, “That's how we roll”.



We spent an hour walking along the upper deck of the ship. It quickly became evident there were no survivors.

The bodies we did find looked like they had been ripped apart and partially devoured.

I remember seeing what looked like extreme frostbite on many of them.



My search of the ship cabins lead me to the captains quarters, It took a lot of force to get the door open.



Inside, I found the first body to not look like it had been torn up, instead, he had most likely been flung into the wall by the force of the explosion and had broken his neck upon impact.



I inspected his body further, from his wallet I learned his name was Patrick Westerman, and near his body was a Journal he’d kept.



I read through it, it's how I learned he was the captain of this vessel, The Ever Traveler. I skimmed through it until I got to his last few entries.



Heavy fog caused them to crash into this ice wall, he said they couldn't even abandon ship because the Lifeboat was on the side stuck in the ice.



The final transcribed entries from Captain Patrick Westerman:



“Our first night stranded was uneventful, Until I was startled awake by the sound of a loud thud from outside, like someone had dropped a safe on the deck, I carefully got out of bed and put my ear to the door of my cabin, for about an hour I heard heavy footsteps increasing and decreasing in volume, like someone was walking around the deck of the ship in a circle, over and over.



I would have chalked it up to Charlie patrolling for other ships, but even with his Big Boots , you couldn't hear them from outside.



It was around the third time I heard the footsteps that they stopped. After 30 minutes, I didn't hear anything and tried to go back to bed.



Morning began with frantic pounding on my cabin door.



“Patrick! Wake up!”



The muffled but panicked tone of Charlie's voice was enough for me to run to the door and open it.



“What happened?”



“Something got on board last night.”



Hearing that, I immediately got dressed and followed Charlie.



We looked around the ship, the locks on shipping containers were broken, and the doors stood open; the frost covered contents strewed about the deck.



“What could have done this?” I asked, still surveying the area



“Whatever it was, it's big, look at this”.



Charlie pointed to an area over by the ends where the metal floor showed a 3-foot-wide, 3-inch-deep indention, with what looked like 2 foot long footprints made of ice trailing away from the area.



“ must have climbed up the side of the ship”



Charlie pointed at the indentation again.



“It didn't climb up here captain, to leave something like this, It would have had to jump”.



The idea that something was not only heavy enough to leave a visible dent on the deck floor, but strong enough to jump and get on our ship began to make me sweat.



“We need to go to the security room and check the cameras from last night.”



“Aye,” Charlie agreed.



As more crewmen woke up, they became curious as to what could have done this, great minds think alike, and before you know it, we were all crowded around Louie, who began the process of rewinding the tape from last night.



The footage shows nothing for the first few hours, then around 1:43 am, A white blur rose from behind the railing and landed on the deck. We didn't know what we were looking at; all it looked like was a white fuzzy thing.



We watched from each feed as it roamed along the deck, we saw it effortlessly break off the lock of containers and rummage around in them.



Charlie was the first to speak out.



“We need to try and catch this thing, it will probably be back tonight’



Louie looked at Charlie.



“What are ya nuts?! Look at how big it is! And did you see what it did to our containers?!”



“Aye, I did, but I don't think it's strong enough to break out from the inside. We lure it in and quadruple lock it; at least we’ll be safe then.”



I agreed with Charlie, and we started forming a plan for our attempted capture of the creature.



The next night myself, Charlie, Louie, and some other crewmen, stowed inside one of the storage containers whose lock had been broken the night before, and waited to see if our mystery monster would show up again.

After about an hour, we heard the sound of something colliding against the side of the ship.



We peeked out the doors to see a pair of hands grabbing the railing, we watched as it proceeded to pull itself up and climb over onto the deck.



To see this creature in person generated a new sense of dread in me, the subtle details no longer obscured by a security camera's grainy video. It was a  white furred primate with blue skin, it had a head more like a baboon, and the body was gorilla-like, except it was two times larger than your average gorilla.



Louie was the first to try to approach the creature, he was 6’3 but with the monster, he looked like a 6 year old standing next to a basketball player, he exited the container and walked towards the thing,  he tried to be slow and gentle, but as the beast turned to face him, Its face turned into one of rage, It shrieked and grabbed Louie by the torso with one hand, Louie's screams will stay in my mind forever.



“Louie!” I heard another crewman say.



He was about to go run to try to save Louie when Charlie grabbed the man by his collar.



“Don't get any closer, you damn fool!”



He pointed at Louie's torso, which looked like… ice was growing on it.



“Just like the footprints from before, you touch that thing, you're gonna freeze!”



Just as Charlie finished, the Ape-like creature grabbed Louie's arm with its other hand.

Louie screamed again as ice formed around where its hand had grabbed.



The beast then bit down on Louie's arm, taking a large chunk from it, which more than deterred everyone else who witnessed it from trying to fight the thing.



“I've got an idea, if he finishes with Louie, just start running, I’ll be back.”



Charlie turned and ran as we watched it continue to move Louie around, taking off more chunks of his flesh.

The screaming stopped after it bit into his neck.



Many crewmen had fled, leaving me to keep watching.

It was right as the ape had reduced poor Louie to a half-frozen torso that it locked eyes with me.



I felt frozen with fear as it began to head towards me.



“PATRICK! GET DOWN!”



I turned to see Charlie holding a flare gun, and quickly ducked as Charlie fired the flare.

I saw it fly over my head and hit the Ape right in the face.



We watched as it howled in pain, the flare was burning through its face, that blue skin melted, it tried to grab at it, but the heat of the flare melted its fingers. After a few minutes , its head was just a stump, and the thing fell to the ground.



We both walked up to the body of this… Ice ape



“How’d you know that would work?” I asked Charlie



“I didn't, it was just a shot in the dark,” he replied.



With the help of a few crewmen, we moved the body indoors. The kitchen was the closest thing we had to an examination table.

That's how we learned the following:



1 . The Ice ape's ability to freeze what they touch is only on the parts that don’t have fur.



2. The “fur” in question is actually millions of tiny icicles.



3. The ice they're made of is very hard; we found that out when it took two hours to hack off part of its arm with a fire axe.



4. We removed part of a limb in order to place it in one of the ovens to see its melting point. The arm didn't seem to react until we got into the hundreds.

At 100 it looked like the hand began sweating; it was around 800 that the arm started dissolving.



5. They notice when one of their own doesn't come back before dawn.



We learned that when we tossed the thing off the ship, our lookout informed us another one had made its way over the hill.



Charlie and I watched as this New ice ape examined the body of the fallen one, looked up at us, and began shrieking, grunting, and beating its own chest.



Before we could try to get another flare ready, it grabbed the dead ice ape and fled back over the hill as the sun started rising.



Charlie looked me in the eye.



“We’re dead Patrick, all of us.”



I tried to be optimistic.



“Maybe there are just two, well... one now.”



Charlie immediately shot down my suggestion.



“No, I should have put it together the first time that monster got on board. It was a scout, it came to search our vessel, then report back to its troop.”



I tried to hide the fear in my voice.



“You think they'll all be that mad?”



Charlie sighed.



“They’re gonna be fuming, but I've got a plan. You get some rest, I'll get some crew mates to help me get it ready.”



I decided to take his advice, how Charlie could keep going after staying up all night I'll never know.



When I woke up, it was already dark, so I made my way to the deck. Charlie and the rest of the crew were waiting at the port side, looking over the edge. I asked him what he was looking at, and I looked down with him and saw a discoloration in the ice that spanned the length of the ship.



“What are you doing?” I asked.



“Keeping an eye out for ‘em,” Charlie said, holding a bottle close to his chest. “ For my plan to work, I need to be ready to strike the minute I see ‘em coming over that hill.



“What do you plan to do-“



Charlie raised a hand, cutting me off.



“Shhhh, listen.”



I immediately heard the faint sound of shrieking and deep grunting of possibly a dozen of those beasts.



“They’re coming.”



“No,” Charlie corrected.



“They’re here.”



From above the hill came at least 30 Ice Apes; from a distance, they looked identical to the one we had killed.



As they got closer, Charlie shoved a rag in the bottle he was holding and lit it, other crew members down the port and stern did the same.



The Ice apes were halfway to us when Charlie screamed.



“NOW!”



Charlie and the crew mates began throwing the bottles off the ship, many hit the discolored area of ice, some went past it, within minutes, a massive wall of fire came up.



This caused the ice apes to stop and witness the fire, it was like watching cavemen discovering fire for the first time, the apes tried to get closer to it, one ape stuck his hand in it.



And immediately pulled its arm out, shrieking in pain and holding the stump of melted ice that was once his hand.



Everyone started celebrating, myself included.



“By the time the fires go out, the ice will melt enough that we can break the ship away!” Charlie shouted triumphantly

“Hope you don’t mind we borrowed a little gas for this.”



“We’ll be fine, that was like raindrops compared to the rest of our fuel,” I replied.



Our moment of relief was interrupted by the shouting of another crew mate.



“Hey! The monkeys are doing something!”



Charlie and I looked back over to see that the ice apes were furiously clawing at the ice around them, building up small piles of ice shavings.

I realized what they were doing.



“They’re gonna throw that on the fire and put it out!”



Charlie pulled out a flare gun.



“Flare guns! Open fire!”



Charlie fired a flare, as did 5 others, in the direction of the apes.

One struck one of the clawing apes in the back. I watched as the heat from the flare melted a hole in its back, and the ape fell to the ground.



Out of the 6 flares fired off only one landed a fatal blow, the others had hit random areas, the other problem was flare guns are one shot and have to be reloaded, in that pause a single ice ape began running towards the ship and jumped, leaping over the fire and towards the deck, it was only a few feet away when Charlie fired another flare, hitting the ape square in its ugly blue mouth.



The force of the flares knocked it back… causing it to land on an area of the wall of fire.



The apes body immediately melted like the arm of the one that was dumb enough to touch the fire.



And put out the fire in that spot.



“We need another Molotov for that spot, quickly!”

Charlie demanded, but everyone around him watched in terror.



Because the flares failed to hit more than one Ice Ape, the remaining apes had successfully dug piles of ice shavings and began running towards the fire and throwing the ice on it, slowly putting it out.



Chaos erupted as crewmen ran left and right, while Charlie quickly ran inside.



“Everyone! To the engine room! I didn’t want it to lead to this, but it’s time for plan B’”



I watched as several crewmen followed Charlie.



Not sure what else I could do, I fled back to my quarters and barricaded the door.



I heard the sound of multiple heavy thuds landing on the deck, followed by the grunting and shrieking of more ice apes, and the wails of men and women dying at the frozen hands of those beasts.



I’m not sure what Charlie’s backup plan was, but I hope it wasn’t something really stupid- “



This was where the journal ended with a long pen mark next to the word stupid.



I didn’t believe it at first, that these people encountered and had to fight off a bunch of “Ice Apes”, and in desperation , they blew up their own ship?



It sounded like the machinations of a crew gone mad from being stranded on a block of ice for god knows how long, but then I remembered the conditions of the bodies, the deep frostbite that resembled actual animal bites.

What made me a believer was hearing one of my crew mates screaming for everyone to come see something.



That something turned out to be an Ice ape.



It was exactly how the journal described, minus a pair of legs, one arm, and a quarter of its torso.



Its wounds looked more like if you held a lighter up to an ice cube for a few minutes, you know ,that rounded look an area of melted ice gets.



Discussion broke out among everyone about what it was, where it came from, and what to do with it. I decided to keep the journal to myself and feign ignorance of the situation.



Eventually, one of the nuttier guys claimed that he knew what this was.



He went on about how the Ice ape was probably one of a species of monsters made by the government to use for warfare, and that explosives were planted in the ship in the event something went wrong, so it would kill the monsters and kill everyone on board to make sure there were no witnesses.



This seemed to make sense to everyone besides me, and an agreement was made not to mention this being found in the report, because we did not want to be killed for exposing supposed government secrets.



I went along with the ruse.

To my knowledge, the shipwreck was reported, but I never learned what became of it, the remains of Captain Patrick, his crew, the shipping containers, and the dead Ice Ape.

Now, I suppose you’re wondering why I’ve decided to come forward and spend the time transcribing the contents of the journal here.



Because I’ve been paying attention to the news recently, particularly stories about animal attacks in areas near the Arctic Ocean, and “Yeti” sightings.



I think the Ice apes are starting to migrate south.
