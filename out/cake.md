Last night the kitchen was clean. The kind of clean that gleams in the moonlight, sterile and still, like the silence after a final breath. He remembered wiping down the counters slowly, methodically, like a ritual. The sponge squeaked against porcelain. The last dish clinked into place. He turned off the light with a sort of finality, the way a priest might close a casket. He locked the doors. He checked the windows. He exhaled, full of the holy peace that comes from knowing the outside world had been sealed away.

But in the morning—  
The cake.

It stood on the center of the island, raised proudly on a ceramic pedestal he didn’t own. Frosted, perfectly. A ring of lavender fondant draped like royal robes, with thin ribbons of piped vanilla weaving symbols that didn’t look quite like letters, but maybe if you squinted… if you tilted your head… maybe they said your name.

It wasn’t just a cake. It was *presented*. Displayed like an offering, or a warning. It didn’t belong. It *insisted*.

His feet didn’t want to move, but they did, pulled in slow, heavy steps like gears grinding forward in some ancient machine of panic. His hand shook as he reached out—not to touch it—but to see if the *air* around it would resist. It didn’t. But he could smell it now, sweet and almost antiseptic, like sugar and bleach and something just slightly, imperceptibly wrong.

He backed away.

The doors were still locked. Windows, latched. Security camera on the porch hadn’t recorded anything except moths. There were no footprints. No dishes in the sink. No flour on the floor. No heat from the oven. It was like the cake had *descended*.

He sat down. The chair screeched.

"Okay," he said to the empty room. “Okay. Maybe I made a cake.”

He tried to remember. Had he blacked out? Had he—*God help him*—sleep-baked?

He opened his spice cabinet. Cinnamon. Nutmeg. Allspice. He sniffed each jar with the dread of a man looking for a gas leak. Then the fridge. Eggs. Milk. Butter. Nothing missing. No sticky smudges. Not a smudge in the whole house.

He checked his phone. Nothing. No photos. No grocery orders. No texts saying “yo cake party at my place.” He didn’t *do* Ambien. He didn’t drink. He didn’t… but maybe he had? Maybe last night *wasn’t* what he thought it was. The idea entered his mind with the quiet elegance of a knife being slipped between ribs.

“Maybe I bought a cake,” he whispered. But to *who*? And *why*?

He opened the crawlspace.

The door creaked. The air that came out was stale, like forgotten things breathing quietly in the dark. He lowered his flashlight and scanned. Pipes. Dust. The old cat toy he thought he'd thrown away. Nothing else.

But that idea was in his head now—feral and pacing: *what if someone lives down there*? What if they've been watching, waiting, learning his routines the way you'd learn an animal's path through the woods?

His skin prickled like it remembered being touched.

Maybe it was a neighbor. A joke. A prank. But that didn’t feel right. The cake had… *presence*. It wasn’t funny. It was *assertive*. The way it perched there, fully confident in its own impossibility.

He turned back toward the cake, now with something like defiance. He would throw it out. Cut it open. Smash it. That would settle things.

He took a knife from the drawer.

As he approached, he realized the knife felt too small. Like he needed a sword. Or a crucifix. The frosting glistened under the fluorescent light. It wasn’t sweating or melting. It was perfect. *Too* perfect. The lines were steady, machine-perfect—but not *manufactured*. There was something… *intimate* in the construction. The kind of detail that came from hands. But no hands had touched it.

He thought about tasting it.

He *wanted* to. A dark, sudden craving twisted inside him like a parasite opening its eyes. Maybe if he tasted it, it would all make sense. Maybe he *had* made it. Maybe the fear was silly. Irrational. Just a side effect of too much internet, too much isolation, too many episodes of Erik’s Halloween specials where the line between commentary and possession is paper-thin.

He brought the knife down.

The frosting split like silk.

Inside: pure white. Vanilla sponge. Four even layers. No surprises. No worms. No blood. No message.

Except…

A single black hair.

Not his.

He dropped the knife. He *ran*. Slammed the bathroom door, stared into the mirror. Trembling. Pale. Trying to blink the unreality out of his vision.

He didn’t know what was worse—that someone had broken in and baked a cake in total silence without leaving a trace, or that *something else* had simply *put* it there. Like a footnote from another reality. A punctuation mark in frosting. An edit to his life he hadn’t authorized.

He sat in the tub. Fully clothed. Shivering.

Somewhere behind the walls, the refrigerator kicked on.

And in the kitchen, the cake waited.
