[Part 2]


Did you know?


The ‘Satanic Panic’ is the name given to over 12000 reported cases of Satanic sacrifice rituals and other heinous crimes suspected to have been committed by alleged devil worshipers. These claims were predominantly rampant in the ‘80s. Many TV shows of this era took advantage of those fears, leaning heavy into every occult practice, and any mention of the devil. They used this agenda to attack and lay blame on everything from metal music, video games, and ultra-violent, overly sexualized movies. Y'know, all the good stuff. Daytime talk shows being the worst example of using fear and paranoia to get TV ratings. I bring this up as an attempt to bring more light and give a deeper dive into the occurrences from Part one. 



First off, a big thank you to everyone who read the previous entry. An even bigger thank you to those who offered help whether it be through the comment section, or those who reached out via DMs. After talking to some of you guys, I’ve decided that I can’t just give up on this. Taking all the given information, I thoroughly racked my brain, and the earliest memory I have is like my seventh or eighth Christmas, when I got an original NES console. Good times, right? See, right now I’m going through some health issues and I can’t work, I feel like I needed a project to keep my mind strong. Little did I know, having no idea of what I was walking into. Luckily, a computer guy who read Part one gave me steps on how to view the URLs without taking the risk of infecting my laptop. Apparently something to do with going into ‘safe mode with internet’, whatever that means. I got everything set up, and I reluctantly clicked on the first link, I hadn’t realized I was holding my breath until I got a slight light-headed feeling. 



The link opened to a file share site, which immediately downloaded a ton of files directly to my hard drive. My breathing had slowly returned to normal when I saw the file types like, MPEG, JPEG, DOC, TXT, even a couple of other types that I’m not familiar with. The overwhelming feeling creeps back in, sending cold chills up and down my spine, when I go to that folder and see just how many files were transferred. Around 5 or so terabytes of data. For anyone unfamiliar with computer jargon, a gigabyte is around as much data as one feature length movie in 720p resolution. One terabyte is equal to 1024 gigabytes. In other words, it basically equals a few excruciatingly long days of research ahead of me. Luckily, I had a new 8TB external drive linked to my laptop that was big enough to hold everything. While I was corresponding with the computer guy, I had him analyze the mysterious email sent to me with hopes to identify the sender. 



One thing he recommended, right off the bat, was to download and use a VPN, at all times. So that’s exactly what I did. But unfortunately, waiting  for the email information would take awhile to uncover. While waiting, I started the daunting task of going through the files downloaded to my laptop. The very first thing I clicked on was a document with so many names, I presumed they were all female names. The document had them listed as ‘Semen Demons’ as disgusting as that sounds. The next image, very similar to the photo shown on the ‘Unsolved Mysteries’ episode. It depicted several doctors, nurses? I dunno, wearing the same dark red scrubs with the circular symbol on the chest. They’re all standing in a line, all holding what appeared to be new born babies, all with the brand mark on their chests. This wasn’t the worst image, but it was a rather shocking start. I had no idea of the horrors that had yet to come. There was a grainy photo of some uppity looking old guys in three-piece suits smiling, and laughing, while smoking cigars. I immediately figured these men were very important, but I had not a single clue who any of them were. I found a list of ‘In Network’ doctor’s offices, man that sounds sketchy as fuck when it’s used relating to this particular subject. 



The next couple of files, an elaborate spreadsheet with several names, locations, and what I can only guess was amounts of money, either owed, or a payment receipt. The only thing of interest on this file was one name that seemed familiar. Now obviously, I’ve never heard of, or met any of these people. However, this was the first connection between my hometown and Nebraska. Continuing on, one person did jump out at me, Dominic Draven with a beginning location of [----Redacted----], South Carolina and ending location of Omaha, Nebraska. The line I assumed as a monetary amount was $23000. I know you guys remember that name, he played the dad in the ‘Unsolved Mysteries’ episode. Another list popped up of prominent people, their affiliations, their working zones, and the assigned tasks for them. This was so much to go over, the most difficult thing to make out is what the assignments meant, everything else is written out. The assignments were all two random letters, there’s definitely a pattern to it, I just can’t figure it out yet. This list had connections to some of the largest banks in the world, as well as foreign contacts with ties to drug cartels, and human trafficking rings from Mexico, Japan, even China. Suddenly I was now dealing with a global conspiracy. The next document was just gibberish – maybe another pattern here, or a code of some sort, possibly short hand notes? Anyway, it was printed on official CIA letterhead and at the bottom it had a space for a signature, on that line there were two hastily, poorly, scribbled letters, JC. Another other odd thing was the letters, they were written by what I could only guess was done by a kid? The J almost looked like a U. 



The final thing about these two letters, they were oversized, dipping well past the signature line, and red in color, dark red. Basically a bronze-ish red. If I were one to speculate, I’d say the initials were written in blood. Maybe? Too over dramatic? I dunno, the shit was creepy. Next, there was an article from the New York Times, going over the breaking story about ‘The Finders’ scandal. Apparently that’s a whole different iceberg. A Google search of ‘The Finders’ reveals a supposed cult based in Virginia, pretty close to Washington DC, with several alleged members having ties to the CIA, and FBI. I think I’m getting in way above my pay grade here. Other news articles here seemed to link the Credit Union scandal from the TV news clip to this ‘Finders’ cult. It was alluded to, that there was a completely clandestine trafficking and prostitution scheme used solely by the tippy-top upper class going on that has documented members that further links the two stories. Then, there were pictures of men in all white robes slaughtering a goat with several malnourished looking kids watching on. I found a very short video clip of what I’d call a ritual, several hooded figures standing in a circle. A young looking naked female in the middle holding a quite elaborate chalice. The footage was in terrible shape, but I could make out that she had the brand on her right chest. She passed the chalice around, each hooded figure took a sip from the cup and then naked lady collected the cup, drinking the rest. 



Now this next part was definitely interesting, and in my mind, this was a direct link to me, maybe. I found a list of names from the Franklin scandal, that I cross referenced some of the same names from the ‘Finders’ leaks. But at the bottom of this third list there was an unnamed entry, it read, “male baby – born 9/[----Redacted----]/1984 – location [----Redacted----] SC”. See, this is very important considering that is my birthday and location. All of this information is quickly becoming more than I think I can deal with. I stayed away from my research for a few days while waiting for the computer guy to get back with me about that email, and the sender. I began to distance myself by looking at the other link, it was an few short videos, and a file with producers notes and names of the crew who worked on my episode of ‘Unsolved Mysteries’. Some names came complete with email addresses or other contact information. The video file turned out to be a company wide, internal only memo, regarding the reasoning behind why S2E31 was going to be canned. It played out as an interview, only not like a press release, more like an internal investigation type thing.  At one point in the interview video, Robert Stack, himself is heard saying, “That kid deserves justice, they all do! That story is so relevant and it needs to be told.” With the show creator and lead producer responding, “We had to pull the entire episode solely for the one segment, but I’m confident we can take the other segments and slide them into other episodes. There were powers beyond my control at play here, it was the best I could do.” 



I knew there was no telling just how many connections there were to be made here. But, I’m just one person, I dunno if this is something I should pursue. What difference could I really make? We hear stories all the time about these whistle-blowers who wind up mysteriously dead after speaking out about any subject that goes against the government’s official word, or anything that implicates higher ups with wrong doing. I mean besides any of that, going through mountains of research was one reason why I dropped out of college. I know I’m kidding myself, I’m too intrigued to fully stop, but I am also very worried about what might happen to me. I decided the safest way to proceed would be to reach out to the TV show contacts, listed in that folder. I sent out a couple of feeler emails, asking some pretty easy questions first. I claimed that I was a freelance writer who was researching the series, and the conspiracies believed to be attached to the show. Was that the only time an episode or segment had to be pulled or altered? I asked his opinion of what happened to that baby? A few other, much easier questions, like, what was your particular role on the show? 



I wanted to wait to ask any harder questions until I felt like I could trust these contacts. Now that I’ve seem to have exhausted my other leads, I was procrastinating over going back to that 5TB of data from the file share. You guys, man, all I can say is I wish there would’ve been a content warning for  me. Just know these next few pieces of media are really heavy to talk about. I took many breaks while going through these. The first example was a typed document breaking down the quality of the kids involved. Names, ages, and where they were abducted from. Dresden Draven from upstate South Carolina was taken at birth. The victims with high quality blood and DNA would be classed as breeders, the boys would be raised, indoctrinated, and taught that this was how life worked, the boys were told they were upper class, and treated as such. It wasn’t as easy for the female kids, the ones with good blood and DNA were marked for breeding, but were raised, indoctrinated, brain-washed and taught to do as they’re told, a much more harsh life for those girls. The kids with bad blood or DNA were marked for sacrifice, or for prostitution. It was all charted out, maybe hundreds of names. Some of those names had been marked as deceased, no cause of death given. 



If that wasn’t bad enough, here’s your trigger warning. There were files marked as ‘Blackmail’ which displayed the very despicable acts as mentioned above. Think of the sickest, most vile stuff you’ve ever witnessed, then multiply it by like a thousand. Very explicit, the quality of these videos was clear enough to recognize several celebrities, politicians, athletes, you get the idea, sometimes involving multiple victims, all who appeared to be under-aged. This is where I drew the line, I witnessed a baby, maybe a month or two old, being sacrificed during an apparent satanic ritual. A robed figure held the baby by its feet and slit his throat from ear to ear. The draining blood poured into a basin sitting on the alter. The other robed figures then stood and approached the alter. They all disrobed and the men stuck their hands into the blood basin. Then the men placed a bloody hand print on the stomach of one of the females. They all said some kinda prayer, in Latin I assume. The ending consisted of an all out orgy.



I felt my stomach wretch, with that nauseous sick feeling, I was left dry heaving. I swear I’m going to need a shitload of therapy after this. I wouldn’t wish anyone a punishment like having to witness this content, much less having to actually go through any of it. Some of these victims already looked like they had the total shit beat out of them even before anything else started. Seeing these things take place was one thing, but the sounds have scarred me forever. The screams, cries, the taunting, the sex noises, and probably the the worse being the sounds of the beatings, so much violence. Was finding the truth worth this?  This was without a doubt the absolute most fucked up shit I’ve ever saw. I still haven’t exactly figured out how I play into this, if I do at all. Y’know It just dawned on me that simply being in possession of this media would get me a lifetime in jail. I wiped my hard drives after taking everything of that nature and putting it into password protected folders on a hand full of flash drives, any ideas on what exactly to do with them?



Continuing researching off the flash drives, I found a document listing assets of this group, This cult? Stuff like, vehicle info and VIN numbers, property addresses, the names of companies, even down to an exhaustive list of storage units all across the US. Possibly thousands of assets were listed. I noticed it was getting late, even though I know I won’t be getting much sleep, I put my laptop away and laid down. My mind did cartwheels for what felt like hours, but I finally knocked out at some point. Upon waking the next day, groggily, I grabbed my phone and it was at this exact moment that I knew I was fucked. I wiped the sleep from my eyes as I unlocked my phone, I had an encrypted text message. It was a simple but very effective message, telling me to, “Stop sticking your nose in things you’ll never understand. It’s in your best interest to drop all of this.” I was able to call my cell service provider and ask for any info regarding that text. The only thing they could give me was an area code – 202… after Googling, it’s an area code for Washington DC. Needless to say, I took this warning very seriously… well for a day or so at least.



Now I constantly feel like I’m being followed, I definitely think they’re tracking my phone. I see things out of the corner of my eye that I can’t explain. Like earlier this morning, I KNOW I saw a face peeking into my bedroom window. I didn’t know how to feel, like I’ve never really ruffled any feathers before. I’m not exactly sure if I like this feeling, I 100% feel like I’m in real danger here. I’m very isolated, I don’t have a lot of friends or family to rely on, definitely none I can trust with this crazy shit. Are they keeping tabs on me, who’s they? Remember the other time I said I wanted to give up, now I dunno again. My hard headed side wants to push through regardless of what happens to me. Guys, I’m totally freaked the hell out, just a couple of minutes ago, there was an overly aggressive knock on my door, I waited about 10 minutes or so before I reluctantly went to check the door. There of course was nothing there, but I did notice a freshly graffitied eye ball on the power pole next to my driveway. Was this a warning, damn sure seems like one. I know I’ve made a handful of decent connections already, but still no confirmation if any of it includes me. Did I make a huge mistake with all of this? 



I’ve never really believed in coincidences but maybe part of me doesn’t want to know the truth. Maybe I need to get out of town for a few days, but I don’t think it’ll make much difference. These people will still know where I am. Sometimes I think I’m my own worst enemy, reading some conspiracy article it talks about the upper echelon employing an expertly trained group of individuals known as ‘Fixers’. I think the name speaks for itself, picture like every controversial suicide. You know the ones, famous people, or the political activist whistle-blowers. The ‘Fixers’ apparently carry out the job and make sure there’s no loose ends. My paranoia is at an all time high, I feel so much non-stop anxiety. So now my mind is fixated on this thought, do I have a ‘Fixer’ tracking me? What's worse, every night as I try to lay down and relax all I can picture is the depravity of those videos. I have nightmares where, if it was me, I didn’t make it out and I’m being forced to do all those things. I wake myself up hearing their screams, or maybe it’s me screaming in my sleep. 



It's about 2:25 am, and I just woke up with a start. I could very clearly hear people whispering outside my bedroom window. I couldn’t make out any words, but there were at least three distinct voices. It was all I could do to lay there and stay as still and quiet as possible. My heart was beating out of my chest. A cold sweat started to bead up on my forehead. I’ve been waiting for what feels like hours, and I can’t hear any voices or other noises outside. I got up and went stealthily around my house, in complete darkness, listening for any sounds from outside. After coming to the conclusion that they were gone, I pulled out my laptop and the flash drive. I came up with a dead man’s plan to release all the info if I didn’t manually stop it everyday with a randomly generated password. That made me feel a little better, knowing that if something happens to me, every police department and news outlet will get bombarded with these files. The program sent an encrypted text each day with the new password, and then I had 5 minutes to log onto the account and enter the password to stop the automated email program. 



This afternoon. I was coming home from picking up some groceries when I pulled out of the parking lot, I noticed a dark, older model sedan possibly following me. At first it wasn’t very obvious, but after around 5 or so turns, the car was still there tucked in behind a second or third car after me. It was at this point that I started to panic a bit. I took a left, then a right, right, right, left every time the dark sedan kept pace. I remembered a trick to make absolutely sure that someone is following you, I took four right turns in a row, basically doing a circle. And yep, I was definitely being followed. My heart rate and anxiety was spiking, frantically, this carried on for a bit, I wasn’t sure how to get out of this, so I drove to the closest police department and just sat in the parking area. The dark sedan slowly passed by without stopping. I then pulled around to the back of the building next door, for some cover. It’s  where I sat still for about 30 minutes or so. Having lived in this area for several years, I decided to take every back road, using the most obscure route to get home. So see, I knew I wasn’t crazy, was I? Now I’m trying to calm myself down by cooking dinner, something that I usually would enjoy if it were under different circumstances. 



I’m going to go radio silent for a while and let everything cool off for a week, maybe longer. I will update with Part 3 once things die down a bit.
