Humans, they’re strange things. 



Always on their screens wherever they go. They can’t afford to pay attention.



They’re not nice. I often try to be a part of this but they make it hard to. 



I wanted to try a job because I’ve been told to, I had to. My mother doesn’t care what I do, I just need to get one. 



Porgo Com. Internet access is what they do. People talk about Porgo all the time. Red and blue. Their logo stands out like a sea shell in sand. 



It wasn’t hard to find a job, they took me in with no experience. Weird. 



This is where I learned how mean humans are. 



Door to door. *Knock, knock*. All I do is knock. 



Get yelled at. *Knock, Knock.*



“Stop coming here you little bitch.” Is what he said. Grey hair. Dark beard. Scar on left eye.



*Knock. knock. “*Fuck you, I don’t want no Porgo. Come here again and I’ll shoot you.”



Wow. So mean. Skinny. Dirty plaid shirt, ruffled jeans. Smelly breath, so bad.



Knock, knock. 

“Hi there! What can I do for you.”

“Hi, we are an internet provider in your area, we offer comp.. petitive prices. 

My heart fluttered like a butterfly setting sail.

“You seem sweet, I’m sorry I’m not interested but I hope you have a good day.”

“You too.”



Wow. Nice. Smelled good, blonde hair. Not mean.



Every day. *Knock, knock.*

The man in charge was mean to me too. I wasn’t performing how he wanted. 

“You need to get your numbers up, you’re slacking. I know you’re new but you’re holding us back. Be better or else.” Were some of the words he chose without helping me.



Each door was especially painful. I don’t like this. 



A sign on their lawn. “No soliciting.” Soliciting? I didn’t know.



*Knock, knock.* 

The door swung open with force that sent a wind that parted the hair on my forehead. 

Man and woman. Angry. Gun.

 “GET THE FUCK OFF OF OUR PROPERTY!”

Man, black shirt. Pony tail. Cigarettes. Tattoos.

A bullet flew by my arm. I felt the air shutter with temporary heat as it grazed my skin. 

My body engaged fight or flight. My bones caught up with my muscles. I ran as fast as I could. 



I don’t like this job anymore.

Every day since then, I hear the shot. 

Boom. Crack. I didn’t tell anyone. My boss doesn’t care anyway.



I really don’t like these people. They don’t deserve to be human.



*Knock, knock.* 

I instinctively knocked on the table next to me like I’ve been doing, every day for the last 2 months.



Grey hair. Dark beard. Scar on left eye. 767 Farwich St., Blue House.



He’s first. 



I remember how it was. 

The yard was messy, dirt enveloped most of the entrance to the door. He didn’t take care of his house. The gutter was clogged with orange and yellow leaves, barely dripping away the rain water from the previous day. A kids bicycle sat in front with old red residue that stained the handles. 

Blood? 



I waited. It’s dark. Cold but manageable.

I left the house without my mother noticing. She passes out early with enough alcohol in her system. Sad existence. I wasn’t too far from this neighborhood. Dog’s singing in the distance as an ambulance drove by breaking every speed limit restriction. One. Two. Three. Three big rocks I found on the way there and a small razor.  

I love rocks and often polish them in my free time. They’re not mean.



767 Farwich St, it had a side area with broken pallets and buckets. I could use those to get in. No cars were at the blue home. 



I leaned one of the pallets that were missing a few planks against the wall. I wobbled and struggled until I was able to slide the side window open. Lucky.



I set up one rock at the door. One towards the kitchen and lastly toward the bedroom. I hid under the bed until Grey Hair got home. 



The door opened and the rock I placed slid against the floor bouncing off the kitchen wall leaving a light scuff.



“What the fuck.” Grey Hair was perplexed. Good. 



I took out the razor I had found and my uncontrollable grin started to wrap around its canvas. Every muscle in my body tensed up, I could feel the razor in my hand bending slightly cutting through a few layers of skin on my thumb. I didn’t feel a thing.



Grey Hair found the second rock in his kitchen. At this point he started to tweak out. I loved seeing that dumb face look everywhere flinging the sweat droplets off of his ugly forehead. 



Crash. He threw the second rock at the wall near the outside of the bedroom. Dumb, and reckless. 



I wiped the blood that ran from my thumb on my jacket to hide any presence I had since it started to radiate from under. It’s almost time.



Grey Hair finally found the last rock in the bedroom after giving up his short-lived investigation. Pop. He opened a beer he found in his refrigerator following his adult tantrum. It smells. 



The remnants of the bottle hit the floor almost hitting me as the liquid splashed in different directions. That ticked me off.



Grey Hair sat there on the bed and turned on the TV. This will be my first.



I waited. Waited. Waited. It’s darker. Silence.



Slowly I commando crawled out from under the bed. I stood there in fascination watching him exist. I didn’t move for at least 30 minutes. His eyeballs moved back and forth behind the curtains that mask his soul. His arms moved periodically, gripping at the air and groaning as if reaching for something. 



It was time. I placed the razor at his forehead before pressing down. Excitement throbbed through my veins I barely could contain it. 



I traced around his face to find the best point as the forehead wasn’t as entertaining. I decided to go in horizontally, from his temple on his forehead to the other. I pressed hard and ran the razor across both of his eyeballs like paying for a transaction I’d most likely not regret. 



The lids hiding his soul unraveled like curtains dropping right before a show. Blood sprayed out from his eyes followed by his curdling scream that gave me goosebumps. So loud. I laughed. Grey Hair flew to the floor in a chaotic flail as his brain tried to catch up to what was happening. 



“Stop coming here you little bitch.”

“Stop coming here you little bitch.”

“Stop coming here you little bitch.” I muttered as I lightly kicked the backs of his feet.

I followed closely behind as he crawled to any destination from his bedroom.

Happy. 



I had to continue. It wasn’t over. 



I pressed the razor against the top of his neck behind his stupid head. I ran it down his spine slowly. 

Red. A lot of red. 

His skin unfurled revealing the flesh that I hated the most.



Grey Hair could barely scream anymore as he was slowly descending to darkness. His body bounced off the ground like a sack of potatoes. Done.



I didn’t think of disposing of the body as it never was part of the plan. Nobody would miss him or see if he was home. Loser.



Walking out of the front door, I could only think of Dirty Plaid Shirt. 



Excited.
