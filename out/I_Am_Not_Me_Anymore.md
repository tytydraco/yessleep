The wall and I used to stare at each other.

By that point, it was more than habit—it was a ritual. Me, sinking deeper into the mattress, and it—blank, unblinking, mercifully indifferent. It asked nothing of me and gave nothing back. Some days I stared so long I’d start to see images in the texture—faces, landscapes, strange symbols—like the wall was trying to speak in a language only I could understand. Other days, I thought it was staring through me, cataloging the soft ruin of my body from the inside out.

That was before the mirror. I thought it might be helpful—comforting, even—to see myself. I dragged my mother’s old mirror out from the closet where it had been stored since she passed, a full-length thing, cracked at one corner. I placed it across from my bed, angling it just right so I wouldn’t have to move. Just lie there. Watching. Waiting.

I remember how my reflection looked that first time I caught a glimpse—pale, sweaty, sunken. My mouth hung open without me realizing it, slack and useless, like I was already forgetting how to be a person. My hair clung to my forehead in greasy strands, matted in places where sweat had dried. A yellow stain bloomed across the collar of my shirt—something spilled, or maybe something leaked from me. I looked like something recently exhumed: unwashed, unshaven, barely animate.

I thought: maybe if I saw myself falling apart, I’d want to stop it. Maybe the shame would ignite something. Some flicker. Some ember.

But I only watched. And I only withered.

I spent most days in bed, and the bed became something more than furniture—it was a grave I hadn’t earned, a womb I refused to leave. The sheets clung to me like old skin, soaked with sweat and time. I barely moved. I didn’t need to. The world could happen without me. It already had.

Getting up felt theatrical, unnecessary. Like pretending. Even the basic urges—food, piss, pain—faded beneath the weight of stillness. The mattress had shaped itself to my body so completely that it almost felt like it was holding me out of love. A soft, warm embrace. A kindness I longed for, but didn’t deserve.

Time didn’t just pass—it dissolved. Days bled into one another, thin and formless, like smoke curling through the air. I didn’t count them. I didn’t care.

Sleep came often, not as rest but as retreat. It pulled me under like a drug—thick, velvety, dishonest. In dreams, there was warmth. Motion. Laughter that didn’t stick in my throat. My face looked like it used to—alive, animated, not sagging under invisible weight. I had cheeks that flushed. Eyes that sparkled. A voice that didn’t shake like glass.

I loved it in that place, in that glowing nowhere. I was someone else, and somewhere else. Or maybe I was just me, before it took hold. Before I became a passenger in my own body.

Waking up was the cruelest part. Waking meant life, stink, heaviness. It meant remembering that I’d done nothing to stop the cascade. That every second I stayed there, it was my choice.

Maybe I wasn’t choosing. Maybe I just let the choice rot away like the rest of me.

Through it all, the mirror never lied. It showed me exactly what I was. And exactly what I wasn’t.

I would stare into the mirror for hours, fixing my gaze on my own face until the edges blurred and warped, until my features no longer looked like features at all but wet brushstrokes running down glass. Sometimes my nose would ripple. My mouth would stretch. My eyes would drift apart and sink into the hollows of my cheeks.

Had my mind grown so sick of my reflection that it began to destroy it—or had the mirror simply grown tired of casting it?

I blinked less and less. I didn’t want to interrupt the melting. I wanted to see what I really was beneath the facade of flesh. I thought if I looked long enough, I’d find the truth in there—some core that explained everything. But instead, I found something worse.

Some of the distortions didn’t go away.

My face would look swollen one day, then hollow the next, like it couldn’t decide whether to blow up or implode. Eventually, my cheeks sagged, mottled with faint, yellowish bruises that hadn’t been there before. The skin beneath my eyes darkened and grew thin, as if it were peeling away from bone. My lips cracked, turned pale, then blue at the corners.

And then my hands. The nails yellowed, thickened, and curled slightly as if recoiling from the flesh beneath them. The skin on my knuckles dried out and split open in tiny, weeping fissures. They looked like they belonged to someone long-dead, exhumed, softened by weeks in water.

Veins rose beneath the surface like gorging worms, writhing when I moved. My flesh loosened. The bones underneath felt too sharp, too long, and wrong. And when I flexed my fingers, I sometimes heard a sound—like wet paper being pulled apart.

And the smell, sweet and foul, like rotting fruit or meat left in plastic for too long.

At first, I thought it might just be dehydration. Malnutrition. Some consequence of lying here too long, wasting away. But deep down, I knew. This wasn’t a side effect.

It was a beginning. Something was happening to me. And I was letting it.

I kept staring. Every morning. Every night. Even when it hurt. Even when it terrified me.

The mirror didn’t flinch. It just stared back at me. Still. Quiet. Honest.

I craved finality, an end to this horrible production I was watching in the mirror. I had thought about it so many times that the thought barely felt like a thought anymore—more like background noise. Not some grand exit. No notes or drama. Just an end. A full stop. A surrender.

Finally, I convinced myself it was time. Not out of bravery, but exhaustion. I crawled out of bed. My knees cracked beneath me, unreliable and half-numb. My hands were barely hands at this point—fissured, leaking, soft in places they shouldn’t be.

I found the sharpest blade I had—the carving knife my father used to use on holidays to cut the turkey or ham. It seemed fitting.

I sat on the cold floor, cradling it. Holding the knife took effort. My fingers didn’t bend quite right—my tendons were too loose or too tight, I couldn’t tell anymore. The handle slipped in my grip, slick with some thin, yellow fluid weeping from the cracks in my palms.

With great effort, I got the blade to my wrist. The flesh there was soft, discolored—a strange blue-purple, like bruised fruit.

It barely took any pressure. The edge of the blade sank into the skin like it wanted to disappear. The dimple was instant. The skin gave so easily it frightened me. One quick pull and I’d be free.

But I couldn’t.

I sat there, shaking, pressing the blade just hard enough to feel the first needle-prick of pain. My breath caught in my throat. My heart thudded—slow, syrupy, uneven. My mind screamed do it—but I didn’t. Couldn’t.

I wasn’t afraid of dying. And so I failed. Again.

And somehow that was worse.

The knife dropped, landing beside me with a metallic clank. I collapsed after it, curling around it like a child might cling to a favorite toy. I didn’t cry like in the movies. There was no sound, no catharsis. Just thick, wet sobs trapped in my throat. My body heaved. My face contorted. My chest convulsed.

Another failure. Just one more.

I lay there for hours. Maybe longer, I don’t know. Eventually, I dragged myself back into bed, leaving a trail of sweat and slime behind me. The mirror watched. I turned my face to it and whispered, “Coward.”

And then I stopped moving.

I don’t mean I chose to stop. I mean, my body gave up on motion the way old fruit gives up on sweetness. It folded inward, crumpling slowly like a dying insect curling around its own failure. Movement became suggestion, then memory. My muscles tightened, then refused to relax. My joints seized. My skin began to harden—not into armor, but something more fragile, more obscene—papery and pale, stretched tight across swelling meat.

Cracks formed in the surface. Thin at first, like the silk of a spider’s web, then deeper, splitting in places until thick, glistening fluid seeped from me—clear, mucosal, carrying the faint, sour stink of old wounds and stagnation.

My spine twisted with a series of slow, deliberate pops—each one louder than the last, like someone breaking twigs under wet leaves. I could feel vertebrae pushing outward, rotating, repositioning into some unnatural architecture that no longer prioritized standing or sitting. My body was rearranging itself for a different purpose. Something postureless. Something permanent.

My arms curled inward against my chest as though I were hugging myself in fear or prayer. The elbows locked into place like rusted iron bent too far. The tendons beneath the skin wriggled, tightened, then gave out entirely with a slow, warm tearing.

My fingers—long useless, split and oozing—began to fuse at the joints. One by one. A grotesque knitting of flesh over bone. Several of them simply broke off at the knuckle, thudding to the floor with a soft, wet sound like raw sausages hitting tile.

Something inside me moved.

Beneath my ribs, a fluttering—rapid and erratic, like the heartbeat of something that should never have existed. I couldn’t tell if it was an organ malfunctioning or some new thing gestating—alien and wet, struggling to find a place in a body not built for it.

Then it stopped. Just like that. The stillness that followed was worse. As if something inside me had died, and I was now its tomb.

My stomach swelled grotesquely, ballooning outward with a slow, nauseating stretch. The skin turned taut and shiny—first green, then gray, then black—like a drowned corpse forgotten in the sun. It split slightly at the navel, leaking a brackish tar that smelled of bile and rot and something far sweeter. Like an infection trying to charm you.

And then my throat began to bulge.

There was pressure, then the sensation of something pushing outward, up through the esophagus. A second jaw emerged—not fully formed, just teeth and meat and a twitching mass of cartilage that protruded through the soft tissue at the base of my neck. It didn’t open. It didn’t breathe. It simply sat there, forever clenched. A mocking grin that hadn’t earned itself.

My face was the last thing to surrender.

My eyes refused to close. The lids had gone dry and cracked, then retracted entirely, like blistered wallpaper curling from heat. The whites had turned yellow. The pupils dilated until they disappeared—until my entire gaze became an unbroken void. They bulged outward from their sockets, glossy and twitching—then dried in place like insects pinned under glass.

I couldn’t blink. I couldn’t scream. I couldn’t cry.

The nerves were dead, or too afraid.

I stared. I stared because I had no other choice.

And the mirror, still angled just right across from my bed, showed me what I had become.

I don’t sleep anymore. I just watch.

Day after day, or maybe it’s the same day repeated endlessly—I’ve lost the ability to tell. I stare from behind eyes that don’t close, at a reflection that no longer flinches, no longer changes—only mocks. And in the mirror, I see what I have become.

Not a rebirth. Not a metamorphosis. A failure of becoming.

Like an aborted butterfly, flushed from its cocoon before it could finish. Soft, wet wings never given the chance to dry. Legs too twisted to stand. Colors smeared and unfinished. A thing meant to emerge radiant, but instead expelled—shivering—onto the cold floor of reality.

This wasn’t a transformation. It was a reflection made manifest.

A monument to inertia. A shrine to every moment I told myself, tomorrow I will do better.

Sometimes I imagine the knife still in the kitchen. I picture myself doing it right—quick, clean, brave. But that person no longer exists. Maybe he never did.

I see myself now, always. No eyelids to close. No neck to turn away.

Just the mirror. Just me. Just this.

I am not me anymore. I am what happens when you wait too long to try. I am what’s left when hope dries up and hardens into meat.

And I am still here. Alive. Somehow.
