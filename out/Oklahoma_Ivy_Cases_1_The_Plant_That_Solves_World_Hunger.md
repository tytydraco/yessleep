Evolution is a mystifying concept. Traits passed down over decades, all to improve what once was into what will be. In actuality evolution is the entihisis  of change. Truly there is no bounds as to what can be changed by evolution, perhaps one day humans will grow antennas atop their noggins for near hivemind-like communication. And when that day comes, no longer will people need to pay the phone bill, (sigh) still have to pay that off... ERM regardless, evolution is a fascinating topic of study, full of mystery and intrege. Now, this semester you can expect to learn all about genes, DNA , chromosomes....

I remember the simpler times when my field of work was first drip fed to me by the ever eccentric biology teacher Mr. Wingsworth at Jackson High. Sure his rambling got stale quickly, and the frantic need to entertain the masses (AKA uninterested highschools) was certainly not my preferred learning environment. But this would be remembered as my favorite class to this day. Not because the teacher was notable, or because it was easy to get by in. No this class had opened my eyes to endless possibilities. 

Every day at 12:30 after lunch, my time would be spent in deep thought about the future. My future, my children's future, heck the future of the planet. All the what if's, the if only's. I learned, that Evolution and genetics are the building blocks to life itself, and if life could change just like that, there is no telling what is and is not possible. You ever just know when you find something that you want to do for the rest of your life, for me this was it. A few years later, I had earned my PHD in genetics. In that time, I met so many wonderful people and all was good.

 One of my best friends now, I had met on the the very first day in university named Wayne klinks. Wane was the laid back guy who always managed to get things done, albeit his way, I was always angry how easygoing his attitude was. We made good lab partners, and even after university decided to work with this small company near my hometown. The company was focused on genetic plant modification research and development going by the name Synthesis.

 Wane was the one who talked me into it, he said it's local and fairly low-key, pays well and has a decent reputation for such a new company. Synthesis was founded by one man who no one has seen, talking to, or heard from (at least no one working at the lab). Other than that the place felt like home to us two scholars. The team consisted of myself, Wane, two other women, and six men a total of ten. Now that you are all caught to speed, it is time I discuss what really brings me here. 

Our work at Synthesis was not what we thought it would be. Now I'm caught up in something that I may may never return from and the entire world will suffer for what a small team of scientists have done. And it all started with....

THE VILO BERRY

I thought it was odd how we were given so much freedom to do our own research, and run our own experiments, But with one catch. The result had to solve a problem. We were mailed one phrase in the mail by the founder, and only would receive another when the last had been completed to satisfaction. It was that very first order that made clear to me that working here would indeed change the world around us.

 The phrase we received was "world hunger". The room was so quiet, you could hear a pin drop as the saying goes. Not one of us was sure if this was seriously what we had to solve by altering plant DNA. Ha ha happy April first... But no other information was given, and the clock was ticking. We really did have to find a way to solve world hunger right here in this dingy old lab. I wish we could say that we got right to work, but brainstorming ideas took weeks. Larger fruit, no, too  long to cross breed. What about more fruit yeald, yeah but that can get complicated for the plant.

 Then Wane came out of nowhere saying "what about something small that's easy to grow in most environments, and it can be very space efficient. For fruit yeald it can grow 4-8 small berries per cycle". The man who managed the discussion took a glance around at all of us. Eventually saying, " any objections to Mr. Klinks?". Everyone shook their heads. " Then that's settled, now all we need to do is decide what base plants we need to pull this off. 

Three days of research was all we needed to proceed onto the tests. Turns out that grass, you know the stuff most likely to be found in your yard, was prime candidate number one. It grew quickly, had a simple structure to manipulate, and best of all conserved space. The vision was that if this plant were to go public, the lawns across the country would be undeniably bursting with fruitful potential. It would be like a garden stretching the entire property line. It could be grown demesticly, commercial, even remotely. It was our best shot at solving this vague problem from the mailbox.

 Now we needed another parent plant that would serve as the fruit. We wanted a grass-like base with a thicker fruit yealding stem able to support the weight. While researching, one of the women found a particularly rare wild berry spicise. It was unfortunately vine based, meaning that it would be challenging to code a thick stem into the genes of either parent species. It must have been five weeks before the first significant breakthrough, and the rest flowed smoothly here on out.

 My job was to trouble shoot potential issues that the resulting offspring may face developmentally, along with my new partner Kendrick who is much more experienced then I. We came up with two main concerns. First is the competition, specifically weeds and such. That was simple, all there was too it was to develop a more aggressive and intertwined root system that has the added bonus of spreading at a much faster rate. This would also eliminate the need for weed killer, but pesticide will become more necessary in turn.

 The other issue was length, usually grass if un trimmed can grow to unsightly proportions it's why lawn mowers exist, but you already know that. What if we remove the need to trim this plant buy altering it's blade growth. We gave the notes we made to the development team which Wane was part of. After half a year of work there it was, (Vitalis Fructus), or, The Vilo Berry. 

here is the CLASSIFIED information.

To whoever finds this leak, you must understand that I am putting myself at a high risk just to even entertain the idea of the existence of what I'm disclosing. So please understand that it will take time before I get another opportunity to release everything. I will have to slowly get the word out to the public over time. But if doing this will put a stop to what is going on here, than the risk is worth taking.
