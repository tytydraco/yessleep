I work at a construction company and we are renovating this old monastery into a library. The last of the monks decided to sell the building for money and the state of Tennessee bought it make it a heritage site. There is still going to be a library and in addition to adding a bunch of books they are keeping all the ones that were originally here. While renovating the building I found a book detailing how the restructuring of the Spanish inquisition. After reading it I found this story particularly fascinating and wanted to share it.

&#x200B;

When I returned to Spain I could hardly believe my eyes. IT seemed in the relatively short amount of time I had been gone everything had changed. When I returned there was a dark aura around our headquarters in in Madrid. 

At first they almost didn't recognize me, wanting to strip me of my title and authority. For a few days my position was in limbo until the grand Inquisitor Windu returned, recognizing me. He restored my title and I was back to work.

Grand Inquisitor Windu had been promoted from master after the one who took over from Hugo died while I was in captivity. But all the masters knew each other. 

The first thing I did after being reinstated was to go get my lucky bible. I had it stored away for safekeeping, always hoping to return to it. There were lines crossed out and revisions written all through the margins. If this book were to fall into the wrong hands the consequences would be catastrophic. There were some things kept from the common people for good reason.

Hugo also had a similar book to mine, with all his revisions and edits. After he had died I had kept his bible with mine for safe keeping. I brought it as well.

Taking my bible I went to the meal hall where there were many inquisitors waiting to greet me.

"Master Jacob, you look 30 years younger! They said you had de-aged but I hadn't imagined it would be this... noticeable!" a young inquisitor named Pablo said welcomingly.

"Wait till you hear how it happened. It's a long story." I responded.

"We've no time for tale tales today master Jacob" an older inquisitor named Padro chirped. "There's treachery in the inquisition. Some even say Samael is now the grand inquisitor."

"I disappear for 6 months and everyone starts worshiping Samael? When I left it was like 1 in 5. What is wrong with this inquisition! IF only Hugo was here he would know what to do." I said, flabbergasted. 

"It runs deeper still master Jacob. Get your food." Padro said stoically.

I got some good inquisition cooking for the first time in a long time. I said down and gobbled my food, my table manners were gone from my time in the ice palace.

"Grand Inquisitor  Windu is trying to do the unspeakable" Padro said as I noticed everyone at our table was silent.

"...Elaborate? Write it down if you must?" I said between mouthfuls.

"Grand Inquisitor Windu is trying to summon a salamander." he said stoically.

I spit my food out and started coughing. "Is he mad? Why hasn't anyone tried to stop him? Who even made him Grand Inquisitor!"

"So many of the masters have fallen under Samael's control. They actually appointed him." he said solomnley.

"This is madness. A salamander? How can anyone still follow him?"  I said in total disbelief.

"They have started to worship it. They call it the sun lizard now. What would you recommend we do master Jacob?" he questioned.

" Gather everyone who still calls Yahweh their god.

And I will hold a hearing. I think its time we tried our own inquisition." I said full of wrath.

I stood in the amphitheater as hundreds of Inquisitors lined the halls. They stood attentively. I heard many gasps oh shock after people saw how I had de-aged.

"Anyone who is still loyal to Yahweh fall on both knees and we will say the lords prayer in unison." I yelled. 

Everyone cheered and fell to their knees and started praying aloud.

We all said in unison "Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done; on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us-"

Several inquisitors started screaming, with Beelzebub on their faces. They were quickly cut down by the more pious inquisitors.

"Now the second prayer" I yelled.

We all sung in unison "Glory, glory, glory, the lord god t eh almighty, who was and is, and is to come! Please reveal the intolerables!"

Several inquisitors screamed, with the demon of treachery on their faces. They were quickly cut down by the more pious.

I looked at the 200 or so inquisitors who remained. "Thee who stand before me are good, godly men. But the rest of the inquisition has started using Samaelian logic, they have started to worship the sun lizards! We will begin an inquisition of our own base." I screamed, the demon of wrath on my face.

"Where will we hold the prisoners?" One of the inquisitors asked.

"Take no prisoners" I said with a mad blood-lust.

Just then something miraculous happened. My bible flew out of my bag and greeted me. 

"I am Grimoire Blanco. I am a tome that contains the entire history of mankind up until a point. You see there's this little gap that we need to fill in in history. You have lived long and your story must be preserved. I will accompany you to document your life and travels for the archives." the book prophesied.

I was stunned, but wasn't about to let a floating, talking book slow down our inquisition.

"The book is a sign that our lord Yahweh favors our side in this battle! Through god all things are possible. Those who remain in this building have openly renounced our lord! Take no prisoner!" I yelled, rallying the troops a second time.

We went to work as one unit charging upon our Samaelian rivals. WE all knew the building, and used the element of surprise to ambush the traitors.

I charged into a room with 7 men. When they saw my sword drawn Samael appeared on 6 of their faces, Beelzebub on the other.

I quickly fired an arrow, killing Beelzebub. As the other inquisitors ran towards me Grimoire Blanka opened up and spewed a firey goo all over 3 of their faces. 

The others suddenly realized that a floating book was breathing fire like a dragon seemingly lost it. I cut them down in their shock.

"I didn't expect you to be that useful" I said to the book.

"Your going to need me to fight the white witch. And you need Hugo to fight the white witch. And you need me to bring Hugo back. So really you need me more than Hugo" Grimoire Blanco rassberried.

As walked into the next room we found numerous inquisitors, locked in Sword combat.	

"Burn, whorshipers of the sun lizard, you have chosen your death of fire." Grimoire Blanco screamed. 

Blanco was accurate, avoiding friendly fire as he took out the demonic inquisitors.

"Why do you even need me Blanco? Your stealing my kills, we should split up!" I ordered.

"I am here to add to the history books" he said as we walked through a doorway that led into the courtyard.

"Truly an atrocity. He who burns books to rewrite history has no notion of truth. He thinks that what he says and gets others to say actually is. They have killed my kind, now I shall kill there's." Blanco screamed.

He flew above the fire, hovering for a second, then fired straight down, causing the fire to explode, coating the demonic inquisitors around the fire.

"Yahweh is with your troop, the tide is in our favor. We must revive Hugo, before the eclipse is over!" Blanco said, floating back to me.

"Eclipse?" I said, looking up. 

The soon was just starting to cover the sun. 

"What do we need to do?" I asked.

"Did you bring Grimoire Negro with you?" he asked.

"Hugo's bible? Yeah I have it" I responded.

"Cast it into the flames!" he responded.

I hesitated. Wondering for the first time if this book could be trusted. 

"Have faith child." I heard Yahweh say in my head.

Full of sorrow and confusion I cast the book into the smoldering heap at the center of the flames. Almost instantly all the ashes, coals, bodies along with leaves of trees were all sucked into create a burning ball of light.

Grimoire Blanco then flew through the ball, retrieving the other book. It was totally unscathed. The ball of light then formed into a human shape. I then recognized Hugo. 

He stood there for second, then fell to his knees coughing out dust and bits of crushed leaves. 

After a few moments he asked. "Where and when are we?"

"Madrid, 1728" I said as walked forward and hugged him.

"I have been gone that long? I have come back to kill the white witch. When I died I told Yahweh that I was the only one who could kill her now, she has become too powerful. We can no longer banish Samael but we can kill that witch and make him start a new." Hugo said coursing with holly energy.

"Well for now we need to try our own inquisition. They have started using samaelian logic, and even The Grand Inquisitor Windu has taken a liking to it."  I said.

Rage boiled in Hugo's eyes. "The treacherous swine have taken over the inquisition that quickly? We need to try them immediately" Hugo said with a smile.

"Worse yet they seek to summon a salamander" I said plainly.

"Kill them all" he screamed, and we were off.

It almost felt like the old days. Except we had magical bibles that were burning and freezing people. Grimoire Negro would freeze people solid like statues.

 I really wanted to just sit and talk to Hugo. So much had happened in the past 25 years and I really just wanted to catch up. Unfortunately there was work to be done.

Before long we came out the front gate, following a billow of smoke to see a huge burning blaze of books, surrounded by demonic inquisitors. Grand Inquisitor Windu was there, throwing black powder on the fire. There were also many maidens tied up, seemingly to be sacrificed. 

Just then, the moon completely covered the sun in a total solar eclipse. Vines of fire came down from the sun and interacted with the blaze. Master Inquisitor Windu then ordered for the virgins to be sacrificed.

Me and Hugo then charged towards then men carrying maidens cutting them down. 

The men scatted as they were pelted with liquid fire and the freezing liquid. 

Grand inquisitor Windu was controlling the fire and it was staking shape into a massive salamander. 

Just as I cut him down I saw the eyes start to form, and thought all hope was lost. But then it dissipated and the fire returned to normal.

I stood there, with a renewed hope as the eclipse ended. 

We rounded up the remaining demonic inquisitors, killing them all. But the Spanish inquisition was not the force it once was. More than half of the inquisitors had turned. 

We left a Skeleton crew in Spain and diverted all available forces to return to the ice palace. We left with 2 Manowar and Hugo's flagship. 150 inquisitors in total. 

Hugo and I had plenty of time to talk on the almost 2 month voyage to the new world. I told him everything about what had happened. We talked for hours each day, happy just to be together again.

We are wintering here again, at this monastery in Louisiana, and in the spring will return to the Ice palace, to kill the witch witch.

In case we do not return  I record this here so that my contemporaries and future generations may have a true account of what happened when Samael become head of the Spanish inquisition.
