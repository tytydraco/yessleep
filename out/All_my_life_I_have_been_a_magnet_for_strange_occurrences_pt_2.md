Childhood. 


The grass of my childhood home was warm and inviting. The boundaries of the yard were vast and even so the fence never felt like a cage to hold me but a barrier to keep others out. The 100 acres of woods past that fence was even more vast and felt like its own self contained universe. The island of a naive little universe. Saddled with my spiritual and physical companions I would venture out. Two large dogs by my side, taller than my own fragile form, India and Cleo, the yin and yang. One with the spirit of a hunter and the other with the jaws of a predator my heart never wavered for a moment nor never considered any danger. I was armed with knowledge, poured into me by my elders so my hands knew what to grab and where to hold and how to craft and my mind was an encyclopedia of preparations. Venture often and venture wide I did, but always turned around when the fences of houses began to appear on the horizon. Many times we stumbling across odd things and strange spirits. 


Fortunate for me, the dogs knew best not to leave my side mostly for my protection not their own. The vivid memories stick in my neurons, in the modern age of warnings from viral witches this information never struck me as new. As a child, there were many instances where I wondered upon strange paths and apparitions. One such day while picking wild herbs and plants to press into my drying press, I happened upon a hedge maze of wild roses.


 The appears of the maze was a result of regular deer and wildlife traffic through the thorny meadow. This was made apparent by the sudden appearance of a heard of deer which met me with a surprising closeness. The dogs remained still and quiet by my side, showing no signs of danger. Reaching out a naive hand to brush against the snout as I made a soft and gentle approach towards the massive horned buck when just as my finger tips met the soft wet snout the animals began to turn and dive into the maze. The buck moved swiftly just behind and rest and with instinct and purpose I began to follow. Cleo laid down and began to whine while India followed me with a measured excitement as we wove through the ever narrowing path. 


Soon the path began to narrow so much that even with my hands above my head I could not avoid the thorns from catching in my clothes. India began to whine and poke her snout against my leg and mid-section as I grew increasingly more frantic to free myself. My eyes were trained on the quickly disappearing white tail of the massive buck who did not turn to see whether I had followed once. Cleo began to bark in the distance which caused India to become more frantic in her whines and prodding of me. Her paws clawed messily but purposefully at the branches of the bushes until I could be free and once I had a hand to use I was more capable. India instinctively grabs onto my clothes, pulling at me like a stray puppy until I finally began to move freely. She dragged me backwards until the path opened up again, never allowing me to go back despite my overwhelming desire every time I turned to look back. We left the maze, greeted by Cleo with her wagging tail. She jumped around us and sniffed thoroughly to make sure we were alright before leading the way home with purpose. 


The path was never seen again. 


Nor were the mysterious disembodied stairs, the strange man in the suit, or the Native American woman and child.
