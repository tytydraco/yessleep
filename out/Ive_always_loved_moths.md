I’ve always loved moths.

&#x200B;

From the checkerboard of the Argent and Sable to the sunset vista of a Dark Bordered Beauty, I’ve loved them in their shades of brown, black and gold, their bodies open umbrellas, collecting condensation on the window pane. As a child, when all the rest of the world was asleep, I’d move my bedside lamp to the windowsill and watch them appear like revellers to a midnight ball.

I gave them voices.

‘Let me in.’ said one.

‘I just want to be inside where it’s warm and cosy!’ piped up another. 

Above all I think it made me feel powerful. Did you know moths like light because they think it’s the moon? They’re guided by it, like the tides. And sitting there in my polyester pyjamas I wasn’t Charlie. I was the moon. My face even looked like it, reflected against the black of the glass.

So years later, when a friend of a friend told me about his moth traps, I was intrigued.

We were in The Dog and Bull after a birthday dinner, and I’d been dully aware he did something to do with conservation and birds but had no idea of his other secret passion. Moths. 

“It’s a box with an opening – a light mounted above it. They get attracted to the light and fall into the box and can’t get out again.”

“But what do you do with them?”

“Take a look in the morning and see what I’ve got,” he shrugged. “If I don’t have time to do it before I go to work, I’ll keep them inside until I get home.”

“Inside?” exclaimed a tipsy friend. “Like a menagerie?”

“Somewhere cool. It slows down their metabolism so they can go longer without food,” he explained – enjoying holding court over the table of stragglers. 

“Phew.” Winked the tipsy friend, though she obviously didn’t care.

“Got any pictures?” I asked.

A week later, I was setting up the trap in the garden. Autumn was rolling in, a certain chill and unplaceable melancholy in the air. 

My wife came out into the garden, having slipped on a pair of my shoes and a gilet neither of us wanted but both wore nonetheless.

“I hope you don’t get too many.”

“I hope I get any.”

She shuddered.

“Moths used to eat my clothes. That’s what I know them for. Always mine, never my brothers’.”

“They were attracted to how bright you were.”

Bright in the sense of her halo of blonde cropped hair – bright in the sense she was a doctor, and I had a work-at-home admin job that could be done with anyone with a half-dozen brain cells.

“I can’t come into work all moth-eaten. Don’t bring them inside, alright?”

“Oh, should I take your wedding dress out of the box then?”

She slapped me on gently on the wrist and shuffled inside. A pigeon flew lengthwise down the garden and out and above into the field beyond. 

\-

The next morning, I peered in with a flashlight and was surprised to see hundreds of them – hundreds upon hundreds – huddled into corners, sitting there still and patient and somehow sullen, all sizes and all shades, their papery wings poised for sudden flight. 

An app on my phone identified them.

&#x200B;

*Scoliopteryx libatrix*

&#x200B;

*Mormo maura*

&#x200B;

*Opisthograptis luteolata*

&#x200B;

That last one was a vivid, lichen green with two pips on the outer-wings like slanted, sneering eyes. 

I was a little bit repelled. Not by them, but by how much I longed to keep them. I felt the sudden urge to bring them inside, maybe put them in the house like that friend of a friend had suggested – so I could sort through them again later. 

I opened the box and set them free. Only…they didn’t go – just sat patiently, waiting for something. I left the garden and checked some emails.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In the evening they were still there, though I’d turned the light off. They waited. And I felt curiously drawn to them. 

It struck me that they might be happier inside.

&#x200B;

\-

&#x200B;

First, I set them on the kitchen table. Then, it occurred to me that they might be more comfortable in the living room. I sat with them a while, watching them flutter within the confines of their nest but never leave it. Something still wasn’t right. 

As night fell, and I watched them and their stillness, I often wondered if they were still alive, even. Then I’d nudge a furry antenna with my finger, and it would respond, a tiny body talking, if not a mind. 

I got so tired myself that, almost without meaning to, I brought them into our bedroom.

My wife came home about that time. She opened the bedroom door and I quickly pushed the box under the bed.

“How was your day?” I asked.

“Hellish. Days like this, I just wish I could turn my brain…off. You know?”

When I was sure she was asleep, I put the box in the closet.

\-

&#x200B;

When my alarm went off, I almost instinctively went for the closest to check on them. I’d slept soundly. It was only when I noticed my wife still beside me in bed that it occurred to me.

She was staring blankly at the ceiling, the covers pulled up to her neck.

“Didn’t your shift start at 8?”

She turned to me with an uncertain slowness, staring as if she didn’t recognise me.

“My shift? Of course.”

Then she sprang up, and with an instinctiveness that must be muscle-deep, threw off her pyjamas and put on her workwear, which she’d slung over a chair. 

I heard her feet on the stairs, the door open and close hurriedly. I watched from the window as she began to walk the wrong way towards the bus stop.

&#x200B;

\-

I tried calling her but there was no answer until about 1pm, at which point she texted:

DON’T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING. WOKE UP LATE, CAUGHT A BUS OUT OF TOWN? SO MUCH TO CATCH UP OON. 

I assured her that it would all be fine – she was a dream employee, after all. It was then that I thought to check on the friends I’d smuggled in the night before, cursing my stupidity at putting them in the closet – precisely where my wife didn’t want them.

When I opened the box, I was surprised to see only about half of them were still there. Where had the others gone? I shook out the coats and dresses that were hanging up but there was no flutter of wings or falling bodies.

I shrugged, got back to work.

\-

My wife came home upset.

“I was so slow today. And sometimes, the answers just didn’t come. Saw a patient presenting with abdominal pain, constipation, fatigue – couldn’t even think what tests to run.”

I assured her but that had worried me.

“Maybe you’re tired – take the day off. Have a duvet day tomorrow.”

She shook her head and took a large gulp of wine. 

“I hate staying in bed. There’s nothing for your mind to do.”

\-

But the next morning she insisted. She spoke falteringly and I thought without a doubt that she must be ill – exhaustion, maybe?

“Don’t be too hard on yourself.” I whispered. “Do you want to hear about what I did the other day?”

I opened the closet, revealing the box with the moths in.

“Exactly the opposite of what you said. Luckily the clothes are spotless – I checked. No holes.”

She looked at me, then the box, then me again.

“What?”

“The moths.”

“The what?”

I picked up the box and lifted it onto the bed, but there was nothing inside to show her.

\-

She’s been getting worse. Someone from work came round but she didn’t recognise them – begged me not to pen the door. When I did, they were shocked at the state of her. I don’t know why I didn’t think to put something on her but the colleague seemed more embarrassed than I was.

She left. But before she did I told her-

She’s been getting worse. She forgets so much. She told me that whoever I am I have to help her. But I’ve forgotten. What’s wrong with her?

She’s been getting worse.

She’s my wife. My wife. 

Worse has been getting my wife.

What’s the word for what she is?

Love.

Loveeeeeeeeee
