Fine, you win. I’ll tell you how I met her.

There are no seasons in Puerto Rico. The whole damn year is summer.
That being said, I feel like I met her in the fall—September or October.
It just feels like a story suited for fall.

I don’t believe in fate, or that we have a predestined future.
But it must have been fate.
The sun was going down, the sky stained with that yellowish glow—and there she was, walking down the road, heading out of town.
Wearing a beautiful white dress.
She was a vision to behold.
Like something divine.

I was driving to work, but I couldn’t help myself.
I slowed down and offered her a ride.
She looked down into the car with a warm smile on her face and said she would definitely like that.

I noticed a blackish tear down her cheek.
We exchanged the usual formalities. She told me her name was Alba and put out a cigarette.
I didn’t waste time—I offered her a light.

I asked her why she was so sad.

She said the man of her dreams had broken her heart.

I was speechless.
What can one say to a broken heart to help mend it?
I just nodded and kept driving.
No destination—just silence.
The kind that hurts when nothing is spoken.

We kept driving like that for a while.p
There was something about her that made me want to help her.
To make her smile.
And an idea popped into my head.

“You ever been to a carnival?” I asked.
She smiled faintly and said it had been a long time.

“Oh, I know where to go.”

I parked on a dirt road, close to where the Ferris wheel spun like a slow-moving clock.
She walked beside me, barefoot, toes brushing the grass.
I offered to buy her cotton candy.
She said, “Pink. Always pink.”

We rode the carousel. Then the swings.
She laughed.
And it sounded like a soft love song to my ears.
For a moment, I had to look away, I felt that by looking at her, I was committing some kind of sacrilegious act.

A band played not too far away. She grabbed my hand and pulled me close.
We danced under the stars, and for a moment, time stood still.

After that, we kept driving.
The night seemed eternal and I didn’t want it to end.

I realized I wanted to protect this girl from the world’s cruelty.
I wanted to be her shining knight.
To keep making her smile.

Next, I took us to a beach I knew, there’s usually something happening there at night.
And I wasn’t wrong.

The bonfire was alive.
Guys playing guitar.
Couples dancing.
And there she was, smiling.
Like a divine blessing to my soul.

No one noticed we didn’t belong.
We danced again, feet in the sand, arms wide open.
She looked like she was trying to catch the stars.

The firelight kissed her skin, and for a moment, I forgot she was even human.

The bonfire dwindled to embers.
The guitar strumming faded into the hum of the waves.

We stayed there on the shore, sitting close.
Her head rested on my shoulder.
The sand was cool beneath my hands, and the horizon hinted at gray, dawn creeping in.

I didn’t want to move.
I felt like if I did, I’d break something fragile.
Her presence was heavy, like the night itself was holding its breath.

Eventually, she stood, brushing sand from her dress.
She didn’t say a word. Just looked at me with those eyes, eyes that held too much.
I got up, and we walked back to the car.
Her footsteps were quiet in the dark.
The magic of the night still clung to us, but it was thinning. Slipping away.

I started the engine.
She gave me her address in that same soft, distant voice.

I pulled up to the house she’d pointed to—a small place swallowed in shadows.
She stepped out, her white dress glowing faintly under the streetlight.
Before she turned to go, she looked back at me. Her eyes, steady and piercing.

“Some nights are borrowed,” she said.

And then she walked to the house.
I watched her go, her words sinking into me like a stone.
And then I drove off, into the fading dark.

“Some nights are borrowed.”

I couldn’t sleep.
That sentence haunted me.
It chased me through the hours, tangled itself into my thoughts.
So the next day—I went to her house.

I knocked on the door.
A woman opened it—older, worn. But the resemblance was there. Her mother.

“Hi,” I said. “I’m looking for Alba.”

She went pale. Her eyes widened.
Her hand clutched at her chest trembling like something invisible had struck her.

“That’s impossible,” she whispered. “Alba… my daughter… she died ten years ago.”
