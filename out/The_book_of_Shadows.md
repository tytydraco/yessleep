The last memory I had  of my grandfather was hearing him scream as the the shadows in the field began to surround him with thin, web like fibers. Then my mother picked me up and ran with me in her arms back into our old farm house.

My last memory, that is until last night, when I awakened to a tinkling bell in an unknown vault so immense I couldn't see the walls or the ceiling. Far away  I saw a dull light and heard the faint tinkling of a  bell, incessantly ringing. I followed the sound  till I could see him on  a throne, which seemed to have merged with his body, leaving only his fingers free.


The acrid scent of burning wax and a lurking fear clung to the borders of the dream, if a dream  it was. There, in the dim candle glow, sat my grandfather, his weathered face, a thousand years older than when I'd last seen him, etched with a desperate urgency.  The same face I'd last seen contorted in a scream as he was swallowed by the shadows that had consumed him years ago.

"Elias," his voice, as dry as the dust that blanketed his entire body,  said "You must listen. The darkness… it returns. Stronger this time." Terror struck my heart like a dagger, the memory of that horrifying night vivid even after all these years.

He pointed to a small table, on top of which lay an ancient  leather book. "The Book of Repelling Shadows," he whispered. "Hidden all these years in my library… find the spell. You'll know it by the seven ravens on the preceding page. Recite it, Elias. It's the only way to banish the darkness and save yourself from my terrible fate. Go!!"

The dream dissolved, I awoke in a cold sweat, back in my bed. My heart pounded, like a drum, a rhythm of dread mixed with a sliver of desperate hope. I knew I must find the book or suffer the same choking embrace of eldritch shadows that had cursed our family for generations. Had my grandfather finally learned the secret to banish  them forever? I had to find that book before they  returned to claim me.


The book was, as He'd said it would be, in the family library. Written in an strange tongue, I frantically turned page after page till I discovered a page, on which were drawn seven ravens. On the opposite page there was written a single spell.  The script was a simple gothic alphabet which I could recite, even though the language was unfamiliar.

Days bled into nights as I poured over the archaic script, the cryptic letters writhing like snakes before my sleep-deprived eyes. The passage was an incantation which seemed to promise the banishment of shadows. Relief washed over me, freedom from the ancient curse within my grasp. Tomorrow, I would face the darkness, armed with my grandfather's book.

The next night, I stood in the field behind the farmhouse. The moon was casting long, menacing shadows across the grass.  Clutching the book, my voice trembled as I began the chant. The shadows seemed to peer into me, responding to the power of the words. Then, a flicker in the corner of my eye. A single tendril of darkness began to creep back from me, melting into the others.

Suddenly, I felt powerful even joyous as I recited the passages. I'd done it. I'd outwitted the very essence of darkness, using the power of the grimoire in my grandfathers library to turn it back. But as I closed the book , a flicker of unease sparked in my mind.

The symbols on the cover seemed different somehow. The incantation I'd recited sounded wrong as it paused, seeming to hang in the air . Anxiety began to overtake me, I felt a cold  fear creeping down my spine. The shadows, weren't retreating as I believed but were surging forward with a malevolent hunger.

Frantic, I flipped through the pages, searching for the passage, the one that had repelled the darkness. But there were no  ravens to be found, only a chilling emptiness where the spell had been moments ago.  In my desperation, a horrifying realization dawned. This wasn't the Book of Banishing Shadows. It had never been.

The reality crashed over me like a tidal wave. My grandfather had been dead long ago. That old man on the throne wasnt him. All along, I'd been an unwitting pawn, duped by the darkness itself into unleashing the very thing I feared the most. The shadows I'd "banished" were now dancing joyously, in the pale moonlight.

My scream, lost in the encroaching darkness, was the last sound the world would ever hear from me. I was slowly being enveloped by the very shadows I so naively believed I'd repelled. The  book, now fallen at my feet, in a  cruel mockery of hope, lay closed. Its true title now plain to see in the last rays of the setting moon  - The Book of Summoning Shadows.
