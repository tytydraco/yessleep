I never liked going to my grandfather’s house. It was old and dusty and full of junk. He was a hoarder, collecting all kinds of things over the years. He had books, magazines, newspapers, records, tapes, CDs, DVDs, VHSs, cassettes, posters, paintings, sculptures, figurines, toys, games, puzzles, cards, stamps, coins, medals, trophies, souvenirs, memorabilia, antiques, artifacts, and more. He had so much stuff that he barely had any space to live.  
  
He died a few months ago, leaving me as his only heir. I inherited his house and everything in it. I didn’t want any of it. I just wanted to sell it and get rid of it as soon as possible. But before I could do that, I had to sort through his belongings and decide what to keep and what to throw away.  
  
It was a daunting task. It would take me weeks, maybe months, to go through everything. I decided to start with the attic. It was the most cluttered and chaotic part of the house. It was also the most mysterious and intriguing. My grandfather never let me go up there when I was a kid. He said it was too dangerous and too dirty. He said there were things up there that I shouldn’t see or touch.  
  
I was curious and rebellious. I always wanted to go up there and explore. But I never got the chance. Until now.  
  
I climbed up the ladder and opened the hatch. A cloud of dust greeted me as I entered the attic. It was dark and musty. The only light came from a small window at the far end of the room. The floor was covered with boxes and bags and crates and trunks and suitcases and chests and barrels and baskets and bins and buckets and cans and jars and bottles and more. The walls were lined with shelves and cabinets and closets and drawers and racks and hooks and pegs and more. The ceiling was hung with lamps and lanterns and chandeliers and candles and torches and more.  
  
It was a mess. It was a treasure trove.  
  
I grabbed a flashlight and started digging through the piles of stuff. I found all kinds of things: clothes, shoes, hats, gloves, scarves, ties, belts, bags, wallets, purses, jewelry, watches, glasses, sunglasses, masks, wigs, costumes; tools, knives, scissors, hammers, screwdrivers, pliers, wrenches, saws, drills, nails, screws, bolts, nuts, washers; instruments, guitars, pianos, violins, flutes, trumpets, drums, harmonicas; sports equipment, balls, bats, rackets, clubs, sticks, gloves, helmets; and more.  
  
I felt like I was in a museum or a thrift store or a garage sale or a flea market or a junkyard or a landfill or a gold mine or a nightmare or a dream.  
  
I spent hours in the attic, rummaging through my grandfather’s stuff. I didn’t notice the time passing by. I didn’t hear the phone ringing or the doorbell buzzing or the mailman knocking or the neighbor shouting or the dog barking or the cat meowing or the bird chirping or the clock ticking or anything else.  
  
I was lost in a world of my own.  
  
Then I found it.  
  
It was hidden under a pile of blankets in a corner of the room. It looked like an old radio. It had a wooden case with a metal grill on the front. It had a dial on the side with numbers from 0 to 100. It had a knob on the top with symbols for on/off/volume/tune. It had an antenna on the back that could be extended or retracted. It had a cord on the bottom that could be plugged into an outlet.  
  
It looked like a relic from the 1950s.  
  
I wondered if it still worked.  
  
I decided to plug it in and see for myself.  
  
I cleared some space on the floor and set the radio down. I looked for an outlet nearby and found one behind a bookcase. I moved the bookcase aside and plugged the cord into the outlet.  
  
Nothing happened.  
  
I turned the knob on the top to on.  
  
Nothing happened.  
  
I turned it back to off.  
  
Nothing happened.  
  
I turned it back to on.  
  
Nothing happened.  
  
I turned it back to off.  
  
Nothing happened.  
  
I turned it back to on.  
  
Something happened.  
The radio turned on.  
  
It started playing static.  
  
I was surprised and curious. I wondered if I could tune it to a station. I turned the knob on the top to tune.  
  
The static changed.  
  
I heard different sounds: music, voices, noises, silence.  
  
I kept turning the knob, looking for something interesting.  
  
I found nothing.  
  
I was bored and disappointed. I thought the radio was broken or useless. I decided to turn it off and throw it away.  
  
Then I heard a voice.  
  
It was faint and distorted, but I could make out some words. It said “Hello? Is anyone there? Please help me.”  
  
I was shocked and curious. Who was this? Where were they? I grabbed the microphone and replied “Hello? Who are you?”  
  
There was a pause, then the voice said “Thank God. You can hear me. My name is David. I’m trapped in a dark place. I don’t know where I am. Please help me.”  
  
I asked him how he got there and how he could communicate with me. He said he didn’t remember anything. He just woke up in a pitch-black room with no windows or doors. He found the radio on a table and turned it on. He said he had been trying to contact someone for days, but no one answered until now.  
  
I was baffled and scared. Was this some kind of prank? A hoax? A hallucination? Or was this real? Was there really someone trapped in a dark place, calling for help through an old radio? And if so, how could I help him? How could I find him?  
  
I decided to keep talking to him and try to figure out what was going on. I asked him more questions, but he didn’t have any answers. He said he was hungry, thirsty, and cold. He said he felt like he was losing his mind. He begged me to help him.  
  
I felt sorry for him and wanted to help him, but I didn’t know what to do. I thought about calling the police, but what would I tell them? They would think I was crazy or lying. I thought about searching online for clues, but I didn’t have any information to go on. I thought about leaving the radio and forgetting about it, but I couldn’t do that to him.  
  
I was stuck in a dilemma. I had no idea who this person was or where he was or how he got there or why he could talk to me through an old radio. But I knew he was suffering and needed help. And I was the only one who could hear him.  
  
I'm currently out of state, it was stupid of me to not take the radio with me, we'll come back in a few months, but until then I don't know what's gonna happen to him, I hope he'll still be there, healthy and alive.
