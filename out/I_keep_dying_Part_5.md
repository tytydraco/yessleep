I gave Sawyer the other two phones. He seemed like a kid in a candy shop at the idea of talking to the old himself. “I've always talked to myself. Now I am *really* talking to myself!” So I left him to his devices, with my duplicate devices.

I strolled through the halls, letting myself get lost. Sawyer gave me a master keycard, so I had full access to every room. “Don't go dying on me, now,” Sawyer chuckled, nudging my shoulder. And no, surprisingly that did not kill me.

It was about 2pm, and many of the staff were just getting back from lunch. “Hoho, what do we have here?” Sam wrapped an arm over my shoulder, knocking me down with him as he lost his balance. I glared at him the entire time as we dragged my fresh corpse back to Sawyer's room. Staff passed by, giving us a wide berth. Thankfully, no one asked questions.

“No one seems to care?” I thought aloud. “Bro, didn't we already go over this? I am pretty sure we have a multicellular amalgamation of the bubonic plague, masquerading as a mouse infestation,” Sam scoffed. “Huh-wait hold on. You can't just drop that on me and carry on like nothing!” I demanded, suddenly very aware of any holes in the baseboards.

“Why are you worried?” Sam snickered. “You'd probably just come right ba-” he trailed off “ooh! That would be interesting! What would happen if you got violently ill? Could you even?” Sam began talking to himself with many unsavory ideas that frankly, I had no interest in being part of. Not that I had much of a say in the matter.

After we left the corpse with the man undergoing a four-way call with himself, Sam decided we would seek out the quadrupedal, literal plague rats. We made our way to the perishable storage. God why did they do half the shit in there.

Astronaut style suits stood right inside the entrance. Sam saw the perplexed look on my face, and explained “temp regulation and contamination,” as if that made much sense. Sam helped put mine on, realizing he had put it on me, backwards, undoing then doing it properly. I protested, concerned at the result of if I died, would I be exposed to the hazards, but Sam blew me off entirely.

We entered a nearly absolute zero freezer, the chemical taste from the oxygen tank spreading like synthetic oil, over my tongue. The suits did their job, keeping us comfortable.

“I suspect we may find the plague rat colony rather qui-gah!” Sam cried as a dark, almost amorphous blob of a creature flung itself at him. I stood, frozen, unsure of what to do. My fragility drastically limited my options, and I was all too aware of it. Sam writhed, fighting with the thing that almost seemed to use suction cups to latch on. Two more approached, gliding up his legs and skittering around, just out of reach. “They can't,” he grunted, “get in.” Sam panted, finally giving up and letting the things run wild.

“We tricked em into liking cheese,” Sam said, as he presented the periodic cheese wall. It was literally labeled that, and curiosity got the better of me. “What's with the cheese wall?” I asked, prompting Sam to do that tiny standing jump kids do, when they're finally told they can do something they're always told they can't. “So glad you asked!” He cheered. “I can see that,” I replied.

“My personal passion project. Elemental cheeses!” He threw his hands to either side, presenting his display. I took the bait, squinting while asking “what does that mean?” “Well,” he started, inhaling sharply. “I wanted to try and mix my major, chemistry, with my minor in the culinary arts.” Sam waited for me to acknowledge him, so I nodded. I was not seeing where this was going. “Well, I mixed various metal salts, and used them in cheese cultures.” Sam smiled ear to ear with pride, which made zero sense to me with how little it made sense. “So you made metal cheese?” I felt stupid just asking.

“Precisely! I managed to turn every element into cheese! Even the radioactive ones!” Sam bounced in ecstatic glee. “Did you really have to shape them into the numbers?” I groaned at the literal and metaphoric cheesiness. “Hold on, something's missing…” Sam trailed off, surveying the large freezer.

“What's missing?” I asked, looking around from my position in the middle of the room. “The last twenty, the radioactive series. Someone must've moved it, I'll just check the log,” he stated, then fell eerily silent. After he didnt speak for a couple minutes, I grew concerned.

“No one… signed the log…” Sam said dryly. The otherwise innocuous sentence sent a shiver down my spine. “So what, someone forgot to sign the log?” I pressed, already sensing this was a bad sign. “We always sign everything. Paper trails are a must for finding a means of resolving any issue that may arise. No one would forget to sign a log. No one removed my baby.” Sam rambled. I almost laughed when he called the cheese his baby, but the shift in his tone held the laughter in my throat.

“So it's in here, still?” I asked, anxious at the direction things were moving. “No, but something is…” Sam said cryptically. Right then, he'll broke loose. The cheese wall exploded into reddish black blobs, scurrying around, washing over everything in a wave. The flood crashed down on us in full force, killing me instantly. The next moment, I was ankle deep in the slimy bastards.

I peered down, regretting my choice immediately. The plague rat things had found a way into the suit, likely thanks to the icicle that had impaled my… corpse? Something was seriously wrong this time. The body, my dead body. It was moving. It was writhing under the mass of rats, but not in a wild way. It was almost methodical, controlled.

Then it got worse.

The. Body. Sat. Up.

The icicle slashed through the corpse, but it didn't seem to mind. I did not feel like waiting to see what happened next. I waded through the churning rats, reached down, and pulled Sam upright. He was unresponsive, but the suit didn't seem impaired. I pulled Sam behind me as I approached the exit.

We broke through the pool of plague rats, into the decontamination area. I pushed Sam out of the way, then fought the hatch shut. A red light began flashing as a robotic voice blared “CONTAMINATION IDENTIFIED. BEGINNING DECONTAMINATION PROTOCOL.” 

Fucking. Flamethrowers.

The decomtamination protocol was fucking flamethrowers. They gradually lowered from the ceiling, spraying horizontally. I saw what hell was like. Sam sat in fetal position as the flames singed the dark smudges of the rats off of him. The suit… protected me for an instant…

The minute long fire killed me a single time, interestingly. I respawned as the fire died down. Then it was a bleach rinse. High pressure jets of a chlorine cocktail blasted us all over. Each punch from the jet left me in a new body.

We ended up in a knee deep pool of me's. No sugar coding it. We were out of the puddle and into the deep end, wading through my corpses. We were nearly buried, sure, but there were no signs of the rats.

A speaker rang out, “CONTAMINANTS REMOVED. HAVE A GOOD DAY.”
