That was what I was presented with less than ten minutes after I walked into their office for the first time. A cheesy introductory video that somehow served to simultaneously make me cringe and terrify me. Unfortunately, I didn't have much of a choice but to work here. I'd been fired from my last job for some basic misconduct- and the one before that. I wasn't a bad worker, I usually show up on time and I don't cause any drama, but when someone gives me shit on the phone, I can't help myself. After being bound to niceties and serving those on the other end of my headsets like a slave, telling an entitled, self-absorbed asshat to "fuck off" is one of the most satisfying things on the planet. 

Unfortunately, the sticks in HR tend not to agree. 

With two terminations on my record, getting a decent paying job was proving tough. It was pretty humiliating, attending interviews only for them to question why I left my last roles. I lie, of course, tell them I was looking for something with more prospects, but after they perform background checks and get the references they need, it all falls apart. I ended up desperate. I needed money or I'd end up homeless, or at best, stuck in some stinking, mouldy flat where my neighbour would sooner stab me than lend me a bag of sugar. That's when I'd gotten the call. 

"Hello Mr Stern." The voice came, almost entirely monotone. It was low, sounding almost dazed. 

"Hello?" I gave my slightly confused answer, disquieted by the timbre of his voice. 

"We understand you have been looking for employment."

"Oh, yeah, I have- did you get my details from the recruitment site?"

"We would like to offer you a role as an agent at our prestigious company, KING Sales Group. Do you have the time for a brief interview?"

I quickly moved past the fact he had ignored my question when he spoke of offering me the job, clearing my throat and trying to sound more professional. 

"Of course! What would you like to ask?"

"First question. Can you operate a telephone and computer?"

"Y-Yeah, I've worked in call centres all my-"

"Second question. Would you consider yourself easily frightened?"

He'd cut me off, but his second question made me stop and think. It was a weird thing to ask, but I guessed it was part of their profiling process. 

"Uh... No, not really, I'm always open to trying new things. I consider myself-"

"Third question. Do you have a spouse or any children?"

The brazen interruptions were getting old fast, but I swallowed my pride. I needed the job. 

"No."

"Thank you for answering our questions. We will post our onboarding documents to you promptly. Please read and sign them, then bring them with you to hand in tomorrow."

He ended the call there, before I could ask any further questions. I had mixed feelings. Relief that I'd actually been offered a job, concern that said job would be bottom of the barrel sales work, but above all else, confusion. I'd never had an interview like that, and it didn't exactly paint any sort of picture of who I was. Either way, I'd apparently ticked the boxes. As long as it let me pay my rent, I'd try to stick with it. I looked up the company he had mentioned, KING Sales Group, but information was pretty sparse. I did find a couple of mentions of them working under some big-name brands to peddle their stuff. I leaned back and sighed. Great. Cold calling. 

That same day, the papers came through my door. Inside the envelope that had my address details on it, was a second, smaller envelope, branded with a golden crown and the acronym KING. Classy... The contents were certainly something. Several pages of legal miscellany, and while I had intended to comb through it for anything suspicious, I was yawning by the second paragraph. I focused on looking for mention of pay rate, but when I saw the words 'commission-based' I just about gagged. This was a tough pill to swallow, but after messing up my life like I had, I'd need to get it down one way or another. Skipping to the end, I signed on the dotted line without much thought, took note of the address they listed, and settled down for the night. I made sure I'd picked out my best business-casual attire and my least dirty shoes, ready for my 'big day'. 

When morning rolled around, I put on my shitty shirt and tie, tied my shitty laces, got in my shitty car and drove to my shitty new job. I followed the online map on my phone down the motorway, until finally it had me take the exit to a sparsely populated parking lot surrounding my destination. As I pulled in, I craned my neck up to look through my windshield at the building, looming tall above. I counted maybe six or seven stories, lacking any sort of artistic architectural design in its huge, blocky structure. It was a wonderful capitalist monument of concrete and glass... Something about it unnerved me, made my palms sweat. Just nervous for my first day, right?

Swallowing, I looked around. There wasn't much greenery, a few token trees on islands of grass surrounded by stone. I could still hear the zooming of cars on the dual carriageway behind me, smell the smoke of their emissions. While this place looked pretty run-down, the cars in the lot were all expensive. While I wanted to take that as a good sign, it somehow made me even more wary. I considered turning around and driving home, but remembered that if I didn't stick it out here, I likely wouldn't have that home for much longer. Steeling myself for a weird and inevitably stressful day, I made my way to the entrance. 

The tinted automatic doors didn't open for me as I approached, so I squinted my eyes to peer through the glass. I could see that sat behind the front desk was a security guard, a bald guy with a dark goatee. He hadn't noticed me, focused on something behind his desk. After waiting a minute, I knocked on the glass, causing him to look up. He didn't make any move to let me in, so I held up my files and spoke loud enough for him to hear through the pane. "Here for the job!"

The man's brow raised at this, before he pushed something that caused the doors to slide open for me to enter. Immediately, I was hit with a heavy smell of stale air, like old carpet and damp mould. Trying not to pull a face, I approached the desk and placed the folder down. 
"Hey there, I'm Isaac Stern, I'm supposed to be starting in sales today?"

The guard eyed the papers, but didn't touch them before he looked back up at me. "You read the fine print?" 

I licked my dry lips, blinking once. Was everyone who worked for this company a dick? "Uhh, yeah. Commission-based. I'm fine with it."

He sucked his teeth, shaking his head. He placed a lanyard with a red key-card on the desk as he spoke. "Sorry bud. Fourth floor. Take the stairs."

Frowning, I took the card and turned to the lifts at the end of the lobby. There were four of them, and none looked out of order. "Right... Thanks." As I scanned through the door heading into the stairwell, I briefly thought about why he might've apologised like that, before the creaky door closed behind me with an echoing click. The stairs were quiet, dimly lit by old lights that gave off a barely-audible electric buzz. I looked up through the little gap between the stairs that ascended all the way to the top floor, an arrow-slit of vision that made me feel a little hit of vertigo. Shaking it off, I sighed, and began my ascent. The dirty material covering the steps had a chequered pattern along their edges, the whites all turned grey from age and neglect. I started to feel a little strain in my legs as I went along, passing the second floor, and so began to lean more on the black bannister, gripping it for support as I pulled myself up and along.

Leaning over the railing, I panted for breath, then stopped in my tracks. Narrowing my eyes, something had caught my attention through that window of vision the gap between floors presented. A couple of floors below me, where I had just been, I could make out what looked like someone standing on the ground floor. It looked like a person, staring up at me... My chest rose and fell as I stared back, my heart thumping, blood audible in my ears. I opened my mouth to call out, break the ice of the awkward encounter, but somehow I knew this wasn't one of my coworkers-to-be. Its face was pale, gauntly thin, wide dark eyes that-... that didn't blink. It also looked like they were naked? I could feel a nervous lump in my throat as the two of us held the gaze of one another. I was afraid to take my eyes off of it. I tried to steady myself. This was probably just the office freak. Maybe someone wearing a body-suit, pranking me as some kind of messed-up hazing ritual. I rubbed my eyes, sore from the staring contest, and began to walk steadily further up the stairs and away from the figure. I could feel my hand shaking, legs unsteady, throat dry. It didn't shift, except for to follow my location with a slow turn of its head as I moved from step to step.

It started moving. Fast. Rounding to the stairs, its sprinting pace activated my fight or flight reaction on a primal level, and I sure as shit chose flight. I stumbled as I started to run, slamming my shin on the hard steps and cursing before I found my feet and ascended as fast as I could. I heard its movements, it sounded like it had dropped to all fours, and its galloping steps were wet, sounding soaked in something oily. Just as it was gaining on me, I made it to the fourth floor, slamming into the wall beside the locked door. I fumbled with my key, glancing over my shoulder in fear that the thing would be upon me, and slammed the plastic card onto the scanner. As soon as it unlocked, I threw myself through and spun to look back. The door had locked again when it closed behind me, and through the glass window, I could see a vague, wet, pale head. One dark eye peeked up and through at me, holding my gaze as I panted, sweating and heaving for breath, before it sank out of view.

As I came down from the shock, I slowly tuned into the sounds of a call floor. Quiet ringing of phones, clacking of keys, distant indistinct voices using customer-service tones. I steadied my breathing as I looked around, taking in the sheen of laminated walls and the yellowy glow of fluorescent lights. I let the familiar office setting calm me a little, waiting for my heart rate to slow, holding one hand over my chest. 
“Relax… Relax… You need this job… There’s no way that was real…”
Even as I said the words aloud, I couldn’t convince myself. Whatever that was, it wasn’t normal. But what was I supposed to do? Approach the staff and let them know I was just chased up the stairs by some kind of creature? I’m sure that would end well… 

From my place in the entryway, I could see there were several rows of desks, setups with computers and phones, meeting rooms separated from the main floor and a small kitchen break-space. Barely any of the desks were occupied, but I did spot maybe a half dozen other folks, which brought me some level of comfort. With a degree of caution, I began walking over to the workspace, documents held tight under my arm. I approached the closest person who wasn't presently on the phone, a tall woman with greying black hair who looked like she might be pushing fifty. Her eyes were glued to the computer screen, her fingers a blur as they typed away. She had an overall intimidating aura, like someone you didn’t have any right to be talking to.

Clearing my throat, I tried to present myself. "Hey, uh, hello. I'm Isaac, Isaac Stern, here for the sales job…”

Her typing came to an abrupt end as she looked at me from the corner of her eye. "New meat, huh? Let me see that." She gestured to the files, swivelling around in her chair to take them from me. I handed them over, and she flipped to the end, eyeing my signature. "Uh-huh..."

Feeling some tension, I tried to turn on my 'new-guy' manners. "I'm looking forward to working with you. It's been a while since I've-"

"Catherine." She said abruptly, cutting me off and closing the file. "You can call me Catherine." She looked me up and down as I tried not to pull a face at being cut off by one of these suits again. She stood, walking past me to one of the meeting rooms. "Come on, then. Got a bit of fluff for you." Once inside, she turned on the projector, and moved to leave. "See me when it's done."

...

A few minutes later, the introductory video for KING Sales Group was done, tips and all. I was shell-shocked, speechless, and praying it was some kind of sick joke. Wetting my lips and shaking my head, I got to my feet and marched out of the room and back to Catherine, resting my hands on the cabinet beside her desk as I leaned in. 

"Excuse me, but what the fuck was that? Legally and spiritually binding!?" I practically whisper-shouted, discarding any professionalism at this point. 

She looked at me with a slow blink and frustrated scowl. "I was right then, you hadn't read the onboarding."

Scoffing, I looked around briefly. "The onboarding? I signed up for a sales job!"

"No, Isaac, you signed up for KING Sales Group, where you get rich or die trying. Understand?" She seemed exacerbated with my protests, but she was looking me dead in the eye, with complete seriousness in her expression. Before I could think of what to say next, she pointed to a desk a few spots away from hers. "Sit down, check the quickstart guide and start dialling. You'll understand soon."

I raised my hands to cover my face and dragged them down my cheeks, bringing them to clasp in front of my chin before I moved to walk to the desk.

"You should look this over for real on your lunch." She added, holding the documents out to me. I grabbed them haphazardly before taking my seat, staring at the black screen of the old monitor. With another quiet sigh, still trying to get to grips with the situation, I took hold of the mouse and shook it to wake the screen. A laminated paper blue-tacked to the separator beside the screen outlined the 'quickstart' process.

It felt like a surreal fever dream. I just had to ride the wave at this point or else I'd end up drowning in the crazy. I logged in to a default screensaver, and double-clicked the program for scripting. Its icon was a solid black box with the yellow letter S sat square in the middle. Immediately, the whole screen went black, before a phone number appeared on screen. I looked almost reluctantly at the handset, an old fashioned black device that people use at payphones. Grabbing it, I keyed in the number SCRIPTR had provided, and let it ring. Immediately, the text on screen changed, shifting strangely into a line of text rather than just disappearing or being replaced. After a few rings, I heard someone pick up.

"Hello?" It sounded like a middle-aged man, who had a slightly aggravated tone.

Following the script, I went to work. "Hey there David, how are you doing today?"

"What? How do you know my name? Who is this?" His annoyance and confusion was clear, and as much as I cringed at what I was doing, I kept to the script.

"That's great David, I'm calling on behalf of Omaro Knives, and we have some great product in stock that has your name on it!"

"Knives? No, hold on, how did you get my number?" Annoyance was turning to anger quickly, and I was expecting a hearty helping of verbal abuse any second. 

"Fantastic, how many premium sets can we put you down for?"

I could hear him growl, and then he raised his voice for real. "No, no, you listen here! I don't want any knives, and I don't want any more of these calls, I swear, I'll report you!"

"You don't want to miss out on this, sir. You don't want to miss out on this, sir. You don't want to miss. You don't want to miss. You miss her. You miss her, don't you?" 

The script morphed to extend as I read it aloud, the text shaking a little in that black void background, becoming repetitive and bizarre, and while I thought for sure it had to be broken, I then heard the man break down into sobbing. SCRIPTR displayed nothing, and so I said nothing. I remembered tip number three.

The man caught his breath, sniffling. "I'll take twelve." 

SCRIPTR reactivated, and though I was baffled, I continued. "Brilliant, you've made a great decision today! Do you have your card details handy, David?"

I proceeded to take a large payment from the man, covering some final scripting before finishing the call with a signoff. 

"Thanks David, they'll be at your door in three to five business days! Have a royal day, and don't forget!"

The call ended there. Don’t forget what? I sat back in my chair, shook my head and reflected on just how insane that had been. SCRIPTR had already thrown up a new number on the screen, but I needed a second to think. That guy had clearly not been interested in buying some expensive knives, and the script had made me treat him like an idiot. Something about what SCRIPTR made me say, had some kind of effect. Just as I was working through this in my head, I heard a light clatter. Sitting up, I looked over my screen. What stood just a few feet away from me was... something that resembled a man. He was so tall his head bent crooked against the ceiling, having only a few strands of loose wiry black hair, his jaw hanging long and loose from his skull. His body was distended, covered by a baggy white shirt that hung from his skeletal frame, with dress trousers covering his lower half.

I spent a brief moment absorbing the sight, before I screamed out loud, wailing and falling back from my chair, scrambling to my feet and away from the monster. I backed up against the desk behind me, preparing to scramble over it as the thing watched me closely, milky eyes with beady black dots gazing into my soul- and then he spoke. 

"Awwwwh... I was so close. Oh well. Maybe next time." His tone was unnaturally deep, slow-paced and eerily playful. Turning away from me with unnatural, janky motions, he stepped over the desks and headed out of my view. The way his legs rose and fell were as if he were being pulled by unseen strings, puppeted along... At this point, I noted that nobody had been bothered by this occurrence, not the presence of the mutant or my screaming. I walked over to my 'manager', almost breathless. Everything I'd known my whole life was falling to pieces here. This place was wrong, cursed.

"Catherine... What the fuck was that!?" 

"That was Lank. He is why tip number one exists." She replied with a fairly casual tone. 

"Right, right, of course." I said, my words dripping sarcasm. "And what would Lank done if he had reached me without being seen?"

She turned to look at me, adjusting her glasses. "Torn your spine out, probably. One of the quicker ways to go."

I laughed, a dry, humourless laugh. "Oh great! That's great to hear! I quit." 

I moved to walk out, but she replied fast and firm. "No, you don't."

Stopping in my tracks, I reluctantly muttered my reply. "Why not?"

"Because you make fifty percent commission. Because that call you made just paid your rent in less than five minutes of work, and if you keep making calls, you'll move out of your shitty apartment and be able to lead a life worth living." Her glare held me in place as she said this, locking my limbs as my hands trembled. 

Clenching my fists, I thought about what she said. "But... If something here gets me, I won't be leading one at all."

She shrugged. "That's the choice we all have to make here, Isaac. But if you can survive here even for just a month, you can retire and live a cushy upper-middle-class life until the day you die, doing whatever the hell you want. No more shitty car, no more shitty job, no more shitty boss. Understand? Get rich, or die trying."

I thought about everything that had happened. Everything I'd been through to get here in my life. My whole existence had been a boring, lonely nothing. All of my failures weighed down on my back, forever threatening to bury me in the lowest tax bracket, in the debts I took on to make it even this far. A loser, that's what I was. But here... Among terrifying monsters and under cheap, fluorescent lights, I could make something for myself. Maybe I was crazy. Maybe the building was messing with my head.

Silently, I walked back to my desk. I picked up my fallen chair, sat down, and stared at the number on the screen. ‘Get rich, or die trying’. 

I made more on that day than I had in the last year. I’ve got more to share about my time at KING Sales Group, but it’ll have to wait for another time. 

Take care of yourselves,

Isaac
