 want to preface before that i’ve always somewhat believed in these type of creatures (aliens, skin walkers, wendigos, spirits, etc) but i’ve always been the kind of person who doesn’t 100% believe or not in something, i’ve just always believed that it’s possible so why not? but of course just like anyone else who hasn’t experienced something, i had my doubts. 


last night i was with my partner and our friend and we were at a place called “Rafes Chasms” in Gloucester, Massachusetts. We got there at about 10pm and we were just going to have a fire on the rocks by the water. you had to walk through some wooded area to get to the rocks and as we pulled up to the area i had a bad feeling for some reason (and usually trust my intuition but i told myself i was just psyching myself out) once we got to the spot i immediately felt a weird feeling but again i told myself i was just making things up, even so i didn’t turn my back to the open space and i was turned facing towards the woods/ rock area. as the people i were with watched the fire i stared out into the darkness feeling like something was watching us. i decided to go to a rock further away from the fire so my eyes could adjust to the darkness. and low and behold i see a translucent white figure about 50 feet away from us on top of the rocks on the other side of the area pretty high up. it was moving back and fourth and it looked about 5-6 feet tall.  it starts to scale down the rocks and when i day scale i mean FAST like faster then humanly possible and as it’s doing that it gets smaller and turns into the shape of an animal like a coyote or wolf (shapeshifters usually take form as one of these.

i say  “is that an animal?” and my partner looks over and immediately gets super sketched out just as i was. the other person we were with wasn’t bothered by it for some reason. He said he saw it but in the moment was trying to convince us it was a person. (he was drunk) 
as i see it coming towards us i get absolutely horrified that it’s going to kill us. i tried to go up higher on the rocks to get away from it. i literally thought that was it. i thought i was going to die. i had the most horrifying feeling and it was genuinely the scariest most terrifying thing i have ever felt or seen. 

i pulled out my phone and shine my flashlight on it to make sure i’m not tripping and i think that it deterred whatever it was away from us because it ended up running into the woods and disappearing
my partner and i were completely horrified and my legs were violently shaking. i said that we need to leave immediately. the friend that we were with wanted to stay to finish his drink but we wanted to go. 

he told us that he would prove that it was a human by trying to run down the rocks as fast as he could to prove that a human could be going that fast. but when he did we could hear him running around. and that’s the scary part about what we saw…

it was completely silent as it went down the rocks and back up them. 


we weren’t able to process what had happened until we had gotten home after we dropped our friend off. When we did we decided to do some research about ski walkers and the area that we were. 

here’s what we found.
