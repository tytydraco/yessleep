Up until I turned seven, I’ve shared a room with my little sister. After that, my brother moved out of the house and, in consequence, I was allowed to switch from the shared bunk bed to a full bedroom, all for myself.  
On first thought, it seemed amazing. The room wasn’t very big – about twice the size of my bed – but I was able to decorate it the way I wanted, without the need to consider my baby sister’s taste. It was great to have a retreat from my big family. As a quiet, introverted child, I valued the tranquility the room provided. It was located at the end of a corridor, so there were no more loud footsteps and conversations of my siblings and parents to be heard.

For you to be able to follow my story, I’ll have to describe the room in a bit more detail. As you entered, you stood opposite to my bed. The room opened to the left. There was a little desk for me to do my schoolwork on next to the door. Then there was also a small cabinet with some toys and knickknacks. The desk and the cabinet were located opposite to my bed as well as the door. Those few pieces of furniture pretty much filled the small space. There was just one corner left. It had to be left empty, as there was a ladder leading to the attic.  
The house had been built more than sixty years ago. It has since been expanded to house all the children and grandchildren my grandparents apparently hadn’t expected. The layout was strange; there were many small rooms, and some peculiarities simply did not make much sense. One of the latter was the placement of the opening to the attic. I have always wondered why it wasn’t located in the hallway, easily accessible to everyone, but instead in one of the children’s bedrooms. It was a bit odd.  
The ladder in the corner of my room was attached to the wall, it couldn’t be removed easily. This annoyed me, as no one was actively using the space above. It was filled with the usual things you’d expect in an attic – old furniture, picture frames, books, toys. Now that I had easy access to it, I sometimes climbed up and inspected things from the past, imagining myself as a detective or time traveler.  
There was one thing I immediately disliked about the attic. I was fine with its dust and spiderwebs, but what I didn’t like was the fact that I couldn’t fully close it oI from my room. You see, there was no actual hatch with a handle and a lock as you might imagine right now. Instead, you closed the space by pulling a flat piece of wood over the opening. This wasn’t an easy task for a child, but I soon learned how to manage the wooden panel by myself. I just had to hold onto the top step of the ladder with one hand and pull the board over the gaping entrance to the attic with the other.

I had only slept in my room for a few nights when I first noticed it. As I lay in bed, I saw that the wooden panel was not fully covering the opening. It seemed to have slid slightly to one side, exposing a small gap leading into the room above. I assumed that I mustn’t have closed it properly that day. The gap left open had a triangular shape only a few centimeters big. After a moment of thought, I decided to get out of my warm nest of blankets in order to adjust the panel. I didn’t want any spiders to get into my room. It was easy. I climbed up, pushed the board slightly to the side, and then went straight back to bed. I fell asleep without problems.

I wouldn’t tell you of this minor inconvenience if it hadn’t been the first of many, many similar events that eventually led me to slightly question my sanity over the years.

It happened again and again. Whenever I went to sleep, I checked if the attic was closed oI properly. Two out of three times it wasn’t. Yes, sometimes I had been playing up there, or a family member had searched for something over the course of the day. Still, it made no sense to me that it was left open this often. Whenever I climbed down the ladder, I made extra sure to check if the board was covering the opening. Why did I only notice it had been moved as I was already lying in bed? It was just weird. Explainable in theory, but not very logical. After a few weeks, I started to feel more and more uneasy as I had to sleep next to this opening. I sometimes felt like I was being watched, but I couldn’t do anything about it.

As I was confronted with this strange problem almost every day, it really started to get to me. I slept less, and the little sleep I got was full of bad dreams. My parents didn’t take me seriously. It also was no help that my baby sister didn’t like to play in my room, as she “didn’t like the scary attic”.

In my nightmares, I often saw a face up there. Its skin was grayish, the head bald. It had enormous eyes, opened wide, staring. The mouth opened to form a look of surprise – or better: curiosity. Sometimes I caught glimpses of other body parts: Its neck and hands were thin, long and of a gray color as well.

I never saw it when I was awake. But I couldn’t shake the feeling of its presence.  
While I always felt a little uneasy when I was alone in my room – especially at night – nothing ever happened to me. The thing never revealed itself. With months and then years passing by, it also sometimes happened that I double-checked the wooden board in the evening, only to find it slightly misplaced in the morning.  
As I slept, turned away from the attic’s opening, I sometimes felt like I heard the sound of the board scratching over the wooden floor of the attic. At times this also happened as I was awake – sitting at my desk and concentrating on my schoolwork, for example. Even if I turned around immediately, I never saw anyone.

I’ve lived and slept in that room for about ten years. Always a little anxious, sometimes close to ignoring the reappearing of the opening, sometimes actually afraid of these strange events.

Since I moved out, about another ten years have passed. I’ve lived in a nice flat – only one floor and no stairs. I’m thankful for that. Of course, I couldn’t forget the attic, but it occupied my mind less and less. The dreams of the being up there stopped immediately after I had moved out.

There is a reason for me to type out this story at this point in my life. I saw it again. It brought back all the memories. Another dream.  
In the dream, I was lying in my childhood bed. I immediately recognized everything around me. I knew what would happen. The wooden panel slid to the side, revealing the attic behind it. There it was. I could not only make out the eyes and parts of the face, but I saw the thing’s full upper body. Thin, gray, long limbs, no wrinkles or freckles of any kind. It looked slightly surprised with its eyes wide open. Not exactly evil. But wrong. It gave me shivers. Then it spoke.

“I’ve always been there, you know?”  
And that was it. I woke up – sweaty of course. I was really perplexed by this childhood memory coming up so vividly without any warning.  
Later that day, I called my mom. She told me that my dad and she were in the midst of renovating the house. The roof had to be renewed, and, in this context, they decided to convert the attic into an extra living space. Most of it had just been torn down and rebuilt.
