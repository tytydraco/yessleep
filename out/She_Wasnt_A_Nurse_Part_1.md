Removing my limb hand from my keyboard, I mosey it down into my front pocket. Falling into place around my phone like the hands of virtuosic violinist taking command of their bow. I pick up the call before the phone even leaves my pocket. Looking down at my thigh, the phone creeps into view from behind the fabric of my jeans. The caller id is not as expected. “Blood Bank”. I take the phone to my cheek.

 

“Hello?” I spoke like I questioned if someone was at the other end.

 

“Yes, hello It’s Michelle from the blood bank, are you aware of how much of a difference 20 minutes of your time can do for others?” As phone salesmen come they all seem aggressively upbeat. But she was something different. She didn’t really sound like a woman. She sounded feminin; but too aggressive in her sales pitch. Like someone had coerced her into having the cadence of a top sales**man**. It was slightly off-putting, in that same way as salesmen admittedly always are.

 

“No. Sorry Michelle but I am actually not that interested in blood donations.” After I said it, I realised that she had set a trap for me. Her initial question was designed for me to stay on the line. Even my no was an invitation to educate me further on the possibilities of helping others. And she was at it immediately.

 

“That is no fault of yours mister. Many people have no idea.” She sounded playful.

“When donating blood you are actually donating three separate life saving materials. That means that only one donation could save three lives. That’s only 20 minutes of your time! Doesn’t it sound exiting to make such a big difference to so many people?”

 

It was an malicious question to end on. What could I say to that? I wouldn’t capitulate to her that easily. I was figuring out how to divert without sounding selfish. Noticing my hesitation she started again.

 

“If you are willing to become one of our lifesavers you are in luck! Because we are actually extending a special service to people in your neighbourhood. That means that if you want us too, we can come to you! Dosen’t that make it convient? Do you know what blood type you have sir?”

 

Reacquiring my footing I try again.

“No. I’m actually not really interested.”

 

Ignoring me again she changed path.

“Well that’s fine most people aren’t that keen on knowing their blood type. But figuring out what blood type you have could potentially save your life. It can be vital in future emergency situations. Are you interested in the home donation service?”

 

“how would that help me?” I guess this was the idea. Keep me on the line until they finally posed me a piece of information I was interested in.

 

“well sir, If you are ever in the hospital the doctors would be able to match your social security number to your blood type. Making sure you can receive blood immediately without waiting for doctors to do testing in such a time sensitive situation. So this donation is also a chance to help yourself.”

 

I am not much for a sales pitch. But this one worked. I could tell others I had done a good deed. And I was actually creating a safety net for myself. Besides, chicks dig men that donate, and this is by far the least time expending option.

“Is that information automatically put into the system?”

 

“Yes our staff will fill it in for you”

 

“You said you could come to me?”

 

“Yes. We have nurses that will travel from donor to donor during normal business hours.”

 

They are bringing their nurse to me. I guess it is more convient. Well any method they use to save more taxpaying lives, I guess.

 

“What time?”

 

“Anywhere within normal working hours, we will schedule a route that matches our donors preferences.”

 

“I’ll be home around one o´clock on Thursday” Even though I work from home I wanted to give a time. It just felt like a way of taking back control over the conversation. I deserved to make them come too me when I wanted. And as much as I regret to admit it, saying one o’clock meant I was sure to be awake by then. Being single with a programming job made it a little to easy to sleep in late. This often forces me to code at night. I tell my self I’m a night writer, but really I think by now procrastinating has become so prevalent in my life that I am forced to schedule around it.

 

“That will fit perfectly, one o’clock Thursday. What’s the address?”

 

\[redacted\]

 

“Perfect. I wont take up any more of your time mister..”

 

“Skinner”

 

“Have a great day mister Skinner”

 

“You too miss” as I took the phone away from my ear I was reminded of my fear of needles. I never had an easy time with foreign objects being inserted into me. I remember telling my highschool girlfriend that it was a good thing I wasn’t into men. I think statements like that is why she left; although she did manage to laugh them off in the beginning. I still think those same idiotic thoughts. I feel a kind of connection to my past as I laugh about it; just as she used to. I hang up the phone as the first snikker leaves my lips. Hope Michelle didn’t hear that. God I am such an awkward man.

\----------------------------------

 

As the day creeps closer, I start feeling my skin clinging itself tighter to my tissues. Tucking away my veins behind their only layer of protection. Looking at the soft skin in my elbow joint has become habitual. Eyeing down the treasonous vein puffing out my skin right at the most opportune point of attack. Looking at it forces conjurations of being penetrated. The sensation of the needle rubbing against me from within my life pipes. And then to have it remove my essence like I didn’t need my blood anyway. That couldn’t be safe. There is a reason why I have the amount of blood I have. Surely there is. And having it removed is unnatural, and almost surely detrimental to my health. Such invasive medicine should be outlawed. Wishing the imaginative needle gone, I start thinking about the needle tickling me from within my vein as the surgical instrument was retired from it’s violation of my cellular integrity. In turn, I shudder.

 

There is little escape now though. It’s almost one a clock. The nurse would be here any minute. Looking around my home I realised that it was completely unpresentable. I had to clear out my livingroom at least. I started by clearing away old plates. Too many tv dinners. Some of the plates had begun sticking to each other. I put them in the kitchen and take the bin with me back to the livingroom. Old bags of snacks and drinks lay scattered about as well. While picking them up I was interrupted by the doorbell ringing. I kick the last pieces I could see under the sofa and put the trashcan on the other side of the kitchen door. Closing it. The doorbell rang again as I moved towards it. Having almost forgotten all about my fear of needles for a short minute of clean panic.

 

Sharp inhale.

 

Long exhale.

 

Simultaneously I depress my shoulders and door handle.

 

Light floods in through the door, like an army of photons breaking down a castle door. Blinking I see a silhuet come into focus.

 

“Hello mister Skinner” The voice is almost cheerful. And by the end of the sentence my vision has acclimated to the light and I can finally see my visitor clearly. If I had to describe her appearance I would say no more than 25, blonde, narrow nose, her forehead only reaching my shoulders, full lips, playfull smile like a cats, holding a small white cuboid box with a big cartoonish drop of blood on it, her knees pointing inwards. If I had to use only one word it would be: nurse. In other words. She looked the part.

 

“Ohh hey, miss.. and, your name?” She looked at me for a second, her smile dropping from her face. The cheerful voice remained.

 

“Walker. Audrey Walker. Can I come in?” Her smile returned with a vengeance.

 

“Yes of cause.” I stepped aside letting her into me domicile. As she took the first step over the barrier of my doorstep I felt a cold run up my back. In that moment all I could think was. God she is hot. Don’t fuck this up. It had been so long since I had been within arms reach of a woman, it gave me shivers.

 

“Do you have a comfortable place for us to sit?” The question caught my female starved mind as very sugestive. And I stumbled getting my footing back to the professional.

 

“I can, I’ll sit wherever you would want me to sit; at.” Pathetic.

 

She laughed.

 

“Well your *couch* seems suuper comfy” There was a question embedded in the suggestion. A slight change in inclination at the the word “couch” that made it clear that I was supposed to direct her to the area. I did.

 

She almost skipped over to it. Laying her white box on the newly unburdened coffee table. She turned nimbly on the balls of her feet and bent at only her knees and hips as she sat herself gently onto my couch. I would remember where she had been seated.

 

“Are you joining me?” Once again I felt like she was using sexual undertones for some sort of gain. But damn it if I wasn’t willing to entertain her.

 

“Yes, yes I am. Where do you want me?” I tried to act like I had meant it as flirtatious, while in fact it was just a coincidence of my nervous brain falling into her submission.

 

“Well for *now* mr. skinner. I want you right here.” She padded the sofa next to her. I remembered the trash underneath it. I caught myself wishing that she wouldn’t see it.

 

I walked slowly,  unsteadily. Putting one foot in front of the other felt like a puzzle to me. How do people handle these emotions? Heart throbbing I bent over gripping the armrest. She opened up the white box and suddenly all of the sexual tension I had been engrossed in vanished. The light reflecting off the deflated plastic bag evaporated it like a puddle in summer. Now all I could think about was that empty canister, which would hold within it the liquid that now kept me alive. Some part of me given away to the dying masses.

 

“You afraid of needles?” She reached out for the bag while I quivered in fright.

 

“Not really.” I lied. She lifted the bag and the attached tubes out of their container.

 

“Don’t worry I’ll be gentle with you.” She smiled at me. Once again I thought of her tone as suggestive. But it didn’t matter. Nor did it matter how gentle she was actually able to be with me, the blood would be drained from me regardless.

 

Laying the bag on my table, she then took a small vial out from her pocket.

 

“Can I get you to verify your information for me?” She said while looking intently at the small vial.

 

“Yes of cause, it’s \[redacted\]”

 

“Yes and you grew up in?”

 

“\[redacted\]”

 

“Perfect, that’s the worst part over” Her smile was getting annoying. Or I was getting angry. I needed her to know how I felt, without seeming less masculine. An impossible task.

 

“How much blood are you taking?” An authoritative question. I think I solved that nicely.

 

“It’s only 0.85 liters, plus the 20 millilitres for the blood test.” I didn’t know how much that was of my total, or if it was standard to take that much… or that little?

 

“Oh that’s; just, ffine.” Damn I was back on the defensive. She was taking the alcohol swap and the small needle with the three-necked nuzzle. I could already feel my nervous sweat erupting from my skin like molten lava. The evaporation of the droplets quickly turning my perfectly adequate body temperature into shivering cold.

 

Taking a small adjustable ribbon she slid it up my arm. Her nails stroking my skin every inch along it’s journey to my bicep. Retracting her hands she ripped the packaging of the alcohol swap. Revealing the small white fabric solely responsible for maintaining my genomic integrity against the microbial assailants lurking on my skin.

 

She leaned in and grabbed my forearm. Her hands where soft. I closed my eyes as soon as our skin contacted. It was involuntary. A cold wetness fell on my skin as I once again opened my eyes. She was fully focussed on that one treasonous vein of mine. Packing away the alcohol swap she quickly brought the needle to the vein. I didn’t know if it would be best to look or not.

 

“You are going to feel a little sting.” Her gaze fixed to my vein, not a moment of compassion for my situation.

 

“Can you count down?” She looked at me with surprise.

 

“Sure.” Smile returned. Her gaze returned to the vein. I had to figure out if I was going to look or not.

 

“3” If I looked I wouldn’t be surprised by the sensations that would follow.

 

“2” If I looked I would watch as my body became scared, and blood became scarcer.

 

“1” If I didn’t look I could focus on something else. I might not feel as much of it.

 

I blinked. And kept my eyes closed.

 

I felt an exponentially rising pressure on my skin. Then my cartilage gave in, it collapsed with a snap as the needle broke through my armor. When it settled within me, the vein bounced back up like a spring enclosing the foreign object. As it scraped upon the needle I felt me toes cringe. I let out a small puff of air, and opened my eyes.

 

She put the tube of the bag into the nuzzle and turned a hinge. The blood poured into it.

 

“Keep on working this hand gently.” She said and tapped my palm.

 

I was losing consciousness. Watching the liquid streaming out. She couldn’t take this away from me. I spent all my energy remaining upright. Controlling my breathing. Not because it helps against panic or whatever. But because I didn’t want to be visibly flustered.

When I awoke it was to gentle laughter and a stroke on my arm.

 

“Haaey mister.” I liked this smile even less. It was belittling. Degrading. How dared she look at me like that.

 

“I think you dosed of there for a minute. Hihi.” Fuck her. What had she been doing in the meantime. Had she been going through my stuff?

 

“Good news is that we are done! So I hope I´ll get to see you again. It’s really very kindhearted of you to donate and save lives.” She grasped my forearm with her hand. A small ball of cotton was secured to my joint with tape.

 

Out of my peripheral red caught my eye. I was looking at the bag full of what was collected from me. I was trying to estimate the amount of it. Thinking about how it would look, if instead it where to be spread out over my floor. Silently comparing that with the amount of blood I had seen in horror movies. And if the character survived or not.

 

She left. I felt at home again. The sun was still shining. I threw out the trash under the couch. And updated my dating profile.
