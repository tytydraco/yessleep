Four years ago, shortly before the Samhain I recounted in [my last post,](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/Hatm2CI4g6) an autumn storm swept through our town. It rained for days, and the winds were cold and harsh. No one could go outside. I stayed in my house, watching the chaos from the safe confines of my home. It was all fine and well, until the storm came to me.  
  
It threw open the gates to the garden wall, plowed through my vegetable patch and ripped out the herbs I’d planted out by the roots. Nothing I couldn’t mend later on. But then it came for my favorite thing. I was standing in the kitchen, slicing up some apples and staring out the window. I dropped the paring knife when I realized a miniature whirlwind had formed right outside, drawing ever closer to the glass pane. When the sound of cracking wood reached my ears, I realized it had demolished the old playhouse my father built for me when I was small. And all at once, my heart shattered in my chest.   
  
That teensy little building had been standing there my whole life. Dad had started planning it the same week my mother announced her pregnancy, and by the time I was born, it had long since been erected. When I came into this world, a little white castle was waiting for me to move in. At five years old, I asked my father to refurbish it with me, and together, we rebuilt it into a pirate fortress. When I turned ten, I got really into superheroes. So we renovated the playhouse again and turned it into my very own bat cave. It went on and on like that. I cherished it more than ever after my father's death.  
  
Yet within a matter of seconds, that piece of the late Lawrence Volkov was gone. Destroyed, like it never meant a thing.   
  
Hanging in a fixture on the living room wall was my altar sword. I dashed forth to grab it, the short, curved blade gleaming in the warm lamplight. I burst through the front door and hurled the blade into the eye of the mini-tornado. I knew I had hit my mark when a cry of pain rang out from within the storm. Moments later, the wind died down. The leaves that had been whirling around my yard sank to the ground and the settling dust revealed a tall figure, bent over and clutching their stomach in agony.  
  
“What have you done?” I bellowed, striding towards them. The sword had burrowed itself in their lower abdomen, and soupy black blood ran from the wound in a steady stream.  
  
“Pull it out!” the storm-demon howled, features twisted and voice tight. “Get it out of me! Please!”  
  
“Shut your mouth!” I spat at their feet, trying to distract them from the tears threatening to spill from my eyes. “How dare you break my things and demand I spare you! Was wreaking havoc on my town not enough? Was it absolutely necessary for you to waltz on over here and demolish my home, too?”  
  
“It hurts… Please, it hurts so bad…”  
  
“Shut your mouth or I’ll twist it round! See how you like that,” I shrieked. I didn’t care if the whole neighborhood heard me. It was sad enough that I appeared to be the only one who had the guts to confront this rampant faerie creature, but I was more than capable of dealing with it on my own. “Your kind thinks you can do whatever you like! This world isn’t yours to play with!”  
  
“Who are you?” the being asked.  
  
“I’m the one whose dearest possession you just destroyed! And for what?” I stepped closer to them, bringing my face up to theirs. “Was it *fun* for you? Did you *enjoy* yourself?”  
  
“Who are you?” they asked again, eyes wide. "You’re not like the rest. You don’t even talk like the rest."  
  
“The only difference is that I’m not afraid to defend myself. Though that’s not what you’re used to, is it? You like your humans awestruck and frightened, I’ll bet.”  
  
“Take out the sword, I’m begging you.” The creature’s face had taken on a sickly pallor. “It hurts so much I think I’ll spew.”  
  
I grabbed the handle. “Fine. But you are in my debt, you hear me?”   
  
No response. I pressed the blade a little deeper into the being’s body, a mere inch. They let out an ear-piercing wail. “Heed me, beast,” I growled. “You are in my debt. You will make this right. Swear it, or I promise I will leave this to stick inside you ‘til judgment day.”  
  
“I swear it,” they whined, writhing like a stricken animal.  
  
“You will do as I ask?”  
  
“I will do as you ask!”  
  
“Your name, creature. Tell me.”  
  
“I’m from where the stones are piled,” they gasped. “Of the rocky place.”  
  
I narrowed my eyes. “Calloway?”  
  
“Yes!”  
  
I smiled. “I’ve got you now.” With that, I pulled back the blade. I wiped the gooey dark blood off on my pants. The second the altar sword had been removed from the creature’s stomach, the wound began to heal, flesh and skin growing back together in an unsettling display.   
  
“First time getting skewered with a ritual sword, I assume?”  
  
“It burnt sharper than iron,” Calloway replied, still looking a tad woozy. “By the Gods, what metal is this?”  
  
“I don’t know, actually. But I did use it for all my prayers and ceremonies thus far.” I considered the weapon in my hand with satisfaction. “I’m pleased at its abilities.”  
  
“What would you have of me now that I’m yours?” the spirit asked.  
  
So I shared my plan with them. The only way they could right their transgression was to gift me a new memory of my father. I made them promise to help me call upon Lawrence Volkov. They have been staying with me at my house ever since, accompanying me on whatever my daily routine entails. They will not be able to leave until their task is done, or until I retract my request—which we’ve established I won’t be doing.  
  
Calloway realized soon enough that opposing me is, in fact, a terrible idea. They’ve never tried it since that first Samhain we celebrated together. A lesson learned, I hope. This brings us to the second time we attempted to summon my father’s spirit.   
  
Calloway and I had spent a whole year together at that point—something neither of us were thrilled about. Worse yet, the creature was starting to obtain a rather accurate sense of my personality. When we fought, they knew precisely what to say to me, what words would hurt the most. And we fought often.   
  
Calloway was destructive by nature. Back when they’d still had their freedom, they liked nothing more than to peel the roofs off of houses with their storms, to rouse the sea so that boats might be crushed under the waves or to raise a fog so thick that motorists would blindly collide in the wafting white walls. Immortal as they were, Calloway had all the time in the world and not a single care. In captivity, they grew bored and frustrated. The only pastimes available were wholesome mortal activities, which they considered dull and tiring. So they poured the entirety of their attention into me, along with a good amount of hostility. I entertained them by reacting in kind.   
  
We’d scream each other down for hours, only stopping when our throats had gone dry. The beast enjoyed laying into me, and in a twisted way, I did too. It was good to have someone to blame, a target for my ire. What followed were moments of exhausted, unfavorable peace. We’d sit beside each other in that empty house without exchanging a single word. There was a begrudging respect between us then—the knowledge that we had worn each other out. I think it was these short time-frames our understanding was built upon. We were getting better at enduring each other's company.   
  
Come Samhain, we built another fire at the bottom of the hill. Like the year before, we sat side by side in front of it and waited for nightfall. Calloway was in a good mood, not having bothered me all day except for one comment about how they missed "the times when women like me were burned at the stake". It was almost cozy, basking in the comforting heat of the dancing flames. They kept the sting of the autumn air at bay and had warmth seeping into the fibers of my scarf and woolen cardigan. We were all alone out there, the woods in the distance, the hill looming overhead.   
  
“What a beautiful night,” Calloway remarked.  
  
“So it is,” I said in response, and we left it at that. A rare moment of unanimity.  
  
When the moon peeked out from behind the mound, my Tempest Guide rose to their feet. We’d agreed on keeping the ritual private this time, on not summoning any of their brethren. Instead, Calloway would let me use their powers to call forth my father, him and only him. We hoped a direct incantation would draw him forth from beyond the veil. More effective than merely offering him a circle to join like we did the year before. Calloway would act as a medium, a conduit through which to reach into the Otherworld. Strangely enough, it had been their idea. I’d been taken aback by the suggestion. It required mutual trust, and there was nothing trustful about our relationship whatsoever.   
  
At first I thought it was another ploy to trick me, but they insisted they were being honest even when I asked them three times and more. Even so, I remained highly skeptical of the prospect.  
  
I joined Calloway in standing by the firepit, gathering their hands in mine. They looked at me oddly, their lips tight and jaw set. “May I begin?” I asked.  
  
They nodded. “You may. Good luck.” With that, they tipped their head back to stare into the night sky, their gaze getting lost among the stars. Their eyes turned foggy, their mouth dropped open a tiny bit and their fingers grew limp. They were completely relaxed, their mind lost somewhere in the dark of night, their power unguarded and open for me to use.   
  
I began to probe at the edges of their consciousness, letting their energy seep from their fingertips into my palms and through my entire body. I can barely find the words to describe the feeling—it was like rays of cold, iridescent moonlight weaved their way into the deadest corners of my being, illuminating every nook and crack and cranny. I was filled with an unfathomable brightness and strength, along with an unfamiliar swell of pride. It took me a while to realize that what I was sensing was not coming from me, but from Calloway. I was experiencing their emotions. Their self-satisfaction made me raise my head in quiet dignity. Their ancient elemental wisdom had me dig my heels deeper into the ground. I’d suddenly become aware of a gently throbbing pulse… The earth’s soft, nurturing heartbeat.   
  
\*We come from the place where stones are piled. We are a child of the soil. We are the fog, the rain, the thunder. We are as one with the ghostly hoards of the Otherworld. Our name is Calloway.\*  
  
A strange feeling of assurance, of knowledge. Being one with my Tempest Guide made me feel… exalted. I knew it wouldn’t last, I couldn’t let it; but for just a moment, I allowed myself to enjoy it. Oh, to be a spirit of nature. Wild and free and so, so beautiful.  
  
I dispelled a sigh, shut my eyes and began to say my prayer.   
  
“I call upon my kin, gone but not forgotten.   
I call upon my father, Lawrence Volkov.  
I call upon him who loved and held me dear,   
who kept me safe and sound,   
who offered comfort in his arms and joy in the laughter we shared.  
  
I call forth my father, Lawrence Volkov,  
so that I may speak to him once more.”  
  
Reaching into my pocket with one hand while holding onto Calloway’s with the other, I produced a crumpled photograph from my back pocket. A picture of me as an infant, held safely in Dad’s massive hands. He’d carried this around in his purse for as long as he’d been alive. I’d treasured it, but hearing his voice one more time would make its loss a worthy one. Suppressing a whine, I tossed it into the flames.   
  
“Father, hear me. Heed me. Remember who you were, and all we used to be.”  
  
I grasped Calloway’s other hand again, once more melting into their mind, their essence fusing with me. Suspended in this state of supernatural receptiveness, I—*we*—held out for a response, for Lawrence Volkov to take possession of my Tempest Guide’s body, to speak through their lips.   
  
Moments turned into minutes as we waited. Nothing happened. The gates were open, yet nothing came through.  
  
I was about to rouse Calloway from their trance when suddenly, I felt a presence joining our small, intimate circle. It scratched on my mind’s walls, asking to be let in. Gently; politely, almost. My stomach lurched, and my heart fluttered like the wings of a dozen butterflies. I opened myself up to it, prompting Calloway to let it in. This was him. It had to be.   
  
The flow of energy from my companion ceased instantly, snuffing out the glistening white light that had enveloped the both of us just seconds prior. It sapped the faerie’s warmth right out of me, leaving me cold and somehow very… *lonely*. There was no time to contemplate, though, for Calloway’s misty gaze cleared and focused on me once more. The look in their eyes was not the same anymore. They were filled by the spirit of another, and for a brief, blessed moment, I was sure it was my father.   
  
Then the creature’s lips tilted into a smirk.   
  
“What a sad, sad thing…”  
  
It wasn’t Calloway’s velvet voice that bespoke me. It was a throaty, rumbling growl coming from deep within their chest. It reminded me of grinding metal, the splintering of wood or perhaps the ripping of fabric.   
  
The thing in Calloway’s body stepped forward and cracked its neck, rolling its shoulders to produce a sinewy, churning sound. Dread gripped me and I backed off, staggering slightly. “You are not welcome here,” I whispered.  
  
“How now… What was it? Ramona?” A low chuckle. “I didn’t see too much inside you. More than I did in your guardian, of course, but not a lot even so. What a drab life it is you lead.” It took another step towards me, crowding me against its chest, against Calloway. The heat of the fire lapped at my back, uncomfortable now that it was so close.   
  
The thing was trying to edge me into the pit.   
  
I leapt to the side, bringing a safe distance between myself and the deadly dance of the flames. “What are you?” I asked, failing to stifle the quiver in my voice. My mind was racing, but showing my fear would rob me of my last shred of authority. The entity seemed to realize this, seemed to \*relish\* in it…   
Unsteady on Calloway’s feet though it was, it continued to proceed towards me. Its sick smile marred a face far too beautiful for so lowly an expression.   
  
Shit. Calloway. Could they feel any of this? A foreign, clearly malicious presence invading the body they had entrusted me with. *I did this to them.* I needed to put them back in charge somehow. They’d emerge from their daze to give me the scolding of a lifetime, that was for sure. *They’d be right, though.* And I would gladly let them yell at me. They were a pain in the ass on the best of days, but they were far preferable to the creature currently trying to kill me.  
  
What was I to do?  
  
The thing reached out its arms, slowly, their gaze plain calculation. I dodged easily, and a part of me contemplated running… Only I couldn’t leave my Tempest Guide behind. I had to get the faerie back. As though the creature had read my thoughts, its smirk eased into an unsettling pout. “Your friend isn’t hurting, dear. There’s no need to worry, I swear it.”  
  
“They’re hardly a friend,” I pressed out, trying to keep a level tone. “And they’ll tear you a new one once you’ve exited their skin.”  
  
“Not when I enter yours first, I’ll bet.”  
  
I let out a dry laugh. “Especially then.”  
  
“We’ll put it to the test,” the thing said, making another clumsy attempt to lunge at me. I ducked away, but only by a hair’s breadth… It was getting better at moving, at controlling itself.   
  
“What the hell are you, anyways?” I asked.  
  
“There’s many like me. Shapeless ones. Skinless ones.” Another dangerously close reach in my direction. “Ones who were and now are again. Looking for new skin to inhabit. Who’d you hope I was? Your Daddy?”   
  
A possession. This thing’s takeover of Calloway’s body was nothing more than a possession. *Okay.* I took a deep, cleansing breath, fighting down the raging panic. *I could work with this.*  
  
“Goddess of the silver moon,” I began to pray, voice as determined as I could muster, “Hunter of the wilder woods—” I jumped as the thing extended another slender hand, ready to grasp me, ready to overtake me or hurl me into the fire. “—hear me. My mind is clear and my heart is true, aid me and bury this evil."  
  
As the last of these words left my lips, Calloway's body began to *shake*. A shudder ran through them, and I could see their face contort as the thing inhabiting it was beginning to lose control. They began to cough, doubling over and convulsing. From their open mouth, a black mass spilled out, landing on the ground at our feet with a splat. I stared at in a mix of astonishment and horror—a writhing puddle that seemed to swallow all light.   
  
Calloway, once more in possession of their own body, drew themself up to their full height. "Would you believe it?" they hissed, crouching to grab a burning stick from the fire, not even flinching at the heat. "A mere shadow daring to climb into *my* skin. Whoever heard of such impertinence?"  
  
With that, they stabbed the pool with the blazing branch. The flames seemed to drain it, lap it up. Once finished, Calloway tossed the makeshift spear back into the firepit. I stood shivering like a leaf, hugging my shoulders.  
  
"What happened?"   
  
Calloway's tone was curt, but not unkind. A shock, given the tirade I'd expected. "You know what happened," I said.  
  
"All I know is that there was a lowlife entity in my body. I came to when you spoke your prayer."  
  
"Fine. But there's nothing much to tell. I failed again, that's what happened."  
  
Silence. Calloway gave me that odd look again. There was something in that besides hatred. Something I couldn't put my finger on. I held their gaze, searching for its meaning.   
  
"Do you need a…" they began, only to falter and fumble for words. "I was merely wondering if perhaps you'd…" They fell silent once more, shaking their head.   
  
*Pity.*   
  
It was pity in that expression of theirs.   
  
"You think you're that much better than me, don't you?" I asked. \*They are. They literally are.\*   
  
"What's brought this on? Want to take your frustration out on me? That setback was not my fault and you know it. Or do you still have some fight left in you after that shadow?" They palmed their forehead. "Apologies but I can't… do this thing we always do. I'm not feeling up to it right now, to be honest."  
  
I sighed. All my energy seeped out into the cold dark night along with the air that left my lungs. "Let's just go home."
