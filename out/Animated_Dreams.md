I am never too sure how creative people make the things they make; or rather, why they make the things they make. It could be science: that our molecular construction and chemical compounds are pre-programmed to act, think, and feel. It could be metaphysical: a being of higher existence beyond any comprehension pulling strings, forcing us to be a certain way. Unfortunately, neither explanation is a definitive answer. Much less, one I like.

For the better part of a year I felt I had stagnated; I plateaued with my art, specifically my animations. It is an art form that has left me wanting more. So, in my hubris, I wanted the accomplishment of making a series of animations. A challenge of myself to be bold. This troublesome feat to take is what I need. I knew if I didn’t restrict myself to practice with a purpose, I wasn’t going to improve.

Through some of my favorite animators like Len Lye to Satoshi Kon, the drive was there. However, I would start with one idea, but it always ended inconclusive. What would seem like a wonderful story dissipates when I go through the details. I can imagine these beautiful compositions, framed with such a compelling atmosphere. I knew how I wanted my movie to look, but I didn’t know what I wanted it to say. In my best efforts, I failed to marry the story and the animation.

In my unfiltered focus, I took some time off to make these animations; I took about a month. A perfectly reasonable amount of time to formulate, reflect, and execute. Even with the temptation of my friends wanting to take me out to dinner, I declined. I told them I need to focus on my projects, and that I will get back to them at the end of the month. My dearest friend Arthur mentioned he can surprise me to celebrate.

I could start small, maybe with particular scenes or compositions. Little thumbnails began to form in my mind. With hardly any detail, I held those moments to remember for later; solely trying to capture the essence. From surrealism to romanticism, I’ve loved all genres of art and storytelling. But I knew I wanted the animations to be mine.

Wandering what I could do, or at the very least what I can do. The hours of the day could be filled with experiments. Each day would be an exploration of myself to excavate my purest beliefs. Art is an expression of the artist through the lens of an audience. How do I want to discover who I am as an artist and the audience?

I entered my studio and stared at the bundle of ideas on my desk. Scribbled babblings of words that meant nothing. Pictures of unsure perspectives and subjects. The forms devoid of context, free falling in absent space. These imperfect sketches waited to be created. Insufficient concepts held down by my own insecurity. But I knew I could do it.

I spent the day laying out any and all of my thoughts. My hopes and fears and anything negative and in between to be animated. An artist needs to accept there will always be elements of my own art that are out of my control. In that sense, it’s faith. When I need to create the details in plot and story, that, however, needs to be under my control. With that, it’s a science. I let myself be and exist in a way that time never allowed before. I wrote and drew and by the end of the night my hand was sore. The transcribed thoughts of a man trying to be better, spelled and pictured, sprawled about on my desk. I grabbed some blank notepads and writing utensils to place on my dresser. I stood up and headed to bed.

The future kept me awake. A prevailing worry crossed my mind, but I tried to not let it grow. I calmed my breathing. Time was there for me. I knew the itch wouldn’t completely secede, so I had to be comfortable with it. The weight of anticipation grew heavy, as did my eyelids, and I drifted to sleep.

I woke up from a dream that had halted my breath; I began gasping for air. A dream that engrossed my sleep. My head fogged and spinning, trying to recalibrate. I panicked for a few minutes, unsure of where or who I was. My eyes were unable to adjust to the dark. My blurred vision caused more confusion as I frantically glanced around. The room morphed into a kaleidoscope of unknown shapes and shadows. The room itself felt reversed or inverted. I steadied my eyes, hoping my brain could interpret what I saw. Just out of view, odd formations of shadows, blending with the walls and floor. Long, disjointed silhouettes moving each time I blinked. The potential reflection of eyes staring back. Questionable faces of undiscernible expressions coming closer and fading. A rush of anxiety jolting up my spine, pinching the nerves.

I focused on the large mirror in the corner of my room that caught moonlight from my window. The soft blue glow easing the tension. Stripes of light stretching across the floor. The dark became clearer as I gained clarity. My shifting eyes were finally able to focus.

Once the uneven hesitated breaths stopped, I needed to capture my dream. I sat up to write down the dream with the pen and paper I keep on a nightstand. I tried to keep the details as accurate and concise as possible. My eyes as the camera lens to capture the scene. Engravings of the events transpired tucked into the back of my memories. I knew the dream would be there, saved to playback, but I couldn’t let the essence escape.

I wrote till I fell back asleep, pen still in my hand. Unsure of how many hours had passed, I checked my clock: 4:54 am. My dreams often happen when I have been faced with such a deep sleep that hardly anything will wake me. The first night of my vacation must have settled my anxiety. I drifted back asleep.

The next morning I was revitalized. Excitement and confidence kept a smile on my face as I peered out of my window from bed. The warm air and the welcoming light reached all of the corners of my room. I looked down at my notes; half were scribbles of a slumberous language and the other half was thankfully legible. I walked down to the studio, gazing over my notes as I went. 

I sat in front of the computer, thinking over the dream. I could interpret the visual language, but do I know what I want to say? The frustration of organizing my thoughts clashed with my impatience. Taking a deep breath, I laid out my notes. Looking over the thumbnails, I could see snapshots of my dream. 

As I recall the dream, it felt way too fast. That, while being in the dream felt like a solid hour, the details as I describe it fall short to be about a minute. So, I did the best I could. I worked on that animation for two days, not dreaming in the meanwhile; my anxiety pushed out any possibility of that. It was from sleep to awake, and nothing in between.

On sundown the third day, I completed the animation. Beautifully done, but I worried. What if I don’t have a good enough dream? What if my dream is dull and uneventful? I figured maybe reading about other people’s dreams could be good. I looked at my bookshelf, remembering I had picked up a book not too long ago that was about this very subject: visuals of the unseen.

It was a catalog of sorts, journal entries, essays, and iconographies, all about dreams. The subjects were chosen after they had shared a similar event, though the traumatic event was unspecified. The trauma was heavily psychological in nature. Many of the patients repressed the most horrifying details, only when subject to this doctor’s treatment were they revealed. I started with the first story. And, I read the entire dream before bed. As I turned off the light, closed my eyes, images emerged as I fell asleep.

A sound wedged its way into my mind, disrupting the dream. I bolted up, looking around. Nearly out of focus, a shadow crept along the baseboards of my room. Confusion and panic froze my body. The silhouette moved with soft disjointed movements. A sharp angular outline made its body. Like a slug inching along, it stuck to the surface. What appeared to be arms reached in front of its direction, like it was climbing horizontal. One long stretched limb after the other, slowly flattening itself to the wall as it gained distance. My eyes fixated, blocking out any peripheral view. The night flooded my room, and yet, even surrounded by it, this thing was darker.

The sound that woke me was the sound of its body creaking the floorboards. A blackened mass dragging and scrapping the wood. I noticed the trail of entangled scratch marks from where it was. The marks circled my room, leading back to where the thing emerged: from under my bed. I snapped back to where the screeching now sounded louder. It had made its way to the other side of my bed.

I drove my head back on the pillow, eyes wide, staring at the ceiling. My stuttered breathing, the disquiet overwhelming. My eyes swiftly moved in all directions, but all I saw was a darkened ceiling. I kept blinking as my eyes sputtered in and out of focus. Hypnotized by the anxious dread, I felt my heart pulsating at an impossible rate. Breathless and stunned, the creaking made its way to the back of my head; I can now hear the scratching from underneath the bed.

The noise moved like a tide of anxiety, patient but menacing. I kept my head straight, thinking hard enough that maybe the sound would stop. Despite my hopeful thoughts, the sound inched closer.

I felt static pulsing through my skull. A blistering blanket of panic seeping deeper and deeper into the back of my head. My ears were ringing from the silence; anticipating the shock of the scratching to reach out from beneath my bed, I clutched the bedsheets. Small groans and crackling rose closer. 

The fabric of my pillow gently ruffled, like a worm passing through dirt. What blossomed from the soil was a warm and bitter sensation. The back of my head felt like it was drowning in tension; moving from the back, to reaching my ears, to filling the sides of my face. I felt sublime and strange. My body stiff and cold with a fever of stress, I lay as a capsule of elevated dread. The darkness grew darker and darker, as my eyes stopped to notice the contorted face above me.

Morning came quicker, sooner than last time. The sunlight still crisp on the floorboards, I surveyed my room; no scratches. Nothing out of place or of major notice. But what I saw and what I felt oddly captivated me. I rushed out of bed, headed downstairs to my studio. I went to work as soon as my computer started up. The two previous nights were filled with such outstanding dreams. I think I have found my inspiration; a central theme for my animations. I knew dreams can be fantastical, but the ambience made it perfect for animations. 

I worked on the animation for about 10 hours, stopping a few times to eat or use the restroom or stretch. From making the models to shading everything, it felt so fluid. All of the parts came together, syncing up as I worked. Concept to a finished product took the entire day, it’s rough. But I cannot help but be proud of the result. Exhausted, I headed to bed again. 

The same routine: awake, animate, sleep, repeat. My dedication possessed my body and soul; time was becoming a wasted commodity. I knew when it was morning or dusk, but the numbers on the clock meant nothing. There is no present; there is only then and ahead.

 From each of the stories that I read an animation would come of it. Seemingly deranged and chaotic moments in a person’s life put to text for other’s enjoyment. I began to not see them as people with problems, but as fuel for my fire. The enveloping urge to illustrate the dreams of a stranger’s mind revitalized me; I felt the flow of art from mind to reality. 

The imagery described were hooks digging into my imagination. They latched onto any passing thought I had, pulling and directing my consciousness to their attention. With each new story came a myriad of compelling snapshots. I did not know these people, but these hints into their subconscious allowed me to freely reanimate their dreams into my own creations. Day and night, day and night, all evaporating into lengths of time that I could not observe. All I wanted to do was animate.

These lapses of time, from waking to animating resulted in blackouts. I would be reading in bed, then as I regain self-awareness, I’d be animating. One instance, I thought I was making food, but in actuality, turning the pages of a book. My hand would click and drag a non-existent computer mouse while I lay in bed. Empty transitions from action to action felt discomforting, yet pleasing. As these moments were meaningless, it meant I could focus on the art. No distraction, no disruption, no time to worry.

As I rest in my bed tonight, I learned about lucid dreaming. This meant I could better involve myself in the dreams, like directing a movie. I could let the dreams play out, but, with a little more control over how to capture it. I became a roaming camera; the natural unfolding of the dream as a documentary through my eyes. I can practise for a few nights, adjusting as I need to. This seemed perfectly reasonable; since they are not my dreams I can’t control them, but I can nudge some details. It might not seem like a good idea but I know if I try hard enough I can begin to really bring to life these amazing stories. My art has improved, and this means I am developing something special. I don’t think I have ever seen any other type of artwork that I am making. It truly is amazing to be able to have the visions in my head and accurately show what it is like to have these types of dreams. I mean it might not have an audience now but I know it will work as intended. I think this will be the turning point of my artistic career. I can make more and more movies to really gain a following not that an audience is all I care about cause I mostly want my art to be the focus. What is art without expansion of yourself or your mind? These past days or weeks have been incredible. I feel like a brand new personlike a new soul. No amount of poetry could be fixing my mind the way these dreams have begun to do and I know what itll happen to better than the future i think i have formyself. anyof these drwsms will come to live Idontneed sleep i need to dream and animate to dream and to anmate to dreamanimate dand tiamte to dream an

I stood in the corner of my room, looking over my own body. I slept with tension and uneasiness, as my hands gripped the bedsheets. My closed eyelids twitched around with frustration. The room was isolated in black. As I took a step forward, from outside my bedroom door, something peered in.

I stared as something moved from the opposite corner of the room, gentle and articulate. A thin but tall sharp mass appeared. What I assumed to be a head, was incorrect. A body that morphed its form, with no discernable limbs or features. The thing fused with the floor. It didn’t end; it was a part of everything it touched.

Three needled points of light were centered on its assumed face. The tiny beads of light glimmered in the moonlight. The black mass moved forward towards my bed. A convulsing tendril reached outward, hovering over my face. The end of the tendril came to a point, almost touching my forehead. I shouted at the mass over and over, with no voice exiting my mouth. I looked down to see my notepads on my dresser. I tossed them at the mass, the pages fluttering. The notepads landed onto the floor with a thud. I threw my pencils, markers, and pens; all bouncing off the mass. The mass then targeted the lights at me. 

In a consuming bout of rage, I rushed at it. I awoke with a calamity as I crashed into my mirror. My arms and torso collided with the glass and wood. Daylight brightened the room to remove the illusion. Adrenaline refused to let the reality in; a confusion of my own betrayal. My battered limbs scurry around as I stumble to my feet. A few cuts and scraps marked along my arms. My wide eyes uncomfortable with what they saw: a room in disarray. I turned around to notice the notepads on the floor, crumbled and torn. My pencils snapped in pieces, pens with ink spilling from the tip, and markers separated from their lids; all unevenly scattered on my floor.

My labored breath amazed at the mess. I closed my eyes tight, reassuring myself that it was a dream. But a dream that felt way too real; an actuality that I don’t want to repeat. 

I plastered paper and fabric and furniture along every window. No time to waste sleeping or worrying about time. Each night was a cascade of surreal and irregular realities, but now, I didn't need sleep. These visions can come to me naturally. I kept myself awake, animating as much as I could. Giant heads emerging from the abyss to feed. A duality of your own likeness being your own demise. A sacred totem that promised expansion. I began to wonder where my dreams started; if they ended at all.

From the basement I heard the doorbell. The bottom of the stairs was a slate of moldy, wet concrete. I cautiously walked up the staircase. The low groans of the wood with each step. I kept my eyes at the top, not even to look down. I rounded the corner head first, and through the kitchen, I saw at the front door. The house pitched black.

A hazy silhouette was back lit on the other side of the covered stained glass. The doorbell rang again as I walked closer. I felt my eyes dilate. The hunched figure slithering its head in front of the glass.

“Go away!”

The silhouette straightened up. From knocking to banging to thundering smacks. The door shook from the impact. The silhouette cried out. The door handle turned. I backed away into the kitchen, meeting a wall. I slammed my eyes shut and crouched on the ground, drawing my knees to my chest. I buried my head in my arms.

“This is just a dream”

The front door opened, then it closed. I kept my eyes shut as the creaking of the floorboards drew nearer. There came a muffled voice. I tried to listen but it was inaudible. The creaking stopped. From the corner of my eye, peaking between my legs, the mass was in front of me, this time with two legs.

I bolted up, grabbing a knife from the counter. I swore it to hell, screaming that if it takes any steps closer I will send it back from the depths it emerged. The mass took a step away, arms up, palms out towards me. The disfigured face spoke with a muffled voice; I still could not understand it. The droning that came from its mouth was piercing my ears. It took a step closer.

I once again charged the mass. However, this time, I punctured the being. I felt a warm push of breath on my cheek. I looked down at the knife, covered in a runny liquid. I wrapped my other arm around it, commanding it to the top of the stairs. The struggle knocked us off balance, thumping into the walls and countertops. I stared at its face, ugly and misshapen. With its back to the stairs, I pushed. 

The mass tumbled down. I heard parts of it snap. Its arms reached out, scrapping along the narrow walls. With one last thud it tore some of the covering on a window. Bright yellow daylight entered. At the bottom of my staircase was a broken entanglement of mass. That mass turned into a body. The body of Arthur.

The dark and black was replaced by flesh and blood. Small, smeared red trails along my walls and floor. Bloody handprints on my shirt and countertops. The collection of red inching along the concrete floor. The light glistened over his body. The emotionless expression with half-drawn eyes basking in the sun. The knife peaked out of his chest. Only silence. Deafening silence.

All I could do was hope to wake up soon.
