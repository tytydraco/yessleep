Early winter usually keeps me away from that path, but the weather was surprisingly nice that day. I decided to walk home through the park-like forested area instead of taking the main road. It was more of a small woodland trail than an actual park.

In the summer I loved going that way, cooler than the city, birds chirping everywhere. Even in winter it wasn’t ugly, but… who really wants to take long walks in the cold?

I was completely lost in my thoughts when I stepped out onto a clearing and saw something unexpected.

Two little kids were kneeling on the ground. Their backpacks were tossed into the bushes with their jackets. They were staring intently at something on the forest floor, so close that it looked like they were trying to shove their heads into the dirt.


“Butthead!” one of the boys yelled toward the ground, then burst out laughing.


I smiled. Just harmless, childish nonsense. I was curious what was making them laugh so hard.


“Fart!” the other kid shouted, adjusting his yellow pom-pom beanie.


They laughed even harder. I kept smiling politely.


“Penis!” the blond one screamed down toward the ground, his messy hair blowing gently in the cold breeze.


“What are you boys doing out here?” I asked, stepping closer.


Kids messing around here wasn’t unusual. There’s a school nearby, little ones come here to poke at worms and collect bugs, and the older ones sneak off to smoke or make out behind the trees.


“Look, mister!” the boy in the yellow hat said, pointing at the ground.


I glanced down, and froze.

I’d been walking this path for years, and I’d never seen anything like it.

There was a hole in the ground. About the size of a bigger melon, perfectly round, and so deep that I couldn’t see the bottom, just darkness.

I blinked, confused. What could’ve made something like that? I didn’t know any animal that burrowed straight down and left such a clean, vertical shaft.


“What is this, guys?” I asked, leaning in a little to see better.


“It’s a hole,” the blond kid said flatly. “What else would it be?”


I shrugged. It wasn't like I had a better answer. But something about it felt… wrong.

The hole was too smooth, too even. It looked like the ground had collapsed in a perfectly vertical line—or like workers had drilled a utility shaft there. Except… we were in the middle of nowhere. Why would anyone dig a hole out here?


“And watch this!” the boy in the yellow hat said. He leaned over the hole and shouted: “BOOGER!”


His voice echoed. But not normally, wrongly, unnaturally.
It sounded like a hundred children yelled the same word back from deep underground.
The smile slid off my face. A strange heaviness settled in my stomach.


“Hah… heh… okay, good one,” I forced a small laugh. “But I think you should head home. It’s getting dark.”


“Don’t tell us what to do,” the blond boy snapped.


I swallowed hard. His tone had changed, sharper, almost angry, as if the simple suggestion offended him.


“I just don’t think it’s safe to play around this hole at night,” I tried again, in a gentler voice. “You might fall in.”


The boys shot me one more irritated glance, then turned away as if I wasn’t even there, kneeling beside the hole again and staring into the darkness.


“Where are your parents, anyway?” I tried again, hoping something, anything, might get through to them.


“Pff…” The boy in the yellow beanie puffed out an annoyed breath. “Just leave us alone.”


The blond kid didn’t answer. He just picked up a small pebble and tossed it into the hole.


“Guys, I really can’t just leave you out here,” I said, trying to sound calm and reasonable. “We don’t even know what this hole is. Maybe you should head back to school.”


The boys glanced at each other. A quick, strange, conspiratorial look passed between them, like they were silently agreeing on… something.


“Yell into it,” the blond boy said at last. “You shout something in there too. Then we’ll go.”


My stomach knotted.
I don’t know why, but something about that hole filled me with a deep, instinctive dread. Maybe it was irrational, but I froze up.

Both boys looked up at me with mocking little smirks, as if they already knew exactly how much that dark, gaping hole unnerved me.


“Well?” the yellow-beanie kid taunted. “You scared? It’s just yelling. Watch!”


He leaned down over the hole again, practically shoving his entire head into the darkness. I watched in horror, half expecting him to fall in… or for something else to reach up and grab him.

Nothing happened.


“Chicken!” he screamed into the hole.


The echoes erupted instantly.
Dozens of children’s voices, distorted, wrong, repeated the word back at us in unison.

I clenched my jaw, scraping my teeth with my tongue.
I couldn’t believe two little kids were scaring the shit out of me with a stupid hole in the ground.
They laughed, clutching their stomachs, their giggles filling the quiet forest.


“Fine,” I muttered, trying to shake off the creeping realization that something was very wrong here. “Let’s just get this over with, and then we can all go.”


The boys lit up with excitement, like they had been waiting for me to say that the entire time.

I stepped carefully toward the edge of the hole. They crouched beside it, eyes practically sparkling as they waited to hear what I would shout in. Something crude, no doubt.

But as I knelt down beside the hole, trying to think of some dumb word to yell…
I saw something.
Deep down. In the darkness. Just a flicker, like something glinted far below.
And then, it moved.


“What the hell is down there?” I yelped, stumbling backward. “What’s at the bottom?”


I scrambled to my feet, brushing dirt and wet leaves off my ass. The boys stared at me again, angry, unblinking, but still didn’t move away from the hole.


“There’s nothing in it,” the kid in the yellow hat said, leaning over again. “Stop being such a wuss.”


“Yeah,” the blond boy grumbled. “You’re a grown man and you’re being a total chicken.”


I had no idea what to do.
They were terrifying and completely ordinary at the same time. A cold fear crept up my spine, but I tried to hold myself together.


“We’re leaving,” I finally said, forcing firmness into my voice. “Come on!”


I reached out and grabbed the blond boy’s arm to pull him away.

And then, everything twisted.

The moment I touched him, his arm bent in a way an arm should never bend. He shrieked, an animalistic, broken sound, and thrashed violently, yanking himself out of my grip, twisting, jerking like something possessed.


“YELL INTO IT! YELL INTO IT! YELL INTO IT!” he screamed, his voice cracking as he convulsed.


“Come on!” the yellow-hat kid shrieked beside the hole. “Come oooon!”


I let go instantly. The blond kid collapsed to the ground, writhing and flailing like a rabid animal.


“Come on! Yell into it! Come oooon! Yell into it!” they chanted, alternating, their voices rising into something manic and trance-like.


I stood frozen. Shock rooted me to the spot. I had no idea what was happening to these kids, or what was happening to me.

And then I heard it.
Not just their two voices. The hole itself was echoing them.

Dozens of voices, children’s voices, warped and unnatural, rose up from the darkness below:


“Yell into it…”


It wasn’t an echo anymore. It was a crowd.
I went cold.

Only one thought was left in my mind: Run.

I spun around and sprinted as fast as I could. The voices followed me, bouncing between the trees, echoing through the forest, as if the whole damn woods were screaming after me.


I ran as fast as my legs could carry me.
The kids’ voices were screaming in my head… or maybe they weren’t in my head at all, maybe they were echoing through the entire forest.

It was almost dark when I finally saw the glow of the road up ahead.
I just needed to reach it. I just needed out.

What I didn’t notice…was the car.

I stumbled out of the bushes right as a pair of headlights flashed across my vision.

The next thing I knew, I was lying on the asphalt.
Everything hurt. The world spun around me… and then it all went black.


Thankfully, the driver who hit me called an ambulance, and I ended up in the hospital.
A couple of broken bones, a concussion, nothing life-threatening. I recovered after a few weeks.

The police questioned me about what happened, but I couldn’t explain it properly.
I told them what I saw… and they gave me strange looks, confused looks, the kind of looks you get when people politely decide you’re insane.

Honestly, I probably should’ve kept my mouth shut.

When I was finally discharged, I couldn’t stop thinking about the kids. I avoided the forest completely. But the memory of that hole wouldn’t leave me alone.

One day, the police called me back in.
Some issue with the paperwork on my statement, they said. I had to come down in person.

That’s when it happened.
I was sitting across from the officer’s desk, staring at the wall behind him, rows of posters, faces, names, dates.


“Uh… excuse me,” I said, pointing. “Who are those?”


The officer glanced over his shoulder, barely pausing from his writing.


“Missing persons,” he said flatly. “Some wanted notices too.”


“And those two kids?” I pressed, pointing at the two familiar faces.


This time he looked more closely.


“Oh. Those,” he said with the same cold, detached tone. “They went missing years ago. They’re not turning up.”


I went silent.

I recognized them. Both of them.
The blond hair.
The yellow pom-pom hat.

A chill crawled up my spine so violently I thought I might pass out.
