I moved into my new apartment two months ago. It’s small, a single-bedroom unit in a quiet complex, nothing fancy, but the rent was dirt cheap. The landlord said something about low demand for this particular unit, but I didn’t ask questions. I just needed a place to get back on my feet. I should’ve asked questions.

The first week was fine—great, even. The walls are thick, the neighbors are quiet, and the building has a comforting hum that helped me sleep at night. But then, on the seventh night, I heard it. A knock.

It was soft at first, like someone lightly tapping their knuckles against wood. I figured it was my neighbor on the other side of the wall, maybe hanging something up or tapping furniture into place. But then it came again, louder this time. And it wasn’t coming from the wall—it was coming from inside my apartment.

I laughed it off. It had to be the pipes, right? Old building, old pipes. That’s what I told myself, anyway. But the knocking didn’t stop. It came every night, always at random intervals. Sometimes it was so faint I almost missed it. Other times, it was sharp and deliberate, like someone demanding to be let out.

Last week, I decided to investigate. My apartment is small, with barely any furniture, so it didn’t take long to check every corner. I opened cabinets, looked under the bed, even crawled into the cramped utility closet, but there was nothing. Nowhere for anyone—or anything—to hide.

I was about to give up when the knocking started again, this time from the kitchen. I froze, my heart racing. The kitchen only has a fridge, a sink, and an old pantry door. I stood there for what felt like hours, staring at that door. The knocking continued, rhythmic and deliberate, like someone drumming their fingers against the wood.

I don’t know why, but I opened it. Maybe I was expecting to see something—someone—on the other side. But it was empty, just shelves lined with canned food and dry pasta. I laughed, but it was forced, shaky. As I closed the pantry door, I swear I felt something push back against it.

A few nights ago, things escalated. I woke up to the sound of banging—full, desperate pounding on the walls. It echoed through the apartment, coming from everywhere at once. I grabbed a flashlight and bolted out of bed, yelling, “Who’s there? What do you want?”

The noise stopped immediately. The silence that followed was suffocating.

Then came the whispering.

It was faint at first, just barely audible over the ringing in my ears. A low murmur, like a voice struggling to form words. It was coming from behind the pantry door. I stood frozen, gripping the flashlight so hard my knuckles turned white. The whispers grew louder, more insistent, until they were clear enough to understand.

“Let me out.”

I haven’t opened the pantry door since that night. I tried barricading it with my kitchen table, but the knocking hasn’t stopped. It’s louder now, more frantic. Last night, I heard scratching, like nails scraping against wood.

I called my landlord this morning, demanding answers. He sounded nervous, hesitant, like he was trying to decide whether to tell me the truth or hang up. Finally, he said, “That unit’s been empty for years. The last tenant… well, they disappeared. No one’s seen them since.”

I don’t know what’s happening in this apartment, and I don’t think I want to. I’m writing this from my car because I can’t go back inside. But even now, sitting in the parking lot, I can hear the knocking. It’s coming from the trunk.
