The Oliver House at 27 Broadway St. is probably the most notorious haunted location in Tole-do. When I first moved here and told people I hunt ghosts, Oliver House was the one place they always brought up. Its ghostly reputation is known to all. What made this building even more of a golden goose was how the owners wouldn’t allow any ghost hunters in to properly ghost hunt it. They were very protective of their ghosts. After ten years of dreaming at my chance to investigate the Oliver House, fate intervened and they allowed me exclusive access to their facility. My time there did not disappoint and it definitely lived up to its reputation!  
This historic building was named after Major William Oliver from Cincinnati. He had fought in the Battle of 1812 and was one of the original settlers of Toledo. He was determined to make his mark on the community so he built the first high class hotel in town. He picked Broadway St. because the train depot was just down the street. He wanted his hotel to be the first thing anyone saw as they entered into the city. The building took seven years to complete and sadly Mr. Oliver died before the hotel was finished. Both his daughter Hattie and son-in-law James Hall took over operations and had their Grand Opening celebration on July 1, 1859.   
At the time, Toledo was still a relatively small city. It had only been founded 26 years prior in 1833. It had seen little growth because Michigan had been fighting over the ‘Toledo territory’ until 1837. Once that was dealt with, the city built the Miami and Erie Canal in 1845 which provided water to everyone in town. This set the stage for the Oliver House to open in 1859.  
The swanky hotel offered many enticing amenities to wealthy businessmen visiting Toledo. Each of the 171 rooms had running water, limited indoor plumbing, fireplaces, private rooms, and steam heaters. They were also the first to introduce wallpaper and gaslights to the city. The staff even had to post signs around the hotel advising guests not to blow the gaslight flames out or else they would wake up dead in the morning from the fumes.    
Then like so, As one walked into the front entrance, the check-in desk greeted you along with a large table full of daily newspapers. The stairs on the right lead to the second floor containing a bar, billiard room (also used as the men’s smoking lounge) and a barber shop. The stairs to the left led to offices, hotel rooms, and a dining room that could also be converted into a ballroom. Out back were the ice house, coal storage and horse stables. Rooms started at $2.50 a night while the hotel staff only made 10 cents a day. It’s rumored that President Abraham Lincoln once stayed overnight while attending a friend’s funeral but it’s confirmed that President Ulysses S. Grant visited in 1873 with General William Sherman.
