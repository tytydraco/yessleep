I thought it would just be another boring day at work I work right now in the control tower at the airport I had worked there for 4 years and it was a fun job as well. When I went to work, I got a call from my best friend who works there. -You John we have a little problem here. He said -Oh what is it Leon!? -But there is an aircraft that is marked with Mh370.  
  
I was very surprised, MH370 what a plane that disappeared 9 years ago. Everyone thinks it was a hijack, but no one actually knows. When I got to work I went straight to my seat to have a look at what Leon had said. And yes, he was right. Off the coast of Indonesia it was an airplane that was marked with "MH370" I didn't know what happened, why an airplane was marked with this type of "callsing". I tried to call the plane to ask why that F plane was marked like that, the plane disappeared several years ago! How can it even still fly?

 I called the plane but I got no answer. I called the search team to track the plane, I tried to contact it for a whole hour. But in the end the conversation went ahead... I ask what happened there and why the hell they had labeled themselves with that "title". But it was completely silent, not a sound, but finally I heard a man. He tried to say something but the only thing that came out of his mouth sounded like a zombie growling, he managed a few words that gave me shivers, "help please everyone....kill" I sat completely still in terror, the search team arrived at the airport and I told everything, I decided to go along,

 Leon along, I wanted to wonder what happened on that plane. I went with Leon, and I had a tracker with me so we could find the plane, after a 6 hour ride we found the plane. It was crashed on an island off Australia. We decided to go in and have a look, When we got in I almost threw up.... All the bodies were completely bloody. Most of them had their organs on the outside. It was terrible. We took the black box with us before we left. I later got to hear the recordings. We heard some voice... who later said that everyone who makes noise dies..

 I wonder what the hell this was but I continued to listen. I heard a man say "Huh? then later I heard meat being pulled apart. Everyone was screaming later and everything. I continued to hear flesh turning in the feature and blood splashing across the walls. I later heard someone say something in a low tone "i hope u keep the airplane keep going so we don't crash" a little girl said. Then I heard an inhuman voice say "I'm going to knock out this damn radar and keep the plane going"!!!!!! the little girl just answered "ok" then i heard that this creature killed her. I was scared as hell. I ran out and went home as fast as possible. I stopped working there after that. And I will never fly an airplane again
