TW: child abuse, domestic abuse.

Before I tell you what happened, I want to give a little precursor. Till I was about 12 I lived in this 2 story, sky blue, house. My parents got it when they got married. They had me about 3 years after getting married. When my dad's mom passed away, he was devastated. He began to drink every night. My dad was a mean drunk, at best he would have fought, and at worst… I still have scars. My mom was a nice woman but she still loved him. which meant till I was 11, I had to live with him. As a coping mechanism, I devolved imaginary friends about three. When I was 12 we decided to leave the house. They didn’t come with. 

Recently I decided to go back. I don’t know why, but I felt compelled. So I hopped in my car and drove 2 hours to the house. As I stop outside, I see my old house. What used to be a good-looking, clean, light blue house, now was an abandoned, dirty, destroyed “house”. It was barely in one piece. As I stepped inside I was surprised. Despite being abandoned for nearly 10 years, it had no dust. The furniture, while being very worn, was still “good”. I looked around the downstairs still shocked at its cleanliness. Everything was where we left it. Eventually, I went upstairs. As soon as I took the first step I felt an odd presence. Like the feeling you have when you’re in the room with someone, the difference is that I (thought) I was alone. I continued thinking it was nothing. The first I went to was my room. It still has my bed, desk, everything. My race car bed was tucked in, my desk was well, a mess.  I looked around, my bed, my shelves. When I got to looking at my old drawings I found one particular that stood out. Written in red crayon and big letters it said:

My friends 

My friends peeps and Showy and shades

Peeps is a lil guy that peeps through doorways and  looks through the window

Showy is a shy guy that lives in my shower He is very shy

Shades stands in the corner of my room he has cool glasses he tall

They're very nice except for shades he doesn’t play with me ):

After reading, out of paranoia I looked in the corner. Seeing nothing there I audibly sighed. That didn’t last long. I started walking out of the room and - I locked eyes. It was peeps. A wrinkled, reddish brown, small head on at least 6 feet neck. I screamed as it pulled away. HOLY SHIT! I ran out of the room and locked myself in the bathroom. I took deep breaths. What the actual fuck was that?! So much for goddamn “imaginary friends”. When I calmed down a little. I started to think. Oh, my fffuck. I forgot. To make sure I took a peep and my eyes met. In the shower. A pale blue, skinny humanoid creature. Showy.
