Due to life’s unpredictable circumstances I found myself moving into a trailer before my second borns birth. Packing up my then 3 year old, and two cats, I swallowed my pride. realizing our children needed a roof over their head, stability, and a place to call home. As a single mom of two, this was all I could afford. 

A small dingy place, with just enough room to establish as our own. The girls toys took up the majority of our spare room. Them taking the master bedroom, just beyond the back door, as their own. Leaving me the couch in the living room just down the hall. It was chaotic but filled with laughter, the kids unaware of my financial stresses. This is our fortress. Maybe that’s why it took so long to notice. 

Between work, school schedules, and coparenting, and just general every day stress, It took two years to start seeing the signs. It was subtle. 

My oldest became a bit more withdrawn, but I figured that just happened with age, and the addition of a sibling. I tried, and kept trying to reach out to her. Being her comfort and support, she didn’t give me much. Often opting to play alone with video games. 

My youngest waking, crying in the night. “Noooo,” she’d cry, “nooo grandpa!” As I’m confusingly stumbling in to sooth her from what could only be a bad dream. This happened often. Then more often. Until it was becoming almost a nightly thing. Who is “grandpa”? 

I couldn’t figure out what was causing it. She wasn’t sick, she didn’t have a fever, she was comfortable, fed, and had her favorite stuffed animal. Her sister seemingly sleeping soundly beside her. She had her nightlight. Her sippy. Her favorite pillow. I limited screen time and monitored what she watched. 

It hardly registered the room was illuminating yellow from the floodlight creeping in the back window. Maybe I just assumed it was the cats. 

Until one night, at about 1 am, after yet another cry from her, I seen him. Just a glimpse, as I was squeezing out of the crack in the bedroom door. Finally getting her settled after yet another night terror. The back porch floodlight kicked on, I froze. Heart racing, my stomach sunk like lead. Eyes locked on.. Who was that?

Mind racing a mile a minute, as the blur of an old man dashes across the back porch. It could have been comical in the right setting, with long exaggerated fast steps tip toeing towards the steps. But it was utterly horrific in that instance. 

From his long grey, greasy hair catching in the wind balding on top. His large heavy torso in comparison to his thin legs and arms. to his Freddy Krueger resemblance dirty dingy long sleeve shirt, to the shiny black dress shoes on his feet. It’s burned in my memory. 

Was my front door locked? I bolted. Not knowing what else to do, I choked back the scream caught in my throat and frantically, clumsily, forced my way to the front of the now very thin feeling, weakly structured home. I locked the door. Not owning any guns, I found the sharpest knife I could and my cell phone. I called the cops. 

Two big officers showed up with patrol lights flashing in the matter of minutes. It is a small town after all. Living just on the outskirts, near the woods. what once felt like privacy, now felt like his coverage. They did a walk around my small property, finding nothing. Reassuring they will patrol the area, staying close. 

Unable to sleep, I laid in the back bedroom with my girls until morning. Counting how many times the floodlights came on. Five. Five more times that night. Paralyzed and unable to move. My daughters slept soundly beside me while I tried to visualize the best course of action should he try to close in. 

My oldest the next morning, looking at me knowingly, said he visits every night. When I’m asleep. Said he stares through the window. With his big open eyes and long nose pressed against the glass, frantically whispering. Demanding they let him in. Getting angrier and angrier, until the little one inevitably awakes. She said she pretends to sleep, holding her baby sister, to keep her safe. 

Only leaving when her sister cries, or the floodlights kick on.
