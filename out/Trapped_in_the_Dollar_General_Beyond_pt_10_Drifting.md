Pt 9- https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesOfDarkness/comments/167mvuw/comment/jzkr5bt/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3  
I woke up to find Gale still hadn’t come back.  
  
  
Well, I guess that's not entirely true.  
  
  
He came back, but he left me a note.  
  
  
I woke up to a rumbling belly and a full bladder. After taking care of my various needs, I came back to the sleeping area with a waffle sandwich and a cup of OJ. If you’ve never made one before, they’re pretty easy to make. Take two waffles (mine are plain but you do you), and cook eggs, bacon , cheese, and whatever spices you’re going to use, and then put it on the waffles. Add syrup or whatever (I added blackberry jam) and consume. It’s pretty tasty.  
  
  
I sat the orange juice down before I noticed the note.  
  
  
I slid it out from under the juice and saw that it was from Gale. His handwriting is pretty distinct, and as I munched the sandwich and read the note, I found my appetite leaving me. I had expected him to say that he needed some time, that he was sorry for what he had done, and how he was ashamed of killing the man. I didn’t think he really had anything to be sorry for, personally, but people accept things in different ways. If Gale needed some time then I sure as hell wasn’t going to get in his way. I would sit here and wait for him and, when he came back, I would show him the journal from Celene and everything would be good again. He’d be excited and we’d strike out to find her and then we’d find a way out of these stores and back to reality.  
  
  
What I read, however, was closer to a Dear John letter.  
  
  
Gale was leaving, and might not come back.  
  
  
This is hard for me, but I need some space. I’ve been intending to leave for a little while now, but I feel you need to know why. I know you’ve recognized the slips when I talk to you, and as much as I’d like to use you as a replacement for my son, that's not fair to either of us. You just remind me so much of him, and it hurts me sometimes to be around you. It makes me miss him, it makes my soul hurt, and it makes me realize that I’ve been scared to really go looking for him. So, that's what I’m doing. I’m going to look for Rudy, or what's left of him. I’m going into the ceiling. I’m going back to where it all began for me, and I’m going to find him. Don’t come in after me and please don’t blame yourself. This is something I should have done the day after he went into the ceiling, and I’m a coward for waiting so long.  
  
  
Now, I don’t want to gloss over what happened with the old man, because that was a big part of this decision. When he jumped on me, I was squished and lost my breath. As I lay there trying to get my bearings, I looked up and, for a half a second, it looked like he was choking Rudy. I could see his face turning purple, his eyes bulging out, and I acted in a blind rage. I’ve never killed another living person, never even really been in a real fight, but killing that old man makes me feel bad. He was protecting himself as much as I was protecting you, and I just can’t get over what I did. I went back after I’d calmed down and wrapped him in his filthy blankets before setting it on fire and giving him a proper send off. I tried dragging him through the door, but he was still dead. You can add that to your rules, I guess. Dead stays Dead, and there's no changing that. I laid him to rest though and doused him in enough lighter fluid to set half the store on fire. His trash burned with him, so maybe give FF a little while before you go back, though I can’t think of any reason why you would.   
  
  
Keep traveling, keep learning, keep searching, and find a way out of here. If I can come back, I will.  
  
  
For better or worse, I’m going to see my son.  
  
  
Good luck to you, Alphabet Man.  
  
  
Good Luck to you, my friend.  
  
  
Gale  
  
  
I read it until the tears falling out of my eyes smeared the words.  
  
  
I threw the remains of my sandwich towards the back of the store.  
  
  
It had turned to ash in my mouth.  
  
  
Gale was gone. For better or for worse, he was gone, and I was alone again. I reached for the journal, wanting to throw it into the store as well, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. It was precious knowledge, and it might help me find someone else who was trapped here. If Celene was still here somewhere then I owed it to Gale to find her and try to help her out.   
  
  
It’s what he would have wanted, after all.  
  
  
So, I packed up some things, the journal being among them, but when I picked up the bag that the journal had been in, I felt something else in the front pocket. It turned out to be a second journal, this one older and held together with rubber bands. The spine had disintegrated and it was just paper held between a cover at this point. It smelled foul and I supposed it had belonged to the old hermit. He had likely stuck it in here for safe keeping and I wondered if Celene’s journal had been how he learned to travel through the stores. I didn’t really want to sit down for another long read right then, so I tucked it away and decided I’d come back to it later.   
  
  
I went back to KK first, hoping he might have lost his nerve, but not expecting he would have.  
  
  
I saw the familiar store, the chaos of the moved items and tossed aside merchandise, and it was hard to miss the open ladder in the middle of the floor. Gale had made good on his promise, it seemed, and now he had gone into whatever lay above. Whether or not I’d ever see him again, I didn’t know, but I left a message on the door just in case. If he came back, I wanted him to know where to find me.  
  
  
Gale- Meet me at the Hub if you get this.  
  
  
Celene- You don’t know me, but I’m friends with Gale. If you see this, stay here and I’ll come back sometimes to check. I have your journal, so if you see me, I’m a friend.  
  
  
Not sure what else to do, I started traveling again.   
  
  
I had no clue where I was going, but I knew that I wanted to make notes on all the places I could see. I wanted to make a complete folio of the stores, a guide to finding particular places, and I knew that I’d have to explore to make that happen. It made me feel like a pioneer, charting a map for those who might come after me, though I wondered how they would ever get it? Would someone find it on my corpse one day? Stuffed in a tattered old bag that had laid somewhere for a long time? Who knew, but it was something to do and I was up to the task.   
  
  
I went back to the start, the destroyed remains of my first store, and made my way back from there. I had kind of flown through them on my first trip, taking in little and just plunging in for the sake of moving. I wrote down everything, made notes on all the stores I visited, and committed as much of it as I could to my phone for backup. I’m probably going to post a more complete document at some point, but for now I’ll probably leave it to little snippets. The stores are pretty creative and not all of them are uninhabited, as I’ve mentioned. Not by people, though I have noticed things or spirits or something in some of the places.   
  
  
Here, I’ll tell you about a few more of the stores I’ve seen in my travels since otherwise this might be a little dull for an update.  
  
  
  
D   
Designation- Low Danger  
People- 0  
Food- Plentiful but weird  
Theme- A normal Dollar General where pets are people and people are pets  
D is a perfectly normal store, but the roles of humans and pets seem to be reversed. The tags on the clothes, the models on the products, the advertisements, they all feature anthropomorphic animals. The pet food cans feature naked people looking at the camera in a lost and confused way. I’ve never seen any of the residents of this place and I hope not to. The food here is edible but it tastes like pet food. There's a lot of chicken and fish on the shelf and all the cereal appears to be kibble.  
  
  
E   
Designation- Moderate to High Danger  
People- 0  
Food- Limited but present  
Theme- The floor is lava store  
E has a floor that is made partially of lava. Some of it is normal floor, but you’ll turn a corner and suddenly there's a river of lava. The music here is just the sound of a lava flow, and its stiflingly hot. The shelves contain food, but the lava flow will change direction sometimes and it's dangerous to stay here for too long. The floor seems immune to the lava flow and is fine once it leaves. The food here is mostly spicy stuff, but it is edible. The walls of the store are made of rock and it's like being in an active volcano. I haven’t been brave enough to touch the lava to make sure it’s hot, but it will burn other things. When I tossed a journal into the flow, it devoured it and it wasn’t on the floor when it left.  
  
  
F   
Designation- Low to moderate Danger  
People- 4 to 5 creatures  
Theme- The TV store  
F is one of the stores with inhabitants. The beings who live here are dressed as normal Dollar General employees, but their heads are TV’s. They mostly ignore you, but if you tap on them, they turn and “look” at you. Their faces are all staticy so its hard to tell if they’re looking at you or not, but its like you can feel their eyes on you sometimes. The weirder thing is that all the food is in the TV’s. The shelves are full of old fashioned TV’s and the food comes in the form of commercials. When you see the food you want, you reach into the tv set and take it. Sometimes it's fully cooked, sometimes it's frozen, but it's always real food. It’s like that in every department too. I pulled an entire futon out of one the other day and I suspect that Gale had been using this one to stock his safe house. Unlike the other stores, the TV’s always seem to have product on hand so they don’t run out if you don’t mind being patient.   
That's just a few of the stores I explored today, but they really do seem to be infinite.   
  
  
It’s lonely now, traveling by myself, but I’ve been trying to leave signs behind in case Celene is still wandering around. I’ve been using the break rooms, like Gale did, and letting her know where I’ve been and what I’ve seen. I make trips back to KK a lot to look for Gale, but he hasn’t shown up yet. I climbed the ladder the other day, just climbed it to the top and stood there staring into the darkness. If I was braver, I would have gone in after him.  
  
  
If I was braver, the last message might have been my last update.  
  
  
I stayed for a while, just thinking about what I was going to do. I had the infinite to explore, a huge number of stores to see and catalog, but it all seemed so pointless to me. It’s like the cellphones we carry, they can access a nearly infinite amount of knowledge, but thinking about it is kind of a lot. We use it to watch videos of cats or argue with each other, because the idea of accessing the infinite knowledge there is outside our understanding. We don’t like to think about the infinite, it's too big. It defies our understanding, so we scrape away at it rather than dive in.  
  
  
I could go anywhere, do anything, but my brain was telling me to sit and to wait while it tried to understand all my options.  
  
  
That's why I was sitting in KK, laying on the front counter, actually, when the last thing I expected to happen happened.  
  
  
The front doors slid open.  
  
  
It was sudden and nearly silent. I almost missed it, honestly, but it was the slight squeal of hinges at the end that turned my head. The door was open, the outside nothing but grainy darkness that seemed to move as I watched it. There was a lamppost out there, the only light to be seen, and the longer I looked at it, the more I knew why the moths circled them. It was beautiful, almost too much to resist, and as I lay there looking at it I wondered why I was resisting? What did I have to stay here for? This place was just more of the same, but the outside was something new.  
  
  
What wonders might I find out there?  
  
  
Its still open, inviting me outside, while I write this. I put some food in my bag, some water and a few other things, and prepared to step outside. I don’t know if I’ll be back again. I don’t know if my phone will work out there, but if I can, I will. Maybe I’ll find Gale out there. Maybe I’ll even find Kenneth, who knows.  
  
  
Till next time.
