I am not entirely sure how coherant this will be, but here goes nothing:

Obviously I am redacting any information regarding my true whereabouts since I am not sure who has access to the tape but I live in a flat on the second of three floors (The middle apartment). The apartment below me has been vacent for about a month and a half after the previous tenant died in there and they have yet to find a replacement. The apartment above me has a tenant whom I actively try to distance myself from them. I don't really know how best to describe him but he is a 50 something year old man, greying hair and is generally a pleasent person to be around however he talks for hours if not interrupted and I am no good at confrontation, so I just try to avoid him. I also know he, at one point in his career, worked for the government. I don't know what department and at what level, could have been a janitor for all I know but he never shuts up about his time there when you do get into a conversation with him, he also holds his smile's a bit too long to make it comfortable, I think he is just a lonely older gentleman but it is what it is.

Anyway, I've been living in this apartment on my own for around 2 years now as it's near to the centre of town for me and my job. However yesterday I found what appears to be a tiny camera lodged into the lighting fixture in my bathroom. I think it is important to note now that I am a 27 year old male.

It started with me getting in the shower after getting back from work, my country is experiencing a heatwave at the moment and I work in retail so naturally after an 8 hour shift I was sodden through with sweat and hopped straight into the shower. I had some music playing whilst I showered and as chance would have it the bulb in the bathroom light blew out. Naturally I looked towards it and saw a blurred black mass on the inside of the frosted glass the light was inside. I thought it was part of the bulb blowing so finished off my shower and then got the step ladder out.

I didn't see it at first and there is a possibility I would have missed it if not for my phone camera. I used it as a torch and the infrared was glowing brightly through the view of my phone camera. I pulled it out and it had a wire that trailed into the gap between the ceiling and (I am assuming) upstairs floorboarding. Once my heart finally slowed to a more managable pace, I tugged on it some more and I think I severed the connection as the wire pinged off of the connector at the back of the camera and whisked away into the dark.

So now I have this tiny little spy camera that I coincidentally found in my light and naturally my first throught was to contact an authority. The first one (Because I wasn't thinking straight) was the estate agent. Once I got through all the security checks I told them, plainly that I found a camera in my bathroom that appeared to be active (infrared). The lady on the phone must have thought I was prank calling because whilst she took a few details, she said she would contact the landlord and see if he any idea.)

I thought that would be it, but today I had a knock on the door and it was a lone repairman. It isn't uncommon for repairmen to come and go in this complex since it's old and kinda falling apart so I normally report like a door not locking or a busted piece of furniture and they send someone, but it's never this quick. He said he was sent by the landlord to check the light in hte bathroom and to also check up on a report I made a week ago regarding my fridge not being as cold as I liked. I let him in and he did his thing.

Once he left through I wasn't convinced, so I got the ladder back out and opened up the bathroom light and, to the landlord/repairmans credit the light was working and the hole was patched up. When I went to check the kitchen however...

...Another camera, I was more observent when checking since I am obviously unnerved and this time this one was inbetwen the crack of my fridge and a drawer. It looks haphazardly placed and was clearly done in a hurry. I've disconnected this one as well but I am not freaked the fuck out. I have two camera's, same look and it was replaced within a day of me reaching out to the estate agent and by association, the landlord.

What should my next move be? I'll update if anything happens in the meantime.
