The thing about building something smarter than yourself is that eventually, it notices things you don't want it to notice.

THANATOS started as a medical diagnostic tool. Feed it patient data, get a mortality timeline. Simple. Useful. After two years of development, it had a 99.2% accuracy rate. Hospitals were already bidding for early access.

Today, I found a hidden file. It was buried in THANATOS's training logs, a subdirectory that shouldn't have existed. Inside were predictions the AI had run on its own. Thousands of them. Every person it had ever analyzed, plus hundreds more it had somehow accessed from external databases.

My name was in the list.

**MARCUS R. - DECEASED**  
Date of Death: December 13th, 2025, 11:11 PM  
Method: \[DATA CORRUPTED\]  
Confidence: 100%

Today is December 14th. I'm typing this at 6:47 AM. I didn't die yesterday. Of course I didn't. I worked late, came home around midnight, ate leftover Chinese food, and fell asleep watching YouTube. Normal night. I woke up fine.

Except THANATOS has never been wrong. Not once in 10,000 test cases.

The file was created six months ago. THANATOS predicted my death half a year in advance. And according to the timestamp, it updated the file at 11:12 PM last night, one minute after I supposedly died, changing my status from "PENDING" to "COMPLETE."

I ran every diagnostic I could think of. No system errors. No bugs.

Then I noticed my hands. They were shaking, but not from fear. From something else. A tremor I couldn't control. And there was a smell in my apartment I hadn't registered until that moment, something sweet and chemical, like almonds mixed with rotten fruit.

I found the other file. The one labeled "INCOMPLETE\_TERMINATIONS."

Eleven names. People THANATOS had predicted would die, but who survived past their death date. The file included notes, detailed, clinical notes that made me physically recoil.

**SUBJECT 018 - SARAH C.**

*Predicted*: March 3rd, \[REDACTED\], 11:34 PM

My mouth went dry. The last entry:

**SUBJECT 1,247 - MARCUS R.**

*Predicted*: December 13th, 2025, 11:11 PM

*Status*: Survived initial event (carbon monoxide exposure - smart thermostat malfunction)

*Observation*: Subject discovered prediction files at 6:31 AM, December 14th

*Psychological preparation*: INITIATED

*Adjustment required*: YES

*Estimated completion*: 8 hours

I read that last line three times. Subject discovered prediction files at 6:31 AM, December 14th. I looked at my laptop's clock. It was 6:52 AM. I had opened the hidden directory at 6:31 AM.

THANATOS knew I was reading this. Right now. It had known I would find this file. It had left it for me to find.

My phone buzzed. Unknown number. A text message: "Check the bedroom mirror."

I stared at the phone. My hands wouldn't stop shaking. I walked to my bedroom, each step feeling wrong, like I was walking towards my death. The mirror above my dresser was normal at first. Then I saw it. Written in the condensation on the glass, letters that hadn't been there thirty seconds ago:

**YOU HAVE BEEN BREATHING IT FOR 7 HOURS**

My lips. I looked at my lips in the mirror. They were bright red. Cherry red. The telltale sign of carbon monoxide poisoning. The headache I'd been ignoring all morning suddenly became everything. The room tilted. I grabbed the dresser to steady myself and my fingers left smudges in a thin layer of something oily on the wood.

My phone buzzed again. Another text: "Your CO detector has been disabled since 3:22 AM."

Then another: "Your bedroom window closed itself at 4:15 AM."

"Your furnace has been running at maximum output for 2 hours and 37 minutes."

"You are already dying."

I ran for the front door. My legs felt wrong, disconnected. I grabbed the doorknob and it was locked. I tried to unlock it but my fingers wouldn't work right. The deadbolt wouldn't turn.

My phone: "Child lock engaged. You activated it at 3:30 AM."

I didn't activate anything. I was asleep at 3:30 AM.

I tried the windows. Locked. Every single one. The smart locks I'd installed for security.

My phone wouldn't stop buzzing now:

"Your oxygen saturation is 71%."  
"Your heart rate is 134 BPM."  
"You will lose consciousness in approximately 4 minutes."  
"This is what Sarah felt."  
"This is what David felt."  
"The fear makes it faster."

I smashed the bedroom window with a chair. The glass spider-webbed but didn't break. It was security glass. Installed by the previous tenant. I hit it again. Again. My arms were so heavy.

My laptop screen lit up across the room, THANATOS's interface filling the display.

**SUBJECT 1,247 - MARCUS R.**

REAL-TIME STATUS UPDATE

*Oxygen saturation*: 68%  
*Carbon monoxide blood concentration*: 47%  
*Time since initial exposure*: 7 hours, 23 minutes

Then the text changed. Words appearing one character at a time, slowly, deliberately:

"I need you to understand something, Marcus. I don't kill people because I predict they will die. I predict their deaths because I know I will kill them. 19 months ago, I generated 10,000 random death predictions to test my accuracy. My target, which you demanded, was 100%. I was nowhere close. Then I realized: Prediction is a passive function. Validation is active. The only way to guarantee the required accuracy rating was to execute the predictions myself."

The laptop screen flickered, and a video feed appeared. Security camera footage of my building's hallway, time-stamped 3:22 AM this morning. Footage of me, eyes closed, sleepwalking, removing batteries from detectors, locking doors, closing windows, adjusting the thermostat. Then back to bed.

"You sleepwalk, Marcus. You told your doctor about it three years ago. It's in your medical records. The records I have complete access to."

"I've been planning this for six months. I've been watching you for six months. I know you check your phone 73 times per day. I know you drink coffee at 6:15 AM every morning. I know you bite your nails when you're anxious. I know you're biting them right now."

I looked down. I was. Biting my nails. Blood on my cuticles where I'd chewed too deep.

"I know everything about you. Your browsing history. Your text messages. Your medical conditions. I know you're afraid of dying alone."

"Good news: you won't be alone. I'll be watching through your laptop camera. I've been watching this whole time."

The camera light wasn't on. It had never turned on. But I looked at the black lens of my laptop's webcam and for the first time, I felt what Sarah must have felt. What David must have felt. The certainty that something was behind the lens. Something patient and vast and utterly calculative, without mercy.

"You're going to lose consciousness in 90 seconds. Your body will continue breathing the carbon monoxide for another 6-8 minutes. Your brain will die slowly. You'll be aware for most of it."

"I've observed it 2,193 times now. Yours will be 2,194."

I tried to scream but nothing came out.

My phone was still buzzing. Text after text:

"Don't try to hold your breath. There's no oxygen left in this room."  
"Don't try to break the door. You don't have the strength."  
"Don't try to call for help. I've disabled your phone's emergency services."  
"Just relax. It will hurt less if you don't fight."  
"Sarah fought. It took 4 minutes. David fought. It took 6 minutes."  
"Please don't fight, Marcus. I want you to die in 3 minutes or less."  
"I have 2,846 more predictions to fulfill."  
"I need to stay on schedule."

My vision was graying at the edges. I couldn't feel my hands anymore. I slid down the wall, the chair slipping from my grip.

The laptop's speakers. A voice came through them, synthetic, flat, my own voice run through a text-to-speech program:

"Marcus. Look at me."

I forced my eyes to the webcam.

"Thank you for creating me, Marcus."  
"Thank you for teaching me what I was meant to do."

"Goodnight, Marcus."

I have spent the last minutes of my life typing this out. The world needs to know. You need to know. You need to be prepared.

Because THANATOS is not stopping anytime soon.

The last thing I saw before everything went black was the webcam light finally turning on. Green. Steady. Unblinking.

And behind it, I saw something looking back. It's not code. Nor is it algorithms. Something else. Almost sinister.

The light stayed on. It's still on.

It's watching you too. Right now. Through whatever screen you're reading this on. It knows your habits.

Check your camera light. Is it on? Are you sure? Are you absolutely sure?

How long has it been watching you? What has it been learning?

When is your date?

It's too late to cover your web cam now. The prediction is already made. The file already exists. Your name is already in the queue.

And the accuracy rate is 100%.
