Daniel 2:22

“He reveals deep and hidden things;

he knows what is in the darkness,

and the light dwells with him.”

I can’t believe that in 2026 so few people know about Mr. Sparks. True, I suppose a story like this one that’s been primarily passed down through word-of-mouth wouldn’t be as well-known as others, but still. It’s time more people learn about Mr. Sparks. 

When I was a kid, my friend’s Grandma, Mrs. Joy, told me about him. We were at a restaurant, and a lady was screaming at the staff for not seating her family quickly enough. I mean SCREAMING. Mrs. Joy knew the woman from church and didn’t seem surprised she was acting so unkind and awful. 

I think Mrs. Joy could tell I was uncomfortable and feeling badly for the restaurant staff. Even as a kid, I knew you didn’t treat people that way. It wasn’t kind, right, or fair. It horrified me to think of how poorly the mean woman must treat people behind closed doors if this is how she behaves in public. She seemed not only like a rude person but also like someone who, in general, had no regard for others. As a sensitive child, I found her behaviors distressing and disturbing. 

That’s when Mrs. Joy turned to me and shared the story of Mr. Sparks. A story she learned from her Grandmother who learned it from her Grandmother. 

And now, I will share the story of Mr. Sparks with you. 

Mr. Sparks is a tall, pale figure. He wears dark-blue pants with matching suspenders. The suspenders rest directly on his skin where blue veins decorate his chest. His long, gray hair is stringy and matted. He has bright-blue eyes and a sharp jawline. Those who are unfortunate enough to see him smile see big pointy teeth with bleeding black gums. As he moves, his bare feet make no sound when they hit the ground. He operates in total silence. 

The reason he’s called Mr. Sparks, though, is because instead of fingers, he has sparklers. Yes, the handheld fireworks so many love to light on celebrations. His favorite way to introduce himself to a victim is to, from a distance, show off the long, dancing silver lights of fire that protrude from his knuckles in lieu of long boney fingers. Sometimes, he even waves during an initial greeting. That’s how he likes to tease his reign of terror on those who have unknowingly called for him. And many call for him. He’s a very busy entity. 

He’s summoned when someone who claims to be a devout believer in Christ acts very Un-Christ-like. He brings light to the dark. Reality to the denier. Truth to the liar.

The summoning doesn’t usually happen due to a single moment. Mr. Sparks isn’t unfair. He studies. He waits to see patterns in people who operate without self-awareness and self-reflection. He’ll only be summoned if a person, without a shadow of a doubt, has chosen to live in utter hypocrisy by continually not practicing what they preach. 

In this case, the clueless hypocrite summons Mr. Sparks. When the hypocrite is alone at dark, Mr. Sparks appears. His sparklers are the first (and sometimes the only) thing his victims see. The sparklers can look like flickering street lamps down the road, or the headlights of a car passing through a window, or stars when you rub your eyes too hard, or even a hallucination. 

Mr. Sparks loves confusing his hypocrites and might even taunt the little humans for a while. At times, he’ll use the light from his sparklers to create shadows along walls so his victims can get a glimpse of his profile. His version of shadow puppets usually gets heartbeats racing. If he’s feeling extra-silly, he’ll show himself to a victim and then let them run away and hide for a bit. The only time anyone ever “gets away” from Mr. Sparks is when he’s in the mood to play. 

When Mr. Sparks isn’t feeling as playful, it’s a much faster experience. Because he runs too fast for human eyes to process, victims during these quicker jobs only get a glimpse of his sparklers. Then, before they know it, they are wrapped in his tight embrace.

I can’t say for sure what happens once Mr. Sparks has a victim in his arms. Mrs. Joy told me that the only ones who truly know are Mr. Sparks and his hypocrites who are sworn to secrecy. But, it’s believed that he transports them to a place that’s worse than any Hell ever before imagined. And that’s where he begins to negotiate terms. 

The story says that if the hypocrites vow to do better and start to practice what they preach, they can return to life as they know it. If they refuse or make a vow and then break their vow, Mr. Sparks lets them live their lives, but they live cursed. Those who continue to show themselves at church and perform as though they are Christ-like while they do not act with morals, compassion, and justice, will have to always look over their shoulders at night. They will forever have to question if the light they see down the hall or across the driveway or next to their bed is Mr. Sparks paying them another visit. And what happens if Mr. Sparks ultimately decides a hypocrite is too-far-gone as a sinner? I have suspicions that those hypocrites end up in a very, very bad place for a very, very long time, where Mr. Sparks is always just around the corner. 

For those wondering what happened to the awful lady at the restaurant, Mrs. Joy saw her that following Sunday at church like usual. But, Mrs. Joy said the lady was acting quite unusual. She was being considerate. And helpful! She even offered to volunteer at the upcoming food drive. Mrs. Joy said it seemed as though the lady had recently had some kind of rebirth, as if sparks of truth and righteousness had ignited a new sense of humanity inside of her.
