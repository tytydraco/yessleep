I cursed myself for having always taken the elevators as I struggled up the center stairwell. Luckily, there was the constant ringing in my ears from the fire alarm to drown out my heavy breathing and the pounding in my chest, as I climbed ever higher. "Damn these safety protocols," I mumbled to myself, whose idea was it anyway to have elevators shut down in the midst of an emergency. "Emergency, my ass!" There's no one up there, I all but knew, as the voice over the intercom continued to belt out, repeatedly, "Code Red, Pull Station Activated, 8th Floor, PEDS Unit."

The PEDS unit, or Pediatrics, as known to most, had been abandoned for over a decade, left to rot in the memory of what had happened there. Closed out of respect, or lack of funding, or an abundance of superstition. I didn't know, for sure. And didn't much care. All that currently mattered to me, Security Officer #25, was that I was now coming up on the 6th floor level, and I was almost there. And thank God, I could reset the faulty God forsaken pull station, the fire department would come, do their investigation, and I could go back to my midnight lunch that was getting cold.

But just then, I heard something.

What was that?

A familiar, and yet at the same time, foreign sound. Out of place, somehow. Like a knocking, but not. I slowed my ascension, stopped to listen, attempted to direct my hearing upward and disregard the echoes of voices and confusion from below. The sound was getting closer. Just above me now, speeding up and becoming more erratic, as the unknown pinging descended the stairs. There it was, a ball. Red. Making its way towards me, losing momentum, barely rolling now down each step.

Immediately, my mind went to that which I had ignored over the years of patrolling the unused and empty, tomb-like halls of the PEDS unit. Stories of events, of reports of, and I dare use the word, hauntings, on the 8th floor of Mercy Health. There had been, reportedly, sightings of a little girl, which the 'powers that be' at Mercy had dismissed and chalked up to overworked and sleep deprived nursing staff. I had, in the past, had no real choice in dismissing the matter myself, for if I was gonna believe that nonsense, it would have interfered with my willingness to walk those dark halls at night. Alone. Especially, alone, as I was now, catching the ball in my hand and feeling the realness of it hit home.

"Is there anybody up there?" I cried, "Hello."

No answer.

Inching further up the stairwell, ball in hand, I could now see the door to the 8th floor. Funny thing, I couldn't recall ever actually seeing this door before, having only been to the 8th floor via my elevator security clearance. Yet somehow, I remembered it... The heat of the door handle, the odd flashing of the badge reader. Had I dreamed of it? Was I dreaming now, I questioned, as I edged through the door, slowly.

The thickness, the oppression of the air , as I closed the door behind me and stepped onto the children's unit, told me otherwise.

Fighting my urge to turn tail and run, I pushed forward. Led only by my flashlight, searching the shadows for the faulty pull station. I was hot, so hot. It had to be my imagination running away itself. Afterall, the HVAC system, one of the only things still working on this floor, was providing its familiar, low grade hum , pushing out its cool, 68Â° air. But still. It was hot. So, incredibly and unnaturally, hot. In all the ghost stories, weren't people colder? Wasn't there a chill in the air?

Jesus!!!

As if awoken from a reverie, startled, and jolted back to my senses like I had been asleep for days, I just stood there paralyzed as the tiny thing in the corner began to raise and stand upright. It had been there. I had seen it upon entering the room. Huddled in the corner, looking like nothing more than an old pile of clothes and blankets. It was coming towards me, slower at first, but faster now.

Oh, God!!!

I dropped the ball and the flashlight, losing control of my bodily functions, I was completely at the mercy of this thing that floated up to greet me. Mercy Health, I thought, please. Mercy. As the thing opened its gaping mouth, further and further it seemed, until the whole monstrous entity turned in on itself and all that was left was an overwhelming heat that seeped inside me, filling up my lungs with the taste of sulfur and ash. "Please, it wasn't me! I would've found you."

That was several days ago. Apparently, my then, lifeless body, had been found by a couple of fire fighters. And although I didn't regain full consciousness until yesterday, their life saving measures had, obviously, and regretfully, been successful. I say "regretfully," because now I'm stuck in this dreaded hospital bed with only the memories of that awful thing in my head to keep me company.

I can't leave. I can't!!

The doctors won't discharge me and if I leave AMA (Against Medical Advice), I would forfeit any Workmans comp that I might qualify for and, even worse, insurance coverage. Ugh. I suffered a cracked sternum from the damned chest compressions during my resuscitation process and I'm still recovering from extreme smoke inhalation.

Although, reportedly, there was no fire.

However, I was told that the fire alarm on the PEDS unit had, in fact, been pulled. By who, or what, has, officially, yet to be determined. But I know who it was. It was that little girl. Francis, I believe was her name.

Ten years ago, during a fire on the PEDS unit, she had somehow been forgotten in the panic. Lost in the fray. They say another security officer, at the time, had found her, huddled in the corner under a clump of blankets, still clutching her little red ball. But it was too late. She was dead.

And now I'm trapped here, with an oxygen tube up my nose and a throat so swollen from her smoke that I can barely eat, much less talk. And if I could talk, what would I say?? I've already met with Risk Management and am now awaiting a psych consult regarding the incident. I can't tell them!!! I just can't. They'll think I'm crazy. And the last thing I need is to be admitted to the Behavioral Health unit.

I have to get out of here!!! Oh God, why didn't they just let me die up there?
