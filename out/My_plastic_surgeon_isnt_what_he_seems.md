Rhinoplasty: A Short Horror Story

Warning >!Body Horror!<

If there was one thing the Moore’s were famous, or rather infamous for, it would be their noses. They were long and sharp, aquiline in shape, and hooked like the beak of an eagle. There was no denying Moore noses were attention seekers: they flared themselves and their big, boisterous selves for people to see.

Candace’s nose was a great example of that fact. Ever since she had taken a baseball to the face in 5th grade, what had previously been an embarrassment of a nose had become something truly monstrous. Looking at the mirror, she could tell how it twisted and turned in the most unnatural ways, making her most beautiful features become lost in the cacophony that was her face. Even her eyes, which were a majestic shade of golden honey, were overshadowed by her ugly nose.

As she drew closer to the mirror, Candace took her hands and attempted to even out the crooks in her nose. Pulling here and pushing there, she could almost imagine how her nose would look if it were normal. Perfectly straight at the bridge, nostrils tucked in and out of sight, even with her hands covering most of her face, it was beautiful. Candace gingerly smiled at herself in the mirror, breathing out of her mouth while she kept a tight grip on her nose.

“Hurry it up! I need to pee!” A muffled voice came from the other side of the bathroom door, accompanied by such loud and aggressive pounding that Candance could feel the abrupt vibrations through the fabric of her socks.

With an annoyed grunt, Candance quickly gathered her phone and belongings. As she was about to leave, she took one last look at the mirror, but the only thing she could see was the ugly outline of her nose. A dark, grimy feeling stuck itself to her chest as she once scrutinized the nose she had been cursed with, cheeks pinched with disgust. Anger bubbled up in her core as she slammed the bathroom door open, catching her sister straight in the face. Serves her right, something in the back of Candace’s mind whispered. Like the brat her sister was, she immediately crumpled to the ground as she cradled her face and screamed in a pitch so high Candace could feel her eardrums strain painfully against it. A silent curse escaped Candace’s lips as she looked down the hallway, a soft sigh escaping through her teeth as she confirmed it to be empty. Not wasting any time, she slipped around her still crying sister with little difficulty and headed straight for the garage, opting for a quick escape over having something for breakfast. 

Candance anxiously waited on her bike for the garage door to open, biting at her fingernails mindlessly as a way to calm her anxious heart. Like ice pouring down her back, a ball of fear stuck itself squarely at the back of Candace’s throat as she heard the distant sound of angry stomping from beyond the garage entrance, rapidly coming closer. Not bothering to wait any longer, Candance squeezed herself between the still rising garage door and the cool cement floor, scraping her bike across the space behind her.

“You jerk!” She heard her sister say in a voice croaky from tears, “If there was anything uglier than your personality it’d have to be your nose!”

Like always, the words sunk deep into her guts, feeding a guttural fire in her abdomen made of jealousy and hatred toward her sister. What did she know, with her pretty face and perfectly straight nose. Next time she’d make sure to slam the door harder, see if a deformed nose just like hers would finally put her sister in her place. Before the garage door had a chance to lift into its fully open position, Candance hopped on her bike and pedaled away, leaving her sister to her own devices.

The ride to school was as uneventful as it could be. She whizzed past the classic suburban estates as she pedaled through the sleepy streets. Some of her neighbors were just waking up, while others had been long gone before the sun rose.

Entering her school was no less monotonous. It was the same old routine every single day. Go to her locker, get her books, check her makeup, tolerate Britney Kingston. Tolerating Britney Kingston was by far the least unenjoyable of those.

The snake that attended her school, also known as Britney Kingston, was a doll faced freshman who had the personality of a squid and the sincerity of a car salesman. Every morning Britney would get to school perfectly early and walk down the halls like she owned them, waving to and greeting everyone with that stupid smirk of hers. Despite being a grade below Candace, Britney easily bested her in virtually anything. Whether it was math, english, science, PE, or art, Britney was always the best.

Everything about Briney annoyed her to hell and back. However, what irked her the most was her face. Her skin was rosy and soft, seemingly made of porcelain. Her hair was always in place and perfectly fluffy. Her eyes were big and blue, like the vast expanse of the ocean meeting the cerulean sky. Her nose, simply put, was elegant. The bridge of it held no bumps or ridges, and the end delicately curved inward where it met her upper lip. Britney’s nostrils were small and quiet, tucked safely away and framing her face in the most flattering way possible. Britney Kingston was everything Candace Moore had failed to be. 

The day grudged on like molasses, slow and unchanging. By the time lunch came around, Candace was a mummy, dragging herself through the bustling halls of her school towards the promise of food. As always, the lunch room was filled with energy and excited chatter.

Lazily flopping herself down on her seat, Candace wordlessly unpacked her lunch as she waited for her friends to arrive. She held the cool zipper of her lunchbox between her digits as she pulled the seams apart, unveiling a meal that would quiet her ravenous stomach. It had been complaining all morning, especially due to her lack of a breakfast, leaving her red faced whenever it grumbled loudly. Candace’s mouth watered as she reached into her bag for her lunch, opening her sandwich container in a daze of uncontrollable hunger, only to find it disappointingly empty. Right, in the frenzy this morning, she had left her specialty tuna sandwich on the kitchen counter. Candace clutched a hand to her stomach as it once again spoke up, this time accompanied by a painful jabbing sensation. Perhaps it was for the best, since she did need to lose a couple pounds. Annoyed, Candance rested her head on her hand, absentmindedly by observing the lunchroom through her half lidded eyes. That’s when she caught onto a stray conversation from the next table over.

“Did you hear? They’re saying PBJ got plastic surgery for her dry skin,” a short, freckled faced girl gossiped. Her name definitely started with an S, but Candace couldn’t remember, or care for that matter.

Alex, a lanky teen with comically big glasses, sat down opposite of the girl, “The singer? Didn’t she have a skin condition though? Can you even get surgery for that?”

“I heard she got it from this guy called Dr. Paine. He’s been all over the news lately,” another girl joined in. She had bright, ginger hair that constantly tangled into a mess of frizz. “I even heard my mom talking about it. She’s been saving up for a tummy tuck.”

Candace began to tune out of the conversation as she caught sight of her friends, who were approaching her table from the lunch line, waving at her excitedly. Out of the corner of her eye, she also saw Britney, who was walking by the lunch tables, making small talk with other students. Like Candace gave a crap what the snake did. Everything Britney did was for some ulterior motive. Regardless, Candace kept listening to the neighboring table.

“Hey Britney!” Called Samantha? Sally? Candace swore it started with an S.

“Jane! Hi! How have you been, girl?” …So maybe it didn’t start with an S.

“I’ve been great. Actually, we were just talking about PBJ’s new surgery. Her face looks so smooth now right?”

“Yeah! I was really surprised when I saw her new music video. Her skin definitely looks a lot better.”

“Actually, I heard Dr. Paine did her surgery. Didn’t he also do your sister’s rhinoplasty?”

Britney had a sister who got a rhinoplasty? That was news to her.

“Yeah. Sis wanted a nose job for her birthday and Paine apparently had the best prices.”

Good prices? Candace had always assumed that only celebrities could afford nose jobs. However, if Britney’s sister had gotten a rhinoplasty, then that meant it had to be affordable on some level. Candace took one last look behind her shoulder at the neighboring table before leaving the conversation at that. Her curiosity had quenched her hunger; she needed to know more.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The next two periods of school consisted of careful observation. Keeping her eyes low, Candace burned holes into the back of Britney’s skull from the intensity of her gaze. It was only a matter of time before Britney left for her bathroom break. She always went in the afternoon, presumably to check her makeup and comb through her hair. While on most days she found it annoying, today she couldn’t afford to miss this bathroom trip. As soon as Britney left, Candace was prepared to go right on after her. She needed to find out more on Dr. Paine.

Candace soon found the opportunity during the last half fifth period, when Britney finally stood up from her desk and quietly left the classroom. Wasting no time, she briskly excused herself to the restroom as well, speed walking down the hallways. Pulling the bathroom door open, she quickly spotted Britney near the bathroom mirrors as she reapplied mascara. Britney’s eyes rolled back while the brush swam through her eyelashes, pulling her eyelids up and leaving small clumps of mascara across her lashes. The school bathrooms were small, the building having been built in the 60s, and only three lonely stalls occupied the back wall of the restrooms. All three were empty.

Pushing the door closed with her back, Candace licked her dry lips as she prepared to speak with the jerk.

“I heard your sister got a rhinoplasty.”

Candace’s voice cut through the quiet like a knife through butter, the abruptness of the action making Britney flinch. She was surprised to notice a tiny smear of mascara on Britney’s upper eyelid, making Candace feel giddy to her core at seeing an imperfection so clearly displayed on Britney’s face.

“Do you need anything?”

“Who was the doctor?” Candace pushed, “Where is his clinic? What are his prices?”

“You mean Dr. Dorian Paine? He works in the next city over,” Britney answered doubtfully, “Why do you ask?”

She didn’t understand why that particular question made her blood boil. Here Candace was, having to live an ugly life with an ugly nose. Having to endure the cold, hard glares of others all day long, who judged her from afar when they thought she wasn’t looking. Britney would never understand. Britney got to live a life of commodity and effortless beauty, never thinking of the struggles of those below her. Britney would never understand someone like Candace, who would do just about anything to fix her monster of a nose. It wasn’t fair. Britney deserved to suffer everything Candace did and more.

Deep within her core, a familiar nasty feeling clawed its way into Candace’s throat, evolving into words as they squeezed from her lips and spilled out into the atmosphere of the school restroom.

“Really Britney? Now I know why they say you’re a dumb blonde. Are you blind? Have you looked in a mirror during the last five years?”

As the poison of her words penetrated the air, Candace shot Britney a wicked grin, keeping her feet firmly on the ground as an anchor between herself and the door. She would not allow anyone to walk into this conversation.

“What do you mean by that?” Britney asked defensively.

“Or maybe it’s that after your sister got her nose job, your family was just too poor to afford you one as well. We all talk about it, you know? Your nostrils are so wide you could fit an elephant in each one!”

Britney began to curl into herself, eyes blown wide open. Her lower lip quivered under the pressure in the room, and her knees buckled from the weight of Candace’s words.

Candance continued, “Here you go walking around the school, thinking you’re so pretty and so nice. You want to know the truth? You are a sewer rat, Britney. If only you could also get surgery for your rotten personality, but even Dr. Paine can’t perform miracles.”

Hot, ugly tears streamed down Britney’s face as she pushed Candace aside and thrust the bathroom door open. That sick, grimy feeling that had been dwelling in Candace’s chest for months was finally gone, leaving a hole in her core where only the faint inklings of regret and guilt resided. Deciding it was better to avoid Britney for now, Candace strolled on over to the bathroom mirror and touched up her own makeup, purposely avoiding her own nose in the reflection. With a last look over, Candace left the bathroom just in time for the bell to ring, signaling the end of the school day.

The next town over? Candace had her work cut out for her tonight.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

After the encounter with Britney at school, Candace went straight to her house. She opened the front door to an empty living room strewn with wayward papers and coat hangers, evidence of the prior morning rush. Making her way to the kitchen revealed a similar mess, in the middle of which innocently lay her tuna sandwich, enticing her to come closer. However, she had no time to waste, needing to take advantage of the empty household. Choosing to ignore the sandwich for now, Candace sprinted out the back door and into the storage shed. If she remembered correctly, her parents kept their emergency fund under one of the shed floorboards. Finding the safe proved to be a problem, especially since most of the shed floor was loosely put together, meaning there were plenty of floorboards to look under. The sun had started to go down by the time she found the box, tucked safely away under a panel behind an old bookshelf. The next problem was the padlock on it. The metal was thick, and regular wire cutters would hardly do anything to it. She resigned to taking the box with her, planning to stop by a hardware store for better tools later. As Candace snuck out of the shed, she heard muffled voices from behind the back door, making her freeze in her tracks.

“Did you check the basement?” A deep, gruff voice questioned. It was her mom’s husband.

Another, more feminine voice answered, “She’s not there. Should we call the police? Candace is usually home by now.”

Candace slowly peaked her eyes through the living room window, keeping a low stance to avoid drawing attention. From what she could see behind the blinds, it appeared that two figures were conversing with each other. One was anxiously pacing around the room, while the other was sitting down on the sofa, arms laid on the backrest. It was her parents.

“You don’t think she ran away, right?” The female voice asked tentatively, almost as if she was afraid of the question itself, “She hit her sister this morning, but Candace knows better than to run away for something like that…”

The deeper voice intervened, “It isn’t that she knows better, the problem is that she thinks she knows so much. The brat knew she’d get punished for hitting her sister and is probably planning on camping it out at a friend’s house. But to me, it doesn't matter if she comes back today or in a week. I’ll be punishing her until she apologizes to my daughter.”

Having heard every word, angry tears pricked at the corners of Candace’s eyes, which she quickly swept up with the back of her hand. She slowly backed away from the window, hands shaking with the onslaught of emotion. Channeling that energy into her sprint, Candace pumped the powerful muscles in her legs as she ran down her neighborhood sidewalks, safe gripped tightly in her arms. Any last doubts left Candace in that moment: she would get that surgery, or she would die trying.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It had been one of the longest nights of her life. Most of the evening had been spent getting the safe open. When she finally did so, stashing the couple thousand dollars in her purse, it was already nighttime. By the time she got to the bus station, it was close to midnight, and sleep hung heavily on her eyes. The bus ride took a couple of hours, and Candace spent at least another two trying to find Dr. Paine’s clinic. Now she stood in front of the building, fingers numb and teeth chattering from the cold morning air. The clinic itself wasn’t that impressive, largely overshadowed by the hospital next door. Nevertheless, it was very well kept, which was apparent even from the outside due to the gorgeous landscaping and cleanliness of the estate. Inside the institution, the interior design was a mix between modern and minimalistic, promoting an overall welcoming aura to the place.

Immediately upon entry, Candace was greeted by a happy secretary, who escorted her into an empty waiting room along with some paperwork. She was surprised by the ease of it all, but even as she filled in the paperwork she feared getting turned away for being a minor. Just as a precaution, she lied about her age on the forms.

Candace felt nothing while she paid for the surgery using her parent’s money, placing the funds in an envelope with the rest of the paperwork. The secretary eagerly took the documents when she finished, flashing her a polite smile, “Dr. Dorian Paine will be right with you, dear. Please excuse me while I get your information into the system.”

Seconds turned into minutes as Candace impatiently waited for the doctor to arrive. This was it. After sixteen years of having an ugly nose, she’d finally be like everyone else. Candace Moore would finally be perfect. She had tapped, twiddled, drummed, and even bit her fingers before the far door of the waiting room was opened.

On the other side of the door was a middle aged man. He was tall and well built, displaying perfect posture while portraying a stance that radiated confidence. He wore a white coat with a casual suit underneath, his graying hair expertly combed back in a style that was both professional and flattering for his face.

“Candace Moore, yes?” The doctor questioned, eyes crinkling as his lips stretched into a smile, unveiling the pearly whites underneath. 

“Yes sir. It’s a pleasure to meet you.”

The doctor approached her, and suddenly the once confident figure loomed almost menacingly above her head. His outstretched hand clasped onto her’s forcefully, pulling her ever so slightly closer to him. The emptiness in the room now felt suffocating.

“What pretty eyes you have there, young girl. I don’t think I’ve ever seen such an intriguing shade before.”

Dread coursed down her spine, traveling like lightning down each nerve and into her limbs as it ignited a fire within her very flesh. The doctor’s hands were rough compared to her own, clearly worn by the years, and pulsated warmth into Candace’s sweaty palms. Suddenly, as if nothing had happened, the doctor let go, going back to his professional persona. Yet this time, a nasty kind of grin stuck itself to his face, leaving Candace with the impression that she had walked into something much more sinister than the lion’s den.

“You said you wanted a rhinoplasty, correct? I have just the thing for you.”

As he said that, Candace heard the ventilation system turn on. Within seconds, her eyes began to droop with exhaustion and her limbs increased in weight tenfold. Through her rapidly blurring vision Candace saw what looked like Paine as he equipped a gas mask. However, the implications of the situation were hopelessly lost to the jumble that quickly became of Candace’s thoughts. Soon enough she felt as her body free fell into the icy clinic floor, now at the mercy of her malefactors.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Consciousness came to Candace like the tide of the sea, ebbing in and out in like waves, but always out of reach. The first thing she registered was the feel of the dull, stone floor under her hands. It was clearly dirty, as the grains of dirt stuck to her palms and mixed with her sweat to create a muddy sort of liquid. As she struggled to open her eyes, the next thing she noticed were the fearful whispers that echoed in the air all around her. They were too low to fully discern, so Candace focused her attention on getting her eyes to open. Once she finally got them to cooperate, squinting her eyes at the sight in front of her, Candace was welcomed by the four corners of a dark room. There was nothing to see by save for a sliver of light that escaped from the space between what she assumed was the door and the floor. Not that she could see either of them.

“Hello?”, Candace croaked softly, directing her inquiry towards the voices around her.

She got her answer from a voice to her left, “You’re awake. How are you feeling?”

“A little dizzy,” Candace replied, voice still shaky, “Where are we?”

This time a young, but clearly masculine voice answered her, “Underneath the Paine clinic.”

A third, raspy voice continued, “We all came to the clinic from some kind of surgery, but none of us have gotten out since…”

The reality of it finally struck. This was it. This was the end. It didn’t matter if she had a big nose. It didn’t matter that her parent’s loved her sister more than they did her. It didn’t matter that she’d never live to be as beautiful or as nice or as perfect as Britney. None of that mattered because she was gonna die here. She had read about these things. If she was lucky, then she’d be put to sleep as her organs were cut out of her and shipped to the black market.

It could have been minutes or hours that transpired between Candace’s ugly sobs, filling the silence of the room with a song of raw regret and utter desperation. Through this display of sudden vulnerability, there was one recurring topic in Candace’s mind: Britney Kingston.

“Britney…!” Candace cried between her endless sobs.

Candace Moore was not a good person. She was selfish by nature. She lived and breathed her lies. Yet, in the life that Candace Moore had lived, never had she meant anything with more intent, never had she been so honest. The next sentence she uttered was truly the biggest paradox in the life of Candace Moore.

“Britney! I’M SORRY!”

Candace was drowning in her tears. Drowning in the shame and guilt she felt. She was truly the scum of the Earth. Suddenly, she felt the weight of a hand on her shoulder, and what seemed to be the voice of an angel whispered in her ear.

“I forgive you.”

…

Britney was here.

At that moment, the door to the room was pushed open, leaving Candace’s eyes in a flash of pain from the change in lighting. The figure behind the action was Dr. Paine himself, still looking as professional as ever.

“That’s wonderful!” He said, looking between the two girls, “Did you know Britney also stopped by this morning for a rhinoplasty?”

What?

In the now normal lighting, Candace could see the people she’d been sharing the room with. Their faces were the fuel of nightmares. Surgeries gone wrong. Some had facial muscles that were pulled back, eyes bulging out of their sockets from the tension of the flesh on their faces. Others had skin hanging limply around their cheeks where it had been harvested, exposing the bloody, living tissue underneath. Several people had their mouths sewn shut, stitched into permanent smiles so tight that the skin was torn raw at the ends. Candace vomited from the sight alone, and when she looked up, she met Britney’s face, staring deep into her empty eye sockets and wide, stitched smile. These people weren’t human anymore.

“We’re running on a tight schedule here,” Paine teased, tapping on his watch to emphasize his point.

“Now then, Candace. Shall we start with your eyes?”
