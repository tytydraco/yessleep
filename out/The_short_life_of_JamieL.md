The life of Jamie, lee was short and unremarkable.
Nobody really knew him. He moved too much.
Only his parents — who were dead now — had ever really known him.

After their deaths, Jamie was sent to Washington County, Georgia, to live with his grandmother. She would take care of him — at least until she died, too.

As the car pulled into the gravel driveway, Jamie saw her:
A girl in a bright red dress standing in the field next door.

The skirt clung tightly to her torso for six inches, then flared stiffly outward, almost like it was made of metal. Her red leather jacket gleamed in the sunlight. A slip of paper stuck out from the chest pocket.

Jamie stared at her, his pulse racing.

“Jamie,” his grandmother called sharply, as though she had said it a hundred times.
He snapped his head toward her — then back to the field.
The girl was gone.

“I’ll take your bags,” his grandmother said.
Jamie had only one: a medium-sized duffel bag. After the tenth move, you learn to travel light.

That night, Jamie slept in the room that used to belong to his grandfather.
He dreamed, like always, of the beach trip he’d taken with his parents a year ago:
A picnic basket, gulls attacking a bag of Lay’s potato chips, warm sand.
But this time, the dream was different.

The girl was there, standing far away on a sand dune, watching him.

Jamie woke up tangled in his sheets, his mouth tasting foul — not the normal morning breath. Something darker.

It was his first day at Washington Junior High.
He struggled to find his classes.
He spoke to no one — maybe he asked where the bathroom was, but he wasn’t even sure.
When he got home, he ate a silent dinner, went to bed, and dreamed again.
The girl was still there, standing silently on the dunes.

The next day was the same: silent breakfast, silent halls.
Until math class.

At the back of the room, he saw her again.
She sat at a three-person desk with two other girls:
One brunette in a lime green outfit, the other in a bright yellow dress.

They passed a note between them, scribbling something and giggling without making a sound.

Jamie went home, ate another silent dinner, and went to bed.

That night, his dream changed again.

He was standing alone in the main hall of his school.
The lights were off. The world felt cold and empty.
Until the three girls appeared — rounding the corner, walking slowly toward him.

The girl in red smiled when she saw him.

“Hi there,” she said, stepping closer.
“I’ve been seeing you a lot lately.”

Jamie turned to look behind him — but somehow, the other two girls were already there, standing silently.

“Come with me,” the girl in red said.
Jamie tried to respond, but only a breathy, strangled sound escaped his throat.

She grabbed his collar and pulled him into the restroom.
She sat him down in a stall.

“Jamie,” she whispered.

He tried to ask, How do you know my name?, but his throat closed up, choking the words.
He could only gasp.

“How could I not know you, Jamie?” she said.
“I’ve been waiting for you.”

His alarm clock jerked him awake, the loud buzzing in his ears.
Silent breakfast. Another day at school.

In math class, he saw them again — passing notes, smiling like nothing was wrong.

Jamie asked to use the restroom.
He walked out behind the three girls.

The girl in red stopped and grabbed his collar — just like in the dream.

“Jamie,” she whispered, her voice sharp and cold.

He yanked away, heart pounding, and rushed to the restroom.
He stumbled toward a stall — then the pain hit.

It started in his chest, a ripping, searing agony, like his body was being pulled apart from the inside.
His organs twisted, shifting upward inside his body.
He collapsed against the toilet, gasping for breath.

Blood sprayed violently from his mouth, bursting out with such force that it splattered the stall walls.
The three girls were standing around him, watching, unblinking. Silent.
The girl in red handed him the note they’d been passing.

Jamie’s hands shook as he unfolded it.
The paper was thin, crinkled from constant folding.

It was just his name.
Written over
and over
and over
and over
until the ink had bled into one dark, messy blotch.
The letters were twisted and distorted, the words no longer readable.

Jamie dropped the paper.
Then he dropped to the ground.
Dead.

The life of first name Lillian last name brown was short and unremarkable.
