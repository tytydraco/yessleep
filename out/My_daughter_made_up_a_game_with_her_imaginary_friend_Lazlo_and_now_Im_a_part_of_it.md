I don’t know if this is the right place to post this. I don’t even know if I believe myself anymore.

But every time I’ve tried to tell someone in real life what’s been happening, I get that look. The polite nod. The slow backing away. The “maybe you should talk to someone” voice.

So here I am. On r/nosleep. Because if there’s anywhere a story like mine won’t sound completely insane, it’s here.
I’m a single father. My daughter, Keily, just turned six last month. 

Her mom passed when Keily was three, and since then it’s just been the two of us in a small rental house on the edge of town. Quiet neighborhood. Old trees. Lots of wind at night.

It started the way these things always do, I guess.
With an imaginary friend.
“Daddy,” she said one afternoon while I was making mac and cheese, “Lazlo says he likes your house.”
I smiled without turning around. “That so?”

“Yeah. He says it’s old. Old houses are easier.”
“Easier for what?” I asked, half-laughing.
She shrugged. “To get in.”
Kids say weird stuff. I didn’t think anything of it.

Lazlo became a daily presence after that. She’d save him a seat at the table. Argue with him over cartoons. Blame him when her crayons went missing. I even asked her once where Lazlo lived.

“In the walls,” she said immediately. “But sometimes in the mirrors.”

That should’ve been my first red flag.
At first, I assumed Lazlo was another kid from school. I asked what he looked like.
“He looks like me,” she said. “But sadder.”
Then one Saturday morning, she asked if Lazlo could come over.

I figured this was the moment where imagination met reality and I’d have to explain things gently. Still, I played along.
“Sure,” I said. “Tell him he’s welcome.”
She ran to the front door, threw it open, and wrapped her arms around absolutely nothing.

She laughed. Hugged tighter. Even said, “You’re cold.”
That was the moment I realized Lazlo wasn’t real.
Or at least… not real in the way I understood.

After that, things shifted. Keily stopped sleeping through the night. I’d hear her whispering in her room long after bedtime. Sometimes laughing. Sometimes crying.
Once, I checked on her and found her standing in front of her closet, door open, just staring inside.

“What are you doing?” I asked.
“Playing,” she said softly.
“With Lazlo?”
She nodded. “He says you don’t know the rules yet.”

That night, I dreamed of knocking from inside the walls.
Over the next few weeks, small things started happening. Cabinet doors left open. Footsteps upstairs when Keily was asleep beside me on the couch. The bathroom mirror fogged up once while I was brushing my teeth, even though no one had showered.

Words appeared in the steam.

DON’T LOOK TOO LONG.

I wiped them away with my sleeve and told myself I was exhausted. Grief does things to people. Stress. Imagination.
I held onto that explanation like a lifeline.
Until the night I woke up thirsty.

It was 1:30 a.m. I remember because I checked my phone. The house was silent, the kind of quiet that presses against your ears. I was halfway down the hall to the kitchen when I heard it.

Crying.
Not quiet crying. Not sniffling. Full, hysterical sobbing.
From Keily’s room.
I ran.

Her bedroom door was open, the light off. The sound was coming from her wardrobe. I yanked it open, heart pounding
and she burst out like a trapped animal.
She slammed into me, screaming, arms wrapped around my neck. I nearly fell over.
“He made me play it!” she sobbed. “I didn’t want to! I didn’t want to!”

I carried her to the bed and held her until she could breathe again.
“Who made you play what?” I asked.
“Lazlo,” she whispered. “He made a game.”

I was angry then. Angry in that helpless, boiling way parents get when something scares their kid and you don’t know how to fix it.

“Keily,” I said firmly, “Lazlo isn’t real. He can’t make you do anything.”
She pulled back and looked at me like I was the child.

“Yes he is,” she said. “And now you’re part of it too.”
Then she told me the rules.

1. This is a survivor game. Do not try to attack the spirits. If you do, you already lost.
2. Don’t go near any windows or mirrors at nighttime.
3. If the spirits manage to catch you, you have one chance to survive. Throw salt on them.
4. If you know all four rules, you’re officially part of the game.
She swallowed hard before continuing.

“You can’t quit. The game never ends. If you see faces in windows or mirrors, you may already have lost. If they smile at you, your time is up. If they look sad, you have ten minutes to escape the country. To win… you have to tell more people the rules. More people than the person who told you. Lazlo says… hope you enjoy the Spirit Game.”

I didn’t sleep after that.
Keily refused to be alone, so I let her sleep in my bed. She clutched my shirt all night like she thought I might disappear.
Sometime around 3 a.m., I noticed the window.

The curtains were parted just slightly. I don’t remember leaving them that way.
Behind the glass, reflected faintly by the streetlight outside, was a face.

Not smiling.
Not angry.
Just… sad.

I squeezed my eyes shut and stayed perfectly still. Ten minutes. That’s what she said. Ten minutes to escape the country.
I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. I counted seconds in my head until my thoughts blurred together.

When I looked again, the reflection was gone.
The next morning, Keily didn’t remember telling me the rules.
But I did.

And now things follow me.
I see faces in dark TV screens. In the microwave door. In the black glass of my phone when it’s turned off. Sometimes they smile. Sometimes they don’t.

Salt lines every windowsill in my house. I carry packets in my pockets like charms. Keily doesn’t talk to Lazlo anymore.
Lazlo talks to me.
In reflections. In dreams. In the quiet moments when I’m about to fall asleep.
He keeps reminding me of the rules. Especially the last one.

I remember 1 time especially. It was a Sunday afternoon. Keily somehow managed to go to sleep. And i sat up in the livingroom. Lights on and all windows covered.

I hadn’t slept for 5 days. The doctor kept telling me to sleep, otherwise i would start having vivie hallucinations or sleep paralysis.

Thats when something weird happened. I think the time was 4am when i noticed that i had missed to cover one window. I looked into it and saw a face. My heart stopped, this was real. No denying that.
The face was smiling. 

A smile so weirdly evil that my skin froze. I remembered the rules and i started crying. I knew that my time was up. Lazlo would take me. And i could do absolutly nothing about it.

Then i remembered. The salt! I ran into the kitchen like my life was about to be taken. I grabbed the salt just in time to see the long pale white hand streching out from the windows to claw out my eyes. I threw salt all over them.

Screetching noises was heard from the windows. Smoke filled my livingroom and kitchen. I breathed out in relief. Knowing i survived. But by somr reason it felt weird.
I ran over to Keily’s room and slammed the door open. On her bed i saw… Something. It was a creature about as tall as the room, crouching over her on the bed. She was quiet, sitting incredibly still infront of it.
I looked at her, she breathed heavily. Slowly putting a finger to her mouth, hushing me. 

I panicked. Didn’t listen and screamed at the creature to leave my daughter the fuck alone.
It turned it’s face towards me and roared. The sound comming out from it’s mouth was the worst scream i’ve ever heard in my entire life. I started crying, i wasn’t sad. Sure, i was scared, but not scared enough to start crying.

It suddenly lunged at me, i threw the salt in it’s eyes. It screamed and threw itself backwards. It looked at me with red burnt eyes. ”I knew you were a gold human being to join my game” it said. Suddenly completely human sounding.

”I knew you were a survivor, Peter” how the fuck did it know my name?! I looked at it. ”Lazlo? I suppose” it smiled at me. ”Yes. Your daughter always told me how such a great father figure you were. It’s sad to see her go” he said turning to her.

My eyes widened when it suddenly lunged up on the bed and started clawing at her. Blood errupted everywhere as the claws dug deep into her ribs. Blood pooled out of my daughters mouth as she cried a sound of muffled blood. 

When it was done, it bit a giant piece of her ribcage and ate it before turning to me. ”You’r a good man Pete, i’ll see you soon” before he grabbed her wrist and dragged her into the wall with him, leaving me all alone.

Thats it… I never saw my daughter again. But the weird part is, no one recalled or even rembered my daughter after that. When i tried explaining what happened to other people, they just looked at eachother and asked ”You had a daughter?”

I dont know if this creature somehow has the abillity to wipr the memories from all humans bout it’s victims.
But it doesn’t matter. Lazlo has ever since hunted me. I have been near my death multiple times. And now im tired of trying to keep it hidden.

So… yeah. You might be wondering why I’m telling everyone this. Why I’d post it somewhere knowing no one can really help me.

But you already have.
You the ones reading this story right now you already know the four rules. Which means that every single person who’s read this far has officially entered the Spirit Game.

Thank you.

Thank you so fucking much for reading this.

I can finally relax.
I can finally take some time to sleep.
Thank you for taking my place in the game. And I wish you the best of luck, try to tell as many people as you can about the rules.
Otherwise, you’re doomed.

I’m sorry.

But I needed to think about myself right now.
