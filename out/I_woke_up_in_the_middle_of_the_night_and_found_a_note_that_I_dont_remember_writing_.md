The alarm clock hadn't gone off yet when I woke up. he was scheduled to blow the whistle at 7:00, so it was still early and he could sleep a little longer.
I picked up my cell phone, which was on the table next to my bed and noticed that it was 3:45 in the morning. I was surprised, I don't usually wake up in the middle of the night, but I still woke up for no apparent reason. I didn't wake up with any noise or because of a nightmare, yet my sleep wouldn't return. 
Decidedly and without much of a choice, I got out of bed and went towards the hallway that led to the kitchen to drink some coconut water so that, who knows, my sleep would return.
When I got to the kitchen, I grabbed the glass cup, opened the fridge, held the coconut water and poured myself, the sweet and refreshing taste it had offered, in a way, was helping me stay relaxed so I could return to the covers. . However, when I turned towards the counter, I noticed there was a note. I was intrigued, as I didn't remember making any reminders for the next day I would wake up. I would only go to the grocery store on Friday, and it was still Tuesday and I only do grocery shopping reminders on Thursdays.
I walked towards the counter, as soon as I read the note… I froze.

“Don’t go back to your room, wait until he sends THE MESSAGE”

“What the hell does that mean? WHO IS HE?? NO It makes sense, besides, this handwriting is not mine”-I thought-

The text seemed more like a hotel service notice for a guest than something I would write down and leave on the counter. 

Then, I found myself with a conflicting thought: “Why shouldn’t I go back?”

I was trying to understand what I had just read and wondering if it made any sense. Would someone have visited me and forgotten a reminder at my house? 
No, I hadn't invited anyone the day before, I would remember for sure. And it definitely couldn't be Luccas who would have left something in my kitchen. I saw him last Friday and we had gone out together, he didn't even step foot in my house.
I noticed that I had been there for 10 minutes, before my anxiety attack started to spread, I controlled myself, took a deep breath and tried not to freak out, I drank another glass of coconut water. I knew it couldn't be anything more.

“I had probably written this note, maybe I was writing down a line from a character in the book that I was writing at the time and I ended up writing it down so I wouldn't forget, maybe I wrote the note at a time when I was sleepy and that would explain my handwriting unrecognizable on the ticket” -I thought.-

When I calmed down, I slowly went towards the hallway, walking and trying only to find my pillow. Until, suddenly, my alarm clock in my room rang, it was the 4:00 alarm that always went off to remind me to take my anxiety medication.
I was scared at the time, but the scare that would follow would be much worse.

Less than 10 seconds after hearing the 4 o'clock alarm go off... I heard it being unmuted... by someone who wasn't me. I started to shake, panicking. Scared, I quickly returned to the kitchen and opened my cell phone to call the police. And then I received an anonymous email. 

[DO NOT MAKE ANY NOISE. DO NOT GO BACK TO YOUR ROOM AND WAIT FOR DAWN. If you disobey this WARNING, YOU WILL ACTIVATE A SESSION, AND YOU WILL HAVE TO IDENTIFY ALL ANOMALIES EACH TIME YOU OPEN THE DOOR]

I couldn't take it anymore, what the fuck was that email I had just received?
When I tried to contact the police, they said they were unavailable, even with internet. Nothing worked.
I needed to act rationally and calm down. In an attempt to ensure that there was nothing in my room without necessarily entering it, I ran the house's camera phone app to check if anything was on the cameras... Nothing. Even though there were no lights on in the rooms, it was possible to see the images from the cameras using the night vision option. I didn't find anything in the living room, when I looked into the bathroom, there was nothing either, much less in the damn kitchen where I was. And then, with great trepidation, I went to check the room on the cameras... and to my surprise, there was nothing, but there was a notification from said room on the app. When I pressed it, I saw that it was a section of recording from the last 3 hours of that day, setting it at 1.5x speed. I saw him and froze.
In the recording, there was a silhouette of someone who was wearing my home clothes. The figure in question then leaves the dark corridor and enters my room. I changed the speed to 1x normal, and noticed that after staring at me for a while, the figure in question stopped and entered my closet that faces my bed.

“SOMEONE IS IN MY FUCKING HOUSE” I screamed to myself in my head 

I needed to do something, I wasn't just scared anymore, I didn't understand a damn thing about what was going on anymore, but I needed to do something and quickly. Firstly, I couldn't turn on the light, otherwise it wouldn't show where I was.  But I also couldn't stand still and do nothing, it was inevitable to show some sign of movement, the most important thing was that the movements were subtle.

There was a lot of confusion, what anomalies? A person in my house? what email was that? what port did the email refer to?

With anxiety taking over, I went to the kitchen, grabbed a knife, holding the knife shaking and heading towards my room, I walked slowly, I needed to understand and defend myself from whoever was there.
Inserting my head little by little in the crack of the door, as I entered fearfully and slowly, more adrenaline took over my body, heavy breathing would arrive in a short time and I needed to be agile when it was time for the individual to appear and for me to defend myself. . As soon as I fully entered the room, I didn't turn on the light right away, an instant image that appeared in front of me didn't let me continue.

What made me freeze was not the fact that the closet door was open, nor the fact that the alarm clock was lying on the floor, much less the fact that there was a strong smell of something rotten in the room. Such details seemed irrelevant when I noticed that the figure wearing my clothes was lying on my bed, standing still, looking up, with an expressionless and pale face. And then I understood. 
The person lying on the bed was… me? 

I was the one lying in bed, I was facing a figure that was exactly like me, the only thing that differentiated myself from the figure that was before me was the fact that the figure was dead.
A walkie talk that was next to the figure's body was emitting a sound, when I focused on understanding the message that was being transmitted, I heard:

—[Session 1/5 started, you have 5 minutes to find them all]
