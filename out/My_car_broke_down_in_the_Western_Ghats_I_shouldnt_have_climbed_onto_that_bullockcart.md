The car slowly shook, making a grinding noise akin to an jet engine taking off. Still nothing. I sighed and threw myself back against the seat. *Just my luck*, I thought, *my first taste of real freedom, and my wings are clipped less than a day in*. I had begged my parents for months to let me drive over to Coimbatore, barely 8 hours away from home, to visit some old friends. But now I was stuck in the middle of nowhere in the hills, and my phone didn't even have reception.

I realised have to get out and walk to find some habitation for help. I didn't relish the prospect of leaving my comfortable car and going outside, where the chilly, howling wind carried with it a light drizzle, enough to chill one to the bone. But I'd have to go soon; else the mist would set in, making it difficult for me to retrace my steps. Even though it was only 8 pm, the narrow hill road was deserted. Just my luck when taking a shortcut off the National Highway. *Maybe I could sleep in the car...*

As I was thinking, I saw a glow of light coming up the road. The glow was unsteady and rocked from side-to-side. Within a minute, I could clearly see the source. It was a wooden cart drawn by a huge buffalo, which was leisurely coming up the hill. Upon the cart was a potbellied middle-aged man with a magnificent moustache, and a young boy. Both of them were dressed in traditional clothes, expect for a beanie on their heads. As the vehicle drew closer, I could see them more clearly. They seemed dejected, for some reason. Well, I wasn't going to question it. I got out of my car and waved them down. The boy nudged his father, who started and hit the buffalo with a light wooden switch while shouting something, and the buffalo happily came to a halt.

"Ay, what happened?" the man asked in a sort of Malayalam garnished with Tamil, the typical dialect of the Western Ghats.

"My car broke down... I was wondering if there is any mechanic nearby," I replied.

Hearing this, the man and the boy suddenly seemed to light up. The boy pulled on the man's lungi and excitedly said something, and the man nodded, pushing him aside and leaning toward me.

"Here there won't be any mechanics. You'll have to go to Kumily town, and that's 20 kilometers away. Now it's too late to travel. I'll tell you what we can do. Leave your car here, and come with us, our village is close by. You stay overnight with us, and tomorrow morning I'll take you to Kumily; I go there every day to sell my goods in the market, anyway."

I weighed my options. The people seemed friendly enough, and the man had a son. Family men are not likely to be criminals. I shrugged and took my backpack from the car, and they helped me onto their cart.  I quickly took a photo of my car, so that I would remember where it was the next day.

"Hey, will there be signal there?" I asked.

"Signal?" the man asked, puzzled by the English word.

I waved my phone in front of him, and he laughed.

"Ah, you're asking if your phone works!" he said cheerily. "No, it wont. Government never bothered setting up those metal towers here. But it's okay, because we never really asked for them. After electric lights, we didn't need any more innovations. Who needs phones, internet and all? Causes more problems than it fixes." So saying, he leaned contentedly on some sacks.

"So you don't contact the outside world at all?" I asked.

"Well, we have one payphone in the village. In case of any emergency where we need outside help. But we've never had to use it. See, our village is small. Maybe 30 families. But we are all one big family. We help each other when in need, and each family does a different thing. My family's job is to go sell our crops and buy supplies when we need them. Because of this, we are also the village heads, and I'm the current headman. Since you're from the city, you won't understand this community sense."

"So other than you, no one goes out of the village?"

"Exactly!" he said, beaming. "Or more accurately, they neither need to, or want to. We're content with our way of life."

I leaned on the wooden railing of the cart. So I'd have to spend the night in a place with no chance of signal, with a bunch of loons who hadn't progressed past the 19th century, and were in all likely heavily inbred. I sighed.

"What did you say your names were?" I asked wearily.

"I'm Venkatayya," said the man, "and this is my son Beerappa."

*Even their names haven't moved on from the 19th century*, I idly thought.

"I'm Ajith," I introduced myself, "thanks so much for picking me up."

"No problem, it's our duty to help everyone in need." said Venkatayya.

"Actually, you came at an auspicious time," he continued, "our festival is happening!"

"Your festival?" I asked.

"Yes. Every year, we have a week-long festival in honour of Ekantapayyan, our village's protector deity. Tomorrow is actually the last day, so you're just in time."

"Ekantapayyan?" I asked. It meant 'lonely boy', which was a strange name for a deity.

"I'll tell you his story. In the distant past, many generations back, there was a hunter and his son. Each day they would go into the deep forest, and each night they would come back. On some days they would catch a rabbit, or a deer, and on those days the son would be happy and safe. However, on some days they would return empty-handed, and on those days his father would beat him. The hunter was a man like the wind, letting his emotions flow freely over him. When he was  happy, he would pamper his son and play with him. But when he was angry, he would hurl the worst abuses on his son and beat him till he was bruised all over.

"The son wanted to prove himself to his father, and so he began to take greater and greater risks. Consequently, the number of days where they went hungry were lesser, but the hunter's rage was greater on the days when they were empty-handed. One day, the son fell off a tree while trying to shoot a deer and broke his leg. His father went mad with rage and beat him more than he ever had, until the poor son lay limp. It was now too late; the hunter was childless. He went mad with rage, and his spirit still roams the woods today."

"So why do you worship him?" I ventured to ask.

"It's less of worship as you think of it, and more of propitation. I told you how we in the village are one big family. The hunter's spirit would be our grandfather. Now we have to take care of our grandfather, regardless of what he has done. In return, in his own way, he takes care of us too."

There was a stillness as Venkatayya finished speaking, broken only by the clop of the hooves of  the buffalo.

Suddenly Beerappa spoke, for the first time since I joined them, "Look! We're almost there!"

Through the forest canopy, I could see a warm glow of electric lights. Venkatayya steered the buffalo onto a dirt track leading into the forest. Travelling for almost 10 minutes through the dense trees, we came into a large clearing, from which small lanes led off into rows of tiled houses.

Even though a festival was supposed to be happening, the place wasn't very lively. A few youths were sitting on a bench at one corner and talking, while an old woman was leading a goat by a rope. Beerappa quickly dismounted and started calling out in a language I couldn't understand.

"What is he saying?" I asked.

"He's talking in our village's language. Being away from others for so many years, we developed our own language others can't understand. He's telling everyone to come out here for the festival."

That didn't sound right. During festivals most places would have decorations up, and celebrations from the morning well into the night.

"I thought the festival was going on? Why is it so empty?" I asked.

"Oh yes, yes," said Venkatayya, "but they wouldn't start till I came. As I said, we're all a big family, and I have been in Kumily for the past three days."

That didn't sound right, but I didn't want to prod for fear of offending him. By now, a crowd had gathered and were looking up at us in the cart. Venkatayya raised his hands and said something in their language, and they all began to cheer and dance. Someone brought drums, and they began to beat them heartily.

"Now come," Venkatayya said as he dismounted, "I'll take you to my home. You must want to freshen up and change."

I followed him along the lanes till we reached a house a bit bigger than the rest. He climbed up the stairs to the verandah and into the house, and I did the same. He called out and a woman wearing a skirt and blouse came out from one of the rooms. He started speaking to her in his language. She seemed frightened, and started to say something while glancing at me, but Venkatayya cut her off, and she glumly nodded.

He turned to me and said, "My wife, Juhiamma. She doesn't know Malayalam or Tamil, but I've told her to take care of you. Now I have some matters to tend to, so I'll join you in a bit." So saying, he left the house.

Juhiamma turned to me and bowed slightly, then gestured to a room. I entered and put my bag on the bed. She made a sound to draw my attention, then led me to a small shed behind the house, which I realised was the bathroom. Like many rural areas, here, too, bathrooms were kept away from the house. I nodded and thanked her, but as I turned away the caught my hand.

Her eyes were fearful, and she started speaking slowly. Yet I could not make head or tail of what she was saying; I knew both Malayalam and Tamil, and their language seemed to be related to neither. I slowly shook my head. She blinked and sighed, then pointed at me while gripping her throat with her other hand. *Is she saying I'm going to die?* I wondered. Suddenly I heard Venkatayya's voice call out, and Juhiamma started. She quickly drew something out of her blouse and tucked it into my back pocket.  Before I could check what it was, Venkatayya came over to the back of the house and saw me.

"There you are! What were you doing?" he said cheerfully.

"Your wife was just showing me around.." I said. I didn't know what she was saying or what she just did, but I didn't like the feeling of being here. *I should have just slept in my car.*.

"Come, come, join our celebration!" Venkatayya cheerfully draped his arm around my shoulder are led me to the village center. Now, there was a table set up at one end of the ground.

"Since I'm the chief," he explained, "I get a special table. And since you're my guest, you can join me!"

We sat at the table and banana leaves were placed in front of us. The villagers sat on the ground in rows, and they were given leaves as well. Many of them kept staring at me, then quickly looking away. I was feeling very uncomfortable, but there wasn't anywhere to go. Two young men quickly joined us and started putting food on our leaves. It comprised of some sort of millet, along with a dish of tubers, a curry made with leaves I couldn't identify, and a large, hot piece of meat. Around us, the same food was being given to the other villagers.

Venkatayya leaned toward me and said, "All this is hunted or foraged. In honour of Ekanthapayyan, we prepare our food only with forest produce during the festival. The meat is deer."

I'd never eaten deer before, so I tried a small piece with trepidation. It was tender and spicy, absolutely delicious. In fact, all the food was good, and I ate with gusto. Venkatayya laughed and patted my back, and the food almost made me forget my misgivings about the place. The colours seemed brighter, the sounds livelier, and the tastes sharper.

\---

I woke up and blinked my bleary eyes. My throat was parched. I tried to get up, but realised my  hands were tied to a pole behind my back. Patches of colour slowly arranged themselves into shapes, and I could see around me. All the villagers were silently bowed on one knee, facing downwards. Despite them being a large crowd, there was no noise. Not one cough, sniffle or even the sound of someone shifting their weight. They may as well have been a field of dummies. As I gained my consciousness further, I realised it wasn't just the people. *The entire forest was silent*. None of the disharmonious cacophony of insects, no bats flying overhead, no herd of elephants in the distance. I felt a pit deep within my stomach.

I slowly struggled, and felt a vague outline of something in my back pocket. As I slowly picked it out I realised it was a small knife! That was what Juhiamma had tucked in there. I slowly began sawing at my restraints, fervently blessing her in my thoughts.

Suddenly I heard leaves cracking. In the stillness of the forest that night, they were loud as a thunderstorm. Venkatayya emerged from the foliage ahead. 

"Hello my boy!" he called out with a voice dripping with sickly sweetness, "we still have some time, so I'll tell you a story to keep you busy. I didn't tell you the whole story of Ekanthapayyan, did I? Upon losing his son, his spirit went mad and continued to roam the forest. He was in a murderous rage and would kill anyone who came in his path! So we made a deal with him, many generations ago. All he wanted is another son..

"So once a year he comes to us, and we offer him someone to keep as his son. He will take good care of you, you know? He'll teach you to hunt, to forage, to feel the forest as you feel yourself. But eventually you'll start slipping up. You'll bring home poisonous berries. A rabbit will escape your faulty trap. You'll almost drown when you swim in the wrong part of the river. And he will not like that. He will scold you and beat you. One day, he won't be able to take it anymore, and he will kill his son again.  He comes to our village and leaves the previous one's clothes. After that, we have three days to find him a new son. It was such great luck you came along!"

Venkatayya threw his head back and laughed heartily. By now I had almost cut my ropes off. As long as he kept talking, I could free myself. I also was able to perceive a new sound breaking though the forest. It sounded like someone unsteadily walking, while producing what sounded like happy weeping. I felt my ropes yield. *Finally I was free!* Now I needed to bide my time...

"He's almost here.. It was nice knowing you, son. Don't get me wrong, We're just doing what we have to, to survive."

I could finally see a shape emerging from the forest. What I had expected was... I'm not sure what I expected, but not this. Ekanthapayyan was just a regular man, albeit a bit taller and more muscular. He was dressed as a regular Irula hunter; a loincloth on his waist and a red cloth tied around his forehead, a bow slung over his back. His tattered white shirt, contrasting against his dark skin, was the sole concession to modernity. His features were sharp and he sported a thick moustache and beard. He spoke in a cracked voice, the corners of his lips turning up.

"Son?"

When he said that, I realised I was frozen, I quickly stood up and fled the clearing, frantically pointing to Venkatayya and saying, "He's your son!"

I entered the foliage and hid. Something made me turn back. Venkatayya had become a blubbering mess, backing away from the approaching figure of Ekanthapayyan. The deity caught him by the wrist and began to take him to the forest. Just before stepping through, he turned to his left, and looked straight at me. His eyes were bright and intense as a tiger's, but they had no malice. Just tiredness, the mind of a man who had to live the same life over and over again. Abruptly he turned away and entered the forest. I quickly turned and ran as fast as I could. I don't know how long I ran; the forest blurred into itself and me feet kept up the tempo of a run, carrying me along without my knowledge. Somehow I landed up at a road and collapsed on it, hugging it and weeping. That was how the forest patrol found me an hour later. 

They took me to their station and administered first aid. Later, over a cup of tea and vada, they asked me what happened. As soon as I mentioned the village, they exchanged knowing looks. They arranged for me to stay another night while my car got fixed up, and I drove straight home. 

All this was about a year ago. I'm writing this now because of something that happened yesterday. When I opened my window, there was a pile of tattered, torn clothes on the sill. Venkatayya's clothes. Ekanthapayyan is looking for a new son. When I think of him, I remember his tired eyes. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to go with him after all..
