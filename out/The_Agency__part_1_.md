My name is Cleo, you might think that you know people like me from books and movies, but trust me, you don't. 

As you know I can't share my story with you directly for obvious reasons, so I got a contact to share it on my behalf. 

I am a ghost, literally. I was recruited by the Agency at a young age due to my natural capabilities to vanish and my neck for learning languages. 
I could be sitting next to you in a coffee shop, or walk past you in the street and you won't take note of me. I am invisible to the world. I am a ghost, I live in the shadows, move in the shadows, and that is how I prefer it. 

I stand at a mere hight of 4ft8, with short blond hair and piercing blue eyes, when you look at me I might smile at you, my smile carrying a hint of mystery and secrets. 

But don't be fooled by my looks, I am a field agent, but not with any known Agency, no the Agency I work for has no name, well not one that is spoken out loud, and even those who does speak it, mentions it only in Whispers. 

You see, our Agency has unlimited funding. Our funding outweighs the combined funding of all the known agencies in the world. 

Our wealth puts countries to shame. 

We do not answer to governments, or any form of oversight, we are loyal only to what we stand for and to the mission. 

We have people in governments, corporations, and our reach extends to the most powerful and influential people in the world, we are the weavers of destiny, our existence has passed the test of time. Ward are fought, won and lost, but our influence decides what is told throughout history. 

We are the protectors of earth, the guardians of humanity. 

Our scientists are the brightest in the world, our agents the best of the best, we have technology which would make countries drool, technology that would appear to be from science fiction. 

We are everywhere, and we are nowhere, our reach extending to every part of the globe, we can access and even control any device connected to the internet, there is nobody we cannot get to, nowhere we cannot go, borders are meaningless to us, governments fear us. 

Individuals are wise to avoid us, because if you cross us then your name will soon be added to your local missing persons list, and as for you, well you will wake up in one of our blacksites. 

Now that you know what I am, and who I work for, let me tell you my story. 

I will be sharing some of my past missions here with you guys, don't ask me why, because if I get caught I would never see the light of day again, even my contact is taking a risk by helping me. 

I can already feel those cold eyes on me, watching my every move, my every key stroke. 

The telepath...
I know it sounds like something from a fiction story, but telepathy is very real, our agency is very real. 

The only reason you have a sense of normalcy is because my team Omega 7 and myself work tirelessly in the shadows, so that you can have a normal life, so you can sleep peacefully. 

But as for telepathy, it is very real, very powerful. And very dangerous. The only reason they don't abuse their power, or why they won't show themselves, is because they know of us, they fear us, and rightly so. 

One of my first missions I was sent on was to track down a dangerous telepath. 

Code Name: Sin. 

Sin was a powerful telepath, dangerous beyond comprehension. But he was smart, good at keeping secrets, at hiding, HD knew how to blend in and keep his head down. 


Sin first came under our attention a few months ago, Politicians were starting to act strange, making dangerous decisions, scientists would abandon important research and delete data, artists starting going insane. The one thing they all had in common was they all described the same man haunting their dreams, a young looking man with a pale skin, dark hair and pitch black eyes, they all exclaimed about those eyes, eyes that look into your soul. All the sketches looked exactly the same, we fed the data into our systems and the systems tracked him down. Not much was known about him, he was a ghost. Besides a strong social media presence which pointed to a very nice, kind level headed man, well nothing else. 

He has no criminal record, he did nothing wrong. 

We dug deeper and found more evidence of his influence going back years. 

He has to be stopped at all costs. 

We had our mission briefing, it was in a secure room that was designed to keep even ethereal energies out, we knew who, no let me say, what we were up against. But that is when it begun. 

The night before the briefing my team started to experience strange dreams, troubling nightmare, I myself wasn't spared. Sin knew what we were doing, and he was taking action. He fired the first bullet. 

The next day during mission briefing we were informed that he was tracked to Cape Town, South Africa. A beautiful bustling city with diverse cultures and a rich history and a strong culture of art. The perfect place to vanish, to hide. But Sin wasn't hiding, in-fact it was as if he was taunting us, playing with us, daring us to come after him. 

Our modified V22, Osprey, designed with new stealth technology allowing us to move across borders undetected, with a reinforced hull, painted black rendering us a ghost at night, it was more then just a plane, it was our lifeline, our shelter in the storm, it was a flying computer, a flying armory, with drones hidden in secret compartments around the hull, weapons that could take out a small army, modified engines allowing us to fly at incredible speeds. 

We slipped into South Africa over night and touched down at a private agency owned field outside the city. 

We rented a vehicle and got to our safe house where our contact was waiting for us, she had already had all of our systems set up so that we could monitor Sin, everything was in place. 

But then we got an alert, not only did Sin know we were here, he was pushing our buttons, he started to release Agency secrets online, secrets that were so well kept that there was no paper trail, no digital footprint, he was in our heads. 

That was when the safe house exploded, we were thrown into different directions, there was gunfire everywhere, we had nowhere to run. 

I saw my team getting killed, I saw each one of them die, then a masked man walked over to me. I looked up at him, I tried to draw my side arm, but my body wouldn't move, I could just look at him helpless as he drew a sword and the next moment there was a flash and I felt myself hitting the floor, but then I was back with my team. We were all in shock, traumatized. It turned out he made us all experience the exact sand vision of each of us getting beheaded. 

But it was not real, it felt so real, my heart was racing, I was soaked in sweat, in all my time throughout training, all my preparation to face a telepath, nothing could have prepared me for this. 

But we knew the mission, and no matter what happens, we had to capture him, HQ wanted him alive. 

We all read his profile, he will mess with your mind, he will mess with your dreams, he will put you through total and utter gell, but he doesn't kill, he has never killed and he is actually against taking a life. And that was his one weakness. 

Sin might be a telepath, but he made a few mistakes, he was a loner, he hated crowds, he hated crowded spaces, instead he preferred silence and solitude, he knew a lot of people, but never let anyone in, he had no friends, no family, he was utterly alone. No matter how powerful he was, he was alone, I had my team, we were like a family, we trained together, fought together, we knew each other like family, but unfortunately for us, Sin had been in our heads, he knew us better than we even knew ourselves. 

We had to prepare, study him, learn his habits, routines, likes and dislikes. 

We decided to take time to watch him, but tomorrow the mission begins, two of my team members will attempt to make direct contact, we knew where he worked and where he lived. 

But we couldn't just move on him. He would see us coming, we had to play his game, this was going to be a game of cat and mouse. We need to get him to become paranoid, knowing that we are onto him, we needed him to lose focus, to slip up. 

And tomorrow the real work begins...
