I didn’t set out to build a monster. That’s the first thing I need to say.

It started as a research project—something meant to help. I was part of a private team working out of a classified site in the Pacific Northwest. Quiet, isolated. Long drives through fog-drenched pine forests to get there. All off-grid. Just us, our labs, and the thing we were trying to grow.

We called it Project Apex. The goal? Bioengineering a next-generation survival organism—an *“evolutionary prototype.”* Something that could be used in search and rescue, even extreme combat support. Genetically enhanced instincts, learning capacity, endurance.

I was the neural engineer. I worked on the learning systems—cognitive tissue spliced from human stem cell batches. The logic was simple: animals hunt, but humans adapt. If we combined the two, we could build a creature that didn’t just follow orders, but learned from the environment. Something smart. Something useful.

But you can’t make the perfect predator without creating something predatory.

And deep down, I think we knew that.

••

*It grew fast.*

We housed it in a reinforced bio-reactor tank—tinted glass, nutrient fluid, internal restraints. I watched it from the observation window most nights while the others went back to their cabins. I’d sit there with a coffee, staring at this twisted silhouette of half-formed bones and muscle fibers suspended in bluish light.

It twitched sometimes. Scratched the inside of the tank with its fingers—long, thin, jointed too far. Like it was dreaming of movement before it had even taken a breath.

The nightmares started a few weeks in.

Dreams of being followed. Of something that looked human but wasn’t. No face, no voice—just presence. A weight behind me wherever I turned. I’d wake up with the bedsheets soaked through, heart racing.

••

It happened on a Thursday night.

Storm rolling in. Just me, Dr. Hines, and Marisol from security on the overnight shift. The other six were off-base for a weekend rotation.

Sometime around midnight, alarms went off in the gestation lab.

Hines and I ran down the hall. The tank was cracked. Internal pressure had failed. Fluid leaking out across the floor. Cables torn from the socket like they’d been pulled out—deliberately.

*The creature was gone.*

All that was left was a smear of blood on the inside of the glass and a set of claw marks on the hatch door.

••

I wish I could tell you I reacted like a professional. But I froze.

The thing—our *“apex prototype”* was in the corridor, maybe thirty feet ahead. Its back was to us. It looked… wet. Gray. Long limbs. Smooth skin. Not a single strand of hair. And when it turned, its eyes caught the light like polished stone.

They were black.

Not dark. Black. Hollow.

Dr. Hines stepped forward, whispering, *“It’s okay. Easy.”*

He had the tranquilizer rifle up, arms steady.

Didn’t matter.

It moved so fast I barely saw it. One blink, and Hines was on the floor. Another blink, and his throat was gone.

The sound—God. I’ll never forget that sound. Wet and ragged and sharp, like fabric tearing underwater.

Blood sprayed across the wall.

I just stood there, breathing too loud. I made eye contact with it—for a second, maybe less—and that was enough.

*I ran.*

••

Marisol opened the emergency override and pulled me through. We locked the lab doors behind us and sprinted.

I remember her asking what happened. I couldn’t speak. I just kept moving.

We turned a corner—and found the ceiling vent torn open.

Marisol muttered, *“Oh no. Oh no no no.”*

Before I could say anything, it dropped from above.

It landed on her with a thud that shook the floor. She screamed. Fired blindly.

Muzzle flashes lit up pale limbs wrapped around her, claws sinking in, her body arching in pain. One shot connected—I heard the shriek—but it didn’t matter. She shoved me backward.

**“Go!”**

I ran.

I didn’t look back, not even when the gunshots stopped. Not even when I heard her final scream swallowed by something wet and final. I ran on instinct, deeper into the facility, my blood ringing in my ears. I slammed the bulkhead closed behind me and activated the internal lock.

It scratched at the other side of the door for a while. Not tearing, not pounding—just that slow, careful scrape. I think it wanted me to know it wasn’t in a rush.

••

The control room was dark, emergency lights casting red across the consoles. I barricaded the door, shaking, sweat soaking my shirt. I checked the monitors.

Camera feeds blinked one by one into static.

It was destroying them systematically. Learning where the blind spots were.

That was when I realized it wasn’t just a killer.

It was strategic.

It wasn’t hunting for food. It was hunting to understand. 

And it was getting smarter every minute.

••

I tried the backup radio. Nothing. I slammed my fist into the panel so hard I split the skin across my knuckles. No satellites. No phone lines. No alarms. We’d built the place off-grid to keep our research contained.

*We succeeded.*

Now I was the containment.

I sat in silence for hours, gun across my lap, watching the dark screens. The vent in the ceiling creaked every so often. Light, subtle—like a whisper of movement.

I didn’t sleep.

••

At some point, the power failed completely.

The emergency lights faded. The hum of ventilation died.

The only sound left was my own breathing and the occasional shift of metal overhead.

And that feeling—the weight of being watched.

I think it wanted me to know I was last.

It wasn’t just picking us off. It was reducing the variables.

When it finally came, it didn’t roar. Didn’t charge.

The vent cover dropped onto the floor with a soft clang.

And it lowered itself down.

Controlled. Quiet.

Like a spider.

••

It stood upright.

Its silhouette was almost human now, but the joints were wrong—arms too long, knees bent backwards slightly, head cocked to one side. Its skin was translucent in the lantern light. Veins like spiderwebs. Ribcage too wide. No nose. Just slits. Its mouth was shut, but bulging at the seams with teeth. It towered above me.

I fired the pistol until it clicked empty.

One round hit. It staggered.

Then it growled—a low, guttural sound, almost disappointed—and lunged.

I swung the fire axe. Hit it in the shoulder. It screeched and flinched back.

I bolted for the emergency purge system.

There was one chance.

I smashed the glass, grabbed the lever, and yanked.

The purge kicked in with a metallic howl as argon flooded the lower levels. The creature scrambled backward, choking, slipping back up through the vent.

And I passed out on the floor.

••

I came to hours later, coughing blood, side throbbing where it clawed me. I limped through the halls. Every room was empty. The storm had blown a hole through the outer wall. Trees swayed outside, morning light bleeding through the smoke.

Hines was dead. Marisol too. The others—never came back.

*The creature was gone.*

But it had left a trail. Blood, tissue. Smeared across the walls and out into the woods.

I should’ve followed it.

Should’ve made sure.

But I didn’t.

••

That was fifteen days ago.

I’ve been living in a disused ranger cabin about eight miles from the site. Off-grid. No one’s found the base yet. I check the news every morning—nothing. No discovery. No alert.

Which means it’s still out there.

Still watching.

••

I’ve nailed boards over every window. I keep the lights low. I don’t cook after sunset. I carry a rifle everywhere, even to piss in a bucket. I haven’t slept more than an hour a night.

I’ve heard things.

Snapping twigs in the woods. Scuff marks outside the door that weren’t there the night before. Once, I found a strip of bloody gauze lying on my porch. I don’t use gauze.

••

And the dreams are back.

Only now they’re not just dreams.

Last night, I woke to a tapping on the window.

Not loud. Just… deliberate.

***Tap.*** *Pause.* ***Tap.*** *Pause.*

Like a finger. One finger.

I didn’t move.

Didn’t breathe.

Eventually, it stopped.

But when I worked up the courage to check, I found a handprint on the glass.

Upside down.

••

I think it’s testing me.

Maybe it still remembers my scent. Maybe it thinks I’m unfinished business.

Or maybe it just likes the game.

That’s the part I can’t stand—the idea that it enjoys this.

That somewhere inside that engineered skull is a flicker of satisfaction. That I, its creator, am just one more lesson in a long syllabus of pain.

••

I haven’t told anyone.

I should’ve gone to the authorities. But then what? They’d cover it up. Or worse—try to use it.

It’s perfect. *Too perfect.*

It doesn’t mimic. Doesn’t talk. Doesn’t reason the way we do.

But it learns.

Faster than we expected. Faster than anything we’ve ever seen.

And it doesn’t stop.

••

You know how some animals will play with their food?

That’s what this feels like.

It’s not killing to survive.

It’s evolving to win.

I’m posting here as a way to leave behind a record. Just in case.

If this entry makes it out, if you’re reading this, then please, for the love of whatever you believe in:

*Don’t look for it.*

*Don’t go to the forest. Don’t search the ruins. Don’t try to trap it.*

*Because it’s already moved on.*
 
*It’s probably somewhere closer now.*

*Closer than you think.*

*Watching.*

*Learning.*

*And when it comes, you won’t hear it.*

*You won’t see it.*

*You’ll just feel that ancient, primal certainty:*

*That you are no longer the apex predator.*

*And never were.*
