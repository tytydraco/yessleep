Stumbling back, I went rigid with dread.

Chris stared at me as if he’d just seen a ghost, his face pale despite the soot, blood, and grime. He smelled of gunpowder and death, his clothes stained rusty-red, likely from a downed companion as he didn’t seem to have any injuries. The maple-syrup-colored hair on his head lay plastered down from sweat, and he had dark bags under his blue eyes, as if he hadn’t slept well in days. Coarse stubble covered his face, and yet in that moment, he was still the most handsome man I’d ever seen, enough to make my heart skip a fragile beat.

“Hannah?” He rasped, his eyes searching my face, and Chris swayed on his feet in a mixture of exhaustion and shock.

*I can’t do this.*

My mouth opened and closed, as my brain rushed to come up with something to say. “I . . . I um . . . I have to go.”

Ducking around him, I tried to run off into the dark, but Chris caught me by the arm.

“No, you’re not.” He pulled me back to face him, shaking his head with a confused frown. “I just got the news that you were here. Where have you been?”

Emotions tangled in my head like roots, and I fought the urge to cry, stammer, snarl, and vomit. “Can we talk about this later?”

“Later?” Chris’s jaw dropped, and he narrowed his eyes at me, as if he couldn’t believe the words coming out of my mouth. “Are you serious? I haven’t seen you for days, then you show up, call some secret meeting with the officials, and rush off without so much as a ‘hello’? What’s going on?”

“I don’t have time right now.” I tried to wiggle out of his grip, but Chris’s fingers were like iron bands on my arm. Tears threatened to brim in my eyes, all the good feelings from a few moments ago blasted away by the sound of his voice. I’d thought I was over what had happened in the memorial hut, but yet just seeing Chris brought all the anguish back in an ambush of raw pain that I couldn’t handle. I needed to escape, to bury myself in work, anything to get away from that horrible aching sensation of rejection in my chest.

“How can you not have time?” He blinked at me, and Chris’s expression melted to a hurt look that send ripples of agony through my brain. “For God’s sake, Hannah, I’ve been looking for you everywhere. Jamie has hardly spoken since you disappeared.”

*I bet.*

With a hard jerk, I wrenched my arm from his grasp, and choked back a rising lump in my throat. “Kind of hard to say anything when you’re making out with her, right?”

Chris’s eyes glimmered with a horrified guilt that only made the torment in my chest that much worse. “Hannah, I—”

“Just stay away from me.” Unable to meet his eye, the sentence enough to bring hot tears to mine, I shoved Chris away and dove into the shadows.

Everything became a blur of motion and time, as I threw myself into the flurry of activity around the fortress with mechanical desperation. Abandoning my gear at the lodge, I led a patrol to recover Lucille and the others from Eldar Crossing with only what I had on me, and thankfully it went off without a hitch. Once back through the gate, I organized them into teams, and we set about helping the workers to load fuel cans, food bins, and heavy electrical batteries onto trucks. Everything that wasn’t nailed down had to go, but we only had so much space on the vast caravan of trucks, cars, tractors, trailers, RVs, carts, and pack animals that began to form in the main asphalt parking lot atop the hill. Armed rangers were forced to sort through the mess, ordering people to leave bulky personal effects behind in the interest of taking necessary supplies, which created scenes of vocal discontent everywhere I looked. Wooden furniture, extra clothing, and even a few gold-leaf picture frames piled up in the grass. An older woman cried as she tossed out a set of china figurines that looked older than she was, and a gray-bearded man cursed the rangers as ‘heartless savages’ when they ordered him to leave his cello behind. We had won a major victory; and yet, we were in full retreat, morale amongst the three factions at an all-time low.

To add to the tension, under the watchful eye of more guards the captured pirate children shuttled water containers to vehicles, extinguished the rest of the fires, and carried litters of wounded from the makeshift field hospital to waiting tour buses that had been repurposed as transports. They were jeered, spat on, and cursed at by passing fort-dwellers, hatred boiling to the surface now that the battle was over. Only the rifle-toting rangers were able to keep the pirates safe, and ironically it seemed they did more to keep our own people at bay than to keep the prisoners from attempting to escape. Peter did his best to keep his crew in line, though I could tell the ill treatment rankled his buccaneer’s temper. One thing ran as a united theme among us, however; we all kept one eye to the sky for the inevitable tide of artillery like rabbits watching for a hawk, each minute that ticked by enough to bring us closer to certain fiery doom.

After all, the missiles wouldn’t discriminate.

I was busy lugging solar panels with the others to a flatbed pickup, when Sandra walked up to me from the shadows.

“A moment?” She beckoned me aside and threw a glance over her shoulder to ensure we weren’t being overheard. “Jamie’s awake. Sean has her in the cage until we move out, though I don’t think she’ll cause any problems.”

My stomach twisted, but I did my best to shrug indifferently. “So?”

Sandra winced at the sharp edge in my voice. “Look, I know it’s been a rough night, but she’s just been told about Andrew. I understand if you don’t want to go, but she needs to talk to someone, and she refuses any kind of religious or psychological intervention. I’m worried to leave her alone, just in case she . . . you know . . .”

At that, some of the cold pride in my chest softened, and I noted the tired lines on Sandra’s face, how she avoided the eyes of the other people who passed us by, many of them glaring at her white lab coat. Word traveled fast in New Wilderness, and since Dr. O’Brian was already dead, they had no one to take their anger out on. Andrew had been popular among all factions, so the bedraggled citizens of the fort directed their fury at whoever they thought might have been involved, which mainly consisted of the stunned Researchers. If my night had been bad, Sandra’s wasn’t getting any better.

*Of all the people who might deserve to feel like crap, she’s not one of them.*

“Okay.” I coughed and waved at the work team to go on without me, giving Sandra the most encouraging nod I could muster. “I’ll, uh, see what I can do. Thanks for letting me know.”

As she turned to walk away, I took another step into the dark. “Hey, Sandra?”

She stopped, and raised a nervous eyebrow, doubtless waiting for some kind of cruel rebuke about her chosen faction.

Instead, I made an exhausted smile, though the seriousness of the whole affair weighed heavy on my shoulders. “We would have lost a lot of good men tonight if it weren’t for you and yours.”

Sandra’s eyes shone with gratitude. “Thanks. It really means a lot. I . . . I hope everything goes well, for you.”

My journey to the mechanical garage was a long, tortuous one, each step like a needle in my heart. I didn’t want to see Jamie, I didn’t want to see Chris; after everything I’d gone through tonight, I honestly just wanted to find somewhere to sleep. But sleep would not be easy in coming, not with Chris’s wounded gaze burned into my vision, and Dr. O’Brian’s taunting words rolling around inside my head like a creepy jingle to some old horror movie.

*There won’t be a Barron County anymore.*

Gritting my teeth, I forced myself through the metal side door of the garage, and slipped past crowds of busy workers to the detention cages at the back of the building.

Two rangers flanked the door, both with dirty clothes, bloodshot eyes, and vacant stares. Both let me pass without much incident, my face more recognizable at this point than anyone else’s, and I stepped into the quiet cell space beyond with a fast-beating heart.

Jamie sat on a folding cot in the far corner, legs curled up to her chest, arms wrapped around her knees, disheveled bleach-blonde head angled toward the wall. She turned to face me as the door swung shut, and her eyes were red and puffy, the green irises glazed and empty, as if the person behind them didn’t have enough strength to feel anything anymore.

As soon as our eyes met, Jamie’s countenance went from stunned, to horrified, to ashamed, and she dropped her gaze to her kneecaps without a word.

I didn’t say anything either, unable to build a cohesive sentence, my thoughts too scattered. On wone hand, I wanted to be angry, but Jamie’s broken expression sapped any of my strength to do that. Instead, I crossed to a nearby desk, where the keys were kept in the top drawer, and unlocked the cell door to let myself in.

Sitting down on a wooden stool across from her cot, I folded my hands in my lap, and sighed.

*What happened to us? It seems like yesterday that she was showing me around the fort. Now we’re visiting in a metal cage, like she’s some kind of terrorist monster.*

“Did he suffer?” Jamie’s whisper broke the long, stony silence, her voice low and hoarse, both green eyes fixed straight ahead at the wall in resignation.

Andrew’s blood-spattered face flashed through my mind, and I held my breath to stave off a rush of guilt. “It was quick.”

Jamie shut both eyes, a few crystalline tears rolling down her cheek, still as rigid as if she were made from granite.

Pain twinged through my soul, and I studied her defeated form, how Jamie rested on shoulder against the cold wall of the garage, all the spirit gone from her. This wasn’t the spunky ranger who had dragged me from the forest all those nights ago. Jamie looked desolate, hollow.

Lost.

“I heard Sean stopped by.” I shifted in my uncomfortable seat and tried to change the conversation.

Jamie wiped at her face with uncaring fingers and nodded.

Wishing I could turn back time, and undo everything that had brought us to such a low point, I raised an eyebrow to continue my polite facade. “So . . . what did he say?”

“I’m under arrest.” Jamie droned, with a humorless smirk that only played about her tired face for a moment. “Once we reach Ark River, I’ll get to attend Andrew’s funeral before my trial. Then they’ll hang me.”

*Peter was right.*

My heart stopped, and I whipped my head back and forth in an effort to smother the mounting panic in my throat. “He didn’t really say that, did he? They can’t pass a sentence before the trial. It’s not fair.”

“He didn’t have to.” At last, Jamie turned to look at me, and the sadness in those emerald irises cut through me like a laser beam. “I’m a traitor, Hannah, three times over. There’s only one way this ends.”

Swallowing hard, I looked down at my fingers, and tried to think of something, anything to say. No one in all my life had done the things that Jamie had for me, both the good, and the bad. Even Matt and Carla at their worst hadn’t handed me over to ELSAR, but yet they’d also never been as generous, compassionate, or supportive as Jamie. She was the closest thing I had to a sister in this world . . . and they were going to hang her.

“Does Chris know you’re here?” She dropped her gaze back to her knees, and my brain prickled in remorse.

“Yeah. We kind of ran into each other.” I picked at the seam of my pants, and chewed hard on my lip until I tasted blood.

“Good.” Oblivious to my mood, Jamie bobbed her blonde head with robotic slowness. “He went half-crazy while you were gone. Maybe now he’ll start to eat and sleep again.”

*I doubt it.*

Letting a few stray locks of brown hair fall in front of my eyes to hide my crestfallen expression I shrugged. “I’m not going to see him anymore.”

At that, Jamie pivoted to squint at me. “What?”

My eyes met hers, and I sucked in a deep breath before the plunge. “I *saw* you, Jamie. In the memorial hut. You kissed him.”

If her face had been a plain of numb grief, Jamie’s pale cheeks rippled with a new wave of guilt, and she rested her forehead against both knees. “Oh.”

Never would I have guessed that I could feel so bad for asking questions I had every right to ask, but with the way Jamie’s shoulders hunched in barely stifled sobs I couldn’t muster anything more than a gasped whisper. “Why?”

Jamie wiped at her nose with her shirt sleeve, and in her haunted gaze I caught heartbreak, loneliness, and a pain that no bandage or sutures could heal. “I was drunk, and . . . and I made a mistake.”

“But why *him*?” I rested my elbows on my knees, the emotion welling in my chest at the memory. “Jamie, *you* pushed me to go out with him, *you* said it was okay. If you already had Andrew, if you wanted me to be with Chris then why would you do that?”

Her eyes met mine again, and Jamie’s shattered grimace radiated humiliation beyond my knowledge. “Because I never forgot the first time it happened.”

Her words rocked me, and I couldn’t breathe for a few moments. There it was. The truth, out in the open. They’d been together, before I came along. I’d figured as much, known it in the back of my mind from how they bickered, picked on each other, and how she looked at him when Chris walked away. My suspicions had been right all along, and that made my intestines knot together in sour tumbles.

*This whole time, Chris was my first on everything . . . and he had Jamie to compare me to. How could I ever hope to beat someone like her? She’s so pretty, and smart . . . no wonder he kissed her.*

As if sensing my despair, Jamie turned to drop her legs off the side of the cot and rubbed her face with her hands. “Chris and I seemed made for each other when our patrol first picked him up in the north. He’d been out there so long, I was shocked that he’d survived at all. With Bill fresh in the grave, it felt good to have someone to talk to so . . . we spent a lot of down time together.”

I clenched my teeth to keep from crying, the mental images of what that might entail torturing me like another of Vecitorak’s visions. Had he been telling me the truth? How far had Jamie and Chris gone, either before or after I came along? Could I trust a boy with my heart who would have slept with my best friend the second my back was turned?

Shuffling her boot soles across the cement, Jamie focused on her laces, not meeting my eye. “After Carter took over, everything changed. Chris didn’t like the rules, the confiscations, the rationing, and said it was ‘tyrannical idiocy’. I just wanted vengeance for my brother, so I didn’t care what had to be done if it meant we survived, and I told him he was a ‘selfish moron’ for thinking outside of the group. When I joined the interior guard, he was furious, and we ended up screaming at each other until some rangers came to separate us due to noise complaints. Chris started breaking the rationing edicts to get extra food for people, while I arrested smugglers on Carter’s orders. We went days at a time without speaking to each other, and when I caught Chris handing out some food he’d found in the wild zone, I did my job and arrested him.”

I stared at her, the pieces coming together at last. The comments made between them in the forest. The unspoken ‘friend’ she’d seen down her rifle sights the day Jamie was put on the firing squad. Chris’s dreams of reform, and his willingness to shred Carter’s men on my behalf. There’d always been more to it, more behind the curtain of their carefully guarded expressions, a hidden war that I hadn’t been allowed to see because both Chris and Jamie didn’t want to revisit their awful past.

Jamie’s shoulders slumped even further, and she grimaced, as if loathing herself for the memory. “All I wanted was to make him see sense. I thought maybe Chris would get a few days of hard labor, maybe some firewood duty, but Carter wanted to set an example. So, he put Chris against a wall, and ordered me to shoot.”

I imagined myself in her shoes, pictured Chris standing against a wall of sandbags, the irons of my weapon leveled over his broad chest. Carter had frightened me, not because of any perceived evil that may have applied to him, but because of his conviction, his force of will, his unshaking devotion to what he believed was the correct way forward. Resisting him in any way would only end badly, and for Jamie, the choice would have been agonizing.

*He was proud of her, I remember that much. Carter thought highly of Jamie, even after her betrayal of him. She must have been good at her job . . . which means a lot of people ended up in the cage because of her.*

Jamie’s eyes pooled with tears, and she raised her head to look at the wall past me, as if reliving that day all over again. “I couldn’t do it. No matter how infuriating he was, how stubborn, how bull-headed . . . it was Chris. When they shoved me into line next to him, Chris held my hand, told me it would be okay, even though we both knew it was a lie. Sean’s revolt saved us just in time, but the damage was done, and we agreed to end things between us.”

Outside, a car horn honked, and voices called to each other as more vehicles left the mechanical garage to head for the assembly area in the main parking lot. We didn’t have much time, and somehow that hurt even worse than this conversation had. I wanted time to stand still, so I could make sense of things, understand, find a way to cope. The world was moving too fast, and change lay just around the corner once more, ready to turn everything upside down.

Jamie shook her head and turned away from me in shame. “Andrew was a good man, kind, and gentle. If he’d asked, I would have been the mother of his children, would have followed him anywhere, would have gone to my grave as Mrs. Hoppman. He deserved that much and more, but I never would have told him that I couldn’t give him my heart like I did with Chris. I tried, I *wanted* to, but I just . . . couldn’t.”

Clearing my throat of a dry lump of sadness, I shrugged, puzzled. “Then why didn’t you say anything? Jamie, I would have listened. If I thought it would hurt you, I would never have—”

“Because you fell for him from day one, you amazing little dork.” She sniffled, with a weak half smile that held a flicker of her former self. “From the moment he walked up at the rhino enclosure, I could see it in your eyes, hear it in your voice, and it hurt more than anything I’d ever known. Thing is, I couldn’t hate you for it; you were nice, sweet, decent, the perfect kind of girl for a guy like him. I wanted Chris back so badly . . . but I wanted you to be happy even more.”

Leaning back against the wall, Jamie rubbed at her arms, with a shiver that wasn’t all from the cold, and inspected her fingernails with an embarrassed frown. “When you got infected, Chris worked himself ragged trying to find a cure. I was the only one who stayed out as late as he did, went on every patrol with him, scrounged for every rare herb Dr. O’Brian or Eve requested. The thought of you dying drove him crazy, and I couldn’t bear to watch him suffer like that. I had too much to drink at the harvest dinner, and when I went to visit my brother’s picture, Chris followed me because he saw me staggering, and got worried. I didn’t mean to, Hannah, I really didn’t, I just . . . I wanted to feel something other than pain.”

I looked down at my own hands, dirty and calloused, the fingernails torn and bandaged, a far cry from the soft palms of a city girl who had gone on one road trip too many. “It doesn’t change the fact that he kissed you back.”

“At first.” Jamie flicked her eyes to me with an insistent gleam to them. “But he pushed me away.”

*Really? After all that, you’re going to lie to my face? Is nothing sacred to you, Jamie Lansen?*

Anger flared in me at last, and I narrowed my eyes at her to snap the words. “No, he didn’t. I watched the whole thing, Jamie. He didn’t resist at all.”

In a surge of green fire, Jamie’s eyes came alight with indignation. “Then you obviously didn’t watch long enough because he *did.* I swear on my brother’s soul, Chris didn’t cheat on you. He pushed me away, told me we couldn’t do that anymore, because . . .”

At her sudden hesitance to finish the sentence, I raised an eyebrow, wounded curiosity and heartbroken angst mixing together like acid in my guts. “What?”

For the first time that night, Jamie let slide a genuine happy smile, small and tinged with pain, but happy nonetheless. “He’s in love with you.”

The air stopped in my throat, and I stared at her, frozen in place. My warped, tangled feelings wriggled over themselves to try and make sense of what she’d said, and yet I couldn’t get anything to come out of my mouth, not a single intelligent syllable.

*It can’t be true . . . can it?*

“He never told you yet, did he?” She made a rueful, sympathetic chuckle, one that competed with a sob to escape her lungs, and Jamie ran her fingers through her hair. “Chris was always bashful about such things. The whole reason I went to O’Brian, kept her filthy lie, handed you over to ELSAR is because I wanted you to *live*. I want you to be happy with Chris, to have his babies, and die in some boring painless way when you’re old as dirt. I want you to have what I never had, because you deserve it, Hannah. The kiss was my fault. Andrew’s death was my fault. All of this was my fault, and if anyone should be give a second chance, it’s Chris.”

*Knock, knock, knock.*

Jumping despite myself, I turned as one of the guards opened the door to the room and jerked his head at me.

“Our first convoy is heading out in fifteen minutes.” He flicked his gaze to Jamie, and back to me again. “Sean wants us to move her with them. Just wanted to let you know.”

Jamie and I looked at each other, and my head spun like a top. In my memory, I saw what the stranger in the chemical suit had shown me, Jamie weeping alone in the hut after Chris had left, the truth beyond the lies Vecitorak had tried to sow in my mind. I’d walked in here dreading to face my enemy, but I found myself sitting instead with the one person who had cared for me from the beginning. She’d been loyal to me, despite her moment of weakness, faithful and true as ever. Her sorrow at my infection had been genuine. Jamie’s tears when the soldiers hauled me away had been real. She hadn’t betrayed me.

She’d saved my life.

*What would you do for love?*

With the stranger’s voice ringing in my brain, I rose to my feet, and stepped aside so the guards could lock the handcuffs around Jamie’s wrists.

As they began to walk her to the door, I crossed on front of them, and met Jamie’s eye.

She tensed in anticipation of some kind of defiant sendoff.

Hot tears spilled over my eyelids, and I slid my arms around her to hug Jamie as tight as I could. “Thank you.”

With her hands chained, all she could do was rest her chin on my shoulder, but I could hear her muffled sobs in my left ear. “I’m s-sorry, I’m so sorry, H-Hannah . . .”

“Don’t be.” I patted her back, and let the bitterness fall away as the truth washed over us both. “The past isn’t worth dwelling on. I’ll see you in Ark River.”

They led her away, and I found myself alone for the first time in a while, standing in that empty room with the door to the improvised cell now hanging open. For my entire life I’d been the odd one out, unwanted and unnoticed in so many social circles, save for the affections of my parents. Yet here, in this forgotten, cursed stretch of Appalachia, I’d ended up surrounded by people who truly loved me in ways Matt and Carla never had, and I realized just how much I had to lose now.

*Fifteen minutes. I’ve got fifteen minutes. Yikes.*

Setting my jaw, I pushed through the door into the mechanical garage, and ran for the exit. I didn’t have much time to set things right, but I was determined to make every second count as my shoes beat a steady rhythm over the ground on my way to the lodge.
