In the small, fog-draped town of Ashburn, there was a forest known as the Whispering Woods. The townspeople spoke of dark things that lived in the shadows there, but most feared one legend above all others—the story of the Hag of the Hollow. The tale was passed down for generations: a witch, old as the woods themselves, who lured the curious and the foolish into her lair, never to be seen again.

Jacob was only ten years old, and while he'd heard the stories, he never believed them. His mother had warned him countless times to stay away from the forest’s edge, but one cloudy afternoon, a voice whispered to him from the trees.

"Jacob..." The voice was soft, like the wind brushing through leaves. "Come play with us..."

It sounded so...friendly. Jacob took a cautious step toward the woods, his heart pounding. The voice beckoned again, sweeter this time. The whispers seemed to surround him, tugging at his mind.

"Come closer, Jacob...we're waiting..."

With one last glance toward his house, Jacob took a step into the woods. The moment his foot touched the damp earth, the sky seemed to darken. The trees twisted into strange, gnarled shapes, their branches reaching like clawed hands, and the whispers grew louder, filling his ears, guiding him deeper into the forest. He walked for what felt like hours, but no matter how far he went, the path behind him seemed to vanish. The further he wandered, the colder the air became, biting at his skin like winter’s breath.

Then he saw it—a clearing up ahead, bathed in an eerie, gray light. At its center stood an old, decaying cabin, its roof sagging and walls twisted with creeping vines. The door creaked open, and a foul stench poured from inside.

"Come in, Jacob," a raspy, ancient voice called from the doorway. This wasn’t like the gentle whispers before. This voice was cold, hungry. He tried to back away, but the trees behind him seemed to close in, leaving him with no escape.

As Jacob stood frozen, the witch stepped out of the cabin. She was impossibly tall, her skin gray and leathery, her eyes sunken pits of darkness. Her long, twisted fingers curled around a crooked staff, and her smile... it was the smile of someone who hadn’t eaten in a long, long time.

"I’ve been waiting for you, Jacob..." she crooned, her voice like nails scraping against stone. "So many have come before, but none so special as you."

Jacob tried to scream, but the sound caught in his throat. He turned to run, but roots snaked from the ground, wrapping around his ankles, pulling him toward the cabin.

As the witch approached, the whispers grew deafening, a chorus of voices crying out, warning him. Jacob's heart raced as he recognized some of them—children's voices, like his own. Their pleas rose in a desperate crescendo, calling his name.

"Run, Jacob! Don't let her take you!"

But it was too late. The witch's gnarled fingers brushed against his skin, and a freezing, unnatural chill seeped into his bones. Her eyes glowed with malevolent glee as she dragged him toward the door of the cabin.

Inside, the walls were covered in strange symbols, scrawled in dark, dried blood. Hanging from the ceiling were small, broken dolls, their eyes missing, their mouths sewn shut. But what made Jacob’s blood turn to ice was the pit in the center of the room—a deep, black hole from which no light escaped.

The witch shoved him toward the edge, and as he stared into the abyss, he saw them—faces, pale and twisted, floating just beneath the surface. Their mouths moved in silent screams, their eyes wide with terror. They were the children who had gone missing, swallowed by the forest, lost to the witch’s curse.

"No one ever leaves the woods, Jacob," the witch cackled, her voice dripping with malice. "And now... you’ll join them."

With a single, sharp push, Jacob tumbled into the pit, the cold darkness swallowing him whole. As he fell, the whispers followed him, growing softer, until there was only silence.

The search party looked for days, but just like the others, Jacob was never found. His mother, like so many before her, was left with only questions and grief.

But late at night, when the wind howled through the trees, the townspeople swore they could hear the witch’s laughter echoing from deep within the Whispering Woods. And sometimes, if they listened closely, they could still hear Jacob’s voice among the whispers, calling for help... but never escaping.

The woods had claimed him, just like they had so many before. And as long as the witch remained, they would claim many more.
