My eyes gaze blankly through the glass and towards the endless, muddy plains blanketed in a thin layer of powdery snow as the train continues its long journey to my destination.
 
I check my phone again and reread my text exchange with Nicole from the last time I had service.
 
*The kids can’t wait to see you, honey. And neither can I. How much longer do you think it’ll be?*
 
*The attendant told me we’d be at the station by eight if there are no more delays, I’d replied. Don’t worry though. I’ll be there tonight. Love you.*
 
This was supposed to be the first Christmas Day I would be spending with family in over a decade. When I’d accepted the work assignment – tracking down an unresponsive witness with an address in the middle of absolute nowhere – I hadn’t anticipated it taking three days, or a blizzard shutting down the airport. Now, this fourteen-hour ride was my only hope of making it back on time, and it had already been delayed twice.
 
A coarse voice calls for me. I turn. It’s the white-haired man sitting across the aisle. He’s one of the only other passengers in my train car. He’s thin, and looks quite up in years. He’s wearing a formal black suit, with a matching black-and-white tie.
 
He wants to strike up conversation. I’m not normally one to share information with strangers, but he carries a gentle sincerity that disarms me. We chat for a bit, and when I mention that I am returning to my family, he asks if I have kids waiting for me at my destination.
 
“Yes,” I reply. “But they aren’t mine, not really. They’re from my, um…my partner’s previous marriage. This’ll be my first Christmas with them as part of the family. Assuming the train gets there on time, that is.”
 
He nods slowly and wishes me good luck. He tells me that I have a lot to live for. That he had a lot to live for too, once, but that he’s all alone now.
 
I’m not sure how to respond to that. “Oh,” I mutter. “I’m sorry to hear that. Where are you heading, if not to meet with someone for the holiday?”
 
His response is cryptic. *Somewhere I’ve been before,* he tells me. You see, he continues, *there’s a reason this train is so deserted. Strange things can happen on this route this time of year. Just don’t forget what matters to you most. You have a lot to live for, young lady.* Then, he removes a blue pill from a bag, pops it into his mouth, and swallows it with a gulp of bottled water. *Now,* he says, *I’m going to get some rest.* He lays down across the empty seats to his left and right and closes his eyes.
 
I ponder his words as I return my gaze to the barren landscape outside. I pity this kind, lonely man, and I wonder what he meant about “strange things” happening on this route. As far as I’ve observed, everything about this train ride has thus far been mundane.
 
As darkness begins to fall, the man’s gentle snores mix with the regular clickety-clack of the train passing over rail joints and squats, lulling me into a state of drowsiness. I find myself yawning as the frosty scenery blends together in the fading light. I close my eyes and think about Nicole and the two boys. They’ll stay up all night waiting for me, if Nicole lets them. But hopefully it won’t come to that.
 
Hardly a moment passes before my hopes are dashed. My eyes shoot open at the sound of the loud hissing of breaks. The conductor’s voice announces that “mechanical failures” have prompted an unplanned stop at a station. *We expect a one-hour delay. Passengers must disembark during the repair process. Repeat, passengers must disembark.*
 
Fucking hell, I think. Part of me wants to scream at the nearest train employee. But I know better than to yell at someone who probably wasn’t at fault. Better to wait for the problem to get fixed.
 
I text Nicole about the delay as I stand up and don my coat and scarf. Judging by his empty seat, the old man has already stepped outside. I do the same and hop onto the platform. 
 
I feel a vague sense of familiarity as I read the banner stretched out across the side of the train station. It states *Welcome to Evergreen* in red and green letters. Rather than spend the hour waiting at the station, I decide to explore.
 
The town around me could hardly be more picturesque. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a town so thoroughly decorated for the holiday season.
 
Smatterings of snow sit on the tiled roofs of the shops in the downtown around me, as well as the Victorian houses on nearby hills. All are decorated with an assortment of lights, as well as Santa and reindeer figurines and inflated props.
 
The town’s inhabitants, adorned in heavy coats, top hats, gloves, and scarves, trudge through knee-deep snow. Giant candy canes, thick green trees, and the occasional snowman line the streets. A horse pulls a couple in a buggy beside me. Children in a park nearby giggle as they pelt each other with snowballs.
 
My surroundings delight me. I feel like I am inhabiting a childhood dream. It reminds me of the many hours I used to spend watching my mother craft every detail of a miniature holiday-themed town of her own. 
 
As I cross a small bridge over a lake, I look down at the families skating across its frozen surface. It’s a lovely sight, but I can’t escape an uneasy feeling that grows in my gut. It’s all too perfect, too serene. Most eerily, it makes me feel nostalgic, too, even though I know that I have never before visited someplace like this.

Almost instinctually, I navigate through the town until I arrive at a main street packed with Christmas-themed shops and stands. I find myself somehow anticipating the various sights moments before I see them: a dog in an adorable elf costume, a series of stands marked “Hanks Holiday Market,” and a group of four carolers singing to a small crowd.

It all hits me when I read the sign outside a store covered in wreaths and garlands: *Sofia’s Christmas Confections*. I back up as my heart beats rapidly. It’s not true. It *can’t* be.
 
This whole town…it’s *identical* to the Evergreen my mother and I once created.
 
It was my last Christmas with her. The signs of illness were still scattered, and she wouldn’t get the diagnosis until early the next spring.
 
She spent many of her last months of good health teaching me her hobby. We cleared out a whole room in the basement and used tables and buckets to set up the town’s hilly geography. She showed me how to cut and layer the mountainous backdrop to hide the electric wires that powered the lights and the train that ran through town. We set up a frozen lake and covered the setting with cotton snow.
 
For the most part, we reused the people, buildings, and decorations from mom’s private collection. But, she and I spent a several days constructing and fine-tuning a new shop to add to the town. When it was completed, she let me name it after myself: *Sofia’s Christmas Confections.*
 
As I look around now, I recognize each and every item in the busy street around me. Each person, house, tree and even the lights dangling from them – all a perfect match to pieces from my mom’s collection.
 
Questions rush through my mind. How could this be possible? This town just *can’t* exist. What mom and I constructed was just an artificial miniature, after all.
 
Yet, here I am, walking through it. Had it sprung from my imagination? Had I shrunken, or had it grown?
 
This all feels so inexplicable, so *wrong*. I rush back towards the station. The train, alone, is comfortingly real, like the last piece of a world I’d disembarked from moments ago.
 
I am nearly back when a sight catches my eye. Something about a hill that overlooks the station feels different from the rest of Evergreen. It takes me a moment to realize *why* it seems that way. Then, it hits me: that hill doesn’t *belong* there. It, alone, deviates from the miniature my mom and I constructed so long ago.
 
Through the fluttering light snowfall, I discern the outline of the structure at its peak. It sits on a small plateau mostly visible from my current location. It’s a house I haven’t visited in nearly ten years: my childhood home – the same home where my mom and I built this very town.
 
Its front door opens. A distant figure, obscured by the precipitation and the diminishing light, steps outside of it and walks in my direction until she is standing at the precipice of a steep decline.
 
I still can’t make out the figure’s features, but I have no doubt who she is. “Mom,” I call, even as I know she is too far away to hear me.
 
She looks over the town, as if searching for something, or someone.
 
*Me,* I realize. She’s looking for me. My screams for her are futile. She’s too far away. 
 
I scurry through the snow in her direction as she turns around and heads back inside. I’m not going to leave her, not now that I have found her again in this impossible place.
 
I ignore everything around me – the man pushing his car out of the snow, the hot chocolate stand, the children laughing on the merry-go-round – as I ascend a lower hill and then follow a narrow trail through a dense wood of tall fir trees.
 
Finally, I emerge to find myself facing the plateau that overlooks the town. The house’s surroundings, from its elevated position to the adjacent graveyard and the vibrant garden that surrounds it, bear little resemblance to the deserted countryside I grew up around. Nonetheless, the building itself is an exact match to the compact, one-story ranch house of my youth.
 
I approach slowly, allowing myself a few moments to catch my breath. The climb would normally exhaust me and, indeed, I feel a tired stiffness in my joints. Nonetheless, the prospect of reuniting with my mother, no matter how illogical the whole situation feels, pushes me along.
 
I knock three times at the front door. My heartbeat races as I hear the approach of shuffling footsteps. A lock is undone, then another.
 
The wooden door creaks open. A dark figure steps forward. The artificial glow cast by the red and green lights that line the outside of the house illuminate a face that bears so much resemblance to my own.
 
I start to cry. Before I know it, my wet face has dug into her green sweater. She hugs me back.
 
My mother leads me inside. She tells me that I can’t imagine how much she has missed me. She tells me that after so many years apart, we’ll finally be together again.
 
Everything is as it once was, from the family photos lining the front hallway, to the antique grandfather clock that remains functional after decades of use, to the small tear on the fabric of the old living room couch.
 
I find myself sitting by the burning logs of a large fireplace beneath a tall, gorgeously decorated Christmas tree. Stacks of perfectly wrapped presents surround me.
 
When I ask mom questions about where we are and how I got here, she shushes me, handing me a plate of cookies in the shape of trees, snowflakes, and stars. Just like the cookies she’d always bake for this time of year.
 
“But mom,” I insisted. “I have so many questions.”
 
*All in good time, dear,* she tells me. *Let’s just enjoy each other’s company for now. It’s been so long.*
 
“But I need to know!” I say. “How are you here? How is any of this possible? I was there when you, when you…” Mom hands me another tissue as I choke on my words.
 
*It’s all okay,* she says in a voice I’ve missed so dearly. *We’re together now. We’ll always be together now.*
 
“I have so much to tell you, mom. So much has happened since you left. I have a family now. A wife, and we’re raising two kids.”
 
She tells me that she can’t wait to hear all about them. But, she wants to enjoy being here with me a little longer before getting to them. She hands me a present and asks me to open it.
 
I gaze at the beautifully wrapped gift. A sense of ecstasy courses through my veins. I’m somehow here, with my long departed mother, having a Christmas as wonderful as any from my childhood.
 
The moment seizes me. My mom’s face beams in satisfaction as I find myself tearing apart the wrapping paper, revealing a gorgeous floral dress underneath. I embrace her, thanking her for the gift.
 
The second present is a handmade hardwood sled. As a kid, I’d been good at sledding, but I’d always been stuck using a much cheaper model. I thank mom profusely, telling her that it is just what I wanted. It feels true, even though I haven’t thought about sledding in years.
 
A distant, high-pitched sound pulls me back to reality. I remember the train. If I’m hearing its whistle, then…Wait, how long have I been away?
 
I glance at the grandfather clock. If the time it displays is accurate, I’ve been gone over fifty minutes.
 
An unsettling feeling grows inside of me. My train is about to leave, and, somehow, I feel absolutely certain that no other train will be stopping here anytime soon.
 
“Mom, we need to go. I don’t know what this place is, but we need to leave it, now.”
 
Mom maintains her long smile. She insists that there’s nothing to worry about. That we don’t need to be going anywhere.
 
“Mom, no, I need to get back to my family, and I need you-”
 
Her expression sours. “Sofia, you belong here, with me. I’m not leaving, and neither are you.”
 
“But, mom, I *have* to get back to my family-”
 
She raises her voice. “*I* ***am*** *your family, your* ***real*** *family, and you’re staying right here with me.*” 
 
My affection for her fades. I know that my mom – my *real* mom – would leave with me. Certainly, she’d never ask me to abandon my wife and children to stay with her. 
 
“I’m sorry, but I’m leaving.”
 
With surprising force and speed, mom restrains me when I stand up, wrapping her arms around my neck from behind. She whispers four words into my year: *There’s no leaving Evergreen.*
 
Her grip tightens around my neck as I try, in vain, to pry her arms off. In desperation, I stumble towards the fireplace, ignoring the heat as I back into it.
 
At first, my mother – or, at least, the figure pretending to be her – doesn’t seem to mind, even as I sense the encroaching heat. I begin to lose consciousness as I grow desperate for breath.
 
Finally, her grip becomes too weak to restrain me. I tumble forward. As I catch my breath, I turn to find the figure engulfed in flames that have spread all over her body.
 
She isn’t burning. She’s melting. All of her facial features – mouth, eyes, nose – are disintegrating into a liquid that runs down her body, forming a molten pool at her feet.
 
*There’s…no leaving…Evergreen*, she croaks before collapsing to her knees.
 
I don’t have time to process the grotesque sight. I know that I need to leave this town, no matter what it takes. Adrenaline sends me sprinting outside in the direction of the station.
 
To my surprise, dozens of townspeople await me. They line the roads and footpaths back down to the station. Moments ago, I’d seen these same people – men, women, children – frolicking peacefully in this idyllic holiday town. But, now, they march towards me in unison, chanting four words I’d grown to loathe: *There’s no leaving Evergreen*.
 
The train whistles again. I don’t have much time.
 
Scanning my surroundings, I see only one way forward. Quickly, I run back inside, grab the sled mom – or whatever that thing was – had gotten for me, and exit to the side. My path takes me through the small cemetery inexplicably located near the house.
 
As the chants of the approaching crowd grow closer, my foot slips, and I barely manage to stop myself from plummeting into a deep hole in the ground. The inscription on the tombstone bordering it reads, “Sofia White. Born January 13, 1992. Joined Evergreen December 25, 2021.”
 
I reach the hill’s precipice as the crowd closes in on me. The decline is rocky, and dangerously steep, but it leads towards the train station.
 
“*THERE’S NO LEAVING EVERGREEN*,” repeat the townspeople, who have encircled my position. Seeing no other option, I dive forward in the sled.
 
A nauseous pit grows in my stomach as my speed rapidly increases. The intense wind sends my scarf sailing away. My sled lands on a small rock formation, sending it flying, but I’m able to keep my grip and continue the descent.
 
With a ‘thud,’ the sled crashes into a tree. I roll off and spot the slowly-accelerating train. Mustering my last bit of energy, I sprint toward the tracks, reaching them just as the caboose is about to pass. I reach out, grab the metal railing, and pull myself onboard.
 
A hand shakes me awake. It belongs to the train attendant, and he’s telling me that I’ve reached my destination.
 
I take in my surroundings. I’m back in the passenger cabin, as if I’d never left my seat. Behind the attendant, I see three EMTs lifting the old man from across the aisle into a gurney. His body is pale and limp, but a long smile stretches over his face.
 
An officer asks me a few questions about the man’s death. I tell him that I hadn’t seen the man since the train stopped at Evergreen for repairs.
 
The officer eyes me skeptically and calls over the conductor, who confirms that the train never made such a stop, and that there is no town with that name anywhere on our route.
 
I spend that evening with my family, who had all waited to open presents until my arrival. It is a warm, joyous occasion, one I choose not to spoil by sharing any of what I’d recently experienced. Instead, as I hug my wife and children, I remember one thing the old man had said, “You have a lot to live for, young lady.”
 
The paper soon runs a story about an Edward Michaelson, who was found dead in his seat at 8:04 p.m. on December 25, 2021. Upon reading it, I recall something else he told me: “*Strange things can happen on this route this time of year.*”
 
I’m not sure what happened. Of course, the logical part of my brain tells me that I had a vivid nightmare while he, coincidentally, suffered a fatal heart attack.
 
But I also wonder if the train took him somewhere like Evergreen, allowing him to be with someone who meant as much to him as my mother did to me. I think, too, of the graveyard on the hill, and the lushness of the garden that surrounded it, almost as if Evergreen needed us to sustain itself.
 
As the months pass, I think less and less about what occurred. It’s been almost a year now. My family life is as wonderful as ever, and I eagerly await the approaching morning when our sons will excitedly unwrap the presents Nicole and I have left for them under the tree.
 
Today, a package with my name on it arrives at our front door. It has no return address.

I drop it to the floor when I see the two objects inside: my long-missing scarf, and a handwritten note with four words in alternating red and green letters, “*There’s no leaving Evergreen.*”
