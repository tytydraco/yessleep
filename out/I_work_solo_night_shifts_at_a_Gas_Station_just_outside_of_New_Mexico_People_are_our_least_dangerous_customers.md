I could feel the sugar on the popcorn as he flew through our front door and smashed into the set of shelves in front of it. My first thought was how the sugar hadn’t caramelised right. The second one was how I should tell the manager again to move the shelves away from the entrance so they stopped being destroyed like that. The third one was to get up and take a look at the guy before I had to watch another one die.  
  
“You ok buddy?”  
  
The man stood up WHILE CURSING, looked me right in the eyes WHILE CURSING, his tattooed forehead covered in sweat, and started frantically pulling his gun out of his waist. It got caught up in his clothes as I started feeling the ground shake. I could see him panicking and trying to understand why the gun wouldn’t come out, but I had seen this before and I could absolutely tell he wasn’t focusing on the right thing. It’s the law of the universe that at this stage of events his gun just can’t come out - that’s how this works. I decided I had to say something:  
  
“I told you not to use pump four at this time of the night, you should really consider listening more. That’s Teddy’s pump!”  
  
He looked at me, fear and confusion covering the entirety of his eyes. I decided to try again,  one last chance:  
  
“Do you have any family you could call right now? I’d lend you my phone, but I kinda need it to pass the time”  
  
I heard a “what the fuck” coming out of his mouth, as massive shadow came out of the darkness outside and bit him in half, blood spraying all over the doritos and pringles section.  
  
“Hey Teddy!” - I waved.  
  
The massive werewolf unclenched his jaws, the man’s body falling at his feet split in two, and nodded at me, dropping a $100 dollar bill at my desk and crouching to fit through the door, the floor trembling behind him with every step until it finally stopped.  
  
I dropped back on my chair, feeling completely desperate. It was only my third day, and this was my second pool of blood, shit and guts to clean. I finished my popcorn bag, tidied up my desk, closed the front doors and hung a “be right back” sign on the door with a litter picker and a black bag in hand, ready to start the cleaning job for the night.  
  
That was my third day at work. I know most people reading this would have quit the job by then, especially considering I watched someone being decapitated on my first day, but I can explain. There are two reasons  why I’m working this job. This first one is that there are no skills required, and I have none. All you have to do is want to be there!  
  
The second one is a health condition. To be very honest, I was kind of done listening when the doctor was halfway through explaining it to me, but the important part that anyone needs to know is that I don’t process fear the same way as anybody else. I simply don’t feel it! The result is that everything becomes really boring for me.  
  
When I applied for this job, the owner called me right away and set up an interview for the same day. He hired me before I even knew what I signed was a contract and thanked me for taking the first shift solo on the same day. Had I known that I would be entering a very close relationship with the mop, I’d have probably said no, but all in all, I like it here.  
  
My first three shifts were fine, just the same old deaths and blood kinda thing, but I thought maybe the sixth one might be worth sharing with you. The guy who comes in the morning and deals with all the robberies and shootings thought so, at least.  
  
The shift started as normal. My starting time is either six or seven PM, depending on the days, and those first hours are usually really quiet because people are just getting home and none of my usual customers are around. From around eleven-thirty PM is when my usual crowd arrives. Teddy is the only Werewolf I know and he always wants to use pump 4. He’s superstitious like that and doesn’t like anyone using his pump when he arrives. I have some more stories about him if you want to hear them!  
  
Then we have CD! He’s a vampire, but never says a word and the only other vampire I know is Count Dracula, so I nicknamed him like that. Also, he seems to like to dance. As long as we have some bags of blood in the back, he doesn’t mind what I call him and his tips are great! There’s also Flash. You might know him as the Chupacabra! He reminds me of my dog, Flash, who died about 10 years ago, so I just called him that.  
  
There are also a bunch more. I’ll tell you their stories if you’d like. For now, I’ll stick to this night.  
  
These guys showed up, as usual, but when three AM hits, my gas station is always dead! Three AM is the haunting hour, you know? That’s when their peak time at work comes around, so I’m used to just kicking back and relaxing. As long as the store is clean and tidy and ready for Jacky, the murderer scarecrow, I’m free to watch my Mr. Creeps videos in peace.  
  
That’s exactly what I was doing on my 6th shift at the Gas Station at 3AM, when for the first time, all the lights flickered around for a second or two, and then completely died. I had other customers that did this, other ghosts from around the area, but never at this time, and never unannounced. This was someone new.  
  
After the lights went down, the air went freezing cold and it felt like the whole gas station was transported into another dimension. That’s how dark it was. All I had was my phone playing Mr. Creeps with the images moving around and his creepy voice echoing behind the front desk and the emergency lights shining over the front door and bathroom door.  
  
I could hear crying in the back of the station, like a strange wailing. Someone was suffering badly. Then, under the bathroom neon sign, a silhouette showed up. She moved slowly, and all I could hear was weeping. I asked out loud if she was alright or needed help to get anything, but she just kept weeping and moving in my direction, crossing shelves and seemingly talking to me while I watched all the recently organised shelves fall apart. Not a nice start!  
  
To me, this was mostly annoying. I wanted to finish my video, dying tonight felt slightly annoying and silly. How would I know how that story ended?  
  
I called out to her, asked her if she needed food or maybe a new veil. We had plenty in our back storage to offer to other ghosts, so why not her? But she didn’t seem to care. All she did was talk in Spanish and move towards me, reaching out and crying.  
  
I jumped the front desk counter to create some space, ran outside through the front door and into the quiet darkness and everything made sense only when I stopped to look at her and she crossed under the emergency light at the front door.  
  
La Llorona. She finally came. I was wondering when she would. Her face under the veil was a black pit of sadness, her veil was wet from her cheeks down and her dress was half rotten, disappearing, invisible at her feet. I had watched a video on her that day before coming to work!  
  
I screamed at her that it was ok, that she didn’t need to be sad anymore and that she was ok to show up around here when she wanted to, but she didn’t seem to want to listen. She would only wail lounder, the more I spoke to her.  
  
I ran behind Teddy’s pump, but that’s as far as I could go. I understood on my second day that If I went further than that during a visit, things would turn much, much worse (more on that on a different story if you’d like me to keep posting) and I didn’t want to die. Usually I wouldn’t have cared, really, but I had Mr. Creeps to watch!  
  
I showed her the phone.  
  
“I want to watch this, would you please give me my space! You’re being inconsiderate and invasive!”  
  
She screamed at me with rage, I could feel water splashing on my legs! In return, angry with her, I threw popcorn at her as she screamed a name, probably one of her murdered kids’. She was like one of those “It Follows” curse things: just kept moving at me at the same pace, no matter what was in front of her.  
I gave up on standing my ground, at that point. She kept coming and getting angrier and I didn’t feel like being taken to drown in some river right now.  
  
I went around the gas station with her on my heels the entire time while I tried to do some research about her and her legends. All it said was how she murdered her kids and then killed herself out of regret. Since she had come in from the toilets, I assumed she had crossed the wall from the back of the building, which felt like a bit of a breach of the rules, but there was nothing I could say to make her go away.  
  
Turns out, there was nothing I could say, but there was something that could happen, to make her leave.  
  
As I came back into the building and was ready to go back out through the front, she showed up. While I looked at her, convinced that this was how it was going to go until the end of my shift, I saw a pair of headlights coming into the Gas Station.  
  
I didn’t feel relief or happiness or anything. Anyone showing up at this time only meant more trouble, and all I wanted to do was watch Mr. Creeps! It sounded like an easy request!  
  
I came outside, gesturing to this driver to stay away, go somewhere else, we’re closed unless you want to die! I waved at the car, and in exchange, I was almost run over. I had to dive to the side to avoid broken bones and another kind of quick death, and immediately I knew what this was about for me and for them. I was being robbed. They were about to be something else a lot worse.  
  
As I dove to the side and the car skidded to a halt, I saw La Llorona come up in front of their front bumper, a massive slash of a smile covered in black tears showing up behind the veil. These two guys, though, seemed to not see her at all.  
  
They jumped out of the car, pistols in hand, as I locked the Gas Station’s door behind me, hearing their shouts after me telling me to stop. I would have stopped, but the other bitch was outside too. They were welcome to wait it out inside with me, if they promised to behave. All they did, however, was insult me and tell me I needed to open the door and give them everything I had or they would pop me. So, I pulled the reception chair to the front of the door, reached out for a new bag of sweet popcorn and turned on my Mr. Creeps video as I watched them raise their eyebrows, this grotesque looking demon approaching slowly behind them, murmuring and wailing.   
  
The best part of the night for me, was watching them as they realised something else was happening, turned around, screamed for their lives and were taken away by my new friend into the closest lake, to be drowned away and live with her forever. The other best part was that this bag of popcorn was absolutely on point!  
  
After she was gone with both those idiots and their car was left behind, all the lights came back on. The crying in the background and the freezing air both stopped and the environment went completely back to normal, like I had been transported back to my normal Gas Station.  
  
I checked the time. Four AM, just in time for the little bell to ring in the front door and for this massive stick figure with bushy hands and feet to show up.  
  
“Jacky!” - I exclaimed, happy to see the murderous scarecrow stumbling through the door. I went around the store to get to his bird feed, passed it to him, got a nice tip and he was on his way, peaceful as ever, as long as you don’t invade his field! As he left, I managed to have a look at pump two, and there it was. More insides, blood and shit for me to wash. How fun! Turns out La Llorona doesn’t drown people, she just carries them away to, eventually, explode them!  
  
Throughout this experience, I realised I needed to know more about her, in case she shows up again, but I couldn’t find much. People suspect she was betrayed or left by her husband and that her name was Mary, or Maria in Spanish, and so she murdered her two sons but offed herself after out of regret and now wanders around looking for her sons. That’s mostly what everyone knows anyway, but there’s one other thing about her I can tell you I found out and it’s the reason why she showed up to me that night.  
  
This is my finding, and you won’t hear this anywhere else, but it just makes sense: La Llorona only shows up to you once you read or hear about her. Since that’s what you’re doing right now, I guess I should wish you luck… You’ll be fine, just be sure to run if you hear any strange noises tonight or your lights flicker off.
