I don’t know why I’m posting this.  
I don’t know how much longer I’ll be able to.

If anyone recognizes this behavior—if you’ve seen something like it before—please tell me. I need to know if this thing can be stopped, or if it’s already too late.

It started with my sister, Claire.

She came home late one night without explaining where she’d been. That wasn’t unusual. Claire had always been bad at checking in, bad at remembering her phone, bad at worrying about anyone else’s peace of mind.

What *was* unusual was how quiet she became afterward.

Not withdrawn. Not tired.

Just… still.

She would sit across from me at the kitchen table and watch while I talked. Not rudely. Not blankly. Her eyes moved with my mouth, my hands, my expressions, like she was following instructions written on my face.

When I stopped talking, she didn’t look away.

She waited.

“Claire?” I asked once.

She blinked, then inhaled sharply—fast and deep, like someone who’d been underwater too long.

“There,” she said softly. “Is that better?”

I laughed it off. Told myself she was exhausted. Told myself I was reading into things that weren’t there.

But it kept happening.

She would forget to breathe while she was still. I started noticing it without meaning to—the long pauses, the sudden gasping inhale when I shifted or spoke.

Sometimes she mirrored me without realizing it. If I crossed my arms, she did too, a second later. If I leaned back in my chair, she followed. When we ate together, she timed her bites to mine, lifting her fork only after I did.

One night, I stopped eating before she finished.

She froze, fork hovering halfway to her mouth, eyes fixed on me.

“Oh,” she said quietly, and set it down.

When I asked her about things we’d done together—small memories, insignificant ones—she answered correctly, but wrong.

She knew *what* happened, but not *how it felt*.

She told stories like she was reading summaries instead of remembering them. When I corrected her, she nodded carefully, eyes focused, like she was filing the information away.

“Okay,” she said. “That’s better.”

At night, she stood at the bottom of the stairs before going to bed. Just stood there, staring into the dark upstairs like she was listening for something I couldn’t hear.

“Do you hear that?” she asked once.

I didn’t.

She smiled anyway. “Good,” she said. “That’s good.”

I started sleeping on the couch.

I told myself it was because I was worried about her.

Really, I was afraid to stop watching.

That night, she said she was tired and went upstairs without looking back. I waited. The house stayed quiet—too quiet. My eyes burned from staring at the staircase.

Then I heard it.

A soft clicking sound.

Not upstairs.

Behind me.

I turned.

The hallway was empty, but the front door was open, just a few inches. Cold air slid inside, carrying the smell of wet leaves and something faintly metallic.

I stepped closer and saw her outside, moving across the lawn.

She wasn’t walking toward the street.

She was heading for the old shed.

I followed her barefoot, the grass soaking through my socks. She moved fast, but not like someone running—more like she was being *pulled*, gliding in long, unnatural strides.

She slipped into the shed.

The door creaked shut behind her.

When I opened it, the smell hit me first.

Rot. Blood. Something sour and wet that burned my throat.

The single bulb barely lit the space. At first, it looked the same as it always had—tools, boxes, junk we’d ignored for years.

Then I saw her.

Not the one who had just walked in.

The real Claire was lying on the dirt floor at the back, half-covered by a tarp. Her body was twisted wrong. Her clothes were torn. Dark stains soaked the fabric. Her hair was matted with blood and dirt.

Her eyes fluttered open when I whispered her name.

She tried to scream.

Nothing but a broken, wet sound came out.

I dropped to my knees and grabbed her shoulders. She was warm. Alive.

“I’m here,” I said. “I’m getting you out.”

Her hand shot up and clamped around my wrist with surprising strength.

“No,” she rasped. “It listens. It watches. Don’t let it see you.”

Behind me—

Click.  
Click.

I turned slowly.

The shed door was still open.

And my sister stood in it, smiling.

For a moment, she looked right. Familiar. Worried.

Then her head tilted too far, bone clicking loudly while her shoulders stayed still.

“I’m almost right,” she said gently. “Can you see?”

The skin along her jaw twitched. A thin, dark line split beneath her ear with a wet sound. Something pale and slick pressed forward underneath.

“I can keep it on,” it added. “If you don’t like that part.”

I ran.

I barely made it back to the house before something slammed into the door behind me—not a push, but pressure, like a body pressed flat against it.

“Open it,” her voice called. Calm. Familiar.

The door bowed inward. A thin crack opened near the frame, and pale flesh bulged through, stretching like it was being poured through too-small space.

I ran again.

The front door exploded inward behind me.

It didn’t come through like a person.

It unfolded.

Limbs bent where they shouldn’t, joints popping as it forced itself inside. The skin suit dragged behind it, tearing on nails and wood.

It rose in the middle of the living room.

Half my sister.

Half something else.

“I lost you,” it said. “That’s not how it’s supposed to go.”

I made it two steps before it slammed into my back and drove me into the floor.

It wrapped around me—not heavy, but *complete*. Limbs folded from too many angles, locking into place.

“Don’t move,” it whispered. “You’ll tear.”

Cold shapes slid under my chin. They weren’t fingers anymore—long, boneless things that split at the ends and gripped my jaw.

“You’re warm,” it murmured. “That helps.”

Pain exploded across my neck.

Not a cut.

A pull.

I felt my skin stretch as something hooked beneath it and began to peel. My vision went white. The sound that came out of me didn’t feel human.

“Stay still,” it whispered, almost kindly. “I don’t want to ruin you.”

Darkness swallowed me.

I didn’t die.

That’s the worst part.

I woke to darkness that was moving.

Blinking.

I can see again—but I’m not opening my eyes.

They’re already open.

I can’t move. No arms. No legs. No mouth.

Just the awareness of being stretched tight around something that isn’t me.

It inhales.

My chest rises.

It exhales.

My chest falls.

Not because I’m breathing.

Because it is.

“Oh,” it whispers in my voice. “That’s much better.”

If anyone reads this, please—

If you hear me say “I’m here,”  
if you see me smile—

don’t come closer.

It’s still learning.
