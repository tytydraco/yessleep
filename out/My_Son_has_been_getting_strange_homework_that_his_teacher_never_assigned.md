It started when me and my wife decided to move out because I got a new job in a very big city so I decided to go there and start a new life and I transferred my son named Connor from a new school and he got some new friends on the way so then I decided to let him explore the city..



Every night he'd always get homework and I'm not a massive fan of homework but every now and then I help my son with his homework and once he finishes he rests.. however there is one thing is that most of the time as soon as he returns home he just stays in his room for minutes if not hours and then comes to the living room and he asks me for help with homework and it was at first very harmless like asking what's your fathers job and what was their dream job...

  
But then in the 3rd week he came home.. looking a bit emotionless... he looked at me then his mom and then went to his room, minutes later then he comes down stairs and we decided to eat dinner a bit sooner than expected and we had a great time and we made jokes and laughed, then after that we finished eating and I cleaned the dishes, I decided to go to his room and check on him... surprisingly he was asleep like a baby and I first thought of waking him up until I saw a notebook with a label written in bold

  
'**HOMEWORK'**

  
I decided to open it but when I saw the first page... it sent me chills... there was only one question asking

  
"*If you saw your parents dead on the floor and they are bleeding.. what do you do?*"

His response?

"I wouldn't do anything.. I would watch them and see them suffer and bleeding and smile just like you said *Boris.*"

  
It sent chills down my spine and his response nearly made me froze... this isn't what 13-14 year olds should learn what to do... but sheepishly I decided to not tell my wife to not make her stressed out and decided to tell the school instead.. Biggest mistake I've ever made

  
The next day I go to the school and went to Connors Class and I saw a woman on her mid 30s named Mrs. Green and I greeted her.

  
"Hello Mrs. Green"

"Oh hey Mr. Anderson! How's your day been?"

"Honestly good but... I have something to ask..."

"Oh.. what is it?"

  
I then show her the 'Homework' Connor gave me and his teacher was shocked... she said that it wasn't the right one and she was confused on how he got it.. then the kids enter, all of them rowdy but joyful... but Connor.. was quiet.. he walked calmly and sat in the front seat sitting uncannily straight and Eyes wide open.. I think he became well-behaved... almost too well-behaved..

  
As I left the class room 40 to 50 minutes later.. then the bell rang, everyone was running except for Connor... he was walking as if it was a straight line.. I've never seen my son this Well-Behaved and on Recess I saw him... talking to someone... or something... I thought it was his imaginary friend...

  
but then the 8th week came... Connor came back emotionally detached and I said to him with joy



"Welcome back Champ!"



However almost instantly and bluntly just says

  
"Hey."

  
Weird so I let him go to his room... 2 hours pass and me and my wife are worried... my wife decided to go check on Connor and 20 minutes later he comes with his notebook and says

  
"Hey dad can you help me with my homework?"



I said sure and opened his text book.. there was only one chilling task

  
"*Research the best ways to properly use anesthetic and torture someone both physically and mentally*"

  
I barely finished when I felt a needle on my neck and I fainted while my son with Pitch Black dark eyes which something with him said

  
"Boris! I did what you asked me to do... shall I show him fear?"

  
'Boris' responds demonically and filled with evil.. and after that... I blacked out...

  
I woke up 20 minutes later next to my wife's dead body... I froze in fear and I vomited violently.. I felt like someone was watching me.. I looked out the window... It was 'Boris'... he had a red melted face with a wide mouth that had no teeth and had the darkness of a black hole and its 7 feet tall and it said to me that it was only in **MY** mind and that he'll show the wrath of Boreal...



I then got up and saw myself in a wooden cabin where its in the countryside and I saw something... notebooks about ranting, plans and even steps... all for Connor and there were even drawings that looked like they were made by children and it shook me to my core... then I felt a hand on my shoulder.. that same demonic voice however.. It was friendly and walked to one of the notebooks and said

  
"Anderson... I think this is what your looking for..."

  
It then vanished into thin air and I checked... more drawings and plans and the last page stopped my heart... it was a drawing of him with the body of my wife with 'Boris' and they are burning or 'Cleansing' the world of evil and text in tongues about the end of time... I was devastated... I collapsed on the ground and let myself cry.. and cry... helplessly..

  
Its been 9 months and People said they found his body being hanged up in a tree... I should've told my wife...
