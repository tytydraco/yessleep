We should’ve never gone down that old, unmarked country road. I knew it, deep down, as soon as Tyler’s old Chevy skidded off the asphalt onto the gravel, the headlights slicing through the dense blackness of the Chattahoochee National Forest. The road was more of a narrow, forgotten trail—just a strip of dirt barely wide enough for the truck. Trees loomed in on both sides, their branches like twisted claws scratching at the truck's paint. Jenna clutched my arm from the passenger seat, her face a tight mask of unease.

“It’ll be fun,” Tyler said, his voice too loud in the oppressive silence, trying to shake off the nervous tension in the cab. “Just some harmless exploring.”

I could hear Melissa and Craig laughing nervously in the backseat. They were ready to turn this creepy night into some stupid Instagram adventure. But me? I just felt uneasy-nerves, maybe. But the lizard part of my brain was screaming at me to get the hell out of there.

After what felt like an eternity, Tyler killed the engine. The silence was instant and absolute, save for the gentle rustle of leaves in the cold night breeze. Dead Horse Road had led us to a small clearing, and beyond that, the barely-there trail winding deeper into the forest. Somewhere out there, three miles or so, lay Corpsewood Manor.

We got out, flashlights flicking on, beams cutting through the fog that clung low to the ground. The night seemed thicker here, the dark more oppressive. Tyler led the way, like he always did. Craig and Melissa followed, stumbling over roots and rocks, laughing a little too loudly. Jenna squeezed my hand, her grip tight, as if she could feel it too—the way the air seemed to hum with something our brains couldn’t, or wouldn’t, identify.

Tyler's voice cut through the heavy silence, almost eager to break the tension. “Alright, so, Corpsewood Manor. You all know the basics, right? Back in the ‘70s, this place was built by Dr. Charles Scudder and his partner, Joseph Odom. Scudder was a professor of pharmacology in Chicago, but he left all that behind to move out here, away from society.” 

Jenna glanced up at me, already looking uneasy. I could feel her pulse quickening against my arm, but Tyler wasn’t about to let up. 

“Thing is, Scudder wasn’t just some eccentric professor,” Tyler continued. “He had a serious interest in the occult—rumored to be into Satanism, too. Built this place as a kind of retreat, or maybe a shrine. They say the manor was filled with books on alchemy, ritual magic, and all kinds of weird stuff. The dude even painted his own murals—demons, pentagrams, that sort of thing. And they weren't just for show. He believed in this stuff, big time.” 

Jenna shivered beside me, her grip tightening. “I heard they used to have parties out here,” she said softly, more to herself than anyone. “Weird parties.” 

Tyler nodded, leaning into the story. “Yeah, exactly. Scudder and Odom didn’t exactly keep to themselves. They’d invite people over—friends, drifters, anyone really. They called it their ‘Pink Room.’ No electricity, no running water, just candlelight and booze. Scudder made his own homemade LSD, so people would get high, talk philosophy, or… whatever else they did. There were rumors of rituals, some weird sex stuff, and sacrifices—animal sacrifices mostly, but who knows, right?” 

Craig snorted. “So, like, typical hippie cult stuff?” 

Tyler’s expression darkened. “Maybe. But it went deeper than that. Scudder called himself a follower of ‘Thelema,’ which was this occult philosophy started by Aleister Crowley, you know, the ‘Great Beast.’ Scudder also kept a small altar in the manor, with a skull, candles, and that statue of Mephistopheles—the same statue that went missing after the murders.” 

Finally, after what felt like hours of trudging through the endless dark, the trees began to thin, and we saw it; a crumbling silhouette against the moonlit sky: Corpsewood Manor. Or what was left of it. The ruins stood like skeletal fingers clawing up from the earth, half-swallowed by ivy and tangled in moss, their jagged edges sharp against the night. Broken brick walls leaned precariously, and shards of shattered glass glinted in our flashlight beams—a once-stately place, now left to rot and ruin.

Jenna stopped, her breath catching in her throat. “This… this is it?” Her voice was a strained whisper, as if speaking too loudly might awaken something lurking in the dark.

“Yeah,” Tyler replied, his voice low and almost reverent. “This is it.”

We crept forward, our steps slow and tentative. Every movement felt heavy, deliberate, like the earth itself resisted our intrusion. The air seemed thicker here, colder, each breath a shiver. The shadows felt alive, pressing in from all sides. We stepped over what remained of a crumbling threshold, crossing into the gutted remains of the manor. Inside, the ground was littered with broken bottles, remnants of past visitors who’d come seeking a thrill and left behind their trash. A rusted can crunched under my foot, and I flinched at the sound, too loud in the stillness. 

“Look at this,” Melissa whispered, pointing to a broken wine bottle with a faded, torn label. “People really came out here to party?” 

Tyler’s flashlight swept across the ground, revealing more—old cigarette butts, scraps of cloth, a discarded lighter. "Yeah," he muttered, “particularly fucked up, considering Joseph Odom’s ashes were spread here.” His light paused over a dark stain on the brick floor—something that might have been oil, or… something else. 

Melissa stopped in her tracks and spun on her heel, her face pale and strained in the dim light. “What the hell, Tyler? You didn’t think to mention that before we came out here? That his ashes were spread here?” Her voice rose, frantic and edged with anger. “Are you kidding me? This isn’t some haunted house attraction! This is a real place where people died—where their bodies were literally scattered!” 

“Melissa, calm down,” Tyler said, his tone steady. “Plenty of people have come here and left without anything happening. It’s just a story, just a place. We’ll be fine. Look around—people partied here, trashed the place, and went home with no problem. Nothing’s gonna happen to us.” 

Melissa’s eyes narrowed to slits, her rage barely contained as she practically strangled Tyler with her gaze. The tension between them crackled in the cold air. Tyler, unfazed, continued his unsettling lecture about Corpsewood Manor. 

“Back in the early '80s, people around here started getting nervous,” Tyler began, his voice dropping to a whisper as he continued. “Rumors spread that Scudder, the owner, was a Satanist. And in December 1982, things went straight to hell. Two guys, Tony West and Avery Brock, who’d been out to the manor a few times, decided to rob the place. They were drunk, high, whatever. Things went south fast. They shot both Scudder and Odom, killed their dogs, Beelzebub and Arsinath… all while Scudder’s collection of human skulls stared them in the face.” 

A moment of silence followed, broken only by the distant rustle of leaves. Jenna turned to Tyler with a puzzled frown. “Wait… you said Avery Brock? You have the same last name as one of the murderers? That’s creepy…” 

Tyler’s lips curled into a smirk. “Even better—he’s my uncle.” 

Jenna’s eyes widened, and a chill ran down my spine. “That’s… pretty fucked up, man,” I said, trying to hide my unease. Jenna nodded, her face pale. “Yeah, why would you be proud of something so horrible?” 

Melissa’s eyes flashed with anger. “You goddamned ASSHOLE! You brought us to the place where YOUR UNCLE MURDERED PEOPLE!” Her voice rose sharply, cutting through the night. “This isn’t some casual adventure! It’s so fucked up that you’d drag us here knowing the history!” 

Tyler’s face hardened, his eyes narrowing. “It’s just history. Not my fault what my uncle did.” 

Melissa’s face twisted. “You’ve been boasting about your own shitty family history like it’s something to be proud of. That’s messed up, you’re fucking sick.” 

Tyler’s expression darkened, his tone growing colder. “Yeah? Well, at least I’m not known around here for being a raging slut-” 

Before he could finish, Craig stepped forward, his face set in a protective glare. “I will fucking end you, boy. Back up off my sister-” Tyler’s hostility flared, and the argument grew more heated. Sensing the danger, I stepped in quickly, trying to diffuse the situation. 

“Look, this isn’t helping anyone. Let’s just leave before things get any worse. This is seriously messed up. You should have told us about this before dragging us into a fucked-up field trip.” 

Tyler’s jaw tightened, but he said nothing. The silence that followed was thick with unspoken fears and the weight of the night’s revelations, as we gathered ourselves and prepared to leave. 

The wind shifted, growing colder and whispering through the brick ruins like a sinister hiss. Tyler’s face grew momentarily serious. “You ever hear of Faust?” he asked, but before Tyler could continue, Craig and I exchanged uneasy glances.

“Tyler, just stop,” I said, trying to cut him off.

“You’re really pushing it mother fu-” Craig started, his voice edged with increasing frustration before Melissa silenced him with a firm look.

Tyler ignored us, his tone growing more intense. “Scudder was obsessed with Faust. The legend says he sold his soul to the devil for knowledge. Who knows what kind of deals Scudder might have made out here in these woods?”

“Tyler, seriously, stop talking,” I urged again, but his words persisted, carrying an unsettling weight through the dark forest.

Jenna moved closer to me, her fingers brushing mine. “Why does it feel like… like we’re being watched?”

I didn’t have an answer. The whole place felt wrong like the ruins were breathing, watching, waiting. The silence was so complete it felt like a living, palpable thing pressing against my skin. I felt like I was suffocating under the weight of the atmosphere, the darkness more solid than air.

We continued to explore, pushing deeper into the ruins, our flashlight beams slicing through the murk. A broken, rotting wooden staircase loomed to our right, leading to a second floor that had long since collapsed. We found what remained of the Pink Room, now just a shell of its former self—bare walls still bearing faint, faded murals of demons and sigils. Tyler moved ahead, pushing through a tangle of ivy, when Jenna stopped suddenly.

“Did you hear that?” she asked, voice barely above a whisper.

I listened, straining against the silence. A faint noise, just on the edge of hearing. A low, rumbling growl, like distant thunder, but it came from the shadows… close, too close. Then another growl, answering from the opposite direction, deeper, more menacing. The sound vibrated through the floor, through my bones.

Jenna’s grip on my arm tightened painfully. “What was that?” Her voice trembled, panic creeping in.

I swung my flashlight toward the sound. For a moment, I saw nothing but shadows. Then they emerged, slowly, from opposite sides of the clearing. Two shapes, massive and dark, moving through the gloom with a predatory grace. They were more shadow than flesh, their forms barely visible in the dim light. Their eyes, though—those were unmistakable. They glowed like hot coals, a dull, reddish light burning in the depths of the night. Beelzebub and Arsinath—Scudder’s dogs, the guardians of Corpsewood, still patrolling their territory even in death.

“Run!” Tyler’s shout was almost drowned out by the sudden, explosive barking, a sound that seemed to shake the very ground beneath us.

Craig panicked, turning to sprint, but he took two frantic steps before his foot slipped on a patch of moss. He tumbled backward down a small, steep embankment, disappearing into what had once been a pond—now a dry, rocky basin filled with detritus. His body landed with a sickening crunch, the sound of bone against stone echoing in the night. I heard his scream, sharp and shrill, reverberating through the ruins.

The dogs moved like shadows given form, silent and impossibly fast. One bounded down the slope with terrifying agility, landing with a heavy thud. Craig tried to scramble away, but his leg was twisted beneath him, his movements frantic, desperate. His hands clawed at the earth, fingers scraping against something cold and hard—the broken remains of a pink stone gargoyle, half-buried in the mud. He was pinned, helpless.

The mastiffs pounced, their massive jaws closing around him. Craig’s screams filled the night, a sound that turned my blood to ice. I felt Jenna’s fingers digging into my arm, her breath quick and shallow, on the verge of hyperventilation.

I grabbed her, pulling her away, toward the remnants of what must have been a parlor, when I saw him.

Charles Scudder. Or the thing that had once been him.

He stepped out of the shadows, his face a ruin of flesh, eyes milky and unseeing yet somehow fixed on us with an unnatural rage. His clothes hung in tatters, filthy with dirt and mold. In his mummified hand, he clutched something—a tarnished, heavy statue, glinting dully in the moonlight. The missing statue of Mephistopheles.

Tyler stood frozen, his eyes locked onto the corpse of Scudder, a mixture of fear and acceptance flickering across his face. The dead figure raised the statue high, a grotesque reminder of Avery Brock’s sins. As Scudder’s dead eyes bore into him, Tyler sank slowly to his knees, his expression a haunting blend of resignation and dread. The statue, gripped with unnatural strength, hovered above him, casting a long shadow as if preparing to deliver the ultimate retribution for the sins of his uncle. The forest held its breath, the weight of inevitability pressing down on Tyler as he awaited his grim fate.

The crack echoed through the woods before I even saw it—Tyler’s skull splitting open under the crushing weight. Blood erupted, dark and glistening, spraying across the ruined walls and dripping in dark rivulets. But Scudder didn’t stop. His hands, wet with blood, rose and fell with mechanical precision, the statue smashing down again and again. Tyler's body twitched and jerked with each brutal impact, his flesh tearing, bones shattering under the relentless assault. The wet, sickening thuds filled the air, punctuated by the crunch of splintering bone and the soft, gurgling sounds from what remained of Tyler’s ruined head. The corpse kept beating as if driven by a fury that death couldn’t quell.

Melissa’s scream cut through the night, a sharp, keening wail that sent a shiver down my spine. She turned to flee, but the forest had already closed in, the trail swallowed by an impenetrable darkness. We were trapped, the air thick with a palpable, sinister energy. The shadows around us began to stir, creeping closer with an unsettling purpose.

Suddenly, the foliage sprang to life. Vines lashed out like serpents, wrapping around Melissa's ankles and yanking her off her feet. She clawed desperately at the ground, but the possessed plants were relentless, dragging her inch by inch toward the ruins of the old coop. Her screams grew frantic, then choked as the vines tightened around her throat, pulling her deeper into the darkness.

Melissa’s cries grew faint, lost in the dense, suffocating dark, and with a terrible finality, I knew we had lost her. Jenna’s grip on my arm was like a vice, her face drained of color, her eyes wide with a terror that seemed to pierce through me. We turned and ran—ran until our throats were raw and the muscles in our legs screamed for relief, until we burst out of the forest and straight to the truck.

We escaped….Physically.

Jenna… Jenna didn’t quite make it out.

What she saw in those last moments fractured her mind. She stopped sleeping, her eyes darting around like she could still see the shadows moving, creeping ever closer. She’d mutter to herself in the dark, nonsense words mixed with prayers, her fingers scratching at her arms until they bled. She wouldn’t eat, wouldn’t drink, just sat rocking back and forth, whispering about vines crawling up her legs, about Melissa’s face emerging from the shadows, about a voice that kept calling her name in a low, mournful wail.

The doctors tried everything, but nothing could reach her. She shrieked if anyone touched her, her hands clawing at empty air like she was fighting something only she could see. It wasn't long before they sent her to a mental health facility, her mind shattered, broken by that night at Corpsewood.

And now, I sit here, my hands trembling, trying to make sense of it all—trying to put this nightmare into words. I don't know how much time I have left. Arsinath and Beelzebub have been circling the house for two days, their black forms pacing just beyond the windows. I can feel their gaze through the walls, feel their presence thickening the air.

They’re waiting for me.
