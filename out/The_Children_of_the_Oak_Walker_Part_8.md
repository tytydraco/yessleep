[\[Part 7\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1am1nty/the_children_of_the_oak_walker_part_7/)

Cold night air whipped past my face, and I hunched low behind the angled steel plates of the armored turret.  
*Next time I get paid, I’m investing in one of those warm rabbit-fur hats in the market.*  
We’d been at it all evening, convoys of trucks driving up and down various roads with the pirates to look for tracks. Foot patrols went out around the fort, and mounted expeditions on Bone Faced Whitetail ranged even further. Darkness had fallen quickly, which meant it was safe for only the armored trucks to carry on, and so we rolled along in a slow procession through the night. Our gun turrets were equipped with searchlights, and I had to crank mine back and forth in order to scan the trees, a tedious procedure that made the minutes seem like hours. The truck’s heater was on, but that did nothing for my exposed upper half, and so I fought a continuous battle of being too hot and too cold all at the same time.  
At the vanguard of the convoy, truck one splashed through another deep pothole, and I heard Jamie curse from down inside our vehicle as we followed them across the bump.  
*“We’re going to be screwed once it starts snowing.”* Her voice echoed over the radio headsets. *“The only good roads left are ELSAR supply routes. We need to get a few truckloads of gravel from the old quarry.”*  
No sooner had she spoke, and the lead truck with Chris’s team and Peter as a guide slowed, its red brake lights gleaming in the dark.  
*“All units, this is Rhino1, we’ve got another tree down. Sit tight and watch your sectors.”* From the way Chris’s tone snapped through the radio, I could tell he was reaching the end of his patience for the day. *“And let’s keep the chatter to a minimum while we’re at it, over.”*  
This had been the third time we’d encountered obstacles on the lesser-traveled backroads of Barron County. With no repair crews out since things went parabolic, many of the tertiary roads were flooded, covered in fallen trees, or full of potholes and washouts. I’d never thought about how much work went into maintaining basic dirt roads, and with how much grass had already grown up along the berm, it wouldn’t take much for most of them to disappear completely. How much of the modern world was like that I wondered, so cheap, so temporary, so easily swallowed by nature’s wrath? How long would the abandoned houses, built from narrow pine timbers, plastic siding, and thin asphalt shingles, stay standing with no one to care for them? How long would the culvert bridges resist the rust, the wooden telephone poles stay upright in the face of rot, the road signs remain legible after months of rain and sun? Would every fragment of the old world that I’d been born into slowly erode like snow, until all that remained was an ancient shadow of what had been? What would be left of us in a year?  
*Assuming there’s anyone still alive by that point.*  
I shivered, and squinted into the dark, doing my best to push such thoughts away. Instead, I focused on the dull vibration of the diesel truck idling underneath me, the salty scent of exhaust, the rumble of engines as we waited like square metal cattle in line. Above, the night sky was overcast, black as tar, with a slight gust of wind to it. No doubt it would start raining soon, which meant I’d have to don my army-surplus green poncho that smelled like vomit from years in musty storage. Trees crowded each side of the gravel, silent and grim, their twisted branches creaking in the wind. Swirling drifts of leaves fluttered down as they were torn loose, in a kaleidoscope of red, orange, and brown.  
*“Rhino 1, this is Rhino 2.”* Jamie again called through the radio, a weary sigh in her voice. *“Looks like that storm is getting closer. We should probably head back.”*  
The chainsaws yowled from the front of the convoy, and Chris’s radio clicked on. *“We’ll reassess once we’ve finished our next grid.”*  
*“I really don’t think we should be out here in this.”* Jamie shot back, and I felt my face burn in second-hand embarrassment. Chris was our leader, and while Jamie usually kept to the customs and courtesies of ranger hierarchy, she had a nasty habit of pushing things with him.  
*“We’re going to finish our next grid sweep, and loop back.”* His words sparked with a similar level of impatience, and I was glad to be up in the gun turret, where I didn’t have to see the rest of the truck’s crew looking at me for a reaction. *“Watch your sector, Lansen.”*  
From below, someone tapped my leg, and I glanced down to see Jamie point at one of the speakers on her headset.  
“Channel 2.” She called up, and I reached up to turn the dial on mine to the second notch.  
*“Looks like we’re going to be here a while.”* Jamie snorted through her mic, channel 2 being a shorter-range frequency that we used just for our truck when we didn’t want to talk on air.  
“Yeah.” I clicked my microphone with one hand and drummed my fingers on the receiver of my machine gun, watching as distant figures at the head of the column sawed more branched from the downed tree. “I don’t think we’re going to find anything at this rate.”  
Kevin, our driver, picked up on his end with his typical dry cynicism. *“I’m still not convinced there was ever anything to find. I mean, from what you guys said, these kids are expert thieves. This could just be a trick to ambush us and grab our trucks.”*  
*“They seemed pretty genuine to me.”* Zach, our extra man who sat in the armored compartment beside my feet, piped up with his own defense. *“Besides, you saw their gear. Pretty pitiful stuff. That one kid had a flintlock, and we’ve got armor. What’s there to worry about?”*  
Thunder rolled overhead, and a fat droplet pattered down on my face, followed by a steady stream of more.  
I groaned and rested my forehead on the M249. “Of. Freaking. Course.”  
Jamie’s laugh filtered up from the truck interior, her words snide and teasing on the radio. *“Think of it like a free shower. You should’ve worn white. Maybe a wet T-shirt contest would get some of the grit out of Dekker’s craw.”*  
The others snickered at that, and I suppressed a rueful smirk to kick at the back of Jamie’s seat with my boot. Chris and I had yet to go far enough to break any of his chivalric ideals, but I doubted that he’d be in the mood to push those limits with all the stress he was under. If anything, I would rather have seen him sleep a full eight hours instead.  
Leaning down, I stretched out my hand to Zach. “Hey, I’ve got a poncho in my—”  
*Wham.*  
Behind me, truck number three rocked as a huge grey shadow flung itself out of the gloom, directly into the teeth of the vehicle’s angle-iron spikes. One of the metal pieces snapped off under the force of the blow, spinning high into the air, and landed on the roof of my truck with a shrill *clang.*  
“In the trees!” I didn’t need to be on the proper channel to hear the gunner from truck four scream, even as he swung his gun around to pour tracers into the left side of the road. “Crawlers in the trees!”  
Lithe gray shapes poured out of the forest on the left side of the road, their deep roars loud enough to be heard above the cascade of gunfire that followed. They moved with fluid ease, their muscled forelegs and shoulders propelling them at high speed, skin smooth as the birch trees that gave them their name. In the bright beam of our searchlights, I could easily make out the log-shaped eyeless head, the twig-like frills around the back of the skull, and row after row of steak-knife sized teeth. Long curved claws extended from their forelegs, curled back so they could run on their knuckles like gorillas, but they pivoted outward as the creatures leapt through the air onto our trucks.   
A mouth full of jagged teeth soared toward me from its hiding place less than thirty yards away.  
On reflex, I angled the machine gun upward, and jammed my finger on the cold metal trigger.  
*Bam-bam-bam-bam-bam-bam!*  
Spent casings and steel ammunition links scattered over the cramped turret interior, and my vision blurred with the smoke and flame that spat out the end of my weapon. Bullets stitched their way across the Birch Crawler’s tough hide, but its momentum carried it forward, like a meteorite of wood and rot.  
I let go of the gun and ducked into the truck as the Crawler’s body slammed down over top of me, shaking the entire vehicle from side to side.  
*It’s on top of the gun. If I can’t shoot, we’re dead. I have to move it.*  
However, the rest of the crew were too busy fighting to do anything about it. Jamie shouted something at Kevin, even as she slid her reinforced window down to poke the barrel of her AK out, and in the rear compartment, Zach did the same with his rifle. Kevin tried to put the heavy truck into gear, but he couldn’t turn it around for how the beasts rammed us, their long heads bashing into the sides with complete disregard to their own preservation. Everyone all up and down the line fired with all they had at the wave of mutants, who circled our convoy in gleeful bounds like they were oblivious to the deaths of their pack members. At the front, the tree lay unmoved in the road, the two chainsaws lying where they’d been dropped, not even halfway through the trunk. From where I sat, scrunched down on my heels to peer through the windshield, I could make out spatters of red over the discarded tools, and my already racing heart jumped an extra beat.  
Chris had been out there.  
Reaching up to my headset, I twisted the channel knob with shaky fingers until it clicked back to channel 1, and winced as my ears were blasted with frantic shouts.  
*“We gotta move, we gotta move, someone get us out of here!”*  
*“Gunner down, gunner down, we need a medic at truck three!”*  
*“They’re everywhere!”*  
“Chris.” I clicked my mic, dropping all radio etiquette, and braced myself against the inside wall of the armored truck. “Chris, are you okay?”  
*“Everyone shut up!”* Like lightning from the storm overhead, Chris boomed through our headsets, overtaking the airwaves. *“All drivers, back down the road until we can get clear to turn around. Gunners, button up your turrets, and keep your heads down.”*  
Glass crunched to my right, and I whirled to see a gnarled claw ram into Jamie’s window again and again, bits of layered glass chipping away with each blow.   
“Put it in reverse!” Jamie screamed into her mic and pulled her rifle inside, the Kalashnikov smoking from the sheer volume of fire.  
“I can’t see!” Kevin shouted, and the truck revved higher the more he pushed it. “They’re piled up back there.”  
A chittering growl echoed just on the other side of the armored slit, reptilian, and primordial.  
*A crowbar. I need a crowbar, something to leverage the body off the turret. There has to be something somewhere.*  
I threw backpacks and ammo cans aside, scrambled on all fours past Zach, the hot brass from his AR sprinkling down on my head as I went.  
Over the radio, Chris’s voice blared out a preset callsign with a desperate tempo. *“Hilltop, come in Hilltop, this is Rhino 1. We need immediate assistance on Alsace Road, we’ve got heavy mutant contact. I repeat, we are being overrun by freaks, we need some firepower now!”*  
“Just drive over them!” Jamie’s eyes were wild with adrenaline, and she looked out the only side mirror left on the truck, as if the ones behind her could somehow see her waving frantically. “Truck four, hurry up! Move your ass, or we die!”  
My hand bumped something cold, and I dragged a large socket wrench from under the rear seat with a gasp of triumph. “Got you.”  
With a hefty jolt, our truck heaved up and roared backward, muffled thuds and clunks echoing underneath. Kevin swore with every word he likely knew, and I glanced out the rear armored slit to see trucks three and four doing the same. We were moving at last.  
*Clank.*  
Our truck lurched to a stop, truck three’s headlights now right in our rear gun slit, and I heard the sound of metal on metal.  
*“What the . . . there’s another tree down.”* Truck four’s driver gasped through the radio. *“Guys, I’m stuck, a tree dropped behind us.”*  
Gears ground, and angry shouts ripped through the headset on my ears. *“Our lights! They just smashed our taillights, I can’t see! I can’t see!”*  
Crawlers streaked in between the moving vehicles, leaping over their dead comrades, and circling us like raptors in a dinosaur movie. They moved so fast, I couldn’t get a good look at them, but as I squinted through another firing slot, my eye caught something strange.  
A straight line.  
Jamie had taught me that nature hated lines, 90-degree angles, anything that approached intentional perfection. Nature was chaotic, wavy, irregular. So, if I was to see something in the wild with straight lines, crisp angles, or perfect symmetry, then that meant something man-made; or at least, it did before the Breach created mutations from our species’ garbage just to screw with us. Still, the law applied with most of the creatures we dealt with, and so it shouldn’t have been on the hide of a Birch Crawler.  
Despite the blood pulsing in my ear, curiosity got the better of me, and I pressed my face closer to the nearest gun slit.  
*Crash.*  
Another Crawler vaulted across the hood of truck three, after which their headlights burst in a shower of sparks and glass.  
*Smash.*  
Our taillights shattered, and I caught the grit of a rough edge dragging itself along the metal of the truck for just a split second.  
Kevin gave out a shout of terror, and I spun around to the front windshield.  
The Crawler had leapt down from a nearby mud bank and landed squarely in our headlight beam. Unabashed by our lights, the beast slunk forward, my turret gun still draped with the corpse of its brethren, and the gunner for truck one facing the opposite direction as he fired. Such boldness from these predators would have easily been enough to shock me . . . until I saw the lines.  
No, not lines.  
Straps.  
Woven from bundles of skinny grape vines, the straps circled behind the forearms of the hulking creature and cinched around its torso. They held in place a crude flap of tattered brown leather, with bits of wood stitched to it in the form of a basic saddle. Long reigns led from around the twig-like frills of the beast to its rider, and astride the Crawler’s back, sat a grinning white eyed figure.  
My adrenaline surged, but my limbs refused to move, and I clung to the back of Jamie’s seat with a death grip.  
*Please tell me I’m not seeing this.*  
Seated proudly in the rough saddle, with both gray legs hanging down around the Crawler’s muscles shoulders, the Puppet held a set of reigns made from braided thorn fronds. Male, with a bare chest covered in a mass of black-crusted scars, he grasped a long yellowish-white spear in the opposite hand, it’s point jagged and uneven. Ragged blue jeans adorned his legs, so filthy they were no longer blue, with a sash around the Puppet’s waist made from what looked like blades of multicolored grass. A string of off-white beads hung around his grimy neck, the greasy black hair still flowing down around the creature’s ears. Serrations had been chipped into the tip of his spear, and bits of the same kind of brown leather as the saddle fluttered from the end like little flags. Tiny fibers, the same kind as what lay bound to the Puppet’s waist, clung to the brown material, and my guts twisted as I realized it hit me what it was.  
Hair.  
Black, red, brown, and blonde hair.  
Unable to avert my eyes, I drank in the sight with renewed horror as it all fell into place. The spear was not one continuous piece, but a leg, an arm, a femur bound to a wrist, all twisted together with cordage and the end ground to a point. The ‘hide’ of the saddle bore a faint outline of a butterfly tattoo in one corner, slashed in half from where a skinning knife had cut through it. Those weren’t beads . . . they were human teeth on a string.  
The Puppet grinned back at me, his eyes still milky white, but with an undeniable intelligence that rippled in malic all across his gray face. He knew we were watching; knew we were afraid.  
They’d planned it this way.  
I shrunk back in paralyzing fear, as I began to understand. We’d thought ourselves safe inside our armored boxes. Like the people of the old world, we’d put our faith in our machines to save us, and now, they entombed us. True, claws and spears couldn’t breach the metal, but they didn’t need to. With our trucks hemmed in by the fallen trees, our gunner’s hatches either blocked or shut tight, and the beasts moving too fast for us to shoot them all, we were effectively no more than armed prisoners. Now, they were taking away the last advantage our kind had; lights to see in the dark.  
*Don’t do it.*  
Panic set in, and I silently begged with the malicious entity, my entire body trembling.  
*Crash.*  
With a swing, the Puppet brought his spear down on our headlights, and the shadows closed in.
