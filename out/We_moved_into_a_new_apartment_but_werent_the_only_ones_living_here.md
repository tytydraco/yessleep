In the ninth grade, my dad told us we were moving again.



By then, we’d shuffled between half a dozen shitty apartments since our mom died. I knew things wouldn’t be any different this time.



But I didn’t expect it to be worse.



As soon as our car pulled up in front of the drab Victorian three- story, my heart fell. 



“Is this all for us?” my little sister asked, eyes wide.



I shushed her and shook my head. Any place we could afford was probably Section 8, but she didn’t need to know that. “No,” I told her. “Lots of other people live here too.”



I did my best to settle in, make us comfortable. The rooms were big, drafty things, with faded wallpaper that peeled at the seams; our few belongings looked small and lonely inside them. 



Dad left us alone a lot. Sissy thought he was working, but I knew it was just as likely he was on a bender. I was always relieved when he left; when I saw his boots by the door I knew to be quiet, and careful.



It was hard to sleep in that place. Dogs barked all night, and the windows leaked cold air. The ceiling creaked when the upstairs neighbors walked around. Sometimes they yelled. 



I always kept our door locked.



I would lay in bed at night with my sister next to me, shivering under the blankets. And I dreamed we were not alone.



There was someone else in the room.



I shut my eyes tight. My heart pounded. When I opened them, there was only darkness. 



I tried to control my breathing. Told myself I made it up, or it was a nightmare. But my gut knew the truth. 



Because this wasn’t the first time I’d seen her.



Since we’d moved into the house, I realized there was something worse than a drunken father. There was something that lurked in that place, creeping around the edges of my sight, something that had been there before us. Something that lived there *with us*. 



My father never saw her, not even when I could see her almost plain as day, standing in the shadowy doorway while we ate dinner.



A normal person would scream, or run. But I didn’t.



I knew if I said something, Dad would beat me for being crazy. And Sissy would cry because we were fighting.



So I did nothing. My spoon trembled as I brought it to my lips but I would not draw attention to what I saw.



But I wasn’t the only one who saw her.



A few days later we were in the kitchen, making macaroni and cheese. It was just the two of us, but when I turned around she had set the table for three.



“Daddy won’t be home for dinner,” I said. “Its just us.”



She popped into her seat and I made her a bowl. “That’s not for dad,” she said. “It’s for the sad lady.”



I stared at her, fearful. 



She shrugged. “She probably gets hungry,” Sissy said, as she took a bite. 



I was scared, but I didn’t press the issue. I had other problems on my mind.



Dad wasn’t going to work so much now. He’d sit for hours in front of our grainy TV, not moving. The bad thing was that all the other rooms branched off the living room, and I had to creep past him to go to the kitchen, or the bathroom, or to leave. We were trapped.



I wasn’t sure what was worse, being there with him or being there without him. All I knew was that he grew more depressed by the day, and the trash clinked when I took it out.



One evening a storm rolled in. The rain pelted the window in our room, making it impossible to focus on my homework. Dad sat in his chair in the living room while we holed up in our room. Sissy rolled on the floor, carefully coloring a sheet for school.



There was a flash in the window and a distant boom, and then the house went dark. My dad yelled from his arm chair.



“Go downstairs and flip the breaker!”



There was one place I never went in that house- the basement. We had an access door in our apartment to the stairwell. It was dark down there, dirty, and damp. But mostly I didn’t like going down there because of how it made me *feel*. It was claustrophobic and stuffy and oppressively silent, but it *felt* like someone was watching my every move.



I slunk out of my bedroom, hurrying to obey before he threw something at me. I opened the door to the basement. It was pitch black. I reached back into the kitchen drawer and found a flashlight that cast a weak yellow beam, barely enough to see.



I was halfway down the steps when I noticed the light reflecting on the basement floor. A sheen. The basement was flooded with water.



But there was something else that made me stop.



Sloshing.



I stopped, frozen in place. I heard it again. I hadn’t imagined it. 



I knew, dead in my heart, that *she* was down there. I couldn’t take another step. My whole body trembled with adrenaline. I turned and ran up the stairs to the kitchen, slamming the door. But when I whirled around I was face to face with my father.



“Why is the power still off?” He asked me, softly. I gulped.



“I don’t know which switch to flip,” I lied. “You’ll have to do it.”



Irate, he pushed me aside and stomped down the stairs. He hated being inconvenienced. But I couldn't go down there. Not with her.



My chest tight, I prayed he wouldn’t see her, *couldn’t* see her. And I held my breath.



But he didn’t come back up, and the lights didn’t come back on. There was silence.



And then- a bang.



Startled, my sister shrieked in the other room. I knew something terrible had happened, but I couldn’t go down there. I cautiously picked up the phone and dialed 911. I don’t know what I said, but I know I huddled with my sister until the ambulance arrived. I covered her eyes when they wheeled dad’s body out on the gurney. 



The paramedic told me it was the old, faulty wiring in the box that electrocuted him, but I don’t believe it.



I think *she* killed him- to protect [us.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SunshineScarystories/)
