Hi, I'm A (14f), sorry if my english is not great, its my second language. I was scared of posting this on my facebook, I don't wanna any folks from Ribeirinha to found this, so I decided to put my 4 years of english school to good use. If they find out that I'm looking deeper into this, I may get in trouble with my dad or my school.

I'm from Goiania, living now in Ribeirinha, a small town on Goias, Brazil. Ribeirinha has a really religious background on its foundation. Even the name has a religious meaning, its about the saint that blesses this lands, Santa Lurdes de Ribeirinha, or Saint Lurdes of Ribeirinha. 

I moved because my dad is a doctor and recently was transfered to this town. Here we have universal health care and some professionals usually move to other towns to work for the government. My mom stayed at Goiania to take care of my grandparents, one got dementia and the other has osteoporosis. I usually travel back on weekends, so we all can enjoy some time together.

But the last week of school year, on November 21th, was a week of some group projects about the symbols of the town. I study on a private female school conected to a Convent. Most girls finish high school with some high grades on our National university program (ENEM). It's a pretty good curriculum for a small town. 

Ok, so we had that week of geography and history projects, the symbol we got (me and V and E, my bffs) was about Fertility. I drew the symbol on my notebook, aparently it is from Saint Lurdes's Notes of peace and serenity. I don't know why a saint virgin was taking notes about fertility, but it's school work, I had to take a look.

 I notice some cracks on the walls of the Covent. Under it, some insects and tiny roots. I think I cut my finger on those cracks the other day, but it was not that bad, some of it was close to the Fertility board, our main source of inspiration for the assignment.

Well, this is the part no one believed me. I was having "those days" (I hate this fr)  on November 23. While on the bathroom I looked down and one of the tiles was kinda weird. I gave it a little kick to the side and there was a flower, I think it was a lily, but there were roots next to it, like really tiny roots. It almost looked like the symbol. I'm not sure what was it, but in a blink of the eye, bum, it was gone. I almost believed the symbol bliked at me somehow. Idk what that was, maybe just 4 hours of sleep and bad cramps got me crazy.

I got to sleep now, I'll keep notes since this week I'm going back to Ribeirinha. Maybe I can show you guys my project, I got an 4/5 on it!
