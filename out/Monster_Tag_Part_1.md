I grew up on top of a mountain. I mean, literally, my house was the highest point on a mountain that was covered in redwood trees. Down one side of the mountain was a lazy looping road that broke off into many little cul de sacs all lined with normal suburban houses. On that side of the mountain in the valley below there was a quaint little town with a grocery store and a bar and a gas station. It was all very picturesque and we had tourists come through all times of the year.

The other side of the mountain was nothing but redwood forest. We had a big deck that overlooked the valley down below. You could see clear across to a mountain on the other side, and in between it was just a giant bowl of deep green spires.

Redwood trees are unlike any other tree on earth. First, they grow to truly massive heights. Logging had taken all the ancient massive trees nearly a hundred years ago, but the stumps that remained were the size of a small house. Rot hollowed out the insides of these massive monuments to nature, and we would climb around in their insides for fun. Even these younger trees had branches so big and thick that if one fell during a storm, it was called a widowmaker. They crack like gunshots and come down with the force of a speeding car. The trees collect condensation from the fog on their little stubby needles and then make their own rain for their roots, but the water that drips down is rusty red. Any t-shirt or towel you left outside would end up looking like it was part of a crime scene, and that shit stained.

It was a truly magical place to grow up. On the civilized side of the mountain, we had a few creeks, miles of truly challenging road to bike, and plenty of little trails leading to glens and meadows to explore.

Like any good 90’s kid, I had a little pack of trouble makers that all lived on our cul de sac. My driveway branched off from the cul de sac and went straight up to the little flat peak where my house was. The house directly below mine (though not connected directly by the road) was where my best friend Marnie lived. She had a little sister named Kathy. I had a little brother Kathy’s age named Dean (less than two years younger than us, Irish Twins lol), and so the four of us were the core of our little group. I’m Max, by the way. We used to carve “MMDK” into anything we could get a pair of safety scissors into.

We would ride around on our bikes, play flashlight tag after dark, come up with a million and one make believe games, and every Halloween we would steal the giant costco toilet paper pack from one of our houses and TP whoever’s house we were feuding with that year. (Our parents always caught us, because omg all the toilet paper is gone and our neighbor’s house looks like a mummy, who could have done this?) Other members came and went as families moved in and out of our little mountain top, but we four were inseparable.

Marnie was our leader. She was fearless. She would tell you to dare her to jump off something and then jump before you could. She had wild brown hair in a mess of curls, and fierce blue green eyes that always had a glint of mischief. I was truly the yin to her yang. You know that kid in horror movies who goes, “I don’t think this is a good idea guys…” Yeah, that was me. I cried easily, I always wanted to go home, I was absolutely the wimpy kid. Looking back at my school pictures, I certainly looked the part. A round cheeked nerd with glasses and a bowl cut. Thank god Marnie took pity on me. I would have been bullied mercilessly if she wasn’t there standing behind me. Dean matched Marnie’s energy much better than me. He was a little daredevil in his own right, but he had this streak of insecurity that could rear its ugly head and make him unreasonable. People used to think we were twins when we were in diapers. Two pale skinned, dark haired babies with big brown eyes. He was always big for his age, and even then he was nearly my height. He had the good sense to say no to a bowl cut, and wore his dark hair in a truly fashionable mullet (with rat tail!). Kathy was just happy to be there, bouncing behind us like a little blond duckling. She was game for whatever we wanted to do, and was quick to echo anything that she thought sounded cool. I still remember her in her brown corduroy overalls and rainbow shirt. While Dean looked older than he was, Kathy looked younger.

We used to ask our parents about the big empty valley behind our houses. My mother told me it was a boy scout camp. Marnie’s dad said it was a wildlife preserve. Both of them insisted we never go down there. Our mountain was steep, and getting down would be easy, but getting back up might be impossible.

Of course, if you tell Marnie not to do something…

It was summer vacation between fourth and fifth grade. Like all children before tablets and video games took over their lives, we were kicked out of the house after lunch and told to come back for dinner.

We milled around the cul de sac, kicking rocks and grinding sticks into the pavement.

“...I have a great idea,” Marnie had leaned into our circle with a grin. A grin I knew all too well.

“No,” I said flatly.

“You haven’t even heard it!” Marnie protested. This was a common conversation between us.

“Fine, what is it?”

“...Let’s go down into the valley…”

“...Why? We don’t have any money for candy, and it’s a pain to come back up…”

“No, not into town. Down into the valley,” Marnie motioned with her head. “That valley.”

I’d like to say I raised a big stink, but the truth was I was bored and curious too. I knew this was a bad idea, but I thought the worst that could happen would be we’d be stuck and have to get rescued. If only I’d known, I would have done anything to stop her.

We snuck between the houses and started climbing down the mountainside. It was more like controlled sliding, grabbing onto branches and rocks to keep ourselves from just tumbling down the mountain. We were filthy in minutes, and the thick forest that closed in around us blocked any landmarks from view.

“How are we going to find our way back?” I whined.

“We just have to go up,” Marnie huffed. I mean, fair enough.

It’s a miracle no one got hurt on our descent. It took probably an hour, but we couldn’t really see the sun through the trees so it's hard to know. The slope gradually lessened and lessened, and finally we were walking on flat ground.

“Just looks the same as the rest of the forest,” Dean shrugged as we poked around. 

“Yeah,” I replied with a heavy sigh, trying to slap the dirt and decaying redwood bark off of the seat of my jeans. “Another lame idea. And we’re gonna have to climb back up… Ugh.”

“Guys, over here!” Of course, Marnie had run ahead of us. We followed her voice and stepped out into a wide open meadow, blinking blearily at the bright sun now beaming down on us.

Marnie was standing on top of a huge ancient redwood stump in the dead center of the large clearing. The ferns and grass that grew thick around the edge of the meadow seemed to whiter and die as they approached the stump. I immediately got a bad feeling.

“Come check this out!” Marnie crowed, before leaping into the hollow inside of the stump.

“Wait-!” I yelled, but it was too late. She was gone inside of the hollow, rotting wood.

Kathy was already carefully climbing up the side, and Dean was trotting across the clearing to join her.

“Guys!” I called, trailing after them. “That’s not a good idea! What if there’s spiders in there? Or a snake?” Look, in my defense we had both black widows and rattlesnakes in the area, so. My concerns were not unfounded.

“It’s so cool in here!” Marnie shouted, her voice muffled from the soft mulching wood around her.

Kathy was already on top, standing on the rim around the hollow inside. “Woooow!” She gasped, and to my horror, also hopped straight in. Dean went right in after her.

“Guys!” I yelled after them. No response.

“Guys that’s not funny! Answer me!” Still nothing. I was %90 sure they were fine, but…

“You buttmunches,” I grumbled as I climbed up the giant stump. The wood was strangely smooth. I’d climbed plenty of old redwood stumps and fallen logs before, but they all had a rough almost shaggy texture to their bark. This was so smooth it was a bit hard to get a grip. The other thing I noticed was how dark the color was. It was almost black.

I finally pulled myself up onto the top of the lip around the hole in the center and peered down into the hollow stump.

Three idiots grinned up at me. They stood around a little pillar of unrotted wood that was about half way as tall as the top of the hollow. It was the perfect size and shape to jump down onto and then jump down to the floor. The bottom was full of mulch from the rotting wood, but the insides of the walls looked burnt, with black rough squares of charcoal near the top.

 

“How are you gonna get out?” I asked, as I folded my arms.

“Just jump down you wuss,” Dean teased.

“Come on, it’s really cool!” Marnie insisted.

“Yeah, you wuss!” Kathy echoed.

Look, I was like nine. Peer pressure is real. Don’t be like me kids.

I jumped into the stump.

Dean helped me climb down off the little pillar. Marnie immediately grabbed my hand and pulled me closer to one of the walls.

“Look! Check this out!” She bounced with excitement, pointing to a carving in the wall.

I leaned in to get a closer look. It was an intricate carving. A large animal? In the middle that looked like a stick figure of a bull, but the lines were more curly and pretty. Lots of little dots and flourishes. And around it in a circle were these little people figures. They were much smaller than the bull, and each had little curly lines coming off their heads almost like catholic halos. There were eight little people around the bull, I counted. All around that in a sort of square border were symbols that could be writing or could just be cool decorations.

“Isn’t that cool?” Marnie beamed, her glee growing at the same pace as my anxiety.

“Ah, I guess?” Was the best I could offer. I had not yet seen any real horror movies at that age, but I’d seen enough ‘Are You Afraid of the Dark’ and read enough Goosebumps to know a cursed carving when I saw one. “Now I’ve seen it, let’s get out of here…”

“Hey look, there’s one over here too!” Kathy called from the other side of the pillar.

“And here,” Dean added. I looked around the walls of the hallow. They were covered in carvings. 

Some part of my child brain decided that if I didn’t look at the carvings, they couldn’t curse me, so I immediately started staring straight up at the patch of sky out the top of the stump. “We have to go,” I insisted.

“Okay, okay, calm down…” Marnie recognized the panic in my voice. For all her faults, she never tried to push me truly too far, and would always pull back once she knew I was really upset.

“Aw, wussy gonna cry?” Dean, on the other hand…

“Ha ha! Cryyy,” Kathy added.

“Guys, knock it off. We need to get back before dark anyway,” Marnie chided them. They shut up but kept pulling mocking faces at me in my peripheral vision.

We managed to scrambled out of the hollow stump by giving each other boosts and pulling each other up.

I thought I would feel better in the open air, but I felt worse. It was like the air pressure suddenly changed on me, like something heavy was sitting on my chest and I couldn’t get a full breath.

Marnie put her arm around my shoulders. “It’s okay, we’re going home.”

I nodded and faked a smile, “Yeah, let’s start that climb!”

Kathy and Dean trailed behind us, snickering and occasionally fake crying. I didn’t have the energy to even be annoyed. I just needed to be out of there.

The climb back up was brutal. We had to go from tree to tree, all in a single file because only one person could be on one perch at a time. We hadn’t brought any water or food, and my throat and lungs were burning before we were even halfway up.

The loose redwood mulch was now our greatest enemy, and our feet were constantly slipping out from under us. Kathy got a bad scrape under her chin, Dean jammed two of his fingers, and I twisted an ankle. But we could not stop or give up.

Behind us, through the dense trees, something was moving.

It was subtle at first. A tumbling rock. A snapping twig. A rustling branch. Dean insisted it was a deer, the mountain was full of them. But deer always ran off once they noticed you, and we were very noisy.

Once we were well and truly exhausted, the noises changed. We started to hear a scraping, like when you rub a piece of rock against the pavement. It was a horrible noise, it set my teeth on edge. All of us looked at each other and silently started climbing faster.

The noise got louder, closer, and when I glanced back in terror, I saw the shadows in the trees behind us were somehow getting unnaturally dark. Like the sun couldn’t penetrate the redwood leaves at all. Like some black fog was rolling in after us. I missed my footing, and tumbled and slid and screamed in panic.

Dean caught me and the expression on his face is one I still see in my dreams. Animal fear. We were not children anymore, we were rabbits running from a wolf.

I barely remember the last of the climb, just a blur of pain and strain, and branches and dirt in my hands. When we burst back onto the cul de sac, the sun had just gone down. The streetlights were on, and we huddled in the pool of light of the nearest one, looking back to see if the thing would continue the chase. It didn’t.

We were exhausted, we were filthy, we were hurt and terrified and in very big trouble. I remember we were all yelled at when we got home. I don’t think any of us really processed anything our parents said. We were all so drained and blank.

That night Dean came to my room once everyone was asleep. We both sat on my bed in silence. “Can I sleep in here tonight?” He finally asked. I nodded.

He let out a big sigh of relief. “...My window… It… Looks down there, you know?”

His room was on the side of the house that faced the valley, mine was on the side that faced our driveway. I felt a chill running down my spine at the thought that something could see inside Dean’s room from the trees if it wanted.

We laid down with our heads on opposite ends of the bed. I tried to stay awake, to keep watch. But it seemed like I blinked and the morning light was streaming through my window.

Somehow the sun made me feel safe again. But seeing Dean there reminded me that the whole thing had been real, and not some terrible nightmare.

I remember lying there, with the side of my leg against Dean's, wishing with all my might that it hadn't happened. That we had been dreaming. That it was over.

But it wasn't over.
