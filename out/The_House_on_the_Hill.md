Everyone has probably had a scary childhood experience. It can be anything, whether it slightly freaks you out, or scars you for life. But what about something so horrifying, so bizarre, so unbelievable that you’re not even sure it actually happened at all?

My name is Chris, and this is something that happened 3 years ago on Halloween when I was 11 years old. I’m 14 right now, so forgive me if this isn’t very well written.

Me and my two neighborhood friends, Dylan and Fred, gathered together at my house, planning to go trick-or-treating together. They were both the same age as me, and we always got along pretty well.

On Halloween night, we got our costumes and candy buckets, really excited to set out. I was wearing a medieval knight-looking costume, Dylan’s costume was a skeleton, and Fred’s costume was, weirdly enough, an inflatable cow.

We all met up and my front yard and started chatting. Dylan had a flashlight and was gonna light the way for us.

Dylan: “Bffft! Fred, what the hell is that costume?”

Fred: “A cow. Got a problem with that?”

Chris: “Nah, it’s great! Just a bit goofy.”

Most of what happened that night isn’t noteworthy. We stopped by houses and gathered as much candy as possible. Really nothing that interesting. The important thing is what happened right before we were about to be done.

Chris: “We got every house in the neighborhood! And look how much candy we have!”

Dylan: “Hell, yeah!”

Dylan swore a lot, because it made him feel like a badass. We all started walking back to my house to hang out and eat some candy, until we noticed a house in the distance that we haven’t visited yet.

Dylan: “Ooh, another one! C’mon!”

Fred: “That house looks so creepy…”

C: “Y’know, I always forget that house even exists. It’s, like, slightly outside the neighborhood. It might be private property or something.”

The house was on top of a tall hill.

Chris: “Well, that’s weird. Anyways, let’s go.”

I continued walking, clearly not interested. Dylan immediately grabbed my shoulder and pulled me back.

Dylan: “Hey, you’re not going anywhere! Let’s go check it out!”

Dylan was the daredevil of the group, always doing things that seemed dangerous, either to impress us, or because he just wanted to be the leader. Fred was like his minion, always doing what he said without questioning anything. I actually thought for myself, though. I often questioned Dylan’s logic, but we usually just did whatever he said.

Chris: “But I’m so tired of all the walking, and it looks so damn creepy!”

Dylan: “But we might hit the jackpot! It could be one of those houses that gives out king sized chocolate bars!”

Fred: “Hmm… fair enough. Let’s do it.”

Chris: “I don-“

Dylan and Fred were already making their way to the house before I could finish.

Before long, we made it to the top of the hill and stood there in front of the house. It looked very old, and it was made entirely of wood. We all stepped onto the porch and said “Trick-or-treat!” in unison. Then we waited.

About a minute passed and there was still no answer. Normally, anyone in this situation would just go back home and forget about it. That’s what I was thinking, at least. But we were with Dylan, so that wasn’t an option. He turned the knob and opened the door, about to enter.

Chris: “Dylan, what the hell are you doing? If they don’t answer, then there’s probably nobody home. You can’t just waltz in like that, ya moron!”

Fred: “But look! There’s a lamp on right there!”

Chris: “That doesn’t me-“

They were both already inside, signaling for me to follow them. I let out a frustrated sigh and entered the house with them. I didn’t want to, I just felt like I had to. I was really worried, but they looked excited like this was gonna be awesome. There was a staircase, and no others rooms. Dylan aimed his flashlight down the staircase and just walked down without a care in the world, Fred following behind him. I stayed slightly backed farther away from them.

It was real dark down there, and it smelled awful. When we made it to the bottom, the smell was even stronger. I pitched my nose shut and noticed Dylan and Fred did the same. On the floor was a pentagram.

We were all a bit freaked out by that. Dylan then turned his flashlight to the left of him, revealing the source of the smell. We all gasped.

It was a corpse, covered in blood. Wearing a red robe and a black beaked plague doctor-like mask. Its chest was ripped open with the ribs protruding out, and one of its legs was bent the wrong way.

Things just went from 0 to 100 instantly. I started hyperventilating and Fred took a step back towards the stairs.

Chris: “Holy shit…”

I usually didn’t swear, but I was just so shocked at that moment.

Dylan started breathing heavily. “W-We gotta get the fuck out of here! RUN!” He turned his flashlight a bit more, revealing more bloody corpses, with the same red robes. I then heard a noise that almost made my heart stop.

Chewing.

I froze completely. That was the most scared I had ever been. I felt a tear roll down my cheek as Dylan and I staring booking it up the stairs. I heard footsteps following behind us as we ran. Right as we made it to the top, I looked behind me.

A humanoid figure crawling on all fours, with the head of a dear, and razor sharp teeth. Its mouth was covered in blood, and its antlers scraped against the walls as it chased us.

I screamed in horror as we ran for the door. The creature let out an ear piercing screech as it leaped towards us, and we slammed the door shut. I heard a loud THUD as it crashed into the door and we ran as fast as we could back to my house. I was so scared that I didn’t care how tired my legs were.

Thankfully, we all made it out alive. We told our parents, and they called the police. That’s all I remember from that night. The next day, I saw the house surrounded by police cars. Soon after that, we moved to another neighbhood.

Although I didn’t get a good look at it, the image of that deer-headed monster still haunts my mind. I still have trouble believing it was even real. What if it was all just a dream? I don’t know, but I’ve never been trick-or-treating since that night.
