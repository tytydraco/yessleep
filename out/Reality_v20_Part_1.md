I’m not sure how to start this. It’s funny, you spend all day with these thoughts shifting through your brain, but then the moment you set down to put them on paper, everything leaves you. Ok, I guess to keep it simple, I’ll start at the beginning. Or at least, what I think is the beginning. 

I’ll start with the first thing I can remember. It was the water…but also, it was the feeling surrounding it. It’s how all memories become, the dimensions of reality collapsing into bas-relief, a snapshot in time. As I sit here trying to think back as far as I can remember, I’m realizing that the totality of my life now belongs to me as a string of images and impressions pinned to a single fragile string stretching backwards into infinity, anchored perhaps in the heart of a star. 

The oldest picture that I can reach is the moment of my death. My legs are stretched out in front of me, and I’m wearing my favorite jeans, the ones with the hole pre-cut into the right knee in a gaudy attempt to look worn. The steering wheel is in front of me too, but my hands are floating several inches above it. Everything, I realize, is floating. I am suspended in the crystalline lattice of this moment like a chunk of meat in a jello mold. I am trapped in that weightless ticklish belly feeling of free-falling, and I will never get relief. I am forced to look in horror at the water rushing up to meet the windshield. And everything else, the smell of the hot coffee spilling across the passenger seat, the sound of rushing air mixed with a pathetic whining ripping itself from my throat, is congealing into a single impression in my mind. 

The next thing is fuzzier, less distinct. It’s funny, but the older you get, the more life you live, the more it seems like your brain stops pausing to take those snapshots. Everything from early times used to come at me fast, a staccato rhythm of memories as frantic as a paparazzi’s trigger finger. But now, everything is different. It feels like each new memory is a sacrifice. I once had a coworker (I least…I think he was a coworker? He might have been my Uncle, or..?) tell me that his mind was like so many penguins squeezing onto an iceberg; every time a new penguin jumped up, it pushed another one off. That is what life is like for me now, an endless exchange of penguins while I desperately clutch to the few things that once held meaning. But I’m getting distracted again.

The next thing. That was waking up in a hospital bed. I can remember the feel of the too-stiff industrial cotton under my fingertips, and the pounding in my head. The room was bright in that sanitized way that makes your breath catch. There was a man looming over me. He had crisp, clean professional clothing and a white jacket. He wore a kind smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes. 

“Mrs. XXX? Emily?” he was asking. My head swam, I struggled to focus on his voice. The world was slipping from me like sand through my limp fingers.

“Do you know where you are right now?” he pushed.

I shook my head softly, tried to mouth the word “no” but no voice came.

“That’s ok. You’re in the hospital, Ruthford General” he offered. For a long moment he paused, seemingly searching my face for something…a sign of recognition? When he didn’t find what he was looking for, he continued.

“It’s Tuesday today. You’ve been asleep since you were brought in last Friday. You were in an accident, nearly drowned. Luckily someone spotted your vehicle and was able to get you here. You’re lucky to be alive.”

I shook my head numbly. His words were all there but I struggled to make meaning from them. All the components made sense: hospital, car, drowning; but I couldn’t piece them together, to lay them on the larger backdrop of my life. I realized with a start that I couldn’t remember who I was.

Evidently seeing the terror in my eyes, the young Doctor reached out to grab my hand where it lay numbly at my side.

“Hey, it’s ok. I’m sorry, I know that’s a lot to take in. For now, just know that you’re safe. You’ve got a long road ahead, but you’ll have support every step of the way.” 

I swallowed heavily and nodded, tears prickling at the corner of my vision. And that’s it, the little stage-play in my mind fades to black with the stabbing globus sensation rising high in my throat.

The next pieces are…better? Little photos of me, surrounded by friends and family. There are yellow carnations on the table beside my hospital bed. Someone said they were my favorite…from before? I think that makes sense, perhaps still does, I don’t know. Something yellow at least, chrysanthemums, because I liked the name?

It doesn’t matter. In the pictures I’m smiling, because I’ve gotten my memories back. At least, I *think* that’s what's happened. I can’t recall the memories themselves, I just know I had the *feeling* of remembering in those pictures. I remember the sensation of slipping back into my skin like falling into a warm bath, a balm for the previous soul-deep ache. But now I’m looking at the pictures again and I can see the outlines of the figures around me but the faces are blurred and…oh god, I can’t remember their faces, my own parent’s faces, oh my god…

No. This is why I’m doing this. I’m keeping a record here, something immutable, something to anchor myself to in this storm. Here, in this place, in this time, the internet is forever, right?

I’ve heard it said that one technique people will use when attempting to lucid dream is to write something on their hand. Throughout the day you must tell yourself to look at the word, read it and assure yourself that you’re still awake. In your dream, this should subconsciously prompt you to look at your hand, except you won’t be able to read it; this *supposedly* will make you aware of the dream and thus able to control it.

The trouble is, I *can* read in my dreams. It’s just that the words keep changing when I glance away from the page. So maybe, if I can list things as I know them to be true here, then if anything shifts, I can catch it and know? Or maybe control it, stop *it* from happening again. The next time something shifts, something is *wrong*, I’ll catch it faster and move on….or…at least know. But I’m getting ahead of myself again. 

So…the first time *it* happened was in that hospital too. I was laying in bed. I don’t know what time it was, but I can assume that it was late at night, because the normal raucous bustle of the hospital day had settled into the calm din of hospital night. The television hung in the corner was on, playing some infomercial for a set of spoons with huge holes in the center. The sound was muted, but for a moment I sat and watched as the announcer on TV made a big show of dipping them into soup, only for most of it to pour through the middle before he could bring it to his lips. Unperturbed, he continued trying again and again and again. Somewhere in the distance a man coughed, and a machine beeped, but to my tired brain it sounded more melodious than monotonous; if I focused, I thought I could pick out the tune of an icecream truck composed entirely from high-pitched IV alarm chir-chirrups. My hospital room had a window taking up most of the wall to my right. I tried to peer beyond it, but everything was black. No moon hung to catch the welded corners of skyscrapers, no headlights of cars reached their greedy fingers through the gloom, not so much as a phantom reflection from inside the hospital room itself. Just pure, inky black.

“I have to get out of here” I thought, and the terror was fast and ice-cold and unforgiving.

The first touch of my bare feet on the floor was torture. Weeks in a hospital bed with little sleep and even less food had left me weak. I remember the way the hospital gown clung to my pitiful frame as I stood, legs quaking beneath me, holding on to an IV pole for dear life. The burning in my legs was enough to almost make me give up, crawl back into bed and pretend this was just another bad dream. But it wasn’t. I knew that in the way that everyone just *knows*, right? Of course you know. And that window with its wrongness, and the way this room was just a bit too tall, the walls just a bit too white, light someone had constructed it based on how someone else described the idea of a room.

I forced myself forward, one foot and then another, all the while inching that IV pole forward on two wheels, terrified that it might slip out from under me at any moment. By the time I reached the door I was already exhausted, pale and sticky; the feel of my sweat sliding down my bare back made me shiver. But that was nothing compared to what lay just beyond that door.

It wasn’t just the room. This place, this entire hospital was wrong. Beyond my room’s door a single hallway stretched off into the distance. The walls canted at odd angles, coming together in seemingly impossible patterns, stretching here and thinning there as if reflected in a funhouse mirror. No lights were on, save for the single green “EXIT” sign that hung above the solitary door at the end of the hallway, its phosphorescent glow casting everything in sickly sharpness. With a grunt of effort I forced my protesting body forward. There were no other hospital rooms, but etched along the walls here and there I could make out the faint outline of a door frame. More than once I passed a picture frame hanging on the wall, but instead of some generic hospital art of a flower or a rainbow, the frames were empty. By the time I reached the end of the hall and stood in front of that door, my body was shaking so hard I worried that I might rattle my joints loose. 

The feeling of the cool metal bar of the exit under my fingers when I reached out to touch it felt like deliverance. And beyond the door? I could faintly hear what sounded like the happy chatter of voices, mixed with….industrial sounds? No, more like…a blender? I pressed the bar down, and as the door cracked open, the smell that rushed to greet me was a warm one, coffee and fresh bread. I fell more than pushed into it.

And all at once I was on the other side. And my bones didn’t ache, and my feet weren’t cramping in the cold. I was standing at my full height, and, I realized all at once, wearing my favorite blue jeans, the ones with the hole in the left knee. Above that, a warm auburn sweater, though I could only see pieces of it from behind the black apron slung around my neck. When I looked up, it was to the scene of a coffee shop. The room was warm, but something in the quality of the light beyond the windows revealed it to be a crisp fall day. The place was packed with customers, sitting at tables, pushed into little nooks around the edges, leaning against the counters with their drinks and purses and phones. 

“Did you find it?” came a voice to my right. It took me several long minutes to realize it was talking to me, something which evidently annoyed it.

“Hey, dude, wake up” it pressed. I turned to see a flustered brunette in a white tank top and jean shorts that were somehow both Mom-ish and far too taut.

“Did you find it?” she repeated, punctuating each word with a frantic glance behind her towards the, I presume, waiting customer.

“F-Find what?” I asked. My voice sounded foreign to my ears. 

“Emily, dear lord, what were you even doing back there?” she asked, heat rising in her eyes as the woman behind her sighed dramatically.

“Back there?” I ask. 

When I turned around I found a metal door with a small window set into it. Beyond the window, a completely ordinary storage room with rows of boxes pushed haphazardly onto its shelves. Completely, totally normal. An ordinary storeroom in an ordinary coffee shop on a complete ordinary fall day.

*Where am I?*

It wouldn’t be the first time I asked myself this question.
