I stood trembling near her grave, the love of my life. Life without her felt worthless. I'll do anything for her. Never leave her alone. I promised.

"Anything," I said as my shovel hit something solid. My clothes were all covered in dirt, sweat running down my forehead.

"Hold on tight, darling, you'll be back home soon." I dropped the shovel and pulled out a black plastic bag I had hidden under my waist.

I had to do it. The smell of rotten flesh struck my nostrils as I opened the bag. I wanted to throw up right there.

I reached in and pulled a few small pieces of... meat. A tongue, two eyes, a heart. He said it had to be someone young.
Don't ask me how I got it. Don't. I placed them near her coffin and got out of the hole and filled it back. I still couldn’t believe I was doing this. But I had to. If I wanted her back.

"Don’t look back no matter what," I said to myself as I readied to leave. This was one of the rules he mentioned. I straightened my gaze and started walking. I was almost near the gate when—

"Daddy, please help, I'm hurt."
I turned back in panic. It sounded like my daughter.

"How did you get..."
Nothing. I sighed. I was almost out the main door.

I opened the door and walked into the house. It felt colder than usual. I wasn’t hoping for anything to change but then I heard it.

"Honey, where have you been all this time? I was waiting."
I couldn’t believe. It was her voice. I turned back, and there she was. Beautiful as ever.

"I, I had some work. Had to fill in for a friend," I said, trying to hide my surprised look.

"Well, you look all dirty and banged up. Go get a shower. I’ll get the dinner ready," she said with that warm smile.

"Uh, yeah I... I’ll go do that," I said and was about to leave when I heard a scream.

"What... what is that, Daddy?" she almost shouted.

"Oh, I... I forgot to tell you, baby. Mommy is back."

"That's not Mommy, Daddy. What are you talking about?" she said, taking a few steps back before running back to her room.

"Uh, kids these days. Don’t know what’s gotten into her today."
Emma smiled.

I stared at her beautiful face, sleeping beside me. It all went fine after all. She made the meal. My daughter wouldn’t come to the dinner table, so I brought her plate into her room. She said it wasn’t Mommy. That she looked scary and dead. Maybe she can’t believe it too. Must be hard for her.
But she was here. Beautiful.
I stared, and stared till I fell asleep.

I woke up. Don’t know what time of the night it was, but something felt wrong. I couldn’t move. I slowly looked up, and a silent scream left my mouth.

There was... something—no. It was Emma.
But not beautiful.
Her skin, grey and bloated. Eyes bulged out. Clothes covered in dirt. Blood running from her mouth.
"This... this can't be real."

I jolted up from the bed but—she was there. Still sleeping. But maybe I woke her up.

"Babe, is everything okay?" she asked. "Why are you sweating so much?"

"Uh, nothing. Bad dream," I said, getting back on the bed.

"Oh, I’m so sorry. It must be the stress from work."

"Yeah, probably," I said. "Go back to sleep, babe. I didn’t mean to wake you up." I laid back down and closed my eyes.

The morning felt pleasantly warm. Emma was already out of bed.

"She must be making breakfast," I said and got up to go to the bathroom.

I opened the bathroom door, and what I saw took my breath. I couldn’t walk another step and collapsed on the floor.
My daughter laid lifeless on the floor, surrounded by blood. Her blood.

"How..." I cried, crawling forward to hold her lifeless body.
"No. No. No. It can’t be. Wake up. Please, no."
I cried.

I heard the bathroom door creak open behind me. Then a voice. Familiar. But wrong. Calm but piercing. Like glass breaking.

"You should've let me rest."
