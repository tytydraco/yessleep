So over the past couple weeks I’ve been really wanting a pet. I’d love a dog but, I think it’s a little bit too much responsibility for me right now so I decided a cat would be better. I was looking at pet finder multiple times a day in search for the perfect furry little companion. I really wanted an orange cat but, as it turns out, those are few and between. However, there was an abundance of one eyed cats. My girlfriend had been looking too and also noticed how many one eyed cats there were for adoption, specifically in my area. After she pointed that out, we realized 1 in every 5 cats had a missing eye. All the left eye too. I didn’t think much of it - chalking it up to feisty street cats getting into fights. 

A few days after that, my girlfriend brought her dog over for the day. She’s been over a thousand times but, this time her dog was acting really weird. She wouldn’t stop sniffing under my roommates closed door. We tried to distract her with toys, treats, even offered a walk for her still, nothing would deter her from that door. So we finally decided to let her in and so she could get the sniffing out of her system. As soon as we opened the door she bolted straight to the closet so we opened the closet and her nose brought her directly to a lose floor board that she was frantically clawing at in an effort to lift it up. When I lifted the floor board what I saw was so shocking it took everything in my power not to faint just looking at it. A jar of cat eyes… There’s must’ve been a dozen if not more. And as I left the room in a complete panic I noticed a watermelon baller sitting on his desk that’d been missing from a kitchen drawer for a few months now. As if the jar of eyes alone wasn’t enough, the thought of him scooping eyes out of those poor little cats sockets was so horrifying my stomach dropped and I couldn’t help but to run to the bathroom and projectile vomit everywhere. 

Oh yeah, and did I mention this wasn’t just some random roommate, this has been my best friend for over 12 years. On top of all that, he was so adamant about me getting a cat for the house and would send me multiple available cats a day (with both eyes). Was he planning on doing this to my potential cat? How long has he been doing this for? Will he get bored of cats eventually and move on to dogs? Or worse yet, humans!?! Every serial killer series I’ve watched (which is a lot) they always start out with animals. I’m so scared it could get worse, is it too late for help?This happened only a few hours ago and my roommate won’t be home from work for another couple of hours… WTF DO I DO?
