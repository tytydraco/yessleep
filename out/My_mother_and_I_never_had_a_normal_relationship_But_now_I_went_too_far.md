In the shadows of my childhood home, within the walls that keep all my secrets, I have to face something I thought would come later. She was always very active, and by that I don’t mean she treated her body like a temple; I’d even say the opposite. She made use of the vessel she was given and made sure to return it well worn. Her mind was always sharp, probably the most intelligent woman I ever met. For better or worse, that marked my destiny from the day I arrived screaming and kicking, held in her arms, covered in her blood.

My mother was an imposing woman, with a strong character and very strict. I wish I could tell you something about my father, but I don’t know him.
“You’re an exact copy of him. Unfortunately, you also inherited his charm,” she would say.

She always told me he was a hopeless idiot, but she didn’t want me to follow that path. Every week she gave me a book to read, and on Sunday nights she tested me. The books grew harder week after week, with no breaks for holidays. If I failed, the punishment was harsh. But the reward I got when I passed made me forget any correction.

That demand paid off. I grew up to be a writer with moderate success, a comfortable living, and the respect of my peers. So what’s the downside? What’s wrong with it? I’m condemned to keep up the act for the rest of my life. Before leaving home, I have to put on my disguise of a normal person, adjust the mask so it doesn’t fall and reveal my deformity to others.

Only the night and the monsters that live in it—those of us who live in it—have the stomach to look me in the face, to caress it, to kiss it. They understand me. And it’s not just because of the reward I leave on the nightstand; I’m not that naive. I know there isn’t enough money or jewels to buy what I desire. Something sacred, meant only for those who know nothing of good or evil, for the truly pure of heart.

With the years, my deformity grew like a tumor feeding on my shame and misery, caused by itself. It was no longer just about recreating and getting what my mother no longer gave me; it went further. I crossed the line. There, where my fetishized fantasy met my hatred and contempt, they mixed like blood and mother’s milk over the belly of that woman, in that forgotten hotel up north.

And today, as my mother needs my attention and care, the way she once gave me hers, I can’t give it. It’s too late. The tumor has long metastasized, spread through my whole body, and any trace of humanity is gone. My deformity is exposed.

And now, the hundreds of books we read, the body that gave me life, and this sickness will be nothing more than food for moths and flies.
