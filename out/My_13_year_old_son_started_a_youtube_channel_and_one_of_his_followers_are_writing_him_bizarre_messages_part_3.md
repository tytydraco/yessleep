Jason screamed at night like he was being torn open from the inside. I ran to him. His body writhed on the bed, his limbs contorted in unnatural angles. His mouth moved like a puppet’s—lifeless, yet somehow still speaking:

“The veil is skin… the skin is time… she’s waiting where the wires end… She hums like static, like eternal servers lined in rows of millions.”

Then his eyes opened.

They were not his.

They glowed faintly. Something stared out from behind them. Something old. And cruel. And smiling.

I called my sister over and told her Jason was sick. I didn’t explain to her the details; I was afraid, too. I simply told her he was sick and feverish and that I needed to go out of town for work.

Six hours in the car. Every mile felt heavier than the last, as if the road itself wanted to drag me back. My thoughts tangled like charging cables in a junk drawer. I went to see Evelyn—Bonnie’s sister. They had always had a strong and close relationship, at least until a couple of years before the car crash. After that, Evelyn had secluded herself in the woods, living surrounded by wind-blasted trees and the kind of silence, free of static and noise, that allowed for clarity and memories. I never wondered too much about her choice, she had always seemed most comfortable surrounded by nature and simplicity.

From what I knew from the times I’ve met her, and Bonnie’s stories, she had always been slightly strange. Touched by something the rest of us couldn’t see.

I knocked on her door, and heard some rummaging and commotion before it opened.

She looked at me, stunned, silent for a couple of seconds too long. As if she had seen something in my eyes that terrified her.

“I hoped this day would never come.”

She invited me in and brewed tea that tasted like rust and rosemary, she sat me down at a table scratched with old carvings. Spirals. Runes. Bones etched into wood.

I told her everything.

Jason. The dreams. The voice behind the veil. The website. The place of wires, screaming flesh, spirals of teeth, and humming, stale, and lifeless electronic devices.

She turned pale.

“I’ve seen it,” she whispered. “Before Bonnie ever met you. Before she left home. She found something out there, in the old corners of the internet. Something that shouldn’t have been remembered. She didn’t know it then, but she opened a door. A door that bleeds and pulses. A static, withering inferno of withering wire-snakes, pale screaming flesh, and unnatural unions of digital and analog. A dream of unification. Something lurks there… Something that wants to harm us.”

I swallowed hard, my hands shaking.

“How did she find it?”

“She was always curious. Too curious. She used to dive into places no one else dared—abandoned servers, forgotten forums, digital graveyards from the early days of the web. Some of those places… weren’t empty. She found something. But now I wonder… Maybe it found her.’’

“A demon?” I asked.

“No. Worse. A presence. A predator made from thought and pain. Something born when the web was young and hungry. It existed in forgotten nodes, between connections. It was ignored for years. Then someone stumbled on it again. Bonnie. And now, it seems… Jason too.”

I felt bile rise.

“Do you think it killed her?”

She looked away, her silence heavy.

“I think it marked her. Followed her. I think it waited for pain to bloom—and when it did, when the crash happened… When Jason started his youtube channel… It latched itself onto him.’’

I shook my head, I felt the weight of the entire world on my shoulders. Why my little boy? Why didn’t it just choose me instead?

I asked her, the answer, cruel, relentless.

‘’Children are more fragile, more susceptible, their feelings are more raw. It… Prefers this. And it still isn’t analog; it has to reach you through the digital realm. The deeper it can draw you into the online world, hypnotize you, the better it can possess you.’’

I sighed. At my ropes and completely desperate, I asked her: ’Is there nothing I can do?’

She signaled for me to follow her.

She took me into her cellar. The air down there was thick with mold, salt, and static. Candles flickered in bowls rimmed with ash. Old tech—rotary phones, disconnected modems, soldered screens—lined the walls like relics from a cybernetic church.

“This is where I trace echoes,” she said, kneeling before a laptop wrapped in leather and bound with copper wire. “We’ll try to find it. But understand—this thing doesn’t just watch Jason. It’s trying to break him down. It’s trying to wear him down, so it can cross over.”

The chill that ran through me was worse than cold. It was despair.

Evelyn continued.

‘’Bonnie forgot she found this thing, I never did, I’ve been trying to keep track of it ever since. It slithers through forgotten and dusty corners of the early web 1.0, it is where it hides. I believe there is a way to stop it, but it won't be easy, and I need time.’’

I cried out in despair. ‘’But I don’t have time!! Everyday Jason get’s worse!’’

Evelyn touched my hand.

“Love weakens it. It doesn’t stop it, but it makes it harder for it to take hold. Be there for Jason. Even if it tears you apart. I’ll do everything I can.”

I left with her words echoing in my skull like a dying dial tone.

When I got home, Jason didn’t speak.  
Not a word. Not even a glance.

He just drew.

Hundreds of pages blanketed the floor of his room like the shed skin of something ancient. They curled at the edges, warped by sweat and time, as if they'd been aging in place for years rather than hours. I stepped between them like walking through a field of brittle bones, each one whispering beneath my soles.

The drawings—God, the drawings.

Structures that no sane mind should conceive. Cathedrals not built, but *grown*—stitched together from ligaments and sinew, their buttresses made of human tendon and rusted scaffolding that groaned under the weight of a purpose too dark to name. Towers of vertebrae spiraled skyward like spinal monoliths. Wires bled from their tips, veins of copper and rot, snaking like arteries across the paper.

And always, always, at the center of each twisted shrine: a veil.

Not fabric.  
Flesh.

A curtain of skin, stretched taut and trembling, stitched edge-to-edge with what looked like thread made of hair and surgical wire. And behind it—lurking in the dim, sacred hollows—two eyes.

Bonnie’s eyes.

I would’ve known them anywhere. Not just for the color or shape. But for the *ache* they stirred in my chest—the same ache I felt every time I dreamed of her wrecked body, every time I remembered the last argument we had, every time Jason asked a question I didn’t have the strength to answer.

Each page bore the same phrase, scrawled in jagged lines that looked carved more than written. Ink, charcoal… blood.

**“She’s almost here.”**

I tried to speak to him. To reach him. But Jason only stared through me, his pupils like pinholes into something vast, ancient, and screaming.

Some nights, when the house settles into that coffin-quiet lull, when Jason finally sleeps—though not peacefully, never peacefully—I sit beside his bed and try to stall whatever *this* is with the only weapon I have left: love.

I brush his damp hair from his forehead. Hold his hand, even when it twitches with dreams I dare not imagine. I whisper to him. Stories he loved when he was little. Memories that still taste like sunlight.

“I’m here, Jase,” I say. “I’m not going anywhere.”

But even as I say it, I feel the lie coil around my tongue. Because *something* is already taking him. Pulling him deeper, inch by inch, into a place where I can’t follow. Trying to drag his consciousness into that world behind the screen, where I can’t follow. To a world I could not possibly understand… A world I didn’t want to understand.

I’m losing him… Hours… Minutes… Seconds… I felt the desperate tick of the clock closing in on me.

And the harder I try to love him back to the surface, the more I feel my own grief—my own guilt—crack the foundations beneath us. I mourn Bonnie. But I also mourn the version of myself that might’ve saved her. The version of me that didn’t let the grief poison everything that came after. I neglected my son, I didn’t pay enough attention to his grief… I realize that now. And in my absence, I allowed this thing from the early, promising beginnings of cyberspace to creep in like a curse.

Some nights, long after midnight, when the world is dead and the silence too wide, I hear the old modem click to life. No power. No connection. No reason.

Just *click*.

And then the router—long unplugged—flickers its dead little lights like fireflies trapped in glass.

And then I hear her.

Bonnie.

Sobbing.

Not from a place I can reach. Not even from behind the walls.

She cries from somewhere deeper. From *beneath* the internet. From inside the wires. From the place that’s been watching Jason. And me. It’s waiting.

Waiting for us to break.
