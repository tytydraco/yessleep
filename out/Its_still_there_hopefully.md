For some clarity I’ve lived in the countryside next to a cornfield for about 13 years now and my mother left me and my father when I was 2. I‘ve always loved the countryside because it was quiet but then the deers stopped coming by, everything that lived just stopped they vanished. My father started to notice too, or atleast that’s what It seems like. But I decided to search I went into the cornfield in the morning and heard “Hello you“ exactly what my mother used to say to me so I looked and I looked cheering with joy as I tried to find her and i heard “look up” and I see it. Not human, Not my mother, Not even possible describe it reached for me as I grabbed it, pushed it and ran I yelled for my dad as he walked out to grab his gun, we run inside and block the door and we hear “bang bang bang” it was trying to break the back door my dad told me to go to the basement so I did I heard gunfire and screams then I heard it…

The basement door creak as it was being forced open, so I did the only logical thing I opened our basement window and ran to the nearby police station, they rushed to my house and found blood on the corn crops, not from be though they found forced entry from the back door and basement door my dad on the ground, at first I didn’t know he was my dad… that’s how bad it was and his shotgun 2 rounds out of 5 empty, I am now living with my aunt and her entire family but whatever that was is unexplainable The days that followed felt blurry. My aunt and uncle were kind, but their house was loud. So many people, so much talking. It was the opposite of the quiet I always knew. I mostly stayed in my room, staring at the walls. Sleep didn’t come easy. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that thing in the cornfield.

heard my mother’s voice twisted and wrong. Then I’d hear the bangs on the door, the gunshots, my dad’s scream. The police asked me questions, gentle ones. I told them what I saw, what I heard. They listened, took notes. They didn’t say they didn’t believe me, but I could see it in their eyes. How could they? It didn’t make any sense. They never found what did that to my dad. They searched the cornfield, the woods around our house. Nothing. No tracks that weren’t human, no sign of anything out of the ordinary, except for the blood on the corn stalks. They said animals could have done that, but I knew it wasn’t animals. My aunt tried to get me to eat, to come downstairs. Sometimes I did, sitting quietly at the table while my cousins chattered about school and friends. It felt like a different world, one I didn’t belong in anymore.

One evening, my uncle sat with me in my room. He didn’t try to make me talk. He just sat there, a silent presence. After a while, he said, “It’s okay to be sad. It’s okay to be scared. What happened… it was bad.”

His simple words made something loosen in my chest. I didn’t cry, but I felt a little less numb.

Weeks turned into months. The seasons changed. The cornfield next to our old house was harvested, the stalks gone. It looked empty, harmless. But I knew better. Something had been there. Something had taken my dad. I started having nightmares. I’d wake up sweating, heart pounding, the echo of those bangs on the door still ringing in my ears. My aunt would come in, sit with me until I calmed down. Slowly, I started to do small things. Help with dishes, walk to the mailbox. The noise of the house still bothered me, but I was getting used to it. It wasn’t the quiet of the countryside, but there was a different kind of comfort in knowing I wasn’t alone.

I knew I would never forget what happened. It would always be a part of me. But maybe, someday, the fear wouldn’t be so sharp. Maybe, someday, I could find a new kind of quiet, one that wasn’t filled with the memory of a monster in the cornfield. But then… I heard it the sound of IT again it was behind me.
