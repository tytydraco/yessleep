I made Halloween costumes for my kids. In the past, this was something my wife and I did together. It was a tradition. Sadly, my wife passed away recently, so this year’s Halloween felt heavy. I wanted to make it extra special for the kids – an exercise in futility, I know – but you can’t blame a dad for trying.   

  

My kids are eight and twelve: Nick, the oldest, is my son, and Edith is my eight-year-old daughter. Great kids. After watching Wizard of Oz for the umpteenth time, Edith decided to dress up as Glinda the Good. With the aid of many Youtube tutorials, I stitched up a sparkling witch’s costume. It looked splendid.

 

Then there was Nick’s costume.   

  

Nick was adamant: he wanted to be a robot for Halloween. He loves robots. Always has. Seemed harmless enough.


Little did I know.


For starters, we needed a large box for the body. Fortunately, I’d recently purchased a new dishwasher, so I used the box it came with. Fit like a dream. I found a smaller box for the robot’s head. Many other objects were required: flexible ducts, a Slinky, glass bottles and caps, spray can lids, and a plethora of throw-away computer parts. Plenty of tinfoil and silver spray paint were also used.

  

The kid's costume looked fantastic. Nick was ecstatic. His big blue eyes blew up like balloons. I’d truly outdone myself. 

  

The day before Halloween, their school had a costume party. Edith, who’s both stubborn and shy, refused to dress up. I wasn’t surprised; she’d been acting out lately, ever since her mother died. Nick, on the other hand, couldn’t contain his excitement. 


When he came down for breakfast that morning, I nearly died. His costume seemed so realistic; it fit him like a dream. The lights attached to his chest were blinking, and the gauges were moving. (Did I attach a battery?) His face was painted to precision. You’d be hard pressed to recognize him. He even walked like a robot: CLINK, CLUNK, CLANK.


It was seven o’clock in the morning; I was astounded. I watched, transfixed, as he ambled towards the fridge, found the milk jug, and poured himself a tall glass. He gulped it down, then sat awkwardly at the table.  

 

“Breakfast!” he demanded, sounding more machine than human.  

  

I spit out my coffee, soaking my crotch; the coffee was scorching, so I charged into the washroom and cleaned up. I didn’t trust the sound of the boy’s voice. It sounded cruel and inhumane. And it was two octaves lower. 


Just my imagination, I told myself. 

  

I gathered my nerves and returned to the kitchen. To my surprise, the boy fixed himself some cereal and toast. Not a big feat, of course, except he never does that. Ever. Despite my constant nagging. Maybe he’s learning, I reminded myself. I was the same way at his age.  

  

He devoured his breakfast, and belched. It stank like a rusted old train. He released a laugh so diabolical, it made my skin crawl. He belched again, then marched towards the fridge and came out with a full bottle of Coke. He emptied the entire bottle of pop down his throat. The belch that followed could be heard by the neighbors.   

  

I was gobsmacked. Why was he acting this way? Many thoughts crashed through my mind:   

  

Maybe the costume was giving him confidence?   

  

Maybe something happened at school – something I don’t know about – and he’s deflecting?  


Maybe the costume was cursed.


I was overreacting. He’s still a kid, and he’s acting strangely. No biggie. Heck, he’s still reeling from the loss of his mother. It would be weird for him not to be acting out. I told myself this, but I didn’t believe it.  

  

Edith came moping into the kitchen.   

  

“What’s up, sweetie?” I asked, trying to sound cheerful.   

  

She shrugged.   

  

“Hungry?” I asked.  

  

She plopped onto the kitchen chair, her red hair spilling across her freckled face. She looked at me and sniffled.  Meanwhile, the rickety robot was ravaging everything in the refrigerator. Nick started teasing her, and calling her names.  

  

“Nick!” I snapped. “Watch your mouth!”

  

The robot stood upright, “Or what?”  

  

He was so tall, it was shocking. The boy was due for a growth spurt, but this was ridiculous. I bit my tongue. 


Edith looked terrified. “Daddy,” she sobbed, “make him stop.”  

  

Despite my trepidation, I fake-laughed, hoping to lighten the mood, then I gathered their belongings and shooed them off to school. 

  

Work was hectic. I spent all day doing maintenance – which in itself is a nightmare – so I was busy, busy, busy. That afternoon, I received a platoon of texts from Amy, who runs their daycare. Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it), I was too busy to check my phone, so I didn’t read them until I was parked in her driveway. And by then, it was too late.

 

When I entered the daycare, I smelled feces. No wonder. It was spread across the living room walls, like chunky brown paint. I  gagged.

 

Amy was red-faced and furious. “DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT BOY!”


The boy was chasing kids around the house, throwing poop at them. The kids seemed terrified. 

 

Edith rushed over and hugged me; her face was withered from bawling.   

  

“Daddy,” she sniffled, “Nick is being bad.”   


Nick – still in his robot costume – had some poor kid in a full-nelson (a wrestling move he’d recently learned). He picked the kid up over his head and started spinning him. The poor kid was wailing. 


“Nick!” I shouted. “Knock it off!”  


I couldn’t believe my eyes. Normally, Nick’s a nice kid. He’s never acted like this before. I rushed over, yanked his arm, and yelped. The robot zapped me. The pain was incredible. Every hair on my body stood on end.  


The robot-boy growled, “Do NOT touch me again.” His eyes were blinking non-stop.

  

“Pardon me?” I was furious. Before he could reply, I picked him up over my shoulder and carried him to the door, despite the dripping kid-crap. Everyone applauded, especially Amy, who was completely disheveled.   

  

“PUT ME DOWN!” The robot-boy hollered. “STUPID HUMAN!”  

  

The shocks came like rapid fire – ZAP, ZING, ZOING. Every nerve in my body was exploding, and I stank like raw sewage. My ego burst like a balloon. I was the Worst Father Ever, and everyone knew it. I couldn’t leave soon enough.  

  

The drive home felt like forever. Nick wouldn’t let up: he insulted me, his sister, the kids at school, the kids at daycare, and especially Amy, who had the audacity to scold him. 


I sent him to his room.   

  

BIG mistake.  

  

The robot costume short-circuited; its gizmos were going haywire. Steam was sifting through its silver-tinged helmet. It grunted. Then the power went out. Not just for our house, but the entire block.  

  

A coincidence, I told myself. A bone-chilling coincidence. I ignored the unruly robot-boy, and ordered pizza for dinner, which pleased Edith. I was worried about her. The last thing she needed was more stress in her life. 


The robot-boy kept mucking around, and complaining about everything. I was at my wit’s end. If only Abby were here, she’d know what to do. Memories of my wife flooded into my mind. I missed her dearly. We all did.   

  

I found our wedding pictures, and sat with Edith on the couch. We went through the entire photo album. “Mommy’s so beautiful,” she said in a wistful voice. I agreed.   

  

The robot-boy seemed to have calmed down. He still hadn’t gone to his bedroom, but I wasn’t going to push the issue. I’m a big fella. I don’t scare easily. But I was on edge. This was my boy. Except, it wasn’t.    

  

The costume.   

  

I had to dispose of it.  

 

But how?  

 

I’d wait until he was asleep, steal it from his closet, take it to the dumpster and burn the damned thing. That was my plan. I’d deal with the consequences when they came.   

  

It took over an hour (and several slices of pizza) to coax the kid out of the costume. When he changed into his PJs, he returned to normal. I sighed. Everything was good again. Seeing as though the power was still off, we played boardgames. Perhaps ‘Robots’ wasn’t a good choice, but the boy seemed satisfied.  

  

In the wee hours of the morning, I snuck into his bedroom; he’s a light sleeper, so I had to be super-quiet. Holding my breath, I crept carefully towards the closet. The closet creaked open. I groaned. The costume wasn’t in there. Where the heck was it? I spied the entire bedroom. 

  

I saw the robot, and nearly screamed.   

  

There it was, wrapped in warm blankets, tucked neatly beside the boy. 


I stood there, angered and frustrated, unsure of what to do.  

 

The boy opened his eyes; he shot me a nasty look.  

 

“Hey champ,” I said, lacklusterly. “Just checking in on ya.” I tussled his hair, then scampered out of the room before anything else could go wrong.

  

Later that night, I dreamed the robot-boy murdered the entire neighborhood. The nightmare repeated all night long, and I awoke covered in sweat-soaked bedsheets.  

  

I was up at the crack of dawn, preparing a special Halloween breakfast for the kids. (Thankfully, the power was back on.) Their school was closed for the day, and I didn’t dare bring them back to Amy’s, so I took the day off work. I had them all to myself.   

  

Edith was quiet all morning; she picked away at her ghoulish pancakes (normally her favorite), then asked to be excused. Nick was late getting up. At first, I was fine with this. Grateful, if I’m being honest. But by ten o’clock, I started to worry.


What if he sneaked out the window and started causing havoc? 


What if he’s in danger? 


I reminded myself that he’s nearly thirteen-years-old, and that growing boys need sleep. If he’s not up by noon, I’ll wake him.

  

By noon the house was graveyard-quiet, and the boy still hadn’t come down yet. Not a good sign. Tepidly, I tip-toed upstairs to check on him. The old oak floors moaned as I moved. I stood at his door for what felt like hours. Why was I so skittish? I must be losing it. 


I put my ear against his door, and listened.  

 

He was awake alright. 

  

I knocked.   

  

No answer.  

  

“Nick? You hungry?” I waited.  

  

My veins were ice cubes. Something must be wrong. The boy was always hungry. I opened the door and gasped. I couldn’t believe my eyes. Was I hallucinating? Sure seemed like it. 


I charged inside, fists clenched, ready to rumble.  

 

The robot was strangling Nick. The boy’s face was blue and puffy, his eyes as big as saucers. I needed to act quickly, so I grabbed the robot and threw him off the boy.  

  

The robot stood up on its own and snarled. It leapt onto my shoulders and started thrashing me. The thing was strong, I’ll give it that. And quick. I tripped over a discarded transformer and fell, smashing my head onto the dresser. I saw stars. Then, darkness.  

  

Pain.  

 

At some point, my eyes popped open. My head hurt like hell. I was disoriented. I must be dreaming. In the real world, robot costumes don’t come alive and take a family hostage. That’s something you read about in sci-fi fiction.   

  

WHACK.  

  

The monster smacked my face. It was standing over me; its soulless were eyes blinking non-stop.  

 

I assessed the situation: I was on the floor, bound to the bed with rope; beside me was the boy. He wasn’t moving.  I feared he was dead, but his steady snoring reassured me. My mouth was taped shut. I started kicking and thrashing, and soon grew tired. I was a captive of my own creation. A prisoner.


What I needed was a plan.   

  

Edith! She was our only hope. Where was she? In her room with earbuds jammed inside her head, that’s where.


The robot was making weird noises, and flapping its arms. It wanted something from me. I tried talking through the tape. It ripped the tape off my mouth. WOOSH. The pain was instantaneous.  


The robot got right in my face; it stank like grease. Inside its helmet, looking back at me, was the life-sized alien head my wife bought Nick last Christmas. The thing cost a fortune. The rest of the alien was stuffed inside the box. Its legs were short and stout and painted silver.


I shivered. Somehow, the alien and the robot merged. Great. Just what I needed: an alien-bot.

 

“Wor-wor-wor,” the alien-bot barked.   

  

“Let me go!” I shouted. I wanted to it to bits. I was livid. Furious.   


It blinked non-stop, and tapped its chest. It was trying to tell me something. 


“I don’t understand,” I said.


The alien-bot disappeared under the bed, and came out with an empty can of WD40. 

  

Aha! It needs a lube. Well, it ain’t getting any. 


It crushed the can, then chucked it at the boy, who was still unconscious on the bed.   


“If you hurt him,” I said, “I’ll kill you.” A ridiculous thing to say to a robot costume, but I meant it.   

  

“Wor-wor-wor,” it replied. Then it zoomed across the bedroom and scooted downstairs.    

  

Now’s my chance! I tried freeing myself, and failed. I wanted to sit upright, but couldn’t. I was seriously pissed off. And worried. What if the alien-bot harms my daughter?  

  

“Edith!” I shouted, hating the sound of my shaky voice. “Edith, come quick!”  

  

Nothing. How many times did my wife tell her not to use the earbuds full volume?   

  

“Edith! Help!”  

  

The bedroom door creaked open. I tried craning my neck around to look, but I was stuck facing the wrong direction. All I could see was a dresser and a window overlooking a birch tree.   

  

“Wor-wor-wor.”  

  

Stupid robot. If I’d known any of this would happen, I never would’ve constructed the damned thing. It jumped onto the bed and started nudging Nick. The boy mumbled under his breath.   

  

“Nick! You okay?” I asked.

  

“Daddy?”  

  

Phew. He’s okay.   

  

“Don’t do ANYTHING,” I said carefully. “Not yet.”  

  

“Wor-wor-wor,” went the alien-bot.  

  

Ugh. I hated that thing.  

  

It stood in front of me, and produced a pack of matches. In its other hand was an aerosol can of WD-40, which was extremely flammable. It shook the can, then pressed the nozzle: ZZZZRRRRRRR.   

  

It wants to set the house on fire.  

  

‘Daddy!” Nick cried. “Stop him!”  

  

“I can’t!” I bellowed. “I’m stuck!”   

  

WOOSH.   

  

The bed caught fire.


“Wor-wor-wor.” The robot raced to the door. 


There was a commotion. If only I could turn around and see what was happening.    

  

Someone spoke. “Hey! What’s going on in there?”  

  

“Edith!”   

  

More commotion.


“Hey! Stop that!” she complained. 

  

There was a skirmish, followed by a dreadful silence. I wanted to shout, but I was busy flopping like a fish, trying desperately to put out the fire.   

  

“Hey robot!” Edith shouted. “Chase this!”  

  

I stopped floundering and looked up. Flickered through the window was a tiny red dot. 


The laser pointer! 


Our black cat Shadow, who disappeared last summer, loved the thing. Edith must have grabbed it from the junk drawer.   

  

The robot raced across the bedroom and stopped in front of the window. It pawed the glowing red dot.


“Wor-wor-wor.” 


The red dot dashed across the window.


It scooped and swiped, but the dot kept moving. The alien-bot started shaking; smoke was billowing from its ears.  The alien-bot backed up, and with remarkable speed, it attacked the red dot and crashed through the window.  

  

“Holy hell!” I shouted.   

  

“Daddy!” Edith grabbed me. “What do I do?”  

  

“Get a bucket of water!” I replied. “Hurry!” 

  

She returned moments later, and put out the fire. I told her where the knives were. With much effort, she freed me. I swiped the X-Acto knife from her tiny hand and rescued the boy. We hugged for an eternity.  

 

I rushed outside.   

  

The robot was stuck in a tree, flailing.  

 

“Payback’s a bitch,” I said, fetching a shovel. I told the kids to keep a close eye on the robot while I dug a hole in the yard. “If anything happens, call me.” In the heat of the moment, I didn’t know what else to do. It took ten minutes or so to dig the hole. Afterwards, I found a pair of work gloves; then, using a ladder, I grabbed the cursed creature from the tree and stuffed it into a garbage bag.  


We all took turns jumping on top of it, but the damned thing wouldn’t die. It kept making those whirling sounds.  

  

“Get the axe!” I ordered Nick.  

 

He did. I let him take the first few swings, smashing the stupid robot to bits, while Edith cheered him on. I finished the job, and chopped it into a million pieces. Then I buried the mechanical monster in the yard.   

 

Flustered, I took the kids out for lunch. They were uncharacteristically quiet. It’s not every day a Halloween costume comes to life and tries to kill you. I spent the rest of the day trying my darndest to cheer them up. It’s their first Halloween without their dear mother, after all.  

  

We stopped at a local costume shop on the way home, and Nick picked out a Spiderman costume. Nice and safe. They had a blast trick-or-treating. I wished my wife was with us. Maybe she was. Perhaps she was looking down from Heaven. If so, she’s probably laughing at us. Humor was her greatest strength, after all.    

  

Sleep didn’t come that night. How could it? I kept expecting an alien-bot to kill my kids. Ridiculous, I know. But every hour, I checked up on them. Then I searched around the house. Just in case.  The following morning, I was dead tired. But at least the kids seemed okay. Children have a wonderful way of coping, don’t they?


Later that day, just before dinner, something caught my attention in the yard: a gathering of animals.   

  

“What the?”  

  

I looked out the window, and frowned. 


My heart halted. 


Oh good God. This can’t be happening. Not now.  

 

But it was.  

 

I ran into the yard, wielding my Glock 19. Blood was on my mind. The squirrels and buzzards scrammed. Somewhere, a dog barked. I marched to the edge of the yard. The hole was dug up. I peaked inside and groaned. It was empty. Like a man possessed, I scavenged the perimeters of the house, gun cocked and loaded.


"Where’s that carking collection of spare parts?"  

 

After several trips around the house, I stopped to wipe the sweat from my brow. My hands were trembling. I really was losing my mind. Robots don’t come to life. Nor do they return from the dead. The sun was sinking. A cool breeze swept across the yard. The feeling of being watched was impossible to ignore. It was out there somewhere, taunting me.


 “Wor-wor-wor.”
