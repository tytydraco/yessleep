 

It was a typical Tuesday night, and Alex was settling in for a relaxing evening at home. He had just put on his favorite horror movie when he heard a faint noise from upstairs. It sounded like footsteps, but he brushed it off as the creaking of an old building.

As the night wore on, the noise continued, growing louder and more persistent. It sounded like someone was pacing back and forth, but there was no one living in the apartment above him. Alex started to feel uneasy, but he tried to convince himself that it was just his imagination.

But then he heard something else: the sound of muffled voices. It was hard to make out what they were saying, but Alex knew it was coming from the apartment above him. He tried to ignore it and focus on the movie, but his mind kept drifting back to the noise upstairs.

As the night grew darker, the sounds grew louder. Alex could hear footsteps and furniture being moved around. He started to feel scared, but he didn't want to be the kind of person who called the police over a noise complaint.

But then something happened that made his blood run cold: he heard a scream. It was a high-pitched, piercing scream that seemed to go on forever. Alex knew he couldn't ignore it any longer. He picked up his phone and dialed 911.

The police arrived within minutes, and they quickly made their way up to the apartment above Alex's. He waited nervously as they knocked on the door, but there was no answer. They tried the handle, but it was locked.

They called out, but there was no response. It was as if the apartment was empty. But Alex knew better. He had heard the noises, the voices, and the scream. He knew someone was up there.

The police decided to break down the door, and what they found inside made Alex's heart race with fear. The apartment was empty, but there were signs that someone had been living there. There were clothes in the closet, dishes in the sink, and a bed that looked like it had been slept in.

But there was no sign of the family who was supposed to be living there. The police searched the entire apartment, but they found nothing. It was as if the family had vanished into thin air.

Alex was left with a feeling of dread that he couldn't shake. He knew something was wrong, but he didn't know what to do. He tried to put it out of his mind, but the memory of the scream kept echoing in his head.

Days turned into weeks, and Alex tried to forget about the family upstairs. But he couldn't. He started to hear the noises again, the footsteps and the voices. He knew he wasn't imagining it.

One night, as he was lying in bed, he heard the scream again. It was louder this time, more desperate. Alex knew he had to do something. He got out of bed and made his way upstairs, determined to find out what was going on.

He knocked on the door, but there was no answer. He tried the handle, and to his surprise, it opened. He stepped inside, and what he saw made him wish he had never come.

There, in the middle of the room, was a woman, bound and gagged. She was covered in bruises, and her eyes were wide with fear. Alex knew he had to help her, but as he reached out to untie her, he heard a noise behind him.

He turned around and saw a man standing there, his face twisted with rage. Alex knew he was in danger, but he couldn't move. He was frozen with fear, trapped in the apartment with the family upstairs.
