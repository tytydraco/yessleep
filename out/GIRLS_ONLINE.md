Years ago, when I was a teenager, I had a lot of online relationships. This was back when social media was still new, and everyone was figuring out how to navigate it. I wasn’t different. I liked talking to people—girls, mostly. It made me feel popular, like I mattered. I liked knowing that somewhere out there, someone was thinking about me. It was a game, really. A flirty, harmless fantasy. I never thought it would turn into anything else. 

I was vain, I’ll admit it. I thought I was attractive, and I liked getting compliments. Especially from girls who were attractive themselves. It always started innocently enough—just chatting, exchanging a few pictures here and there. But it never stayed innocent for long. Soon, the pictures became more frequent, more intimate. I had a whole collection of them on my phone: Ashley, Lauren, Taylor, Jessica, Abbie... and Cass. Cassandra Bybee was her full name. She was different.

Cass came on strong from the start. She was always the first to say good morning, always the last to say goodnight. She sent me more pictures than anyone else—candid shots of her at the beach, eating ice cream, lying in bed with her hair fanned out on the pillow. She said she lived close by, that she wanted to meet me, that she *needed* to meet me. I was a shy kid, so I always made excuses when she asked to FaceTime. But I liked her. More than the others. She made me feel special in a way no one else did. She was also gorgeous. 

Looking back, there were red flags. Little things that didn’t add up. Her pictures sometimes felt... off. Like the backgrounds were too blurry, or the lighting was strange. Once, I noticed she was wearing a jacket that looked like it was from the early 2000s, even though she claimed the photo was taken that same week. And her messages—sometimes they had an eerie timing, as if she knew exactly when I was alone or feeling vulnerable. But I ignored it. I was a teenager. I didn’t want to think too hard about it. Back then, I believed in God, and she was like my angel.

Things with Cass got more intense. She started saying she loved me, that she couldn’t stop thinking about me. I didn’t say it back, but I didn’t stop her either. I liked the attention. I liked the fantasy. And for the first time, I started to think about making it real. I even planned out a date in my head—where I’d take her, what I’d say. I told my friends about her, showed them her pictures. They were impressed. I felt like I was on top of the world.

Things shifted. It happened one night when I was hanging out with my friends in my buddy Andy’s basement. We were being stupid, like teenage boys do, watching gore videos online. It was a sick game—seeing who could handle the worst. For instance, one was a man’s head being caved-in with a bat. Another was of arms and legs snapping the wrong direction. Some of it was really bloody gun stuff. I thought I was tough, so I sat and watched as my friends gagged or left the room. Then, there was a video of a car crash, one of the worst I’d ever seen. The camera panned over the wreckage, lingering on the bodies. And then I saw her.

Cass.

Her head was... gone. But the camera zoomed in on what was left of her face, and there was no mistaking it. It was her. The same eyes, the same lips, the same hair. I felt like the air had been sucked out of the room. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t speak. My friends noticed something was wrong, but I just sat there, staring at the screen, until Andy finally paused the video. I’ll never forget that feeling. 

“Dude, what’s wrong?” he asked.

I couldn’t answer. I just pulled him aside and showed him the pictures of Cass on my phone. He didn’t say much, but he could tell I was freaking out. He didn’t fully understand yet. Andy was the tech-savvy one in our group, so he ran a reverse image search on her photos for me that night. What he found made me nearly die.

The pictures weren’t of a girl named Cassandra. They were of a girl named Emma Leighman. She had died in a car crash three years earlier.

I felt like I was going to throw up, and never felt so oddly sick in my whole life. I blocked Cass’s number, deleted her photos, reported her accounts. But it didn’t end there. Andy helped me run reverse image searches on all the other girls I’d been talking to. Ashley, Lauren, Taylor, Jessica, Abbie... every single one of them. They were all dead. Their pictures had been taken from gore sites, obituaries, old social media profiles. Someone had been catfishing me with the faces of dead girls.

I deleted all my social media that night. I couldn’t sleep for weeks. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw Cass’s face—or Emma’s face—staring back at me. I kept wondering who had done this. Was it someone I knew? A stranger? Someone who had been watching me this whole time? I never gave them my address or anything too personal, but I’d sent plenty of pictures. What if they knew where I lived? What if they were still out there?

It’s been eight years now, and nothing else has happened. I’ve tried to move on, but I can’t shake the feeling that I’m still being watched. Sometimes, when I’m alone at night, I’ll catch myself staring at my phone, half-expecting a message to pop-up. And every time I hear about a car crash or a girl who went missing, I think of Cass. I think of Emma. I think of all the others.

I’ll never know who was behind it. But I do know they’re still out there, and I know that those kinds of people don’t stop just because you block them.
