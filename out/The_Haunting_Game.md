The first night wasn’t so bad. It felt like a normal hotel stay—strange, maybe, but nothing too out of the ordinary. But then the knock came. It wasn’t a knock I was used to. It wasn’t the kind of knock you’d expect from room service or housekeeping. It was… *deeper*. *Slower*. *Hollow.* The kind that made your skin crawl before you even opened the door.

I didn’t open it right away. I stood still, listening to the silence that followed. My heart raced in my chest as I felt the air around me grow heavier, thicker—like something had just entered the room with me. I knew I should’ve ignored it, should’ve just gone to bed and pretended everything was fine.

But I couldn’t. I opened the door.

There was nothing there.

Except for a single playing card on the floor.

*The Ace of Spades.*

I remember picking it up. I remember how cold it felt in my hand, how the edges dug into my skin like it wasn’t supposed to be touched. But before I could even think about it, the hallway lights flickered and I saw it—just for a split second. A shadow, tall and twisting, hovering just beyond the doorway. It wasn’t a person. Not a thing of flesh and bone. It was something else. Something… wrong.

I slammed the door shut.

That’s when the madness started.


The next night, the knock came again. I tried to ignore it. I tried to pretend I wasn’t hearing things, that the shadows outside my door weren’t moving of their own accord. But when I opened the door, the Ace of Spades was there again. And the laughter.

At first, I thought it was my mind playing tricks. But then I heard it clearly. Low, sick laughter that seemed to come from every direction. And then the whispers. “Play the game. Play the game.”

That’s when I realized. This wasn’t just a stupid hotel gimmick. We were being forced to play. And someone was going to die tonight.



The others—the ones who had been in the hotel longer than I had—didn’t seem to care. They were calm, almost too calm. They knew the game. They knew how this worked. I could see it in their eyes. *Their pupils were dilated, their faces pale like they hadn’t seen daylight in years.* They weren’t afraid anymore. **They’d accepted it.** The game was their reality.

They didn’t even try to escape.

I couldn’t stop myself from shaking, from feeling like the walls were closing in. I could hear the game start—one by one, we had to choose. Who would die? Who would get to leave? But the twist? We didn’t know the rules. All we knew was that if we didn’t make the right choice, we would all die. And the price of survival was always someone else’s life.

I glanced around, but no one was moving. The others were staring straight ahead, their faces blank. They were already in it, deep in the game, waiting for the clock to tick down.

I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t know who to pick. And then, the air changed. The temperature dropped. The lights flickered once again, but this time, they didn’t come back on. The room was plunged into darkness. But I could hear it—*shuffling, breathing,* like something was crawling across the floor, dragging its body toward me.

The growl came next, low and guttural, like an animal was pacing behind me. But when I turned, nothing was there. I ran to the door, yanking it open, but the hallway was different. It was longer than before. The carpet was wet, soaking through my shoes. I felt the walls pulse. I could hear my heartbeat in my ears, thudding louder with every second that passed.

I tried to run, but something held me back. Something was pulling at me, yanking me toward the darkness. I saw the shadow again—tall, impossibly tall. It stood at the end of the hallway, just watching. Its face was gone. There was nothing. Just emptiness.

I tried to scream, but no sound came out. My mouth was *frozen open*, like I was trapped in some silent nightmare.

And then, the laughter again. It echoed from the walls, from the floor, from everywhere. It wasn’t human. It wasn’t even close.

The game was real. And it was coming for us.


By the fourth night, I could feel the insanity taking root. The hotel wasn’t just a building anymore. It was alive. It was feeding on us, manipulating our every thought. The doors no longer led to the same places. The rooms shifted. The layout of the hotel twisted like some sort of maze, a labyrinth designed to break us. And every night, the game got worse. The cards came quicker. The choices got harder. Every time we thought we might survive, the rules changed.

**I wasn’t sure who I was anymore. Was I still me? Or had the hotel already taken me?**

The knocking started again. But this time, it wasn’t the usual tap. It was a banging, loud and insistent. I opened the door and saw a hand reaching out from the darkness, long fingers with nails blackened and broken, gripping the doorframe like it was trying to pull itself into the room.

I slammed the door shut and backed away, my heart pounding in my chest. The air was so thick now, I could barely breathe.

The others? They were gone. They weren’t real anymore. I could see them, but they weren’t there. Their faces were twisted, like puppets with strings pulled too tight. Their eyes were black, voids that sucked the light from the room.

And then, from behind me, I heard it.

*“Your time is up.”*

I turned around, but there was nothing. Just the sound of the air growing heavier. I tried to move, but the floor was sticky, like something was pulling me down, trapping me in place.

I tried to scream again, **but no sound came out.**



The knocking came again.

But this time, it wasn’t at the door.

**It was in my mind.**
