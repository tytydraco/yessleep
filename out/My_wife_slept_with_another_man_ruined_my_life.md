I remember the day I met my wife like it was yesterday. We were both 16 and in high school. She was new to the school and I couldn't help but notice her. I was immediately drawn to her, and I knew I had to talk to her. We started dating and it was like we were meant to be together. We knew that we were going to spend the rest of our lives together.
We were high school sweethearts and our love only grew stronger as we got older. We went to college together and then got married when we were 22. We were happy, young and in love.

One day, I came home early from work and found her in bed with another man. I was devastated and couldn't believe what I was seeing. She tried to explain that she had been feeling suffocated and needed to experience life outside of our relationship. But I couldn't understand how she could cheat on me, the person she had promised to spend her life with.

We separated and she begged for me to take her back, but I couldn't do it. I couldn't trust her again and I couldn't forget what she had done.

That's when things started to get crazy. She started to spread rumors about me, saying that I had forced her into the relationship since we were 16 and that I would hit her if she asked to leave. She even went as far as to file a restraining order against me.

I knew that none of it was true and I couldn't understand why she would say such terrible things about me. I was determined to clear my name and prove her accusations as false.
As the truth came out, it was revealed that she had been lying about everything. She had made it all up to try and hurt me and make me look bad.

In the end, it all became too much for her and she committed suicide & wrote the note in her last efforts to strike me, in the note she had said that none of what she said was a lie and I had fooled eveyone. I was left feeling guilty and responsible for her death, even though I knew it was not my fault. I couldn't help but feel that I should have been able to save her, to help her through her troubles.

In the end, I was left with a broken heart and a shattered life. I had lost the woman I had loved since I was 16, my life is ruined from the publicity and people stalking my home throwing bricks through my window late at night saying Iâ€™m a murderer. I couldn't shake the feeling that there was always something off about her, and I couldn't believe that the girl I had grown up with could have turned into such a monster. I learned that love can turn into the most dangerous thing, and the person you thought you knew can become a stranger.
