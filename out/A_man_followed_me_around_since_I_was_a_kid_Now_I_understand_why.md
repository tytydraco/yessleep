A possibility exists that there are people who had similar experiences to mine as to where they don’t know what is wrong with them. No matter how hard they try, they can’t quite put their finger on the missing piece. Cannot find the antidote. The gears that make us human are broken for the most part. They don’t move in the right direction, or some are missing, thus rendering the whole mechanism faulty.  
  
I sometimes find a safe haven in my loneliness, but other times this room I live in feels like hell. I think hell is two places: the first is what you feel deep inside, and the other is a physical place. The sadness comes in waves and crashes against the shores of my fragile heart, breaking it ever so slowly every day. It’s all a whirlpool of sorrow, sadness and the fear for what horrors tomorrow might bring.  
  
And living like this isn't easy, but I somehow manage to push through. The physical pain is excruciating, and the darkness in my mind is like a demon always trying to take control. It claws at the most sensitive areas of the mind, trying to rip out and kill whatever it can.   
  
It all started when I was just a child. With that man. That man and his awful grin.  
  
At first, I thought he was just a recurring nightmare. Then he manifested himself through sounds in the middle of the night. Sometimes a glass would shatter in the kitchen, or the door to my room would slowly creak open only to reveal nothing in the darkness. Other times, the room temperature would suddenly drop, making me shiver even on hot summer nights.  
  
He changed how he wanted to be heard or seen as time passed. When I was a kid, I think I was maybe seven or eight years old, the man would make me wake up in the middle of the night to the sound of children giggling and whispering. He made me think rats scurried inside the walls. One time, the light in the room turned on by itself, and the lightbulb suddenly overheated and exploded in a matter of seconds.   
  
The manifestation of the man had always been there with me through various stages of my life and in different forms. He would come unannounced, as he did when my grandfather died at 88 years of age. That day, the overcast sky complemented the sorrow we breathed in the air. The sadness embraced us all with its bitter and cold arms and sank its teeth into our tired flesh, delivering us into nothingness. Everyone who attended had their heads hung low. Some cried, and some stood there watching the coffin or the ground witness the end of life. The end of a cycle.  
  
Except for one man. He was fleeting, like a speck of dust in the wind. He was there for just one moment. A wrinkle in time. I saw his wide grin from the corner of my eye. He watched from behind a tree but not hiding. He made sure everyone knew he was there. I think I was the only one who saw him. Fully dressed in black, a shadow, a ghost made of smoke. And as he stood there rubbing his hands with satisfaction, almost as if he was the only happy one at the funeral, I saw his grin and shiny chromium teeth. He glanced at me for a mere second and then disappeared, leaving me unable to move. He had planted the seed of terror in my mind, let it grow, and vanished into the unknown.  
  
And after that, I hadn’t seen him for years.  I forgot about him. I would remember, of course, the things that happened in my childhood, the unexplained phenomena, the trauma and him standing behind that tree at my grandpa’s funeral. But, I didn’t know if these happenings were real anymore, nightmares or just a figment of my imagination.  
  
Occasionally, I would still jolt awake in the middle of the night. Muscles jerking and gasping for air. Sweat beads rolled down my temples, and for a few seconds, I would lay in bed scared and lost. It would end fast, and then I’d go to sleep again and forget about it the next day.  
  
One by one, I finished college and got a job at a bank in this little town I’ve lived my entire life. Then, out of nowhere, I met her. Sarah. The most beautiful woman in the universe. Our paths intersected as if an unknown god would have wanted us to be happy forever. We stopped in our tracks as if starstruck, glanced at each other, and smiled.   
  
The rest is history, as they say. But…  
  
She moved in with me two months later. Everything seemed to be on track for us. A regular life with regular jobs and maybe some kids down the line. Even though I had forgotten most of those traumatic childhood experiences, there was something in the back of my head that didn’t leave me to enjoy life as I should have. And then fate proved to me that I was right. That little nagging feeling would soon grow stronger and destroy everything I held sacred.  
  
It began again, but now with me. With Sarah.  
  
One night, I found her standing in the middle of the kitchen. I had woken up to use the toilet, and she wasn’t in bed. The clock read 2:45. The sheets had gotten cold, meaning she had left for quite some time.   
  
“Honey, what are you doing here? Are you ok?” I asked.   
  
She looked at me but through me. Her face was all white; she was scared out of her wits. Her body began shivering.   
  
“There’s someone in the house. I heard them walking, opening doors and closing them. And scratches on the walls. Like nails against a chalkboard,” she replied.   
  
She couldn’t come out of it.   
  
“Oh, Sarah. I’m sure it was all just a nightmare. The motion sensors didn’t activate, or otherwise, the alarms would have gone off,” I replied with a calm voice.  
  
“I’m telling you, James. Something or someone is in the house,” she whispered. Her eyes welled, and tears rolled down her cheeks. “Please, go look.”  
  
“Alright, love. Sure,” I said. I went over to her and hugged her. “You stay behind me, ok?”  
  
She nodded.  
  
I grabbed a large knife and checked all the rooms, bathrooms, wardrobes, and attic. I found no signs of anyone being in the house. We then went back to the kitchen. I made some chamomile tea and tried to calm her down so we could get back to sleep.   
  
“I’m not crazy, James. I feel like something’s off tonight,” she said. Her lips trembled as if something evil had taken hold of her, and would never let it go.  
  
“I know, Sarah. I’ll talk to a locksmith tomorrow so we can change the locks and reinforce them too, ok? Right now, we should go back to sleep. I’ll take the knife upstairs. I’ll lock the bedroom door if that makes you more comfortable and safer?” I said and kissed her forehead.  
  
“Mhm, sounds good,” she replied.   
  
We went to bed, but I needed to know.  
  
“How long were you in the kitchen, Sarah?” I asked.  
  
“Honestly, I have no idea how I got there… It just feels like I woke up there. Maybe I sleepwalked. I have no idea,” she said. “Let’s sleep for a couple more hours. I feel like I haven’t slept in a few weeks.”  
  
“Good night, love,” I said and kissed her on the lips. “You’ll feel better in the morning.”  
  
I closed my eyes and fell asleep on the spot.  
  
And instantly, I jumped out of bed when I heard Sarah screaming.  
  
*Why would she risk going out by herself instead of waking me up?*  
  
“James, help! Someone is in the house!”  
  
More screams.  
  
I grabbed the knife and ran as fast as I could.  
  
“Where are you, Sarah??? Talk to me!”   
  
Silence. Not a sound to be heard in the dead of night.  
  
Footsteps running. Scratches in the walls, as if someone had lived inside and found it fit to get out at that moment. Telephone ringing. Glasses shattering in the kitchen.  
  
It all came to me. He was here again. The Awful Man. The Destroyer.   
  
But why now?   
  
My heart drummed in my chest, and fear crippled my soul.  I called for Sarah again. Nothing.  
  
Down in the kitchen, all the cutlery levitated in the air just above the table. They smashed right down and created a high-pitched clinking sound that almost made me go deaf.   
  
And then I felt it. The voice breathing in the back of my neck. I could feel its grin too. Long hands grabbed me, the black pointy fingers getting longer and squeezing me where my lungs were. I slowly suffocated. I wanted to turn around, but I was too afraid.   
  
“Hello, James. Missed me?” the man’s voice said. “It’s okay now. I’m back.”  
  
The whole world disintegrated around me. Everything I knew crumbled to pieces. This apparition set my mind ablaze once more with the fires of sadness, hate, and self-loathing. A new king in my mind. King Fear.  
  
“What do you want from me? What did you do to Sarah? Please, take what you want from me, take my mind, soul, and sanity, but leave her alone, please!” I whispered, barely managing to get the words out.   
  
“Oh, don’t worry, we’re just getting started,” he said, laughing like a maniac. “She’s down in the basement, safe and sound. The clock’s ticking. Tick-tock. Go get her. Go and save her, James!  
  
He released his inhuman grip and I could breathe again. I fell to my knees and coughed blood, but I couldn’t rest. I had to save the love of my life. As I passed the basement door, I heard a soft whimper.   
  
“Sarah! I’m coming!” I screamed.  
  
Down there, the light flickered. Sarah stood facing the wall, mumbling words I couldn’t understand. I walked a few steps but couldn’t get closer to her. It felt like walking a longer distance than that of the basement.   
  
“James, please!” she cried. “I can’t move!”  
  
At last, she seemed to get closer to me. “Hold on! I’m almost there!”   
  
The light turned off. “Jame-!” Sarah’s voice died with the light. Darkness swallowed her. I fell to my knees, defeated. The Awful Man had taken my only joy in life away from me. Now I was only a shell, a carcass of my former self.   
  
But the light turned on again, and Sarah was still there.  
  
“Oh my God, I thought I lost you! I thought he took you away from me!” I said. I lunged towards her, and when I was only a few steps away, she started to turn her head slowly.  
  
A cloud of thick smoke engulfed her from the feet up, and her face started to change. Her mouth widened, and her eyes turned red. A dark wrinkly old skin now replaced whatever angelic features she had had.   
  
Her face slowly changed into that of… the Awful Man.  
  
No. This couldn’t be possible.   
  
His wide mouth opened only to reveal a set of long sharp teeth.   
  
“She was never here, James. It was me all along. I played with your mind and made you think your were happy, but constantly sending you signals that you never were. What a fabulous experience this was for me,” the Awful Man said.  “I’m back, and I’ll never leave you again! It will be just the two of us. Best friends forever!”   
  
“No… Please…” I whimpered. “Leave me alone…”  
  
“Never! Now let me in!” he screamed. “It’s time for me to come back home.”  
  
He grabbed my hand and bit my arm. I could feel him getting inside my blood and into my brain. He infected me with his misery like a virus in a mere moment.  
  
My arm bled in the form of his demented grin.   
  
I managed to get upstairs, clean, and band-aid the wound. Then I don’t know what happened. I guess I just faded away in the blackness.  
  
The arm hurt like hell when I woke up. A wound like a smile. I didn’t find any proof of Sarah ever living here. No pictures, clothes, phone, make-up, or car. It was just as the Awful Man said.
