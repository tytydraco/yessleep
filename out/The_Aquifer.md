Home.

I cannot say what this means. The healer in me claims I am home where I belong. I belong here, in Valle del Río de la Esperanza.

This, while the institutions of the bustling world would accept me if I accepted them first, is what I am for. I was drawn here, sent here, summoned here. All the moments of my life aligned to bring me here, both through fate and my own will.

I will not be leaving Valle del Río de la Esperanza, and I expect this transmission to be my final communication with the ordinary world. Valle del Río de la Esperanza is no longer a part of your century or your troubles. It is truly the most abandoned, forgotten and forsaken place on Earth.

I will never return to Germany. My license remains valid, but I do not. I was asked to suspend practice following a review of my methods. The term used was “unorthodox.” I do not accept it. I followed protocol where protocol was possible. I did not cause harm.

Two weeks ago, I operated on a man in a riverside settlement. He presented with fever, lymphatic swelling, and tissue degradation. I performed debridement and attempted vascular repair. He died on the table. The infection was advanced. The source was not local.

Three days later, Ortega contacted me. He works for the mining company. His role is not medical. He had been assigned to monitor the village and report any signs of outbreak. He requested assistance. I agreed. We traveled together by truck until the road ended. I continued on foot. He remained behind.

Ortega was cooperative. He provided access and information. He did not interfere. At the time, I considered him useful. In retrospect, I recognize the pattern. His presence was not incidental. His urgency was not humanitarian.

The road ended two kilometers before the perimeter. The soil was dense with clay and retained moisture from the previous night's rain. I observed signs of infection immediately. Skin lesions, respiratory distress, and untreated wounds were present in multiple individuals.

I had cleared a space near the communal well and began assembling a provisional surgical station using tarpaulin, salvaged wood, and a set of instruments sterilized with alcohol and flame. There was no refrigeration, no anesthesia, and no reliable power source. I anticipated complications including abscesses, necrosis, and sepsis. I did not expect recovery to be linear. I did not expect gratitude. I expected to operate.

"The village shows early-stage symptoms. The infection pattern is consistent with environmental transmission. I require facilities, supplies, and personnel. They are not available. I am here to operate regardless."

I examined a stool sample from a febrile child. The consistency was abnormal. I noted discoloration and a faint odor of sulfur. Microscopy revealed motile structures consistent with parasitic larvae. Size ranged from 180 to 220 microns. Segmentation was present. Movement was rhythmic.

I requested additional samples. The chief of the village observed the slide. He leaned in, squinted, and said, “Son los gusanitos de la muerte.” I asked him to repeat it. He nodded and said, “Así les decimos. Gusanitos. Los que matan por dentro.”

I recorded the phonetics. I did not correct him. The term was descriptive. I adopted it for internal documentation.

I had confirmed similar structures in three additional patients. All were symptomatic. All had consumed untreated water from the communal well. I began to suspect a gastrointestinal origin. Egg sacs were not visible externally. I noted distension in two cases. Palpation suggested submucosal irregularities.

I did not yet understand the full transmission vector. I documented findings. I prepared for exploratory surgery, beginning with autopsies on those in the six graves outside of Valle del Río de la Esperanza village.

What I found were thriving colonies of the parasites, and I was able to develop a means to test for their presence, with the enzyme that bonds with their organic sulfur excretion. Under direct sunlight, someone's blood plasma who is infected will begin to show crystallization, and the top layer in the test tube will have the separation of the brightly colored byproduct. I proceeded to test it on those I felt certain were in advanced stages of the infection and dying and they all turned out positive.

They begged me to operate, but I had discovered the eggs were all attached to the insides of the stomach lining. Without very invasive surgery, unlikely to detach the parasites, and very likely to cause equally deadly bacterial infections since I had no proper equipment, support or facilities to operate with. Instead, I focused on prevention, insisting that all drinking water be boiled first.

It was too late. My tests concluded that everyone in the village was infected. They had only days to live while the parasites ravaged their bodies, and soon I was spending most of my time burying villagers.

The final week I spent in Valle del Río de la Esperanza was as the last person alive, carrying a little girl to her shallow grave, myself bedraggled and weak from hunger and thirst, as I was avoiding becoming infected for as long as possible. I would like to point out that this child was very kind and brave, and it is an incalculable injustice that the people of Valle del Río de la Esperanza should be erased and forgotten.

When I was alone, I burned the village and sealed the well, placing the skull of a deer upon it, to warn anyone that here was death. I mourned loudly, forgetting I am a scientist, and becoming a very disturbed and broken human being who cried out and wailed at the awfulness of entire families, an entire community, obliterated in one of the worst ways a person can die.

Now I will tell the real horror, which I think anyone who is knowledgeable about the region must already suspect.

I investigated, feverish and growing thin and weak. I caught up to Ortega, and I had a pistol in my hand, with the tip of the barrel inside his left nostril, when I demanded answers. He saw in my eyes that I was not the same person he had sent to Valle del Río de la Esperanza, and that if he refused to tell me the truth, I would have no further use for him, and I only cared about one thing, and it wasn't him.

He was more afraid of me than his corporate masters. Ortega is a company man who works for the world's third-largest international energy company. There is a massive sea of fresh water under Valle del Río de la Esperanza, in the caverns below, and most of it has remained frozen down there since the formation of the continent.

When it was a lake, the world was young, and monsters ruled the Earth. The fracking they used to get to the gases beneath the subterranean glacier had allowed thawed waters from before the dinosaurs to contaminate surface-level groundwaters. The well in Valle del Río de la Esperanza.

The eggs of the parasites had endured an eternal slumber, only to awaken in a world of unsuspecting meat. This I pieced together. I was already infected, boiling the water didn't kill the eggs. I have days left to live, and I am terrified of the process I have seen, as they eat their victim alive from the inside out.

Ortega sat across from me, a glass of water sitting between us. I still had the weapon trained on him. I trembled in fear and pain. The terror I was feeling was absolute, but I hadn't lost my sense of humor, my sense of responsibility or my need for justice.

"You must be thirsty. I've had you with me for twenty-four hours now, helping me solve this Scooby Doo caper. Why don't you have a drink?"

"I'd rather be shot." Ortega said firmly, spreading his hands with sincerity.

"The people of Valle del Río de la Esperanza deserve to have their story told. Don't you agree?" I asked, as though we were talking about leaving a good review for a local chef. My voice sounded strange to me, stressed - crazed.

Ortega nodded, fear in his eyes. "Whatever you need, man. Anything."

"I will tell the story of what happened here." I decided. I accepted his help in drafting what occurred in Valle del Río de la Esperanza. I cannot hold anyone further responsible, but those who did this haven't stopped, and they are still out there. There was no sense in hurting Ortega, and I didn't do anything to him except force him to act on behalf of the people who died in Valle del Río de la Esperanza.

He asked me what was going to happen to him, and I said: "If you can live with yourself, nothing. I'm not a monster; I am a healer. I will cause no harm." and he would leave, before I could change my mind.

I know what is going to happen to me, and I refuse to take the easy way out. When Ortega leaves, I know the gun isn't even loaded. The fisherman I bought it from thought it was strange that I wanted the rusty pistol with no bullets. I only needed it for a man more cowardly than myself.

I'm not a brave person; I am very afraid of what is going to happen to me. I have less than a day before I succumb to it, and from there I will suffer for a weekend in unimaginable agony and then I will die, alone out there, in the jungles.

My death is the least of those who were taken. The true horror is that those who caused this care nothing about the suffering they have caused or the nightmare they have unleashed. The people of Valle del Río de la Esperanza were innocent, and they paid the ultimate price to make the rich even richer, and feed into an insatiable, gnawing, mouth-of-the-maggot greed.
