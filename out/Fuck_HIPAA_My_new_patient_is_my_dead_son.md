In December 2020, a serial killer responsible for fifty-eight murder-mutilations was quietly apprehended in Turlock, California.



The perpetrator claimed that he committed these crimes on behalf of his ten-year-old son, stating that he used parts of his victims — including but not limited to skin, limbs, and eyes — to “patch up” Jackson.



When asked why such “patching up” was necessary, the perpetrator introduced responding personnel to his son, Jackson.



In simplest terms, Jackson — while alive and alert — was visibly rotting. He displayed severe decomposition. Responding personnel noted multiple areas of skin slippage, exposed musculature, and exposed bone.



The child expressed severe distress and pain, and begged both responding personnel to kill him.



Before either could respond, the child’s father said, “If you kill him, I’ll end the world.”



While this seems an absurd threat out of context, personnel decided to hear him out.



At the end of the conversation, it was agreed that the Agency of Helping Hands would make every effort to keep the child alive in exchange for his father’s cooperation.



For comprehensive information on the child’s father, please review [the report for Inmate 9 (Ward 1, “Son of Hadron”).](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hv9ta5/fuck\_hipaa\_my\_new\_patient\_hates\_me\_and\_theres/)



It must be noted that the father is incarcerated at AHH-NASCU. 



His son, Jackson T., is currently undergoing treatment via a joint effort of the Medical Division and Research and Development Unit.



All efforts have failed. Jackson still suffers excessive pain related to his decomposition. The only beneficial treatment consists of direct blood transfusions from Inmate 22 (Ward 1, “Lifeblood”), which have halted Jackson’s decomposition but not reversed it.



At this time, the Agency has been unable to treat Jackson’s pain.



It must be noted that Jackson’s pain and decomposition are a direct result of the fact that he simply does not belong here. Like any organism thrust into a hostile environment in which it is not suited for, he is dying.



Jackson is not only aware of this, but has frequently begged personnel to let him die.



However, such sentiments are typically expressed when Jackson is in extremis.



Jackson is a pleasant if very shy child of approximately eleven years. He has expressed embarrassment surrounding his appearance, and has frequently stated to the staff psychiatrist that “how I look on the outside is how I am on the inside.”



Jackson’s diagnoses include complex post traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, severe general vascular disease, generalized necrosis, monocular blindness of the left eye, and synesthesia.



Jackson is also generally resistant to, or at a minimum shy of, women.



The exception is Inmate 22 (Ward 1, “Lifeblood”) who in addition to forming a vital part of his treatment plan has forged a strong friendship with him. Jackson looks up to her. She is his only peer and arguably his only friend.



Jackson has also expressed attachment to staff psychiatrist Dr. Wingaryde and T-Class Agent Christophe W., who was involved in his containment and has visited the child on a regular basis since bringing him into custody.



At the child’s request, both Inmate 22 and Christophe W. him attended his session with the Agency’s specialized interviewer.



It must be noted that the interviewer (that’s me) is genetically identical to his deceased mother, with whom he had a greatly strained and psychologically abusive relationship. While Jackson cognitively understands that the interviewer is not his mother, the content of his interview demonstrates a high and very understandable degree of transference.



Due to the child’s intense fear of meeting an individual who is, for all intents and purposes, his mother, he postponed the meeting three times before Dr. Wingaryde successfully convinced him to proceed.



It must be noted that the child’s connection to Inmate 7 (Ward 1, “The Heart Bird”) was not known prior to this interview. Based on the information he provided, this is considered an emergent situation. Administration is evaluating him for reclassification to inmate status as a result.



Directly following his interview, the child consented to demonstrate one of his abilities to attending staff.





**Interview Subject: Jackson T.**

***Classification String: Cooperative/ Destructible/ \*\*Under Review/ Constant/ Low/ \*\*Under Review***

**Interviewers: Rachele B. & Christophe W.**

**Interview Date: 2/2/2025**











I’m sorry if anything I tell you doesn’t make sense. So much of this happened when I was little, so it’s hard to remember it all, and it’s hard to focus anyway because everything inside me and outside me hurts so much.



Every time I die, I go to a room with eight walls.



Seven of the walls are soft like cushions. Three are full of holes. Four are solid like walls are supposed to be.



The eighth wall is just darkness. 



I went to the room for the first time when I was a baby, before I could even talk. I crawled across to one of the walls that had holes because voices were coming through.



Voices have colors that look like light. Happy voices are yellow. Voices with love are red. Those were the colors coming through the holes in the walls, like little rivers of light.



The yellowest voice was my mom’s. I didn’t even know my mom’s voice could be happy. It was almost scary to hear her happy.



I tried to look through the holes to see her, but they were too high and I was too little. It made me cry.



While I was crying, another voice came through a different hole in the wall.



This voice was a scary color, kind of yellow and kind of blue and kind of white. It was so bright it burned my eyes and made it so I couldn’t see.



“Why are you crying?” the voice asked.



I knew what it was asking, but I was too little to answer. The voice was so bright I had to close my eyes, but that didn’t help. It didn’t even help when I covered them. The light was so bright it burned right through my hands. I was too little to be scared of being blind, but I was old enough to be scared of my eyes burning out.



“Don’t cry,” said the blinding voice. “I’m not scary. I’m just a Heart Bird. I came to be your friend, but first you have to let me in. Where are you?”



I knew it was looking through the holes in the walls, but they were so high and I was so little that it couldn’t see me. I was glad because I knew it was a monster. Only a monster can have a voice that burns everything.



I cried for a long time. Maybe for an hour. Maybe for a day. Maybe for forever.



The thing with the burning voice talked to me for that whole long time.



When the long time was finally over, a tunnel opened on the other side of the room. I heard Dad’s voice inside it, so I crawled in.



Crawling through that tunnel made everything hurt. Everything. Like I was burning.



But my dad was on the other side and the monster with the blinding voice was behind me, so I crawled even though it hurt.



At the other end of the tunnel was my house. My old house with my mom and my dad and my old dog Jerry, who ran away when I was five. But I wasn’t five yet, so he was still there.



When Jerry saw me, he wagged his tail so hard it thumped like a drum. The thumps were red and yellow, just like a happy voice.



When my mom saw me, she cried. There was no red or yellow in her crying.



Just dead white.



I know the eight-wall room isn’t really here. Well, I guess it’s maybe somewhere, but I don’t know where and I can’t take you there. It’s just where I go when I die.



And I’ve died a lot.



I need to stay dead, but my dad won’t let me.



I love my dad and my mom. But I knew they didn’t really love me because of their voices.



I see the colors in voices. Happy voices are yellow and bright brown, like the sun shining through leaves in the fall. Love is red and sometimes really bright purple. Sad voices are grey, and sometimes the shiny blue color inside mussel shells. Calm voices are green and a different kind of grey that makes me smile. It would make you smile if you saw it, too. Angry voices are orange. Jealous voices look like lightning. 



Mean voices are scary brown. Not good brown, but dead brown. Kind of like the color in some of the holes in my skin. Rotten brown. It scared me to death.



My dad’s voice was always dead brown because he was always mean, but I don’t think he knew he was mean. You can’t make someone be nice if they don’t even know they’re being mean.



Sometimes Mom was mean too. But her voice was never completely brown. It was a little bit purple too. Bad purple, like a cloudy puffy bruise that’s open to open up, like this hole in my hand here. I think it’s because love was mixed up in in the meanness, and she wished it wasn’t. I think she wished there was no love at all.



But mostly, her voice was just dead white.



That color scared me even more than my dad’s.



A lot of things about you — I mean, about my mom — scared me.



Dad always said she had darkness inside her. When he got mad at me, he said I was dark like her. But I don’t think Mom was dark. She wasn’t light either. There wasn’t darkness or light in her at all.



That’s because my dad kept her that way.



My dad was made out of dead fire. I know that sounds made up. But it’s not. No one could see the fire but me, just like no one can see voice colors but me. It doesn’t mean they’re not real. It just means you don’t see.



Live fire burns fast. Dead fire burns slow.



Dad burned Mom away slowly, both her brightness and her darkness. He burned away so much of it almost nothing was left.



And whatever was left, I took.



That’s what she told me sometimes, when her voice was the most rotten purple brown. *Your dad takes almost everything, and you take the rest.*



She wasn’t lying.



Dad’s dead fire burned me, too. The only time it didn’t burn me was when Mom was there. She kept me from burning by letting him burn her even faster.



I didn’t ask her to. I didn’t want her to. But she did it anyway, and I guess that’s her voice was rotten purple-brown.



I had lots of dreams about my mom being happy, with a voice that was yellow and red and sunlight brown and bright, happy purple. I was always with her in these dreams. Dad never was. The only dreams Dad was in were nightmares.



That made me sad. Dad really doesn’t want to be mean. He really doesn’t. He just can’t help it anymore. And I think he’s only mean because of me. He definitely was only mean to my mom because of me. 



He was so mean to her. I still have bad dreams about how mean he was to her.



He was so mean she ran away when I was a baby. That’s the first time I died. He kept being so mean that she ran away again when I was four years old.



I died after she left. I always die when my mom leaves.



I went back to the room. Eight walls, one made of darkness. Seven soft like cushions, three of them with holes. I remembered from when I was a baby. There were more holes than last time, and more voices. Yellow, sunlight brown, red, bright purple. Good colors.



But not the only colors.



Because the monster with the terrible voice — the Heart Bird — was outside the room. He put his eye against a hole. It was bright like the sun.



“Hello,” he said. “Are you ready to be friends?”



His horrible voice was so bright it filled the whole room. Like death turned into light.



“Please let me in.” It put its other eye against the hole. This eye was the color of the moon. “Please.” 



That’s when I heard your voice, and I saw it too. Dark, happy red and sunlight brown, curling through a hole near the floor.



I ignored the monster even though it kept begging me to let it in, and crawled over to the hole with your voice.



The monster’s voice burned all the other voices except yours.



I peeked through the hole and saw you.



I watched you for a long time. Maybe for an hour or a day or maybe forever. You were so happy.



I only stopped watching when the tunnel opened up behind me. If the monster with the death-light voice  wasn’t there, I might have ignored the tunnel and kept looking at you anyway.



But he was there, and his eyes were almost as scary as his voice, so when the tunnel opened up I crawled back through.



You were there at the other end., but your voice wasn’t red and yellow. It was dead white again. Almost like the death voice, but dull instead of bright. 



I tried to tell you about what I saw. How there was a place where your voice was red and yellow. “You need to go there, Mommy. Let’s run away.”



You said, “I can’t run away because of you.”



I asked why you couldn’t just run away and take me too.



“Because you’re a trap,” you said. 



I didn’t know what that meant, so I asked Dad when he got home. 



I’m sorry. I’m so sorry for telling him. I’m sorry for what he did to you.



I know that’s why you ran away again, and that’s why I didn’t ask you to take me. I didn’t want to trap you. I just wanted you to get away. To find the place where your voice was red and yellow.



I wasn’t even sad when I died again. I always die when you leave. That time wasn’t any different.



When I woke up in the eight-walled room, I was scared of the Heart Bird. But it wasn’t there this time. No scary eyes, no death-light voice. Just a lot of other voices with happy colors curling up out of the holes and into the air like smoke.



Your voice was there. It was the brightest of all, so red and so yellow and so purple and so sunlight brown. 



I found the hole in the wall that all your colors came from and peeked through.



You were holding a baby and you were with an old lady. You were so happy. I watched for a really long time. I kept wondering who the baby was. I thought maybe I had a secret brother, and that’s why your voice at home was dead white — because he wasn’t with us.



It made me feel sad and a little scared, and a lot jealous. You were never happy with me how you were happy with that baby.



I watched for a long time. Maybe an hour, maybe a day, maybe forever.



Then the tunnel opened up behind. I was so jealous I crawled back through even though it hurt.



You were waiting at the other end. No baby, no red or yellow or purple or bright brown. Just your dead white voice.



When you saw me, you cried.



You tried to run away a few times after that, but Dad always stopped you. I know I never helped you. I’m so sorry. I still am.



I’m not sorry for seeing your happy voice every time I died and went to the eight-walled room, though.



But I am sorry for how badly he hurt you. I still have bad dreams about it. He hurt you so bad he stopped you running away for a long time.



You tried again when I was older. I caught you right before you left. I was glad. I thought you were running away to the place where your voice was happy.



I wanted you to go.



I also wanted to go with you. I wanted to be there with you. I didn’t understand why you didn’t want me there.



So I asked you why.



You said, “You can’t come, Jack. He’ll just come for you. You’ll be okay with him. He loves you. He won’t hurt you like me.”



I didn’t know if you meant *He won’t hurt you like he hurts me,* or if you meant, *He won’t hurt you like I will*. 



I think you meant both.



I died again when you left, and I woke up in the room. There were more holes than ever, but the monster bird wasn’t outside. Just the happy voices in all their different colors. I heard yours. I always heard yours, no matter how many other voices there were.



I went to look, and you were here.



Not here like in this room. But here in this place. In this prison.



I didn’t know it was a prison, though. I thought it was a hospital and my mom was there to get better. I was sad that I wasn’t alive to see her get better, but I was glad I got to see her happy.



Only it wasn’t her.



It was you.



I just didn’t know it yet, so I watched you for a long time.



I’m not sure how long. The only reason I didn’t watch you forever was because my skin started hurting.



When I looked down to see why, my skin was opening up into holes. Like…like when you put a magnifying glass over a piece of paper and it starts burning without catching on fire. That’s what my skin looked like, and it hurt. It hurt like fire.



That scared me.



I was so scared I called for you, but you didn’t hear me.



That’s okay. My voice was a bad color. My voice is always a bad color when I’m scared. Dead white, just like yours used to be.



Then the tunnel opened up behind me.



I didn’t want to go back. I wanted to stay and watch you. I wanted to be brave and let all of my skin open up so that I would die and you wouldn’t be trapped anymore.



But it hurt so bad.



So I crawled back through the tunnel. My mom was there on the other end, and her voice was dead white. 



“You’re supposed to be dead,” she said. “You’re supposed to be dead and I’m supposed to be gone.”



My dad got so mad at her. But he was happier to see me than he was mad at her, so he didn’t hurt her. He just picked me up and cried. Even though he was crying, his voice was happy yellow. I think that’s the only time my dad’s voice was ever yellow, except for the times he hurt my mom. It was almost always yellow when he was hurting her.



I didn’t care that his voice was yellow. I just cared about hearing my mom’s red voice again.



I was looking forward to dying again just so I could hear you being happy.



I didn’t have to wait long. She ran away without me again, and I died and went to the room and heard your voice and saw your happy colors coming through a hole in the wall.



You were laughing. Your voice was so red and so yellow it burned, but in a good way. Not a bad way. Like warm fire. Dark, but warm. Not bad fire. And definitely not dead fire. 



I looked through the hole to see you.



It wasn’t the living room where you had the baby, or here at the prison, or any of the other places I saw you. You were outside at night. It was snowing, and you were walking with a man I didn’t know. He wasn’t Dad. That made me really happy. I think if it had been Dad, your voice would have been dead white instead of all those happy colors.



You were talking. I don’t know about what. The man said something like, “It’s not funny when you say it,” but you must have thought what you said was really funny because you laughed so hard.



I never heard you laugh before.



I thought maybe he was protecting you from Dad, and that’s why you could laugh now. I wondered if he’d protect me too if you could see me.



Except I knew he wouldn’t. Because if you were with him, that meant you finally got away. You always said I kept you from running away. That I couldn’t come with you because Dad would always find me. So even if you could see me, I knew you wouldn’t want me there.



While I was watching you, another voice said, “Hello?”



The eight-walled room filled with death light.



The Heart Bird.



I sat up. I was so scared that it could see me. So scared it would see me looking at you and find you. That I was trapping you, just like you always said.



“Let me in,” it said. “Please. I just want to be your friend.”



Its eye peeked through one of the holes. It was the moon eye, but the hole in the wall was so big — all the holes were so big now — that I could see part of its face too. It had a scary beak with teeth.



“I can’t let you in,” I said.  “There’s no door.”



“Your daddy is a bomb and your mommy is a dragon. Either one of them could burn a door. You definitely can.”



That made no sense. Except maybe it did, a little. Because my dad was made of dead fire, and your voice was always red and yellow and so bright.



But it still made no sense.



I don’t want it to make sense.



That’s what I said to the Heart Bird. “That makes no sense.”



“You make no sense,” it said. “But I don’t blame you. Don’t worry. You can still burn a door. Just use this.”



It was hard to see because even though the holes were big, they weren’t *that* big. But they were big enough that I saw…I saw the Heart Bird rip its own eye out. It was the eye that looked like the moon.



And then he pushed it through the hole.



It bumped on the floor and rolled. It was dead white, like Mom’s voice. 



“That’s my good eye, just so you know,” it told me. “My powerful eye.”



I had to close my eyes because it’s voice was so bright. It burned so badly.



“But that’s what friends do,” it said. “They give. I’m your friend. Now you’re mine. Just hold it up to the light. All the happy lights from all the happy voices. Hold it up just like a magnifying glass, and it will burn a door wide open. Once I come in, we’ll be best friends.”



I saw its empty eye socket through the holes, and its sun eye, and its teeth.



Then the tunnel opened up behind me. I ran through.



I got home again.



You were there, with your dead voice. But for once I wasn’t sad. I was happy.



Because I thought I saw the future through the peephole. When you were walking with the man? I thought that was the future. That one day you and me were both going to be happy. We just had to wait for the future to happen.



I don’t remember when I figured out that wasn’t true. I really don’t. 



It was after she ran away a few more times, and after I died. After I got to see you with your happy voice in what I thought was my mom’s future three or four more times.



I do remember when I figured out that every time I saw you happy, I wasn’t there.



I remember figuring out your voice was red and yellow because you weren’t with me.



I hoped I was wrong. I really wanted the snowy night to be your future, and I wanted to be in it. I still do.



So every time I died after that — every time I went to the eight-walled room and followed your happy voice to one of the holes in the wall — I looked for myself. I was never there. You never even said my name. You never even said you had a son.



And then one time I heard you tell someone you had no kids and didn’t want any.



That’s when I knew I wasn’t seeing the future. 



I was just seeing a world without me.



That’s when I figured out everything my mom told me was right. I was a trap. I made her life hell. I made her voice dead white. I wasn’t supposed to be there. I was supposed to be dead, and she was supposed to be gone.



That’s when I knew I had to help her get gone. To go live in one of the worlds without me.



I used the Heart Bird’s eye to burn a door for here. It worked even though I wasn’t dead. But that was good. If I was dead, I wouldn’t have been able to burn the door open for my mom.



It sounds crazy, but the door was easy to make. It opened perfectly. Behind it was three hallways. One in the middle, one to the left, one to the right.



She took the hallway on the left.



I hoped until the very end that she’d take me with her, but she didn’t.



That made me cry so hard. I hate crying. I always have.



I didn’t want to go home yet, mostly because I didn’t want Dad to see me cry, so I went down the hallway on the right instead. It was a short hall. There was a door on the other end.



I hoped it would lead to a world where you were happy. Where I could stand by you for a little while and see your red and yellow and purple voice, even if you couldn’t see me.



But it wasn’t a different world. It was the same world where I lived, but in the past.



Behind the door was my old house with my old dog Jerry who ran away when I was five. When Jerry saw me, he licked me and wagged his tail so hard it thumped. The thumps made red and yellow sounds. 



I heard you and Dad — I mean, my mom and dad — fighting somewhere inside. I saw the little-kid version of myself laying on the couch in the sun. He wasn’t sleeping. His eyes were open.



I didn’t want to look at him, so I went out onto the porch. Jerry followed me.



I looked out at our old backyard, at the swingset and the two apricot trees, and a tricycle I didn’t remember until I saw it.



I pet my dog Jerry who wasn’t here anymore because he ran away, except he was there with me right then.



I cried some more. I cried even harder when holes started opening up in my skin, just like a magnifying glass burning paper.



They hurt.



But they didn’t hurt as much as my feelings did. I know that sounds stupid, but it’s true. Being there at the old house made me so sad. Almost as sad as when you took the left door without me. So I decided to go home. I didn’t want to leave Jerry in the house where you and dad were fighting, where he would run away soon. So I brought him with me.



We went through the door and down the hall back home. His tail wagged the whole time, so hard it swished. Even the swishy sounds were yellow and red. 



And a few minutes after we got home, he started falling apart.



It hurt him too. I could tell it hurt because it made him whine.



He fell apart into holes like a magnifying glass burns into paper, just like my skin. And then he kept falling apart into pieces of fire that burned out in the air. I tried to stop it but I couldn’t.



I couldn’t.



That’s when I figured out that my dog Jerry never ran away. I killed him.



That meant I killed you too, so I went looking for you, down the left hand hallway.



It was so long, and it was full of holes.



I peeked through all of them, calling your name and trying to find your voice.



But I couldn’t hear it.



I walked for a long time. Maybe ten minutes, maybe an hour, maybe a day, maybe forever.



Finally, at the very end of the hallway, I saw another door.



I ran toward it, but then I heard a clacking sound, like…like bone feathers and claws.



And the Heart Bird squeezed through a giant hole in the hallway wall and stood in front of the door. I knew it was the Heart Bird because he had one empty eye socket, one burning eye like the sun, and so many teeth.



I ran away.



I didn’t want him to follow me home, so I went down the center hall. At the end of it was my soft room. I slammed the door. There was a door on it now which was scary, but at least it had a lock. A really strong one, too.



The Heart Bird couldn’t get through. It tried, but it couldn’t.



“Why are you so scared, Jacky?” it asked in the happiest voice. The happiest, brightest, deadest voice that was brightest yellow. Brighter than the sun. Brighter than Dad’s voice when he hurt you. Bright as a supernova. A supernova is death, you know.



The biggest, brightest death.



And that bird’s voice was so happy that it was yellow as the biggest, brightest death.



“Go away,” I said. “I don’t want you here. You’re not my friend.”



“You let me in.”



“No.”



"You let us all in.”



"I won’t!”



“You do. You open the door. You let us in. You let us in to eat. Your daddy is a bomb. Your mommy is a dragon. I’m the best friend you’ll ever have. Best friends let each other in.”



Behind me, the tunnel opened again.



I ran back home. But I hoped I wouldn’t make it. I hoped I would die on the way home, because somehow I knew the Heart Bird was right. I’m the one who makes the doors. I’m the one who lets the death light in.



I’m how the supernova gets inside and kills us all.



But I didn’t die. I got home. My skin was full of holes — magnifying glass holes — but I was home.



You were home too.



I cried. So did you. For the first time there was red in your voice instead of dead white.



You hugged me, and then you made me talk.



I told you everything about the room and the other you and the Heart Bird. I showed you the holes in my skin that only I could see, the holes that look like what magnifying glasses to do paper.



I told you that I have to be dead. Really dead for good, or the supernova crawls in and burns us all up.



You thought it was your fault, but it’s not. It’s not mine either. It’s nobody’s fault. It just is.



And I’m so tired of dying and coming back. It always hurts. I got so used to hurting I didn’t even notice I was hurting. But just because I didn’t notice doesn’t mean it didn’t hurt.



And it did. It hurt and hurt and got worse every time I crawled through the tunnel and came back home.



I was so tried of hurting. Tired enough to die.



When I told you that, you cried some more.



Then you and Dad had the biggest fight ever.



Your dead white, and his dead fire.



Dead fire won.



That’s the night his dead fire starting burning tunnels that didn’t close up anymore. Tunnels that spread into dark holes, like when a magnifying glass burns paper. Tunnels only I could see.



You ran away one last time. Not to leave me, but to kill me so I could stay dead like I wanted.



Except it didn’t work. Dad wouldn’t let it work. He’s the one who made the tunnels. They’re dead fire, just like him. He chased you through the tunnels. You didn’t have a chance.



When I came back, my mom and I decided to burn another door to a place Dad’s tunnels couldn’t reach and escape together. To die for good. I was so happy to go with her. I wasn’t even scared of dying forever because I would be with her.



I burned open a door and went inside.



Inside was dark but bright. A black ocean filled with stars.



And inside the ocean were giant things made of light and teeth.



When they saw us, the started swimming over.



I didn’t care. I was ready. I wanted to die in a place Dad couldn’t tunnel to.



But when the teeth-light got close, you shoved me through the door right as it got you.



I fell back into the living room. 



I should have closed the door, but I didn’t want to leave you there. I wanted to be wherever you were. And if I closed the door, there would be no chance.



So I didn’t close it.



The door grew. It got so big. It got taller and taller and spread so high, past the ceiling and into the sky.



And the teeth-light got in.



It got into everything and swallowed all the darkness and all the light.



My dad got me out. He didn’t use my door. He used his tunnel. His tunnel of dead fire.



The tunnel shook because everything on the outside was falling apart. 



I wanted to fall apart too. I wanted to be falled apart with my dog and with you



Dad and crawled out onto the other side of the tunnel and looked back. Everything was dead. Starry darkness and dead fire, just like dad, with the teeth light swimming through.



I fell asleep watching everything die.



I thought I would die too.



I need to die.



But my dad won’t let me.



When I was in the eight-walled room, I saw your voice so many times. Red and yellow and bright happy brown and crazy purple. I wished you talked to me with those colors, just one time. But you never did. That’s okay. You never could, because you belong in a life without me.



I saw Dad’s voice a few times, too. I just didn’t look at him as much. But his voice was never dead brown when I heard it in the eight-walled room. It was always yellow.



Every time I followed his voice and looked through, I saw him in the room where you’re holding the baby. Where you’re smiling with the old lady.



Even though my dad was in the room, you didn’t see him. I think he was invisible, like me.



Except the baby saw him. It kept smiling at him and reaching for him. 



I wonder if the baby was me. 



Because if that baby was me, it means Dad wants a life with a different me. 



I could tell, by the way he was looking at that baby, that he’d choose him over me in a heart bird. I mean a heartbeat.



Dad wants to live with a different me and a different you.



You want to live without both of us.



I want to live with both of you.



I think that means I don’t belong.



I died so many times that I was able to look through all little holes into all the other places. Dad was in some. You were in some.



I’m in none.



Only you.



Only you’re supposed to be.



I’m not.



When I figured that out, I tried to die one last time.



I burned a tunnel of my own. It wasn’t dead fire, though. It was grey and blue like the inside of a mussel shell, with a little bit of red. 



I followed the tunnel all the way back to where everything got killed by the teeth-light. Where my mom died. Where the teeth-light were still swimming in the starry dark.



I was so happy.



But at the end of the tunnel, the Heart Bird was waiting for me with its single sun eye and supernova voice.



“I’m glad you came,” it clacked. “It’s time to let us in.”



And then I heard my dad.



My dad had followed me through the tunnel. I turned around and saw him, all dead fire.



Dead fire behind me.



Death light in front of me.



Both burning.



Both destruction.



But my dad loves me. The Heart Bird doesn’t.



That’s why I had to go with Dad.



I knew the Heart Bird would kill my dad if I tried to leave, so I tricked it.



“I’m your friend,” I told it. “Your best friend! Come here.”



When it got close, I pulled out its sun eye so it wouldn’t be able to see Dad.



Its blood burned.



It still burns. 



It burns and burns and burns.



I touched the Heart Bird with my burning hands. With my dead fire that burned me down to nothing while the Heart Bird thrashed and screamed and my dad cried.



Even though everything hurt, I smiled. Because I was dead. I had to be dead for real now, and I would stop hurting when I was dead.



But no.



I woke up in the tunnel with my dad.



The tunnel was full of holes. The Heart Bird was only smoking bones. 



I heard things on the outside. Clacking and bone snapping and teeth and most of all, supernova voices that wanted to eat.



I must have died there in the tunnel with my dad, because at the end of the tunnel was the door to my eight-walled room.



And I listened for your voice, Mom. Your happy red voice.



I heard it. I always hear your happy red voice.



I followed your voice to the right hole and used the Heart Bird’s eye to burn it big and wide. Dad and I crawled through.



That’s how we got here. To the world where you’re happy.



A world where I don’t exist.



That’s why I’m falling apart, just like my dog Jerry. He wasn’t supposed to be outside of his world, so he died. I’m not supposed to be anywhere. That’s why I’m full of holes and falling into pieces.



Dad fixes me up with new pieces all the time.



I wish he wouldn’t.



Other people have to die for him to fix me up. That’s not fair. Killing people just to fix someone who is supposed to be dead. Who was supposed to never be is sick.



And I’m not just dying. That’s the worst part. I’m burning holes in this place, just like a magnifying glass on paper. You can’t see the holes, but I can.



They’re still small. That’s because dead fire burns slow. Really slow. But it burns hot too, and the holes are getting bigger. Someday they’ll be big enough for the Heart Birds to come through with their supernova voices.



You have to kill me before that happens.



That’s what I told my mom back when she made me talk: If I live, everything dies.



As long as I die, everything lives.



You have to let me die.



And you have to keep Dad from bringing me back.



You have to, Mom.



Please.



I’ll show you.

Jack reached for me, and the moment his hands closed over mine, I saw.



A dozen small holes, some bright, some dark, some in between. A few were in the walls, a couple in the ceiling, most in the floor. They moved lazily, drifting like kelp in a slow tide.



“They’ll close up once I’m not in here,” Jack said. “But there are some in my room that won’t go away anymore. They’re growing. Once they burn big enough, things will crawl through. They’re waiting. The scouts, I mean. Look.”



He pointed to one on the ceiling. I looked up, and saw an eye — a golden eye with a dark red pupil — staring back.



“They know I’m here,” he said. “They know I’m burning. They’re waiting. You have to stop my dad. You have to let me die. My mom would have. You should too.”



I was stunned. Too stunned and too overwhelmed to really process anything I’d heard, let alone that eye



“No,” I said. “That’s bullshit. Someone here will figure out how to help you.”



“You can’t help a fish on land. You can’t help a bird in the ocean. You can’t help me here. I died in the only place I didn’t fall apart, and it’s gone anyway.”



“I will help you,” I said. I was vaguely aware that I was tearing up, which was strange. I didn’t feel sad. I didn’t even feel emotional. So what the hell? Crying in front of a kid who hates crying? Great work. Truly.



“Your voice is red. I don’t think it will stay red once you understand.” He looked down. “I don’t want to talk to you anymore. I need you to go away. I’m sorry. ”



“It’s okay. Don’t apologize.” Then — because it’s what I do, I guess — I squeezed his hands and gently let go.



Once he left, I did too. Christophe started to follow me, but I responsibly told him I needed space. He respectfully told me to get him if I needed anything, which actually happened a few hours later.



And it was fine. I thought I was okay.



I really did.



Honestly, I felt more unsettled by various aspects of my general workplace drama than I did by Jack. I even managed to work and socialize without too much trouble. I really thought I was fine.



I thought that for close to two days.



And then it crashed over me like a mega tsunami, and I had a full bore breakdown. 



Full bore.



Like that wasn’t bad enough, the Harlequin came marching into my room right as I was starting to recover.



“Parenthood,” he said. “I understand.”



“He’s not my kid.”



“You really do love denying familial bonds. I find it very upsetting, but it’s also a relief knowing you deny people who aren’t me, too.”



“Respectfully, I can’t deal with you now.”



“You can’t deal with an offer to help your son who isn’t your son but also is?”



It took me a minute to figure out the last part of his sentence, and I was afraid I’d misinterpreted the first part. “You can help him?”



“We can,” he said. “If we work together.”



“How?”



“It’s a multistep process that begins with killing his father.”



This was honestly one of the least objectionable things the Harlequin has ever suggested.



“How?” I asked.



“I don’t know, or I already would have done it. You’re a dragon. Nothing kills dragons, not even bombs. This task, I’m afraid, is entirely on you. The good news is I can handle the rest.”



“Do you mean it? Are you lying? Is there a catch? Is this a joke? Are you going to fuck it up?”



“Yes. No. No, other than handling the father on your own. No. Possibly, but not on purpose. And the best part is, I won’t ask for anything in return.”



“Why?”



“A grandson who is half nuclear bomb and half dragon would be my pride and joy. He even has my hair.”



God forgive me, bless me, damn me, whatever — I laughed until I cried.



That happened this afternoon.



I’ve felt a lot better since.



Don’t get me wrong. I have no idea what to do, or how. Other than the Harlequin himself, Asher is probably the most dangerous inmate in the Pantheon.



But if killing him saves that boy, he’s already dead. I won’t even get in trouble. Everyone in Administration wants him dead. They just don’t know how to do it.



I don’t know how either.



But I’m about to figure it out.
