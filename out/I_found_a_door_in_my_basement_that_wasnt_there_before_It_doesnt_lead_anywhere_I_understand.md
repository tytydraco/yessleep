I live in a small house just outside a town I won’t name—honestly, I’m not even sure it matters anymore. The people here are nice in that leave-you-alone-until-you-need-help way. The neighborhood’s quiet. My basement’s not.

That’s where this starts.

I moved in after a messy split and needed the solitude. The basement was unfinished but dry—perfect for storage. There was only one door down there, leading to the utility closet. Until about two weeks ago.

I was reorganizing boxes when I noticed it.

A second door.

No knob, no handle. Just a tall, narrow rectangle flush with the wall, painted in the same faded gray as the cinderblock. It hadn’t been there before. I know it hadn’t. I’ve been in that basement every weekend since moving in. I touched it. It was cold. Too cold.

That night, I dreamed of knocking. 

Not mine, something else’s. 

A slow, deliberate rhythm that came from the basement stairs. I woke up sweating, heart thudding so hard I could hear it in my ears. I tried to laugh it off. Maybe I was just rattled. I hadn’t been sleeping well.

The next morning, I went downstairs to probe to myself it was just a dream.

The door was open.

Barely. Maybe an inch.

And behind it: blackness. Not darkness. Blackness. A kind of nothing that swallowed the light from my phone flashlight like it was starving.

I slammed it shut, only it didn’t slam— because it didn’t make any sound at all. Even when it clicked back into place, it was like someone had muted the world around it.

I called a contractor. Just said I was concerned about the structural integrity. He poked around for ten minutes, before telling me, very carefully, that there was only one door down there. 

When I took him down to show him—yeah. 
You guessed it.

The second door was gone.

I laughed too loud. I couldn’t stop. The man looked scared of me. Asked if I had someone I could call.

That night, the knocking came again. Louder. Closer.

This time, I didn’t dream it.

I stood at the top of the stairs, listening to the slow, wet sound of something rapping against wood. I don’t know how long I stood there. But when I turned to go back to bed, I saw muddy footprints behind me. Small. Bare. Like a child’s. 

Only I live alone.

I don’t go down there anymore.

But the door does.

Because now, I see it in the corner of my vision, even when I’m upstairs. I see it reflected  in windows, hovering behind me like it’s waiting to be noticed.

It wants to be opened again.

And I think—I know—that if I do, I won’t come back.

Please. If anyone’s experienced something like this… if there’s anyone else who’s seen that door… tell me what’s in the other side.

Because last night, I heard it whisper my name.

And this morning, it was spelled in dirt on my bedroom floor.
