Six weeks after Lisa’s death, I succeeded.  
  
She had been killed outside her front door. She had been talking to me on her phone all along her 10-minute walk from the bar- he had struck as soon as she hung up.  
  
And now I would see her again. Everything warned against raising the dead, but they hadn’t known what it was to lose a friend like Lisa. I needed her back, and if it meant the bowels of hell had to open for that to happen, so be it.  
  
I sat at the kitchen table, waiting. I wasn't sure how she would manifest, but I knew she would. I heard a rattle at my front door. Then Lisa walked in, dressed in the same flowery blue and red dress she had been wearing on the day of her murder, and plonked down where she always sat in her chair across me. I almost expected her to say “Ugh what a day! Grab me a mug will ya?”  
  
But she didn’t. She looked at me, her eyes wide, her skin glowing as if she had returned from a spa, rather than literally from the dead and said “Hey Charlie”.  
  
I had never heard her call me Charlie. I hated that nickname- Lisa knew that.  
  
“Lisa?” I said.  
  
A gleam of yellow flashed beneath her lower lids. She smiled and she seemed to have no teeth.  
  
“Are you ready?”  
  
The high of success and the joy of seeing Lisa was ebbing fast, replaced by inching fear.  
  
“You don’t have a plan- you never had one did you, Charlie. I always had to plan everything.”  
  
She smashed her fist on the kitchen table so hard everything, including me, jumped. “Everything! You’re such a fucking mooch!” she screamed, her mouth gaping black.  
  
I froze. But her words stung. I remembered when we had a mild disagreement over Friday night plans, and she said “Charlotte, if you don’t like my plans, feel free to make your own”- I couldn’t explain I couldn’t plan things like she did, but she hadn’t realised how tired I was. I ended up going along and we had a fantastic time. It was always a fantastic time with Lisa.  
  
That’s why I brought her back. I don’t know how to have a fantastic time by myself.  
  
Now however, Dead Lisa wasn’t in the mood to plan anything fantastic. Her hand shot out, her arm elongating like a cartoon rubber superhero, and she gripped my wrist. I winced.  
  
“We’re going to get him, right? That’s why you did this.”  
  
I swallowed. What she said made sense, but I hadn’t thought about it. That was how our friendship had always been.  
  
Lisa squeezed my wrist harder. “You haven’t thought about it have you?” She began screaming again. I shuddered at the terrible sound and her gaping black mouth.  
  
“Listen to me, Charlie. We are going to hunt that motherfucker who did this to me, together. And bring him down. And then you can rest. Understand?”  
  
Whimpering, I nodded.  
  
“Great. Get your laptop- I haven’t lost my internet stalking skills despite being dead” she laughed, and it sounded exactly how you would imagine a murdered woman's laugh to sound. “Remember how I used to look up all our Tinder dates?”  
  
I did remember. I opened my laptop. Maybe I would have a fantastic time after all.
