I am an highschooler, I need to face some serious bullying case and some abuse case, I used to do some self harm when im 13 years old, but one day...

It's a normal day, like always I go to school, just sitting on the table, nobody like used to talk to me after what has happen, but one day my old best friend daniel Moved to my school im very happy to see him, he is my only best friend. 

One day I met him at the canteen, I saw him seating alone, so then I came to him and ask him how is he, is he fine, have some new friend, he say he was fine and that he wasn't expected to see me here, he say that he has no friend, and happy to see me.we then have a talk about when we was a kid and having so much fun, he dont know about the incident, not yet... 

After talking for a while, the bell ringing, meaning that I need to get back to my class, our class is different but I don't care, we would still be the best friend, after the class ended I met him again at the bus stop we then sit next to each other in the bus, I then invited him to visit my house but he refuse, saying that he need to get home quick. It's fine, I could meet him tommorow. 

Like usual he sit alone at canteen, but he looks weird, like he didn't sleep,i then try to ask him but he say it's nothing, and then like usual after the bell ringing I get into my class, we doing this for almost a month now, but he seems to be more tired than the day before and tomorrow he will look tired than yesterday. 

One day he ask me, why do i wear the hoodie, I then say that it's nothing just for fashion. He say he dont believe me because I'm not type of fashion guy, so then I need to tell him the truth, he pretty shocked at first, he then ask 'is it.... Is it that good?' im pretty shocked at first, but then I say that I don't know it just feel satisfying I say, he then say maybe we should try together sometime and then laugh like a maniac, I know he was kidding. Right?.....

Finally after two month inviting him to visit my house he finally agree,we then get into my room and play some Xbox game, he then say that he bring surprise for me, I'm excited what the surprise is... 

It's midnight, he then tell me that he about to show the surprise, he then give me the razor blade, he also bring one out for himself, I know what he doing, we about to have fun tonight, that night is my fucking best night, but then I waked up, realizing it just a dream, I then look at my side, oh yeah he already dead, it just a corpse 'right mom and dad?' I look at my right, wait yeah, they won't talk.... 
Not anymore...... 

I shouldn't be sleeping with this in my room, maybe you all would never hear from me again, haha

Mom,dad you just need to wait a little bit more you both and my friend will meet me soon,
