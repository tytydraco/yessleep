My mother is very fond of gardening and loves planting flowering plants. We live in an area which is hot and humid, so the plants need diligent care. We have plants of many types and climates in our backyard, which require special attention, including many roses and hibiscus plants. 

My maternal aunt loves to travel, and has lived through her share of many unique experiences. She had just returned from her month-long trip to Europe. Knowing about my mom's fondness for flowering plants, she could not think of anything more perfect than the gift she was going to give her.

The previous week she had come to visit us and before leaving, handed my mom a plant. It had a weak pale greenish stem, droopy leaves, and a very small bud poking out. 

"Here, J. I got this specially for you." She said excitedly.

My mom, who looked concerned about the health of the plant, looked at it and replied with confusion in her voice, "Thanks but, what is this? It looks so weak. How will it possibly survive?"

"I got this from a forest in Romania. A wildflower maybe.There were many flowers blooming in a bush, and they looked so beautiful that I decided to give you one. Here, I have taken a picture, look." She scrolled up her gallery to show a picture.

There was a bush, about 2 to 3 feet from the ground, with numerous vine like creepers going into the soil. And on them were big flowers. Dark red. The petals looked shiny. And wet. 

Needless to say, my mom immediately fell in love with those flowers. 

“Oh, I can't thank you enough! I feel this is what was missing from my garden all this time!” She kissed her sister on the cheek.

And that's how the plant made its way into the backyard.

Our backyard area was full of exotic and indigenous plants that my mother grew. So automatically, it attracted many birds and small animals. I used to feed them often, with seeds and fruits. 

My mom planted the plant in a shady corner, under two other tall trees, so it received less light. The plant remained droopy the whole day. We thought that maybe it needed some time to adjust to its surroundings. I watered it in hopes of reviving it for a bit, but to no avail. It remained droopy as ever.

That night, I was laying on my bed scrolling my phone when my eyes fell on the backyard through my window. The plant looked fresh.

Weird, I thought to myself. I called my mother and showed her. She seemed overjoyed, but I could not shake off the weird feeling at the back of my mind.

Over the next few days, the birds and animals coming to our yard had been drastically reduced. I used to feed them everyday, but still they seemed to not come as much. It was not like there were predators in the area, but as if someone, or some thing had been keeping them away. 

As the animals reduced, my mom had been frequenting her trips to the backyard. 

She used to take a long time tending to her plants even before, but now it seemed excessive. Her schedule had fully changed. Usually, my father used to come home from work quite late and we used to have dinner together so as to spend some good family time. But my mom used to come so late from the backyard, that even my father looked confused.

One day, he confronted her.

"What are you doing in the backyard late at night? You didn't take so much time before."

"I am just looking after my new plant." she said while looking at the floor.

Dad looked confused. Then he asked mom to look up so that we could see her face. I was bewildered to look at her. Has she always been this pale? Her eyes looked tired, and she had a weird tense feeling on her face.

"I don't know, I feel like I need to look after the plant a bit more." She muttered under her breath.

The plant in that shady undergrowth, looked much more plump and strong in the meantime. It had flowered. A single flower with five dark red petals. A single tube-like appendage in the middle. To attract flies maybe? I don't know. 

I used to stare out of my window, at the plant. It was about 2 feet tall by now, spreading its long vines and leaves all over the area. I had noticed that the plant did not lose either a leaf or a petal over these few days. Usually flowers dry up within a few days, but this flower seemed to look healthy as ever.

My mom was getting significantly paler now, so I offered to help her as she made some cookies. While mixing the ingredients on the countertop, I saw a small cut on her hand.

"How did you get that cut? It looks kind of deep."

"I don't remember exactly. Maybe from the rose bushes? They have big thorns."

Well in fact, she did get cut by her rose bushes a lot, but none looked this deep.

“Do not worry, it doesn't hurt.” She said, a tired smile spreading across her face. But it did not cease my anxiety. 

Everytime I took a stroll in our garden, I could not shake off the feeling of dread whenever I approached that part of the yard. The atmosphere certainly did seem off since the plant had flowered. Whatever birds had been coming, everyone had left. 

There was an eerie silence. All the plants looked kind of disoriented. Everyone, except that one. It had grown bigger and wider. With its vine-like leaves and big, red flowers. There were many flowers on the bush. The flowers did seem kind of beautiful. I could not seem to fathom how rapidly the whole plant grew.

I carefully leaned closer to inspect the flowers. A very sweet, intoxicating smell seemed to come from them. I wanted to smell them. Those flowers. A deep red colour. The colour mixing into my vision. With the smell. So beautiful. So fragrant. I moved in closer.

"Cat!" It was my mum. She yelled my name. It seemed to break my trance, as I looked over my head to look at her. She looked awfully pale and angry. As if her eyes were glowing. I had never seen this type of a look on her face. 

"Cat! Come here immediately. Do not touch the flowers I have grown so painstakingly!"

I backed off. I realised that whatever was happening, was happening due to these flowers.

Accompanying my mom in the garden also made me learn quite some things about gardening. So I insisted on tending the plants that fateful day. Even if she seemed unconvinced, her weak health made her give in. 

"You can rest, I will water them today."
I knew that I had to put an end to this commotion. Today itself.

The sun was setting and the sky was becoming dark with dimly lit stars. After watering and tending to all the other plants, I decided to finally save the one for last. I had grabbed an axe from the shed, determined to chop it off.

As I came closer, I felt a sense of dread loom over me. That intoxicating smell... I had to prevent it from affecting myself. 

Tying a handkerchief to shield myself from inhaling those vapors, I brought down the axe right near its roots. 

Worse still, the plant seemed to know what I was doing.

It let out a shrill blood curdling screech. It seemed more like a whistle rather than a screech, but I couldn't care less. I let down another blow. Then I noticed the flowers. 

The petals grew shorter and converged into small bulb-like membranes, and its appendages grew into needle-like structures. 

These needles pierced and went deep underneath my skin, giving me excruciating pain. I could feel these needles digging deep into my flesh and sucking the life out of me, and meanwhile the membrane like sacs filling with what appeared to be my blood.

I pushed through the pain and whacked the stalks of the flowers altogether. The needles withdrew from underneath my skin as it screeched with its horrible whistling sound, and I did not stop whacking my axe until there were bits and pieces of the ‘plant’ left. 

I gathered them all on a plastic bag, and threw them deep into the jungle beyond, and then finally heaved a sigh of relief. 

I was questioned by my concerned family when I narrated the incident. I assumed that they wouldn't believe me until my mother revealed that she had been attracted by the smell of that plant too. Finally when her trance broke she felt pain on her wrist but could not exactly figure out why.

As of now, my mother has started recovering, and she now feels healthy enough to tend to her beloved plants in the garden. We dug a hole in the spot where the plant used to be and spread some weed killers and chemicals hoping that none of it grows again. The animals have been returning, and it all feels lighthearted again.

Until one day I caught a glimpse of something right in that spot - something deep and red.
