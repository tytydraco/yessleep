was running low on gas somewhere between two towns I can’t even remember the names of now. The road had been empty for hours, and my GPS kept recalculating itself into a slow spiral of confusion. That’s when I saw it—a dimly lit gas station flickering in the dark like a dying firefly.

Station 46, the crooked sign read. No brand. No digital prices. Just a cracked window and a rusted-out pump that made a wet choking sound when I pulled the handle. The place looked like it had been abandoned decades ago… yet the lights were on.

I got out anyway. I was desperate.

There was no one behind the counter. The place stank of mold and something older, like wet dirt. Cobwebs clung to the corners of the ceiling, and a single fluorescent bulb buzzed like a swarm of angry flies. I should’ve left. I really should’ve. But something… called me.

Behind the station, tucked between a crooked storage shed and a crumbling brick wall, I found it.

A staircase.

Not a fire escape. Not a cellar door. A full, concrete staircase descending straight into the earth. Lit by a bare bulb every ten steps. The kind of thing you’d expect to see in a parking garage, but this? This was in the middle of nowhere.

My dumbass curiosity got the better of me.

The first few floors were empty. Just a platform, a single steel door, and the stairs continuing down. Each door was numbered in peeling white paint: “B1”, “B2”, “B3”…

I lost track of time.

Some doors creaked when I passed them, like something inside stirred at my presence. I never opened one. I don’t know why—I just knew I shouldn’t.

By floor 10, the air got heavy. Damp. My breath steamed. No sound except the hum of those hanging bulbs and the soft echo of my footsteps.

By floor 20, the doors began to look different—older, like they didn’t belong to any era I recognized. One looked like rotting wood nailed shut from the inside. Another had symbols scratched into it. One had what looked like fingernail marks along the frame.

I wanted to turn back. I really did. But I kept going. That pull in my chest… it wasn’t mine anymore.

I stopped at floor 30.

There was no door.

Just a blank wall where one should’ve been. The bulb above me was out, casting the whole landing in a dusky shadow. But there was something etched into the concrete.

“OPEN.”

I stared at it for a long time before I noticed the hairline crack in the wall. I don’t know what made me do it—God help me—but I pressed my hand to it.

The wall moved.

A hidden door, cold to the touch, hissed open. No sound. Just… silence.

I stood there for what felt like hours. Something in me screamed not to go in. My chest pounded. My hands shook. I knew—I KNEW—what waited in there was wrong. Not evil. Worse.

Hungry.

But I stepped through anyway.

It was pitch black.

And then… it saw me.

I don’t know what I saw. I can’t describe it, because your brain tries to fold in on itself to protect you from that kind of thing. I can tell you that it moved like liquid hate and had eyes where there shouldn’t be any. I heard it speak without sound, felt it pull memories out of my bones. It made me remember things that never happened and forget things that did. I screamed without making a sound.

And then—

I was back.

Standing at the gas pump, full tank, car engine humming. Just like nothing happened.

Except it did.

Because now I dream about the stairwell. Every night. I see the doors. Hear the thing waiting on Floor 30. It wants out. And it’s using me.

I haven’t slept in six days.

Tonight, someone else pulled up to Station 46.

They’re heading toward the back now.

God help them.

The process is about to begin again
