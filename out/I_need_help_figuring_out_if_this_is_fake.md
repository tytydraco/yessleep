Hi everyone! I had a bit of a strange occurrence at work today and I wanted to make sure I wasn't just completely losing it. For some context: I work at an extended stay hotel within Brooklyn, New York. It's not the most luxurious place, it feels a bit on the small side, but we get by. It has 8 floors and the number of space available tends to fluctuate throughout the year (well except for the 5th and 6th floors), but over the years more and more people seem to be moving here on a more permanent basis. The cost per night isn't too bad compared to most extended stay hotels and as a result our tenants will often stay for far longer than they should. I've tried talking with the owner about maybe raising the price a little bit, but he keeps saying that it would break his hearts to send them away and he feels a need to take some pity on our tenants as quite a few are just down on their luck. He says this as he bats both sets of his eyelids making a sad face. It gets me every time so I just drop the subject.

 

Like Mrs. Wilson in 402. She is a window from somewhere in Europe I think, her accent is quite thick. I've tried on multiple occasions to talk with her when she leaves for her nightly strolls, but after that one incident a few days after she moved in it seems like she wants nothing to do to me. On that day she arrived almost around midnight. I was a bit irritated as I was just about to clock out, but the manager insisted that I help get her bags to her room. I politely obliged. Once there I felt her grab my head and put her face right up to my neck. It shocked me, I had never had a woman be so forward. It wasn't that I disliked the attention, but at least give me some warning first. I noticed she began to cough and back away from me.

 

"Is everything ok mam?" She kept coughing

 

"What is that smell on your neck!?" I thought for a moment

 

"Oh! I mixed up my cologne bottle with a bottle of garlic water this morning, I've been trying to cover the smell, but its been pretty pungent throughout the day."

 

She kept coughing, "So was there anything else you needed?" I felt awkward as I didn't want her to think I was rejecting her, but I also could see whatever attraction she had in the moment was gone now.

 

"Just leave." I rushed through the door to gather the rest of her belongings. I was thankful that I wasn't walking away with a hickey, but I did feel like I missed out on a once in a lifetime opportunity. I dropped off the rest of her luggage and the large wooden box she had brought with her and returned to the front desk. 

 

Oh right! My original question. Sorry I'm a bit prone to rambling, especially when talking about odd occurrences or fun stories from around the job. The problem I need help with happened with some new guy who was staying here awhile. He seemed like a completely normal dude, just like anyone else we get around here. For now I'll refer to him as Norm, for how normal he was. I gave him the usual spiel that the manager wants us to tell new tenants for the few days they will be here, things like when payments are due, policy of what happens if they fail to pay on time, avoiding the right hand elevator doors as that's where the giant elevator squid lives, always make sure to use the left hand doors. You know the regular stuff. From there I led him up to his room. He had jumped on the deal we were having with our 5^(th) floor rooms;  
they are the cheapest, yet a lot of people really try to avoid that floor if  
they can. I think it has to do with the Beholder that roams the hallways and  
vaporizes anyone it sees. For those of you who don't know, a Beholder is like a  
giant floating Eyeball, with a bunch of smaller eyes attached to the rest of  
it's body on tentacle-like structures. No one is sure when the Beholder moved  
in, but for a while he created quite a bit of trouble keeping residents to stay  
on that floor as no one wanted to risk vaporization. This went on for a while,  
until good old Jim came to visit. After shooting the shit with him for almost  
an hour, I got a call on the walkie about another Beholder cleanup needing to  
be done. Frustrated, I grabbed my mop and a blowtorch and went to fix up the  
mess. Before I could leave Jim grabbed me by the hand and out of nowhere placed  
a paper bag in it. 

 

"Try using these." Confused I looked in the bag and gave him the craziest look I could manage.

 

"Seriously?"

 

He smiled "Trust me."

 

I took the bag and my equipment and took the left-hand elevator up to the 5^(th) floor. When I entered the halls, it wasn't  
hard to find the mess. I got to work cleaning; ears alert for the sound of his  
movements.....Beholders give off a weird vibrating sound as they hover  
from place to place. I'm used to the quick cleanups being a necessity, but I  
think I got a bit distracted with my cleaning that I didn't notice the  
vibrations. I turned to see him grinning with his eye stalks targeting me. 

 

I shouted "Wait!!" and showed him the brown bag. Curious he paused my immediate vaporization and gave me a chance to pour out a small pile of sour patch kids. He lept on it like a dog getting a treat and began devouring them. He finished the lot in one bite, then to my utter shock, he looked at me and floated away. I'm still in shock to learn that Beholders love sour patch candies. We've experimented a little with other sour candies after that and it only seems interested in sour patch either the kid’s version or the watermelon. We noticed that giving it the kids gives you safe passage for about 10 minutes, but the watermelon seems to make him docile to everyone for almost an hour, though he seems to tire of watermelon if you try giving it to him too often. Since then we have a new deal for those who live on the 5^(th) floor  
to get a daily ration of sour patch kids, we save the watermelons for special  
occasions. 

 

OH RIGHT! I forgot about Norm. So, I taught him about dealing with the Beholder and showed him to his room and the guy was perfectly fine for the first two days. On the third day of his trip, I had just finished my rounds. My last job before getting back to the front desk for the days payments was assisting Mr. and Mrs. Braxley in room 107. Mr. Braxley is a delightful fellow with a real handlebar mustache, always wearing nice suits which match well with his brownish scales and claws. You can always tell he's happy with how his antenna moves in certain ways. As for Mrs. Braxley she is a lovely woman, I'm pretty sure she is English from the way her accent sounds. She wears these beautiful Sundresses, different ones for every day or occasion. Her brown fur and tail always match well with what she wears, and you can barely notice her large front teeth when she smiles. They seem like such a happy couple, I wish I could have a relationship like theirs. Anyways, that morning I was just finishing up their delivery, we don’t really have room service anymore, not since Bill tried to make another run for the door causing the other full time employee to be knocked out with a broken leg (he quit right after that), but I love the Braxley's so much I agreed to take a small tip in exchange for delivering them some basic needs every so often. This time it was their usual delivery of tea and crumpets. Mrs. Braxley opened the door, smiled at me, taking the items with a thank you. I could smell the scent of the ocean from their room, yet it also sounded like flowing water, almost like a river was rushing by. I gave a slight nod as I moved back to the front desk. 

 

On my way there I had to stop and chase off Mr. Olsteen. He's an older gentleman who doesn't actually live here. He kind of looks as if a racoon took human form...and kind of acts like it too. Every time we catch him in the most unusual places or areas he shouldn't be and he's always trying to steal anything that isn't bolted to the floor. Any type of amenities, soaps, toilet paper, etc he will just carry as much as he can and scurry off. I think he knows which security cameras are broken too because he always takes an escape path that prevents us from figuring out where he is hiding the items he takes. The strangest moment was the time I was helping to clean out a room where the ceiling had collapsed due to some water damage, and sure enough Mr. Olsteen was hiding in the fucking ceiling, hissing at us and throwing things to try and make us leave him alone. We have no idea how he keeps getting into the building. My personal belief is that he found a secret entrance that lets him live in the walls, but the owner is certain that he must just be able to walk through solid matter. Sometimes I don't think that theory is that crazy. 

 

This time was more of an easier chase, he hadn't stolen much so it was more like a quick shoo out the door before I was able to make my way back to the front desk. Like clockwork the Norm arrived exactly on time. He handed me his roll of bills and checked out. We haven't seen him since. Here's where we come to my issue. As I was loading his bills in the till I noticed one sticking out and I saw something that I hadn't seen before. I pulled out the bill and saw it was a $60 note. This is fake right? I don't know if I just happened to miss something or if this was just a bad type of forgery. I know I should have been paying more attention before letting him leave, but now I'm worried if all his transactions might have had counterfeit bills. If anyone could message me just to confirm that it is a fake I would greatly appreciate an answer so I can start the process of tracking him down. Thanks for your help!!
