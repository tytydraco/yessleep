There's an abandoned insane asylum on Rowland Street, just outside the city. Local urban explorers go to it all the time, but my friends and I never even knew it existed until a couple of weeks ago. We went to check it out for ourselves early this morning.

"I feel like this place is going to collapse once we step inside," Ryan said, holding his flashlight up as we took in the huge, three-story asylum that loomed over us.

It was six in the morning—the mostly-agreed-upon time for our little adventure—and my friends and I had all just arrived after parking off the side of the dirt road. Sunrise was a little ways off, so it was still dark outside.

If I had to describe the asylum in one word, it would be "ancient". If it ever had a name, it was forgotten by history. Every part of its weathered brick structure was either crumbling, riddled with cracks, or—like the glass in the barred windows—simply gone. There wasn't even a front door; just a black, gaping maw. Time had not been kind to this building.

"Don't threaten me with a good time," Jack said. He was the only one who didn't want to do this at six in the morning.

"You can die later," I said. "Let's go inside and see what we can find." I flicked my flashlight on and off a few times to make sure the battery was good and it was working properly. I wasn't going to make the same mistake as last time.

"One sec," Megan said. She was kneeling over a bag next to her boyfriend, George, getting her camera out and hanging it around her neck. They both love photography, and this was the perfect opportunity for them. "Okay, we're ready."

"Everyone good?" Ryan asked. After making sure we had on our masks, goggles, and gloves, we all said yes—minus Jack, who just kind of stood there, existing. "Alright, let's go."

We "walked" up the "path" to the asylum, which was more of a careful climb over perilous tripping hazards. Good thing we were all wearing boots. Various scattered bricks, beer bottles, and sharp edges later, we reached the entrance.

"Alright," Ryan said, "the people I talked to said that this place is mostly safe, except for the third floor, which has a bunch of holes."

"A bunch of 'holes'?" I asked.

"I don't know," Ryan said, stepping up and shining his flashlight through the large, doorless opening. "Falling apart, I guess? Just like the rest of it seems to be."

I shrugged, and we all walked inside, looking around.

"The reception area," George said, walking around some shattered glass.

He was probably right. It was a large, open room with the crumbling remains of what could have been a reception counter, along with some doors behind it. Glass, bricks, and pieces of metal littered the floor. Graffiti was all over the walls.

"I see at least three dicks on this wall," Jack said, "kind of kills the creepy vibe." He seemed to be more interested in the graffiti than the room itself.

Megan walked over to look, then snapped a photo with her camera. We stared at her for a moment. "What?" she said, lowering her camera. "This could have historical significance."

"Okay," Ryan said, as he examined the doorless exits to the room, "there are two wings to this asylum; the east wing and the west wing." He pointed his flashlight at each one. "Let's start with the west." He led us into the dark.

We walked down the asylum corridors, looking into each room as we went. It was hard to tell the purpose of most of the rooms because almost nothing was left; just various forms of mangled debris. Dust swirled everywhere in the darkness, and I silently thanked my mask.

"I found a bedroom," I said, after inspecting what I initially thought was a broom closet. It was hard to tell, but I could see metal pieces on the floor that were laid out in a vaguely rectangular shape. "I think this was a bed."

"This was definitely a bedroom," George said as the rest of them walked over. "We must have reached the patient bedrooms, then."

"I think you mean 'prisoner cells'," Megan said. She had a disgusted look as she took a photo.

"Yeah, this is more like a Tokyo apartment than a room people would live in voluntarily," Jack said.

I could only agree — these rooms were way too small. I couldn't imagine how awful it would be to live in one of them. Not really a good place to help someone regain their sanity.

Ryan gave the room a cursory glance over my shoulder and went on to the next one. He called back to us, "There are more of them going this way."

There were dozens of bedrooms after that, all exactly the same. Except for one.

"Hey, look at this," Jack shouted from a room nearby.

Looking inside, we saw Jack standing in a room full of ash. It was everywhere, even on the walls. Jack had stirred up a small cloud of it by walking inside, and I made sure my goggles and mask were keeping it out of my eyes and lungs.

"What happened in here?" Megan asked. None of the other bedrooms looked like this, and we hadn't seen ash anywhere else until now.

"Maybe there was a fire?" I said, guessing.

Ryan squinted into the room, which was lit by our flashlights. "It's completely covered in ash, though. How much flammable material could have possibly been in here?"

"Maybe the guy had a lot of blankets," Jack said.

George turned to him. "A lot of blankets?" he asked.

"Some people love blankets. Collect them, too," Jack replied. "Like me."

We all looked at him. Jack stood firm. "What?" he said. "Being gently caressed by blankets at six in the morning is one of life's greatest pleasures."

"You're a child," Megan said, rolling her eyes. "You can hibernate after we're done here." She held up her camera and intentionally blinded Jack by taking a few photos.

After Jack stopped cursing, George stepped into the room and inspected some of the visible debris in the ash. He and Jack started flipping over dislodged bricks and pieces of rusted metal as they began to search the room.

"What are you looking for?" I asked. The rest of us had taken a few steps back to stay out of the ash cloud they were kicking up. "How can you see in that?"

"This is the most interesting room we've seen so far," Jack said, rubbing some ash off a wall. "And I no longer need to see. I've already embraced death."

"There could be something in here that explains the ash," George said, ignoring Jack's whining. He was checking a far corner of the room.

Ash was filling the corridor as Ryan, Megan, and I tried to keep watching them. It was seeping into our hair and clothes. We probably looked like ghosts at this point, and I was going to take multiple showers after this.

"I found something," Jack said suddenly. He pointed to the wall in front of him as he crouched down. George stepped over to look. The rest of us decided to brave the ash and join them.

"You sure?" Ryan asked. I couldn't tell what Jack was trying to point out either.

"Look," Jack said, running his finger over one of the cracked bricks. "There's a hole here."

"Because it's a cracked brick," Megan said, not amused. "Is this the beginning of another one of your quote-on-quote 'jokes'?"

"No, seriously," Jack said. "Watch."

He shined his flashlight into the hole. I couldn't see anything in it.

"I don't see anything," George said.

"Exactly," Jack replied.

Silence.

"Okay, the pause was the joke," Jack said quickly, before we could murder him. "There's a hollow space behind this brick, otherwise we would be seeing something."

We looked closer. "He's right," I said. There was definitely an empty space behind the brick. I stepped away from the wall and turned around. "I'm going to dislodge it so we can see what's back there."

I fought through a few piles of ash before I found a rusty metal rod that was slightly pointed at one end. As I cautiously grabbed it, I tried to remember the last time I had a tetanus shot. The others stepped back to give me space as I approached the brick.

I leveraged the rod against the brick and pushed, and it barely required any force at all; the brick basically crumbled away. I put the rod down carefully and held my flashlight up to see inside.

"What's in there?" Ryan asked. The others were trying to look over my shoulder, but the hole was small.

I looked into the hidden space. "There's a box," I said.

It was a small, heavily rusted metal box. I put my hand in and took it out. Everyone was silent at this unexpected find. There was a latch on top of the box that broke instantly when I tried to open it.

"You broke my box," Jack said, looking hurt.

I ignored him and said, "Let's go into another room and check what's inside. I can't see anything in here." The ash really was awful, especially now that literally everyone was stirring it up.

We stepped out of the room and went a considerable distance down the hall to escape the ash. After jumping up and down a few times to get some of it off, we entered a relatively cleaner room.

"Alright, let's see what's inside," I said as I held up the box for everyone to watch. I was almost blinded by all of their flashlights as I pulled back the lid.

"Papers," Jack said. "Presumably with words on them. My worst fear."

It was a little bundle of loosely rolled up paper. Each page was probably half as large as a sheet of office paper.

"Wait," George said. "Let me take a look, I have the delicate touch for this sort of thing." He took off his gloves, and I held up the box so he could surgically grab the roll of paper.

As he touched the paper, the outermost page disintegrated.

"An incredible display of—" Jack started to say before getting smacked aside by Megan.

"Shut up, it's fine," Megan said, looking at the destroyed paper. "The rest of the pages are probably in better condition."

She was right, and George was able to take the remaining pages into his hand.

He carefully—very carefully—unrolled the pages in front of our eyes.

They were mostly unsalvageable. The outer pages had completely deteriorated, and most of the inner pages were too yellowed and splotchy to read.

However, the innermost paper was in better condition than the rest. It had quite a few spots of legible writing:

---

......................my doctor......................................

............and found a hatch....this room.................

..........and............................sky...........................

N..THE......R........HELL...........IT....WH..SP..RS.....

---

"What the hell?" Ryan asked during his turn to read the page. The rest of us had already read it, and Megan had taken a few photos.

Jack looked at the paper again. He had been uncharacteristically silent after he read it. "It's something no one has laid eyes on for at least a hundred years—until now," he said, looking into the darkness of the open door. "Hooray for us! Now let's call it a day and go home."

George considered this and said, "Yeah, I don't really like this either, maybe we should head back." He eyed the paper again. "Maybe bring that to a museum or something."

Megan looked down and fiddled with her ponytail nervously—using her ash-covered glove—before saying, "...I don't know." Her head came up. "This guy seems to have gone mad, sure, and obviously it's a bit scary reading the bits at the end, but should we really leave without investigating?"

"Investigate what?" Ryan asked, moving away from the paper.

"There's obviously something else in the room," I said. "The page makes it pretty clear that there may be some kind of hatch on the floor. I don't know what we'll find under it, but I think it's worth rechecking the room either way."

"What, look for a hatch that made someone go crazy?" Jack said, trying and failing to maintain a casual tone. "Great idea! Absolutely, let's do that. You guys go on ahead, I'll catch up."

"There's no way to be sure it made him go crazy," Megan said. "And this is an insane asylum, after all. What if the author was already insane?"

George stood up and raised his hands in a gesture of peace. "Let's not argue about this, guys. How about a vote?" he asked. "Show of hands. Do we reinvestigate the room filled with ash? Raise hands for yes."

George lowered his hand.

Jack lowered his hand.

Megan raised her hand.

I raised my hand.

Ryan looked at us. "Of course I'm the tie-breaker," he said. "Classic."

He closed his eyes for a moment, thinking, and said, "This is why we're here, isn't it? To explore forgotten buildings and see the lingering echoes of history for ourselves?" Megan rolled her eyes before Ryan opened his. "Discovering secrets should be a part of that. It is for me, at least."

Ryan raised his hand, and the vote was decided.

George and Jack reluctantly followed us, with Jack mumbling something about the asylum and how well we fit in.

We went back to the Ash Room—cleverly dubbed by Jack—and searched the floor as best we could, with the aforementioned ash making it hard to see anything.

After about five minutes, I found it.

"It's here," I said as I pried up a loose brick with my gloved fingers. A flat surface of rusted metal peeked through the gap.

We took out the surrounding bricks, which were easy after the first was removed, and a metal hatch in the floor was revealed. It was heavily rusted and thinned out to the point where holes showed through in some places.

"Let's get this hatch off," I said, "and see what's down there." I picked up the metal rod I used earlier for the hidden box.

Jack immediately raised his hands and said, "WOAH, woah, woah there, hold it, buddy. We just agreed to *find* it, not to immediately open the door that someone mentioned along with words such as 'DON'T OPEN' and 'HELL'." He took a few steps back, eyeing the rusty metal.

"Jack," I said, kneeling down and pointing my flashlight through a particularly large hole in the metal, "take a look at this for a second. No, really, come closer and take a look." I waved him over.

He reluctantly approached, and we looked through the hole in the metal together. On the other side of the hatch was a stairway carved out of stone that went down, descending only a short distance before opening into what was obviously a hallway.

"Does that look like Hell to you?" I asked, meeting his eyes.

He looked down at the stairs a bit longer before he stood and threw up his hands. "Those are the stairs to Hell. It's a diabolical trick, and the hatch is simply a deception. You've been played." He looked at us and gestured down to the hatch. "There is a demon in that hallway, right out of sight, ready to kill us all. And eat us. Probably both of those things at once, if we're being real."

Megan stood there, tapping her foot in the ash impatiently during his tirade. "So this is who you were talking about then?" she asked, facing Jack.

Jack paused for a second. "What?"

"The demon," Megan said.

"What do you mean?" Jack asked, genuinely confused now.

"The demon," Megan repeated, with a straight face. "The one collecting all of the blankets."

"OKAY, THAT'S—" Jack began to explode.

"STOP!" Ryan shouted, cutting off the imminent chaos. "Christ, guys, can we please just get this open? The sun is already coming up outside." He pointed out to the hall.

We turned to look, and he was right — the sun was definitely coming up. The pitch black was being replaced by deep shadow.

Jack sighed and relented, "Alright, alright, fine. Let's do it." He looked resigned as we went to pull up the hatch.

The metal hatch came off rather easily. We gathered around the opening and gazed down the stone stairs.

"There's a nasty-looking crack near the bottom of the stairs," George said, pointing to it. It was a fairly large crack that caved in the right half of the last three steps.

"We can just stick to the left side, it's fine," I said. "This is less treacherous than the walk up to the asylum itself." There were murmurs of agreement.

Everyone hesitated for a moment as we looked down. After reading that paper, we were still pretty spooked, and subconsciously unwilling on some level to take the first step.

Eventually, I mustered up a bit of courage. "I'll go first," I said, before starting to go down.

"I'll come with," George said. He followed behind me.

Megan wasn't about to let her boyfriend go off without her, so she quickly trailed after George.

"Wait up," Ryan said, shadowing Megan.

Everyone but Jack went down the stairs.

After a moment, Jack let out a frustrated grunt. "I guess the demon will be busy eating the rest of you if I need to run," he said as he grudgingly followed us.

I reached the bottom of the stairs, avoiding the broken steps on my right by keeping to the left, and illuminated the tunnel in front of me with my flashlight.

"What...?" I said.

"What is it?" George asked, wedging himself next to me as I stopped in the cramped tunnel.

"Look," I said.

Down the tunnel, the light revealed something confusing. The tunnel went ahead fifty feet before ending with another set of stairs.

Except these stairs were going *up*.

"This might be a secret exit out of the asylum," George said before noticing something. "Wait, look at the bottom steps."

Everyone was trying to see over our shoulders as I became even more confused.

These stairs had the exact same crack, in the exact same steps, but on the opposite side. Like a mirrored version of the stairs we just went down.

"What?" Jack said from behind, unable to see with everyone in front of him. "What's down there? A demon?"

"There's another set of stairs," Ryan said, barely able to see while crouching down on a higher step. "They go up, and have the same crack in them."

"This doesn't make any sense," Megan said. "And where do those stairs even go?"

Fueled by curiosity, I kept walking until I reached the base of the second set of stairs and shined my flashlight up.

"A door," I said, inspecting it.

Up the same number of steps as the previous stairway was a solid-looking, rectangular black metal door with a bone-white handle. It was seamlessly flush with the terminal end of the stone tunnel.

"Hey, remember that one time I talked about a certain door and said something about opening it?" Jack's voice was clear in the cramped tunnel. "Possibly related to an ominous, frantic note left by an insane dead guy?"

I was getting tired of the persistent, irrational fear that was still plaguing all of us. "It probably just leads outside," I reasoned, firming my resolve as I hugged the right side and started climbing the steps. "You should be happy after throwing so many tantrums about wanting to leave."

"Don't exaggerate," Jack called out as I ascended. "They were dignified and legitimate concerns over my lack of proper rest, because it's most likely compromising my physical health. I'm fragile."

I reached the top of the stairs and pushed open the door before I could change my mind.

It swung open to reveal faint morning sunlight and an area somewhere outside of the asylum. I turned off my flashlight and stepped out the door.

"I told you," I said, "it just leads—" The words died in my throat.

George walked over and stood next to me as he slowly turned his head in every direction.

"Holy shit," Megan breathed as the rest of them came out. She started taking pictures rapidly.

"What is it this time—" Jack stopped cold as he emerged.

Silence, as we looked out over Hell.
