If you're local I'm sure you've noticed the old yellow gas station has been closed for a long while. 

They say it was because of low revenue and vandalism but that's a lie. I was there the last night it was open. I know what happened, I know why the doors are chained shut. 

If you have driven the mountain loop highway then without a doubt you've seen the run down little station on the corner of 20 and 530. And if you stopped by on a weekday between 5:00 and midnight you would have been served by either myself or Iris.

I was 16 at the time, technically I couldn’t work the hours that I was but the owners were pretty relaxed when it came to certain things. Iris was two years older and in my teenage opinion simply beautiful. She stood equal to my five foot eight, had long dark brown hair that she kept in a ponytail while working and the most mesmerizing blue eyes imaginable.

It was the winter season, the pass over the mountain was closed due to snow. This meant we went from being nearly over run by customers to seeing one or two people an hour. The later hours were even slower, sometimes we would go the entire shift only getting a single customer. 

During these times I would wander around bored out of my mind or watch movies that I had downloaded at home. There was no cell service or WiFi so scrolling social media wasn’t an option. Iris preferred to lean back in her chair behind the register and read books. I would try and make conversation occasionally but it would always die quickly. 

The night of the incident was like all the rest, the sun had set depressingly early, we hadn't seen a soul in hours. I pulled my phone out of my pocket out of habit, realizing there still wasn't any service I put it away. “What time is it?” I nearly jumped at the sound of her voice. “What?” I asked in confusion. She took her feet off the register and placed her book on it instead, raising an eyebrow she repeated “what time is it?” “Oh it’s” I had to pull my phone out again “it’s 9:45”. 

She sighed “we still got another two hours until closing”. I just nodded dumbly. An awkward silence  hung in the air for a minute, Iris picked up her book and continued reading. 

Feeling the moment slipping away I blurted out “hey you want to do something?” “Like what?” she asked without looking up from her book. “I don’t know, something to help pass the time”. “As in?” I just shrugged. She sighed and put her book down “listen Clyde, we’re paid to keep an eye on things and help people buy stuff. Not to goof off or socialize”. Her rebuke stung a bit, and it must have shown somewhat because she quickly followed with “tell you what, go take the trash out and I’ll check once again if the bathrooms are clean. Then we can inventory the beer cave together”. 

I hated taking out the trash but if it meant we could do something together afterwards it was worth it. 

Carrying the large black bag over my shoulder I used my free hand to fumble with the bolt on the rear door. The door knob never properly latched so the owners had installed a large gate style locking bolt. It usually required two hands, one to pull the door closer and the other to rotate then slide the bolt back. 

Finally working it free I pushed the heavy metal door open. In front of me stretched a gravel driveway that led to the highway, at the end of the driveway was a worn green dumpster. Iris hated taking the trash out for the same reason I did. At night there was a single light above the door, the rest of the walk was in near blackness. 

One night I had stupidly bragged about how I didn’t mind taking the trash out, how I kind of liked the fresh air. From then on Iris had let me take it out every night. 

Willing myself forward I walked out into the all absorbing darkness.  I felt eyes on me, despite knowing it was just my imagination I couldn’t hold back a shiver. I lifted the dumpster lid and swung the bag inside. The lid slammed shut echoing through the night. 

I almost didn’t notice the rustling bushes just off the path. I froze, the sound grew closer. I nearly screamed as a figure stood from the blackberry bushes, leaves and twigs sticking out of their hair and clothes they took a step closer. 

I let out the breath I was holding, I knew that face. “Jeez Iris you nearly scared me to death. Why are you in the bushes?” she stared at me without blinking. Her eyes were completely void of emotion, she slowly opened her mouth. “to death” she whispered in a voice that was not her own. 

Instinctively I took a step back. She matched it with a step forward. “Iris?” She took another step closer. “I Reese?” she whispered, despite her mouth being open too wide to be whispering anything. Fear coursed through my veins, her enunciation was wrong. But even worse it wasn’t her voice, it was mine! 

My legs were beginning to shake, there was something wrong with her. Not only was it the way she sounded that freaked me out but she looked incorrect. The color of her hair and skin was just a little off, her dimensions weren’t quite right. It hadn’t been enough to notice at first but the more I looked the more off she felt. 

She spoke again drawing closer with each word “Iris, to death, Iris why to death Iris”. The words were flat and emotionless. Each time she spoke she sounded more and more like me. A car happened to drive down the highway, her right eye jerked to the side watching it pass as her left stayed focused on me. I snapped, I turned tail and sprinted for the building. 

Bursting through the back door I slammed it shut behind my self and barred it. I slid to the floor with my back planted firmly against the door. I waited for something to happen but the only sound was my ragged breath. Regaining my composure I started to doubt what I had just seen. 

I don’t know how she did it but Iris had pulled one hell of a prank. I started to get pissed off, she had made a total fool of me. I could just imagine her out there doubled over in laughter. She probably even had a camera set up! 

I stood up ready to throw open the door and give her a piece of my mind when I heard her in the main room. “About time you finished, what were doing out there this whole time?” she asked. Confused I stood up, she couldn’t see me in the back room. How did she know I was back inside? 

She spoke again “are you going to come in or just stand outside?” it was then that I heard my voice come from the room she was in “Iris, stand outside Iris”. “Are you ok Clyde?” she asked with obvious concern. I heard her walk towards the front door. The voice that sounded like me encouraged her “come out side Iris”. The inflection was still wrong but it sounded so much like me. 

Realizing what was happening I ran out of the back room “Iris wait!” I yelled. She jumped in surprise, spinning around she looked at me in confusion then back to the empty front door. “How did you?” she trailed off. “There’s something outside, I don’t know what it is but there’s something out there”. She looked quite annoyed with me. 

“Clyde work isn't the place for pranks, you got me. Now stop goofing off before we get in trouble”. I glared right back “Listen Iris, I’m not doing anything. And unless you were crawling around in the bushes a few minutes ago there’s someone out there messing with both of us”. She didn’t look entirely convinced but apologized anyways. “Sorry, I just assumed since it sounded and looked like you that you were behind it”. “You saw it?” I asked. “Yeah, well you know as best as I could. These windows are so old they distort everything”. 

We agreed to hang out together, so long as we could see each other nobody could pull any more pranks. I was actually starting to enjoy the evening, for the first time Iris and I were having actual conversations. I leaned she was paying her way through community college and was an only child. I told her about myself and my plans for after I graduated. We talked about dream vacations and what plans we had for next summer. 

It wasn't long before we had both forgotten about the nights previous incidents. Iris stood “I gotta use the bathroom, I’ll be right back”. While she was gone I went over to the soft drink fountain and filled up a cup. Iris walked behind the register, picking up her book she began to read. 

“You want something?” I asked holding up my cup. Before she could reply something metallic clattered in the back room. Iris jumped to her feet, we both looked at the door marked EMPLOYEES ONLY with apprehension. “Stay here” she commanded. Before I could protest Iris ran through the door into the dark room. 

A panicked cry came from the dark “Clyde!” just as I was about to rush through the doorway a toilet flushed. I froze, behind me the bathroom door opened and Iris walked out. I felt sick, in the darkness of the back room I could make out a figure standing just a few feet away.  

Iris noticed something was up “what’s wrong Clyde?” I didn’t take my eyes off the figure in front of me “there’s someone in the back room”. She ran up to me “what?” she demanded “who?” looking through the doorway she gasped “you better leave! We’re calling the cops!” she yelled. The figure stepped farther into the dark disappearing from sight. 

“To death Iris” came my voice followed by Iris’ voice “come here Clyde”. There was a pounding of footsteps as the figure charged us! I slammed the door shut just in time, an inhuman scream rang out as the creature slammed into the door. Iris and I held it closed as the door was assaulted over and over again. 

We didn’t relax until we heard the back door slam shut. “What the hell was that?” Iris asked. I didn't know what to say, this was too much. Iris jumped to her feet “I’m calling the police, I don't care who or what is out there it just tried to attack us”. I nodded “yeah that's a good idea”. Iris went to the pay phone behind the counter. 

She punched in 911 then held the phone to her ear. She hung up and tried again. “Damn it” she muttered, trying a third time without luck she slammed the phone back into the receiver. 
Clenching her fists Iris groaned in frustration “the phones dead Clyde”. I felt a knot form in my stomach, this wasn’t uncommon. The phone was just as often broken as it was working but it was really bad timing. 

“Now what?” I asked stupidly. Iris threw her hands up “how should I know Clyde? This isn't exactly in the employee handbook”. She slumped down in defeat. “Hey iris?” “yes Clyde?” “We don't have an employee handbook”. A small smirk played across her lips “I know we don't smart ass”. 

With the mood successfully lifted we went back to our original plan, we would stick together until sunrise. Then we would drive to town and report what happened. 

That was until a tattered soft top Fox Body Mustang pulled up to the pump. “Oh shit” muttered Iris. We both cautiously peeked out the window. “Do you think they’re part of the prank?” I asked. Iris bit her lip nervously “I don’t now, I’m not even sure it is a prank”. 

An old man slowly climbed out of the car, he was balding and wore thin rimmed glasses. He reminded me of a short portly teacher I had in middle school. 

The man fumbled with his wallet completely unaware of us. After swiping his card the man stiffened, he looked over his shoulder at something we couldn’t see. 

Iris’ doppelganger came striding into the light. Behind me the real Iris let out a soft gasp. I was frozen in place, I stood there as that thing approached the man.

Suddenly the doppelganger jumped impossibly high and landed on the man’s shoulders, he collapsed to the ground under it’s weight. Iris rushed from behind me to the automatic doors.

Her movement snapped me out of my daze and I chased after her. With the opening of the doors we could hear the man yelling out in pain. The doppelganger had long black finger nails that it was using to try and gouge out the man’s eyes. 

Before we had even made it out the door the second doppelganger rushed from the dark. It still looked like me but more battered and dirty. It held a large rock above it’s head as it ran towards the man. 

Raising the rock higher it brought it down on the man’s skull. Iris turned and blocked my view but I still heard the crunch. It sounded like a watermelon landing on a sidewalk from a great height. Iris shoved me back inside, once the doors closed she locked them. 

I chanced a peek outside, the car stood abandoned in the yellow light. All that remained of its owner was a thick red puddle leading into the dark surrounding bushes. 

Iris looked at me with tear filled eyes “Clyde I don’t know if we’re getting out of here”. I didn’t know what to say. We just watched someone die, my thoughts were a mess. I hugged her, we stood there holding each other scared to death. 

Iris angrily wiped her tears “come on Clyde we need to lock this place down.” We pulled down the security gate and locked it in place hopefully sealing off the front door. 

Not that it would do much good if something really wanted to get in, the windows on either side of the door were plenty big enough for someone to crawl through. The back door was locked but for good measure we pushed the baked goods display in front of it. 

We both froze at the sounds of footsteps above us, Iris covered her mouth to hold in a gasp. “They’re on the roof!” she whisper shouted. We both looked to access hatch that led to the roof. It was locked but how sturdy was it? 

My heart lurched and a scream slipped out of me, at the front window was my face. Blackened and grinning with its eyes open far too wide! No it wasn’t black, from the nose down the face was stained with blood. It had been feasting. 

Iris jumped when I screamed, seeing the face she turned me and pulled me into a hug. Wrapping her arms around my head she pulled it against her chest blocking out my view of the thing outside. “Just don’t look at it” she whispered. “don’t acknowledge its existence”. 

That didn’t last, the creature wearing my image started tapping the glass. At first lightly, but with each tap the force increased. Soon the old glass pane was flexing under the force. I looked up at Iris, I saw in her eyes that she knew as well as I that the glass wouldn’t hold. 

The second creature dropped from above to join the first. Cracks began to appear. I was frozen in place, but Iris sprang into action. She managed to move the display blocking the rear exit all by herself. 

The window shattered! The creatures stood there seemingly surprised by the sudden destruction. Iris came from the supply closet, in her hand was the broom we used to sweep the floors at the end of the shift. She snapped the head off leaving a sharp point. 

Iris had a look to her, it was as if time its self slowed in respect. She took my numb hand and put her car keys in it, she shoved me towards the back door. I stumbled into the back room, I looked over my shoulder to see her charging across the store, improvised spear held out in front of her. The creatures were coming through the window, their faces twisted with hatred. And hunger in their eyes. 

I made it out the back door. I made it to her car. 

I made it home that night. 

As soon as I had service I called 911, I balled my eyes out as I tried to tell the operator what happened. They heard enough, someone had died at the gas station and someone else was in danger. 

The next morning the police came to my door, they cuffed me and drug me out of the house. I spent hours getting brutally interrogated. 

Finally I was able to go, from what I picked up the officers arrived to the scene. The body of the mustang owner was mostly consumed and laying next to the store. Inside there was bloodied hand and foot prints everywhere. 

Iris was no where to be found. If it wasn’t for the fact that there was no DNA evidence pointing towards me I would probably have taken the blame. 

We moved within a week, despite the charges being dropped within a 48 hours the court of public opinion had determined I was guilty of murder. And probably worse when it came to Iris. 

It's been seven years now since they closed that station. I drove past it yesterday, I had to take that route for my job. The windows are boarded up and the blackberries have taken over half the building. But it didn’t feel empty as I drove past. 

Thank you Iris, you were braver than I could ever hope to be. I hope you can see what I did with my life and are proud. I miss you. 

I’ll be taking the long way home, the extra four hours of driving is worth not having to go past that station again.
