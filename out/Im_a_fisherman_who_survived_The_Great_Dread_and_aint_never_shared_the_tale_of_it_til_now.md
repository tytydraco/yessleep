T'was an awful storm that night.

The wrath of the heavens pummeling down and clashing' with the hells, sparks of light littering the skies, the veins of gods as they flexed the elements.

I were used to the waters but not the way it was then, the violence of it felt biblical and stronger than what mortal men could endure, and though I should not have been, to my surprise I were demanded to abandon my post and head inside with the crew and wait out the storm.

I remember the words sitting strangely with me, for all 48 hours prior there were strict shifts of working and not a lot of breaks between, but I suppose the risk were high then. I'd not had much of a chance to talk to my fellow seamen much, the weather was often moody and left no room for speaking atop the winds and water hissing at us.

I'd sat myself in the dining area under the heat lamps and once I was warmed I surrendered to the cabins for shut eye, I never was one for conversing or talking much with others.

My mind was rocking back and forth as the vessel danced with the ocean and pictures of memories began to drench and soak me mind before I was awoken by a sound.

A sound unlike anything I'd heard, similar to a foghorn but more... alive somehow, organic or such, more natural, and it ripped through the floorboards as they shook and wept - I sat up immediately and others followed, without a word 'tween us we investigated the source, although it had only happened once its volume and presence was unmistakable, unforgettable, and it came from the docks outside.

The weather was raging still but calmer than it was, enough to be able to see in-front of ye for the most part, as we approached the direction it came from that's when we saw him.

A lad stood by the railing, gripping it so tight the crimson was pooled beneath him, diluted by the rains but rich in its color still, his rain-coats hood was on and he was as stiff as a corpse.

My first thought was that the lightnings got him, was out here doin' god knows what and held the rail when he was struck. A terrible way to go, I thought - but it weren't no lightning that had him.

As I approached the lad I began to see the details and it were unholy what met my eyes, his skin looked to be bubbling like boiled water, purple boils and growths seemed to be growing and... I'm unsure how to say it, but.... it was like they were growing and undoing themselves in a pattern, like the way tides drift to and from the shores, like someone was squeezing and letting go - over and over it was. Like the breath of a devil. His mouth was hung open, with the darkest shade of red I'd ever seen, thick and tar like, gurgling out his mouth and sizzling into bouts of steam against the cold air. Like acid spitting from his mouth. Then he spoke, his words jumbled and muffled, as if someone gargling water were trying to speak,

"Return me, I. Return, me. I. Return, me" is all I could hear.

Rambles of lunacy it was, and before I could stop him he tore his hands off the railing, the skin from his palms stuck to it like settled cheese, he shrieked and flailed, his blood and skin flying and flapping as the winds screamed and laughed, I'd never seen anything like it- he threw himself overboard 'fore we could even blink.

It was the briefing that night only 2 hours after where I was made aware of it,

**'The Great Dread'**

Sent good men to madness, it did, rotting their brain until their bodies followed. I'd never seen nothing as ghastly or depraved in all me life. Suddenly the dangers of the job were all but obvious, and I was a fool for thinkin' otherwise.

It were a rare occurrence where the anomalies we came to find were not in the fishes we caught or the flora that grew beneath, but of the mind.

He was only the first to go, but he certainly weren't the last, the dread never left the area.

That night weren't nearly as easy to shut eye and return to me dreams, t'were a cabin full of nervous sailors staring at the ceiling in silence, it were one thing for the fish to be disfigured, were one thing for the weather to scold us, but to have one of the young men who you're training with, who shared feasts with you, to die in such a way was something none of us were ready for.

The following moons were uneventful, we isolated in the ship in fears of the source of it comin' from the waters or the air around us, the part that really scared us were that the management had no idea as to what the great dread was, or where it came from. They just knew the effect it had, and that if the dread reared its head, then the job was all but over. The risk outweighed the research. Makes ye wonder why there weren't no mention of it at all from our superiors.

The storm came and went, came and went, came and went, as soon as we'd begin to strategize the trip back to land it would come back, like Neptune himself mocking us, toying with us the way predators play with their food.

We were stuck in the dread for days, isolating ourselves in the ship, not a lot of work for most of us to do, leaving many working men without distraction, the thoughts and devils inside us began festering and feeding on us with no time to waste and the madness began to boil.

Many men died by suicide, one stabbed another in the neck during dinner, and another simply locked themselves away downstairs in the supply room, the screams and screeching that could be heard from him were enough to send any man to insanity in the best of circumstances, but it were what we saw when we found him that had us abandon the mission all together, regardless of the risk of capsizing from the storm.

His body had become what looked a boil, similar to what the first lad had on his hands but larger, bigger, all over his body. Like a bloated corpse that had been rotting in water for days. His face was so swollen and inflamed that you'd barely recognize him as a young man, or even a human being, you could barely tell where his forehead was meant to be or his chin, all of it had compressed in on its self and blew back out. It was the stuff of nightmares. I threw up so much that the bile ran dry.

We barely made it back to land, hell, most of us didn't, it were me and 3 other sailors, down from 18,  all who looked as if the light of life had been snatched from their souls in the night.

When we left the vessel and returned to our homes, me superior, he who I shall not name, had us sign additional wavers for secrecy, a secrecy that I'd held to until today.

I write today not to rebel or to cause harm, but because The Great Dread has followed me home.

It's been years since then, but a week ago it started.

My wife Helena was expecting you see, had been all year, it took a long time for the intimacy 'tween us to grow back and this child felt like life was finally harmonizing again.

I was distant and broken for the whole year I'd come back, nothin' could erase what I'd seen, what I'd felt, and I weren't able to talk about it much at all, despite nobody in my tiny island commune a risk to share the details with, and I'm sure ye can imagine, a piece of paper didn't hold much over folk like me, but our word of honor did, but, really, the truth is.... it felt as if telling the tales of it would cause it to come back.

I'd die before I did anything to bring the Dread home, but, turns out, that weren't no choice of mine.

Helena began to become distant much like I had been, I thought not much of it, women's hormones were as turbulent as the most wild waters when they were pregnant - it was when the others began behaving in the same way that the panic started to sprout.

Started with me brother, took his own life for no reasons we could see, and only I truly upset. Everybody were dead in the eyes.

Then me mother, me father, all the same ways, digging into their own necks and throats with fishing hooks, Thomas down the ways butchered 'is family then himself, and over time everybody were maiming and killing each other at night time in their cabins.

I'd barely realized how few were left 'til they were all gone for good, some already starting to stink and rot.

By then, Helena's mind was loosened like a rusted screw in an ancient cabin, she'd snuck off in me slumber and gashed her throat with me hook, leaving only a note for me to remember her by, It read:

"Return Me To Whence I Was, For I Have Come To Thee"

I fear that I'm not long for this world, whatever it is that vessel toyed with, I don't think it were meant to be seen.
