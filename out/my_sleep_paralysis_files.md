I experience “fear induced” lucid dreams

I know this is implied by posting here but even still, with respect for yalls time and mine, this is reality for me and has happened enough times I have gotten a feel for it in terms of how it is fear induced.

Sleep paralysis episodes started for me as young as an early teen. What was a typical episode like for me? I will get a heaviness and begin to dissociate from my sensations. I know I’m awake and at this point I am sort of transitioning into the paralysis. I will be tying fear into this experience as best as I can as a pretty terrible writer so bare with me but be mindful that for me fear or fear adjacent headspace is almost exclusively the precursor required for me to fully induce into the paralysis. 

What that means for me is that if I focus on fear and sort of try and psyche myself out and feed into it then I have a far greater likelihood of achieving full paralysis that then transitions back into my body for a proper lucid dream experience (moving around and experiencing “my room” and walking around and interacting with stuff until i inevitably wakeup - back into my bed) my lucid dreams are rarely longer than a couple minutes. plenty of time for me to absolutely adore that this happens to me because its fucking bonkers and interesting to me. what is sleep paralysis like for me though? Dread. Crippling. Crushing. There are two entities I have some relations with. one is a red eyed shadow fuck thats always in the opposing corner or in an open closet door and the other is a straight up witch. think wizard of oz. She is very annoying and has caused me some grief as well. If you don’t think I’m insane already well then here is the kicker. I have found through many experiences how to bridge the gap between SP & LD is to focus and try and to amplify the fear. Truly. I have found that if I go ‘meh’ mister red eyed bitch boy i’ve seen you before and shrug it off (even though I’m fully immobilized physically I am still fully conscious)  more often than not I can shake myself out of SP. I’ll simply wakeup. Sometimes this process repeats and with repeated experience I strived for lucid dreaming. 

Fear is that driver for me it seems. If I allow myself to feel it then what happens next is I have the sensation that I log roll through my bed like some kind of trans material washing machine effect and then I ultimately end up laying in bed in a lucid dream. Whenever I have an episode I get so excited that I will try to think of cheesy horror stuff like freddy kruger or something to illicit that feeling of dread as to sort of accelerate the experience into a lucid dream. i have tried to simulate other emotions like joy for instance but in that state it is as if joy isn’t even in my wheelhouse lol. I hope I made any sense to anyone and if anyone else experiences this please let me know!
