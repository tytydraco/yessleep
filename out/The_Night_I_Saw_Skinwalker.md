Edit: The names were changed for privacy. The story is the same as best as I could remember it.

It was late October, a night when the wind howled through the trees like a restless spirit, and the moon hung low, casting long, eerie shadows over the desolate landscape. I was visiting my grandparents’ ranch in New Mexico, nestled deep in the desert, miles from the nearest town. The ranch had always been a place of comfort for me—a place where I could escape the noise of the city and bask in the quiet solitude of the open land. But that night, something felt different, like the land itself was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.

“Hey, you ever hear those stories about skinwalkers?” my cousin Ethan asked, his voice breaking the silence as we sat by the fire pit outside. The flames flickered, casting a warm glow on our faces, but it did little to dispel the growing unease in my gut.

“Skinwalkers?” I repeated, glancing over at him. His expression was serious, almost too serious for a kid who usually joked about everything.

“Yeah,” he said, lowering his voice as if the very mention of the word could summon something from the shadows. “They’re these evil witches or spirits, I’m not really sure. They can shape-shift into animals—wolves, coyotes, whatever. But they’re not just animals, you know? They’re something else, something…wrong.”

I chuckled nervously, trying to shake off the creepy feeling creeping up my spine. “Come on, Ethan. That’s just some Navajo legend, right? Something to scare kids?”

Ethan didn’t laugh. Instead, he leaned closer to the fire, his eyes narrowing as he stared into the flames. “I wouldn’t be so sure. My dad said he saw one once, out near the old cattle pens. Said it was a coyote, but when he looked into its eyes, he knew it wasn’t just an animal. It was like it was looking into him, reading his thoughts or something.”

A shiver ran down my spine despite the warmth of the fire. “What happened?”

“He backed away slowly, got the hell out of there. But he swears it followed him home that night. Heard scratching at the windows, like it was trying to get inside.” Ethan paused, his voice dropping to a whisper. “Said he heard it whispering his name.”

“Okay, enough.” I forced a laugh, though my voice wavered. “You’re just trying to freak me out.”

Ethan shrugged, a grim smile on his face. “Believe what you want. Just don’t go wandering off alone tonight.”

We sat in silence for a while, the wind howling louder as the night grew darker. I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were being watched, that something was out there, just beyond the reach of the firelight.

“I’m heading in,” I said finally, standing up and brushing the dirt off my jeans. “It’s getting cold.”

Ethan nodded, his eyes scanning the darkness beyond the fire. “Yeah, good idea. I’ll be right behind you.”

As I turned to head back to the house, I heard it—a low, guttural growl, so deep it seemed to vibrate through the ground beneath my feet. I froze, my heart pounding in my chest.

“Did you hear that?” I whispered, my voice barely audible.

Ethan was already on his feet, his eyes wide with fear. “Don’t move,” he hissed. “Whatever you do, don’t run.”

The growl came again, closer this time. Slowly, I turned my head, my breath catching in my throat as I saw it—a pair of glowing eyes in the darkness, fixed on us with an intensity that sent a wave of pure terror through my body. The creature was massive, hunched over on all fours like a wolf, but there was something horribly wrong with it. Its limbs were too long, too distorted, and its fur was matted and filthy, almost like it was rotting away. And those eyes—they weren’t the eyes of an animal. They were filled with malice, with a sick, twisted intelligence that made my blood run cold.

“Get to the house, now,” Ethan whispered, his voice shaking.

We backed away slowly, never taking our eyes off the creature. It didn’t move, just watched us, its growl rumbling through the night air like a warning. My heart raced as we reached the edge of the firelight, the safety of the house still too far away. And then, with a sudden, terrifying speed, the creature lunged forward.

“Run!” Ethan shouted, grabbing my arm and yanking me toward the house.

We sprinted across the yard, the sound of the creature’s heavy breathing right behind us. I could hear its claws scraping against the ground, its growl turning into a savage snarl as it closed the distance between us. My legs burned, my lungs screamed for air, but I didn’t dare slow down.

The porch light was in sight, the old wooden steps just a few feet away. Ethan reached them first, throwing himself up the stairs and bursting through the door. I was right behind him, my hand outstretched, but just as I reached the steps, something sharp sliced across my ankle, sending me crashing to the ground.

“Get up!” Ethan screamed from the doorway, but the pain was too intense. I looked back, and my heart stopped. The creature was right there, towering over me, its breath hot and rancid on my face.

“Please…” I whispered, barely able to speak. The creature tilted its head, almost as if it were curious, its glowing eyes narrowing. And then, to my horror, it began to change.

Its fur receded, its limbs twisted and cracked, contorting into a grotesque parody of a human form. Within moments, it was standing upright, a tall, gaunt figure with skin so pale it seemed to glow in the dark. Its face was a nightmare—a twisted, elongated snout with sharp, jagged teeth, and those eyes, those terrible, glowing eyes that now looked disturbingly human.

It leaned down, its face inches from mine, and I heard it speak in a low, rasping voice that made my skin crawl.

“You shouldn’t have come here,” it whispered, its breath like ice against my skin.

With a surge of adrenaline, I kicked out with my good leg, catching it off guard. It stumbled back, and I scrambled to my feet, half-crawling, half-running up the steps. Ethan grabbed me, pulling me inside just as the creature lunged again, its claws raking across the door as we slammed it shut.

We collapsed on the floor, gasping for breath, our hearts pounding in our chests. The creature howled in rage, the sound echoing through the house, rattling the windows. We could hear it circling outside, its heavy footsteps crunching on the gravel as it stalked around the house, looking for a way in.

“We need to call someone,” I gasped, my voice trembling. “The police, anyone.”

“Who’s gonna believe us?” Ethan said, his voice just as shaky. “They’ll think we’re crazy.”

We huddled together in the middle of the room, every creak of the floorboards, every rustle of the wind outside sending a fresh wave of fear through us. The creature’s howls grew fainter, then stopped altogether. But we knew it was still out there, waiting, watching.

“We can’t stay here,” I whispered, my voice barely audible. “It’ll get in eventually.”

Ethan nodded, but neither of us moved. We were too terrified, too paralyzed by the thought of what was waiting for us outside.

Hours passed, though it felt like days, and the night dragged on in suffocating silence. Finally, as the first light of dawn began to creep through the windows, we heard it—the soft padding of footsteps moving away from the house, disappearing into the distance. 

We waited until the sun was fully up, until the warmth of daylight filled the room, before we dared to move. Slowly, cautiously, we opened the door and stepped outside. The yard was empty, the only sign of what had happened the deep gouges in the ground where the creature had stood.

But I knew it wasn’t over. The memory of those glowing eyes, that voice whispering in the dark, would haunt me forever. We never spoke of that night again, not to each other, not to anyone. But from that day on, I never went near the ranch at night, and I always kept a wary eye on the shadows, knowing that somewhere out there, the skinwalker was waiting.

And it knew my name.
