Abel Mackenzie was abducted on April 23rd 2023. Her corpse was never found. She was fifteen at the time, as was I. She was my closest friend since before I even knew how to talk. Our mothers had been friends since their school days, ages past. She lived only a few doors down from my house, and was the only person who I can say truly accepted me. I had long dark hair, wore all black clothes and wasn't into sports, which living in Ireland meant I stood out like a sore thumb. I was a prime target for being picked on. But Abel wasn't like the other kids. While she wasn't my only friend, she was the closest. The trauma of losing her, seeing the missing posters plastered everywhere, landed me in therapy until about 6 months ago where I got addicted to prescription painkillers. My other friends, Aidan and Ethan, were quite judgemental people. We were all social rejects but Ethan in particular had a tendency to act as though he wasn't. That he was somehow better than me. I didn't tell them much. They didn't know a lot about me and Abel. They teased me about my appearance almost as much as my peers. 


We used to go to after school study classes together, hang out in the many fields and forests of Ireland during the weekend, and explore the little abandoned buildings that were in the small town of Arianne and the surrounding area. Some small houses, storage sheds, and a grocery store. There was one place we were never able to go in that I always longed to explore. An old wax museum. It was super out of the way, being behind a factory in an alley. It's walled off with towering iron fences, topped with rusty barbed wire. The courtyard in front littered with old British soldiers and horses, a junkyard of history. I had an interest in old Irish history, the Easter rising, the troubles, things like that, which I couldn't tell my friends about for obvious reasons. It closed down long before I was old enough to leave my housing estate without being under the watchful eye of my mother. We had walked by it hundreds if not thousands of times while walking a lap around our small town. We really had nothing much else to do other than walk. We'd talk about ways we could get inside it, and what could be in there.


“The fence doesn't seem that hard to climb”


Said the 5'4, skinny kid known as Ethan, who as usual had his head so far up his ass he forgot to look at the barbed wire atop the fence. I replied:


“Yeah if you were standing on my shoulders”


I was the tallest out of us three, although not by much. I was 6’0 and Aidan was around 5’10. My mom said I was tall, but in school everyone was my height, so I didn't feel tall. Ethan however, was the total opposite. He felt much taller than he was, and had no shame acting like it. 


“Yeah alright Tobin, whatever you say.  C'mon guys, the wire’s all rusty. It can't be that hard to just like… tear it off.”


I do not know what having tetanus feels like, nor did I want to find out.


“Alright then, ladies first.”


I said, gesturing him forward toward the gate. He gave me a light shove as we kept moving forward. Ethan was, for lack of a better word, an asshole. But he wasn't totally heartless. He found my phone unlocked once and went through it. He found poems I had written about Abel. Poems she never had a chance to see. He used to tease me relentlessly about them, however after she disappeared he layed off. He could see how much it affected me even though he didn't know how close me and her were. To tell you the truth, I was in love with her. And she was in love with me. The police found unsent love letters in her phone addressed to me. If only I had the courage to tell her, maybe, just maybe, she'd still be here. Or if not, maybe whoever it was that took her, might have taken me instead. I would give the world to trade places with her. I believed that statement for two years. Two years to the day Abel went missing, was the day I learned there are things far worse than death. 


April 20th 2025, three days before it all happened, me and aidan were sitting in a clearing in a forest we were exploring. He could tell there was something bothering me. It had been almost two years since Abel disappeared but I still got emotional about it. I could never fully get over it. 


“You alright? Ethans not here, you can talk to me y'know”


Aidan was always supportive of me. Any time I needed something off my chest I could count on him. Despite this I never told him about Abel. He knew we were friends of course but that was it. 


“Yeah it's just… Aidan, can I tell you something personal?”


“Depends”


He replied with a grin. He's the type of guy who was always cracking jokes, even at the worst of times.


“You know about me and Abel right?”


His smile faded. He knew I cared about Abel. This was the one time he wouldn't joke around. I told him about the letters she had left for me. He sat there in silence listening to me. I cried. I always cried. At therapy, in school, at home, anywhere. Whenever I had to speak my mind I cried. My mom always told me it was because I'm just a “sensitive person” and that I got it from her. My mom cried a lot too. Even when she wasn't the one speaking her mind. That made me keep a lot of my feelings to myself, as I hated seeing her upset. Aidan tried his best to comfort me, though he wasn't the best at it. I was just glad I had someone to talk to. 


April 21st 2025, two days. We went to an abandoned farmhouse we had been to many times before. It was down a long windy path that stretched into the countryside. It was a pretty common spot for people to hang out in. People used it to smoke, skip school, makeout, etcetera. Ethan, Aidan and I would use it to scavenge for stuff people left there. Bags, jackets, keys. People drop all sorts of things at parties, and since nobody was ever around to clean the place we picked it clean, like vultures. We found a couple dollars, someone's school locker key, and the occasional condom. Ew. 


Despite the place being used as a party venue quite frequently, nobody was ever smart enough to bring a ladder. The ladder that separated the bottom floor of the barn and the loft was broken. Me, Ethan and Aidan hid one in the main house. We’d go up to the loft and sit there to talk for hours. Sometimes when my parents would argue I'd run off to the barn, climb in the loft and enjoy the peace and quiet. It was essentially my second home. For this reason I kept some things of sentimental value hidden up there, things like a photo of me and Abel. 


April 22nd 2025, the day before. It was today when we noticed the gate in front of the wax museum’s lock had fallen off and was now sitting on the ground, rusted and broken.


“That's.. Weird..” 


I said.


“How did that happen? We've had good weather all week.”


“And? Who cares? We can finally go inside right?”


Ethan responded before taking a step forward. I grabbed his shoulder.


“I'm just saying maybe someone bought it out. I think we give it a little while. If the gates are still unlocked by tomorrow, we’ll head inside okay?”


Ethan shrugged and muttered something under his breath and aidan smiled at me. I couldn't tell if he was impressed I was taking precautions or if he just liked it when I annoyed Ethan. 


April 23rd. I woke up to a sick feeling in my stomach. I was nervous to go to the museum, and deep down I hoped the gate would be locked again. I can't explain why, it confuses me still today, even after i wanted to go there for so long. Part of me thinks I knew what I would find there. 3:30 pm, Me, Ethan and Aidan met up in front of the Museum to find the lock still broken, untouched from yesterday. Aidan stepped forward and swung the gate open. There was a loud droning screech from the gate, rust cascaded off the hinges like brown snowflakes. We were disturbing stagnant water. 


As we stepped into the courtyard it began to rain, filling the many potholes that littered the driveway. We rushed past the wax horses and soldiers piled up, their faces were more haunting the closer I was. Distorted and damaged by the elements for years. I began to wonder how they had lasted so long, then I thought, were they always here? And if so, were they the same statues that sat here over the years? Someone must've been replacing them. The thought left my mind as we went inside. 


The lack of sun, and abundant heavy rain made it both hard to see and hear inside the museum. The water splashing off the metal roof using the building itself as a resonating chamber. We had to use our phone flashlights to see anything. It was like a maze in there, even though I could tell it was only one big room. Piles of wax sculptures acted as walls, creating a labyrinth. The place smelled vile. It was like stepping into a sewage pipe. I stepped on something sticky. Chewed gum. And now that I looked at the stone floor, it was littered with strange things. Nail clippings, tissues, pieces of clothes and hair. It didn't take long for us to be split up, Aidan shouted for us from across the room. Only I answered. I figured Ethan was playing some prank on us by not answering. Eventually we found our way back to each other when we met in a large clearing near the center of the room. We walked forward into the darkness together. The large room obscured by the dark made it look like a large hallway. As we walked we came across shattered glass jars, then intact jars, then jars containing some sort of bubbly clear liquid. The glass was nearly green from all the dirt and grime. Aidan bent down and picked one up. As he held it up to see what was inside he jolted back and dropped it. The resonating crash from the shattering glass made my ears ring. I glanced down at the liquid covered floor to find an entire intact human nail had been floating in the jar. I heard shuffling from behind us, the wet noise of someone's bare foot slapping the concrete. I looked at Aidan, in his panic he hadn't heard the noise. I turned to look, but there was nothing there. Nothing I could see anyway. When I looked back at Aidan to warn him he had already begun walking off, trudging forward into the darkness. 


I was too scared to shout for him, so I jogged behind him in an attempt to catch up. By the time I reached him he was holding another jar, completely frozen in his tracks. An entire human finger was floating inside the liquid. Perfectly preserved, with an almost surgical cut where it had been severed. I held back my puke as I began to tell him what I heard, when from in front of us, we heard a low jingling noise, like someone was rattling very heavy keys. I stepped forward with the flashlight to find a giant concrete wall, with chains sprouting from it. And attached to the chains, confined to this wax walled hell, was Abel Mackenzie.


She was fully naked with scars and bruises lining her body, dried, rotten blood ran from her nose to her chest, her hair was thin and falling out, yet there was no sign of it falling at her feet. She was surrounded with jars containing feet, hands, hair and other various small body parts, all preserved to near perfection. Her eyes were dead, glazed over. She stared at me with the sort of look a toddler gives you, as if she was looking right through me. I ran at the chains pulling and hitting them, desperate to free her. Aidan was still frozen in shock, but he wasn't staring at Abel. He flashed his torch across the wall to reveal about a dozen carcases chained to the wall. Some were just bones, while others were rotting piles of green flesh. I could make out a deer, a dog, and what looked like another person chained against the wall, with piles of jars and bones at their feet. 


Aidan began throwing up violently behind me, the sound of it splashing against the hard concrete floor was somehow the thing that sickened me the most. I was numb. Shocked. I desperately wanted to believe it was all a nightmare, that I would wake up any second. ANd in my panic, I noticed something shift off to the left. I darted my eyes toward it. Whatever it was, it had noticed me long before I noticed it. I pointed the flashlight at whatever it was as my phone gave a low battery warning and shut off the light. From the brief flash i saw, i could make out a small, vaguely human resembling creature. Its pale green skin stretched painfully over its body and plump stomach. It had no lips, always showings its nasty yellow teeth. Its thin, few strands of hair was a familiar shade of black, and was stuck on its head by what looked to be a mixture of chewed gum and expired glue. Pale white milky eyes glared into my soul. It seemed to be crouched down, caressing and cradling a jar. I could not see what was inside the jar, but whatever it was, it was larger than anything else i've seen contained inside them. 


I pulled aidan and took off running. I felt horrible leaving Abel behind but my fight or flight response kicked in. We ran through the maze, the loud slapping of its hands and feet following right behind us as we ran. I could hear its hard, laboured breathing right behind me. Eventually we made it to the door. I turned around just in time to slam it in the creature's face. I heard a long, ear splitting screech from the other side. We both turned and ran home.


I cried. I cried a lot when I got home. I knew where Abel was, after all these years, I had found her. I called the police, but when they got there, they said the place was empty. No wax statues, no jars, just a bad smell that must've been burned into the walls from all this time.


A few months passed after the investigation was called off and the gate was locked again, when a large cardboard box appeared on my front doorstep that had no return address. 


Inside was a jar with a single tooth.
