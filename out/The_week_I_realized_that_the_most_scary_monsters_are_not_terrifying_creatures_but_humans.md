Hi, my name is David. I'm 31 years old now and I want to tell you about a traumatic experience I went through when I was just a naive 10-year-old kid.  
  
It all began on a scorching summer day in the year 2002. I wasn't a particularly good child, nor was I a bad boy. Most people would have described me as the odd kid from the neighborhood, so I didn't have many friends—actually, I didn't have a single one. In the week the incident happened, both my parents were out of the house on a business trip (they worked together), but they didn't leave me unsupervised. Ironically, that very supervision became the problem that led to my trauma, because the person entrusted with my safety was not the kindly woman everyone knew.  
  
The woman I'm referring to was one of our old neighbors. She was 36, and at a glance, she appeared nice and friendly. However, the nightmare began after my parents left. She and I were at the dining table, eating the pancakes she had made (a terrible mistake). Suddenly, I collapsed. It was only later that I realized she had drugged me.  
  
The first thing I saw upon waking up was darkness. I couldn't move; I quickly realized I was tied to a chair. After an hour or two, a light illuminated the corner of my vision, revealing my surroundings for the first time—I was in a basement. The creaking of footsteps echoed, indicating my captor's approach.  
  
The steps grew nearer and nearer. You can imagine the terror of not knowing whether I would live or die. And then, I saw her—the woman who was entrusted with my safety.  
  
Her first words to me were filled with horrifying anticipation. She mentioned she had been waiting a long time for this moment, in the most chilling way possible. Naturally, I began to cry and scream for help, but nobody heard me. It wasn't until later that I learned I was held in a house located in the middle of nowhere. She slapped me and ordered me to be quiet. She claimed I now belonged to her alone and then commenced toying with me. After indulging herself, she produced a pair of secateurs and severed my left pinky finger. The pain was agonizing, and as I started to lose consciousness, I witnessed her consuming it.  
  
I awoke in excruciating pain, my gaze drawn to the stump where my pinky had been. It was burned—probably to prevent me from bleeding to death. After a while, she returned, and the gruesome process repeated. She assaulted me and took my ring finger, devouring it as well, causing me to collapse once more. The cycle continued, with her slicing off my toes until my left foot had none remaining. She began torturing me in other ways—waterboarding, cutting my skin, allowing lemon juice to seep into the wounds. She even progressed from burning stumps to targeting random body parts.  
  
After several days of torture, the police finally located me. The officer who discovered me encountered a 10-year-old boy, mutilated, broken, and bound to a chair in a room reeking of blood and filth. He severed the ropes, lifted me, and reassured me that everything would be okay and that she was no longer a threat. It was later revealed that she had been apprehended and sentenced to 20 years in prison.  
  
Over the past two decades, I've undergone therapy with various professionals, all of whom recommended the same thing—finding a way to overcome the fear, anger, and disgust associated with that person. So, I made a decision. On the day she was released from prison, I waited at her house (I broke in). I was hiding in a closet. She returned home and laid down on her sofa. Bursting from the closet, I lunged at her. I covered her mouth to stifle her scream. The next thing she knew, a knife was thrust into her chest. I withdrew my hand and met her gaze. Her final words were... "David?"
