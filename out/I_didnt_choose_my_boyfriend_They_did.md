It was supposed to be another boring Tuesday. It wasn’t late enough in the week to start looking forward to the weekend, but late enough to already feel like I was done with the week. My head felt like it was going to explode from the mind-numbing monotony of work.

I’d been staring at the same column of numbers on my computer for what felt like hours, my mind wandering in desperate search of something - *anything* \- to break up my day. 

“I really have to find another job,” I reminded myself strictly. 

I had been telling myself that for years though, but had never managed to make the move. I told myself it was just me being lazy. But deep down, I think I was scared of change - of moving into the unknown. As much as I hated my job, maybe my next one would be worse. 

I leaned over to my coworker, Alice, and whispered, “Hey, Al, what’d’ya got for me?”

Alice and I had an agreement that when each of us got super bored, we’d share an interesting bit of news or office gossip. The most recent offerings had been things like: “The red panda born at the zoo was named Ralph.” - “Strange lights were seen flying over Cincinnati, Lima, Vancouver, Cape Town and Ouagadougou.” - And,  “Phoebe, from human resources, won $11 on a scratch ticket, bought another ticket with those winnings, and then won $5000 so is taking her new boyfriend on a trip to New Zealand.” 

As you can see, really anything to prod the mind into staying alive. We were able to chuck back names we thought would’ve been better than Ralph (Alice liked “Buster” or “Boots” while I preferred “Bartholomew” and “Atticus”) and we shared our jealousy for Phoebe’s lottery win and griped over never being able to travel anywhere interesting. 

Alice leaned in close. “I’ve got something good. A serial killer just escaped from a high-security prison," she whispered. “No one knows where he is but people think he’s nearby.”

My heart stilled for a moment, then I laughed it off. “That’s not true, is it?”

Alice nodded,  “It’s all over the news. Name’s Sable Graves.”

“*Sable Graves?* No. You’re for sure making that up,” I said.

“When have I ever made up one of my stories, Clara?” prodded Alice. 

I rolled my eyes. “Um, tons of times,” I said. 

“Ok, fair enough,’ she said. “Sometimes I don’t have *real* interesting stories to share. But this one is true, I swear! And interesting, right? Look it up.” 

I turned back to my computer and opened a browser. I typed in: S-A-B-L

But then I stopped - because I noticed things on my desk were vibrating - shaking - clattering. I gripped my mug of coffee tightly to stop it sloshing all over over my keyboard. 

“EARTHQUAKE!” Someone yelled out. 

Memories from primary school earthquake drills pounced on me, forcing me to dive without thinking under my desk. 

“Is this what we’re supposed to do?” I wondered, simultaneously remembering something else about standing in door-frames. 

The office continued shaking, but not in a rocking violent way - it was more a deep vibration. I held my breath, waiting to see if the tremors would build. And I prayed. I wouldn’t say I’m a religious person, but in crisis, I do find myself reaching out. I’ve always had the sense that there is something greater out there. And I figured it never hurt to ask, right? So I prayed, “Please, don’t let it be a bad earthquake!”

The tremors continued steadily. “Almost too steady,” I found myself thinking. 

Then a strange humming began - deep and unnatural- but then suddenly it switched to a horrible high pitch. I covered my ears with my hands and screamed. Maybe I thought my voice could somehow muffle the sound - or maybe I just just plain terrified. 

Without warning, a blinding white light blasted through the windows, engulfing everything in its glow. That’s the last thing I remember. 

I woke up, face flat on the floor. 

I pushed myself up, trying to shake haziness from my eyes. I slowly pulled myself to standing - finding my body was aching as if I’d been thrown into a wall. I peered around, trying to see if everyone else was ok. It was then I realized… 

I wasn’t in the office anymore! 

I was in a house. What looked like living room. One I didn’t recognize at all.

My heart pounded heavily in my chest. The thumping felt deafening in the still silence of the room. I stumbled over to the door. I tried the handle, but it wouldn’t move. I was locked in!

I had the sense that something was dreadfully wrong before this, but now I knew for sure. 

“You have to get out of here!” my brain screamed at me. “Find a way out! Find a way out!”

I scanned the room. There were no other doors, just that one. But a large window stretched across one of the walls. I rushed over, to see if I could get out that way. 

The window was covered by a heavy looking curtain. I tried to swipe it aside, but it wouldn’t move. My brain still wasn’t working well yet - it took me a couple seconds to realize that the curtain wasn’t inside the room… it was on the outside of the window! 

“Why is there a curtain on the outside?” I wondered. 

It made no sense. But nothing really made sense to me at this point. I felt around the window for a latch, an opening, anything. But there was no way to open the window. 

“Find a way out!” My brain shouted at me again. 

I looked around the room for something I could use to break the window. There wasn’t much in it - a simple couch, a bed in the corner, a table with a few miss-matched chairs around it, a desk with a computer and papers scattered about… 

I picked up one of the chairs and hurled it at the window. It bounced back, not even making a crack. I tried again - WHAM! But nothing again. I felt the glass again. I realized it didn’t really feel like glass. More like a sort of plastic - but it was slippery, almost like it was coated in something. I pounded on it. It felt thick, unmoving. My heart plummeted into my stomach with dread. I knew there was no way I was going to be able to break it. I knew I was trapped. 

A tidal wave of fear crashed over me - tears poured down my face. I let myself cry, wail, for about three minutes. But then I told myself, “No! STOP! Pull yourself together! You’re never going to get out of here if you fall to pieces. Stay sharp! Stay smart!” 

I wiped the tears from my face and took several huge breaths to calm myself. Then I switched into my logical brain. 

“Look around,” I told myself. “Maybe something here will tell you where you are.”

I scanned the room again, trying to take in details of the room this time. I realized there weren’t a lot of details. Something about this felt really off. The room didn’t feel lived in. It felt too simple. Sanitized. 

I went to touch the couch. I found it wasn’t soft. It was made of something solid, hard. Like a sort of plaster molded into what looked like a couch. 

I went to the computer desk. Getting close, I realized the computer also wasn’t a normal computer. It too seemed to be crafted of this plaster substance. The papers scattered around had strange symbols on it. And picking them up, I realized they weren’t paper, but some sort of extremely thin metal. Nothing I was taking in could I make any sense of.

“Hello?” I called out. 

No one answered. 

“HELLO!” I shouted as loudly as I could. “IS ANYONE THERE?”

I waited. Listening. Silence. But then- I heard something! A dull scraping sound. My head whipped around to look to where it was coming from. A small panel in the wall was sliding aside, revealing a small opening. 

I ran over to it. “Hello!” I shouted. “Who are you?” 

A tray with a sandwich on it came through the opening, then the panel swiftly slid closed. 

“Wait!” I shouted. “Please, who are you? What’s going on? Hello?! I WANT OUT OF HERE!” 

No amount of shouting or pleading made a difference. No one answered me. I tried to pry the panel back open, but it was impossible. 

I looked down at the sandwich on the tray. And I realized it wasn’t actually a sandwich. I poked it. It was some sort of gelatinous substance shaped and vaguely coloured as a sandwich. Was it even edible? Maybe it was poisonous.” There was no way for me to know. I pushed the tray away.

I suddenly noticed the curtain on the window was moving - it was opening! I ran over to it to watch as the curtain was drawn back. I don’t know what I expected to see on the other side, but it definitely wasn’t what I saw.

I saw a long, dimly lit, hallway stretching from left to right. It was gleamingly clean. The hallway was lined with other curtains, all which were moving aside to reveal windows, like mine. The window directly across from mine was the only one I could get a good look inside of: 

It was filled with vines, twisting and reaching toward the ceiling. Puffs of blue mist ejected from tubes into the room every few seconds. I saw a couple small creatures scurry along the vines - they looked a bit like monkeys - but instead of being covered in fur, they had shiny blue scales on them. One of them stopped and looked directly at me. It blinked its little eyes at me, then pulled something from a pouch in its belly. A perfectly round little pearl. It held it up to me, as if showing it off. Then it pushed it back into its belly pouch and darted off to its companion. 

I was only just starting to try to comprehend what was in front of my eyes when a door at the end of the hallway caught my eye. It was opening.  

Then something emerged. Spindly legs reached into the hall, bringing a multi-eyed creature closer and closer to me. A gigantic SPIDER! I was paralyzed, my body firmly disobeying my mind’s forceful instructions to run and hide.

The spider came closer, its eyes trained on my window. For some reason, I guess my body figured if I could just remain still, it wouldn’t see me. Stupid. The spider came up to the window. I felt its eyes taking me in, scanning my entire body meticulously. Its gaze was so intense I felt it could see parts of me I didn’t even realize were there - a wrinkle at the corner of my eye, a scar on my hand picked up in childhood long since forgotten. Maybe it could even see right into me - see the blood pulsing through my veins - see my lungs screaming for air as I held my breath. 

Frozen in fear, I had no choice but to look straight at it. My first impression had been that it was a gigantic spider, but I realized it wasn’t quite a spider. Its legs didn’t look organic - they had more of a metallic look to them than the hairy body that sat on top. The creature had numerous amber coloured eyes, circling its head like a beady crown. Its mouth held sharp fangs framed by what looked a sort of mandibles. One of the mandibles stretched out to my window, almost like a protractible arm with delicate finger-like tentacles at the end. The tentacles caressed the window. 

I remained frozen, unable to move. I could feel beads of sweat begin to line my brow. 

Eventually, the creature slid its tentacles off the window and disappeared down the hall. That’s when I lost all use of my limbs. I collapsed to the floor, shaking mercilessly. 

Questions swirled in my brain - “What was that thing?! - Where in the world am I?? - Why am I here? - Is that thing going to hurt me? - Is it going to *eat* me?!” 

I hurled everything that was in my stomach onto the floor. A pool of liquid acid was left splayed out in front of me. 

Then I heard a loud KNOCK on the wall at the back of the room. The lights pulsed in my enclosure.

Then a large panel slid open - and two spider creatures came through! They were coming right for me!

I screamed, grabbing a chair, readying myself for a fight to the death. I swung the chair in front of me and shouted: 

“GET AWAY FROM ME! OR I’LL KILL YOU! I WILL! I SWEAR, I WILL!” 

But they kept coming. It was just seconds before I felt the sting in my side. The creature’s spindly leg had moved so swiftly I had barely saw it coming. But a point on its end had stabbed me in the side. My body was immediately overtaken by a flood of warmth.

“I’m going to die now,” I told myself. “This is how it ends.” 

A haziness overtook me. I realized I felt at peace. 

“I’m ok with dying,” I thought, “as long as I stay this comfortable.”

The chair dropped from my hands. I sank softly to the floor, onto my knees. And I watched as the spiders cleaned up my vomit from the floor. Then they departed. The opening in the wall slid closed and I was alone again. 

“Maybe I’ve been dreaming this whole time…?” I thought, as my brain floated in haziness. “When I wake up, I’ll be back home, in my own bed, hugging my teddy bear…”

But then I felt my mind begin to grow sharp again. I felt myself regain control of my body. 

I clutched my hands to my head. I knew I wasn’t dreaming. I realized I had probably just been drugged when I was stabbed by that spider. Then other questions began to tumble through my mind: “Are those spider things real? - Maybe this is a movie set or something? - Is this some kind of weird experiment? - Am I being filmed? - Maybe this is some sort of twisted reality show?”

I pulled myself up, driven by this new mission of mine: “*Find the hidden cameras!”*

“There must be a camera!” I told myself. “This must be a show!” 

Again, stupid, but that honestly made more sense to me than anything else I could comprehend at the time. I reasoned that lifelike robots, designed for some ethically questionable reality show, seemed far more plausible than actual living monsters keeping me captive.

I searched the entire room. 

But I couldn’t find any cameras. Just plain walls. 

This infuriated me. If I had found a camera, at least things would begin to make sense. But nothing made sense. I found my fear transferring into red hot rage. I beat the walls with my fists and screamed. 

Then I heard a click-click-click. I looked back to the window and nearly jumped out of my skin! Many more of those spider things had arrived at my window. They gathered around, peering at me. One extremely large one was tapping on my window: click-click-click. 

Then I saw a swarm of tiny spiders scuttle up on top of that large one. Their beady little eyes all stared at me with something that almost looked like curiosity. “Were these… *children*?” I wondered. The scene looked almost familiar in a strange way… Like families looking at Ralph, the red panda, in the-

The realization hit me at once like a gut punch.

And my memory flashed to what Alice had told me about strange lights seen over cities. I thought about the unnatural vibrations, the humming, the intense flood of light. And I realized, all this time, I had been wondering, “Where in the world am I?”, when I should’ve been wondering, “Where in the *universe* am I?” 

My enclosure, everything, it all made sense now. I was in a zoo! An *ALIEN* zoo*!* 

I had no idea what to do with this information. Emotions like fear and despair and helplessness and anger all swirled together inside me, eventually hardening into a solid rock of spite. I leaped behind the couch and hid. I didn’t want any of them to have the satisfaction of looking at me. 

I curled up into a ball, away from the curious beady eyes. Eventually, I fell asleep. 

I awoke to a knock on the wall. It was the same sound I had heard before my alien captors had entered to clean up my vomit. And the lights pulsed just like they did the time before. I scrambled to the edge of the room, staying far away from the wall I knew was about to open. I didn’t want to get stung again. 

I watched the back wall slide open. Sure enough, two aliens came through into my enclosure. This time, I tried harder to see what was beyond them - where they were coming from - if there was any route for escape. But it looked like they were emerging from a large plain box. I wondered if maybe they had to step into another enclosure before entering mine, to prevent the escape I had been hoping for.

But then I realized, “If I’m in space, or on some alien planet, *where am I escaping to?!”*

Even if I was able to get out of this enclosure, I wouldn’t be able to just flee home, would I? I thought of the puffs of blue mist in the enclosure across from mine and wondered if maybe my air was specially treated for me too.  “Would the air outside even be breathable for me?” I wondered. 

I saw that the aliens were pulling something with them. A platform that hovered just over the floor. On it was something which I couldn’t quite see as their bodies were obstructing my view. They carefully rolled whatever it was off the platform, then left. 

That’s when I finally saw what it was. A *human*! My heart leapt, knowing I wasn’t alone. Getting closer, I saw it was a man. But he wasn’t moving. His eyes were closed. 

“Hello!?” I said. 

He didn’t respond. I kneeled by his side and saw that he was breathing. I remembered myself waking up earlier, disoriented, in that very same place. “He must be drugged,” I thought. I looked at him more carefully. He looked to be about my age, mid 20s, dark hair, with a clean cut look and a strong, tall build. I’d probably think he was attractive if I was attracted to guys. 

I shook his shoulder. It took a couple minutes, but finally I saw his eyes flutter.

“HELLO!?” I shouted. “ARE YOU OK!?”

The man opened his eyes. They were a mix of blue-green-grey - like a stormy ocean. 

“Where am I?” He asked, groggily. 

I wasn’t sure how to respond, having only just come up with an answer to that question myself. And I found myself too scared to say it out loud. I knew it would sound crazy and I didn’t want to rattle the poor fellow. Not right away, anyhow. “Let him settle a bit first,” I told myself.

“Who are you?” He asked. 

“I’m Clara.” I told him.

“Clara. Hi. It’s really nice to meet you.” He looked up at me and smiled, his eyes twinkling with charisma. I wondered if he was still under the haziness of the drug. He didn’t seem as freaked out as I had expected him to be. 

“What do you remember?” I asked him. “I mean, do you remember what happened, before you woke up?”

His smile dropped. I could see him wracking his brain for memories. “Where am I…?” he asked again, as he slowly pulled himself up, taking in the room around him. 

Then he swore mightily! “This is a prison, isn’t it!?” He yelled.  

He stumbled to his feet and circled the room, feeling all the walls. 

“I…umm.. do you remember a light?” I asked. 

“A light?” The man said, confused, as he continued his scan of the enclosure. The window curtain was now closed, so he couldn’t see into the hall beyond.

The man seemed to be feeling the walls for weaknesses. He hit a button I hadn’t even realized was there - a wide rimmed bucket popped out of the wall. “That’ll be the toilet, I guess,” he said, reaching down into it as far as he could before pushing it back into the wall with frustration. 

I felt suddenly embarrassed that I had been here longer than him and he already seemed to be finding out more about the room than I had. 

“But if this is a prison…” he said, turning to give me a long look, “why are you in here too?”

He walked right at me, eyes coldly locked on mine. I found myself retreating until I hit the corner of the room.

“You’re not in uniform,” he said. “So you’re not a guard, are you?”

I shook my head. “I think we’re in a zoo,” I blurted out. “An alien zoo. In space.” 

If he thought I was crazy, his face didn’t show it. His expression didn’t change at all. He continued staring at me with calculating eyes.  

“Do you remember the news stories?” I asked him, “About those strange lights in the sky?”

“I don’t read the news,” he said. 

“Ok, well…” the words flooded out of me in a garbled mess, “there were these strange lights seen in the sky, all over the world- Vancouver, Ouagadougou- I didn’t think much of them before- not until I was taken. I mean, I think we’ve been taken. By- well, before I woke up here, I remember vibrating, strange sound of humming, and a blast of light. Do you? Do you remember a light like that? I think we’ve been taken by aliens. I’m not crazy, I swear! I’ve seen them. The aliens. They brought you in here. And they watch us from that window over there. When the curtain is open, you can see other enclosures, with more specimens, like us.” 

“Are you calling me a *specimen*?” He asked, his voice hard. 

“I think we’re part of their zoo exhibit, is what I mean,” I said. “I think you just need to see them first- to really understand. I know, it’s a lot to- I get it if you don’t believe me.”

I watched as he took in this information. As he scanned the room again, I could see a memory coming to him - a look of realization settling in his face…

“The lights…” he said. “Yes,  I do remember the lights… I was in the forest, I saw a group of lights high in the sky. I thought they were drones. But one came closer and closer to me. It wasn’t a drone. I knew that for sure. It was something else. It was huge. It hovered right over me, above the trees. And I remember a horrible noise. And the light. Then I remember you. Here.” 

“So, you do believe me?!” I asked. 

He looked back at me, his eyes twinkling again, with that charismatic smile he first smiled at me with. 

“Clara, I’m really good at reading people,” he said. “And I can tell you’re an honest person. I know you wouldn’t lie to me.” He took my hand in his and and squeezed it. 

“Yes,” he said. “I believe you.”

I couldn’t help but smile. It felt so good, in that moment, to know I wasn’t completely alone in this nightmare.

“What’s your name?” I asked him.

He hesitated a moment. Then replied: “You can call me Patrick.” 

“Nice to meet you, Patrick,” I said. “I’m sorry this is happening to you as well.”

“One bed,” he said. 

“What?” I asked, confused. 

“There’s only one bed,” he said, gesturing to the bed at the side of the room. “You think they want us to, you know… be a couple?”

“What? No,” I said, moving away. “There’s a couch too. I can sleep there, it’s fine.”

“You can sleep wherever you’d like, darling,” he said with his twinkly eyed smile. 

I felt my heart sink into my stomach. Something about his smile was beginning to creep me out. I went to sit on the couch. I watched as he picked up the tray with the gelatinous sandwich.

“This supposed to be food?” He asked me. 

I shrugged. He took a large bite out of it. 

“Aren’t you afraid it may be poisonous?” I asked him. 

“If they wanted us dead, we’d be dead, don’t you think?” he said, munching. “It’s not that bad, actually. Want to try some?”

I shook my head, figuring it would be better to wait and see how his stomach dealt with it.

It wasn’t long before the curtain opened again. I watched as Patrick approached the window and looked into the other enclosure. He waved to the little monkey creatures across from us. “It’s showing me something, from its pouch. What is it…?” He asked. 

“The little pearl?” I replied. 

He nodded. “It seems very proud of it. I think it may be an egg. WOAH!” 

He was now looking down the hall. “When you said aliens, I was picturing little grey men,” he told me. 

He appeared shocked, but not really scared. He watched more in curiosity as a pair of the spider creatures approached our window. One extended its mandible out to the glass. Patrick reached his hand out to meet it. Then he laughed!

“This is amazing!” He said. “I mean, if I have to be kept in a cage, at least it’s an interesting one. Of course it doesn’t hurt that I’ve got a pretty girl with me for company.”

He shot me another smile. 

“I should tell you,” I said, “I’m not interested in guys. Never have been.”

“The lives we lived before,” he said, “they don’t matter. Here, *this*, this is all that matters now. Our entire world now exists within these walls.” 

“What are you trying to say?” I asked, point-blank. 

“That I think you’ll learn to like me,” he said with a confidence that made my skin crawl. I watched him look back to the window. 

“Oh, come, you gotta see this!” He said. “The egg, it’s hatching!”

I saw the spiders retreat from our window so decided to go take a look. I went and saw the spiders were now watching the little money creatures. The two were both holding the little pearl, which was splitting into pieces. It was an egg, because inside was a little baby monkey! The spiders clicked their legs on the glass of the enclosure. The parent monkeys held up their child proudly. 

“I bet they want us to have kids too,” Patrick said, looking at me with a grin. 

“That won’t be happening,” I told him. 

“I think you should choose a new name,” he said. 

“Why would I do that?” I asked. 

“I think you’ll have an easier time adapting to our new reality if you leave your old life behind,” he explained. 

Then I remembered his hesitation when I had asked what his name was. 

“Is your name really Patrick?” I asked. 

“Yes,” he said with a smile. “It is now.”

“What was your name before though?” I asked. 

“I told you, before doesn’t matter,” he said. 

“It matters to me!” I said. 

He just smiled at me, then walked away. I watched as he picked up things around the room, examining them. He rifled through the “papers” at the desk. He picked one up and felt the edge of it. He pressed his finger along the corner, slicing his skin open. 

“Hmm, sharp,” he said, sucking the blood away with his mouth. He then started to fold the sheet. 

“I always liked the name Rosemary,” he said. “I think that’s what I’ll call you.”

“My name is Clara,” I said. 

“Now it’s Rosemary,” he said. 

“How would you like it if I just picked a name for you?” I asked. “Like, now your name is…” For some reason my mind blanked for all male names. But one name jumped to mind: 

“Sable,” I said. 

Hearing that name, he turned quickly to me, his eyes flashing with what looked like rage. I knew immediately I had made a huge mistake.

“You will call me Patrick.” He said in a calm but ice cold tone. 

My heart was thumping painfully in my chest. I felt like I couldn’t breathe. Like I was going to pass out. I knew why the name Sable had jumped to my mind - it’s the name I had been typing into my computer when the office had started shaking. Sable Graves. I hadn’t had time to see what he looked like.

“Why don’t you like the name Sable?” I asked quietly, afraid to know the answer. 

“I think you know why,” he said. “Don’t you, Rosemary?”

I looked to the sheet that Patrick - or Sable Graves - was folding and now saw that it now was in the shape of a knife.

“Maybe, Sable is a name from your past that you’d like to leave behind?” I whispered. 

He nodded, his expression remaining stoney. 

“Ok,” I said. “I understand, Patrick."

He smiled at me, but the twinkle didn’t reach his eyes this time. He pushed his newly made knife into his pocket. I watched him closely as he wandered back to the window. He gazed out of it, watching the little monkeys in the enclosure across from us. 

“They’re a cute little family, aren’t they?” He said. 

I nodded. 

“Rosemary, my darling,” he asked. “Can I ask you a question?” 

“Sure,” I said. 

“What do you think would happen if one of us died?” He asked. “Do you think they would go back to Earth? Pick us up a new partner?” 

I felt like the wind had been knocked from me. He turned to me, patiently waiting to hear my response. 

“I… I don’t know,” was all I was able to squeak out. 

“I think they would.” He said. 

“Not that I think either of us will die!” He added with a laugh. “Not if we live harmoniously together, like that little family over there. I’m tired. Let’s go to bed, my darling.”

“I’ll sleep on the couch,” I said. 

“Rosemary, my darling,” he said softly, “I think you’ll be more comfortable in the bed.”

“The couch is fine,” I said firmly. 

His eyes turned cold again. 

“Come to bed, Rosemary,” he said. 

“I’m not tired yet,” I told him. 

He started walking towards me. The look on his face terrified me. I grabbed a chair and held it in front of me. 

“Stay away from me!” I shouted. 

But he pulled out the knife from his pocket. “If you don’t want to be a family, that’s fine!” He said. “They’ll find me someone who will!”

I don’t remember much from after this. I know he tried to stab me. And I know I got the knife from him. And there was blood. A lot of blood. 

Then there were spiders. Coming at us. Then the sting. 

I woke up, my face flat on the floor. It took me a minute to realize that it wasn’t the cold hard ground of the enclosure. It was grass! And I could feel the warmth of the sun shining down on me. 

I pulled myself up. I found I was in the middle of a field.

I started walking. I walked and walked, having no idea where I was. Eventually, I came to a farmhouse. There was a woman there with her kids. She helped me. She told me I was in Missouri. I’d never been to Missouri in my life. 

The woman phoned 911. 

I chose not to tell anyone the true story. I didn’t think I would be believed. 

But I think people deserve to know the truth about what’s out there.
