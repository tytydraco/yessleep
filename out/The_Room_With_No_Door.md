They told me not to go upstairs.

Not because the house was old or dangerous. Not because the floorboards were weak or the roof sagged. But because, according to everyone who had ever lived or visited there, the second floor didn’t exist.

I heard that line over and over, “There’s nothing up there.”

But I wasn’t stupid. I could see the windows from outside. Three of them, all curtained, with panes that caught the moonlight just right. I could see the shadow of a railing through the glass. The staircase stretched up in plain view, tucked behind a crooked archway in the hall.

They said the stairs led to nowhere. But they didn’t. They led to something. I just had to know what.

One night, after everyone had gone to bed, I crept out of my room. The house was quiet, too quiet. Even the usual hum of pipes or the tick of the old grandfather clock downstairs had fallen silent, like the house was holding its breath.

The stairs groaned beneath my feet, each one protesting like it was waking from a long sleep. I moved slowly, one step at a time, my fingers trailing along the dusty railing.

At the top, I expected a hallway. Maybe a row of old doors, a forgotten bedroom or storage room. But there wasn’t any of that.

There was only a wall.

A flat, unbroken expanse of faded wallpaper. Green with a repeating pattern of roses, each one wilting mid-bloom. No windows. No seams. No doorframe.

I stood frozen, heart thudding. The air was different here. Heavier. As if I’d stepped into a place where time had stopped moving.

I reached out and touched the wall.

It was warm. Not like plaster or pain. Warm, like skin. And it throbbed gently, like there was a slow pulse beneath it. I snatched my hand back, heart racing.

That’s when I heard it.

Breathing.

Soft, rhythmic, and unmistakably human.

It wasn’t coming from me. It wasn’t an echo.

It was coming from behind the wall.

I leaned in, slowly, pressing my ear to the surface. The breathing continued, slow and steady, as though someone was sleeping inches away on the other side.

But there couldn’t be anything behind it. There was no space. No room.

Unless….

Unless the wall wasn’t built to keep people out.

It was built to keep something in.

I backed away. Something inside me screamed to leave, to go back down and pretend I hadn’t heard anything. But then I noticed something else.

The wallpaper had started peeling.

A single corner had curled back as if tugged from behind, revealing something dark underneath. Not wood. Not insulation.

Flesh.

I stumbled, turned, ran down the stairs. I didn’t look back, not even when I felt the thud of something heavy hit the other side of that wall.

I haven’t been back up there since. I don’t talk about it, and I never ask about the second floor again.

But sometimes, especially on quiet nights when the wind is still, I hear it.

Not the breathing.

Not anymore.

Now it whispers.

And they’re calling my name.
