Let me preface this by saying that this isn’t my first attempt at getting help. I’ve scoured the internet for answers, but I’ve come up empty every time. This feels like a last resort—maybe even a kind of insurance policy. Because if things get any worse, I think I’m going to be in serious trouble.

So I’ll start at the beginning.

My name is Leo, and when I was a kid, I was happy. It was just my parents, my little sister Carrie, and me. We weren’t rich, but my dad made decent money as a fishing guide, which meant my mom could bounce between jobs whenever she got bored. For a while, she was a DJ at the only radio station in town. Then she ran a daycare. You get the idea.

What really united us was the outdoors. We spent as much time outside as possible—camping, fishing (always my dad’s idea), hiking, snowmobiling, or skiing in the winter. My dad taught me how to keep our machines running. My mom taught my sister first aid, how to pitch a tent, little survival skills.

We really were happy.

Then my mom died.

There was nothing dramatic about it. No car crash. No final words whispered from a hospital bed. She had a stroke one afternoon and never woke up. She was only forty, but strokes ran in her family, so the doctors weren’t surprised.

She stayed in a coma for months. Machines breathed for her. Tubes fed her. The doctors told us early on that there was no brain activity, no chance of recovery. Visiting her felt like standing beside a mannequin that still wore my mother’s face.

One day, she died.

After that, my dad stopped believing in things.

We quit going to church. He started taking days off work until he was eventually fired. Most days, he sat on the couch watching reruns of football games he’d already seen. He tried to smile for Carrie and me. It was so sad, though. His eyes told the story. He was spent. He had no drive to carry on.

We even went camping a few times, but it felt wrong without Mom. Like we were trespassing in our own memories.

Exactly one year after my mom died, my dad started drinking.

At first, it was one drink at night. Then it turned into a handle every few days. He didn’t get violent. He didn’t scream. He just… stalled. Like a machine left idling too long.

When the money ran out, he took a job at the gas station down the block. After he lost his license, he sold his car. He had no family to fall back on—he was an only child, and his parents were already in a nursing home. My mom’s parents quietly blamed him for her death.

It was just us. One sad little family.

Eventually, my dad stopped taking care of us. He’d leave shopping lists so Carrie and I could bike into town. He handed us his credit card when we needed clothes. He worked. He drank. That was it.

So we took care of each other.

I cooked. Carrie kept track of groceries and schoolwork. It wasn’t great, but we survived.

I didn’t handle it well. I stopped trying in school and coasted by with C’s. Carrie was the opposite—good grades, organized, always pushing forward. When I turned eighteen, I moved out. I got a cheap apartment in a bad part of town and a dead-end job at Best Buy, telling people to unplug their printers and plug them back in for eight hours a day.

Carrie eventually moved out, too. She married her high school sweetheart, got a business degree from the community college, and landed a job at an ad agency. We stayed in touch, but we weren’t close. Holidays, mostly. And we never talked about Dad.

Neither did he.

Years passed like that. Then, about a week ago, everything changed.

I had just gotten back from a particularly boring shift in early January when my phone rang.

It was my dad.

The only call I ever got from him.

I stared at the screen until it stopped ringing… then rang again. Eventually, I answered.

“Hello?”

“I figured it out!” he said. His voice was sharp, excited. “I know what to do now. I know where to go. I know exactly what must be done!”

Then the line went dead. I tried calling back frantically. No answer.

I didn’t sleep that night. He didn’t sound drunk. He sounded… almost happy. Unstable, but clear. I tried calling back over and over, but it went straight to voicemail. I told myself I couldn’t afford to miss work to check on him.

So I tried to forget it.

A week later, police found my dad dead.

Neighbors had reported someone walking through the woods near our old family house around midnight, screaming the word “COMING!” over and over. When they found him, he was naked, face down in the snow, heading straight north.

The coroner said he died of exposure.

When I finally saw the body, I barely recognized him. He looked decades older. Thin. Shriveled. Almost hollow. There was a star-shaped mark drawn on his chest in black ink. The coroner told me my dad had been holding a Sharpie when they found him.

That’s how my only remaining parent died. Alone in the woods.

Carrie and I inherited everything—what little there was. She gave it all to me.

“I don’t want anything that reminds me of him,” she said. “Sell it. I don’t care.”

I decided I would sell the house. I could definitely use the money. So I went there yesterday.

Dust covered everything. It looked like my dad had hardly lived there. Cans and bags littered the floor. The smell hit me so hard I had to step back outside. The barn was the same—silent, stale. It looked like my dad had been working on his old snowmobile. The hood was open, tools laid out. The only thing not sacrificed to the years.

“Gotta hand it to you, dad; you sure did love your toys,” I mumbled under my breath.

I remembered enough from when I was little to put it back together again. I plugged the carburetors into the engine block, tightened the airbox, and tried to start it. Nothing. Just coughing and sputtering.

I slammed the hood shut, kicked it, and walked out.

No sooner had I shut the door did the engine roar to life behind me.

I froze. That snowmobile doesn’t have an electric start. It needs the ripcord pulled—there’s no other way.

When I opened the barn door, exhaust fumes rolled out. The headlight cut through the dust like a spotlight. The engine began to rev on its own, higher and higher, until a hose blew with a deafening “BANG”.

I ran. I left the door swinging behind me. I jumped in my car, floored it, and never looked back, the explosion ringing in my ears the whole way home. I swear I could hear the wailing of the snowmobile follow me all the way back to my house.

Now it’s the next day. I need to fix the place up and sell it—I need the money. But I don’t know if I can go back into that barn.

I’ve checked everything I can. There is no mechanical explanation for what happened.

If any of you have ideas, please tell me.

I don’t know what to do.
