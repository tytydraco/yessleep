I shouldn’t be writing this down. He said if I told anyone I'd pay for it. It’s been 3 months since I’ve made this deal, and I have to hold my end of the bargain up tonight. I’m going to write down everything I’ve experienced and post it as time goes on. Hopefully he doesn’t find out about this.

If you’ve ever walked through a Louisiana swamp at night, you know the air doesn’t just sit heavy—it smothers you. The smell of rot and swamp grabs onto your clothes. Frogs, crickets, and cicadas alike croak and chirp, until all at once, it all stops. The silence is worse than anything, because he carries it with him. I felt it the first time I came here, carrying the sack of fish he asked for. With each step my boots sank deeper—requiring more effort to pull out each time, and I swear the swamp created ripples on its own, as if it was holding its breath. 

The water darkened and the algae got fuller and thicker as I approached the swamp's center. The murky water swayed as the swamp took a breath of life. He rose from a wave of water black as tar, his form bending the surface as if the swamp itself obeyed him. His at least ten foot frame towered over me—tall and imposing like a wall. Moonlight caught the rivulets of water cascading down his face—casting the swamp in a sickening blue hue.

“Where y’at, boy?” The voice rolled out low and wet with a deep growl, like the swamp itself had learned to speak. “Awrite boy, I see you brought me somethin’ proper!” He smiled—or at least I think he did. His whiskers twitched and wiggled at the ends, water kept streaming down them like inky black strands of oil. 

“Don’t be shy now. A little lagniappe for me, a little fortune for you. That’s how this works. One meal a month, cher. Just one. You give, I give.” There was something about his low syrup-thick voice that dragged you in while somehow managing to keep you in place.

His mouth curled wider, showing teeth too flat and too many. “’Member why ya here, boy. Don’t play dumb and shy wit’ me.” 

The words stuck under my skin like leeches. Because he was right. I did remember. I remembered her walking out of my apartment with her bags, chasing someone with more money. I remembered the way I swore in anger that I’d do anything to never feel that small and insignificant again. And I remembered how the swamp called me that night, like it knew my anger better than I did.

I swallowed the lump in my throat and shakily stepped forward. Each step I took churned the mud and water into a slush that I needed to pry myself out of. I hoisted the bag of fish over my shoulder—the air around it smelt like my dad’s trawler, only left in the sun for far too long. When the bag hit the ground he let out a wet, rattling like  snicker that vibrated in his throat. He lifted the bag and let out a single laugh, like a sharp crack in the air,  and then swallowed it whole. 

His throat bulged as the fish slid down his grotesque slimy form. For a moment the swamp itself seemed to shudder along with him. Then he let out a low satisfied growl, licking the corners of his mouth. His breath was hot and sticky—smelt of death. 

“Dat’s real good, boy. You keep bringin’ me meals, an’ I’ll be bringin’ you fortune. Gold in your pockets, luck on your back. You won’t never feel that small again.” His voice dripped sweet honey as he chuckled, but his eyes pinned me in place like a piece of rebar stuck through my foot.

He leaned in closer, whiskers twitching as he exhaled. He was so close I could make out bumps along his long flowing whiskers. “But, fish didn’t last long, did it now? Next time bring me some white meat—raw, tender, and clean. You hear that boy? Don’t come back wit’ nothin less.”

My hands couldn’t stop shaking. My chest felt tight, like the swampy air itself was crawling into my lungs and stealing my breath. Part of me wanted to run, but another part—an uglier part—lit up at his words. Riches. Power. Never being the one left behind again. The thought made me sick and thrilled at once. 

I shifted my weight as I grabbed my left arm with my right. I nodded and let out a low whimper, “Y-yes, sir,” I said, voice still trembling and wavering. He nodded before falling into the water and disappearing into the murky wet-lands.

I turned away from the swamp and slowly started trudging back. Eventually the swamp flooded back to life as I made my way further from him. The air felt thinner now—less suffocating, but the weight on my chest didn’t leave. Each step I took I wet squelch followed, reminding me of where I was. I was going home. Farther from him, but also deeper into what I promised. 

By the time I reached my apartment the sun was completely set, and only the glow of street lights remained. I didn’t bother washing the mud from my boots—just took them off on the mat by the door. 

I sat on the edge of my bed, hands trembling, staring at the floor. Even here, in my own apartment, the air smelled faintly of rotten fish and swamp water, clinging to my skin and clothes. I wanted to tell myself it had all been a nightmare—but the thrill in my chest, dark and hungry, told a different story. He had promised power, fortune, a way to never be forgotten, and part of me, the part still simmering with anger and resentment since she left, wanted to believe him.

Fear returned with a sharper edge. The swamp hadn’t just consumed the fish—it had taken something from me too. I could feel it lingering, a weight pressing at my mind, like teeth grazing the edges of my thoughts. I wanted to run, to tell someone, to undo what I’d agreed to—but my lips stayed sealed.

Every time I closed my eyes, I saw him: towering, black as tar, moving through the water with an impossible, unnatural grace. And beneath it all, gnawing at my gut, I felt the truth of my bargain. Riches and power weren’t free. They never were. And the next month… I knew, in a way I didn’t want to admit, that it would demand far more than fish.
