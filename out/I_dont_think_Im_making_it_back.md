*Transmission received*

January 15th. The day that I was sent up here, supposedly for "research". I think they just wanted me gone. The fucking government sent me to this godforsaken space station, equipped with experimental.. everything. Warp drives, life support, everything was an experiment. And I was the gullible test subject.

I can't believe that I'm so stupid. That I fell for this shit. Forgive my French, but I'm beyond pissed.

It's too late for me, but it isn't for you. If you want to live your life ignorant, close this post. Not even sure it'll get out there, anyways.

The fucking internet on this thing is shit, despite it practically being a satellite, but I hope it's enough.

I'm getting off track. I'm terrified. Sorry. They sent me up here to do some research on Europa, and that's what I believed. Wish I didn't.

I'm too gullible, and that's what's gonna get me killed. This may as well be the last thing I ever send out, save for that failed book.

I got there fine, and I was scheduled to be back by March 15th. That didn't happen. I got a message from HQ, and what it said made my heart skip a beat.

I didn't think it was going to be anything bad, if anything, I thought it was going to be praise. But it wasn't. It was so, so much worse.

"I'm sorry, David, but you can't come home. It was just too expensive. The research we received was amazing, you did a great job, but we can't let you come back. You signed papers, you knew the risks. Emma will be compensated. Sorry, but this isn't negotiable. HQ out."

Under that bullshit was a note. It said that I should have read the fine print and that I won't be missed. Talk about rubbing salt in the wound.

I'm currently orbiting a black hole, where the thrusters fired me towards. It's eerily beautiful.

It's just a pit. It's not as horrific as I thought it would be.

I...

I can't let this be the end. I just can't.

If you hear of an organization called "DeepSpace Exploratory Group", or DSEG, don't let them trick you. Don't get yourself killed.

I hate this station, I hate that damn organization, and I hate myself for the shit I did to cause all this. It's my fault.

I think I'll have to resign to my fate.

I'm sorry Emma. I'm so, so sorry. I didn't want it to end I'm this, and I don't think you'll even read this. I wish I could get home. Tell Thomas that Daddy loves him. Thomas, if you somehow find this, I love you, sport. Keep practicing your bat swinging. I miss you all. Mom, and Dad, I'm so sorry. I didn't think this would happen.

I'll be back in a bit, to read any possible comments. Again, I don't think it'll even get out. If it does, please, I beg of you, give me advice. Please.

This shit is just too much, I'm fucking done.

I'm going for a spacewalk.
