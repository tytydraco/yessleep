It took a very long time for me to share this story openly with anyone, not even with those closest to me or knew me well enough. It was not until a few years ago that I decided to share it with everyone, in fact it was the catalyst for me starting my own podcast.   
  
This story spans 30 years…

  
Back in the early 90’s I was just starting high school. At the time I had long term girlfriend named Kara but she attended a different high school in a different city about 20 miles north of where I lived. 

  
Kara and I had our typical evening routine. We would talk on the phone for about an hour, talking about our day, making plans or talking about the latest episode of Beverly Hills 90210. Typical high school shit.   
  
We were two typical teens that were in love. Talking about our future plans as if we were going to be together forever.   
  
Sometimes we would discuss her drill team schedule and the upcoming competitions I would attend with her. Kara was on the drill team for her school, and they would compete regionally with other schools in the surrounding districts. I was still teaching myself how to edit audio and I would often make her mix tapes that her team would create routines with.   
  
That shit was a pain in the ass too. I didn’t have a computer capable of doing any of the editing. I was literally teaching myself how to physically splice physical tape using audio cassettes. I became damn good at it. 

  
My family didn’t own a cordless phone at the time. Instead, we had one of those wall mounted touch button phones with the 800ft coiled phone chord that would constantly get tangled up in itself. This usually meant that I was in kitchen where the phone was mounted when Kara and I were having one of our evening phone sessions. 

  
One night, as Kara and I were discussing her upcoming drill team competition, my mom started calling out for me from the living room. I walked from the kitchen into the living room still talking to Kara when the local news cast came on.   
  
My mom told me to keep watching as she saw something very alarming on the news.   
It was the top story that evening…

  
A young girls body was found just outside of her high school that same morning. I remember being on the phone with Kara and watching the news at they covered the story.   
  
It was December 14th, 1991. The name of the girl whose body was found was named Sara Yarborough. 

She was on the drill team for her school. Apparently, she had gone to the school early that morning and planned to meet with the rest of her team to prepare for a local drill team competition…a competition that my girlfriend Kara and her team were scheduled to compete at.   


Her body was found partially clothed and she was unfortunately sexually assaulted and strangled.   
  
Now if the similarities weren’t already kind of freaky…the moment they showed a photo of Sara on the news chills ran down my spine.   
  
Sara had curly, fiery red hair…and so did Kara. In fact, they even shared similar facial features. I immediately told Kara to turn on her tv to watch the news with me and were both thoroughly creeped the fuck out. The similarities were too strong to ignore. Their names were similar, Sara and Kara, both with bright red curly hair and both were on their school’s drill team.   
  
For some reason the photo they aired on the news was burned into my memory. She had this very distinct earring in her ear. A hoop with a little white flower on it.   
  
At that moment Kara was getting a call on the other line so she answered it. Moments later she came back to our line to let me know it was their drill team coach informing her that the competition they were going to attend, was now canceled. Her coach did not provide any details, but Kara and I already knew exactly why…  
  
That night Kara and I both went to bed feeling very uneasy. In fact, over the next few days, we were overcome with this sense of dread.

  
But as time went on, this event became a faded memory. We continued through the school year writing love notes to one another that we’d send in the mail, attending drill competitions, making endless amounts of mix tapes. Life was back to normal, but this would not last.   
  
It was now August 1992. 

  
Summer was upon us and another school year was coming to a close. It was picture day at my school. Picture day was a symbol of the year coming to a close. Everyone would go get their big white envelopes full of 8x10 glossy headshots and wallet sized photos and share them with their friends. Kids would usually write something on the back of them, like signing a yearbook and exchanging them with their friends like Pokémon cards. 

  
That year I shared a locker with my friend Ivy. She was one of my best friends in school. She was your typical happy go-lucky bubbly high school teenager, popular and well liked. I was more quite and reserved.   
  
I had retrieved my photos earlier in the day but I didn’t bother looking at them as I didn’t really care all that much so I just placed them in the top shelf of the locker.   
  
At the end of the day all the kids were looking at their school photos, comparing them, sharing them, etc. like they always did. Ivy and I met at our locker, and she was excited to see my photos, she kept begging me for one. So after some begging and pleading I decided to take them out so I could give on of the wallet sized photos to her.   
  
When I opened them up and took them out…I froze. Chills ran throughout my body, and I just froze. I do not even remember if I was still breathing but this overwhelming feeling of dread consumed me.   
  
The first 8x10 photo I pulled out of the envelope was not a photo of me.   
It was a photo of Sara Yarborough. The same EXACT photo that was shown on the news. The same fiery red hair, and that hoop earring with the 5 petaled flower on it.   
  
I remember I started shaking in fear and confusion. Ivy, being totally clueless as to why, asked me whose photos they were thinking I was given the wrong ones. I looked at the front of the envelope and it was my name written on it.   
  
I thought this may have been some kind of mix up but I don’t know how…our names were nothing alike, the school Sara went to was almost an hour away from the school I went to. Then I started to feel like this was deliberate. I started thinking about the similarities between my girlfriend Kara and Sara…both redheads, both on the drill teams for their schools. Maybe this was some kind of message or a warning?

  
I looked at the rest of the photos and some of them were of Sara and some were of me.   
I remember telling Ivy that I needed to leave immediately, and I did. I grabbed all my belongings and I left with the photos without explaining anything to anyone.   
  
I walked home by myself looking over my shoulder constantly. It was a 1.5 mile walk from school to my home, a walk I had done thousands of times but this time it was the longest 1.5 miles I had ever walked. 

  
When I got home, my mom was already there nursing a migraine. I immediately went into her room and showed her the photos. She was also taken back by the fact that I had these photos as she remembered watching the news with me that cold night in December 1991.   
  
We ended up calling the news station that ran the story and explained to them what happened. They were able to give me the number to the company Sara’s father worked at and we called him and explained to him what had happened.   
  
He was very kind but distraught. He was very thankful for me reaching out. I felt like this may have been some kind of closure for him. As if in a way this was Sara’s way of letting her father know she was ok now, if you believe in that sort of thing.   
  
He gave me his address and I sent the photos to him.   
  
That was the last I ever spoke of it. 

  
Years went by, then decades and Sara’s killer remained at large. As DNA technology improved, they were able to create a DNA profile from the crime scene but all they could determine is that the killer was related to the original Mayflower settlers, and he was deemed The Mayflower Killer.   
  
I never shared this story with anyone for what I considered obvious reasons to me. For one, most people would not even believe me and two, those I had shared it with started looking at me funny as if I had something to do with it. So for 28 years I never spoke of it.   
  
In September of 2019 it was announced that due to advancements in genetic genealogy, investigators were able to narrow it down to 2 suspects that were related. Eventually investigators were able to narrow it down to a grifter named Patrick Nichols.   
  
On May 10th, 2023, Patrick Nichols was found guilty of first-degree and second-degree murder with sexual motivation, and he was sentenced to 46 years in prison. He was 27 years old when he committed the crime, and he will be 104 by the time he is released…

  
I still can't explain how or why this happened. School photos are usually taken and managed by a vendor. Was it just a simple mix up? I will likely never know.   
  
But now I can talk about it openly, I can share my story and connection to Sara Yarboroughs senseless murder.  

  
And I can share my story about how I received a message, from the other side.
