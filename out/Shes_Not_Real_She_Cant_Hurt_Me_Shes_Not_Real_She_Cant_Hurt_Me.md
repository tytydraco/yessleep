I crack the window and focus on the consistent rumbling of wheels over tarmac and humming of the engine. The chill air might help me stay awake. My eyes heavy and stinging from severe sleep deprivation and my mind clouded by a drunken haze. I have to keep going. I have to leave. Surely she can't follow me forever. Surely she can't reach me everywhere.

I thought freedom would mean escape, but it made no difference. Getting out just allowed her to get closer. That's the closest she's ever felt, I just had to get out of that place. I shouldn't have drank but fuck it. I'm done. If leaving town and getting as far away as I can doesn't help, then I give up. It's not worth running if she's always there. Her relentlessness is almost admirable. She's determined to get to me and I fear one day she might. What would she do to me I sometimes wonder. Would she kill me there and then or would she drag me away for a worse fate? It doesn't bear thinking about. Perhaps she just enjoys the torment.

I glance in the rear-view mirror and see a blueish purple face, covered in cuts, staring back at me from the back seat. Her eyes dark as night, thick black blood rolls like tar down her cold peeling cheeks that reveal the rot within. The car no longer fresh with the chill night air now full of her putrid stench, so thick It makes me cough. I rip the mirror from the windscreen and hurl it to the passenger footwell, clanging over empty bottles. Too fearful to look behind I keep my eyes focused on the road. Tunnel vision forms as the darkness closes in. I press down on the accelerator and desperately try to outrun her. My heart losing any ounce of hope.

A figure begins to take shape in the darkness ahead. As I get closer the figure sharpens. A slightly tilted head and lifelessly slumped shoulders. It's her. My brains instincts kick in and I automatically swerve. Time seemingly stops for a moment as we lock eyes again, like we did all those years ago. This time mine are the ones filled with fear. All I hear is the screeching of rubber, scraping of metal and glass smashing before everything goes dark.

I slowly come to with my eyes shut, enjoying the gentle crackling of the burning vehicle. I feel the cold road beneath me and the warmth of nearby flames, licking the air. A moment of peace, something I haven't felt in a minute. Then, a wet softness presses against my nose. I smell her thick scent. So strong and close she may as well have crawled inside my nostrils and taken up residence. My lungs filled with a foreign substance almost thick enough to suffocate on. I hear her. That god awful sound. Every breath as heavy and laboured as the next. Each shallow rasping breath gets louder...and louder...and louder. My whole body trembles as my eyes remain firmly shut, paralyzed with the fear of what might come.
