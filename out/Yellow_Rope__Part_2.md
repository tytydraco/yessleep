I closed the door to my Atlanta apartment for the last time, with only a single black backpack with me. A dingy, 200 square foot studio apartment, it smelled like decades old cigarette smoke and mold. You wouldn’t know it by the single twin-size air mattress on the floor, but it had been my home for the past 2 years. Regardless of what came next, I wasn’t coming back. I placed my key on the desk of the front office. Paula, the properly manager, gave me a dismissive wave, not bothering to look up from her phone. I left the office, anxious for what was to come, and began my walk to the bus station.

As I walked to the bus station, I looked around Atlanta for the last time. I often watched other people going about their daily lives. I would see couples living happily in their much nicer apartments, and I would wonder how different my life would have been if I had never gone down that trail. Maybe it would be me, happily married, in a nice apartment, or maybe it’d be me in a suit-and-tie, walking busily to an important business meeting. I would always quickly bring myself back to reality though, my reality, a nightmare.

I felt a tinge of anxiousness, fear, and anticipation for what was to come. In a way, it felt good, to actually feel something, even if it was fear.  I got on the bus and settled into my seat for the 400-mile journey, back to my hometown.

“Hey buddy”, the bus driver said, as he stood over my seat. “Rise and shine, time to get off”. I sat up in my seat, rubbing my eyes and frantically looking around. “Relax man, you’re here, the ride’s over”, the driver said. I looked out the window and saw the familiar sight of the Blue Ridge Mountains in the distance. Stepping off the bus, the sun was shining, the mountain air fresh. There was a slight breeze in the air, and, by anyone else’s account, it would’ve been considered a beautiful day. To me though, the mountains held an ominous, dark feeling. The sun felt oppressive, and I was half expecting the breeze to carry that dreadful smell of decay to me.

It took me one Uber, and one ride on the back of an old man’s tailgate to bring me within walking distance of my childhood home. Honestly, I wasn’t even sure if my parents still lived there. I wasn’t even sure they were even still alive. Walking, I passed familiar houses, remembering friends who once lived there, and recalling times of riding bikes, playing football, and being a care-free kid. A mix of anger and sadness began to creep over me, nostalgia, fear, and hate all bottled up into one. A tear came down my face before I quickly wiped it off, trying to hold steadfast in what I was there for.

I arrived at my old house. It looked different, repainted, with new siding and shutters. The old concrete driveway was now asphalt, and if it hadn’t of been for the house number, I would’ve almost questioned whether it was the right house. I didn’t bother knocking, it didn’t matter who lived there, if it were my parents, or strangers. I wasn’t here for that. I walked through the side yard of the house, gripping tight onto my backpack, and entered the woods through the backyard.

I stepped into the woods, for the first time since that afternoon, so many years ago. I walked some ways, looking left and right, and located that old, familiar trail. What was once a clear dirt trail, was now overgrown. Grass, thicket, and fallen trees now covered the trail. If I did not have the trail memorized, it would’ve been hard to follow. It was almost sad, seeing the trail in such a state. Memories of afternoons riding back and forth washed over me, and I almost remembered that feeling of happiness for a moment, when my memory took a turn, bringing me back to the horrible, hideous face of the thing from the clearing.

I walked along the trail for around 30 minutes toward the direction of where the intersection to that cursed trail was. The way to the intersection took much longer on foot than it had all those years ago on my dirt bike. As I got closer to the spot, I saw through the trees and the brush, something in the distance, something that didn’t match the rest of the forest, something bright, lime green.

Approaching it closer, I recognized it immediately. It was my dirt bike. Kawasaki lime green. “What the…” I whispered to myself. The bike looked exactly as the day I had left it, not even a single spot of rust or look of abandonment. It was as if it had just been frozen in time. The yellow rope that had once been tangled in my chain and sprocket was now gone, and the bike looked as ready to ride as ever.

The bike sat right at the T intersection in the trail. For a moment, I couldn’t believe the trail was actually there. Looking down the trail, it still looked flawless. The dirt was clear, and unlike my old trail, not overgrown or changed in any way. The two trails contrasted each other, one old, overgrown, one clear, clean. I knew if I got on my dirt bike, despite it being seemingly impossible, it would start up for me. I knew it was an invitation, that the thing knew I was coming. I decided to leave the bike there, having no desire to do what that thing wanted me to do. I started down the trail on foot.

I walked down the trail, looking back as my dirt bike got farther and farther away. The farther I got down the trail, the less sound the forest made. The sound of the breeze flowing through the leaves, squirrels darting through trees, and insects and birds chirping, all began to fade away. Only the sound of my footsteps against the dirt and my own breathing remained. My head was on a swivel, fully expecting that thing to jump out at any moment. But.. nothing. I felt nothing, no feeling of dread, no bad smell, and no feeling of anything watching me. The woods were quiet, and, by all accounts, I was alone.

As I approached the clearing, I stopped, and took my backpack off. Kneeling down, I unzipped it, looking inside at my can of lighter fluid, matches, and my knife. I pulled out the large bowie knife I had purchased at a pawn shop in Atlanta for $10. It was a bit dull, and the handle was a bit wobbly, but it was the best I could do. I clutched it tightly in my hand as I stepped into the clearing. Looking around, I prepared myself for a fight. But again, nothing, I was just.. alone.

Getting frustrated, I yelled out, trying to sound as intimating as I could. “Come on mother fucker, I know you’re here, I’m not a kid anymore, come out!” Silence. I began to question my sanity. The sight of myself was ridiculous. An adult, crappy job, crappy apartment, no relationships, no money, wearing old clothes, clutching a shitty dull blade, yelling at nothing in the middle of the forest. My confidence began to fade, my arms began to drop. I stood up straight, coming to the realization that maybe I really was just crazy, maybe everything that happened to me really was just in my head. I saw only trees in the clearing, no burned tree, no monster.

My eyes welled up with tears, a feeling of relief and realization finally hitting me. It was time to go back, to finally get help for my obvious delusions. I dropped the knife, and turned around to head back up the trail, ready to finally put this behind me.

I turned around. Behind me, standing only a foot in front of my face, were dark, black, hateful eyes. It stared at me, unmoving, a look of pure malice and satisfaction in its face. Its charred, black, terrible face. Before I could move, before I could scream, before I could even think, it grabbed me by neck, driving me back against a tree. It showed its teeth, black, ancient, sharp, a mix of a smile and a scowl. The familiar stench of death and decay surrounded me, and it let out that familiar whispered scream.

I clawed at its hand, trying desperately to free myself. Tears were rolling down my face, and I struggled to get in a single breath. Its body was dry, hot, and I felt as though my knuckles were burned every time I tried to punch at it. Ember and ash came off his body every time I hit it. He only smiled bigger, driving me down to the ground, scraping my back against the tree. The tree began to grow hot against my back, turning back into the black, burned tree of my memories.

I heard a cracking sound, as if its body was breaking and taking on a new shape. Its body rippled, contorted, releasing fumes of rotted meat with every crack. Its fingers began to grow, longer, longer, sharper, looking almost antler-like. My eyes grew wide, terrified of what was to come next. It seemed to sense my terror, feeding off it, pleasuring itself from it. It drove its newly grown claws into my ribs. A burning sensation of pain like I had never felt before surged through my body. I let out a primal scream, and in that moment wanted nothing more than the relief of death.

It felt its claws inside me, tearing through my insides, when, suddenly, the pain disappeared. Its grip loosened, and I began to slowly open my eyes. I breathed deeply, catching my breath, recovering from the painful horror I had just experienced. The thing stepped back a few feet, giving me space, allowing me to stand up. I looked over myself, expecting to see blood, but, I was fine. Now that I had a moment to process what I was seeing, I examined the thing in its entirety. Black, decayed, its skin seemed to flake and peel. It had black sores all over its body, and patches of black oily hair on its head and body. Its eyes were black, with a predatory glow. It stood only at about 5’5, but it looked strong, fast. Its smile was gone, and instead just stared at me, mouth half open, like it was just… waiting.

I stared back at it, when I suddenly began to feel.. something. That thing, whatever it had took all those years ago, in that moment, it had given it back. My soul, my being, whatever you want to call it, I had it back. Suddenly, ever feeling, every emotion, every heartbreak, everything longing or feeling of love, everything that I ever would have felt in my life, all caught up and hit me at once. I collapsed on my knees, crying, half laughing, half sobbing. In that moment, I finally felt like me again.

I opened my eyes to find the thing still standing there, staring at me, mouth open. I didn’t understand, I was trying to comprehend why it had given it back, why it had restored me. For a moment, we just stared at each other. The side of its mouth began to twitch, a smile growing on its face. Its eyes changed, stopped glowing, growing darker. Its mouth began to salivate, and drool ran down its chin, like a wolf about to eat its kill. I understood then what it was doing. It had given that piece of myself back to me, only for the pleasure of taking it again. It wanted to give me hope, only to have the ultimate prize of again ripping it away, this time worse. It wanted to feed off my emotion and my fear. It didn’t just want to kill me, it wanted everything from me this time, my body, and my soul. It wanted me to suffer for having the audacity to come back and think that I could stand up to it.

I wasted no time to run. Down the trail, I ran as fast as I could. I looked back to see the thing gone, out of sight. I stopped then, knowing full well I wouldn’t outrun it, and I went back to the clearing. The answer had to be in this clearing. What did the tree mean? What did my dreams mean as a child? I looked around, knowing my time was limited. I picked up the old bowie knife, and I walked in circles around the burned tree. I was looking for anything that could provide me something, when I spotted a small, hand-sized stone sitting behind the tree, at its base. Tiny symbols had been carved into the stone along with a single world, “Lakota”.

I heard a rustling from the branches above me. I looked up, and I saw it. In the tree, kneeling, balancing on a branch like a cat. It lunged down, a blur of feral rage and supernatural speed. It drove me to my back. Its feet were on stomach, hands on my chest, and it knelt, its face only a few inches from mine. I felt as if I could hear the screams of 1,000 people in its mouth, when it spoke to me for the first time. Its voice sounded harsh, whispered, like it was coming from the vocal cords of something long dead. “Unkičize yelo”, is all its said. Its mouth began to water, body began to crack, when I yelled, “LAKOTA!” as loud as I could manage. It stopped, looking at me, eyes growing wide, a look of pure hate and realization. It began to breath heavily, it was furious. I stood, and it began to back away. Its look of hate turned to something else.. was it... fear? I knew then that I had done something right. I began to slowly advance toward it, again I yelled, “Lakota!” and it began to retreat backward further from me. I lunged, driving the blade of my knife deep into its chest.

It fell on its back howling in agony as the blade found its mark, searing through its black flesh and bone with a satisfying finality. It thrashed and writhed, its unearthly cries echoing through the woods. I pressed my advantage, stabbing it again and again, its body crunching, chunks of its black ashy flesh falling off with every penetration of the blade. The stench of the inside of its body was nearly unbearable, causing me to gag, but I kept stabbing. It finally stopped moving, stopped breathing, its predatory glow finally leaving its eyes.

I looked around the forest, a feeling of skeptical relief washing over me. I went and retrieved the lighter fluid. I poured it all over the now mangled body, all over the clearing, and all over that cursed tree. I lit it on fire, and turned down the trail to leave.

The trail was gone now, only thick woods stood in front of me. The flames grew bigger behind me, and I walked in the direction of that old familiar trail. On my way back, I came across my old Kawasaki, now on its side, yellow rope tangled in the rear wheel. Brush and moss had long taken it over, and the motor was covered in rust. “Goodbye old buddy”, I said, and headed out of those woods for the last time.
