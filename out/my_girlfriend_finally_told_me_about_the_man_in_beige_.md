My girlfriend, Natalie, always told me that her aunt was a medium. I always found it amusing, made jokes, and moved on, but Natalie spoke of it with a weight in her voice. She spent much of her childhood at her aunt’s house since her father died early, and her mother spiraled into alcoholism. It was there that she found a semblance of family normality, and her aunt, who had never had children, treated her like one.

As Natalie grew older, her aunt began sharing more details of her paranormal adventures. One night, a spirit had dragged her from her bed to the living room; on another occasion, a spirit had shouted "goal" 15 minutes before the actual goal was scored. The stories walked a fine line between frightening and absurd in equal measure. I always got a kick out of them since I’ve always been a fan of horror films. I never believed in them, but they entertained me. That is, until I finally heard the most famous story of her aunt's spiritual encounters.

I knew there was one story in particular that everyone in the family avoided, and after much insistence, Natalie finally told me about the man in beige.

It was her aunt’s first major mediumistic apparition. She was 12 years old and had already seen spirits at school. She had never been afraid of them, not even as a child. They were just regular people, she said, but appeared as shadows, seeming more lost than threatening. The man in beige appeared to her one morning. She simply woke up, and there he was, sitting at the edge of her bed—and she immediately knew he was not alive. 

He was a tall, colorless figure with gentle, calm eyes. His shirt was elegant, beige with a few vertical white stripes. He seemed to be watching over her, repeating this ritual every morning. For two years, she would wake up to find the man there, quietly observing her, before disappearing after 10 to 15 minutes. During this time, she grew accustomed to him and occasionally tried talking to the man, who listened silently. The pattern remained the same for the period, until one cold winter morning, when the man whispered something in her ear and vanished—never to return again.

According to her aunt, she couldn’t remember what was whispered. She eventually missed the sense of security the man provided her during childhood. She dreamed of seeing him again throughout her remaining adolescence and early adulthood, when she moved to another city to escape the unfolding family conflicts with Natalie’s mom and grandmother. 

She didn’t return to her hometown for five long years, knowing about Natalie’s birth only through letters. Eventually, she returned for good when something significant happened. Natalie’s father had died in a car accident, and her sister needed her. It was at the funeral that the two sisters reunited after their long estrangement. They shared a heavy embrace, forgave each other, and cried.

It was there that her aunt first saw Natalie - 3 years old at the time - with whom she would go on to have a strong bond. As she approached the coffin, she saw her brother-in-law for the first and last time. He had a gentle, calm face and was dressed in a very familiar beige shirt with white stripes.
