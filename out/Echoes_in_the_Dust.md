Fallujah, Iraq — 2004.  
We were trained to expect the worst.  
IEDs. Snipers. Ambushes.  
But no one prepared us for *this*.

Our unit was stationed near the outskirts, in a bombed-out school turned command post. The walls were scorched, the windows shattered, and the air always smelled like copper and rot. Locals avoided the area. Called it *Bab al-Raml*—“The Gate of Sand.” They said it was cursed. We laughed. We were soldiers. We didn’t believe in curses.

Until Sergeant Mallory started losing time.

He’d zone out mid-sentence, eyes glassy, like he was watching something behind you. Then he’d snap back, drenched in sweat, whispering, *“It’s coming.”* We thought it was stress. PTSD. Everyone was fraying at the edges.

Then he started drawing.

Not doodles. *Maps.* Symbols. A figure—tall, faceless, limbs too long, standing in the middle of concentric circles. He called it *“The Dustwalker.”* Said it lived in the silence between gunfire. Said it fed on memory.

We found Mallory’s gear neatly stacked one morning. His boots, his rifle, his tags. No blood. No tracks. Just a trail of sand leading out into the desert. Sand that hadn’t been there the night before.

We searched. Nothing. No body. No signs. Just heat and silence.

That night, the dreams began.

I saw my brother—killed in a car crash when I was seventeen—standing in the rubble. He didn’t speak. Just stared. Behind him, something moved. A shape. Tall. Wrong. Like it was stitched together from bone and smoke. I woke up screaming, heart pounding like I’d run a marathon.

Private Hensley stopped sleeping. Said he saw a child during patrol. A little girl with no eyes. Just sockets filled with dust. She’d follow him. Point at him. Every night. Until he started bleeding from his nose and ears. They evac’d him. Said it was heatstroke.

Lieutenant Griggs locked himself in the Humvee and refused to come out. He was crying. *Crying.* A man who’d survived two tours. He kept saying, *“It’s in my head. It’s showing me things I never told anyone.”* They sedated him. Sent him home.

But we knew.  
We all knew.  
Something was out there.

It didn’t attack.  
It *invaded*.

It found the cracks in your mind and poured itself in. It showed you things you buried deep—regrets, guilt, faces you tried to forget. It didn’t kill you. It made you *watch*.

I saw it once.  
And I wish I hadn’t.

We were clearing a collapsed building. I turned a corner and there it was.  
Tall.  
Faceless.  
Its body shifting like smoke and bone, eyes like burning coals buried in sand.

It didn’t move.  
Didn’t speak.  
But I felt it.  
Like a scream inside my skull.

Suddenly I was back home, watching my mother die in a hospital bed. Then I was in boot camp, watching a kid get hazed until he broke. Then I was in Fallujah again, watching civilians scream as a building collapsed.  
All at once.  
All *real*.  
All *now*.

And then I heard it.

Not aloud.  
Inside me.  
Like a thought that wasn’t mine.



**“I do not hunt the living. I wait for the broken.”**



I blacked out.

Woke up in Germany. They said I collapsed from dehydration. Diagnosed me with PTSD. Night terrors. Dissociation. But I know what I saw.

The Dustwalker isn’t a monster.  
It’s the war itself.  
It’s the guilt.  
The memories.  
The things we bury but never forget.

And once you’ve seen it, it never leaves.
