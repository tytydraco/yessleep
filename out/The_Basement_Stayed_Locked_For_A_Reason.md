I never noticed the door until last Sunday. I’ve lived in this current house for the last three years and I just now noticed a door that leads to a basement I don’t even know was under me. Although when I noticed the door and went to peak behind it, the damn thing was locked.

It took me about six days and thirty seven keys later but I finally got it opened. I swung it open as if I thought there was going to be treasure or something in a small room, a normal set of stairs is what the reality of the situation was. It took me a moment to muster up the courage to take the first step down: 

About three steps down the rickety old wooden plank set of stairs a light string smacked me in the forehead causing a slight panic, heart racing and wondering what the hell just smacked me I reached for a beaded metal string and tugged. A light from the middle of a concrete room lit everything around it including the bottom set of steps.

About three fourths of the way down I noticed a smell of rot, plugging my nose and taking a moment of manual breathing I decided to move forward. I’ve never ran faster in my life, when I reached the bottom step I picked my head up from staring at my feet to a room. The room can only be described as, terrifying. A bucket, the first thing I noticed in this room, a dark sludge covered the rim of the buckets, little streams running down the side of the Lowe’s bucket caused to it being full to the brim on what I could only guess to be because it was being used as a bathroom. 

The rest of the room was hard to make out at first due to the light flickering on and off. The second thing I noticed were the chains nailed into the far wall, a rust cover the nails which indicates they have been there for a while. The strange thing that caught my eye was what seemed to be fresh red liquid dripping off cuffs connected at the ends of the old chain. 

I ran out of that basement and out of my house to my grandmas house down the street rather than you could sing twinkle twinkle little spider, she was surprised yet worried when I slammed through her porch door. Later that night while I ate an apple pie she made to calm me down when I came stressed to her about anything, a comfort of sort. 

The next morning I noticed the cop cars still sitting outside of my house, after breakfast that’s when the detective came knocking asking me for what I saw or knew. Turned out my mother’s younger brother has mental issues and a lust for hurting people for a while now, a while meaning the last three years. 

I tore my family apart with this discovery, I suppose the basement stayed locked for a reason, I wish I respected its motion for a classic sign of stay out unless given access. The strange thing about all of this is my uncle hasn’t come around sense the police were here yet they swing by asking every once and a while asking if we know of an updated location he is or was at. 

I haven’t said anything but around two in the morning I can hear a faint sound of chain rattles coming from outside my window in the back yard. I can’t help but think it’s him back, doing what he can’t control. I don’t want to tell police so I wanted to post this hear to have someone hear me, I have to tell someone don’t I?
