I’ve tried to leave my office three times already. Every time I grip the handle, I’m unable to twist it down and pull open the door. I’m scared of what I might invite in. 

Scattered around the wheels of my desk chair are scraps of off-white paper. After performing the Rorschach Test on the little girl, I couldn’t bear the sight of the inkblots. Inkblots that supposedly bear no meaning suddenly looked like all of the things the girl had described to me. Pig heads. Animal skins. Body parts. And that wasn’t even the worst of it. The girl had discerned details about me that she shouldn’t know. *Couldn’t* know.

For those who aren’t aware, the Rorschach Test is an exercise we psychologists use to better understand how our patients perceive the world around them, and how the lens of trauma may be warping the vision of their mind’s eye. There are twelve cards, with each one depicting a different symmetrical image. These cards are presented to the patient one by one, in order, with the patient being asked what they see.

I remember performing a Rorschach on a soldier recently returned from active service in Afghanistan who had developed recurring nightmares.

“What do you see?” I asked after sliding the first card in front of him. His tightly drawn mouth dropped open. Pinched, defensive eyes opened wide. His breathing accelerated. Beads of sweat appeared on his temples. 

“My buddy, Brian. When the smoke cleared, that’s what he looked like. God! I could see the dirt of the road right through those holes in his stomach. And those are his entrails! Oh, God!”

It’s worth noting that upon seeing the first card in the Rorschach Test, common, healthy responses are: “Oh, that’s a moth,” or “That’s a pretty little butterfly.” Come to think of it, the little girl had started off along those lines this afternoon. Except she was most definitely suffering from a disturbance of some kind. That became all too clear as we progressed through the cards.

Her name was the final one on my list, and I felt a wave of relief rush through me as I put a tick next to it and walked out into the waiting room. The day was almost over.

“Annabella?” I called.

A girl was laid on her front, scribbling a series of grey lines onto a notepad, but she didn’t stir at the sound of her name. Though her mother and grandmother did. They leapt to their feet and gathered their belongings before corralling Annabella towards me. Some tears were shed, but the tantrum wasn’t anything out of the ordinary for an eight-year-old being dragged from pillar to post in an unfamiliar place. 

I showed the trio into my office and confirmed the details of Annabella’s referral. Sudden emotional withdrawal. Bouts of unresponsiveness. Extreme lethargy. Blood tests had come back fine. Brain scan was normal. The conclusion was that the change in her behaviour must be psychological. Annabella’s mother and grandmother nodded along, paying rapt attention to my every microexpression. Annabella herself sat on her mother’s lap, continuing to scrape dark lines onto a page. I saw a pack of coloured pencils poking out of her mother’s handbag, but it seemed she was content with a plain graphite one.

“To better understand how Annabella reasons and thinks, I’d like for her to complete a Rorschach Test. You don’t have to leave her–because I appreciate that may be uncomfortable for you–but it would be best from a clinical perspective if I supervise her alone. This way, I can be totally sure that her answers are coming from an authentic place. Children are very suggestible, you see, and the conclusions I will be able to draw may not be as scientifically valid if Annabella is looking over at both of you every time I ask her a question.”

To my surprise, the two ladies were quick to agree with my suggestion. If the roles were reversed and I was bringing my daughter for a psychiatric review, I don’t think I’d be as quick to let her out of my sight. I sighed as I held the door open for Annabella’s mother and grandmother. I supposed they had reached a point of utter desperation in their attempts to restore the girl to her previous self. They reassured Annabella, telling her they’d be just outside, and made their way out into the waiting room. Terse smiles exchanged, I stepped back into my office, allowing the door to swing softly closed. 

“So, Annabella. How about we play a game?” I asked. 

No response.

She was hunched over her notepad with her back to me. Instead of persisting in trying to get her attention, I walked around to my office chair and wheeled it to a position slightly behind and to the side of her. This seating arrangement was deliberate and employed for the same reasons I had given to Annabella’s family. I didn’t want to inadvertently influence her responses. I reached across my desk and pulled a folder towards me. Withdrawing the first Rorschach card, I placed it carefully on the desk in front of her.

“Annabella, look at this and tell me what you see,” I said, softening and deepening my tone of voice.

Her eyes flicked up to the card and back to her notepad.

“Bat,” she said. It was the first time I’d heard her speak.

“Very good,” I said, and replaced the first card with the second one, anxious that if I wasn’t quick enough, then I might lose my momentum with her.

“And this one?”

Annabella glanced at this card for a split second longer, her brows almost twitching together, before she went back to her scribbling.

“Blood,” she said.

I felt my jaw unclench as Annabella’s focus drifted again. The second card in the Rorschach Test is the first to contain colour, and this so-called ‘colour shock’ can induce strong emotional reactions in some subjects. Thankfully, Annabella was unfazed, but it did occur to me that while her answer was a common one in general, it was peculiar for an eight-year-old child to think of blood. I moved on to the third card.

“Same.”

“Same as the one before?”

She nodded at me.

“Blood?”

She nodded again.

“What about this one?”

I placed the fourth card in front of her and watched as she uncoiled from the chair to plant her palms on either side of the image. Her tongue escaped her lips, and she started humming a vague tune.

“It’s the pig man’s face. He’s always sitting underneath the slide in the play park.”

“A pig?”

“Not exactly. He’s got the body of a man, but he has a pig head. He wears a blue suit and his tie has little yellow teddy bears on it. Those are his floppy ears, and look! His long snuffly snout!”

Annabella stroked her finger along two drooping splotches of ink and the central trunk of the image as she spoke.

“A man with a pig’s head?” I asked uncertainly.

“He doesn’t have eyes,” Annabella said, as if that explained everything.

Alarm bells rang silently in my head at her bizarre words. Could this be an abuser? A sick, masked man grooming children in a play park? I made a note and moved on. I’d got her talking now, so I pressed on to see what else she might reveal. Perhaps the man with the pig’s head and teddy bear tie was simply an invention. A character in a weird dream.

Her eyes followed card number four all the way into the folder, and she even waved it goodbye. For cards five, six and seven, her answers were largely the same. 

“Skins. Those are the skins he wears.”

“The man under the slide?”

“Yes. He changes his skin sometimes.”

“Changes it to what?”

“Oh, whatever he likes. Animals. Birds. Slugs. Lizards,” she said, giggling. 

Card eight brings a change of pace to the test, with bright colours making a return. It can also brighten the mood of the exchanges between the person conducting the test and the subject after so much monochrome. I hoped for Annabella’s sake that she started to intuit some more conventional things from the remaining cards. Otherwise, my report on her was going to be dour both to read and to write. 

Upon seeing the card, Annabella said nothing. She stared at it for a considerable amount of time before turning to me. With her index finger, she drew a line across her neck just beneath the chin, and another one across her midriff.

“What do you mean by that, Annabella?” I asked as her eyes blazed into mine. After a moment, she looked away. I moved on to the next card, and this time she drew the first line across her midriff. The second line she drew was across her thighs.

“I don’t understand,” I said.

“Parts of bodies,” Annabella whispered. 

A silence fell as I digested what she’d said. I battled to keep my expression neutral because there was still one more card. I’d upheld the validity of the test to that point, and I didn’t want to ruin it now. The last card of the Rorschach Test is the busiest–a vibrant array of colours and shapes. Most people see a thriving ocean scene full of sea creatures. That was not what Annabella saw. 

“Last card now, Annabella. You’ve done so great. Now, tell me what you see here.”

Her gaze flitted between the card and me, and she smiled awkwardly. It was almost a guffaw. Her cheeks flushed, and she wriggled on the seat of her chair. 

“These are all the pieces of your life that the pig man told me about.”

“The pig man knows about me?”

Annabella nodded emphatically. “He’s very clever,” she said. 

“What does he know about me?” I asked, and Annabella proceeded to spew out sensitive information. My first, middle and last names. My mobile number. My home address. My wife’s name. The names of my three daughters. The town I was born in. My bank details.

She knew about my peanut allergy, and that double pepperoni is my favourite pizza topping. She knew about my holiday to Chile in the spring to visit some Andean vineyards I’d read about in Decanter Magazine. She knew the chalk I polished the tips of my pool cues with was lime green. 

“H-how?”

“The pig man told me. I can ask him how he knows all this stuff the next time I see him.”

“No. You don’t need to do that,” I said, quickly packing away my folder and staggering to the door. 

I told Annabella’s mother and grandmother that the girl was being bullied at the park she played at, and that they should avoid it in future. Annabella skipped away, holding her mother’s hand, and I retreated back into my office. I’m usually five minutes behind my final client, but as I said before, I daren’t leave. There’s a man with a pig’s head and a teddy bear tie who knows everything about me and can apparently change his appearance at will. I know I can’t stay here forever, but at least in this room I can be confident that I’m alone.

Although, what’s to say he can’t shapeshift into a spider or an ant? What if he’s watching me from beneath the skirting board right now? What if he’s been watching me for days? Weeks? Months? How else could he have passed on all that information about me to Annabella? Does he mean me harm? Annabella’s words keep coming back to me.

*Blood.*

*Skins.*

*Parts of bodies.*

I think I’ll stay here for a little while longer. Just a little while. And then I’ll walk out to my car. 

Yes. 

But not yet. 

Not just yet.
