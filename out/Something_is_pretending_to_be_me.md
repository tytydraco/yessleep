Hey everyone, I need some help. I’m currently at a loss of what to do here. Something happened to me and my girlfriend last night and it’s just gotten more complicated since.

I should start with a few quick details. My girlfriend and I live together in a small house. Without going into specifics about our location, I’ll just say we live in a decently populated college town that’s not too far down the road from a major city. We’re not living in some desolate cabin in the woods or an old Victorian mansion - so that’s why this has especially caught us by surprise.

Last night, I came home from work. Nothing unordinary about that. I got inside and was taking off my coat when I sort of noticed the house was really quiet. My girlfriend - who I’ll call June after her birth month - usually has music or youtube going. It was just silent in there. So I walk back into our bedroom and that’s when I find June. She’s jammed herself into the far corner of the room and has tears in her eyes.

“Hey, what’s going on? What’s wrong?” I asked her.

“Don’t come any closer!” she hissed back at me.

I was extremely confused to say the least. I instinctively walk closer to try and comfort her. That’s when June reaches for a trophy on the shelf next to her and points it at me.

“I will cave your skull in! Not another step!”

“Baby, what’s going on? It’s just me!” I pleaded with her.

“No it’s not! You’re not him!”

“What the hell are you talking about?”

My mouth was hanging wide open. I couldn’t believe what was going on. All of this after a nine hour shift was a lot to take in. 

I didn’t understand much of anything at that moment, but I was beginning to gather June wasn’t entirely convinced I was me for some reason. She was clearly petrified of something and the hand she held the trophy in was shaking violently. I didn’t want her to bludgeon me with my own trophy. That’s when I thought to maybe say something that could prove I was me.

“Are you really gonna kill me with *my* tenth grade swimming team participant trophy?” I asked with obnoxious emphasis on each overly specific syllable, hoping that would prove something to her.

I saw June slowly glance at the trophy and read the engraved text facing her which couldn’t be seen from where I stood.

“It’s me, honey. I promise. Why don’t you just set that down and we can talk this over, okay?”

June stared at me for a little while longer before slowly disarming herself. With both arms limp by her side, she just started to sob uncontrollably.

“We have to leave first. Then I’ll try to tell you,” June said through sniffles.

We got out of there quickly, hopping in my car and driving back out into the night. The whole time, I was trying to get answers out of her. She would just sob in response.

I parked in a movie theater lot across town. It was raining out and the theater’s neon lights soaked the surrounding area in a comforting red and gold haze. June’s sobbing had eased up a little and I breathed a deep sigh.

“You’ve got to tell me what’s going on. Like, what happened? Cause right now, my mind’s jumping to the worst places. Like, do we need to call the police? Is the house safe? Did someone break in?” I asked with a firm tone. I needed to understand what was happening. “And why did you point a trophy at me and threaten to cave my skull in?”

“I didn’t know if you were you,” June whispered.

“What the fuck does that mean though?”

“You’re not going to believe me.”

“I seriously doubt that.”

June looked at me with crazed eyes and mascara streaming down her face. “You’re *not* going to believe me.”

“Please just tell me. You have to tell me.”

June tugged at her hair, moaning. Tears were still running effortlessly from her eyes like there was a leak somewhere inside. She looked away from me and out the window.

“I was sitting in bed, just waiting for you to come home. I was just watching some youtube or something. I saw a shadow out of the corner of my eye. I looked and saw something kinda like smoothly coming closer to the bedroom,” June said slowly as if each word could’ve resummoned something.

I wanted to ask her what “smoothly” meant but I didn’t want her to get lost in something so trivial.

“It’s still just a shadow at this point, but it’s definitely real. I see the shadow move closer and closer until it jumps from the floor to the wall and is still coming closer. I didn’t hear any sound at all. I paused my video and called out, asking if you were home. I didn’t hear the front door open though so I knew you couldn’t have been.”

June tried to hide inside herself. It took her a moment to return to what she was saying.

“The shadow kept creeping closer, still no sound. Then, I saw like an actual thing start peeking into the bedroom. I couldn’t make it out. I kept calling out to you, but I knew it wasn’t you. Then it just - it just floated into the bedroom. The entire thing. It floated in there. It looked like you. It had your coat on, your work uniform too. Your pants were even rolled up and I could see the socks you wore today were on it too. White socks with - with red stripes,” June spoke like there were glass shards in her throat.

I couldn’t believe what she was saying. Maybe it was, I don’t know. Maybe it was something wrong with the house, a leak of some kind that made her hallucinate. I don’t know.

June continued, “the face was mangled but I could tell it was supposed to be your face. Your general look but everything was all wrong. Your mouth - its mouth - drooped so low it might’ve been hanging off of its face, but it was smiling, or looked like it was trying to smile at me. The eyes were awful, like overly white cartoonish looking circles with a black hole in the middle. No red veins and no iris. Nothing was detailed. Not the clothes, not the shoes, none of it. Everything was just lacking texture, you know?”

I did not *know.* What she was describing was something impossible. A breakthrough or some kind of proof of the supernatural or something else, but whatever it was is something that would never happen to us. We were nobodies living in a nowhere town. It was impossible. I couldn’t contain my judgemental stare as she spoke. I contemplated her sanity and our future together. I’d have to have her committed somewhere, or we’d just have to break up or something extreme. Because this was extreme and I couldn’t help her if this was a product of her mind warping to some disorder I doubt we could work through.

June continued still, “it just looked at me for a few seconds. It felt like years. I got out of bed and pressed myself against the wall. It was - it was all wrong. One arm was longer than the other, its fingers were stuck out of a circular flesh ball at gross angles. The legs were not being used properly or at all, one of them looked like it had a knot in it. It was just - it was the worst thing I’ve ever seen. After a few seconds, it slowly turned away from me and hovered out of the room. It never made a sound. Like ten seconds later, I heard the front door open and you came in.”

There was a long silence in the car. I couldn’t talk and she had nothing more to say. She returned to crying while my mind tried to contort all of what she had said into a weapon that I could then use against her. It’s all I could think of to preserve reality. I was being a selfish jackass.

“I’m sorry that this happened to you. How have you been doing recently?” I asked, breaking the long silence. To me, what I said was as polite as I could piece together. I had successfully filtered all of the harsher and more abrasive things that were swirling around in my head and spoke something gentle and caring instead. To June, my question to her contained a break in trust. Something jagged hidden behind my kind words that let her know there was a question of her account and of her character.

“What the fuck is that supposed to mean?”

“You know - mentally. Have you been struggling with anything?” I doubled down, because believing her meant there was a cheap copy of me gliding around our house at that moment.

It was an awful couple of hours in that cold car. We yelled at each other and said things that would be hard to take back. There was a divide formed between us. June was convinced she saw something pretending to be me and I had confirmed in my mind she was delusional for it. No longer the June I knew and loved. Yells and pauses and tears and hostility. At the end of it all, the only thing floating around between us was where to go from there. Where do we sleep tonight? We didn’t want to be together, but being alone felt worse somehow. At that moment, every fiber of me thought my girlfriend was crazy - but something in me did *not* want to go back to our house.

The movie theater’s neon lights had long been shut off, and we shivered in the dark together. The silence was a droning chorus of ugly thoughts. I finally turned on the car.

“You can just take me to a motel or something,” June broke the silence.

“Don’t be ridiculous.”

“I will *not* go back there.”

“Relax. We’re not gonna go back. Not tonight.”

I drove us through the silent streets until my eyelids felt like stone. We rested near the town’s college, in some sleepy district where the buildings looked like models. We slept in the car, and something in me was perfectly happy about that.

We were awoken early in the morning by a garbage truck slamming a dumpster down right next to my car. It was still dark.

Me and June sort of looked at each other and our eyes said enough.

“I’m sorry,” I said to her.

“I’m not crazy.”

“Okay. I believe you.”

I felt horrible about all the things I said in our argument. I still didn’t want to fully bend, though. There couldn’t be a crude version of me in our house. That’s just not something that happens. We had to go back home. Our whole life was there. Our cat, our belongings, my keycard for work which was in three hours. I was going in there because I had to prove the other me wasn’t real. Then, we could work on rebuilding. Whatever was wrong with June, we’d work through. We’d overcome it. The morning made me inspired to fix everything - even the things well beyond my control.

When I turned into our neighborhood, June wouldn’t have it. She thrashed around in the car and screamed at me.

“Turn around! Please!”

“Calm down! I’m just going to run in real quick!”

“No. Do not go in there. I won’t let you.”

“It’s gonna be just fine, you’ll see.”

“No! You can’t go back in there.”

We didn’t reach any compromise before the car was idle in front of our house. The house, now soaking in morning sunlight, felt more approachable and safe. June was not as easily disarmed.

“If you go in that house, you’re going to die. I just know it,” June said in a disturbingly calm way.

“I’m going to be okay. There’s nothing to worry about,” I said with deflating confidence. “I-I don’t have any interest in dying, okay? I just need my keycard for work and I’ll feed Larry while I’m at it.”

“If Larry is still there, please just bring him out here. Can you at least do that?”

“Sure. I’ll bring him out here - even if he scratches me to death in the process.”

I smiled softly at June and got out of the car.

I looked up at our house as I climbed our gravel driveway. I was only a few steps from the door when I realized every light in the house had been turned on. The TVs were blaring too, the volume must’ve been cranked to a hundred on the two we had.

Despite the oddness of that, I still didn’t think an entity was inside. More likely, I thought an intruder could be in there. I walked the entire perimeter of our small house a few times, looking in every window which pieced together a near-entire view of the place. I was confident I would’ve seen a person in there unless they were hiding in a closet.

I looped around to the front door and peered in one more time. I saw Larry looking at me on the coffee table. I spotted my keycard right next to him, too. I opened the door and stepped in.

The first thing I noticed was the noise of the TVs. They were unbearably loud, a shrieking infomercial and a distorted political talk show host clashing together into a horrible nausea. I turned the TV in the living room off and gave Larry a few pets before picking him up. I grabbed my key card and was ready to run out. That’s when I smelled something unusual.

It was a strange sort of metallic smell that was heavy in the air. Then Larry freaked out and sliced me open in three different places with his claws. He ran off into another room, keeping low. I inspected the damage he dealt me and went to go catch him.

I figured Larry was hiding in the bedroom and I walked in there. It reeked of the bloody scent in there. I looked under the bed and saw Larry wrapped into a tight ball far out of reach. I tried to call him but he wouldn’t budge. I got on the ground and crawled under the bed where I was able to get an arm around him. He started hissing at me which he never did. I grabbed him regardless. I was starting to regret coming inside.

I wrestled with Larry and eventually got him out from under the bed. That’s when I felt something in the room with me.

Larry scratched me again and even deeper, escaping out of the room and leaving me in there with it.

In the bedroom, floating silently above the bed, was something impossible. I still can’t comprehend it. I still barely believe in myself.

It was some awful imposter. It was pretending to be June. It was specifically June from last night when I came home from work. It looked like a horrific interpretation of her terrified face, its flesh mimicked her clothing crudely, altering its torso with some skin pigmentation to resemble her graphic tee but it did a terrible job of it. It had made little progress in the way of limbs, but the furthest along was a miserable excuse for an arm which held something boxy and golden. I think it was a fleshy parody of my swim team trophy that she threatened me with the night before.

It was the most sinister and disgusting and impossible thing I’ve ever seen. I felt all the color drain from me and I wasted no time getting out of there. It either let me leave or it hadn’t figured a way to trap me yet. It certainly was not convincing me by producing June’s likeness.

I ran down to the car, screaming like a maniac. I couldn’t find Larry again and I left my keycard behind, so my visit was all for nothing. 

June had to spend a few hours calming me down and tending to Larry’s deep slashes he left in my arms and neck. I was reduced to an infant for a while. I was pretty much just shocked at what I had seen, but June made me feel better about it over time. 

I still feel awful, so awful that I doubted her so passionately and that I thought such negative things about her when she was right all along. Now knowing what she had seen, it’s a miracle she didn’t up and leave me when I expressed doubt. I guess it’s impossible to imagine when you’ve never seen such a thing before.

We’ve been parked outside the movie theater all day, I have three missed calls and five long, unread texts from my boss. My arms are throbbing and both of our mental states are deteriorating. We don’t know what to do. We can’t go back there. We will not go back there. If you have any sort of advice or guidance you can offer us, anything would help right now. I know I probably sound like an insane person, but truthfully I’m just scared out of my mind. I’m scared that thing will find us and, if I see it again, it’ll be a more convincing rendition of June.
