 

I can't stand this time of year. The holidays have a way of bringing up memories both good and bad. I Remember finding my first bicycle under the tree all bundled up as if any amount of wrapping paper could hide what lay beneath. I also remember the call from my father informing me that he wouldn’t be able to make it home for Christmas that year. I remember decorating the tree with my wife and the boys. But these days they bring up more painful memories than anything. I can't stand the lights, the way they illuminate the night, uncovering the shroud of darkness. I can’t eat anything with nutmeg in it without violently vomiting. Most of all I can't stand the sound of bells ringing. 

Yesterday I walked past a man in a Santa suit collecting donations for The Salvation Army and I froze as soon as I heard him jingling his bells in my direction. I could feel myself start to sweat despite the frigid winter air blowing around me as a knot grew in the pit of my stomach. I must have looked as bad as I felt because the man stopped his ringing to check if I was okay. If he hadn't I'm almost certain I would have passed out and fallen face-first into the icy pavement. That's when I had made up my mind. As much as I doubt it will provide me with any closure have to tell my story. I just can't keep this bottled up anymore. It wasn’t always this way. I too once found comfort in the glittering lights strung up around the neighbourhood, the smell of freshly cooked gingerbread,  the jingling bells on the street corner. But now I know too much. I’ve seen too much. It all started the year I cancelled Christmas. 

My wife wasn't happy with my decision but the kids were out of control and I was putting my foot down. I mean, the Christmas tree caught fire! No matter how much I interrogated the two boys about who was responsible they just kept saying that Santa Claus did it. I couldn't imagine a lamer excuse. I told them that if they didn't admit what they did that I would be “calling up Santa” and telling him not to come this year but they held their ground. In fact there was little objection at all from them. 

“They must think I’m bluffing” I assumed but I was dead serious. 

So that was it, there would be no Christmas that year despite the pushback from my wife. They had to take responsibility for their actions. And so it happened that when Christmas Eve came it went largely unacknowledged. The boys were surprisingly agreeable. I expected that by the time Christmas came around there would be crying and begging but the day went by without any protest from them. I didn’t think much of it until I went to tuck them into bed and one of them (the younger of the two) asked, 

“Daddy? Santa Claus isn’t coming tonight, is he?” 

“Sorry, bud.” I replied. “Not this year.”

“Good.” He said.

I was obviously taken aback by this. I mean, what child would be okay with Santa skipping their house? Let alone hoping for it to happen? I brought it up to my wife later that night. 

“Maybe Santa Claus really did start the fire.” She said with a wry smile.

“Ha ha, real funny.” I retorted. “Seriously though, I’m a bit worried.”

“Kids are growing up so fast these days.” she said. “Perhaps they’ve already gotten a bit too old for Santa.” 

“Perhaps…” 

I got up from the bed. 

“Where are you going, honey?” My wife asked. 

“I’m going to get myself a drink.” I replied. “Want one?”

She said “No, thank you.”

So I headed downstairs to the kitchen to get myself a rum and eggnog. Just because Christmas was cancelled for the kids didn’t mean I had to give up on my celebration. I wouldn’t get to enjoy said eggnog, however, because as I made my way into the kitchen I noticed something odd. I started to hear a faint ringing in my ear. Like the sound of bells in the distance. It grew louder and louder until it reached a deafening volume. I curled up on the floor with my hands over my ears but the sound seemed as if it was coming from within. Then, suddenly, silence. The faint smell of nutmeg and cinnamon filled the room. I thought I was having a stroke. I got back to my feet but before I could even begin to regain my composure I noticed wisps of white smoke flooding in from the living room. 

“Oh God.” I thought. “It’s happening again.” 

I rushed towards the living room ready to face the fire but nothing could have prepared me for when, instead of flames, I found myself looking into two, enormous, coal-black eyes. They stared back at me, or rather, through me. As if I was too insignificant for consideration. I was frozen in place, as if my feet had sunk into the floor below. A face resembling a stern old man somehow filled around a third of the room. Atop its head were antlers that reached up to the roof. The rest of it was shrouded in the thick smoke that flowed from the thing's mouth, resembling a white beard. My eyes darted around the room as flashing red and green lights would pierce through the veil of smoke. I felt as if I could almost see parts of the thing's body moving but they would recede into the smoke as soon as my eyes met them. I thought I caught brief glimpses of deer hooves, holly branches, and red and white striped tendrils weaving in and out of the smoke. The thing didn’t speak yet I was still somehow able to understand what it was there to tell me.  

“You have been very naughty.”

Then the ringing returned. Its black eyes began to glow a fiery red. The lights grew to a blinding intensity. I closed my eyes and clasped my hands over my ears. I could feel my skull shake from the vibrations. Then, again, silence. When I opened my eyes the thing was gone and in its place, a raging fire filled the living room. I had no time to process everything I had just seen and raced upstairs as fast as I could. I went to the boys’ room first to make sure they were safe but when I went to wake them up I realised my worst fear had come true. They were gone. I called out as loud as I could as I tore the room apart looking for them but they were nowhere to be found. In my frantic attempt to find the children I hadn’t noticed my wife standing in the doorway, spurred by my screaming. 

“Babe, what’s going on?” She asked with a look of concern on her face. 

I had to act fast. I grabbed her by the arm and started pulling her towards the front door. 

“There’s a fire! We need to get out, now!” 

She resisted. 

“What about the boys!?” She screamed.

“They're gone!” I yelled back. “They’re already gone!”

She continued to fight with me as I dragged her, screaming and sobbing, downstairs. Once I had gotten her outside she collapsed on the front lawn, her knees digging into the thick snow, wailing as we both watched our home, the place where we had raised our children together, go up in flames. Soon enough firefighters came and put out the fire. An investigation was held but they couldn’t find the source of the flames and the boys’ bodies were never found. 

I never told anyone what I saw that night, not even my wife. How could I even begin to explain? Our marriage only lasted for a year after that. I think that she secretly believed that I was responsible for what happened though she never said it. I don’t blame her for leaving, in fact, I’m surprised she stayed around for that long. I was emotionally distant all year, unable, or perhaps unwilling, to show the immense grief I felt. It all came pouring out the following Christmas. I would fly off the handle, lashing out at any reminder of the event, and the season is full of reminders. She would try to calm me down but I refused to let her get close. She filed for divorce soon after New Years. I hear she has a new family and is getting remarried in the summer. I’m happy for her. I hope she’s been able to find some kind of closure. I, however, doubt I will ever be able to move on. Every time I think it’s getting better December rolls around again and everything comes rushing back. Occasionally I’ll catch glimpses of it illuminated by the lights of a Christmas tree. I feel like it’s still watching me, still looking through me with its cold indifferent eyes. Now I know the real reason the old song says “He can see you when you’re sleeping, and he knows when you’re awake.”
