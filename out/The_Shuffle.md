My mind stirs in static. Fog. Gray.  
Not just the absence of memory…  
the absence of *well.. me*.  
The dream I was in disintegrates before I can grasp it, like dead ash between my fingers. I don’t know my name. Not right away. I don’t even feel alarmed. Not yet.

A voice calls out, syrup-sweet and distant.  
“Breakfast’s ready, sweetheart. You’ll be late for school.”  
It’s my mother.  
I think.

She stands in the kitchen. Smiling. Always smiling. Wearing the same apron she always does. Making my favorite, eggs, toast, just the right way. Everything is in its place. *Too* in its place.  
But something feels wrong… something *is* wrong…

I blink.  
Once.  
Twice.  
Three times.  
She doesn’t change. Her face doesn’t flicker. Her movements appear normal, precise, perhaps a bit too precise. Like they’ve been practiced. Rehearsed, thousands of times.  
I feel a chill run down my spine.  
*That isn’t her.*  
I don’t know how I know. I just… do.

A pressure builds in my skull, like something trying to force its way out. And then,  
It hits me.  
A memory... no… knowledge... like it was injected directly into my head...

Everyone’s consciousness shuffles. Every 24 hours.  
Memories wiped. Personalities replaced. Beliefs, instincts, identities, all swapped into fresh bodies like hand-me-down clothes. Perfectly tailored to what was there before.  
They don’t know.  
They think they’re still themselves.  
But they aren’t.

Everyone around mem my classmates, my neighbors, my family. They’re someone else now, wearing a mask made of leftover flesh and old smiles.  
Society goes on normally… like nothing happened… Laughter. Commutes. Conversations. Dates. Arguments. Birthdays.  
It all continues.  
Because they believe it.  
Because they don’t remember.

Except me.  
I remember everything.  
I’m the anomaly. The *only* anomaly. I’m not supposed to be here.  
I see through them.  
And something sees through *me*.

It started with a shape. A wrong shape. A silhouette of something tall and narrow, with limbs like sticks snapped at the joints. Skin darker than shadow. A mouth too wide, grinning. Teeth too straight. Too white. Too clean.  
It smiled at me.  
And it hasn’t stopped.

I can feel it now, just beyond the veil of normality, waiting, watching, coiling behind the curtains of reality.  
I don’t sleep anymore.  
And every day is the same.  
Everyone plays their role.  
They smile. They wave. They speak with voices that sound *almost* right.  
But I know.  
I watch.

And then…  
Something changes.  
They start acting wrong even for who they think they are. Not like imposters anymore. Not like people.  
Like puppets whose strings are being pulled by something curious. Something playful.

I lock eyes with a stranger across the hallway.  
They grin.  
*That* grin.  
The one from the thing.

One by one, they begin to turn.  
Their smiles widen.  
Their eyes hollow.  
They stop pretending.  
They surround me. Familiar faces peeled back to show… *it* underneath.

I don’t breathe.  
They do. In perfect rhythm.  
And then they speak.

“You know too much.”

Not voices.  
*Voice.*  
Singular. Unified. Ancient. Rotting.  
It doesn’t echo, it *blooms* inside my skull, wet and pulsing, worming between neurons.  
I scream, but it echoes with me, not against me.

I claw at my face.  
My mouth foams.  
I want to die.  
I am unraveling.

The world bends—my kitchen becomes my classroom becomes my bedroom becomes a cage. A simulation glitching at the seams.  
I see through the walls now. Through skin. Through time.  
My body twitches. Laughs. Sobs. Giggles.  
I feel a thousand hands pressed against my bones from the inside.

Emotions I’ve never had flood in, rage, ecstasy, terror, lust, grief—screaming together in a language of pain.  
My fingernails fall off.  
My gums bleed from smiling.

And then… blackness.  
But…  
Not death.  
Just black.  
I’m still conscious… but I can’t see anything…

And the blackness speaks.  
Whispers, soft… but disturbing:

“Just the beginning. It is just the beginning.”

I see its mouth again.  
That grin.  
I knew…  
I’ll always know.  
Because I’m the only anomaly…  
The only one.  
It’ll be watching. Waiting. Hungry.  
It always will be.

And then…  
I wake up.

My mind stirs in static. Fog. Gray.  
Not just the absence of memory…  
the absence of *well.. me*.  
The dream I was in disintegrates before I can grasp it, like dead ash between my fingers. I don’t know my name. Not right away. I don’t even feel alarmed. Not yet.  
A voice calls out, syrup-sweet and distant.  
“Breakfast’s ready, sweetheart. You’ll be late for school.”  
It’s my mother.

Like always. ;)
