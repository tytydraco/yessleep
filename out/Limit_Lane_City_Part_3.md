Cora and I made our way up the staircase, past the doors and glowing neon signs. I hadn't noticed up until this point, that they weren't connected to anything. A few weeks ago that would probably still have surprised me. 

As we reached the top, there was a gentle breeze swaying through our hair. The fields looked peaceful as every day. We didn't expect to come back to the snowy road between the rundown storefronts anymore. At this point, we were checking the stairs purely out of habit. 

The clouds were so slowly passing by above our heads. We walked a little bit further into the tall grass, away from the staircase entrance. Out here felt like the only place we couldn't be listened to. Of course, this was just our theory. There was no way of knowing. I enjoyed the warmth of the sun on my face. There wasn't any direct sunlight inside the city, except for the courtyard. We wouldn't go there just for sunlight though. 

"Do you think we should go further? Like, not today, but some time?", Cora asked calmly, looking at the distant horizon behind a wall of trees. 
"What about the monster?", I said, joining her gaze. "You got away last time", she replied. 
I turned to face her. 
"That's not like you." 
"I know â€¦ none of this ever was though" she smirked melancholically. 
I wasn't sure what she meant by that. This place made me too dizzy to think straight. 

Somehow the sound of tranquility can be more distracting than the noise of a city. 
"Our ghost hunting thing. I was never a fan of that", she continued after a while. 
I was only slowly processing her words. 
"Even back in school? Why did you join us then?" 
"I liked you. Being your friend was worth some boring midnight trips through the cold." She smiled at me before turning her eyes back to the field. 

I took a quick look around. It had been a while since we checked for monsters. There were none. "I missed you. I missed Marc.", she added. 
"I couldn't say no after so long.", she said as the wind played with her hair. I felt the same. 
"Why didn't you ever reach out?", I asked. 
"Why didn't you?", she replied. I didn't answer. I didn't know the answer.

"We better go and get the food before Marc and Marleen start to worry. They don't know we would take this long." 
Cora turned on her heels and went down the stairs. How long had it really been since I last saw my friends before we ended up here? My memories were a blur. 

I tried to catch up with her before she arrived at the bottom of the staircase. She pulled out a little sheet of paper, the shopping list we kept reusing since the paper at the courtyard ran out. 
"I hope there's still some of that lasagna left. I loved that last time." 
She hopped up the steps onto the courtyard platform. No matter how many times I had already been to this place, it still made me nervous every time. 

Cora sped through the aisles, a little too fast for my liking. We walked past many half empty shelves. Some had even been picked completely dry already. I took some snacks and sweets. They weren't as popular with the people as basic necessities. Cora spent some time searching the area for her beloved lasagna but wasn't successful. 

Since Items weren't sorted by category but grouped together at random, finding what you were searching for wasn't always easy. 
"Guess we gotta stick with ramen again." 
She sighed and took a few boxes. After a quick look at the list we went on our way back. As we were about to cross the threshold, Cora raised her arm to block me. 
"I forgot Marc's soy sauce! Wait here. I'll be right back!" She turned and ran back into the shelf maze. I waited right at the edge of the platform. Only for a moment until I decided, it would be safer not to be too far apart. As I took a step back into the courtyard, I heard the scraping of metal on stone right behind my back. 

The fences. I froze, even held my breath instinctively. Cora came back around a corner and stopped the second she saw the tall chain link fence behind me. It almost looked like she hit an invisible wall. Her face turned from a peaceful smile into a panicked grimace in an instant. The bottle and boxes were falling out of her arms and broke on the floor. 

I stared into her eyes, desperate to tell her to be still. She did the same. We both knew that much. But what about the ballgame? We hadn't had a chance to observe something like it since our first day. We didn't know the rules. We could only mimic what we saw that mother and daughter do months ago, become statues. 

A cold breeze swept over us. At first it only reached my feet, then it chilled my whole body. I saw a few people behind Cora standing motionless, their eyes fixated on a slightly raised platform in the middle of the store. Liquid darkness crashed against it like ocean waves against a cliff face.

He came from behind a shelf and took a small step on top of the stage. The platform looked so small under the massive stature of the creature they called god. He turned slowly from one side to the other, as if to overlook his territory. Cora couldn't see any of it. She was facing the hallway behind the fence. 
"My friends..", he began. 
His voice was quiet and calm but it reached all of us nonetheless. He sounded just the same as he did, standing just centimetres from my ear. As she heard him speak, Cora took a sharp breath. 
"It seems we would once again benefit from our usual deal." 

The way he was towering over everything around him, I could see why the citizens deemed him a god. There was something mesmerising about his appearance. My eyes wandered down again to meet Coras. Her hands were trembling. This wasn't good. I slowly stretched out my free hand towards her. She grabbed it and closed her eyes. Her shivering didn't stop, but now it wasn't noticeable anymore. 
"If there are any volunteers, I would love to hear from you." 
He turned his head towards us. If he had eyes, he would have stared right into my soul. 

I looked down at Cora. Her eyes were still pressed shut. As I raised my head back up again, the god was gone. There was a torturous moment of silence until the first smack. It came from the other side of the courtyard, still far away from us. 

Another one. Rubber on stone. I tried to follow its path with my eyes. This time it was closer. Another smack followed by multiple soft bumps. The ball must have hit a shelf. Coras grip on my hand got tighter. I looked back at her. She was staring upward, at the ledge a few stories above us. I carefully raised my head to see what she saw. 

Marc was crouching over the edge of the third floor. His eyes were wide open, unblinking. He disappeared behind the edge again. Smack. This time I saw the ball fly. It hit a woman's leg, bounced off into another row of shelves. The woman held perfectly still. I noticed Cora's breathing getting quicker. I pressed her hand. She needed to hold up now. The long moments of silence between the hits of the ball were the worst. All we could do was wait. I hadn't seen the god since he disappeared from the platform. 

Suddenly a sound. A barely audible footstep behind me. Cora opened her eyes again. There was someone behind me, behind the fence. She eased her grip on my hand. A tear was rolling down her cheek. 

Another sound from behind me, even more quiet than the last. But that was already enough. Out of the distant darkness, I saw the ball flying towards us. I crushed Coras hand with mine. Her eyes darted back to me as the ball hit between her shoulders. The impact pushed the air out of her lungs in a gasp. She stumbled and landed in my arms, replacing the food that now crushed against the floor, one by one. 

A sharp breath from behind the fence. 

I grabbed her as tight as I could while the air around us was getting colder and colder, darker and darker. Soon enough, we were surrounded by black emptiness. I heard his voice again, right behind my ear. But this time, he actually was that close. 
"There you are" 
I pressed my eyes shut and dug my nails into Coras arms until they weren't anymore. Like a gust of wind she disappeared into the shadow. 

The first thing I heard as the fences sank back into the ground was Marc's shouts. 
"No! Cora! NO!!" He rushed past me. 
I couldn't move, couldn't breathe. My eyes were locked onto my arms. They were empty. Marc ran circles around me, shouting for Cora. He grabbed my shoulders and shook me violently out of my paralysis. Our eyes met and we said nothing. We knew she was gone, but we couldn't accept it. Marc's eyes were so empty, something had died within him. He clawed into my shoulders.  
"I'm going to kill it"
