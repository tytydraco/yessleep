"Are we close?"

The words kicked me out of my half driving and half head in the clouds state, I glanced over at my daughter. She had her arms folded over with her hands obscured in her pockets of the oversized black 'Nirvana' hoodie I had bought her for her birthday. Her short black puffy hair covered most of what I could see but in the midst of it I saw white bluetooth headphones and a Golden piercing of a harp on her left ear, same as the one I had on my right. I sighed and went back to face the road painted over with snow.

"we cant be far now Blair, when we get close enough I'll tell you so you can put on your hat and coat so worry less about the road and more about getting some rest, 'kay?"

She sighed and put her hood up, resting her head on the car seat

"Fine."

She had the same temper as her mother used to have. It was odd not having her mother around to make jokes about my poor navigation skills before kissing me on the cheek and verbally helping out, well, when she wasn't spaced out staring at the tree lines. She always had a habit of staring into nothingness, but she wasn't here anymore. Her two Golden ear piercings divided between her daughter and her husband keeping a little part of her memory alive to carry through life with. Not soon after I spoke to Blair I felt a head hit my shoulder and glanced to my right to see my daughter fully asleep leaning her head onto me, She had bearly slept on the drive up to that point so I was glad to see it and slowly pushed her to her side and stopped the car to get a blanket and a pillow from the booth to make her more comfortable.

I opened the door of the car and was hit with an at first unbearable cold which settled after a few seconds but still remained freezing.

"shit."

I mumbled to myself quietly closing the door and making my way around the car to the booth. After I grabbed the pillow and blanket I shut it and made my way around to Blairs side and opened the door. I moved her car seat a little further back so she had more room to lay down and relax her legs, afterwards I put a blanket over her body and raised her head gently before placing a pillow underneath. I kissed her forehead and closed the door temporarily stopping to take a moment to enjoy the enviroment. Freezing as it was, It was a beautiful sight. An inky pitch black ocean flowing with grey clouds above leaking white snow over head painting every tree and blade of grass it touched a bright white hue which glistened with reflected light which sourced from the headlights of my car. Jen loved it up here, every December we passed through these Woods to get to her parents house with our Daughter to spend the Christmas but this would be the first year we would be visiting without her. While making my way back around I wondered how her parents were taking the passing but just before I opened the door to re-enter my vehicle I stopped dead in my tracks and turned around reacting to a sound.

"hello?"

I shouted to the darkness behind but got no response. I know I heard something close by crunching the snow but maybe it was just an animal or a twig falling. Nothing to get worked up about. So I opened the door, got in, and shut it behind me before starting the car once more and putting my hands on the wheel. Before driving off further I glanced at the outside mirror and was half expecting to see some glowing eyes staring back at me but I was greeted with nothing. Just darkness taunting me with its blanket covering up whatever might've made the noise. I put my foot on the pedal and drove off continuing the trip.

After about two more hours of driving the thought hit me that we should have seen a town by now. Or even lights or some sign of life but the road remained desolate. I reached for my phone on the dash and was relieved that I had signal this far into the Woods. I dialed Blairs grandmother and instantly was greeted with the voice of a happy old woman 

"Hey Paul, You guys almost here?"

"Yeah uh. I should be close by but I think I might be lost, Don there?"

Immediately after asking I heard shouting indicating the man I was questioning about was being called over to the phone. Then I heard Blairs Grand father pick up and greet me the exact same way his wife, Millie, greeted me. Millie and Jen were always two Peas in a pod usually taking Blair to go out and talk while me and Don shared our experiences as hunters of separate fields. I fished, he tracked and hunted stag around the area. So we both had a shared interest in nature and Wildlife which made it quite easy to be friends with one another.

"Don, I think im lost. Could I bother you to drive up and see if you can find us?"

He sighed and thought for a second before responding 

"Any landmarks?"

"I'll check."

I said while putting the phone down and mentally preparing myself for the cold before opening the car door and slowly taking a step out onto the snow covered road. I was shocked with how high the snow was before only going up an inch now going maybe three or four entirely swallowing most of my boots. I didnt see it before but now that I was outside I noticed a sign that looks like it once said the name of a road but now was some unintelligable grey rectangle overgrown with vines and painted in a thick coat of rust. I went back inside the car and picked up the phone. To enlighten Paul on the dissapointingly small find.

"Just a rusty sign covered in vines"

"Okay uh... Whats the last turn you made?"

"I took a left by the sign that leads to 'LinkLeter'. But apart from that I kept going forward"

"You were supposed to go in there then take a left Paul. It leads to an entirely different road. I'll be there but it might take a few hours, so get some rest I'll call you if I cant find you"

I wanted to give the option of driving back myself with the newfound knowledge of where I went wrong but he hung up and I knew how stubborn he was so I wasnt bothered in making a pointless argument that would end the same way. I turned off the head lights of the car while moving the seat back and resting my head while facing Blair. While my eyes adjusted to the darkness I started seeing more and more detail in the blackness behind the window. Tall grass, snow falling, thick trees, and behind one of them fingers..?... Eyes? Two shining gleamy eyes stared at the car window with fingers that seemed to be barely attached to the bone beneath it. staring slightly perched behind the tree. I wanted to scream at it or to call someone but my body wouldn't move. It was locked in motion staring at the figure when suddenly I heard a banging on the drivers side window which obviously startled me badly and I let out a scream only to be comforted with a familiar voice muffled behind the window.

"Easy Tiger, its just me"

I calmed down and rolled the window letting the cold breeze hit my face. It was Don wearing a Brown leather Jacket and a black wooly beanie. He then gave a warm smile and started talking.

"I know you guys usually pack light so how about you put your luggage in my boot and we come back for your car tommorow? Your probably tired and wrecked aint ya?"

I nodded and shook Blair awake who was surprised to see Don but happy to greet him. We then moved our bags into Dons green truck but before getting in after all was moved I glanced over at the tree where I saw the figure but saw nothing there. I opened the car door and entered. Blair was in the back laying down on our luggage like a mattress with the pillow under her head and a blanket covering her. Her own little make shift bed I thought to myself. I was seated beside Don in the front. While he started the engine I locked my car with the button on my keys and rested my head down again before a question hit me that I cant believe I hadn't thought about before hand.

"Don, How did you get here so fast?"

In an almost defensive way he responded 

"What do you mean? You called at seven, its half ten now."

"I only called you about ten or fifteen minutes ago"

After I said that he stared at me dumbfounded and asked in a worried tone.

"Paul. You on somethin?"

I nodded a no and scoffed while thinking to myself that maybe I fell asleep and just didnt realise it. It would explain what I saw outside of Blairs Window. Just a short dream.

"Nevermind, I probably fell asleep."

He sighed and turned the car driving off while I reached for one of my bags under Blair and pulled out a pair of headphones and put them on before plugging them into my phone and turning on November Rain by Guns N' Roses. I then closed my eyes and drifted away.
