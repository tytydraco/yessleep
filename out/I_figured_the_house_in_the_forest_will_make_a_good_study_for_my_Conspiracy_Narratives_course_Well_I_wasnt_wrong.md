We had heard of the house on the 9th lane in the forest. It wasn't an address. It really just meant that it was on the ninth visible street when walking along the forest trail. No one knew how far in. I was about eight or nine when it was a household warning: "do not go near the house in the forest." A lot of media reports - newspapers, news channels, local reports - were published, updating the small town of the Valley of every little new detail. 

The barebones was this: First a family home, the house had four occupants. The father and the kids died in an accident, and the mother then turned the house into a care home for any woman or girl who needed a roof over her head. It became quite a common name. The care home ran peacefully, helping girls and women, for about two decades before it abruptly stopped. By 'stopped' I literally mean *stopped*. Initially there was a lot of confusion about what had happened, but ultimately the police officials said it was a case of carbon monoxide poisoning that killed all twelve of the residents, including the owner. 

But then some said it was a fire, food poisoning, an inside-job, an electric mishap - but the most popular one was the carbon monoxide poisoning. It did not make sense to most of us in the Valley.  The papers said all the residents were buried behind the church, but there are only seven graves there. The owner's is among the ones that are missing. We never got any real answers. But we did not look for any either because it seemed like all the reasonings given were to do with natural or accidental causes. May be the owner's grave is with her husband and children beside the home?

For better or for worse, the home still stands today. I now attend a university across the country. For one of my courses titled 'Conspiracy Narratives', we were asked to do a creative project. I decided to do it on the house on the 9th lane in the forest. I gathered all the news articles by searching for the archives online, the local library helped me with the archives of magazines that don't run today, and I spoke to some residents of town close to my parents' age who were the most cautious of the home in the forest at that time because of their kids. It gave me a good sense of the general idea the normal residents of the Valley had about the house. 

The next task was to visit the house myself, document it, look for some belongings of the last residents, and most importantly, see if I can find something that might go against whatever the media had published then. It did not seem like an easy task. I feared that I will not be able to do it and my research for this assignment will go down in drain. This was mostly because a lot of the official police reports had stated they'd emptied out the building, showing photos of a huge truck with sealed off furniture and other things. I wasn't aiming for a huge reveal honestly; it could have been as small a thing as the ages of the residents, the name of the house, or some factual inconsistency. 

Before that, I had to locate the house. All anyone really knew was that it was on the 9th lane in the forest. I left home at about 6 AM, and it took me 4 hours just to get to the turn of the 9th lane. As I started on the 9th lane, it didn't take long for me to locate the house. It was huge, and its grey and brown structure stood out in the otherwise dull green landscape. But even before I saw it, I could hear some thumps and running footsteps ahead. However when I finally reached the house, there was no one around it. I slowly approached the house, taking out my camera. It had aged - like people do. People become older and weaker, this house had become lighter and weaker. 

The name plate of the house read 'House of Warmth' and below it 'Layla Joyce'. May be Layla Joyce was the owner and she renamed the house to 'Home of Warmth' once she turned it into a care home? The worn gates were open, and the front yard of the home was a part of the forest - save for the tall stone boundaries of the home. It surprised me to see that the home was left all alone and not turned into a capitalistic venture. Surely someone must have tried? I stood at the gates and took a photo right through the middle of the boundary - on the right was the dull green forest, and the left was also the forest, except with benches and tea tables. I walked towards the black door with a scorpion carved into it, and turned the handle. 

It was locked. 

This shocked me. The door itself did not have a built-in lock. It was a latch system. Which means it must have been locked from the inside. And *that* shocked me. I did not think too much of it till I went around the house and realized that this door was the only way one could safely enter and exit (the back door was barricaded by the police for some reason). I spent some time looking at the windows and decided that I will break a small piece of wood from one of them to enter the home. I know I should have been more respectful towards this old house which was probably the place of death for at least twelve people. But I really did not see any other way to enter the house. 

Things turned awfully dark once I stepped foot inside the home. I landed with a heavy mini-jump, unsettling the thick layer of dust on the floor. By *dark* I don't simply mean visually dark - which it was - but also everything just seemed heavier than they should be. I was expecting an empty room, with may be one or two cabinets left on the walls. But the furniture was still there. All of it. *More than* all of it. It looked like I landed in a large area - a room which had a long dining table with chairs on its far-left end, and an elegant brown-gray-with-dust sofa set on the far-right. In the middle was an island-shelf which today may store some light snacks and books perhaps. 

The window I had entered from was next to the dining table. It still had plates on it. Eight sets of them. With a big pot in the middle, as if a banquet that had been waiting for more than a decade was in order. I then realized why it was so *visually* dark. All sources of natural light were boarded with thick plastic sheets. I turned on my high-power flashlight whose brightness blinded me for a second or two. I then properly took in the room I was in. 

The plates had leftovers. Not fresh, but old looking bits that indicated that these plates weren't fresh - they had been eaten off of. The kitchen, on the direct opposite side to where I stood, had dozens of baby-blue cabinets. All of them open, and all of them full of jars and boxes. A little cloth hung from one of their handles, as if to wipe one's hands as one was working in the kitchen. The dining table had eight chairs, only three of them properly tucked into the table. The rest five chairs stood in a disorganized way - as if someone stood up from them and never bothered to tuck them in again. The one chair at the head of the table was the farthest away from the dining table. 

I realized that I had been standing in the same place where I landed from the window. I looked up at the window, the small piece of wood in my hand. There's no way that window is going to open again, I realized. I had jammed it by letting it fall after I pushed it open and broke a piece of its edge. I looked towards the main door and saw that it had indeed been locked from the inside. I was relieved to see a potential way out. 

I walked towards the kitchen, since its cabinets seemed full of things. As I reached the cabinets, I looked towards the dining table and positioned my camera to click a photo before I disturb things further. As the camera flash went off, I noticed the chair at the head of the table. The dust on it had been unsettled recently. It looked like a petite human's print: the arm rest, back rest, ass print - it was a perfect human's figure that could be made from the unsettled dust. My throat was dry, and I was too scared to gulp saliva and make noise. It suddenly felt like I wasn't alone there. It had barely been fifteen minutes since I had stepped inside from that window.

I moved closer to the chairs to try and see if that was the case with every chair. It was only the five disorganized ones that displayed signs of use in the recent past. I looked at the main front door that was locked from inside. What was the possibility that whoever had unsettled the dust on those chairs was still inside? I halted. I stopped moving completely. And I willed myself to listen to the house. Every small movement of mine caused a little creak - it was an old house. I will definitely hear something if there's anyone besides me in the home. I breathed slowly, listening. 

The wind, the leaves outside, my breaths, the leaves, the wind, - and then, a scrape on the floor. It was unmistakable. It was old wood. And when one drags something on old wood, it makes a very distinct sound. It did not come from any where around me though. 

I went towards the sofa arrangement. In the middle of the four sofas was a center table made out of wood and glass. It had small tea cups on it, with a line hinting at the liquid that has evaporated since. I felt relieved when the dust seemed thick and even. I wish I could say the same for the sofas. There were five seating spots where the dust wasn't as thick - where the sofa's cloth pattern emerged. I then found a piece of paper on the single seater sofa. It said:

*I wish this home was enough to care for these little girls and the young women. Who knew this earth's children carried such hatred for some of us? Our husbands, fathers, children were taken away from us by the officers in orange suits. They said it would pay us. They said it was only for a month or two. They said they'd conduct tests that aren't to be spoken of. They said we would not have to worry about being the outsiders after this. Now that our loved ones aren't returned to us, is it not our right to speak for them, of them and bring something akin to justice to them? Out of nowhere my children's and husband's graves appeared on the back yard. Is this the price of wanting security as outsiders?*

This was dated to a year or two before their deaths. This had to be written by Layla Joyce. The owner of the home. I quickly put it back on the sofa and clicked a picture. I placed my backpack on the floor and took out the folder where I'd documented the details of this home in chronological order. In no article, write-up or announcement did it mention anything about men in orange suits. 

I quickly made the connection to the infirmary lab workers from the white lab right outside the town. They now had normal white coats that one would recognize to be of a medical worker's. But before they were 'big', they used to wear orange jumpers. I called the local library and asked if the house on the 9th lane in the forest had ever been discussed in the same breath as the workers from the infirmary lab, the librarian said he'd never heard of it, and that it was an odd connection to make. I did not ask why. I wanted to open more cabinets, drawers, files, books, journals, anything I could find there and read more. What were we missing?

I then heard the same dragging-on-wood sound. This time I located it. It seemed to come from above, but not directly above me. A little farther off perhaps. I looked at the watch and realized that I'd been here for a little over half-an-hour. I turned to look for the stairs when it happened for the first time. 

The inside of the home went bright from artificial light source from outside the home - something being shone through the heavy and thick plastics that covered the windows. I went blind for a second, and stiff - with fear. Once my eyes started adjusting a little to the brightness, I saw flashes of human-like figures near the dining table. It looked like I was looking through flashing images on a screen and not at a physical reality. A big thump came from the main door. 

High-pitched screams of women came from the dining table across me. More thumps on the front door. One. Two. Three. Four. Girl figures ran past me. But so did orange ones from the now open front door. Moving deeper into the house, away from the front door. One stood at the dining table, at the head of it. Ran to the door. Silent gun shots. Screams stopping one by one. 

Then everything went silent. 

When it ended, I was on the floor. Hugging myself tightly. I kept my eyes wide open throughout to explain away the flashes I saw in my vision. But it really was happening. I tried to remain silent for I don't know how long. I tried to put what I'd seen in words, in phrases. I could not. I could not think of anything apart from the men in orange suits that note mentioned. 

I searched the web on my phone for the infirmary lab outside the Valley, and added the year '2007'. There they were. In bright orange jumpers, white shiny borders on pockets, with big white boots. They stood beside big vans in the photos. What had I just seen? I looked at my watch. An hour and half had passed since I entered the home. Everything was silent again. 

I left my camera running on the sofa and went past the kitchen, deeper into the home. On the left side of the hallway was a staircase to the first floor. On the right was a big cabinet with expensive-looking cutlery inside the glass doors. The glass was dirty, but the cutlery was clean. I was almost expecting to see a figure in the reflection on the glass. But I did not. I started up on the staircase slowly. Although the wood beneath my feet creaked, it was strong. When I looked down at the dusty stairs, I saw footprints going up. Small ones and big ones, and bigger ones. Of sock prints and shoe prints. 

I started up, slow but sped up as I kept seeing the footprints. My heart was beating way too fast, and my pant pockets did not have my emergency anxiety medication. When I reached the top of the stairs, I saw a hallway with three doors, presumably to three rooms. Two on the right and one on the left. There was a pair of double-doors at the end of the hallway, with big vases of artificial leaves on either sides of it. On the left side, apart from the door there was also a big wooden storage shelf. It wasn't a bookshelf because it had big box-sized drawers. And some small ones. 

I opened one of the drawers to a small transparent box of what looked like returned letters. The address on all of them was the same: to the infirmary lab. But they were addressed to 'Jon Joyce'. Was Layla's husband taken to the labs? Was she hoping these letters would reach him? I carefully opened the four boxes and looked at all the envelops, without opening any of them. 

Most of them were addressed to Jon Joyce, a couple of them to 'Natalia Joyce' and 'May Joyce'. The ones to Natalia and May all had little blue hearts on them. How long did Layla hope she'd finally get to meet her family again before the graves appeared on her backyard? 

I put the envelopes back and closed the boxes, holding just one letter addressed to all three of them - Jon, Natalia and May - to read. It was the only one which was unsealed. As soon as I closed the last drawer, the hallway went bright again. This time I let out a scream, ran to the end of the shelf and sat down facing the wall. The flashes started again. 

I could hear thumps and banging on the front door below. Screams. Thumps. Footsteps, this time approaching me. I felt them run past. First light, then heavy footsteps. Silent gunshots. Right behind me? Silencing screams. Complete silence. The hallway went dark again. I realized I had my eyes closed shut. I slowly opened my eyes and looked over my shoulder. I was alone in the hallway. The exact same sounds, movement, lights, everything was the same, repeated. 

I opened the drawer, put the unsealed envelope back in the third box as I'd found it and ran to my camera. It had been knocked over on the sofa. I looked at the dining area once again to see if I'd disturbed anything apart from dust and that note that I'd picked up. I readjusted the note to the best of my recollection, ran towards the door. It must have taken me a little over ten minutes to unlatch the door. The longest ten minutes of my life. 

It had probably not been touched since a decade at least. I did not want to break it. The women still lived here. When I finally opened it and stepped out, a light breeze touched my face and I realized my face was wet with tears. I ran out the front gate and sat on the ground, on dry fallen leaves, looking right at the house. It towered over me. But it did not look unwelcoming. Just, sad. It looked sad. I took long breaths. In the distance I could hear machines - trucks, a train whistle, and a flight went over my head with blinking red and green lights. Humanity. I felt so relieved, my breaths steadied.

I reached for my camera from the bag. I wanted to see what it had recorded when it happened for the second time. I had pointed the camera towards the dining table and the kitchen. The video was 44 minutes long. But after about 32 minutes, it was all just static. Not a black screen; just a lot of disturbances, static noises, distortions and then finally a black screen near the end of the video. I watched the video again and again. 

Then it happened again. 

Through the windows, I could see the insides of the house light up. Thumps, the front door moving with each thump. Distant screams. Thumps. Bullets slicing the air. Silence. 

The house was reliving its end again and again. The women were reliving their ends again and again. Layla Joyce was reliving her last attempt at saving those girls and women again and again. The House of Warmth was on a time loop. 

I sat there in silence, in tears, till the next time it happened. I watched it with steady breath. I listened to their last efforts. The sky was starting to get dark and the air had grown cold. The light on the front porch turned on. These five girls and women, along with Layla Joyce, did not have a grave because they are living and dying every day, over and over again. 

I stood up and turned my back to the home. May be I will return if I ever find a way to comfort the residents of the home. Do they even know they're on a time loop, only living their last few moments? Will it do any good to help them, to tell them? Will they do something different if they knew?

\~

I ended up not writing about the house on the 9th lane in the forest for my Conspiracy Narratives assignment. However I am writing this. Hoping it develops into more. Hoping it reaches those who do not know of it. To tell the world of the names who lived in that home on the 9th lane: Layla Joyce, Jon Joyce, Natalia Joyce, May Joyce, Celia, Abi, MarieAnne, Rupa, Ara. And a few more. My search continues.
