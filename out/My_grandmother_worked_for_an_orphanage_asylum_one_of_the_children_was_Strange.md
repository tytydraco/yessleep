It was some time after, before Dr. Small returned to St. Katherine’s Orphanage. The children waited outside every morning for that black vehicle to come rolling down the driveway with it’s strange tall driver and unconventional Doctor. And each morning they returned to their lessons with a lack lustre brought on by disappointment. The first Tuesday in January came and passed, however no silent adoption took place that month. I joked bitterly with myself that even shadow demons took the holiday season off.

On the day of the funeral we dressed all the children in black and took a bus to the chapel. Dr. Small, much to my surprise, met us there. He wore a long black suit that contrasted uniquely against his light hair. His expression was made of stone, he paid no mind at all to me and I paid very little to him. 

In truth I don’t know who told him of the funeral nor could I see any reason he should attend. Sister Helen was the eldest of us. She had passed in her sleep quite naturally and, as far as I was aware, Dr. Small didn’t even know her. However, as Sister Mary wheeled Eric off the bus I understood.

Eric wore an annoyed expression, as always he had wanted to walk, but Sister Mary had insisted he use the chair and was scolding him as she wheeled him along. She didn’t want him falling over during the service. Meanwhile Dr. Small looked surprised to see the boy. I saw the emotions play across his face, astonishment turned to relief. Then his gaze came to rest on me, hatred lived there and I realised he must have thought I had kept news of the boy’s survival from him. 

Admittedly, I hadn’t exactly rushed to tell him. But it was not my fault that the Doctor had shown up, uninvited, to a funeral with the assumption that it was for Eric. I wondered briefly if the man would leave right away. However he stayed and sat silently in the church for the duration of the wake and service. Though I half expected him to spontaneously combust. 

Once it was all over and done with we began loading the children back into the bus. This is when Dr. Small approached me, “The boy survived.” He commented falling into pace with me. 

“Yes.” I answered simply, recalling the morning I had awoken with a start. I had fallen asleep against Eric’s bed during the night and initially I hesitated to check on him. I didn’t want to look up to see his corpse and so I had allowed myself a moment to remain purposefully unaware. I imagined that I could still hear him drawing laboured breaths.. and slowly I came to realise that I *could* hear him still breathing. He was alive. It was a miracle I was sure. 

“You neglected to write that he recovered.” Dr. Small accused. 

“And you neglected to instruct me to do so.” I retorted. 

He smiled at this, a cynical annoyed smile, “I see. In that case, I won’t neglect to inform you that I will be escorting Eric back to St. Kathrine’s in my own personal vehicle today.”

I felt distaste in my gut, “His chair won’t fit in your transport.” I came up with the excuse quickly.

“He won’t need his chair, he will be seated.” Dr. Small responded in finality and so it came to pass that I witnessed the Doctor’s driver lift Eric into the back seat of the car. They drove ahead of us the entire way and I watched the car anxiously. If he chose to do so, Dr. Small could instruct his driver to turn off at any point and I would never see Eric again. 

When we arrived I rushed off the bus while the Doctor helped Eric out the car and into his leg brace. They were still talking as I approached and I overheard some. 

“Why can’t you teach me more right now?” Eric was asking sounding impatient but looking slightly queasy. I wondered if the car had given him travel sickness.  

The Doctor looked amused, “Perhaps tomorrow. You know it takes a toll.” 

“I don’t care, I can handle it. I’m not weak, I’ve proven that..” The boy insisted sounding dejected. 

“We will talk about this another time.” Dr. Small stated more firmly as I reached them. Eric looked as though he were about to protest further when he noticed me, then he seemed to understand. Whatever they were speaking of was a secret I wasn’t supposed to know. 

“Don’t stop on my account.” I assured bitterly. 

“Whatever gave you the impression I would ever do anything on your account?” The Doctor asked bemused, “I simply have to go, other matters to attend.” 

Annoyance washed over me, but I held my tongue. Focusing my efforts on Eric instead, “I don’t need help.” He complained, though not strongly enough to stop me from helping him walk inside as the Doctor departed. Now of course, the moment we were inside I asked if Dr. Small had touched him in any unsavoury way during their time alone. 

“No?” Eric responded with such confusion that I couldn’t help but believed him. I began to feel as though whatever had happened or not happened, I was significantly wrong about what it was. 

“Well, what did you talk about then?” I inquired, utterly thrown by his bewilderment at my question. 

At this Eric paused, it was as if he was deciding what he should say, or what he was allowed to say.

“The Doctor.. was strange.” He admitted, “We sat in silence for a long time before he said anything at all. Then he wanted to know if.. I had seen anything unusual in the house during my sickness.”  

“And *have* you seen anything strange?” I raised and eyebrow. 

“Some strange things.” He said carefully and I wondered briefly if he too had seen the shadow monster. I hoped not. Though I didn’t have the chance to respond before Eric spoke again. “Do you think Dr. Small wants to adopt me?” 

His question surprised me. Truthfully I didn’t know why the doctor showed such interest in Eric but I was fairly sure that wasn’t the reason, “Would you like it if he did adopt you?” I asked instead of answering. 

At this Eric pulled a face, “You can’t answer a question with another question.” He complained. 

“I can do what I like. I’m an adult.” I reminded him indignantly, folding my arms. 

A long moment of silence passed between us as we both refused to back down, before Eric gave in. “I don’t know if I want to be adopted at all. What if my parents come back?” He asked softly.

I felt my heart break a little then. Parents rarely, if ever, came back for the children they had given up. But of course I couldn’t tell him that, “Do you think about them often?”

“Sometimes.. The Doctor asked me about them before. If I remembered them, if I knew where they were..” He murmrured, “Why do you think they left me..?” He asked now, his expression something between anger and hurt. 

“I don’t know Eric.. Perhaps you should go wash up for dinner now.” I tried to soothe him again. 

The boy wheeled himself away with attitude, though it was plain to see the pain he carried with him. I had no doubts that he could remember his parents, he had been with us just shy of a year by then and he was a bright child. However, from then Eric seemed.. Different. He was far more reserved. Often on my night rounds I would find him awake late into the night. He sat staring out of his bedroom window. When I asked what he was doing, he responded that he wasn’t doing anything, that he just couldn’t sleep. 

For days he remained in this state and I struggled to find anything that could cheer him up. I found myself thinking more often about Eric’s parents. Previously I had assumed he was left in our care because his parents had faced some hardship in which they could no longer care for him. However I came to remember that Eric had arrived with a letter.  

At the time, Mother Superior Ruth had been the only one to read it before it was filed away, and now I wondered what exactly it could have said. I knew it would be kept in the office, as this is where all paperwork was filed for each child, and so decided that I would go find it. Perhaps it would shed some light on Eric’s past. 

I waited until nightfall, and then some considerable additional time after that to ensure that all the house was quiet. Once I was confident, I crept downstairs into the office without lighting a lamp. It was a hazardous venture, I stubbed my toe on the bannister in the darkness and nearly gave myself away. Fortunately I managed to keep the pain contained as I continued on. I reached the office door shortly after that. 

It was never locked and the door swung inward silently. It was more effort to close it quietly behind me, than it had been to get it open. The inside of the room was entirely black then and I felt unease settle into my bones. There’s something profoundly uncomfortable about standing alone in an entirely dark space. It feels as though something may be creeping up on you from behind for every second that there is no light. I could hardly stand the sensation and so struck a match to light a candle with some haste. I needed the light anyway if I had any hopes of finding the letter. 

Setting the lamp aside I began to search the shelves for Eric’s intake information. You see, the office was a small room, no more than a desk and bookshelves really, and the bookshelves were where all paper work was filed. None of it was arranged alphabetically, or in any logical way as far as I could discern. In fact, it looked as though someone else before me had rummaged though it searching for something. It must’ve taken me near an hour to find Eric’s file, slim as it was, tucked away among several other near identical looking documents. 

It didn’t take long to read though, it stated the day, time and condition in which he came into care at St. Kathrine, as well as papers pertaining to his medial history. Because of this, the letter was easily noticeable among the other documents. The envelope was unaddressed, water stains has crinkled the paper and it was yellowed with age. The letter itself read as follows: 

*‘This child is my beloved Eric. Eric Linnaeus, that is, born the 21st of April. I beg of you to take him in and care for him well. Find him a good, kind, caring family. It is my deepest regret that I should have to leave him at all, he must always know that he is loved, however he must never be found. If it please you, give him a new name. One that no one will ask after. Burn this letter upon reading it.* 

*Signed,* 

*Bridgett Linnaeus.’*

I finished reading the letter with a certain disappointment. How could any mother claim to love a child she abandoned in the middle of a storm? Besides that point, Eric’s name had not been changed, nor had the letter been burned. Mother Ruth must not have found it to be necessary. Carefully I placed the letter back into Eric’s file and departed the office quietly. 

I had full intentions of disclosing to Eric the nature of the letter initially. However after reading it I feared that he would be just as disappointed as I was by the content and so decided it best to keep it to myself. Looking back now, I do wonder if perhaps Eric was already aware of the letter and what was written in it. It had been found inside the suitcase with his few belongings after all. 

In the days that followed Dr. Small returned to his regular visiting schedule and Eric’s mood continued to decline. He began to fall asleep frequently during his lessons and as a result Sister Beatrice struck him with the back of a ruler so hard that it cut his knuckles. I was shocked to hear of this, and more surprised still to hear of Eric’s reaction. He hadn’t cried as most children would, instead he had glared back unflinching and uttered the words, “If someone has to die so that I can walk again, I’m going to make sure it’s you.” 

This wasn’t the first time Sister Beatrice had used such methods against the children, however, none had returned such malice before. I began to worry that the hatred Dr. Small spread had once again infected my child. For the time that the Doctor had been absent Eric had returned to a sweeter nature. Now that the man visited him daily again, his mood was foul once more and the punishments that Sister Beatrice imposed on him for his outburst didn’t help the situation.

There were many nights that I lay awake thinking about Eric. About his change in behaviour, about the transformation of his nature and about the way in which anger seemed to consume him little by little until there was almost nothing of him left. There are many nights still that I wonder what drove him to what he did. 

Of course I noticed some.. Unpleasantries in his life. The other children teased him, there were occasions were they would steal his brace. Other times were I believe they may have taken control of his chair to wheel him around, but I always found out before any harm came to him. Or perhaps I didn’t. Perhaps Sister Beatrice was too hard on him with her punishments.. I can’t say for sure which specific thing pushed him too far. 

However, what I do know, is that night it happened is one I wish I could forget. A like to many other nights I awoke suddenly from my sleep, I couldn’t say for certain what it was that woke me, but I quickly became aware that smoke filled the air. I could see it swirling in the dim light coming in from outside and the bitter smell of it burned my throat. 

Immediately I began to panic, pulling on my robe I hurried to wake the others. I ran down the hallway shouting as loud as I could for everyone to wake up. I opened every door along the way, urging sleepy children to climb out of their beds and make haste out of the house. 

I hurried to Eric’s room, throwing the door open I found that he was not in bed. The other children in his room were there and starting to wake with varying levels of concern in their expressions. Working as quickly as I could I ushered many children out of that burning house. Each time I ran back in the smoke was thicker, I kept a cloth over my face to keep the smoke out but before long I was gasping for breath. 

Urgently I tried to find Eric, I began to see flames flickering at the far end of the hall. I couldn’t imagine why Eric would be there, but I had it in my mind that he had somehow fallen somewhere and was unable to escape so I continued to search. I wasn’t prepared for when I would find him. 

I reached the last door in the hall, it was Sister Beatrice’s room and the door was slightly ajar. Flames tickled the edges of the frame and the smoke was thick. “Eric? Sister Beatrice?” I called, pushing the door open. The fire danced wildly with the new oxygen and I took in the scene before me in shock. 

Eric stood in Sister Beatrice’s room beside the open window, he was relying heavily on his brace and it looked as though he were planning to jump out. He looked up in surprise when I entered. His clothes and hands were covered in blood, Sister Beatrice’s lifeless body lay on her bed with a kitchen knife plunged into it. It looked as though she had been stabbed several times, and her body was beginning to burn. The smell of burning human flesh is disturbing in an odd way. It smells a lot like any other meat, only you feel strange knowing that the meat is someone you once knew. 

It’s difficult to describe the ways in which your mind tries to stretch all the facts to fit and make sense. I couldn’t quite comprehend what I was seeing. Then I realised something even more strange, no flames touched the boy. They all stopped in a perfectly rounded circle and leant away from him. The floor there was darker, blackened. It was a shadow I realised, a shadow that was repelling the flames. 

In his free hand Eric held a candle and the curtains beside him seemed to be completely burned away. Had he set light to the curtains? Had he stabbed Sister Beatrice to death? I stared at him with as much astonishment on my face as he stared back at me with. 

He looked at me a long moment, his gaze slowly moved across to Sister Beatrice’s body and then down to the candle in his hands before he looked back to me. I could tell he was connecting the same dots I had. I remembered his outburst days earlier, *‘If someone has to die so that I can walk...’* he has said. I wondered if he remembered his statement as well. 

“Sister, I didn’t!- “ He started, his eyes wide with shock, when a support beam from the ceiling gave way. It came crashing down into the room between us in a fantastic spray of sparks and eliminated any hopes I had of reaching him. 

“ERIC!” I called panicked, there was no way for me to get into the room and it was with reluctance that I turned to leave. I had intended to run for help, though I couldn’t imagine who could help me. Part of me knew it was a lost cause, while another part of me hoped still that he would leap from the window. 

I ran outside, the cold air stung in my damaged lungs. My plan at that point was to run to the other side of the home and urge Eric to jump from the window, I would catch him. That’s when the familiar black car came screaming up the drive. It pulled to a stop sending a spray of gravel. To my surprise Dr. Small stepped out of the drivers side and I rushed toward him. 

“Eric, he’s still inside..” I didn’t want to ask this man for help and I didn’t truly get the chance for he ran straight into the building without acknowledging me. I watched as the flames curled away from him just as the did away from Eric as he disappeared into the inferno. 

I waited anxiously with the other sisters and the children, it’s hard work to calm everyone down. In the background we could hear fire sirens approaching though I doubted they would be able to do much. The mansion was by this time completely engulfed in flame. I knew in the pit of my stomach that neither Eric nor Dr. Small would reemerge from such a fire.  

Another portion of the house collapsed and I screamed, there’s an agony in being completely helpless. Knowing someone you love is dead or dying and there’s nothing at all you can do to help. That’s when I saw the flames shimmer and a figure emerge from the fire. 

It was Dr. Small. Behind him loomed an almost translucent shadow. I might not have noticed it at all in the light of the fire if I hadn’t known what it had looked like in darkness. As the man stepped out of the flames and onto scorched earth the shadow dissipated. 

The Doctor had not a mark on him. In his arms he carried Eric. Though the boy was covered in grime and his clothes were slightly singed he did seem to be alive. I don’t know why I had expected that the man would carry Eric back to me. At the time I never considered that he wouldn’t. However, Doctor Small carried Eric to his car instead and placed the boy in the back seat. 

“What are you doing? You can’t take him!” I interjected then, stepping in the Doctor’s way to prevent him from shutting the door on Eric.   
 

“No? You expect that he will stay here?” Dr. Small asked flatly, “St. Kathrine’s is finished and this establishment is released from it’s contractual obligations. Eric is the final child I shall take.” 

His statement caught me off guard, I didn’t fully understand it. I expect Sister Beatrice might have understood better, “You are not going to take him.” I repeated ignoring all else he had said. 

Doctor Small laughed humourlessly, “Stand aside, or there will be two nuns murdered on this night.” 

I stood my ground, through I could tell the man was losing patience. His green eyes seemed to almost glow against the backlight of the burning mansion, and his expression was one of distaste, “You are a fool if you believe I will just allow you to take him.” I reiterated. 

“Tell me, if he stays what fate to you expect for a child accused of murder?” Dr. Small demanded, “Without my assistance, Eric would have burned to nothing. He is mine now. He will be well cared for and he will achieve things greater than you could even hope to imagine. Now. If you would be so kind as to ***move***.” 

I heard the word as an instruction and my body moved aside involuntarily. It was a horrible feeling, as if someone had reached inside me like a puppeteer would a puppet. The shock of it left me breathless and the motion sickness that came after hit hard. I hadn’t before, nor have I ever since, experienced anything like it in all my years.  

It was a magic of sorts I’m sure. Though once I was out of the way, the Doctor closed the car door and moved to the drivers side without saying another word. Then he simply drove away. The black car seemed to melt into the night and vanish mere moments before the firetrucks arrived.  

That was the last time I ever saw Eric Linnaeus and I can’t seem to forget his expression. It was lifeless. He sat perfectly still in that back seat, he made no attempt to escape, and there was no spark to him. No anger, no fear. Nothing. It was like looking into a void. 

I relinquished my faith that day for I saw many things brought on by the work of a devil, and the ‘god’ I worshiped never once helped. I try not to think about Eric anymore, but it’s difficult for me not to wonder what ever became of him. Perhaps when I pass, I will meet with him again and he will be able to tell me… 

*My grandmother passed away shortly after telling me this story. I wish I had had the chance to ask her more about it. She named her first son, my father, Eric so I often think about this story. For now, I think I’ll try to find some more information about ‘Eric Linnaeus’, just for fun.*
