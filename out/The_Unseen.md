In the heart of Gravity Falls, there’s a place that even locals refuse to talk about—a decaying shack near the infamous **Tidepool of Unexplained Horrors**. I’ve lived in Gravity Falls my whole life, and I never believed in the stories, but after what happened to me, I wish I had listened. People say the shack is haunted, that something unnatural lives there—**the Unseen**.

The Unseen isn’t a ghost or monster you’d expect to see in movies. It’s worse. It can bend light, twist sound, and become invisible to the naked eye. Some claim they’ve felt it lurking nearby—an oppressive presence that made their skin crawl. Those foolish enough to get too close hear whispers, and if they stay long enough, they see things—impossible things.

I was one of those fools.

My friends and I, desperate for some summer excitement before school started, decided to check out the shack. We figured the stories were just myths made up to scare kids. Armed with flashlights, we headed into the woods, full of bravado. But as we neared the shack, our confidence wavered.

The air was heavy, the atmosphere unsettling in a way that can’t be explained. The sun had just set, casting long, eerie shadows across the forest floor. The shack loomed ahead of us, ancient and decrepit, as if it were barely holding itself together.

“I’m not sure about this,” my friend Sam muttered, glancing nervously at the shack’s door.

“It’s fine,” I said, trying to sound braver than I felt. “It’s just an old shack.”

I pushed open the door. It groaned like it was warning us to stay away, but we ignored it. Inside, the air was stale, thick with dust and a faint, unpleasant smell. The walls were marked with strange symbols—carved deep into the wood. They looked ancient, like some kind of warning, but I brushed it off as vandalism.

We split up to explore. Jenna, the most curious of us, examined the symbols. “What do you think these mean?” she whispered.

“I don’t know,” I replied, my voice lower than I intended. The atmosphere was getting to me. The deeper we went into the shack, the more oppressive it felt. It wasn’t just the cold—it was the sense that something was watching us.

That’s when I heard it: a soft whisper, like the wind through leaves, but... wrong. “Help me...”

“Did you hear that?” I asked.

“Hear what?” Sam replied, looking around with wide eyes.

The whisper came again, clearer this time. **“Help me…”**

A shiver ran down my spine. “I think we should go.”

Jenna agreed. But before we could leave, I caught something in the corner of my eye—a flicker of movement. I swung my flashlight in the direction, but nothing was there. My heart raced, and I could feel the air grow colder.

That’s when I saw it.

At first, it was just a blur in the shadows, but as I stared, its form started to become clearer. It wasn’t like anything I had ever seen. It was... wrong. Twisted. Its limbs were too long, too thin, and its body was covered in eyes—eyes that stared straight through me.

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. Then Jenna screamed, snapping me out of my trance. We ran. We didn’t stop until we were back on the main road, gasping for breath. The shack looked innocent enough in the moonlight, but we knew better.

“What was that?” Sam panted, glancing nervously back.

“I don’t know,” I admitted, my heart still racing. “But we’re not going back.”

Weeks passed, and we all tried to forget what happened. But the Unseen haunted my thoughts. I learned that others had ventured to the shack and never returned the same. Some claimed it drove them mad. Others refused to talk about it.

One night, I couldn’t take it anymore. I had to go back. I had to face it, or I knew it would haunt me forever. Armed only with a flashlight, I made my way back to the shack. I don’t know what I expected—closure, maybe? But the moment I stepped inside, I knew I had made a mistake.

The whispers were louder now, filling the air around me. **“Help me… join us...”**

I tried to block them out, but they grew louder, more insistent. And then I saw it again—the Unseen. Its eyes locked onto mine, and I knew then that it wasn’t just one entity. It was many—lost souls trapped in that place, bound by something dark and ancient.

I ran. I didn’t stop until I was miles away. I never went back to Gravity Falls. Some places are better left forgotten, and some creatures are best left unseen. But every night, when I close my eyes, I still hear the whispers... **"Join us..."**
