At first glance, my town would seem like an ordinary boring small town but something dark lies in the woods. about three years ago, people started going missing; our population slowly declined. no one seems to notice. It's like they are brainwashed Well everyone besides me I don’t know what singles me out but whatever it was happened at the beginning of last year. Not to long after I became aware I found an abandoned cabin at the edge of town inside was a journal with information about the different info on creatures. I assume the book belonged to someone like me who hunted the creatures. From what I read there are 7 types of creatures. I have encountered one so far It was on my way home from the cabin. it was a bird-like creature with the body of a human its wings looked like that of a vulture its body was pale grey and skinny with its bones visible through its skin its face had a beak like a shoebill its eyes were completely black. It had wings but it just hovered over the road  
  
  
  
. Two days after the encounter I started seeing it more often I started studying the book when I noticed something the other times I hadn’t seen the other two times I had read it. It’s weakness I shouted luckily my parents were out of town the last thing I needed was anyone to find out I was hunting monsters that no one else seemed to notice. The book said that the creature's weakness was brass. “ brass that's it “I said to myself. I ran downstairs and grabbed my keys to my beat-up AMC Javelin. It was a gift from my grandfather on my 16th birthday it was in decent condition when I got it but after two years of driving up and down a gravel road it gained some wear and tear. I arrived at the local 24-hour pawnshop “Looking for anything specific “ the man at the front desk grunted. “Yes “I replied. “I need some brass-cased bullets, “I said. “ anything else “ he grunted. “ No” I replied. “ID,” he said clicking on the cash register. I pulled out my ID and handed it to him he inspected it before handing it back to me “Here you go “ he said.  
  
  
  
I walked out of the store and back to my car. I reached into my center console pulled out the 9mm my father got me for my 18th birthday and loaded it. I drove to the spot where I see the creature most and waited. At about three in the morning, I saw it, I grabbed my gun and fired 5 shots before it retreated I followed it in the woods firing an additional 3 shots. After I had gotten deep into the woods more appeared panic had begun to set in I had only thought there was one I ran firing off my last 4 shots before hiding in an old abandoned car. I can hear them outside. I am writing this as a last resort whatever you do don’t go into the woods in Burnsville North Carolina.
