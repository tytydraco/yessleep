I love the smell of cookies. 



I have not had much time to bake cookies since the baby was born. I used to bake cookies all the time when my husband and I got married. It used to bring me so much joy preparing the dough as the snow fell outside. I used to dream of making cookies for all my kids.

The images of a crowded-family gathering, everybody stuffed from a delicious dinner, used to bring me so much joy. Nobody would be able to eat anymore, until I bring out my delicious cookies. The sense of that joy filling a sleepy room sustained me through the hard times and would help me fall asleep at night.

My husband never liked my cookies. He would always brag about never eating sugar before we were married. When we first started dating, I was too afraid to tell him of my sweet tooth. I was worried he would think us incompatible, but for our first Christmas together,  I baked him my favorite ginger bread cookies and it  changed our relationship forever. He had never tasted something so delicious.

I would bake him cookies all the time then. Even though he would complain about having to buy new pants, he could not resist my delicious cookies; and neither could I. My husband finally gave me the confidence to enter my cookies into our local baking contest. I won first place!

When we found out I was pregnant, we were overjoyed. I spent the night baking cookies to send to our family as an announcement. The amount of calls and posts online we received filled our hearts. We could not wait to raise our daughter. I particularly could not wait to teacher her my recipe.

The pregnancy went without any problems, and in nine short months we welcomed our bundle of joy into this world.  I did not realize how tired I would be. My husband and I agreed that we should breastfeed my daughter, but I did not realize how demanding it would be on me. I felt distant from my husband and I had no time to bake my delicious cookies. I knew those cookies would remind him that he loved me.

My husband was barely home anymore and we never spent time together when he was. I felt so distant from him. So lonely. I decided to try and make him some of my delicious cookies and we could both finally talk with our bellies full of joy. But I fell asleep while they were baking and burned them all. The fire alarm woke my daughter and the house reeked of smoke. My husband was so mad.

My husband's absence became more frequent. He would often go out with friends and not return until the morning. He barely looked at me. He would constantly receive texts and would hide his phone when I would look. I used to know his passcode, but he changed it a few weeks ago. I just knew if I could make cookies,  everything would go back to the way it was.

It was so difficult to mix the ingredients again. I was trying not to wake my daughter but of course, I did wake her. It took me forever to calm her down. She was screaming and crying so much, but I was determined. She eventually stopped and I was able to sit at my cooking table.

I saw the cookie pan out, cooling on the table. My husband must have finally come home and took them out for me. I was over the moon to taste my cookies again after so long, but why is the dough still wet?
