The last time I posted on here  I asked myself what would have happened if I had finished counting all the way to zero.



Now I know.



If you have no idea what I’m talking about you can catch up on my situation [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jtwmwo/the_games_i_used_to_play/). 



For those of you who are all caught up, I’m going to pick up right where I left off.



A few nights after I called my mom and asked about my childhood games Adrienne told me that she would be going out with a few girlfriends.



Honestly, when she told me this, I was conflicted. On one hand, with the house to myself I *could* do whatever I wanted. Which, of course meant that I could play any game. On the other hand, I was fucking terrified.



When Adrienne left for the night, it was the first time that I was completely alone in our new house. It wasn’t long before the silence began to drive me mad. With each passing minute I grew more paranoid.



The more I thought about it, the more I realized I didn’t entirely buy my mother’s story. 



She was hiding something from me - that much I was certain of. I considered calling her again and confronting her, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. *If* I was somehow wrong, I couldn’t bear to break her heart with my distrust. It wouldn’t be fair to her after all she had done for me. 



I stared down the creaky flight of wooden stairs into a lightless void. My heart raced as I thought about the monster waiting for me down there. It suddenly became incredibly difficult to breathe. I had played hundreds of games with the monster when I was a kid and not once did I experience a fear so petrifying. 



It seemed so normal to me at the time. The monster was just a part of the games. I never thought of him as anything more than that.



That night I never worked up the courage to descend the first step.



Instead, I stayed in the protective light of my kitchen, making sure to flip hall lights on both sides for maximum security. I avoided looking out the window into our backyard. The less ammunition I gave my brain to play tricks on itself the better.



I sat at the kitchen table and scrolled for hours. Instagram, Twitter, Reddit - anything to keep my mind off of the isolation I was confined to. 



About an hour into my scrolling, I began to hear noises coming from the basement. The sounds started innocently enough, something that could easily be mistaken for the gentle rattle of pipes settling in an old house. Then came rustling. It sounded like a raccoon, or other small animal had gotten loose down there and was knocking over cans and crawling into boxes.



I glanced up from my phone a few times to keep an eye on the door, but I knew that I needed to pretend I was uninterested. I didn’t need to play. I wouldn’t be a part of the monster’s games.



The sound became harder to ignore when the rustling turned to whispers. I couldn’t discern any specific words that were being uttered, but the imitation of the human voice was unmistakable. The vibrations carried themselves up, through the walls and through the tile floor of the kitchen.



Someone or something was down there.



But I already knew that.



I quickly unlocked my phone and opened my favorite contacts. I stared at Adrienne’s name, my heart damn near about to beat out of my chest. Her name sat above “Mom” as the only two in the short list.



Before clicking on her name I glanced at the clock. It was only 9:24 PM. She would be out with her girlfriends partying it up at the local bars well into the AM. I couldn’t do this to her. 



Instead, I lowered my phone to my side, and I cried. I can’t say for sure why. Call it exhaustion, loneliness, or fear. It doesn’t matter to me. But I do know that the monster broke me that night. 



And it did so without me even playing its games.



When I eventually crawled into bed I knew that sleep wouldn’t come easily. Hell, I’ll admit that I put on that damn British regency era romance show without a sleep timer. The light and sound did little to calm my nerves. I was smart enough to know that the television had all the same defensive properties as my comforter that I tucked myself into.



I pretended to be asleep in bed long enough to feel a numbness take over my body. My fear only subsided when Adrienne finally came home for the night. She tiptoed into our room, careful not to wake me. She crawled into bed next to me, and finally, feeling the comforting weight of her body next to mine, I was able to drift off into a dreamless sleep.



When I woke in the morning I wasn’t surprised that Adrienne was already up and out of bed. The TV was still on so I powered it off before I made my way to the kitchen, hoping that she had already started a pot of coffee. Typically, I avoid consuming caffeine but I was going to need all the help I could get if I wanted to make any real progress on cleaning up the backyard.



Stumbling into the kitchen, I saw Adrienne enter the front door wearing the same outfit she had gone out in last night.



When she saw my hair she laughed to herself. “And I thought I was the only one who had a long night.”  



I wiped the grogginess from my eyes before I responded.



“What were you doing on the porch? And why haven’t you changed?”



Adrienne cocked her head to the side.



“I tried to call you a hundred times. Jane got too wasted to drive so I had to crash at Dana’s last night. I’m just getting home now.”



The blood in my veins turned to ice.



Something had crawled into my bed last night. I heard it breathing. I felt its weight beside me. We were inches apart in the total darkness of my room. The thought made it feel like a hundred different bugs were crawling all over my skin. 



Luckily, Adrienne didn’t seem to notice my change in demeanor as she excused herself to shower. I sat down on the couch in our unpacked living room and covered my mouth with my hand.



The monster was getting too comfortable. I didn’t know what it wanted from me, but it had to know that I was terrified.



My first instinct was to get out of the house, but I couldn’t run forever. Even if I made the drastic decision to pack up and move, I knew that the monster would follow me wherever I went. 



I talked through my options with myself on the couch. I know that may sound weird, but I needed someone to bounce ideas off of and I’ve always found talking to myself to be helpful with problem solving.



By the end of the conversation, I had come to a grave and terrifying conclusion. I needed answers. And I knew exactly where I would find them. They would be waiting for me in the corner of my pitch black basement. They would come into light when I finished counting back from one hundred.



Before I knew it night had fallen upon the house and the day had slipped away from me. I wondered where the time went, but the reality was it didn’t even matter. I wasn’t in the right headspace to be doing housework.



As I lay in bed next to Adrienne I considered telling her everything. I was about to do something incredibly stupid that had a very real chance of getting her hurt. At the end of the day, I decided against it.



I didn’t know what my monster wanted, but it seemed way more interested in me than it was in Adrienne. It was my battle and I couldn’t get her involved. She came into my life when I was at my lowest point and she had shown me what true happiness was. For that, I will always be grateful. I love you, Adrienne.



When I was sure that my fiancé was asleep I kicked my feet out of bed silently. My toes pushed onto the scratchy carpet as I took my first few steps towards my bedroom door. We had only lived in the new house for a few days, yet I was already beginning to understand how to navigate it in the dark. 



To guide me, I let my right hand trace the wall, my fingers bobbing up and down against the drywall. I turned when I reached the kitchen. The door to the basement was already open, inviting me downstairs.



Had I left it open? I couldn’t remember.



The basement was silent. There was no rustle or whisper because the monster knew that I was coming. There was no need for an invitation.



I took a steadying breath and began my descent down the creaky wooden steps. I moved slowly and quietly as I forced myself to remain brave. The only reason I had won so many of the monster’s games when I was a child was because of my naïve courage. As an adult, I had finally come to understand fear’s true meaning.



Fear was understanding everything that you had to lose. 



Bravery was fighting to keep it, in spite of that fear.



As my bare foot kissed the cool concrete of the basement floor I pushed forward into the darkness. I would fight for Adrienne. I would fight for my mom. And I would fight for myself.



Before I began the countdown I switched on the basement’s singular fluorescent bulb. 



As I expected, the room was a mess of boxes and bags filled to the brim with decorations. Slowly, I slid mountains of cardboard out of the way, clearing my path to the corner. I was hundreds of miles away from the house where I first played the countdown game. The corner would be different, but the game would be the same.



As I bent over to lift the last remaining box I paused as I read the label taped on top.



“MARK - CHILDHOOD”



Instantly, I knew I had to open it. If there was any chance I could make it through the night without playing the countdown game, I would take it.



I rifled through old report cards and participation trophies. The box was dense, packed with various random trinkets and arts and crafts projects that I had acquired when I was young. Somehow, I had fond memories of none of them.



Just as I was about to give up my hunt, something in the disorganized box caught my eye. At first I thought it must have been packed in the wrong box.



It was an aged yellow folder with Adrienne’s name on it.



I opened the folder and found a stack of pages, identical in layout, each dated around twenty years ago.



Two names framed the header of each page.



*Adrienne, D. Morgan LCSW*



*Patient: Mark Cadello*



“What the fuck?” I whispered to myself.



I continued to skim the notes on each page using the light of the flickering fluorescent bulb. 



One read: “*Mark displays a pension for the imagination. He speaks of playing “games” with his imaginary friend. His social skills are steadily improving, although he still refuses to look me in the eye. I hope that he can continue to do well in school and befriend peers of his own age.”*



Another: “*Mark’s mood was sour today. I can’t blame him, Deborah mentioned that she had been admitted to the hospital again leaving no one to look after Mark while she was being held. Progress with his condition seems to have regressed. When I speak to him, his mind is elsewhere. Today he told me that his “friend” had instructed him to ignore me. I believe that he trusts his imaginary friend more than I.”*



The notes were all similar in tone, until the last.



It read: *“I believe that I have finally made a breakthrough with Mark. He struggles with discerning reality from fiction, but he is a brilliant and calculating child. Today I tapped into that potential by asking him to count back from one hundred, pausing for exactly one second between each number. I asked him to close his eyes and focus on himself, and when he finally opened them, he could be sure his surroundings were genuine. It worked flawlessly and afterwards we had our most authentic and raw conversation yet. I truly believe that this is the wind in our sails that Mark needed.”*



I dropped the papers to the floor. Goosebumps had crawled over my flesh long before I finished reading. Panicked, I unlocked my phone and opened my messages. 



There were no saved texts between myself and Adrienne. No recent calls or voicemails.



When I opened my photos, I could not find a single image of my fiancé. Places that I had sworn we had visited together she was absent from. My breathing grew heavy.



It was then when I noticed a dozen missed calls from my mom and a single voicemail. I steadied myself before pressing play.



“*Mark. Hey, it’s me. I know you’re probably mad at me right now and I get it. I shouldn’t have hidden anything from you.”*



She paused.



*“But I called Adrienne. She told me that you hadn’t gone to see her in over three years. I’m worried about you. Shit, Mark. I’m worried because I know that the games are real. I used to play them too. Mysteriously waking up at 3:17 AM. The hand over the side of the bed. Waiting till he was right behind you to sprint up the stairs. Mark, I’ve played with the monster too. That was before I understood. I wanted to keep you ignorant and happy, but I see that that was wrong of me. I should have trusted you with the truth. I know what you are going through, and I can help. I- You shouldn’t be alone right now. I'll be over as soon as I can. Hang in there baby. I love you.”*



When I tried to call back, it went straight to voicemail.



Shadows danced around me as my head began to spin. I turned to race out of the basement. I would wait on the porch until my mom arrived if I had to. But when I looked up from the bottom of the basement stairs I saw that the kitchen door had been shut. 



I sprinted to the top and tried the door. It wouldn’t budge. I slammed my fist against the wood over and over.



“Adrienne! Adrienne! Please, let me out!” 



I could only describe what I had been feeling at that moment as nightmarish. Or perhaps more accurately, it felt like those few dreadful moments after waking from a nightmare - disorienting and terrifying. Expect the moments never ended.



I kept waking to form new realizations and new horrible realities. My sense of truth had been so distorted and mangled that I didn’t know what to believe.



“You know what to do.” A voice responded from the other side of the door. It was so quiet that I wasn’t even sure that I heard it.



“No. I won’t play. I don’t want to!” I screamed back.



The entire house began to shake and a piercing sound cut into my ears.



“Then how will you ever know what is real?”



The voice spoke directly into my mind.



“Make it stop!” I cried, covering my ears.



I stumbled back down the steps. When I reached the base I staggered into the cement wall, sending a pile of boxes crashing to the ground. The entire basement had come alive. Everything moved. Everything spoke. And I just wanted it to stop.



I yanked the chain to turn off the light with so much force I nearly ripped it from its socket. 



“Okay! You win! I’ll play!”



As if in response to my exclamation, the sounds and chaos around me began to calm. It didn’t take long before there was only darkness and silence.



With my legs shaking, I made my way to the corner of the basement that I had cleared. I lowered myself to the ground, feeling the cool concrete on the sides of my calves as I crossed my legs.



Drawing in a steadying breath, I closed my eyes. And I began to count.



“One hundred. Ninety-Nine. Ninety-Eight.”



I didn’t even need to focus to ensure exactly a second passed between each number. It came as naturally to me as riding a bike.



“Eighty-Seven. Eighty-Six.”



I avoided thinking about the monster, about Adrienne, and about my mother. I focused on myself, alone in the dark basement.



“Seventy-One. Seventy. Sixty-Nine.”



With each second that I drew closer to zero, I saw the light at the end of the tunnel growing warmer. I had to play, I had to win.



“Fifty-Two. Fifty-One. Fifty.”



Halfway.



“Thirty-Eight. Thirty-Seven.”



All at once my repressed memories bubbled to the surface. I remembered the look in my mom’s eyes when I asked her if I wanted to play. I remember seeing Adrienne, my therapist the day before.



“Twenty-Six. Twenty-Five”



I feel something begin to swirl around me. It could hardly be called a touch. Still, I refuse to open my eyes.



“Nineteen. Eighteen.”



The monster draws near. I know that it's smiling. It’s salivating at the idea of me reaching zero.



“Seven. Six.”



My only thought is winning. 



“Five. Four. Three.”



When I get to zero I’ll be safe because I will finally be able to trust my eyes. I will know that what surrounds me is real.



“Two.”



I love you Adrienne. I hope that the woman that I know is waiting for me on the other side.



“One.”



I’m sorry mom, but I had to know. I needed the truth.



“Zero.”



I open my eyes. I am still facing  the corner of my basement, surrounded by shadow.



When I turn around I know he’s there. My monster, lurking in the darkness, ready to face me.



“I won.” I say into the void.
