It started a week ago when I got a notification on Instagram about a new follower. I get random requests all the time, so it didn’t stand out at first. The username was **Optimus.Prime33**.

Not exactly subtle, not exactly human. No profile picture, no posts, no bio, following exactly one person — me. I didn’t follow back, obviously. I don’t follow empty accounts unless I know the person, and I didn’t know this one.

Actually, I didn’t know anything about this one. Zero mutuals. Zero footprint. Zero reason to exist.

I remember looking at the profile for a total of three seconds and thinking, “Bot.” Closed the app and moved on. End of story.

Or so I thought.

The next morning I woke up, brushed my teeth, made the same coffee I drink every day, and sat on my sofa replying to boring work messages. My phone buzzed with a notification from Instagram: **“*****Optimus.Prime33 mentioned you in a post.*****”**

I rolled my eyes, thinking it was probably some spam reel tagging random people. Opened it anyway.

It wasn’t a reel.  
It was a photo.  
A picture of my building.

My building — not a stock photo, not something anyone could Google. My actual building, taken from the street. The angle was unmistakable. My floor. My balcony railing. The light from my bedroom window. Everything.

Caption: **“You’re still here.”**

I remember sitting there staring at my phone thinking, Who the fuck is this? I clicked the profile again. Still private. Still no posts except this one. Still following just me. Still no followers. It felt like a blank mask staring back.

I tried blocking him. Instagram behaved like it worked — “User blocked” — but when I refreshed the page, the account was still there. Nothing changed. I tried again. Same thing. The account clung to me like glue.

I shrugged it off and went to work because honestly, I wasn’t about to lose my day over some idiot with a Transformers username.

Later that afternoon, another notification: **another tag.**

This time, it was a picture of me.

Walking to the lift.

Taken from the lobby.

The lobby was empty when I left my apartment. I’m not imagining that. I didn’t see anyone standing near the stairs or pretending to scroll by the wall. It was dead quiet. But the photo was taken from the corner — the exact opposite corner from where I was walking.

The caption said: **“You don’t notice anything.”**

That pissed me off more than it scared me.

I commented under the post: **“Who are you?”**

He replied instantly.  
Not a second of delay.  
Just: **“:)”**

I felt the hair on my arms rise. I don’t know why that stupid smiley hit so hard, but it did. Something about the way he responded so fast, like he was waiting for me to ask.

I clicked unfollow out of pure irritation. All his posts vanished instantly. Like his profile wiped itself clean the moment I cut the link. When I followed again to check, he accepted immediately. No delay. Almost like he’d been staring at his screen waiting for me to click the button.

Two days later, I woke up early for work — earlier than usual because I had a meeting I didn’t want to be late for — and I found another tag.

A screenshot.  
My old Facebook profile.  
Like ancient-old.

Photos from college. Cringe memes I’d forgotten I posted. People I don’t even speak to anymore. He scraped something from an era of my life I barely remember, and posted it like some kind of digital trophy.

Caption: **“Always liked this one.”**

Liked WHAT?  
The picture?  
Me?  
The life I had back then?

I didn’t know, and honestly, I didn’t want to think about it.

I started to get uneasy. Not terrified yet — just annoyed and unsettled. Like when you know a mosquito is in your room but you can’t find it.

Yesterday, it escalated.

I left work, walked toward my bike parked near the gate like always, and my phone buzzed. Another tag.

A picture of my bike.  
Same angle I see it from when I walk up to it.  
Taken moments before I got there.

I scanned the area thinking maybe some idiot from the office was messing with me. But nobody was standing around. Nobody was hiding behind cars or pillars. It was just… empty.

Caption: **“You really don’t know me.”**

Yeah, I fucking don’t.  
And that was the problem.

Last night I sat on my couch for two straight hours scrolling through my memories trying to place him. School? No. College? No. Office? Definitely not. A friend of a friend? Nothing. A random neighbor? No. Someone I pissed off years ago? No idea.

There was nothing. No connection. No shared history. No reason this guy should know anything about me.

This morning, things got real.

About forty minutes ago, he posted a picture of my doorbell.

My NAMEPLATE.

Up close.

Clear as daylight.  
He had stood right there.

Caption: **“Back home soon?”**

That was it for me. I grabbed my keys, grabbed my phone, didn’t even check if the door was locked, just walked straight out. Didn’t call anyone, didn’t tell anyone, just walked fast and didn’t look back.

I must’ve reached the police station in five minutes flat. Probably broke a walking speed record.

And now I’m sitting in this shitty plastic chair with people screaming down the hall and constables walking past without making eye contact. The fan above me is rattling like it’s about to fall, my palms are sweating, and I’m typing all of this out because I haven’t figured out how to explain this without sounding insane.

“Hi sir, some guy with a Transformers username is tagging me in pictures of my balcony.”  
Yeah, great. Sounds normal.

I opened Instagram to check if he posted anything new. Nothing. The same set of posts, arranged neatly like a timeline of creeping dread.

I tapped each one again:

My balcony.  
Me near the lift.  
My old Facebook profile.  
My bike.  
My doorbell.

I zoomed into each picture trying to find clues. Reflections. Shadows. Footprints. Corners. Anything. There was nothing. Whoever took these photos was careful. Too careful.

I checked the timestamps. They lined up with my routine, almost perfectly. Morning, afternoon, post-work, late evening.

The fucker knew my schedule.

I even checked the metadata on the photos — Instagram strips most of it, but I checked anyway. Nothing. 

I tried Googling his username. Nothing. No Reddit. No Twitter. No stray gaming IDs. Nothing in any breach database. No traces. Like the account exists only on Instagram, only connected to me.

I even tried messaging him. “Tell me who you are.”  
No reply.

I was halfway through typing a second message when I realized I was being stupid and stopped before giving him more attention.

And now I’m here, stuck in a police station, typing this all down while constables keep walking past me like I’m a stain on the floor.

I wish I could say I’m calm. I’m not. I’m trying so hard to pretend I’m not affected, but my chest feels tight, and I keep checking the station doorway expecting him to walk in.

I keep refreshing Instagram every few seconds and each time I brace myself for another notification.

I swear I’m shaking writing this. All of this feels unreal and too real at the same time. A stranger following me everywhere, taking photos, posting them seconds later, reacting instantly when I unfollow or comment… It's too much.

I’m trying to appear normal in the police station, but I keep glancing at the entrance. Every time the door moves, my heartbeat jumps. Every time someone coughs behind me, I flinch.

Someone has been watching me for a week, closely enough to know when I leave my room, when I enter my lift, when I park my bike, when I unlock my door, when I panic.

I’m trying to steady myself, but my fingers won’t stop tapping the screen.

My phone buzzed as I was typing this out.

Another tag.  
Another post.

My hands are cold. I opened Instagram without thinking.

This time it was a picture of me.

Sitting on this same plastic chair.  
Typing on my phone.

My shoulders hunched the exact way they are right now. My thumb mid-swipe. My leg bent at the same angle. Everything identical.

It was taken from beside me.  
Right next to my shoulder.  
Like someone stood inches away while I typed.

And I didn’t notice anybody standing there.

The caption read: **“This won’t help.”**
