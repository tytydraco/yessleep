My friend Chuck wouldn’t stop growing hair. I first noticed his hands about a month ago and I wish I had said something then. We play video games almost every time he comes over, mostly fighting games. So when he started using combos I had never seen before I glanced over to his controller to see if I could copy what he was doing. That's when I noticed the thick long strands of hair on his knuckles. I thought nothing of it - probably just one of those things you never really notice. The next time he came over I checked again and I couldn’t really be sure but it seemed almost twice as hairy as the last time. That's when I noticed it poking out of his sleeves… and when I decided to say something.
“Dude I’ve never noticed but you look like a bigfoot” 

“Shut the fuck up and play” he barked at me pointing back to the screen.

This was really out of the norm for Chuck. He was always polite and well-mannered and never was one to let you get under his skin. Shortly after he tugged the sleeves of his shirt down to cover his wrists, finished the game and promptly left. I texted him later that night to apologize making sure I didn’t cross a line and if I did it certainly wasn’t my intention. He didn’t respond.

Living in Allentown, PA means that there isn’t much to do. That’s why I always loved our video game nights and football sundays. I mean hell, sometimes Chuck would even stay the whole weekend. And that's why it was so strange when he didn’t ask to hangout that next weekend, or the next two weeks for that matter. I couldn’t stop thinking that I had ruined the one good relationship I had in this barren, wasteland of a city. But that's when the murders started.
Everynight for for almost a week and a half, police found at the very least three people gored in the chest on the cold empty streets of Allentown. Sure there has always been crime…robberies, gang violence, car break-ins… but never anything like this. The victims would be found torn apart at the chest with organs missing and the police had no suspects and no motives. The news channels described it the best they could without showing the images on television but they did the gruesome scenes no justice. After a little digging online you could find the images of the chunks of flesh and bone that had once been human. This was the type of shit you would see on live leak but in the streets of the city, this stupid fucking city.

 As the nights went on the killing became cleaner. What used to be senseless, barbaric, mashing and grinding of a human body into a pile of rotting human meat and splintering bone smoothly transitioned to the authorities finding empty husks of skin and shattered bone with the innards and major bone structures missing. The city had eventually issued a curfew for the city but the detail that bothered me most was that all the murders happened right near where Chuck lived. 

After almost three whole weeks of not seeing Chuck and the murder count nearing 80 I decided to just head over to his place. His place looked like he hadn’t been there in days and hadn’t cleaned in months. Food was everywhere on top of a layer of other trash and tattered dirty clothing. This really wasn’t like him. No one was home as far as I could tell although he lived in a noisy apartment complex so it was hard to try to listen for anything. I checked all the rooms and they all looked the same, except for the bathroom. I walked into a two inch carpet of matted hair caked in blood. There were three pairs of scissors and two electric razors stuffed and jammed with hair. But this wasn’t just ordinary hair, it was thick and long, too long to be body hair but too stiff to be head hair. I shook my feet and knocked my shoes together to get the bloodied chunks of hair off the soles before I walked back into the living room. Next to the couch was Chuck’s laptop with the lid still open. I quickly found a charger and plugged it in to look for a clue for where Chuck might be. His search history read;

“Why is my hair growing so fast?’
“Why is my body hair longer and thicker?”
“Animal pelts and furs”

After a little more digging I found a video recorded three weeks ago titled, “Watch ASAP” and with no hesitation I clicked it. It was Chuck. He was sitting right where I was sitting and upon first glance I thought he had some kind of hoodie or costume on but it was…hair. He was sweating profusely from whatever skin I could see under his fur. He opened his mouth to speak and it was a dark red. He could only vocalize and he couldn't speak words. He grunted and groaned in so much pain. He put his hands to his face and they were…bigger. He ran his finger through his mouth and the few teeth he had left fell to the floor. I looked down at my feet and saw a few of them between the mounds of trash and food. I could feel my stomach twist. Suddenly the groaning turned to what I can only describe as a roar as he opened his mouth to an ungodly degree, unhinging his jaw like a snake. He had grown into something else. His body was swollen, his arms and legs bulging with thick muscle, covered in black hair. His face was the worst part. His jawline had expanded and the skin around his mouth was stretched tight, revealing fangs. Suddenly bulging out was a beak—a long, duck-like beak stretching out from his face, covered in fur.
He was a monster.
He was some kind of a… duck bear.

I checked the time and it was 10 minutes till the city’s new curfew. I quickly grabbed the laptop to take to the police and made it out to the building as quickly as I could. When I made it outside it was silent. I could hear my own sneakers hitting the concrete. When suddenly the dead silence of the night was interrupted by a low muted pounding. I stopped to try to listen and it only got louder and faster. I picked up my pace now about 100 feet from my car. After only a few steps I finally saw it. Saw him. 

He rounded the building about a block away. In a full sprint, was a 10 foot, 600 pound goliath. In the dead of the night all I could see was a gargantuan, pitch black silhouette with glowing, dirty yellow eyes dropping to all fours in perfect coordination racing towards me. I quickly made it to my car popping the trunk to grab my G36K automated rifle. I took the rifle and got to the opposite end of my car to get a vantage point to take a good shot but by the time I could duck behind the front of my car it was flung away to the other side of the street. The car became airborne, barrel rolling to the sidewalk on the other side of the road revealing in front of me…the creature.

I dropped to my back and took aim…

“CLICK”

The magazine was missing. I felt a sharp stabbing in my side, a claw crushing my ribs just to get a grip. Then like it was nothing, I was thrown with ease across the road and hit the back half of my car. I could feel my bones on the right side of my body snap and crack on impact. I scooted myself to the back side of my car to find some kind of cover when I put my left hand down on the magazine. I laid the gun in my lap and quickly clicked the ammunition into place before being picked up again. I gripped the gun tight in my left hand as it picked me up again from my right side. I could feel my splintered bones tearing through my muscle and in some spots poking through my skin. The beast threw me again to the middle of the street. It approached me slowly as I cocked the rifle. Now standing over me it let out a ground rumbling roar. It raises its arms and was about to throw itself down and into my chest as I raised the gun, the barrel pointing to it’s head, and screamed,

“Chuck!”

And pulled the trigger. The creature’s head jerked back and a drip of blood flew through the air above it and the creature fell backwards. It was dead. Emergency vehicles arrived seconds after, the loud noises caused people to call the police. It’s been a few days since the incident as I type this out but I now recall one final detail. After I yelled his name the creature I once knew as Chuck looked down at me… into my eyes. I could see through the hair… it was a person… it was my best friend…it was Chuck
