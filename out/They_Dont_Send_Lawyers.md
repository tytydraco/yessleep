My name is Arthur. If you’ve read anything I’ve written [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kttzah/i_found_a_ship_in_an_abandoned_cold_war_facility/), you already know that I shouldn’t be alive. A few months ago, I escaped a flooded and sealed facility, and discovered a secret global organization that’s now trying to hunt me down.

It’s been a few weeks since I posted the first leak. I made sure to attach evidence: documents, diagrams, logs, everything I could prove. Yes, they were blurry, but also unmistakable.

People saw it. And like I expected, most of them did nothing.

Comment sections filled up with jokes and memes. A few deep-dive threads actually popped up, to my surprise, but the ones that gained traction? They were the ones claiming it was an ARG, a hoax.

The Thalassian Order didn’t scrub the files. But they didn’t deny them either.

Instead, they just *buried* it. Under a thousand other replies and posts from verified and trusted accounts. “Science debunkers”, they called themselves. And they all said the same thing.

>“It’s a cool story. But it’s just that. A story.”

I underestimated the power and influence of the Order. I thought getting the truth out would be enough to convince people – but I didn’t realize what I was up against.

The Thalassian Order isn’t just a rogue agency clinging to the past – it’s global, and it has governments, societies, and people in its pockets. They control them however they want.

Of course, I didn’t just make all of this up. I have inside information from someone who wishes to remain anonymous. He helped me get the leak out, using encrypted messages and late-night calls from a burner phone.

He warned me of what would happen. He told me that once the Order sees you as a breach, they don’t send lawyers.

They send something else.

And he was right.

But I’m getting ahead of myself. Let’s go back to when I first heard from him.

It started with a text from an unknown number.

>“You don’t know me, but I know what you found. Don’t post anything yet.”

I froze. This was just a few days after I escaped and wasn’t ready for a text like this. I was still trying to sleep more than three hours a night without waking up from a nightmare.

“Who is this?”

No response.

Then, about twenty minutes later, my phone rang. It was the same unknown number.

I fidgeted, not knowing whether I should pick up or let it be. My hands answered for me.

A voice came through – the voice of a calm and measured man.

“You don’t need my name. Just know I’m not with them anymore.”

*Them*. He didn’t need to clarify.

“The footage you took. The logs. You don’t know how recognizable they are to the right people. If you post it without preparation, they’ll find you.”

“How did you find me?” I asked.

“Doesn’t matter. What matters is they haven’t – not yet, at least.”

His voice was flat, but there was a hint of resentment in it. I could tell he was being sincere. And what did he mean by “not with them *anymore*”?

“Why are you helping me?”

“Because the Order doesn’t keep secrets to protect people anymore. They keep them to protect themselves.”

He told me to buy a burner phone, and to only use encrypted apps through which we could communicate more freely. He called himself *Anonymous* – not to be edgy and mysterious, but because he said I wouldn’t trust any name he gave me (which was probably true).

We didn’t talk often, but when we did, it was always late.

He told me how the Order worked – the real version, not the mission statement in the files I found.

They don’t erase information, but drown it. They don’t silence people, but discredit them. And when that fails, they escalate.

“There are internal protocols. Different categories of breach. Most get flagged and forgotten – but if you start generating noise, they’ll mark you as an active hazard.”

“What does that mean?”

“It means they send something that doesn’t need to file a report afterward.”

He helped me organize the leak – in waves, not all at once. Photos first, then documents and personal logs. Nothing that could be traced directly back to a specific facility.

But it wasn’t fast enough for me. Every day I waited felt like time wasted. The world *needed* to see it. In fact, you still do.

So, one night, I leaked the facility map. Didn’t discuss it with Anonymous – just uploaded it.

He called me five minutes later.

“What the hell did you just do?”

“I had to. People aren’t taking it seriously.”

“Take it down and pray that no one’s seen it. Now.”

I thought he was exaggerating, but I listened to him. Although it was too late.

The next morning, he called the moment I woke up – something he’d never done before.

“You fucked up. They sent O6.”

I sat up instantly, my throat dry. All of my sleepiness disappeared.

“What does that mean?”

A pause.

“It means stay somewhere with a controlled climate. Keep any type of moisture low. No pipes or windows.”

“But what is it?”

“A Subject they managed to get under control. Or created, I’m not sure. Now it serves them. But it doesn’t hunt like a person – it tracks environmental anomalies. Mostly moisture. That means if you sweat, it knows. If the walls are damp, it knows.”

“So, what, I can’t even breathe hard?”

“If your breath fogs a mirror, you’re already on thin ice.”

The line was quiet for a few seconds until I processed everything. Then a single sentence.

“You’re not safe anymore, Arthur.”

I didn’t reply – instead, my arms darted around the room. There was a draft I hadn’t noticed before. A soft drip from the ceiling near the bathroom vent. My anxiety made me sweat.

I wasn’t safe in my own home.

I packed what little I had and left in under five minutes. I even forgot to lock my door.

I went to a motel and paid for a room there. Nothing big, I just had to make sure it was dry.

I brought towels and paper napkins. Constantly wiped everything – my hands and face. The windows as well. I even taped plastic wrap over the bathroom mirror.

I didn’t sleep – I was too scared to even try. Just stayed up all night, waiting for Anonymous to call. But he didn’t.

By the third night, I started to think maybe it had moved on. I successfully hid and it had lost me.

But that same night, there was a sound at my front door. Not a knock or a voice – but a drip. One single droplet hitting a tile in the motel hallway. Right outside my door.

I froze.

Another followed. Then silence.

I got off the bed and crept to the peephole, slowly, trying to be quieter than air itself. I looked through but saw nothing.

But the floor was wet. A thin line of moisture ran under the door, like it had been drawn by a finger trailing water.

Then I saw it.

A figure came into the peephole’s view. It walked past my room, then seconds later walked past it again.

I couldn’t see its face, but I saw its chest rise.

It stopped right in front of my door. I backed away, and could feel my heart pounding in my throat. The drip sound returned, but louder now.

The handle turned.

*Click.*

I locked it – but it could somehow open it.

I sprinted forward and threw my body against the door just as it pushed in. Something slammed back against me from the other side, hard.

Still, it was too late. The door creaked open an inch or two, and I fell back as it pushed through, stumbling into the bedroom. It stepped inside.

Its skin wasn’t really skin. It looked like wax soaked in a generous amount of water – pale and translucent in some places, discolored in others. The torso was longer than it should’ve been, but it wasn’t necessarily tall. Fluid pulsed visibly beneath the surface, like something was still circulating – it was alive. Thin strands clung to its shoulders, fused into the waxy skin – not hanging like hair, but *growing out of it*, like nerves exposed to air.

Its chest rose again, this time not stopping. A gill split open across its neck, and released vapor.

Then it ran at me.

I barely dodged it – its hands scraping the wall beside me as I threw myself behind the bed. I grabbed the floor lamp and swung, which wasn’t effective – the beast snatched it mid-air and bent the metal in half.

I turned and bolted for the bathroom (the creature was obstructing the way outside), slamming the door shut behind me. There was no lock, so I wedged the trash bin under the handle.

The mirror was taped so I couldn’t see my face, but I could feel it was soaked – not just sweat, but the air around me. The thing’s presence made the room wet. It was inescapable.

*Drip. Drip.*

From the other side of the door.

A slow groan of metal and the door started bending inwards. The trash bin gave and the door swung open.

I was trapped and it knew.

My back hit the shower door and I grabbed the only thing within reach – the hairdryer. It was useless as a weapon so I dropped it.

My eyes darted up – the curtain rod. I pulled with everything I had and it came loose.

When it approached, I drove the rod upward, straight into its mouth. It gagged on the metal; not from the pain, but from the obstacle. It staggered back, coughing violently.

It didn’t cause any damage, but it gave me time to think. My fingers found the shattered edge of the hairdryer.

A surge of instinct hit me.

*Water. Electricity.*

I slammed the plug into the nearest outlet with one hand and drove the cracked end into the puddle spreading from its body.

A white arc sparked across the tile. It convulsed, its limbs jerking around. Then it dropped to the floor – hard.

I didn’t wait to see if it was dead. I sprinted out of the bathroom, out of the motel room. Out of the entire building, in fact. I ran until my lungs gave out.

When I finally collapsed, I was several blocks away. I don’t know how long I stayed there, but it was long enough to watch the sky turn from black to blue.

Where I went next – I won’t say. Not yet, at least.

All you need to know is: I’m safe. It won’t find me. I talked to Anonymous and he told me posting this will not pose a threat. Here, there are no windows, pipes, or moisture.

Anonymous checks on me every so often. He sends me warnings and updates. He says the Subject hasn’t been seen since the motel, but that doesn’t mean it’s gone.

I told him I’d lay low and keep quiet. And I meant it.

…mostly.

Because I’ve been thinking – not just about what happened, but *why* it happened.

About why they exist. Why no one can touch them. Why truth isn’t enough anymore. I have Anonymous telling me almost anything I ask him. 

This story isn’t over. And neither am I.

I’ll be back when it’s safe – and when I do, I’ll post an update to all this.

Believe me, I won’t just leak. I’m going to [drown them](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThalassianOrder/)*.*
