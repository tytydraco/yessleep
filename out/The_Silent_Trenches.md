My grandfather, Nathaniel Foster, never spoke much about the war. He’d sit by the window, staring out, his eyes distant, like he was seeing something I couldn’t. The few times he did speak, it was like a soft, cracked whisper, as though the words were fighting their way out of him. But one night, after the storm had passed and the house was quiet, I finally heard the story.

It was a cold evening in the spring of 1917. Grandpa was only 20 then, a young man with a future that should have stretched out before him. But like so many others, he found himself in the mud-choked trenches of France, fighting in a war that felt endless. He told me it wasn’t the explosions that haunted him the most—it was the silence. The way the earth swallowed everything. The bombs had a rhythm, a heartbeat. But silence… silence was terrifying.

He told me about the first night they were in the trenches. The thick fog rolled in, and everything turned into a haze. You could barely see a foot in front of you, just shadows flickering in and out of view. A man’s silhouette would appear in the mist, only to disappear as quickly as he came. There were no birds, no rustling trees, just the distant thud of artillery, and the groan of the earth beneath your feet.

Then came the first sighting. A soldier in their unit, a quiet man from Yorkshire, had gone out for a routine patrol. Hours passed. Then, just as the fog thickened even further, he returned. His face was ashen, and his hands were trembling.

“He saw something,” Grandpa told me, voice low. “Something we weren’t meant to see.”

The man was silent, but Grandpa could see his eyes. Those wide, wild eyes that spoke of things no man should ever endure. He couldn’t explain it, but the others tried to convince him it was just the horrors of war, that it was the fear creeping into his bones.

The next night, they heard it. A whisper. It was faint at first, but then it grew louder. A voice calling from the darkness. Grandpa said it was so quiet, you thought it might be the wind. But it wasn’t. It wasn’t the wind at all.

They all heard it. “Help… me…”

The voice was strained, pleading. At first, they thought it was one of their own, wounded and stuck somewhere in the mist. They couldn’t see anything, couldn’t find anyone. But the voice kept coming, echoing through the fog, over and over again.

By dawn, one man had broken. He snapped. The voice had driven him mad, and he ran, yelling, “Get out! Get out!” He didn’t even see the trench wall in front of him, just slammed into it and fell down.

But it wasn’t over. The whispering voice had found a new victim. Grandpa’s best friend, Eddie, was never the same after that. He started seeing things—things that weren’t there. Sometimes he would wake up in the night, screaming about figures lurking in the fog, their faces twisted, eyes hollow. But there was nothing there. Only the shadows.

As the days wore on, Grandpa began to notice something else. The ground was soft in places, too soft, like it was swallowing them whole. At night, the soldiers swore they could hear the dirt shifting beneath them, the sound of something moving just out of reach.

Then, the whispers changed. They stopped calling for help and started telling stories. Stories of soldiers who had died long before. Soldiers who had never seen the light of day again.

But Grandpa’s breaking point came one night when a different kind of whisper reached him. It was his own name.

“Nathaniel…”

He couldn’t move. His body froze, gripped by a cold terror that squeezed his lungs tight. There was no mist. No fog. Just darkness. And the whisper. “Nathaniel, help us…”

He turned slowly, his rifle held tight in his shaking hands, and there—just beyond the trench’s edge—was the shape of a man. A soldier, dressed in mud-streaked uniform. His face was hollow, his skin stretched tight over the bones, his eyes wide open, unblinking.

Grandpa pulled the trigger without thinking. The shot echoed, and the figure vanished, swallowed by the night.

He was the last to see it—the thing in the fog. After that, the whispers stopped. But there were others. More soldiers lost their minds, driven mad by things they couldn’t see, things that never left them. The silence was broken only by the screams of men who had seen too much.

When Grandpa came home, he never spoke of it again. He would sit by the window and stare out into the night, as if waiting for something to return. And sometimes, when I asked him about the war, he would give me a sad smile, as though he had already said too much. But that night—when the silence felt too heavy, when the air was thick with memories I couldn’t understand—he finally told me everything.

“There are things in the world,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper, “that you can’t fight. You can only survive. And sometimes, just sometimes, it’s the silence that’ll get you.”

I never asked him to tell me more. I didn’t need to. The fear in his eyes told me everything I needed to know.
