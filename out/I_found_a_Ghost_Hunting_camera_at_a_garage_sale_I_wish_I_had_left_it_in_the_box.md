I’ve always been a skeptic. As a freelance photographer, I’ve seen enough lens flares, dust motes, and "orbs" to know that 99% of paranormal photos are just bad equipment or poor lighting. So, when I found an old, modified Canon DSLR at a garage sale for twenty bucks, I bought it for the parts. The seller was a frantic-looking woman who didn’t even count the money; she just pushed the box into my hands and locked her front door before I could even say thank you.

Engraved on the side of the camera were the words: "THE SPECTRUM BRIDGE – DO NOT FOCUS."

I spent the evening cleaning the lens. It was a strange piece of glass, tinted with a faint, oily purple hue. When I looked through the viewfinder, everything looked normal, just slightly darker. But when I took the first test shot of my living room and looked at the digital display, my blood turned to ice.

In the photo, my living room was identical, except for one thing. On my sofa, sitting right where I had been a minute ago, was a figure. It looked like a person made of tightly wound grey static. It had no face, just a slight indentation where the mouth should be, and it was holding my TV remote. I looked at my physical sofa—it was empty. I took another photo. The figure was now standing up, facing the camera.

I spent the next three hours obsessed. I went from room to room, clicking the shutter. The "Static People," as I started calling them, were everywhere. There was one standing in the corner of my kitchen, its elongated fingers resting on my toaster. There was another one crouching on top of my refrigerator. They didn't move in real time, but every photo showed them in a new position, always slightly closer to me.

Then I realized the most terrifying part: they weren't just in my house. I looked out the window and snapped a picture of the street. The "Bridge" revealed hundreds of them. They were clinging to the roofs of cars, walking alongside late-night joggers, and huddling in groups under streetlights. They weren't ghosts of the dead; they were something else, a parallel layer of existence that had been there all along, watching us, touching us, and we never felt a thing.

I made the mistake of taking a selfie.

In the photo, I was smiling, but behind me, three of them were pressing their static-filled faces against my back. One of them had its hand hovering just inches from my eyes. I felt a sudden, sharp chill on my skin—the first time I had felt anything "physical" from them.

I decided to destroy the camera. I took a hammer to the lens, but the purple glass wouldn't break. Instead, it bled. A thick, translucent violet fluid leaked out, smelling like ozone and rotting meat. That’s when my phone started vibrating. It wasn't a call. It was a series of image files being sent to me via AirDrop from an "Unknown Sender."

I opened the first one. It was a photo of me, taken from the corner of my ceiling. I looked up, but there was nothing there. I opened the second one. It was a close-up of my own ear. I could see the individual hairs and the pores of my skin. And right next to my ear, a static-filled mouth was wide open, as if it was about to scream.

The last photo came through ten minutes ago. It shows me sitting at my desk, typing this post. But in the photo, my hands aren't made of flesh anymore. From the wrists down, they are starting to turn into that grey, vibrating static. I can feel it now—a tingling numbness spreading up my arms.

The camera is sitting on my desk, its broken lens still bleeding. I can’t look away from the viewfinder anymore. Because through the glass, I can see that they aren't just standing in the room with me. They are lined up at my door, waiting for the rest of me to fade so they can finally pull me across the Bridge.

If you ever see a camera with a purple lens at a garage sale, please, keep walking. Some things are invisible for a reason.
