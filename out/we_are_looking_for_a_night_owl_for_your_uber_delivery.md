So it was last month on a Monday night around 1 AM and everything was super dead, but my family were hungry for takeout. So I ordered for both me and my wife and my two sons ordered separately online for themselves. We didn’t feel like cooking and so takeout delivery from uber seemed like a great idea. So we all ordered and on the phone you can see uber trying to find someone that would deliver the food to us at this time. It kept finding someone and then going back to ‘looking for another night owl’ 


It was the same for both my sons as well and then suddenly uber had a delivery guy for us. It told us all that our deliveries would be here within 5 minutes. That was strange because the places we ordered from would usually take about 20 minutes to deliver to us, but it was no biggie. I went to close my eyes for a little bit on the sofa and then my eldest son Joshua woke me up. He said that there were 3 shadowy figures on our front yard with our orders in their hands. 


They were in the shade and then I turned on the lights that would shine onto the front yard, what I saw were the most 3 deathly looking figures I had ever seen in my life. They were so pale and lifeless, yet they were standing in our front yard. Then one of the delivery guys told me to get my order by going out to him, but my instincts told me not to do that. 


I told him to leave our orders on the floor and the first delivery guy had mine and my wife’s food in his hands, the other two guys had one delivery order for my eldest son Joshua and the third guy had the other order for my second son Eric. Then they asked us to give them permission to enter our homes, but we weren’t going to do that in a million years. Then one of them told us that we needed to come to them to give them the code so that they could put it into their phone. 


I shouted out the code to them for mine and my wife’s food, but they weren’t accepting that. Then in the distance we see another delivery guy delivering food to one of our neighbours. As our neighbour stepped out to get his order, the delivery started biting into him and he started screaming and begging for help. Then the 3 delivery guys outside in our front yard started showing us their vampiric teeth’s. They then said that if we wanted our food then we would have to go out to them. 


We stayed inside our house and for the whole night the 3 delivery guys just stood on our front yard waiting for us to get the food. They would mock us by saying “the food is getting cold” and we decided to go to bed hungry. In the morning, we found our uber food orders just on the ground.
