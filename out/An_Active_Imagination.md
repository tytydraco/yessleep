Ever since I was little, my imagination could conjure up things far more frightening than any horror film. I remember my astonishment when I realized not everyone sees images in their heads. The concept of aphantasia was trending online (at least in my algorithm) a year or two ago and it blew my mind. Upon reading people’s experience with it, I concluded I had whatever the opposite of aphantasia was. The internal pictures I created were so vivid and detailed that as a child I often got in trouble at school for daydreaming. 

It’s always somewhat embarrassing when people ask me if I’ve read any good books lately. I was an avid reader–but I rarely read published books. In my experience, “amateur” writers were often far more talented than writers with publishing companies backing their work. The amount of bookmarked fanfiction I had read that was better than the source material was ever increasing in my mobile browser. Hell, sometimes I even preferred to read erotic literature rather than watch porn while masturbating. Maybe it was the control and freedom granted by my own imagination rather than consuming someone else’s visual representation.

So if I wanted to indulge in some creepy content, reading scary stories online was my go to.  And there was no shortage of scary stories on the internet. My usual source consisted of one website in particular that allowed me to sort the top rated scary short stories of the week, month, or year published by users of the site. Every few weeks or so after settling in bed for the evening, I would sort the top stories of the week or month (depending on my last scary stories session) as I lay in bed on my phone, sometimes for hours on end depending on how intriguing the stories were. 

Although I would like to consider myself a very level headed person, I can admit that some of the stories were quite eerie and disturbing. My solitude combined with the darkness of the night made for a chilling atmosphere from time to time. Like I said, I have a very active imagination, and depending on the writer, I was able to envision some terrifying images in my head. I could easily spook myself out and let my brain get the best of me. Tonight was one of those nights when I felt extra on edge–slightly paranoid, but in a good way. Why else do people like getting freaked out? It’s fun. It gives me a little rush, but on my terms in a safe and controlled environment. It’s like microdosing danger–would I ever go underground to explore an abandoned bunker? Fuck no, but I liked to imagine what that would be like if I did. 

I knew I was a little jumpier than usual when I reacted to a sound outside my bedroom window with a gasp. It sounded like an acorn that fell from the tree and bumped the glass on the way down. Because that’s more than likely what it was. I lived in an old house in an old neighborhood with very tall, mature trees. It was a pain in the ass cleaning my gutters and hiring tree trimmers, but I loved having trees in my hard. It was extremely common for debris (dead branches, acorns) to fall off the trees and hit my house if it was windy or stormy–and there had been steady but random thumps all throughout the evening. I shuddered a little with the heebie-jeebies despite chuckling under my breath at my silly nerves. 

Brushing off some more thump sounds, I closed the tab of the story I had just finished. I went down the list of posted stories methodically, opening them one at a time in a new tab to ensure I wouldn’t skip or miss anything. The links would of course become gray and faded once I clicked them, so the unread ones were white (if you use Chrome in dark mode). Which was why I found it strange that when I returned to the main page in the original tab, there was a link to a story that I had not yet clicked on. The title was right there in white. I swore it was not there before–I was certain I would have opened it in a new tab. I remembered the story about the astronaut that was right above the post and the story about the campers that was right below it. But there it was in the middle, unclicked. So naturally I tapped to open in a new tab and started reading. 

*The room is dim, lit only by the pale glow of the lamp on the nightstand, with a flickering alarm clock casting a red glow over a half-empty glass of water. A queen-sized bed sits in the center adorned with a dark green plaid blanket slightly tangled up in the sheets. The mismatched dresser in a different shade of wood than the nightstand is flush against the wall on the left side of the bed, boasting a few dusty knick knacks and keepsakes on top. The door to the ensuite bathroom is ajar, where a thin sliver of moonlight illuminates the floor. He’s laying in his bed, facing away from me, lost in whatever he’s doing on his phone. It’s almost too easy. The way he keeps glancing at the window, but never truly seeing me. I’ve been here for hours, standing still, barely breathing. He doesn’t know I’m watching, not yet.*

I immediately sat up in my bed, feeling my stomach drop. It was a perfect description of my bedroom. It was definitively, unmistakably my bedroom. My chest felt tight as pins and needles of anxiety formed in my extremities. My brain instantly went to write this off as a joke. It had to be a prank right? One of my friends was messing with me. The thought did nothing to quell the adrenaline racing through my body. My phone slipped out my now sweaty hand and fell to the floor. I bent down to get it, the loud noise startling me out of my frightened trance. My reflection stared back at me from the black screen as I unlocked my phone. I hadn’t meant to keep reading the story, but something in the next paragraph caught my eye. 

*The man stirs, sitting up in bed as the dim light from his phone casts shadows across the room. The phone slips from his hands, hitting the floor with a dull thud. He leans forward, his head and shoulders dipping out of sight as he reaches down to retrieve it, the faint glow illuminating the edge of the mattress.*

I heard another thump and whipped my head towards my window while simultaneously leaping out of bed, cowering with my back up against the wall. I stayed there for a few moments, listening for any other noises as there was nothing I could see with my blinds shut. Silence. My breath shaking, I slowly crept towards the only window in my room, careful not to make a sound. With my heart pounding, I crouched down and ever so slightly lifted the bottom of my blinds to peak out the window. It was a pitch black night, but my flood lights were on, so I could pretty much see my whole yard. 

There was nothing. 

Slightly more confident, I reached for the string and fully opened my blinds. I took a deep breath and really scanned my yard, focusing on every detail possible. It was totally empty from what I could see. I quickly shut the blinds and started checking every window of my house–the kitchen, the living room, the guest room, both bathrooms–and each time I found nothing. I checked my front, side, and garage door. They were all locked. I walked back to my room and sat at the foot of my bed, unlocking my phone to quickly exit Chrome (not wanting to see any more of the story) and pull up my security camera app. I had four different cameras angled on each side of the house to give me almost full visibility of the perimeter. The feed showed nothing out of the ordinary. There was no movement other than the rustling of flora from the wind. I exhaled a gust of air and sat back down on my bed. I felt chagrined for letting my paranoia get the best of me. There had to be a rational explanation. It could be a massive, once-in-a-lifetime coincidence. And I hadn’t moved on from the idea that it could be a friend playing an extremely well-thought out joke. 

I looked at my phone and opened the story back up, averting my eyes from any of the text, and clicked on the OP’s username. The story was their only post. No followers, no comments, no activity at all except for this one story. Should I call the police? And say what exactly? After some deliberating, I decided to casually message a few of my friends who I could maybe see doing something like this. But it was very late and a week night; only one friend responded to say that he was babysitting his nephew while his brother and sister and law went out for their anniversary. The likelihood of one of my friends pulling a prank this elaborate on me was very low, so I rationalized that this just had to be one hell of a spooky coincidence. 

I took another deep breath, realizing what I had to do. But before that, I double checked my entire house one more time. I checked all the locks, looked outside all the windows, turned on all the lights, investigated every possible hiding spot, opened up all my closets and cabinets, and examined my security camera feed before I felt comfortable enough to go back to the story. Ashamedly, I crawled into my bedroom closet and shut the door after turning on the light. It did make me feel a little bit better that the safe with my gun was in here. My hands were shaking as I went back to finish reading the story. 

*His heart thuds in his chest as he creeps through the house, the floorboards groaning under his cautious steps. Every shadow seems to shift as he passes, every creak of the settling walls a whisper of unseen movement. He checks the locks on the doors—once, twice, then again—and peers out the windows, his breath fogging the glass. The silence presses against his ears as he moves from room to room, opening closets and glancing behind furniture, certain he wasn’t alone. Yet no matter how many places he checks, the feeling of being watched only grows stronger.*

“Fuck!” I yelled as I threw my phone down, scrambling on all fours to my safe. I pressed the code, flinging the door open, and hurriedly loaded six bullets into my grandad’s .357 revolver. On the verge of hyperventilating, I crawled back to my phone and opened the tab to read the next paragraph. 

*Desperation claws at him as he slips into the bedroom closet, slamming the door shut. He crouches low, his knees brushing against the rough carpet, the scent of old fabric and cedar filling the cramped space. Clad in thin plaid pajama pants and a wrinkled white T-shirt that clung to his damp skin, he hugs his knees to his chest. His bare feet are cold, the chill seeping into him as he strains to hear beyond the muffled thud of his own heartbeat. His hands tremble as he pulls his phone from his pocket, the faint glow of the screen casting a blue tint on his face. As he unlocks the screen, his breath catches. The words stare back at him: "He forgot to check the attic." A loud thump above him breaks the silence.*
