I know that you may have read a title like that before. Maybe in an interview on a website run by conspiracy theorists. Maybe on a news report on some obscure station in a small town. But this? This is real. In September of 2005, my brother was 14 years old. He had turned 14 the month before. I was 12. I won’t lie to you and say that I was some hero who attempted to save him, or that we shared one final goodbye. I just woke up and he was missing. My mom was crying her eyes out while my dad contacted every phone number in the county. We turned the property upside down trying to find any possible clues towards his location, but found nothing. No note, no items, no footprints. You also may expect me to say that we magically located him, but no. In 2012, my brother was pronounced dead. I was 19 then. Since then, I moved out of our hometown, to a new place, a few miles out of Salt Lake City. I got a job working at a McDonald’s recently, and was on the night shift. We were just outside of the largest place in Utah, so naturally, we had very little activity. I was in the back, handling the drive-thru, while Tom, a co-worker, ran the registers. We also had a cook on shift who we rarely actually saw. We were making smalltalk because we all knew that there would likely be no customers during our shift, as it was 3:22 AM, and nobody was eating McDonald’s at 3:22 AM.

“So, Tom, where did you grow up?” I asked.

“Born and raised in Salt Lake City, moved out here to try and live on my own. What about you?”

I paused. I somehow never thought about the question being reciprocated. I looked back at Tom, who had a questioning look on his face. My heart began to beat faster.

“I’d rather not talk about that.” I replied.

“I see.” Tom says.

I pull out my phone and open Facebook, to see what my friends and family have been up to.

I see a post mentioning that it has been 17 years since my brother went missing. I decided that it would be a better idea to just finish my shift and go home. As expected, very little occurred that night at my shift. The same can’t be said for when I got home, though. By the time I had gotten home, it was 5:16. Of course, mail isn’t delivered that early, so I was confused to notice a small letter at my doorstep. I knew for a fact that there was no letter earlier that I missed. I picked it up and entered my house. I decided to get some rest before checking out the letter, so I went to sleep, and woke up around noon. After making myself lunch, I sat down to inspect the letter. It was somewhat dirty, and was hand written.

“Dear \_\_\_\_, I know this may come as a surprise, but I am your brother. I had to leave the house because it wasn’t safe there. Not for me. You may wonder why it was safer for a 13 year old to be in the wild and not home, but that’s a long story. I would love to catch up with you whenever you have free time. Please come drop by at \_\_\_\_\_\_, Salt Lake City. Love, \_\_\_\_\_\_”

I couldn’t believe the words I was reading. Without a second thought, I grabbed my phone, charger, and got in my car. I began to drive towards the address outlined in the letter, and realized it was the more desolate and lesser populated part of the city. No matter. Eventually, I arrived at the address, being a smaller house that looked somewhat old. I admit that I may have been speeding, but in my defense, this was huge. I pulled into the empty driveway and got out. I went up to the door and knocked on it. No response. I tried again. Nothing. I got ready to try a third time when the door opened. There stood my brother, looking somewhat sickly. I hugged him without sharing any words. To skip the boring part, we caught up on the years he was gone, with him claiming to work at a Lowe’s in the area. I told him some rumors I heard about weird things happening there after hours, but he had no knowledge of what I was talking about. I brushed it off and we continued. He then informed me that he had forgotten to get something from the store, and told me to watch TV while he went to pick it up. I complied, and turned the TV on. As he walked down the sidewalk outside, I turned to the TV to see what was playing: a news report.

“-citizens in the area claim that the shape-shifting creature mimicked a family member that was believed to be dead. They became suspicious when the ‘creature’ got smaller details wrong on the past of who it mimicked. The creature, if real, is believed to be in the Salt Lake City area.”

I stopped listening. The letter.

I pulled it out of my back pocket and re-read it.

“You may wonder why it was safer for a ***13 year old*** to be in the wild and not home, but that’s a long story."

He wasn’t 13, he was 14.

Suddenly, I heard keys jingling in the door. I quickly put the letter away and changed the channel.

“What’s up?” my “brother” asked

“Hey.” I replied

I had an idea. We used to have a secret handshake. He never forgot it then, even if we hadn’t done it in months. So, I tried it.

“Hey, you remember our secret handshake, right?”

“Uh.. Yeah.”

“Wanna try it again?”

“Sure.”

I initiated the handshake, and just as I thought, he was clueless. I broke into a cold sweat. I told him that I had to use the bathroom, and he pointed towards it. I locked myself inside and began typing this. I’m currently in “his” house, and I still don’t know what to do. Maybe he just got the details wrong due to something happening while he was gone that traumatized him? I don’t know. But what I do know is that I’m terrified out of my life right now. What should I do?
