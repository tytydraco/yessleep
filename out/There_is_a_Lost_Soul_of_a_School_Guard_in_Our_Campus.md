TW: Blood, Murder, Death

It was dark and all classrooms except for us were already empty. We were finishing a group project (these are extremely common in our country: staying in school until nighttime to finish projects), and decided to stay for the night since tomorrow's weekend and some of us had to go to church and/or were unavailable.

Everyone was busy with their own parts, and one of us said that we ran out of one material. Fortunately, there were some stores outside but near our campus and two of them decided to buy. But, not even five minutes later, they came running back at the classroom. We all exchanged glances, as the other two calmed themselves down — drinking water, and facing the fans.

Even though they said nothing, we already knew what happened.

There is this circulating rumor in our school that a guard was killed while roving around, and in the morning, he was found dead in one of the buildings. Plus, some rooms were ransacked and valuables were missing: meaning, they were robbed.

The weird part was, some of the students who found the body consecutively experienced nausea. This would've been a normal body reaction, except from the fact that they also tried to kill themselves with scissors, cutters, and such. This went on for about a week. These students were taken to the mental hospital, and even priests got involved to bless the building.

One of them, who tried to cut his arteries with a small blade, said that he couldn't remember what happened that time. It was as if it waa no longer his soul that occupied the body. When he woke up, he saw people — doctors and his fellow students — on the same white room as him.

This story has been most popular paranormal thing in our school. Some believes in it, while others think of it as just another false narrative. That used to be me. I wasn't the type to believe in horror stories, and I was positive that ghosts, souls, etc. weren't true. It was until when I first encountered a paranormal experience.

It was the same as this one. We were finishing a school project and accidentally stayed until dark. We were on our way home, and heard footsteps on a concrete path. We also saw a light that looks like flashlight pointing at a certain direction — the building were the guard was 'killed.'

All of us felt shivers in our spine, and decided to get out of the campus as soon as possible.

Today is probably the 7th time we've experienced this. We just got used to it, and thanked that this time, it wasn't as bad as the 4th encounter. Although we were scared, we decided to continue the project and eventually finished it. We then walked to the entrance gate — since the exit was already closed — and told one of the guards (also the dead one's friend) of what happened.

He said that we should avoid staying til dark in the school. He has been saying this everytime he sees us going home late, and we've been ignoring it because the guard probably just wanted justice and had no intention to harm us (except from that time where he almost killed those students, and traumatized the shit out of them). After all, he was known as a good person before his death.
