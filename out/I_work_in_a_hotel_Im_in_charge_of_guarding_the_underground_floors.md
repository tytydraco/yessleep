Have you ever felt true terror?

For my part, over the last week, experiences that have passed my fear threshold and almost made me faint have become all too common, to a point where I have questioned quitting this job.

But first the basics, I haven't introduced myself, my name is Alan, nothing special. I've gone through many simple jobs, from actor in a haunted house to dishwasher in a barely decent restaurant, not having a college degree has become a heavy burden, but it's not like I had much of a choice with my family's economic condition.

I currently work at a well-known hotel in a certain mid-sized city. This place is the typical hotel you see in the movies, a yellowish and brown color palette, dozens of floors with a good number of rooms on each floor, and a huge front desk with good service.

I think this place is somewhere between 4 and 5 stars? Even they are not clear where to place themselves, but I would say they are closer to 5 stars.

I'm a bellhop here, or at least that's what my ID says. The reality is that I get paid more than the others. However that doesn't make anyone envious, rather they seem relieved that they don't have this "special position" even with the increase in pay.

The regular employees take care of floors 1 to 50. Those are the busiest floors and the only ones in existence in the eyes of the public.

However, a minority of lucky employees are in charge of floors different from the rest, the hotel officially calls them the negative floors, ranging from the front desk to an unknown destination underground.

I have eavesdropped on some rumors that these floors were not built by the hotel and only appeared on opening day, but they are just that, rumors. Or so I hope.

The truth is that for the week I've been here, I've been begging on my knees for my boss to move me to the regular floors, but even if I try to forget it, reality is cruel. I don't have the qualifications for any position in this luxury hotel. I was only accepted as someone who takes care of the negative floors.

Okay, I guess you'll be confused at this point, I would be too if some weirdo told me such absurd things about his job without any basis. So let's go back to where it all started. My first day on the job. Imagine a humble young man, innocently walking into a luxury hotel, ready to receive his first day on the job with his eyes shining.

At the time I was ignorant of what this hotel was hiding. I went through the back employee entrance and immediately introduced myself to the attendant, he flashed me a look of disbelief.

"You're new here, aren't you?" he asked me as he saw me confused by his expression. "Have they explained to you what your job is about?" he continued, I just shook my head and then he let out a sigh, called someone else to cover his position and took me to a secluded spot. Where he explained to me how my responsibilities differed from those of the other employees.

It was actually quite simple, I just had to patrol the floors from -1 to -50 on the established schedule. What left me puzzled about this encounter was how my boss (that's what he called him now) put special emphasis on the -50 floor limit and warned me that I would never go beyond that. In case I did, I was to retrace my steps as fast as I could and report to management immediately.

I am not alone in this, we are 8 bellhops in charge of the negative floors, each in a respective time of 3 hours to perform the patrol through the floors, since we don't have to enter any rooms and the corridors are straight, we can make the tour without problems in the set time if we make an effort, otherwise, we can go up to an hour over the time limit without too much trouble from the boss, as long as the next employee follows the normal schedule.

But oddly enough, I've barely had any contact with the other bellhops on the negative floors. They always stick to the schedule and are very evasive with each other, so socializing with them is almost impossible.

Going back to the first day, after listening to the boss's warnings and being guided to a rather strange room (it was a smaller, empty reception area with a door on one side leading to stairs like you normally see in the hotel) I couldn't help but be amazed at the attention to detail and cleanliness even back here.

The boss handed me the uniform (which was a shade darker than the normal buttons), a flashlight, a radio, a pocket watch and a small greasy sheet, which looked like it had been in use for years.

 Most things did not surprise me, the pocket watch seemed unusual but I still accepted it, however, the greasy sheet was something different.

It was a list of rules and regulations for special employees.

First rule: Always be punctual in your schedule, not a minute more nor a minute less in the entry time, keep a constant tour and keep an eye out for any anomaly, if you find one, report it immediately over the radio.

Second rule: It is strictly forbidden to communicate by any means other than the radio while on the negative floors. 

Third rule: All rooms have lamps at the door, you can walk without worry through a door if the lamp is off. But if it is on, keep as much distance as you can and pass it as quickly as possible in silence.

Fourth rule: Never open a door with a lamp on.

Fifth rule: Some floors may have lights out when you get to them. Turn on the flashlight and walk slowly but steadily following the above rules. In case the flashlight starts to flicker, do not hesitate and hide in a room with the lamp off, block the door with whatever is at your disposal and call for help on the radio.

Sixth rule: If you enter a floor and there are no stairs to the next floor, search all available rooms until you find it and go down it. Report the situation over the radio when you reach the next floor.

Seventh rule: Stairs both up and down have yellow lamps on them. If any stairway has a different color, regardless of direction, find the stairway going up and once on the top floor report the situation over the radio, remember, only the stairway going up.

Eighth rule: Some floors may have a labyrinthine layout when you pass through them, don't be weirded out by it and explore looking for anything that shouldn't be there, you'll know it when you see it. If there is nothing, locate the stairway down and continue on your route, if there is, hide in a room and report on the radio.

Ninth rule: If you run into or feel the presence of something strange on the floor, flee immediately, report the situation over the radio.

Tenth rule: If at any time you lose consciousness and awaken beyond the -50 floor, do not panic and look at your pocket watch, if it has been less than an hour since you passed out, you may cautiously return to the -50 floor and continue on your way up to report to management. If it has been more than an hour, do not backtrack and keep moving through the floors until you find a stairway up or down with a green lamp, go for it. It is advisable never to go beyond the 75th floor. If you reach it and have not found it, do the same route in the opposite direction and keep repeating the cycle until you find the stairway. If more than 3 hours have passed since you passed out, keep going down and survive, if you are lucky, you may find someone to help you get back.

I took five whole minutes to read word for word and suddenly burst out laughing. At the time, I just thought it was an innocent joke for the new employees, but the serious look on the boss's face shut me up.

My shift was from 6PM (6PM) to 9PM (9PM). It was barely 8AM, so I was quite some time away from starting my shift. By the time the boss introduced me to the place and, as miraculous as it sounds, gave me a room.

A room in a 4 star luxury hotel. Three free meals a day and good pay, at that moment, all I could think about was what a dream job looked like.

I couldn't have been more wrong...

My first shift soon arrived, I stood on the stairs and immediately the clock struck 6PM, I started down the steps equipped with my uniform and other items I received.

I was carrying the rule sheet slightly folded in a pocket, I decided to leave this "joke" aside for the moment and concentrate on my work.

My first day was... Relaxed, I guess? At least compared to the others.

On the -27th floor, after having done what was in the rules and avoided the doors with lights during the previous floors, something strange happened. As soon as I set foot on the floor, the lights in the hallway suddenly flickered and went out all at once.

This scared me, I may not be superstitious, but having the lights go out 27 floors underground, while you are alone, would scare anyone, wouldn't it? With some anxiety I turned on the flashlight and continued my walk, the hallway was straight and I could see the yellow lamp over the staircase going down, but each step felt like an eternity.

How do I explain it? It was as if thousands of eyes were watching me from the shadows that my flashlight could not reveal, as if there was something behind me and it was breathing down my neck. But at the same time there was a contradictory feeling in my mind, my rationality told me it was just my paranoia and the guilt of this stupid list of rules.

Soon I was going to reach the stairs. But the worst happened, the flashlight suddenly started to flicker and a strange bellowing sound was heard all over the floor, a bellowing sound that seemed to shake even the soul of those who would listen.

My mind was blank, but my body reacted, soon I was in front of a door with lamp out and I opened it, closing it behind me with force and producing an uproarious sound.

After that there was another sound, like thousands of worms crawling through the darkness of the hallway, getting closer and closer to the room where I hid.

In my horror, I grabbed a chair from the table in the room and placed it against the doorknob, but that didn't seem to be enough. The creeping sound soon came in front of the door and began to knock. An unfamiliar, female voice spoke, asking me to open the door, saying she wanted to see me and tell me the things we hadn't been able to talk about for so long, but I just kept silent.

Yes, of course. I'm going to open the door for an unknown person who makes a distinctly non-human shuffling sound as she moves, still dreaming.

The voice kept talking, but the knocking on the door intensified to a non-human point. It was as if dozens of hands were pounding on the door, trying to break it down.

Every cell in my body was screaming at me about the impending danger, soon both the table and a shelf were in front of the door, I brought all the objects I thought might help me block the door, my arms hurt like hell from carrying so much, but that was nothing compared to the fear I felt.

The door was shaking violently as if it could collapse in an instant, I dragged the bed with all my strength and put it in front of all the previous objects, adding one more support. However, without giving me time to retreat, a hole is smashed through the door.

A bloody but delicate looking human arm broke through, the nails are worn down and the skin has an ashen gray color, the smell of blood reaches me and for some reason my body stops listening to me.

The arm soon withdraws and a pupil-less eye peers through the opening. That eye is fixed on me, as if it can see through everything in this world.

"You are not Marcus," the voice said, as it slowly changed its tone. "Where is Marcus?"

At that moment I couldn't say anything, I was paralyzed with horror as I clearly saw that pupil-less eyes turn completely black and in the center, a red dot like a pupil emerged in the middle.

"Oh, so you don't know anything" the voice soon transforms into a grotesque, gravelly voice, as if the previous one was just an act. "I guess Marcus has been eaten by something else, then" The voice finally says as his eye peels away from me.

It soon moves away from the hole and continues on its way down the hallway as both the female voice and the grotesque voice sing an overlapping song.

"My beloved Marcus has been taken from me, my life has been taken away"

"My precious food has been devoured by a usurper, the darkness will not be silent."

The voice gets softer as it gets further away and soon both the hallway light and the room light come on, I stare at the hole for a while before collapsing on the floor, causing the greasy list of rules to fall out of my pocket.

I glance at it and feel like crying, what kind of place have I gotten myself into, is this a nightmare?

But deep down I knew it was not. My eyes soon fix on rule 4 and I hold the radio in front of me, turn it on and hear a couple of voices talking casually. I figure it's either the other bellhops or the boss, at this point I'm not sure of anything anymore.

"Situation on the floor... -27" He spoke almost on the verge of collapse and the voices soon go quiet, soon a deeper voice appears above the rest, similar to the boss, asking what's going on.

"Rule 4... Darkness... A black eye... I can't go on anymore" I say almost on the verge of tears and a moment later the boss's voice is heard along with hurried footsteps.

Several minutes later both the boss and a group of workers I saw at the fake reception before going downstairs appear, look through the hole in the door and find me. I remove everything blocking it and let out a sigh.

"Tell me the truth, what kind of hell did I come to work in?"

...

The rest of my first day's shift was taken by the noon bellhop in exchange for double the day's pay. The boss was quite reasonable and found my situation understandable, so he let me rest without putting me to any trouble.

I considered leaving, but due to my and my family's financial situation, I could not afford to let such good pay go, along with free lodging. So in the end I made the decision to stay.

I had to accept the list of rules as something to take seriously and thanks to that I managed to survive, at least for this week. I also found out about what happened in the dark. That thing is called "Mimic" and it is one of the reasons for rule 4, although it is not common to see it. That thing is not a stupid monster, it takes the form of what a person loves most.

That thing seemed to have learned everyone's schedules by heart and knew what form to take for each one. Marcus was my predecessor, as for the reason for his retirement, he had none. That man disappeared while on patrol near the -50th floor a week ago. He was presumed dead and that's when I showed up, looking for a job. You can imagine what happened.

I didn't want to get depressed and didn't think too much about it, but I was still worried. I spent the rest of the week like hell on earth, I ran into rules 4 through 8. The boss considers me lucky I didn't run into anything related to rule 9 or 10.

This hotel is disturbing and the things I saw while exploring were terrifying, but somehow I managed to adapt, which in other words means not fainting right away you will find something scary.

This is bellhop number 7 for the day, praying that I don't meet with any accidents while I'm still working.
