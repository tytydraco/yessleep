So, I stumbled across this thread last night, buried deep in some obscure horror subreddit. Some woman, Alicia, was ranting about this "demon clown" named Jepson Bone. Honestly, it sounded like your typical made-up ghost story, the kind that pops up every Halloween. Dead people can't write, right? And another "cursed" story? Come on.

She went on about some abandoned prison in Nevada, saying it was like those creepy staircases in the woods – out of place, a tear in reality. Apparently, this Jepson Bone was buried alive there, his spirit trapped and all that. She even mentioned a cursed documentary that unleashed him on the world. *The Ring* with a clown, basically. What a fuckin eye roll, right?

But here's the thing. As I was reading, something started to feel… off. She kept mentioning details that seemed oddly specific, things that weren't explained, like inside jokes in a conversation I wasn't privy to. And the way she described the prison… it gave me the creeps, even though I've never been to Nevada.

Then, the last post. Just one word: "Waiting." And that was it. Her account is gone now. Poof. Like it never existed. I tried searching for news articles, anything about a woman named Alicia dying because of some haunting in Nevada, but nothing.

Okay, so, I actually found a photo of Alicia. Turns out, she was pretty attractive. Landon was one lucky dude. And, attached to the pic, there was an obituary. Of course I checked it out, but it was vague – no cause of death, and no mention of any "Jepson Bone." Typical ghost story stuff.

Then, my friend Quentin, ever the morbid one, tracked down the prison Alicia was talking about on Google Maps. The "Killing Floor," she called it. I even jokingly "cursed" him, just to show him how ridiculous I thought the whole thing was. Famous last words, right?

Quentin spotted something truly horrifying. If you zoom in on the prison windows on Google Maps… you can see *Alicia's face* pressed up to the dirty glass. Or, what's left of it. Her eyes… they look like they've been gouged out. The optic nerves are just… dangling there. Like worms. Seriously messed up. 

Suddenly, her last say, "I'll be seeing you here soon," hit me like a ton of bricks. Quentin and I were both completely freaked out, but, you know, morbid curiosity and all that. We're both pretty good researchers, so we decided to dig deeper. I still think it's probably some elaborate hoax, some horror fan's twisted idea of a creepypasta. I've definitely read better. But… that image… I can't get it out of my head.

As I was researching, I came across a strange article that he shared with Quentin. It was published a month after Alicia's disappearance. Here is the article:

**Cursed Film Responsible for Disappearances?**

*By Charles Wayne Dahmer, Saint Holland Daily*

A chilling pattern is emerging, one that has authorities baffled and whispers of the occult growing louder. Since the release of the independent documentary *Paradox*, a disturbing number of individuals connected to the film, or even those who have simply *watched* it, have vanished without a trace.

While official explanations range from accidental deaths to elaborate disappearances, the statistics paint a far more sinister picture. The disappearance rate among those associated with *Paradox* is over 300% higher than the national average for similar demographics. And it's not just those directly involved in the film's production. Viewers, too, seem to be at risk. Online forums dedicated to the documentary are filled with increasingly frantic posts from individuals reporting strange occurrences after watching *Paradox* – nightmares, unexplained noises, a constant feeling of being watched. Some have even claimed to see fleeting glimpses of a figure described as a "grotesque clown."

Law enforcement agencies in multiple states are now investigating these disappearances, but the lack of physical evidence has hampered their efforts. "It's like they've simply vanished into thin air," commented one anonymous detective involved in the investigation. "We've got no leads, no witnesses, and in most cases, no bodies."

Adding to the mystery is the Vatican's unusual interest in the film. Sources within the Church have confirmed that they have requested, through back channels, that all copies of *Paradox* be destroyed. While the Vatican has declined to comment officially, rumors persist that they believe the film contains something… malevolent. Something that could unleash a truly ancient evil.

*Paradox* explores a series of strange occurrences at an abandoned prison in Nevada, a location known locally as "The Killing Floor." The film's director, Landon Hughes, vanished just years after its release. His girlfriend, Alicia Thorne (no relation to this journalist), also disappeared shortly thereafter. Their disappearances were initially dismissed as a tragic accident, but the growing number of similar cases has led many to question the official narrative.

I've seen Paradox, and I have to say, the visuals are deeply unsettling. The movie has a strange, almost mesmerizing quality, and it left me with a profound sense of unease. While I know that correlation doesn't necessarily mean causation, the sheer volume of disappearances connected to this film is hard to dismiss. It's not just that they filmed something evil; they also notoriously left out the footage of one of their own crew members being killed. Even the Vatican sent exorcists to bless the land where it was filmed, and there are rumors that those exorcists themselves have fallen victim to the curse.

Are we dealing with a string of bizarre coincidences? Or is there something far more sinister at play? This investigation is ongoing, and I will continue to report on any new developments. But one thing is clear: *Paradox* is more than just a film. It's a warning. If something happens to me… you’ll know why. But now, it's on you. And I'm sorry, but I'll be seeing you on the Killing Floor.

"Seriously," I said, shaking my head. "They went to the place this thing came from, made a movie about it, released it, and now thousands of people are disappearing because of it? And nobody thought once to just knock the prison down? Or dig the thing up and properly bury it? It seems so… simple, compared to all the movie stuff I've seen. That's why I'm skeptical. These stories always have holes, but this one's practically a fishing net." 

That's when I thought I heard a giggle, thin and sharp as shattered glass, drifting in from beyond my window. My breath hitched. I spun around, heart hammering against my ribs, fully expecting to see… *something*. But there was nothing. Just the black, indifferent night staring back at me. Except… was there a flicker of movement at the edge of my vision? A shadow that seemed to detach itself from the darkness and coalesce into a vaguely humanoid shape? I blinked, trying to clear my vision, but it was gone. Just my imagination, I told myself, but a prickle of ice-cold dread crawled up my spine, whispering that I wasn't alone. 

"Dude, you okay? You just went silent for like a minute," Quentin's voice crackled through Discord. "Everything good?"

"Yeah, yeah, just… thought I heard something," I replied, trying to sound casual. "Probably just the wind."

"Alright, if you say so," Quentin said, but I could hear the skepticism in his tone. "Anyway, about this prison… I dug up some more stuff. It's weird, man. Really weird."

"Weirder than demon clowns and cursed movies?"

"Possibly," Quentin said. "Apparently, the land the prison's built on has a *history*. Like, a really messed up history. It's… it's like random bits of history just keep manifesting there. At one point, it was a cathedral, then a cemetery, then some kind of… house? A shed? The records are all patchy, but the one constant, the one thing that shows up in every single document, is the name: 'The Killing Floor.'"

"So, it's like… the land itself is cursed?"

"That's what it's starting to look like," Quentin said. "And it gets even crazier. Apparently, whatever's going on there, it can… change its disguise. Like, it was a cathedral, but then it just… *became* a cemetery. No one knows how or why. It's like the place is… alive, or something."

"Okay, so, think of it like this," Quentin's voice came through the Discord, patient as always. "Imagine the land where the prison is, right? It's like… a magnet for weirdness. Throughout history, different things have popped up there. A church, a graveyard, even a house at one point. Nobody knows why, it's just… *there*. And every time something new appears, it's like the land keeps the same name, 'The Killing Floor'. It's always 'The Killing Floor', no matter what's built on it."

He paused, probably taking a breath. "It's like the *land* itself is messed up, cursed, or something. And the craziest part? It changes. Like, one minute it's a church, then boom, it's a graveyard. It's like the place is… shifting. Nobody knows how. It just… *does*."

"Dude, shit was going down *way* before all that, apparently," Quentin said, his voice laced with a mixture of awe and dread. "We're talking centuries, man. Long before the cathedral, the cemetery, even before 1888. Back when traveling entertainers were more common than established theaters, people were already terrified of that patch of desert. They thought it was a gateway to hell, or something. Can you imagine? No prison, no church, just… this empty, cursed piece of land that people were already avoiding."

He paused, letting the information sink in. "And get this – people have been dying in that *exact same spot* for centuries. You know, people die in the desert all the time, right? Heat, accidents, whatever. But it's freaky how these bodies, from different eras, different circumstances, keep turning up in the *same* place. It's like… the land itself is a magnet for death."

"So, you're saying…" I started, my voice barely a whisper. The implications were too horrifying to even contemplate.

"I'm saying," Quentin said, his voice grim, "that Jepson Bone might not just be some random demon clown. He might be something… older. Something… *worse*. The article I found calls them the *Letum Ridens* – the Laughing Death. Apparently, they're mentioned in some obscure Kabbalistic texts, not as angels in the traditional sense, but as fallen entities, corrupted by some primordial darkness. The texts describe them as shapeshifters, able to manifest in various forms, but their preferred guise is that of a jovial entertainer, a clown or jester. They use this disguise to gain trust, to lull their prey into a false sense of security before… before they strike."

He paused, and I could hear him shuffling papers. "The article claims they're not just interested in physical bodies, either. They feed on fear, on despair, on the very *soul* of their victims. It even cites some disturbing statistics, though I'm not sure how accurate they are. It says that in cultures where these… beings… were prevalent, there was a significantly higher rate of mental illness, suicide, and even unexplained disappearances. It's like their presence corrupts the very air around them."

"And the clown thing… the colors, the makeup?" I asked, my voice trembling slightly.

"Apparently, it's all part of the act," Quentin said. "The bright colors, the exaggerated features… it's designed to appeal to our most primal instincts. To trigger a sense of joy, of playfulness. It's a mask, hiding something truly monstrous beneath. The article even suggests a connection to certain ancient pagan rituals, sacrifices disguised as celebrations… It's all starting to fit together, man. Jepson Bone, the prison, the disappearances… it's all connected. Think about it – even the Bible talks about the 'angel of death' appearing in different forms. These *Letum Ridens*… it's like they're twisting that concept, perverting it. Instead of bringing righteous judgment, they offer a twisted parody of joy before they deliver utter destruction."

"Think about it," Quentin continued, his voice taking on a global perspective. "It's not just happening in Nevada. There are similar accounts from all over the world. It makes you wonder… maybe Jepson Bone isn't the only one. Maybe there are others like him, these *Letum Ridens*, haunting different corners of the world."

He paused, scrolling through something on his screen. "Look at this. In Siberia, there's this stretch of road where people have reported seeing a spectral carnival appear out of thin air, complete with clowns and all. It's always in the same spot, then it vanishes just as quickly as it arrived. People who've seen it… they've disappeared shortly after. Then there's this case in China. A group of villagers, found lined up along a bridge, hung, their faces carved into grotesque smiles, almost like… clown makeup. No one knows who did it, or why. But it's chillingly similar to what's happening at the Killing Floor."

"So, these *Letum Ridens*… they're everywhere?" I asked, a chill running down my spine.

"Maybe not everywhere," Quentin said. "But it seems like they're… scattered. Pockets of evil, manifesting in different ways, but all connected by the same thread. The clown motif, the disappearances, the mutilations… it's like a twisted, global network of horror."

As Quentin spoke, a chill deeper than any I'd ever felt settled over me. It wasn't just the stories, the articles, the chilling implications of what he was saying. It was something else, something in the room with me. The air grew heavy, charged with a static electricity that made the hairs on my arms stand on end. A faint scent, like stale popcorn and cheap perfume, drifted into my nostrils, making me gag. I glanced around, but everything looked normal. Or… almost normal.

A shadow flickered in the corner of my eye. I whipped my head around, but it was gone. Just my imagination, I told myself, but my heart was pounding against my ribs like a trapped bird. Then, I noticed it. On my desk, right in front of me, a single playing card had appeared. The Joker. Its painted smile seemed to stretch wider than usual, the eyes glinting with malevolent amusement. I hadn't had a deck of cards in this room for years. As I stared at it, a low, guttural chuckle seemed to echo from the darkest corner of the room, sending a wave of pure terror through me. I wasn't alone.

"Quentin?" I whispered, my voice trembling. "Did you… did you hear that?"

Silence. Only the faint hum of my computer and the frantic beating of my own heart.

"Quentin, are you there?" I asked again, louder this time.

Still nothing. Just the unnerving silence that stretched on and on, punctuated only by my ragged breaths. I felt a cold sweat break out on my forehead. He wouldn't just leave. Not after what we'd been discussing. Something was wrong.

Then, I heard it again. The giggle. That same thin, sharp sound, like glass breaking, but this time… it was coming from the Discord call. From Quentin's microphone. It was right there, in my headphones, echoing in my ears, chilling me to the bone.

A cold dread washed over me. All my skepticism, all my dismissive jokes about ghost stories and curses… it was all coming back to haunt me. The pieces were falling into place, each one more terrifying than the last. The chilling details of Alicia's posts, the horrifying image on Google Maps, the article about the *Letum Ridens*, the stories of similar encounters across the globe… and now, this. Quentin's silence, the laughter on the Discord call… it was all too much to dismiss as coincidence. My doubts had blinded me to the truth, and now, it was staring me in the face, a monstrous, grinning visage that promised nothing but pain and terror.

The laughter stopped as abruptly as it began, leaving a ringing silence in its wake. Then, Quentin's voice, slightly breathless, broke through the Discord. "Dude, sorry about that. Mom needed me to grab my laundry from the bathroom. Be right back."

My heart was still pounding in my chest. "Quentin," I said, my voice trembling, "you don't understand. I heard it. The laughter. It was on your end, on the call. He's there, in your room!"

"Whoa, chill out, man," Quentin chuckled. "What are you talking about? He's not in my room. I would know."

"Get out of the house, Quentin! Now! Call 911! This is real!" I shouted, my voice rising in panic.

"Dude, relax," Quentin said, still laughing. "You're freaking me out. It was probably just some weird echo or something. Besides," he added, "if some clown *did* break in, you know my dad would kill him. He's home, so we're safe. He's in the garage doing one of his woodshop projects."

"Quentin, please! Listen to me! I'm not joking!" I pleaded, trying to convey the sheer terror I felt. "I heard it, Quentin! The laughter! It was the same laugh I heard in my room! He's there, I'm telling you!"

I was starting to believe him, or at least trying to, until a sudden power surge hit us both. The lights flickered and died, plunging us into darkness. We were in two different houses, miles apart, yet the same thing happened. We both acknowledged the eerie coincidence, but were also grateful that, somehow, our video call hadn't been cut off.  

"Hang on," Quentin said, his voice shaky. He moved towards his window, the camera following him. "I'm going to check if anyone else lost power."

He peered out into the darkness, and I did the same, looking out my own window. The street was eerily silent. Every other house had their lights on, casting warm, inviting glows onto their lawns. We were the only ones plunged into darkness. The only ones with this… connection.

"It's just us," Quentin said, his voice barely a whisper. "Just our houses."

A chill ran down my spine. This wasn't just a random power surge. This was… targeted. And whatever was happening in Quentin's house… it was connected to me. To the story. To Jepson Bone.

Then, as the lights began to flicker back on, mine doing the same dance as his, a bloodcurdling scream echoed from another room in Quentin's house. A man's voice, raw with agony.

"Dad?" Quentin breathed, his voice laced with confusion and fear.

"Get the fuck out of there, dude!" I yelled, my heart leaping into my throat. "Now!" 

Through the camera lens, I watched Quentin scramble towards the garage, a desperate hope flickering in his eyes. He fumbled with the door, finally managing to wrench it open. And then… Jepson Bone was there. He moved with unnatural speed, grabbing Quentin like a discarded toy. There was no struggle, no resistance. He simply snatched him up. He also grabbed the phone, his painted smile widening as he looked directly at me through the screen. He gave a small, mocking wave. I couldn't move. I couldn't speak. Tears streamed down my face, but I couldn't bring myself to hang up. I was frozen, a helpless witness to the horror unfolding before me.

Jepson Bone placed the phone down, positioning it so I had a clear view of the carnage he was about to inflict. He lifted Quentin's body, effortlessly hoisting him up and anchoring him onto a thick, rusty hook that jutted out from the garage ceiling. The hook tore through the flesh of Quentin's back with a sickening rip, the sound amplified by the garage's acoustics. Quentin was hanging in the air, his body dangling grotesquely, held aloft by the single, agonizing point of contact. A torrent of blood erupted from the wound, gushing down his back and onto the concrete floor below. His screams were a symphony of pure terror, each one a ragged gasp for air. I could hear his parents screaming too, their voices laced with an unbearable mix of anguish and desperation, begging the demonic clown to spare their son, to end his suffering. But Jepson Bone just chuckled, a low, guttural sound that was more terrifying than any scream.

The camera angle was perfect, sickeningly so. It was as if Jepson Bone himself had staged the scene specifically for me, a horrifying display of cruelty. Quentin's mother was tied and bound, splayed out on the floor like a pig about to be roasted over a fire. Her eyes were wide with a terror so profound it seemed to have frozen her expression, her mouth gagged with a dirty rag. Nearby, Quentin's father was nailed to a large piece of plywood, naked and vulnerable. Chalk lines, like those used to outline a body at a crime scene, were drawn around his form. His face was contorted in a silent scream, his eyes pleading. The whole scene was bathed in the harsh, flickering light of the garage's single bare bulb, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe and twist with a life of their own. The air crackled with a palpable sense of dread, a thick, suffocating blanket of pure evil. It wasn't just the physical horror of the scene; it was the utter hopelessness etched on the faces of Quentin's parents, the knowledge that they were completely at the mercy of something utterly inhuman. And it was the chilling realization that I, trapped on the other side of the screen, was just as helpless as they were.  

Jepson Bone turned his attention back to Quentin, who was still dangling from the hook, his screams weakening with each passing second. He reached out, his gloved hands grasping Quentin's legs. With a slow, deliberate tug, he began to pull. Quentin's body stretched, his screams intensifying, each pull a fresh wave of agony. The sound of tearing flesh and bone echoed through the garage. Finally, with a sickening *rip*, Jepson Bone shoved the rest of Quentin's body downwards. The force of the fall, combined with the existing injuries, caused Quentin's body to split in half leaving only his legs attached by the pelvis, the two halves ended up splattering onto the cold cement floor with a wet, sickening *plop*. The agonizing screams were cut short, replaced by a gruesome silence. Quentin's parents could only watch in horrified silence as their son, their only son, the one thing that gave their lives purpose, was brutally murdered before their eyes. Their faces were masks of pure, unadulterated grief and despair.

Jepson Bone finished his gruesome work, cleanly separating Quentin's body like a wishbone. He then, with a flourish that was both theatrical and deeply disturbing, placed each half of Quentin's remains onto each side of his parents. As he did so, a length of Quentin's intestines, glistening and slick with blood, slithered out from the cavity of his bisected torso and plopped onto the floor beside his mother's head. The stench of steaming human meat and viscera filled the air. He turned back to the camera, his painted smile impossibly wide, and made a series of hand gestures. He held up two fingers, then brought them together, miming the joining of two halves. Then, he pointed at each piece of Quentin, then to his parents, and finally formed a heart shape with his hands. The message, though seemingly simple, resonated with a chilling, morbid undertone. It wasn't just about physical wholeness. It was about broken families, shattered lives, the pieces of a whole, now irrevocably torn apart. It was a mockery of love, a grotesque mockery of family unity. It was a whispered promise of further torment, the implication that they would be "whole" again, joined in suffering.

He then sauntered over to his father's toolbox, rummaging through it until he pulled out a nail gun and a small piece of wood. He approached Quentin's father, who remained strapped to the plywood, his eyes wide with terror.

Jepson Bone's smile widened, a parodied version of joy that reeked of depravity. He reached down, his gloved fingers closing around the father's genitals. He grasped them firmly, stretching the flesh grotesquely, elongating it in a way that made my stomach churn. The intent was clear, a violation so profound it made my breath catch in my throat. The father thrashed against the nails that held him pinned to the plywood, his struggles only intensifying his terror. The nails, driven through his wrists and ankles, bit deeper into his flesh with each frantic movement. He screamed, a muffled, desperate sound against the gag, his body contorting in a silent agony. Jepson Bone, oblivious to the father's suffering, or perhaps reveling in it, positioned the exposed flesh against the small block of wood he'd retrieved from the toolbox. He took careful aim, then, with a slow, deliberate press, pulled the trigger of the nail gun. The nail, thick and industrial-grade, shot through the father's penis, piercing the glans and embedding itself deep into the wood with a sickening thunk. The sound was wet and visceral, a testament to the brutal force used. Even with the gag, the father's whimpers were loud enough to be screams, a raw, animalistic cry of pain that echoed through the garage. His body convulsed, every muscle tensing in a futile attempt to escape the agonizing grip of the nail. But Jepson Bone wasn't finished. He readjusted the angle, then fired the nail gun again, and again, and again, each nail tearing through the tip of the father's penis, obliterating the urethra. The father's screams intensified, if that was even possible, a symphony of pure, unadulterated agony. Finally, as the father's bladder gave way, urine, mixed with a horrifying amount of blood, streamed down his leg in a grotesque wave.

The demon clown tilted his head slightly, as if surprised by what he'd just done, then made a series of quick hand gestures, a pantomime of "hold on a second, wait here." He sauntered over to a corner of the garage, rummaging through a pile of junk until he emerged with a flamethrower. It was a heavy-duty model, the kind used for industrial purposes, not some backyard barbecue. The father's eyes widened in terror, tears now streaming down his face as he understood what was coming. The mother, still forced to witness the gruesome remains of her son sprawled across her chest, seemed beyond shock. Her eyes were glazed over, a look of utter resignation in their depths. The fight had gone out of her the moment Quentin was… gone.

Jepson Bone returned to the father, grabbing the small block of wood and stretching the impaled flesh even further, extending the father's penis to an unnatural, almost obscene length. The skin stretched taut, threatening to tear. The father's whimpers intensified, a rising crescendo of pure agony. It wasn't just the pain; it was the humiliation, the utter violation of his body. Jepson Bone ignored his cries, casually flicking on the flamethrower. With a *whoosh*, the weapon roared to life, spitting out a stream of fire. The air filled with the acrid smell of burning flesh. He began to methodically char the father's elongated genitals, moving the flame up and down with a slow, deliberate motion. The skin sizzled and blackened, the flames licking at the delicate tissue. The father's screams were now guttural roars, his body jerking against the restraints as the fire consumed him. The smell of burning hair and cooked meat mingled with the coppery scent of blood, creating a sickening, suffocating atmosphere. Even though I wasn’t there, that energy was so damn powerful, even through the phone I could feel the dread linger, I could almost feel the pain, I can literally smell it through my imagination; I made the chilling realization that the curse had grown so powerful, it wasn't just contained to the Killing Floor anymore. It was… mobile. It was coming *here*. Or is it here, *already?* 

Paralyzed by fear, I could only watch. My body was frozen, my mind reeling. I fumbled for the house phone, my fingers clumsy and uncoordinated. I dialed 911, my heart pounding in my chest, but instead of a dial tone, all I heard was that same, chilling giggle. It was in the phone, in my ear, mocking me. I slammed the receiver down and tried calling my parents' cell phones, my hands shaking so badly I could barely press the buttons. No answer. They were home, I knew they were, but they weren't answering. The thought that they might be… that they might have already… was too much to bear.

I knew I should leave. I knew I should run. But I was terrified. Terrified of what might be waiting for me outside my room. Terrified that if I left, I would share Quentin's fate. The thought nagged at me, a chilling whisper in the back of my mind: if this thing could be in Quentin's house and on my phone at the same time, could it also be here, in my house, waiting for me? The fear was a living thing, a suffocating weight that held me captive. I was trapped, a prisoner in my own home, at the mercy of something I couldn't understand, something that seemed to defy the very laws of reality.

The demonic clown, with a gesture that dripped with cruel humor, admired his handiwork. He gazed at the charred penis, the skin blackened and shriveled, as the father, drenched in sweat and wracked with pain, moaned and gasped, begging for release. Jepson Bone patted the father's head condescendingly, then knelt down to observe his "creation," licking it with exaggerated relish, as if savoring a delicacy. He then looked over at the mother, his eyes gleaming with malicious intent. He grabbed the block of wood, the nail still embedded in the severed flesh, and with a swift, brutal motion, ripped it free, tearing the father's penis clean off. A spray of blood arced across the garage, splattering the walls and the floor. The father's screams intensified, a raw, animalistic sound that seemed to fuel Jepson Bone's twisted amusement.

He walked over to the mother, holding the severed penis towards her face as if offering her a taste. She recoiled, screaming, "Get the fuck away from me!" He persisted, shoving the grotesque offering closer to her face. She spat, the projectile landing squarely on the clown's painted cheek. Jepson Bone recoiled, his expression shifting from amusement to something akin to offense. But the change was fleeting. He quickly recovered, treating the whole interaction as a joke, placing his hands on his hips and wagging a finger at her as if scolding a child for being a picky eater. He then, with a gesture of casual cruelty, reached into the gaping cavity of Quentin's skull, scooping out handfuls of brain matter and gore. He forced the gruesome mixture down the mother's throat, ignoring her struggles and gagging. She dry-heaved, vomit erupting from her mouth, a torrent of bile, blood, and partially digested food raining down, mixed with fragments of her son's remains. Through the spasms and the horror, she managed to choke out one final, defiant curse: "Fuck clowns!"

Jepson Bone, his painted smile unwavering, grabbed the mother by her hair, yanking her head back. He dragged her across the garage floor to the other half of her son's torn body, the one still resting on her chest. He then, with a sickeningly deliberate motion, shoved her face deep into the gore, attempting to suffocate her in the remains of her child. Her muffled screams and struggles were weak, futile against his strength. However, the awkward positioning and the sheer volume of viscera prevented a clean suffocation. She continued to gasp for air, though each breath was a struggle, laced with the metallic tang of blood and the sickening stench of human anatomy. 

Jepson Bone, bored with the mother's lingering breaths, pressed down harder, grinding her face into the pulpy remains of her son. Her muffled whimpers ceased, her body going limp beneath him. As her eyes glazed over, a flicker of dark amusement danced in the clown's painted eyes. He decided to offer a swift, brutal end to her suffering, a grotesque mockery of compassion. He raised his foot, a heavy boot caked with gore, and brought it down with savage force. The impact was sickeningly precise, the heel connecting squarely with the back of her skull. The sound was bone-chilling: a wet, crunching *snap* followed by the distinct splintering of bone. A shard of Quentin's rib cage, driven by the monstrous force, punched through the back of her head, emerging from her forehead in a grotesque parody of a unicorn's horn. Her body gave one final, involuntary spasm, then stilled. The silence that followed was broken only by the sickening drip of blood and the soft squelch of flesh. Jepson Bone yanked her head up, the shard of bone still protruding obscenely. It wouldn't budge. He gripped the protruding bone, twisting with sickening force, the sound of grinding bone and tearing flesh echoing through the garage. He maneuvered her head like a grotesque puppet, the shard of rib now acting as a macabre handle. Then, with a flourish, as if performing a macabre magic trick, he produced a gun from seemingly nowhere. He aimed it at the father. He pulled the trigger, but instead of a bang, a small flag popped out, unfurling to reveal a message scrawled in blood: "Another 1 Boned!" Jepson Bone feigned shock, his painted smile widening. He then giggled, a high-pitched, chilling sound, and pointed at Quentin and his mother, their bodies mangled, the bone protruding from her skull. "Get it?" his eyes seemed to say. "Boned." The joke, if you could call it that, was sickeningly clear.

Jepson, his work seemingly complete, turned towards the camera and, with a flourish, blew a kiss. Then, he pointed at the father, who was still alive but clearly on the verge of death, his body twitching spasmodically. Without ending the call, Jepson Bone walked over to the father and, with a sickeningly casual gesture, forced his head up. The father, dazed and disoriented, his eyes barely focusing, finally saw me on the screen, watching his torment. He croaked out my name in confusion, a question hanging in the air. Before I could respond, Jepson Bone forced my friend's father's mouth wide open and, with brutal efficiency, shoved the entire phone down his esophagus. The sounds that followed were indescribable, a mix of choking, gurgling, and muffled screams as the phone lodged itself deep within the father’s throat. It was too much to bear. And then, abruptly, the call finally ended. That was the end of the show…*for them.*

The lights in my room flickered on, not with the warm, reassuring glow of normalcy, but with a harsh, strobe-like intensity that made the shadows dance and writhe on the walls. It wasn't a steady illumination; it was a pulsating, erratic light, as if the room itself were breathing, gasping for air. The sudden brightness was blinding, making my eyes water and blurring my vision. When my sight finally adjusted, the room seemed… different. The familiar furniture was cast in an unnatural light, their shapes distorted and elongated, taking on a sinister, almost predatory appearance. The shadows clung to the corners of the room, deeper and darker than before, and seemed to be moving, shifting, whispering secrets I didn't want to hear. The air grew heavy, thick with a cloying sweetness that made my stomach churn. It was the same sickly sweet scent that I’d smelled earlier, like stale popcorn and cheap perfume, only stronger now, almost suffocating. And beneath it, a metallic tang, the unmistakable aroma of blood.

Silence. Moments of absolute silence, so thick I could almost taste it. Then, a knock on my bedroom door, tentative at first, then more insistent. "Mom? Dad?" I called out, my voice a dry rasp in my throat. The only response was a giggle, thin and sharp as shattered glass, echoing through the house, seeming to crawl up my spine. I froze, every muscle in my body coiled tight, my blood running cold. A dark, viscous liquid, thick and sticky, was seeping under the door, spreading across my carpet like a creeping shadow. It wasn't water. The metallic tang of it, the sickeningly sweet scent that clung to it… it was blood. I knew I had to escape. The window was my only chance, a sliver of hope in the suffocating darkness. But as I turned towards it, my gaze snagged on something outside. A figure, silhouetted against the moonlit sky, standing motionless in the yard. It was tall, impossibly tall, and its head was tilted at an unnatural angle, as if it were watching me. The drop was too far, too risky. And now… there was something *out there*. Suddenly, a gust of wind roared through my room, rattling the windows and making the lights flicker wildly. And then, *I heard it*. A voice, not from the clown, but something far more sinister. It seemed to emanate from everywhere at once – the walls, the floor, the ceiling – a presence in itself. "Little fresh meat," it rasped, the words echoing in my skull. "Come on down to the Killing Floor. We got games… and so much more." *It's in my head,* I thought, terror seizing me. It was too late. I turned back to face the door, my heart hammering against my ribs, each beat a countdown to some unknown horror. The door creaked open, agonizingly slow, revealing… nothing. Just darkness. And then, a hand shot out, grabbing my wrist in a viselike grip.

Yes, my death was agonizing, a symphony of pain that echoed through my final moments. But it was just the beginning. I'm on the Killing Floor now, another skeptic silenced, another name added to the wall in blood—a testament to the terror I faced. One truth remains, burning brighter than any flame, a final, defiant scream against the darkness: FUCK. CLOWNS. I'll see you here very soon. Don't expect an apology from me; you brought this on yourself. You dared to go meddling further, you dared to believe. 

Good luck—you'll need it.
