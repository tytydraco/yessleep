Background.
A few villages over from where I live there is a country park. The country park during ww2 actually had an extensive network of ammunition factories and railways, they were put here to be concealed from German bombers. Currently most of the buildings are just scattered bricks buried in bush. All that I've found remaining are the odd railway track, air raid bunkers and an old railway station.

(Just to prefice this in my country the wildlife is basically harmless, largest animal you'd find is a horse.)
This event occured at the middle of June, a couple of friends and myself decided to sneak into the park at night and camp there. It was a celebration for a private event. As we snuck into the car park at the side of the park, there were no cars and the park rangers had left to go to sleep. Eventually going out this night would be a poor decision because of the bad weather. We started packing our belongs back into our bags to find an abandoned building to take shelter from the rain in. At this point it was the early morning of 12am and it was pitch black with heavy rain pouring down. Finding the nearest building in the forest was the old train station. It had big interlocking fencing put up because it was considered derelict and dangerous structurally, obviously we went in anyway and scraped past the gap in the fence releasing a loud screech from the rubbing metal. We quickly headed further inside the small structure and into the secret shaft that led into the raid bunker. And soon we went to sleep around 1am-2am.

About an hour later we woke up to the sound of the same metal screech from earlier. We looked around at eachother and did a head count. All 6 of us were present so we quickly shut all our lights off. For about 3 minutes we didn't hear anything. Until whoever was walking above us got closer, the sound of wet footsteps above us became louder but still relatively faint. It didn't sound like normal shoe foot steps though. We all sat there silently as the foot steps stopped right near the entrance to the bunker, there was no light from the entrance. We looked at eachother in the dark as we realised that whoever had come up there had no torch with them. The footsteps didn't continue, assuming whoever was up there was still there we waited until they left.
After what had felt like an eternity the footsteps picked back up, heading away from our direction. Hearing the sweet sound of the metal screeching as they left.

We decided to stay as we thought that it may have been a park rangers trying to sneak up on us without his lights on purpose, and we didn't want to get caught. We got some shuteye until our alarms woke us at 6 to leave before the rangers arrive on their 8 am shift. Crawling out of the hole and into the summer morning we came across our footprints from last night. However there were an extra set of footprints of the person that followed us in the previous night, they were barefooted. 
We quickly packed up our stuff and left quickly out of childish paranoia. Nothing else happened to us that morning.
