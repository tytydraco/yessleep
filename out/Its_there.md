It’s there, every single night it’s there. It’s hard to explain what it is, or how I know it is there because I have never actually seen it. But every night when I close my eyes I can feel it’s presence behind me, it doesn’t matter if my back is facing the wall or the empty room, it is always behind me. I can feel it’s warm breath on my neck as it is exhaling behind me, it’s mucus and saliva inches away from my skin. It is always there.

Every morning I wake up exhausted, some nights the breathing stays longer than other nights but I can never fall back asleep util it’s gone. At first I thought it was a bad dream, merely a side effect of my fascination of horror and thriller media. I thought I must have read a particular haunting story on the internet or played one too many horror games. But when I really think about it, I can’t remember when it started, has it always been there?

Some nights I force myself to stay awake, lying to myself that it is sleep paralysis and if I stay awake all night watching movies on the couch it won’t affect me at all. Some nights I even go outside to try and fool it by not being around, maybe my house is haunted. The sheer terror I feel when the breathing starts as I am staring across the small lake outside of my apartment complex, or when I’m howling with laughter at the tomfoolery of Charlie Chaplin. It is always there.

Sleeping is my safest option, taking Melatonin to knock myself out as quickly as possible to hopefully get some hours in before the warmth starts to creep in on my neck and eventually wakes me up. When I get up after it wakes me up, either to go to the bathroom or just get out of my room, it gets mad. The breathing becomes faster, shorter inhales and longer exhales almost choking, as if it’s running out of breath. I decided to stay in bed, I don’t want to find out what happens when it gets tired.

Last night something finally changed in my life, I met someone recently and we fell asleep together. I didn’t tell him about my night terrors, truly I had forgotten about it until I woke up again, I woke up from breathing. It was different this time, I didn’t feel malice or harmful intent from the breathing. It wasn’t until I realized the breathing belonged to the same source that had its arms wrapped around me lovingly, it was my boyfriend’s breathing. When I awoke again this morning, my boyfriend was already gone, probably left for his early work shift. What worries me is that I didn’t get any messages from him throughout the day, he also forgot his lunchbox.  
And besides, I am afraid to go to sleep tonight, because all day I have felt that horrible breathing on my neck.
