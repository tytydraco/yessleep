I used to think the world was cruel, but never arbitrary. When my wife left, taking with her the remnants of a life I thought was ours to build, I tried to find reason in the wreckage. I told myself that the camping trip with my kids would be a fresh start—a way to rebuild what had been shattered. Now, sitting in the dark with their bodies cold beside me, I know better.

The world isn’t just cruel; it’s indifferent. And sometimes, that indifference takes on a shape you can’t begin to comprehend.

The climb was supposed to be easy—a three-day hike up a decent peak that the guidebooks described as “family-friendly.” By the time we reached the campsite at the mountain’s base, I could feel the tension crackling between us, like static in the humid air. James, my oldest, had barely spoken since the divorce. Emily, just twelve, was glued to her phone, even out here where the signal was sporadic at best. And little Tommy, eight and always the peacemaker, tried his best to keep everyone smiling. But there was an unease in his eyes, a glint of something I couldn’t quite place, like he could sense something the rest of us couldn’t.

I ignored it, convinced myself that I could fix this—fix us—with s’mores and ghost stories around the campfire. But that first night, as the fire crackled and the forest around us grew silent, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were being watched. The shadows felt too thick, the trees too close, as if the forest itself was leaning in to hear our whispers. The air was cool, carrying the earthy scent of moss and pine, but beneath it lingered something else, something sharp and sour, like a wound festering just out of sight.

Emily was the first to notice. She had wandered off to pee, and when I heard her scream, the sound sent a jolt of terror straight to my heart. I found her standing over something in the dirt, her face pale as the moonlight that filtered through the trees. A dead rabbit, throat slashed open, its insides arranged in a grotesque spiral, like someone—or something—had been playing with it. The sight of it made my stomach turn.

“Dad… who would do this?” Emily’s voice was trembling, and I could see the fright in her eyes.

“It’s just an animal,” I said, trying to sound confident. “Maybe a fox or something. Come on, let’s get back to the fire.”

But the unease only grew as the night went on. I couldn’t sleep. I kept hearing things—rustling in the bushes, twigs snapping, the low murmur of voices just beyond the circle of light. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that rabbit, its dead, glassy eyes staring back at me, and I couldn’t help but wonder if it had been placed there. A warning.

When I finally drifted off, I dreamt of the forest closing in around us, the trees uprooting themselves and marching toward our campsite. They loomed over us like ancient, vengeful gods, their twisted branches reaching out to snatch us up. I woke in a cold sweat, the fire reduced to embers, and found Tommy standing at the edge of the campsite, staring into the woods.

“Tommy,” I hissed, not wanting to wake the others, “what are you doing?”

He didn’t answer at first. He just stood there, silhouetted against the darkness, and for a moment, I thought I saw movement in the trees—something shifting in the shadows, something watching us. Then he turned to me, his eyes wide and vacant, his voice eerily calm. “It wants a sacrifice, Dad.”

My blood ran cold. “What are you talking about?”

“The rabbit,” he said, his voice too flat, too emotionless for an eight-year-old. “It wasn’t enough. It needs more.”

A thousand thoughts raced through my mind. This wasn’t normal—this wasn’t my son. I knelt beside him, gripping his shoulders. “Tommy, listen to me. There’s nothing out there, okay? You’re letting your imagination carry you away a little too much.”

But he shook his head slowly, and when he looked up at me, there was something wrong in his eyes, something dark and unrecognizable. “It wants one of us, Dad. It said… it said you’d do.”

The next morning, I found another dead animal near our tent—this time a squirrel, its tiny body mutilated beyond recognition, its blood smeared across the ground in a grisly pattern that made my skin crawl. I felt my world closing in, the weight of something terrible pressing down on me. I couldn’t let my kids see this—I couldn’t let them feel the same that was gnawing at my insides.

But the signs kept coming. That evening, Emily found another carcass by the creek, a deer this time, its legs twisted at unnatural angles, its eyes plucked out. James, normally so stoic, grew sickly pale and started hyperventilating, his teenage bravado crumbling under the mounting dread.

“I don’t know what’s going on,” I confessed to them, my voice firm. “But we’re leaving first thing tomorrow. I’m not taking any chances. We’ll be okay. I promise.”

In a desperate bid to get help, I decided to climb higher up the mountain during the last hours of sunlight, hoping to get a signal and call my close friend to come pick us up. I told the kids to stay behind and keep an eye on the gear. As I began my ascent, the rock face loomed above me, jagged and sheer. My hands gripped the rough stone, each move a test of willpower as I navigated the vertical climb. The fear of falling gnawed at me, each footstep on the narrow ledges feeling like it could betray me at any moment.

After half an hour of grueling ascent, I reached a narrow ledge. I set up my phone, trying to get a signal to call for help, but the connection was intermittent at best. Anguish clawed at me, and I started to consider other options.

From below, I heard Emily’s voice calling up to me. “Dad! We found the drone remote!”

My heart raced. I had packed the drone along with all of my other gear. I pulled it out from my backpack, attaching my phone to it as Emily and James suggested. The drone hummed to life, and I watched as it ascended, hoping that getting above the treeline would improve the signal.

The drone rose higher, wobbling in the air. James was at the controls, but his nervous hands were unsteady. “I’m so sorry, Dad! I think I lost control!”

The drone veered off course, and before I could react, it collided with a tree branch, plummeting to the ground below. My heart sank as I watched the drone crash, my phone shattering on impact. There was nothing more I could do then.

The descent was even more risky in the dark. The sheer drop from the rock face loomed large as I climbed down. I had to navigate narrow ledges, my body pressed against the cold stone, each movement a precarious balancing act. Every slip of a foot sent shivers of fear through me.

As I reached the ground again, Emily and James were panicking. I tried to calm them down, hugging them tight thinking their reactions were from our prior experiences, steadily asking them to tell me what was going on. Tommy should have stayed at our tent, but he had simply disappeared just after sunset without them noticing. I called for him, frantically running, demanding Emily and James stay close together. My flashlight beamed through the living darkness. I found him standing in a small clearing surrounded by a circle of stones. His arms were outstretched, his head tilted back, and he was chanting something low and guttural, something that didn’t sound human.

I rushed to him, grabbing him by the shoulders, but he didn’t respond. His eyes were closed, his lips moving in a strange, awful rhythm, and when I tried to pull him away, he lashed out at me with a strength that wasn’t his.

“It’s coming, Dad,” he said, his voice distorted, like something was speaking through him. “You can’t stop it. But you can make it happy. You can make it stop.”

“What do you want from me?” I shouted into the darkness, my voice cracking under the weight of betrayal and relief, horror and love. “Leave my son alone!”

But Tommy just smiled, a cold, hollow smile that sent a shiver down my spine. “It wants you, Dad. It’s always wanted you.”

At that moment, something inside me snapped. The fear, the anger, the guilt—I couldn’t take it anymore. I threw myself in front of him, offering myself to whatever dark force was out there, praying that it would take me and leave my children alone.

Then Emily and James stepped out of the trees, their faces twisted into mocking grins. “It was a prank, Dad,” Emily said, her voice dripping with false innocence. “You were so scared.”

*What?* No. My heart pounded as the truth sank in. Surely, there was no way. They had planned this—my own children had faked the whole thing, used the dead animals, the rituals, everything, to mess with me. To punish me.

“You think this is funny?” I roared, my voice breaking. “Do you think it’s funny to make your father think his own children are in danger?”

James’s smirk faltered, and I saw a flicker of something else in his eyes—regret, fear, I couldn’t tell. “Dad, we… we just wanted to scare you a little, that’s all.”

But Emily’s grin didn’t waver. “You deserved it,” she said coldly. “For what you did to us. For what you did to Mom.”

My hands trembled as I looked at them, these children I had sworn to protect, who now stood before me as strangers. “We’re going home,” I said finally, my voice flat. “And when we get back, there will be consequences. Do you understand me?”

They didn’t answer, just exchanged uneasy glances. But they followed me back to the tent without a word.

As I packed up our gear in the early sunrise, I tried to shake the anger that burned in my chest. I couldn’t let them see it, couldn’t let them know how deeply they had wounded me. I was their father, after all. I had to be strong. I had to keep us together.

The path down the mountain was treacherous. We were rock climbing, our hands and feet clinging to the rough stone. The ground below seemed to yawn open, the sheer drops threatening to pull us into the abyss. The only thing I could trust now was that we were an experienced family. Yet I couldn’t trust them. What were they willing to do to me, their father? Every tremor in the rock face made my heart race, the vertigo from the height an ever-present terror.

We descended, and the trees seemed to close in around us. Despite the sunrise, the forest grew darker, and the air became thick with that metallic tang again, the smell of something festering. The ground beneath us trembled, and the forest erupted. Roots burst from the earth, branches clawing at us, pulling at our clothes, our skin. I let out a guttural, primal sound.

The trail twisted into a nightmarish labyrinth of jagged rocks and sheer drops. Tommy being nearest me, I grabbed his small hand, trying to pull him back. The forest was relentless, the roots coiling around his legs, dragging him into the darkness. The ground beneath my feet buckled, and I had to cling desperately to the rocks to avoid being pulled into the chasm that opened before me.

“Dad! Help me!” Tommy’s scream echoed as he was pulled away, the roots dragging him down into the abyss.

James’ and Emily’s screams blended with the howling wind. I tried to reach them, carelessly climbing my way over to them, but the forest was closing in. It was swallowing them up.

James fell first, the rocks giving way beneath him, his body vanishing into the darkness below. Emily followed, her cries fading into the void as she was dragged into the chasm. I was left alone, clinging to the edge with electricity jolting through my body, unable to fully grasp anything but my determination not to fall, the knowledge that I could be next.

After forcing myself to a narrow ledge, the chaos subsided. The bodies of my children—cold and lifeless—were strewn around me, the forest’s gaping maw having claimed them. I stared at their remains, their eyes open but unseeing, their faces frozen in expressions of terror. They lay beside me in a surreal display of my worst fear. The forest was still again, the trees swaying gently as if nothing had happened. I was alone, my children’s bodies beside me, my mind teetering on the edge of madness.

So, I know how it’s going to look. The police will come, they’ll find the campsite, the bodies buried deep in the forest, and they’ll think it was me. How could they not? I can see the headlines now, the news reports—“Father Goes Mad, Kills Three in Grisly Forest Ritual.” They’ll never believe the truth. Hell, I barely believe it myself.

But this is what happened. The forest wanted a sacrifice, and I offered myself. But it took them instead. My kids, my beautiful, innocent kids, taken by something I can’t explain, something beyond my understanding.

I should have saved them. I should have fought harder, I should have fallen into the pits instead of them. But I didn’t, and now they’re gone, and their hatred for me is lingering. I have made my way down, sitting here with them alone, waiting for the world to come crashing down on me.

I can hear their voices, their evil laughter echoing, their pitch-black feelings for me as their father pulsating, like the forest is mocking me, reminding me of my failure. I can’t live with this, yet I must. Because someone needs to know. Someone needs to hear the truth, even if they don’t believe it.

I didn’t truly survive.

This mountain let me live.

And the world isn’t just indifferent—it’s laughing at me, too.
