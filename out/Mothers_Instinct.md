My sweet boy always waits by the swing for me.

When we bought this house, my favorite selling point was the large oak tree in the backyard. Not only did it offer shade, but it added the picturesque quality to the property that had me smiling at my husband and nodding my head.

When we walked the lot that day, I firmly placed a hand on my growing belly and the other on the tree.

“Perfect place for a swing, don’t you think?”, I asked, gazing up at the endless green leaves waving hello in the breeze.

“Yeah, I think so. They’ll love it.”, he responded, taking my hand from the tree and kissing it softly.

The second I saw the sunlight hit his golden hair, making it glow, I knew this was the place for us.

We bought the house that afternoon.

Jackson had the swing installed that weekend.

And 4 months later, I gave birth to my babies. My twins. 

A boy and a girl, just like I always wanted.

They were escorted to the NICU right away, as they were premature like most twins are.

And sadly, my beautiful Rosalie didn’t make it through the night.

Umbilical cord problems.

They told me she was so small and frail, that I wouldn’t be able to hold her even once.

I saw her for a moment, when she was taken from me during my C-section.

She had a birthmark in a shape resembling a heart on her right shoulder.

Then she was gone.

I cried as I held Reese in my arms. The grief of losing one and the love of holding the other was all-consuming.

“Don’t worry, my love. I have you.”, I had whispered against his skin.

And now, our life has a new normal.

We planted a rose bush in our backyard, next to the oak tree. So she would always be part of this place.

I wasn’t sure if the roses would bloom, but that spring, they did.

As they have every year since.

Reese is now 5, and he loves the swing more than anything.

Every morning, he waits for me by it. I trudge out in my robe, cup of coffee in hand, while he bounces with excitement.

“Mommy, it’s time! I was extra patience this time!”, he cheers.

“‘Patient’, my darling. You were very ‘patient’ this morning, you’re right!”, I tell him, placing my coffee down next to me on the garden table.

His brow furrows in confusion.

“That’s what I said, right?”, he wonders.

I laugh at his expression.

“Yes you did, now let’s climb on.”, I chuckle, helping him into the wooden seat.

His golden hair shines the same way Jackson’s does.

Same routine, every morning.

And I wouldn’t trade it for anything.

Except Reese is starting kindergarten next week.

I push him back and forth, while he squeals and shrieks. He has spent every day with me since he was born, and the thought of sending him somewhere else every day is shattering my heart. I had half a mind to keep him home with me, try homeschooling. But Jackson discouraged it.

“It will be good for him, you can’t be his only friend.”, he said, rubbing my back.

I sighed, and begrudgingly agreed.

“Are you excited to make some new friends?”, I asked between pushes.

“Yeah!”, he cheers.

Well, that settles that.

After our morning ritual, I tell Reese it’s time for his breakfast.

He jumps off the swing, and holds my hand as we cross the backyard.

“Morning, Rosie.”, he sings, waving his fingers at the rose bush.

We cross the backyard porch, and he bounces into the house at full speed.

I turn to close the sliding glass door, and kiss my fingertips before touching the glass.

“Morning, my darling girl.”

*

The next week goes by in a flash.

Jackson and I drop off Reese at kindergarten, with his new backpack that is bigger than he is.

I do admit, I cry when I hug him goodbye.

“Be such a good boy today, I will see you at 3.”, I say into his hair.

“Okay, Mommy. I’ll be good!”, he cheers, before turning to Jackson for a similar exchange.

After our (my) tearful goodbye, he takes his new teacher’s hand and heads into the school painted with primary colors.

We took him to a school the next town over because of their fantastic ratings, we want to give him every opportunity.

Jackson has taken the day off work, to help my transition. He would never say it, but I know he thinks I am a nervous wreck about Reese.

I am self aware enough to know he isn’t entirely wrong.

We spend the day doing my favorite things. Lunch, shopping, couples massage, and I’m feeling lighter every minute. So much so, that I don’t even realize it’s time to pick up Reese.

When Jackson and I wait outside the school, he looks at me out of the corner of his eye.

“How do you feel?”, he asks.

“I missed him.. But I feel okay, surprisingly.”, I respond, with a smile that comes naturally.

He takes my hand and squeezes it.

“I’m proud of you, you did great today.”, he beams at me.

Just then, I see the top of Reese’s head walking out the door, his eyes light up when he sees us.

“Mommy! Daddy!”, he yells, running to us like we’ve been reunited after a journey away.

Before we can even ask, he barrels into his whole day and his feelings about it.

“We had cupcakes for snack!”

“We sang Baby Shark!”

“I made this many friends,” he says, holding up 4 fingers.

“You made friends? On your very first day? That’s our rockstar!”, Jackson cheers, ruffling Reese’s hair.

“Yup. Two boys, and two girls. I think Taylor is my favorite friend, we like all the same things, but Blake is my second favorite friend. I told them they should come see our swing some day after school!”, he says excitedly.

I smile at his bright eyes, he really is a great kid.

Jackson wraps the 3 of us into a hug, and says we are going to order pizza tonight to celebrate. Reese jumps in excitement so much that his unzipped backpack falls off, spilling his take-home papers everywhere.

“Oops! I got it!”, he yells, bending his little legs to gather the papers.

Jackson puts his arm around my shoulders and chuckles, and I can’t help but think about how lucky I am.

What was I so scared of?

*

Several weeks later, I get a call from an unknown number on my phone.

“Hello? This is Claire.”, I say into the receiver.

“Claire? Hello, this is Emma Mason. Our kids are both in Ms. Kerwin’s class.”, a woman’s voice responds.

“Oh hello, Emma. I’m sorry, who is your child? I’m sure Reese has mentioned them.”, I say, putting down the pan I was just cleaning.

“Taylor,  I hear they are becoming fast friends.”, she responds.

“Yes! Taylor! Reese told me they liked to hunt for bugs at recess.”, I laugh.

Emma groans into the phone.

“Yes, yes that’s mine. The bug phase has been my least favorite.”, she sighs into the phone.

“Oh yes, I didn’t like the bug phase myself. Reese told me Taylor’s cousin is also in the class?”, I ask, sitting back on the couch.

“Yes! Blake, the 3 of them are so funny with the mischievous things they tell me about. I was hoping to set up a play date with you, if that was okay. We don’t normally do play dates a lot but the kids are begging to see Reese, is that alright?”, she asks, tentatively.

“Of course, I’m sure Reese would love that. When are you free?”, I respond.

I’ve never hosted a play date before, I make a mental note to run to Costco beforehand for snacks.

We plan a time for them to come this Saturday, and hang up.

Emma seemed lovely too, maybe her and I could be friends.

Jackson picks up Reese from school, and when they come in, Reese is practically bouncing off the walls.

“I take it that you’re excited?”, I ask between laughs.

“Yea! I want to show them my room! And my swing! And my toys! Mom, can we have the pizzas on the bagels?”, he pleads, holding his hands together.

“Sure my love, whatever you want.”, I say, kissing him on the forehead.

He cheers and runs up the stairs to his room.

“I met Emma today, and the kids, they seem nice.”, Jackson says, opening the fridge to grab a beer.

“I’m glad you will be here, 3 little boys will outnumber me and Emma.”, I laugh, picking up my teacup and putting it in the sink.

Jackson takes a swig of beer before looking at me with confusion.

“Blake and Taylor are girls.”, he corrects.

“Oh, oh I just thought.. Oh okay.”, I stammer.

“Yeah, cousins. Emma said she picks up Blake and helps with her because her parents work long hours, she said they are both total tomboys though.”, he explains.

“Well I’m sure the 3 of them will have a great time, thank you for the heads up though.”, I tell him, taking out my notebook and writing down my grocery list.

“Yeah of course, I’ve got your back.. I know you’re stressed with getting the right snacks and making this play date perfect. But I want to ask one thing, if that’s okay…”, he says, crossing to me.

“Hmm?”, I ask, putting the pen down.

He looks at me seriously, and for a moment my heart drops.

“What, Jackson?”, I ask.

“Can you get peanut butter pretzels from Costco?”, he asks with the serious expression.

I playfully swat him away.

“Oh you’re terrible, go on!”, I laugh.

He walks up the stairs, laughing every step.

*

Saturday afternoon arrives, and I have cleaned my house twice.

I have scrubbed every surface, laid out a pleasing assortment of snacks. From fruit, and veggies with peanut butter, all the way to Goldfish and pizza bagels.

What? Kids like options.

When the doorbell rings, Jackson goes to get it.

I hear voices coming from the foyer, and Reese runs down the stairs just as they are crossing into the living room.

“You’re here!”, Reese yells.

The 3 kids bounce and shriek in unison for several seconds before calming down.

They are all similar in height, I see Taylor has blonde hair and Blake has red. They are all dressed in T-shirts and sneakers.

Emma appears behind them, hair in a messy bun, leggings and a sweatshirt on.

“Hi Claire, so good to meet you in person! I’m Emma, and blondie over there is mine, Taylor. And the redhead is Blake, my niece.”, she says, smiling at me.

I smooth my floral print dress self-consciously.

Oh god, I am way overdressed.

Jackson is in jeans and a t shirt, and I look like I’m going to church.

I can feel the panic attack starting to rise.

Emma is standing there, waiting for me to respond.

I run my hands over my dress again and look around sheepishly.

Jackson notices, and begins to walk over, when Emma speaks.

“Your dress is so pretty, I think I saw it online. Nordstrom, right?”, she asks.

“Oh, yes. Yes, that’s right. I’m so sorry, I’ve never.. Had anyone over like this. I wasn’t sure what to..”, I look down at my nude heels.

I wish the floor would open and swallow me up.

“Well you look STUNNING!”, she says, “Seriously, so beautiful. But if you aren’t comfortable, you can always change! Or don’t, I’m easy, don’t you worry about me. Though I may try to steal that dress from you if I stare at it any longer.”, she laughs, winking.

My shoulders relax, and I can see Jackson relax over her shoulder.

“You know what, I think I will change. Would you excuse me a moment?”, I ask.

She waves me off, and tells me she will handle getting the kids some snacks.

I walk upstairs, and Jackson follows me.

“Are you okay?”, he asks, his eyes searching my face.

“I am, she seems nice. I’m just a little anxious, I’m sure it’s just the kids being loud. It’s like the second they all came in, I felt nauseous, and I think I was just trying too hard.”, I respond, taking a baggy pair of jeans and t-shirt out of my closet.

“Okay, I’ll see you down there.”, he says, kissing my hand like he always does, before leaving the room.

I change quickly, and I’m looking in my mirror, trying to place my hair in a ponytail, when I hear a small voice.

“Hi.”

I jump.

Blake is standing at my bedroom door.

She really is a tomboy.

She has her long red hair tied up in two braids. She has a baggy Superman shirt on, with jeans and red converse.

“Oh hi Blake, I’ll be down in just a minute. Did you need something?”, I ask, giving up on my hair and putting a claw clip in it.

“Taylor is in the bathroom downstairs, so Reese said I can use the one up here, I don’t know where it is though.”, she tells me.

“Oh of course, sweetie. Let me show you.”, I get up and lead her to the hallway bathroom, because it’s more kid friendly.

“Thank you.. Mrs. Reese’s Mom.”, she says, shyly.

“You can call me Claire.”, I tell her.

She smiles.

“I’ll wait right out here for you, okay?”, I tell her.

She nods, and closes the door.

What a polite girl.

When she comes out, I tell her that her hair is beautiful.

“Thank you..”, she says shyly, blushing.

“Do your parents have the same hair?”, I ask.

She shakes her head.

“It’s just my mom, and she has brown hair.”, she tells me.

“You know what, my great-great-grandma Jolie had red hair I’m told, but none of her kids had it. That’s funny, right?”, I ask her.

She giggles.

“Yeah that’s funny!”, she says.

We’ve rejoined the party by now, and the kids have torn through the snacks.

Taylor and Reese are whispering to each other and giggling when we return.

Blake skips to rejoin them.

Emma looks up and smiles.

“Love the jeans!”, she winks.

And I smile at her.

After the kids eat, Reese asks if we can go outside.

Jackson excuses himself to take a work call, but says he will be in his office if we are getting overrun by the kids.

I pour Emma and myself a glass of lemonade, and we head out to sit on the chairs sitting on the back patio.

We just sit down when I hear Reese’s voice.

“And that’s where my sister lives!”, he says, pointing at the rose bush.

“Your sister lives outside?”, Blake asks, with her mouth wide open.

“Was she bad?”, Taylor asks.

“No! She lives in heaven! But this is just her spot.”, he explains.

Taylor and Blake seem to accept that answer, and start playing with the baseball set on the grass.

I know Emma heard Reese, but she’s being polite.

“Reese was a twin..”, I explain.

She turns to me, and says nothing.

“He had a sister, Rosalie. They were born prematurely, and she didn’t make it. So we planted the roses so she has a place here with us.”, I tell her.

“Oh Claire.. I’m so sorry. That’s just awful, I’m sorry you had to go through that.”, she says, reaching out her hand to hold mine for a moment.

“Thank you.. We have our good and bad days. Reese handles it well, as well as you can, I guess. He talks to her a lot though, I catch him out here talking to the roses..”, I choke on the last word.

“We don’t have to talk about it, if you don’t want to.”, Emma says, reassuringly.

I nod, and give her a sad smile.

We watch the kids play for a few minutes, and it seems so natural. 

Makes me wonder why I waited to long to encourage Reese to make friends.

I turn to Emma, to ask her about herself, when we hear a shriek.

Our heads both jerk to the noise, and Taylor is sitting on the ground, holding her foot.

“Mom!!”, Reese cries.

Emma and I stand up, and go to the kids.

Taylor is in tears, and can’t even form a sentence.

“What happened?”, I ask.

“Taylor was running, and she slipped on the grass.”, Blake explains.

“Is that right?”, Emma asks Taylor.

She nods between sobs.

Emma raises her pants leg, and looks at the leg.

“It’s not broken, but let’s put some ice on it just in case.”, she says, wiping her tears.

“Are you sure? I can watch Blake if you want to take her to urgent care.”, I tell her.

She shakes her head.

“Oh no, she will be okay. I’m actually an ER nurse. Blake’s mom too, she’s my sister.”, she explains, picking up Taylor.

“Well I know who I’m calling for any weird rash.”, I say, trying to make a joke.

Emma laughs.

“I got you! Do you guys have ice packs?”, she asks.

“Yes, in the freezer. Help yourself.”, I tell her as she disappears into the house.

I turn to see Reese and Blake and they look traumatized.

“Hey guys, Taylor will be okay. Just a boo boo. Let’s keep playing and she will join us when she’s ready.”, I say, patting both of them on the shoulder.

“Reese, why don’t you show her your swing?”, I suggest.

“Okay!”, he says, taking Blake’s hand and running to the oak tree.

I sit on the steps of the patio, and lean back on my elbows.

I see them taking turns pushing each other, giggling and shrieking with joy. 

“Mommy! Come push us!”, Reese yells.

I smile, and walk over to them.

“Okay, get close together..”, I warn.

They scoot right next to each other and put an arm around each other.

“Ready!”, they cheer.

I pull the swing back, and let it go.

They squeal as they go higher and higher.

I laugh with them.

I watch them swing, the sun cresting through the leaves of the familiar oak.

The sun shines on Blake’s red hair, making it look like flames.

It’s mesmerizing.

Reese looks over his shoulder at me and smiles so wide, his brown eyes sparkling.

I smile back.

Blake looks over her shoulder at me and smiles, her brown eyes shine at me when they catch the sunlight.

And I stop pushing.

I look back and forth between the two of them, my heart racing.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

“Rosalie?”, I whisper as the swing comes to a stop.

Blake looks at me confused.

“Mommy, what’s wrong?”, Reese asks.

“Jackson.. Jackson!”, I scream.

He comes running out of the house with Emma and Taylor in tow.

“Claire? Claire! What’s wrong, what happened?”, he asks when he reaches us.

I point at Blake shakily.

“Check her shoulder..”,  I whisper.

“What?”, he asks.

“I’ve had this weird feeling all day. Check her shoulder.. for the birthmark..”, I whisper again.

Jackson’s face falls.

“Claire.. She isn’t Rosalie.. Rosalie died, remember?”, he says quietly.

“Did you get to see her? Hold her?”, I demand.

He’s quiet, because he knows he didn’t.

“You know they said we couldn’t.”, he reiterates.

“But I saw her, I saw her when they took her out during my C-section. She had a birthmark on the back of her right shoulder.”, Im screaming now.

Blake is looking at me with fear in her eyes.

Jackson is just staring at me.

“I think we should go.”, Emma says.

I turn to look at her, she avoids my gaze.

“Come on Blake, say bye to Reese.”, she says, her warm demeanor gone.

Reese starts to cry.

“Why are they going?”, he asks.

Emma takes Taylor and Blake’s hands and leads them through the house.

“Wait!”, I yell.

I run in after them.

“Stay away from us.”, Emma says coldly.

“Let me see her shoulder, if you have nothing to hide, then let me see!”, I yell.

Jackson and Reese are running in after us.

“Claire, stop!”, Jackson screams.

“You know what? Fine!”, Emma yells back.

She pushes Blake’s hair out of the way, and pulls open the neck of the shirt so I can see her right shoulder.

Nothing is there.

“No.. No I thought.. I was sure.. I just.. had a feeling since you got here..”, I stammer.

Jackson puts his face in his hands.

“You’re both crazy.”, Emma seethes.

Emma opens the door, and pushes Blake out first.

“Blakey doesn’t have the special spot.”, Taylor says quietly.

Emma stops.

“N-No, Taylor. Stop. Let’s go.”, she stammers.

“See??”, Taylor says, moving her tank top, “I have my special spot, Blakey doesn’t have one. Mommy says I can’t show it to anyone though, she said it’s secret.”, she says proudly.

I look at Taylor’s shoulder, and see the unmistakable birthmark.

In a misshapen heart.

My heart stops

Taylor’s small face is beaming at me, and that’s when I see she has the same grin as Reese.

His words from the first day he met her float in my head.

“Taylor is my favorite friend, we like all the same things..”

Oh my god.

I slowly look up at Emma.

She’s staring at me with pure panic in her eyes.

“You were my nurse at the hospital.”, I say quietly.

She is still frozen.

“You said she was.. You said.. She was dead…”, I whisper, feeling Jackson come up behind me.

“I’m calling the police.”, he says.

I stare at Emma.

“I’m sorry..”, she whispers, “It wasn’t personal, I would have done anything to become a mother.”

“Mommy?”, Taylor asks.

And me and Emma both turn to her.
