I'm Never Camping Again Pt 1- [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1f4bwte/im\_never\_camping\_again/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1f4bwte/im_never_camping_again/)



I sat there on the ground for what seemed like an eternity. My mind lost in what I just experienced. Am I losing my mind? Monsters are real? Then another thought popped into my head, What does my mom know? I stand up and dust myself off. I gather my broken thoughts and I make my way into the house. I step through the threshold and my anger takes hold.

"Mom!" I yell staggering into the house.

"What the fuck is going on!?" I said confused and angry.

"I knew you would be ok son." She said calmly.

"Mom listen to me right now, You know something about

what's going on and I need to know what." I said

Mom hands me a letter with one word written on it, Son. I grab the letter and don't say a thing. I walk to my room look at the window. The face I had seen moments before burned into my memory. I hesitantly step into my room and sit on the bed. I slowly open the letter and begin to read.

Son, I want to start by saying I'm sorry for what's happening to you. Ill start by explaining what we know for sure about The Man. For years our family has Dealt with this entity or whatever it is. My great great grandfather met a man who offered him wealth beyond his wildest dreams, But there was a catch. The man demanded two souls every five years, If that was not possible then he must return to a place he was happiest and give himself to the man. The first child of the man must survive the first encounter with the man or the curse is lifted and moves to another family. My grandfather growing up poor with nothing to leave his family accepted the deal. He lived for twenty-five long years, Inevitably falling victim to The Man.

Now some years later and here we are. I watched my father go basically insane. He wouldn't talk to anyone and he locked himself in his basement. I never heard my father tell me he loved me until the day I lost him. I promised myself id figure a way around that. I chose war instead of cold blooded murder. When I was your age I watched my father walk into a bathroom at a baseball game and he never come back out. Before he went in he told me that he loved me and never agree to go to a baseball game again. He gave up and pushed the curse to me. Its hard to accept but I to will disappear. You will have to push through the loss of me and fight to figure out how to end this curse.

My father lived till 53, the curse given to him at 18. My father took 14 lives in order to protect me as long as he could. At the time of writing this letter I have given the man 6 lives. I wish I could give you more time but I cannot bring myself to take a life for no reason. War was an excuse, a way to bury the demon that The Man ultimately wants you to become. I was forced out of the military due to mental health issues. It feeds off of the Fear and Dismay of others. You will hear him, See him, and feel him. He will torture you in ways I cant even begin to explain. He will talk to you and show you things that will disgust you. You have to ignore it and go on with life as long as you can. Its all a big test. I couldn't figure out how to stop the man, but you can. I've questioned why we keep having children knowing what we know, But I believe we do this so another family doesn't need to suffer. No matter your decision son, do not let the darkness take hold. Do what you must to live life, Keep our secret to yourself, and remember the father I was son. I love you more than you'll ever know. Dad.

I folded the note and put it in my pocket.. I couldn't tell you where my mind was at that exact moment. How do you closet the things I've seen? Do I have it in me to kill someone? My mind went blank and I started to panic. A noise at my door catches my attention.

"Knock Knock." Moms says oddly calm.

"Did you read the letter son?" She said.

"Yea mom I did." I said tears welling.

"Before your father and I got married, He told me the story. I chose to stay with him and take on this burden together.  I chose to give him a son to help end this thing." She said

"Mom, why couldn't dad tell me about this before any of it happened?" I asked.

She explained to me that they didn't tell me because they didn't want my childhood ruined. I understood that but thought maybe a little warning would have went a long way.

"So now I'm cursed?" I asked fearfully.

"Yes son you are." She said calmly again.

Of course I thought it was weird she was so calm, but she did deal with this for the last 20 years. I stood there confused and afraid. A curse pinned to me like an evil little sticky note for later. Nothing I could do or say could make my mind slow down.

"God damn it, A curse huh." I thought to myself.

"Whatever you decide to do son, Ill be behind you the whole way." She said.

"So The Man doesn't bother you at all?" I asked.

"No, That's not how it works son." Shes said.

"As far as your father knew, there were no real rules to follow. The man requires two human souls every five years or you die. That's that." She said.

"Oh great mom, Let me get right on that." My sarcasm bleeding thru my anger.

"Kind of a lot to unpack mom don't you think?" I said.

"You're right Tony, It is a lot to unpack. So unpack it now because you don't have much time." She said.

"What is that supposed to mean mom?" I asked.

My mom was acting as though none of this mattered. Just a mosquito bite on her leg, Nothing more. She sighed and turned her back to walk away. Before going downstairs she turned to me and said.

"You're a good boy Tony. Its your turn to try and end this. I know you can do it son. Your father tried and failed but he tried. He was an amazing man you know that. I don't mean to frighten you son, but this is your reality now. The sooner you accept your fate and move on the sooner this can stop once and for all."

At this point I really started to think I had lost my mind. There was no way this was all happening to me. I was waiting to wake up then I snapped out of it. I remembered how bad my dad had gotten leading up to the night he died. I cant be like that. I cant say I was to enthusiastic about meeting this "man" but I needed to understand what I was up against.

"Ok mom, Ill do it. For dad." I said.

I pulled the cross dad carved from my pocket and held it tight. The thought of a horrible monster coming to see me was unsettling to say the least, But it didn't happen like that at all. After my conversation with mom, we agreed that I should settle in and move back home. I needed to go back to my house to grab a few things. I arrived at my home and started to pack things into my car, then it happened. The lights in my home began to dim. The corners of the room becoming swirling darkness.

"Its nice to finally meet you Tony." A deep dark voice softly said from my living room.

I moved out of my room and slowly crept down the hallway to the living room. There in my living room sitting on my couch was the man. He was quite tall with long arms and long legs. Long sharp finger nails came from his long fingers. Sitting perfectly straight with his hands on his knees. A face like cracked porcelain but with a skin like quality. No hair at all and his lips were pale blue. The eyes are what got me the most. Just two deep black sockets in the face. As I step into the living room the man slowly twists his head towards me and says.

"The slower water is perfect for catching fish son." He said in my fathers voice.

"You're father gave in just like you will. You owe me souls boy and I'm here to make sure that happens." He said darkly

"What are you?" I asked quivering.

"I'm a family friend from way back when, I actually knew your daddy HAHAHA!" He began to manically laugh.

"Please" I begged.

The mans face began to twist with rage. His long arms sticking straight up and lifting himself onto the ceiling. The snapping of bones and the sound of squelching flesh emanating from his movements. Almost spider like he Skittered across the ceiling directly into a dark corner and disappeared. "I've got to get out of here." I thought to myself. As I began to run towards the front door The man stepped out of the darkness and stopped me right in my tracks. He stood directly in front of me silent and still for a moment. He slowly lifted his hand and raised a finger towards my shoulder. He drove his fingernail into my shoulder and grabbed me by the neck with his other hand. White hot pain shot thru my arm and chest like someone set me on fire.

"Remember this pain boy, Its just the beginning. I want my souls or you can join your family." He said thru dagger teeth.

His finger twisting in my shoulder and his grip loosening on my neck I let out a scream.

"HAHAHA Your fear is delicious, much better than your fathers." He said with his tongue outstretched towards me.

The Man pulls his finger back and drops me to the floor. His maniacal laughter so loud the house is vibrating. My ears begin to throb his laughing getting louder and louder. Glass starts to shatter all around me. I cover my ears and close my eyes as I fall into the fetal position. The sound stops almost immediately. I open my eyes and I'm standing up. The house looks completely normal and there's no sign of anything that just happened. The Man had disappeared for now but I knew it wasn't the last Id see of him. I made my way back to my moms. No matter what I kept telling myself, I still felt like I would wake up at any time. The drive back to moms was pretty dark. My mind wondering into parts unknown. I forgot the entire drive when it was all said and done.

I pulled up to my moms house and sat in the car for another ten minutes. I took a deep breath, opened my car door, and made my way into the house. I greeted my mother, not a word spoken about The Man at all. I get to my room and drop into the bed, exhausted from everything. My mind was blank and I was calm. Apparently the man didn't like that much. A hand springs from my mattress under me and covers my mouth while the other arm slithered around my torso and held me against the bed. A face began materializing out of my pillow right next to my head.

"Never forget me, I am you." He whispered into my ear.

I didn't move even slightly. I could feel the fear building inside of me like some sort of fucked up boiler. He was feeding on it and it seemed to delight him. Are the souls just a way to keep the victim fearful? You kill because you're afraid to die, That fear alone seems to satiate its hunger. But how do you not be afraid of something like this. The entire thought was cleansed from my mind at an instant. A long sand paper like tongue scrapped across my forehead down to my neck.

"You owe me boy, and I expect payment." The man said thru a sinister smile.

His arms slithered back into the mattress and his face disappeared into the pillow. A haunting laugh fading into nothing. I began to sob finally breaking down. All of this because of money. "Why?" I kept thinking to myself.

"Why would you put your future generations in jeopardy for wealth" I said out loud. I sigh and wipe the tears

from my face, Remembering my fathers note and the way he said to ignore it. I'm not sure how to do that but I'm going to need to find a way. I passed out and woke up the next morning to an eerie calmness. "How often was this thing gonna show itself to me." I thought. I got thru most of the day pretty normally. Went to bed that night and woke up again with no sign of the man. I could feel him though if that makes sense. His eyes burning into my back.

Five months go by and nothing. Aside from the weird feelings of being watched and whispers every now and then, It was basically uneventful. The thought of killing someone waging a battle in my head with my Morale values. I could understand why my grandfather locked himself away. The feeling of planning a murder is worse than the murder itself it seemed. Id be at work and begin to day dream about how to do it. It honestly made me feel like the monster, but I had no choice. It would be two more years before I finally deposited my first soul. I was on my way home from work one rainy night. "BOY!!" The mans voice piercing my ears. At that moment the steering wheel rips out of my hand and I begin to slide. A car coming the opposite direction swerves out of my way and drives off the road. I screech to an abrupt stop in the middle of the road, hop out of my car, and sprint towards the other vehicle. As soon as I got the car in my sight I can see it had smashed into a tree. I walk to the car and notice movement. I try to open the door but its jammed.

"Hello, Are you ok in there?" I said

"I'm gonna get you out of there!" I yelled.

I grabbed the handle and began to yank the door. The car began to rock violently. I finally get the door to swing open and I see him. The Man is in the backseat smiling, arms outstretched holding the Drivers mouth wide open. The Man slowly moves into the front seat never breaking eye contact with me. He smiles at me and begins to put his arm down the mans throat. The drivers eyes wide with terror and pain. I stood there frozen in horror. I could feel the fear pulsing from me like some aura, And the man was loving it. The drivers eyes turned a foggy white and he slumped over. The Man pulled his arm from inside the driver with a squelch, and began to speak.

"Very good boy, Very good indeed." The Man said in his deep evil voice, "His fear will keep me filled for quite some time."

"Wait please I want to understand." I said. "Why do you keep this up?

"Greed boy, don't you know that's a sin." He said

The Man slithered over the driver and out of the car in front of me. I backed away a few feet and stopped. It was so quiet all of a sudden. Not a single noise besides his voice. He leaned down to me bones creaking.

"You owe me one more soul boy." He said.

"There has to be something I can do to end this." I said thru tears.

The Man outstretched his hand and wiped a tear with his finger. He licked the tear off his finger nail with a disgustful look. An evil smile sprang across his face.

"Its your fear I want boy, Not your sadness." The man said as he turned around and grabbed the drivers body from the car and began to use him like some hellish marionette.

"Don't go camping son!" It screamed in glass shattering screech as he began to move the driver.

"I love you son." It began to chant over and over the drivers limp dangling limbs moving left to right, His mouth hanging agape. He moved closer until the drivers feet were dangling in face. That familiar feeling of pure terror emanating from my body. His evil song flooding my mind like some fucked up hymn. I clinched my eyes shut and covered my ears.

"ENOUUUGH!!!" I screamed so damn loud I nearly passed out.

I opened my eyes and again it was like nothing happened. Again I was clutching the cross my father carved. Like some impulse my body had to this trauma. The driver had succumb to his injuries and it was found to be an unfortunate accident. If I wasn't crazy before I sure felt crazy now. I may not have directly killed the driver but I wasn't strong enough to ignore The Man. I lay here in bed not afraid or sad, but calm. I knew I wouldn't see the man for a while and I still had time to figure out the last soul before my next five years. That night I dreamt of the drivers silhouette dancing in the moonlight on the road. The sound of squelching and bones snapping. The Man standing in the background quiet staring silently smiling. I'm not sure what that dream was but I needed to figure out what was next. I have to find a way to end this curse.
