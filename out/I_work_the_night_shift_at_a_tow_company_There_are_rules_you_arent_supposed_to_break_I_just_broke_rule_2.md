*Rule 2: Don’t answer calls after 3:00 a.m.*

Since you guys are paying attention, I figured I’d tell you a little more about myself. I left a link above for a list of the rules and what I have encountered so far.

Working the night shift wasn’t exactly part of my master plan.

But after a nervous breakdown at my last job, I needed something quiet. Something far away from screaming bosses, impossible deadlines, and the kind of stress that turns your bones to dust.

So here I am. Working overnights at a tow company with a car loan at 26% interest, a binder labeled "New Tuna" that contains everything I need to know about my job... and... this list that some old guy left on my desk.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The system we use is called PulsePoint. It tracks trucks via GPS, lets me assign calls, upload videos, and stream live footage from the field. Each truck is equipped with three cameras: a front-facing dashcam that shows the road, a cabin cam mounted inside to monitor the driver (oh, trust me, they LOVE that), and a rear camera bolted to the back of the truck. Supposedly for "safety." The official reason is to protect us during accidents or disputes.

Unofficially?

I think Henry, or whomever is really running this operation, uses it to make sure wheel lift drivers aren’t driving with their booms down.

My job’s pretty simple.

A call comes in, I log the info, assign it to a driver, and monitor their progress.

That’s it.

No customers. No pressure.

Just me, the screen, and whatever snacks I remember to bring. But I don't think you guys care much about that... and I really need to tell you about what happened this past shift.

The night was going pretty normal. I had Tyler working on heavy duty, Mike on personal property impounds, and Damon on call just in case we got a police call.

It was just after 3:00 a.m. when the phone rang. The sound cut through the silence like a jack knife. The caller ID... blank. Numbers scrambled in a way that didn’t look accidental. I stared for a second too long before answering.

"Thank you for calling Henry's Runners and Wreckers. How can I help you?"

A woman’s voice came through. She was breathless, frantic.

“Please. There’s been an accident. Route 19 just past Wells Hollow. My husband’s unconscious. He won’t wake up.”

Now this was already odd for me because I am not a police dispatcher. The police are the ones who call me, but I was told during my training that it is not unheard of when people are in accidents they sometimes call us after they call the police if the accident is not that bad. I slipped into routine. Got the location, exact coordinates, and entered it into PulsePoint. Assigned the job to Tyler, one of our newer guys, since he was the closest (4 minutes out). We hadn’t met in person, but he seemed solid. Friendly, too. I liked him.

I tried to keep her talking. “Is he breathing? Are you hurt? Do you need help contacting police?”

“I already called them. They said they’re on the way. But someone needs to get the car out of here. It's not safe,” she said.

It made no sense, but I did not argue.

“There was something in the road. He swerved. We hit the guardrail.”

Her voice started to fade. The line went quiet, but I still heard faint breathing. Or something that sounded like breathing.

“Ma’am?”

Click.

I stared at the phone and then at the screen. Tyler’s icon was moving down the highway, closing in on the location. I was just about to call the police to make sure they got a call from her and it wasn't some prank, but the dispatch phone rang. It was Tyler.

“Hey, Rach? I’m here. There’s nothing. No car, no wreck, no people. Just road.”

I pulled up the front-facing dashcam. His headlights stretched ahead into the dark. Just pavement and trees.

I switched to the rear camera.

That’s when I saw it.

Something was there.

Tall. Upright. Just beyond the glow of the taillights.

It wasn’t moving. Not even a little. Not the kind of stillness you expect from a person or an animal caught in headlights. This was different. Intentional. Like it had settled into place long before Tyler ever pulled up.

Like it had been waiting.

The dark clung to it in a strange way. Not like a shadow. More like the world around it didn’t recognize it. As if the light knew something was wrong and chose to pass it by. Not avoiding. Just forgetting.

No features. No face. No eyes. Just a shape. Still. Watching.

But it didn’t feel like it was watching the truck.

It felt like it was watching the camera.

Watching me.

Like it knew I was there. Like it had been aware of me long before I noticed it.

And for a second, I wasn’t sure who was really looking in on whom.

I swallowed. “Tyler... don't get out. Can you check behind your truck? Put the truck in reverse. Do you see anything?”

“Okay?” he asked, unsure why I wanted him to, but doing it anyway. “It’s just trees back there. Why?”

I flipped to the cabin cam to make sure he was looking. He was.

I switched back to the rear cam.

The figure was gone.

Before I could react, the phone rang again. Same scrambled number. I picked up.

“Dispatch.”

“It’s me,” the woman said. Her voice was softer now. Distant. Detached. “Are they coming?... Are you coming?”

I steadied my voice and tried to maintain my composure. “Our driver is already there,” I said. “But he can’t find you.”

“I see you,” she whispered. “He just doesn’t see us.”

I gripped the receiver tighter, uneasy with her choice of words. “Stay on the line. I’ll have him check again.”

I switched back to Tyler.

“Can you drive up and down that stretch one more time? She swears she sees you.”

“Sure,” he sighed, almost as though he had accepted the fact that this was some prank, but I wouldn't. “But there’s still nothing. It’s just empty.”

I watched his headlights scan the road. Nothing. No wreck. No body. No trace.

Before I could speak, the woman’s voice returned. Like she had waited until I came back.

“He’s here with me now,” she whispered.

Quiet.

Too quiet.

“But he’s not breathing.”

My mouth went dry. “Ma’am, who’s with you?”

She hesitated.

“I didn’t make it.”

Then the line went dead.

I stared at the screen. My hands hovered over the keyboard, useless. I switched back to Tyler.

“I’ve looped around twice. Still nothing. Want me to keep looking?”

“No,” I said. “You’re clear. Head back in.”

“Copy that.”

I checked the CRM for that scrambled number. Buried in the history was a note. All it said was:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

DO NOT ANSWER THIS CALL AFTER 3 A.M.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

That morning, when the sky finally started to bleed gray and the weight of night began to lift, I found Carl out in the shop.

Carl was supposed to be retired. At least, that’s what the company email said. But there he was, leaning against the side of his former flatbed, coffee in one hand, cigarette in the other, staring at the concrete like he expected it to crack open beneath him.

I stepped into the shop slowly, still shaken from the night.

“You’re not gone yet?” I asked.

He didn’t look up. “Came to grab my last paycheck,” he muttered. “Left a couple things in the toolbox.”

He took a sip of coffee, then added, almost like it hurt to say it, “Guys like me don’t really retire. We just fade out.”

I hovered in the doorway, unsure if I should bring it up. But the silence between us was too loud, too expectant. So I did.

“I got an email the other day…” I began, not knowing how on earth to explain it.

Carl finally looked at me, eyes unreadable. “You got it, then?”

I nodded. “That was you? It didn’t have a sender. Just a blank address. How did you even do that?”

He didn’t answer. Instead, he took another drag of his cigarette and stared toward the dispatch office.

He stared at me for a moment. Then, almost too softly, he said, “You didn’t reboot after it blinked, did you?”

“It’s not about the window,” he said. “Not really. The window’s just where they knock first.”

“What the hell is going on, Carl? I need direct answers. None of this cryptic shit.” It was a demand, but it came out as a plea.

He just stared at me. His eyes sizing me up. Almost as though he was trying to see if I was ready to hear what he had to say.

“Fuck this. You guys are messing with me,” I said and turned on my heels, starting to head out.

“You spoke to her?” he asked.

The question made me freeze dead in my tracks. I slowly turned around. When our eyes met, he didn’t need to elaborate on who it was.

We both knew.

I nodded.

“I’ve heard that voice before,” he said after a long moment. “It was years ago. Maybe thirty-nine or so. I was new. First year on flatbed. My dad was retiring, so he was showing me the ropes.”

He lit another cigarette. His hands were steady, but his voice had gone low. Empty.

“Call came in from PD. Said a car had swerved off Route 19 near Hollow. They wanted a flatbed because it was too mangled for a wheel lift.”

He looked up at me for a second, then away again.

“I remember pulling up. It was still dark. Police were already on scene, lights spinning through the trees. But there was no one in the car.”

He took a long drag and exhaled slowly.

“There was blood. A lot of it. Driver’s side. Passenger side. Smeared across the windshield. But no bodies. No footprints. No drag marks. Just a warm car and empty seats.”

I stayed quiet. My throat felt tight.

“We waited,” he said. “Watched the cops comb the woods for what seemed like a lifetime before they told us to get the car out of there.”

He glanced at the far wall, like the memory was still playing out there in the shadows.

“They never found anyone. Not that night. Not ever. But that’s not the part that sticks with you.”

I waited.

“The part that sticks,” he said, flicking ash onto the floor, “is that the calls never stopped. Always the same time. Always a number that doesn’t look right. Always the same woman. Thats why you need to follow the rules kid.”

He turned and looked at me again, and I could see it in his eyes now ... the fear he’d been trying not to show.

“She cries. Says her husband isn’t breathing. Begs for help.”

Carl crushed his cigarette under his boot.

“She doesn’t know she’s dead,” he said. “She still thinks someone can save her. Like the crash is still happening.”

I could barely get the question out. “Why didn’t you… someone… tell me?”

Carl laughed, but there was no humor in it.

“Because once you answer, it’s too late. That’s how she finds you. Not through the wreck. Through the phone. Through the ones who pick up.”

He stood slowly, brushing ash off his jeans.

“You think ignoring it will help. That you’ll forget her voice. That the sound of the line cutting out won’t crawl into your dreams. But it doesn’t work like that.”

He looked toward the dispatch office. The monitors were glowing behind the blinds, casting faint white light across the floor.

“She knows who hears her,” he said. “And she remembers every single one.”

I slowly took a step toward him.

“When did you hear her first?”

He didn’t answer.

I swallowed.

“When did you hear her *last*?”

A pause. Too long.

That’s when Tom walked in.

“Carl,” he said. “Your check.”

Carl stood slowly and took it with a nod.

Tom turned to me next. “You should probably be heading home,” he said. His eyes never quite met mine.

And just like that, the moment was gone.

Carl disappeared into the yard, envelope in hand. Tom walked back inside.

And I stood there, alone again. Wondering who would knock next. Or what would answer if I did.
