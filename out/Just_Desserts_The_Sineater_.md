I’ve always known too much. It’s the curse of being the IT admin. Every file, every email, every keystroke—they all pass through my purview. I see the rot beneath the surface, the secrets that make this company a breeding ground for sin.

Roger. Golden boy, Mr. "Can-Do-No-Wrong." Married with kids, yet he thinks every woman in the office should fall to their knees for him—figuratively and literally. First Mary, then Priyam. And Priyam? Don’t let her doe-eyed innocence fool you. She’s as married as Roger, but that didn’t stop her from playing cam girl for him during work hours.

Mary wasn’t much better. Sleeping with a married man, pretending to be virtuous when she was just another fool. She made her bed, and Roger used it. They all disgust me.

Then there’s GM John, siphoning funds through fake invoices and calling it “strategic allocation.” Amarita, I'll just call her the office slut, has bedded half the developers and now has her sights set on that new guy visiting from Dubai. Head of Engineering Mukesh is padding invoices, charging exorbitant rates for consultants we barely need. And Sales? Don’t get me started on slimy Luis. His girlfriends are so young, I'm almost sure they just got their braces off. It’s a miracle the cops haven’t shown up at his door yet.

I see it all. I bear the weight of their sins because someone has to.

Priyam was the one who reached out to me after *the incident*. Her frantic voice on the other end of the line begged me to lock down the video. She wanted it erased, wanted me to pretend it never happened.

"*Christian, please, you have to help me*," she pleaded. Her tone made my skin crawl. How dare she, after flaunting herself on that Slack call like some desperate two-bit OnlyFans reject? How dare Roger, with his flaccid dick out, thinking he was the king of the world while his wife and kids were probably out wishing their dad made more time for them. 

I told her I’d handle it. And I did. ***Just not the way she expected***.

I uploaded the video everywhere—Reddit, forums, even a few shady sites I won’t name. It spread like wildfire, thanks to the curious clicks of our very own colleagues. I heard the whispers in the hallways, the muffled laughter behind closed doors. Roger’s golden image was tarnished. Priyam’s pristine act shattered.

But it wasn’t enough.

The obsession started soon after. The screens became my life. I've always hated Roger. He thinks he's all that. I tracked Roger’s every move, watched Priyam’s resignation play out in humiliating silence, and leaked just enough information to keep the chaos alive. I fed the fire, and I loved every second of it. I even emailed it to Mary, Roger's first office affair, so she can come forward and maybe put the nail in the coffin. I was so gleefully glued to my screen because watching Roger's downfall was just step one. This entire office was ripe with sin, disgusting to the brim, and lust is just one of the sins I can't believe is playing out in the company laptops and phones. They’re all hypocrites. All sinners. And I? I’m the judge, jury, and executioner in this digital world.

Then came the flickers. At first, I thought it was a bug—an artifact of old equipment. But the flickers grew stronger, the images on the screens twisting and distorting. One night, while reviewing yet another email chain incriminating John, the General Manager, I saw something in the monitor. My reflection stared back at me, but it wasn’t just me.

It was darker, sharper, with eyes that seemed to bore into my soul. I blinked, and it was gone.

The phantom appeared fully in the conference room, the night I decided to stay in the conference room. The wall of screens made it so much easier for me to see why John was taking such a soft stance on Priyam and is now trying to send her flowers. He took over Roger's laptop and John has a cache of Priyam’s nudes now. Oh John, not only are you a greedy little asshole, but you are also into married sluts. This is when I knew I needed to take John next. I’d planned to use this cache and catch him jacking off to Priyam as the final blow. Hey, it's absolutely time to burn them all down in one glorious act of justice. But as I sat surrounded by the glow of the screens, the phantom came to life.

It stepped out from the static, its form shifting and crackling with digital noise. Its voice echoed through the room, low and guttural, like it came from the depths of the network itself.

“*Christian, you know too much. You're feeding off their sins,*” it said, “***You're supposed to be the sin-eater, not the sinner.***”

“*I’m cleaning up this place,*” I stammered.

“*No,*” it hissed. “*You’ve become one of them.*”

The screens lit up around me, showing every sin I’d uncovered—every email, every video, every secret I’d weaponized. But now they included me, my face twisted with glee as I orchestrated Roger’s and Priyam’s destruction.

The cables from the equipment began to writhe, slithering across the floor like serpents. They wrapped around my arms, my legs, tightening until I couldn’t move. The phantom loomed over me, its face a grotesque mockery of my own.

“*You thought you could judge them,*” it whispered. “*But who judges you?*”

The cables pulled tighter, and I screamed, the sound swallowed by the hum of the monitors. My vision blurred as the phantom’s face drew closer. The horror wasn't staring into his blank eyes, it's realizing that the phantom has my face, and that the closer he drew, the more I was losing my consciousness. 

When I woke, I was in a hospital bed. I couldn’t speak. I couldn’t move my right side. The doctors called it a stroke, but I knew the truth. The sin-eater had taken its toll, leaving me broken, paralyzed, and silenced.

I’m still here, trapped in my mind, surrounded by screens that flicker with the sins I once thought I could erase. But the phantom was right. I became one of them. And now, I’ll never escape.
