I lay my head down, weary from the day. I seek refuge in the night’s embrace. But rest, peace never comes easily. No matter how heavy my eyelids feel, there’s a creeping uneasiness that gnaws at the edge of my mind. Moments slip into the fragile twilight between wakefulness and sleep and I can feel it, the dread. It isn’t a sudden shock, it’s slow, an insidious pull, like something patiently waiting to swallow me whole.

I wish I could say that sleep offers me a reprieve, but it no longer does. I’ve long given up hoping for peaceful dreams. Shadows that move in the corners of my room are not mere tricks of the light. These are something more. Shifting and stretched, as if reaching for me, closing in with a deliberate slowness.

Staring at my ceiling, trying to push away the mounting terror. My hands feel cold. The weight of them, heavy and immovable, as though I’ve been invaded in ice. I try to move them, but it’s as if my body no longer listens to me. The weight of the day its exhaustion, its tress, the unrelenting pace, hanging  on me like chains. 

The lights on my ceiling, once harmless, now twist and dance in a way that is no longer ordinary. The colors, too bright, too wild, otherworldly. They pulse, as if in sync with the frantic beating of my heart. “This isn’t real”. I know I should be able to fight it off. But the visions persist, growing in intensity. The shadows in the corners of my vision begin to take shape. I blink, trying to clear my mind, but they do not vanish.

Then they arrive. They. 
The creatures. At first, it’s just a flicker of movement, but soon their forms emerge fully from the dark, crawling across the floor, their bodies writhing in unnatural angles. Goblins, or something worse. Their limbs are twisted, sharp-edged things that scrape against the floor with a terrible, hollow sound. Their eyes, glowing with an unnatural light, fixate on me, their hunger palpable. I can hear them breathing low, guttural, and heavy. They move with a terrifying purpose, coming closer, closer still.

My heart is now thundering in my chest. I attempt to scream, but no sound escapes my lips. I want to run, to leap from the bed and flee, but my body is frozen, caught in the grip of terror. I can’t move. My legs are leaden, my body stiff. The air feels thick, as if the very atmosphere has turned to molasses. The creatures are almost upon me now, their sharp claws scraping across the floor. They draw closer, their grotesque forms stretching longer, their eyes widening, glowing brighter. I can feel their presence like a weight pressing down on my chest.

Desperation claws at me cutting deep. “I can’t let them reach me”.” I can’t”. I summon all the strength I have, pushing against the paralysis that holds me down. Slowly, agonizingly, I manage to twist my body, to slide one leg over the edge of the bed. It feels as though I’m moving through thick snow, sluggish, as if my own limbs have forgotten how to move. But the creatures are relentless. I see their arms reatching closer, their bodies bending, contorting as they scramble toward me.

A pulse of fear surges through me as my feet hit the floor with a thud, heavy, as though the very ground beneath me is quicksand, dragging me down. The room seems to stretch and the door that once seemed so near is now miles away. My breath comes in sharp gasps, as cold sweat breaks out across my brow, but I can’t stop. “I can’t stop”. I push forward, my arms flailing as I try to outrun the nightmare that chases me.

Behind me, I hear their screeching, high-pitched and frantic. The sound of claws tearing against the floor echoes like war drums, urging me to run faster. The hallway seems endless, the darkness swallowing all light behind me. I glance over my shoulder and see their forms slithering toward me, faster now, gaining on me with each step. My mind is a whirl of panic. “I can’t outrun them, I can’t”.

When reaching the stairs, stumbling as I rush down. My feet barely land on each step. The sound of beastly movements grows louder, closer, as if they’re on my heels, just a breath away from catching me. I can feel their hot, rancid breath on the back of my neck, the weight of their gaze heavy on my skin. I run harder, faster, but the darkness is endless, the world around me collapsing into shadow. I don’t know where I’m going anymore, but I can’t stop. “I can’t”.

The room behind me, the one I fled, seems so far away now, a distant memory. The creatures, their twisted forms, seem to melt into the very walls around me, as if they are part of the dark itself. My chest tightens, my breath ragged, and my limbs ache with exhaustion. The world bends and twist around me, distorted, as though it is warping to trap me. The hallway stretches impossibly, each step feeling like a mile.

I burst through a door, slamming it   behind me with a deafening crash. The air is thick and stifling, sickening to inhale. I try to turn and find myself locked in another room, surrounded by the unrelenting darkness. But the creatures, those nightmarish things, seem to have vanished. Or perhaps, they have simply stopped following.

I wait, trembling, my heart hammering in my chest. The silence is thick, oppressive, and the stillness is far more terrifying than the chase. I know they are still there, somewhere, hidden in the shadows, watching, waiting.

I want to move. I want to run. But the fear holds me in place, and I know deep down that there is nowhere I can run where they won’t find me. The creatures are not just nightmares, they are my own fears, my own insecurities, and they will never let me go.
