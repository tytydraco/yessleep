To whoever finds this,



I am Officer Paul Wilkins of the United States Space Force. I know it sounds like a joke. I can distinctly remember laughing with some coworkers about the idea of fighting aliens in some sci-fi spaceship or another. I don’t expect you to respect my work; hell, I didn’t until recently. I’ve tried to write this about four times before now, and every time I can’t get through it. The memory of the events I’m going to describe haunts me like a ghost; remembering, even in passing, brings me great pain. Writing this down is the closest form to self-harm that I can perform without something sharp, something poisonous, or something equally as deadly. But this time I’m documenting everything, and nothing’s going to stop me. I don’t have to be afraid of anything anymore. By the time this leaks to whoever is insane enough to believe it, I’ll be long dead. There's nothing left for me here, now with what I've learned.

	

Attached is my recollection of the events surrounding the discovery of the planet 621-A, or, as it is better known, Aires. I’m not surprised if this planet is unknown to you; I’d be more surprised if you recognized its name. It was recently discovered by a recruit of the United States Space Force while surveying known planets. I’m not sure how he found it, nestled in some far-flung corner of space in a solar system that contained only it, its corresponding moon, and a yellow dwarf star. If I knew at the time that he would stumble upon it, I would have done everything in my power to stop him. For my failure in this regard, I apologize deeply.

	

But let me be clear and say I’m not writing this as a suicide note. This isn’t a last will and testament, it’s not a place for me to point fingers at people who may or may not have driven me over the edge. This is an apology. To whom in particular?



Everyone. Everyone you've ever known, ever loved, ever encountered, or thought of in some waking moment. What my team and I did during what seemed at the time to be business as usual has brought the end of this world, whether you believe me or not. 



With sincerest apologies,

Paul W. Wilkins

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  




The earliest thing that I can still remember from that Wednesday morning is talking in the break room with my colleagues. Johan was a six-foot-two mountain of a man, he looked like something out of some Norse myth or another. He was one of the newer recruits of the space force, only joining about a year or so ago. Truth be told, I’d never gotten to talk to him until a few months ago. Once they’d transferred him to my sector, it was like we’d known each other for years. You ever met someone and it felt like an old friend that you’re reconnecting with instead of a stranger? Johan was that to a t.



Ben was…unique. He was an older guy, probably the oldest we had in the Space Force if I had to guess. He never gave a straight answer about his age, “Old enough” is how he put it to anyone who dared ask. If you didn’t know him, he easily came off as standoffish, maybe even nasty or unlikable. That’s how he’d come off to me when I first signed onto the Space Force, at least. I know better now; Ben is a good man, rough around the edges and caring to his core.



I don’t remember what we talked about that day in the breakroom. It could’ve been some movie we had all seen, maybe some TV show, I don’t know. Whatever it was, I remember being mid-sentence when one of the newer recruits burst into the room. He was a younger man, in his early to mid-twenties, if I had to guess. With his hair cut short and his gaze excited, he reminded me almost of a weasel popping out of a burrow.



“I found something! It’s a new planet, I think! Do you think, um…is that possible? No, it was definitely a planet! I swear, it was-”



Living up to his look, Ben gave a sneer that wouldn’t have been out of place on a comic book villain and snapped back.



“You sure you didn’t just smudge the lens of the telescope? Because if I come over there and find out this ‘planet’ looks an awful lot like your fingerprint, I’m not going to let you live it down.”



I couldn’t help laughing, but a part of me felt for the new guy; I still remember the endless series of challenges labeled “basic” and all the mistakes I'd personally made. Neither here nor there, but I didn't see the outburst as one of stupidity or boastfulness. He was excited, a hard worker who finally found his endless nights wide awake in a textbook paying off. I didn't see him as some bumbling idiot like Ben might have.



“I don’t know, the kid could’ve gotten lucky…”



Glancing over at him, I could see a faint smile cross his lips. I returned it, appreciating the enthusiasm. I could only imagine the excitement he felt when he saw what, in his mind, could only have been a planet. I could imagine even more vividly how it must have felt to have it all torn down by some grouchy old prick for seemingly no reason. Johan must have felt the same way because I watched him smile brightly at the new recruit as he jokingly put his hands up in a faux surrender.



“Alright, alright, slow down. I get you’re excited, but let’s make sure it’s something worth celebrating first, alright?”



I could practically watch the recruit rebuild his resolve in real-time. His eyes, taking a particular interest in the floor after Ben’s chiding, now rose to meet Johan’s. He nodded a soft yes as he turned to lead everyone to his workstation. The telescope he was using sat looming on a platform above a flight of stairs, drawing us up like moths to a curious flame. Before the recruit could approach the telescope, Ben thrust out an arm, blocking him from continuing toward it. Immediately, despite the way he’d acted earlier, he seemed to backpedal on just how rough he felt like being. Facing the recruit with a look closer to neutrality than the mocking one he wore earlier, he nodded as if to accept the sighting as potentially accurate.



“Here, let me take a look first. Ok?”



I could tell the recruit wasn’t a fan of the order of things, but he solemnly nodded and let Ben approach the telescope first. In the meantime, Johan tapped him on the shoulder, shooting off a few questions to try and learn more about the man’s supposed discovery.



“What color was it? How big would you say it looked? Was it near any known planets? What dire-”



All questioning was silenced as Ben slowly stepped away from the telescope and turned to face us. For the third time in the past half hour, his expression had changed. That was quite a feat for someone who usually flip-flopped between playfully (if a little flippantly) sarcastic and stoic. Now his mouth hung open in a look almost akin to excitement, his finger lifting to point at the recruit. For a tense few seconds, no one was quite sure what exactly he was doing. Before we could question him, he burst out in a cheerful exclamation.



“Holy shit kid, you weren’t kidding! Johan, Paul, come look at this!”



All at once, the recruit's face lit up like a Christmas tree, his suspicions confirmed in a way that seemingly no one could oppose. Johan beat me to the telescope, peeking into its lens excitedly. The recruit and I listened intently to his murmurings, a mental image of the supposed planet forming in my mind.



“It’s orangish-red, oh, just like Mars! And it has a moon! That has to be the biggest moon I’ve ever seen! That’s got to be at least three times the size of ours!”



I couldn’t wait any longer after that. Gently, I ushered the amazed Johan away from the telescope. Immediately, his eyes locked on the recruit, and the two began to talk about what seemed to be a major discovery. Meanwhile, Ben remained beside the telescope, gesturing excitedly for me to take a look. I crossed the space between the two of us, looking at him for some sort of response. He gave none, clearly more focused on letting me see for myself. Not wanting to be left out of this ocular voyage any longer, I pressed an eye to the telescope.



What I saw was, to put it in the most straightforward word I can, alien. The planet the recruit had found was a large sphere of red with orange splotches. Ben was right in comparing it to Mars, I couldn’t have found a more apt description if I had tried. In fact, the planet looked so similar to Mars that, for a brief second, I considered checking whether this was some elaborate practical joke that everyone else was in on. This thought, though, was completely abandoned when my eye focused on the moon. This was no Deimos or Phobos, no; this…thing, I can barely describe it as a moon due to its size. It was enormous, and that's enough of an understatement to borderline on falsehood. I suddenly agreed with Ben about the thing being three times bigger than ours; hell, I would wager it was more like five times, six, maybe even seven. Other than that, it looked very similar to our own moon, but that one detail stood out like a sore thumb. For reasons I couldn't explain, I felt cold chills shock my spine. Something about this whole thing was wrong; it was impossible. 



How could a planet that appeared to be almost a carbon copy of Mars have a moon that size? It didn’t make sense.



For the rest of the workday, I couldn’t help but retreat into myself while the world buzzed around me. Supervisors were called in, praises were sung for the young recruit who seemed to be on track to gain one hell of a position. Ben and Johan were the most excited I'd ever seen them, especially the former. They never left the recruit’s side, seemingly cleared of any doubts as to the young man's abilities. Even Ben was apologizing for his attitude. Everyone seemed so tied up in the moment that I didn’t expect anyone to realize I had even gone back to my desk. I knew I should’ve been celebrating with them, I even felt a little guilty about seemingly ignoring the planet’s discoverer in what could have easily been confused as a jealous sulking.



But I couldn’t get past the size of the moon. How was it so big? How did it defy gravity like that? How did no one else seem to mind?



When I felt a hand on my shoulder I damn near fell out of my chair. Turning to look at the mystery person, I found the face of the recruit, a sheepish look on his face.



“Oh, sorry! I didn’t um…I didn’t mean to scare you…I just wanted to say that we’ve settled on a name for the planet and its moon…oh, and the sun!”



Scared as I was of both of those things, the soft smile of the recruit lessened the blow a little in the moment. I returned a smile, cocking my head to the side a little in confusion.



“Oh, already? What did you guys settle on?”



“The sun is Sol, and the moon is Mani! Johan came up with them and they stuck!”



He paused for a moment, seemingly wondering whether he should explain the significance of the names that were chosen or whether it would simply be ignored. I knew well why at least one of those names had been chosen; Johan had always said he wanted to name a moon Mani after one of the gods of his ancestors. Considering he had originally come from Norway, I had always thought it was fitting. Still, I figured that I would let the recruit have his moment in the spotlight and explain the names he partly bestowed. After all, he'd seemed to so graciously let someone he hardly knew share in his spotlight.



“Oh? Why those names?”



He perked up immediately, clearly taking pride in being asked a question rather than being the one to ask them for a change.



“Oh, those are the names of the moon god and the sun goddess in Norse mythology! We figured because of the um…”

	

He paused, evidently trying to think of a word that encapsulated the unusual size of the “Mani”. It took only a handful of seconds, but the absence of words to explain the damned thing made my fear of it feel all the more justified.



“...*unbelievable* size of the moon that it deserved the title of a moon god. And, since we used Mani for the moon, it just made sense that the sun should be Sol!”



That word seemed to encapsulate everything I felt about that alien moon. *Unbelievable,* by every metric of the word. A body like that should not exist in any solar system. I knew it was wrong by the feeling of terror that crept through my body like a centipede, injecting venom into my veins from the moment my eyes found Mani. Still, I swallowed my fear and slowly nodded to the recruit, continuing to plaster a smile on my face that I hoped was convincing enough.

	

“I like it! Oh, what did you name the planet, by the way?”



The minute my words hit his ears, he looked as if he had remembered something of great importance and reverence.



“Oh, it’s Aires! You know, since it looks so much like Mars…”



Another short pause, thankfully one that didn’t leave me to stew in fear. After all, the planet had looked quite normal. We’d found planets similar to ones in our solar system many times over, a planet looking almost identical to Mars wasn’t cause for alarm unless you believed in Martians.



“...And Aires is Mars’ Greek counterpart.”



I nodded once more, the same fake smile on my face. But, before I could say anything, the man perked up again as if he had forgotten something especially important.



“Oh, almost forgot! We’re all going out for drinks tonight to celebrate! I wanted to make sure you knew you were invited!”



For a moment, I almost declined the offer. I had already heard and seen more than I liked of that damned planet and its moon, and the idea of a night of drinking devoted to celebrating it damn near made bile rise to the back of my throat. Then, I really thought about it. After today, the first thing I needed was a stiff drink, the second thing was relaxation, and the third thing was some sleep. If I drank enough, I could probably achieve all three of those things surrounded by friends and colleagues rather than alone with my thoughts.



“Oh, s-sure! I’ll be there!”



For just a moment, I was worried the recruit would see the crack in my calm exterior. I didn’t want to scare him. What would that accomplish? At best, I’d be the crackpot conspiracy theorist of the Space Force by tomorrow, and at worst, I’d lose my job for scaring away new recruits with a lot of potential. Thankfully, it seemed that he hadn’t realized my intense fear regarding his discovery. Instead, he just gave one last, warm smile.



“Ok, perfect! See you tonight! Oh, it’s Polly’s pub, the one on 4th Street? I’ll send you the directions. Do you mind if I ask for your phone number?”



When the recruit left for his desk and I was all alone again, I went back to my thoughts on the strange moon and its Mars-like planet. Surely it had been an issue with the telescope? I was never at the top of my class in physics, but even I could figure out that, if anything, the planet should have been orbiting the moon. So how, then, did such a small planet have such a large body in its grasp? Surely it was a trick of the light, an optical illusion, something. I refused to believe what everyone else seemed to grasp so easily, and it twisted my mind with unholy force.



What happened next I can’t explain. One moment I was toying with the idea of the moon being some strange optical trick, and the next I was overcome with intense drowsiness. It felt like I hadn’t slept in days when, just the previous night, I had slept fine as I always did. I slumped over at my desk, unable to find the energy or the strength in my failing body to keep myself upright. My breathing slowed, my heart slowed; I screamed in silence for someone, anyone to help me, to bring me to a doctor. My eyes slammed shut like twin security doors. Suddenly, I was left alone in a darkness of my own creation, and I could feel my consciousness fading more and more by the second. I stopped breathing, my heart went silent. I could feel my brain shutting down piece by piece. First my eyes, then my ears, my nose, my mouth, and my throat. I was so numb I choked on my esophagus, found my tongue a swollen demon in my own mouth. I had never understood the horror of true sensory deprivation before that point, and even now, knowing my death is imminent, it seems a worse fate if I’m to pick between the two.



When I awoke, it was not to the sound of a coworker’s voice or the stinging cold of my frigid, metal desk. Instead, to my complete confusion, it felt as though I were lying atop a pile of coarse, grainy sand. I opened my eyes and lifted my face from the surface it had sat upon, only for my eyes to be greeted with…red? It coated my face, some of my torso, crusting in my right eye. The realization didn't strike me at first; for a moment, I was convinced that I had passed out, smashing my head into my desk. After all, I could explain the blood; I could very easily understand its presence in this situation. But this wasn’t any sort of blood I had ever encountered. I was never much of a biologist (biochemistry classes withstanding), but I was certain that blood was, in any form it could take, never a powder. My mind swirled for an explanation and ultimately found none.



The next thing I realized upon getting to my knees was what I was wearing. It would be more accurate to say I realized what I wasn’t wearing. For reasons I either didn’t remember or was never aware of in the first place, I was completely and utterly naked. I reflexively reached down to cover myself, but that impulse only kept my attention until my eyes rested on the surface that stretched out around me. Sand, yes, this was most certainly some sort of sand. But where in the office, or anywhere else in the state of Virginia, for that matter, was there a source of reddish-orange sand? A feeling of dread unknowingly hinted at the answer as I forced myself to unsteady feet, stumbling for a few steps before gaining my balance. It was then that I took a glimpse at the sky.



For as far as my eyes could see, there was a pure, milky white. The best way I can describe it would be to liken it to what a stick figure doodled in the notebook of some bored student would see as the backdrop to his paper-bound world. There were no stars, no planets, no sun. And yet, for as much as it should have been pitch black…the world was full of light. I could see every inch of sand that stretched out in all directions like the mother of all deserts with an accuracy I had never experienced before. And, when I thought about that for the first time, I realized something more. Ever since I was a young boy, I needed glasses to see more than a few feet in front of my face. If I think hard enough, I can still remember all those weekday mornings when my mother scolded me about losing them one way or another as we tore the house apart trying to find them. But there I stood, my vision as perfect as I could have ever wished for, and my glasses were nowhere to be found. 



At that moment, I felt a fear I still can’t describe. I had to sit back down, my heart in my throat pounding presto like a manic drummer. Every breath stung like inhaling open flames. I had been trained to keep my composure all throughout boot camp, but this was something new altogether. I could handle battle or angry superiors or ghastly wounds; they were all knowns, but this was a completely unknown situation, and it terrified me to my core. I hadn’t even acknowledged the tears streaming down my face when I realized a sound that had surely been among the other facets of this hellish place since I had first arrived. It was a chant, a song, and it was in no language I could recognize. A choir of voices rang out in unison, singing words unknown and horrific.



“Z’gnac…Zagaz…Ærebor Zagazen…Zagaz, Zagaz, Zagaz…”



In a moment of clarity, I recognized that final, repeated word. As the chorus rang out, again and again, I searched my mind for where I had heard it. There was no clear answer, but it stuck with me all the same. It melted into the folds of my brain, inserted itself into my language. I remembered back to a mandatory Spanish class I had taken in my Sophomore year of high school, and how the teacher could translate words from Spanish to English and back again without effort. I hadn’t understood how she had managed to do it then, but it suddenly made all the sense in the world. As the chorus continued speaking their nonsense words again and again somewhere far away, I found myself speaking aloud to myself.



“Zagaz…sky…Zagas…sky…”



Then, just as my first moment of clarity had come, a second followed.



“Z'gnac…we see…Z'gnac…we see…”



And then, as my head pounded with a searing pain, the rest of the words’ meanings became known to me at once.



“Z'gnac…Zagaz…Ærebor Zagazen…a’kanos lo ero…We see…pale sky…a holy, pale sky, pale sky, pale sky…”



My heart quickened from presto to prestissimo as I slowly glanced toward the sky, dredging up the courage to take it in for the second time. It showed just as bright as before, as near to blinding as could be, while still allowing for extended viewing. I hadn’t taken it in as I was coming to my senses, but now my mind raced as I thought of the implications. Why was the sky white? Why was the sky white? I asked myself the same question over and over, trying to make sense of it all. And then, at once, I understood. A pale sky…the light of-



“Paul! Paul! Jesus, Paul!”



I screamed in terror as my head registered the cold floor beneath me. Warm blood oozed through my hair, matting it to my neck. When I forced myself to open my eyes, I saw what must have been the entire sector standing around me with a myriad of expressions on their faces. A few looked shocked, some simply looked concerned, and some looked ready to faint, surely a result of the blood. The first person I recognized from the crowd was Ben, who had knelt beside me and quickly gotten to work at putting pressure on my wound. It was, apparently, gruesome enough to bring out the EMT training he had told me about at least a dozen times over the years.



“Everyone back the fuck up! Move!”



He barked at the crowd, who listened like frightened sheep as he helped me to sit up. It wasn’t five seconds before he was launching questions at me.



“What the hell happened? Are you dizzy? Which hospital should we take you to?”



The only question I managed to answer before blacking out again was the first one, and even then, my answer wasn’t very helpful.



“There was a white sky and red sand…”



\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The next two days after this point are a blur to me. I remember the voices of people I knew, voices of people I didn’t. Sometimes they left me alone, sometimes they tried to talk to me, and other times they just talked to each other. I can remember Ben speaking to me in a solemn tone, Johan with him some days, and others not. I remember an ever-changing roster of doctors and nurses checking vitals or seeing if I had finally come to my senses enough to answer their questions.

	

Unsurprisingly, after what I'd experienced on that day at work, being borderline unconscious for a couple of days was a blessing. I had no dreams, or, at least, had no dreams that I can remember. When I finally did slip into the void, it was quick, painless, and I would awaken hours later in what could have been any length of time to me. I didn’t have visions, but I could still think. It’s a strange feeling, being unconscious while still retaining your thoughts. The best thing I could liken it to would be a sensory deprivation tank, one unrivaled and unmatched by its efficiency. In many ways, I miss how carefree this period was, how little fear I held for the horrors I had seen or the injuries I had sustained.

And then, at eleven fifteen a.m. on my second day at the hospital, I woke up.



While everyone who came to see me celebrated, I was left in a despair that none of them could ever understand. I wanted to go back to the gentle darkness, I had to if I wanted to stay sane. But, as the days went on, I managed to pull myself together the best I could. After all, could I really let some hallucination ruin the rest of my life? Could I really let some nightmare take away what I had spent years building? At noon the next day, as the doctors cleared me for discharge, I decided that I couldn’t.



Have you ever come home after a stay in the hospital to an empty home? It’s a strange feeling, I can say that for certain. Everything was exactly how I had left it before work on the day of the discovery, but something about it felt wrong, felt alien. After so much time spent perceiving nothing but your thoughts, the idea to make yourself a meal in your kitchen or sit down on your couch and watch something on your flatscreen TV is jarring. I paced around the house for a good ten minutes, checking out every nook and cranny of the space I knew like the back of my hand. Even then, I still felt out of place. Something was wrong.



Ultimately, I decided that, at least for today, getting out of the house would be a better bet than moping around. I’ve always been a fan of hiking, and there’s a beautiful hiking trail about half an hour from home. In the past, when work has followed me home and left me feeling stressed, I’ve found my solace among the trees and the rivers of my beloved Lubber Run. The moment the thought crossed my mind to hike, I was surprised that it hadn’t occurred sooner. The sun was warm and bright in the afternoon sky, and a gentle breeze and some picturesque clouds were the cherries on top. It was as if Mother Nature herself had seen me coming home and wanted to try and cheer me up. I happily accepted her attempt.



The trail was just as picturesque as the day itself. Birds flew by overhead and came to rest in the verdant branches of the many pines and oaks that lined the path. Squirrels and rabbits chased each other through the foliage, and I thought I caught a glimpse of a white-tailed buck elegantly making his way through the maze of trees off in the distance. My plan had worked, and I could immediately feel my stress melting away. The dream that I had been forced to witness so many days ago seemed exactly what it was: a twisted, dark fever dream, likely the child of an overworked mind. I almost laughed when I thought of the idea of my mind needing a break badly enough to torment itself to get its point across. Maybe I’d have to go out drinking sometime soon and get some revenge.



About an hour into my walk, I felt a nagging tension growing in the pit of my stomach. At first, I chalked it up to paranoia; after all, I was still in the very early aftermath of my incident at work, and I was sure that I wasn’t fully over the injury. Then there were the days I spent unconscious in the hospital and, of course, that horrible dream. I had become so invested in wrestling with my sudden dread that I hadn’t realized the fact that I had stopped walking altogether. I felt glued to the spot I stood as if I were a statue pinned to my base by rods of foundational iron within me. For whatever reason, no matter how hard I tried, my body refused to move from where it stood. Surprisingly, I felt no fear at realizing this, almost as if it were some normal event I had experienced a thousand times over.



By the time I broke through my trance, I was gazing into a black abyss of stars, and the woods around me had become a void of unknown fauna and calls of birds I could no longer see. As soon as I realized this, I snapped my head back downward, pulling it away from the blackened sky. I reached for my phone, finding it in my right pocket as it always was, and turned on the flashlight. Luckily, despite being out for what was apparently somewhere in the ballpark of seven hours, my phone still had a charge of forty-two percent. I turned around to follow the trail back to my car, deciding to chalk today up to the wispy remains of the mental trauma I had sustained, a fugue state, or some other such mental glitch. But as I began to walk again, a thought broke through my explanation and stopped me dead in my tracks once more.



When had I started looking at the sky?



My mind whirled to provide some sort of explanation, but I was at a complete and total loss. Even if I had started to look to the sky, there was no reason I could think of that I would have been stuck doing it for several hours, let alone not being able to move while doing it. The dread that filled the pit of my stomach bloomed into full-blown panic as the memory of my coworkers and me first laying eyes on Aires and its terrible moon came to the forefront of my mind. What angle had the telescope been set at? There was no way, I refused to believe I had been doing that. I forced the thought from my mind as my pace quickened from a walk to a speed walk to a full-on sprint.



I reached my car a panting, sweating mess, and immediately threw the door open and clambered inside. I threw the door shut and must have hit the “lock doors” button on my car key at least a dozen times before I felt some semblance of safety. This illusion was immediately broken when I forced the key into the ignition and started my car. It whirred to life, the radio immediately starting up to a jazz station I had tuned it to earlier in the hope of calming myself on my drive to Lubber Run. But the music didn’t matter in the slightest to me at that moment. What mattered instead was the number that read white and bold at the top right of the display. When I turned on my phone to use the flashlight function, the clock had read 8:09 p.m. I know, and I would bet my life on it, that it should have taken me a little over an hour to get back to my car if I walked, and about thirty-five minutes if I ran the whole way as I had. The digital display on the console of my car read something very different.



“2:39 a.m.”
