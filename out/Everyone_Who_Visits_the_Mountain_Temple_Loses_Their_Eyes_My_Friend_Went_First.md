The snow trapped us in that mountain village for days, but looking back, I think it was the only thing trying to keep us alive.



The snow had fallen early that year. Markets were now empty, deserted. People scarcely left 

their homes.



“When do you think we’ll be able to get out?”



“The housekeeper said soon. The sky should clear up in a few days,” David said.



“Did you ask why it's so bad this year?” I asked.



He didn’t answer my question.



In a few days, the paths cleared up.



We prepared our stuff and got down to breakfast. That day, the owner’s son was the one serving it. 



He came down and sat with us, serving tea. 



“Why did you come to ….?” He asked.



“To explore …. temple.”



He stopped and stared deep into my eyes.



“That place has not been used for a long time. People there often disappear. The ones who came back are….different.”



“They probably don’t know what they’re doing,” David said and laughed.



I put both hands over my face. The owner’s son stared at David, one eyebrow raised, silent. David kept chuckling about his joke.



The owner’s son got up and walked to another room. He came back with two beaded necklaces.



“A gift for us?” David said, raised his eyebrows, and smiled.



I’ve had enough.



“Can you shut up and try to be respectful for a minute?”



“Jeez, okay,” He rolled his eyes.



“Take it,” the owner’s son said.



He forced it into our hands and walked away.



“Strange,” David said and chucked the necklace on the pillow next to me.



My head started to pulse.



Why did he have to be like this?



We got up and left, not talking to each other.



The climb up the mountain was mild at first but grew steadily steeper.



I heard David wheezing behind me. 



The higher we climbed, the more the path morphed into a rocky, barren terrain.



Soon, we were climbing up the rocks instead of walking.



My palms were sweating, worsening my grip.



All other animals, except vultures, were gone.



Those birds stared us down. They didn’t move an inch, even when we got closer.



The familiar feeling of being an outsider crept up in my chest.



When we got to the top, my body was sweaty, and my muscles ached.



David soon climbed up behind me, panting.



Around us, tall peaks pointed all the way up to the clouds like needles with nothing but rocks around.



The whole mountain valley was bare, no trees, no grass, only the vultures.



It felt like the place was screaming at us to leave.



All this made it more surprising to see a beautiful structure situated right in the center of the valley.



It was as if it defined the place itself. Tall dark marble pillars supporting a carefully crafted timber roof with a beautiful set of stairs and a patio. 



“Oh my god,” said David.



“That thing is beautiful.”



We walked towards it as if a certain energy was pulling us inside.



“Look at these pillars. What do you think they’re made of?” David asked.



“Marble probably.”



His eyes glowed as he ran his arm over the stone.



A certain feeling of motherly warmth began burning inside me as soon as I touched the stone.



As I walked up the steps, the warm feeling inside me grew.



David followed close after me.



I barely touched the door before it opened instantly.



The inside was even more beautiful.



The walls were covered with silky white paper with eyes painted over it in varying styles from abstract to full-on realistic.



An altar stood in the center of the room with the same marble pillars and timber roof.



On it sat a golden statue of a monk with a wheel behind him. 



Every step towards the statue made my warmth grow.



I looked over at David. His eyes opened, and his smile widened.



We both slowly walked towards the statue.



David looked at me, and he slowly reached his hand out and touched the statue's head.



A loud bang.



The wheel behind the statue began spinning.



We both stood still, hypnotized by what we were seeing.



The gold from the statue broke and fell to the ground.



Underneath it was a white monk with a bright orange robe. His eyes were the size of half his face with bright blue irises.



Behind him, the wheel had the same eyes as the monk. They wouldn’t break eye contact as they kept on spinning.



I looked around. The painted eyes on the walls were staring at us, too.



It made me feel finally seen. All the attention I never got.



Then the monk put up his right hand and began speaking.



His voice carried like a wind in the forest, his words soft and tender.



It was in a language I didn’t know, but my mind could understand every word.



His thoughts were beautiful.



Any worry I had before was long gone.



David and I knelt and looked at each other. We both knew what we had to do.



David went first. He fished in his backpack, pulling out his hunting knife.



He took the blade and put it right in front of his face.



His hands began to shiver, but then the monk raised his voice.



Looking straight ahead, David stabbed the blade into his eye, not making a noise, not even a grimace, slowly pulling it out.



I was proud of him.



Then he did the other. He put them in his hand and clenched his fist. Slowly getting up, he walked over before the monk bent down in front of him and put his eyes on the ground.



It was my turn.



My mind was at peace.



I took my backpack and searched for the knife, but then my hand brushed over the beads.



The warm feeling was gone. Fear ran up and down my spine.



I clenched the beads.



The melody was gone. I couldn’t understand the words anymore.  The monk’s voice turned low and harsh.



His thoughts turned into static.



I dropped my bag, holding my head.



David slowly got up and looked my way.



Two gaping holes faced me.



The monk yelled and pointed at me.



My legs started shaking. I turned around and ran out the door, only stopping next to the cliff.



Looking back, David walked out.



He was turning his head around, trying to see where I was, like he still had his eyes.



“David?” I tried to call out to him.



His face turned my way, and he began sprinting towards me.



My heart sank.



He was so fast. Before I managed to start climbing, he was already holding me.



His face was still and cold. He was now speaking in the monk’s language.



We wrestled next to the cliff.



He threw me to the ground, mounted me, put his fingers over my eyes, and started pressing on them.



I clenched the necklace in my right fist and hit David over the head.



He slowly fell to his side and then rolled off the cliff.



Looking down, he was impaled on one of the rocks.



I only managed to collect my thoughts at the bottom of the cliff. My hand was still clutching the beads.



When I came back to the Inn, the owner’s son looked down and nodded.



He was holding David’s necklace in his hand.
