​I work the graveyard shift for Pacific Grid, a utility sub-station tucked away in the rain-drenched woods of Oregon. It’s a dead-end job in a concrete monolith that smells of ozone and old coffee. My job is simple: monitor the grids and answer emergency calls from the field. Most nights, the only thing I talk to is the silence.

​Last night, at 2:47 AM, the silence broke.
​The console on my desk didn’t just ring; it shrieked. I looked at the caller ID, expecting a frantic lineman or a disgruntled customer. Instead, the screen flickered with a message that shouldn’t have been possible: "INTERNAL EXTENSION - 000".

​My blood turned to ice. Extension 000 belongs to the sub-basement server room. That floor was welded shut back in the 90s after a catastrophic flood. There isn't even a functioning phone line down there anymore.
​I picked up the receiver, my knuckles white. "This is Ethan. Who is this?"

​At first, there was only the sound of rushing wind—a howling, violent gale that seemed to roar through the earpiece, even though the air in my office was deathly still. Then, amidst the static, I heard a metallic click.
​Click. Click. Click.

​It was the rhythmic sound of a Zippo lighter being flicked open and shut. I looked down at my own hand. I was fidgeting with my Zippo, a nervous habit I’ve had for years. I stopped instantly. The sound in the phone continued for one more second, then echoed my silence.

​"Who is this?" I demanded, my voice cracking. "Some kind of prank?"
​A voice answered. It was deep, gargled, as if the person were speaking through a mouthful of silt and stagnant water.
"Ethan... do you remember the basement?"
​I couldn't breathe. The room felt like it was shrinking.

​"The water is rising, Ethan," the voice whispered. It sounded wet. Distant. "You didn't open the door that day. You were so afraid of the dark, weren't you? You left me in the dark."

​In 2005, my younger brother disappeared in the cellar of our farmhouse during a flash flood. The police said he’d been swept into the drainage pipe. But I knew. I remembered the frantic scratching on the cellar door that night. I remembered being too paralyzed by fear to turn the latch.

​"This isn't funny," I hissed, tears stinging my eyes. "How do you know about my brother?"
​Suddenly, the voice shifted. It lost its watery rasp and became clear. Perfectly clear. It was my voice. My exact pitch, my exact inflection.

"I’m not your brother, Ethan," the voice said with a chilling calmness. "I’m what you left behind to become part of the dark."
​Then, I heard it. The building’s industrial elevator—the one tagged 'Out of Service' for a decade—started to groan. I heard the cables straining, the heavy metal box ascending floor by floor.
​Ding.

​The sound of the elevator doors opening in the hallway outside my office echoed perfectly through the phone line.
​Thump... drag... thump... drag...

​Something heavy was being pulled across the linoleum floor. I turned my eyes to the grainy CCTV monitor. In the dim, flickering light of the hallway, a shape emerged from the elevator. It was vaguely human, but its limbs were impossibly long, bent at angles that defied anatomy. It moved with a sickening, twitching gait.

​It was holding an ancient, rotary telephone handset to where its ear should have been. A black cord trailed behind it, disappearing into the dark maw of the elevator shaft, stretching all the way down to the flooded basement.

​The creature tilted its head toward the camera. It had no eyes, no nose—just a wide, jagged mouth that remained frozen in a silent scream.

​The voice in my ear spoke again, synchronized with the movement of the creature's jaw on the screen:
"I’m in the hallway, Ethan. Will you open the door this time? Or should I use my key?"
​I looked down at my desk. My office keys, which had been sitting next to my coffee just a minute ago, were gone.

​At that exact moment, I heard the unmistakable sound of metal sliding into the lock of my office door. The call was still active. The timer on the screen began to count down... but it started from zero and went into negative seconds.

​The door handle began to turn.

The doorknob turned with agonizing slowness. Whatever was on the other side wasn't in a hurry; it knew I had nowhere to go. My office was a windowless concrete box, and that door was the only way out.

​I glanced at the phone screen. The timer now read -01:14. The seconds were ticking upward in the negative, as if time were bleeding backward, or as if I were slipping into a different kind of "now."

​"Ethan..." The voice came from behind the door this time, not through the phone. It was wet—a gargling, rhythmic sound, like someone trying to speak with lungs full of silt. "Open the door. It’s cold out here, just like it was that day."

​I backed away until my desk hit the rear wall. I scrambled frantically for anything to use as a weapon, my fingers closing around a heavy pair of industrial shears and a steel letter opener.

​The knob stopped turning. A sudden silence followed—a silence far more terrifying than the scratching. Then, I heard a sound from below. From under the gap of the door.

​A dark liquid began to seep into the room. It wasn't oil, and it wasn't blood. It was stagnant, brackish water. It smelled of dead fish and rusted iron. The water began to flood the carpet with an impossible speed.
​Suddenly, the phone shrieked again. I picked up the receiver instinctively.

"Can you feel the chill, Ethan? That’s the feeling that stayed with me for years."
​"I’m sorry!" I screamed, tears stinging my eyes. "I was a kid! I was scared!"
​"Fear isn't an excuse," the voice hissed. But this time, I felt a cold breath directly against the back of my neck.

​I spun around. No one was there, but my office chair was soaking wet. It was dripping salt water, and the leather was stained as if someone invisible had just been sitting there. On my computer screen, old files began to open on their own—photos from my childhood. Photos I never took. Photos of me sleeping, and in every single one, my brother was standing in the shadows behind me.

​At that moment, the door didn't break; it began to decay. Rapid, impossible rust ate through the metal. Holes formed in the steel, and through one of them, I saw the eye.

​It wasn't human. It was wide, pale, and lacked a pupil—like the eyes of a deep-sea fish that has never seen the sun. It watched me with a cold, predatory intelligence.
​"You’re not my brother," I whispered, raising the shears. "My brother is dead."

​"Dead?" The voice came from the phone, from behind the door, and from inside my own skull simultaneously. "I didn't die, Ethan. I just... changed. And now, the Manager wants to meet the new hire."

​The only lightbulb in the room exploded. In the absolute pitch black, I heard the door finally disintegrate. The water was at my knees now. I felt a long, ice-cold hand—fingers far too thin and far too many—wrap around my ankle. It pulled with a strength that felt like the weight of the ocean, dragging me toward the floor, which no longer felt like concrete, but like thick, suffocating mud.

​The last thing I saw before I was pulled under was the phone screen. The timer read -20:05.
​The year my brother went missing.

​I woke up slumped over my desk. Sunlight was filtering through the small hallway window. I was drenched in sweat, my heart hammering against my ribs. "A dream," I whispered, exhaling a breath I felt like I'd been holding for twenty years. "Just a nightmare."

​I reached for my personal cell phone to call my wife, but my hand froze.
There was one missed call from 2:47 AM.
It was from a number I hadn't seen in two decades—the landline to our old farmhouse, a house that had burned to the ground years ago.

​And resting under my phone was a small patch of wet, green moss and my Zippo lighter... covered in thick, heavy rust, as if it had been sitting at the bottom of a well for a lifetime.
