October 3rd: The day was like any other, I ate, went outside, you get the ordeal. Everything was fine up until my dad arrived from work. He brought some leftover pizza he and his buddies were eating. As i was popping the pizza onto the microwave, I noticed something was up with my dad. He always comes home rather late and pretty drunk to say the least, but today he was completely sober. I took one quick look and could immediately tell something was off. His eyes had massive bags under them and he held a rather worried look. "Hey, what's up?. " I was confused to say the least. Not" a word from dad. for three minutes, nothing but the buzzing of the microwave filled the silence. The noise came back when I grabbed my slices of food and sat down on the table. "Tomorrow..."Dad's words were at the top of his throat, but he couldn't bare speaking. Confused, I asked. "Tomorrow? What's going on tomorrow?" After what felt like aged in silence, dad spoke again, "What ever you do, don't look at an electronic screen tomorrow." Dad's tone changed from frightened to serious. "Why? What's so bad about taking a peep at my phone? Like anything's gonna happen." "They're coming. At 2:30 PM, it'll be over if you don't turn everything off. They'll come for those who fail to follow one simple task, and who knows what they'll do. They can come from any device, your phone, radio, computer, if it's electronic it's coming though it." "What is? You're not making sense. SPEAK RIGHT!" I couldn't help but shout at that moment, nothing he said made sense. After speaking those words, he went back to the same frightened state he was just in. Who are "they" and what'll really happen if I fail to follow dad's instructions?

Wednesday, October 4th: I woke up late today, it was 11:34 AM. I didn't have work today, so I just slumped over on the couch and ate some snacks while watching the television. In what felt like seconds, time had already flew. The time was now 2:03 PM. I hadn't heard anything on the news about what was happening at 2:30, so I shrugged it off. That was my terrible mistake. Dad left for work without saying a word. Before leaving, it seems as if he was crying. I noticed tear marks on his face, his eyes puffy and red. Just thinking about it brought time closer and closer to its end, the time now 2:29PM. In a blink of an eye, everything went quiet. For 10 seconds everything seemed normal, until it all began... A loud scream came from everything in my house. The noise sounding like a cry for help, quickly made me realize my mistake. Running outside, I could hear the sound coming from every direction. Everyone failed to turn off their devices, thus letting our punishment begin. Looking at my television, the screen bulged bigger and bigger. I giant hand, pale and slimy, shout out from the screen. The size of just the hand looked larger than the dining room table. the sirens coming from every direction grew louder and louder, I could feel my eardrums nearing their breaking point. "It wasn't hard to follow one simple task was it now?" The creature, now completely outside the TV stared at me, as if I were it's last meal.
