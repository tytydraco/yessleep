The stairs inside the lodge were crowded with people rushing back and forth, packing their belongings as fast as possible, the trucks lined up outside ready to go. We would evacuate in three convoys; the first made up of most of our vehicles, carrying our supplies and the most vulnerable. It was theorized that these could move fast, and punch through any ‘surprises’ on the road to the ridgeline, before Vecitorak could intercept them. Next were any leftover trucks, tour buses, motorcycles, ATVs, or tractors, along with most of our able-bodied non-fighters. Lastly, astride Bone-faced Whitetail and any horses we had left from the pre-Breach days would come a rearguard of Rangers and Ark River fighters, just in case anything tried to follow us southward. I’d managed to get Lucille and the other children on a bus in the second caravan, but I figured that I’d end up in the rearguard myself. If Vecitorak chose this moment to strike, we would need everyone we could get to keep him away from the children and old people.  
Still, this was distant in my mind as I shoved my way to the third-floor landing, and dashed to a doorway that I knew by heart at this point.  
The doorknob to Chris’s room turned in my hand with a smooth click, and I swallowed, pulse racing from more than just the sprint.  
*Here we go.*  
Not much had changed in the familiar tidy surroundings of Chris’s room. A few boxes sat in the center of the carpeted floor, packed with plastic sandwich bags full of toy soldiers, a dozen books, the disassembled phonograph with a few records, and some miscellaneous personal effects. These I figured would be sent ahead with the supply convoy, while the lone backpack would likely accompany its owner on the rearguard. A light aroma of gun solvent hung on the air, and the balcony doors were open to let the cool night breeze in. There, silhouetted by the dim glow from dying fires outside, Chris stood with his back to me.  
He turned as the door swung shut, and our eyes met. Chris looked even worse than when I’d last seen him, one hand hooked limply in his trouser pocket, the other holding a half-full glass of some amber-colored drink. A decanter sat on the small table nearby, and judging by the fluid level in it, he was on his second round, perhaps third. No effort had been made to clean the filth from his face or clothes, though his gleaming weapons lay near the backpack on the floor, scrubbed of carbon and given a fresh coat of oil. Rangers lived by that code; your weapon always came first. First aid, food, water, all could be dealt with later, but your rifle was your life, and so you tended to it every chance you got.  
Seeming stunned, he opened and closed his mouth a few times, as if Chris couldn’t find any words to say. I could see the guilt and desperation in his eyes, which made the shame in my own chest inflame all the more. I’d done that, unfairly branded him as a liar, kept him in the dark, when Chris had never given me a reason not to trust him. In my vain attempts to be some kind of espionage mastermind, I’d only succeeded in pushing the people who cared for me the most further away.  
*He deserves someone like Jamie; someone strong, brave, smart. I’ve put him through hell, and for what? I’m not even the same person I was when he last saw me.*  
“Before you say anything,” Holding up a hand to keep him silent, I avoided his gaze, my entire body trembling like a leaf. “I need to go first. This will be easier if you just listen.”  
Chris’s face paled, but he nodded in stoic silence, and set his drink down.  
I swallowed hard, and focused on the laces of my boots, ready to vomit on the spot in nervousness. “I talked to Jamie about what happened. She told me about you and her, about everything that happened before I came here. All that said . . . I owe you an apology.”  
Chris folded his arms to cock his head to one side, his expression impassive, a face I’d seen him use when dealing with a problem he hadn’t foreseen. Anguish flared in my heart at seeing him so distant, so guarded, knowing that I’d ruined what had been the very best part of my life.   
*Just like Jamie did.*  
Tears brimmed at the banks of my eyes, and I sniffled hard to keep myself in check. “I should have told you everything, should have trusted you, and I didn’t. Carter never suspected me . . . he was after you. He said that you were the real spy, and offered me a position in his government if I helped bring you in.”  
Chris remained still as a statue, but a small frown crossed his lips, as if my words froze him to the spot.  
“I was scared, and I didn’t know what to do.” Hanging my head, I felt a single hot tear cascade down my left cheek. “If you had been the spy, I couldn’t have watched them shoot you, I couldn’t bear it. Carter gave me that key you saw right before he died, and I didn’t tell you because—”  
“Because you thought he might be right.” With a slight shake of his head, Chris finished my sentence for me, and his eyes hardened into a wounded glare.  
“I was wrong.” I screwed my eyes shut and contemplated running back out the door, the agony of his disappointment too much to bear. “I just wanted to protect you, to find out for myself that way . . . that way if it was you, then maybe I could find a way to handle it without a firing squad. It was stupid, it was dangerous, and I’m sorry.”  
Chris dropped his gaze to the carpet under his feet with a deep sigh, and that sealed it for me.  
*It’s over.*  
Turning, I fumbled for the door, and tried to salvage what was left of my dignity. “If you don’t want to be with me anymore, I-I understand. Once we get to Ark River, I’ll put in for a transfer and stay with Adam’s group. That way you won’t have to—”  
In a flash, Chris lunged at me, his eyes ablaze, and I shrank against the door with a terrified wince.  
I’d earned this, I knew it. A punch, a slap, something was coming that my cruel lack of trust had merited, and even if it would hurt, it could never come close to the way he’d looked at me when I walked in the room. I’d let Chris down, stabbed him in the back, and at this point a part of me didn’t care if he threw me off the balcony, a broken, bloody mess.  
*Maybe I’ll throw myself off and save him the trouble.*  
Two hands gripped me in a hold of iron, but instead of a harsh blow, smoke-scented cotton from a T-shirt smoothed over my face, and I was crushed against his broad muscled chest.  
“I thought I’d lost you.” Chris’s voice cracked with emotion, and deep inside my heart, those words chipped away the last of my resolve.  
Sobbing, I let myself shatter into a million pieces, and buried my face in his soot-stained collar as the pain, fear, and loneliness began to wash away. All the horrible memories of the ELSAR lab, the doubt over my condition, the gloom of my uncertain future vanished with the way he stroked my hair, rubbed my back between both shoulder blades, and rested his scruffy chin beside my ear so that I could feel Chris’s warm breath on my neck. I kept my eyes shut tight, and somehow, the image of that strange man in the yellow chemical suit flashed through my mind, his kind smile, and his silver irises.  
*Whoever you are . . . thank you.*  
“You okay?” Chris whispered, and his hands gently swept over my back, arms, and shoulders in a delicate search for wounds that made my head spin in a delicious, fuzzy wave of tingles.  
I stayed huddled against him, inhaling the heady scent of Chris through his shirt front, and wound my fingers up in the fabric of it. “Mmm hmm.”  
At that, he leaned back, and Chris’s tired countenance floated before mine. He cupped my chin with one hand, ran a thumb over my cheek in a soft caress that lit happy flames under my skin, and I leaned into that touch with a relieved sigh.  
“What happened?” His eyes followed the silver lines of my tattoos, noted the luminous gold of my irises, and lingered on the small streaks of golden blonde in my hair.  
*Not sure you want to know. Not sure I want to tell you, to be honest. Then again, lying never got me anywhere good before.*  
“ELSAR put me through one of their medical labs.” I grimaced at the images in my head of that cursed blue tank, the metal robotic arms chewing into me like steel parasites. “When they cut the infection out, it released some kind of toxin, and . . . changed a few things. Does it bother you?”  
He studied me for a moment, and rested his forehead against mine, Chris’s sky-blue eyes boring into my soul. “It’s still you. You’re safe now. That’s all that matters to me.”  
Drawing a shuddery breath, my heart still in a pitter-patter, I drank in the depth of his gaze, and before I knew what I was doing, my mouth moved in a breathless gasp.  
“I love you.”  
Chris blinked at me, stunned, and I wanted to melt through the floor. Had I really just said that out loud?  
*There were so many better ways for me to do that. I could have waited for a nice date, dinner, dancing, candlelight. This was absolutely the worst possible timing to—*  
All at once, he held me close, and a pair of satin-smooth lips pressed to mine.  
Roaring fire burst to life inside my core, a craving that threatened to overwhelm me with primal need. All my senses, both old and new, flickered to life so that the breath caught in my throat, my heart skipped a few timid beats, and it seemed every atom in my body hummed in sync. Chris’s fingers glided through my hair, his arms held me tight, and his velvety mouth caressed mine in a way that made my insides tense like I would explode. With both eyes closed, I couldn’t even feel my feet on the floor, as if I were floating on clouds. Only when he stopped did I dare to breathe, my head spinning in dizzy warmth.  
*Wow.*  
Chris blushed, one of the few times I’d seen him do that and made a sheepish smile. “I’ve loved you since Maple Lake.”  
*Honk, honk.*  
At the two automotive blasts, I jumped, a car horn echoing from somewhere outside to jolt us back to reality. Fifteen minutes had flown by fast.  
“Talk about timing.” Chris grumbled, planted a few kisses just above my left ear, and broke away to grab his backpack and the cardboard box. “We have to go, *pragtige*. Did you get all your stuff into the trucks yet?”  
Hearing that wonderful name he’d so lovingly gifted me roll off Chris’s tongue made my spirit soar, but the notion of returning to my now empty room, with Jamie’s abandoned posters and belongings still there, soured in my guts.  
“I don’t want to go in there.” I admitted and rubbed my eyes with one hand to stave off the pain over Jamie, her crushed expression rising again in my mind. “I can’t go back to that room by myself, I just can’t.”  
A gentle hand squeezed my arm, and Chris made a sympathetic half-smile. “I’ll go with you. You’ll need your things, and we should bring some of Lansen’s stuff too. Come on, we can make it if we hurry.”  
*Wait . . . that’s all you’re taking?*  
My jaw dropped as I flicked my eyes around at the mass of books, the pewter candlesticks, and the wonderful medieval-styled rug that Chris and his old roommate Darren had scrounged from the ruins of our old world. “What about the books?”  
Chris’s face fell a little, and he looked at the shelves with mournful sadness. “Not enough room. We have to save space for food, or people will starve come winter. I have a few of the classics, so we can make copies by hand, but . . . I guess the library idea will have to wait.”  
I could hear the disappointment in his voice, and the thought of leaving so many stories behind to be incinerated hurt me to my core. How much of our old world, with its warm electric lights, cozy houses, and cheery amusements had been eaten away by the onslaught of this cold new one? These books were one of the last links we had to a time where humans didn’t fear the woods, fields, and rivers; without them, another part of our collective soul would be lost.  
*Maybe we can smuggle more out of the Castle in Black Oak? Assuming they don’t get destroyed either. Of course, will anyone have time to read if our future consists of scratching out a living from whatever comes next?*  
A calloused palm slid into mine and Chris gave it a quick squeeze. “They’re just books, love. They aren’t worth dying for. Come on, let’s get moving.”  
Together, Chris and I made the jog back down to my old room, where we crammed two backpacks full of personal items, one for me, one for Jamie. Neither of us spoke about how futile the second pack might be; Chris seemed to know as well as I that her future was bleak. Still, he carried her weapons and I made sure to grab the picture of her and Bill from Jamie’s desk as we hurried to put Chris’s books, phonograph, and toy soldiers on the overloaded first convoy. At least with this pitiful handful of civilization, we might continue; toys for the children come Christmastime, music, even if old, to remind us of a time before all this, and yellowed pages written by greater men of the past, who dreamed of a world like what we had inherited with grandiose visions of peace, plenty, and hope. How foolish we were, to have thrown it all away over nothing, to have drank deep from the cup of war, greed, and pride. By opening the Pandora’s box of the Breach, our kind had condemned ourselves to repeat the ancient past, to scrape at the earth for our food, huddle in the forests for shelter, and whisper by the campfire of a magical time when light could be summoned by a simple switch. ELSAR might have had a hand in all this, but with the memory of the newspapers from Silo 48 firmly in mind, a part of me knew that we all, as humans, were to blame.  
For the very thing which made us different, special, rulers of the whole world, had been our ultimate downfall; insatiable curiosity at the dark, cosmic unknown.  
I didn’t breathe easier until we trotted through the gates of New Wilderness for the last time, down the hill, and out the perimeter gate. Our animal herds had been driven away by the siege days ago and had the Breach-adapted ones had either been left to survive in the wild or recaptured to be shepherded along by our secondary convoy toward Ark River. Most of our fields had been harvested bare, and with everyone gone from the quiet roads, buildings, and side paths, it made for a somber retreat from the only place I’d ever called home here in Barron County.  
We were a good quarter mile down the road when the first rocket whistled down out of the sky.  
Sitting astride Styx, the mousy-eared Bone-Faced Whitetail I’d ridden when we first made the trek from Ark River back to New Wilderness, I watched in sad awe with the others as fire erupted from the abandoned reserve, buildings blown to bits, more rockets flying in by the dozens. What remained of the fields burst into flame, fences were smashed, the palisade wall obliterated, and plumes of roiling black smoke filled the air like ebony skulls of vapor. I could feel the shudder of the eruptions through the ground beneath Styx’s hooves, and in my chest, the noise deafening even from this far. Birds and other flying things took to the skies from the trees, distant creatures scattered on the plains, and our deer shuffled backward on their hooves in fright. The entire valley lit up like the sun at midday, as the new world witnessed the full might of mankind’s wrath, a grim reminder that even in our dying gasp, humans were still the deadliest member of creation. In my head, I saw again the flashes of vision from the ruins of Collingswood, heard the screams, the sirens, the crying children as thousands perished in the blink of an eye.  
*We’re being exterminated. Vecitorak, Koranti, it doesn’t matter who, they all want us dead. They won’t stop . . . not until every inch of this county is gone.*  
All at once, the barrage fell silent, as if the unseen attackers were satisfied with their work at last.  
“Savages.” Chris breathed from atop his own saddle, angry blue eyes focused on the huge wall of flames that consumed the bones of the New Wilderness Wildlife Reserve.  
Adam reined his stag around, and with Eve riding Lazarus on his right, motioned for us to follow. “A desperate act, from a failing regime. They lost today, and they know it. Soon, we’ll make their headquarters look like that, and grind Black Oak beneath our tires.”  
My eye caught a blur of movement in the distance, silhouetted in the orange-red inferno of our outer fields.  
He strode from the shadows, calm and confident, hooded head swiveling from side to side. Even from so far, my eyes focused to pick up his fetid appearance, his moldy poncho, and decayed boots. I could almost smell his rotten breath, feel his clammy grip on my skin, and the scars under my tattoos wriggled in disgust.  
The figure stopped in the middle of our scorched corn field, and his hooded head turned to stare in my direction.  
*Your world will fall.*  
His cruel, gravelly voice echoed in my mind, as fresh as if he were standing right beside me, and my blood ran cold as ice.  
“Is that . . ?” Chris narrowed his eyes, unable to see as clearly as I could from this far, but slid his hand toward his M4 nonetheless.  
“Vecitorak.” I nodded, and glared back at the distant shadow with every ounce of hatred I could muster. “It seems the snake has finally crawled from his whole. Peter’s shot didn’t kill him after all.”  
Chris’s face contorted into a furious loathing that would have frightened the old me but felt strangely comforting in the wild aura of the firelight. “I might be able to hit him with a scoped rifle. I think Fred might have one up the line. There’s no way he can walk off a .30-06.”  
*I wouldn’t be so sure.*  
Flexing my fingers on the leather reins, I shook my head. “Let him follow.”  
His brow furrowed in confusion, Chris set a hand to his hip. “Why?”  
“If he’s close, we can keep an eye on him.” Not breaking my eyes from Vecitorak, I tried to bore a hole in the air with my eyes, willed him to see me, to know that I had survived his attack out of spite. “Track his movements, and his army. If there’s a wasp in the room, I’d rather let it fly a little while longer, just so that I know where it is.”  
A proud grin crossed Chris’s handsome face, and he made a sneer in the direction of our enemy, a wolfish gleam to his sky-blue irises. “And when we know enough, we can hunt him down on our own terms.”  
*There’s the Head Ranger I know.*  
I smiled back, glad to have him by my side, the feeling almost like a superpower here in this dark place. “Exactly.”  
As we rode off into the dark, I threw one last look over my shoulder, and watched as Vecitorak swept off into the shadows. I knew this was far from over. Our war with ELSAR had just taken a deadly turn, and with a new faction on the rise, we’d have to fight on two separate fronts. My nuclear secret could be the key to getting us out of Barron County, but something told me it wouldn’t be that simple, not with Vecitorak always watching. No, I’d have to deal with him first, and the skin around my belly scar crawled at the idea of getting close to him once more. This mysterious man had found a way to capture the gray-skinned children of the Oak Walker, a lineage that I now shared in along with my new genetic kin from Ark River. We couldn’t leave a challenge like that unanswered.  
*I’m going to hunt you like an animal, you mold-infested demon.*  
I straightened up in my saddle, the trusty Type 9 submachine gun at my hip, all my possessions on my back, like some kind of neo-medieval warlord. If I was to slide out of the realm of modern America, if I was to rejoin the ranks of thousands of ancestors past in the primal, natural world of fire, blood, and bone, then I would do so on my terms. I would fight, tooth and claw, until Barron County was rid of this new curse. That could mean living in furs, hides, and riding deer like horses for the rest of my life, but so be it. This new world, with all its bizarre dangers, was our home, our kingdom, ripe for whoever had the strength to claim it. I couldn’t let it fall to darkness and Chaos. I wouldn’t, even if the effort cost me my life.  
*I’m going to find you, Vecitorak, and when I do . . . I’ll kill you.*
