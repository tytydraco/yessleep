Journal Entry #1 - May 1st

I don't know how I ended up here. I was hiking in the woods and suddenly found myself lost. I've been wandering for hours, but I can't seem to find my way back to the trail. The sun is starting to set, and I'm getting scared. I keep hearing strange noises, like something is following me. I need to find shelter for the night.

Journal Entry #2 - May 2nd

Last night was a nightmare. I found a small cave to sleep in, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching me. I heard growling and scratching outside the cave, but I was too scared to look. I barely slept at all. This morning, I found claw marks on the rocks outside the cave. I don't know what kind of animal could have made them.

Journal Entry #3 - May 3rd

I think I'm being hunted. Every time I stop to rest, I hear the same growling and scratching. I've seen glimpses of something moving in the shadows, but I can't get a good look at it. Whatever it is, it's fast and incredibly strong. I'm starting to fear for my life.

Journal Entry #4 - May 4th

I saw it today. It was a creature unlike anything I've ever seen before. It was big, with dark fur and glowing eyes. It moved silently through the woods, stalking me like prey. I don't know how I managed to escape, but I ran until I collapsed. I can still hear it out there, searching for me.

Journal Entry #5 - May 5th

I've been running for days now. I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. The creature is relentless, always one step behind me. I'm exhausted and hungry, and I can feel my will to survive slipping away. But I have to keep going. I have to find a way out of these woods.

Journal Entry #6 - May 6th

I found a map in my backpack. I don't know how I missed it before. It shows a river not too far from where I am now. If I can follow that, I might be able to find my way out of the woods. But I have to be careful. The creature is still out there, waiting for me.

Journal Entry #7 - May 7th

I made it to the river. It wasn't easy, but I managed to lose the creature along the way. I'm still scared, but I feel like I might have a chance now. I'm going to follow the river until I find help. I don't know what I'll do if the creature finds me again, but I can't give up. I have to keep fighting. Journal Entry #8 - May 8th

I walked along the river all day yesterday. I'm tired and my feet hurt, but I'm making progress. I haven't seen the creature since I left the woods, but I can't let my guard down. I need to find help soon. I'm starting to run low on food and water.

Journal Entry #9 - May 9th

I came across a small campsite today. There was no one there, but there were some supplies left behind. I took what I needed and left a note in case the owners come back. It's a relief to have some extra food and water. I'm going to keep following the river and hope that I come across someone soon.

Journal Entry #10 - May 10th

I saw a helicopter flying overhead today. I tried to signal for help, but I don't think they saw me. I'm going to keep moving and hope that they come back. I feel like I'm getting closer to civilization. The river is getting wider and there are signs of human activity along the banks.

Journal Entry #11 - May 11th

I made it to a small town today. I don't know where I am exactly, but it's a relief to be around people again. I went to a diner and had a hot meal. It was the best thing I've tasted in days. I'm going to try to find a phone so I can call for help. I don't want to be lost in the woods again.

Journal Entry #12 - May 12th

Something is wrong with this town everywhere I turn I'm being watched by the people who seem to lack any kind of emotion. If I turn fast enough I see the creature next to them.

 Journal Entry #13 - May 13th

I don't know what's happening in this town, but I know I need to get out of here. Everywhere I go, I feel like I'm being watched. The people are strange and emotionless, and I keep seeing glimpses of the creature. I managed to find a phone and tried to call for help, but no one answered. I'm starting to feel like I'm in some kind of nightmare.

Journal Entry #14 - May 14th

I tried to leave the town today, but I couldn't find my way out. Every road I took led back to the same place. I think I'm trapped here. I don't know what to do. I'm starting to feel like I'm losing my mind.

Journal Entry #15 - May 15th

I woke up in a strange room today. I don't know how I got here or who brought me here. The walls are covered in strange symbols and there's a strange smell in the air. I can hear strange noises outside the door. I think I'm in danger. I need to find a way out. I heard a phone ringing on the wall i picked it up and heard a gravely voice say. It sounds like you are experiencing a very difficult and scary situation. If you are truly in danger, it's important that you try to find help or a way to escape as soon as possible. If you have access to a form of communication, you could try calling for help or alerting someone you trust about your situation. 

If you are unable to leave the room or make contact with others, it may be helpful to try to stay calm and focus on your breathing.

Remember that you are not alone  If you are able to reach out to someone for help, do not hesitate to do so. 

Then the phone went silent I'm not sure what to do. 
 
Journal Entry #16 - May 16th

I managed to find a way out of the room. It was a trapdoor under the bed. I'm not sure where it leads, but I had no other choice. I crawled through it and found myself in a dark tunnel. I can hear the creature's footsteps echoing through the tunnel. I'm scared, but I have to keep moving. I don't know what's going to happen next, but I have to keep fighting for my survival.

Journal Entry #17 - May 27th I made it after 11 days I made it out of the building and the creature is no longer chasing me. I don't know how I managed to survive, but I did. I stumbled upon a road and managed to flag down a passing car. and dragged him out of the car. I was frozen with fear, but I knew I had to keep moving. I managed to jump out of the car and run as fast as I could. I could hear the creature's growls behind me, but I didn't look back. 

I kept running until I reached a small town. I collapsed in front of a convenience store and was taken to a hospital. I suffered from hallucinations, dehydration, exhaustion, and minor injuries. The doctors and nurses took care of me and I was eventually released from the hospital.
To this day I don't know if what I went through was real but I do know that when I get to close to the woods I feel eyes on me.
