My invitation to the High Priestess’ sorcerous soiree was rather unexpected, given my anonymity amongst the local undivine community. Had I known beforehand that I’d be invited, I would’ve conducted myself to some far-flung, physically unnavigable realm, wholly relieved from this sphere of mortal existence. But the invitation was received, and thus I was bound to attend—lest my soul be unfastened from my body and thrown heavenward to disintegrate amidst the celestial tumult of the stars. Such are the ways of The Coven.  One cannot deny their whims, no more than one can deny the time-stalling coming of **The Black Horologist.**  

Putting on my best azure robes and selecting my least-used staff, I prepared myself for the party; telling myself—as I brushed the skeletal dust from the fabric and polished the staff-embedded gem—that I’d actually talk to someone this time. My usual behavior at social functions had rarely amounted to much more than standing in a corner muttering anti-social, proximity-buffering incantations to myself. Going alone was the hardest part, not because I wish I had someone with whom to attend the party, but because I’d be *that guy;* and people rarely want to talk to that guy, especially not cute sorceresses or lithe lamia. 

As ready as I could ever be, I drew upon my marmoreal floor a seal of physical transposition, taking careful note of the coven’s ever-roaming domain in my divining orb, lest I accidentally transport myself into a tree, or a cliffside. With the mundane and metaphysical coordinates locked in, I stood in the center of the immaculately drawn sigil with my belongings, and uttered the Atlantean spell that would transport my body and mind across the vast distance. 

One second, I was in my dusty, book-clogged atelier, and the next I was standing in the ruins of an ancient, time-forgotten city in some titanically overgrown forest. Moonlit and ethereal, the derelict metropolis gleamed eerily, and a faint, blue-tinted mist hovered above the dust-capped rubble. Small fires burned intermittently, some having been intentionally placed by the hosts of the party for guidance or subterfuge, others the inexhaustible flames of inter-cosmic serpent-things, who’d come from galaxies unreachably remote in the early years of the primordial earth to lay waste to a sub-race of mankind. Having little use for molten flesh, I avoided these latter fires, though strode confidently and harmlessly through the former.  

Phantoms and specters of long-dead wizards and witches arose around me as I trekked through the cyclopean desolation, calling out promises of power incontestable, or pleading for relief from their irremediable revenancy. I ignored all calls, knowing that in helping them I’d only be damning myself—one way or another. Other things, things that had never been human and would only be so through acts of possession, also whispered or shrieked at me from the deep corners of the murk; and these I ignored as well; knowing –as any warlock should – what eldritch fates could befall those who’re lured by such innominate spirits.  

All in all, it was standard fair for the occasion. Those who could not resist the calls of the damned and undead rarely made good party guests. The mentally malleable are often poor workers of magic, lacking the skills for any entertaining displays of sorcery. And everyone, from novitiate to incomparably erudite mage is expected to perform at the coven’s parties. Those lost to the lures of seductive shadow and sylvan devilry would not be missed.  

Finally, i made it to the site of the party: a bowl-shaped courtyard of yester-age, suspended upon the open air a few meters from a dead-end in the main road of that half-buried city.  In the early cycles of human civilization, this courtyard had served as a site of congress and discussion amidst the forgotten people’s most learned citizens. But it was now nothing more than another place at which my ilk would engage in revelry and ribaldry.  

The courtyard, being incredibly spacious and subtly dipped, held a great multitude of people—and other beings who dealt in diablerie and witchcraft. There were even a few clerics and saints, no doubt acting as self-imposed magical wardens, in the event that someone was to conjure or invoke something a little too.... *magically radical.*  

There were also maddeningly curvaceous incubi and lamia, and it was upon these that I set my sight and heart, for I had long since abandoned any hope of relating with women of my own species. Human women can have hearts crueler and blacker than any demoness; glares more chilling than any boreal witch. They are relentlessly mocking of—and derisive towards—anyone with a propensity for the darker sciences, for spheres of knowledge unconcerned with the atom and the cell. The very arts I had spent my collegiate days learning.  

In an attempt to seem both casual and mysterious, I put on the face of one who had long ago mastered the lost arcana of pre-human warlocks, and positioned myself near an obelisk of obsidian, upon which were inscribed various sigils denoting certain events within the party. Here, I figured, I’d encounter a decent amount of traffic; hoping that at least a few of the visitors would be buxom, wide-hipped, and blackly souled – the aforementioned lamia and gorgons. I told myself that I’d even settle for a harpy, should one come swooping in my direction.  

But as the night went on and the black-flamed pyres grew taller, filling the air with sepulchral fumigants and the ghoul-calming odors of the tomb, I realized that no one was bothering to visit the informative slab; that everyone had already been informed of the night’s proceedings through the various scrolls and apparitions that had been their invitations. Yet again, I was the odd sorcerer in the veritable corner: friendless and alone, twiddling his ringed fingers.  

Overhead, the stars danced wildly and intermittently flared in the black gulf, having been reigned by some ostentatiously dressed magician’s ultramundane sorcery. He’d also undoubtedly cast an enchantment upon the Earth's atmosphere itself, so that the stars would appear in their natural arrangement and luminosity to anyone outside the coven’s floating domain.  

It was flashy, yet magically unimpressive; many a wizard has at some point in his career performed similar feats for the amusement of others – oftentimes children. Still, the attendees seemed enthralled by the cosmic mediocrity, several of the desired demonesses included. Jealous, and openly sour-faced, I left my station at the obelisk and ventured to the bar, where a sanguine-skinned enchantress was serving the acclaimed brews of her coven.  

Here, I quickly lost track of time as I copiously imbibed flagon after flask of blood-spiced wines, of dragon spit shots, and even some allegedly salubrious admixtures of griffin and Pegasus bile. Doubly intoxicated, my mind was quickly and foolishly turned toward the idea of performing some great magical feat of my own, in order to attract the attention—and, ultimately, the men-slaying kisses and caresses—of those serpent-allied women. 

 Looking around for ideas, I spotted a tarp of greyed giant’s flesh stretched over a broad oaken table, upon which were being sold the polished, begemmed, and gilded skulls of various creatures: some recognizably terrestrial, others the captured and slain fauna of wild planets beyond man's ken. Having just recently mastered the entirety of a spell-tome on Necromancy and Zombology, I figured it would be quite impressive to resurrect from ash and dust the full forms of those cheaply decorated beasts, using only their present vestiges as a basis from which to draw the rest of their anatomy.  

Taking one final shot of a wyrm's amber-coated salivary gland, I strode boldly toward the portly, triply horned merchant; and with funds saved from countless jobs delivering food I bought his entire stock and bid him to depart with his signage.  

I swept away all decorations and embellishments save for the skulls themselves, lest any partiers mistakenly approach me as the stall’s new manager. Next, I cast a simple spell of cleansing, to rid the goods of any diseases or maledictions which might be present. The vendors of such artifacts are rarely concerned with sanitation, given the ephemerality of their merchandise. Finally, I dipped my fingers in a bowl of water which the stall’s former owner had set aside for himself to drink; and traced, wetly, the necromantic sigils of my personal design upon the foreskulls of those yet-to-be-imagined beasts.  

Uttering the olden incantations of reanimation, scripted first by primordial warlocks and later refined by scholars of collegiate sorcery, I brought back—one by dreadful one—those furried, scaled, and nearly amorphous horrors.  

Monstrously they rose, snarling, hissing, and sputtering even as they came to form; and the table, under the sudden burden of their still-increasing weight, collapsed onto the stone floor. The commotion brought the attention of a few revelers, who in their wine-addled states mistook the scene as some simple party trick; rather than a dark thaumaturgy. When the first beast had completed its sorcerous reinvention, rising upon its massive hind legs like some maniacal fantasist’s idea of a Lycan, a crowd was present; dimly marveling at the increasingly unsafe scene.  

The other horrors, comparably atrocious though bearing little or no resemblance to the malformed wolf-thing, came to stand, crouch, or unsteadily wobble at its side. I muttered a command of placidity, all the while knowing that though I may have brought them to life, they would not—and would never—obey me as their master. My enchanting words fell upon willfully deaf or physiologically unhearing ears. The pack of horrors, as varied in their abhorrence as they were deadly in form, crept toward the crowd; who, ignorantly, crept forward in drunken awe.  

Their mesmerized stupor was wholly broken when a ghouless was lifted and slammed – brutally, callously – to the ground by the ultra-bestial lycanthrope. Her funeral screams of shock and agony were terribly sobering; all in immediate attendance shrank away in terror. Luckily, having just come into existence, the beast’s movements were sluggish, its coordination not yet honed. The woman was dragged away, leaking adipocere and shrieking incoherently, before any further harm could befall her.  

Just when I feared things would end in total failure, and that my bastard creations would not only ruin the party but bring about the end of its guests, a prodigious thing happened. From behind the terror-frenzied crowd came a thunderous sound, as of two great boulders colliding. Many in the crowd fell in the quake of this new marvel, and I finally saw what had caused the noise. The magician, who had earlier dazzled the partiers with his middling astromancy, was in the process of putting together some massive, geologically composed golem. Rock and stone hovered sorcerously, colliding with one another seemingly of their own volition. Soon, a being took form, an entity born of the stones of the courtyard; its composite materials quarried from the floating platform itself.  

More of a bipedal obelisk than anthropomorphic simulacrum, the thing towered at least fifteen feet above the tallest of guests, with a broadness and stoutness of body that rivaled the most formidable Titans of yore. Its creator, satisfied with the rudimentary image, beckoned it forward; and unlike my drooling, mindless reanimations, it obeyed the commands given to it.  

With earth-cratering footfalls, it lumbered on, singly driven toward one obvious goal: the extermination of what I'd wrought. Men, lamia, and jesters alike fled before the colossus; while their favors, drinks, and personal belongings were trodden underfoot.  

Not wanting to be associated with the beasts—who bore no familiarity with me, anyhow—I fled toward the bar, which I figured would be the most defensible area of the party. The creatures, primally sensing the threat of the approach golem, hissed and howled vehemently; and the boldest of the assemblage pounced at once.  

Like some back-alley boxer, the colossus threw wide though devastating punches, reducing the creatures to clouds of crimson mist in mid-air. Having not yet developed the necessary intelligence or intuition for self-preservation, the other creatures sprang forward to follow the fates of the vanguard, with sharply poised claws and undulant tentacles. They too were effortlessly stricken down, splattered against pillars, floor, and brazier like anointing oil.  

The fight—if you could call that one-sided slaughter such a thing—ended with the collapse of the Lycan-thing's skull beneath the golem’s boulder of a heel. Waves of relief and elation swept through the party, and applause—of which I was shamelessly a part— erupted in celebration of the magician who’d saved us. And even better, it seemed that no one attributed the bestial nightmares to me. In their drunkenness they must’ve thought the things to have been born of some errant, master-less force of maleficent magic.  

All seemed well, until the titanic rock-form turned and, with no prompting from its master, slammed an unsuspecting Atlantean into the ground. There was no scream, he hadn’t the time to. His body was instantly pulverized, reduced to frothing green pulp atop the flagstones. Black ichor pooled into the cracks, streaming over the feet of people nearby. Silence befell the congregation, and then a rapturous tumult of multilingual terror broke it.  

With the same brutal efficiency it had demonstrated against my beasts, the golem began demolishing the partiers. The more sober of them pleaded with the magician to control or dismantle his creation, but despite various hastily incanted malenchantments and utterances, the magician could not stall or unmake his murdering creation.  

Through this latest hysteria I tracked the golem’s cumbersome approach toward a group of women, a group which included the achingly beautiful lamia I’d seen earlier in the party. My feelings swelled, seeing her so pitiably helpless, and I knew that regardless of my own fate, I had to stop this new nightmare from reaching her.  

Surveying the scene, I realized that I wouldn’t be able to cross the great courtyard in time, and that in any case the still-fleeing partiers would only impede my progress. We were hemmed in by nothingness, closed off from escape by a sheer fall from the platform’s precipitous edge.  

Desperation bred a moment of clarity, and the subsequent revelation did not send me cowering back behind the bar, praying for some Providential intervention. Instead, I was granted the peace of mind necessary to perform the grave, self-sacrificing task.  

First, I cast a simple—though incredibly arcane—spell of fortification. Using my own life-force, I projected a magical armor onto all in attendance, which would for a few moments’ time render them completely invulnerable to magical damage. It would not save them from the crushing blows of the megalithic colossus, as it was a physical construct – despite its magical origins.  

A side-effect of this enchantment is that those protected by it are also rendered immobile, which must’ve been a supremely unsettling sensation, given that many were only a few paces away from their golemesque pursuer. But before it could pummel those nearest to it, I performed the second feat of my plan: raising my left hand to the dark, star-scattered sky, I spoke the word, “Bolide”, and made the accompanying gesture of incendiary spellcraft. My hand was at once set aflame, the rings thereon melting and fusing to the bones of my fingers; but I held the gesture and used the blazing appendage to guide my sidereal conjuration through the heavens.  

Perhaps thinking themselves the unluckiest partygoers in the world, the men and women’s screams mounted and then transformed to insensate babbling as they watched one of the stars gain a sudden trajectory toward Earth. Meteorically, the star plummeted landward, trailing stellar plumes in its wake. Only the golem, not graced with a neck, failed to heed the descending celestial object.  

Finally, I used my undamaged hand to grant myself the same protection I’d granted to the others. As I was shielded by the magic, so too was I frozen by it. Just when the golem was about to smash to bits the fair group of gorgons and demonesses, the star struck the courtyard.  

I cannot accurately describe the experience, the annihilating stellar violence. It was as if for a brief, blinding moment I stood on the surface of the sun, immersed in its ultra-radiant splendor. There was no heat, no pain, only light and force and cosmic brilliance.  

When my regular vision was returned to me, I saw only the blasted surface of the courtyard and the petrified guests. Everything inorganic that had been on the subtly bowled surface was gone. I’d known from the beginning of my plan that the integrity of the platform itself would not be compromised. The High Priestess’ magic was much stronger than my own, and she'd endowed the site with a plentiful supply of it in anticipation of most magical potentialities.  

My magic subsided a moment later, and we were all relieved of our immobility. My hand –charred to the bone – cooled as rapidly as the flames that once coated it had grown, leaving a cold black claw. I would’ve probably found someplace to rest, then; but a Satyr, cloaked in the garb of some unfamiliar occult order, helped me to my feet and bore me forward. In the bleating tones of its kind, it announced that I was the one who saved us—that my miraculous spellcasting had destroyed the foolish magician’s rampaging construct.  

The crowd applauded again, only with much greater fervor this time. With my unburnt hand I waved in acceptance of their gratitude. The inhuman women for whom I had pined came over and helped the satyr carry me to a slab of rock – the only elevated spot of the star-blasted site. Here I was gifted with the magical ephemerae of conjurers and arcanists. And while these were accepted with much appreciation and humility, it was the kiss of a particular lamia that sent my heart fluttering, and my mind reeling with joy.  

What a night.
