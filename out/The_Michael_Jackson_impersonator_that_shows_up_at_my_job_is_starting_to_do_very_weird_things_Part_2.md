If you guys saw my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/cPN0McdvYB) you know this guy is weird. 

I’ve seen MJ a few times since then. Nothing major—just him peeking into the box office window. He usually walks off the second he notices it’s me in there. It’s like catching a kid snooping through their parents room. Guilty, but smug about it.

I try not to think about what he said to me that day.
I try not to think about what I saw on the camera footage. 

I try.

But I still do.

Who is he?
What is he?

I saw him again a little while ago. That’s why I grabbed my tablet. I’m usually watching TV on it during slow shifts.

Today I guess I’m playing novelist.

I typically wear a three piece suit when I work box office. I don’t need to—the dress code’s just formal or all black—but I think I look damn good in one. 

This morning, on my walk in, a kid stopped me on the street and asked if I was dressed like Michael Jackson.
Kind of killed the vibe.

I was going for Victorian vampire.

But I’ve got long black hair and a slim frame, so I get comments like that a lot.

It bothers me now.

I’ve been extra strict about keeping my sunglasses on at work. I get weird when people look at my eyes.
They don’t feel right.

I hear his voice sometimes—especially when I’m trying to sleep.

*“What’s wrong with your eyes?”*

I look in the mirror, and one eye seems too small. The other too wide. Not in a “nobody’s symmetrical” kind of way. Worse. Off enough that I don’t want to check again.

Even blinking feels uneven. Like my lids don’t know what shape they’re supposed to be.

The box office window reflects me perfectly once the sun goes down.
I try not to look anymore.

I have to remind myself that I’m still on the clock and I have my job to do. I handle the money I need to stay focused. If the numbers are off then my boss is going to grill me. 

I’d hate to have to admit that I’m having trouble focusing because a Michael Jackson impersonator said my eyes look weird.

Also, no one mentioned the footage to management. MJ at the back door? A glitch.

We get weirdos all the time. Homeless guys. Drunk tourists.
Even if we showed it to my boss, he’d shrug. What would we say? “Hey, the cameras froze while this guy tried to get in—but we swear it’s spooky.”

Nah.
What would really happen is I’d get clowned on.

It’s bad enough I told a couple of my coworkers. One guy—let’s call him Dave—found it hilarious.

He’s been sneaking behind the box office and screaming “HEE-HEE!” at random times during my shift. Just to mess with me.

He doesn’t know what it does to me.
Sometimes I can hear it even when he’s not there.

I picture his mouth inches from the glass—just wide enough to let something inhuman out. A melodic howl.

It seeps through the glass and rings throughout the box.
It’s in my head.

…

My shift’s almost over. The only time I saw MJ tonight was a quick peek through the window.

Just a second.

Why is that enough to rattle me?
Why is that enough for me to start *hearing things?*

I needed to finish the count before I could close up, but the numbers were off. Not by a little—by a lot. 
Cash was perfect. It usually is. But the digital payments? There was an extra zero at the end.

We don’t pull that kind of money on a random Saturday in June.
Hell, we’d barely hit that on Halloween.

I headed upstairs to grab someone to double-check. Halfway up the stairwell, I heard it.

“WHOOOO!”

I flinched so hard my knee smashed into the wall. It hurt. Furious, I rounded the corner.

Nobody.

I grabbed the intercom.
“Dude. The joke’s dead. Cut that shit out.”

Just static.

“I’m serious, man. Not tonight.”

And then I heard it. Faint at first. A low hum.

*”Dun dun dun dun-dun…”*
He was humming “Bad.”

Though I’d hate to admit it, that was enough to give me chills. I was about to mute the intercom, head back down, maybe ice my knee—but the humming shifted.

It got rougher. Wet. Less melody, more growl. Then he spoke.

*”First your eyes, then your legs—WHOOO! Then I’ll leave your ass for dead!”•

It was his voice.
MJ’s voice.
Unmistakable.

How the hell did this jackass get into our intercom system?

Was Dave in on it?
I had to confront him.

I left the box office and stomped down the hall, MJ’s half-sung threat still echoing behind me.

When I reached the actors’ hallway, Dave was lying on the floor, scrolling on his phone.
I kicked his leg.

“Asshat. Cut the shit. How’d that guy get into the intercom? Where the fuck is he?”

Dave looked at me like I’d asked him to perform brain surgery on a strobe light.

“Bro… are you good? I’ve been chillin’ here waiting for you to close down there.”

I actually gave up trying to close after that.
Dumped the responsibility on Dave and walked out.

Now I’m sitting in my car, parked under a dead streetlight, trying to build the courage to drive home.

I turned the key once a little bit ago.
The radio snapped on—full volume.

*“You are not alone…”* started playing.

It was already set to that station. I don’t remember it being set to that station.
It’s probably a coincidence.

But it doesn’t feel like one.

I haven’t checked the backseat yet.
I can’t.

Not until I start driving.
Not until I’m moving.

I’ll post again when I see him.
If I see him.
