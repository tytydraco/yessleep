when i was five i had a traumatic experience that has led me to never eat candy nor like Easter ever since.

&#x200B;

i woke up and i looked over at my little digital clock sitting on my bedside table, i rubbed my eyes so i could see and i read "2:66" weird, me being five and homeschooled my parents taught me how time owrke and how to read it and they had told me in an hour there was no time past 59. 

&#x200B;

So naturally, i was confused. But i got up anyways only because i was really thirsty, i picked my little body out of bed and stepped out of my room, but before i did i grabbed my special stuffed animal rabbit i named Candy, i held sweet ol' candy by the arm and dragged him out my room, i turned to the staircase and started carefully going down.

&#x200B;

i got to the kitchen as i got off the stairs, i climbed my little body up to where i could get to the cabinets then i grabbed my pink disney princess cup i sat Candy on the counter below the cabinets and left him there as i climbed down and climbed up the kitchen island which had the sink on it.

&#x200B;

i turned on the sink and filled my pink cup. once it was full i climbed down and went back up the stairs to my room, i layed down one i got in my room, soon after i layed down i immediately felt something was wrong... i didnt have candy! i forgot him, i sat my cup down and left my room to the kitchen.

at the top of the staircase getting ready to go down, i stopped.. i heard something,, chewing.. "hello?'' my little voice called out, "hello.." a vast deep voice said. "who are you?" i let go of my voice. "the easter bunny" the voice replied. "what are you eating?" i said all giggly. "your candy." the ugly raspy deep voice said. "what?! silly, ur supposed to give me my easter basket with my candy in it not eat my candy in it!!" my sweet unknowingly little voice said.

&#x200B;

i slowly walked down the stairs slowly still hearing the chewing, i got to the bottom of the steps, when i was at the bottom of the steps i looked over at the kitchen island seeing rabbit feet, only that tho so short, i looked up and sure enough there was a bunny, he looked over at me and he stopped eating, sure enough he was actually eating the treat candy, he smiled but his smile was inhuman, no friendly thing it had big sharp teeth and i saw the bunnys red eyes once my eyes adjusted, my big smile faded.

&#x200B;

the thing reached up to its head, with its claws it dug into its own scalp, blood started dripping and my eyes widened, i stood still in shock, it ripped its skin in half and continued down its body doing all this while smiling. blood gushed everywheres even on me, i ran to the cabinets i left my old bunny on and reached for him i grabbed him and held him as the blood continued gushing, the thing finished ripping its skin off and all its blood was already everywheres, even some on me once all the thing was just bones and its torn skin was on the ground i let out a big scream and ran to my room my stuffy in arms, i looked at my cup of water and all the princesses faces on it was distorted and then i looked at the old digital clock that i had had since i was born and i read, 6:66 i again thought weird becuase 1. thts not a real time and 2. it hadnt been that long.. i held my bunny tight and laid in my bed and threw the civers over me.

&#x200B;

 the next morning i woke up and looked at my rabbit stuffy, its eyes where suddenly red and its closed sewed on mouth was now open, i threw it off my bed in fear and i looked at the time, 10;44, finally a real time "lana come on breakfast!!" i heard my mom call knowing my sister was probably already down there, i picked up my little body and grabbed my rabbit stuff but i held it far away from me in fear, i looked at my pink disney princess cup and the princess faces where still twisted and torn i got down stairs and begged my mom to throw out my rabbit stuffy, after asking 20 times and getting alot of "but you love ur stuffy" "but," "why?" she fianally took it out to the dumpster and i sat down with my sister, i looked over at the living room, at the wall on the wall written in blood was "Cya next easter" obviously no one else saw this writing... 

&#x200B;

this morning i woke up and saw in writing on the wall in what i assume is blood "CYA SOOON" I ran to my sisters room since i live with her and i have been with her ever since i saw that, im writing this on my computer while shes in the grocery store and im not looking forward to easter, nothing has happened since the incident on the easter when i was 5 but i havent seen that writing in that time period either, im writing this in my probably last months alive, i easter is unfortunate.
