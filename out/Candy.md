I was sitting at the counter, finishing my cup of coffee when she came in. My face still stung from where Marjorie had smacked me when I looked up at six feet of goddess, long curly white blonde hair curling down to a thick black belt cinched around her small waist and long legs covered in black fishnet stockings. She must have been freezing from the cold, having too much cleavage to button up the matching jacket.

The mouthful of coffee was bitter and cool in my mouth, not at all unlike my wife’s kiss before I left. There was something gross and undignified about people our age tongue-kissing still, but unbrushed teeth or no, she insisted. The beauty just inside the door looked around the diner until she saw me staring. Her walk was awkward as she drew close in high heels, looking like her ankles would snap with each step, but something within her stride said she knew exactly what that body was built for.

She pressed up against me, her full red lips opening and I found myself leaning in even before she spoke. Her peppermint breath was hot.

“What’s your name?” she asked. I told her. Her voice was pipsqueak high, but I didn’t care as she placed a surprisingly warm hand over mine. “You got someplace to be?” Her fingers were easily longer than mine even without the long red fingernails.

“No,” I lied. The office was just up the block but I had already begun plotting the eventual sick call. I didn’t see myself making it back home to Marjorie, either and was ready to ‘work late’ if necessary.

“I’m real horny.” She pressed her bosom against the shoulder of my suit jacket, batting her giant baby blue eyes at me. I could have sworn I felt her body heat through both of our clothes as lower parts of my brain began thickening my thoughts.

The idea of cheating is one thing. But when confronted with the actual prospect of it, it has a paralyzing effect of sorts. My head felt gigantic and warm, my darting eyes racing around to spot someone who wasn’t there. I was afraid to move—the wrong motion would reject her, the right one would be an indictment of what was going through my mind.

She smelled sweet. Strawberries and something unfamiliar, but I wanted to lean over and lick her bare flesh. I pulled back, blinking away the euphoric sensation washing over me, swallowing the excess saliva in my mouth.

“What’s your name, honey?” I asked. I never called women honey, but then again, I’d never intended to do what I was intending to do to someone not my wife.

“Candy,” she said, lowering that high-pitched voice.

“How much?” I kept my voice low. I’d never been to a pro, but I didn’t care. I just didn’t want everyone knowing about it. A woman like this was a winning lottery ticket fallen into my hands—worth sacrificing petty things like morals and money.

She shook her head in a way that was incredibly hot, yet innocent.

“I just need it.”

“It?” I asked, my will waning.

“It.” With her other hand rubbing my back, her palm left the back of my hand and grabbed me beneath the counter. It.

I got that paralyzed feeling again. Tears came to my eyes. It had been years since Marjorie had done anything close to that. I was still blinking them away when Lenny, chef and sole proprietor, came to the counter.

“Can I get yez somethin’?” I put thumb and middle finger across my closed eyes to wipe away the moisture and looked up at him. His white apron, already with brown stains of different shades, stretched across his powerful frame. The naked lust on his face made me possessive. He had just lost his wife last year and before just this minute seemed the type to remain faithful even in death. He was a Golden Gloves champ in his twenties, half a foot taller and outweighed me with at least thirty pounds of muscle, but if it weren’t for the fact Lenny was at least twenty years older than me I would have snatched that pot of decaf from him and smashed it over his head. Candy was mine.

“Cocoa.” She looked over at him and something passed between them that told Lenny to back off. His big shoulders slumped like the air had been let out of those huge muscles and he shuffled over to the little machine that made a variety of hot chocolates, espressos and lattes. He dragged out a little cup that almost seemed too heavy to lift, hefted it underneath the little spigot and managed to press the button.

The little machine began to rumble and Candy turned to the pie tray. She took the liberty of lifting the heavy glass lid and helping herself to two wedges of apple pie. I’d seen Lenny practically bend a guy’s fingers back to his wrist for doing the same thing, but when he came back with the cocoa he only looked from her to me with long, puppy dog eyes as she wolfed the pie down.

“Uh, put it on my tab,” I said. “I’ll pay.”

She slurped down the cocoa with as much abandon and slammed the cup down on the counter. Another no-no, but Lenny flinched like she took a swing at him.

Candy grabbed me by the chin, almost lifting me up by my face as she bent to kiss me. Her tongue smacked around inside my mouth, a hot, slick sponge pounding off the insides of my cheeks and grating against my tongue. When she pulled away, despite what she’d just eaten, her aftertaste was cherry.

“Come on,” she said.

I was out of breath from the kiss, but I would catch it later, fumbling out my wallet and yanking out the first bill my rubbery fingers could latch onto. I slid it over to Lenny. As we left Candy grabbed a handful of the nasty black licorice mints no one had touched in the years they’d spent next to the register.

As many times as I’d been to Lenny’s place I’d either never noticed or blurred out the memory of the motel right next door. Until now I’d been pretty faithful to Marjorie to a fault and until now motels had been for *those* people, not guys like me. But thoughts of my wife receded as she dragged the back of my hand across her soft cleavage. My back stiffened, but the idea of what I was doing didn’t have the same paralyzing effect.

The heat of her body reminded me how cold I was. My coat and hat were still back at Lenny’s.

Inside the unnamed motel was a small respite from the cold. But even with the warmth seeping into me it was almost as bad as the freezing temperature; the cheap hand soap and bleach someone had only enhanced the smell of vomit and death. For the first time I noticed Candy’s lipstick was smeared on to make her lips look fuller than they were. Her face was paler than her neck, and looking now, if her hair were pulled back and she turned at the right angle she could be mistaken for a man.

I say mistaken because despite her big frame Candy’s shape was all woman. We moved from beneath a yellowed overhead light and the beauty washed back into her features. She drew me in for another one of those sugary kisses and I took a deep breath, sucking in her sweet scent before her tongue flopped around in my mouth.

She was strong, almost crushing me into her as she hugged me while we fumbled to the end of the hall. Candy kicked off her heels when we got to the stairwell, pushing me up the stairs ahead of her and suddenly where she had been playfully clumsy in her stride, now she was like a big cat, nudging at her lamed prey.

I tumbled through the door to the second floor when she all but threw me through it. I got up but she was right on top of me again, kissing, groping, grinding. As lusty as I was, part of me was beginning to worry. My shins ached from banging on the corners of the steps. She was young, a good fifteen years my junior and obviously athletic. What if she did worse to me in bed than she was doing now? What if she was into some kind of S-and-M kink or her boyfriend was hiding in the closet?

Her hand looked like it had claws, but then I did a double-take and saw she was clenching a set of keys. Candy’s large eyes dancing around reeked of desperation but I was past the point of no return. I’d risk the closeted boyfriend and brave the bondage for the possibility to compete in her bedroom marathon. Despite my common sense I couldn’t turn back.

She pressed me against her door, her chest squeezing air from my lungs I couldn’t spare, ramming her hips into me as she fished the key into the lock. I was woozy from all the kissing; stars flickered behind my eyes as the door opened. We crossed the threshold of her room, our arms around each other, our hands racing over one another.

Candy raked her nails across the back of my suit jacket then she stiff-armed me, sending me hurtling backwards. I fell onto the bed and popped back up in time for her to pin my crotch to the mattress with her knee. I grunted as she leaned over and snatched up the two chocolate mints on the pillows, popping them into her mouth and spitting out the wrappers. She took a deep breath and whatever it was in her eyes that had grabbed me back at Lenny’s caught me again now.

“Do you have low blood sugar or something?” She’d eaten a ton of sweets, but the question just sounded dumb.

“Off.” She slid her hands beneath my jacket and pulled it off my shoulders.

I had been mouth-breathing for a time because while we’d been pressing faces my nose accidentally pounded into her cheek and it stung like hell. I took a fiery breath through my nose and her peppermint smell filled my lungs.

The jacket came off and my hands wrenched at the second button when she grabbed either side of my shirt and yanked it open, sending buttons flying. There really was no turning back. No way to explain the shirt to Marjorie. Candy stepped back and began removing her jacket, while my clumsy fingers struggled with my belt buckle. I was gnawing away at my bottom lip, unbuttoning the pants before coming back to the buckle and finally getting it undone.

I stood to kick off my pants and looked up at perfection. She was totally naked (in my mind her white hair rustled in a gentle breeze) with her hands at her sides, leaving herself exposed. My hungry eyes licked over every part—her long neck, down the plane of chest with large, high-setting breasts with quarter-sized areolas and eraser tip nipples, to the flat stomach and slender waist, to the swell of hips above each long leg and finally the thin strip of the tuft of pubic hair, also white.

“Do you want me?” Her voice was deeper—huskier.

I couldn’t find my voice so I nodded like a little boy instead. She pushed me down, straddling me, pinning my arms down as her firm breasts stared me in the face. My mouth latched onto a nipple and she threw her head back, moaning. I put my hands on either side of her, pressing her closer. Her skin was soft, softer than anything in this bed. Candy scratched across my back and one of her nails pop off.

I rolled her onto the bottom, feeling myself hard against her, but not wanting to rush. My head was swimming, my blood was steaming—I was too excited. If I didn’t calm down it would be over way too fast. As I lay on top of her, her milky white thighs crushed around my ribs, her skin felt even hotter than before.

“Are you okay?” I asked, the last shred of rational thought evaporating. My cell rang, attached to my belt on the floor—Marjorie’s ringtone. Perfect. Thinking of my wife was just the thing to cool me off. I hadn’t called her when I got to the office. Candy clasped her hands on my head and pressed my face into her chest. Marjorie would be mad. I kissed and licked, the sheen of sweat tasting like cream soda. So what. I smacked my lips and went back for more.

Candy was moaning and writhing, her skin baking everywhere we touched. She slid a hand down my face and across my mouth and I began sucking her fingers. I came to the one where the nail was missing and popped the naked red tip in my mouth, expecting the coppery taste of blood.

It tasted like licorice.

But I was too far gone. As I entered Candy, I sank my teeth into her finger and bit it off. She screamed, but it didn’t sound like it was from pain. She was coming.

I kept going, my body thrusting on autopilot. I fell on top of her, sinking my teeth into her shoulder. What I tore away tasted like spongecake. I chewed, swallowed and bit off the tip of her chin. It fell into tiny pieces and began fizzling on my tongue like pop rocks. Her one arm lay there, useless but the other pounded away on my back before reaching down and pulling my butt.

“Deeper,” Candy growled. “More.”

Her hand reached up and shoved my face into her neck even as I still had a mouthful of strawberry-hard-candy collarbone. I reached down and grabbed two handfuls of breast mushing them between my fingers, planting my face into her gelatin cleavage.

I blanked out soon after I reached her chocolate innards and when I came to all that was left of Candy was a piece of forearm, the top of her head and her calves. I had a sick-full feeling that passed some when I stood, but when I touched my stomach it was flat. Too flat, in fact, my waist too narrow and when I grabbed my butt that felt too high, firm and also hairless.

I let my hands roam up my body until they curved around a pair of full breasts.

“What?” I said. My voice wasn’t right. Too high. I ran into the bathroom, my muscles taut as they buoyed me to the reflection in the mirror of a statuesque brunette with sea-green eyes. The hair and eyes were mine, but other than that it was practically the same face as Candy’s save for a few freckles across the nose.

The look in her eyes made sense. I had it now; a wild-eyed expression like I was in a constant state of surprise. It was strange that I wasn’t panicked—I’d just eaten someone. To death. It was like this was supposed to happen, some insane rite of passage. I wasn’t even freaked out about this metamorphosis. But then a massive cramp scraped down the inside of my belly, like a red hot poker with a hundred needles in it, folding me over until I was hugging myself and staring at my knees.

There was half a peppermint on the floor. I snatched it up and swallowed it. The cramp subsided into a dull thumping, promising it would come again. I didn’t know how many of those I could take.

Red lipstick words written in three lines on the mirror to the side of my reflection read,

“Put away your suit before you bring him back.

Tighter works better.

Eat lots of sugar.”

Had Candy been another guy like me? I touched the place where my penis had been and found it wet. My fingertip tasted sweet.

My belly was hot where the cramp was and I recalled how hot Candy had been all over. I ran out of the bathroom and began putting on the clothes Candy had just taken off. A perfect fit but they couldn’t have looked right the way they felt on me. I kept pulling at the skirt like that would make it longer and scooped up my old suit, dumping the items onto the huge pile of men’s clothes in the closet.

I stopped at the front door, touching my cheek. This morning was the last time my Marjorie would ever touch me. Too bad I’d turned into one of those guys. There was no stopping now, but there was something I could do maybe she might be proud of. I ran back into the bathroom and snatched off a fistful of toilet paper. The lipstick wouldn’t come off, but it smeared enough to where no one else would be able to read it. Another cramp came, much smaller though, as I headed out the door and down the stairs, looking for the shoes Candy had left behind. Instinct was running me, guiding my long legs out the motel.

I had to do what Candy did.

Something in my head screamed for me to go back upstairs and lie down in the bed—let the next person be brave. I shuddered, not from the freezing winter air, but thinking of having sex with a man. The diner was a quick walk back. The door tinkled as I opened it, spotting Lenny, still there behind the counter.
