It was horribly cold, the type of cold that always left you wondering if the chills that ran so steadily down your spine were simply a result of the whispering wind or perhaps something darker, something ancient and ultimately unknowable. I was standing entirely and completely alone at the bus stop on Filmore Street, it was not how I had wanted that night to end, but whatever can you do when your designated driver abandons you to go sleep with a guy she barely knows, it leaves you with very limited options.

There I stood shivering in the darkness save for the flickering light above my head. Unfortunately I wasn’t alone anymore. A man had appeared before me, a tall man in a black suit, a dirty black suit, something he must have looted out of some poor souls grave. He looked young enough, though his skin seemed worn and ragged, the skin of a man who’d lived a long hard life layered haphazardly atop a youthful facade. He told me I was lovely, which from him I didn’t much appreciate, and had informed me that I looked cold. Of course he wasn’t wrong, I think my coat at that moment was still wrapped around the waist of a dumb teenager who’d failed to reach the bathroom after one too many beers. The tall man peered downwards.

“I can see all the little goose pimples down your arm my dear” he’d said.

He reached out and caressed my skin, his grimy rough fingers surfing over each minute bump. His gnarled dirty nails creating ghost white lines in my flesh. I stood there still, not even flinching, in fact I didn’t make a sound. I simply watched on as his long grotesque moved up and down my arm. I dared look up towards his face only to find he was staring ever intensely into my eyes with an almost inhuman smirk plastered across his face as if the flesh were trying pull desperately from his skull. His eyes seemed endless, a void by which no love or compassion could ever be found, deep dark eyes like a well of pure tar. I gazed back at his hand on my skin.

“Please don’t touch me” I’d finally pleaded, meekly as not to offend, though why that was a concern of mine I hardly know. 

He ignored me entirely and so I glanced back towards his eyes and came to a realisation. He wasn’t looking at me, not really, no he was looking right through me. As if I wasn’t really there, God maybe neither of us truly were.  

“I can help you get warm” he said, the smile still stapled on his face.

I told him I was okay and he retracted his arm from mine and took a few careful steps back. Still staring through me, he began gently strip away his clothing, his dirty black suit soon crumpled on the pavement. I watched in utter bewilderment, I’d wanted desperately to run but I found myself stuck hopelessly in the tar of his eyes, sinking, slowly but surely into the cosmic black nothingness of his soul or lack there of. Now with all his clothes on the floor the man continued to strip, only this time he dug grimy gnarled nails into his shoulder blades and began to effortlessly peel away his skin revealing the unnaturally crimson flesh beneath. He’d started with his arms, then his torso down to his legs, all the while smiling… staring. The sound was wet and papery and so incredibly loud, even with the unrelenting wind as if the sound was coming from within my own brain. He placed each shred of his leathery skin atop his crumpled clothes, drenching the once dirty black garbs in a newfound deep red wash. He finished off his gruesome transformation by the tearing the skin off his face and adding it to the ever growing mess of flesh and fabrics.

“Come, come get warm little girl” he’d beckoned through his bare bloody lips.

I’d felt myself entranced by the notion, unable to control myself, drawn to his wet crimson visage, I stood forward, closer and closer to the monstrosity before me, ready to embrace its warmth. He stood there arms outstretched, dripping infinitely with blood, for the first time since walking upon me that evening he averted his eyes from my direction. He looked up towards the night sky, black in its infinite nothingness like the contents of his eyes. I was so close to him now, I could feel it, I knew right then that I would never be cold again, I would never be anything again and in that I found an ever enticing comfort. Yes, only warmth, sweet, sweet warmth. I closed my eyes, I was beyond ready to received my ultimate reward. Then a noise struck me, the bouncing of a large metal chassis, the rubbery screech of heavy wheels. The bus had finally arrived, I opened my eyes and the man was gone, the pile of clothes and flesh vanished too. I turned to my left and was almost blinded by the lights radiating from the bus windows as it pulled up beside me. I watched as the doors drew open and the driver looked me up and down asking if I was okay, he offered me his jacket which I thought was sweet yet unusual gesture until I’d followed his eyes and found my bare pale skin reflecting in the bus light, I was completely devoid of clothing, the nights carefully chosen outfit laying in a neat pile behind me. 

“I’m… cold” I’d told the driver, trembling as I did.

In the end I can’t help but hope that man will come back, that that offer of eternal warmth will still be waiting for me, it really is so so cold out here.
