I'm about to start my senior year of college. Last semester I took a job as a desk attendant at my school's library. It's a private university so they get away with paying their workers below minimum wage but I don't mind. So long as I make enough to be able to afford my gas I'm in the clear. I commute about an hour back and forth from home to school every day of the week so a little gas money goes a long way.

The cool thing about the library job is that it doesn't require much from me. I sit at a desk and check books in and out, answer the occasional phone call, and help wherever needed. I have a lot of downtime and spend most of it reading or catching up on homework. Hours are a little sporadic though, my schedule usually looks something like this…Tuesday: 2pm to 4:30pm, Thursday: 4:30pm to 10. The library closes at 10. I spend many of those hours doing nothing at all really. 

Being in the library for so long with nothing to do you begin to take notice of certain things. Like when the library is most active and when there's no one in there at all. It's fairly active towards the start of my shift around 4:30, and dies down from about 5:30 to 7. From 7 to 9 there's usually a good deal of traffic in and out. More often than not though, I spend that last hour from 9 to 10 completely alone there. Those nights when I'm there until close I'm responsible for shutting the lights off and locking the room downstairs that houses the library's book collection. I'm never down there during the day, most of the textbooks students need to check out are kept upstairs and are never more than a few steps away from my desk. Locking that room is the last thing I do before I go home for the night. 

I took this job because I wanted something on campus where I could walk straight from class to work. The last thing I want to do is leave school and have to drive somewhere else to go do more work. So having that job right there on campus was ideal. It is incredibly mundane but I get to see a lot of faces. It's nice to know that people on campus don't just see me as “that weird guy in their economics class” but rather “that guy in the library.” 

Like I said, from about 9 to 10 it's pretty quiet in there. Most of the other lights in the building are usually already turned off before I even leave. One night when I went to lock up the room downstairs I thought I heard something coming from one of the back corners. I called out, asking if anyone was down there, and when no one replied I shut the lights off, waited a beat to see if someone yelled out “Hey I'm down here” or something, but when no one did, I locked the door and closed it behind me. I didn't dwell on it at all. In fact I put the whole thing completely out of my mind almost immediately. I only remembered it again after what happened to me recently.

Another great thing about this library job is that it continues into the summer. My friends hound me endlessly about staying on for the summer “why don't you just get a job in town” they say. “Something that's not an hour away and pays better.” I don't want a different job though. I like working there. I like being on campus when no one else is. There's a strange feeling to it, but it's one I like, it makes me feel like a true staff member there and not just some student worker. 

The job is different over the summer though. Since there's no students coming in to check out books there's really no need to just sit at the desk upstairs. Lots of other libraries request books from us, so the first part of my workday involves packaging up those books for shipment. It's a long complicated process and it usually takes most of the morning. Once that is done however, the summer project has been to go down to the book collection and make sure all the books are still there. There's a huge list, all on an excel spreadsheet, every book in the entire library, and my job is to go through and check every single one to make sure that it's there and cataloged properly. If a book isn't there I type an x next to it in the excel sheet and move on. Lots of books that are shelved aren't even on the list. Those books, I turn onto their spine and my boss comes through later and takes them out. 

I don't work alone though, there's another girl that works with me. We each take a section and start on either end, checking off books until we meet in the middle, once we're done we move on to the next section and start the process again. The collection is large enough that oftentimes starting on either end of one section means that she and I are several shelves away from one another. 

Summer hours are different too. I work from 9 am to 4 pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and from 9 am to 2 pm Wednesdays and Fridays, I get Saturday through Monday off which is pretty nice. 

One day when work was about over I came back upstairs from the collection and remarked casually to my boss that I found a book down there from the 1890s. She didn't seem as thrilled as me about the discovery. 

“Go wash your hands,” she said.

I was a little confused.

“Why's that?” I asked.

“In books from before 1900 they used to use heavy metals like lead and mercury in the publishing process. I attended a conference a while back and they talked about that. I'm doing my best to take all of those books out and get rid of them. Go wash your hands.”

I went and washed my hands in the bathroom and while I was in there I couldn't help but realize the tragedy of what she had said. She was going to be getting rid of any old books she found. It's not that these books were all that interesting, usually some old treatise on bird watching or something like that, but still. Old books are cool, poisonous or not, and I hated to see them going into the dump.

Most days down in the book collection its my boss, my one coworker, and myself. We often talk back and forth from across the room about strange books we find. Calling out goofy titles and things of the like. I occasionally find an old book from the late 1800s and tell my boss. She snatches them up and puts them on her cart. I hate seeing that, so I have taken to just not telling her about them.

Summer time temperatures are in full swing so most days it's about 90 degrees or so outside. Problem is it's about 60 degrees down in that book collection room. So I always have on a sweater or something over my t-shirt. When I step outside to go to lunch it's always incredibly too hot for all the clothes I have on, but if I didn't have them I'd freeze to death down in that book collection. 

When my boss told me that my co-worker would be gone for the next two weeks I didn't think much of it. It was an easy job and all her absence meant was that it would just take a little longer to get through sections of books now. Lots of times I was down in that room by myself. My boss was often in her office or running various errands around campus. I always knew when she came back down there because I could hear her begin scanning books and putting them on her cart. Though I hardly ever saw her, I'd occasionally catch a glimpse of her between shelves of books.

I always bring earbuds because without some kind of podcast or music playing, 4 hours or so in that collection would just drive me insane.

I came into work the other day, fifteen minutes late, ten minutes later than usual, and noticed that my boss was not at her usual place behind her desk. I took my seat at my desk and saw a note stuck to the computer screen. 

“Good morning! I will be out of town today and tomorrow (Thursday and Friday), if you run into any issues with loans or anything don't worry about it, we will figure it out next week. Have a great weekend !”

Reading this note I honestly breathed a sigh of relief, now I could slack off and not feel bad about it. It's not that I hate this job, but it's not exactly easy to lock in and work when all you are doing is reading call numbers on books and putting a little check mark or an x on a spreadsheet. I did my best to get all the loans taken care of for that day and immediately took advantage of my boss's absence. 

Anytime I want a drink when I'm working I have to walk to a separate building nearby where there is a vending machine. It takes roughly five or six minutes to get from the library to the vending machine and back. That building with the vending machine is one of the oldest still standing on campus, even in broad daylight it gives me the creeps. 

I got a drink and took the long way back to the library. I was probably gone for about ten minutes. I went down to the book collection, put my headphones in, and picked up from where I left off the day before. I was at the very back of the library, the farthest corner from the door. Back there one of the overhead fluorescent lights is out so it's oddly dark. Having just got back from that creepy old building I was already somewhat spooked when I got back down to the book collection. Like I said that room is always cold, but that day it felt even colder. I genuinely felt like my sweater and sweatpants were not enough to keep me warm. The longer I was down there the more I wished I had a jacket, or a thicker sweater or something. 

I made the mistake of listening to a creepy podcast that day. This was a podcast I always listened to while working down there, but today, all alone, in that cold, poorly lit library, I realized that it was a mistake. I periodically took my headphones out because I swore I heard something. Each time I was proven to be incorrect. Thankfully.

I wondered for a while if the air conditioning in the building was broken or something. I could not think of any other reason why it was so cold in the book collection compared to the rest of the building, and especially outside. When I went out for lunch that day I was genuinely shocked by the temperature discrepancy. I had to take my sweater off before I even got to my car. If you have ever been in a garage or an old basement in the Winter then you’d have a pretty good idea of what it felt like in that book collection. 

Getting back from lunch I resumed my work, and yes, that same creepy podcast. As time ticked away down there I suddenly got an overwhelming feeling that I was being watched. I couldn’t see or hear anyone else down there, but I felt it strongly. I set my laptop down and walked around the room, checking every aisle of bookshelves. I looked through all of the windows to see if anyone might have been outside, but there was no one. I was still completely alone. I began to long for the work day to be over. I wanted to go home. I had gotten spooked and at that point there was no getting unspooked. I checked my phone and saw that it was 3 o’clock. I was relieved, only one hour left. I went back to my work, but I soon became aware of some kind of sound. I pulled one of my earbuds out and listened. It was some kind of humming. I couldn’t tell if it was from a machine or from a person. That collection room of the library contains a lot of doors that are always locked with little signs that say things like “boiler room,” or “mechanical room.” I figured this humming, which I had not heard at all this Summer, must be coming from one of those rooms, but even still it didn’t do my nerves any favors.
I left my earbuds out, turned off my podcast, and decided to finish that last hour of work in silence. After all, I was getting sick of pulling an earbud out every five minutes or so to check for some strange sound.  

I heard a book fall. It was plain as day and unmistakable, somewhere, several shelves away from me a book just fell off of a shelf and hit the floor. That’s got to be a pretty common thing in libraries though right? I got up and looked for it. I saw it, it was one of those old books. It was so old that it wasn’t even in English, I’m fairly certain that it was Latin. I picked up the book and put it back in place. I realized while reshelving it that it came from a very tightly packed shelf. I honestly had trouble squeezing it back into its place. Why would that book have fallen? It was almost like someone had tried to pick it off the shelf, dropped it, and ran away. But I knew that couldn’t be what happened because I would have heard all of that, but I didn’t, all I heard was that book hitting the floor. 

I checked my phone and saw that it was only 3:07. How had only seven minutes passed? I decided that I was done anyway. I needed to get out of that room, I was freezing, and I was scared. I shut my laptop and left. I hit the lights on my way out, and I know I heard another book fall before I closed the door, but I was not going to stick around to put it back. 

The whole drive home I thought of how ridiculous I was being. A book fell in a library, big whoop. That’s possibly the most normal thing that could happen in a library. I figured that I had just gotten spooked and had overreacted to everything. Fear has a way of heightening your senses, that must have been why I could hear every little noise in that library all day. I wondered if that humming I heard was something that is always going on, or something that kicks on periodically and I just have never noticed before. By the time I got back home I was laughing at myself for how paranoid I had been. 

I woke up late the next day. It was raining. Rolls of thunder kept me from getting up. It was so nice, so peaceful. When I actually looked at my phone and saw the time, that cloud of serenity dissipated. I jumped out of bed and quickly got dressed, rushed to my car, and sped out of my driveway. Halfway to the school I realized that there was no reason for all this hurry. No one was there at work. When I arrived I could be sure that I would be alone. A sinking feeling crept into my stomach at that realization. I thought of the day before. I was scared of my mind wandering again, elevating every little thing I heard or noticed. My fear was not of the library, but of what my own imagination would do to me while I was down there. I did not want it to happen again. 

I figured the more I thought about it the more my imagination would mess with me. So when I actually got into work I put my earbuds in and turned on some music. Most of the other people that work on campus must have had the day off that day because it really felt like I was the only human being on the entire campus that day. It was so bad that I checked my schedule a few times just to make sure that I was in fact supposed to work that day. I was, there was no mistake there. There were other cars in the parking lots, and some parked along the streets near the campus but I really did not see anyone. 

I began the typical morning schtick, checking for loan requests and all that. There were none that day. That meant I had nothing more to do that day other than go down to that collection room and start checking books. The room loomed over my mind. My imagination had begun to have its way with it but I quickly pulled myself back together. 

“It’s an old room in an old library, of course it’s gonna be creepy, of course the central air isn’t going to work right down there. Books fall off of shelves, that just happens, it is fine, get over it.” I said to myself as I slowly crept down the stairs. 

I reached the final step and turned to look down the short hallway to the collection room door. It was still shut, just like I left it. I slowly walked over to it and opened the door. I had forgotten to shut one light off. There was a single fluorescent light panel, illuminating a small part of the collection room. It was closer to the back of the room, surrounded on all sides by darkness. Simple, and explainable, but there was just something about it. The sound the light made, the darkness surrounding it, the dull yellowish nature of the light itself. My stomach sank immediately. I debated turning back right then, but instead chose to stay, I flicked the other light switches and the rest of the lights came on. It wasn’t so bad like that. The sinking feeling in my stomach went away. 

It was as cold down there as it ever was, though it felt colder as my clothes and hair had not yet dried from my rainy walk from my car to the library. The clouds were dark enough that not much natural light got through the windows of that room. This left the corners dark, and made the light feel unnatural. The upbeat music playing in my earbuds did only a passingly decent job at keeping my imagination from running wild. A few times, like the day before, I thought I heard something. At some point I remembered  the book that had fallen before I closed up the day before. I wondered where that was, and went looking for it. I walked between the shelves searching for the book. I never found it. 

I had heard a book fall right?

The sinking feeling came back a little bit. I returned to where I was, towards the back most part of the room, wary, and growing increasingly more nervous. I felt as though the room was getting incrementally colder as the day went on. At one point I swear I saw my own breath. 
Suddenly my hair stood up on the back of my neck. I looked up from my laptop, I peeked through the shelves. Something was watching me and I knew it. 

I pulled my earbuds out and held perfectly still. I heard that same humming that I heard the day before. It seemed louder this time. I stepped away from my place in the shelves once again and began to walk down the aisles between the shelves. The humming did not seem like it was coming from one of those locked storage closets, honestly it didn’t seem to have any source or point of origin at all. 

I found a strange spot on the ceiling in one of the aisles. I think that it was near the same shelf where the book had fallen. The spot looked like mold to me. It was black, but not faded or soaked in like how a lot of mold looks. It was dark black, and almost shiney. It looked like someone had bought a paint can from Lowe’s or Home Depot, opened the lid, and thrown it up at the ceiling. I understand that it must be mold or something but I just don’t think I’ve seen anything like it before. Another thing about that huge black spot, it was cold. Just standing below it I felt like I was in a meat freezer. Perhaps just above that spot was where the central air was broken, I really don’t know how that even works, like maybe a pipe or tube was broken or ripped or something. Whatever it was, that explanation satisfied me enough, I walked back to the place where I was before and started working again. I found it incredibly hard to focus on my work. I wanted to leave. I was getting freaked out again, the same way I was yesterday, I was trying as hard as I could to keep my composure, not to become paranoid like I had before. 

I sat on a stool staring straight ahead at the shelf of books in front of me. I wanted to ignore the feeling, but the longer I sat there the harder it became. Someone, something, was looking at me, I could feel eyes on me. When I finally allowed the feeling to manifest fully I felt paralyzed. As though whatever was looking at me could only sense motion or something. I heard a different sound, like the sound of something freezing, or growing. It sounded like water soaking into a dry sponge. I seemed to perceive a dark shape hovering above me, but I couldn’t bear to look up. I rationalized that a particularly dark rain cloud had passed close to the windows and blocked out even more of the Sun. 

I heard a book fall again. I got up quickly, I grabbed my laptop and shut it, tucking it under my arm. I walked around until I found the book. It was that same old book that had fallen before. I knelt down to pick it up. As I stretched out my hand to pick up the book I felt a hand touch my shoulder. The hair on my neck stood straight, my skin tightened around my muscles and became covered in goosebumps. WIthout turning around I stood and began to run. I hit a sharp right turn at the end of that row of shelves and another just a few shelves from that, then I had a straight and clear path for the door. I could hear it, whatever it was, I heard footsteps behind me, not running, but footsteps nevertheless. As I neared the door I reached out to shut off the lights. I hit the switch and just before shutting the door I dared turn and look behind me. In the darkness I thought I saw a shape, something terrible, something tall, it’s other qualities I could only speculate, though overall it appeared human-like. I slammed the door shut and ran out to my car. The moment the door slammed shut I heard the thing scream. I will never forget that sound.

I haven’t gone back to work there. I’ve ignored the emails from my boss which I started getting the week after the incident. After a few weeks the emails from her stopped. I dreaded returning to school, I did all I could to avoid setting foot in that library. If I ever do have to be in there I avoid the bottom floor, and even on the other floors I keep it brief. I figured I would get a chewing out from my boss if she ever saw me again. The first time I saw her though I did not see disdain or anger in her eyes, what I saw was understanding, trauma, as though she knew why I had left and never come back. We did not talk but rather shared this look of understanding. 

After this I ventured to open the emails which she had sent me. I found in the first email confusion as to why I had not gone in to work that day. The next email from a day later had more anger to it. Then there was the third email. It simply said…

“I understand.”

Towards the end of that fall semester one cool October day I arrived at school to find the library closed. I saw men in hazmat suits going in and out of the building. When I got glimpses inside I could see plastic covering everything. They told the students that there was black mold discovered in the library, and that considerable efforts were required to clean up and dispose of the mold. They also told us that the librarian had taken a job at another school and would not be returning. I never believed that; and the fact that the library never reopened only confirmed what I had thought.

I’ve put as much detail into this as I could possibly remember just in case anyone here has ever encountered anything similar. I’ve thought about it and was wondering if black mold exposure causes hallucinations or something. I don’t want to believe what I saw down there that day, but I’m haunted by the memories, memories too vivid to pretend like they are from a dream. But maybe if someone else had a similar experience or knows exactly what I was encountering down there then perhaps I could feel some kind of closure about this whole thing.
