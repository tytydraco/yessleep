Last summer, I visited my family in Thailand. My mom, stepdad, and stepbrother have been living in Phuket since 2018, not far from the beach near Kamala—an area known for its beauty… and its history. If you know about the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, you might recognize the name. That wave took thousands of lives, both locals and tourists. It’s a place with grief baked into the sand.

I never believed in ghosts. Not really. But what my mom told me while I was there made me question everything I thought I knew about what’s real.

She said it happened a few years ago, when she was home alone. My stepdad and stepbrother had left for a month-long business trip in China, and she had fallen ill shortly after they left. High fever, chills, body aches. She was confined to bed in their apartment, a few floors up with a partial view of the sea. It was hot—as it always is in Phuket—so she left the windows open to let the ocean breeze come through. She likes the way the curtains move when the wind flows in.

It was around 2 in the morning when it happened.

She said she was lying on her side, half-conscious from the fever, when she felt it—a presence behind her. Not a sound, not a shadow. A presence. She said it was so sudden and so real that she stopped breathing for a second.

Then the bed shifted.

She felt something kneel behind her, slowly pressing weight onto the mattress. Her body went stiff. Something—or someone—placed their knees down first, then shifted their body down next to hers. She felt hairy, wet arms wrap around her waist from behind.

She could smell him. Cologne. Expensive, masculine, Western. She felt the moisture of his skin, like he had just come from the sea. His chest pressed against her back, warm but soaked. She was frozen in fear, unsure whether she was dreaming or dying. She didn’t dare move.

Eventually, she must have passed out. But what happened next is what still makes my skin crawl.

When she woke up in the morning, the other side of the bed was drenched. Her sheets, her pillow—wet, as though someone had spent the night beside her. The scent of cologne still clung to the room.

She checked the windows. Nothing looked disturbed. No one had broken in. No sign of forced entry. Just that cold, wet spot. She told herself it was the fever. A hallucination. But she couldn’t shake the feeling that someone had been there.

A few days later, my stepdad and 3-year-old stepbrother returned. That’s when it got weirder.

As soon as they walked in the door, my little brother pointed to a corner of the room and said, “Mama… there’s a ghost.”

No prompting. No story. Just that, in toddler-speak, like it was the most obvious thing in the world. My mom said she looked over at my stepdad, expecting him to laugh it off, but instead, he looked pale and didn’t say a word. They never talked about it again.

They moved out not long after.

But this wasn’t the only strange thing my mom has experienced.

When my grandmother passed away years ago—after a long battle with cancer—my mom was devastated. She slept with my grandmother’s pillow every night. At first, it brought her comfort. But after a while, she started having strange episodes in her sleep.

She would twitch uncontrollably, sometimes letting out groans. Her eyes would roll back in her head. It was like watching someone possessed. After each episode, she’d wake up completely drained, like the life had been sucked out of her.

It kept happening for weeks.

Finally, after trying everything else, my stepdad suggested burning the pillow. A Buddhist monk they had spoken to told them that sometimes objects can trap energy—or worse, spirits. So they did. They burned it in a small ceremony.

That night, she slept peacefully. The twitching never came back.

My mom says she’s always been sensitive to that kind of thing. She told me that when she was younger, she saw an old woman crawl up a wall using her bare hands. She wasn’t dreaming. She says she was wide awake. She never found out who the woman was.

I used to think all of this was nonsense—until I went to visit.

During my stay, I was in a guest room in their newer place—nothing near Kamala, and certainly no view of the beach. It felt normal enough. But one night, at exactly 1AM, I heard knocking from inside the closet. Not loud. Just three soft knocks. Spaced out. Calm. Too calm.

I didn’t open it.

The next morning, I casually told my mom and stepdad, trying to laugh it off. “Might’ve been termites or something,” I said.

But they didn’t laugh. They both went quiet. My mom looked at me and said, “Don’t joke about knocking. If you hear it, ignore it.”

That’s all she said.

I haven’t heard it since. But every time I think about that wet cologne-soaked man in her bed, I wonder if it was just her imagination… or if something else came out of the sea that night, looking for warmth. Or maybe company.
