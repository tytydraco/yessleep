“My daughter was 16 years old when she “killed herself”. I’d never felt such pain before that day. No one gets you ready for the death of your child- kids are meant to bury their parents. It was to my horror when I had to bury her. Rita was 16 when it happened, only 3 days after her birthday. It was a shock to me to find her laying in her room unconscious. 

Rita never displayed any signs of mental health issues and I always made sure to check up on her if something was up or if she was acting off. The only thing we knew she struggled with was dislexia.Most of the time it was boy trouble or girls being bitchy at school.
I suffer with BPD so I know how hard people try to hide this it problems to the world. 
She was always a quiet girl and was very polite to everyone. She was always happy and it seemed she loved her life. 
After the day I found her, I could never figure out why she did it. We were super close and she never hid anything from me. Even things kids don’t usually tell their parents, like sneaking out, trying cigarettes etc. she was always so honest.

On 31st august 2019 is when I found her, laying their pale as anything. I immediately tried to wake her and called 999. On the scene they found her “suicide note”. I opened it and read the few lines she left. “ I am sorry mum. I tried but I couldn’t cope anymore- I love you!” Something about this didn’t sit right with me. 
The spelling was perfect? Her handwriting was perfect? I dwelled on it while mourning the loss of my daughter.

A few weeks later I decided to investigate why she would do this;find any clues.
That’s when I  found her diary and my heart sank.

He could be anywhere or anyone, his meds might make him look”normal” so please becareful of who your with.”

I found this drafted. In my sisters phone after she “killed herself” on may 27th 2020.
I only just got it back after 3 years and now I fear I am next because my new boyfriend is called Jack.
