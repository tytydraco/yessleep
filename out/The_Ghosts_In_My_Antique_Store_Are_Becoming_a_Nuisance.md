I'm going to assume you've heard about phantoms and have a general conception of where they can be found. Popular culture depicts them as being attached to specific locations, such as a house, landmark, or burial ground. They can be either benign or malevolent (usually the latter) and show up at random intervals. People on television use these strange radio-like contraptions to attempt to speak with them, or try to induce them using magic or some nonsense. 

Well, I'm here to tell you that all of that is wrong.

Ghosts are on another existential plane, which allows them to be multiple places simultaneously. I like to think of it as pieces of a person's soul attaching to different objects or sites, but that isn't a scientific analysis or anything, just my opinion as a 53-year-old man who has been selling old junk for almost three decades. Anyways, a beloved item from a person's life possesses a bit of their essence transcending the boundaries of physical reality. Maybe you've felt energy from a specific home or snow globe or pair of shoes; that is you feeling the "essence". Even if you are able to sense it, that does not mean that you will ever see the owner. Ghosts are people, after all, and only want to appear in places they like. That's why I always get a chuckle seeing some bumbling television host attempting to contact spirits that had been tortured in life at the location they are exploring. Do you really think that a former slave hangs out at the plantation they were forced to work on in life?

These phantoms only present in places where they either have a positive connotation or places that are neutral but have their beloved object, probably even at the same time. I bring this up because my antique store has become one such place and oh boy, is it a doozy. 

I thought it was charming and quaint at first. They would come by for very short periods of time and then disappear for a while. You could attempt to speak with them (the ones that spoke English, anyway) and they would occasionally reply, but often just ignore you.  They were invisible to customers, and didn't mess with displays. In fact, sometimes they were even beneficial. A young woman with a particular attachment to a 72-piece set of Gorham Strasbourg flatware always ensured that it was perfectly polished. I hate shining silver, so I thought it was great. When it sold, I credited the phantom polisher with helping to make it look appealing. She went along with the silverware, so I never got to thank her. But their attachment to these objects encouraged them to keep them clean, so the free labor abounded. 

Unfortunately, as time went on, they got comfortable. Even after their object sold, they had formed a positive connotation with my shop and stuck around. They started getting to know one another (don't ask me how that works, because I don't have the faintest idea) and appearing more often. They started throwing parties in the break room using items that were for sale and never cleaned up after themselves. Many mornings I entered the small kitchen to see streamers on the walls and the floor, crystal drinkware on the table, teapots half-full of tea, and tablecloths that the ghosts had used and stained in my absence. Things would accidentally get broken during these soirees, some of which were a part of a rare, expensive, hard-to-find set. 

I approached a group of them having a picnic during store hours and really let them have it, but they didn't acknowledge me and continued on. I tried destroying items that were inexpensive to see if that helped. Sometimes it did, but other times they had already formed an attachment to the shop. 

I've started exclusively doing travelling antique shows since they overtook my shop, but they are driving me crazy and this cannot continue. I've taken all of the items out of my shop, and I plan to burn it down later this evening. That way, I can at least have a chance of pawning these obnoxious idiots off on an unsuspecting buyer during one of the shows, which generally only last a few days. Not long enough for them to establish roots anywhere. The shop has fire insurance, so I'll get back some of my money. 

The only unintentional consequence is that I'll have to hear the violent screams of souls being burned. A physical death is one thing, but when a piece of someone's soul is killed, it is a pain that reverberates across eternity. But what other option do I have? 

If anyone has advice for evicting some pain in the ass ghosts, PLEASE give me a call.
