I met Ashley when I was 18. It was the last couple of months of high school I just lost a close friend group Ashley must have sensed I was vulnerable and she approached me asking if I was ok. needing someone to talk to I vented to her about how I lost my friends. We became friends after that. We'd hang out at lunch and help each other with homework after school. After graduating she asked me out and I said yes. Our first couple of years went by great until she started getting more aggressive. She'd bite me on my neck a little too hard. She'd apologize and quickly pull herself away looking like she was scared. Then I started finding little drops of blood around the house. Or I'd feel like I was bit on my neck in my sleep but when I woke up and checked on it there was nothing there. One day when I got home from work I found her leaning over something. I slowly approached asking if she was ok. 

My heart stopped after what I saw she was tearing into a man's neck drinking blood from it crazily.

"what the fuck!"

I screamed backing away with the feeling of bile rising in my throat. Ashley stopped what she was doing and dropped the man's body. She slowly turned towards me licking the blood of the man off her lips. She headed towards me. Not getting up and walking, no she crawled towards me like a mountain lion stalking its prey. I go to run but Ashley lets out this loud blood-curdling scream lunging at me and tackling me to the ground I tried to push her off me but she was too strong. She dragged me deeper into the house giggling. I managed to kick myself free from her grasp. I get up from the ground and run towards the front door open it and run out of the house with Ashley chasing me. Thankfully someone called the cops. It took 5 grown men to restrain her. After two days of questioning, I couldn't go back to my house. I decided to sell it and move to a different state and into a small cabin in the middle of nowhere out of fear. After a couple of months, I got a call from a number I'd never seen before. I answer it.

"hello is this Trent Brown?"

I hear I professional-sounding voice ask.

"yes, what do you want?"

I asked hoping the call would be over.

"This is Dr. Prim the head doctor of Blackwood mental hospital. You're the only person Ashley has written down in her contacts and I believe you visiting her could hel-."

I cut him off.

"No, I don't think I can look at her anymore after what she did. She was trying to kill me."

I said going to hang up the phone.

"Mr. Brown wait!"

I roll my eyes and bring the phone back up to my ear.

"What?"

I decided to hear what he had to say.

"she's getting worse. Acting more and more out of con-"

He's cut off by what I'm guessing was one of the other doctors or nurses bursting into his office. 

"she got out! She just ripped the guard's throat out and drank his blood! Ripped her cell door open like it was paper!"

The only thing I heard after that was the sounds of people screaming, flash ripping, and bones breaking with the sound of Ashley drinking their blood. I go to hang up the phone but I hear Ashley breathing into the phone before she speaks.

"Baby is that you?"

Her voice made my heart flutter in fear.

"c'mon talk to me, baby."

I hang up the phone dropping it on the floor. I sit there breathing heavily. It took me a bit but I gathered myself packing only essential stuff into a couple of bags and heading outside to my car I get in and drive off. A couple of weeks pass and I keep seeing this humanoid bat thing fly at the corner of my eye. And a flapping noise every time I turn around. Now I'm sitting in a hotel room I can hear someone knocking on my door. They just spoke it's Ashley I don't know if I'm going to die or not.
