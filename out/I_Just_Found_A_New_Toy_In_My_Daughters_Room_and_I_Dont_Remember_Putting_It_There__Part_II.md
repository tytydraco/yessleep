“That doesn’t make any sense,” Jess said, folding a towel with brisk, practiced motions. We had the bed between us, the basket half-empty, slumping towers of laundry softening the space.

“I know,” I said. “But it wasn’t there yesterday. I swear. That toybox – it just showed up.”

Jess didn’t look up. “We didn’t bring one in.”

“No. I mean—we didn’t. I didn’t.”

She gave a small, dry exhale. Not quite a sigh. “She’s a kid, Rob. She’s got an imagination. Like you. You feed that in her.”

I dropped the shirt I’d been folding, ran a hand over my face. “It’s not just what she said. It’s how she said it. Like she didn’t think it was strange at all.”

Jess finally met my eyes. “You’re wound tight lately. She’s playing. That’s what kids do.”

Every creak in the floorboards sounded different now, like the house was learning new ways to speak. Even if nothing had changed—except for that one, glistening black addition.

“I keep checking on her,” I muttered. “She’s always fine. Watching TV, playing with Snacks. But –”

“But?”

I paused, trying to slow my thoughts down. I’d hardly been able to work after what Win had told me, and Jess was right. I did have a big imagination.

But every creak I heard upstairs, every time Win came bounding down the steps, I felt it. The living music of the house had a different cadence. There was a wrongness I couldn’t name. Like something was just…off. And yet Win was happy. Playing with her new toy.

Milkshake.

“It’s just,” I said, “it didn’t feel like make-believe.”

“Well of course not,” she said, “because it was just a dream or something babe. Seriously. Kid’s say weird things sometimes.”

I tried not to bristle. Jess was just like this – the practical one, measured. The planner. She kept us grounded and I was glad she did. She encouraged me, she kept me hopeful. And I loved her so much for that.

But in that moment? I just wanted someone to reassure me. The same someone I shared a bed with.

“Then how do you explain the toy?”

Jess put her towel onto a pile of others, each folded straight and neat. She sighed.

“She probably found it somewhere in the house,” Jess said, “I mean, there were clearly kids living here before us. Maybe they left some of their toys laying around. Probably the same with the box.”

And then, quietly and under her breath – “You must have missed it.”

She meant the board in Win’s closet, the one with the names and dates carved into the wood. Candace and Marie. We’d found other pieces of them in the weeks after we’d fully moved in – marker scribbles on the baseboards upstairs, a pair of children’s spades behind the shed. A couple old photographs tucked away in a coat closet – two little girls with their parents all bundled up in early-90’s puffers, red-cheeked and smiling.

Those artifacts made sense to me. You live in a place long enough, you leave something behind. A sock under the bed. A feeling in the walls.  

But the snake?

Milkshake didn’t feel left behind. To me, Milkshake felt *placed*.

“I don’t know,” I said, sitting down on the edge of the bed, “I guess I just don’t like it. It was filthy.”

“So wait until she’s asleep and take it away,” Jess said, hoisting the folded towels in her arms and turning toward the closet.

“But she’s been carrying it around all day,” I said, “she’ll hate me.”

“She won’t hate you,” Jess called from the closet, muffled, “we’ll get her something else this weekend. I saw a flier at the store for a farmer’s market on Sundays – maybe we’ll find her another stuffed snake or whatever.”

“Yeah,” I said called back, taking up my shirt again.

But what I thought to myself was – *Jesus. I hope not*.

\*\*

It took until Jess was nearly asleep for me to make up my mind.

I crept, sneaking as quietly as I could, trying to remember where all the squeaking places were in the floorboards under the carpet that lined the upstairs hallway. I kept the lights out, afraid if I turned them on the splash of bright might wake up Win. I made it all the way to her room in the dark.

And then I opened the door.

The room was dark – darker than the hall. We’d brought our old black-out curtains from the apartment for her windows, covering both in case we needed to put her to bed before the sun had fully set. There wasn’t even a drop of moonlight to light my way.

After a moment I could see a little better, lingering in the doorway. Win was bundled up in her blankets, her back to me, facing the wall. Her toys were scattered about the floor, waiting for the morning. To be arranged.

I scanned them, looking for the snake. I took several long moments to look, but I couldn’t see Milkshake anywhere.

I heard Win sigh, turn around on the bed. I froze, feeling ridiculous, like a cartoon character caught snooping. My back arched, my arms up, bracing myself.

I almost giggled when I heard her sleep-breathing. Her mouth open, she was deep into her dreams. There was something so special about hearing her sleep so peacefully. I hoped then that that feeling would never go away.

But hope is a trap. Sometimes there are nasty surprises waiting in its underbelly, and the sweeter you wish, the more vile what waits underneath the other side of wanting can be.

Her breathing had a little rasp to it. I made a mental note to dust upstairs again that weekend. The house got dusty, and Win wasn’t used to such an old space. All of the grit that builds up in such a lived in place, no matter how hard you clean.

My secret joy drained just a little when I saw the other thing in Win’s bed. Of course it was there. The snake, a dark squiggle in the dark, laid out next to her, its black curves stark against her bright emerald bedsheets.

I felt stupid, I felt like I was breaking some sort of trust, sneaking into her room like that in the middle of the night. Planning to take something away from her that so very clearly gave her joy. At least, I resolved, I would get it away from her in the morning. Wash it before I took it back up to her room. I was afraid it had mold somewhere inside it, from the way it smelled. From the feel of its brittle skin.

And I was just about to turn around, about to sneak back into bed to Jess, when I heard it.

A slow, moaning creak.

I turned, fast and hard. Spinning around on the carpet, all thoughts of sneaking fleeing my mind. And I looked at the shadowed space.

At first I didn’t see anything.

Even though my eyes had adjusted to the dark, the shadows in the nook were darker still. I squinted from where I stood in the middle of the room, between the nook and Win’s bed, and looked deeper. Rats, my mind wanted to jump to rats. Old houses had rats, right?

But then I heard something else. The click of a hinge, a hollow wooden thump. The toybox lid – I was sure of it.

Yawning gently closed.   

My hand shot to my pocket, reaching for my phone. Cursing to myself when I remembered I had left it on the bedside table, plugged into the phone charger. The thought of how far away the phone was then, how naked and helpless I felt without it, made me feel limp. Isolated.

“Hello,” I called, in a whisper.

But there was only silence. It rushed in to fill the space my voice ate up, smothering it. The kind of silence that’s like white noise in and of itself. Static.

The hair on my arms stood up. A mixture of a sudden chill and a growing certainty that I was being watched. Being seen, some dull dark eyes in the dark.

“*Daddy*?”

I turned around again and saw Win sitting up in bed. The lump of her shadowed form under her blankets.

“Baby,” I said, “did you hear something?”

I thought I could make out Win shaking her head in the dark, alert. Her voice sounded muffled, almost pitched.

“*Can I turn on my nightlight Daddy?*”

I could barely see her face, but she sounded scared. Pleading. Something under it, like all the fear I felt had caught on to her. Like it was squeezing her, urgent.

“Yes baby,” I said, feeling stupid that I hadn’t thought of that myself, “please, turn it on.”

I turned back towards the nook, ready for the light to fill up the room. Ready to see whatever was waiting in there.

“*I can’t reach it Daddy*,” I heard her behind me.

I turned back to my girl. She was bundled up still, curling up farther into her blankets. I tried to smile, even though she probably couldn’t see it. To reassure her.

“It’s right by your bed sweetie,” I said, nodding. Encouraging her.

“*I’m scared*,” she said, her voice falling suddenly small. Tiny.

I shuffled over to the end of her bed. The lamp was there, on her bedside table – a Minnie Mouse lamp, her kicking form silhouetted in the blackness. The switch was her hand, and I reached for it, turning it around clockwise.

Darting my gaze back to the nook as light filled the room.

And I did see something there.

A shock of dark black hair, splayed out on the floor. Spilling through the threshold of the nook. My heart jumped, my chest hitching, as I saw it stir. Slither on the floor.

Then my dad instincts kicked in. Flowing through me right after the shock of the sight of the hair. A rage, that someone or something was in my little girl’s room. Hiding and waiting for her.

I strode over to the nook, grabbing one of Win’s tiny tennis racquets in my hand as I did – ready to club the thing to hell.

I stopped in the doorway.

Win was there, curled up in the space at the end of the nook. She was laying on her side, her back to me. Her hair splayed out behind her. The toybox, closed and dark in the shadow, stood next to her.

It was Win’s hair I’d seen.

I froze. That feeling of being watched returned to me. Pushing everything else away.

Because if Win was in the closet, who had been in her bed?

Slowly, slowly, I turned my head back to Win’s bed. My eyes falling over every inch of the room leading to it, my gaze sweeping slow. Doomed, like it was being pulled to the bed.

To whatever was waiting for me, wrapped up in the covers.

But when my eyes finally fell there, all I could see were blankets. Lumped and piled up like someone was underneath them. And, as I watched, they slumped. Fell back into themselves. Deflated.

There was nothing there in the bed. Nothing except for Win’s blankets.

And, of course, Milkshake.

I turned back to the nook, my heart bashing against my ribs, and bent over Win. Scooped her up in my hands. She moaned, half-asleep, as I lifted her up off the floor. Stepping as quick as I could with her in my arms out of the nook. Out of the bedroom.

I took her downstairs and laid her across my lap on the couch. She stirred against me, but only a little. She was still asleep, still young enough to be lifted up and away, asleep through it all. So trusting and so safe.

And I didn’t see it at first what she’d been holding. I had been so quick to get her out of that room, so quick to carry her downstairs, that I had hardly noticed the shape in her hands. But there, in the glow of the TV, I got a good look at it.

It was another toy, another crocheted shape. This one was a little girl. It was crude. The legs and arms no more than fleshy points. It had the same color scale as Milkshake – ash and boney white. All of course except for its eyes.

They were blue. Tiny sapphires in the stitched head. They caught the flickering light from the TV – shining bright and livid.  

Something about the doll rang a familiar bell in me. It couldn’t have been one of Win’s other toys, I knew that – I would never have forgotten something so worn. So wet. But at the same time…I felt like I’d seen it before.

I met the thing’s stare. Grunting. Then I reached down and took the toy from Win’s hands. Her grip relaxed, weak in sleep. I felt the toy and felt that odd cold in its fibers – just like Milkshake.

“Fuck. You,” I said, my voice hard. I threw the thing into the corner of the living room, watched it hit the wall and slide behind the armchair we had there, hearing it skitter to a stop against the baseboards.

Then, with a sigh, I hugged my girl. Hugged her close to my chest and closed my eyes tight against her. Wishing she was dreaming of something good. Something peaceful, free of worry. 

Wishing again and again.

Wishing.

\*\*

I woke up shaking. Violently.

I started, sitting straight up. Almost too fast, because Win was still asleep on my lap. When I saw her there, I froze, hugging her close to me so I didn’t knock her on the floor.

I felt the hand then, on my shoulder.

“Hey,” Jess’s voice from behind me, “*hey*.” 

I turned around, seeing her standing behind the couch. She was dressed for work, lit up from behind by the morning sun, her backpack slung over her shoulder. Her eyes were wide.

“What’s going on?” she asked.

“Shit,” I said, grimacing, “we must have fallen asleep on the couch.”

“I can see that,” Jess said, turning around fast. Too fast. An about-face.

She was pissed.

“Jess,” I called, still getting used to the bright light of morning, “*Jess*.”

She didn’t turn around, was bending over to get her shoes on. Slipping them on, pushing her heels down in them so hard they screeched against the wood floor. I winced, Win stirring in my lap. I tried to move her off of me, carefully and slowly, and I managed to get her onto the cushion beside me. I stood up, my wince deepening – sleeping like that on the couch had put a crick my back.

“Babe,” I said, “I’m sorry. She…she had a bad dream.”

I don’t know why I lied then. Maybe it was because I’d hoped that it was the truth. Not that the bad dream was Win’s, in my wish.

It had been mine.

“I woke up,” she said, hushed, her back to me still, “and I didn’t know where you were.”

“I get it,” I said, trying to reach a hand to her shoulder, in an offering. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to fall asleep, it just happened.”

Jess rejected my touch, and shrugged my hand off. I let it drop to my side, sighing. Trying not to let my sleep-soaked mind carry me to anger.

“Nothing’s wrong,” I almost whispered. “Nothing, babe.”

She stopped, going still. Her back to me. I saw her shoulders sink, by an inch. Then I saw them hitch. Heard her take a breath in, heard it catch.

And I knew what she was thinking.

A few years ago, when Win was just a toddler, I was in a bad place. I had just gotten laid off from my job during the pandemic, and my girls were all I had. Every day I was home alone with them, while Jess scrambled to support us, and my feeling of failure grew. Because – here were these two wonderful loves of mine, the lights in my sky, and as much as I loved the chance to spend time with them – I couldn’t help but feel like every day I couldn’t help get us back on our feet…that I was disappointing them. Failing them. Jess never said anything of the sort to me, and I don’t think she thought it either, but sometimes the worst thoughts we have about ourselves can build up inside us – booming echoes with nowhere to go. Bounding and reverberating through our heads all day until the pressure builds to cook. Frying our sense of reality.

I took Jess’s success for granted. The extra work she did, the more time she spent away from home, I processed as her needing more time away from me. From her loser husband, trapped at home. Win went through a hard spot herself, getting sick from the virus. She was hard to manage, and I spent a few very isolated weeks with her, Jess staying at her parents so she could still do everything she could to work to make up for our loss of income.

I spun stories in my head about the worst-case scenarios. That she was having an affair. That Win was growing to resent me, that all she would associate me with for the rest of her life was sickness. Loneliness.

And none of it was true of course. But, at the time, it felt like the truth. It was what I *wanted* to believe. Because, really, I was just punishing myself. And very unfairly.

So, one night, after Jess came back, I tried to talk to her. She was exhausted – from overworking and also the relief she felt being home at the old apartment again, I’m sure. She didn’t know what I had smoldering inside of me, the thick stew of self-loathing I’d been seeping in for weeks.

She took something I said – I can’t even remember what it was now – with a light heart. Not really willing to hear me. And that hurt me bad, at the time.

So, I waited for her to fall asleep. I sat in bed and watched her, watched how at peace she seemed to be. Seething with an un-real lie.

Then I walked out of the apartment, got in the car, and drove. I drove for a whole night and most of the next day. Not really knowing where I was going.

Jess called me once and then several times in a row. I ignored all of them. It was petty, it was childish. But I was not myself.

I came to my senses at a rest-stop, somewhere a couple of states over. Watching the sun come up over a copse of trees down the hill from the trucker-lot. Something about the time away from the two of them, about how much worse it made me feel, got me to call Jess back.

We talked for a while on the phone there, until the sun was almost setting again behind me and the woods ahead were alive with shadows. We talked a lot more on the drive home. And a whole hell of a lot more once I got there. We had a couple of hard, hard nights. But then, slowly yet wonderfully, a couple of better ones.

And then, some of the best.

“Baby,” I said, coming up behind her, sliding my arms around her waist. Hugging her from behind. “Nothing’s wrong, I promise.”

She turned around to me then, and I reached a hand up to wipe a tear off her cheek. Careful not to smudge her makeup.

“Promise?” she asked, her voice small and close to cracking.

“Swear,” I said. Kissing her.

A few moments later I was watching her go, waving from the front door. She waved back, a little smile on her lips. I watched the car go down the road until the taillights were too small to see the red.

Before shutting the door. Before letting my gaze linger above me, to the ceiling. On the other side, on the second floor, was exactly where Win’s room was.

I sat there for a moment. I listened. Wishing, really wishing, that I could believe my own lie.

\*\*

I could barely work that day, and after a few hours of half-hearted email-sorting and responding to IM’s, I had accepted that the events of the night before rendered me useless. I put myself in offline-mode and sent a message to my team that I would be out the rest of the day and shut my laptop.

Win was running around like nothing happened. After she woke up, I made her pancakes and set them for her at the table. I watched her eat them, the TV in the living room blaring an old Disney musical, while I drank my coffee. Questions surging up my tongue were begging to come out.

*‘Do you remember anything weird about last night?*’

*‘Why did you fall asleep in the closet?’*

*‘Was there something in there with you?’*

What stopped me was the joy, the gleeful nonchalance Win greeted everyday with. Her abandon and her spirit, soaring up as soon as she was, buzzed from the sugary syrup. I let her out into the backyard where she ran to her soccer ball, kicking it between the trees. I watched her from the back door, drinking cup after cup of coffee.

I wished I could have her energy. Her fearlessness. I wished I could have gotten away with drinking something stronger than coffee.

Surely, I reasoned with myself, if she had seen anything – if there had actually been anything there, in the room with us, Win would have remembered. The girl could see a caterpillar on the sidewalk in the morning and talk about it all the way until bedtime, until the next day even, urging us to walk back to where she’d seen it crawling a full day before to see if it was still there.

Which meant if she had seen something, if she had seen what I’d seen, she would have said something.

Right?

Unless, I thought, she couldn’t see it. Unless what had been in her bed that night had just been for me.

I shook my head, trying to upend the thoughts souring my mind, like I could loose them out of my ears. This was a new house, a new space, and I was filling it with my fear as much as we had filled it with our wonder, with our joy and our hope. There wasn’t anything else here with us. It was just an old, creepy house and I – this man who had spent his whole life in the suburbs and the city and considered a two-bedroom apartment just over a thousand square feet a living luxury – just wasn’t used to what dwelling in a place like this meant.

Yeah. That was it.

It had to be.

I almost lost myself in watching her, in the peace that was filling in the morning, when I remembered the toy. The doll. The little girl.

I walked away from the back door, hurrying over to where I had thrown the thing the night before. Shoving the couch back, wincing as it screeched along the hardwood floor. Flicking open the flashlight on my phone to look into the dark of the corner.

I half expected it to be gone. To be a figment, a little resident of a night I was so dearly hoping had been a dream.

But it wasn’t gone. It was exactly where I had left it: facedown in the gathering dust under the couch.

I bent to pick it up. God, it was still cold. A kind of chill in its fibers that made me think it was wet. But, as I brought it out of the dark, I ran my thumb across the stiches of the thing’s dress – they were dry. Coarse, rough like a raw rope.

I looked through the kitchen to make sure Win was occupied and happy – she was, kicking the ball and weaving in and out of the old trees back there. I bounded up the stairs, taking them two at a time, almost running to her room.

I stopped in the doorway.

Her blankets were bunched up on the bed, just as they had been the night before. In the light of morning, they seemed a harmless pile. Her comforter and sheets, wound up in a conical shape. It had been so dark the night before – was it so far fetched to assume I had dreamed up the whole thing? That maybe I had heard Win talking in her sleep and given her voice to the shape in the bed instead of the girl in the nook?

I saw Milkshake’s tail, poking out from between the blanketed folds. I reached for it, pulling it free. It was still so cold, despite spending the night buried in the blanket. I had a thought then to rip it open, Milkshake and the girl both, and see what the hell was inside. What gave them such a chill.

I felt it again then – that same prickling from being watched. I turned, slowly, expecting, *hoping* to see Win in the doorway: watching me. Imagining her devastated little face as I took her new toys; because that was what I was doing, I was sure now. I was taking them and I was going to destroy them.

Burn them, maybe. Warm them up.

But Win wasn’t in the doorway. It was empty, but I heard –

The soft shriek of hinges. The click of a latch.

I whipped toward the nook.

You know that feeling when something flickers at the edge of your vision—when you’re sure it’s there, but the moment you turn your head you catch only the briefest trace? I read once that it’s your mind filling in the gaps, a leftover instinct from our lizard brains—priming you to run before you even know what you’ve seen.

The toybox was there. Blacker than the shadows around it. Waiting.

I stepped inside, frowning as I did. The air in the nook was near freezing. Not normal cold – this was deep, cellar-cold. It made the hair on my arms stand on end.

Upstairs rooms don’t feel like that. Heat rises.

I knelt, flipping open my phone and switching on the flashlight. Shadows danced as I pressed my palm along the baseboards, searching for a draft, a crack. Some rend in the wall, some reason the space could be this chilled. Nothing. My hand rose higher. The cold sharpened near my face, like an invisible seam slicing through the air.

I followed it. Fingers outstretched. They touched something solid. Hard.

The toybox.

I slid my hand along its lid until I found the seam. The cold seeped out there, steady and unnatural.

I gripped the edge. Pulled.

Nothing.

I squatted, planted my feet, and hauled upward with all my weight. The lid didn’t shudder. It might as well have been nailed shut – or part of the floor itself.

I pressed my ear close. A faint hum trembled through the wood—distant and hollow, like something shifting deep – somewhere in the house.

I staggered back, breath fogging. My flashlight trembled.

It must have been a trick of the light. That’s what I told myself. Because the shadow beneath the toybox… it wasn’t thinning as I stared. It looked deeper. Farther away.

I reached out, slowly. My hand hovered over the crack of the lid.

Of the mouth.

For a split second, I thought it wouldn’t stop. That I’d just keep reaching, shoulder-deep, swallowed whole inside the solid square of black.

Instead, my fingers hit wood.

I jerked back.

“That’s all you are,” I whispered. “Just a trick of the dark.”

I stood up, walking quickly out of Win’s room. Hurrying down the stairs. Wanting very, very much to be out in the sunlight with my girl.

Because, for a sliver of a moment? I’d thought my hand wouldn’t touch that glistening wood. I thought it would go on and on. Stretching backwards into a space I would have to crawl into, I would have to push myself through, to find the end of.

It was impossible, I thought. My sleep-weak mind playing with me. Showing me something that simply could not be.

I set Milkshake and the doll down on the counter, hiding them behind a glass container of dried pasta so Win wouldn’t see. Resolving, promising, myself that as soon as Jess was home tomorrow to distract our girl I would take the knit little fucks out back, behind the shed.

And burn them.

\*\*

I woke up with a shudder, groggy and weightless, like I’d been held underwater. The edges of a dream slipping away from me. One in which my daughter held me, in which was staring down at me.

In the dream I couldn’t breathe.

I blinked, looking around our room in the dark. Taking in several deep, shuddering breaths. As the sleep and the dream drained out of me, I found the uneven shadows from all our half-unpacked belongings scattered around our bed a comfort. That was a kind of mess, the remnants of our shuffled life, was at least ours. It made sense. I could feel Jess’s legs pressed against me, her back turned, her form under the blanket rising and falling with silent sleeping.

My eyes caught something in the gloom.

\*CLICK\*

I squinted, leaning forward in the dark.

Another *click.* Sharp. Hollow. Rhythmic.

I turned my head toward the doorway. My heart quickened.

Win stood there.

Barefoot. Motionless. Her face lost in shadow.

*CLICK. CLICK. CLICK.*

The sound was coming from her.

I swallowed. “Win?”

She didn’t move.

Jess stirred slightly beside me but didn’t wake.

“Baby?” My voice was low. Careful. I sat up, feet on the floor.

*CLICK. CLICK. CLICK.*

Her jaw. I saw it now, lit from the moonlight pouring from the hallway window. Her mouth opening and shutting, teeth meeting teeth, each clack sharp in the quiet.

I reached for the lamp on my nightstand.

The room exploded in light.

Win was staring right at me.

She didn’t blink. Didn’t speak. Just stood there in her pajamas, her hair wild from sleep, eyes wide and glassy in the glow, *CLICK CLICK CLICK*, her teeth snapping together – hard, sharp and insistent.

My breath caught.

“Sweetheart,” I said softly, standing, “come here.”

She didn’t move.

I stepped to her in three quick strides, crouching to her level. She tilted her head up at me, never breaking that awful rhythm. *CLICK. CLICK. CLICK.*

Her bottom lip trembled, but she didn’t cry. Didn’t say anything at all.

“Win,” I whispered, “does it hurt?”

Her eyes shot to me. Wide, glistening.

Then, slowly, she opened her mouth wider.

One of her bottom teeth teetered, loose and pale in the light, hanging by the root. A pale little pearl.

*CLICK.*                                                                                                                                                

There was no blood.

*CLICK.*

I reached out, my fingers shaking, and brushed it gently. It tipped sideways in her gums.

“Teef dad-gdy,” she said through her gaping mouth, her throat and tongue working to make the words with a wide-open jaw, “my teef.”

“Jesus,” I murmured. “Okay, honey. Okay.”

She just kept staring, mouth half-open, teeth clicking together, even as I scooped her up and carried her back toward her room.

Her jaw worked the whole way.

*CLICK. CLICK. CLICK.*

I laid her down in her bed, her eyes fluttering half-way closed. Resting her head on her pillow. Her mouth worked, opening and closing, as I stuck my fingers inside.

“Hold on honey,” I said, feeling her close her jaw, her tongue slithering away from my thumb, “let me get it.”

There was almost no resistance as I pulled the thing out. As soon as I did, Win’s head relaxed against the pillow, her fluttering eyes twitching shut. She started breathing, heavy, as I leaned back from her bed. Looking at the boney little pebble in my hand.

Looking at my girl, already asleep in her bed.

She was three, halfway to four. I hadn’t prepared myself to even think of when she would start losing teeth but…at her age?

It seemed wrong. Kids don’t lose teeth this young, I thought. Not unless something’s pulling at them.

*Click*.

There was a different sort of sound, a different sort of hollow snap. And it from behind me.

I jumped, turning in the dark of Win’s room.

Toward the nook.

And I felt the temperature shift – a putrid gust. Just a gash of air.

I stared down at the tooth again in my palm. Maybe it was all in my mind, or maybe it was the snap of air from the nook. But I knew what I felt.

The tooth, in my palm, was cooling. Feeling more and more like a little chip of ice. Bloodless, too tiny, and dry. I squeezed my hand shut over it, watching Win’s small chest rising and falling. The breeze from the nook brushed the back of my neck, cold and sour.

And I wondered with a twist in my heart – what if she’s not losing her teeth?

What if they’re being taken?
