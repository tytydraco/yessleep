I spent last summer working night shift at the Cheap Sleep Motel. A dingy place in the middle of nowhere with nothing around it for miles. At the time I really needed the money. It had ten rooms and was laid out as an L-shaped single storey accommodation. The Welcome Office where I spent most of my shift was next to the bottom right of the L. 



Cheap Sleep Motel offered amenities such as a coin operated washer/dryer, vending machines with expired goods and a swimming pool behind the long part of the L that could not possibly have met health and safety regulations. My job was to sit behind the front desk and check any customers in. There were other menial aspects of the job too but mostly I sat on my ass and watched terrible shows on a mini TV on the desk. The odd night provided entertainment with couples fighting, people having obvious affairs or some very unsavoury characters coming their visits almost always preceding a visit from the police looking for them. Most customers were middle-aged men who reeked of loneliness. If I had been a good-looking girl I’d have been nervous working that job. I wasn’t. I hadn’t needed a mirror to tell me that. The mocking laughter of other girls throughout high school, the unmasked revulsion from boys … I was ugly and that was that.



One night only a few hours into my shift, around midnight, they arrived. A leviathan of a truck pulled into the parking lot like some giant sea creature in the ocean of black night. Its glaring bright eyes blasted into the Welcome Office where I sat watching trash on TV and stuffing crap down my throat. I felt my podgy body vibrate at the guttural growl of the vehicle’s rumbling engine. The headlights went off and the engine cut out, I remember being relieved as I started to worry the noise would wake guests who’d inevitably yell at me as if it was my damn truck. The parking lot was sparsely lit by temperamental tall lamps emitting dim white light in patches. Most of the place was in darkness. A seedy red light buzzed on and off in an indiscernible sequence illuminating the entire parking lot when it was on. It was the neon sign for the motel that caused this.



He climbed out of the driver’s cabin and into that flashing crimson light. A giant with a white baseball cap and dark scraggly beard. He fit the trucker stereotype aesthetically. Instead of heading towards the office he stepped around the front of his steel beast. Even with the big man beside it, he looked freakishly close to seven feet tall, the truck was monstrous. What the hell was he transporting? The driver opened the passenger side door and assisted a second person down. Even at a distance and in awkward lighting it was clear that she was beautiful. 



Tall leather boots and denim shorts with lots of slender legs between. A pink short-sleeved shirt playfully tied up to reveal an utterly flat belly. Her face was precisely what TV, movies and magazines told every woman they should be. A defined yet delicate chin, puffy yet sleek lips, a nose that was not large nor small, clear cheekbones and large mesmerizing purple eyes. Her golden hair was full of volume and looked as if she had just emerged from a salon. God I instantly hated her.



The pair entered the Welcome Office tingling the annoying bell. In better lighting, up close the woman was exceptionally more beautiful. She smiled softly and walked with unassuming confidence. In contrast the man for all his size looked weary with thick dark bags lining his bloodshot eyes. He was dishevelled and moved like a man on the brink of collapse. 



“Good evening.” I said as was required of me. My voice was raspy and dry.



“Hi there darling!” The woman said with incredible energy and authenticity. Her teeth were pearl white and her voice exotic in sound yet eloquent. “How are you getting on tonight?”



I was temporarily stunned. In all the months I’d worked at the Motel until now I’m certain no other guest had asked me that.



“Fine … I suppose. How are you ma’am?” I responded.



“I’m doing fine too!” The woman replied. “Excuse Big Dan, he's awfully tired from the road.” I looked to the large man and was struck suddenly by something strange. Behind the beard and under the hat worn low Big Dan looked incredibly young. Early twenties for sure.“ You got any coffee?” He asked. His voice too was youthful although gruff with weariness.



“Yeah.” I said and pointed in the corner. “The machine is free for guests.”



“Isn’t that wonderful dear? Free for guests!” The woman said with extreme delight that the aged coffee machine did not warrant. “I’ll check us in and you go and top up.”



Big Dan marched over to the machine, pressed the faded buttons and it clunked to life.



“One room for one night please … Amy.” The woman looked at my name tag. My teal work polo shirt was covered in crumbs and bulged awkwardly around my mass. Why wasn’t she looking down at me like all the others did? There was no hint of disdain in those purple eyes, no sarcasm in her kind voice.



“No problem. If you can sign in the ledger and provide some ID it’s forty five dollars for the night.” I said mechanically as I had many times before. 



“Sure thing.” The woman reached into her pocket and fished out a thick wad of cash. I looked over and saw Big Dan guzzle down his hot coffee like he was dying of thirst. He placed the paper cup back in the machine and pressed it for more.



“I’m Aurelia and that’s Big Dan.” She placed ten twenty dollar bills on the desk in front of me. “Is that okay with you sweetheart?”



It wasn’t the first time I’d let the ID rule slide and like I sat at the time I was desperate for cash. And so Aurelia and Dan Smith received the key Room number 2. Big Dan polished off a third cup of coffee somewhat counterintuitively before bed before Aurelia called him over. 



The beautiful woman gave me a heartfelt thanks before they exited out and into the night. If I had refused the bribe and demanded their ID I often wonder how differently that night might have turned out. Would then have simply left, carried on to the next motel and left us all alone? I don’t know but I cannot change the past.



Something happened to my little TV. It was only after the strange pair had left and I filled in their paperwork with lies - the hundred and fifty change sitting nicely in my pocket - that I noticed it. At first I thought I’d accidentally switched over to a weird late night psychedelic channel. It was like looking into a kaleidoscope toy, whirling shapes of purple and blue moved in a mesmerizing pattern. A low, quiet but immensely pleasant hum accompanied the strange imagery. It was a very meditative experience to watch and listen. 



I stared into the swirling pattern, listening to that nice sound for God knows how long until I finally tried changing the channel. What had previously shown reality shows now also displayed the patterns and played the sound. Every channel did. Again I found myself staring unblinking into the pattern. Suddenly the deskphone rang out and tore me from the mindless stupor. The flashing light on the phone showed it was Room 5 calling. Long-term Louie. A short, irritable, bald and recently divorce man who’d paid a month up front. His semi-permanence convinced him he was entitled to a level of service a place called Cheap Sleep Motel was never going to provide. 



His grating voice entered my ear through the receiver. He bitched about his TV acting up, describing exactly what I was seeing on my TV. Unsure what the hell he was expecting me to do about it I relented and agreed to go over to check in person. Otherwise he was liable to march over and give me a lecture or make a complaint to my boss in the morning. Prick.



I locked the Welcome Office door per policy and headed over to Room 5. I walked past the giant truck on my way there. Its exhausts reached up high and ended sharp as if they were horns for the beast. The sleeper cabin portion of the front was enormous, a decent living space was likely inside. Travelling for days on end must be brutal and I understood why they’d want to spend a night in a real bed, even one at a cheap motel. There was no signage on the cab or trailer and both were painted pure black. I saw there were vents lining the top of the trailer on the driver’s side and in the unreliable red light I saw liquid dribbling out of each vent leaving the trailer’s exterior viscous and glistening. 



At the time I wondered if Big Dan was hauling meats or some such but couldn’t fathom what would require ventilation and produce the strange slime. I looked at the back of the trailer and saw it was covered in locks at least half a dozen. All looked thick and impossible to force or cut. Some required number codes but most required keys of varying size. Something very valuable lay within that trailer. Something very valuable indeed.



Long-term Louie opened the door to Room 5 after I barely knocked it once. This asshole was the main source of all my issues at work this summer.



“Finally!” He hissed like a sweating, chubby snake. His grey dressing gown and slippers served to make me as uncomfortable as possible and made him look more reptile than man. “Fix it then!” He said and turned his back to me.



 He sat himself on the room’s double bed with his arms crossed. No wonder the dickhead was divorced. My trust taser sat in my pocket and I patted it assuredly as I entered. He hadn’t given me any of that kind of trouble before but I secretly wished for an excuse to electrify the asshat. Every room at Cheap Sleep was identical. Well-worn double bed with faded basic coverings, a weirdly positioned chair that faced the bed and a cheap wall-mounted TV. Rotting wooden drawers and eternally squeaky cupboards completed the dilapidated theme the designers were going for. A white door led to the equally depressing bathroom. 



Sure enough the kaleidoscopic pattern was on Louie’s TV and it played that pleasant hum. I made a token effort of fiddling with the remote and inspecting the wiring around the TV for long enough to at least give the impression I was trying to help the asshole. When I was close to trying to just leave Louie stood up and opened his blinds. Each room had a window that looked out at the parking lot and one out the rear. Room 5 looked out back onto the pool area. It was a warm night and for some incomprehensible reason Louie didn’t have his AC on. He seemed to like to stew in his own sweat and filth. 



He mumbled complaints at my incompetence and opened the rear window allowing more hot air to enter. As he got up I noticed the roll of tissues and tub of moisturiser sitting on his bedside table. His late night TV watching that had been interrupted made me taste bile. 



Then Louie audibly gasped. He was staring dumbfounded out the window. While he was distracted I ‘solved’ the TV problem by unplugging it. The images and sounds did not stop … Not only that I was convinced the humming was getting louder, pressing the volume buttons did nothing to change that. Also the visuals seemed suddenly more stimulating. My whole body tingled in response to the dual sensory exposure. It felt good. 



Louie still stood staring outside so I decided to see what had elicited that reaction from him. Standing on the low diving board of the pool, dripping wet was Aurelia. Her hair was slicked back and soaked and she wore a perfectly form fitting dark one-piece swimsuit. She was practically inhuman. She was plucked from the realm of male fantasy and dropped into this grimy motel. My vision was off. It was like when you stare at something on screen for too long and when you look away the image remains superimposed. The purple patterns were overlaid with Aurelia on that diving board. The spinning patterns flowed around her body, matching the rhythm of her slight bounces on the board. Her breasts giggled seductively before she launched up into the air. It seemed she hung there mid-air for several seconds blessing me and Louie with her magnificent visage before finally plummeting into the water with only a slight splash.



“Thanks for your help Laurey.” Louie said getting my name wrong again. He looked at me then and his expression of glee was wiped when he saw me instead of the goddess outside. It must have been like beauty whiplash to him. “Forget about the TV, I'm suddenly in the mood for a midnight dip.”



He all but shoved me out the room before slamming the door behind me. The pattern had now left my vision but had been replaced with the image of Aurelia mid-jump. I rubbed my eyes fiercely but the image remained burned into my retinas.



I tossed the little TV into the Welcome Office storage closet - it too kept working when I tried to unplug it. I hoped the other guests wouldn’t start calling up in sequence to complain, that made me guess not all the TVs had been affected. With my primary passtime decommissioned I fished out one of the emergency books I always kept in my backpack. It was pulpy romantic nonsense but served its purpose.



Around thirty minutes since visiting Room 5 I sat reading until a noise from outside caught my attention. Giggling. In the flickering red light I first spotted Aurelia still wearing her one-piece swimsuit, barefoot and trailing water behind her. Louie followed her, his hand in hers, with her leading him across the parking lot towards the big black truck. He was similarly soaking and wore a god awful blue speedo. I thought I was hallucinating. Why the hell would someone like her even be touching a gross fatso like him. Aurelia unlocked the sleeper cabin door with a key and climbed inside with Louie clambering in after her like a hungry dog. The cabin door shut behind him.



I stared out at the dark truck but could see nothing of the interior. Was that woman mad? Maybe sex-crazed or simply a hooker? I speculated but could not reach a satisfying answer. What hooker travels around with a Trucker especially looking as perfect as she did? I had a cup of tar-like but free coffee and kept an eye on the truck. About five minutes later the cabin door opened and Aurelia dropped out alone and locked the door behind her. Where the hell was Louie? The woman looked directly at me, her purple eyes seeming to glow in the darkness, and she gave me a friendly wave.
