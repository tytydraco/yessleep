 I didn’t plan it. Not really.

I told myself I had, stuffed granola bars and an old hoodie into my school bag like I was preparing for some noble quest. But all it took was one fight—just one more screaming match with my mom—and I was out the door before she could even finish cursing me out.

It was getting dark when I reached the edge of the woods behind the old quarry. I knew the trails well enough in daylight. I knew where the kids went to sneak cigarettes, where the creek split into two, and where the trees got so thick you could pretend the rest of the world didn’t exist.

But that was daytime. Now, everything looked wrong. Bigger. Quieter. Like the trees were holding their breath.

I didn’t stop walking. I couldn’t. If I stopped, I’d start thinking about how my phone was dead, how I didn’t even have a flashlight, how I didn’t have anywhere else to go.

I wasn’t scared, though. Not really. Not yet.

I was angry. Angry enough to sleep in the dirt if it meant I didn’t have to hear her say, “I never wanted you” one more time. Angry enough to believe I could survive on spite and stolen protein bars.

The moon came out sometime after I found a fallen log to lean against. It wasn’t much shelter, but it kept the wind off my back. I tried to sleep. I closed my eyes and listened to the rustle of leaves and the high-pitched whine of something small flying too close to my ear. I was almost out when I heard it.

Crying.

It was really soft at first. It was high, wet, and broken, not like a person, but not like any animal I knew. It was just… miserable.

I sat up, my heart knocking against my ribs. Tried to tell myself it was just a raccoon or a fox. Something that got hurt, maybe. I should’ve left it alone. That’s what normal people do when they hear weird noises in the woods.

But I wasn’t thinking clearly. I was tired and angry and just stupid enough to care.

So I followed it.

It didn’t run right away. I saw it out of the corner of my eye—low to the ground, pale and wrinkled, shaped like a sad, soggy pig with too many folds in its skin. Its eyes were huge and round and leaking constantly. Not blinking. Just leaking. It looked like someone had taken every bad dream I ever had and sculpted them into a body.

I should’ve been afraid. Should’ve turned around.

But instead, I whispered, “Hey, you okay?”

The thing flinched and started waddling away, sobbing louder now. But it kept looking back like it wanted me to follow.

And God help me, I did.

-----------------------------------------------

It didn’t move fast.

Every few feet, it stopped and looked back at me, those swollen, weeping eyes glinting in the moonlight like wet marbles. It made this pitiful wheezing noise like each sob was scraping something raw inside its throat. It whimpered louder whenever I thought about turning back as if it could feel me hesitating.

I don’t know why I kept following. Maybe it looked like it needed someone, and I wanted to be needed by something—even if that something looked like a nightmare wrapped in wet laundry.

The path under my sneakers turned soft and muddy. The trees pressed tighter around us, thick with vines and moss, like we’d stepped through some invisible veil and into a version of the woods that didn’t belong on any map. I swear the air even changed—it got warmer but heavier. Wet, like breathing through a sponge.

“You got a name?” I muttered, half to myself, half to the thing before me.

It paused again, hunched over like it was waiting. Its sides expanded and collapsed with each wheezy breath. It didn’t answer, obviously, but somehow the silence felt… expectant.

I shrugged off my pack and pulled out a smashed granola bar, still mostly sealed. I knelt and held it out.

“Here. You sound like you could use this more than me.”

It sniffed and shuffled closer. Up close, it smelled like mushrooms and rain-soaked paper. Its mouth was small and cracked at the edges, and it didn't so much eat the granola bar as let it dissolve on its tongue, drooling sticky crumbs down its chin.

“Gross,” I whispered, but I didn’t pull away.

When it finished, it curled in on itself for a moment, then slowly turned and kept walking. It didn’t cry this time. Not loudly, anyway. Just a soft, rhythmic snuffling. Like it was humming. Leading me.

I kept telling myself I’d only follow it for a little longer. Just see where it was going. I’d turn around once I hit a clearing, stream, or anything familiar.

But the woods didn’t give me any of that.

Just more trees. More dark. More strange.

After a while, I stopped trying to keep track of where we were. I was too tired. My legs ached, and my breath came out in misty clouds even though the air didn’t feel cold anymore.

“How far are we going?” I asked, rubbing my eyes.

The small sad creature let out a long, low whimper. It stopped and turned toward me again. This time, it didn’t look away. Its eyes locked on mine. Sad. Endless.

And then, without warning, it nudged its wet, sagging face against my leg.

I froze.

It wasn’t aggressive. Just… desperate. Affectionate, almost. Like a dog that’d forgotten what kindness felt like. I stood there for a second, awkwardly reaching down to touch its head. Its skin was warm and oddly soft, like half-rotten fruit.

“I’m not staying out here forever,” I said like I was trying to convince both of us. “I just needed to get away for a while. That’s all.”

The creature made a soft chirring noise. It felt almost approving.

And then it started walking again, this time with a little more energy in its step. It was still slow, still sniffling, but… purposeful. Like it knew we were close now.

I followed, chewing my lip, trying to ignore how the trees around us didn’t look like the ones near the quarry anymore. Their bark was slick and mottled, some trunks splitting open like gills. Everything smelled like wet dirt and something sour.

Eventually, the ground dipped—just a little—and I realized we were heading into some kind of natural basin, ringed with rocks and thick roots coiled like veins. The creature paused at the edge and let out a long, trembling sob, its whole body shaking.

It didn’t go any farther.

It just turned and looked at me.

And waited.

-----------------------------------------------

The creature didn’t follow me into the basin.

It just sat at the edge, sobbing louder now—no longer sad, but almost… triumphant. Proud. Like its part was done.

I turned to look at it, and I swear I saw something behind its eyes for a split second. Not intelligence. Not exactly. Just awareness. Like a flashlight flickering on in the back of an empty room.

It blinked slowly and then didn’t move again.

I should’ve left right then.

Instead, I stepped down into the basin.

The air changed the moment I crossed the edge. It got warmer and heavier. Like I’d walked into a greenhouse filled with sweat and rotting meat. The ground wasn’t dirt anymore—it was soft, springy, and covered in thick moss that squished wet under my shoes. Something slurped when I stepped on it, and I told myself it was just mud.

But I knew it wasn’t.

There was a smell, too. Not just decay—though that was part of it. It was sweeter. Like rotting fruit left out too long. Sickly. Thick. I could taste it on the back of my tongue.

That’s when I saw it.

At first, I thought it was just a hill. A big lump of moss and roots in the center of the clearing. But then it twitched. Just once.

I froze.

Then it moved again—slow and deliberate—unfolding like something that had been sleeping too long. Layers of flesh peeled back, revealing muscle, veins, and pale folds that glistened like wet petals. The shape of it didn’t make sense. No symmetry. Just bulk. Chunks of tissue slumped against the ground, anchored by thick tendrils that burrowed into the earth. Veins the size of tree branches pulsed under translucent skin.

And everywhere—everywhere—were mouths.

Tiny ones. Huge ones. Rows of human-looking teeth grinning through torn skin. Some chomped at the air lazily. Others just… smiled.

I heard breathing, but not from me. From her.

That’s when the voice slipped into my mind.

“There you are.”

It wasn’t sound. It was inside me—curling through my thoughts like smoke.

I took a step back.

“Who—what—” My throat locked up.

“You poor thing.” Her voice was soft. Gentle. “You’ve been hurting for so long.”

“No,” I said out loud. “No, I didn’t mean—this isn’t—I didn’t come here for you.”

“But you did. You came because you were hurting. You came because no one else saw you. No one else loved you.”

My knees almost gave out. I could feel something buzzing in my skull. Like my thoughts weren’t mine anymore. Like they were being… tasted.

One of the larger mouths peeled open. Slowly. Wetly. Inside, it wasn’t a throat—it was a tunnel lined with soft, twitching fronds and teeth that moved in waves like they were eager.

Another limb unfolded beside it. Not an arm. Not a leg. Just… mass. Boneless and long, slick and twitching. It reached out like it wanted to hold me.

“I can give you peace,” she whispered. “You don’t have to fight anymore. I’ll never yell at you. I’ll never leave you.”

The smell got worse, like blood and sugar and old milk.

I gagged.

Something warm wrapped around my ankle—soft and slow. Not grabbing. Just encouraging.

“Let me take care of you. Just for a little while.”

My vision blurred. My chest tightened. All I could think was: this is what love looks like to her.

A hundred mouths smiled.

Somewhere far behind me, the Squonk let out a whimper that sounded like a lullaby.

And something inside me cracked.

I screamed.

I don’t remember deciding to run. My body just took over. I turned and bolted, tearing my ankle free. I felt something tear—either in me or it—and I didn’t care. I scrambled back up the side of the basin, dirt and moss flying behind me.

The creature squealed when I passed it, shrill and sharp. Like it was shocked I’d run. Like I was ungrateful.

I didn’t look back.

Her voice echoed in my skull as I ran—calm, constant, cooing.

“It’s okay. You’ll come back. They always do. My sweet, sorrowful thing.”

The forest didn’t fight me this time. I didn’t even notice the thorns or the branches whipping at my face. I just kept running until I couldn’t smell her anymore. Until the air felt real again. Until the sky started to pale and the birds began to sing.

I collapsed at the edge of the quarry, gasping, shaking, sobbing into the dirt like a little kid.

And behind me, deep in the woods, something breathed.

-----------------------------------------------

I don’t remember getting home.

Bits and pieces come back—stumbling into the road, some trucker stopping, asking too many questions I didn’t answer. Someone called my mom. She cried when she picked me up. Screamed too. The kind of sob scream that hits from the gut. Like she was scared.

I didn’t say much. Couldn’t.

They took me to the ER. I had a sprained ankle, a mild concussion, and some dehydration. I got antibiotics for a scratch that had already started to turn green around the edges.

I lied and said I slipped into a ravine. I didn’t even bother to make it sound believable. No one pushed too hard.

The thing is, I got away.

I should be fine.

But I’m not.

I haven’t slept a whole night since I came back. Not really. I drift off for an hour or two, but I always wake up sweating, breath caught in my throat. Some nights I hear crying outside my window. Soft. High-pitched. Familiar. Like something small is waiting for me.

I don’t look.

During the day, I hear things—quiet things. Breathing where there shouldn't be any. Little wet mouth sounds. The creak of something shifting beneath the floorboards. It’s never loud. It’s never obvious.

But it’s always there.

I stopped eating meat. Can’t stomach it. Especially anything with bones. Too close. Too real.

And sometimes—just sometimes—when I’m alone, and it’s really quiet, I still hear her voice. Not loud. Not commanding. Just… whispering.

“I miss you.”

My mom’s been trying. I’ll give her that. She started asking questions—real ones, not just the surface-level crap. She even made dinner the other night and tried to talk to me like I wasn’t made of glass.

But it’s hard. There’s this distance now. Like something inside me got rewired. I want to forgive her. I really do. But there’s a part of me—something coiled up in the center of my chest—that still hears Mother.

“She’ll never understand you the way I do.”

I think she left something in me.

Or took something out.

Either way, I’m not the same. I keep catching myself looking at the tree line behind the house. Just… looking.

Waiting.

And tonight? Tonight, I swear I saw something standing between the trees. Small. Wrinkled. Crying.

Waiting too.

-----------------------------------------------

It’s been three weeks.

The woods haven’t changed, but I have. I feel it every time I pass a mirror—like something’s sitting just beneath my skin, watching the world through me. Waiting.

I’ve stopped talking about what happened. People just nod now, offer tight smiles, and say things like, “You’re lucky to be alive.”

But sometimes I wonder if I am.

The crying hasn’t stopped. Every few nights, it’s there again. At the edge of the yard. In the trees. Behind my window.

I saw it last night.

That small miserable creature.

It looked… worse. Like it was melting. Sagging lower. Weeping harder. But it still looked at me the same way. Like it knew me. Like it was asking me to follow.

I didn’t. Not yet.

But I opened the window.

And that’s when I heard her again.

“You’re tired,” she said. So soft, I almost mistook it for my own thoughts.

“They don’t understand what you’ve been through. But I do. I always will.”

My chest tightened. Not with fear—with relief.

Because she was right.

I walk around this house like a ghost. My mom tries, but every time she hugs me, I flinch. Whenever she says, “I’m glad you’re home,” I feel like I’m lying.

I left something behind in those woods. Or something followed me out.

And Mother… she hasn’t stopped calling.

“You are mine, little sorrow. You were born from pain, shaped by silence. Let me give you peace.”

I think she’s always been there. Under the trees. Beneath the earth. She doesn’t hunt. She waits. Waits for kids like me—lonely, broken things who slip through the cracks. Who go missing and don’t come back.

Or worse… do.

She feeds on despair. Grows stronger in the quiet parts of the world where no one listens.

But she also loves us in her own way.

I don’t know what I’ll do next.

But I’ve been dreaming of the basin again. Of the mouths. The warmth. That voice wrapping around me like a blanket soaked in honey and blood.

And last night, I dreamed of her teeth.

Not sharp.

Welcoming.

“Come home.”

I haven’t gone back.

Yet.

But the woods are always there. And she’s still waiting.

And honestly?

Some nights, I think I might.

Because at least something out there wants me.
