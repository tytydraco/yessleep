*H*ey mom, I’m following up on my many missed calls and messages from you. Don’t worry, I'm completely fine. Sorry for all of this. I wanted to let you know that I’ve moved in with Jason in his new home. It’s a fresh start for me and I couldn’t be more excited.

*E*mily is with me and she’s still as cute as a button. She can make more friends here at her new school that we enrolled her in.

*L*ately, I’ve been thinking about getting her a new sibling. It was Jason’s idea and I’m all for it.

*P*erhaps, we won’t see you for a while since Jason is so busy with work. Our new home is still not suitable for guests yet, it needs a long time to be presentable and tidy, just how you like things mom.

*W*e wanted to let you know, all of us here, that we appreciate your recent concern but honestly things couldn’t be better,

*E*xpecting video calls from us though will be hard, since our coverage here is bad and we won’t be able to get a stable connection.

*I*t’s sweet that you asked me what happened to my face in your messages, I’m just such a goofball I was actually reaching for a big box when moving and it fell on my face. 

*N*o need to come visit us any time soon, as I said Jason is busy and we’re still in the process of moving, but when you do plan to, please contact Jason first. 

*H*e loves you guys and just wants to get everything in order for when you finally see us.

*I* saw that you filed a missing person report for me and Emily. Please let the authorities know that you heard from us and we’re okay.

*S*oon, Jason is planning to take us on a trip. I don’t know where yet, but I’m letting you know as I probably won’t be able to contact you.

*B*est way to get to me right now is via email. As Jason took my phone to get it repaired. I broke the screen when the box fell on me.

*A*lso, can you please tell everyone this too? I can only send you an email from Jason’s laptop. I don’t* have the time to email everyone.

*S*omeone from work reached out to me too. I told them that I quit and apologized for not getting my notice in.

*E*vidently, that was unprofessional of me. Jason can support us for now, he’s doing really well.

*M*aybe I’ll stay at home for the time being, since Jason prefers I take care of Emily and I agree.

*E*mily sends her love to you. She misses her grandma and knows that she can’t see her soon, but still loves her so much.

*N*ot wanting to ramble on, I wanted to conclude by giving you Jason’s number. Make sure to call him first before doing anything related to seeing us (1-212-846-7824).

*T*hank you for reaching out. I’m going to get back to fixing up the house now. Love you Mom.
