I found the thread by accident.

It was buried deep in a comment chain on r/AskReddit, one of those posts that barely gets any traction. No awards. No upvotes worth mentioning. The title alone should have tipped me off.

“Do NOT let Santa inside your house this Christmas.”

I assumed it was a joke. Someone trying to be edgy without committing to it. I almost scrolled past it, but curiosity got me.

The original post was short.

“If you hear knocking on Christmas Eve, do not open the door unless you personally invited someone.

Santa does not knock.

Santa does not wait.

And Santa does not ask to come inside."

The comments were worse.

Most people were mocking it, calling it cringe, saying it was trying too hard. But scattered between the jokes were replies that felt wrong. Too serious. Too specific.

One user wrote:

“He will sound polite at first.  
He will use your name if he knows it.  
Do not respond. Do not acknowledge him.  
That is how he gets permission."

Another comment said:

“If you look at him through a window, do not let him see you see him."

That one stuck with me.

I laughed it off. Closed the app. Forgot about it completely.

Until Christmas Eve.

I live alone in a small duplex. No kids. No family nearby. Christmas is usually quiet. Netflix, takeout, bed early. Around 11:40 PM, I was half asleep on the couch when I heard the knock.

Three slow taps.

Not loud. Not aggressive. Just enough to make sure I noticed.

I froze.

Nobody visits me. Especially not that late. I checked my phone. No texts. No missed calls. The knock came again.

Three taps.

Then a voice.

Soft. Cheerful. Close to the door.

“Hey there. I just need a moment of your time."

My stomach dropped.

I do not know why my brain went straight to that Reddit thread, but it did. Instantly. Like my body recognized something my mind had not caught up to yet.

I stayed silent.

The voice chuckled lightly.

“It is alright. I know you are home."

My heart started pounding so hard it felt loud in my ears. I slowly stood up and moved toward the hallway mirror, where I could see part of the front door without being directly in front of it.

That is when I noticed something else.

The security camera app on my phone had sent a notification.

Motion detected: Front Door.

With shaking hands, I opened the live feed.

The camera showed my porch.

And him.

He was tall. Too tall. His head nearly brushed the top of the doorframe. He wore red, but it was not bright. It was dark, like old fabric soaked too many times.

His face was mostly shadowed by the hat, but I could see his smile.

It was stretched. Unmoving.

His eyes were fixed directly on the camera.

On me.

“I do not like being ignored," he said gently. “It is rude."

I dropped the phone.

The knocking stopped.

For a moment, everything was silent.

Then I heard movement.

Above me.

Something heavy shifted on the roof, slow and deliberate, like claws dragging across shingles. I backed away, barely breathing.

From above my head, his voice drifted down through the ceiling.

“I can wait,” he said.  
“I always do.”

The power went out at midnight.

I did not sleep. I sat in the dark until morning, clutching my phone, refreshing the camera feed over and over.

When the sun finally came up, the porch was empty.

No footprints. No damage.

Just one thing.

A small wrapped gift sitting neatly in front of my door.

No tag.

I did not open it.

I threw it away.

The gift was gone when I checked the trash this afternoon.
