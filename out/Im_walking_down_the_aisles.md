I’m walking down the aisles, it is 9:03. we closed a few minutes ago but I just saw something kind of strange when I entered the dog bed aisle. I saw something turn the corner at the end of the aisle, but I didn't get a good look at it. I’m pretty sure it was one of my coworkers but I'm the paranoid type so I felt like I should put it in writing.



I’m walking down the aisles, It is 9:15. I feel a little silly about writing anything. I know it's my fault for listening to horror stories while I’m in a nearly empty store. I work in a pet store so the sounds of the birds keep the mood light and I’m usually on the floor with someone else, but I guess it’s because I haven’t heard the birds in a while that I'm still a little spooked, but it’s not like they chirp all of the time. Oh, I saw one of my coworkers just turn the corner of one of the aisles I'm gonna go try and strike up a conversation to make myself feel better.



I’m walking the aisles, it's 9:30. There wasn’t anyone there when I tried to catch up, I even called out their name but no response. I’ve been looking for them for a bit now but I can't seem to find them. They might just be in the office talking to the manager. Now that I'm thinking about it though I don't think whoever I saw turn the corner a second ago was wearing the same colors as our uniform.



I’m walking down the aisles, it’s 9:35. I saw it again, it doesn't work here.



I’m walking down the aisles, it's 9:40. This isn’t happening, the only one with a key to unlock the door to the outside is the manager so I ran to his office I knocked on his door loudly I didn't care if I looked crazy I just wanted to get out of here. As I waited for him to open the door I heard footsteps coming from behind me I looked but there wasn’t anything there. The noise was coming from behind one of the aisles where I couldn't see what was coming. I wasn't gonna stop and see what showed up so I ran away here to the back of the store.



I’m walking down the aisles, it's 9:50. I see it almost every time I walk into an aisle and every time it's rounding the corner. I think it's looking for me. If I ever stop walking for more than a few seconds I can hear it behind me so I have to keep moving. I can never get a good look at it no matter how fast I move it’s always just barely out of my sight, I don't know what it'll do to me if it catches me or if it's even real and I'm just going crazy.



I’m running down the aisles, it's 9:57. I think it's getting faster I don't see it turning corners anymore I only ever hear its footsteps behind me, we’re scheduled to be getting out of here at 10 so I’m gonna make a run for it and pray the manager is already at the front and unlocking the door. I’m going now wish me luck I’ll update you all once I'm out safe.
