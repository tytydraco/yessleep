The dilapidated, wooden building whose sign proclaimed it as the home to “Allegheny Adventures,” its red paint weathered and peeling, looked more abandoned than closed. The van parked next to the building was equally devoid of inhabitants, though there were three canoes loaded onto its attached trailer.

“Where the hell is everyone?” Dad wondered to himself, hands tapping the steering wheel annoyedly. The SUV idled quietly on the dirt road that terminated at the gravel lot adjacent to the building. The car windows were down letting in the comfortable warmth of a mid-August afternoon.

“What’s going on, Dale?” Sean called to Dad from the jeep behind us, his head sticking out the window. Through the windshield I could see my older sister, Tara, asleep next to him, her foot braced against the dashboard where she was riding shotgun, but couldn’t spy her friend Amanda in the back seat.

“Dunno, babe,” Dad answered back, “looks like the Dead Heads forgot we were coming.”

“Seriously?” Sean’s voice carried a put-upon tone, “you said this was going to be fun.”

Dad rolled his eyes. “I’ll take care of it.” He turned to me as he opened the door and stepped out. “Stay here, Paul, keep an eye on your brother.”

“He’s not my brother,” I mumbled quietly under my breath as he slammed the door.

“What was that?” Dad asked leaning back in the window.

“Nothing,” I replied quickly.

“That’s what I thought,” Dad said with an arched eyebrow, “Stay here.” 

He hitched up his shorts and started walking to the building.

“I’m booooored,” Dennis whined from the seat behind me.

“Shut up, Dennis,” I told him, still looking at Dad as he climbed the three rickety steps and banged on the screen door at the top.

“That’s no way to talk to your brother, Paulie Waulie.”

I turned back to him.

“Just because our dads are married doesn’t make you my brother, you little scab.”

He stuck his tongue out at me, but my glare was enough to make him turn back to his video game magazine with a grumble. I returned my attention to the building where Dad had switched tactics and was trying the door. It swung open as he pulled and he called back to us, “Be right back,” before stepping inside, the screen banging noisily behind him. I checked my watch and saw it was just a little past two.

Sean got out of the jeep, pushing his designer sunglasses up his nose and stretching exaggeratingly. For a moment everything was serenely quiet, the only noises the low rumble of the car engines and the slight whisper of a breeze.

“Dale, everything ok in there?” Sean shouted toward the door Dad disappeared through. There was no answer, and the silence extended for several long heartbeats. 

Abruptly, the screen door practically exploded outward, slamming against the side of the building and eliciting a shriek of surprise from Sean. A haggard looking man wearing a scraggily beard and a brilliantly colored tie-dye t-shirt emerged, stumbling down the steps. He barely caught himself from face-planting in the dirt before spinning in place back toward the building, his balance wavering. Concerned, I opened the door and got out, but didn’t know what else to do.  Looking back, I saw Tara was awake and that she and Amanda had gotten out of the jeep, their mouths both twisted into frowns. Dennis had dropped his magazine, his jaw open in dull shock. My dad exited the building after the man, a look of confused bemusement upon his face.

“No! No way, no how. I ain’t going and I ain’t taking you, dude,” the man I recognized as Jerry Conroe, the owner of Allegheny Adventures, shouted at my dad, jabbing his finger towards him violently. 

“Jerry,” Dad spread his hands in a placating gesture, “What are you talking about? Paul and I have been coming here for years. We paid in advance months ago.”

“Nuh uh, man,” Jerry shook his head vehemently, “not a chance. You know how we ain’t gotten any rain this summer? River’s the lowest it’s been in like eighty years. Turns out that ain’t a good thing.”

“I looked online just yesterday. Everything says the water’s still deep enough for canoes, just not some of the bigger stuff. We shouldn’t have a problem.” 

“I ain’t TALKING about the fucking canoes, man,” Jerry screamed, spit flying everywhere.

Dad wiped away a few flecks that landed on his beard. “Gross. Look, Jerry, I think you’re a little too stoned to be talking business. Where’s Cheryl?”

“Cheryl’s….” Jerry drifted off before collapsing to his knees sobbing, “Gone, man. Cheryl’s gone,” he managed to get out.

“Dale?” Sean had walked up near our car, eyes wide with concern.

Dad held his hand up, warding Sean back. He knelt down next to Jerry, speaking quietly near the crying man’s ear. Jerry kept sobbing but after a minute or two started nodding his head, wiping the back of his hand across his eyes. Dad stood and clapped him on the shoulder, then helped him to his feet. 

“We’ll get the trailer loaded with our gear. Get sobered up and I’ll let you know when we’re ready to go.” 

Jerry continued to nod before stumbling back up the steps and back into the building, the screen again slamming noisily behind him.

“Paul?” Dad looked at me, “Sean and I will park the cars. Could you take Dennis and the girls to the shed and help them get the lifejackets and paddles?” 

“Sure, Dad,” I turned back to Dennis, “let’s go, puke stain.”

“Is that normal?” I heard Sean ask Dad as I walked behind the building towards the equipment shed.

“Nah,” Dad said, “Jerry’s just a little more baked than usual. I think his wife left him.”

“Can’t imagine why.”

“That’s the guy you and Dad have always talked about?” Tara asked, catching up to me as we reached the shed. “I thought you said he was cool.” 

“He is, his wife too. I mean, they always have been anyways,” I shrugged as I pulled open the door, “I guess that’s why Dad tells us not to do drugs.”

“You’re such a square, Paul,” Amanda ruffled my hair as she walked behind Tara into the shed, perusing the equipment, “I bet he could get us some really good shit. Now,” she turned back to me with a malicious grin, “think you could help me find a lifejacket that will fit over my girls?” she arched her back, causing her chest to stick out provocatively.

Tara rolled her eyes and gently shoved Amanda, “You’re ridiculous. Don’t tease him,” she turned to me, seeing my eyes practically bugging out of their sockets, “and you’re a pig.” 

“Hey!” I protested.

“Ooooo, Paulie’s got a girlfriend,” Dennis crooned from the doorway.

“Shut UP, Dennis!” 

“Sorry, Paul,” Amanda smiled wryly, “You’re cute, but you’re not my type. I like my men older. Now your dad on the other hand…mmm, if he weren’t gay…” 

“Oh my GOD,” Tara shrieked, grabbing a lifejacket and paddle at random and storming back out of the equipment shed, “I can’t believe I invited you on this trip!”

“You need me, honey!” Amanda called after her, “Without another source of estrogen on this trip you’ll die!” 

She chuckled, turning back to me. “Seriously, though, can you help me find a good lifejacket?”

“Sure. Dennis, grab a small, I’ll help you get it sized in a second,” I told my stepbrother, pulling on my own jacket with practiced motions before handing Amanda a medium, “Here, try this one.”
Amanda tapped her lip with her finger thoughtfully as I adjusted the various straps. “How’s that work anyway? I mean, Sean throws a giant blip on my gaydar, but your dad is, like, totally hetero-seeming. And both of them obviously had kids with previous wives.”

I shrugged.

“I think it was just a different time. When they were our age, they felt forced to try and fit in. Sean says he ‘finally realized he couldn’t repress who he was anymore’ and that’s what ended his first marriage.  My mom left Dad, Tara, and me when she found her ‘soulmate’ in her weekly bible study.“

“Dude, that sucks. No wonder Tara never told me. How’d Sean and your dad meet?”

“Community theater. They played Jean Valjean and Javert opposite each other in Les Miserables. The rest is history.”

“That is so CUTE! And your dad does theater? MUSICAL theater?!” Amanda gasps, “God, he would so be my type.” 

It was almost four by the time we got the gear on the trailer, had Jerry, still likely stoned but considerably less upset, drive us the twenty-five miles north to the river entry point, unloaded, and got the canoes ready to launch.  

“Ok, Jerry,” my Dad stroked his beard, “you get back home safe and we’ll see you in a couple days, yeah?”

Jerry mumbled something under his breath but nodded agreeably and waved before slamming the van door closed and driving away. 

“You know the most interesting people,” Sean mused.

I went to get in the canoe my dad was standing next to, but he put a hand on my shoulder. 

“Ah, hold on a sec, Paul. I think you and Dennis should share a canoe.”

“What?! Dad…” 

“No come on, think about it. You’re the most experienced one here besides me,” he lowered his voice conspiratorially, “Sean’s not much of an outdoorsman, but I think he’ll do ok with Amanda.”

“Well, why can’t Dennis go with you, and I get Tara then?” I hissed back.

“Big senior too cool for his little brother? No, come on Paul. He’s too light compared to me. You know it’s important to keep the canoes at least somewhat balanced. Besides, he looks up to you.”

“Dad, I don’t…”

“Paul…” Dad interrupted my protest and crosses his arms. I could tell an argument wasn’t going to end my way.

“Fine,” I grumbled, “but remember it’s your fault if the little idiot won’t listen to me and tips the canoe.”

“Good man,” Dad slapped my back and turned his attention to the rapidly darkening sky. “Now, we’d better get a move on. Despite what Jerry said about not having any rain this summer, I think we’re about to get some. Let’s just go to the first island down to pitch camp for the night. It’ll ease the others in, and with good luck we’ll get the tents up before the weather hits.”

If we had any luck, it wasn’t good. 

The issues started almost immediately. Dennis was not only too weak to really help with the paddling from his seat in the front of the canoe, but the little shit actively worked against me. He dipped his paddle in the water forcing me to constantly change the side I was rowing on, and at one point even back paddled, snickering at his cleverness. Before long, we were far behind the other two canoes.  I cast what I hope was an “I told you so” look in Dad’s direction, but even from as far away as I was I could tell he and Tara were laughingly engaged in conversation and he didn’t notice.

“Stop it, you little fart muncher.” 

At last, Dennis tired of being annoying and simply leaned back on the gear we had piled in the middle of the canoe, pretending to go to sleep. Without having to compensate for his sabotage I was at least able to get us going in something resembling a straight line, though with just me rowing there was no hope we would be able to catch the others before they got to the campsite.

The island in the middle of the river that Dad had chosen was only about a mile and a half down from the launch point, but even that took us the better part of an hour to navigate. The rain started to fall about half a mile out, a slight drizzle at first but gradually increasing.  I could see ahead where the other two canoes had made the bank of the island. Dennis sat up abruptly with a shriek of surprise. As the rain abruptly picked up, he actually started helping me row. Even with both of us paddling in unison, by the time Dennis and I finally reached the campsite and managed to pull our canoe out of the water, we were fully soaked through.

Coming into a clearing we had used in past years, Dad was in the process of staking the weather fly down on a small two-person tent, while Sean sat hopelessly in the middle of a pile of poles and tarp. The girls were nowhere to be seen so I could only surmise they were in the tent Dad was working on. He paused as he saw us stumble up. 

“Paul, I’m going to finish getting the girls settled, then I’ll help Sean with our tent. Why don’t you and Dennis unload the gear from your canoe and stack it under that tree over there with the rest of it. Then take the hatchet and the hacksaw and try to find some wood so we can get a fire going.”

“In this?” I raised my hands to indicate falling rain, a distant rumble of thunder helping illustrate my point. “It’ll all be soaked.”

Dad threw me a grin.

“Don’t worry, kiddo, I packed some dry tinder. Once we get it started the wood’ll burn, might just be a little smokier than normal.”

I grumbled but moved towards the canoe and started pulling out bags and coolers, shuttling them to the tree with the other equipment and supplies. To my surprise Dennis helped without even a snarky comment. By the time we got the gear unloaded, Dad and Sean had the second tent about halfway up. I walked towards them, hatchet in one hand and a waterproof flashlight in the other. 

“We’re all set. How come you didn’t have the girls go get wood while you were waiting for us?”

Dad laughed. 

“Didn’t trust them to find the right kind. Also, come on, will it kill you to prove that chivalry isn’t dead?” 

I shook my head and sighed. 

“Come on Dennis.”

From previous stays on the island, I knew it wasn’t huge, maybe a ten-minute walk from end to end. Each year there were usually one or two decent sized trees that have fallen over, so I was fairly confident we’d be able to find some deadwood, though I was still skeptical how well it would burn with all the rainwater soaking through it. I just knew that sometimes there was no point in arguing with Dad.

Despite the extended daylight hours of summer, the clouds had caused night to fall prematurely. I was glad I thought to bring the flashlight; otherwise, it would have been way too easy to trip and fall face-first into a mud puddle. I played the beam on the ground in front of me, carefully choosing my steps, periodically pausing to shine the light off to the sides, looking for fallen logs. Dennis followed me, head down and grumbling, swinging the hacksaw he was carrying and letting it hit against the tall grass and various plant life that lined the narrow animal trail I had us walking on.

Finally, after maybe ten minutes of searching, I found something promising. A tree had fallen, and the way it rested against one of its still-standing neighbors seemed like it may have even gotten a little bit of top cover from the rain. I handed the flashlight to Dennis.

“Here, hold the light for me. I’m going to use the hatchet to try and get some of the small stuff cleared off then I’ll swap you for the saw.”

“Why can’t I saw?”

I looked up at the still falling rain.

“Because I can do it faster and I’d like to get out of this crap and into dry clothes as soon as I can, wouldn’t you?”

Dennis mumbled something under his breath but grunted and shined the light on the fallen tree as I’d asked. I started to clean off the smaller twigs, working by the light. Dennis started hopping from foot to foot to try and stay warm, causing the beam to sway, but I managed to bite my tongue and not say anything. 

I had switched to the hacksaw, cutting off and stacking some good looking, inch thick branches, when a keening wail carried high over the falling rain, sounding from somewhere not very far down the river. Dennis snapped the flashlight beam around wildly.

“Paul! What was that?”

I paused for a moment, listening, and heard an answering call echo, this one from farther up the river in the opposite direction. Its solitary weirdness sent a shiver down my spine that had nothing to do with the temperature that had dropped fiercely with the storm. The hairs on the back of my neck stood at full attention. 

“I..I don’t know. Maybe some kind of bird or frog or something.”

“In this rain?” Dennis’s voice hissed, incredulous.

I shook my head, shrugging off the fear. 

“Doesn’t matter. It’s not here. Let’s get this finished up and back to the tents.”

I got back to work, and to his credit, Dennis held the light steady.
We returned to the campsite maybe twenty minutes later, both carrying armfuls of cut branches. The tents were both now fully set up. Dad had also erected a makeshift tarp over a circle of stones he’d arranged to serve as a bonfire pit to help protect the flame from the weather. He’d crouched over a small pile of paper and would scraps, carefully setting them to provide the maximum chance of the fire catching. 

Dennis dumped his wood next to him.

“Where’s my dad?” he asked, and Dad nodded toward our tent.

“He’s getting changed, Dennis. Why don’t you go do the same? Paul, can you help me get the fire going?”

I sighed internally but nodded and moved to help him as Dennis disappeared into the tent.

Waiting until the flap zipper closed fully, I whispered to Dad, my voice low.

“Did you hear those noises?”

Dad nodded. 

“Yeah, we all did. Scared the crap out of Sean, he jumped about a mile. The girls were pretty freaked out too.”

“They aren’t the only ones. Dad, what the heck was that?”

“Dunno, son. Can’t say I’ve heard anything quite like it before. Maybe a mountain lion?”

“A mountain lion?” I squeaked. “TWO of them? Do they even live around here?”

“Maybe they got lost from over near Penn State. Hey, they probably don’t swim very well.” Dad grinned, “But all the more reason to get this fire started.”

We finished arranging the starter, the tarp doing a surprisingly good job of keeping it dry, until Dad at last nodded in approval.

“That should do it. Let’s give it a shot.”

He took out a long Bic lighter and set the flame to the rolled newspaper in several different spots. The tinder caught quickly, the wood snapping merrily, and we moved to stack the branches Dennis and I cut into a rough pyramid over the starter material. The sticks smoked considerably as they began to dry, but eventually caught just as Dad predicted. He looked over to the remaining pile.

“Nice job, Paul. Those won’t last very long though. We need something bigger if we want to keep this going through the night.”
I sighed. “I think the tree I got these from will work, I’ll just have to cut some logs from farther down the trunk.”

“Ok. I hate to ask,” Dad glanced up at the still falling rain, a peal of distant thunder rolling from away over the mountains that line the river, “but any chance you could go cut a few good-sized ones before you get cleaned up?”

“You can’t come with me?”

“I think I’d better stay here, just in case any of the camping newbies need anything. I’m sorry this trip is off to such a rough start. You want to take Dennis again?”

I didn’t have to take a moment to think about it.

“No. I’ll get it done faster by myself. Besides, he’s already probably changed.”

Dad clapped me on the shoulder.

“Proud of you, Son.” 

I rolled my eyes and stood, grabbing the hacksaw and flashlight from where I’d set them.

“I’ll leave the hatchet with you. Don’t think I’ll need it to cut the big stuff.”

Dad nodded in agreement. 

“Hey!” he called.

I paused, turning back to him.

“I love you, Paul.

“Love you too, Dad.”

“We’ll be waiting here!” he grinned.

I scowled and trudged away back towards the fallen tree.

I found the spot Dennis and I had come from without difficulty and got to work, setting the light in a way to shine on where I was cutting. The rain had blessedly stopped, at least temporarily, but the cold front that brought it had caused an eerie fog to begin to seep sinuously up from the undergrowth. The temperature had continued to drop and it was only the physical activity that was keeping me from shivering. It was probably not too cold yet, maybe in the lower fifties, but the change from the upper eighties of the earlier afternoon made it feel much worse than it actually was.

Something nagged me at the back of my mind as I worked on the tree, but it was several long minutes before I realized exactly what it was. Other than the rasp of the saw gliding back and forth against the tree, and the distant gurgle of the river flowing past the island shore, the night was utterly still and quiet. No birds called, no insects chirped, just dead silence. Another chill ran down my back as my mind returned to the mysterious cries from earlier, and then back farther to Jerry’s strange warnings from this afternoon. Despite what I told Dennis, and what Dad told me, those sounds were like nothing I’d ever heard before. 

I got back to my work with a will, focusing on getting enough wood to last the night so that I could get out of my sopping clothes and curl up in my sleeping bag until morning. I told myself that surely the light of day would ward off whatever it was that made those sounds, but a little voice at the back of my mind asked “but what if it doesn’t?”. 

The going was slower than earlier, the lower parts of the tree between six and eight inches thick and taking much more effort to work through. Still, I’d managed to cut a good number of pieces, enough that I was thinking it may take multiple trips to get back to the campsite, when I paused, my ears registering another sound from back the way I came. Thinking about it, I realized that the noise had been going on for several minutes now, interrupting the earlier silence I had previously noted, but I was so focused on my work that at first I didn’t notice the change. The sound was faint but distinct.

Screaming.
