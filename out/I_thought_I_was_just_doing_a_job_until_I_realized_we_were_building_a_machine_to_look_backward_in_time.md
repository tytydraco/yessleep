I had recently picked up a job as “Chief Security Officer” at a software development company. 

They didn’t have much use for cybersecurity personnel at that point, as most security affairs were taken care of by artificial intelligence. But I was present for almost anything that involved the company’s simulation servers, just as a last resort. Basically, I was there to make sure the AI didn’t bug out.

One day, we were working on a new physics engine. This engine was honestly mind blowing. It could simulate hundreds of factors at once. For example, just walking or running in a game, this engine understood the slight alterations in speed depending on the gravity, torque, momentum, friction, and even the way vibrations would travel through the skeleton upon exerting force into the ground. It used these factors, combined with the muscle mass, height, bone density and age of the character walking to create an almost indistinguishable-from-reality simulation of walking. All of this, built from the atomic level up. And it didn’t stop with walking. 

We were working on a specific simulation so we could roll out the engine to sports games. I remember it so distinctly. It was just a man hitting a baseball. We were using a combination of AI and engineers, watching different scans, audio and video recordings of real-life baseball, attempting to isolate all of the different variables. There were some easy ones. The strength, the angle, the wind. But even with these variables stagnant, the ball was never landing in the same exact place twice. Finally, we thought we had found the culprit. There were slight atomic variations when it came to the angle. It was seemingly impossible for a batter to hit a ball the exact same way twice, even if it appeared as if they did to the naked eye. After realizing this and tweaking everything accordingly, it still didn’t work. We realized shortly after that the way we were generating the baseball was important as well, as no two baseballs are exactly the same. We had some slight variations in the material make-up of the balls to keep it more realistic when playing a game, but for the purpose of this simulation, we needed every ball to be microscopically identical. Identical balls, bats, identical atomic angles.

Now, finally we could run the simulation. And it worked. The batter would hit the ball 101.3m away from home plate. The ball would bounce twice, and land with the logo facing up. Every. Single. Time. Sitting from the back and watching this simulation take place, something came into my mind. A stupid question, really. I decided to ask one of the engineers, someone who had been friendly with me since I started working here.  
  
“Hey man.. So, we know all of these variables, probably hundreds of data points by now, that cause the ball to land in this exact position, right?”  
  
“I mean yeah, that‘s the whole point.” He replied, looking up from his monitor.  
  
“So, what if we just had the ball?” I asked, realizing how silly it might have sounded.  
  
“Then it wouldn’t go anywhere?” He said, looking back down at his monitor.  
  
“No, I mean, look, imagine the ball has already been hit. And we don’t have access to the ball being hit. Just where it landed. Could we, like, predict, or I guess, figure out exactly, what all those variables were that allowed the ball to land exactly where it was, and how it landed?”  
  
“Oh uh, yeah” said the engineer, now with some mild interest. “Yeah we probably could. We’d just have to reverse the process. Run a bunch of simulations until we figured it out. I don’t know how useful that would be for the engine, though.”

“Maybe not for the engine. But what if we trained it on, I don’t know, a boat that sank to the bottom of the ocean. Could the engine, like, figure out how, when, and why the boat sank, where it was, et cetera?” I asked, realizing the absurdity of my hypothesis but unable to figure out why it wouldn’t work.   
“If we think about it, the ball being thrown has maybe a hundred variables, and the boat sinking maybe has ten thousand, but we already know how powerful this engine is… I don’t know, maybe I’m--”

“No, you’re right.” The engineer cut me off. “We would just need to train it enough on real world physics. How it all interacts. Radio and sonar scans, videos, everything we can get. It’s way too big a job for us engineers, but I bet the AI could do it. I just don’t see a reason they would sink that much money into it right now.” 

Thinking about all of this, I had a thought, one that was so absurd, but again, I couldn’t understand why it wouldn’t work.   
“Tell me, why wouldn’t we be able to.. Train it on a person? If it’s all just atoms moving around, bumping into each other. That’s all everything is, really, at its core. And our engine already knows how to simulate physics on an atomic level. It should, theoretically, be able to figure out why a person is the way that they are, physically and in terms of personality, just by observing them at the present moment… If we could figure out the path of a baseball, or a boat, then why not a person?  There’s only one distinct path they could have taken to be exactly the way they are right now. What if we could simulate exactly what that path must be?”   
  
I paused for a minute. I knew what I was about to say sounded crazy. 

“It would basically be time travel, wouldn’t it?”

“Time travel? Well.. I don’t know about-- wait.. No, yeah, you’re right. It would be. With enough power, we could map out a person’s past. Well, theoretically, I think we could map out everyone’s past. Just from a small group of people, or maybe even one. A person should have a complex enough backstory, enough interactions that depend on other interactions, interactions that must have taken place exactly how they did for the person to take this distinct path.. Enough specific interactions that we could just scan one person, and get everyone’s whole lives, our whole lives. In a simulation. Now that’s a monetary incentive to get the higher-ups on board.”  
  
From one person? That didn’t make sense to me. But then it hit. What if we mapped out the path of the baseball, but didn’t stop at the baseball being hit by the bat? We could gather data on the intensity of the pitch, the state of the bat, the wind, the climate, the crowd. With this data, we could figure out a rough estimate of the build of the batter and the pitcher. We could figure out where it’s taking place. Now imagine if we had a million more variables. A person, instead of a baseball. We could get so much information about so much more.

Bewildered at the chain of thoughts I had sparked, unaware of what would come of it, I said “Not just our lives, but, the whole fucking universe since the beginning of time.”
