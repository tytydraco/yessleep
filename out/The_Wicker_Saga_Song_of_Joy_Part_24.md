Part 24: The Hunter

I shrug into my long trench coat, check to ensure the knives are properly seated in my belt, the machete and shotgun slung across my back in easy reach, pistols in their holsters. I look at the group I’ve assembled inside my childhood home; a mother, a soldier, a brother, a friend, and myself, a hunter. The questions I discussed with Michael earlier continue to swirl about in my mind. How can such a small number of us, of such innocuous and disparate backgrounds, possibly hope to swerve the will of fate? It doesn’t seem possible. 

I know too well the Darkness that we are about to face, have railed against it for too long, and in this case knowing does nothing more than to terrify me further. I almost envy Gabe and Sarah, so new to the realm of the supernatural; the fact that they are not gibbering in the thralls of madness shows how little they understand the gravity of what we are about to attempt. While Michael and his newly acquired symbiosis with the relic give me some small chance of success, I internally admonish myself; it is inevitable that choices will need to be made and difficult ones at that. There’s no sense giving myself false hope. I open the door, letting in a thick swirl of fog, and step outside down the steps, not waiting to see if the others follow. It matters little: what will be, will be.

The stars above are invisible as I head down the walkway towards Blackwood Drive, my footsteps muffled by the intense blanket of whiteness. I would expect them to be enhanced by the utter silence of everything around us, but instead they seem to sense the stillness is part of some natural order that they choose not to disturb. My lifetime of research has shown me that Arthur’s Wake has its own dark and twisted history, one that extends long before Tomas Wicker so foolishly chose to make it the site of his home and prison. The town has been dying or has perhaps remained in a state of perpetual undeath since its very founding, its life somehow sustained through some horrifying, unnatural means. How can any of its inhabitants not sense the darkness? How can they possibly survive here?

“It’s quiet.”

Michael’s murmur surprises me, sends a jolt of fear and adrenaline rushing down my spine. 

“It’s always quiet,” I reply, “until the screaming starts. This town is cursed.”

“Literally or figuratively?” Sarah asks.

“Quite literally, my dear, though the Wicker House is by far the focal point. There exists a kind of magical energy that flows around and through our world, a sort of river system invisible to all but a very few. This town was built on a sort of massive hub where a large number of those streams connect, and Wicker thought to try and tap into that flow to power the glyphs of his prison. It worked, but perhaps too well.”

“Ungh,” Jamie grunts in discomfort, “I appreciate the history lesson, Morgan, but I think we need to focus. Mom’s influence is…getting stronger. I didn’t think that was possible.”

I turn to look at him concernedly. “Will you be able to control yourself?”

He grins at me shakily with the lips of the young man whose body he has currently possessed. His head is shaved close, a swastika tattoo prominently displayed on his neck, but I can always tell it is Jamie by his smile and eyes. “No issues, Morg.”

“Uh, group,” Gabe’s voice has a sharp note of unease in it as the school guard raises the pistol in his good hand to a ready position, “I think they know we’re coming.”

My attention snaps to follow his gaze and I see what Gabe has noticed before the rest of us. The physical distance from my home to the Wicker House is not far, a couple hundred yards. Slowly appearing out of the fog as if by magic, lining both sides of the road that we walk are dozens of children, their small dark eyes glinting dangerously. They make no move to stop us, but it would be impossible to abandon our path without crossing over them. Michael starts, raising the relic in his hand which begins to glow with eldritch light. I reach out, lowering his arm again.

“Don’t.”

“What is this, Morgan?” Sarah asks. 

“I don’t know for sure. Remember, we are riding the lines of destiny now, but they aren’t impeding us. My best guess is that Lilith wants us to know that she knows we are coming to confront her, and possibly to ensure that we don’t change our minds. Keep an eye on them, but don’t engage.”

Jamie grumbles but doesn’t question me. Our group continues our journey, now flanked by our eerie honor guard.

Parting like a curtain, the fog at last thins enough to reveal our destination, Lilith’s prison and abode so commonly known as the Wicker House. The structure squats, peering at us malevolently through the iron bars of the fence that surrounds it. Even the emanations my psychic sensitivity passively pick up from the house are enough to almost overwhelm my senses. There has been a pronounced change in the weeks since I saved Sarah and Samantha from Frank, a kind of building and condensing of dark energy. Coming so close to the site of her recent horrors, Sarah shudders next to me. I feel a pang of sympathetic understanding, my mind returning to the long-ago night I lost my sister Claire here. 

A single light from within seemingly illuminates the second story window through which a solitary, pale figure observes us silently with smiling, crimson eyes. 

“She awaits you, Morgan.” I turn to the voice, and there is my sister, still appearing eight-years old. She’s reaches out and takes my hand, “I’m to bring you and the Soldier to Her.”

“Morgan…” Jamie hisses.

“Quiet, traitor,” Claire snaps at him.

“It’s all right, Jamie. If she wanted to fight, we’d be fighting already. This is something else.”

“You shouldn’t split the party, Morgan, especially not going into that house.”

I smile tightly. “You and Gabe watch out for Sarah. Protect her. We’ll be right back.”

Gabe nods and sidles closer to Sarah, his steely eyes taking in the enemy on all sides.

Claire begins to lead me gently, “This way.” 

Michael follows. “You sure about this, Morgan?” he whispers, “Do you have some kind of psychic insight or something?”

“Of course not. I’m just…following my gut.”

The front door creaks open of its own accord revealing the dark interior of the house, a flight of steps leading up to the second story. I know all too well where Claire is taking us. We proceed up the stairs and down the hallway to the room I last saw my sister alive, where Jamie and I once tried to repair the wards of Lilith’s prison, where Sarah was almost killed by Frank wearing her husband’s body: the cell Tomas Wicker constructed to hold a being of almost incalculable power. Reaching the door at the end of the hall Claire releases my hand.

“The Mother is within.” The thing that was once my sister steps into the shadowed recesses of the hallway and fades from sight, disappearing as completely as if she were never there. I turn to the door.

“I suppose we should go in.”

Michael nods, though I can sense the nervous tension rippling through his body. I grasp the door knob, turn and pull.

Opening the door to the room shows the walls, formerly covered by garish yellow wallpaper, have been stripped to reveal the masses of arcane symbols populating their every inch and glowing softly with arcane light. I take in that the small portion of them that I’d tried to ineffectually repair decades ago remain marred, a detail that has inevitably allowed Lilith to impose her influence far more so than the prison’s architect had ever intended. 

In the middle of the floor lies a drawn ritual circle, its center containing an enormous pile of obscenity; I know without knowing that the structure, arranged in the shape of a pyramid can only be composed of hundreds of human hearts. The huge, stone-faced figure of Creed faces us to one side of the room, a smiling Frank Lawrence on the other. Between them, her gaze still fixed out through the window, haunting figure tragic yet terrible in its beauty, stands the Woman in White.

“Heed ye, and despair,” Creed’s voice rolls with the sound of dangerous thunder, “You call upon the First, the All-Mother, the White Queen of All, here in Her realm and throne.”

“Hardly a throne. This is her prison, Creed,” I reply. “Why are we here?”

“Shut up, bitch,” Frank growls, “and show some respect.” 

Creed glares at Frank furiously before returning his attention to me.

“Since time immemorial the All-Mother has sought balance throughout reality, exercising Her will as necessary to achieve it. Outside entities have upset the neutrality that She so vigorously fought to maintain, a condition which must now be rectified. The most complete way to do this is to wipe the slate of creation clean. The rite you see prepared before you shall bring down my Mistress’s Song of Joy, fueled by the very power that enervates the imprisonment of Her avatar. She regrets the pain and fear that will be caused, but such things are temporary. Once creation has been returned to the void that is Her, time itself and such whimsy as death and suffering will cease to exist; all will be at peace, once more in Darkness.”

I feel a pit of horror open in my stomach.

“You’re talking about…”

“The end of everything,” Michael whispers beside me. 

Creed nods, “Indeed. Yet in Her love, the All-Mother has ever granted Her children free will. As such you are provided with a choice. You may elect to keep the rite from completion and thus prevent the Song from occurring,” Creed smiles, his sharp teeth glinting evilly in the light from the wards, “If you can.” 

“The wolves howl, the serpents hiss,” Frank laughs, his mouth widening impossibly, body growing unnaturally misshapen, “whichever will you choose?”

“Not much of an option, really,” murmurs Michael, his voice shaking.

“No,” I reply, “It’s not.” 

“Yesssss,” purrs Creed, his dark eyes alight. His mistress has still not moved, her attention still fixated out the window. At last she turns, her crimson eyes meeting mine, somehow filled with love and pain, sorrow and joy all at once.

With the speed of thought, I draw a pistol and fire, silver bullet streaking towards the Woman in White.

And all hell breaks loose.
