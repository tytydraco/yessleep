Have you ever felt like sometimes your memories may really just be dreams? A moment so surreal It feels like it might have never been reality at all. 

The story I'm about to tell you is a direct account of how life is never what it may seem. Bare warning, nothing I'm going to say will seem real, and trust me I still hardly believe it isn't just a dream, but everything I feel today tells me otherwise. The ups and downs have been so drastic throughout the short time I've spent on earth, I remember almost every moment in vivid detail. 

My parents and I lived in a nice suburban area with nothing to fear. They made good money, I went to a good school, and the rest of our family would do anything for us when the need arose. 

My Father worked a good job at an electrical company. He worked hard for what we had, often working overtime most nights, but He was always home on time for the weekends, and even got most holidays off. My Mother was a teacher at our local elementary school and always had something kind to say, no matter the situation. Life was good. I was happy. We were happy. 

Until one night, when I was about 6 years old, I was sitting with my Mother in the kitchen. She was busy cooking dinner, but when she could, she turned back to me and helped me answer whatever first grade math problem was puzzling me. While taking a break from homework, I watched as she spun around the room, her apron strings flying around her wildly as she danced back and forth across the kitchen, flashing a smile at me each time her eyes met mine. As she stopped to stir the pot on the stove, I broke from my trance and looked at the clock above her on the microwave. Despite the little green numbers being hard to read from a distance, I distinctly remember the clock reading: 6:08. 

“Mom?” I said quietly. She stopped stirring and turned to me, her apron strings dangling dangerously close to the pot of boiling chili. 

“Yes, hon? Everything alright?” 

“Yeah I'm fine. I was just wondering when dad was gonna be home. He said this morning he'd be back by 5.” 

She turned to the clock and noticed the time. “6 o’ clock already? That's not like him on a Friday,” her voice was soft and almost worrisome. 

“Can I call him?”

“Sure hon, go ahead, my phone is on my desk.”

I jumped up from the table and ran into the front room where her desk was. I grabbed her phone and took it into the kitchen, dialing the only phone number I knew as I hopped back to the table. To this day it's the only phone number I can remember. 

The phone rang as my Mother returned to stirring the pot. A vague sense of fear emanated off of her as her back was turned to me. The phone rang once. Then twice. Then a third time. I watched as her shoulders tensed each time she heard it ring. Eventually it went to the voicemail. My Fathers voice echoed through the room and I frantically tried to hang up having accidentally put it on speaker phone. 

“I'm sorry I can't reach my phone right now. If your friends, I apologize, and if your family, I hope everything is okay and I will be with you as soon as I can.”  

My Mom turned around, the stove no longer burning and the chili no longer bubbling. She reached across the table and without saying a word took the phone from me. 

In a state of confusion I returned to my homework. As I reached the final question I heard it ring again. Once, twice, and a third time, before the voicemail returned. 

From what I can remember, I was sitting at that table for what felt like hours until eventually my Mother gave up trying the phone. She dropped it on the counter and looked over at me. I looked at the clock again, fearing it was almost my bedtime. This time, it read: 8:30. 
Through misty eyes she spoke, her voice trembling softly, “It's time for bed. Why don't you go get ready, I'll be right up to tuck you in.” 
I nodded and ran up to my room. I changed into pajamas and crawled into bed, waiting for her to come tuck me in and turn my lights off. Instead, I layed there, once again for what felt like hours, as she wept in the kitchen, with my fathers voicemail on speaker, playing over and over again. 

The rest of what happened is still a blur. I remember the cops, the wreck, the hospital and the funeral. Not in much detail but enough to know that they really happened. My Mother understandably fell into a deep depression, while I was too young to truly understand what grief was. I struggled to talk to my friends, my grades dropped and my behavior was severely impacted. Eventually my Mother couldn't stay in our home any longer. The absence of my Father filled every room with a weight so heavy it made even breathing seem difficult. 
We moved to a new town not too far away so that she could still work at the school, since there were no available schools for her to transfer, and so that family were still close enough to visit. 

The new house was pretty small, but had a decent sized yard. It was backed by a small forest, and the room I got was pretty big. Eventually due to the large yard, my Mom decided it was a good time to get a dog. The dog actually helped quite a bit. I started doing a little better in school and she often made the weekends something to look forward to. Still, the weight of loss hung heavy over our heads. 
I felt like I would never be able to connect to anyone the same again. When my friends found out about the loss, they tried to help, but being so young, nothing they could have said would've done anything. I later learned that I unknowingly pushed them away. Turns out First graders are remarkably hard to keep as friends if you don't speak at all.
	
My Mother never quite got any better. She would make dinner in silence and just turn on the T.V to keep me occupied, while the dog sat next to her, nesting her head on oftenher lap. It was lonely. Despite the family still being so near, we never left the house much. She pulled away from his side specifically, and would often ignore their calls. The days seemed to blend into one. Life was stagnant and gray, summer began to feel like winter and the world began to seem like it was spinning in slow motion. It wasn't until middle school that something finally changed and I still question whether it was for better, or worse.  

Once I reached middle school, everything seemed to get worse again. People change and the reality around you becomes harsher. Egos are inflated and kids are ruthless to those they don't understand, and with my unresolved grief, mental health was a very real thing. 
I tended to avoid the presence of anyone that wasn't my Mother. Losing my father so young created a world where all I knew was pain. Watching my Mother come home day after day and fall into the same void of silence hurt me deeper than I ever thought it did, making each day harder for me to forget what I had lost, but for some reason, I found comfort in the pain. 
However in about 8th grade on a cold January evening, everything would change. I came home from school to an eerily quiet house. I dropped my bag and went into the kitchen. There, a sticky note was left on the fridge. My Mother was out on a grocery run; something that happened rarely. Since I was alone, I found whatever left overs were in the fridge and heated them up. While I was sitting down struggling to enjoy the week old pizza I just grabbed, my dog, Maple, started barking to go outside. Questioning nothing, I stood from my meal and opened the back door. Maple pushed passed me in a hurry, aiming straight for the tree line at the end of the yard. We had no fence back there but Maple was always a loyal dog, so if she ran off it was the least of our worries. 

I watched from the doorway as she advanced into the trees, her nose and ears pointed with determination. Something had caught her attention. I stood there for a few moments, puzzled at the suddenness of Maple's behavior. As I went to call her back, I heard a faint noise fading in and out with the sound of the breeze. It sounded like singing. I felt my eyes glaze over and my thoughts go quiet, the only sound I could hear was the song. I began to walk towards the trees, It grew clearer as I inched my way closer to the source of the sound. My feet carried me from the doorway to the middle of the yard before I finally became conscious of what I was doing. I shook my head, barking in the distance filled my ears as my mind was returned to me. I called out to Maple but to no avail. I didn't want to go into the trees, but at that moment I saw no other choice. I figured she couldn't have gone too far, the trees didn't seem that deep and the barking wasn't too far off. It was getting darker by the second and she would probably freeze if left out here alone.

“God dammit Maple,” I muttered carefully under my breath in case my mother suddenly appeared behind me. Without thinking twice about the mysterious song, I ran back inside, grabbed my coat and a flashlight and set off into the trees. 

As I got closer to the tree line the barking stopped and the singing became clear again. I could feel the pull the strange voice had on my mind. My eyes felt heavy and my arms went weak. I managed to stay conscious, and trudge through the frozen leaves covering the ground. The trees were a mix of pine and oak. A simple blend of life and death amongst the winter's icy breath. 

“Maple!”

My voice was met with a soft whimper that came from my left. I turned and met her eyes. Maple was sitting underneath a tree. Its roots emerged from the ground, twisting through the soil like great earthworms of wood. She sat with her tail wagging, unintimidated by whatever held her attention so dramatically. 
It was then that I noticed the singing had ceased completely and behind the tree, I noticed a shadow, cast clearly upon the frozen ground. 

“Hello?” I spoke softly, and Maple had moved to sit beneath my feet. 

“Hello,” her voice was quiet and shy, but something about it was eerily alluring. 

“What are you doing out here?”

Without saying a word, the girl emerged from behind the tree. She was young, about my age. 13 or so. She had long brown hair that fell just past her shoulders, and her eyes were a deep shade of green. 

“Uhm…” she seemed unsure of what to make of me. She held her hands together and stood tensely as if I was there to get her in trouble for missing curfew. 

“Are you okay?” I asked. it was the only thing I thought to say at the moment. I had so many burning questions but I couldn't bombard her with them all at once. Meeting a strange girl in the forest is, at least I think, something that most 13 year olds dont experience. 
Her eyes scanned her surroundings, I could sense she was trying to think of something to say, but couldn't find the right words.

“I just come out here sometimes. It's a peaceful place. I can hear myself here if that makes sense.” 

“I understand,” I too often found places to go so that I could process my feelings. “I heard your singing just barely, it was beautiful,” her voice really was beautiful. There was no other way to describe it. 

“Oh thanks. I, uh, only really sing while I'm alone. I didn't know anyone could hear me.”

“Well, you're really good at it. I could hear it from my yard,” I didn't mention the effect it had on me, at least not yet, for obvious reasons. 

“Sorry if it was disturbing anyone. I didn't think I was that loud.” 

“No, no it's okay, my mom isn't home.”
Regretfully I remembered that I had to be home soon, but I needed to know her name. “I gotta get home now, but before I go, can I get your name?” 

“Willow.” 

She looked up towards the tree and then back at me with a slight smile. I didn't notice earlier, but we were standing beneath a massive willow tree. The leaves were all on the ground, frozen into ropes of ice. 

“Oh, it matches the tree,” I smiled at her with a kind curiosity. 

“The tree seems almost like a friend when you share a name.” 

“Maples named after the tree too, they’re my mom’s favorite in the fall,” Maple went to lick Willow's hand, she pulled away but smiled and pet Maple on the head. 

“Well, Willow, it was nice meeting you, I hope you make it home safe. I gotta go though, my moms gonna kill me.”

“Oh okay. Bye.”
I turned around and started walking but I realized quickly that I never gave her my name. 

“My name's Everett by the way.” 

“Nice to meet you Everett.” 

I took one last glance as she sat back down behind the tree. The sun finally dipped below the horizon. Leaving the forest dark as I made my way home. I was glad that I grabbed a light. Maple followed, her tail wagging quickly as she matched my pace.

I walked inside, set my flashlight down on the couch next to the door and noticed grocery bags piled on the counter, meaning that my mom was home and she put the groceries away already; Also something that rarely happened, usually I was the one to put them away. 

I found her upstairs reading quietly. The book was one that, at the time, she had been trying to read for a few months. She set the book down as I peeked into the room. 

“Where have you been? You look freezing.” 

“Outside.” 

“Why were you out there?”

“Maple ran off while you were gone.” 

“That's odd, she never usually does that. You got her back right?” 

“Yeah she's downstairs.”

“Alright, if you haven't eaten, I bought some new stuff for dinners. I got your favorites.” 

“It's okay, I already ate. Thanks though,” that was a lie. I was still hungry but I didn't wanna bother making something else. My mind was still set on my encounter with Willow. “I think I'm gonna head to bed, I don't have homework tonight, and I think the cold might have gotten to me a bit. Not feeling the best all the sudden.” That was also a lie. 

“Alright then, goodnight, I love you.”

“Love you too Mom.” 

I made my way to my room, and before I could even get my coat off I landed on the bed and fell asleep.The image of Willow and the sound of her song, already permanently etched into my mind. 

I had planned to go visit the willow tree again eventually but never got around to it for a few days. When I finally did, Willow wasn't there. I figured maybe she was busy or stuck at home, so I decided to try again first thing the next day. Since it was a Saturday, I had all the time in the world to sit and wait. 
The morning came around and I woke up with a gripping sense of anticipation. It made my stomach flip and my head light. I ran down the stairs, skipping the last few and tumbled to the floor. My Mother looked up from her cereal in surprise. 

“You’re up early, got somewhere to be?” 
My face went a little red, not knowing how to answer. “Yeah I guess. I was just gonna meet up with some friends for a while,” that was another lie, I could tell she was gaining suspicion. 


“I thought you said you weren't feeling well last night. You sure don't look like you have a cold.” 

“I never said I was sick, just worried I would be” 

“I see. Who are these friends you're meeting?” 

“Just some kids from school, sorry I forgot to tell you yesterday.” 

“It's fine, go have fun, just be back by five okay.” 

“I know, I will.”

“Bye son.”

“Bye Mom.” 

I ran out the door hastily slamming it shut behind me. The morning was cool but the sky was cloudless, letting the sun's rays shine brighter than usual. The frost on the grass had melted quickly, soaking through my shoes as I cut across the front lawn and to the gate in the back. I snuck around the house, careful to avoid any windows. I'm sure she saw me sneaking into the backyard of our own house in broad daylight but I didn't care. It was worth the effort to keep Willow secret. I Know now that if My Mother did find out I was sneaking out to see Willow, she would only be mad that I hadn't invited her to dinner, but something told me that I had to keep her a secret. 

I sprinted across the backyard and into the trees. The wet branches smacked me in the face as I ran carelessly towards the clearing. The sun was fresh in the sky making it much easier to tell where I was going. The ground was still moist from the newborn dewdrops. Once I made it, I stood quietly looking at the lone trunk, standing somberly in the clearing. For some reason at that moment I felt an odd sense of empathy towards the tree, standing alone, waiting for the spring to relinquish its depressive state.

I listened intently for any sign of Willow, instead the only sound I heard was a lone Raven fluttering through the trees. I watched as it stopped above me and looked at me intently. It gave me a strange feeling that sent a shiver down my back. I began to lose hope and turned towards home, slowly inching forward in case she suddenly appeared, but as I did I heard her soft voice echo quietly from behind me. She hummed the same song as the night we met. I turned to see her leaning against the tree, looking down and kicking the soil beneath her. I stood for a second, puzzled as to where she came from. Acknowledging my presence, She turned to me and smiled.

“Hi Everett. What brings you here?” 

“Just thought I'd come say hi, since our last meetup wasn't the best timing. I didn't expect to see you this early though.” 

“I'm usually here in the mornings and in the evenings. I've got chores and things during the day, and I get in trouble if I'm out too long.”

“Are you here everyday?” I asked. A flood of questions began to fill my mind, now that I wasn't in a rush.

“Usually, sometimes I can't, but most of the time I manage to sneak away for a few hours.” She smiled shyly and made eye contact. Her green eyes sparkled lightly in the sun. 

“Do you live close? Since you're here all the time? From what I know my house is the only house in the neighborhood that's on the edge of the forest.” 

“Yeah I live close.” Her eyes returned to the ground, she adjusted her weight and folded her arms. I couldn't put my finger on what was so mysterious about her. So many factors puzzled me in ways that I couldn't put together at the time. I couldn't help but be drawn to her in a way that I'd never felt before. It was an attraction that I can only explain as hypnotizing, perhaps bewitching. 

“I've got all day, If you want me to stay here for a while. I told my mom I was out with some friends so she didn’t get suspicious of me being out so long.”

She looked up again and her smile seemed more assured. She unfolded her arms and put them in the pockets of her denim overalls, her fingers poking through small holes worn into the edges. I noticed the rest of her clothes were fairly worn through. She had holes at the knees of her overalls and her light green shirt was grass stained and the sleeves were frayed at the seams. Her shoes were worn down to the soles and her laces were blackened with dirt, but yet she seemed very well taken care of. Her face was clean and her hair fell loosely upon her shoulders, shining slightly in the lighting of the forest. 

“I’ll probably get called home soon if that's okay, but you can stay until then.”

“Alright,” I sat down, leaning against the tree. Willow followed suit and sat next to me. “So, uh, what kinds of things do you like?” I said looking at the sky, the awkwardness began to set in once my nerves had settled. 

“I read lots of books, and sing. That's pretty much it.”

“Really?” I turned to her awestruck. “No movies or games?” My feeble mind couldn't comprehend that she did nothing else but read and sing. 

“Yeah, I guess,” she paused, avoiding eye contact again. A feeling of guilt washed over me. “I don't have a T.V, Mother wont let me have one. Trust me I've asked.”

“Oh I’m sorry. I didn't mean to jump at you like that. I'm just curious.”

“It's okay, I know I’m different. I don't have a lot of things other people do.” 

“That's alright, I feel the same way sometimes. I have to say it again though, you're really good at singing” 

“You really think so?” 

“I have to admit, it's almost hypnotizing.” 
She let out a quiet laugh and her posture straightened again. She seemed to go from outgoing to shy and back like the flip of a switch. Like she didn't quite know how to be around me. Not that I knew what I was doing either. 

“Hypnotizing? Is that why you were walking funny? Like you were lost?” 

“What do you mean?” I asked, knowing exactly what she meant.

“The other night when you were looking for your dog, she came and sat with me and you walked up looking like you were in another world. I wasn't even singing, I stopped once I noticed you.”

“Oh uhm,” I muttered, not knowing what to say. 

“I don't know what that was.” I didn't think she would piece that together so quickly. 

“If you say so,” She let out a laugh, this time wholehearted and confident. “If my singing is that good maybe I should become famous and put the whole world in a trance!” 

“Maybe.” Her sudden shift in demeanor kind of startled me. There was a strange sinister tone to her proposition. 

“Sorry, it was just a funny image. Thank you for the compliment. I'm sorry if I hypnotized you.” 

“It's okay, you helped me find Maple.” 

“She's a cute dog, I like her.” 

“You should come say hi sometime. She seemed to like you too.” I was suddenly worried I might be reaching a bit, giving out an invitation so soon.  

“Uh… I'm not sure about that. Mother might not let me. This is the farthest she usually lets me go, and I've never been invited to someone's house before.” 

“That's okay, I can bring her back here another time if you want.” Her posture shifted again and her eyes aimed back towards the ground, this time it didn't seem like she was avoiding a response, but questioning something in her head. It seemed like a few minutes went by before she finally responded. 

“No no it's okay, you don't have to do that. I should probably get going, it's almost noon.” 

I checked the cheap walmart watch on my wrist and sure enough it was exactly 12:00. How she knew without a watch I had no idea. 

“Alright, Are you gonna be back later?” 

“Maybe, we’ll see.” Her voice took on a somber tone. 

“I'll be here in case you can make it. I really enjoy talking to you.”

“Me too. I'll try my best.” 

I stood and brushed the dirt off my legs then held out my hand to help her up. She smiled and took my offer. Her hand grasped mine and she stood gracefully. She obviously didn't need my help but took it anyway. 

“See you later!” I said, enthusiastically expecting that to be a fact. 

“Bye again Everett.” She turned her back towards me and started off into the woods. I began my journey back but not before looking behind me again wishing we could've stayed longer. As I looked over my shoulder I noticed she had seemed to disappear completely, and looking back at the tree, I noticed a small purple flower next to where she was sitting, that hadn't been there before.
