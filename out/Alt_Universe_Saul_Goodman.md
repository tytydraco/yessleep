I had a dream about an alternative version of Better Call Saul where Jimmy kept and was happy with a desk job and still had a loving relationship with his brother, Chuck and other friends and family.

He was known as Saul Burger around the office, and his supervisor/superior was Mike Ehrmantraut. One day, while he was working, a fly started circling his head. After a long and semi dramatic showdown, Jimmy finally kills the fly on his desk and continues on with his work. A few minutes later, the office security guard comes over to his desk with a fly swatter and offers to help him kill the fly.
"What? I killed that fly with my bare hands 20 minutes ago. What are you talking about man, go awa-" 
Wham! The guard swats the fly smack dab in the center of one of the papers he had completed a few minutes ago. He gives blank faced Jimmy a respectful nod, turns around, and walks back to his office to continue working. Starstruck and slightly flustered, Jimmy finishes the last bit of paperwork he has, grabs his keys and jacket, and heads out for the night.

Later that night, Jimmy has a surreal dream. He is driving his car in a wooded rural area as the sun is setting. As he turns left at a bend in the windy narrow road, a thick cloud of black smoke reveals itself, peaking out against the backdrop of the sunset. As he drives closer, he notices the fire is coming from an old, overgrown barn in the thick of the forest. Jimmy immediate pulls over to stop his car, hops out, and hastily runs towards the barn.

Jimmy pushes through the thicket, making his way towards the fire. Details of the overgrown barn grew to reveal themselves through the black smoke as he grew closer. Half of the roof of the charred barn had collapsed into itself and what was still untouched had been like that for years, with nothing more than a chipped and peeling light red and white paintjob. As he closed in on the barn, finer details that were hidden by the dark forest reveal themselves to him. A piece of cloth is hanging on the barn with "CALL 911" sloppily written on to it with a flashing light coming from inside the barn. Jimmy suspects someone may have crashed their car into the barn, but the thick foliage and lack of a connecting road argued against that. Jimmy pulls out his phone and dials 911 with the one bar of service that he has left. 

"Emergency Dispatch 911, what's your emergency?"

"Hi, uh, there's a fire burning through an old barn and someone might be injured."

"What's your location?"

"I'm at the nature preserve here in Dekalb coun-"

A long, pale and wet hand wraps its grip around the base of a tree in front of the burning barn. Jimmy approaches the man.

"Hello! Sir! Are you okay? I'm calling an ambulance right no-"

An oblong head pokes its head around the tree, cautiously accessing Jimmy as a friend or foe with its huge blank eyes and skinny deadpan face. It had no nose or ears and more closely resembled a toad than an old farmer, with its pale wet skin and its wilting face with pulsing veins.

"Hello? Sir, are you still there? Can you give us your location on the preserve?"

Both Jimmy and the creature stared at each other, with equally dead eyes, each one being more scared than the other, interrupted only by Jimmy's snap back to reality, sitting in his bed next to Kim gently sleeping.

I woke up the same time Jimmy did, and definitely added/removed some details about the story. Originally the Security guard was just a random coworker that told Jimmy a CIA fly was circling him, Mike was sitting in a cubicle next to him and completely silent but annoyed, Jimmy never calls 911 or mentions a county in Illinois but stares at the alien, and because I woke up with him, the was no sign of Kim or his apartment. The last part definitely scared me when I woke up lol. I thought I had been abducted or something.
