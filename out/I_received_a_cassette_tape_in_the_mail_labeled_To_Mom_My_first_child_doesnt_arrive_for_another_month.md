Band-aids befouled with God knows what. Nail clippings rattling around inside plastic vials. When you’re a woman who’s even a tiny bit in the public eye, you come to expect some pretty weird shit showing up in the mailbox. Last year I received a literal human tooth, dull-shining inside a shroud of pinkened gauze. So you’ll understand if I don’t say where you’d know me from. My husband’s already begun his metamorphosis from bleeding-heart liberal to pro-gun liberal, and frankly I’d prefer it if he stopped there.    



Because this newest item... well, it out-weirds anything else we’ve received. And I just can’t imagine what kind of horror might be in transit to us next.    



It all started this afternoon when – let’s call him – Hubby returned from running errands with a shopping bag dangling from each hand, plastic handles spun tight around his wrists. “Did you get it?” I said, practically salivating as a lay on the couch, hands gripping the sizable baby belly that poked out from under my Bikini Kill t-shirt.     



He lay the bags on the kitchen counter, freeing his wrists, stood shaking the blood back into them. “If only I knew the kind of monster we were making...”    



“Less talk, Mister, more—”    



“More *this?*” And up from one of the bags came my newest fixation, the pièce de résistance of my pregnancy cravings: a bag of sweet chili Takis and a jar of gherkin pickles. Oh hell yes! He sat across from me at the coffee table as I sliced each pickle longwise and mashed into its flesh a mummified tortilla roll.    



“So you’re gonna...?”    



*Slice, slice.* “Uh-huh.”    



“And then you’re gonna...?”    



*Mash, mash.* “Oh yeah.”    



He’d learned, oh, seven months ago to just let me be. *Want a you-spawn romping around the house? This is the price, buddy boy.* So while I gorged, he occupied himself with the second shopping bag, which carried heavy in it the evidence of a different dark hunger – fan mail, a fresh batch of it straight from our PO box. He sorted it all out into piles. First, the normal mail (if you call writing a physical letter to a stranger in 2023 “normal”), your standard 4x9s squashed flat around the rectangle of the message inside. Next came the more peculiar stuff, your “nonstandards” if that makes it go down easier. Envelopes tattooed in art that would make H.R. Giger blush. Bulging with the tumor of the “““gifts””” inside. These were your solid 5s on the Creep Factor scale, where 1 is a postcard from Akron, Ohio and 10 is... well, 10 is the third and final type of parcel sent our way, the X-Files of fan mail, the dreaded bubble mailer. Handwriting neat. Stamps perfectly spaced. Address centered to the millimeter. Total psychopath type stuff. This was where your disturbing items resided. The eye-dropper bottle sloshing with white fluid. The twisted tendril of somebody’s shrink-wrapped underwear. And on this fateful afternoon...    



“Huh,” said Hubby, staring into the end of an opened mailer.    



“Uh-oh.” This around a mouthful of spicy-pickle-salty-crunch. “Is it weird? I bet it’s weird.”    



He didn’t even reply, only upturned the envelope over the coffee table, shaking it once, twice. Until out fell... *a cassette tape.* (Go ahead and Google that one, kids, I’ll wait.) The clear kind. Think, Maxell tape, the kind my big sis used to record Ace of Base songs off the radio with. Except even those still had Side A and B markings, a product name. This tape was completely transparent save for a narrow label across the top edge.    



“‘To Mom,’” read Hubby aloud, eyebrow slightly raised, a chuckle forming in his throat. Yet from own my angle, the cassette’s appearance was more striking, even a bit ominous. The label, though narrow, cast a shadow over the tape’s innards, leaving the white sprockets – which already resembled the hollows of a skull – pale yellow in the light of the living room. Sprockets wrapped tight with black tape so that they were like two eyes staring. And pulled taut from the outer reaches of each, a length of tape traveling down and around the plastic casing in a bend not unlike the outline of cheek bones. And ending where else but in a raised enclosure at the bottom of the tape braced left to right with plastic dividers, like a top row of teeth.    



So yeah, a bit ominous. But not so much that I didn’t still say it. Those Ten Words That Cursed Us: “*Please* tell me you have something to play that on?”     



Of course he did. If my flaw was dead-cat levels of curiosity, Hubby’s was his inability to let go of the past. A childhood game console gone smoker’s yellow, a flip phone warped from the battery expanding inside, the off-brand MP3 player binding inside it the ghost of some 2000s-era butt rock. And chief among those artifacts...    



“It’s here somewhere, I just know it!” came his muffled voice from the ceiling. He’d been searching the attic for the last half hour for it, “it” being his dad’s old cassette player. Which, like his dad, had the honor of traveling twice around the globe only to end up tossed in a box. However, while Dad’s box was in a cemetery in Witherred, Massachusetts, the one that held the cassette player was, presumably, and at best, a haven for spiders somewhere upstairs. Emphasis on somewhere. Our attic wasn’t even all that big and still I lay listening to the creak-cry of the ceiling as Hubby walked from spot to spot searching. *It would be so much easier to find,* I found myself wanting to yell out, *if you used any of that crap more than once in a decade.* But I learned a long time ago there’s no point in trying to talk somebody out of their nostalgia. There’s past and then there’s past past into the beyond.    



“*Got iiiiiit!*” he sing-songed from the ceiling above. It was about time. Minutes later, we were standing in the kitchen, each holding one end of an over-ear earphone to our heads, and he giving me that lifted-brow “You ready?” look.      



“Dude, my back *and* the suspense is killing me, let’s go.”     


 
His finger found the button. “Hold on to your butts...” he said. And he pushed Play.     



...    



......     



............     



Think, the sound a car window makes you stop just short of raising it all the way. That soft white hiss featureless as fresh snow. That was what I heard in the little speaker at my ear. The only thing there was to hear. I pressed my palm to my other ear to mask the whirring sound of the player on the counter, trying to hear anything else.    



“That’s a real letdown” Hubby said.    



“Got to be something on it,” I said.     



“You would think.” He slammed Stop. Fast-Forward. Stop again. Play.    



More nothing. And then a little more of it. When, half disappointed, half annoyed, Hubby reached for the Stop button once more. When...      


 
“Wait, I said,” grabbing his hand, “Listen.”     



“Listen what? It’s a bunch of noth─”      



His lips froze midway through the word. Yeah, he heard it. Same sound I was hearing, buried deep in the seeming zilch of the cassette, a faint─      



*Ka-khump,*     



*Ka-khump,*     



*Ka-khump.*     



Like not only did you not let the window up all the way, now you’re passing over a bridge, that faint thump of the tires as they cross from slab to slab. *Ka-khump. Ka-khump.*    



“The hell *is* that?” Hubby said, twisting the volume knob. I closed my eyes, listening to the sound as it grew louder and louder. The thumping. Imagined my time and place was its own blank tape. That I was standing in utter nothingness, listening for a world long past.      



When I had it. I looked to Hubby all wide-eyed. “You don’t recognize it?” He furrowed his brow listening, then shook his head no, a pitiful covetous no that wanted what you had. So I took his hand, placed it to my stomach. Watched his eyes as the realization spooled up there like tape on a sprocket.      



The sound was a heartbeat.     



************************     



“Hello, **[cute nickname for subscribers]**, it’s **[my name]** here! Just wanted to give you all a little update from our corner of **[state of residence]**. In case you were all beginning to wonder why it’s taking so damn long to complete our newest **[subscribed-voted project]**. Well...”     



And with that I tilted the camera down, frame dead center on the World’s Most Stupidly Preggo Belly, my t-shirt – now *Rosemary’s Baby* – pulled up enough to flash whoever might be watching that gnarled, toothless old-person mouth I’d been calling a belly button. Or *would be* flashing, if this were a livestream and not a recording to be uploaded later.     



“Say hello to... Haven,” I said, pausing to give myself space in editing to needle drop-in Temple of the Dog’s “Say Hello 2 Heaven.” I resumed, “Yeah, yeah, ‘heaven,’ not ‘Haven,’ I’m sure there will be a whole-ass war in the comments section about that little faux pas. But in the meantime, I wanted to let you all know that, if I suddenly disappear for a few weeks...”     



I trailed off, mind elsewhere. I’d been doing that all day, with enough frequency that Hubby had even brought it up at one point. “Some kind of late-pregnancy mind fog?” he wondered aloud, holding up a bottle of almond milk that was flop-sweat wet with condensation from being left out. I gave him my most shruggy “*Errdurnno*.”     



But the truth was... err*did*durnno. (Or at least err-*had-an-inkling*-durno.)     



It was the tape.     

 

The tape, the tape, the tape.     



I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Even now, forty-five minutes past midnight and sitting in front of the computer watching myself in silence watch myself in silence. I didn’t want to be recording an update for subscribers. Re-re-re-informing a bunch of randos that, *Hey, for like the fiftieth time, I’m head chef of “Baby on the Way” Bistro, so just chillax, yeah?* I only wanted one thing. A craving even pickle-buried Takis couldn’t satisfy. I could practically hear it now:      



*Ka-khump.*     



*Ka-khump.*     



*Ka-khump.*     



What a sound! While Hubby’s interest had quickly waned – “Huh,” he said, first with genuine curiosity, then with a zapped interest, “Huh” – I found myself rapt. Could only guess that it was the “expectant mother” aspect of it all. I was, after all, basically a human cassette player with a little thumping baby-tape in me. So this, this tape, it was ASMR for the expecting. A mantra for mommies. The Pied Piper for ultra preggos.     



And it was working.     



I clicked Stop on the video-recording software, pushed away from the desk, roller-chairing my way toward the partly closed office door. Peered out – at the dark hallway, the gloom-glow of the living room as a car growled by outside, and past all that at the kitchen dimly lit with cold moonlight. Narrowed my eyes at the counter there, searching for that shape I’ve become so familiar with in the last eight hours. The short silhouette of the cassette player lying on its back.     



Except, to my surprise, the tape door was standing wide open.    



I left the office for the hallway, roller-chairing my way toward the kitchen. That dull grind of the wheels on the hardwood as I propelled myself, from door trim to console table to dining chair and beyond. All toward that mysteriously open tape player. I crossed out scenarios in my mind. Could I have left it open without remembering? (And potentially lose the tape? No way!). Did Hubby wake while I was in the office and go snooping? (I mean, men get jealous, but of a piece of plastic? Come on!). Until finally I settled upon the only reasonable answer, this as I thrust myself the last remaining feet toward the counter: a bad latch. I mean, what else could it have been? We’re talking thirty-year-old equipment, slapped together with make-a-quick-buck haste. It’s not like the thing came alive and opened itself.     



I arrived still-seated at the counter. Found the cassette player not simply open, but that the tape was missing from inside. Curiouser and curiouser. A little unnerving even. I wheeled myself around the counter, eyes searching. But there was no sign of the tape at all. I even the checked the trashcan, finding nothing but the discarded mailer the tape came in. I took note of the return address: The Halfollow House, Lake Mire, Nunyasota.    



Nunya *where?* Nunya business, as Dad used to say. All that mattered was that the address was about ten minutes from where I was sitting at that very moment. That sent the scenario-seeking part of my mind into overdrive – what if someone had sent the mail to our PO box, then waited for my husband to come pick it up? Followed him home to our actual address? Or what if, I don’t know, the sender had sliced one of those radio chips into the bubble wrapping, tracked the package here like the news said people had been doing to steal cars? I shook away those thoughts. Ridiculous really, but that was the kind of thing that went through your mind when you were alone at one in the morning and things were not quite as you’d left them.     



And that was when I heard it, a creaking sound. Not like a footsteps-on-hardwood creak. Like something small being twisted, forced open. Something plastic.    



It was coming from the direction of the living room.    



I swiveled around in my chair, peering past the couch, the coffee table, the two-step ascension toward the master bedroom where its door stood closed like a sleeping eye. The sound continued. I got to my feet, stepping carefully, cautiously down into the living room proper, eyes prodding the half-dark as I wandered toward that groaning plastic sound. When...    



*Crack!* Sudden and distinct. Instincts beyond the maternal kicked in now as my mind pinpointed the sound, sent me moving quickly toward the far end of the couch, as if I were going to get the jump on someone. Except there was no someone. There was only a *something.* The tape cassette, lying on the floor, busted open. No, not busted. More like, *pried* open. Like you see in those nature docs sea otters will do with mussels. Except, and I don’t know about your home, but we tend to keep ours a “No Sea Otters Allowed” zone.      



I crouched down to look at the tape, though “tape” wasn’t really the right word to use anymore... The cassette *case* itself was empty now, the spools spun free at the touch of a finger. All the black tape that had been inside, that I had spent the day listening to, was simply gone.     



Crouched, staring dumbly at the tape, I became aware of movement. Corner of my eye, up top. My attention shot upwards to view the bedroom door, or the gap at the bottom of it rather, where I caught a glimpse – no more – of a shadow moving. Black, narrow, like a strip of nothing torn off night. Gone before I could even get a bad look honestly, much less enough to tell you what I saw. But like I said: my flaw was dead-cat curiosity. So I rose, heading up the two-step toward the bedroom door. As I approached, I heard a sound coming from inside. A kind of rustling, or faint scraping. Think, that lone leaf that goes sliding through a parking lot as autumn approaches.     



I gripped the door handle, turned it slowly. Slower. To keep whatever it was inside from getting startled. Or keep me from knowledge you can’t unknow just a bit longer. Whatever the reason, I held my breath as I went, as each centimeter on my end revealed the room foot by foot by foot.      



Until I saw it. And I mean “it.” It, it, it. Standing on Hubby’s chest, a kind of living shadow that rose and fall with his breath. But not flat like a shadow. It, this thing, had a density to it, dimension, like a puppet made from the very dark itself. Yes, a puppet, with two stubby legs and long arms like it could wrap around itself several times over. Except, as I approached the bed, still in shock at what I was seeing, I realized that these arms weren’t looking to wrap around itself – they were wrapping around my husband’s throat!     



“Hey!” I yelled, looking to my right for something to throw, anything. That framed photo there! I snatched it up, sent it flying and—     



“Wait, whoa!” my husband blurted out as the picture frame went sailing into the headboard. “What the hell are you doing?”     



In that moment I looked away, I lost sight of the shape. The thing. It. Vanished into thin air. “There was something on top of you!” I said, now throwing back the blankets, searching out the space on his side of the bed. Nope and nope.     



“What the hell are you talking about?” He sat up in bed watching me with shock as I got down on my hands and knees to look under the bed.     



“There was a... thing,” I said. “Like a shadow. It was on top of you. It was... I had heard a noise out in the living room, found that cassette tape busted open, the tape missing...”     



Hubby had me by the shoulders at this point, gently, but with urgency. “A shadow? Cassette tape? Babe, you’re having a dream, or maybe it’s—”    



“Oh don’t give me that hormone crap.” I pushed him away, started searching out the bed again. Hubby got up, head for the door into the living room. Was gone maybe fifteen, twenty seconds before he came back, something in his hand.     



“You mean this?” he said, and he held out the cassette tape. It was intact now, and not only intact, its spools were once again filled with tape. Seeing the tape got me thinking.     



“That’s what it was...” I said, mostly to myself at this point. “It wasn’t a shadow, it was tape. This tape. But it was... out. It wasn’t like this, it was...” ...Formed into shape like some kind of gruesome paper mâché, was what I was trying to say, but I was too busy inspecting the tape. Found that at its right lowermost corner, the screw was missing. I stuck a fingernail in, began separating the plastic halves.       
 


“Try to get some sleep,” he said, tossing the disheveled blankets back onto the bed, climbing back under them. “Please.”     



I let go of the two halves, stood looking at the tape. I knew what I saw, what that... thing was attempting to do. Would I have been next? Would I be next now?     



I went to closet, yanked back the shirts to reveal the safe, plugged in the code.      



“What are you doing?” Hubby said, without turning over.      



I tossed in the tape, shut the door, locked it. I climbed into bed knowing what I needed to do next. It was time to find out what the hell this Halfollow House was, and just how this cassette got from there to us.      


You can bet your ass I'll update you when I know more.
