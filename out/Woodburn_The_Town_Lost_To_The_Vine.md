2 years ago I lost my dad. I don’t think he’s dead, at least not necessarily. I think it's best I tell you exactly what happened, maybe then you can give me a solution to the deepening pit of anxiety and guilt within me.

 

My dad reminisced about his hometown a lot. He told me and my sister about how he was an only child raised by traditional parents, and how he would stay outdoors from dawn till dusk playing with his friends in the woods. His best friend Luke would accompany him on “scout missions” to the limestone quarry at the center. They’d watch from the upper ring laying on their bellies peering down into the spiraling void sharing a pair of binoculars with one of their eyes each in the adjacent lens only to be spotted shortly after and chased off the site by security. He was still annoyed about that fact, balling his fists or talking himself out of breath whenever he got to that part in the story.

 

My mom told us about how she met my dad at a summer camp and how he fell head over heels for her confessing his love after only meeting for a day. Giggling my mom gave him her family’s landline number which my dad called every day leaving messages complimenting her or asking about her day. They fell just as hard as each other since they married after a year of dating. This was after my dad’s world shattered. He told me and my sister that my grandparents died in a “freak accident”, as the detective put it. My dad was too young to comprehend the whole thing, and not alone figure out what to do with his inheritance. He never told me and my sister how our grandparents died, I suspected he didn’t know. I suspected that he rather wanted to move on and start a new life with my mom than wallow in his own tears in an empty house. They were happy, we were happy, but I think it ate away at him all those years. Wondering what happened. It wasn’t any surprise that when his childhood home made an appearance in a documentary about abandoned towns, we paid a visit.

 

“Why are we going back?”

 

“Well, son that documentary ignited a memory in me that I had long forgotten. There's a time capsule in the woods that me and Luke buried when we were younger. I don’t know, I guess just seeing it on the TV like that made me realize that it would never see the light of day again. I think it’s only right we’re the ones to do it. You’ll get to see where your old man came from.” He chuckled punching me lightly on the arm.

 

“Say, why do you think this place was abandoned to begin with? The documentary didn’t really make much sense.”

 

“Well if I had to guess, I suppose it has something to do with the quarry. Limestone isn’t as in high demand as it used to be. Suppose it just went bust and with funding being cut off from the rest of the town younger folk probably lost hope and left. Good luck convincing your elders that. They likely stayed and the town dwindled down over time to what it is today…. a ghost town. What do you think?”

 

I thought about his answer for a while watching the golden wheat fields passing us by. I couldn’t argue with him, and I told him that I agreed punching him back on the arm. It was quiet most of the way with my mum and sister deciding to stay home, but my dad liked to break the silence every now and again cranking up the radio and singing along at full volume as we barrelled down the dirt road. After 10 hours we finally passed the welcome sign of Woodburn. My dad’s eyes glazed over, any semblance of excitement or joy of coming back and leaving with it, as the grey wheat stalks came into view. Cracks littered the dry soil intertwining in hexagonal shapes like that of a fish’s scales. The grey clouds rolling overhead a light downpour of rain plastered the car’s windscreen as we neared the first row of houses, the dense greenery growing larger in the distance. Opposed to the evident signs of drought the wheat field endured, the village itself had become a botany hive mind. The front lawns were significantly overgrown to the extent that plants began to grow along the side of the house, and across the road leaving natural potholes as they tunneled beneath the tarmac.

 

“The plants will be getting a nice drink.”

 

My dad chimed trying to bring the atmosphere back to normal as the rain started to pick up. The low hum of the engine was the background music to our scouting mission as we crawled through the streets taking our time to avoid the stray roots that tunneled beneath the road. As we turned the third corner a car came into view held in mid-flip by thick veins that knotted around themselves enhancing the thickness to an impossible scale that seemingly attempted to prevent the car from crashing down on a patch of newly sprouted stems.

 

“Impressive what plants can do when left on their own ain't it?”

 

I nodded swallowing the lump in my throat as we slowly passed the wreck. Continuing down the street we turned onto a road that passed along the town square. The engine suddenly cut out with my dad clutching the keys in his hand as he stepped out of the car.

 

“You kidding me?! Alex get out here! It’s the town hall!”

 

I stepped out of the car, my dad already skipping over to the building without waiting for me. Slowly following him I was rooted to the spot taking in the spectacle before me. A gothic masterpiece made entirely out of limestone, arches, and pillars failing not to make the viewer think of the architectural genius of the Roman Empire, Now long forgotten with the earth taking it back. Vines wrapped tightly around each of the pillars leaving fissures and cracks for more to take root with the arrow-headed leaves making it appear as if the building underwent a siege.

 

As I entered the building, I found my dad already rummaging in a stack of drawers taking out papers and pens and examining them eagerly. The vines had already gained entry to the interior wrapping around the wooden chairs leaving some suspended and twisted in the air. This isn’t what caught my attention, however. Written on the board at the center of the stage were the crossed-out words “Fire, Chemical, Blockage” with the uncrossed word “Manual?” beneath them.

 

“Hey, Dad! What’s that?”

 

I said pointing at the stage. My dad turned his head following my finger locking eyes with the words with a confused look across his face before taking a short intake of breath to scoff.

 

“It’s probably a last-ditch effort to revitalize the quarry. Some sort of training program?”

 

I didn’t quite agree with him, but with no argument to suggest otherwise or opinion of my own, I lightly shook my head which he took as a sign of respect as a smile beamed across his face.

 

“Come on! Let’s get that time capsule, we’re not far now.”

 

Brushing past my shoulder, his footsteps echoing around the room as I turned to follow him. Left, straight, right, and then another sharp left turn straight in the middle of a path as my dad turned to face a thick bramble of leaves and thorns. Smiling he began folding and twisting his body around the branches scraping his arms a couple of times with a light trickle of blood forming at the back of his arms. I stood hesitantly observing the path he created, vaguely making out the blue sign “Public footpath” lodged within. Breathing a heavy sigh I embraced the orchestra of yelps and moans advancing in pursuit of the rose-tinted memories my dad held on to. By the time I made it through he was already on his hands and knees scraping away fistfuls of soil revealing a large tangle of intermingled root systems beneath that were shown no mercy as he yanked and severed their connections. Burying his hands further his elbows mere centimetres from being submerged he finally revealed a small black box as he began dusting away the grit with his hands.

 

“Alex come look at this!” He shouted in pure excitement, his laughter bellowing out through the trees.

 

He opened the box, rifling through countless pictures of him and his friends holding them up to me for my approval before burying his face back into the box taking out figurines and playing cards.

 

“Pretty cool Dad.” I said almost mockingly.

“Ahh, you wouldn’t get it. This stuff is rare these days, if you had any idea-“

 

“Hello”

 

Both spinning around in the dirt we stood face to face with a teenage girl who looked around my age. She had short curly brown hair with a few stray leaves which had become caught making it look like a bird’s nest. She wore a blue flannel shirt and skinny jeans, both caked in mud along with her brown boots which had become worn down by the rough terrain as leaves and stems hung aloft the many tears.

 

“You scared us!” My dad laughed breathlessly.

 

“Are you from Woodburn too?”

 

The girl slowly nodded, the leaves bouncing a little with the sudden movement.

 

“Us too, we’re just stopping by so I can show my son where I came from.” He said patting my shoulder reassuringly.

 

The woman didn’t respond as she continued staring at us with her green gloopy eyes. My dad went to speak before a rustle of leaves came from behind, averting our attention to our newest intruder.

 

“M- M- Mom?”

 

My dad froze, sweat trickling down his forehead, his legs shaking. An elderly woman emerged from the leaves wearing a white cardigan, brown trousers, and green wellies showing the same evident signs of wear and tear as the other women. Her pale thin skin stretched tight across her bones her pulsing veins stuck out prominently, the sunlight above making them appear a light green. She began stepping towards my dad her arms outstretched ready to embrace him. My dad on the other hand was a puddle of snot and tears, his constant trembling causing the box in his hands to rattle unendingly. Only a foot away from us now, the tightness of her skin around her skull had become more visible each shadow further sinking her features as they started to ripple in contort to her parting lips as long thick vines plummeted out of her mouth entwining themselves with the roots below pulling her face down to the earth as she endeavoured to advance. Her speed unfaltering the vines were pulled tight against the roots as her skin began to tear, the dark red flesh poking from beneath only to be overcome by more and more vines snapping out from her unhinged jaw releasing a putrid stench that stung my eyes making my head spin until I couldn’t take it and vomited directly on to her.

 

My heart was racing, my eyes bulging, my mouth felt sapped of moisture as I lost control of my body, and my legs took me further into the woods the screams of my father echoing behind. Tears streamed down my face blinding my vision I tore through a bramble of thorns skidding across the gravel and rolling to a stop just before the edge. Wiping my eyes, my heart pounding in my ears, my stomach sank as I gazed out at the open quarry its many levels spiraling down to a bottomless void. My hand shooting up to cover my nose, the smell of rot and spoiled vegetables invaded my senses as I spun my head blindly looking for the source. Slumped against a tree trunk was a thick entanglement of vines and leaves, the wet bone jutting out from within. The vines had completely taken over their body. Twisting themselves into a dizzying effect replacing the spilled-out intestines as more saplings took root pinning them to the ground as buds started to flower across the protruding ribcage into a thick array of petals that dug into their sockets in an explosion of vibrant colors. I gagged and heaved at the sight; my body unable to find anything else to throw up. Stumbling to my knees I knocked something sending it skidding across the gravel, my head raising to see as a plastic blue miner’s helmet come into view.

 

I couldn’t take it. People say that you don’t know whether you’re a fight, flight, or freeze until you have faced a situation where your mind physically can’t comprehend what you are seeing and senses immediate danger. I’m flight. A cowardly waste of space that left his dad in that place with those…things. I ran and I ran, and I ran stumbling over branches and vines and roots. I didn’t come across anyone else in those woods. When I made it back to civilization, I came across some friendly strangers willing to lend a hand. I made a report to rescue services about my dad, and they told me they conducted an aerial search, but that they couldn’t see anything through the greenery. They told me countless times that they were looking, but I knew they were all lies. I think they knew. I think they knew what had taken over that town and they were too ashamed to accept responsibility, and who am I to judge. I ran away from mine. My dad. I think about him a lot, especially now. This morning I came across something in my garden. I came across the arrow-headed leaves of that god-forsaken town. I don’t know what to do, and I’m terrified. I tried digging it up, but it came back tonight, and it's grown even more.
