I need help with something I can't explain!!

I don't know where to start but I'll tell what I'm remembering now, I'm not good at English either, so the article won't be smooth because I use google translate, hope you guys understand.

The story started 2-3 months ago, in a normal afternoon, maybe because I was a bit sleepy, I went to my room to take a short nap, I turned on sleep-friendly music with the sound of rain, kind of sleeping on car, after a while I fell asleep when I didn't know it, lying down for about 5-10 minutes I woke up but didn't open my eyes, kind of between a dream and reality, I felt like I was weighed down but not very uncomfortable, It feels like sinking.

I know it sounds like sleep paralysis but it's not because I've had sleep paralysis before and know what it feels like. While lying in that state, I still hear the outside sounds clearly and I can jump up at any moment, but I still lie there to see if something strange happens while holding back my saliva because when I concentrate I have a habit of swallowing saliva, but you see, I did, and almost woke up, but I still tried to close my eyes so I wouldn't have to get rid of the feeling.

In the chaos of colors, I felt like I was sitting on a chair and looking up at the trees with sunlight coming in even though I was in my room with the windows closed, and not only that, I saw The silhouette of a girl in a navy blue dress (can't remember exactly) was facing me, when I was about to turn back, the image faded and I opened my eyes to see how.
 
And nothing happened, I thought I was hallucinating or lucid dreaming but it didn't seem to be the case, I believe. And from that moment I fell into that situation more than in weeks, I often told my relatives and classmates but everyone didn't seem to believe it. 
Ah, I forgot to mention that when I fell into that state, at first I felt like I was in a trance, like lifting my hand, sitting up, but actually still lying down, but less and less until now.

And one day I don't remember what day it was, but that day was very special, like every other day, I still fell into the same situation as I mentioned above (Frequency is about once every 2-3 days, there are days in a row) but it is very other, I heard a melody like nah~na~na~na , it's hard to describe but I remember it well, every time I listen to it when I close my eyes I sink in, I hear whispering sounds like a broken TV.

But the vortex and some horror images like bald people but big eyes (perhaps because I was too bewildered so I imagined) and during that nap (most of them were at noon and afternoon, closer to 12 o'clock. at noon) I kept waking up and imagining the music and then falling back in again, a few times and then I couldn't do it anymore, I woke up both excited and scared, I googled and searched I found music by singing and I sang it again, the result surprised me when at the beginning of the three most relevant songs was Lana Del Rey's "say yes to heaven", with a match rate of 11%.

About 1-2 weeks before that day, I had the same thing, but it was before I went to school in the afternoon, I remember vividly that moment, I fell into that feeling as usual, and what I saw very clearly, someone's left eye was looking straight at me, whose eye is unknown but after a while I woke up and changed my clothes to prepare for gymnastics at school this afternoon, while running the elegant50 car went to school, I was caught in the eye by a small bug, fortunately I was able to rub it in time. 

A moment later I was collided with the car coming out of the alley, I fell down, but the school bag supported my back. mine so I was fine, just a little dislocated, so I had to go home and miss school that day.

I know this story has been very long and rambling, I just want anyone who has experienced or understands what happened to me, please explain to me, and the reason for writing this article is because I suddenly remembered the song." say yes to heaven" and I went to find out the number 11 and knew that it was also an angel number so I was curious, and my frequency has also decreased more, while feeling that life is gradually returning as well.

But i still want to know what is the explanation for this phenomenon, thanks for reading and the above is absolutely true!
