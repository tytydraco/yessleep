It was dark; the room in which I awoke was dark, not deep enough for nothing at all to be seen but dark enough for my eyes not yet to be adjusted correctly. As I looked down at my body and the ground beneath me to figure out where I had ended up, a large flash of light occurred, leading to my slowly adjusting eyes to restart progress. It was now that all I could see was pitch black; with the lack of my sense of sight, I could hear slightly better. There was a hum or somewhat of a buzz I could hear clearly now; it led me to think that that flash of light a few seconds before was most likely the dimming in and out of a lightbulb or light fixture. The sound etched itself into my ears at the very specific tone I know I hate now. Such a sound that it felt like it was a knife slowly etching its marks into my brain. It was in these thoughts that my eyes started to slightly adjust better; I could now see the faintness of a wall in front of me that I was inferring was there based on the physical presence I could feel. I was able to finally get up off the ground and lean my hands onto the wall; it was in this moment that I realized how weak I felt. Getting off the ground felt like a battle in a war I was slowly losing, and I began panting as if running a mile. 

I leaned onto the wall and looked behind me to become more aware of my surroundings. With my back against the wall and the pitch black in front of me still, with the buzzing etching itself into my ears more and more, I tried to take my mind off things while my eyes adjusted. I already knew I was in sort of a dangerous situation at the moment, so freaking out and letting my thoughts race while I could do nothing was pointless. But it was in my wandering thought that I realized I don't remember who I am. My name, date of birth, background, anything. Because of my lack of physical ability, I could be 60 years old for all I know, but I quickly rescind that theory, touching the smooth skin of my arm to check. 

My eyes were finally adjusting more to the dark space, and I could somewhat see the outline of the room I had found myself in. It seemed like I was in a small room that was just a square of space; I could not yet figure any way out or anything to help with the light of the room. To me it still just seemed I was almost in a blank square with no doors, windows, or light switches. As I was looking around a bit more, I saw it. Something in the rightmost corner from me, seeming to only be about 12 feet away or so. It was some kind of figure; my heart sank, and I stood still. It was dark, so if I couldn't see it, maybe it couldn't see me, or maybe it was facing away; it was still too dark for me to tell. My fear was skyrocketing, but I tried to keep calm. I keep calling this thing an “it” because although it had a humanoid shape, it was no human; it was something different, something more grotesque. 

My face was pale, and I felt its presence in the room more than ever now. How had I not noticed it before? It was definitely some sort of living creature; I could feel it, but wouldn't a living thing make some sort of noise that I could hear in such close proximity? But then I realized, looking around the room, I could see slightly better and see the shape of mostly everything but not in great detail. I looked and looked with my head quickly moving back to the figure over and over in fear of it moving, and I realized there were no lights in the room, there were no light switches, nothing. Relative to me, I had been hearing where that buzzing was coming from the entire time, that buzzing that was slicing itself into my ears louder and louder. It wasn't just my annoyance of the noise that was getting it louder; it was this thing, getting it louder and louder. Now I was sure it wasn't human. 

With this realization, I jumped and nearly hit my head on the wall behind me as my eyes finally adjusted to see the glint of its eye. It was looking directly at me. As its face entered my eyes more and its sound cut into my ears deeper, I nearly wanted to cry. I could feel tears welling, and I was shaking. Its face, its fucking face. I don't know if I've ever seen anything more horrifying. Its pale skin, its soulless eyes, its grinning mouth. This thing was entering my vision more and more. I could see the grotesqueness of its body. It had no amount of clothing on, even though it seemed like a creature human enough to need it. Its frail form brought me no comfort; whatever this thing was, it wasn't any of what I knew. I know I couldn't remember myself, but I can remember things: what a human looks like, what other animals look like; this wasn't any of it. As much as it seemed to be getting louder with its buzzing and its grin seemed to be getting slightly wider, I couldn't see a modicum of movement of its body at all. What kind of thing was this? My head was splitting. Too many questions as to the nature of this thing. 

The buzzing was getting ear-piercing; it was painful now. It wasn't my imagination making this sound louder. I looked to the left of it and finally saw the door to this room. Of course it was in the corner right next to this thing though. My body was struggling to move at all. 

“Should I run to it?” I thought, “Should I stay?”

I had too many questions. My body was frozen, so no matter what I wanted to do, I was on the ladder option for now. The buzzing was getting louder; my head was starting to feel like it could implode from the inside; it was excruciating; at any moment, it felt like my head would almost pop. It was a bassy, loud buzz that stayed consistent and wouldn't stop. I was in pain, thinking it was over for me for certain, but then its eyes blinked and a flash of light filled the room for only a second. It was quiet again. All I could hear was the ringing of my own ears. I once again was standing there against the wall. With no other option in my head, my body acted on instinct; I ran in the direction I knew the door was in, right next to the creature. With my shoulder ahead of me, I banged into a holo surface that was surely the door. I heard the creature screech and felt the wind of its fast movements behind me as I shuffled my hand as fast as I could to find the doorknob. Its screeches were the loudest thing I had heard out of it yet. It slashed into my ears like large machetes. I finally grabbed the doorknob, but on my way to opening the door, I felt its scratch upon me. It didn't cut too deep, but it made me bleed. The space in front of the door was bright, but all I could do was run with my eyes closed as I heard the screech slowly fade away. It seemed that the creature couldn't escape that room. I ran and I ran, but then I tripped.

I could barely move; I felt the soil beneath me. I opened my eyes and adjusted much quicker this time. I was outside in a field; there were roads around me; I was in civilization. In that moment of realization, I remembered where I was, who I was. I stood up slowly, still feeling weak. I looked around and figured out what I was doing last. I was just in a cafe; how I got here, I don't know. But my ears still rang, my shoulder still hurt, and there was still a large gash in my arm, right where I felt that thing leave it. I was roughened up; I was wearing the red sweater I love to wear, and my jeans were covered in dirt now. I got my phone out of my pocket to check things, where exactly I was, maybe an explanation to what had happened through videos and… the time. It was only 11:57am. I could now remember that the last time I checked the time in that cafe, it was 11:55am. As I walked to the sidewalk near me to take a seat on the ground, I checked my location and saw that I was 30 minutes by car away from the cafe I was at. There is no physical way for me to be here in this moment right now. I know I spent more than just 2 minutes in whatever hellscape I had just found myself in too. What is happening? 

So I just got home; I had to have my mom pick me up. I promised her I would explain this later, and so I have to do that later. But for now I'm using this to write out my experience. Does anyone here know why something like this would be happening to me? There can't be any hallucinations here; there are too many impossibilities. I just can't get that fucking thing out of my head; its face is still haunting me. I am scared to go to sleep tonight. What if I end up in that place again tonight? And even if I find a way to escape, what if I'm thousands of miles away this time? I just want answers. 

If anyone needs to refer to me in the comments, my name is Kali.
