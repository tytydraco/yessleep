It was a hot summer night, and I was getting ready to sleep when my phone rang. I walked over to the table and saw it was my chief. I picked it up, but before I could say anything, his voice blasted through the speaker:

**“We’ve got a report — a family is drowning. Get to the beach. Now.”**

Then the call ended.

I tossed the phone onto my bed, yanked on my lifeguard shorts, and sprinted out the door. I jumped in my car and floored it. In five minutes, I was at the beach.

My colleagues were already there. I could hear screaming — voices coming from the sea. Without hesitation, the chief pointed and told us to go in. I didn’t hesitate. I ran straight into the water.

The sea was pitch black. Wavy. Cold. The kind of cold that hits you so hard your brain blanks out. My colleague Charles was beside me as we swam toward the sounds. The waves kept slamming into us. We could barely catch a breath between them.

We hit a short calm. Just a few seconds.

“Can you hear it, Charles?” I shouted.

“No!” he yelled back.

“What do we do?”

“Keep swimming toward the noise!”

So I dunked my head and kept going. The last place we’d heard anything — we had to get there. But another massive wave hit us. Hard. I was underwater longer than before, and when I surfaced, gasping—

Charles was gone.

“Charles!”

“Charles, where are you?!”

I shouted again. And again. But there was nothing. No sound. Just water and waves.

As long as Charles was with me, I wasn’t scared. But now? Alone in the dark sea, being thrown around like a ragdoll by invisible walls of water? I felt small. Helpless.

I had no idea what direction to go. But I couldn’t just float there. So I swam — blind, desperate, toward where I thought the voices had come from.

Then, out of nowhere, my hand slammed into something.

I pushed my face above the water, breathing hard. I reached out and clung to whatever I’d hit. My hands searched — and found skin. A neck. A face.

**A person.**

I grabbed the body and turned it, praying it wasn’t Charles.

The first thing I saw was the foam — thick and white, bubbling from his mouth, slipping down his chin like the ocean was trying to crawl out of him.

His skin was pale. Lips turning blue. His face swollen and stiff.

I turned him gently, afraid of what I’d see — praying it wasn’t Charles.

His eyes were open. Staring straight at me. Unmoving.

For a moment, I didn’t recognize him. His face looked wrong — twisted by fear, the water, the cold.

Then I saw it. The curve of his jaw. The scar under his right eye.

**Mike.**

My arms locked up. I couldn’t breathe. He wasn’t moving — not blinking, not flinching, not even drifting. Just foam pulsing from his mouth in little spurts, like the sea still lived inside him, trying to force its way out.

He looked like he was still watching me. But there was **nothing behind his eyes**.

I wanted to say his name. I wanted to shake him, to scream, to do *something*. But all I did was stare.

Then a wave slammed into us.

And he was gone.

I spun around, looking. Screaming his name. But there was nothing left. Just me, and water, and darkness.

I was alone. Again.

I didn’t know where the beach was anymore. Didn’t know if I was swimming farther out. I couldn’t hear anything.

Couldn’t think. I just floated there. Silent. Accepting.

Then — a sound.

A horn.

I snapped my eyes open. A light was moving along the shoreline.

**The ATV.** Our beach vehicle.

I don’t even remember thinking — I just swam. My muscles were dead, but something kicked in. Survival instinct, maybe. I swam until my body hit the sand.

On the beach, I saw a child lying motionless. Two of my colleagues were crouched over him — one doing chest compressions.

I stumbled forward. My knees gave out and I dropped to the ground.

One of them ran to me.

“Edward! Where’s Charles?! He was with you!”

“Did you see Mike? Mike’s missing!”

I couldn’t speak. I just stared at the sand. My whole body was shaking.

Another teammate grabbed me by the collar and shouted in my face.

**“Edward, what happened?! Where are they?!”**

I slowly looked up at him.

“Mike is dead.”

Everyone froze.

Two of them ran over.

“What do you mean? Did you see him?”

I nodded.

“Charles was with me. A wave split us up. I called for him, but he never answered.”

I collapsed onto the sand again. One of them shouted, “We have to go back! We can’t leave Charles out there!”

But no one else moved.

No one even said no.

They just stared out at the sea — blank-faced. Like they knew we’d barely made it back ourselves.

I laid there, letting the cold sand press into my skin. I’d lost two friends. And I hadn’t saved a single life tonight.

There was nothing left to do but wait.

Wait for dawn.

Or for their bodies to wash ashore.

The sea didn’t take all of us.

Just enough to remind us it could.
