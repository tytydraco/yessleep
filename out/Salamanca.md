Max was the one who got the idea, he wanted us to hike up the Salamanca mountain together to welcome Daniel and Mateo to town.

Trekking up Salamanca is kind of a local tradition, nowadays there's more to do in town but a few years back racing to the top of our little hills were most of what kids could do around here, it was either that or the beach, the stone beach with its unhealthy amount of broken glass, scrap metals and crack dealers that are also less present nowadays. 

Now, from all the hills we had Salamanca was different, it's not that big but it is the only one in town big enough to be actually considered a mountain. Well, it's actually a few kilometres out of town but the point remains. For the children reaching its peak, accompanied by an adult of course, meant being one of *the cool kids*, for example I climbed it with my father and my uncle when I was twelve, never tried it again since then but I remember bragging with the other kids and being the coolest girl for a few weeks, but eventually everyone climbs Salamanca. It seemed just fair that the new guys would have to experience that too so I, and everyone else, accepted the invitation.

Not everyone in the group could drive so we had to arrange for some of us to pick up the others, in my case just one, Miguel.

That morning I did just that, asked for my dad's car and droved right up to Miguel's house. He didn't answer my messages so I had to get out of the car and knock. Maria, Miguel's mother greeted me on the door.

"Hi Ami, how you doing sweetie?"

"Hi Maria, is Miguel awake? We had plans for today."

"Yes, he's taking a bath. Come in, I made cookies."

Miguel and I had known each other since kindergarten, in a way his mother was my friend too. Anyway, after a few minutes of waiting Miguel was finally eating slash devouring his breakfast with us.

"Why the hurry dumbass? We're still early," I told him while he was attacking 2 cookies at once.

"We still have to pick up Cash." he responded with his mouth still full

"We what?"

"His dad needs their car so I told him we would get him."

"You what!? I don't want him in my car!"

"Well don't pick him up then." he said without taking his eyes off the food.

"I can't do that now idiot!"

"Language," Maria interrupted from a different room.

"Sorry. Well I guess we're late then, grab your stuff, we're out, goodbye Maria, loved the cookies."

It took us around ten minutes to get to Cash house, time that I fully spent reminding Miguel that he doesn't get to invite misogynistic idiots into my car.

When we reach the house Cash's car was still right outside, meaning his father was still in there. I wanted to avoid any interaction with the bigger idiot so I sent Cash a message and just waited on the car playing tongue twisters with Miguel, but after some minutes and the humiliation of *Peter piper peed a pet* he got tired of waiting without a response and got out of the car to knock on the door, almost immediately after Cash came out wearing sunglasses, shorts and a tank top, carrying a thermos and an unnecessarily big backpack, saluted Miguel with a bear hug and walk to the car screaming.

"Hey Ami! Thanks for the rescue princess, you can go to the passenger sit now."

"I can still leave you here if you want," I replied hoping he would take the offer.

They got in the car laughing like idiots. I'll save you the twenty minutes drive to Salamanca, most of that was Cash making dick jokes anyway. When we reach the meeting place there were two cars waiting already.

"Why did you drive that crap here? You know you can ask me for a lift Max," I joked trough the window as I was entering the parking lot. Max's car was a old fiat 147 his father bought him for his birthday, the thing runs on hopes, dreams and no seatbelts, not the car you should drive on a gravel road, or any road honestly.

"I prefer not being late thanks." Max quickly answered as if offended for the insult to his precious car.

"You know that's not my fault." I replied.

"Sup beauties, sorry for the waiting" Cash said as he got out of the still moving car. He fisted pump Lucas and Ramiro, then *friendly* punch Max in the shoulder as hard as he could and all of that fast enough to get back to the car right as I stopped it just to open my door and make a reverence.

"Oh Lucas, save me from this gorillas please," I cried before giving Lucas two cheek kisses and a hug.

"Don't worry girl, you're safe know," Lucas responded compassionately.

"You're the one who chooses to hang out with us mrs. *Not Like Other Girls*," Ramiro, Lucas's boyfriend said.

"I don't like you," I joked.

"So when are the newbies coming?" Cash asked.

"They said they're on their way, shouldn't take too much," Max answered.

"Wanna play truco in the meantime? I have cards," Cash offered while searching on his backpack.

"Sure, Miguel you're on my team."

Thankfully Daniel and Mateo arrived before Cash, Lucas and I got obliterated thirty to one on our truco match. Those two had recently became friends with Ramiro and Max since they all played on the same soccer team and the rest of us decided they were nice enough to be welcomed into the chat group a few weeks after they met.

They parked their car next to mine and join the group, the greetings were less chaotic since we were still on a *try not to scare them off* phase. Except for Cash of course, he couldn't help being his regular loud self.

"Finally men, you can't just leave the ladies waiting like this! Ain't that right Miguel!" He exclaimed in what I guess was meant to be a British accent.

"Come here and show your cards already." Miguel replied annoyed.

"S-sorry, w-we lost the keys, but thanks for waiting for us, I'm really exited to do this!" Mateo was usually shy and barely talked at all, hearing him say that many words in a row was surprising.

"Hey Mateo, did you put on the sunscreen like I told you?" Daniel's words made a huge contrast with his heavy metal t-shirt, piercings and tattoos, but he was always very protective of his little brother, so it wasn't very surprising to hear him speak like that.

After some more chatting and making sure we had everything we needed we finally started the trekking.

The mountain was mostly filled with green and yellow dry bushes and cuises (cute small tailless rodents). To access it you must first walk up the *Sombrero* hill and then go down a little canyon, from there there are three paths you can take, the easy path, the hard path, and *los arenales* which is supposed to be taken only on the way down since the slippery sand makes it really hard to climb, I know that because my dad allowed me to choose a path the first time I climbed it and that's the one I picked, *not making that mistake again.*

All of my friends had climbed Salamanca too, and none of us used the easy path before, so this time we decided we were going to explore that one on the way up and go down through *los arenales*.

The easy path was, as expected, easy. The views were still beautiful, the hills all around us were so green it felt as if they were covered by one single thick layer of grass and not the giant prickly bushes that we all knew were there. There were guanacos (llamas with shorter hair) running on the distance with such an elegance that felt mechanically impossible, one of them even got really close to us at some point, sadly it did not spit at Cash when he tried to touch it. The best, of course, was the peak, someone had put two long metal bar with two bricks on the sides there to simulate a chair, I have no clue how they brought that 580 meters up but I was not going to complain, so either way I took a seat and enjoyed the cold breeze of pure air on the perfect position to watch the sea appear beyond the hills while the aguiluchos (tiny eagles) flew so close to us we could almost touch them. That was beautiful, that was peaceful.

That was until Cash tried to hit one of the poor birds with a rock.

"Hey stop that jerk," I demanded.

"I'm just having fun Ami, I'm not actually gonna hit 'em."

"You are actively aiming dumbass, and you could hit someone else."

"Oh come on just have fun for once, why you're always like this?"

"Just leave the birds alone dude, is not the big deal," Lucas said in my support.

"I'm not aiming at them Luc!" Cash protested.

"It's still dangerous muscle brain," Daniel pointed out. Cash immediately looked at Max and Ramiro searching for allies.

"Yeah, I'm not arguing with them man," Ramiro responded to his glance as to walk out of the situation.

"Just stop bro, you might hit someone," Max sighted.

"Who?! A ghost?! There's no one here guys!!" Cash exclaimed with his arms extended as to point out the lack of anything.

At that point, Miguel appear from behind me caring a rock on his hands and suddenly throw it as far as he could.

"HA! Mine got further!" He laughed.

"My turn!" Mateo joyfully said, jumping from his seat.

"Mateo!!" His brother yelled.

"What? I won't aim at the birds, and he's right, there's no one here besides us."

"See, they get it, hey Miguel I bet you can't reach the sea from here! But with a real rock this time, that one was too tiny!" Cash challenged Miguel ignoring the whole previous discussion.

*God, you're so insufferable!* I wanted to say but got immediately interrupted by Miguel.

"I can reach your mother from here if I want to," at least he was having fun.

"Hey! My car is in that direction, don't throw that far!" Max protested.

"It's not YOUR car that worries me," Lucas joked.

"Whatever, there's no way they are reaching it," Ramiro added.

"I don't care, aim the other way!" Max insisted in desperation.

"Heard that boys! Mom gave us permission!" Cash celebrated with a big dumb smile.

"Oh just let us enjoy the silence for a second," I cried in exhaustion.

"Hey Cash, I-I bet you can't reach even that spot with this rock," Mateo challenged.

"Oh you don't now me very well huh!" He answered. It was a very big rock, and it seemed to be heavy too, I still don't know what the *spot* was supposed to be, I just ignored them and asked Max to shared his earphones to listen to some relaxing music, at least they really weren't aiming at the birds this time, at least the scream that answer wasn't a bird.

"Shit." Cash muttered as he got paled.

"You absolute idiot!!!" I erupted in anger, red as a volcano.

"Who was that?!" Daniel questioned before yelling to his brother. "Mateo come back here!!"

"Aren't we all here?" Max asked to no one in particular.

"That's not one of us," Miguel replied.

"Oh god you fucking kill someone!" I continued to yell.

"Fuck me, I'm sorry," Cash cried regretfully.

"Calm down they might be fine," Lucas attempted to cool us down.

"I'm sorry!!! Are you Ok!?!" Cash screamed as loudly as he could to the unknown hiker.

"Of course they're not gorilla, you hit them with the biggest rock you could find!!!" I answered him instead.

"Hey I said I'm sorry!" Cash victimized himself.

"Yes, we heard you," Max responded as to ignore him.

"Do you need help?!!!" Miguel yelled on his knees at the top of his lungs to the mountain bottom.

"Why do you never listen to me?!" I argued.

"Can you fucking stop already! I said I'm sorry!" Cash protested.

"I'm sorry I–" Mateo said in a mutter.

"Shut up Mateo," His brother demanded.

"Do you need help?!!!" Miguel tried again.

"You're the biggest most annoying idiot I have–!" I rambled.

"Ami, stop!" Ramiro interrupted me.

"Me! He's the one who hit someone with a fucking rock!!"

"Calm down guys this is not the time for this." Lucas once again tried to stop the argument.

"No I think it's–!!" Cash started.

"Guys they're not answering!!" Miguel stopped him preoccupied.

...

"Fuck, I'm sorry, we should go check," Cash apologized.

"Right, sorry... but how?" I asked.

"What do you mean how?" Mateo asked back looking as confused as Daniel. They seemed to be the only ones who didn't immediately notice.

"He threw the rock west, there's no path down west," Max explained.

"Oh..."

"Well, we're not just leaving them right?" *Right*.

To give you some perspective, usually the way down can take up to an hour, but if you go down from *los arenales* the sand takes you down like a slide saving up to 30 minutes. It took us more than 2 hours to get to the bottom. To be fair we spent a lot of time searching for what was probably a recent corpse, but the bushes didn't made us any favours, I ended up with cuts all around my legs and arms, and I was still looking better than most of the boys, Cash kept trying to push the bushes out of the way, Miguel felt face first into the ground after attempting a very stupid jump and Lucas stepped on a rock that slipped taking him down a few meters on his butt.

As we got closer to the bottom we decided to spread to cover more ground and eventually it worked out, I saw Mateo waving to me from the distance, I called for Miguel making a similar gesture and started running towards Mateo.

I was getting ready for so much possibilities. I did not expected a cave. Once I got close enough I asked Mateo where was the guy and he just pointed at the blood trail that went inside the cave and into the darkness. It took me a little bit to start talking.

"How can a clay mountain have a cave?"

"Well.. it's not all just clay, we are almost at the base, there has to be more rock here I guess." Mateo answered me.

"What the fuck?" Miguel's confusion made itself visible on his face as he arrived.

"Yep," was all I could add.

"Maybe it's man made" He considered.

"Why?" Mateo asked.

"I don't know, if it's natural it should have collapsed with the rain right?"

"Maybe..." Mateo said, yet he didn't seemed satisfied with that argument.

Cash didn't say a word once he arrived, he just walk right into the cave so fast that we didn't react in time to stop him, a few seconds later he came out.

"There's rock inside," he told us as he came out.

"That's claystone, it's still not safe to go in," I refuted.

"Nope, it's actual rock, the floor, the walls, everything. Looks like a different mountain."

"Ha... weird," Mateo muttered.

"Just give me a flashlight, I'll go find them myself," Cash demanded.

"What the fuck?! No you're not going that's clay!" Lucas told him as he joined us.

"He says there's rock inside," I explained.

"Well I have to see it," Miguel decided.

"No, it's dangerous, just let me..." Cash attempted to stop him.

"Shut up Cash." He interrupted him annoyed.

Miguel turn on the flashlight on his phone as he walked in, it was true, just at the point where the darkness cut our vision off the floor started to reveal a grey and white rocky floor, rocky walls, and a rocky roof, yet the roof didn't go all the way out so the mystery of how did the clay surface of the mountain didn't fall covering the entrance still remained, but the boys didn't seem to care much, Daniel didn't hesitate once he arrived and saw Cash, Miguel and Lucas inside.

"Mateo you stay outside," he ordered.

"But...!".

"Go with her, find a place with phone signal and call and ambulance okay," he added.

"Ok, come on Mateo he's right," I replied.

We surrounded the mountain to get to the canyon faster, no signal, we tried the sombrero hill no signal, we tried the parking lot, we even tried just walking around holding our phones up like imbeciles, we got nothing. Once we gave up we decided to check up with the boys, maybe they found the person and needed some help to carry them back into the cars, maybe they had already given up too.

We reached the cave surprisingly fast this time, Ramiro was there waiting for us, which meant Max was also inside.

"So the weaklings wait outside I guess," I joked.

"It's been more than an hour Ami," Ramiro answered worried.

...

"Did you get the ambulance," he continued.

"No, we couldn't find any signal," Mateo explained.

"Ok, I'll go in," Ramiro decided.

"No, wait, we should get some help," I opposed.

"And how long until that? Two more hours? I don't care if a random stupid hiker dies but my man's in there Ami, and your friends too!"

"I'm going too," Mateo agreed.

"Fuck, ok, but we move slow, if they're stuck we don't want to end up the same," I said, still not fully convinced of this idea.

The inside was, as Cash said, solid rock, no clay, no sand, just rock all around us forming an almost perfect semi-cylindrical straight hall angled down. We had our phones as flashlights but the light didn't reach the end of the tunnel.

For a while the path was just that, rock after rock, there where some sidetracks but we knew what direction they went, we just had to follow the blood path right on the middle. Then the blood stopped, and just a few meters after, laying on the floor there was a rosary. I knelled down to inspect it.

"What?" I whispered.

"Who brought that?" Mateo asked.

"Just leave it," Ramiro demanded.

"It's probably from the hiker, or maybe it was here before," I hypothesised.

"If it was here before they came in, w-why did they kept going?" Mateo inquired.

"Because there's a bleeding person who's probably hallucinating from the blood loss and might have lost that while wondering, neither Cash nor Max would get scared from something like that," Ramiro pointed out.

"And Miguel wouldn't turn back before them," I added.

"Just forget about it, it's nothing," Ramiro told him as to calm him down.

I choosed not to tell them about the sticky liquid on the crucifix.

Without the blood trail I began to leave some cookie scrums to guide us up, yet the path didn't bifurcate, at least not before a new obstacle made my simple plan useless. We reached water.

The path stopped going down at the point were the water reached just a few centimetres above our ankles, it was cold but we kept going. Then we finally reached a fork in the path, three tunnels.

"I'll take the right one," Ramiro decided.

"What? No! We're not dividing!" I complained.

"You think they didn't?" He refuted.

"I..." *I know the probably did*.

"Keep your right hand on the wall," Mateo proposed.

"What?" Ramiro asked.

"That way you won't get lost, your right on the way in, your left on the way out. I'll take the centre one."

"I... fine, but we meet up here in ten minutes okay," I demanded. They both agreed, I went left. 

I don't know for how long I walked. I set an alarm on my phone to ring after five minutes but it never did, and it really felt like I had walked for more than five minutes, more than twenty even. Eventually I realized the water level was getting higher, I figured the path was still going slightly down, just at such a slow phase I didn't notice. I decided to check my phone to make sure I had actually set the alarm, the second I turn on the screen I got a “low battery” sign and the flashlight went off, at that point in complete darkness all I could see was the shining screen with those big numbers on the centre. One thirty A.M. More than ten hours had passed. Then the screen turned off.

I was scared, I couldn't understand why I was there any more, I love my friends but getting under an unexplored flooded cave? Alone? I was hyperventilating, I wanted to cry, I regretted everything, I was shaking and the cold water now above my knees felt so uncomfortable it only fed my anxiety. I tried to calm down, breathe for a while but the humid air wouldn't let my brain be at peace, I turned on the phone screen once again, then came the smell.

It was the most disgusting smell I felt in my life, like if the water I was walking on was nothing but a mixture of burning rotting eggs, asthma and brownish green, not like I could see if it was green, but the smell told me it was, at least that's what my paranoid brain figured. I wanted to puke blood but I needed to get out of there as fast as I could so I quickly search for the flashlight option on my phone and I turn it back on ignoring the low battery alert, then while still looking down I stretched my arm to find the wall, it was not there, I move the flashlight to my left but the clouds of dust or steam or whatever it was blocked the light before I could find any walls at all. I was lost.

I figured all I had to do was to turn back and run as fast as I could so I did, but as I turned around I almost died when I saw people right in front of me, then I almost smiled when I realized who they were. Miguel was unconscious, bleeding from the head while Cash was holding him by the shoulder. I cried at that point but the tears where of happiness, not because I thought they could save me, but rather because I wasn't alone any more.

"Guys!"

"We told you to stay out," Cash said.

"I-I'm sorry, I..."

"Doesn't matter, help me, there's no time," He interrupted.

I quickly grabbed Miguel from the other side and we started walking.

"Why did you walk this deep?!" I questioned.

"It looked safe." Cash answered.

"What?! The water's on our hips Cash!"

"It wasn't before. It's raising Ami, you've noticed that by this point."

"Where's Miguel's flashlight?" I continued.

"Lost it."

"What's that smell?"

"Keep walking," He ordered.

"What happened to him?"

"Just keep fucking walking Ami!" As he said that he let go of Miguel and turned back, I stopped for a second to ask him what was he doing, before I could speak I saw the source of the smell.

It was a goat, or rather it resembled one, but sadder, its head was bigger than my torso and it had four twisted horns each one looping on different dimensions but all of them pointing forward, the neck was connected to a big rug of white wool filled with what seemed to be shit and blood, it had no limbs, it just floated with most of it's body out of the water but the thin hairs that where underwater seemed to stretched forever into the depths. Following it there was an army of red, green and yellow flies each the size of a thumb. I didn't hesitate, I left Cash behind, felt bad for that, but he told me to keep walking and so I did.

I heard him struggle against the thing behind me, now and then there would be a big crash that would make me think Cash had finally lost, but then I would hear him scream and curse once again. As I kept on moving the sound decreased, and so did the smell. But eventually the sounds stopped, cutting one of Cash's screams mid sentence with a last bang of rock hitting rock. No more screams, no more crashes, Cash was dead. I looked at Miguel, he wasn't breathing, I envied him for not being part of this any more, I felt sorry for his mother and for what I was about to do, I needed to get out, so I left his body behind.

I ran for what felt like minutes but I was sure where hours, the smell was once again catching up with me and the water was now on my chest. Desperate to move any faster I tried swimming but I've never learned how so that only slowed me down and broke my phone. Running in the darkness under the cold water wasn't taking me anywhere, when I reached a dead end for the third time the smell was so strong I could tell that thing would catch me at any second, so I looked down at the water, and I knew in my soul there was something in the water looking right back at me. I took a moment to breathe, to relax, I didn't wanted a stressful death. Then, once the first flies hit my back, I released all the air from my lungs, and submerged.

As I breathe in I felt the cold water go inside my lugs, yet I was still breathing. At first I was afraid to open my eyes, but when I did I was no longer on the cave, or maybe I was, just looking from a different angle. All around me were an infinite amount of stars and right in front of me was a woman. She was wearing a dark green cloak, her skin was pale as the snow, her lips dark as the night and her gold eyes shined under the shadow of her hood. She was carrying Miguel's body, looking at him, she seemed... angry? No, not angry, more like annoyed, confused.

"Curious choice isn't it? We might partially comprehend it, but we will never truly do. Maybe I could if it was the other way around, couldn't I? Maybe my wording might be wrong then. Maybe we are never to understand what we are not, so maybe there never was a decision to be taken, correct?" Her expression softened as she looked at me expecting me to answer, I didn't. "Curious response that was. If anything, sorry for your loss, but he was never meant to be here, but you might, will those legs decide to walk this path again if you ever are curious? I can't promise it will be easier, but if you are curious enough nothing will stop you, and I might know thy answer" As she finished her sentence a big childish smile appeared on her face, as if she had just accomplished something, as if she was proud of herself.

Then I heard a different voice behind me, and older woman, I know what she told me, but I still can't put it into words.

I woke up in my bed. The smell was still present, I was covered on that water up to the nose which made it's odour so much stronger than before that I could feel it as it travelled in and out of my lugs as solid bricks. I cleaned my face with my blanket which didn't fully got rid of it, but it was enough.

I searched for my phone, of course it wasn't there, so I turned on my computer and open the group chat on a navigator. There were some new messages already.

"Hello?" It was Lucas. "Guys, I know it's late but I think I had a dream, but I'm not even sure if it was a dream and like, I think I'm sweating, but there was water and Ramiro isn't answering my messages." Then a third message just a few minutes after. "Fuck I sound so stupid, I'm sorry."

"I don't think it was a dream." Cash replied a little later, and continued with. "Everyone, tell me you're fine. Please."

"Ramiro Please answer my messages!" Lucas sent in a hurry.

"Max, Miguel, Ami, Daniel, Mateo, someone please!" Cash was panicking.

"Cash. I think Max is dead." Lucas said right after I connected.

"Miguel is dead." I added.

"What" I couldn't see Cash expression through the screen, but I could tell how devastated he was.

"There was this thing like a serpent and it was choking him and I just, I don't know I think he's dead." Ramiro explained.

"I dropped Miguel, he wasn't breathing any more." I justified myself.

"Ramiro was hurt and I was trying to help him but I felt and I lost him." Lucas added.

"I felt too, maybe Ramiro is also on his bed." I suggested.

"Ok, I'll go to his house." He said before disconnecting.

"This is my fucking fault I'm so fucking sorry." Cash sent that message a few hours later.

I cried for a while after that, then I took a bath, I passed the following hours holding on to the hope that Miguel was still alive, hoping that he will answer our messages, or at the very least that if he really was dead, that he wasn't on his bed waiting for his mother to find him cover on blood and that horrible putrid smell, I think, or at least back then I thought, it would be easier for her if she believed that he had ran away or that he had a more peaceful death. But then Mateo answered.

"Daniel's dead. Found him on his room, tried CPR and called an ambulance. He didn't make it."

The next few days where hard, Cash and I went back to the mountain to check, but there was no cave. The police started an investigation on Max, Ramiro and Miguel's cases since those didn't seem as natural as Daniel's heart attack.

Miguel's body was found bleeding on his bed, Maria declare that she last saw him with me as I expected, but she also said that it couldn't had been me. When asked I said we went to the mountain, then staid on the beach and took him home around three in the morning, Cash backed up my story and the police never found any more evidence against us, now the official story says it was an elaborated suicide. A few years later Maria told me she was awake at three waiting for us to come back so she knew I had lied, she asked me for the truth, and back then I didn't answer. Maria if you read this, then now you know all I do, I sadly don't know how he ended up the way he did, but I'll do my best to find that out.

Ramiro survived, wouldn't be for Lucas he'd probably be dead too. When he found him his face was purple with red markings all around his neck and torso, his parent's awoke when Lucas got into the house screaming his name, they called an ambulance while Lucas performed CPR. When asked about it Ramiro just said “I did this to myself”, I don't think the officers believed him, but they didn't questioned him either, he's permanently on a wheel chair now.

Finally Max was never found, he didn't appear on his bed like the rest of us, but both Ramiro and Lucas where sure he didn't make it. 

It's been some years since then. I never asked any of the others for more details on their experiences, never spoken about this with my therapist either, I kept it all to myself and as far as I know so did everyone else. We still have our group chat, but haven't talked much since then. I'm just writing this because yesterday I visited Miguel's grave and it broke me. I miss him, I miss Max and I miss Daniel too. They deserve their stories to be told, they deserve the truth, Maria if you ever read this I'm sorry for leaving him behind, I keep telling myself he wasn't breathing but that doesn't make me feel less guilty. I'm sorry for letting them inside that cave, I'm sorry for taking so long to go in too, but above it all, I'm sorry for lying, Daniel didn't had a natural death, Max didn't ran away, Ramiro didn't choke himself and Miguel didn't kill himself. I'm sorry for lying, here is the truth. We were all taken by the horrors buried on a cave, hidden at the west bottom side, of the Salamanca mountain.
