I received a letter from my college roommate and I’m not sure what to think.

I’m not sure if she’s pulling my leg or if there is something legit going on, so I’m going to post the letter here and see what everyone else thinks. The letter is between the (“) and I’ll have some comments at the end. I have a total of four letters, so here’s the first one.

”Faye, I know back in school you use to be all into conspiracy theories and all that, so you’re the only one who I think might take me serious.I know this sounds insane, especially since the news isn’t covering what’s happening and you won’t have heard anything about it, but half my town was evacuated and the rest of us are forbidden to leave our homes. I know the government has to be behind it all and I’m scared of what’s lurking outside because sometimes I see military vehicles going down the street and I think they’re looking for something.

It all started two days ago. I was at work when the alarm on my phone went off. You know, like the weather alerts and such? It said that there was to be an immediate lockdown and that we would be notified soon about what was happening. You know my work is done in my garage, so I just walked back into the house and turned on the tv to see if I could find out more information, but no channels were working. All that showed was that alert about the shelter in place.

I tired my old radio, but it wouldn’t even pick the alert up. I tried to call my mom, but the phone line was down. No phone signal either. I’d just gotten off the phone with a supplier thirty minutes before this all happened, so I know the lines had to be cut.

I sat in my living room for an hour before I got a knock at my door. Even though my doorbell camera wasn’t working, thanks to the internet being down, I still have a peephole. Faye, it was the freaking military at my door! I opened it and they told me that due to a mishap half the town was being evacuated and the other half would keep a shelter in place order until the issue was resolved. They told me I was to be part of the shelter in place and to not open the door for anyone who wasn’t military and to not go outside under any circumstances.

I tried to ask questions, but all they said was there was a leak and those closest to it would be the one evacuated and everyone else could stay, but that being outside wasn’t good. They told me to shut and lock my door and close all my windows and then they just left to go over to my neighbors house.

I did what they told me to and a few hours later they came by again. Only, they didn’t knock, they just began to board up my windows. They even boarded up my door, so I don’t know why they told me to not answer the door. How am I going to do that if I can even open it?

I also realized that no one had on any sort of mask. If this was a leak and the air wasn’t safe then how are they out there walking around unprotected? I don’t think they realized that my peephole worked because they didn’t board it up so I can still see a little bit of what’s happening outside.

I originally just thought that this would give me a ton of time to get some work done, but the more I sit on it the more I think there is something seriously wrong. I look out my peephole every morning, noon, and night and also when I hear something weird. So far, it’s all just been the military guys driving around, but everything changed tonight. That’s why I’m writing this, because someone has to know what’s going on. I’ll keep a detailed log and send them to you when I can. Hopefully this will all end soon and I can just call and tell you, but if not then I’ll find some way.

Last night I heard shouting, so I looked out. There were at least three vehicles driving down the street and dozens of guys with weapons running around. I couldn’t make out exactly what they were saying, but I think they were looking for something or someone. And once again, no one had any masks on. I’m glad it wasn’t completely dark yet and that the street light still work so I could see what was going on.

I should have protested the lockdown and definitely made a scene when they boarded up my freaking house, but I didn’t so I’m stuck now. Writing this makes me feel better, so that’s a plus. I guess if you never get these letters it ended up being nothing, or I’m dead. Haha. Anyways, I need to get some sleep so I can be up to watch their morning patrols. I’ll start a new letter then.

I’m freaking out, but doing my best,

Tonya”

Okay, so I also received about three more letters and I haven’t read them yet. I’ll start once I post this, so let me know what you guys think and if you want to know what the other letters say. I’ve checked the news, but I’ve not seen anything. I tried to call her, but it went straight to voicemail, so I don’t know what to think. Maybe the letters will tell me what I need to know.

Until then.
