(how is he not dead yet)

(who cares, he’s ours)

(usually they die on the first day though)

(oh well, more fun for us then)

(kill)

(eat)

(destroy)

It has been a day and I’m trying not to listen to the voices. I don’t know how this happened, schizophrenia isn’t contagious. So how could I have gotten it?

(what’s schizophrenia)

(no idea)

I bought myself a cross earlier this morning. It’s a cheap one, about 15 centimeters in length.

As soon as I grabbed it off the shelf, it began to glow a heavenly glow. Not like the haze that shone on the food of the cafe’; this one was more friendlier and welcoming. This one didn’t offer you food and misery straight after, it offers you protection and refuge; especially from the supernatural.

My head began to throb and slowly ache – then it began to get worse over the next few seconds.

Ululating screaming erupted from my cranium and through my ears. My head was going to blow off of my shoulders like a watermelon being pummeled by a sledgehammer.

I dropped to my knees, holding my head with the glowing cross in my right hand.

I was literally seeing red as I clenched my teeth to try and stop the pain.

It was unbearable.

(what the hell is going on)

(i don’t fucking know)

(not ours?)

(yeah im outta here)

(no, don’t you see what is going on? This guy is using a Satandamn cross to push us out)

(fuck that, i don’t want to get burned alive)

(just stay, show this human who’s boss. We didn’t possess a little kid for no reason)

(//////////////////fine///////////////)

(what about the other ones)

The pain subsided greatly as 11 demons were pulled from my head and into the shelves in front of me.

It seems they are physical beings as well. The shelves in front of me went flying to the other side of the room.

Every person in the shop had now fled screaming to their cars.

I looked back in front of me and was pleased to find out that they had all disappeared. I breathed a sigh of relief.

(great, they all dipped)

(it's just me and you smiler)

(shut up. Watch and learn)

Suddenly, my body was moving by itself. I was panicking and trying to scream, but no sound came out.

My eyes were as blank as eyes drawn on paper.

I found myself stiffly walking to the kitchen section of the store and grabbing a knife off the nearest shelf.

My hands were working as if they had a mind of their own. They swiftly but efficiently unwrapped the cardboard sheathed on the new knife.

Police spilled into the doorway and further, blocking the entrance.

I was just trapped inside my own body. I could only watch what was about to unfold in front of me with my own lifeless and blank eyes.

“Alright I am going to need you to step away from where you are hiding with your hands where I can see them”, an officer said.

(pig’s arse)

My mouth let out a battle cry of a demon as my not-in-control body launched itself on top of a shelf and leaped into the officer.

“What the fu—”, those were his last words before his throat was sliced open.

Blood flew in all directions as my body leapt from side to side, dodging bullets and slitting throats. 

They ended up shooting each other as my possessed body hid behind one officer after another in an attempt to shoot me.

It was a massacre. None of them were able to request backup.

The final officer stood in the midst of it all, blood covering his police vest and pants. On the vest, was a name tag matted with blood. The words were still easily able to be read:

**Constable Jeremy**

My body went limp apart from the legs. The knife dropped to the floor with a clatter, and then my spine jerked up so fast I could have sworn my spine shattered.

I was stuck in my own body yet I couldn’t feel any pain.

As if on its own, my mouth began to rasp loudly.

(constable Jeremy huh?”)

Then a slightly softer, but ever so hoarse voice replaced the first.

(“put the gun down and we won’t bite”)

Officer Jeremy was now literally shaking in his boots.

“WH—WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU”, he screamed at me. His words echoed throughout the building almost melodically.

The first voice was back this time. 

(“Jeremy Anthony Amiraz. Father of Bianca Amiraz and lover of Lily Evan Amiraz”)

The last cop’s eyes went wide.

“How the fu—”. The gun shook wildly in his hands and he began to sob quietly. The shaking gun dropped to the ground. Sliding through the gore on the floor.

I could only watch as the sobs turned to cries of hysteria and grief. Every sound continued to echo throughout the building.

(“that's right. They’re all dead. You have nothing left but this shitty job. Not to mention that you have cancer that’s 4 months old. Oops, did i reveal too much?”)

Again, my body moved on its own. My head tipped back and began to erupt in hoarse laughter. The noise, just like the sobbing, echoed and boomed all over the building.

I tried to squirm and move about. At least have SOME control over my body, I have to fight it. 

More and more people are going to get hurt by these fucking things.

The two demonic voices had now merged into one:

(“see what you are? just a miserable human with no life. grovel in the dirt like the worm you ar—”)

It happened so suddenly my body couldn’t react in time.

The bullet hit me straight in the stomach and I took a step back, slipping on all the gore before falling to the ground with a wet thud.

A booming laughter erupted from where the cop was.

The cop was still there. Almost.

Jeremy’s body twitched and shuddered as it cackled and laughed, eyes glowing with madness and malice. The gun that was fired was held stiffly in his hand.

Whatever was standing in front of me, clearly wasn’t Constable Jeremy anymore.

The thing in front of me now, was the possessed body of Jeremy Anthony Amiraz.

The demons in me spoke first:

(“that was our prey idiot”)

The possessed body again began to explode with laughter, jerking its body back and forth with every cackle.

**(“go home jinns, you’re done here. You have slain my prey for me, now let me eat”)**

My teeth clenched by themselves, as if the “jinns” in me were greatly enraged.

(“fuck off. You always have your share at home and we get nothing, now scram before i slit your throat”)

The hand with my knife in it lifted itself from my side and pointed the bloodied weapon at the demon.

Possessed Jeremy snickered.

**(“look. I have a gun and you only have a kitchen utensil, at any second I can pull the trigger on your head. And we all know what happens to creatures like us when the host is dead”)**

What the fuck is happening. Am I seriously watching a fight between 3 demons where 2 are in control of my goddamn body and the other is a cop?

Whatever happens, I don’t want to die like this; Standing in the middle of a supernatural fight. How the fuck did I end up like this.

And what about that last officer? If I’m alive when possessed, that means he might be as well.

One of us has to die here.

But he just found out he had cancer and he can live his life happily. My life is already fucked up anyway. Cancer is just the flu compared to this.

(“we dont fucking care, asshole. We are still gonna slice you to bits”)

My body threw itself forward and began to run on its own. My feet were agile and quick as they efficiently slid through the gore on the floor like a speed boat on water, but with running feet to propel.

The other demon raised the gun and fired 3 shots that echoed throughout the building.

The first and second bullets whistled past my ear but the third got me in the shoulder.

As if they felt no pain, the jinns controlling me threw my body into the air and onto the possessed cop.

Blood flew in quick jets as my arm went back and forth stabbing the poor cop in the throat right in front of my eyes.

**(“bastard”) it spat**

Blood pooled all under me as the knife was finally thrust into the body’s chest.

(“get fucked”)

I tried to scream, I tried to warn them but it was already too late.

**(“bang”)**

My head looked down to see the gun at my stomach, of course the trigger had already been pulled.

Jeremy’s eyes rolled back into their sockets, his head fell back; and he died.

I’m writing this as I’m bleeding out. I can finally move my body. The demons in me have probably left me so they could escape without dying. I’m fucked.

**(“they left you here to rot huh. Typical jinns. This body is perfectly fine it just needs some healing”)**

My eyes shot open. 

This can’t be happening!

**(“time to find those rats”)**

Again, my body was out of control. It got up and walked over to a dead policeman’s fully loaded gun and picked it up.

**(“my child this isnt the end of you”)**

I stayed silent, not like I can talk anyway

**(“no. this is only the beginning”)**
