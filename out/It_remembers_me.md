I had a strange dream. It was like any weird dream. Nonsensical, not a lot going on. I was in the passenger seat of my moms car, when I looked to my right.

There it was. Made of rough black wrinkled skin peeping at me from a canal to my right with its terrifying eyes. They were like what sandpaper feels like by looking at them.

They were large, and bloodshot. They wouldn’t blink. There was nothing inherently weird about them, besides they make me want to puke.

I stared for a few seconds trying to comprehend what was looking at, but it knew I saw it by that point. I couldn’t see anything below it’s eyes but I knew by the way it’s face twisted it was smiling. That’s when it slowly lowered its head out of view.

After this the dream proceeded as normal, like nothing happened. And more things happened that didn’t make much since. I saw the face again in between these interactions but it wasn’t until a actual person I knew in real life walked up to the car.

For the sake of not giving out their name I’m going to call them Steph. Steph got into the driver side of my moms car and started to chat. It wasn’t a realistic chat, we were talking about a new game I had been playing recently in real life. That’s when I looked to my right. 

The thing was no longer in the canal; it was right up next to the car. It was almost laying down just under the passenger window. Until I saw it. That’s when I could hear it.

“Remember me I,” it said with an almost annoyingly high voice. It grabbed my arm and started to pull on me. For what ever reason it wanted me out of the car. I did everything to not let it take me. 

“Be my friend,” it said over and over again. Finally at one point, Steph kicked it, before staring up at its eyes. Instinctively she kicked it again. And it fell back into the canal. I rolled up the window and locked the door and looked at her. 

Steph looked mortified. She wouldn’t blink. She mumbled something inaudible and got out of the car and walked away. I quickly grabbed the door and shut it, locking it as I got back in my seat. This is when I looked back at the canal.

Where the thing had fallen laid a man. His clothes torn and his head twisted in a strange way. 

From then on the dream went on as normal, until I was hit with a wave of fear. I adjusted myself in my seat so that I was towards the bottom. Then I shut my eyes as tight as I could. He was back.

I kept my eyes shut as he ripped me out of the car. He screamed at me to be his friend and to open my eyes. I screamed “no” over and over at each of his requests. He started smashing me into the ground. With each thrust toward the ground I could feel my bones breaking.

I think eventually he got sick of my answers. With a quick motion he snapped my neck, and I was awake with a jerk of my head. The last popping of my neck ringing in my ears, and the feeling of my neck snapping still lingering.

I tried to brush it off and go back to sleep, but I immediately had another dream. All I heard was the thing telling me to “remember me” over and over. I eventually woke up from that dream too.

I’m now writing this from the passenger seat of my moms car. We’ve been sleeping in the car while we wait for our new home, but since I’ve woken up from that second dream I’ve had a nagging feeling to not look to my right.

I think I can feel it’s gaze like a burning sensation on my neck. The worst part is that as I type this, I can’t stop seeing its face in my head, and hearing it telling me, “you remembered”.
