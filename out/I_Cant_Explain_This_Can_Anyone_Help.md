Hello.

I woke up from a terrible nightmare, I can't get this memory out of my head - can Someone Help?

3 years ago, I lived in my aunt and uncle's basement. Weird things happened, but nothing I couldn't explain. The TV would turn on in the middle of the night, I found out, during power fluctuations, The TV's Default state was ON, so I figured that's all that was happening. What happened to me, however, I can't explain.

One night, I heard my aunt and uncle get into a horrible fight. I don't recall what it was over, Voices raised, doors slammed, all terribly uncomfortable for me to hear. Once the fight settled down, I heard a knock on the door dividing upstairs from the basement. My uncle called down "Anon, I am coming down" (I didn't want to talk about anything I heard so I quickly turned my X-Box off and pretended to be asleep. I heard his footsteps, slowly walking down each step. 

"Anon..." I laid in silence, The hair stood up on the back of my neck, I have known this man all my life, that is not his voice... I mean, it was my Uncle's voice, but it was uncanny, something was wrong. My gut told me, whatever you do...do not open your eyes, do not talk to it. "Anon, I'm coming to you now" The imposter said to me, I heard his footsteps walk up to the side of my bed, it hesitated and then walked THROUGH ME. I felt my blood turn to ICE, my adrenaline shot me out of me, I looked around. The basement was empty and the bathroom door SLAMMED SHUT. 

I ran upstairs as fast as I could. and when I got to the front door... My Uncle's car was gone. I phone him. "Where are you?" I asked. My uncle told me that right after my aunt had left the house, slamming the door behind her, she took off in her car. He immediately followed her in his car. I was home alone.

I never told anyone my story...but it doesn't end there.

A few months later. My Girlfriend was over at my house. She was laying in my bed when she heard a knock come from upstairs "Ms.Anon, can we talk?" My aunt called down to her. My girlfriend, hearing this, closed her eyes and hid under the blankets. Her hair standing up on end. Her gut telling her, do not look and do not speak to this being.

The imposter then sat at the edge of the bed, My girlfriend said she could feel the weight of my aunt and her french bulldog sitting on the bed. "Ms.Anon?" - My gf refused to respond. After 3 minutes, sitting in silence. My girlfriend feels it is safe to open her eyes... No one is there. No one ever was.

My gf called me FREAKING OUT at what just happened and NORMALLY, this wouldn't be weird, my aunt and gf are pretty tight and they talk all the time...but that is under normal circumstances. which is weird since my aunt was with me, in Florida, leaving my gf to watch over the EMPTY house while we were away.

The reason I am seeking help is, Starting a week ago, I am woken up to the same dream of a shadow figure, shaping itself into everyone I know, stealing their voices and outfits, but it can't quite get all the details right.

How do I make it stop?

I'm sorry this isn't written any better, I am just writing it as I remember it
