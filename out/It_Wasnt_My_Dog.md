I’ve waited a long time for this Saturday to come. The workload at the office was staggering until these past few weeks, and for the first weekend in a while, I’ll be able to relax. Not “I’ll put something on in the background while I get everything done” or “While I'm alone, I might as well clean”. This was an honest to God break, sitting down, watching TV, and not doing a damn thing. I even had everything planned out meticulously, so that *nothing* was happening that day. And on top of that, it starts to thunderstorm outside. Yeah, today was gonna be the shit.

I started off the morning figuring out what I’d do, and today I felt like rewatching my favorite show from front to back. I got my Twin Peaks Blu-rays and plopped them in front of my 4K player. I told Alexa to put on some music while I popped popcorn and got myself some drinks. The phone starts ringing, and the caller ID says “SPAM RISK,” and I’m not putting up with this shit today. So I took it off the hook.

I bought flavocol for my popcorn; it’s the stuff they use in the theaters, and you’re only supposed to use a teaspoon of the stuff. Regardless, for something that’s essentially a bunch of chemicals and salt, it’s pretty tasty. The thunder rumbled outside as I went to check on my dog Gimp. He’s a chihuahua. I found him in a ditch, and he’s…well…he’s ugly. Thin black hair, bulging eyes, fucked up teeth, but I love him. He garnered the name because he walks with a gimpy back leg. The Vet says it’s not hurting him and is most likely a birth defect. In short, he’s a healthy dog who walks funny.

I looked to see he was in his cage, fast asleep, curled up in a ball. He’d eaten all the food I set out for him, and his water bowl was half empty. He’d probably need to go out later, so I opened the cage door. He’d usually let me know by standing by the front door. I put the first disc in, and I start episode 1, which is arguably one of the best pilots of a show ever. Rain was still pouring outside, slapping the windows occasionally when the wind kicked up. Yeah, it was great. That’s when I heard Gimp’s little toenails clacking on the hardwood floor approaching me. He stopped next to the La-Z-Boy as I scooped him up and nonchalantly put him under my shirt.

He’s soft and warm, and I kept my house pretty cold, so it’s always nice when he wants to cuddle. I feel him nuzzle against me and get comfortable under my shirt. Episodes passed, and my popcorn was already half eaten. I want to get up to refill my drink, but Gimp was so damn cozy I didn’t wanna move. So I just sat there watching the episodes go by, and by the time I got to the episode about the one-armed man, I heard a familiar sound.

Something clacked on my wooden floors, and I stiffened up because I thought maybe a raccoon or a possum got in through the back door. But then, in walks Gimp, looking at me with his big puppy eyes. I was dumbfounded, because I was holding Gimp right now. He nuzzled against me as I kept staring at the dog before me. I thought maybe it was just a really close-looking doppelgänger, maybe it was a pup from the same litter that came to visit. But on his neck was his name and vet tags. It was Gimp, alright. The question is: What in the fuck is under my shirt?

I stared at Gimp as he whined, he wanted up on my lap, or under my shirt, but something was there already. Something was touching my bare skin, and I had no idea what it was. It moved around like it was getting comfortable, and that’s when I felt its paws- no, it’s *hands*. They were small and felt callous to the touch, like sandpaper. I felt the nails scratch at my stomach as it made itself comfortable. I was stuck, frozen in fear of what to do. In many stories like this where people mistake pets for other things, it’s a harmless encounter that ends with the animal getting shooed away. Most people don’t shove the damn thing into their shirts.

Gimp barked, and the thing in my shirt tensed up and started shaking. I felt its fur bristle against my skin as I tried to stay calm. All of that went out the window when it started licking my stomach. Its tongue was long, and wet with a viscus, rancid-smelling saliva that coated my belly like slime. I held my mouth closed to not gag, or scream, or throw up, Jesus Christ, I was panicking. I was trembling because I had thought about looking down at it through the neck of my shirt. The idea of figuring out whatever this thing was seemed logical, but the more I thought about it, the more nauseous it made me.

‘Just do it, man,’ I thought, ‘Worst thing it can be is one of those big fucking rats you found in the basement.’

I gripped the collar of my shirt and peered into it. Hugged to the right side of my body wasn’t a stray dog, a possum, a rat, or even a raccoon. What I saw was something I still see in my dreams when I sleep. Something I wish I’d never seen. Curled up next to me was a figure that looked like a small, bony man who had thin strands of hair draping off his body. The arms and legs were stalky but folded up with the body. The ears were pointed and massive like my boy Gimp’s. It had a long tail and was devoid of hair, like a rat's. The nails were yellowed and had dirt clinging to their undersides.

Just when I was about to close the shirt and bolt. The fucking thing *looks at me*. Its face was awful, just awful. Its face was a maze of wrinkles and scars, and at the center were two tiny black eyes that were extremely close together. The nose was pointed up and bordering on flat, almost like it was a mix between a pig’s and a bat’s. It then *smiled* at me, baring its array of crooked, yellowed teeth that dripped a sort of pus. The slime, called saliva, dribbled from its mouth. It licks me as it stares, and before I could scream. It leapt to my fucking chest and started clawing & biting at my neck.

“AHHHH! WHAT THE FUCK?!” I screamed, “GET OFF ME! GET OFF ME!”

Gimp was barking now, and baring all of his tiny, crooked teeth like he was going to do something. I took my shirt off and gripped onto the thing with it and slung it across the room. I could hear it screeching and whining as I grabbed my keys and my dog. As I bolted for the door, I could hear the fingernails of this thing skittering behind me so fast that I thought that I wouldn’t make it. But as I slammed the door behind me, I heard it shake and rattle so intensely that I thought it’d come off its hinges. I locked the door and fled into the thundering night. I hopped in my truck and drove all the way to my cousin’s house to stay the night.

It’s been four days now, and I’ve not gone back to the house. I’ve told my family about it, and I even showed them the scars I got from it at the moment. They chalked it up to a possum, and they even dared to say I was sleep-deprived. Listen, I know I’m not the most well-rounded guy in terms of health, but I know what I saw. It wasn’t a damn possum; it wasn’t like anything I’ve ever seen. Some of my family and friends looked into my house, and many of them said they hadn’t found the thing that matched my description. But I know it’s there, it’s waiting for me in the dark. I know I’m not crazy, despite what my family says; I have the scars to prove it. I sit here writing this to you with Gimp on my lap, and I can assure you that the thing under my shirt wasn’t a rat, a possum, or a raccoon, and I’m pretty fucking sure it wasn’t my dog.
