I am 19 Male.
I have never ever wanted to share this until now but it still chills me since I was little.

When you are a child, you get effected. Like something is trying to tell you something but you can't tell if it's friendly or not. I was no expection, I was between 8 or 9 at the time when this happened. I was having a normal day. I was happy, I was messing with my sister and other stuff.

It first started when I was having nightmares of my sister getting hurt but I couldn't move or do anything in this dream. I only heard screams, and cries of help. I didn't know what was going on. It seemed abnormal when I was little but i grew out of it. Until a month or so later. This was the day, I laid down and I slept and when I was asleep, I had a nightmare or dream of a world, it was bright. In front of me on the left and right side was 2 bookshelf stacked on top but rotating into each other like something from an animation software. It was looped at random, sometimes slowing and sometimes going fast. Then in my view was an entity, I couldn't make out any face or anything. It was just black (Void) humanoid figure and it just stared at me, before I knew it, i was pulled to the ground by a gravity unknown to me and I was on my knees, it felt like I was having my energy sucked out of me. I couldn't understand anything, also I noticed I felt taller but it just didn't make sense.

I didn't understand it, a few years after when I was 14/15 I had another dream/nightmare. I couldn't tell if these were predicting something. 


I was walking down a town road, the road was made of bricks, so was the side walk but the sidewalk was broken with multiple cracks, on the end was a small water stream, what I was holding was a bow, not a normal now but it looked advanced too advanced for any normal bow. I heard something coming down the stream of water, it looked like another entity that was black and I don't understand why I just pulled out my bow and just tried to kill it but when I looked away for a second, it was gone and I felt something down my back. Suddenly it was crawling on me, it covered my eyes, I was blind. Darkness was all around me, fear got to me and I could hear music as this thing just says "lonely..." I hear at first then it started to repeat it every 5 then 3 then 1 seconds. It would sound like there was music playing in the background but in real life there was no music or anything, all I could hear "lonely, lonely, lonely!" It just kept repeating itself. I was saying something in another language that was trying to fight it off, it worked Abit but it reached me and then silence.

In real life I was lonely, I had no one. I had no friends that would talk to me, I was the only one who wouldn't talk to anyone anymore, I just quit talking to everyone, I was stressed alot and this just didn't make sense. I just didn't want to have anything to do with anyone, I wanted to leave because if this thing exists then I wish to stay away to protect them. 

I don't even know why I am here, I just can't understand why or what I am supposed to do.

Nothing happened to me in real life expect for the 2nd one where I woke up and felt like my back was burning.
