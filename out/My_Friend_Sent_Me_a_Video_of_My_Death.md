I hadn’t talked to Darren since high school. We were friends back in the day, drifted apart after graduation. I hadn’t thought about him in years.

So when I got a Facebook message from him out of nowhere last Thursday, my first reaction was surprise. Then confusion.

The message only said:

 “This is you, right?”

Below it was a video file. Titled simply:
gasstation_footage_0313.mp4

The Footage

It looked like standard black-and-white security cam footage—wide angle, static shot of a gas station interior. You know the kind: humming fluorescents, chips on wire racks, one sad little counter with a plastic divider.

I watched.

At timestamp 3:12:48 AM, a man walks in.

He’s wearing jeans, a gray hoodie, and a navy baseball cap. Moves a little stiffly, like he’s cold or tired. He walks past the camera toward the coffee machine. Turns a little.

It’s me.

I paused the video. Rewound it. Watched again.

Same posture. Same jacket I wear nearly every day. Same scar just visible under my jawline from that fall back in 2016.

It’s me.


"The Timestamp"

August 29th. 3:12 AM.
That was four days from now.

At this point, I still thought it might be a prank. Deepfake? Edited footage? But it was… convincing.

I messaged Darren back:

 > “Very funny. Where did you get this?”


He didn’t respond



"The Ending"

I resumed the video.

In it, I (or the version of me) grabs a cup of coffee, walks to the counter. The clerk—a big guy in a hoodie—says something I can’t hear.

The version of me says something back and starts getting agitated. Gestures with both hands. The clerk points toward the camera. My doppelgänger leans in, clearly furious.

Suddenly, the clerk reaches under the counter and pulls something out.

A gun.

There’s a flash. The figure (me?) collapses, out of frame.

The clerk steps around the counter.
He drags the body by the arms—my arms—until it’s just barely visible again.

Head cracked open. Motionless.

The feed cuts.



"You Were Always Going to See It"

I spent the next day trying to contact Darren. No luck.

His Facebook? Deactivated. Instagram? Gone. Even his old email bounced.

The weirdest part? I recognized the gas station. It’s on my route to work. I pass it every day at around 3 AM when I do overnight maintenance. I’ve never gone in, but I know the place.

So I changed my schedule. Avoided the whole area.

On August 29th, I stayed home.



"August" 30th – Another Package"

The next morning, I found a manila envelope on my porch.

No stamp. No writing.

Inside was another USB.

This one had a file called:

REDACTED/AV001_LASTCONFIRMED.mp4

I played it.

It showed the same gas station. Same camera angle.

At 3:12 AM, a man in a different hoodie walks in. Same posture. Same movements.

It's me, again.

But this time, instead of heading to the counter, I walk directly to the camera, look into it, and say:

> “I know you’re watching. You always were.
You just had to see it before it happened.”



I smile.

And then I lean forward and touch the lens.

The footage ends.


"Now"

I haven't slept properly since. The days keep passing. I see myself in every reflection—watching me just a second too long. Every time I walk by a window, I feel like I just missed someone leaving frame.

And this morning, the guy behind the register in the footage?

He started working at the real gas station.

I saw him while passing in traffic. He looked up and smiled at me.

I’ve never been inside.
But it doesn’t matter.

Because I saw it.

And now it’s coming.
