I got into what should have been a minor car accident a couple of weeks ago.  I say “should have been” because all it was was someone ramming me from the rear at a stoplight.  Unfortunately for me, since my car was in drive and the light had just turned green, my foot was off the brake, and I was just beginning to accelerate.  Not only that, but I had shimmied into the right lane, like a dick, so my wheels were teetering to the right as I began to move forward.  All of these minuscule factors led to me being careened by the force of a crazed pickup truck into the stoplight’s pole.  One moment, I was mindlessly driving to work, the next thing I knew, the front of my car had closed the gap between the fender and me.  I bashed my head pretty good on the pole, which had somehow entered my car.  Despite the airbag’s best effort, I had to be taken in an ambulance to the hospital to get a gash on the crown of my head clamped shut.

I remember regaining consciousness in the hospital a week later.  Apparently, I had been awake for close to an hour, talking to nurses, but I wasn’t aware of it.  It's a surreal feeling waking up mid-conversation with someone you’ve never met.  I froze mid-word, the word being “neat,” when I truly regained consciousness.  I stared blankly at the nurse, who returned the stare.  I blinked as my mind woke up and the world around me expanded in light, like I was coming out of a long, dark tunnel I had been lost in.  My throat felt awful, and my head ached worse than anything I could remember.  Remember.  I looked around the hospital room, noting that I was the lone patient in this room, lying in a bed with machinery lingering all around it.  

“Sir?”  the male nurse said, “Are you feeling ok?” 

“What?” I replied.

“Well, you were telling me about your trip, then suddenly got very pale.  Can I get you anything?  How is your head feeling? Is the pain coming back?”

“Trip?  Uh, I’m sorry, where am I?”  I whispered through dry teeth, swallowing spit, hoping to lubricate my parched throat.

“Ah,” The nurse must have started putting two and two together, “You are at Henerson General, for head trauma.  You’ve been here just about a week.  I will go get your doctor, one moment.”

“Thank you,” I mumbled as I reached over for a half-full glass of water on the bedside stand.  With a greedy gulp, I finished the glass before the information hit me.  A whole week? Head trauma?  My splitting headache, now of great concern, led to an exploratory hand to feel my head.  Bandages covered the top of my skull, and I finally noticed my neck brace.  

I remembered the crash vividly, but I couldnt recall the journey to the hospital.  Recall.  My head throbbed as I tried to remember what led up to the crash.  Work.  I was going to work.  I closed my eyes.  I forced my disheveled brain to focus.  

What do I do for work?  

No images, no summary, not even a general idea of what field I worked IN, let alone what my actual job was.  I couldn’t remember.  A sliver of panic splashed into my stomach just as the doctor came in.   With a professionally inclined smile, he greeted me, “Hello, glad to hear you're up and talking.  Always a sign of progress.” He joked.

“Yes…” I replied.  

My face must have caused him to drop all pleasantries and get straight to work.  With a nod, smile still present, he glanced over the clipboard he brought in before saying, “So, it seems you were talking to one of our nurses, until you seem to have lost your train of thought?”  

Very straight to business, I took some relief in that, “Well, it's not that I lost my train of thought.  It's just that I wasn’t aware I was talking to her until a few moments ago.”

This was met with a nod and a scribble on the clipboard, “Do you know how long you’ve been awake?” He asked.

“No?”

“A little over an hour, which you have spent talking to several passing nurses.  Do you remember your full name?”

These questions continued.  I remembered my name and date of birth, but I blanked on my parents’ names, couldn’t recall my place of work, and helplessly grasped for the name and breed of my childhood pet.  When asked if I had siblings, somehow, that was the only family-related question I could answer, “Yes, I had a little brother.  He passed away when I was ten.  Family car accident.  For some reason, I wasn’t in the car.  Both my parents made it out ok… Why wasn’t I with them?”  The fog obscured the rest of my memories, leaving me staring blankly at the tile floor.  

Finally, the doctor informed me of the obvious fact that my head trauma may have caused minor amnesia.  They had already done scans since the surgery, and my brain and skull were making “good progress,” they said, so the amnesia didn’t worry the doc.  Easy for him to say.  Nevertheless, he recommended another night in the hospital under monitoring to ensure I wasn’t leaving the hospital with a leaking brain.  I got to call my parents and let them know I was alright, a relatively awkward conversation for me to explain my situation.  But their overall relief was a comfort for me.  It was a short call interrupted by a returning migraine.  

The rest of the evening I spent alone.  A nurse would walk past the door from time to time, but beyond that, I was completely alone with whirring machinery and an old box TV to keep me company.  I tried to relax and get my mind off my situation with channel surfing.  Inevitably, I would strain my head, trying desperately to recall memories.  What trip did I go on recently?  I was telling the nurse about it, apparently, but I had no recollection of a vacation or work trip.  More and more thoughts would come up, leading me to try to remember various aspects of my life.  Some I would remember, like where I lived and my age.  But more and more the pile of static, faceless acquaintances, travels, even elements of college and highschool, accumulated.  

A vicious migraine hit eventually.  I popped some of the pain meds they gave me and prepared for a soothing high that would lead to much-needed sleep.  I fell asleep to a reality show whispering through the aged speakers of the box TV.  A deep, dark, dreamless sleep.  

I suddenly was awake.  Total darkness filled my room.  Only the flickering hallway light fluttered from under my door.  The digital clock on the wall directly in front of me read 2:43 AM.  My head felt like it was pulsing.  Hot waves shook through my skull as I clenched my jaw in pain.  Cold sweat enveloped me, stinging my eyes.  I glanced over to the pain meds on the bedside table.  Desperate for my next dose, I went to grab them.  My arm didn’t move.  I tried again.  Nothing.  Dead weight.  I tried moving my legs.  Nothing.  No amount of pain-fueled willpower would make my limbs do as they were told.  My body felt like static.  Like my head was tied to a corpse.  

Panic rose like bile from my stomach.  Hyperventilating, I tried shaking my torso, with limited success. It's strange the solutions your brain comes up with when it hits a wall of desperation.  Thinking that perhaps my body had fallen asleep, like a limb losing its circulation, I thought my continued torso shake would restore the blood flow, thus my body’s animation.  For several seconds, I pathetically jostled there on the hospital bed, like a psych ward patient fighting against invisible restraints.  Until my eyes, by chance, glanced to the far corner of the empty room.  

A blot of black highlighted by darkness.  Unable to turn my head, I strained my eyes, trying to digest what I was seeing.  A silhouette of black, its figure a fluctuating mirage, seemed to be ever-contorting with the shadows around it.   The manifestation was vaguely human, despite its height reaching the ceiling.  My eyes dried as I stared unblinking at the figure just inside my peripheral vision.  

“I know you,” It spoke. 

Its voice sounded like a whisper from a choir, echoing from outside the room.  Whimpering, my tongue unable to form words, I lay frozen in my bed, begging for this eternity to pass.  It remained posted in the corner.  Silent, as its presence suffocated the room.  I couldn’t breathe anymore, only wait.  

It took a step forward.

I gasped as my head bolted upward and my body spasmed, life returning to it.  Pulling myself up, I turned my head to the corner of the room, my eyes dry and bulging.  It was gone.  Only the natural darkness of the room remained, wavering in that corner against the hallway’s sliver of light.  Relief washed over me, and I shuddered, choking back helpless tears.  Greedily, I inhaled deep bouts of air, trying to ease my trembling body.  Pathetic.  I felt pathetic.  

I didn’t sleep the rest of the night.  I turned the TV on, as my mind raced, trying to remember if this sleep paralysis was something I had always suffered from and forgot about.  No memories of this ever happening to me before emerged.  No comfort was to be had.  Only the soft static of that TV, as it hummed with a warming familiarity.  

The dawn finally peeked through the curtain.  Steadily, the hospital resurrected.  Passing nurses and doctors switched their shifts on and off as the day began.  My nurse visited me with my breakfast.  The morning formalities were cut short when I explained the horrid experience to her, praying it was just a short-term symptom of my head trauma.  She maintained her reassuring professionalism as she smiled and nodded, while I described the night’s terror.  

“Have you had sleep paralysis before?”  She asked warmly. 

“No… Well, I don’t remember ever having them.  Would that be something I should remember?”  I prodded, practically begging her for reassurance.  I felt like a child, but I was scared.  I never wanted to feel that way again.  Or see that, ever again.  

She must have picked up through my tone that I was shaken.  Giving an empathetic smile, she simply said she would inform my doctor, so I could get a proper analysis.  The doctor came, we talked it over, and he gave the non-answer I was afraid of: “It could very well be a symptom of your accident.  However, after looking over your scans and the info we gathered last night, your brain shows no signs of relapse.  It and your skull are healing as expected.  You are free to leave anytime today.  Of course, I will prescribe more pain meds as the migraines will continue for at least a few more days.”  He continued his recommendations for my routine at home.  Pain meds when needed, keep your head upright and supported when possible, limit turning your head, and keep the neck brace on for a couple of weeks, stay away from strenuous activity, etc.  

I Ubered home that afternoon.  I entered my apartment, grateful to be away from the stale, synthetic odor of the hospital as I inhaled.  A hot shower and clean clothes were soothing.  I felt the tension melting away as I lay upright on my own couch in my own place.  No more remembering, no more thinking, only rest for now.  I told myself this over and over and turned on my flat screen TV, a massive upgrade over the hospital’s box TV.  

I sat there for the remainder of the afternoon, basking in peace and familiarity.  I was desperate for both.  I knew the following days would be an awful blur of reaching out to whoever was my employer and getting some sort of doctor’s note sent.  My phone had a plethora of missed calls and messages that I had ignored.  Scrolling through all the unfamiliar names filled me with a horrifying melancholy I couldn't handle.  Mom and Dad.  The only two identities I recognized, despite their names and faces being a bit blotchy in my head.  A mountain of mist and uncertainty expanded.  Connections completely erased, to be reformed, relationships to be jump-started awkwardly and pathetically to come.  All felt like daunting tasks for someone who could barely recall basic info about his immediate life. 

The pamphlet I was provided was filled with recommended services and professionals to guide me through this jumbled pile of blank puzzle pieces.  The doctor set me up with a specialist for the week to come, yet he still pressed me on “Getting the ball rolling and reaching out to whoever you can. This may help shake loose some memories from the bog”.  The bog was thick and deep.  

The sun set, I rolled over, and my watch read 8:30 PM.  I was exhausted.  With a grunt, I rose off the couch and got ready for bed—another shower for good measure.  Slipping into the comfiest PJs I could find, I slid into bed, wrapping myself in several extra blankets. 9:04 PM, read the digital clock.  With heavy eyelids, I stared at the soft glow of the red digits.  Several blinks later, sleep.  

Blackness, surreal relief.  This was interrupted as I jolted awake.  Cold sweat coating me like the mucus of a slug, I stared at the ceiling fan.  A returning dread choked me as I flinched, only to find my body numbed again.  Jerking my head, I attempted over and over again to shake my living dead body back to life.  Nothing.  Limbs remained tied to my bed by invisible chains.  Panic suffocated me.  It weighed on my chest as all the incoherent alarms in my head screeched at once.  Until movement in my peripheral caught my attention.

I whimpered as I desperately turned my gaze as far as my eyes would let me, to the farthest corner of my bedroom.  Beside my window, just behind the still curtains, stood the amorphous humanoid figure.  I stared at it, waiting for its move.  I shivered as it took a step closer.  Then another step.  And another.  Tears stung my eyes as I tracked it to the foot of my bed.  Body still locked in vulnerable immobility, I unblinkly watched the figure as it was now in clear view.  Its presence was like a smog.  It had no solid outline.  Its silhouette was only human in the most abstract of ways as it swayed with the room's stifled air currents.  It towered over my bed, its height reaching the ceiling.  

Eyes jutted upward, I waited.  For either my body to regain muscle control, or my heart to stop.  It loomed down, head descending to my face.  Now in clear sight, I saw its face.  Its upper head was a collection of random eyes, from its nose up over its scalp, that blinked idiosyncratically as I watched them, begging to wake up.  It had a mouth, vertical and large, going past the first couple of eyes to the forehead.  Its mouth opened, revealing various shapes and forms of teeth.  Some looked like baby teeth, while others were either adult teeth or gnarled canines randomly scattered on blackened gums.  A group of multiple tongues seemed to fight for supremacy as they wagged and licked in the cavernous maw.  It spoke at last,

 “I know you,”

Despite being directly in my face, the voice remained distant and hollow, echoing through the room like a prayer in a cave.  There was no malice in it.  I could hear it clearly this time.  There was a childish confusion in its tone.  Almost accusatory.  Sweat stung my eyes, and I blinked in pain when at last my arms began to move.  I shot my hand to my face, wiping my eyes.  My vision cleared to show an empty room.  

The rest of the night was spent catching my breath.  The shaking wouldn't stop, but the tears didn't come this time.  They were drowned out by confusion and questions.  Along with the dread of this occurring again for an unknown period of time, out of my control.  I had to find a way out of this.  I knew I had to call my parents as soon as the sun rose.  I had to know if this had happened to me before the accident.  

Wrapped in blankets, I sat on my couch, watching for the sun.  6:35 AM rolled in, and I searched my phone for my Mom’s number, unable to remember it from the top of my head.  Still stained with sweat from the night’s episode, I clutched my phone, each passing ring filling my gut with anxiety.  With a click, I heard a voice, “Mm…Hello?”

“Mom?”

“Honey?  What are you doing calling me so early?”

“I’m sorry, what time is it there?”  I asked.

“It's 4:37 AM!”

A different time zone, another factor I lost about, my parents.  “Oh, I’m sorry, I forgot…Um, I can call you back?” 

A short silence, she must have put two and two together, “Of course not, sweety, I’m sorry, I spoke without thinking.  Are you doing ok?  We haven’t heard from you since you woke up in the hospital.  Getting back into the swing of things well enough?”

Her concern was a blanket of comfort I gripped with gratitude, “No, well, I mean yes, I am getting there.  I found my way home, so that's good hehe… Not so lucky on the work front.  Um, Mom, the reason I called is… I have been having a recurring issue, and I can’t for the life of me remember if it's ‘normal’ for me.”  

A concerned silence responded, so I continued, “My sleep has been rough lately.  I have been dealing with sleep paralysis.  Can you remind me if this is something I have dealt with before and if I ever found a way to get over it?”  

“You have?”  My Mom replied, a tinge of shock in her voice.

“Yeah, have I dealt with this in the past?”  I asked.  

Another contemplative silence.  Mom cleared her throat, “Um, well, as far as I can recall, YOU never had this issue.  But your brother did, Daniel.  Ever since he was able to walk and talk, he would have night terrors and cry about not being able to move when he woke up…” 

My head began to ache, “I…forgot about that, I suppose.  Did you and Dad ever find a way to… help?”

Another stifled cough on the line. I hated myself for forcing her to talk about this.  About Dan.  A name I had forgotten.  A brother I could barely visualize the outline of.  But the hollow ache in my chest remained all the same, as sharp and clear as the day we lost him.  Mom finally responded, “No…No, we never did.  We didn’t get enough time with him.  He never slept well… Not a single night of his life…”  Her voice began to quiver, “God…My poor sweet boy never had one good night of sleep… But he’s sleeping now.  A deep, peaceful sleep.” 

“I’m sorry, Mom, I didn’t mean to upset you.”  My heart ached for her.

“It’s ok, sweety, it's good to remember him.  My sweet, sweet little Danny…”  Another pregnant pause, “I’m sorry I couldn’t help you, honey.  We never had the chance to look into treatment for it.  I wish I had the answer for you.”  She cleared her throat again.  

“It’s ok, Mom, thank you anyway.  Say hi to Dad for me, let him know I’m gettin' there.”

“Of course, honey, love you so much, you take care.  And don’t be a stranger, call again soon.”  With that, the call ended.  I sat there awhile, staring out the window.  The sun peeked over the hills ahead.  My eyes stung and my head ached.
