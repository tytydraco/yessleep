Trigger Warning: Graphic Depiction of Violence

It's been a month of terror now walking this street at night. It's not like I can actually avoid this situation. Well, not until I finally quit being a call centre agent who’s out of luck for frequently having graveyard shifts, lungs dying from smoking, palpitations being my best friend with all the coffee in my system.

The gruesome news was all about a serial killer who preys upon women who are alone on the streets at night, the only evidence that can point on them is their car being metallic gray.

Victims were all found dead, that was for sure. Slumped under a random streetlight, could even be one directly outside the pour soul's home, face was collapsed like a smashed pumpkin, hands and feet were both missing, chopped off, but then the whole body was undeniably clean except from some remnants of their brain casually dripping from their skull.

Walking alone from my apartment to work is an utterly dumb and dangerous thing to do but I usually have my guy companion with me, Lynx, who works at the same company and lives just 2 doors from mine. Unfortunately, he’s sick from all the drinking and partying on his rest day and now taking a 3-day sick leave. 

I believe I'm a tough woman. Being a victim of various attempts of assault, I learned not to trust men and just be batshit crazy to save yourself from danger. However, it’s honestly an unknown battle for me tonight. The silence of the street is suspicious. Cars parked on the side of the roads making it look so tight and more uncomfortable. What's with people buying and owning vehicles without having their own proper parking lot?

My heart jumped when I heard hurried footsteps behind me and all the adrenaline rushed up into my brain. I was ready to fight whatever or whoever it is. That's when I see a woman looking so frantic while running towards me. She uttered a not so loud "Help," but enough for me to hear. I searched for my pepper spray and I was about to fish it out of my bag, a pair of cold hands grasp my arms and was now faced with a woman, eyes drenched with tears.

"Oh goodness, s-someone's chasing me. I don't know who it is. Maybe those k-killers. My car is near here, it's near. Please, just please, let's hide together. Come with me."

I have no time to respond as she took my hand and I just frozed, still grasping on my pepper spray inside my bag, not trusting some stranger. Not until I noticed a car's headlights from the direction the woman came from. That's when I bolted with her even with my body being suspiciously hesitant.

We run for like an eternity until we reached her car. I went on the passenger side as I stole a glance from the woman. She nod her head, a sign for me to go ahead and ride her car before she proceed to enter on the driver's seat. I heard the car's doors locked. She doesn't start the engine right away, darkness and silence engulfing us in this narrow space. She told me to crouch on my seat as the car that I believe chasing her, passed by.

The woman sighed, “I can’t believe that works every time.”

“Maybe because they’re looking for one when there’s two of us,” said a man’s voice from the backseat. 

THEIR victims were all found dead, that was for sure. And tonight, it's me.
