I woke up in the morning with an insatiable need to have complete control over someone. Unfortunately, I am powerful enough to get it. My body is not my own; it belongs to the Need. The Need took over and my body was a slave to it.

Dare I say unfortunately again, but, dear reader, understand it is not a blessing. Before it took over my heart raced, my stomach ached, I cried, my body shook, all out of pure terror. 

 I and my people are Arad-Sul. We are something like vampires and something like gargoyles, but that is not the legend that defines us the most.

There is a reason your holy books warn of idols, there is a reason your ancestors destroyed so many, and there is a reason you can't stop making them.

Did you think there was a difference between a statue of Zeus and a mannequin of Madonna? Foolish. For every idol made there is a shadow cast. For every shadow cast one of us is born. Last night the Need took over and it was the most frightening moment of my life.

But for you it must be even scarier

I was one of your fearful fantasies burned into reality. That persistent itch that keeps your skin on edge, like a butcher knife against the throat. You've all looked behind you, on your long walks home alone, afraid you're being followed. Thank God for you, it was only a human or a shadow. I was a human turned shadow and I had a Need.

The man in front of me was massive that night. He jogged through the night in a green tank top and red shorts. The Need carried me. I flew. I grew. I grew to his size. I expanded with rolling red blood, white bones. I was a blob of darkness full of muscle, mass, and shadow that grew to the size of a grizzly.

I zoomed forward and I only breathed in big gasps. Breath was time. Breath was work. All of that belonged to the Need. I rushed forward and he heard me. He adjusted quick, raised his fist, widened his stance, and let go of the leash holding the dog at his side.

I pitied the man and I pitied the dog, and I am a fool who can only pity because the Need pulls my puppet strings.

I turned translucent. The dog jumped through me. I turned hard as stone. The jogger was a fighter. His fist hooked across my face. His knee slammed into my gut and I felt nothing. He could have punched. He could have cried. It's all the same. I only experienced ecstasy. I slammed my finger into his chest. Bland red blood spurted and wet my fingers. 

My finger split his bone to make a *spurt* sound, it cracked the bones in his chest open, and wetted itself around his heart. The anticipation made my heart dance and I was aware of myself again but not in control. Not this close to revelry. My fingers touched his heart and I wrote my name. His life was gone. It now belonged to me. 

He stood there, awaiting orders. By writing my name on his heart I owned him now. 

The Need was fed so, the Need was gone. Its sins now belonged to me. 

I dropped to my knees and vomited. It does not feel good to kill, for me anyway. A large, heavy knot formed in my stomach, like an anchor it wants to sink me and I let it.

The dog gnawed at me twice and I let it because I deserved it. It buried its teeth and pulled and pulled. I couldn’t pretend it hurt. I stole its master; I won't lie to it. I accepted my punishment until he grew tired and whimpered to his master who still stood under my control. The dog knew his master was gone but he was still in denial. The beast grabbed its own leash and pretended to walk off. He looked back three times before rushing to his master again. He growled at his master a command to wake up. It didn't work so the dog didn't work. The pup collapsed by his master's feet and tears flowed down his pudgy face.

"I'm sorry," I said, "I'm so sorry."

I will do it again soon. That is the curse of the Arad-Sul. We live as humans until our eighteenth birthday. Then the Need takes over us five times. Then we are swallowed by the Need. There is no friendship with humans nor one another, nor is there love. It's a rare occasion for the Arad-Sul to commune with one another at all. My life of friends, school, and love will be replaced with loneliness and slaves. I will make so many more crying dogs. Unless, my plan works. 

In all our history one of us has never done one thing: had love before the change. I will find love and marry my love to stop from becoming a monster. If not I'll die; I won't be like my people. I'll kill myself before that. If I don't find love I'll fly into the sun. 

I must find love while I am young and still have beauty in my soul before I become old and cruel. 

How hard could it be to find love in 2024?
