So this is going to be hard to explain- my family is apparently very big, countless aunts and uncles and cousins but ever since I was a little kid I've always wondered why I've never seen them; apart from the occasional meeting, no one ever sees each other, no birthdays, Christmases or even just normal family functions. It's usually just me, my Mom, and my brother. 

I've also wondered, since I was a kid, why I've had to go to so many funerals. It's always very hush-hush, however- none of this big grand party where everyone cries, but instead just a small service with just family and the coffin is lowered into the ground and everyone goes home. I have really vivid memories from when I was little, standing with my mom and holding her hand while we watched the little wooden box carved by my dad be lowered into the ground and helping pat the soil over it. My mom never cried though, no one did- just this distant, wistful look in her eyes.

I've tried to ask her about our family and it's apparent largeness but she'll always dodge the subject or just straight up ignore me. I can understand that though, ever since Mason died she's been quiet anyway. Mason was my brother, such a bright guy, loved his cars- he had a Mustang sitting in his workshop that he poured over and worked at day in and day out, like it was his child. It was a deep crimson, painstakingly cleaned and waxed and shined daily- with long, silver detailing and a cream interior he didn't let me sit in unless I sat on a towel. It's still there, albeit less shiny, the forensic cleaners made sure to give it a proper wash though. After the police cleared out of the workshop it's basically been a museum of him- his messiness, always leaving his tools all over the floor- he'd trip over them all the time. I remember there was this one time when I was there he tripped over a wrench he left next to the bottom of the car when he was working on it and a drill bit went through his palm. He was so clumsy. Mom doesn't let me in there anymore. 

After Mason's funeral, I decided I'd had enough and I wanted to get answers about my mysterious family. I went on one of those family-history-DNA sites and got my DNA tested. After a few weeks, when I got my results back, I was shocked. I remember opening the little envelope, and reading that I only had one living family member left. my Mom.

There were also records of other.. deceased family members. Mom was right, we do have a big family, but apparently, no one lives for very long. The oldest member of my family was one of my grandparents, who lived to about sixty, and was an outlier in this. I felt this quiet fear as I read over the ages other members died at- twenty, twenty-six, forty, eighteen, six, twenty-two (That was Mason, which stung to read), nine, one, eleven. I wanted to see for any case of illness in my family, some kind of hereditary disease or illness that caused this mass execution of my family. But there was nothing. 

I confronted my Mom about this, why she'd been so secretive, why everyone died so young, what was going on? 

She sighed, putting down her drink as she patted the seat next to her so I could sit.

"Darling, ever since your great, great grandfather was little, even as far back as then, there's always been something... different, about this family?", she paused, carefully, thoughtfully, "I know you want to know why no one sees each other. Why we don't see Dad anymore. But I think it's safer for you to not know- It's already affecting us. It's hurt everyone else. I tried to tell Mason, but..." She trailed off. I remember about a week before Mason died I could hear Mom and Mason shouting about something and hearing him stomp to the door and slam it behind him. Mom cried a lot that night.

I could feel myself getting more confused, more angry. I came to her for answers, and she gives me this? "Why won't you tell me, Mom? I'm an adult, somehow, and you still won't tell me fucking anything. Don't give me that 'I want to protect you' bullshit, if it's something that could hurt me then I think you should tell me. Do you want me to die like Mason did?" With every word that came out, Mom got tearier and tearier and left with a hiccup as finished, running down the hall, slamming the door behind her.

I quietly seethed as I walked upstairs and watched her drive off, coming to the end of the drive. She was about to turn out as a car sped up towards her, faster and faster-

The other car smashed into her, glass shattering and metal crunching, and I watched in horror as her car flipped over and over before crashing to a halt in the barrier on the other side of the road. The whole front of the car had been squashed flat, covered in dents and broken glass, billowing smoke before being engulfed in flames.

Mom was pronounced dead on the scene. Major facial trauma, traumatic brain injury (caused by a shard of glass stabbing through her forehead from the initial crash, but made worse by the flips and the second crash. Multiple pieces of glass were found lodged in her brain the the autopsy. She never would have survived.), a broken leg, major damage to her lungs and four broken ribs. The other driver was never caught, they'd limped away from the scene after the crash. After this incident, I became a shut in- first Mason, now Mom, would it be me next?

The best case of action, in my mind, was to never let anyone in or go out. The house has fallen into disrepair, I'm too afraid to call anyone to fix anything so I just sit in my room with all of the windows shut. It's getting a bit mouldy because of the moisture, but I have a little space heater to keep me warm. I'm safe. Nothing can get me. But recently, even as I'm writing this, I've had this weird headache and chest pain and I just feel exhausted all the time. I'll update again when I'm feeling better. I think I just need a nap.
