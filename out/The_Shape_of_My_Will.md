I awoke on a brisk, chilly morning. It's fall, so the leaves are as orange as the setting sun, which seems to leave us in the cold sooner than it does in the summer.

Almost like it's running away from the breeze.

Starting my day, I wandered clumsily down the stairs and smashed my toe against the end of the bannister at the bottom of the stairs. Irritated, I angrily made my coffee.

Folgers, with a dash of instant-espresso. So fancy.

I got dressed in my usual work attire, donning my reflective vest, my ski mask, my boots, and my hardhat.

The dirty, brown leather, still caked in mud and roadwork material from the past few weeks.

The foreman wants to drag the project out as long as possible so we can extend the contract and make more profit. Lovely.

If only that money made its way into our pockets, instead of his.

I set out on my commute, with another exciting day of asphalt-pouring to distract me from the empty house waiting for me, at the end of it all. Whatever.

At the worksite, I noticed none of the equipment was running. I didn't hear the thunderous claps of the asphalt-pounder slamming the road into place, compacting it.

I wasn't graced with the screech of the CAT's hydraulics.

Or the reverse beep of the dump-trucks.

There was a stillness in the air that unsettled me, beyond anything else.

The only other living soul was some jogger, running past me on the opposite side of the highway. Something about seeing him, in all this silence, it brought me a sense of familiarity.

Yet, I still felt overwhelmed with anxiety. Almost... guilty?

I chalked it up to my existence being an insult to peace.  
A line I'll never forget, after the man who took me in, who I once looked up to, said to me those very words. That was the day my admiration turned to hatred.

My phone seemed to drift into my field of view as I instinctively grabbed it to call the foreman.

Excited for the possibility that I might go home early.  
Five ringing tones, with a deafening silence between them, and still -- no answer.

Try again.

On the first ring, my call's answered; but only for a split second.

He hangs up immediately.

I heard what sounded like static blasting through the speakers, right before it cut off.

Frustrated, I turn to the second-in-command. I was ready to end the day before it had even begun. I call Gary. My supervisor.

He picks up in a panic, before the first ring even finishes, and I have to calm him down to get the story out of him.

"Gary, what's going on? Where you guys at? Where's the fuckin' equipment? Do I just take the day off or...?"

He stutters over his words. You can tell from the sound of his voice that he's actively looking at something extremely distressing.

"I- Jesus man, nobody told you what happened to the foreman? I don't have time to worry about you or that fucking bullshit highway. Mark's dead."

My eyes went wide after those last two words. I froze in place, stopping even my breathing to listen to every detail of what Gary's preparing to tell me.

"His entire goddamn head's all over the floor in the workshop's office. I got the ambulance on the way but holy shit, man, this is fucking gnarly..."

He inhales sharply, giving himself a pause.

"I can barely breathe. I walked in and slipped on chunks of his skull and pieces of his brain. The blood slicking up the floor didn't help much either. I was pissed the fuck off, yelling and cursing thinking someone spilled some shit overnight and didn't clean it up, leaving it for the morning crew, like always."

His tone shifts to an even darker, disassociated, detached one. You can hear his brain grinding its gears to suppress the trauma he's actively developing.

"That's when I called out to the Alexa to turn the lights on for me while I laid there on the floor, writhing in pain after hitting my back on the edge of a filing cabinet. I look down my chest, and across the room from me -- guess what the fuck I had to see? The first thing I had to see this morning when I clocked in?"

"What-" I attempt to mutter, as he impatiently cuts me off halfway through the word.  
He's almost rushing to get the words out, like purging a sickness with the gag reflex -- his hurried tone barely coherent in his deep-breathed, stressful rambling as he tries to recount the situation.

"It's fucking Mark. Sitting upright in his chair, his hands tucked into his hoodie pocket, and his hood's up. Of course, I fail to realize that there's not nearly enough space under his deflated-ass hood to actually contain his head."

He pauses after a deep sigh, I can imagine him pinching the bridge of his nose and squinting while trying to make sense of what he's just seen. You can almost hear the air whoosh by his microphone, as he throws his hands up in defeat or exasperation.

"I thought this shit was a joke and started fucking screaming at him about how I'm gonna quit and sue over the massive gash in my back that I got after slipping on what I thought was red dye. I thought I just got the bad end of one of his stupid ass pranks. I wanted to beat his ass."

He gulps down air, his dry throat and shaky voice can be heard as he trembles and struggles to regain his composure. He's getting to the worst parts.

I tell him, "Take your time."

Eventually, after some silence and the faint warble of ambulance sirens in the background, he finishes telling me.

"I walked over and slapped the shit out of the hood that I thought was pulled over his face. Turns out, there wasn't a face to hide. It wasn't attached to the rest of him. It was splattered all over my back, the walls, the ceiling, and the bottom of my boots. I can't fucking do this. I just got back from a goddamn war, man, I can't do this..."

He trails off, repeating himself over and over again until eventually I got so freaked out by his panic attack that I simply withdrew, and hung up.

I couldn't help him, the same way he couldn't help Mark.

A handful of days after our call, I wake up on the couch.

I had one of those lucid dreams. Fascinating.  
I can have a wife, a better home, and a job I actually enjoy.

Didn't remember much of it, though.  
Such is the way of life.

The police ruled my boss's death an accidental one.

Cause?  
Unknown.

There's no gun, no bullets, no gunshot residue from the barrel's flash -- nothing.

The most inexplicable, unexplainable case they'd gotten on their desk in years. They couldn't even chalk it up to suicide.

Just Mark and his disgusting, exploded head.

The next day, it's 3pm, I can just tell. I've spent so many days laying here, that I can simply tell the time based on the position of the window-frame's shadow on my floor.

That, and the afternoon news announced the time before they continued the seemingly endless coverage about the incident.

More than a week goes by, of being laid-off work due to company budgeting conflicts, given the new mess they had to pay to clean up as well as the survivorship benefits they were obligated to send to his family.

They had to pay for Gary's therapist, as well.

In another timeless, confusing haze of days, I start to drink the stillness away.

I thought about Mark, and how he deserved it. Finally got what was coming to him.  
Guilt washed over me, but it came in waves, just like my animosity for a man that got his own retribution delivered seemingly by the divine. My rage was more consistent than my shame for feeling it.

He was an awful man.

And I couldn't think of someone who DIDN'T want to take a chunk out of him.

I just wasn't expecting full-blown... death.

No evidence on the cameras, though.  
Nobody snuck in or out, no fingerprints, no hair, spit, blood; nothing.

We didn't have night vision so we weren't able to see what happened after the lights went out, when he sat down at his cold, metal desk and put his hands in his pockets.

It wracked my mind.

How...?

What happened to the man I hated?

That question became my lullaby. Every night, as the world outside my window turned into a quiet void, I'd hear it whisper from somewhere inside me. Not just in thought — but *inside* me. Like it had made a home in my bones. Like the question itself had a voice.

Sometimes I thought I was dreaming it. Sometimes I was certain I was *awake* when I heard it.

Then came that other morning. Cold again. Still fall. Still empty.

But that morning felt different.

There was no coffee. No toe stub. No birds. Just silence. As if the air had agreed to hold its breath for something to pass.

I sat up on the couch, blinking through the crust of sleep and hangover. I could feel my heart pounding and didn’t know why — like I had sprinted through something in a dream I couldn’t remember.

The TV was on, though I hadn’t touched the remote. The afternoon news again. 3pm. Same time. Same story. They were still covering Mark’s death. Still no answers.

Only now… something was off.

I recognized the footage they were playing. A clip from our jobsite's security feed — one I had watched a dozen times already. But this time, there was something *new*.

A shape. In the dark.

In the brief frame between when Mark walked into the office and when the lights shut off — just before everything went black — I saw it: a figure, standing in the doorway. Still. Unmoving.

It wasn’t there before.

I knew it wasn’t. I had scrubbed that footage frame by frame the day I got laid off. But now it stood there, tall, half-silhouetted, and familiar in shape.

Too familiar.

In that moment, some disembodied voice in my head, which sounded nothing like the internal monologue I spent 23 years of my life with, uttered the possibility;

"What if those dreams...are just memories?"

I reached for my phone and tried to rewind the live TV. It wouldn’t let me.

Then the screen went black.

Not just the TV — the *room*. All the power died. Every outlet, every light.

Silence.

Then... footsteps. Wet ones. Like boots stepping through puddles on concrete. But I was alone. I *was*.

I gripped the edge of the couch and waited.

The footsteps got closer.

And then — they stopped.

Right behind me.

But I couldn't turn around. I tried. My body refused.

Then a voice spoke, raspy and low, like someone trying to remember how to speak through sand. A smoker's voice, like mine.

“You never asked who *else* hated him.”

I turned — finally.

What I saw...

It was me.

But not me. Paler. Like he'd lived in moonlight all his life. Same eyes. Same jaw.  
Same beard, same moustache.  
Same mud-stained boots.

But no hardhat. No vest. No color in his face. Just a smile — tired and cold.

“I thought...it was a dream...” I muttered.

He nodded. “You chased me through one.”

And suddenly, I *remembered*.

Running through streets that bent sideways, chasing a man I couldn't see clearly. Always behind him. Always just one step away. And then — just before I woke up — I saw his face turn toward me in the mirror of a broken shop window.

It had been *mine*. Not my own reflection caught at an angle which I couldn't comprehend,  
but *my* face on the body of another whose existence was the most haunting concept I could've ever imagined.

“I needed a door,” he said. “A moment. Something to step through.”

“You killed Mark?”

He looked at me for a long, long time. And then he said, “*We* did.”

I opened my mouth to speak, but he was already fading — like the shadow of breath on glass, vanishing without a sound.

The power returned with a sudden hum. The TV turned back on.

The footage now showed nothing. No shadow. No figure. Just Mark, walking in, and the lights going out.

I stared at the screen until the news anchor returned, smiling as if nothing had changed.

But everything had.

I still don’t know who — or *what* — he was. A version of me from somewhere else? A dream that slipped loose from its leash?

All I know is this:

Every time I fall asleep now, I find myself running again.

But this time, he’s not ahead of me.

I am.

And I can feel him getting closer.

Every night.

Closer.
