Do to my behavior at school I was sent to a boarding school’s the first day I got there. I was pushed into a class so I can learn the rules of this crazy school.

Days later, I found a sticky goo goo dripping from my bed but I couldn’t tell anybody about it. I couldn’t talk to people when it was bedtime I snuck out I found more of that sticky goo but I didn’t wanna get caught so I went back to my room. 

The only friend I made was Timothy. We were talking secret for but Timothy decided he wanted to see what would happen if you talk back to the teacher who were missing later on that day. I was terrified to see what would happen if I did that. Later that year a bunch of other kids were missing there was two kids me and another girl. 

I knew she is terrified to be here like she seen something and I think she did.

Today seem like a normal day we woke up, put on our uniforms and got  ready for class but this time I could hear a bunch of teachers running down the hallways, I ignored it. When I walked into class, the teacher wasn’t there that was strange. The only thing they let us have was a laptop for homework purposes so I pulled out my laptop even knows it was uncommon to get work on it. 

The other girl walked in she asked me where is our teacher I was about to answer but the school went on lockdown. All I could hear, was running up and down the hallways, godly screams and slamming of doors but when it was locked down, the doors were metal who could slam open doors made out of metal? I asked myself I was terrified. We didn’t know what to do. We just sat there, thinking that I’ll be over in a couple of minutes or hours. We heard gunshots and screams now there was a bunch of black goo dripping from the ceiling.

We try to call for help but I don’t think anyone heard us or maybe did they just didn’t care.

Suddenly I just went silent. We knew what that meant. The school was a Bandan, but those things they were trying to get rid of wasn’t gone, we could hear the stomping and the screams.

I don’t think we have much time left before our was suffering, end’s too I don’t know how long it’s been. It’s been days only surviving off of the water bottles and I’ll teachers cabinet but I know those water bottles aren’t normal.

To whoever finds this these are my final goodbyes.
