It was hot. The windows were open, but the summer air was stubborn. I watched the sun fade from view beyond the tall buildings across the way. As it set, the shadows in the dingy room loomed longer and longer. I traced a finger through the thin film of sweat marinating on my face. A bead of it snaked its way down the middle of my back.

Darkness blanketed the city. It wouldn’t be long now. I picked at the scabs on my neck and sank to the floor. I hate when night falls. 

The call came drifting in through my open windows on invisible currents of dark air. It always hits like a truck, and tonight was no exception. If I had been standing when it arrived, I would’ve collapsed.

*Come to me*. It coiled around my brain, yanked on it, made my teeth ache. It pulsed in my skull like a fist pounding on a closed door.

*Come to me*. My muscles clenched and spasmed, the force of it cracking a rib. The call shot white-hot through my every nerve. Bloody drool mixed with sweat and urine in a rancid puddle. 

*Come to me*. I couldn’t, not again. I pleaded for release, but it was relentless. I was certain that this time I wouldn’t survive. 

After what felt like hours, the call’s demands quieted, slowly fading away until the sound of it was overtaken by my own low moaning.

More time passed before I managed to grit my teeth and rise. The moon had risen already. Its pale face in the night sky made me shudder. I half-considered turning on the lights to banish the crawling shadows, but the persistent throbbing behind my eyes quickly disabused me of that notion.

I moved clumsily, passing by the stack of envelopes lying abandoned by the door. I’d get to them soon, I thought. I couldn’t focus enough for it now. I was drunk on the lingering pain.

I took stock of the pills scattered haphazardly around my bathroom. Anyone would mistake me for a junkie by the state of the place. Probably for the best that I could hardly remember the last time I had visitors.

I washed the handful of pills down with dregs of cough syrup. My stomach protested the intrusion. When was the last time I had eaten? I couldn’t be sure. It was all a little fuzzy - everything but the call.

I propped myself up against the wall and retrieved my phone from my pocket. The screen was cracked. When had that happened? Three missed calls and another text from my sister. She was worried about me. I wished she wouldn’t bother. At least my boss had given up trying to reach me. No new messages from her. It was a small mercy but I was grateful for it.

I made my way to the sofa and waited for the pill concoction to kick in. I could still feel the call, diminished though it was, writhing gently like a playful worm in the base of my skull.

The worst of my pain found itself replaced by rising anxiety. It welled up rapidly as the minutes passed, like vomit hurtling its way up my throat. I could taste the bile. Saliva pooled in my mouth.

I had ignored the call. He wouldn’t take it kindly. It might even spur him to take action, to punish me. He would come and visit his displeasure upon me, or else upon my family. I was afraid, of course, but the thought also elicited another feeling in me, something resembling excitement. I pushed the revolting sensation away.

I had never gone this long without answering the call. I had never ignored him before, not really. Of course I had tried but its pull was inexorable. What happened now? I had made things worse, of that there was no question. The thought was suffocating. I began to sweat again, profusely. I was itchy too. The wounds on my neck pricked. I felt cold, then hot, and then freezing. I stripped. I wrapped myself in a filthy blanket. I was going to be sick. I picked myself up and staggered back in the direction of the bathroom, but I didn’t make it. My stomach elected to empty itself on a pile of laundry instead.

I couldn’t stay here. This was where he would come first. I needed to leave, go anywhere else, find something to distract me from what was to come.

I retrieved my phone from the pants I had abandoned. I scrolled through my contacts for someone I could call, somebody I hadn’t seen in a while. Somebody who didn’t know or care what I was like now. I settled on Evan.

I hadn’t spoken to him since college. Three years, or four maybe. He was a big partier back then, bigger than I ever was. I sent him a quick text: *Hey man, long time no see. What are you doing tonight?*

His reply came swiftly. He wanted to know if there was somewhere we could go to really party. Fraternity ties and old patterns held fast, which was exactly what I needed. I said I did know a place, but only to get him to come out with me. I would figure out where we were going after I was no longer alone.

I picked him up twenty minutes later. If my pallid complexion and obvious thinness, the visible bruises and oozing sores, had surprised him, he concealed it well. More likely he just didn’t care. I thought he looked well enough, comparatively at least, but he had obviously had a significant head start with the drinks. All the better.

It was awkward. He asked about my life in slurred words and barely strung together sentences. 

“Living the dream,” I forced out in a half-laugh, my voice cracking. 

I didn’t ask about his life. I didn’t want to know. I suspected the silence was more awkward for him than it was for me. 

He loosened up considerably after he found the coke stashed in the glove compartment. I’d forgotten it was in there. I told him to help himself and he did, gleefully. After that, he talked enough to fill the air all on his own, not waiting for my responses. I preferred it that way.

“Where are we?” He asked as I removed the keys from the ignition. I’d stopped the car. I knew where we were; I hadn’t meant to drive us here, and yet we had arrived. My heart rate spiked as he looked at me with unfocused eyes.

“It’s a private place. Invitation only. They’ve got good stuff.” The lie came easy. He was eager to be reassured, I could tell. He didn’t really care where we were so long as there something he could smoke or funnel up his nose. “It’s just around the side. Watch your step.” 

Evan stumbled into the shadows and I followed. The condemned building loomed above us, all concrete and broken glass. The scant illumination of the streetlights, those that still worked at least, didn’t reach this far.

If Evan had been smarter, more cautious, if he hadn’t worked so hard to dull his senses, it probably wouldn’t have worked out like it did. As it was, the realization dawned on him only a moment before the brick followed suit. He crumpled to the ground. I rubbed my shoulder. It was sore from the impact. 

I stood over Evan for a moment before bending down to check his pulse. Alive, thank God. The thought took me by surprise and I chuckled nervously as it registered. I doubted God wanted anything to do with this. If I was lucky, He had averted His eyes.

I took hold of Evan’s legs and began to drag. He was lighter than I thought he would be, or maybe I was stronger. The hatch was just ahead. I knew my way even in the dark. It was concealed by trash and debris and locked tight, just as I had left it. I put Evan’s legs down and reached for the lock. It fell away at my touch and I pulled the handle. Its rusty hinges screeched in protest, but the resistance was minimal.

The first time I came to this place followed weeks of intense dreams. Or maybe they weren’t dreams, but visitations. I didn’t know. I couldn’t remember. The memories were there, I could conjure them up given enough time and energy, but it felt like pulling rocks from a swamp. Nothing could be freed without a fight. All I knew was that he had come to me and I had welcomed him. I called him the Caller. If he had another name, I didn’t know it.

His presence had filled me with radiant joy, sparkling and effervescent and alien, and his absence had left me a gibbering wreck. He never spoke, but I caught his meaning regardless. He made promises, whispered gifts in the empty air, that wait still for me to be deserving of their fulfillment.

People noticed I was different, tired, pale and unfocused. I couldn’t describe what was happening without sounding psychotic. The word “schizophrenia” was thrown around a few times, as was “crackhead.” Either of those would’ve been preferable, really.

Eventually, the Caller had stopped coming and started calling. That was when I had sought him out myself, in person, and found the hatch in a condemned building on the rough side of town. I began to visit regularly, always after sundown, to mollify the sickness that overtook me when he wasn’t there. Any recollection of those occasions was wrapped tightly, caught in the sticky blackness of my mind. Like a fly in a web. I wondered if the memories struggled like flies do.

I carried Evan gingerly down the roughly-hewn steps. I was careful not to drop him. I had made enough mistakes that night already without bungling this too.

The air in the cellar was stale and fragrant with the smell of rot. I would’ve gagged if I weren’t so used to it. I recalled vaguely how sweet it had seemed those first few times, how pleasant, how relaxed it had made me. The mask had dropped. He didn’t care to put up appearances any longer, nor did he need to.

I laid Evan down on the floor and knelt beside him. I kept my eyes low to the ground. My heart pounded in my chest. It was equal parts fear and anticipation. Despite myself, I wanted to see him, and he knew it. He had known I would come. But I was late. I had ignored the call, or tried to anyway. My breaths came ragged, utterly at odds with the peace of Evan’s head trauma-induced slumber. I tried to steady myself. There would be consequences for my disobedience, and I would suffer as I deserved.

If I had been bold or arrogant enough to lift my head or raise my eyes, I would’ve seen him despite the pitch black. Yellow eyes in a pale face, a slender frame clothed in rags. Graceful and divine, foul and corrupt. Beauty so intense it was ugly. 

His presence unfurled in the dark like a bird of prey. I felt his mind on mine, pressing against the back of my eyes and the boundaries of my skull. I readied myself for reprisal, for the punishment I had brought upon myself.

It didn’t come. I stayed motionless, except for the trembling I could not control, as the Caller fell upon Evan. It was savage and wild, like a wolf gone rabid. It went on long past the point of his need. I suspect some of that was for my benefit.

When it was done and Evan lay in pieces, dry as desert sands, I waited for my turn. As much as I dreaded the pain of reprimand, I craved just a moment of his attention. If I’d had an ounce of courage, I would have thrown myself to the floor and begged for forgiveness, for judgment, for some recognition of my crime. Anything for an acknowledgement. But if he was upset, or disappointed in me, if he harboured rage or sorrow at my betrayal, he did not make it known to me then. He only turned and slinked back into the impenetrable shadows.

I stayed for a long while after he had returned to his rest. I knew what came next. It was my charge now to gather up the bloodless scraps that had been Evan, the fragments of bone and gnawed tissue, and dispose of them discreetly, but I felt stuck. I was mired in the disgust, the shame, the revulsion, and the relief. I had failed. Failed to answer his call, failed to escape, failed to impress. The hooks were still in place, irresistible and implacable. They would pull me back time and again. I would never be free.

I stayed there until the feelings faded and I grew bored. My knees hurt from kneeling, and my chest ached from breathing the foul air. It was time to go.

I gathered up what remained of Evan in the black garbage bag I’d folded into my pocket earlier. Just in case, I had told myself. Like I hadn’t already known what was going to happen.

The bag split open at the bottom as I made my way up the uneven stairs. I sighed and pushed the hatch open. I would have to figure something else out. 

I poked my head out of the hatch, eyes bleary and head pounding, and looked around to make sure nobody was watching. No one was, though I did spot a man sleeping rough in a shaded patch a short distance away. He looked like he’d had some hard times recently. I probably didn’t look much better. I wondered if he slept there often; I hadn’t seen him before. Would anybody notice if he…

*No*. I mentally slapped myself. I couldn’t think like that. This could never happen again, and this time I meant it. I would ignore the call next time. Really ignore it, for good. I wouldn’t come here ever again. How many times had I made that selfsame promise?

I watched as the first of the sun’s rays began to streak across the sky. It made me nauseous. I hate when day breaks.
