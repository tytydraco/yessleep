ATTENTION: FORMAT IS EDITED BY CHATGPT, STORY IS REAL
I’ve never shared this online before.
Not because I’m scared of being judged… but because even today, I have no logical explanation for what I saw.

This happened in 2005, when I was a kid staying with my grandparents in Nilambur, Kerala — back when the place was so underdeveloped that nights were pitch black and silence felt… alive.

My grandfather worked as a surgeon at the PG Hospital, and our house sat near the edge of the forest. Streetlights barely existed. You relied on petromax lamps, muscle memory, and old-school courage.

🌑 The Chocolate-Night Incident

One night, I threw a tantrum because I wanted chocolates.
My grandfather, being softhearted, picked me up, grabbed a petromax, and walked me to a tiny shop down the dark road.

Everything was quiet. Too quiet.

On our way back, I suddenly pointed behind him and said:

“Achacha… bull!!”

A huge black bull was walking toward us, silent, slow, watching us.
The way it moved… something about it felt wrong. Its footsteps were soft — almost human-soft.

My grandpa’s reaction was strange.
He didn’t panic.
He didn’t protect me.
He studied it.

Then out of nowhere, he walked toward a pile of burning garbage, picked up a half-burning log, turned around, and WHACKED the bull on its left side.

Hard.
Too hard for a normal animal.

I screamed, “Why did you hit it?!”

He looked at me, annoyed — but also with something like fear buried under his calm.

> “You won’t understand.”



The “bull” stumbled, then ran away into the darkness.

☀️ The Next Morning

It was Sunday.
We went for our usual morning walk and bought fish. On the way back, my grandpa suddenly slowed down.

A man was standing by the side of the road.

A thin man in a white dhoti, with a ponnada over his shoulder…
and a massive burn mark on the left side of his body.

The EXACT spot where my grandfather hit the bull.

He looked at my grandfather with embarrassment, fear, and submission all at once.

Then he said softly:

> “I’m sorry… I won’t follow you both again.”



And he walked into the trees.

I didn’t understand.
Why was a grown man apologizing?
Why was his burn mark exactly where the bull was hit?
Why was my grandfather so tense?

My grandfather just tugged my hand and walked faster.
He never explained.

🐂 Thirteen Years Later…

2018. 

The Mohanlal film “Odiyan” came out.
Suddenly everyone in my hostel started talking about Odiyans — real stories, folklore, sightings, eyewitness accounts.

They said Odiyans were:

men trained in stealth

able to transform their silhouette using bull hides

capable of crawling and running like animals

silent, extremely fast

used for intimidation, stalking, or hired “jobs”


My heart dropped.

Every detail matched.

The slow silent “bull.”
My grandfather’s reaction.
The burn mark.
The apology.
The location — Nilambur, a known Odiyan zone.

And I realized…

That night, I didn’t see a bull.
I saw a human.
A trained, real-life Odiyan — the kind old Kerala whispered about but never openly admitted.

I swear on everything I love:
Odiyans are not myths. I saw one with my own eyes.
