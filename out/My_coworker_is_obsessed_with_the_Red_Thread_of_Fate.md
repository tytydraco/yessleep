I’m Ethan, a 25-year-old guy that used to live in the heart of the city. I’ve got a complicated financial situation, trying to make ends meet with my job as a graphic designer while managing student loans and rent for my cozy apartment. But lately, things have taken a terrifying turn, and I need some advice.

It all started a couple of months ago when a new employee, Lily, joined my office. She’s 23, skinny with long black hair and these intense green eyes. At first, she just seemed shy, always staring at me during meetings. I kinda picked up a vibe with her so I decided to get to know her better and asked her out for coffee.

Our first date was pleasant enough. Lily was quiet and seemed genuinely interested in me. We talked about work, hobbies, and life in the city. On our second date, she started talking about her beliefs and superstitions. Lily was really into astrology, tarot cards, and the idea of fate. I found it a bit odd but thought it was harmless, I've never actually believed in these things but I don't criticize anyone who believes.

Then, on our third date, she introduced me to the concept of the Red Thread of Destiny. It’s a belief from East Asian folklore that says an invisible red thread connects those who are destined to be together, regardless of time, place, or circumstances. According to the legend, the thread may stretch or tangle, but it will never break.

Lily’s eyes lit up as she explained this to me, saying she felt a strong connection between us. She even brought a small spool of red thread as a "symbol of our bond." I was taken aback but didn't want to be rude, so I just nodded along.

After that, things started to get creepy. Lily would mention the red thread constantly, saying things like, "Our thread is so strong, don’t you feel it?" She even started tying red thread to my belongings—my bag, my coffee cup at work, even my car’s rearview mirror.

One night, I woke up to a soft rustling sound in my apartment. My heart pounded as I grabbed a baseball bat and crept toward the living room. There she was, standing in the moonlight, holding a spool of red thread.

"Ethan, don’t you see?" she whispered. "We are connected by the Red Thread of Destiny. I’ve always known it. I just had to make you see."

I was freaked out. I told her to leave, and she did, but not before saying, "I will make you see."

I thought that would be the end of it, but I was wrong. Red thread started appearing everywhere—on my doorknob, my car, even at work. The notes became more frantic and desperate.

Then, I got a call from an unknown number. It was Lily. "You can’t escape our destiny. The thread will always lead you back to me."

I called the police, but they couldn’t do much without concrete evidence. Desperate, I decided to stay with my friend Mark, who lives on the outskirts of the city. But even there, Lily found me. One night, I saw her standing in the shadows outside, holding a spool of red thread and a pair of scissors.

"Why can’t you understand?" she called softly. "We are meant to be together, Ethan."

I called the police again, but by the time they arrived, she was gone. I knew I couldn’t keep putting my friend at risk, so I left the city, hoping distance would break her hold. Financially, it was a huge strain, but I didn't have much of a choice.

For a while, it seemed to work. I moved to a small town several hours away, started a new job, and slowly began to relax. But then, I found a red thread tied to my doorknob with a note: "You can’t escape destiny, Ethan. I’m coming for you."

I’m terrified. It seems there’s no running from Lily and her delusion of the Red Thread of Destiny. What should I do? How do I escape someone who truly believes we’re fated to be together?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
