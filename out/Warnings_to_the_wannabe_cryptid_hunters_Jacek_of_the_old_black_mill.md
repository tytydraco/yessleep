All millers are proficient in the dark arts. Often, they're also in the direct employ of the Devil. Now, that's a fact, and if anyone tells you differently, they're either talking out of their ass or they're a miller themselves. 

Some millers only study black magic to ward off the water spirits and protect their mill and river from harmful influences. Others have sworn themselves to the Beast entirely. That's why millers are dangerous folk; you can never tell with them.

I knew all that. And it didn't stop me. Also, y'all should know going into this that I'm about to talk about some major horniness on my part. I was younger, don't judge… or do. I don't really care.

Jacek came to our house one autumn day not long after I'd turned nineteen. I remember sitting out on the balcony, drinking in the golden sunlight weaving through the red leaves of the trees outside our house. Casimir was sitting behind me on my bed—he always used to come into my room to watch TV as Mom wouldn't get him one of his own. I perked up when I saw a figure approaching from beyond the treeline. 

"Someone's coming," I announced to my brother. 

"Who?" he asked, not looking up.

"Looks like someone from the woods." I leaned over the railing of the balcony, squinting to make out more of the stranger. Two arms, two legs, one head. Male. "Seems normal enough, though," I added.

"Probably some new hire," Cas replied absently.

"Maybe…" I leaned out just a little further, watching as the figure drew closer. Something told me he wasn't one of our employees. Just as the man started actually coming into view, he stopped in his tracks. My heart sank when he abruptly raised his head to meet my gaze. His stare was piercing, despite the distance between us. It sent a warm, pleasant chill up my spine. He stayed in place, gazing up at me.

I tilted my head.

He mirrored the movement.

That's when my mother burst through the front door, grabbing the stranger by the arm and starting to drag him inside. Wasting no time, I rushed down the stairs on my tip-toes, coming to a halt right outside the living room door. I could hear Mom talking excitedly on the other side.

"Oh, Jacuś, it's been so long! Look at you."

I have to confess I only learned how to spell that nickname much later; she pronounced it yah-tsoosh. 

"I guess it's been… a while…" The young man cleared his throat. His voice was incredibly deep and husky, but somehow soft and pleasant at the same time. "It's nice to see you again, Mrs Novak."

"Likewise, sweetie! My, you've grown."

"Is your husband around?"

"Nope! No need to worry about that old grouch. Have a seat…"

I glanced down at myself. Nope. New clothes. *Better* clothes. I raced up the stairs again, ignoring my little brother's bewildered stare as I proceeded to tear my room apart for something nicer to wear. I found a cute little blouse with one hell of a cleavage and hastily pulled it on. Back downstairs, I took a deep breath, bracing myself as I nudged open the door. 

My mother was sitting at the dinner table, across from her the most stunning creature I'd ever seen. He wasn't conventionally attractive—his dark hair was frizzy, tousled and unkempt, his skin pale and kind of veiny—but that man had eyes like an inkwell. He was lean as a whippet but had surprisingly broad shoulders and visibly muscled arms. 

He looked over to me, regarding me with a blank stare I couldn't quite interpret. Then, he tilted his head.

I mirrored the movement.

His mouth slowly began to curve into a smile.

"Oh, hi honey!" my mother chirped. "Jacuś, this is Fiona, my eldest. I've told you about her, remember?"

When he rose to his feet, he stood at the exact same height as me. I briefly forgot how to walk and *hopped* over to shake his hand instead. He clasped it fast and with such eagerness that I nearly withdrew, but the touch itself was gentle and cautious. Somewhere in the distance, my mother explained, "Fiona, this is Jacek Hettmann from the black gristmill."

"How come we haven't met before?" My question was directed at both my mother and the young man. 

"Our families have actually been friends for generations! Jacek's father and I basically grew up together, and I've known Jacek since he was a little baby. They used to come over a lot, but when I married your Dad, he kept on complaining about us getting together. I haven't seen Jacuś for over a decade now!" My mother let out a deep sigh, shaking her head at me. "Your Dad is just *riddled* with fear. He didn't want any of you kids to associate with the Hettmanns."

"Shame," I said breathily.

"So anyways, it's about time you kids met! Jacuś lives all alone out there with his old man; it's about time he made friends with someone his age," my mother went on.

Jacek leaned in very quickly to whisper in my ear, "Seriously, don't call me Jacuś. I'm not a little boy anymore."

"I can see that," I assured him, smile widening as I took the opportunity to just very, very lightly stroke his thumb.

He swallowed audibly. "G-good."

"Say, why isn't your father with you? I miss that guy," Mom chimed in.

Jacek straightened up, his cheeks losing a bit of their color. "Oh, he's dead. That's why I came here. Figured you should know."

Mom let out a sharp little cry. Tears began to spill from her eyes as she started sobbing uncontrollably. I was speechless. The way he'd delivered these news, flatly and without even blinking, had really thrown me off guard.

"That's horrible. God, I'm so sorry," I pressed out, my overloaded mind struggling to adapt to the mood change.

"I'm alright," he replied with a shrug. "He's been sick for a few years now. I was expecting it."

"But now you're all alone out there!" Mom protested, losing herself in a fit of sobs.

"I miss him but I'll be fine." He sounded sincere.

Walking over to my mother, I wrapped a comforting arm around her. Jacek regarded us, looking distinctly uneasy. "I'll leave you to it," he muttered. Just as he passed me, he leaned in once more, speaking again in that quick, hushed voice. 

"Meet me outside."

I swallowed. Had I heard that right?

As he went for the door, he pointed out at the garden, silently raising a brow. I nodded. I stayed inside to comfort my mother for five more minutes before inconspicuously withdrawing myself and following Jacek. Stepping outside, I spotted him clinging to the trunk of one of our trees like a big squirrel. I hastily jogged up to him and he dropped to the ground.

"Hi," he said, looking a little flustered.

"Hi."

"Okay, so… I meant to approach your mother about this, originally. She's always been like an aunt to me. But when I saw how emotional she got… I didn't wanna burden her any further. So now I figured maybe you could lend me a hand."

I shamefully pushed back an obscene yet intrusive thought about "lending him a hand."

"It's about my father. Don't fuss now, okay?" Jacek coughed softly. "The thing is, he didn't die of an illness."

"What do you mean?" I asked with a frown.

"Something killed him. And I might not be the type for mourning, but all the more for payback." His voice had somehow gotten even deeper.

"How do you mean to exact that payback?"

"A ritual. Simple enough. I have everything I need, except virgin blood."

I flushed. "Sorry to disappoint, but, uh… I can't help you with that."

He gave me a puzzled look before awkwardly clearing his throat. "Common misconception, actually. Virgin blood simply means blood that hasn't been used for another incantation or rite before."

I perked up. "Oh, well, that I've got!"

"And you'd let me use it? We'd have to meet up again at my place, though. Make sure to wear some sort of religious symbol. Oh, and I *would* have to cut you a little bit."

"I won't mind," I promised, inching closer.

He stifled a shivering sigh, nearly succeeding. "I'd be very gentle, too," he added in a lower tone. 

We parted on that note, and I ran for my room, shoving Cas off my bed and burying my face in my pillow to scream into. Now, you'd think my demeanor rather childish for a nineteen year-old, but you have to understand just how this man excited me. Of course, I didn't know how to interpret the whole thing with his father. He didn't seem to be grieving, but perhaps he was simply in a bit of a volatile state. Maybe he was keeping his sadness to himself. I swore to myself that I wouldn't try anything. 

Jacek came to pick me up around nightfall. Having snuck downstairs, I waited for him outside. He appeared without making a sound—how he did so was beyond me, seeing as our lawn was blanketed in dead leaves. 

"Are you ready?" he asked quietly.

I nodded, holding up the cross on the necklace I was wearing to show him I hadn't forgotten. Off to the old gristmill we were. 

"I wasn't sure you'd actually show up," Jacek admitted. 

"Why's that?"

"I don't know. I feel like I kinda gave off a weird vibe earlier. I'm not usually around girls, you know. Except for the mermaids, maybe, but they don't count."

"I didn't even know there was a mill in the woods," I remarked. "Why doesn't my father want me around you?"

"Your mom says he's wary of devil-worshippers."

I stopped in my tracks. "Of what now?"

"The mill belongs to the Devil. We just work there for Him." Jacek turned to look at me. "I'm sorry, should I have said something about that earlier? I just figured you wouldn't mind. Your mom doesn't, even though she wears that cross."

"I don't *mind* per se, it's just… surprising."

"Haven't met many millers yet, have you?"

I followed him nevertheless, and I was rather astonished when the mill came into view. It was the first time I'd been to that particular part of the forest. I've already described the building itself in a previous post of mine, but the black structure looked even more intimidating at night. Despite there not being any water pushing it, the big wheel was turning laboriously. I knew then not to question it. 

Jacek held the door for me. "Everything's ready. Sorry if it's dusty, we never clean."

He led me up the stairs into what looked to be his and his father's living quarters. Everything was quite spartanic and untidy. A few lamps came flickering to light as I passed them to take a seat on the floor. It was only when the room was fully illuminated that I saw the chalk drawings beneath us. A big, upside down pentagram right in the center of the room, surrounded by a ton of symbols I didn't recognize. I watched as Jacek bent down to place a candle at each of the pentagram's tips and finally one in the middle. I caught the box of matches he tossed me in mid-air and went about lighting them.

After rummaging around in the back of the room, Jacek joined me on the floor, holding up a dagger. I swallowed hard.

"You're not gonna kill me with that thing though, right?"

He instantly pressed a hand to his chest. "Cross my heart. You trust me?"

"Kinda feel like I shouldn't, but yeah."

Jacek treated me to a fine smile as he scooted closer to me. "I'm just gonna… take your hand there…" Without further ado, he dragged the blade across my palm. It left a burning red line in its wake. I hissed, but altogether, it wasn't so bad.

"Quick, squeeze it out in the middle!" Jacek instructed. "Over the candle!"

I crawled forward and obediently let the blood trickle onto the dancing flame. Pumping my fist, I pressed out as much as I could before pulling back and licking off the rest. I was about to turn to face Jacek again when suddenly, all the lights in the room went off. The five candles at the pentagram's tips flared up once and then died. The only flame remaining was the one in the middle, burning fiercer than ever in a deep, crimson light. I let out a soft gasp, startling when I felt Jacek's hand on my shoulder.

"It's working," he whispered. "He's coming now." Pressing the dagger into my hands, he added, "Keep this on you for later."

I was starting to wish he'd at least given me a briefing before all of this. The floor beneath us started to shake hard enough to send the furniture bouncing. Jacek pulled me away from the pentagram, pointing at the door. "Once he's here, sneak over there and shut that door," he whispered. "Stab him when the time is right."

The "earthquake" knocked over the candle, and the fire started spreading, quickly filling the entire pentagram but not reaching any further than that. I couldn't feel any heat emanating from it. The flames kept on rising, and suddenly, somebody stepped out from them, as though climbing through a trapdoor. As soon as the person had emerged, the fire died down, leaving no trace. 

It was a guy in a weird-looking red tunic, complementing his wavy ginger hair and heated face. He was immensely wrinkled—not the kind of wrinkled you get when you age. He looked more like someone had taken a skeleton and dressed it in a wide and ill-fitting suit of skin. I physically recoiled at the sight. So this was a demon. It had to be. I had never seen one of those before, and the encounter far exceeded my expectations. Merely looking at this creature masquerading as a human instilled in me a primal, deep-reaching kind of fear. The sort that really turns your guts inside out. Thankfully, the being didn't seem to notice me at all.

"Jacek Hettmann," it gurgled out. "Why did you call on me in such a way?"

"You know what you've done," the young miller replied evenly, jutting his jaw.

"Your father went too far! He laid with my wife!"

*I had some questions.*

"Dude, I don't care," Jacek said flatly. "He was the only kin I'd left. I called you here so you could make it up to me."

The demon let out an incredulous laugh. "You gotta be kidding me!"

Jacek gave me a sidelong glance and I began inching towards the door, my knees nearly buckling every step I took. "So you're not going to apologize?" he asked the creature.

"You're killing me, boy."

"Not yet, I ain't," Jacek answered, and it was at that moment that I slammed the door shut. The demon spun around. His twisted features began displaying something akin to anger. For a moment, I was a bit confused, but then I realized that there was another chalk drawing on this side of the door. It had been open when we arrived there, so I hadn't seen it at first. 

An upturned pentagram.

The demon let out a high-pitched growl but quickly caught himself. "What are you doing, Jacek?" he asked exasperatedly. 

"I just didn't want you to leave so early."

"So now you're locked in here with me. What for?"

Jacek shrugged, raising both hands as he began striding up to the hellspawn with a cheerful grin on his face. The demon tackled him before he could get any closer, pressing the squirming youth to the floor. 

"You forget yourself, boy!" 

"Fiona, now!" Jacek called, and I charged at the struggling pair, not hesitating to jam the dagger into the creature's back. That ended the fight in an instant. The demon let out an ear-piercing cry as his body crumbled into dust. I was trembling all over. Jacek's chest was heaving as he patted down his clothes, staying on his back for a little while to catch his breath. 

"It actually worked!" he exclaimed, a joyful glint in his eyes.

"Wait, you weren't sure it would?" I asked breathlessly, losing my grip on the dagger as it slid through my sweaty fingers. My head was reeling.

"It was a fifty-fifty kinda chance." He pushed himself up. "Fucking hell, but we did it, Fiona! You were so good!" He looked at me with sincere admiration.

"Are you kidding me? That was terrifying! And you weren't even sure we'd make it?"

"Awh, relax, I'm sorry. You were never in any danger, though. That cross 'round your neck. He couldn't see you 'cause of that. He was from the hellsphere of Wrath, and you know how they say fury blinds you…" He trailed off. "It's kinda a whole thing. I could tell you a lot about hellspheres, though, if you want. Sometime."

"I'll think about it." 

"You want me to walk you home?"

"I'll find the way, thanks."

"You mad or something?"

"No."

"Well, that was a straight-up lie, wasn't it. Look, I'm sorry. I should have told you beforehand."

"I'm just… gonna go now."

He sat up, looking sorely uneasy all of a sudden. "Are we good?" he asked, genuine concern creasing his brow.

"Sure," I muttered flatly. Then I repeated in a clearer voice, "Sure," adding a smile. 

"Good. Th-that's good, I wouldn't wanna…" He swallowed. "I wouldn't wanna upset you."

"Oh yeah? Well, I *am* kind of angry. You really should make it up to me, you know." It was a relatively flat statement, but despite my lack of emphasis, he knew exactly what I was hinting at. His jaw dropped. For a moment, he looked like a fish, inky eyes big and incredulous. He opened and closed his mouth a few times in silence. I grinned very, very widely. "Okay then, buh-bye."

Regaining his ability to speak just a little too late, he called after me, "Hey, I took your blood virginity!", laughing as I shut the door behind me.

That was my first encounter with Jacek. Only the first. You didn't think that was all, right? 

He was definitely crazy but it didn't take long for my caution of him and his black magic to be overruled by my attraction to him. I didn't want to be too obvious about it, nor too forward. I told Casimir about the whole thing and he was only too happy to assist. Thus, when winter came and froze the twin lakes, we went practice our figure skating right there by the black mill. 

I always pretended like I didn't see Jacek watching from his window. Just for the fun of it.
