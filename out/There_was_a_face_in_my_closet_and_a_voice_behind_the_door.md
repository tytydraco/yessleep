Let me get ahead of your assumptions: I do not suffer from sleep paralysis. My limbs don’t freeze up, my chest doesn’t experience heavy pressures, and I do *not* hallucinate. There’s a ghost in my house, which I’ve come to call a “bedroom” ghost, because I only ever see him in bedrooms. Sometimes it’s my upstairs bedroom, sometimes the kids’ on the first floor, sometimes the spare guest room across from mine. He doesn’t walk the halls to the various bedrooms, not that I’ve seen, and he doesn’t sit in the corner of your eye when you’re in any other part of the house. If you want to see him, he’s going to be in a bedroom.

Most people, I think, don’t really know how they’d react if they saw a ghost. I’d wager even the artists, authors, and moviemakers tend to get it wrong. You don’t turn a ghastly white, you don’t shriek, you don’t run. At least, I didn’t, and I consider myself as average as it gets. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still damn scary. But in that moment, it feels, I don’t know, foolish to get up and run or scream. It just happens too fast for any of that. I think the scariest thing, the thing that really lingers, is the fact that it’s *real*. One second the world is more or less how you think it is, and the next, you’ve seen a ghost. It changes the way you see everything once you have some assurance that we go on. But the philosophical ramifications of the existence of the Bedroom Ghost are not what I’m here to discuss with you.

My message is actually a good deal briefer. The Bedroom Ghost is evil. You can stop there if you want, because everything I’ve got to say now is just an elaboration on that fact. But do not forget it. I don’t know if this ghost is specific to my bedroom, or if he has a plethora of bedrooms he forays into in the evenings. I don’t see him every night, but I’m sure he keeps busy. So if there’s a chance that one evening, as the moon climbs high and your thoughts begin to wander with decreasing effort into nonsensical dreaming, and you see the glimmer of white eyes ever so faintly in the crack of your closet door, heed these next words, because you may be experiencing a visit from the Bedroom Ghost.

I first saw him one evening when I couldn’t sleep. I’d lived in the house for a while even then, at least five years. My wife had gone to bed before me, per usual, and the kids had gone down at least an hour before her. I enjoyed that quiet time in the evening, a couple of hours just spent reading or playing games or watching a movie that was too violent for my kids or too frightening for my wife. Some guys have an old car in their garage, others have shed beers, others a man-cave with a pool table and stocked bar, but for me, the dark, quiet, midnight house was my escape.

I’d spent the evening watching a bad zombie flick on my laptop, rocking back and forth in the living room recliner, listening to the sounds of exaggerated carnage and corpseish moans, the only light coming from the glowing blue aurora of my screen. When the credits rolled, the clock read just after midnight. Time for me to turn in.

I crept up the stairs, cautious to avoid the creak on the seventh step, and shuffled down the hallway using my phone screen as a flashlight. Whenever I made this walk, I felt like the modern visage of Ebeneezer Scrooge with his candlestick, though I swapped the evening gown for a pair of sweatpants. I was reminded of what it was like to wander a dark hallway alone as a kid, when all the doors and walls are three feet taller, and the darkness is alive with whatever your imagination deems to exist in those shadowy corners. Even as an adult, you don’t really lose that sense of unease, although your ability to rationalize it away is stronger.

I crossed into my room, switched off my phone, and using my own muscle memory of the space, navigated the dark until I was slipping into bed with my wife. I lay there for a while, the images of the movie I had just finished playing in a mental slideshow of cheap effects and lazy dialogue. After maybe ten minutes, I thought sleep would come. It didn’t. My mind wandered a little, the beginnings of a dream beginning to form, but it stopped suddenly at a stir from Elizabeth. I rolled to my other side and tried again. A few more minutes rolled by and my thoughts still would not quiet.

I suspected with growing dread that I may be suffering from another bout of insomnia, an affliction that hit me once or twice a month that made the next day a living hell. Deciding I didn’t want to be a zombie myself at work tomorrow, I resolved to rummage up a melatonin from the medicine cabinet. I sat up, opened my eyes, and froze.

My closet, across from my bed, was a black nowhere six feet from the footboard. And hovering still and silent in that space was a moon. Only it wasn’t a moon, of course it wasn’t a moon. It looked like one, pale and placid, round and illuminescent, suspended against a black, starless, backdrop. And like the moon, it had a face. But this face wasn’t a pattern of craters. It was smiling, and its teeth were white, its cheeks full, its eyes bright and intelligent.

Its hairless visage was both old and young, old in its size, but infantile in its energy, the fullness of its cheeks, the roundness of its chin. And its intelligence, apparent somehow even in those first seconds, was ageless.

I didn’t scream. I didn’t even jump. It looked at me and I looked back at it. There wasn’t any point trying to rationalize it. I wasn’t hallucinating, I wasn’t paralyzed in bed, and I wasn’t dreaming. I felt a tremendous amount of fear, and my hands and feet were shaking, while a sick, cold wind blew out from the closet where it stood or floated. There was no way to think about what I could or should do. I didn’t think to wake my wife or grab my phone or leave the room. There was something a little wondrous to that first night, and strange as it may sound, I didn’t want to turn my head only to look back and find it gone. Some people spend their whole lives looking for something like this, something inexplicable, something truly preternatural. On that first night, I felt almost privileged to be able to look at it, even though I thought I could vomit up my own heart at any second.

Maybe it was my fear, maybe it was shock, maybe it was just the automatic response system of the human body taking over, but as I sat there staring at the pale grinning visage, I did something I can’t really account for. I lifted up my right hand just to my shoulder, and with a little shake, waved at the face.

Its smile broadened.

I still didn’t have words. At the time, I wondered if I’d ever regain the ability to speak. The Ghost didn’t have much to offer at that time either by way of conversation, but in response, I saw a small, disembodied hand, the same pallid shade as the face, appear from the depths of the closet and gently wave back at me.

Then, the face receded into the shadows, the last thing to vanish the long white teeth.

I sat up that night for I don’t know how long. Hours, maybe. I did fall asleep, I must have, because I remember waking up to an alarm and the sounds of my wife readying Duncan and Delphi for school. Of course I was useless that day, both at home and at work. I couldn’t think of anything other than my nocturnal visitor. I didn’t tell Elizabeth about what I saw for the reasons you’d expect: I didn’t want her to think that we lived in a cursed house, or that I was just insane. I’m not insane. Instead, I shambled downstairs, poured my cup of coffee, nodded blankly at the list of to-do items Elizabeth had in store for the day, tied my shoes, and drove to work.

I consider myself a fairly diligent person, but at work that first day I didn’t do a damn thing other than scour the internet for any sort of answer on what I might have seen. Most of the search results suggested sleep paralysis, which I had already ruled out. The other options could be limited to two broad categories: ghosts and demons, although, depending on who you asked, there may not have been much difference between the two. At this point, I probably should’ve done the normal thing and contacted a priest, or a reverend, or someone who knew God better than I did. Of course I, having just seen a ghost, was still somehow too rational to consider the possibility that God could help. Or maybe, perhaps more honestly, there was a part of me that didn’t want to run the thing off. I remember thinking that God had neve bothered to show His face in my closet before, give me a how-do-you-do. Whatever this thing was, it at least had the decency to wave back. What a damn fool thing to believe.

The next couple of weeks went unremarkably. I’d sit up for an hour or two in bed, sometimes with a laptop or a paperback, sometimes with nothing at all but an eye for the open closet door. The face didn’t reappear. The cold wind didn’t blow out. And the shadows did not stir.

I refused to write off the first experience as anything other than factual reality. I knew what I saw, believed in it. I would not convince myself otherwise for the sake of rationalizing. I think I did a decent job keeping the thing to myself as well. I regained my composure after the first day, resumed my work and family obligations, but I really only had one thought buzzing around in my head. I mean, who in my place wouldn’t? Like I said earlier: Undisputed proof of the preternatural, evidence of something beyond just ourselves. Sure, it wasn’t scientific data, tested and peer-reviewed, but it was enough for me. Had I never seen the ghost again, I wonder if I might have sunk further into my obsession with it, forever chasing that singular moment where every truth of the universe I thought self-evident was overturned.

For better or worse, that was not to be my last encounter with the Bedroom Ghost. It was a Saturday. Elizabeth had taken the kids to their gymnastics lesson with her sister. I stayed behind to catch up on some chores. For the first time in weeks, I wasn’t actively thinking about the Ghost. I was just walking down the hall with a basket of dirty laundry in my arms. I walked out of our bedroom and towards Delphine’s. I was reaching for the knob when suddenly the door began pounding from the inside.

I dropped the basket and stumbled back.

“Phi-Phi, you still here? Didn’t Mom take you to gymnastics?” I know, stupid questions, I had literally watched them leave.

“Don’t open the door, Daniel.” A voice from the inside said. It was low and silky, a baritone stronger suited for song than speech. Yet it seemed genderless, ageless, both a man and a woman’s voice, a child’s and a crone’s.

I didn’t open the door. I didn’t pick up the basket. I didn’t move an inch.

“Police report eleven fatalities after a city bus blew a tire on interstate seventy-five,” the voice said suddenly, its tone switching from its impossible combination to that of a female news anchor. “Witnesses to the tragic accident state that the bus’s back right tire blew out, causing the tail end to swerve into a tractor-trailer truck behind it, which led to more vehicles piling up in what is believed to be the deadliest traffic accident of the year so far.”

I didn’t know what to say, what to think, before the voice changed again. It was a man’s voice, but it was accented in what might have been Russian, but it still sounded like a news anchor.

“The latest UN security council numbers indicate the drone strike killed at least seven members of army top brass. There’s not much way of validating these numbers, as the administration is reluctant to report any losses.”

Then the voice changed again.

“I’m so, so, sorry ma’am.” It was a man’s voice, but it was an American accent, maybe from the South. It sounded on the brink of breaking. “I couldn’t see her. We’ve always used this land for hunting, got the warning signs up and everything. I just saw movement by the bait and…”

Then, it was just a shriek. A woman’s shriek, loud, agonized, an answer to the stuttering man’s voice from a second before.

By then, I had collapsed, slumped against the wall, pressing my hands to my ears.

“Daniel,” the voice said in its original impossible intonation. “Daniel.” I didn’t answer. “Daniel.”

“What?!” I demanded.

Nothing. The voice made no answer. Then, it repeated, “Daniel.”

“Who are you?” Now that I had found my voice, I remembered how to use it. “How did you- what was all that?”

“Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Daniel.”

“*What!*” I repeated. There was another pause. Then,

“Daniel.”

In a moment of horror that was somehow worse than even listening to the gruesome reports it had just channeled, I realized that the Ghost was taunting me. Like a playground bully. For lack of a better way of putting it, the Ghost was simply being mean.

“Daniel.”

“Daniel.”  
“Daniel.”

“Don’t open the door, Daniel.”

Once it began talking to me, it wouldn’t stop. If ever I found myself alone in or near a bedroom, it would start up again. It would ask me about work, about Elizabeth, about the kids. It would tell me that the odds Delphi would break her ankle at gymnastics today were significantly higher due to a loose bolt in the balancing beam. It would tell me that Elizabeth had been talking with her sister about feelings she had developed for one of the dads in Delphi’s group, a stern, ex-military, widower who was wholly devoted to his kids, and absolutely did not stay up later than everyone to watch stupid movies or read penny dreadfuls. It would tell me that my job was a dead-end, and my position was invented to satisfy reporting numbers and balance some books, that I could just disappear off the payroll one day and the company would probably be better off for it.

  
But mostly, it just said my name.

  
Over and over again. Sometimes it used Elizabeth’s voice. Sometimes it used the kids, though it had the audacity to call me “Dad” whenever it mimicked them. One time I blew up at it, telling it to fuck off, screaming and cursing, only to realize it really had been Elizabeth calling for me. Of course, that was likely its intention the whole time. To bait me. Get me mad.

 

And always, always, always, the voices came from behind closed doors in my house’s bedrooms. And then there were the evenings. I started sleeping on the couch after I had accidentally yelled at Elizabeth. Doghouse or not, it was a welcome relief from being in a bedroom and near that damned closet. Then, two nights in, the stomping started. My bedroom is just above the living room and, like an upstairs tenet urging his noisy downstairs neighbor to keep quiet, it would stomp the floor over and over again. Dust would shake from the ceiling, it stomped so hard. I collected some of the debris once, held it in my hand to make sure it really was physical dust, that it really had fallen from the ceiling because something had shaken it free. I don’t know how it did this without waking my family. In fact, a small mercy in all this was that it seemed totally uninterested in them, unless it was using their names to torment me.

“Good chance the minivan hydroplanes today,” it said to me as I was getting ready for work one morning after Elizabeth had left with the kids for school. Rain was pounding on the windows outside as I stared directly into my bedroom mirror and fastened my necktie. “Daniel. Did you hear? Much higher than normal chance. Roads are slick slick slick today. And you know how Elizabeth gets when the kids fight, can’t focus. Probably will happen this time, to be frank with you. Daniel.”

I tried to ignore it, slipping the tie through the knot for the third time only for the damn thing to come unraveled again. I looked down, my hands shaking, and managed to get the knot tied. I looked back up at the mirror and leapt back.

The reflection showed it was in the closet again, the face. Grinning. I turned around and sure enough, it was there. It gave me a sly wink.

“Daniel. That’s not even considering what will happen at work today. Didn’t you hear? Evans is launching surprise competency tests. Wants to make sure everyone’s checking their emails, being a team player. How long has it been since you read one of those little things cluttering up your inbox? Doesn’t matter, too late now. Most likely you’ll be let go. Chances are very high for that today. Daniel.”

“Please leave me alone.” I said.

“Daniel? Daniel. Daniel!” It demanded.

“What?” I said.

“Have you heard? It’s not good news, I’m afraid. Cancer. Ugh, I can smell it from here. Your liver, it has to be. Advanced stage, too. Ah, maybe it’s for the best. The children are young, Elizabeth too. Not even forty! Plenty of time for them all to move on. Daniel.”

“Why are you here?” I asked, maybe for the fiftieth time that week.

“Mrs. Ryan? Ma’am, my name is Lieutenant Jack Moser. I served with your husband, Steve. I’m here to-

No, please.  
Steve was a fine soldier.

No, God, please God no please. Please. Please please please please…”

It viciously mimicked the sound of a military wife breaking down for the rest of the time it took for me to leave the house. I never learned if it made up these little tidbits, or if it was channeling something that had actually happened. I never bothered to look up any of the names or stories it gave me, just in case they were true.

I left the house without looking back, though I could feel it glaring at me from the upstairs bedroom window.

I don’t know how I survived those first few months of hell. I prayed a lot. It helped, I think. But if I ever dared to pray aloud, it would get so angry. It would threaten Elizabeth and the kids. So I kept my mouth shut.

At this point in the movies, the protagonist would be figuring out a way to banish the spirit, or otherwise succumb to possession or madness. I wasn’t so lucky as that. It pushed me to the brink of sanity, I think, but never allowed me to slip over the edge. There wasn’t much fun in bullying an insane man, I suppose, because he doesn’t really care all that much anymore. Instead, just as the gulf of madness seemed ready to envelop me, the Bedroom Ghost would reel me back in. It would disappear. Go quiet. Life would improve. Then, just as he was fading to the back of my mind, he would start again. “Daniel.”

Naturally, some of his predictions started coming true. Delphi really did break her ankle at a gymnastics meet, though it was when another girl fell on her rather than a faulty balancing beam. And Elizabeth asked that I start taking the kids on the weekends because, “in the spirit of honesty and love,” she had been *tempted* by another child’s father. Luckily, they didn’t wreck the minivan, nor did I have liver cancer (which I learned only after requesting an extensive and pricey screening).

It’s been four years since the Bedroom Ghost first appeared in my closet. He’s on sabbatical for the time being. It’s his longest yet. Maybe he’s gone for good, maybe he’ll be back. I try not to get my hopes up. Maybe I should take up church in the meantime. I don’t know. I’m so damn tired. I feel like my mind has been stretched again and again like an elastic band, and it loses some of its tautness with each pull. I’ve lost weight, hair, and sleep. My family is still as unaffected as ever, at least. Counting my blessings on that front at least.

I placed my pen down and stare at the pages of the journal chronicling my experience with the Bedroom Ghost. I don’t know why I felt the urge to write it all down, but I’m glad I did. Maybe it will be useful to someone, someday.

I hear the patter of footsteps outside in the hall. The door swung open, a gust of cold air hitting the back of my chair. My heart stopped.

“Dad?”

My shoulders slump with relief. “Hey sport, everything okay?” I spun the desk chair and offer Duncan a weak but earnest smile.

“Yeah, what do you need?”  
“Sorry? Need?”  
“Yeah. Will it take long?”  
“Duncan, what are you talking about?”  
“C’mon Dad, I heard you call my name all the way from downstairs.”
