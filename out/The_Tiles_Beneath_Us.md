Ella was the kind of colleague everyone adored. Working in Human Resources, she had a knack for making even the most tense workplace moments feel light. Her laugh echoed through the office, and her charming nature made everyone feel special. From the newest hire to seasoned managers, people gravitated toward her, trusting her with their stories, and their worries. And after hours? Ella was always the first to suggest a casual drink or an impromptu hangout. Yet, oddly enough, no one ever mentioned these hangouts afterward.



It was as if the evenings with Ella existed in a secret world. She always chose one person, and after that night, they would never be heard from again.



The company had a strange turnover rate. People would simply stop showing up, no notice, no explanation. Rumors floated around about why so many employees vanished, but Ella would always laugh it off with a breezy, “You know how people are—sometimes they just up and leave.”



But the disappearances weren’t accidents or flukes. There was something darker behind the friendly smile Ella wore so well.



The factory where the company produced its tiles was vast, filled with heavy machinery that could crush and mold stone into pristine slabs. These machines were loud, mechanical beasts that worked tirelessly. And at night, when the factory should’ve been silent, the machines would hum, their eerie whirring faintly heard by Marta, the janitor who worked the graveyard shift.



Marta had been with the company for decades. She wasn’t one for gossip, but she had her suspicions about Ella. Small things bothered her—like how Ella’s car was always the last in the parking lot, or how the machines ran late into the night, long after production was supposed to stop. When the police got involved after too many people vanished, they found nothing. No bodies, no evidence, just a string of questions and no answers. The case grew cold, but Marta couldn’t let it go.



One evening, Marta decided to stay behind, hiding in the shadows of the factory, her heart pounding. She watched from the dark as Ella’s car rolled into the lot once again. Marta slipped into the factory through a side door, moving carefully, staying hidden. The rhythmic pounding of the tile press filled the space. Ella, dressed in her usual bright work attire, moved gracefully, but with an eerie calm. Then, Marta saw something that confirmed her worst fears.



Ella dragged a body—wrapped in black plastic—from the trunk of her car. Marta’s hands trembled as she crouched lower, peeking out from behind a stack of unfinished tiles. Ella, humming softly to herself, fed the body into the machine. The grinding gears crushed the remains, mixing blood and bone with the tile materials.



Marta felt sick. The room spun, but she stayed still, barely daring to breathe. Ella worked methodically as if it were just another routine part of her day. Marta knew she had to do something, so the next day, she anonymously tipped off the police. They searched the factory, finding traces of DNA belonging to nine missing employees. Bones, blood, and other fragments were all part of the materials used to make the company’s tiles.



But Ella had covered her tracks too well. Without direct evidence linking her to the bodies, the police couldn’t arrest her. No one had seen her do it—except Marta, but the janitor’s word alone wasn’t enough.



Yet, there was one detail Ella hadn’t counted on. She had a signature piece of jewelry—a silver bracelet with delicate charms that jingled whenever she moved. She wore it everywhere, but during one of her late-night rituals, it slipped off her wrist. The bracelet became embedded in a batch of tiles that the company unknowingly used in their own building. 



Those tiles were installed in the reception area of the office, where Ella greeted employees every morning with a bright smile.



When the tiles were laid, it didn’t take long for people to notice the bracelet. There it was, shimmering beneath the surface of the polished stone. People whispered, their eyes widening as they pieced together what it meant. That bracelet, unmistakably Ella’s, was now part of the very foundation of the company’s building. 



There was no direct proof, but everyone knew. Ella had been there. She was responsible for the disappearances. The charm of the beloved HR manager began to fade, replaced by cold, fearful stares.



Ella knew they couldn’t prove it. She walked through the office with her usual confident stride, a subtle smirk playing on her lips. She’d gotten away with it, and she knew it. No one could touch her.



But Marta couldn’t let it go. She had seen too much and heard too much, and now the image of Ella’s crimes haunted her every waking moment. She knew Ella wouldn’t stop, not unless someone made sure of it.



One night, Marta stayed late again. This time, not to watch, but to act. She followed Ella into the factory, waiting for the perfect moment. As Ella repeated her grim routine, dragging yet another victim toward the tile press, Marta stepped from the shadows.



Without warning, she struck. In one swift move, she shoved Ella into the open mouth of the machine. Ella screamed, but the roar of the tile press swallowed her cries. Marta stood there, watching as the machine ground Ella into dust, just as it had done to her victims.



In the days that followed, a new set of tiles was installed in the home of one of Ella’s victims. A quiet, ordinary kitchen floor. But if you looked closely at the tiles, you could see something faint—something different in the stone. A shimmer, perhaps, or a trace of something that didn’t belong.



Ella was gone, but she would never truly leave. She had become a part of the very tiles she once used to hide her crimes, forever trapped beneath the feet of the living.



And Marta? She walked away, silent and unnoticed, knowing that justice had finally been served.



The predator had become the prey.
