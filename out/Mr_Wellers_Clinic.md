If you ever go into the south, don’t go to Mr. Weller’s Clinic. This was my experience with his clinic.

 

In fall of 2020 during my freshman year of college, I went to visit my family for fall break. I went to school in the New England area (I’m not going to say which state) and my family lived in the Florida peninsula. My girlfriend, I’ll call her Amy for the post, wanted to meet my family. I decided to rent a car and drive down to them. The 26-hour drive would make a good time for us to look at nature. We would stop at popular hiking trails along the way.

 

About thirteen hours into the trip when we were stopping for gas, a weird man approached me.

 

“I see you’ve got \[New Egland\] plates, what brings you all the way down here?” he asked.

 

“Frankly, that’s none of your damn business.” I retorted wondering why the hell he was even talking to me.

 

“gots some spirits doncha?” he asked, more stating than asking. “Mr. Weller’s like a boy with some spirits.”

 

“Get the hell away from me weirdo!” I yelled as I got back into my car. I sat down and looked at Amy. “Who the hell comes up to people and stares at their license plates?”

 

“Maybe he’s trying to be nice,” she said not even looking up from her phone, “You should go apologize.”

 

“That’s not going to happen.” I pulled out of the gas station to continue the journey. This next leg was going to be 100 miles driving through the woods. Luckily there was a convenience store about five miles ahead.

 

It was the longest five miles I’ve ever driven. On one side of the road was a wall of trees, on the other were more trees. The road was completely straight, but the speed limit was only 45 mph. Lifted trucks came and went, always riding my ass then passing the moment the road was clear. I almost hit thirteen deer, four ducks, and a kid on a four-wheeler. When we finally arrived at the convenience store, something felt wrong. My intuition doesn’t usually tell me much, but when it does, I listen. Unfortunately, this was the week I learned to trust it.

 

When we entered the store, every eye in the place was locked onto us. Worst of all, that creep from the gas station was there too. He must have been one of the lifted trucks that passed us on the way here. We tried to shop without letting them bother us. Amy was good at it. I couldn’t even tell if she had noticed the eyes on us.

 

“What a small world.” The creep was back, “If y’all are going to go down on I-118 you might want to stop on by at Mr. Weller’s Clinic.” He said point in the direction we were going.

 

“Oh yeah? Why do you say that?” Amy asked as if she didn’t realize that this was weird.

 

“Well, we always need more blood.” He paused for a moment. “That sounded worse than I meant for it. He is a phlebotomist.” He said as if we were supposed to know what that meant.

 

“Oh… blood donation, that makes sense.” Amy responded. I was beginning to think that she wasn’t pretending to ignore how crazy this was. “Well John is actually a universal donor.”

 

“Oh really? Mr. Weller’s is going to love that.” He said with a grimace in his voice, one that Amy was either ignoring or was completely oblivious to. “Just follow me and I can get you two to Mr. Weller”

 

“Ahhh, well we don’t really have time for that. I’m trying to go see my family for fall break.” I said, obviously trying to get out of this situation.

 

“It’s fine, we were already a day ahead of schedule.” I can only assume Amy trying to get us killed. “We can go give blood to a small community that really needs it. It will be fun.”

 

“Then it’s settled. I’ll show you the way to Mr. Weller.” He declared A large grin forming on his face. “He’ll love to get a universal donor on his hands.”

 

I should have left. I was going to leave, but I couldn’t leave Amy. I should have left Amy, but I didn’t. I could have though. I want to make it clear that I stayed with Amy and went to Mr. Weller’s Clinic, and that was a mistake.

 

We drove through the woods, onto a back road, onto a gravel road, onto a dirt road. We finally arrived at Mr. Weller’s Clinic. Amy seemed excited to donate. The clinic looked like it had been abandoned for decades. There was a tree growing out of one of the windows. Amy didn’t seem to notice, which is odd because she was usually the perceptive one.

 

The crazy old coot led us into the clinic where we say a chair at the front desk facing the other way. It was like a Bond movie when the villain wasn’t revealed yet. The crazy man started talking to the receptionist. He had a full conversation with them, but they never responded. Amy even chimed in occasionally, but the receptionist never talked. They even laughed at a joke no one told.

 

After maybe thirty minutes a tall slender man walked into the room. He was wearing a lab coat and a stethoscope. He was well groomed, blonde hair and gray eyes. Nothing was physically wrong with him, except that he was the only normal thing in the room. He was obviously Mr. Weller.

 

“Ahh. Who do we have here?” his calm soothing voice came sliding out of his throat.

 

“He’s a universal donor.” the creep uttered. “I know how you love the universal donors.”

 

“Well, that’s great Bart, thank you.” Mr. Weller had a smile on his face. It seemed genuine but nothing here was what it seemed here. “If you’d just want to come on back to office with me.” He walked through the door he had just come through. I can’t explain why but I followed him into his office. “Bizarre, isn’t it?”

 

“What is?” other than everything.

 

“It almost feels like they’re not real, doesn’t it?” he asked looking into a clipboard. “Like they can’t see what this place really is.”

 

“What is this place then?” I asked with one hand on the door. I should have left then and there.

 

“In my mind’s eye I see it don’t you?” he asked still prepping the procedure. “Almost Lovecraftian.”

 

“What is this some kind of pagan ritual?” I asked just to try and buy time. I decided that I wasn’t going to deal with this alone “AMY! YOU’RE GOING TO WANT TO SEE THIS!”

 

“What’s going on Derek?” Amy asked as if she didn’t understand. “Do you need me to hold your hand?” Bart walked in with her.

 

I sat in the chair to have my blood taken. “So, Dr. Weller how long have you been doing this?”

 

“It’s just Mr. Weller.” He said with a Dr. Weller name plate on his shirt. “I have been serving him new blood for nearly 40 years.”

 

“Him?”

 

“The creature.”

 

I felt a breath on my neck. “It’s right behind me, isn’t it?” I bolted out of there and grabbed Amy’s hand. I still had the needle in my arm.

 

“What are you doing!?” Amy yelled looking confused.

 

As we passed the receptionist’s desk the chair was turned around and there were just bones in the chair. This place was cursed or something, I guess.

 

We got back in the car, I took the needle out of my arm, and we continued our journey to my parents’ house. Amy broke up with me after the trip was over and we were back in New England. She thought it was weird that I left the clinic like that. I will never go back to Mr. Weller’s Clinic.
