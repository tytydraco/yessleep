I’ve seen bodies mashed, crushed, dismembered, stuffed into suitcases, blackened like meat on a grill, floating, bloating, with flies swarming their flesh and maggots wriggling out of their eyes. I have, in short, an [intimacy with death.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/140khwa/i_went_on_a_cruise_and_all_the_passengers_were/)

But nothing prepared me for the horror in cabin 4044.

I stared at my *own* smoldering corpse, into the blackened sockets of my melted eyes, and ice raked my spine and splintered my bones, shivering all the way down to my frozen fingertips.

*You knew this day would come,* whispered a voice in my head. And then, as my nose wrinkled, *Ugh, I smell like bacon*.

Giggles. Oh dear. Not beneficial. Couldn’t I try to approach my death with some dignity? No? Well… fine. Ignoring my own bubbling hysteria, I held my napkin over my nostrils and leaned in. Cross-legged in a lotus position, hands cradled and thumbs touching, crispy me (hehe) held the pose of a meditating monk. From the liquor bottles scattered around the burnt wreckage as well as the pose, I’d started the fire myself. But what induced such madn—

Glowing white light suddenly emanated from the blackened sockets. I gasped, tumbling backwards over the coffee table.

When I sat up, the light was gone.

It did not reappear during the half hour I charged my phone, keeping one leery eye on my corpse while I used the ship’s spotty wifi for research.

**A Mysterious Contagion**

According to Google, the worst cruise disaster in modern times involved the partial capsizing of a vessel after a captain’s error led to a rock tearing open the hull. Of the four thousand passengers, 34 drowned.

Another ship infamously dubbed the “poop cruise” had its engines catch fire, and passengers were stranded for nearly a week on board without electricity or toilet facilities.

But the Seastar was not destined for any ocean or weather related incident, but rather, a *contagion*. And while coronavirus and norovirus have both afflicted cruise ships in recent years, no virus—not even rabies—could explain the self-mutilation. To say nothing of the virulence. A mortality rate of 100%? That was unheard of in nature. There should be *some* survivors, if only by happenstance.

*Or is it because…*

A terrible chill spread up the flesh of my arms, and a thought lodged like an ice pick in my skull: *What if the doom of the Azure Seastar isn’t happenstance—but deliberate? Are there no survivors because someone doesn’t want there to be?*

Numb at the implication, I set down my phone. But how? Why? A thousand passengers and crew… If there *was* someone planning such a disaster, how would I identify them? And why would anyone commit such an atrocity? My gut tightened, and I got up and ventured out to the upper decks.

**Deck 9**

*Cold. Cold. Cold.* The chill in my bones deepened with each hand I brushed. Passengers glared as I fumbled around, dismissing me as either blind or mentally feeble. The blindness was somewhat accurate—I couldn’t see under the electric lighting in the swanky interior, since my eyes were seeing six days in the future, when the Seastar would be plunged into blackout. I depended on my phone’s feeble flashlight as I navigated the sea of guests around the bar and lounge areas. But no matter how many arms and hands I bumbled into—*COLD!*

With no accidental survivors, I was becoming more and more convinced the Seastar’s doom must be deliberate, but I was still very much in the dark—literally and figuratively—about why.

The most useful discovery of the evening came after my collision with a heavyset older man whose drink I spilled. Noticing me sweeping around my phone’s pitiful beam and assuming I’d lost something, he offered to lend me a more powerful flashlight from his cabin.

“It’s one of those high powered ones if you want it.” He smiled, and I stared, every hair on my neck standing on end.

“Uh… Something on my face?” His smile turned into a confused frown under my phone’s light.

“N-no. Yes, a flashlight would be very helpful, thank you.”

“This way. Name’s John, by the way.” His grin returned.

Oh God—I’d recognized him. Glass chewing man. He had a name now.

I am ashamed to admit that I tried not to speak to him too much on the way to his cabin, despite his doing me a kindness. It’s so much harder to face death with names and histories attached. I remained standing outside his cabin door, looking incredibly guilty as he emerged and set into my hand the flashlight. When I turned it on, it sent a floodlight straight down the corridor one end to the other. In addition to this useful tool, the encounter brought a critical insight.

His clothes. Glass chewing involved a different outfit. So, the catastrophe would not strike tonight.

**Pool deck**

After brushing roughly a billion *COLD* hands, as the overnight crowd began thinning, I took myself out to a lounger (being unwilling to overnight in my cabin wreathed in the fumes of my own chargrilled corpse).

Voices woke me in the dead of night.

The moon and stars offered the only illumination over the pitch sea, and I shambled groggily to the rail. It struck me that the wind had died—the Seastar was stationary.

Out on the pale peaks of waves, a rescue craft bobbed up and down.

“Looks like some idiot went overboard,” complained a voice behind me.

A cluster of passengers had gathered. One—with the authority of an experienced cruiser—mentioned the possibility of a suicide jumper. “It shouldn’t affect our itinerary much,” declared the man. “These things happen at sea, you know. After the rescue, he or she—let’s call them Passenger X—will be taken to the infirmary and monitored by security…”

I didn’t hear the rest of his words, because I was too busy smacking my forehead as I burst, “The *INFIRMARY*!” Good fucking gracious, was my brain *already* barbecue? I suspected a contagion, yet hadn’t thought to search the infirmary? Snatching up my flashlight, I headed downstairs, but the lower decks were cordoned off.

A jovial crewman explained that passenger access was restricted during rescue operations.

“Also, it’s three in the morning,” he added, sipping coffee from a styrofoam cup. “The infirmary will open—I think around eight?”

“Which deck?”

“Deck two.” He gladly explained the layout when I asked. The lower decks also included crew quarters, a crew lounge, mess hall, the engine room, kitchens, food storage, the “highway” used for quickly trafficking trolleys from one end of the ship to the other, the infirmary, various machinery rooms, a brig, a morgue—“We mostly use it for like, chilling flowers and stuff like that though,” he added with a grin. There was also a third staircase near the stern of the ship—the aft stairwell—used regularly only by staff but opened to passengers in cases of emergency.

As he rattled off this list, I could feel myself plunging deeper into despair. This ship was so enormous, and so much of what lay below was off limits to passengers. Furthermore, there were no windows below! How was I going to make my way in the blackout? Even with John’s flashlight, the prospect was daunting.

*But first things first, Cass*, I told myself. The infirmary.

**Infirmary**

At 8am sharp I stepped into the infirmary. The waiting room was as ordinary as they come, complete with boring magazines and cheap office chairs and—because it was deep in the interior—pitch dark to my sleep-deprived eyes.

“Morning, Sweetie! How can I help you today?” The secretary at the front desk tipped her head toward me, revealing a glimpse of another face beneath my flashlight—mouth gaping and mangled, every tooth pulled out. Blissfully unaware that she was sharing her chair with her own corpse, the secretary smiled and gave me a clipboard of paperwork for check in.

While I filled out the forms by flashlight, footsteps shuffled near the desk, and the secretary struck up a conversation with someone I assumed was a nurse. My ears pricked when they gossiped about last night.

“… did you hear about the rescue? When they pulled him out of the water, he wasn’t breathing...”

I pretended to be engrossed in the forms.

“… As soon as they revived him, he started screaming and screaming.”

“Oh my god… seriously?”

“Yeah, and he was like, super aggressive. They had to sedate him.”

“Oh my god…”

“It’s really weird… they’re saying he might have come from another ship, and it might’ve been, like… days… that he was out on the water!”

So this Passenger X who was pulled in last night had just been drifting out on the ocean? He *wasn’t* a jumper? And he was “screaming and screaming”—like, perhaps, someone maddened? I was about to abandon my forms and search for this Passenger X when the secretary all but gave me a heart attack by materializing in front of me out of the dark. She took the paperwork and informed me the nurse was ready. I was directed to a small examination room—one of three, I noted as I swept my beam around the infirmary. Examining tables, chairs, computers. No sign of any screaming passenger. Where would they have brought him?

The nurse, a young woman in a hijab, asked me the typical questions, typing my responses into a computer with a cracked, dead screen.

“Is he all right? The man who was rescued?” I asked. “Was he drifting long?”

She responded pertly, “We’re still trying to ascertain. But don’t worry, he’s being helped—um….” Her brow scrunched as she shone a light into each of my eyes.

Of course. I forgot to warn her.

“That’s so strange…” she murmured. “Are you wearing contact lenses?”

“No. My eyes are very black. Even under a flashlight they don’t reflect any light. They’ve been that way since I was four years old. I was dead for nearly an hour from drowning, but revived, and everything came back normal except for my eyes.” I’d always believed my horrific visions were the result of my near-death experience, as if I wasn’t supposed to come back, and brought a little bit of death with me, just in my eyes.

“Wow! What a wild story!” The nurse exclaimed.

“You have no idea,” I replied, looking at her corpse peering out at me from under the examination table, all jammed around the base.

A knock on the door cut our exam short before I could warn her (not that it would make any difference). She asked me to wait for a few moments and stepped out.

When she did not immediately return, I slipped away in search of Passenger X.

**Highway**

The moment I stepped out of the infirmary and away from the nearby elevator lounge, it became evident I’d left the passenger areas. All veneer of luxury was stripped away, leaving bare walls interrupted only by occasional stacks of boxes. The flashlight’s wide beam swept along the massive corridor that I was guessing was the “highway.” My footsteps resounded on concrete. Nothing but sterile, windowless white—or at least it had been white, once.

I tried not to look too closely at the crimson streaking the walls or the corpses I stepped over. The origin of the contagion was definitely down *here*. Even through the napkin held over my nose, I could taste death here—

Hello? What was this?

In one section of the corridor, the walls and floor had *rippled*. Almost as if a shockwave had left indentations, bending and shattering the concrete. But what could have done that?

The lights flickered.

I froze.

It wasn’t my flashlight’s beam. That remained steady. The lights—the *overhead lights*—flickered, casting the hall in blinking flashes of crimson streaks and white walls.

Then the lights came *on.*

All the bodies vanished.

“Oh,” I said, blinking against the sudden brightness. “*Oh*.” The smell was gone, too. No scent of death. Though there was something else. A strangely metallic, tangy smell. Like lightning and copper.

I shut off my flashlight, turning a slow circle as I gawked at the stark white walls, the flat gray floor, the dazzling fluorescent lighting so bright it almost blinded me. It struck me that I was seeing the ship *right now.* Not six days in the future, but *NOW*, before the blackout, before the outbreak. The same whitewashed hallway as all the other passengers saw.

Why? What had happened to my vision? Had I lost my special sight? Or—

Someone was standing in the corridor.

I froze.

The hairs on my neck prickled, and a knot of dread twisted my gut.

The man stood halfway down the highway, slouched and bedraggled. His clothes were crushed and faded, hanging off him like from hangers of bone. His limp hair draped in messy curls around his unshaven face. And his eyes—those eyes! The same eyes I’d seen looking at me from the deep end of a public swimming pool when I was just a child. The same eyes I’d seen staring emptily from John’s glass-chewing corpse, and from the mangled nurse under the table. All the dead have the exact same look in their eyes. One glance at those pale blue orbs—

This man was *dead.* I was certain of it.

Yet he was standing.

“You,” I said. “You… are you the passenger who—”

The dead man’s lips spread, baring teeth in what might have been a sick imitation of a grin, or a grimace.

“*HEY!!!*”

I jumped as a voice called out behind me.

An officer in a security uniform strode out from an unmarked door, eyes on the dead man. The security officer said, “Ma’am, stay back.” His gaze never left the dead man. “Sir, if you could please come with me—”

“No!” I cried. “Don’t!”

But the security officer was already marching forward, and the dead man’s hands lifted in stiff parody of surrender. He turned and began shuffling away under the officer’s escort. And then—his teeth bared. Suddenly the dead man had his arm around the officer, mouth clamping on his ear as the officer howled. He was *eating* him—no, tongue wriggling—licking him?

—whispering?

The officer shoved the dead man aside and collapsed against the wall. I rushed forward, but skidded to a halt as the dead man’s grinning face turned toward me. Terror seized me at the sudden revelation that I was next. He took a wobbly step—

The lights shut off.

Swearing, I fumbled for my flashlight. Switched on the beam. Shrieked when it fell across a hand—but it was just the security officer reaching for me, asking, “Hey—hey, are you all right, Ma’am?” He winced, rubbing at his ear like a dog bothered by a whistle only it could hear. Then he said into his phone, “He assaulted me and got away. I’ve got another passenger here—”

The stench wafted back. Gore once again splattered the walls. I was once more seeing six days into the future, and clapped my napkin to my mouth to stop myself from retching at the return of the smell. But I wasn’t really thinking about all that.

No, because my heart slammed my ribs and my breath ripped ragged from my throat, and every hair stood on end as if I’d been struck by lightning. Whatever it was the crew of the Seastar had hauled from the ocean, it certainly hadn’t been living when they “rescued” it. And the proof was in those overhead lights. Merely being in proximity to Passenger X, my vision had been pulled into the present. Like he was a magnet drawing my sight into his field. But if death was the thing my black, lightless eyes usually glimpsed, then what exactly *was* Passenger X? And if he could affect my vision, not to mention animating a dead man’s corpse… how was I going to have any hope of [stopping him?](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)
