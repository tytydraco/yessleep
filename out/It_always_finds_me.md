I clawed at the ground as it dragged me away, dirt was trapped under my nails as I clawed and fought. I sobbed defeated, hopeless, no matter what I do it always finds me. Its claws dug into my ankle as it laughed at my suffering, it laughed knowing I was so close to giving up.
“Please go away! Please! please! please!”
My cries were met with more laughter. It brought me closer and closer to the pit in the middle of the field. It told me how worthless and weak I was as we got closer and closer.

 “I am inevitable like the four seasons, day and night, yesterday, today, and tomorrow.” “You can’t escape.” It looked back at me, hate in its eyes and malice in its voice, it sounded demonic. This made me sob harder because I felt it was true, I was forever trapped in a vicious cycle of invisible suffering. I could see the pit now. Screaming came from within, its grip felt like a vice.

It almost began to skip it was anxious and giddy at the thought of me meeting my end. I wiggled, kicked and screamed until my voice was gone and I tasted copper. I felt the fingernail on my index finger break off from my fruitless effort to slow down my path closer and closer to a horrible fate. I could now see the edge of the pit. “NOOO! NOOO! PLEASE! I DON’T WANT TO DIE!” “Yes, you do!” It said with that demonic laugh.

It held my head over the pit, it almost seemed as it was starving for another victim. I fell forward into the pit but I managed to hold on to the edge with one hand. It hated that I still had fight in me, it leaned over the edge putting its face inches from mine. Saliva hit my face, its breath was hot and rancid. “You’re worthless.” “You’d be better off dead.” “You ruin everyone’s life.” “You don’t deserve love.” “You’re disgusting.” “Everyone is better than you.” “You’ll never amount to anything.” “You’ve wasted your life.” “I am the only one that can save you.” “Just give up and let me take control.” “You’ll feel better down there.” “All of your problems will be gone.”

It pointed down. It then began to lift my finger one by one, slowly causing me to lose my grip. In a last ditch effort I reached up with my remaining hand, shoving my thumb in its eye it howled in pain, it fell on its back wailing. I hastily pulled myself up. I bolted past the creature not sure where I was going. I looked back and I saw it getting up but it didn’t pursue me, it stood on the edge of the pit, facing me it smiled and waved, then it fell in. The pit closed being replaced by dirt and grass. I collapsed, once again sobbing overwhelmed by emotion. I knew it would be back, I just knew.
