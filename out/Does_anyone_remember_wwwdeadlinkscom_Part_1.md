Back in the day, in my small town, there was a lot of talk and speculation about a website called deadlinks.com. The weird thing about this site was that you couldn’t access it directly.  Typing the URL into a browser wouldn’t lead you anywhere—no error message, no loading screen, just nothing. The only way in was through a dead link.

Some broken hyperlink buried in an old forum, a forgotten webpage, or an expired ad that shouldn’t have worked. Click the wrong thing at the wrong time, and suddenly, you’d find yourself there. The site itself was empty. Just a black background, with a blank text box, and a single question written beneath it:

“*What is your name?*”

When I was in middle school, kids speculated about what happened if you put your name in. Some said you’d be cursed and die in seven days. Others swore it was some kind of alien signal, or a government experiment watching you through the screen. All the “theories” were just bits and pieces stolen from horror movies. Other kids bragged about not being scared, claiming they’d do it. But the next day, they always had excuses. "My WiFi went out" or "my computer froze." Every time, something stopped them.

I don’t remember if anyone actually put their name in. But if they did, I never heard about it. Like many urban legends, the site faded into obscurity, slowly leaving people’s memories. A relic of an older internet—forgotten, lost, left to collect malware.

SleepyBoi420 (Derek): Hey, you guys remember that weird website kids would talk about back in middle school?

OopsAllParanoia (Me): That was like 10 years ago bro.

404HumorNotFound (Ryan): yeah there were hundreds of websites talked about back then 

SleepyBoi420: DEADLINKS GUYS!! Remember the one you had to be redirected to!

OopsAllParanoia: Ohhhh yeah, the one that asked your name right?

404HumorNotFound: what about it Derek?

SleepyBoi420: I got to the site!

404HumorNotFound: oh no

OopsAllParanoia: Ok… and?

SleepyBoi420: This is the url I used, [autoinsurancepolicies.com](http://autoinsurancepolicies.com), you guys pull up the site too

404HumorNotFound: are you drunk?

SleepyBoi420: What’s up Ryan? You scared? Awwww Cryan’s a wittle baby 

OopsAllParanoia: lmao

404HumorNotFound: shut up dude! we don’t know what’s up with this site. what if it’s some kind of weird scam site?

OopsAllParanoia: Bro it’s just some dumb site from when we were kids.

SleepyBoi420: 404BallsNotFound

404HumorNotFound: you’re a dumbass...

OopsAllParanoia: Just put your first name bro. How many Ryans are out there?

404HumorNotFound: i guess…

SleepyBoi420: Let’s goooooo! 

SleepyBoi420: Ok, let’s all hop on a call and do it at the same time

"Okay! You guys ready?!" Derek said with enough excitement for all of us. "I'm good to go," I said. "Let's just get this over with," Ryan mumbled. "On the count of three, we press enter," Derek instructed. Ryan let out a heavy, reluctant sigh but agreed.

"Three."

I sat at my computer, staring at the screen. Rereading "*What is your name?*" over and over.

"Two."

I quickly typed Mark into the text box.

"One."

I hit enter.

The box vanished. 

The words "*Thank you, Damon.*" took its place.

I sat there puzzled—

How did it know my real name?

"Yo, all I got was this stupid ‘*Thank you, Ryan*’ message. Was something supposed to happen, Derek?" Ryan asked, annoyed. "Ye-yeah, same here... ummmm, I don’t know..." Derek's voice wavered slightly. “You guys I need to let you know some—”

"Welp! I'm just gonna go watch some YouTube and go to bed. See ya!" Derek cut me off abruptly. 

A second later, he left the call.

“What were you saying Damon?” Ryan asked. “It… it’s nothing…” I decided not to tell him what happened. Ryan and I sat in silence for a moment. Neither of us wanted to admit that something felt off. "Soooo… I’m gonna go to bed too," Ryan finally said. I agreed. We both left the call. But as I stared at my screen, those words still lingered in my head.

“*Thank you, Damon.*”

At around 1:30 in the morning, I woke up to my phone exploding with messages from a frantic Derek.

SleepyBoi420: Guys!

SleepyBoi420: GUYS!!!

SleepyBoi420: Please this is serious!

SleepyBoi420: RYAN!!!

SleepyBoi420: DAMON!!!

SleepyBoi420: Respond!

SleepyBoi420: Respond!!

SleepyBoi420: RESPOND PLEASE!!!

OopsAllParanoia: Why are you going crazy bro? I was sleeping.

404HumorNotFound: same here, this better be good, Derek

SleepyBoi420: Ok ok, so I clicked my YouTube bookmark right, and the deadlinks website popped up with this message

“*A site so old, yet still alive. A single box, a single plea. Enter your name, a message waits. You close the tab, but it's too late. We know your name, Derek.*”

Honestly, I wouldn't have thought twice about it, but every other website I went to had the same message

OopsAllParanoia: Ok… sounds like just some dumb cryptic poem meant to scare you.

SleepyBoi420: Sure, but the thing is, I didn’t even put my name in

404HumorNotFound: YOU SON OF A BITCH!! This was your idea and you didn’t even put your name in?!

SleepyBoi420: I’m sorry!! 

SleepyBoi420: But I don’t know why you’re so mad. You don’t even believe it!

404HumorNotFound: I DON’T! But damn man, what if something did happen? You were just going to leave me and Damon hanging?

SleepyBoi420: I’m sorry man…

OopsAllParanoia: Look, why don’t we just calm down and sleep this off guys? Besides the weird message Derek got, nothing has harmed us. Let’s just call it a night.

404HumorNotFound: fine… goodnight Damon

OopsAllParanoia: Goodnight man

SleepyBoi420: Goodnight Ryan

. . .

SleepyBoi420: ...

OopsAllParanoia: Don’t worry about it D, I’m sure Ryan will be over it by tomorrow.

SleepyBoi420: Yeah, you’re right… Goodnight Damon

OopsAllParanoia: Goodnight bro.

I laid down to go to sleep, but the whole experience kept circling around in my head. There’s no way this stupid website could know who we are… right? "Whatever, I should just forget about this whole stupid night," I muttered, trying to reassure myself.

I woke up to my phone alarm blaring at 9 AM. I had forgotten to turn it off thanks to Derek’s shenanigans last night. Groggily, I peeled myself from the bed’s warm embrace, fighting against the invisible arms that tried to pull me back under. By sheer will, I forced myself up and trudged to the bathroom. A cold shower was my first line of defense against exhaustion, jolting me awake before I gradually turned up the heat. Steam filled the room, fogging up the mirror. After stepping out, I wiped it down to brush my teeth. 

That’s when I noticed something was off.

Every forward brushstroke I made was echoed in the mirror with a strange, unnatural delay. My reflection didn’t follow smoothly—it hesitated, lagging, like a fish caught on a taut line. “There’s no way a mirror can lag, right?” I muttered, staring at myself. 

Must be more tired than I thought.

Shaking it off, I decided to clear my head and put last night behind me by treating myself to my favorite coffee spot.

Standing in line, I lazily scanned the menu. This place, like many others, switched to displaying the menu on a TV screen. While I was looking for what sounded good to me, the items disappeared and the screen flashed the words:

"*Thank you, Damon.*"

I blinked and looked around. No one reacted. Customers shuffled forward, heads buried in their phones or in conversations. When I looked back, the menu was normal again. Lack of sleep. Had to be.

I shrugged it off, stepped up, and ordered my usual, giving my name as always. Then I waited. Five minutes. Ten. Names were called—people before and after me—yet mine never came. “Maybe they just missed me,” I thought, walking up to check. My order was there, but instead of Damon, the receipt read: David. I vaguely remembered hearing David get called a few minutes ago, but no one had claimed it. The items were exactly what I ordered, so… close enough I guess. Coffee shops screw up names all the time. 

Grabbing my food, I headed to the park, finding a quiet spot to enjoy my breakfast.

The scenery was gorgeous. California in December meant clear blue skies, lush green trees, and that perfect bite of cold where a hoodie was just enough. The park was unusually quiet for a Saturday. It was ten a.m., and the park was nearly empty—not that I minded. I saw that as a win. 

Just a handful of people loitered around. 

A mother sat on a bench by the playground, glued to her phone, a stroller parked beside her. For a moment, I felt the flicker of something crawl up from the back of my mind—old, heavy memories I’d spent years trying not to unpack. 

I thought of my own mother. The way she used to sit at the kitchen table, half-listening while scrolling through her old beat-up phone. But I shut it down before the thought could finish, like slamming a door on a room I never wanted to open. I darted my eyes around looking for anything to distract me when I noticed a little girl clambering around the jungle gym, though ‘playing’ felt like the wrong word—she moved like she was following a script only she could see. 

I heard the faint crunch of dried grass underfoot. Behind me, about sixty feet away, was a guy in a hoodie, pacing back and forth across the grass in unnaturally long strides. Not jogging. Not speed-walking. 

Just… striding. 

His movements were exaggerated, walking like he didn’t know how his legs worked. It looked insane, but hey, he wasn’t bothering anyone, so I mentally filed him under ‘park weirdo’ and moved on. I sat for about half an hour, enjoying my breakfast, when something started gnawing at me. A wrongness. 

Nobody had come or gone in the entire time I’d been sitting there. 

The striding weirdo never stopped. Never changed pace. The longer I watched him, the more I realized something was off. His hoodie sagged unnaturally low on his body, the sleeves dragging through the grass like limp, empty arms. His legs were freakishly long, yet somehow, he was short. The proportions were all wrong, like someone had cranked up the leg slider in a character creator but forgot to adjust the rest. With the oversized hoodie swallowing his torso.

He didn’t even look like a person—just a head bobbing atop a pair of legs. 

The little girl on the playground, every so often, she’d stop moving entirely, turning her head just to look at me. Just staring. I gave her a small wave, trying to play it off. She didn’t wave back. She didn’t even react. Just kept staring, like a little NPC waiting for me to press the right button. “Kids just do weird shit sometimes,” I told myself. But the words felt less like reassurance and more like a desperate plea to believe that this was still normal.

The mother never looked up from her phone.

Not once.

Not even to check on what I assumed was her kid. She sat too still—too rigid. Almost like a mannequin propped up on the bench. I glanced at the stroller beside her. No rustling. No shifting. Just stillness. Too still. I worked up the courage to approach the young mother. A prickling unease slithered up my spine. Something about this felt off. I swallowed hard and stepped closer. She didn’t react. Didn’t shift. Didn’t even acknowledge me at all. Her daughter still stood in the playground, utterly motionless. Eyes locked onto me, unblinking. “Hi…” My voice came out quieter than I intended. The mother didn’t move. “Um, I—" I stopped. Realizing she wasn't moving. Not blinking. Not twitching. She wasn't even breathing. My eyes drifted down to her hands. That’s when I noticed. The screen on her phone wasn’t even on.

The stroller jolted.

Something shot out. I barely had time to register it before it vanished into the brush. I turned back to the mother and—

She was gone.

The bench sat empty. I turned to the playground and the creepy little girl was gone too. The stroller sat there, perfectly still, as if no one had ever been there at all.

Trying to get away from the weird shit going on at that park, I decided to go to the mall. It’s the weekend. There had to be tons of people there. I drove to the mall. The roads were busy, cars passing like usual, but when I pulled into the parking lot, my stomach dropped.

It was completely empty.

Not just sparse—vacant.

I sat in my car, gripping the wheel, watching the road. Cars kept driving past, not a single one turning in. It was like the mall didn’t even exist to them. Then, finally, I saw a car pull in. I exhaled, relieved—until I noticed something wrong. As it pulled in, it disappeared, like it was sinking into an invisible void. The back bumper was the last thing to vanish, swallowed as if it had driven behind a mirror. I blinked and rubbed my eyes. The lot was still empty. I turned my attention to the mall entrance. Watching. Waiting. 

Five minutes. Nothing. Another five. No one walked in. No one walked out. Every instinct told me to leave. But I had to know. I got out of the car and walked up to the automatic doors. They slid open instantly and I was greeted with generic pop music. I stepped inside.

It was noon on a Saturday. Almost Christmas. This place should be packed. But it was completely empty. I wandered through the barren halls. Stores were open, fully stocked, yet there were no employees. No shoppers. The lights were on. Registers were running but, it looked as if everyone had just stepped away. “Am I being pranked or something?” I muttered under my breath. A thought crossed my mind—”if no one was here, what's stopping me from taking something?” 

I shut that thought down immediately.

Still, with no one around, I felt… wrong. Like I was trespassing somewhere I shouldn’t be. It took me entirely too long to realize that the music had changed.  The cookie cutter pop music was replaced with a droning piano melody—thin, stretched, and off-key. Like an old record player dying mid-spin. While I made my way through the empty lobby of the mall I heard something that made goosebumps erupt along my arms.

Footsteps.

Not the light tap of sneakers. Not dress shoes clicking against tile. It was bare feet slapping the floor. A guttural growl echoed from somewhere deep down the corridor. Low. Rumbling. I darted into the nearest open store, knocking over a display case in my rush. It hit the floor with a shattering crash. 

Shit. 

No time to worry about that. I needed to hide. I had bolted into a women’s clothing store so naturally I started towards the dressing room. "No—idiot, that's way too obvious," I thought, silently roasting myself. Then, my eyes landed on a pink door at the back of the store. 

An employee’s section.

I sprinted toward it and grabbed the handle. It turned. I threw myself inside into a long, dimly lit hallway that stretched endlessly in both directions. Behind me, I heard it—the crunch of glass. My stomach twisted.

It was inside the store. 

There was no time to make a choice. Instincts took over and I darted to the right. The hallway seemed endless and it felt like I had been running for the past ten minutes, my heart pounding. "This doesn’t make sense. The mall isn’t this big." I thought. Suddenly, I slid to a stop. A figure stood ahead of me. A dark silhouette with long black hair. It was standing still. Motionless. My chest seized with pure, cold terror. Behind it…

The pink door.

The same one I had used to enter the hallway. I had been running straight. But I ended up back where I started?? The figure stepped forward. I turned around but this time, I searched frantically for any door. Anything I might have missed. Between the sound of my own racing footsteps, I heard it. Slow. Heavy. Steps.

It was following me.

Not chasing. Just following. Like it thought there was no escape for me. My confusion deepened when I saw that the hallway now ended in a solid wall, with only a single door. I didn’t hesitate. The door shattered open under my weight, the world spinning around me as I stumbled forward—and into darkness.

The air was cold. Crisp. I was outside. But something was wrong. I had only been inside for an hour. Two at most. But the sky above me was a deep, suffocating black. It was night. I looked back and the door was gone. I couldn't wrap my head around what was going on. I just knew I needed to get the hell out of here right now.

I scanned the parking lot. My car was sitting just a few yards away. Untouched. Sitting right where I left it. I staggered toward it, exhausted, every inch of me screaming to just get inside and leave. I flew out of the parking lot. Driving well past the speed limit, replaying the bizarre events of the day over and over in my head. The lagging mirror while brushing my teeth. The striding weirdo, the silent little girl, the still woman and the empty mall. It all felt… wrong, like puzzle pieces that didn’t quite fit together. The streetlights cast long, unnatural shadows as I pulled out onto the road. It was just past eleven p.m. and the streets were just an endless stretch of asphalt swallowed by darkness. 

My hands gripped the steering wheel, the hum of the engine and the occasional flicker of passing streetlights were the only things keeping me company. I glanced in the rearview mirror to check if the mall was still behind me—and for just a split second, I saw something. A shape—small, barely noticeable—the very top of a head peeking up from the backseat.

I sucked in a breath, my pulse hammering against my ribs. My grip on the wheel tightened as I forced myself to keep my eyes on the road. I must have imagined it. A trick of the light, or maybe the exhaustion was starting to play with my head.

But I had seen something.

I stole another glance.

Nothing.

Another.

Still nothing.

I kept flicking my gaze between the road and the mirror, waiting for movement, waiting for something to change. With each glance, my nerves wound tighter and tighter, expecting—no, dreading—a face to rise up behind me. After glancing what felt like twenty times, relief. Nothing was there. I exhaled, letting out a breath I hadn’t realized I was holding. My muscles uncoiled slightly, my heartbeat slowing to a steadier rhythm. “See? Just my imagination.” I said to reassure myself.

The empty road stretched ahead, and as I reached for the turn signal, getting ready to merge right. I glanced at my side mirror and from the corner of my eye, something wasn’t right. It took a second for my brain to process it. The faint glint of pale skin. The curvature of fingers. Long, blood red fingers. Wrapped around the headrest of my passenger seat. My breath caught, my whole body going rigid. Slowly—so painfully slowly—I turned my head just a little more. Staring back just inches from me—

A face.

A hollow, sunken thing. Its eyes were wide, unblinking, black pits that seemed to swallow the light. Its skin was pulled too tight over its skull, stretched thin and sickly pale, the texture like something long dead. Its mouth was too wide, too sharp, curling into something that wasn’t quite a smile. I couldn’t scream. I couldn’t move. It just stared. And then—

It grinned.

I slammed the brakes so hard I almost spun out. I veered to the side of the road, heart pounding against my ribs. I threw the door open and scrambled out. I swallowed hard, gripping the edge of the car trying to catch my breath. My pulse throbbed in my ears. 

I looked back into my driver side window and it was gone. I peered through the backseat window—nothing. Just to be sure, I popped the trunk—empty. That thing—whatever it was, was gone. Maybe I was just on edge. Maybe my mind was playing tricks on me. I forced myself back into the driver’s seat, gripping the wheel tight. I looked back over my shoulders.

Nothing.

I needed to get home. Now. As I pulled back onto the road, I couldn’t shake the feeling that, somewhere in the darkness behind me, something was still there. Still watching. I drove home with my doors unlocked. I pulled into my driveway, heart pounding. As soon as I put the car in park, I yanked the keys out, threw the door open, and slammed it shut behind me. My hands fumbled to lock it—hopefully trapping whatever the hell might’ve been in there inside.

The night felt heavier now, the air thick. I turned toward my house. It was completely dark. Not a single light on. I opened the door. I needed light. Now. I flicked the switch by the door.

Nothing.

“Oh, fuck no!” I said out loud. The power company never sent out a blackout notice. This wasn’t normal. The breaker maybe? I turned on my phone’s flashlight and stepped back outside. My house was old, and for whatever reason, the breaker box was mounted on the side. As I walked past my car, I hesitated, glancing through the windshield. The backseat was empty. But that didn’t make me feel any better.

I forced myself to keep moving, pushing through the wooden gate that led to the narrow alley between my house and my neighbor’s towering brick fence. The darkness stretched forever, the alley feeling twice as long as I knew it was. Every tiny noise made me paranoid—rustling leaves, twigs snapping. It’s probably just a small animal. 

Yeah that’s it.

When I found the breaker. My heart sank to my knees. The door to the breaker was wide open and the switch had been flipped off.

Someone did this.

I slammed it back on and tore through the alley, through the gate, up the porch steps, and into my house, slamming the door shut behind me. I locked it, my breath ragged. The sound of a rapid, scratching patter flew across my kitchen floor behind me. My blood ran cold. It sounded like a dog—long nails clicking against the wood.

But I didn’t have a dog.

"…If it was a dog, wasn’t that better than the alternative?" I thought, trying to reassure myself. Swallowing hard, I forced my legs to move. Step by step, I crept toward the kitchen, my hand trembling as I reached for the switch.

The lights flickered on.

The room was empty. No dog. No person. Nothing. But somehow… somehow, it felt worse than before. I ignored the unease clawing at my gut and made my way upstairs, flicking on every light as I went. The brightness should have been comforting. It wasn’t. The shadows felt like they were watching.

I sat at my desk, flipped open my laptop, and signed in.

*discord ping*

SleepyBoi420: Hey Damon, have you heard from Ryan at all today?

OopsAllParanoia: Nah, he hasn’t hit me up yet. I take it you guys haven’t made up then?

SleepyBoi420: No… I sent him a bunch of messages apologizing, but he never replied. In fact, I don’t think he even got on today.

OopsAllParanoia: Well, let’s hop in a call. Maybe he’ll pick up.

SleepyBoi420: Sure…

The group call rang. 

Ryan’s profile was grayed out as Derek and I sat in silence, waiting. He didn’t answer. I went to message him when I saw him enter the call. I exhaled. “There he is.”

“Hey Ryan, where have you been, man?” Derek asked.

. . .

Derek hesitated. “Ry—” A sound cut him off. A deep, inhuman rasping breath. Static crackled through the speakers. "Wh… where…" The distortion twisted, wet and wrong. "Ha… have…" A thick, gurgling noise seeped through, like something too large, too heavy was shifting against the mic. "…y… you…" My throat tightened. “Ryan, what are you doing?”

“Yeah, that’s not fucking funny, bro!” Derek barked.

No response. Just guttural, sucking gasps, like something was trying to form words but didn’t have the right mouth for it. “Okay, Ryan, you can stop now…” I muttered. The static surged—then cut out.

Silence.

"Okay, Ryan, you can stop now." My own voice said back to us. It wasn’t an echo. It wasn’t a replay. It was off. Like something was trying on my voice like a new coat. A chill lanced through my spine. I saw Derek leave the call.  I tried to leave too but the button wouldn’t work. "How the hell did he leave?" I thought, my stomach knotting. My laptop screen flickered.  

Without any warning—my webcam switched on.

Cold panic gripped me. I didn’t think—I just slammed my laptop shut. My hands were shaking. "Okay, okay… the screen is shut. It should go to sleep in a few seconds." The speakers crackled.

My own voice spilled out into the room.

"Damon… where are you… Damon… where are you… Damon… where are you…" I yanked the charger from my laptop, flipped it over and took out the battery. The voice didn't stop. My heart pounded and as I turned to leave the room—

My phone rang.

The sound nearly made me jump out of my skin. My ringtone blasted at full volume. I fumbled for my phone. Derek. I answered immediately. “Dude, are you good? What’s going on?” My voice was frantic, breathless. Derek’s voice was quiet. Shaky. “Damon…”

He paused.

Then he said, barely above a whisper—“There’s something in my closet.” My blood ran cold. “What are you talking about?” I asked frantically. “Laughing… it’s laughing in my closet…” His voice wavered, as if he were on the verge of tears.

And then I heard it.

A low, wheezy chuckle filtered through the call. The sound was unnatural—wet and ragged, like a chain-smoker exhaling through shredded lungs. Derek’s voice broke through, barely holding steady. “Damon… what do I do?” His words were small, scared. I opened my mouth to answer, forcing down the rising panic. “You need to get ou—”

The call ended abruptly.

I tried calling him back—once, twice, five times. Voicemail, every time. My heart started pounding as my brain clawed through possible scenarios—maybe he dropped the phone running; maybe the thing had cornered him; maybe he was already...

That’s when I realized—

The voice from my laptop was growing louder. More distorted and warped. The speakers crackled like they were about to blow out—

The voice stopped.

After waiting a few minutes I slowly lifted my laptop screen. I was greeted by the same phrase I’ve seen since last night…

“*Thank you, Damon.*”

I barely had time to breathe before—the lights went out. I reached for my lamp. Nothing. "Oh no… please don’t be the breaker again. Not right now." I muttered. I stepped towards the door, fumbling in the darkness. My fingers brushed the handle. From the other side of the door I heard—

"Damon… I found you."

It was my voice, muffled behind the closed door. Every muscle in my body locked. The door creaked open. It stopped, just slightly ajar. Just enough for me to see a familiar face.

The face from my car. This time just a few short inches away.

Grinning. A too-wide, too-sharp, toothy grin.

And this time, it didn’t disappear.
