I do not usually post stuff like this, but I need to get it out of my head. I am sitting at my kitchen table with every light on and every curtain closed and I still feel like somebody is watching me from just outside the windows.

It started two weeks ago. I moved into a cheap, third floor walkup not far from downtown. The rent was low and the apartment fit my budget. The building is old, with thin walls and a stairwell that smells like cleaning product most of the time. I thought the noise would be the worst part, but the noise is what made me feel safe. The place where I used to live was silent in a way that made my imagination go wild. Here, the pipes groan, people shuffle home late, someone above me drums at four in the morning sometimes. The sounds used to feel like proof that other people are around.

The first night was normal. I unpacked the essentials, ate cereal out of a mug, and fell asleep with my fan on. Around midnight I woke up because I heard a key in my door. I sat up, heart thumping, reached for my phone and then realized my front door was locked. I live alone. I listened until the sound faded. Later I convinced myself I had imagined it, or that someone was outside fumbling with their own key in the hall.

The next morning I noticed small things. My balcony door, which I always lock, was unlocked a little. There were tiny imprints on the floorboards near the window like someone had stepped there in socks. I blamed the delivery guy. I work from home and I get packages, so I told myself a package person had left the door ajar and I forgot. I checked my security app. Nothing. No notifications, no motion alerts. I told my friend about it and she said I was being paranoid. She said to set up a camera if I was worried. I did not.

That night I started hearing footsteps in the hallway outside my apartment. Not the kind of footsteps that pass by, but the kind that pause near my door. They would come at odd hours, like one in the morning or three in the morning. Once I opened the door and there was no one in the hall. The building was quiet. My neighbor from 3A once yelled about leaving bags in the stairwell, but he would never stand outside my door at midnight.

One morning I found my living room window open just a crack. The latch was worn but I always close it. There were smudges on the windowsill, like long fingerprints. I wiped them with my sleeve and tried not to think about who could have reached in. My phone buzzed while I was at work. It was a photo from an unknown number. The picture was grainy and dark. It showed the corner of my couch and the tip of a sneaker. The message below said just this: “nice place.” I called the number. No answer. I went straight home.

I moved the couch, checked under it, checked the closets and the attic crawlspace above the ceiling. No one. I called the landlord and asked for a lock upgrade. He laughed and said people in the building never cared about locks. He said if someone was bothering me to call the cops. When I told him about the photo and the footprints he said maybe I was posting personal stuff online and someone recognized me. I do not post much. I do not have enemies, except maybe my ex, but he lives across the state and he does not know where I moved.

That night I put a chair up against the door and left my phone on record. At around three in the morning my phone picked up something. I listened back to the clip the next morning. At first it was just the building settling and distant traffic noise. Then, very faint, there was a scratching sound at the bottom of my door. It was slow and deliberate. Then there was a whisper so quiet I almost missed it. I played it a dozen times and I can still not be sure what the voice said. It might have been a name. It might have been nothing.

The worst thing happened yesterday. I was in the shower and I heard a muffled thump through the ceiling. I thought someone upstairs dropped something heavy. After my shower I walked into the kitchen and there was a small scrap of paper on the counter. It had been folded into a tiny square and placed exactly at the edge so I would find it. Inside was a sentence written in pencil: I like how you sleep.

My hands went numb. I called the police. They came, took the paper, looked around for signs of forced entry and dusted for prints. They found nothing and said that without more evidence there was not much they could do. They suggested a restraining order if I had a suspect. I do not have a suspect.

That evening I slept badly on the couch. Around two in the morning I woke up because my dog, who usually sleeps through anything, was whining at the window. I live on the third floor, and my dog does not usually go on the balcony. I stood up and then heard the sound again. It was not outside the window this time. It was in the air, as if someone had exhaled near me. A breath, close to my ear, not quite touching.

When I turned my head I saw something crouched in the reflection of the glass. Not a full person. Just a shadow with long arms folded like it was trying not to be seen. I blinked and it was gone. My dog ran to the door and started barking at nothing. I opened the door onto the balcony and there was nothing there but the night sky and the streetlights far below. No footprints, no ladder, no sign of anyone who could have reached this high.

I am writing this because I cannot keep sleeping. My friends tell me to move out. My landlord says nothing. The police said they would patrol the area more. I have been checking every lock and putting the deadbolt on twice. I have been sleeping with my phone in my hand and the screen light blazing. Each night the noises feel closer and the messages get a little bolder. I do not know what to do next except keep writing, because maybe stating it in words will make it less likely to happen. Maybe that is wishful thinking.

If anything happens to me, I want it to be known that I tried to tell someone. For now I am keeping the lights on and watching the window. The shadow likes to wait until I think everything is safe. It likes to breathe when I sleep. It tells me it likes the way I sleep. Tonight I will try not to.
