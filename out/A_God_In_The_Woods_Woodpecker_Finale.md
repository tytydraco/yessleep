When the other kid that went looking in the woods responded back to me, they wrote me a novel. Afraid I wasn’t going to believe them; they apparently chose to give me their entire story. I’ll spare you that entirety. The short version being; they found god too. And they had a wish fulfilled.

They wanted a younger sibling.

But they didn’t say more than that. So, I pressed them. Told them that I talked to Josh and I was wise to the fact of how these wishes got fulfilled. Apparently, you aren’t supposed to say how. It will ruin your life. And I guess Josh’s life isn’t that swell. He is a lonely man that was turned away by an old friend obsessing over kindergarten stories.

 

I didn’t tell them that. I told them that I just met up with Josh and was captivated by the praises he song to the being in the woods, which wasn’t a lie. And that we were all in this together as devoted believers, which was. After a little more pressure and reassurance that everything would be perfectly fine, and they told me how their wish was fulfilled…

And how do you get a younger sibling? 

To make their wish come true, they would have to sneak into the bathroom at night, take the little pills in moms medicine cabinet with the numbers and arrows on the foil. Then go to the kitchen and put the whole package unopened into a boiling pot on the stove, for at least 2 minutes. Then take out the package and put them back.

I mean what the actual fuck?!

Obviously knowing what those pills would be and that they wouldn’t work after being heated. A child for sure doesn’t know that. I wouldn’t think of that for christ sake. 

Maybe I’m gullible, but I am starting to question more than just my judgment here. Maybe not quite questioning if something spoke to these kids, but if getting lost in those woods really was enough to make at least two different people think so? And if so, how would that explain how they were able to figure these devious schemes out by their age?

 

My desire to get to the bottom of this was successfully reinvigorated.

 

And as I see it, that work starts and ends with confirming to myself that nothing is in those woods. I am going to look for the “god” in the woods. Following that old story to the letter. And if by some off chance, I should happen to find god, I have some very poignant questions coming his way.

 

I can let my son be alone the rest of the evening, right? He is eight, he will be thrilled that he gets a night to himself.

Of cause he’s thrilled. I’ve laid down the law, he knows that if I get home and he isn’t in bed. He is barred from sweets for the next week. I’ve neatly organized the leftovers in the fridge, and told him he can make some sandwiches with the stuff on the second shelf if he gets through all the leftovers and is somehow still hungry.

If anything, this will at least be one good thing to come from this obsession of mine. Finally letting my son take that extra step in growing up.

I didn’t tell him I’m going to the woods though. Didn't want to spark his curiosity in the story and go out there himself. No, I told him that I was going out into the city, letting him know I wasn’t going to take the car so not to be alarmed that it’s still there. I’m thinking that he might get it in subconsciously that it’s not okay to go out party and drive home. Maybe that works I guess I’ll know in a couple years, when he starts going out.

I must admit letting him stay home for the first time I got a little sentimental, thinking about him growing up as fast as he is. And how in just a couple of years he would be falling in love for the first time, going through puberty, high school. You know growing up. I must admit it made me a little teary-eyed thinking of how fast he turned eight. And how soon all those monumental things would happen to him.

So, tearing up I demanded a hug before I left. Hoping he wouldn’t grow out of giving me those long loving hugs, although I know that wouldn’t be the case. Very soon he’ll be wincing and wriggling out of my grasp, just like we all started doing to our parents.

 

Going out the door flashlight in the pocket of my warmest coat, eying down the trees at the far end of the street, I feel like I’m proving something to our household. Both of us can stand on our own.

 

Okay I’m at the treeline. Honestly I’m getting goosebumps. Struggling nervously with the flashlight, I think about how childhood me would feel seeing me now. I think the version of me that heard this story from those older kids, would feel pride. Knowing I’d grow up to be brave enough to do this.

I am going to try and get lost in there as fast as possible so the way out, after I turn on my gps, will be as short as possible. I’m doing this properly but not religiously. I don’t think a god cares how you get to a spot you haven’t been before. That must be true.

 

Okay I can’t see the road anymore. No god in sight yet. I’m going off the path. The flashlight is really coming in handy.

 

It turns out to be a lot harder than expected to go of the path this early on, especially in the dark winter months. This near to the entrance the forest floor is covered in small bushes and snags. And I keep getting my feet stuck to them when I’m walking. I’m pointing the flashlight ahead of me so when I shift my weight and drag my back foot forward, the shrubbery acts like tripwire catching the toe box of my boots. I’ll have to go back to the trail and try to go further into the forest. So I can find an area where I can get lost a bit more easily.

 

I can’t find the path. I’m honestly panicking. But as I keep saying aloud to myself “this was the whole point”. So I’m telling myself to spend at least 30 minutes lost but seeking the supreme being. To follow along with the story, and to be sure with myself that, In case I don’t find anything, I’ll be in the same state of mind as the others were. For if it is all child psychosis, I want to be sure I know what it feels like to be stuck in here.

 

A couple minutes past in search, honestly I’ve just started to actually want to find this thing. Up until now I’ve just been thinking about how best to move my feet, and the fact that I am actually doing this crazy shit.

 

Time passes way faster when I’m actually searching. Checked the time, it’s been at least 15 minutes. Rushing forward heedlessly into untreaded territory, just trying to find where this thing hides in here. I have become convinced that something weird is up. Being lost for this long, walking at the pace I am, this close to the treeline. I should have found a path by now. Or have gotten out of the forest.

 

I’ve spotted something that’s noteworthy. There’s an odd tree. It’s old. Super old. Im no expert in trees but the way the limbs of it spiral around. It almost looks they haven’t been bent by following the path of the sun in the sky. But rather the passing of the seasons. Like this tree is reacting to the environment on a different timescale than everything else here. That tree is it. I am here, I’m sure. Absolutely sure. If someone told me, this isn’t it; I would be able to tell them for a fact that they are wrong. Nothing else around me looks different, everything here is different. In the same way falling in love changes everything around you. In that exact same way, I know this is the one.

 

Walking up to the tree I feel like the world becomes slowly more distant. I feel compelled to touch it. And as I do, something violently forces itself into me. Into my memory. Into my being. I Retract my hand, like I was burned. But my mind doesn’t feel the same. I’m flipping through old memory’s unwillingly, it’s like something is in here with me. Going through who I am, what I have done. What experiences made me who I am.

 

And then, slowly it starts speaking to me. Or rather it communicates at me. Forcefully. God’s voice is something you can't ignore. I’m not sure what are my thoughts and what are it’s words. It’s Pictures, my pictures. It’s Ideas, my ideas. It’s concepts and ideals, my concepts and ideals. It’s Feelings, our feelings. Our Pictures. Our ideas. Concepts. Ideals. I don’t believe in spirits. I believe in souls. Souls are made by god. I believe in god. Do I believe this is god?  This could be a god. These are godly powers. I believe this is a God. There is only one god. This is God. 

 

The presence of God is intrusively overpowering. The presence of God is unholy. I know why every religion speaks of Gods love. Love is both utterly impure and pure at once, this is the same. Repulsive, yet captivating. No not repulsive. Exiting. Yes, it’s excitement, I mistake for repulsion. That’s God’s honest truth.

 

God’s showing me the future. God revealing his plan, beauty manifest. This vision must come true. But it is fragile. It requires me. I will serve this greater purpose. I will honor God’s command.

 

I can see so clearly what I must do to save God's vision, to save my son. I believe and I repent. God’s voice booms in my head. Beckoning me to do what’s right. I know it must be done, God has shown me so. I fill with purpose and love. I know how to fulfil my repentance. Eternal bliss, my son’s eternal happiness. It will follow. As surely as dawn after night.

I step right up next to the patch of peeled bark on the tree. I can see the sturdy hard wood transporting the nutrients of the earth, channeling them into the air for all of us to inhale. I feel fearless.

I lean back my head, and spring my cranium forward into the solid vessel. My skin acting as an elastic dampener on the collision between the two solid objects, giving of a muted thump. I stumble. I feel a soothing warmth spread through my body. Regaining my balance, I see visions of the future God has promised. Reinvigorated I ready myself for a second blow, a second chance at redemption. I lean back, and with a power I have never before mustered, my mass lunges forward. A soft thump, and a squelching. I pull back slowly; the adhesive soft tissue being pulled from the oak, where it and I collided. I feel warmer still, the vision becomes clearer, happiness flows through me. I stretch out my arms, and grab gods vessel. Once more I lean back my head, my arms help my soul seek completion, my entire body moving with one conviction. A harder thump, my forehead becomes divided, the sounds of the forest seize. Only my heart is audible. Leaning back parts of me now lingers in the timber. Heavenly bliss assaults my wavering mind. I will bring God's plan to fruition. And as a last fleeting thought I say onto God.

“Take control”

And give in.
