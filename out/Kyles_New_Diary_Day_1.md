My name is Kyle. I’ve always been interested in those urban exploration videos where people get chased out or hear creepy shit, never thought I’d be living it though. My friend Harry and I have always wanted to go to places like in those videos to just look around and mess around I guess. Problem is, we live in a small town with barely anything to do or look at, so we were very limited on places to go to, other than the odd drug house and out of business store. 

One day, me and Harry had decided to do an all nighter trip to an asylum about 2 hours from our town, our plan was to sneak out of my parents house at around 11pm, then get the bus to a stop about a half hour walk from the asylum. It’s also worth mentioning this asylum was looked online by Harry, not me, I had never seen or heard of this place in my entire life. 

11pm comes, me and Harry climb out my window and get on the bus, once we had got to the nearest stop to the asylum it was around 12:30-1am. We walked the rest of the way, mainly just talking about random things to pass the time. When we got to this asylum I was tired, like really goddamn tired, i struggle with sleep a lot due to constant nightmares so I was basically about to go into the most creepiest place I’ve ever seen while on 3 hours of sleep. I’ll admit, I was scared, Harry being the great friend he is said, “Stop being a bitch and follow me inside, Kyle”. I followed him across the small, overgrown pathway, leading up to the entrance of the asylum, I was surprised to see it wasn’t a broken or boarded up door, it was actually in good condition considering how overgrown the surrounding area is. 

Harry was the first to walk in, he tried to act brave but I could tell he was just as scared as me, in his defence though, this place looked like a scene out of the outlast game once we got inside. Luckily we had come prepared with flashlights, water and I even brought a switchblade just in case, so we knew even if shit did go wrong then we’d at least survive an extra 5 minutes if we don’t slip on a rock or something. First few minutes were fairly boring, just walking around and making small comments on the odd graffiti and rot on the walls. 

Then we come up to a room with a number and name…”Room 13. Mariah Cr-“ the last part of the name was label was covered in red paint (I hope). We walked into the room, Henry was looking on one side while I looked on the other where the bathroom was. The room seemed fairly normal, a bed, table, chair. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Now I’m sure people can relate to moments like this but I couldn’t help but feel like I had been or seen the room before, like I had stood in the exact same spot I was in, looking in dirty, cracked mirror in front of me. I shrugged the thought off and went back to Henry, in the sleeping area part of the room, I noticed him staring into a corner of the room, I looked at him curiously and asked “Dude, what are you looking at?”, He just stared for a moment before saying “I thought I heard something…like a whisper”. I assumed he was fucking with me, trying to make me scared so I just said “yeah very funny. Let’s go, this room is boring”.

Skip forward a few minutes later and this is when things got weird. Really. Fucking. Weird. We had just walked out of what I assume was an office since there was filing cabinets and folders scattered around with a desk and chair. Now we were in the room next to it, this seemed like just another ordinary room for a patient, only this one had a broken window and writing all over the walls, we didn’t get much change to read the writing since we heard the sound of a something opening, like a drawer, followed by the sound of a loud drop, as if someone had just dropped a book on the floor. Me and Harry looked at each other, wide eyed and silent. I was the first to speak up, “Harry, what the fuck was that?” I said quietly. Harry replied in the same tone “I don’t know…should we go look?”. I was hesitant but realised we would have to go that way to leave anyway, so I pulled out my knife and slowly walked into the hallway, we looked both ways down the hallway and then made our way to the closest room to us, the office room.  Once inside we saw an open filing cabinet drawer and a folder with some papers on the floor. The folder on the floor had a name on it, I picked it up, shined my light onto it and read the name…”Mariah Cray-13”. After recognising the name from earlier I opened it and started to read while Harry would look around, scared shitless. It was mostly random details about the patient, age, date of birth, place of birth, etc. then I saw a page titled “reason for transfer”, in short…I found out this woman was sent to this asylum for murdering her husband, son and her own parents too. Apparently she had a court case and was sent to this asylum instead of prison.

After about a minute of reading I started to realise this also seemed familiar, word for word, letter for letter, I could swear I had read it before. Then I remembered something…tears filled my eyes as the thought hit, not sad or happy tears but tears of absolute fear. I had goosebumps on every part of my body. I knew this place yet I had never seen it, I had been here when I slept. Room 13, Mariah crays file, I could remember every fucking part of it. I quickly turned to Harry and said in an urgent tone “Harry we need to get the fuck out of here, NOW!”, he looked like he was about to question me but was cut off when we heard a high pitch, bloodcurdling scream from the hallway. Me and Harry booked it for the stairs, not even bothering to speak or look for the sound. Then I heard footsteps, fast and echoing footsteps that practically sent somehow even more fear through me like water through a straw. Harry slipped, but I went back for him…I grabbed him by his backpack and ran out with him. 

After what felt like ages, me and Harry made it outside, we took a minute to catch our breath. Harry looked at me and said “what the fuck was that shit?! How did you know to get out?”. I just looked at him for a moment before saying “i saw the place in my nightmares…I knew something was gonna happen if we didn’t leave”. It sounds cliche but it’s true. Harry knew when to trust me, he knew I had good instincts with shit like this so he just took my word for it. After another moment of heavy breathing, Harry said “So…what happened at the end of the nightmare?”. I thought for a long moment, just trying to remember, but I couldn’t. After that fucked yo experience we started walking back to the bus stop, once we got there we realised we still had a while to wait for the bus to arrive. I decided in the meantime I’d write in my Diary about what had just happened so…well I’m doing it now so yeah. Also Harry searched up Mariah cray, turns out she had a son while at the asylum but was deemed “not fit” to be a parent, she ended up killing a lot of guards and staff to get her baby. Honestly respect to the woman for the dedication, nobody knows where she is now or if she’s alive, nobody knows about the baby either. 

I was about to put my diary away when I remembered the rest of my nightmare. I was away from the asylum, and, I’ll try remember better but I think I was bleeding out from a stab wound. I got away from that creepy bitch at the asylum but I still died? I don’t get it, I can’t remember, I just remember dying. Don’t know who did it though so now I’m conf-

Harry’s Diary. Day 22
I did it. I did what she wanted. I killed Kyle so she could want me again. I hope she will be proud when I show her his eyes, his lifeless but glowing eyes. Can’t wait to show mother
