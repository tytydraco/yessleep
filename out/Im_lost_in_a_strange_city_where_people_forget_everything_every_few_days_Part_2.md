I’ll be writing this post throughout the day as I go about my business, trying to document everything that has happened for all of you to keep up with, and to make it easier on me than having to sit down to write one long post at the end of the day. I’ll place timestamps above each portion I’ve written, so you know about when I wrote them.

**(5:19 AM - 6:53 AM)**

I just woke up a few minutes ago from a very forceful sleep.

As predicted, the ‘reset’ I’ve sadly started to become so used to took hold last night. Surprisingly, I had about an hour’s reprieve after sending out the message before I was dragged unconscious by whatever unknowable forces control this world I’m now stuck living in, and for a moment there, I started to think there was a chance we could have gotten away with another day, but no…it was lights out as usual.

The very first thing I did after I woke up was read all of your responses. I really didn’t expect to find so many, but I’m very grateful that I have them. I knew I could count on all of you, and you did all have some great suggestions. Some of you asked me to try to reach out to my family on here, and as soon as I’m done typing this portion of my post out, that’s exactly what I plan to do; I’m going to see if I can send a message out to my father‘s email address, to tell him I’m alive, and ask him what happened to me from his perspective. It could go a long way in figuring things out. Maybe I’ll draft one up for my Uncle, too, just in case he was there at the time when I ended up here.

I really do hope they answer, not just because it would help me, but because I have some regrets about the day that I disappeared. Father and I had a fight over some things early that morning, and I never got to apologize for it… I want to do that now.

Another thing one of you mentioned was the possibility of being in a time loop in an alternate universe. You could be right about that; I’ve definitely considered both of those things In the midst of all of this, and right now, an alternate universe is about the only theory that makes logical sense, so it’s what I’m going with until further notice.

The only thing that gives me pause about the idea of a time loop is that…well, there’s one strange oddity that I’m not sure would make sense for it, but I’ll let you all tell me what you think on that. The oddity I’ve noticed is that the dates seem to change, people acknowledge what day it is and the passage of time, just like everything‘s normal, and objects stay where they were at the time they were dropped or left behind, even after a reset. The only thing they forget is…everything else. Conversations had, notably unique or major events that happened (for example, if someone openly broke a vase in the theatre where I work and got in trouble for it, but it wasn’t cleaned up before the next reset, my coworkers or boss might see it broken, but no one would remember who caused the vase to break) and everything that isn’t just the mundane routine of every day life and the general passage of time is forgotten.

Oh, and I’ve gotten fairly good at predicting when the ‘resets’ will happen by now, for those who might be interested in details about the resets in general: It’s not an infallible science by any means, but 3-4 days does seem to be the average, with the rare exceptions of the rare 5th day reset, which so far has happened only once. If it’s a suspected reset day, and you make it past 2AM with no reset, that seems to mean it won’t happen until sometime after 5-6PM the next day (the starting time for a possible reset on every day, except for Saturdays and Sundays, which seem to be wildcards if they’re reset days, and have no reliable start times or reset curfews). Unless my counting skills are failing me, as of today, I’ve been through a total of 6 resets, in the span of 26 days. Three have happened after 3 days, three have happened after 4, and one happened after 5.

Today is day 27. Sometimes, it’s hard to believe I’ve been here almost a month, but at least I finally feel like I’m starting to make significant progress in my plans to get back to where I belong. I’ll be heading to the city‘s archive today after work, as one of the other commenters here suggested. I’m hoping I can find something there.

**(7:15 AM - 7:16 AM)**

I’ve sent out an email to my father. Unfortunately, when I tried to log in to my own ordinary email, it told me I was logging in from a different device, so I needed to use my phone to verify that it’s me. I…don’t have my phone, obviously, so I had to make and use a throwaway email instead. I really hope it doesn’t get caught in his spam inbox, because if it does, he may never notice that it exists…

**(1:08 PM - 1:36 PM)**

I’m at work currently, so I can’t linger here long, just stopping for a brief moment to update this post as best I can while there’s enough of a lull in tasks for me to easily get away with it.

I stopped by the city hall earlier to request permission to view the city archives. They didn’t seem to balk at it, and told me I could view them tomorrow morning. Normally, I’d have scheduled this sort of thing for the afternoon on my day off, but in this world, I don’t really have that kind of luxury, do I? I have to take what I can get, as soon as I can get it. If an appointment is scheduled after a reset, then no one is likely to remember I was given permission at all, and I can’t take that risk. Thankfully, the reset happened just last night. Tomorrow should be clear. I can do it before work starts.

I’ve read a new comment on my last post, saying I should tread carefully in this situation, because if it was a genuine time loop, people wouldn’t be passing out like that. Honestly, I agree. Like I said, there are just some things that don’t fit with the time loop theory, as much as I’ve considered it being the case. Time progressing and objects staying where they were left is one of the biggest things. I just can’t get past that. If time was rewinding, wouldn’t everything be back in place exactly how it was when all of this started? Wouldn’t it be the same starting day on all the calendars, and wouldn’t everyone think that? You guys are right. I’m going to practice caution.

That and…well, I can’t stop thinking about that one commenter who said they were from this city and tried to convince me that Reddit didn’t exist, even as I was reading it right here on the site. I tried to tell myself it was just a troll messing with my head, but what if it wasn’t? What if I’m not the only one who has access to here, and what if someone is actively trying to stop me? The approach could use some work, but still…it’s disturbing. It’s probably nothing, though. It‘s probably just a troll, right? I’m just overthinking things. I’m scared and I’m paranoid. I need to go calm down.

I wish I had someone to ask to come with me to the archives, but it’s not as if I can just ask anyone. I’ll just have to do my best to play it casual and not arouse any suspicion. I’m just interested in the history of this town. That’s all.

**(6:17 PM - 6:23 PM)**

I’m heading back from work. I‘m not sure if it matters at all, but I guess it’s a good time to mention that there’s a rule here: don’t stay in the shops after dark if you don’t live there. There are actually a surprising number of people who do have living quarters in the back of their shops here, so I don’t know if it’s just some matter of wanting to unwind without anyone to bother you after work hours are over, or what. It’s just always something that’s struck me as odd. Every business closes after 6:00 PM, which is when things seem to get dark around here.

**(3:56 AM - 5:37 AM)**

In case it needed saying, I’m back at the hotel. I’ve made dinner, I’ve tried to relax, unwind, get ready for bed, but I just can’t shake this unsettling feeling that I’m completely isolated from everyone I used to know.

I’ve checked my emails again. I’ve been checking them on and off all day, hoping I could wait to update you all one more time after I’ve heard back from him, but there are no responses yet. I guess if my father is still stressed over my sudden disappearance, checking his emails probably won’t be his first priority, but he has to be checking then at least sometimes, right? I wonder if there’s anyone out there searching for me. I wonder if he was even there to see me disappear when I did. I wonder what he’s thinking…

I guess there’s no point in dwelling on it right now. All I can do is wait. But that’s so much easier said than done. For now, I guess I’ll try to focus on something else.

Talking earlier about the strange rules of the place where I work reminded me that I still need to tell you all about how I got this device, so, I guess I’ll do that. I think I said in my previous post that I had to work for two weeks to be able to afford to travel, because travel is pretty expensive around here, and that’s true; they charge you exorbitant prices here because they know that you don’t have a choice. Oh, sure, there’s a shop that sells camping supplies for the patently insane, but they’ll also remind you that if you leave the town after dark without taking a carriage, it’s exceedingly unlikely that anyone will ever see you again. If you want to go anywhere after dark, or anywhere that will take longer than there are daylight hours to arrive and return, then you have to take a carriage, and when it gets dark, you have to draw the curtains on the cabin until you see daylight shining through all of them.

Now, that could be drama, of course; they could just be trying to keep people from seeing some hidden truth. Maybe a wiser man would grab a weapon and supplies and trudge his way through the great expanses of nature with a brave heart, but I’m sorry to tell you, I’m not that sort of man. Everything they say could be a lie made up to control others, but personally, I’d rather be wrong and a little bit controlled than wrong and dead, or wrong and on yet another missing persons list.

So I saved up money, and I took a carriage out northeast, to the house where I was told my family of this world used to live — where *I* used to live. I didn’t go there looking for a device like this. Really, I was starting to think something like that just couldn't exist here. Sometimes, I was beginning to wonder if it even did anywhere, or if I was just…losing my mind. I guess I thought if I visited the place where my family and I were supposed to have lived here, maybe my memory would finally come back, and I’d realize this was my reality after all. That I’d just imagined everything else.

Honestly, I think cabin is a better word for the place I ended up at. The carriage wouldn’t even take me all the way to the house; apparently, they have some sort of policy against driving into the woods, even though there’s a wide enough dirt path for them to have done it. Instead, I had to get out and hike all the way through the forest on foot until I found it.

For those curious what it looks like, just imagine a dark wood three bedroom cabin, two floors and a basement, with a significantly lighter color porch and other accents, and whatever picturesque, Thomas Kinkade-reminiscent scene you’ve put in your mind is probably close enough, if it weren’t for the utter lack of any warmth or light present in the building, or the musty smell of stale air that I was greeted with the moment I opened the door and stepped inside — a door that, judging by the powdery layers of dust that covered every surface in the interior, probably hadn’t been breached even just to allow the place to air out in some time.

I’ve heard people say that liminal spaces like that make us feel uneasy because it’s something taken out of its normal, natural context — seeing something we expect to usually be filled with people and brimming with life and sound is unnerving when it isn’t because it alerts our inner instincts that something is wrong, that this place must have been abandoned for a reason, but that wasn’t how I felt standing inside the cabin that day. It wasn’t unnerving to see because it was a place that should have been full of life now turned empty and silent — it was unnerving to see because *it shouldn’t have existed at all*.

Walking around in a building that was supposed to have been where I grew up, when I *knew* it wasn’t; *that* was terrifying. Visiting a room that must have been mine, seeing old toys that I never remembered playing with collecting dust on the floor like they’d just been sitting right where a nonexistent version of me once left them, looking upon a painting on the wall in the dining room and seeing my younger face staring back at me in a place where it absolutely shouldn’t have been, lovingly surrounded by and happily posing with people that I don’t even recognize — people who *must* be my parents, but most certainly *aren’t* — unnerved me to my core.

Here I had been telling myself all of that time that none of this was real and that I belonged with all of you, in my real world, but yet there I was, facing down what felt like the most undeniable of all proofs that I was wrong.

I think if I hadn’t found the hatch leading down into the basement hidden underneath "my" bed when I went to take a closer look around my room, I really might have just accepted that there was something wrong with my head and given up on ever getting out of here. It was down in that basement that I found this device. Sitting under a single hanging, flickering fluorescent yellow light — a light that shouldn’t even exist in this time period — in a basement that looked so unsettlingly modern by comparison to everything else, was an old wooden table with a latched metal box that contained nothing but this one device: a small, flat tablet-like screen about 20.32 centimeters/8 inches high and roughly the same long, with a little pen clipped on the side. It took me a long while to even get it working, and even longer to figure out how to navigate and get onto the internet, but I did manage. And as soon as I realized what it could do, I knew I had to get back to the city and my hotel room as fast as I could, so I wouldn’t lose it during a reset. This device was and still is my only hope of making it through this. I have to keep protecting it at all costs.

And well, you mostly know the rest. I need to try to sleep now, so I’ll be signing off for now. I hope all of this made coherent sense, but I really can’t stay up to proofread it right now. As it is, I’ll only have a few hours before I need to get up and go to see the city archives. I’ll update you again as soon as I can. Wish me luck, everyone. I’m hoping I won’t need it.
