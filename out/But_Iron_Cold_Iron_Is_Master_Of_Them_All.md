“Samantha?” I heard Rosalyn ask hopefully as she picked up the phone.

I was calling her because she had recently come across an anomalous VHS tape of a man burying a premonition he had written down in my cemetery, convinced that it would one day be of great value to me. She had showed it to me, and I had of course agreed to see if I could find it.

“Hi, Rose. Yeah, it’s me,” I replied, unable to hide my disappointment. “I dug around in the area where the guy buried his time capsule, and I couldn’t find anything. Whoever picked up and turned off the camera at the end of the video must have taken the time capsule too.”

“Yeah, I figured that, but it was worth a shot. Thanks for checking anyway,” Rosalyn said consolingly. “The video looked like it was taken during the late autumn, and if the will-o-the-wisps were there, that means it had to have been on Halloween, right?”

“Yep, and the only reason anyone would be in my cemetery on Halloween would be a descendant of Artaxerxes Crow looking to honour their pact with Persephone,” I replied. “If we assume the video was taken during the nineties, the most likely candidate would be Erasmus Crow, Elam’s grandfather. Elam doesn’t know anything about any prophecy that was recovered the night Erasmus sacrificed himself, but he does remember that his father Ephraim went to the cemetery after midnight that Halloween, so it’s completely possible that Erasmus left a message for him about the time capsule before the wisps got him. For all we know, Ephraim destroyed whatever was in the time capsule as soon as he dug it up, but if he did keep it… Seneca would have it now.”

“You’re sure?” she asked.

“Mmhmm. Since Elam had been cut out of his father’s will, Seneca was able to use his position as his business partner to claim most of his assets,” I explained. “If Seneca had read the premonition that had been meant for me, that might explain why he was so keen to get me into the Ophion Occult Order. Artaxerxes wrote in his journal that he thought one of his descendants would enact some vaguely defined iconoclasm when the stars aligned. Elam’s convinced that would have been his daughter if she had survived and that I’ve effectively taken up her mantle in assuming responsibility for the cemetery. If Seneca does have the time capsule, Emrys or even Ivy can just order him to hand it over, right? Can you see if she’ll do that?”

“Oh. Ah, well, actually…” Rosalyn stammered awkwardly.

“She’s listening right now, isn’t she?” I asked flatly.

“Sorry, Samantha,” she apologized sheepishly.

“That’s alright. I understand,” I sighed. “Ah, Ms. Noir? I’m assuming you saw the video too and authorized Rose to show it to me. I think you’ll agree that it’s imperative that I know what was in that time capsule. I’m not even asking for it back. I just want to look at it. Is that something that can be arranged?”

The line was completely silent for a long moment; long enough that I wondered if the call had been anticlimactically dropped mid-conversation.

“I’ll arrange it,” a posh British accent finally replied in an assertive tone. “I’ll send Ms. Romero around to your place of employment tomorrow afternoon to pick you up. You may bring your girlfriend and your familiar along if you wish.”

Before I could object or even ask any follow-up questions, there was a sharp click and the line went dead.

\*\*\*

Rosalyn hadn’t even had a chance to knock on the front door of *Eve’s Eden of Esoterica* before Genevieve pulled it open and positioned herself protectively between her and me, folding her arms and glaring down at her with an intimidating gaze.

“Oh. Hi Eve,” Rose said, adopting a contrite stance as she clutched her hands in front of her.

“Where are you taking us?” Genevieve demanded.

“Evie, sweetie, relax. We have a pact with Emrys, and the *Ooo* reports to him now. They couldn’t hurt us if they wanted to,” I reminded her gently, placing my hand on her shoulder and trying to pull her back a bit.

“That didn’t stop Seneca from inviting us to a play where he summoned yet another banished god into our realm,” she countered before sharply turning back to face Rosalyn. “Answer the question.”

“…The Crows’ Old estate, a short drive outside of town,” she responded. “Seneca says Artaxerxes left an old spellwork vault behind, one he’s made no progress in opening. He can’t make any promises, but if what you’re looking for is anywhere, it’s in there.”

Genevieve and I both immediately looked behind me and to our right, where my spirit familiar had manifested at the mention of his old home.

“Elam’s here, I take it?” Rose asked as she peered fruitlessly in the direction we were looking.

“He is. If he says anything he wants you to know, I’ll tell you,” I replied.

“I know what she’s talking about, and I can’t open it. My father never gave me the combination,” Elam said.

“He says he doesn’t know how to open the vault,” I repeated.

“Seneca says that the mere presence of a Crow, living or dead, should be enough to let him crack the vault open. It’s sort of a two-factor authorization thing,” Rosalyn explained.

“So Seneca will be there, then?” Genevieve asked in disdain.

“He will, yes. The deal is that if you help him get it open, you can claim the documents that were specifically addressed to you, but everything else is still part of the Crow estate and legally his,” Rosalyn said.

Genevieve groaned at the horrible offer, and I turned to give Elam a sympathetic glance.

“Are you okay with that?” I asked.

“Helping Chamberlin claim the last final scraps of what was rightfully mine? Sure, why not?” he sighed as he hung his head and pinched the bridge of his nose. “Someone gave their life to try to get that message to you. We need to see it.”

“Elam’s on board,” I told Rosalyn.

“So you’ll do it?” she asked hopefully.

“We’ll do it. Lottie promised she’d watched the shop for us and fill in for me at yoga,” Genevieve relented.

“Oh thank you, thank you, thank you,” Rose said with relief. “You two don’t know how important this is. Ivy doesn’t think it was random luck that I picked that tape from Orville’s box. I had another encounter with the Effulgent One back in May and if I understood him correctly, he thinks the conflict between Emrys and the Darlings is spiralling into some kind of clash of the Titans. Ivy thinks my connection to him has given me a subconscious insight into this, and whatever was in that time capsule could be vital.”

“So long as what we’re doing helps keep the peace, we’re willing to help,” I nodded.

“Awesome, thank you! I parked just down the street a little bit,” she said as she gestured in the vague direction of her electric crossover. “Did you want to sit in the front with me or in the back with your girlfriend?”

“Ex-girlfriend,” Genevieve corrected her in a matter-of-fact tone.

“Wait, what?” she asked, looking at me wide-eyed with a mix of shock and pity.

I didn’t have the heart to torment her like that, so with an awkward smile, I simply held up my left hand, showing her the rose gold ring with wrought maple leaves encircling a morganite centerpiece on my ring finger.

“Oh my god, don’t do that!” she shouted with relief as she threw her arms around me. “Congratulations! When did you two get married?”

“Last Midsummer’s Eve. We were handfasted in a small civil ceremony; we basically eloped,” I explained. “Neither of us proposed, at least not formally, if you were wondering. We just decided that after five years together we were both pretty confident that our relationship was permanent and that it would be best to make it official.”

“But why didn’t you have a real wedding though? I love weddings!” she asked.

“Samantha wouldn’t have been comfortable being the center of attention like that, and traditional weddings are really just a form of conspicuous consumption, which I’m not comfortable with,” Genevieve replied, holding up a ring of white gold with beech leaves around a green beryl gemstone; the spring to my autumn. “And I’ve read that having big, overhyped wedding ceremonies isn’t great for relationships either. It’s important to manage expectations, and a big wedding can feel more like the end of a relationship than the beginning.”

“Ugh. You’ve just got to make everything political, don’t you?” Rosalyn groaned. “So who was there?”

“Lottie, Genevieve’s half-brother and his girlfriend, my sister and her family, and my dad,” I explained. “I did invite my mom on the condition that she be respectful, and she chose not to attend, which was considerate of her. She’s not hateful, or anything, but she’s never been shy about the fact that she wishes I had turned out more like my sister, and she and Genevieve in particular… don’t get along. But my dad still came, which I really appreciated.”

“He gave her away,” Genevieve said with a slight roll of her eyes.

“It’s traditional,” I teased.

“So are diamonds,” Rosalyn remarked after a closer inspection of my wedding ring. “Um, not that it’s any of my business, but what about your parents, Eve?”

“I was basically raised by my Great Aunt. My dad’s a deadbeat I’m not on speaking terms with, and though I’m not on bad terms with my mom, we’re not close and she doesn’t live around here anymore, so she’s wasn’t there either,” she replied. “Can we get going now? We can talk more on the drive if you want.”

“Yeah, sure thing. Seneca will probably throw a tantrum if we keep him waiting too long,” Rosalyn agreed. “Right this way, Ms. And Mrs. Fawn.”

“I am not *Mrs. Fawn*,” I objected.

“Sorry babe, but your dad did give you to me, so you are now officially ‘Of-Fawn’,” she teased me. “It’s traditional.”

\*\*\*

The ride towards the old Crow Estate was mostly occupied with talk of mine and Genevieve’s wedding, which I was grateful for. Rosalyn’s crossover was a company car from *Thorne Tech*, which included proprietary level-3 self-driving software and other advanced AI features. I had no doubt that everything we said and did in that car was being recorded and analyzed, so I wasn’t eager to let any potentially sensitive information slip out.

Once we were about three miles outside of town, we took a turn down a sideroad that was thickly shrouded with evergreens. This went on for another half mile or so before we turned down a long, winding driveway that terminated at a small, stone mansion enclosed by a cobblestone fence. There was an old copper gate that had turned green with time, and as we approached it was opened by one of Seneca Chamberlin’s personal security guards. There were already two other vehicles parked outside of the manor; a black SUV which presumably belonged to the guards, and an extended Rolls-Royce Ghost, which could only have belonged to Seneca.

“Doesn’t Seneca drive a Bentley?” I asked.

“He drives Bentleys; plural,” Rosalyn replied. “He’s chauffeured in his Royces, and the Aston Martins are just for show. He obviously doesn’t share your aversion to conspicuous consumption. If he ever had a wedding, it would be a banger. Not as expensive as the divorce, but pretty swanky.”

After she parked us a generous distance away from Seneca’s prestigious motor carriage, I got out and took a moment to inspect the Crow’s old estate. It was fairly long with steep and pointed black roofs and multiple towers and chimneys. The weatherworn walls were covered in creeping ivy, and numerous weeping cypress trees swayed about in the wind upon the grounds. The whole place gave off an air of forlorn isolation, and I couldn’t help but be reminded of the first time I laid eyes upon Elam standing watch over a grave in our cemetery.

Elam had already made himself manifest again, and he now stood patiently by the front stairs, looking up at his old house with apparent detachment.

“Is it hard for you, being here?” I asked gently.

“I couldn’t have taken it with me anyway, right?” he shrugged. “I’d take haunting your cemetery over this funeral parlour any day.”

“Have you ever come back here before? After your death, I mean?” I asked.

“No, I never saw much point in that. I don’t really feel much nostalgia for the old place,” he said, his gaze steadily surveying the grounds from one end to the other.

“I imagine it must have been difficult growing up here, isolated with such a weird old family,” I said.

“I don’t have any right to complain,” he claimed, though he hung his head slightly. “It wasn’t that bad, at least not up until the very end.”

I took a hold of his hand, which if you’re not an experienced necromancer is something you definitely shouldn’t try at home, and walked with him up the steps to the front door.

I was just about to knock when the door was thrown open by Seneca’s odd little butler Woodbead.

“Good day, Miss Sumner. We’re very pleased you were able to meet us here on such short notice,” he greeted me with a curt bow.

“It’s Mrs. Fawn now!” Rosalyn shouted from behind us.

“No. No, it isn’t. I’m still Ms. Sumner,” I corrected her. “As requested, my wife and my spirit familiar are here to help Mr. Chamberlin access a vault which we believe may contain a document that is addressed to me.”

“Master Chamberlin has already set to work at that task and is eagerly awaiting your arrival,” Woodbead replied. “If you’ll kindly follow me, I shall take you to him at once.”

We all filed into the house, and saw that in the years since Seneca had taken possession of it, he had removed everything of any possible interest or value. Only the occasional spartan furnishing like a lamp or a desk had been left behind.

“Seneca’s not using this as a guest house, I see,” Genevieve commented. “But it’s not on the market, either. He must really want what’s in that vault.”

“It’s to be his or no one’s, Ma’am. He’s not one to part with a treasure once it’s fallen into his hands,” Woodbead said.

“Then why didn’t he ever ask for our help before?” I asked. “He’s known about Elam for years.”

“If you had accepted my offer to join the Ophion Occult Order, rest assured breaking into this blasted vault would have been amongst the first things I would have ordered you to do,” I heard Seneca shout from the next room, obviously within earshot. “After that, there were simply more important things going on, and you’ve never really been inclined to help me unless you believed it also served some kind of common good. If you were simply more amicable to cash incentives, we could have gotten this chore done with ages ago.”

We passed into the next room and saw Seneca bent over in front of a tall iron door with the enlarged face of an aged and wizened man rising out of it; a face that Genevieve and I immediately recognized.

“That’s Artaxerxes Crow,” I remarked as I cautiously approached it. I tentatively stretched my hand out towards it, the air becoming rapidly more chill the closer I got. I chose to snap my hand back rather than touch it, and then noticed a plaque mounted above the frame.

“*‘Gold is for the Mistress. Silver for the maid. Copper for the craftsman, cunning at his trade’*,” I read aloud. “*‘Good!’ said the Baron, sitting in his hall. ‘But Iron – Cold Iron – is master of them all’*.”

“It’s a Kipling poem, written about a century after Xerxes made this thing, but I guess Eratosthenes thought it was fitting,” Seneca commented.

“The vault is made from Cold Iron?” I asked.

“Exceptionally pure and alchemically enhanced Cold Iron,” Seneca expounded. “Repels ghosts, Witches, Fae, and is strong enough that I can’t just blast it open without risking serious damage to whatever’s inside.”

“What’s Cold Iron?” Rosalyn asked.

“It’s kind of a broad term for any iron alloy that’s had its innate anti-thaumaturgical properties enhanced,” I replied. “Basically, it draws astral and psionic energy out of you like ordinary metal conducts heat. That’s what makes it ‘cold’.  The more of those you have, the stronger the effect.”

“Wait, the whole vault is made out of Cold Iron? Not just the door?” Genevieve asked. “Then even if we open it, Samantha and I won’t be able to go in. Neither will Elam.”

“You say that like it’s a bug and not a feature,” Seneca smirked.

“It’s fine, Evie. We’ll still be able to see inside, and it can’t be that big,” I said. “Elam, were you ever in there when you were still alive?”

“Never. By tradition, only the patriarch of the family was permitted access to this vault, a title which my father refused to pass down to me,” he replied.

“Mind the p-word in front of the Witches; you’ll get them all riled up,” Seneca said.

“Wait, Elam had pussy in there?” Rosalyn asked.

“No! That’s not… that’s not what he said,” I replied promptly. “Seneca, Rose said that you already know how to open the vault, and that you just required Elam’s presence?”

“That’s correct. The mechanical lock isn’t actually all that sophisticated, and a bit of rudimentary safecracking was all that was needed to work out the combination,” he replied. “There are three dials, each with nine numbers a piece and a seven-digit code. But no matter what I try, every time I enter the combination it realizes I’m not a Crow and the lock resets.”

“I know how it works,” Elam added. “I just have to stand in front of the door and look the effigy of Artaxerxes in the eye as the combination is entered.”

“But no member of the Crow family ever tried getting into this vault from beyond the grave before, right?” Genevieve asked. “It obviously wasn’t intended for that, being made out of Cold Iron. Has even a living Crow just stood in front of the door while someone else input the combination? If the spellwork here is as impenetrable as you think, this might not work.”

“Artaxerxes obviously put a lot of work into this, and it’s hard to imagine there are many contingencies he didn’t anticipate,” I agreed.

“Which is precisely why we’ll all be standing well out of harm’s way while Woodbead enters the code,” Seneca explained, fetching a small folded piece of paper from his pockets. “He’ll read it off this, then destroy it immediately. He’s more than willing to put his life on the line in the name of duty, and Elam’s already dead so he has nothing to worry about. Now, places, everyone, places!”

I wanted to object, but Seneca’s security guards had silently appeared and were already firmly ushering us to the threshold of the room. Woodbead was the only living person left inside, and he didn’t appear to be the least bit reluctant. As uncomfortable as it made me, I didn’t see any grounds for aborting the attempt.

“Seneca, if this is a repeat of what happened at Triskelion Theatre, I swear to God – ” Genevieve began.

“A Wiccan’s oath to the God of Abraham is hardly anything I take seriously, my dear,” he cut her off. “When you’re ready Mr. Woodbead!”

Woodbead bowed obsequiously and quickly began spinning the dials, entering only one number at a time as he moved from top to bottom, alternating between clockwise and counter-clockwise turns. Elam gave me a reassuring nod, then turned to lock eyes with the iron face of his forefather.

One by one, the tumblers fell into place, and when Woodbead entered the last digit we all listened eagerly to see if the lock would either open or reset.

But neither happened.

Instead, the eyes of Artaxerxes Crow began to glow with the Chthonic aura of the Underworld, and we watched in dismay as the iron face moved its bearded mouth to speak.

“A… familiar?” the hoarse old voice asked softly in disdain. “Impossible! Your soul belongs to the Dread Persephone!”

“Too many of us failed to honour the pact you made with Persephone, and our bloodline came to an end,” Elam explained after only a moment of dismayed hesitation. “But in my last month of life, I befriended a Witch, and she renegotiated the pact you made. Thanks to her, my daughter and any other virtuous members of our family were freed from the unjust afterlife that you had condemned us to, and I am now bound to her as her spirit familiar. But dead or not, I am still the only Crow who now walks the Living Earth, and everything in this vault is rightfully mine, so I command you to open.”

“Renegotiated?” the face asked, seemingly not caring about much else of what was said. “How? What could she possibly have offered Persephone that was worth my entire bloodline?”

“You,” Elam replied smugly. “She found that immaculate corpse of yours you hid in the mausoleum. Persephone was not at all pleased to learn that you had made a fool of her, and happily – okay, maybe not happily – but willingly took you in exchange for our freedom. You, the real you, is finally where he belongs.”

The face winced, partially in anger, but also in confusion. It seemed that if Artaxerxes had anticipated this outcome, he hadn’t prepared for it. If Persephone had his soul, then all was lost and nothing else mattered.

“What is that thing?” Rosalyn whispered.

“A Golem… I think,” I replied. “I don’t know what else it could be.”

“A Cold Iron Golem?” Genevieve asked skeptically. “How is that possible?”

“I don’t know. I’m a necromancer, not an alchemist, but Artaxerxes obviously figured out a way,” I replied.

“Extraordinary,” Seneca said, his eyes wide with wonder as it dawned on him that the vault itself might actually be worth more than whatever was inside it. “To think this has been under my nose all these years.”

“Ah, Samantha!” Elam called over his shoulder. “I think it’s… glitching.”

The face seemed to be shaking now, gently vibrating the walls at a slow but steadily increasing rate. Its Chthonic aura intensified while all other light seemed to vanish, tendrils of ghostly pale ectoplasm leaking from its eyes and lashing out at anything they could reach. Its mouth hung open in a faltering scream, not one of pain or fear or rage but more simply of need. Like an infant, it instinctively knew that something was wrong, and all it knew to do in that situation was to cry louder and louder until its needs were answered.

“Have Woodbead reset the lock! That might put it back to sleep!” I suggested.

“Woodbead, you are to do no such thing! This is the closest we’ve ever come to opening this door!” Seneca countered. “Elam, you do what you were summoned here to do and make that door stop crying this instant!”

“Ah… Golem? I say again; I am now the last Crow upon the Living Earth,” Elam said firmly. “Your master forged you to serve his bloodline, so –”

He screamed in pain as he was ensnared in the Golem’s ectoplasmic tendrils, crumbling to his knees and his astral form flickering out like a waning ember.

“Elam!” I shouted, starting to bolt into the room before Seneca grabbed me by the shoulder.

“Don’t be foolish! We don’t know what that will do to you!” he yelled.

“I appear to be unaffected, sir, though I do kindly request permission to make a timely retreat,” Woodbead shouted.

“Granted! We need to get out of here before this whole building collapses!” Seneca agreed.  “Never mind about Elam. He’s a ghost; he’ll be fine!”

“You don’t know that, and you don’t know that Golem will stop after it’s destroyed the house!” I argued. “We can’t just run away! We need to put a stop to this!”

“But Samantha; what can we do?” Genevieve asked softly as she gazed upon the enormous Cold Iron face in helpless horror.

I thought for a moment, desperately trying to come up with anything we could do to bring it under control.

“It’s… It’s a Golem. It needs orders,” I said, grabbing hold of the first pen and piece of paper I could find. “With Artaxerxes claimed by Persephone, its original orders are moot. It needs new ones.”

“Are you daft? You can’t write Golemic script, especially for a Golem you know nearly nothing about!” Seneca objected.

“I’ve read Artaxerxes’ journals and the other tomes he left in the cemetery,” I countered as I frantically scribbled away on the paper. “I know a lot of what he knew, and I know a lot about how he thought. I can do this.”

“Are those Sybilline sigils you’re drawing?” he asked in disbelief. “It’s a Golem! The script needs to be in Hebrew!”

“You said it yourself; a Witch swearing by the God of Abraham isn’t worth much,” I replied, quickly folding up the paper. “If it’s sacred to me, it will still work.”

“Samantha, what did you write?” he demanded.

“No time!” I claimed as I darted into the room.

Seneca tried to come after me, but Genevieve was able to hold him back just long enough for me to make it to the vault. The tendrils of ectoplasm were dense but clustered enough that I could avoid them. The Golem was screaming so loud now that it hurt my ears to stand so close to it. The air was vibrating so strongly that I feared that if I simply threw the paper into its mouth it would just be blown backwards, so instead I placed it upon its tongue as swiftly as I could.

The instant I drew my hand back, the jaws snapped shut, and the screaming came to a sudden stop. Its glowing eyes locked with mine, and with a single, solemn nod I knew that it accepted the new orders it had been given. The Chthonic aura dissipated, the face fell still, and the vault door slipped ajar by the tiniest of cracks.

Letting out a sigh of relief I turned to check on Elam. He had demanifested, but I could still sense him through our bond and I knew that he wasn’t seriously hurt or banished back to the Underworld.

Seneca rushed straight to the door and tried to pry its mouth open, only to find that it was as if it were all one solid piece of iron.

“Samantha, what did you tell it to do?” he demanded, looking at me as if a favourite pet had decided it liked me more than him.

“Essentially I told it that since Artaxerxes had been laid to rest in Harrowick Cemetery, the caretaker of that cemetery would logically be his caretaker as well, and in the absence of a living or otherwise acceptable Crow, that caretaker would be who it should answer to,” I admitted. “That didn’t conflict with any of its other scrolls, luckily, so it accepted it.”

“And you couldn’t have told it to recognize the legal manager of the Crows’ estate instead?” Seneca demanded, angrily enough that Genevieve assumed a defensive position between him and I.

“Do you really think that Xerxes wouldn’t have explicitly told his Golem to never accept you as its master?” I asked rhetorically.

“No. No, I suppose not,” he conceded with a defeated sigh, slowly regaining his composure.

“The vault is open. My end of our bargain is fulfilled. I expect you to keep yours,” I said firmly.

“Of course,” he said as he took in a deep breath and straightened up to his full height. He placed a hand on the vault’s handle as if to open it, but then stopped abruptly. “Oh dear. This is a bit embarrassing. It seems I’ve had a small lapse in memory. I actually did come across the documents you were looking for while I was sorting through the filing cabinets in the study.”

He reached into his jacket and pulled out an envelope of rich dark brown paper, and held it out with a polite smile as I stared at him in utter disbelief.

“You unbelievable bastard!” I finally shouted. “You had it the whole time!”

“You made us open this damn vault for you for nothing!” Genevieve screamed.

“Not for nothing. For this, as we agreed,” he replied calmly.

“Why should I believe you? How do I know you didn’t make that yourself – or more likely ordered Woodbead to do it?” I demanded.

“Now surely a Witch of your talents would be able to tell a genuine prophecy from a humble forgery,” he replied, proffering the envelope with a small flourish.

I snatched it out of his hand and pulled out the folded sheets of torn-out notebook paper inside, reading over the nearly illegible scrawl as quickly as I could.

“You lied to us! We deserve to see what’s inside that vault!” Genevieve yelled.

“I did not lie. I had an honest lapse in memory,” he lied. “I’m well over two hundred years old, you know. These things happen. But I’m afraid our transaction is complete and quite frankly you two have worn out your welcome.”

He snapped at his security guards and whistled for them to escort us out.

“Evie, it’s fine,” I said calmly as I put the paper back into its envelope and slipped it into my satchel. “We got what we came here for. Let’s just go.”

I turned around and took her by the hand, pulling her back out into the front yard.

“Dude, you didn’t just lie to them; you lied to Ivy! You are going to be in so much shit for this!” Rosalyn told him as she chased after us, profusely apologizing as she ushered us back to the crossover.

Before we stepped into the surveilled vehicle, but were well out of sight of Seneca and his goons, Elam manifested by my side and quickly leaned in to whisper something crucial into my ear.

“I memorized the combination Seneca wrote down,” he said before vanishing back into the aether.

I tried not to visibly react, but I think I did smile just a little bit. All and all, it had been a pretty productive day.
