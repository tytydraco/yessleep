Hello, before introducing myself i need to be clear that what I have witnessed no human should ever even think about it, it made me question my faith. I need to show this to the world.

I won’t be able to fully convey what I have gone through, but i’ll try my best. Please proceed with caution.

In my line of work secrecy is one of the most important things, so I won’t be writing my real name here, but you can just call me Priest.

I am a part of the Vatican Catholic Church as an Ordained Priest and exorcist for decades now. I have traveled around the world, been in all continents, and I have witnessed many things, miracles that would make even the most cetic of people have faith.

And I am one of the few exorcists left that actually know what they’re doing nowadays. General media such as movies and books are of misleading nature. Exorcisms are grueling, awful rites that no priest wants to go through. They can take days and leave you completely drained mentally, physically and spiritually.

My first exorcism took 13 hours to fully expel the demon from its host, I passed out 2 times and lost vision in one eye. They say the first one is generally the worst, and in most cases that’s true, you’re inexperienced and anxious, the demon will use that against you. It will use anything it can against you. I am used to it and other tatics these rats use, so I thought my latest work was just going to be another normal (as normal as it can be) job.

But no, things got weird the exact moment a letter from the pope itself arrived in my office, forcing me, and a team of other 6 other priests to get ready for a job, Double the amount of professionals generally advised for the job.

It was a remote and poor place in South America, that’s all I can say. The house, if you can call it that, was covered by vegetation, mud and was made out of wood that was rotting. Not too different from the other jobs, demons like filthy spaces.

We stayed there, steps away from the door no one wanted to knock, there was something weird about it all.

The first tell, all the insects around the house were dead, a lot of flies and other kind of bugs, all dead. Demons usually attract these things, but always alive, never dead like it was.

I finally gathered courage to knock on the door. 4 knocks as it has to be, always even, never odd.

A young lady opened it, she was visibly distressed, dressed in hags and really scared. We prayed before entering and that’s were the nightmare begun.

She only knew Spanish, but thankfully one of us could translate it for the team.

The house had only one room, they had no furniture inside aside from two beds. But they had a lot of religious imagery, I counted 33 crosses.

The lady showed us her mother, an old lady, 93 years old, very devoted religiously. She was also covered in hags, only her face was visible. That was strange, generally demons prefer young people, specially girls, this those movies got right.

We promoted the young lady to leave the house, the furthest she could.

Another odd thing, the old woman stood frozen in place, no movement aside from breathing, we were used to seeing people shake and contort themselves, this wasn’t normal.

Before leaving the young lady said that her mother knelled down the previous day to pray, she was blind, but her daughter said that she said just two words “I see.” then she started burning a really orange fire, after that she passed away. When she woke up she placed her mother in bed. 

We weren’t the first to come here, she called her local religious figure, someone from the town, but he “disappeared out of nowhere”when she blinked the moment she opened the door, according to her. So far he has not been found. 

Anyway, we made our preparations, prayed and protected the house with holy water blessed directly from the pope. This process took an hour and the old lady stayed frozen in place the whole time, each time I took a look at her my heart raced like never before, even though she stood still in bed. After that I got ready to start the exorcism, we had decided previously that I would direct it.

We brought the necessary equipment, holy water, crosses, lights and a holy dagger as a last resort.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church has a strict guideline to exorcisms, starting always with “In the name of The Father, and The Son, And the holy Spirit.”

The exact moment when I said it a bright flash consumed to room. I remember we all falling to our knees and praying, it was the calmest and most scared i ever felt in my life, keep in mind I had done 12 exorcisms already, in which people got injured and some even died.

It hurt and healed, it was harm and cold, it was life and death, the absolute.

2 of our team of 6 had passed out, later I discovered that both are in the hospital, with severe brain damage. 

After that bright light stopped flashing it revealed a small orb of some kind of golden energy, and from inside it a shape was forming. At first it looked like a human silhouette, then it looked like an animal, something similar to a lion, and for the last, it turned into some kind thing I can only describe as a mixture of an vaguely humanoid body with several wings, an infinite amount of wings that hid its true body, each time i counted one, three had already appeared.

And the wings had eyes everywhere, that burned bright red.

Tears were rolling down my face, a mixture of fear and calmness consumed my paralyzed body.

“You should not be afraid” A voice echoed from all sides of the room, penetrating my ear, and feeling me with dread. It was high and low at the same time.

I don’t know what the others were doing, but i ways praying everything i knew and didn’t, in every language i knew and every language i didn’t.

With each prayer I regained more autonomy over my body, and, with every energy I had left I proclaimed.

“The power of christ expels you! The power of God excommunicates you from this body and The Holy Spirit annihilates your presence in this realm!”

I remember the word echoed in my ears clearly, I can still hear them.

“Begone.”

After that things start to get a little bit blurry in my mind, but I clearly remember the thing announcing himself.

“I am a Seraphim of God, my name is (it said something unintelligible) and I have come here to announce the descent of the Reigns of Heaven.”

The priest standing in my right at that moment passed out too, dead, I discovered later.

“Go back to where you belong!” I screamed.

“I grow tired of God’s will.” The voice said.

“Leave this body right now!” I fell to my side after saying that.

“I need this body to stay in this realm, I have been searching for ages for a suitable vessel.” 

I couldn’t move anymore, so I screamed for one of my partners, the one with the holy dagger, to kill the host, the last thing you should do in a exorcism.

He slowly gathered energy to move and with one quick blow he stabbed the old lady with the dagger, and before I passed out, the last thing I saw was he completely evaporating before me. 

I woke up in a hospital bed, Most of the priests by my side were dead or almost dead.

I don’t speak Spanish, so I couldn’t understand a thing they said, but quickly someone I knew came to pick me up, and now I’m at the Vatican again.

The pleasure and the pain, the greatness of the situation will never be replicated and I feel extremely depressed after that. I can’t make out sense of anything the thing said to me, or what it wanted, but what I know is that it probably won’t end up well.
