I should have listened when the innkeeper handed us the key. She pressed the wooden tag into my palm and didn’t let go for a second too long. Her dark eyes flicked toward the ocean and she said, 

“Don’t go to the beach at night.”

My husband, Mark, laughed softly. “Why? Are the tides too rough?” 

She stared at us without a single word. She looked like she was about to say something but instead turned away. On the porch behind her, a group of women watched us and whispered amongst themselves. “They’re probably superstitious,” Mark whispered when we carried our bags upstairs. “Old island legends.”

But as we walked through town that afternoon I noticed something was wrong.

I saw women sitting on crates, sewing clothing. Women were out sweeping their porches and running errands. When we got to the restaurant a woman came and took our order. When I went to the bathroom, on my way back I caught a glance of the kitchen as the door closed. There were only women cooking there. When I got back to the table I nudged Mark lightly and said, 

“I haven’t seen any men here. Isn’t that weird?”

He squinted. “I think you’re overthinking it”

Maybe. Maybe not.

We planned to watch the sunset and then head straight back. I repeated the innkeeper’s warning in my head. Don’t go to the beach at night. I almost said it out loud when Mark packed the wine, but he looked so happy that I swallowed it and followed him to the beach.

Mark put down a nice quilt on the ground and we sat down as he poured the wine. The sky melted into a warm orange ribbon. Mark clinked his plastic cup against mine and grinned. I laughed and touched his cup. The waves sighed against the shore. The air smelled like salt and something sweet. For a moment it was just us and the world felt held together by warm light.

But then the sun slipped under the horizon and the temperature dropped sharply. Fog pooled at the shoreline and began drifting toward us. It was thin at first, just a pale sheet rolling over the sand. Then it wrapped around us and thickened until I could barely see Mark.

I rubbed my arms. “It’s freezing. We should head back.”

Mark leaned back into the sand, closing his eyes. “Just a few more minutes. We just got cozy.”

My breath showed white in the air. Something instinctive kicked in, my heart started pounding.

This felt like a bad omen. “Mark, we should go. Seriously.”

Before he could answer, a sound drifted through the fog. A song that rose from the ocean with the grace of a goddess. I froze. The melody wasn’t like anything else I had ever heard. My throat tightened and a tear slid down my cheek.

Mark didn’t speak. He didn’t even blink.

“Mark?” I whispered. “Do you hear that?” He didn’t answer. His eyes were set straight into the fog, it reflected in them like silver. “Mark, look at me.” I shook his arm gently.

He stood. I grabbed his wrist. “Hey, what are you doing?” He didn’t look at me. He stepped forward, slow and steady, toward the shoreline hidden under the fog.

 “Stop.” My voice cracked. “Stop. Come back here.” He kept walking. The voice in the fog swelled, its notes trembling with warmth, pulling Mark deeper into its embrace. “Mark, stop. Please stop.”

He walked into the shallow water. The waves curled around his feet. I lunged and grabbed his arm with both hands. “You can’t go in there. Do you hear me?”

He spoke for the first time since the singing began. His voice sounded thin, like it came from far away.

“She’s flawless.”

My stomach dropped. “Who? Mark, who?” His eyes were wide open. He stared into the fog with a wide grin. I followed his gaze and saw nothing but shifting white.

He stepped deeper. I dug in my heels and pulled with everything I had, but he kept moving. The water climbed his shins, then his knees. My pants soaked instantly. I choked on the cold air. “Mark, please. Please look at me.”

He didn’t. He kept walking. The next wave hit us and knocked me off balance. I clung to him desperately, nails biting into his arm. The water surged around our waists. My teeth chattered. Then he stepped again and dragged us both under.

The world vanished in a rush of freezing black. I clamped my mouth shut and kicked upward, fighting the weight of our clothes, of the current, of him. My fingers slipped on his arm once, then again. I tried to grab his shirt but it slid from my grip.

A moment later my hands closed on nothing. My lungs screamed. I forced myself upward and broke through the surface. I gasped violently, coughing seawater, blinking against the fog. “Mark!” I choked out. “Mark!”

I dove again, my arms cutting blindly through the water. Cold sand brushed my fingertips, then nothing. When I surfaced again the singing had stopped. “Mark!” My voice bounced off the fog and died.

My entire body shook as I swam back to the shore. I felt the waves slam me into the sand. I collapsed onto my hands and knees. The fog slowly thinned, and the only sound was the restless tide.

I wrapped my arms around myself and stared into the sea. I sat there for a long time, whispering his name until my voice broke. I was alone on that dark shore, watching the waves that had swallowed my husband whole.
