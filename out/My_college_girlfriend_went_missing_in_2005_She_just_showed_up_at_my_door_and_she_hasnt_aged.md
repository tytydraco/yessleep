“Melissa?” I gasped.

Abject horror must have been painted on my nonplussed face. The girl was no *figurative* ghost from my past — I could see her tangible form before me, as plainly as the doorstep on which she stood.

I was eighteen years old when she went missing. We were university freshers, and we’d been dating since college — or the twelfth grade in the States. Boyfriends are often suspects in cases of missing women, so I was unphased by the incessant police questioning. However, much to many people’s disbelief, Melissa’s disappearance was a mystery to me.

When I first entered her dorm room, after twenty-four hours without contact, everything was untouched. No sign of forced entry. On Melissa’s desk, there was a sturdy stack of biology books, a Nokia brick-phone — which was ordinarily welded to her hand — and, perhaps most ominously, a lifeless plate of day-old lasagna.

Eighteen years later, at the age of thirty-six, that vivid, vibrant memory had not waned in my mind. The most horrifying thing about Melissa’s sudden reappearance — three hours ago — was that she hadn’t aged. Like a snapshot of the past, she was still wearing the purple plaid cardigan and denim jeans from the last day on which I’d seen her.

“Hi, Andy,” Melissa said.

The eighteen-year-old girl on my porch did not allow me more than a few seconds to gather my thoughts. That was probably for the best, as I think my mind might’ve shattered if I’d tried to piece together the impossibility before me.

“You’re probably wondering where I’ve been for so many years,” She sheepishly said.

“I’m wondering a lot of things right now,” I breathlessly spluttered.

“Let me show you,” She eerily whispered.

Before I had a chance to refuse, my ageless ex-girlfriend seized my hand, and the world swirled into a kaleidoscope of colours. Bright, beautiful hues of red, yellow, blue, and green encompassed me. They quickly morphed into grim, ghastly shades of black. I shrieked in terror at the dreadful vision that followed.

In the darkness, I caught frightful flashes of the day on which Melissa disappeared. A faceless silhouette apprehended her in a forest, and Melissa kept crying that she had no idea how she’d ended up there. The shadowy presence ignored her pleas for help, instead dragging her to its darkened cave and slowly stretching her body over itself like a snugly winter coat. Melissa screamed, inexplicably still alive, as the silhouette clothed itself in her body. When the screaming ceased, the thing that pretended to be my girlfriend calmly strolled out of the cave.

Our real surroundings returned, and I found myself facing the abomination on my porch. Melissa’s face started to melt, as if she were a wax candle — the wick being her lopsided head. Her grin was sickening. It wasn’t the warm, endearing smile of the girl I used to know. It was the crooked, ill-meaning expression of something feigning humanity.

“I love you so much, Andy,” Melissa said. “It’s been so painful without you. I didn’t realise that was what my body needed. That’s the missing ingredient. I can’t sustain myself without you.”

It stretched a gauntly hand towards me, stepping towards my front door as I took a step backwards. I couldn’t utter a word. I could scarcely move, but I eventually summoned the courage to hightail it through my house and out of the back door.

I took the first bus I hailed, and I’ve been on the road for three hours. I don’t know where I’m going, and I don’t care. I decided to post what happened on here in the hope that somebody could tell me what the *fuck* just knocked on my door.

It definitely wasn’t Melissa, and I don’t think it’ll stop until it finds me again.
