September 2nd, 2025. A call from the owner of this profile, who will be referred to as ‘T’, contacted emergency services, a copy of the transcript will be provided below.

Operator: “911 what's your emergency?”

Loud banging is heard from the line, as well as T breathing heavily and wincing in pain.

T: “HELLO? GOD IT FUCKING HURTS PLEASE HELP ME!!”

Operator: “Alright mam I need you to calm down, tell me what's going on.”

T: “Someone's trying to break into my- AH GOD FUCK!”

A shrill, high pitched whining was heard alongside the rhythmic banging, and cursing of T.

Operator: “Mam are you hurt? Please try to tell me what's happening.”

T: “God fuck, the plant, it won't stop screaming!! It hurts so fucking bad!! Fuck, I should've just gone to the doctor!”

Operator: “I'm sorry, a plant? What are you talking about? Could you please-”

T: “THE PLANT IN MY ARM!! It's screaming- it must've called it here. And now it's breaking down the fucking door!”

Operator: “Someone's trying to break down your door? Mam please try to relax and stay quiet-”

T: “Stay quiet?! It's fucking impossible!! The plant won't stop screaming!!”

T suddenly gasps, then falls silent for a moment. A loud crash is heard, and the constant shrill wailing continues.

T: “I-it got in! Jesus fuck it got in!! PLEASE HELP ME!”

T was now yelling through sobs, barely coherent. Loud bangs were heard, then the sounds of T’s screams. Among the cries of agony from T, and the unidentifiable high pitched squealing, was the clear grunts of an older man.

Operator: “Mam?! Mam are you okay?! Hello?!

Eventually, T’s screams were silenced. The screeching from an unknown source slowly faded away, leaving the operator in silence for a few moments. Then, heavy breathing.

Operator: …mam?

The operator sounded shaken from what they had heard. The heavy breathing was followed by a few short thumps, then a loud crack. The call ended shortly after.

The police showed up to the residence of T and immediately contacted the FAA upon discovery of the seedbed. The victim's body had been mangled and used as soil for the ‘Red Radix’, an infectious and highly lethal pathogen long researched by the FAA.

Red branches and roots sprouted from the victims flesh on every inch of their body. They had become a seedbed for the pathogen and would spread to the neighboring houses if not purged. The victim's house was destroyed with a controlled fire to ensure the extinction of the Red Radix seedbed. 

Red Radix is a long confidential Floraturgical pathogen, it grows in the flesh and attaches its roots to the host's nervous system and blood vessels. 

It takes mere days to grow to full size, branching out from the host's flesh and siphoning their blood. Once it has matured it will radiate a high pitched frequency, signalling the nearest Red Father.

A Red Father is a powerful and incredibly fast organism that was once an organism hosting the Red Radix. Organisms chosen by the pathogen to become Red Fathers are often larger or more dexterous animals like bears or adult human males. 

Upon hearing the frequency from the budding Red Radix sprout, The Red Father will immediately locate the source for the signal and destroy the host, inseminating them with a Red Radix seedbed.

At this point the Radix seedbed will choose to become a Red Father or Red Mother, the decision is informed by the host's physical capabilities. In the case of T, the seedbed was growing into a Red Mother, and had to be purged immediately.

A Red Mother is a mess of splintering red branches, twitching crimson veins sprouting out of the host in all directions. It is unknown exactly what the function of a Red Mother is, given that Red Fathers singlehandedly spread the pathogen.

What is known is that wherever a Red Mother is rooted, all organic life in the surrounding area seems to be inexplicably attracted to it. Dozens of animals and even a few human neighbors were found kneeling near T’s inseminated corpse and had to be dragged away.

If you or someone you know has come into contact with the Red Radix, inform the FAA immediately and quarantine the subject in question.

If you or someone you know feel that you have come into contact with any Floraturgy related Flora or have concerns regarding strange plants you may have seen, inform the FAA immediately and stay as far away from the Flora as possible.
