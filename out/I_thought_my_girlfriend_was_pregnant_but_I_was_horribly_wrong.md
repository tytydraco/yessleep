I’d been with my partner, Jordan, for six months when I became suspicious that she was pregnant.

She had no wish to be a mother, a fact she’d expressed vehemently from the beginning of our relationship. Whatever maternal urges she might have had were devoted to an ever-changing zoo of exotic pets whose complex demands swallowed up the majority of her spare time and financial resources, yet even had she given them up Jordan was often away with work at some job that she refused to leave.

So when I began to notice symptoms that led me to believe she was carrying my child I was unsurprised by her denial.

“It’s nothing,” she’d snap even as she trembled queasily against me at night. “It comes and goes. I’m used to it.”

It agitated me that she ignored, with gritted teeth, the obvious, each cramp and twinge of tenderness in her dismissed as the result of some vague ailment or over exhaustion through exercise.

I feared that she would plummet into a state of utter denial even as her condition became visually evident, although perhaps it would not. Jordan was of a tall, muscular physique, her stomach as rigid as a curve of bone; I could well imagine her having one of those ghostly pregnancies in which a foetus lay so high and far up in the womb that it did not show until the last leg of its residence.

As the months went on Jordan’s recurrent symptoms convinced me that this was indeed the case. Yet even my most subtle suggestion of visiting a doctor incited such fits of anger in her that I became suspicious she knew exactly what she suffered.

Why Jordan kept it from me I could only suppose— the child was ill, perhaps, or bound to die, or fathered by someone else. This would have explained the frequent disappearances she had claimed were work trips, the validity of which I could neither prove nor deny.

Jordan had never told me what manner of employment kept her so unavailable for a week or some days of every month; she was, in fact, elusive about many aspects of her life to the point that I knew nothing of her family or birth country, of what friends she kept, or even what animals she tended.

I was never allowed into the room they were stored in, the reason for which Jordan would never detail.

My frustration and sense of disquiet surrounding her secrecy as to all things, particularly her illness, increased to such maddening proportions that I could think of nothing else. 

Jordan had always been elusive since the beginning; I’d found that quality in her attractive, then, her silence like that of some queen in a fairy tale, her dark, solemn eyes changed then only by lust rather than the quick boil of her anger.

I knew that there had been a man she’d loved before me, now cast aside for some unnamed infraction, that she moved frequently, remaining in one city for a year or so, that was all.

I’d been unquestioning, intoxicated by the ease of her love, which came without the expectations or demands that had dissolved all of my previous relationships in my unwillingness to accede. Now I recognised her behaviour as the fettering of truth it disgusted me to consider how I had been misled.

When again Jordan declared she must leave me to travel for her ambiguous trade I attempted from every angle I could think of to convince her to decline the venture and remain home to convalesce. She had on her the wild smell of sweat and unwashed hair, her breaths the short, deep sucking of an attempt to restrain a violent nausea.

How Jordan imagined she could work in this condition I could not fathom. Her denial of reality panicked me to the point that I stood in the doorway of my flat to prevent her from departing to her own abode, insisting that she accept help before her ailment consumed her.

I watched Jordan’s still face erupt with a sudden fury she quickly restrained like a subliminal frame in a piece of film, and in almost an instinctual motion I stepped aside from the door so she could pass. 

“When are you coming back?” I asked, weakly, but she didn’t answer, only strode off down the hallway, her hardened shoulders bent slightly in the throes of her condition.

The sight of her turned back elicited a dart of fear through me, not for my partner, but for myself.

I couldn’t identify where it had come from, or where it had begun, for as I felt it I realised that it had been a germ within me for some time.

The following day—the first of that month without Jordan, who had sent word of having left by train in an elusive hour of the morning—I went about my work within a state of restlessness, unable to rid myself of the crawling sense that something in Jordan was misaligned. Not right.

That it had nothing to do with the child I was convinced we'd made together.

I walked home from the office that night, winding by habit down the street on which Jordan lived. The weather was filthy, a knifing horizontal rain that swept beneath the tatters of my umbrella into my mouth, filling it with the taste of iron and tarmac sent up from the road.

Through a threadbare quilt of cloud the moon stared out like the eye of a blind dog, and with its light I saw that Jordan's car was still in the driveway of her house, unmoved since the day before.

A pulse of anger that she had lied to me caught me up in its red grasp before the perturbation that had previously haunted me struck in like a second source of wind.

I ran up to the door and knocked, unsure if Jordan would answer or if I'd be turned away into the rain. Yet in under a minute she answered, staring at me with a dull, pained resignation.

"You didn't go to work," I said redundantly. "Too sick?

"Yeah," Jordan muttered, and then she added, "You shouldn't have come."

I was startled by how quickly her appearance had declined, the tail of her long, black hair adhered to her back with sickly moisture, her powerful body covered only by an old nightdress as though she could not bear the inexistent heat.

She seemed to stand only by the crutch of her hand on the door, a tangle of veins worming along her forearm.

"I'm coming in," I announced, and gently pushed past her into the dark house.

Almost at once Jordan twisted aside and pelted upstairs to the bathroom, the lumbering speed of the action throwing me off balance.

I went after her, thinking to offer her some comfort, and to coax her into seeking medical aid at last.

I found Jordan crouched over the toilet bowl, her nightgown slick to her form like fruit peel with nauseous sweat. Her jaws strained open in dry retching motions, her form undulating in the tide of her struggle until it scarcely seemed a thing with joints and more an amorphous suggestion drawn from the dreams of a woman afraid of the change in her.

“Jesus,” I said, faintly. “Let me get you some water.”

Surely now she couldn’t deny my suspicions that it was our child that had made her so ill, I thought. Yet the longer she poured, choking, over the porcelain gripped between her knotted hands the greater heights to which my nervous doubts crept up like sun thrown shadows.

“Jordan,” I said, reaching out to touch the ridge of her shoulder. “Tell me what to do. Do you need an ambulance?”

At this she wrenched her arm from under my grip, and her strength even in illness amazed me, as did the snarling depth of her voice as she answered.

“No. Go home, Ryan. Go home.”

There was a strange quality to her words,  a rolling timbre as though distorted by the effects of some machine.

Drawing back my hand from her I was appalled to see blood on my palm and upon her shoulder where I’d touched it. At the neck of Jordan’s nightdress something odd had affected the skin: it had gathered together, splitting open in a glistening aperture through which I glimpsed a surface that was not muscle.

Shouting, I tumbled sideways into the sink, streaking the basin with ropes of dark blood.

Jordan’s face was hidden in a cave of damp hair; only when she threw back her head in a yell of agony did I see her face had shifted, both jaws sliding out of her skull like some spontaneous dental malformation. Her eyes, molten with pressure, rolled from the knife cuts of narrowed eye sockets into the basin of water below.

I watched in stillness under terror’s curse, so close that I felt the humidity of Jordan’s wounds upon my face, smelled blood and the reek of dank animal fur, that which I had seen through the slit in her skin. Her teeth dropped like shattered icicles into the toilet, new pikes of bone pushed down through the cavities of her gums in their place. 

Eyes yellow and blind with pain arose in place of the old, and as Jordan raised one hand to clutch at her face I saw the knuckles bent in two, nails coiled in vicious crescents of black enamel.

Jordan stood shaking and groaning on her hind legs, the rag of her nightdress torn off in the vehemence of her change, and still I could not move, though I knew now why she had kept so many animals, and why once a month I was driven away.

“Go,” said Jordan again, and the command had many syllables, language forced through the throat of a beast.

Whether she would have retained her speech or human faculties much longer after that I’ll never know. Pushing off from the sink I vaulted out of the room and ran through the house, aware with every step of Jordan staggering after me in chase.

Only by the time I’d reached the hallway and gotten open the front door was she on all fours as she clearly yearned to be.

My last glimpse of Jordan was of a tortured lunatic abomination, human enough even beneath the hair and the crossed swords of teeth that she appeared as what she was: a woman forced to kneel by the disfiguring strength of her moon borne disease.

I spent the remainder of the night in a horror-struck delirium, tossing about so furiously in my bed that there were times I thought she must have caught me with some light scratch I’d been too drowned by my adrenaline to notice, and that I too would change.

As it was I recovered by morning, having in my fever accepted what I’d seen, even if I had no understanding of it.

I remembered that Jordan had driven me out, had saved me from my own stupidity in that curious trespass on her night alone, and knew that I still loved her, though she would have killed or turned me in the end.

So I went out to look for her, knocking upon her front door at the height of day when I knew it was safe.

I heard her shift about in the house, but for all that I called and pleaded for her to answer she refused to open the door.

Possessing no key to the house I had no way in except by force, which I knew better than to attempt.

I did, however, stand at the window of the menagerie room to squint through a gap in the curtains, drawn despite myself by the question of what had become of the inhabitants. 

The cage doors stood open, each warped by force into shapes like weird alien skeletons.

Across the floor lay a rug of drying blood, the heads of animals and tangled viscera part submerged and stamped by the green-black stones of flies like ropes of filthy jewels.

As I stared upon that death room my eyes became accustomed to its dingy light, and identified from the assorted matter that at least one of the creatures housed there had been human. 

I jumped away from the window as though hauled back by a cord at the base of my spine and retreated to the other side of the street, aware even as I did so of something shifting behind the windows of my lover’s house. 

What it thought as it watched me waver, heaving into a gutter I do not know. I only knew that it had loved me alone enough to spare me from the starving curse of moonlight or the cage.
