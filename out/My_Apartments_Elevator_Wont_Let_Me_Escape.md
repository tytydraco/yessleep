I’m writing this to prove I existed. To document my journey and the horrors I’ve witnessed. If someone reads this, maybe it’ll mean I was real. My name is \*\*\*\*\*\*. I live in \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*. Or at least, I did. I don’t know anymore. Maybe I’m dead. Maybe not. I can’t tell how long I’ve been here—days, weeks, longer? Time’s twisted here. It doesn’t behave.

I’m not the type to be noticed. I’m the kind of person who can disappear for months without anyone truly wondering where I went. I have friends—real ones. Ones who care. Ones who keep trying to drag me back out into the world. But I don’t like the world. I like my apartment. My bubble. It’s safe. It’s quiet. It doesn’t judge me.

I close my curtains and pretend the city outside doesn’t exist. I keep the lights off and the blinds sealed tight. My whole life is inside these walls: sleep, eat, work online, play games alone, repeat. That cycle became my heartbeat. In here, time didn’t move forward. It just looped—days blurring together like brushstrokes smeared across the same gray canvas. Loneliness used to hurt, but eventually, it became a comfort. At least when you’re alone, no one expects anything from you.

Until one day, my walls cracked.

My friends had been pushing harder than usual. Maybe they sensed something. Maybe they saw through the persona I wear when I occasionally answer their texts. I must’ve let my defenses down for a moment, because I said yes. A week from now. Dinner. One night. Just a short trip out of isolation. I regretted it immediately.

That entire week dragged like the countdown to an execution. I barely slept. My chest stayed tight. I kept procrastinating, kept telling myself I’d cancel—I’d fake an illness. My imagination ran wild trying to craft believable excuses. But none of them left my mouth.

Because I’m an agoraphobic, socially awkward shut-in—not an asshole. I stick to my word. Even if it kills me.

The day arrived before I knew it. My phone lit up with excited messages. My stomach churned like it was full of broken glass. I stepped into the shower for the first time in what felt like forever. My greasy hair resisted the shampoo like it was protesting. I changed out of my pajama pants—loyal sentinels of comfort—and dressed like someone who belonged in public.

Every step toward the front door felt unnatural. Like gravity was defying me. I grabbed my phone, my keys, and stared at the doorknob like it might bite. When I finally opened it, the hallway beyond felt alien—overlit and too quiet. Only three other people stood out there, yet I felt exposed, as if their eyes pierced straight through me.

I avoided eye contact and made a slow, awkward shuffle to the elevator. Every part of me screamed to turn around, lock the door, disappear. But I didn’t. I pressed the button.

The elevator opened like it had been waiting to swallow me whole. I stepped inside, still trembling. The panel stared back—bland and metallic. I hit the lobby button. The doors closed.

I watched my reflection in the brushed steel. I looked like a ghost. My hands shook. My eyes were sunken. I felt like a fraud—a walking failure trying to pretend he could just slip back into society.

My breathing grew shallow. The descent was slow. A little too slow, stretched like molasses.

Then everything changed.

A violent jolt shook the elevator. The lights flickered—rapidly strobing like lightning trapped in the walls. The shaking intensified, like the elevator was resisting gravity. I stumbled, grasped for the emergency button—but it wasn’t there. Or rather, it was translucent. Unreal. Like a desert mirage pretending to be solid.

Only one button remained. Glossy. Unlabeled. It practically pulsed under the dim light. I didn’t want to touch it—but I had no other choice. I pressed it.

Instantly, the shaking stopped. The lights snapped off, plunging me into suffocating darkness. Silence wrapped around me—thicker than air. I slumped to the floor.

Then, the lights came back—soft, strange, dimmer than before. And the elevator began descending again. Smooth. Silent. Unnatural.

I tried to collect myself. Rubbed my eyes. Leaned back. At some point, I must’ve passed out.

When I woke up—nothing had changed.

Still in the elevator. *Still going down*.

My phone was gone. As if the elevator didn’t *want* me to have it.

The panel had changed again. No longer hazy or flickering—it looked solid now. But still one button. Still no label.

And I realized, with a sinking horror, that I no longer had even the tiniest bit of control I had before. Wherever I was going—it wasn’t the lobby. It wasn’t back to my apartment. It wasn’t anywhere I recognized.

The elevator was taking me somewhere else.

The elevator slowed, then stopped. No ding. No announcement. Just a soft metallic groan, like something exhaling through the cracks in reality. The doors parted.

Beyond them wasn’t a lobby.

It was a wasteland.

The air glistened with a sickly haze that bent light in unnatural ways, warping the horizon like a wave. A scorched sky hung overhead, low and oppressive, painted in shades of nuclear dusk—deep amber bleeding into toxic moss. The ground was fractured, veined with glowing fissures that pulsed rhythmically, like the earth itself was living. I had to make a decision.

After what felt like an eternity, I stepped out, against every instinct I had. The elevator didn’t wait. It closed behind me and vanished. Like it had never been there at all.

The silence was violent. No birds. No wind. No signs of life. But somehow, I felt watched—like the land itself had eyes, buried somewhere under the cracked soil.

My footsteps crunched over glassy fragments of something that might’ve once been buildings. Metallic skeletons jutted from the ground, twisted beyond recognition. I passed what looked like a melted swing set half-buried in ash. A child’s toy sat nearby, half-disintegrated, staring at me with hollow eyes that made me look away.

I tried calling out, just to hear something besides the hum of the atmosphere. My voice came out strange—muted, swallowed instantly, like the place didn’t want sound.

Then I heard it.

A groan. A massive, heavy exhale from something far off in the distance. Something alive. The sound rolled across the wasteland like thunder. I dropped to the ground and waited.

Far across the glowing ravine, a shadow moved.

It was big—no, enormous. Something primal and wrong. Its outline shimmered as if reality couldn’t decide what shape it should be. It had legs, maybe. Or arms. Or too many of both. I couldn’t tell if it was walking or dragging itself, but every time it moved, the ground beneath it recoiled. I felt it in my bones.

I wanted to crawl into the fetal position and disappear. But staying meant being found. And I didn’t want to know what happens when it finds someone.

I scrambled behind a chunk of rebar, my breath hitching. My throat felt scorched just from being in the air. I scanned for shelter—or anything resembling a way out.

That’s when I saw it.

In the distance—a metal structure. Boxy. Familiar. Another elevator.

It stood out like a relic from my world, surrounded by twisted terrain like an island of normalcy in a sea of decay. But it was far. Too far. Despite only being a silhouette in the distance, I felt its gaze from a mile away.

I don’t know how long I waited. Time didn’t feel real. But eventually, it turned. It moved in another direction—slow and moaning, like it had somewhere to be. Or maybe it didn’t care anymore.

I ran.

Every step felt like it weighed a hundred pounds. The air tasted metallic. The land shifted beneath me, like it was trying to make me trip. But I reached the elevator.

It was just standing there. No walls. No enclosure. Just the doors and the panel.

It opened before I pressed anything. I stepped inside. No hesitation. The doors closed and it began to move.

Nothing had changed. But everything felt different.

The elevator no longer hummed. It listened.

I stayed standing at first—rigid and alert, like prey that hadn’t yet been spotted. The fluorescent light above blinked intermittently—long pauses, brief flickers. Its rhythm broken, like a metronome set to an irregular heartbeat.

The tension stretched, rubbery and thin. I sat down.

The carpet was coarse. Cheap. Synthetic fibers pressed into my palms as I lowered myself. The air inside the elevator was thick—bordering on hostile—like the pressure in an airplane just before something goes wrong.

I gasped. Not from panic—something deeper. Like I’d been holding my breath for years without noticing. Like oxygen had been rationed in this place, and now I was stealing it back. My chest rose. Fell. Rose. Fell. Nothing else moved.

I lost track of time again. It wasn’t hours or minutes. It was something different. Something more ancient. I sat there in that suspended moment, breathing as if relearning how.

The silence had shape now— filling corners, creeping across surfaces, folding around my body like weighted fabric.

Then—ding. Not loud. Not cheerful. Just inevitable.

The doors parted.

And he entered. Slowly. As if gravity worked differently for him. Each step was surgically placed—heel, then toe—with no sound. A silhouette made of wrong angles and soft suggestions of humanity— a suit filled not by flesh, but by the memory of it.

His face wasn’t blank. It was unfinished. Wet clay, smoothed over where features should’ve formed. All but the eyes. Round. Bulging. Fixed ahead like spotlights in a fog.

He didn’t acknowledge me. Not even with a twitch. He took his place near the doors and stood with the posture of someone used to being ignored. Limp arms. A tilt of the head that spoke of habit, not awareness.

The doors closed. We descended.

The space shrank— not physically, but spiritually.

The silence grew legs and crawled up the walls, settling into my ears like parasites. I didn’t dare shift. Even the sound of blinking felt like a scream.

My throat burned with restraint— lungs aching not from lack of air, but the effort it took to remain invisible.

A scent crept in. Dust. Sweat. Old paper. Like a forgotten file cabinet forced open in the dark. It wasn’t a smell— it was a memory leaking from the vents.

Then—ding.

He moved. Not urgently. Not eagerly. Just necessarily.

The doors opened to a hallway.

A hallway that knew shame. Muted colors. Carpets in sepia tones. Fluorescent strips set into the ceiling— sputtering in sequence like Morse code tapping out past mistakes.

Doors lined each side. Wooden. Identical. Almost closed—but not quite. Each one inviting—yet hostile.

He stepped out. The elevator didn’t wait. But I watched.

Inside those barely-ajar doorways came noises. Not words. No language. Just reactions.

Emotion sculpted into sound— a gasp at the wrong moment. A laugh that wasn’t meant for you. The shrill pitch of someone pretending not to notice you. A whisper meant to be overheard.

Figures emerged, clothed in various attire— business outfits, party dresses, school uniforms. They drifted around him— orbiting, talking, living.

But never seeing him. Not really.

He remained still in the center of their world— unmoving, unmoved. A relic. A placeholder for someone more acceptable. More social. More “normal.”

Their conversations passed through him like smoke. Their joy ignored his presence like it was background noise.

Just before the doors slid shut, he turned. Not fully. Just enough to make eye contact. Enough to be known.

And then he was gone.

The elevator was mine again. But emptier. Somehow.

I stayed in the elevator. Not that I had a choice.

It didn’t move at first. It just sat in place, humming softly like a machine remembering its purpose.

I felt the shift only in my knees. A slow downward drift. The lights above buzzed. Then dimmed. I was alone again. But the kind of alone that feels rehearsed.

The kind that’s expected.

Minutes passed. Maybe hours. Time remained blurred, folded, lost itself in the seams of the walls.

Then the doors opened once again.

No announcement. No fanfare. No welcome.

Just cold.

The doors opened without ceremony. The room was dim. Hundreds of monitors, stacked like bricks in a mausoleum. Each blinked with life, and yet none acknowledged my arrival. No cameras. No lens. Just observation.

I stepped in. The air tasted stale—like the closed off wing of an office. Soft mechanical hums filled the silence like breath through walls.

A few screens displayed comfortingly mundane scenes:

A parking lot at dusk. One flickering streetlight. A woman sat in her car, unmoving, as if waiting for an unseen signal.

A diner booth with cracked vinyl seating. Someone scribbled in a journal. The waitress passed back and forth, never making eye contact.

A library desk where a child tried—and failed—to whisper. No adults nearby. Just rows of books, and one spine on the shelf seemed to pulse.

I moved past them.

Others displayed environments all too familiar:

The Clay Man’s room, seen from a higher angle. He stood exactly where I left him, surrounded by the same fancifully clothed figures. This time, he was facing the camera, as if sensing me through the screen. His motions stuttered and looped.

The Wasteland, cloaked in the same radioactive green fog. The sky opened inward, not upward, revealing columns of cities hung like chandeliers from the void. That same colossal figure dragged itself along the horizon, brushing its limbs against forgotten relics buried in fractured dirt

And farther still, the monitors deepened into madness:

A stairwell spiraling into flesh. Each step groaned—wet, living. At the bottom, A mouth whispered inaudible mutterings, as if spreading a secret I wasn't meant to hear..

A lake, perfectly still, reflecting constellations not known to this world. Something below the water exhaled, and stars rose out one by one.

A parade of beings—wrong in proportion, shifting between dimensions—marched silently down a corridor of clocks, all running backward. Time buckled around them. Their shadows refused to follow.

I didn’t try to count the monitors. There were hundreds. Maybe more.

Each showed a different scene. incomprehensible environments dancing across countless monitors.

Yet only one mattered.

Low and tucked behind a nest of tangled cables—barely visible—was the smallest monitor. It showed the elevator.

Doors open. Empty. Flickering gently, like the eye of a beast pretending to sleep. Waiting for me to return. Or watching to see if I ever would.

At the heart of the room sat a desk. Wooden and weathered. The kind that belonged in a forgotten office abandoned by time.

On the desk: a candle, half-melted. Piles of paperwork with symbols I couldn’t dream of understanding. And right at the center—

My phone.

Just as I remembered it. Same smudged screen. Same lock screen photo.

I grabbed it before thinking. Of course I tried calling for help.

No calls connected. Every number I tried—family, friends, even emergency services—was met with the same thing. A soft beep, then nothing. Like the signal was reaching something else entirely.

Most software refused to open. Emails, texts, every browser I tried—all dead. Pages blinked, crashed. Locked me out.

Only a few sites still respond.

This is one of them.

I can’t explain why it works. I’ve stopped trying to. All I know is that this is one of the only places still listening.

So I’m writing—less out of hope, more out of necessity. To pin memories down before they dissolve. To remember. To be remembered.

If you’re reading this, maybe it means I haven’t disappeared entirely. Maybe I’ll return to the elevator. Maybe I won’t. I’m no longer convinced it matters either way.

But for now, the silence has a witness. And that will have to be enough.
