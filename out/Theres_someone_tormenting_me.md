I have a routine that I do every day, I wake up, do my chores, go for a walk, and come home, but about a month ago, whenever I go out, out of the corner of my eye, I see what appears to be a person behind me, but when I turn around, there's nothing, and this has been happening both on the street and at home, and lately it's been getting worse, three days ago I woke up at dawn to go drink water, and at the end of the corridor that leads to the stairs I saw a silhouette, it was tall, and all black, and it seemed to stare into the depths of my soul, the lights started to go on and off madly, and several laughs began to echo from every possible corner, until everything simply stopped, the house, once again, was dark, and I could hear a glass falling and breaking down in the kitchen.

I just went down, trying to stay calm, it was totally dark, and I stepped on something sharp, it was one of the several pieces of the glass scattered across the floor, and further on, my cell phone... But... He was with me. I took it as quickly as possible, and turned on the flashlight, at the bathroom door, on the other side of the kitchen, a person running and entering the bathroom... He was running in a strange way.

I ran to my room as quickly as possible and locked myself, sitting on the bed with the light on, desperately trying to call several family numbers, and in the end, I called the police, they asked what was happening, I just replied "there's someone at my house", the voice on the other side told me to remain calm, that there were already police officers coming to my address, until that about three minutes after starting the call, the lights go out, I get up quickly and go to the switch, but it doesn't come on, and I receive a photo on my cell phone... It was a photo of me, standing in front of the switch, looking at my cell phone, the lights came back out of nowhere, I turned around, and nothing... There was no one, and where were the police, who were supposed to have arrived?

I ran out of my room and locked myself in a bathroom, which could hardly fit more than one person in there, and a noise began, very far away and low, of something dragging on the floor, but each time it was getting louder, that is... It was coming towards me. Until the noise stopped, I was calming down when, the sound of the front door slamming with unimaginable force and causing it to break, it made me scream, and again the noise stopped.

This time he didn't come back, I slowly unlocked the bathroom door and opened it, the front door, which led to the basement, was completely shattered, I tiptoed down, trying to do as little as possible noise, everything was dark, and I went to the middle of the basement, until I received a photo on my cell phone... It was a face, totally pale, with blood running from his eyes, and a smile with huge teeth, I turned around very quickly, with the flashlight on, but there was nothing, absolutely nothing, I ran upstairs again and went to the living room, where candles formed a circle on the coffee table, which went out instantly after I entered the room.

I couldn't take it anymore, I ran out into the street, but when I came out... There was no light. Everything was dark, there was no light from streetlights, houses, or stars, It was like being on a film set, and there wasn't a single noise, you couldn't see anything, nothing at all.

Until I receive another photo, of the same face, pale, with bloody eyes and a strange smile, but who was behind him... It was me, looking at the photo he himself had sent.
