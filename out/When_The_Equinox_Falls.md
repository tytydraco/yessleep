Deep in the mountains of Georgia is a remote town called Dead Leaf Falls. You won't find it on any map, except Google Earth, if you happen to come across it at just the right time of day. Even if you knew exactly where this town is and went over to it, you would find nothing except trees for miles. How do I know it exists? The answer is simple.





It's where I was born and spent the first twelve years of my life. If you happen across it while on a road trip, you may think it a nice little place, quiet, lots of scenery, and a community so self-sustaining the idea of outside contact is laughable. The issue is that this comes at a price.





“Tommy! Psst, Tommy!”





Groggily, I lifted my head up from my desk to find my best friend, Amanda shaking my shoulder. Our math teacher was explaining some word problems. I wasn't paying attention, being focused on Amanda and wiping the drool off my face.





“What?” I snap back, louder than I intended.



“Mr. Ballard, were you sleeping again?” our teacher asked.



“No, Mrs. Hooper,” I answered, suppressing a yawn.





Her narrowed eyes studied me for a moment before she returned her attention to the board. When she did, Amanda immediately picked up where we left off as if we hadn't been interrupted.





“So you know the Equinox is coming up, right?”



“What about it?”



Leaning into my ear she told me, “I think we should get a picture of the Fall Fairy.”





Mrs. Hooper dumping a cup of ice water in my head wouldn't have made the tiredness leave my body faster than those words did.  Amanda had the foresight to put a finger to my lips before I could have another outburst. She glanced at Mrs. Hooper who was watching another kid in our class trying to solve a problem on the board. Amanda lowered her finger.





“Are you crazy?” I asked her.





The Fall Fairy was the local legend. Here's how it went. In the forest outside of town, lies a cave that only appears during the equinox.  That's its home. On the first day of Fall, it comes out to play. 





Everyone says it's friendly which is why we always found it strange that everyone stays inside during this time. I never thought to question it. Any excuse to be up in my room rotting my mind with movies and video games was always welcome. Amanda, though, was different, more adventurous and curious. She was a social butterfly with plenty of friends. 





Contrastingly, I could count the number of kids I regularly interacted with on one hand. Some may say I was antisocial. While I don't disagree, I think it's more that I simply wasn't a social seeker. I didn't shun people who tried talking with me, but I never struck up conversations. Hell, I hardly raised my hand in class unless it was to be excused.





 To this day, I'll never understand what quality I had that made her want to spend so much time with me. Before you make assumptions regarding “young love”, let me assure you that our dynamic was entirely plutonic. In fact, if nobody in town knew us we could’ve been mistaken for siblings. 





“So what if I am crazy?” she scoffed. “It's better than being a wuss. Anyway, I already got it all planned out.”





She explained that she had nabbed her dad's camera and wanted us to sneak out and search for the cave. There was an excited glint in her gaze that was at odds with the “bad idea” feeling I was currently experiencing.





“Amanda, I don't mean to dash your hopes, but how would we even begin to find this thing? All the stories just say that it's in the forest. That's not a lot to go on.”





She grinned, indicating that she'd been expecting this sort of response. She unzipped her backpack, pulling out what looked to be an old journal.





“This belonged to one of the settlers.”



“Where did you get that?”



“I found it in the attic. My parents were making me clean it.”



“Wait, so it belonged to someone in your family?”





She smiled, nodding.





“That's right. Isn't it exciting?”





I looked at the journal again, the leather worn from age and cracking in several places.





“Have you already read that?”



“Someone bookmarked a page. I only read that part. Why? Do you want to borrow it?”



“No, that wouldn't be fair to you.”



“It's fine. I already got what I wanted to know out of it.”





She dropped the book into my lap. The rest of our school day was uneventful only being punctuated by the occasional remark from Amanda when our teachers weren't paying attention. We lived in the same neighborhood and on the bus ride home, she caught me up on the latest gossip, having overheard her mom talking with her dad about it.





“You know Mr. Turner?”



“Kind of, he lives across the street from you, right?”



“Yeah, anyway, his wife caught him kissing another woman and kicked him out.”



“That's pretty crazy.”



“That's not the crazy part. You'll never guess who he was with.”



“Shoot.”



“Mrs. Hooper.”





I thought about how irritable she'd been the last few days.





“That explains a lot.”



“It sure does. Then Mr. Hooper ran into Mr. Turner at the store and they got into a big fight. It was bad. They had to get the cops involved. One of them got a black eye and the other had to get stitches.”





As I was making a mental note to stay off the Hooper and Turners' radar for a while, the bus brakes were screeching as we came to our stop. We and some other kids got off.





“Remember, the Equinox,” Amanda said.





I nodded, then she was yelling for her friends to wait up while jogging after them. I watched her mingle with them before turning around and walking to my house. When I got home, my parents greeted me with the usual questions, “how was school?”, “Have you been talking with anyone new?”,  that sort of thing. Dinner that night consisted of pumpkin chili and apple nut muffins for dessert. It was common for people in our town to have seasonal foods in the days leading up to Autumn.





“Hey,” I spoke up, prompting my parents to look at me, “I was wondering something about the Fall Shut-in.”



“What about it?” my dad replied, returning to his book.



“Has anyone actually seen The Fall Fairy?”





I may as well have questioned the existence of the sky with the way my parents were staring at me then.





“Of course, people have seen it, that's why we stay inside,” my mom answered.



“What does it look like then?”





My dad slammed his book shut. Growing up, he was an intimidating man. He never beat me or anything. It's just that he carried himself in a very authoritative manner. When he spoke, there was always a finality to his voice to let me know he was entirely in control of the conversation.







“You've never cared about this before,” he said. “Why the sudden change?”



“I heard someone at school talking about it and got curious.”





That was technically true. 





“Well, that's why you shouldn't eavesdrop,” my mom told me. “We thought you would have learned that by now.”





This was coming from one of the biggest gossipers in town. I decided to drop the topic and finish eating my food. My dad talked with my mom about seeing if he could squeeze in a hunting trip with his buddies the day before the shut-in. Meanwhile, my mom was going shopping with one of her friends. Our town was behind the times in terms of technology so cell phones or the internet weren't a thing for us. 





With my parents out of the house, it was going to be me by myself which is something I have gotten used to. Reading was a big part of my childhood. It was always fascinating to catch these little glimpses into the outside world even if the stories were out of date. I spent that night and the day before the Equinox pouring through the journal. Part of me is glad I read it before her.





There were passages in it that would have made her ashamed of her family name. The short of it is, the natives (Likely Cherokee based on the region. Though, the journal never specifies) lived here before our ancestors settled and well, the transition of ownership wasn't peaceful. There was a name mentioned in one of those harrowing passages that was familiar to me. Going through my stuff, I realized it was the same as someone on a family tree project I did for school. That means someone I’m related to assisted in that slaughter.





As if I wasn't already dealing with enough. I thought about bringing this up to my parents. However, I knew they would deny it. Everything had to be perfect.  I'm not bringing this up to alleviate familial guilt, by the way.





I do it because of the subtext present in those pages our ancestors chose to ignore. When our ancestors first invaded the land that would become Dead Leaf Falls, they noted how strangely the natives acted in response. They said of them it was like they were fighting to try and warn them away. I wish I could be surprised. If there's one thing people in our town were good at, it was ignoring problems staring them in the face.





There are only two passages I can share verbatim due to them having been burned into my mind. The first is below.





We have finally managed to clear out the last of these savages. Now we can utilize this land as our Lord intended. I know in my heart this was right and yet I am troubled. We looked into the eyes of our enemies in their final moments and saw no resentment, only relief.







The second was written months later.







We were blind.







That's where the journal ends. I wanted to tell Amanda, but she was so excited for our trip. I didn't want to deter her. There was something else I could do to ease my worry. My dad kept a gun cabinet in his trophy room. 







He never kept it locked because I never had any interest in weapons up to that point. The night Amanda and I met up, I snuck inside and swiped his revolver. He'd shown me how to use it when he decided to take me on one of his hunting expeditions. Once I had the gun, I tucked it away and then snuck out of the house. Amanda was waiting outside of the neighborhood.





I could see her holding a flashlight and a camera hanging around her neck.





“What took you so long? I've been here forever!”



“I had to get something.”



“You got your flashlight too?”



“Yeah.”



“Good, follow me.”





Going through town was eerie. We figured there would at least be some patrol cars to make sure the shit in was being abided. There was nothing which only deepened the apprehension running through me. Any Amanda might have been feeling was overridden by her enthusiasm.





“The journal said the cave should be past the library, right?” I asked.



“That's right. By the way, what did it say about my family?”



“Just a bunch of dull stuff, mostly about fishing and hunting.”







According to the passage, the way to the Fall Fairy's cave would be past a special tree with the appearance of having a sleeping face carved into it. When the path opened, the tree was supposed to change, showing someone surprised. The library was built near it and I wonder if it was built with the tree in mind. 







“I guessed it would be something like that,” Amanda said. “Why do adults have to be so boring? Then they want to put all these rules on us and take the fun out of everything!”







I was silent as she continued talking while we were walking. As I said, I'll never understand what she saw in me. Looking back, I was a terrible friend. I hardly ever contributed to any conversation we were having. All I did was listen.





“I see the library,” Amanda exclaimed, shining her flashlight on it.





She suddenly sprinted, causing me to race after her.  We went past the library where at last, we came to a stop.





“How about a heads up next time?” I asked, catching my breath.



“Tommy, you aren't going to believe this.”





Amanda had the expression of a toddler seeing Santa at the mall for the first time. Seeing that I was confused, she stepped aside, revealing the tree and the eyes in the face were open. 





“Neither of us have seen it at night. For all we know, this is a trick of the light.”





Not even I believed what I was saying. Amanda gave me a smug grin.





“I'm right and you know it,” she told me, touching her finger to my nose.





Annoyed, I brushed her hand away, then we headed into the forest. It didn't take us long to find the path. The mica in it sparkled under the moonlight almost as if it was inviting us. I racked my brain for any logical explanation. Maybe I just hadn't noticed the path before.





 That was stupid. I'd been in and around the library at least a hundred times and I'd messed around in the forest behind it. There's no way I would have overlooked something so obvious. 





“Amanda.”



“What is it?”



“What if the Fall Fairy doesn't want to be bothered? I mean, something about this isn't sitting right with me.”



“Quit worrying. Fairies are friendly like in those old picture books.”







I touched the bulge of the revolver handle under my hoodie.





“Look at that,” Amanda said, pointing upward.





The stars were twinkling.





“Isn't it pretty?”



“Sure, I guess.”





The more I stared at the stars, the more I got the sense they weren't twinkling but blinking. I wasn't paying attention and walked into Amanda.





“Hey, watch it!”



“Sorry, why'd we stop?”





I looked past her, seeing the reason. It was the cave of the Fall Fairy. The entrance reminded me of the mouth of a jack-o-lantern. 





“I don't believe it,” I said.



“And we're going to be the first ones to get a picture of the Fall Fairy so get your flashlight ready.”



“Wait, how long are we going to wait for it to come out? We can't be out here all-”





Picking up a rock, Amanda chucked it, hitting the cave. No sooner than she had did we hear a distinct chirping noise. Think something between a cicada and a cricket. I kept my flashlight steady.





“I think I hear it coming,” Amanda said excitedly. “I bet it's-”





She was likely going to say something along the lines of pretty. The arm of it disproved this assumption and made all other animals go quiet. It was slender to the point of appearing mummified. Then its head came next. It hurts to think about, even all these years later. 





It was bald with a thin mouth and covered in eyes that were constantly changing position on its head. A pair of insect wings were protruding from its back. We took all this in within a few seconds. Instinctively, I cut off my flashlight. Amanda did the same. 





Any trace of wonder in her eyes was replaced with terror. Raising a shaking finger to my lips, I gestured for us to slowly back away. As we were attempting this, the Fall Fairy stepped out into the open. Even under the limited light of the moon, it was apparent how disproportionate that thing's body was.





 Its limbs contained multiple joints. The way it moved was like a gorilla. It stopped, sniffing the air.





“No, oh no,” I thought, trying to control my breathing.





Its head whipped in our direction. The next thing we knew it was rushing at us. All logic left me. The gun may as well have been on another planet. Although, it wouldn't have done any good against that creature anyway. 





It was fast. I cried out in pain, feeling a burning sensation as its hand wrapped around my ankle, yanking me upside down.  I was face to face with it, all sound escaping me as I met its glare. I thought I was done for. However, its eyes were studying me and in them, I could see what I can only describe as the kind of anger someone has when something isn't what they wanted.







 It tossed me away. I landed on my side, not the one with the revolver thankfully. Getting back up, my hair rose to hear Amanda shrieking.  That monster had her and was dragging her in its cave. She was screaming, digging her nails into the ground. 





Some of them were breaking off. I was about to try and help when I was grabbed. My mouth was covered and all I could do was watch as my friend was pulled in. There was a shriek followed by snapping bone and blood spattering just outside the entrance. A numbing sensation overtook me. I glanced up to find my father looking down at me. He loosened his grip and I moved away. With him were people I knew including my mom, the Hoopers, The Turners, and Amanda's parents.





“Dad, there's a thing here,” I stuttered. “It took Amanda! We need to-”







He put up a hand to cut me off. His voice was disturbingly steady. It wasn't like he was trying to keep from panicking. No, he had the tone of someone who had been through this a dozen times.





“Let us explain.”







That's when I learned everything. The thing we called the Fall Fairy has lived in those lands far longer than even the apes that would evolve into humans. The natives had a name for it. Roughly translated it means, “The thing that crunches like the leaves”. Speaking of the natives, they were the first to encounter it. 





They made a deal that as long as it didn't attack them and blessed their harvest, it could select one person from their tribe to be an offering every one hundred years. The way it would do this is by sending out an orange and black colored beetle. Whosoever home it landed in would have to pick one of their children to be sacrificed. While not ideal, this arrangement was stable for several millennia. Then our ancestors had to fuck everything up.





 Long story short, The Fall Fairy was furious, and a new bargain was crafted. The offerings would continue except they would occur more frequently, now being every twenty-two years. The beetle came to Amanda's parents before she was even born. They planted the journal in the attic for her to find. I couldn't believe what they were saying. 





“You raised your daughter just to be food for that thing?” I yelled.





All the times Amanda told me about how they'd always seemed detached from her were making sense.





“We have to serve it,” her dad said.



“It's for the good of Dead Leaf,” her mom added.



“The sacrifice was supposed to happen without any issues. Amanda was a curious girl after all,” my dad told me. “What we didn't expect was for you to be with her.”



“Kids don't normally learn the truth until they're older,” my mom said. “It's over now. Let's all head back home.”





I backed away.





“Fuck that,” I spat. “I'm getting away from here.





My parents were amused at this outburst.





“You think you know anything about how shit works?” my dad asked. “You don't because you're a kid. We’re adults and that's why we get to make the decisions.”





He signaled. He and my mom stood by as several people moved to grab me. That's when instinct took over again. It wasn't only the idea of living near that demon. It was having to live with these people.





The second thing they hadn't expected was for me to pull out my dad's revolver. Their eyes went wide as I blindly fired. I got Amanda's parents, her mom in the foot and I think her dad somewhere between the collarbone and shoulder. I was about to shoot again when my dad lunged. We wrestled for it briefly and it went off again. Of course, there was no way I was winning that struggle and he took it away.





“You know, I normally don't believe in corporal punishment, but…”





His eyes flashed with anger and he backhanded me with the hand holding the gun. I was sent reeling and gasped as my back hit a tree, causing me to slide to the ground. Then my dad was lifting me by the front of my hoodie. I could only glare, fighting back tears. 





“Here's what's going to happen,” he said. 





Whatever he was going to say was cut off by a distressed chirping noise. We turned to the cave, seeing the Fall Fairy emerge from it once more. Everyone, even my dad, was shocked, which means this wasn't normal behavior for it. Then we saw why. In its forehead, was a circular wound. 





Its sight fell on the revolver in my dad's hand. Then it let out a low growling as the bullet in its head fell out, the injury sealing itself. That was the first and last time I would see my dad afraid. He tried firing in a panic and was slaughtered right beside me, covering me in his blood. My mom shrieked and was next.





 I didn't wait around. I randomly picked a direction and ran. Unfortunately, it also deemed me a target and wasn't keen on letting prey escape. I don't know how long that chase lasted, only minutes in all likelihood. It felt longer.





During it,  I tripped, twisting my ankle. Yet, I was too hopped up on adrenaline to notice. I scrambled up and kept going. Its pursuit didn't end so much as stop. I didn't even realize I had wandered into the middle of a road until someone's beams fell on me and they were slamming on their brakes. The driver got out, slamming their door, and was starting to lambast me until they could see the blood covering my body from head to toe.





I was taken to a nearby police station. Even at that age, I knew my story was far-fetched so I kept silent during their questioning. They chalked it up to trauma and decided I witnessed an animal attack. I spent the next few years bouncing between foster homes. That was a special kind of hell I don't even want to begin describing right now. 





I mean, I can't blame the people I lived with entirely. There's not a [therapist](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/q0z96s/i_found_out_why_im_afraid_of_moths/) in the world equipped to deal with what I did, especially as a child. When I was old enough I joined boot camp and ended up with a decent military career. At the very least it gave some stability and I even got some buddies out of it I still keep in touch with. For them, I am grateful.





Nothing left to say then, right? Not quite. The Fall Fairy left me with a hand-shaped scar where it grabbed my ankle. You'd think it was simply a birthmark if you didn't know the context. The thing is every time Autumn arrives it starts getting hot. Every year, the heat gets more severe. Ice can only help so much.





I know it's calling me back. I've researched what it is over the years. The Fairy part of its name makes it seem like a no-brainer I know, but I don't know if it can be put into the fae category. Whatever it is, I've stocked up on several special kinds of ammo I've managed to get from all over. If I'm lucky, one of them will do the job.







I'm currently on a road trip and am posting this from my hotel room. It's been a long drive. The Equinox is tomorrow and I'm feeling[ a](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) little [homesick.](https://www.threads.net/@rose_black2222)
