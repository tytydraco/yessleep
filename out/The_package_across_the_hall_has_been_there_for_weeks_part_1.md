When I moved into my apartment complex, I really thought I had found a perfect place to shack up while I tried to get my life back on track.  The rent was affordable, the location wasn’t great but close enough to my job, and the building seemed to be well maintained for how old it looked. Before long though, I began to notice that things were off about this place. It was subtle, borderline unnoticeable at first. What felt unnerving to me was the people…

I never saw any of them. All of the other residents seemed to be as recluse as I was. There had to have been many patrons of this complex as there were cars lined up in every spot on the lot. However from the day I moved in till the time I wrote all of this down, I had only seen one other person inside the confines of this residency. I had been here for quite a few months too. I think all of my initial back and forth from work and the hours I had to leave then return were enough to blind me from this odd reality. 

It wasn't until my job at the telemarketing agency offered me a hybrid schedule that I began to notice.
Corporate wanted to create a home/work balance as a part of their new mission to ”boost workplace morale.” Honestly I saw this as a win. A new state of the art desktop setup was delivered to me to complete my work and the best catch was if I worked long enough with the company they would allow me to keep it as my own personal desktop. I wouldn’t have to return it if I decided to leave. The hybrid schedule opened up the opportunity for me to get out a little more. I wouldn’t be longing to get home at the end of the day as I would’ve already been there. 

That all sounded well and fine but I really underestimated how tired working at a computer 20 feet from my bed would make me. Needless to say I did not end up going out after work. The days I worked from home I would go straight to bed a lot earlier and be up hours before the sun. Things got worse when I was told to switch to virtual work at home full time. This was so the company could spend less money on resources by having people enter the office and use those computers. I’m not sure I understood it completely but as long as the checks kept coming. 

They did but the sleep didn’t. My sleep schedule got so messed up that at times I began to miss some of my meetings. I tried explaining my situation to my boss but they just set up a meeting with HR to figure out a solution. I think if I wasn’t so willing to handle some of the crap work no one else would have, they would’ve fired me on the spot after the third missed meeting. But they liked the ambition I had to make a paycheck. So with a quick meeting with an HR rep it was decided that maybe I needed to find new hobbies outside of my home so I didn’t feel so drawn to go to bed the second I logged off for the day. 

Some of the suggestions they had were joining a club of some sorts, spend time with family, or on a more personal level try and go out on dates with someone. If I was paid in companionship I’d be a peasant. I haven’t had a girlfriend since high school and I’m almost 30 so maybe they were right about that one. I wasn't too keen on joining a club with other lonely adult men, that just seems too depressing for my taste. I couldn’t visit family because I had moved across the country to get away from them and was on my own. 

I opted to start going to the gym everyday after work. Truth be told, the only thing that was really holding me back from trying the dating scene was my confidence in my appearance. I had put on a few pounds once I began my remote work and had to start taking lunches at my desk. I wasn’t getting very much exercise so this could finally get me back into shape and give me some time out of the apartment. That’s when I began to notice just how odd this place really was.

As mentioned I hadn’t seen any neighbors or other residents of this complex. Obviously I had thought that was due to me just being oblivious during my daily pursuits to work and home. But once I was leaving during normal hours of the day I had expected to see the other people. Children on the built in playground with their parents watching on, others walking their dogs around the patches of land spread throughout, or even mail carriers coming to deliver the post. I hadn’t seen a soul.

*“Am I the only person who lives here?”*

 I asked myself trying to remember the last person I truly saw outside of the ground of these apartment buildings. I hadn’t even met with the property manager or landlord upon moving in. I was coming from out of state and discovered this place online and was able to fill out the paperwork through a portal online and pay all the necessary fees in order to move in ASAP. It was extremely convenient. The only email I received was a DONOTREPLY email attached with a message stating…

*“Below you will find the address, your apartment number is [redacted], and the keys will be under the mat the day you arrive.”*

I guess looking back on it now that should’ve raised some red flags. I guess I was just excited to get the hell out there and start my new life.

It’s absurd how you can get used to a routine then without hesitation be jerked out of it. I wish I could claim insanity with my situation at hand but alas it’s all too true. It was barely noticeable when it first arrived. I honestly couldn’t tell you how long it probably had been there for. Days…weeks…months even?! It was just a couple weeks ago when I fully became aware of this small brown box just sitting in front of the apartment directly across the hall from mine.

I’m sure in passing I unconsciously looked at it multiple times. But it’s like I told you, about noticing the lack of life. I was so distracted by my daily pursuits that it was of no importance to me. But I think realizing my surroundings opened up a can of worms I couldn’t reseal. It looked new and pristine, like it had been packed right there in front of the door. But the oddest part was that it seemed to not have any labels on it. 

*“Maybe someone who lived nearby hand delivered it?!”*

I thought to myself as I stood on my welcome mat, attempting to examine the package and find any indication of where it came from. 

I know it wouldn’t normally be unusual to see packages sitting outside someone’s home. 
The delay in retrieval can be due to any number of reasons really. The residents could just be on vacation and haven’t come home yet. So I gave it the benefit of the doubt and waited a few more days. It was only until the following Monday that I grew suspicious, as the brown box with mysterious contents remained sitting in front of the apartment across from mine…

It was time to take action. I emerged from my apartment, marched across the hall, and knocked on the neighbors door. There was a part of me that was hoping the resident was in a situation like mine. Had a remote job, lost track of their days, and barely went outside… No response. I tried again and after a minute, nothing. I wasn’t sure what to do next but my only thought was to try and contact the front office to see if they could do anything about this or come into contact with the resident. When I arrived at the building that sat just at the threshold of this complex, I was surprised to find that the building was closed for the day. 

*“That’s odd.. it’s only noon. Why are they closed this early on a Monday?”* 

It wasn’t even a holiday so there didn’t seem to be any reason that the building wouldn’t be open. But I guess I had to try again the next day. Which I did to the same misfortune. It soon occurred to me that it didn’t matter what time of day I went, the office was never open. I called the number posted outside the main door and to my surprise the number was disconnected. I looked up the apartment buildings online and got the most current email listed on the website for a project manager. The email didn’t say any names, it was just the name of the complex and some random numbers. The domain was @ - aol.com. I shouldn’t have been surprised when I didn’t receive any messages back after explaining the situation. It looked like I was on my own. 

*“Screw it”*

I said as I marched back to my building. I was ready to just take the package to the post office and have it shipped back where it came from. But I was stopped when I bent over to see something out of the corner of my eye. The apartment directly next to mine. The one diagonally across from where I was standing to retrieve the package. Had a ring bell security camera sitting on the door. There was no telling if the camera was on or not. At that moment in time I couldn’t risk being caught on camera taking another person's package. I really didn’t need the police involved even if it was out of good intentions. So I retreated back into my apartment to come up with a new solution. 

When I finally gathered my thoughts on what to do next I had realized something. I was utterly alone. I had no family, no friends, no girlfriend, and seemingly no neighbors. Just me, my thoughts, and that stupid box sitting outside across the hall. Do you ever just get that eerie feeling when you’re alone? Like someone or something is watching you? How about when you’re sitting in a dark room? Do your senses heighten or hear things that might not really be there? I began hearing a muffled voice next door. I pressed my ear against the wall behind my stove and cupped my other ear to listen intently….Nothing.

*“That can’t be. I know I heard someone’s voice. A- A man.”*

I thought to myself. He was speaking some foreign language but a man no less. It had to be. I knew I couldn’t be the only person here. I guess the feeling of loneliness filled in the blanks. I had no doubt that my active imagination created a scenario where I was the only person living here amongst a seven building community. It was absurd to think otherwise. So after breathing a sigh of relief and snapping myself back to a clear sense of reality. I poured myself a drink and unwinded for the rest of the night.

When the next day came around, I finished up my reports, and sent them to my boss for review. Finally I logged off work for the day and decided that I could run to the gym and get a quick workout in before going to dinner. After my not so exciting couple of hours out of the apartment, I returned home to find a second box, this time sitting in front of the apartment diagonally across from mine. From that moment I knew that my false sense of security had gotten the better of me. I let my guard down and a second unwanted shipment had arrived. 

Instead of heading into my safe quarters, I walked carefully to the neighbor with the ring camera’s door, and gave a knock. After a few moments I could hear the sound of the deadbolt unlocking and the door slightly creaked open. An older looking man stuck his head out to greet me. He looked like he hadn’t slept or been out in sunlight for years, with bags resting under his eyes, and his skin as pale as a ghost. 

*“Hi, I don’t think we’ve met. I live right next door to you. I know this is going to sound crazy but a lot of weird things have been happening around here and I couldn’t help but notice you have a ring camera on your door. I was wondering maybe, if it wasn’t too much trouble, could I see the footage from this camera from like the last couple of weeks? Hell, even the last day would be great.”*

I asked as the man looked at me like I asked him to sell me his kidney. Safe to say it took some convincing and small talk but I was able to get my hands on the camera footage. But not before I learned that this man was definitely foreign (maybe Russian? I couldn’t quite put my finger on it), like I had previously thought. But he also has been living here since before I moved in and hasn’t left his apartment since the day he arrived. I tried to pry the information as to why he never left. But the more I talked about the complex the more scared he looked…. He told me to wait there while he went back inside. After waiting for a few minutes he reemerged and handed me a usb of all the footage from the day he arrived to the moment I knocked on his door. I thanked him and before I could walk away he whispered something. It must’ve been something in his native language because I couldn’t make out exactly what it was but it kind of sounded like…

*“See Mart V”*

With that he shut the door and left me to it. I raced back inside and quickly plugged the usb into my computer and loaded up the files. I started with that day just after I left. I knew for a fact that the second package wasn’t sitting there when I left. To my utter shock The package was never delivered by anyone….I saw the footage of me walking by but the box just appeared. It was so seamless. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. The box just showed up. I found the day the first package arrived and the same thing. It just appeared like God himself just snapped his fingers and the boxes arrived. But believe it or not that wasn’t the most startling thing I saw on that footage. I scrolled as far back as I could to find the early footage available and on the first file I could see the date marked. 

*“January 1st 1996”*

I felt frozen…Now I know what you’re thinking, it wasn’t the fact that ring bell cameras weren’t even invented then. It was the fact that the date was My Birthdate. I didn’t know how to react but I closed the files. I don’t know if it was the paranoia in me but refused to look at that footage. I pulled the USB out of my computer and shoved it into my safe and locked it up. Then I grabbed my phone and dialed Nine One One…. But just as soon as I did I stopped myself.

What the hell are the cops going to do? I already didn’t want them involved earlier with the packages. What would I even say to them? 

*“I need a wellness check on the neighbors?”*

I don’t even know for sure if anyone even lives there. I didn’t see a single soul pass by on the footage except for myself. So to risk myself not getting sent away for sounding crazy. I decided to lay low for a few days and then continue to take actions into my hands when I felt the time was ready.

After a week of not leaving my home, in fear that I’d run into another oddity, I finally unlocked my front door and stepped outside slowly. What I saw made me ready to run. A third package had arrived…in front of the older foreign man’s home. I tried to scream but the sound was trapped in my throat. If I wasn’t scared before I was then. I saw that the camera was shattered on the ground and I tried knocking and opening his door but to no avail. I ran back inside and grabbed my keys to leave. There was no way I was staying here anymore. I didn’t care, I had to go.

I rushed down the stairs and to my car. I got inside, put the key in the ignition, and was unable to get the car started. I kept turning the key desperately. But the engine wouldn’t turn over.

*“FUCK!”*

I shouted at the top of my lungs and got out. I decided to run for it. I ran as fast as I could out of my complex. But when I made it to the foot of the access road something caught my eye. A sign hanging by the front office. I crept my way over to read what was on it. It said,

*“We here would like to thank you for choosing us as your new home..”*

followed by a big yellow smiley face. Then reality began to sink back in. I didn’t have anywhere to go. I was a thousand miles away from home, I worked exclusively from home now, and I couldn’t afford to sleep in a hotel room for the rest of my lease that wasn’t up for about another year. I needed to go back. I reluctantly did….but I didn’t return home empty handed. 

When I opened my door and stepped inside to accept my fate. There, sitting on the floor inside my apartment… was a large brown box. With a note resting on top that said,

*“From Management.”*

I slowly shut the door behind me and locked it tight. I could feel my heart beating a mile a minute as I kneeled down to open the box and see finally what was inside. What I found was a picture frame marked,

*“January 1st 1996.”*

 I flipped it over with my hands shaking to unveil the picture that rested inside the frame. It was me being held by my mother moments after my birth. There was a reflection from a monitor sitting above her hospital bed. It showed the doorway to the room and a figure on the other side of the doorway lurking…That feeling like someone was watching me crept up my spine as I looked up. I saw nothing in the darkness of my home. When I looked back down at the picture the figure in the reflection was gone….so was my mother. 

I dropped the frame and it shattered across the floor. I didn’t even care at that point if I could afford it I had to leave. I knew it was a mistake to second myself and it cost me. I whipped open my door to leave and what I found on the other side was my apartment… But backwards and somehow darker?! I had to pinch myself to make sure what I was seeing was true. I don’t know what made me do it but I stepped in and the door shut behind me and locked for good…I ran to the back sliding door that led to my deck but when I stepped outside everything looked wrong. It looked off. It wasn’t just my apartment that was backwards. The world was backwards. The pond that rested on the right side of the complex was now on the left. I looked over at the clock to see 5:00 pm turn to 4:59 pm…….

What the hell happened? I should’ve left when I had the chance…I’m currently trying to muster up the courage to leave my apart- well I don’t know if I can truly call this my apartment anymore. But I guess if anyone is out there and finds this and I haven’t updated in a while, assume the worst… As a word of advice. If you’re thinking of moving into an apartment building and you see that sign with the bright yellow smiley face….RUN!!
