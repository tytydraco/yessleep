Four months ago, I wouldn’t have called myself a strong man—or even a decent human being. My shortcomings far outweighed my successes, no matter what I was doing. Jobs, relationships, friendships—hell, I couldn’t even keep my damn cat around. They’re all gone now, and I’ve just paid this month’s rent with the last of my money, leaving me with forty bucks to my name. That gives me thirty days to find another job, or I’ll have to move back in with the last friend I have left. But I don’t think he’ll be up for that a fourth time.

I grabbed my old jacket and walked out of my apartment. I needed to get groceries to last me the next couple of weeks and figure out my job situation when I got back. After locking the door and shoving my keys into my pocket, I double-checked my jeans for the grocery list and headed down the stairs. When I got to my car in the lot, I climbed in and turned the key.

“Fuck,” I sighed.

I could’ve sworn I’d just put five bucks in the tank to get me to the store and back. I stepped out and slammed the door shut. Walking around to the passenger side, I saw the gas cap hanging open and a siphon hose left dangling as evidence of someone else’s handiwork.

“Well,” I said, “guess I’m walking.”

The store was only five blocks away, but in the mid-December cold, I would’ve preferred the warmth of my car. I went back to my apartment to grab my thicker jacket, then headed out again. I stuck the keys into the jacket's pocket and made my way down the stairs.

Two blocks into my walk, three things happened:

One, I lost my keys through a hole in my jacket and watched them land in a puddle of slush at the edge of the sidewalk.

Two, a car sped by and splashed me with freezing, dirty water just as I bent down to grab the keys.

Three, once I retrieved them, I realized the keys were bent out of shape. That meant I’d have to call my landlord on his day off to bring me the spare—and who knows how long that would take.

“Oh no,” I muttered. “Not Dad’s keychain.”

My dad had this old bottle cap my mom had turned into a keychain with clear epoxy. She gave it to me after he died a few years ago.

“Me and your mother went out on our first date, and this was from the bottle of soda we shared,” he used to say. “Every time I see it, I still smile.”

I doubted he’d be smiling at the bent, to hell thing now. He’d probably give me that disappointed look and tell me how irresponsible I was—again. My mom, on the other hand, would’ve shaken her head and said it was “no big deal” but to try to be more careful. I missed her optimism. Mom passed away eight months after Dad. I always thought she just gave up once he was gone, the loneliness too much for her to bear. I missed them both.

Shaking off the slush, I put the keys in my other pocket and dusted myself off. When I reached for my phone, I realized I’d left it in my other jacket, the one thrown on my dingy old couch. I always rushed through things. Everyone told me that. Hopefully, the store would let me borrow their phone so I could call the landlord.

I turned a corner into an alley that cut through to the last few blocks before the store. I always used this shortcut when I had to walk, which was more often than not. Gas was like diamonds to me—precious and rare. No matter how much I worked or earned, rent and food always came first, leaving gas as an afterthought for emergencies.

Halfway down the alley, I stopped. There was a door in the brick wall to my left—a normal door, clean and white, with a silver knob but no keyhole.

Odd.

I’d walked this alley a hundred times before, and that door had never been there. I turned toward it, scanning it from top to bottom. Barely visible against the white surface were faint letters that read:

“The Giving Room.”

“The Giving Room?” I said aloud. “What the hell is The Giving Room, and where did this door come from?”

I stared at it for a moment, curiosity gnawing at me. Finally, I reached out and tried the knob, but it wouldn’t budge.

“For a giving room, it sure isn’t giving me entry,” I muttered with a dry chuckle.

I turned to walk away when I heard a faint click behind me. Turning back, to look at the door. No way. Had I really heard that? I stepped closer and tried the knob again. This time, it turned easily. I pushed the door open and stepped halfway inside, peering into the darkness beyond. I couldn’t see anything.

“I wish there was some light in here,” I said
