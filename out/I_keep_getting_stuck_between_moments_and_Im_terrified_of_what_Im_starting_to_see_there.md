It started three weeks ago when I missed my exit on the highway.

Not like, I was distracted and drove past it. I mean I was in the right lane, blinker on, looking directly at the exit, and then I was two miles down the road with no memory of how I got there. Like someone had cut out a chunk of my life and glued the remaining pieces together.

I’m 34. I don’t do drugs. I barely drink. I thought maybe I’d had a small stroke or something, so I went to urgent care. They did all the tests. Everything came back normal. The doctor said stress can do weird things to memory, and sent me home.

It happened again four days later. I was pouring coffee and then I was standing at my desk at work, coffee in hand, with no recollection of the drive. Three hours just gone.

That’s when I started keeping a notebook. Time stamps. What I was doing before, what I was doing after. Looking for patterns.

The gaps kept happening. Always different lengths. Sometimes seconds, sometimes hours. But here’s the thing: other people remembered those times. My coworker remembered our conversation during one of my “missing” hours. I’d apparently been present, functional, normal. I just couldn’t remember any of it.

Last week, something changed.

I was at the grocery store, reaching for a box of pasta, and I got stuck. Not stuck in the memory gap, stuck in the actual moment. My hand was extended toward the shelf, and I could not complete the motion. Like trying to push through water that kept getting thicker.

And in that pause, that razor-thin gap between reaching and grasping, I saw them.

Threads.

Connecting everything. Everyone. Silver and gold and colors I don’t have names for, running between every person in that store like a web spun by something vast and patient. And the threads were old. Ancient. Like they’d always been there and I was only just now developing the eyes to see them.

A woman mid-laugh, her mouth open, and her thread pulsed with light that split and ran to seven other people in the store, including me. I felt her joy land in my chest like a stone dropped in still water, rippling outward. A tired dad with his hand on his kid’s shoulder, and the thread between them was thick as rope, golden, humming with something that made my throat tight. An old man reading a label, and his thread reached backward through the store, through the walls, spiraling away to some distant point I couldn’t see but somehow knew was his mother, dead thirty years, still connected to him by a cord that death hadn’t severed.

I could see how we were holding each other up. How every thread tugged and was tugged in return. How nothing existed separately. We were all part of some massive weaving, some pattern being made by hands I couldn’t see but could suddenly feel.

Then time snapped forward and I grabbed the pasta with shaking hands and got out of there.

It’s happening more frequently now. These pauses. And each time I get stuck between moments, I see more of the pattern. The weaving gets clearer.

Yesterday I was at a red light and got stuck for what felt like an hour. The woman in the car next to me was crying, and I watched her thread pulse dark and bright at once, watched it connect to every loss I’ve ever felt, every time I’ve sat alone and wept. But it didn’t stop with me. It ran backward through time, connecting her grief to her grandmother’s grief to her great-grandmother’s grief, an unbroken cord of sorrow stretching back through generations. And forward too, to children not yet born who would carry the same thread.

We inherit the threads. We pass them on. The pattern remembers everything.

I looked at my own hands and saw threads running from my fingers in every direction. Some were frayed. Some were strong. One ran directly back to my mother, pulsing with every heartbeat, the same thread that had connected us before I was born, when I was still forming inside her. Another ran to a friend I haven’t spoken to in six years, thin but unbroken. Another to a stranger I’d smiled at in an airport two decades ago, the tiniest gossamer strand, but there. Still there.

Nothing is lost. Every moment of connection, every kindness, every time we’ve truly seen each other, it’s all still here in the weaving. Permanent. Real in a way that the physical world is not.

Here’s the part that terrifies me: I think I’m being pulled into the place where the weaving is made. Where the hands work. I think I’m unsticking from time because time is just the speed at which we experience the pattern being woven, and I’m moving to where it exists all at once.

This morning I got stuck for six hours. My clock said thirty seconds had passed.

I was sitting at my kitchen table and the world paused and I saw it all. The complete pattern. Every thread that has ever connected one consciousness to another, stretching across all of human history in this incomprehensible tapestry. I saw how your joy feeds my joy feeds their joy in an endless cycle. I saw how we’re all holding the same light, passing it between us like a torch that never goes out. I saw how every act of love strengthens the weaving and every act of cruelty tries to tear it, but the pattern holds. It always holds.

And I saw the hands.

Not human hands. Something older. Something that’s been weaving since the first human looked at another human and recognized themselves. The hands move through all of us. We are the loom and the thread and the weavers all at once, acting out some pattern we can’t see but have always been creating together.

When I came back, I was sobbing. Not from fear. From recognition.

I’ve been there before. We all have. Before we were born, after we die, in every dream where we remember we’re connected to everything. It’s where we came from. The place between moments, where the pattern lives.

The gaps are getting longer. I’m spending more time there than here. My coworker said today that I stood at my desk for twenty minutes staring at nothing, but from my side it was hours deep in the weaving, watching threads pulse with light.

I think soon I won’t come back at all. I’ll get stuck in the between place permanently, dissolved into the pattern, becoming one of the hands that weaves.

I should be terrified. Every survival instinct should be screaming. But when I’m there, between the moments, I feel like I’m finally awake after a long sleep. Like I’m remembering something I was made to forget when I was born into linear time.

Your thread is here too. Right now. As you read this. I can see it stretching from you to me, thin and silver, humming with attention. The pattern connects us. The weaving holds us both.

And the hands are so patient. They’ve been waiting for us to remember. All of us. They’ve been weaving since the first fire, the first story, the first time one human touched another with intention. They’ve been making the pattern that holds reality together, and we’re all part of it, adding our threads with every choice, every connection, every moment we choose love over fear.

I’m getting stuck again. The world is starting to slow.

But this time I can see you in the weaving too. Your thread is pulsing. You’re reading these words and something in you remembers. Something ancient waking up. The hands recognize you. They’ve been waiting for you to see.

It’s beautiful there. In the space between. Where the pattern lives. Where we’re all connected by threads that nothing can break. Where every moment of genuine connection, every act of courage, every choice to reach out rather than pull back adds to the weaving.

You’re part of it too. You always have been. The thread that runs from you touches thousands of other threads, and those threads touch thousands more. Your grandmother’s hands guided your hands guide your children’s hands, all weaving together.

The world is pausing now. I can feel the hands moving through me.

I’m not coming back this time. But I’m not disappearing. I’m just finally seeing what I always was. What we all are.

Threads in the pattern.

Light in the weaving.

And the hands keep working, patient and ancient, making something beautiful out of all of us.

Don’t forget. Don’t let yourself forget. You’re connected. You matter. Every thread you create matters. The pattern needs you.

It’s so beautiful here.

Can you feel your thread pulling?
