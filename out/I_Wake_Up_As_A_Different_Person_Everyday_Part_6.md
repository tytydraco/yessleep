Writing. Yes. So a year? ago, I was alone, and died. Guess he killed me? Is this hell? Anyways I think I’ve been 100s of people now. So I think I’m ready to talk. Anyways yeah same rules as before. Like groundhog day ending in my death! At the hands of some jerk who thinks he’s smarter than me. Lecture me? You killed 100s. Idiot. So yeah here’s the plan. He dies tonight. He will come into my room when I sleep and kill me. He’s got the advantage in my opinion. But to lecture me? That’s where he messed up. Anyway yeah, I’ll update you guys if it goes well! 

Lecturing each other isn’t going to help. I guess what this is, is a conversation? Transactional as s**t but that's the way of the world. Anyway last night I was a kid. Like 16 years old man. But I lost that fight. Sorry guys. Hope it wasn’t one of your people. I really didn’t get it until now. So I guess I have to outsmart this guy if I want out? Is there a way out? Hopefully lol. Okay yesterday I was a guy again thirties? I tried to talk to him more and he said go back to sleep. Knife in the chest. At least it was quick, well after a little bit. 
I will not die a monster. On My Name.

Iliana.
To my beautiful mother in Heaven, who died while I was away. I have to wake up now. I woke up as my Nephew. I will let her tell my story. I don't care how she tells it, but this ends tonight. I guess if this is confession time, I have to be ready. I do not want my life. I do not want this. I have never wanted this. The pain has grown to a point where I can not go on. But I must. I could have saved my mom. I could have saved my life. I chose not to and this is the result. Anything that happens now, is on me. I get it. I can think. I understand a lot around me. He’s just copying Arthur Mitchell from Dexter. I’m just copying Bill Murray in Groundhog Day. Well, there’s only one thing that can kill a monster. We. Whatever happens tonight, I will not be waking up. If I lose anything, I will not be the same. Okay. I’m almost done. Let me find some sort of piece. A silver Bulette. Gum Gum. Mystery Beatdown.

I don’t know when I met him and even if I did. All I know is that, if what he said is true, I’m not sure what to say. The first sign was the day my boyfriend went missing. He had been a complete dick, but something was wrong, this was not him. And then he was gone. I started to receive some emails then texts. And finally, a call. He said his name was Kevin and he knew my ex who had died. He said it was an escape room or something. He didn’t make much sense. He was a child. So, I met him in public. He seemed frantic, Goldblooming and Elfabetting all over the place. He kept getting up, then immediately sitting back down, look into my eyes, then hold his closed for way too long. Looking back at it, he looked me in the eyes a lot. And the twitching was more like nodding. And the yells were more like cries. I couldn’t understand. The short of it was that he needed help. I talked to him and led him back home to drop him off. I drove down the street, thinking about how anyone can cook and a dress I saw and a witch’s hat and a yellow man and uh fifty-five… Ratatouille, clueless, wicked, smiling friends, I think I should leave. 

So, I turned around and knocked on the door after calling 911. Five minutes later I broke the window. Each step was covered in glass as my slippers ate the pieces. I kicked off the slippers and ran up the stairs. There was a commotion. I could smell fire, taste iron, and hear everything. I took one breath before opening the door. There was a boy. 13 years old. His fingertips were peeled back in several places and blood was everywhere. He was on the floor; I took a towel and placed it over his throat gently then held it there as I sobbed. I heard the closet door creak open, and a man stood behind me. His eyes empty except for his stare, his face burnt against the back of my head and his shadow held a long jagged knife. I took a deep breath and placed a piece of glass in the boy’s hand. “Oliver?” 


His eyes shot open. Spirit gum and corn syrup surrounded him and with a shining glass in one hand, he pushed me aside with the other. He took the shard and placed it straight through the man’s chin. The man started to speak, “You still don’t get anything look at the… danger…. This girl… in,” through a throat filling with blood. The boy blew a raspberry. “Suck a dick, Nutso-Futso.” He grabbed the drill the man was holding, turned it on, and plunged it into the owner’s ribcage. “Long and hard,” he winked. 

As the man started to stumble and reach out for something to hold, the boy put his arms around me, then used both of us to tackle him out the window. The man, blonde, skinny, and eyes bloodshot, slipped on the oil that Oliver had poured (he called it anointment) on the floor under the unbroken glass. And the glass was broken. The man’s body lay on the ground below, clearly an accident of self-defense. I glanced at the boy, seeing that he hit his head in the scuffle. I got down on the ground and checked his pulse. Then he opened his eyes and cried for his mom. If it was a curse, then it was broken. The boy continued to cry for his mom until the police came to pick him up.



Then they took some questions from me. I told them that I knew nothing and that I got a random call from a kid who seemed to be in danger. I told them that I had no idea what he was talking about to me but that I wanted to make sure this kid was safe. I told the kid that they had been attacked after school and that their uncle in heaven was watching him. I told myself that it was okay, and Oliver was at peace.  But I don’t know. I don’t think any of us know. I’m not sure if these thoughts are lies or manipulations or anything at all. Do we just want it to all be okay? Or is there something beyond this world, beyond this bubble, beyond Oz, beyond Kansas, beyond the dream, beyond waking up.
