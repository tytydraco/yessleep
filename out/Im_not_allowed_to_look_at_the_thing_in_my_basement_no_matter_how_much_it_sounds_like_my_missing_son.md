My son Noah vanished at 23 years of age a year ago today. I tried my best to push through it - put posters up all over town, led the search committees, did anything else I thought might have a snowball's chance in hell of helping to find him, but it all amounted to nothing. My marriage subsequently began to cave in on itself and soon enough the family I'd spent the past two decades building and nurturing fell apart. My wife moved away after our separation and I was left alone in our small house on the outskirts of town. Left alone to endlessly search under Noah's bed, inside his closet, inside the hole in his wall. Hoping he would manifest out of thin air if I looked one last time. For a while, I managed to cope, to hold it together well enough to function on *some* level. 



But then the noises started. 



At first, it was nothing more than a faint scratching coming from below the living room couch. I would be lying there watching some god-awful TV show and nursing a beer whilst pretending to be fine when the sound of something slowly scraping what seemed like fingernails would take me away from my distraction. The border between the living room floor and the basement ceiling wasn't very thick, so we used to hear things from down there all the time which allowed me to remain only mildly annoyed at these badly-timed scratchings. Unfortunately, the door was and always had been secured with an ancient padlock and the landlord told us when we moved in many years prior that it was off-limits. It wasn't until the whispering started that my annoyance grew into concern and soon fear. I had to stomach listening intently quite a few times to understand what was being said in that hushed, desperate tone - but I soon began to hear and later understand it in all its horrifying meaning. 



*My face.*



*My face.*



*My face.*



Between intensely dreadful curiosity and deeply penetrating terror, I resolved to ignore the landlord's order and venture into the basement. Nothing I tried could remove the padlock and now apparent reinforcement of the door, so I scoured the internet for a locksmith with experience doing more than picking old padlocks and that same day I was able to peer into the void. A dark space devoid of any life initially greeted me, but when my eyes were able to adjust something else came into sight. In the far corner directly below the living room couch sat a metal chair, occupied by a figure shrouded by darkness. My impaired eyesight meant I couldn't make much out, and as I was about to turn and sprint back up the stairs to call the police the thing spoke in a hushed tone. 



"*Dad, my face.*"



A tremble crept across my body. "*Dad?*"



I stumbled back up the stairs and returned armed with a flashlight and a facade of assuredness. I had to know what I was dealing with. 





What I laid my eyes upon was something inhabiting the space between life and death. My flashlight illuminated a face made up of proportions that were all wrong. Eyes set apart too far wide, lips extended beyond where they should be, layers and layers of thickness where thickness shouldn't exist. It was like a cruel caricature of what a human should look like had been brought to life. As I examined the thing before me, it repeated the same phrase as before. 



"*Dad, my face.*" 



And in that moment, standing within a breath's distance, it finally came to me. It was speaking in my son's voice, and it was indisputably his. A parent never forgets the sound of their child's voice. My heart sank to depths I'd never thought possible and I toppled backwards out of a mix of emotions too potent for words to convey. 



"*Noah, is that you?*" I asked, my voice tinged with grief. I asked a million different questions but always got that same reply. Like a broken record somebody had manufactured that way. 



My bewilderment grew even more pervasive, but I couldn't stand to look at what seemed to once be my son in that state. I called the police and told them all that I'd seen, except when they arrived all they could see was the same blackness that I'd seen at first. No chair in the corner. No figure sitting on it. They looked at me with pity. A broken man who had conjured something out of nothing more than unadulterated sadness. They gave me the information of some local resources I seemed to need before leaving. 





Over the next few days and weeks, I would despairingly stare into the basement, hoping to see something resembling my child. Even a vague resemblance would have been enough for me. Still, the figure remained. Whispering those awful words over and over. I tried to get it out, but as soon as I laid so much as a finger on its withering skin it - for lack of a better word - dematerialised. And as soon as I took a step back, there it was again.  



Just as I was coming around to the possibility that I did need help mentally and looked over the list of numbers those police officers handed me, an unassuming notebook showed up - tucked beneath my pillow with one edge poking out as if begging to be noticed. The first entry was titled "*Something in my walls*" and detailed a Sunday in October dated about a year and a half ago wherein the writer described the scratching noises and whispering they were hearing coming from their bedroom wall. They scrawled the phrase they could hear at the end of the entry: 



"*My face.*" 



It was Noah's handwriting. Again, undeniably. 



The entries continued. He detailed how he found a hole leading into the wall cavity hidden behind a poster that he'd had up in his room since he was a little child. How he had seen a figure with badly wrong facial proportions muttering that same phrase. How he had told his parents and they couldn't see nor hear anything in there. He wrote about how he didn't want to be carted off to some facility. That he would pretend he hadn't seen what he had. A lie, both to maintain his sanity and image. The entries ended abruptly on the 14th of June last year. The day of his disappearance. It was titled "*It's Here Now*" and was made up of a single sentence. 



"*I've seen it, and now it wants my face.*" 



The wetness of tears forming began to cloud my vision as I closed the diary and tucked it back beneath my pillow. But out of my periphery, I noticed something scrawled on the back of the light green notebook. 



"*Please Dad, stay out of the basement.*



*Don't make me take yours.*" 



My son, my Noah is still alive. Somehow, *somewhere*. 



He wants to spare me. He always was so gracious. So kind. Even when he's not himself. 



But I can't stand knowing his fate, being able to do *something* about it, and letting him serve as the sacrificial lamb. 



I'm going down to the basement now.



I only hope I can end his suffering.
