I push my way through the dense crowd and cast a quick glance at the timetable. "London Windsor 10:35" is displayed in yellow text on the black digital board. I glance at my phone again, "10:34" shows on the display. A wave of stress hits me, taking control of my body. Now, I'm no longer walking. I start running, plowing through the dense crowd like a tractor plowing through grain. I hear comments and names being called after me, but I keep pushing through, normally I wouldn’t let it go, but I don’t have time to argue. "10:35" the clock strikes just as I breathlessly step onto the train. Shortly after, the train is on its way to Windsor. I find a perfect seat in an almost empty carriage. I sit down with my pulse still racing and look around. In the carriage, there’s an older lady, a middle-aged man, and a mother with her daughter who looks like she was born just a few weeks ago. I hear the door to the carriage slide open behind me and see the ticket inspector step in. I take out my phone from my pocket and bring up my digital ticket, the inspector scans it and continues down the carriage. It doesn’t take long before I fall asleep.

I wake up to a monotone voice. “Next station Windsor,” the voice repeats twice before falling silent. I look around the carriage sleepily, the lady from earlier is still there but the others seem to have gotten off. I decide to take a quick bathroom break before the train arrives. I get up and wobble through the carriage on my half-asleep legs. Just as I'm about to turn the handle to the bathroom door, I catch a glimpse of the lady. Her empty stare meets mine. Never in my 68 years on this earth have I seen anything like it, not even during my 39 years as a criminal investigator. In front of me, just a few meters away, sits the now dead lady staring at me. It’s not the first time I’ve seen a dead body considering my former job, but this one is different. There’s not much of a face left on the poor lady, she looks like she’s been beaten several times.

I feel my stomach turn, burst through the bathroom door, and lock it behind me. I turn on the cold water and splash my face several times before gathering the courage to unlock the door, give it a gentle push, and let it slide open. I slowly peek out, eyes closed, hoping she’s gone and that it was all just a dream. I open my eyes. Sure enough, she’s still there, but something is different. Her face is no longer battered, and now she’s smiling. It’s a kind smile, the kind your grandmother used to give you. Yet it makes me feel uneasy, it’s almost “creepy,” a word my grandchild used to say but fits this situation perfectly. Now it’s no longer a kind smile, the corners of her mouth are tensely stretched, reaching all the way up to her ears.

I close my eyes again, count to three, and open them. In front of me sits the now familiar lady, but back to her previous state, the same battered face. Now that the situation has sunk in, I can think more clearly and my experience as a criminal investigator kicks in. I pull out my phone and shakily dial 911. Just as my finger is a few millimeters from calling, everything becomes blurry. It feels like I’m being sucked into a portal and the carriage fades further and further away. I wake up with a jolt.

“Good morning, Roger!” says the young nurse.
