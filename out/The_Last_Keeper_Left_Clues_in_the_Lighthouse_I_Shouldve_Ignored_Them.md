Riley and I were bleeding out in the city, our lives scraped raw by endless hustle and a world that didn’t care. I’m 24, a marine biology student drowning in loans, my days split between lectures and diner shifts, my nights spent sketching starfish and corals I’d never touch, the ink smudging under my tired hands. Riley, 26, is a mechanic, his palms etched with oil, his laugh a flare in the dark, loud enough to drown out the sirens, though his wrench couldn’t fix our bank account, always red, always shrinking. We’d sprawl on our apartment’s sagging couch, the walls paper-thin, neighbors yelling, pipes groaning, dreaming of a place where we could hear our own thoughts. Riley would grin, his hazel eyes catching the streetlight, saying, “One day, man, we’ll ditch this cage, find a spot that’s ours.” I’d nod, my chest tight, wanting it so bad it hurt, but the city kept us chained, its noise a noose. When I scrolled through a job board one sleepless night, half-dead on coffee, and saw an ad for a caretaker gig at Blackthorn Isle’s lighthouse, it was a jolt, a crack of light in our gray. A year’s lodging in a cottage, a paycheck to keep an old beacon spinning, and solitude, pure, untouched, to rebuild what we’d lost. No deposit, no prying forms, just a phone call with an agent who sounded wrong, his voice clipped, shaky, like he was reading from a script he didn’t write. “You sure about this,” he asked, not waiting for an answer, hanging up fast, leaving static in my ear. We didn’t care, we were too hungry for escape, too worn to question. We stuffed our lives into duffels, Riley’s tools rattling, my books bending the straps, and caught a ferry that groaned across the North Atlantic, landing eight days ago on a shore sharp with rocks, the sea’s growl low, constant, like it was sizing us up. Riley stepped off first, his boots crunching, his grin wide, arm slung around me. “This is it, brother, our reset, you feel that air?” I breathed in, salt and cold stinging my lungs, and smiled, nodding, though something in the waves, their rhythm, felt off, like a pulse not ours.
Blackthorn Isle is no postcard, it’s a bruise on the ocean, a chunk of stone and silence where the wind cuts and the sea never sleeps. The lighthouse towers over it, a relic from the 1800s, its walls pitted, its iron cap flaked with rust, the beacon inside humming, a vibration that crawls into your jaw, its light slicing through fog that hangs heavy. The cottage clings to its base, a squat box of granite, its windows cloudy, its door warped, looking warm until you cross the threshold and feel its weight, like it’s waiting for you to slip. Inside, the main room’s bare, a table scratched deep, a stove that hisses, a desk heavy with age, all smelling of damp wood and oil, the floor chilling your feet through socks. Upstairs, two bedrooms, mattresses thin, blankets stiff, a hallway where shadows sit, untouched by the single bulb buzzing above. Riley didn’t care, his eyes lit up as he kicked open the door, hauling our bags, his voice booming, “Check this, man, our own fort, no one to bug us!” He dropped his duffel, spun around, hands wide, “Give it a month, we’ll have my sketches up, your fish drawings, make it home.” His laugh was real, warm, filling the space, and I grinned, caught in his fire, but the cottage didn’t answer, its silence thick, soaking up his words like a sponge, giving back nothing but a creak, a sigh from the walls.
We threw ourselves into the work, sweeping dirt from corners, oiling the beacon’s gears, their grind loud, steady, something to hold onto. Riley took the tower, climbing its spiral stairs, his boots echoing, his whistle sharp, some old tune he’d hum when happy, while I scrubbed the cottage, my hands raw, my mind drifting to the sea outside, its roar never fading. He’d call down, teasing, “You slacking already, professor, need me to do your job too?” I’d yell back, “Keep dreaming, grease monkey, I’m carrying you!” and his laugh would drift down, grounding me, making the island feel smaller, safer. We’d sit at night, splitting canned stew, Riley waving his spoon, planning, “We save up, fix a boat, sail wherever, you pick the reef, I’ll steer.” I’d nod, my chest lighter, his plans painting a future I could almost touch, but the cottage listened, its walls cold, the windows fogging, like they knew something we didn’t.
The work wasn’t just chores, it was a rhythm, a way to claim the place, make it ours. Riley tackled the beacon first, his hands sure, wiping grime from the lens, a massive glass eye that seemed to watch us, its hum deeper when he touched it, like it approved. “This thing’s alive, man,” he said, half-joking, his voice echoing in the tower, but his grin faded when the gears skipped, a groan that wasn’t mechanical, not quite. I stayed below, organizing supplies, stacking crates, my fingers brushing labels faded by salt, my mind on Riley’s whistle, steady, until it stopped, suddenly, his shout sharp, “Yo, come up here, something’s weird!” I ran, stairs clanging, finding him by the lens, his face pale, pointing at a crack, hairline, new, not there yesterday. “Swear it just moved,” he said, his voice low, his hand on my arm, tight. I looked, saw nothing, but the hum spiked, a note that hurt, and we backed down, fast, Riley muttering, “Probably nothing, right, just old junk.” But he didn’t whistle again, not that day, his eyes on the stairs, like they might follow.

Tor, the supply boat captain, came on day three, her skiff battling waves, crates of soup, rope, and fuel stacked high, her hands quick, unloading like she couldn’t wait to leave. She’s weathered, her face lined deep, her gray braid stiff, her eyes gray, sharp, like she’s staring through you, past you, to something waiting. She dropped the crates, her voice rough, “Light doesn’t stop, you hear, not ever.” I nodded, trying to be friendly, “Nice place, huh, you come here a lot?” She didn’t smile, her gaze cutting to Riley, who was stacking cans, his shirt damp, his hair a mess. “Stay close, both of you,” she said, softer, her jaw tight, like the words cost her. Riley looked up, grinning, “What, we got bears out here, Tor?” She didn’t laugh, just turned, her boots scraping, muttering, “Worse,” so low I barely caught it. I stepped closer, “What’s that mean, what’s worse?” but she was already at her boat, her hands shaking, untying ropes, gone before I could push, the fog swallowing her wake. Riley shrugged, wiping sweat, “She’s intense, man, probably hates people.” But his grin faded, his hand resting on his knife, tucked in his belt, as we hauled the crates inside, the air thicker, like it carried her words.

I tried talking to him about it, later, splitting bread by the stove, the room dim, the sea growled loudly through the walls. “Tor’s hiding something, you saw her eyes, right, like she’s scared,” I said, my voice low, my hands tearing crusts, restless. Riley leaned back, his chair creaking, his grin forced, “She’s old, probably seen storms, wrecks, you know, gets to you.” I shook my head, “No, it’s more, she meant something, worse than bears, come on.” He sighed, rubbing his neck, “What, you think she’s warning us about ghosts, pirates, what?” His laugh was thin, his eyes flicking to the window, where the fog pressed, heavy, close. “Maybe not ghosts,” I said, softer, “but something, you felt the beacon, didn’t you?” He nodded, slowly, “Yeah, felt like it was looking at me, stupid, but yeah.” We didn’t say more, just ate, the silence heavy, Riley’s hand brushing mine, quick, like he needed to know I was there.

The island wasn’t just quiet, it was alive, playing games we didn’t understand. We walked its paths, trails twisting through pines, their branches low, the cliffs sharp, dropping to reefs where the sea churned, foam curling like fingers. Riley kicked rocks, joking about diving, “Bet there’s fish down there you’d nerd out over, right?” His voice was light, but his eyes lingered on the water, scanning, uneasy, like he felt it too, the weight, the pull. Gulls swarmed, more than normal, their wings loud, their cries wrong, not squawks but wails, names, almost words, echoing in the fog. “These birds are freaks,” I said, trying to laugh, and Riley threw a stick, “Scram, weirdos!” but they didn’t budge, their eyes locked on us, yellow, unblinking, too many, too close. He grabbed my arm, “Let’s move, man, they’re giving me the creeps.” We hurried back, the cottage’s outline faint, the sea’s growl chasing us, louder, hungrier, Riley’s hand tight, his pulse fast against my wrist.

The next day, I found something else, not the logbook yet, but a sign, small, stupid, enough to twist my gut. I was checking the dock, making sure Tor’s ropes hadn’t frayed, when I saw it, a pebble, not random, placed dead center, carved with a spiral, tiny, perfect, like the ones I’d see later. I picked it up, cold, heavier than it should be, and showed Riley, my voice low, “This wasn’t here yesterday, right?” He frowned, turning it in his hand, “Nah, man, probably kids, some hikers, you know.” But his voice was off, his thumb tracing the spiral, his eyes on the sea, where the waves rolled, too smooth, too deliberate. “Kids don’t come here,” I said, and he nodded, dropping the pebble, “Yeah, okay, it’s weird, let’s just, let’s keep moving.” We didn’t talk about it again, but I kept it, tucked in my pocket, its weight a reminder, a question I couldn’t ask.

On day six, I found the logbook. I was dusting the keeper’s desk, its surface rough, when my cloth caught a hidden drawer, tucked tight, secret unless you felt for it. My heart kicked, a puzzle calling, and I shouted for Riley, my voice was sharp, “Yo, get in here, found something!” He jogged over, his boots loud, his hair wet from checking the beacon, his grin wide, “What, buried gold, captain?” He leaned close, his shoulder brushing mine, his warmth real, steady. I pried the drawer with his screwdriver, the wood groaning, and pulled out a book, not a record but something ancient, its leather cracked, smelling of rot and salt, its pages thick, curling, like they’d been soaked and baked dry. I opened it, expecting tide charts, but saw symbols, carved deep, spirals, waves, moons, stars with sharp points, a code scratched with a knife, not ink. Above them, in faded script, a warning: “To the Next Keeper. Heed or Drown.”

Riley sucked his teeth, his fingers tracing a spiral, his nail snagging, tearing the page, the rip loud, jarring. “Some old guy’s doodles, right, gotta be,” he said, but his voice cracked, his eyes flicking to the door, the sea’s roar spiking, sudden, close. I’m wired for mysteries, always decoding patterns for my research, so I grabbed my notebook, my hands itching, Riley hovering, his knee bouncing, his breath uneven. “You’re actually into this,” he said, half-laughing, but he didn’t move, stayed, watching as I worked, the symbols not random but deliberate, rituals tied to the island, commands with teeth, written by hands that shook, that ran. I decoded them, my pencil scratching, my voice low, scared I’d stir something, Riley’s silence heavy, his hand gripping the desk, like he needed an anchor.

Here’s what the logbook held, clear as a blade:
Scatter salt across the seaward window at dusk. Shadows swim in the deep, watching, waiting. Skip it, and they’ll slither through the glass.

Ring the fog bell three times at midnight, no more, no less. The mist hungers for sound, feeds on silence. Ignore it, and it’ll call your name.

Burn driftwood in the stove before dawn, every dawn. The cold craves warmth, your warmth. Let the fire die, and it’ll take your heat.

Seal the cellar hatch with wax when the moon rises. Whispers rise from below, seeking. Open it, and they’ll know your soul.

Trace a cross on the beacon’s glass at noon, with your breath, your hand. The light sees all, judges all. Forget it, and it’ll burn your eyes to ash.

Riley exhaled, hard, his knuckles white, “This is straight-up creepy, man, what’s with the warnings, who writes this?” I looked up, the window fogging, not breath but something else, the sea moving, not waves but shapes, faint, gone fast. “Dunno, but you heard the hum today, felt it, wasn’t just the gears,” I said, my throat tight. He nodded, slowly, “Yeah, like it’s alive, got eyes or something.” I pointed at the hatch, a trapdoor, dark, locked, “That one, the cellar, we're checking it?” He stepped back, “No way, you see that thing, looks cursed.” I swallowed, fear coiling, and he tried to laugh, “What, we gotta fight sea monsters now, you and me?” His hand landed on my shoulder, firm, but his eyes were scared, searching mine, needing me to say it’s nothing.
The logbook wasn’t done, its pages dense, symbols piling, some smudged, others slashed, like the writers turned on their own words. Notes scratched in margins, old hands, panicked, one from 1865, “Salt didn’t hold, she’s here,” another, 1927, “John’s voice, not his, God save me.” I shut it, my hands cold, Riley quiet, his jaw clenched. “We’re not playing this game, right,” he said, almost begging, his voice low, his grin gone. I wanted to agree, to burn the book, but the cottage shifted, the air heavy, the sea’s growl sharper, like it heard us. “Maybe just one, to be safe,” I said, soft, and he sighed, rubbing his face, “You’re nuts, man, but fine, I’m not leaving you to do it alone.” His loyalty, his fear, it cut me, deep, and I nodded, my throat burning, the logbook watching, waiting.

That night, I tried the first clue, Riley beside me, his knife gripped, not drawn but ready, his breath uneven. I took salt from Tor’s crate, coarse, heavy, and poured it across the seaward window’s sill, a shaky line, my fingers numb, the glass cold, the sea outside black, stirring, not natural, like eyes blinking under the surface. “This is stupid,” Riley whispered, his voice tight, but he didn’t move, his shoulder brushing mine, his warmth keeping me steady. The salt fell, and the sea’s roar softened, not stopped but hushed, like a beast turning away, its hunger elsewhere. We stood, frozen, the logbook on the table, open, its pages rustling though no wind stirred, the cottage’s silence louder, heavier, like it approved.

The next morning, the island pushed back. Riley was up first, brewing coffee, his hands steady, but his eyes kept drifting to the window, the sea beyond moving wrong, too slow, too smooth. “You sleep okay,” I asked, my voice rough, the logbook still on my mind, its symbols burned into my lids. He shrugged, pouring a mug, “Weird dreams, man, water everywhere, you shouting, couldn’t find you.” His grin was weak, his hand brushing mine, quick, like he needed to check I was real. I nodded, “Same, kept seeing that hatch, like it was calling.” He froze, coffee splashing, “Don’t say that, don’t even think about it, we’re not messing with that thing.” I wanted to push, to ask why he was so scared, but the fog bell rang, once, sharp, midday, no one near it, its clang cutting through us, Riley dropping his mug, the crash loud, coffee pooling like blood.
We ran to the dock, the bell still, rope untouched, the fog thick, curling around us, heavy, like it breathed. “What the hell was that,” Riley said, his voice sharp, his hand grabbing my sleeve, pulling me back. I didn’t know, couldn’t think, the clue ringing in my head, ring it three times, midnight, don’t miss. “We do it tonight, right, the bell,” I said, my throat dry, and he nodded, reluctant, “Yeah, fine, but this place, man, it’s wrong, you feel it.” I did, felt it in the air, the hum, the way the sea watched, but I didn’t say it, couldn’t, not with Riley’s eyes so wide, so scared.

That night, I rang the bell, three times, my hands slick, Riley beside me, his knife out now, glinting, the fog denser, pressing, like it wanted in. Each clang echoed, not fading but growing, the mist swirling, shapes forming, dissolving, Riley muttering, “This ain’t helping, man, it’s waking something.” I finished, the third ring heavy, and the fog stilled, not gone but waiting, the hum softer, approving, or mocking, I couldn’t tell. We backed to the cottage, Riley’s hand on my shoulder, “No more, okay, not tonight,” and I nodded, my heart pounding, the logbook’s weight in my pocket, pulling, always pulling.

The stove was next, the clue about driftwood, burn it before dawn, don’t let it die. We piled wood, Riley’s hands shaking, the flames weak, flickering blue, not right, Riley poking it, “This is crap, man, what’s with the color, you see this?” The smoke stung, curling toward the ceiling, shapes again, eyes, hands, gone when I blinked, my throat raw, Riley coughing, “We’re done, enough of this.” But we kept it burning, scared to stop, the cold outside heavier, pressing, like it wanted our warmth, our breath.
Yesterday, Riley vanished. He’d gone to fix a cliff marker, a rusted sign for ships, at dawn, his jacket loose, his grin soft, “Back soon, don’t hog the bacon,” winking, his boots fading into fog, his shape gone fast, too fast.

Noon came, no Riley, his tools by the door, his radio dead, static hissing, my hands shaking as I tried it, my voice breaking, “Riley, man, where you at, come on.” I searched, cliffs, beaches, caves, my throat raw, legs burning, shouting until the gulls answered, their cries his name, circling low, wings brushing me, cold, deliberate. Nothing, no trace, like he’d dissolved, like the island swallowed him whole.

Tor came at dusk, her boat loud, crates heavy, her face pale, eyes dodging mine. I ran to her, “Riley’s gone, Tor, he’s gone, you gotta help, call someone, please,” my voice cracking, hands grabbing her sleeve, desperate. She stood still, her jaw trembling, “Island keeps what it loves,” soft, like a wound she couldn’t close. I shook her, “What’s that mean, you know, tell me, what’s out there?” Her eyes hit the sea, waves stirring, too smooth, “That book’s theirs, boy, not yours, never was. Stop reading.” I screamed, “Whose, Tor, whose?” but she pulled free, her boat rocking, her voice low, “I told him, told you, don’t make me say it.” She was gone, fog closing, my shouts useless, the sea laughing, deep, real.

I stumbled to the cottage, the logbook open, a new clue waiting, ink wet, sharp, metallic: “Seek the tide’s edge for what’s lost.” My chest burned, hope and fear tangling, and I ran to the shore, flashlight dim, rocks gleaming, and there, in seaweed, Riley’s necklace, shark’s tooth glowing, not my light, something deeper, under the waves. I reached, and the water grabbed, cold, burning, pulling, my arm red, raw, when I broke free, the necklace sinking, the sea laughed louder, alive. I crawled back, skin stinging, the logbook waiting, pages turning, symbols shifting, Riley’s voice calling, not from the shore but everywhere, slow, wet, wrong.

Tor’s back tomorrow, maybe, but her words claw me, her fear, her secrets, like she’s watched this play out, like she’s next, or I am. The lighthouse hums, Riley’s name, twisted, pulling, the cottage waiting, always waiting. I’ve got my knife, flashlight, notebook, clues copied, hands shaking, ink smearing. I need Riley, his voice, his fight, but the island’s awake, and I’m not its keeper, I’m its prey. What’s in the tide, why me?


Update: The beacon’s singing, my name, my face, not mine.
