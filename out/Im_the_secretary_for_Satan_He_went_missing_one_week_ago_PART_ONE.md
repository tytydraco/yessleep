Its not unusual for demons to vanish for a while. My friend Plethorak was once gone for 2 months. But he was allowed to leave. When the Lord of Darkness himself vanishes without a trace, then things get hectic. Let me start at the beginning.

Many years ago, Satan had no trouble managing souls. Its not that hard when there isn't very many. You simply catch a soul as it comes up the River of Souls (on-point, I know), then feed it through a pipe to its Final Destination. But, obviously, with more souls, it becomes really hard to do this effectively without losing a soul or two. Eventually, souls were slipping through Satan's hands to the point where he was grabbing one out of a thousand. So, he started hiring.

Only one out of 10,000-100,000 souls ever received an offer. There were qualifications, after all. Certain benchmarks. I was never told what those were, just that they existed. At the time, I was a truck driver for a company who's name has long been forgotten. It was a rough night, and I had been drinking. I fell asleep at the wheel and woke up in a dark room. The Prince of Evil himself stood in front of me, and he extended his hand. I realized I could no longer speak, and all I could do was listen.

"Greetings. You are dead." He started. You know me as Satan. May I start by saying, congratulations! Your soul just barely met my qualifications. I have 2 offers for you. You can ignore both of them and go to Heaven and forever be known as World's Biggest Wuss, or you can take one. My first offer is as a pitkeeper. You would come down to Hell and work on keeping those souls in the lava for about 1000 years, and then you could keep it up for as long as you wanted or go to Heaven. But my second offer... is a little bit more thrilling."

"You see, I need someone to keep track of it all. To truly understand how Hell is working and let me know what's going on. You would be my personal secretary. Why you? I have no clue, but my gut is saying yes, so I'm giving you the offer. Give it 2000 years of work, and then you can go to Heaven at any time. So, what will it be? Option 1, wussing out?"

I shook my head no. Either way I'd be going to Heaven. But if I denied these offers, I would never know what Hell looked like. Curiousity got the better of me.

"Option 2, Pitkeeper?" My mind was made up. I shook my head no, yet again.

"Option 3, Secretary?" I shook my head yes. His bony fingers extended to give me a firm handshake. I took it, and the next thing I know, I stood at the top floor of Satans Palace. It stood at the center of a huge lake of lava. A single wooden bridge connected it to a field of 9 Circles, through which I could see massive containment centers. A river ran around the 9 Circles, a mysterious white river (The River of Souls, if you couldn't already guess.)

It took me 5 years to really get a feel for the job. I had a team of 13 underlings I could report to. Each of them had a certain department of Hell they were responsible for. 9 for the Circles, 2 for the River, and 2 for Escapee responsibilities, to alert me of any escaped prisoners. The 13 would go and do whatever I asked and bring me reports back, which was mainly how I made sure the River of Souls was in good order and the 9 Circles were maintained. I also was in charge of keeping Satan in line and wherever he needed to be, whenever he needed to be somewhere.

We also had a team of GHOST Operatives. The G Team, as we called them, were responsible for haunting and paranormal experiences, which is why some were allowed to leave Hell temporarily to go back to the real world. I've heard that it isn't anything special. You simply hide in shadows, then knock on walls and knock things over.

Our story starts on the 6th year, 6th month, and 6th day of my service. I woke up in my bed on the 99th floor of the 100 floor palace. I was one of the only demons lucky enough to have an entire floor in the palace. My bed was as comfy as comfy gets, but if you didn't get out in 5 minutes of waking up, you would never get out. I never ran it close. I got out of bed, put on my uniform (Satan let me wear whatever I wanted to, but I always chose something corporate so I could keep a routine), and shaved. I walked out to my lounge area, a semi circle overlooking it all. I sat on my couch, picked up the pile of reports sitting on my coffee table, then conjured a coffee and began to read. Normal, normal, and normal. All good. I went upstairs to wake up Satan. Even Lords of Darkness need wake up calls.

A sheet of darkness hit me as I stepped out of the elevator. Odd, but I had seen this before. He hadn't used this in a little while, though. I clapped my hands twice and the fog cleared. Now I could see where I was going. The Penthouse was a mess. Tables knocked over, glass broken. A fiery breeze was making its way in from a broken window. Suddenly, there was a bang from a nearby room. I ran to it as fast as I could.

I burst into Satan's bedroom. A lavish and royal space, only I was allowed in. Satan wasn't there. That was peculiar, but maybe he was just somewhere else in Hell. I called one of my 13 and asked them to check all of Hell for Satan's location. While he was checking, I searched the room, being careful not to look under Satan's bed (Who knows whats down there- better play it safe). The closet door was ajar. I walked over and threw it open. On the wall, where there should have been clothes, instead sat a bloody message. I screamed, then read it.

"ITS HERE. I CANT RUN." My blood turned cold. What could have frightened Satan himself this much? And if he couldn't run, where was he now? My hell-phone rang in my pocket, jumpscaring me. It was one of the 13! I answered it immediately.

"Sir. Satan is gone." A wheezy voice declared from the other side.

"What do you mean, gone?" I cried.

"He's just gone. We've checked everywhere. He cannot be found."

I dropped my phone. I knew the truth. Satan couldn't be found...

Because something found him. As I came to this realization, I heard a boom loud enough the shatter all of the windows of the palace. I exited the bedroom and looked outside. The entire Earth began to shake. I held on to anything I could as the palace tilted ever so slightly. Chairs began to slide. Anything small was falling. I gripped the wall as tight as I could and watched a bone-chilling sight.

You see, the 9 Circles are laid out so that there are 8 circles surrounding 1 middle circle. As I observed, the very top circle, Limbo, began to move. The ground cracked and shook, and then, in one solid motion, the entire Circle fell into the floor. All that was left behind was a void, a plain drop into nothing. Immediately, the shaking stopped and the Palace corrected itself. My phone began ringing on the floor of the other room. I walked back, picked it up, and answered the call.

Multiple calls came all at once. "Sir, one of the 13 just exploded!" "Sir, a Circle is missing!" "Sir, Satan is gone!"

I sat against a wall and did my best to calm down. But my legs began shaking. Out of fear? I couldn't tell. One of the 13, one of the 12 now, was gone forever. But how was that even possible? That shouldn't have been. But I needed to focus on one thing first:

Where the Hell is Satan?
