Flintridge is the kind of place you don’t find unless you’re already lost.

We don’t have a website.
No social media presence.
No highway billboards saying “Visit Beautiful Flintridge!” with pictures of waterfalls or smiling families.

If you ever do find yourself here, it’s because something brought you.
Something pulled you.

I was born here.
And I’ve tried to leave more times than I can count.

I always come back.
Sometimes I wake up in my bed without even knowing how.

But this isn’t about me.

It’s about what happens when the sun goes down.



I was sixteen when I first saw it happen.

At the time, there were whispers always whispers but nothing you could point to. Just things the older folks muttered at church, or the librarian slipped between sentences like they didn’t mean anything.

Things like:

“Never walk home after dark.”

“Always check the windows are locked before 9.”

“Don’t answer if someone knocks after midnight.”

The first rule they teach you as a kid?

Don’t go outside after sunset. Ever.

But I was sixteen.
And I was in love.

Her name was Marnie.
She was new.
Moved here with her mom after what she called a “bad year,” but she never told me more than that. She was sharp-eyed and wild in the way city girls are when they first move to the country. She said this place felt fake. Too quiet.

We used to sneak out to the old train tracks. She’d bring her dad’s cigarettes and a Polaroid camera, and we’d talk about music and death and dreams and pretend we weren’t trapped.

That night, we lost track of time.

The sky went orange…
Then pink…
Then dark.

I didn’t notice until she said, “What time is it?”

I looked at my phone.

8:52.

My stomach dropped.

We ran.

We were only five blocks from her house — maybe three minutes if we sprinted. But the second we turned the corner onto Sycamore Street, I felt it.

The air changed.
Thicker.
Quieter.

Like the world had swallowed its breath.

The street was empty.
No headlights.
No porch lights.

Just us.
And the dark.

Marnie whispered, “Something’s wrong.”
I didn’t answer.

Because I saw something.

Something standing at the end of the street.

Not someone.
Something.

It was tall easily over eight feet.
Thin.
Its arms hung low, past its knees.
Its head was crooked.
Like its neck had too many joints.

And it was watching us.
By some reason the name ”Peter” came to mind while watching it.

We ran again.
Harder.
Faster.
Marnie was in front. I remember that detail because I saw it lunge from the side street.

I never even heard it.

One second she was running.

The next?

She was gone.

Like she was plucked from the air.

No scream.
No sound.
Just… nothing.


I didn’t stop.
I don’t even remember running all the way home.
I just remember slamming the front door, locking every bolt, and sinking to the kitchen floor while my mother stood frozen at the sink.

Her first words?

Not “What happened?”
Not “Where’s Marnie?”

She just said:

“You were lucky. Peter often goes for girls first.”

I asked what she meant by that, and where ”Peter” had taken Marnie and she just said

”Their getting married”


Marnie was never found.
No search parties.
No missing posters.

Her mother claimed she ran away.
The cops didn’t even file a report.

I asked her mom once weeks later what she really thought.
She just looked at me and said:

“You weren’t supposed to see that.”
“They don’t like being seen.”



After that night, things changed.
I started noticing patterns.

For example:
Every month, on the 13th, someone new would disappear.
Always at night.
Always quietly.

Sometimes it was a kid.
Sometimes a teacher.
Once, the mayor.

Never any bodies.
No blood.
Just gone.

We don’t have a cemetery in Flintridge.
Never needed one.

The dead don’t stay.
The missing don’t return.



I confronted my dad once.
He was drunk slurring, angry, emotional.
Perfect timing.

I asked, “Why don’t people leave this place?”

He stared at me a long time.
Then said:

“Because it follows.”
“You can’t run from something that lives in silence.”

When I pressed him further, he told me about a town meeting he went to in the ‘80s. Said it wasn’t a real meeting not the kind with minutes and coffee.

It was a deal.

A negotiation.

The townspeople had been desperate. Children were vanishing. People were losing their minds. And one night, the lights in the entire town blinked out for exactly seven seconds.

When they came back on, there was a figure in the center of the town square.

No face.
No voice.
Just a tall shape in black, standing so still it looked like part of the statue.

My father said everyone heard the same message not aloud, but inside:

“Give me what you can spare, and I will let the rest stay.”

Ever since then, the rules were followed.
The disappearances were accepted.
No police.
No outsiders.

Just tribute.


I’ve tried leaving three times.

The first time, my car broke down twenty miles out. I woke up the next morning in my bed.

The second time, I made it all the way to a motel two towns over. That night, I dreamed of Marnie. She was standing in my hallway, mouthing something I couldn’t hear.

I woke up back home.
Nose bleeding.
Door locked from the inside.

The third time, I didn’t even try. I just packed a bag and walked.

I got as far as the edge of the forest before I heard it.

A knock.
Three of them.
On a tree.

When I turned, it was there.

Watching.

It had no eyes.
But I felt it staring.

I dropped the bag and walked home.



I don’t know why I’m writing this.
No one will believe me.
You’ll think this is just another creepy story on the internet.

But if you’re reading this and you find yourself passing through a small town with no streetlights, no billboards, and houses with curtains drawn tight even during the day, please find me! I wanna get out of here

But if night time arrives while your here, either fall asleep or run.

Because Flintridge isn’t a town.
It’s a trap.
A mouth waiting to close.

And once night falls…
It feeds.
