Everyone did it.

Carson, Gare, Leo and I were all bored to death that summer in our small sleepy corner of suburbia. The worst day of my life took place just before we went our separate ways. It was late May, right after our high school graduation, and we were all antsy to get the hell out of Hayfield. Now, I would give anything to go back.

One afternoon, the four of us were sprawled out on Gare's back porch, sipping cold sodas and yapping on about nothing as we often would on those hot, muggy days when no one felt like moving.

It was Carson's idea.

"We need to go swimming," she declared suddenly, not lifting her head from my lap. "Chloe, let's take your truck."

All the usual conversation topics had been worn out by then. We'd decided that Leo would make the coolest grandpa, Gare had the most game, I was the best getaway driver, and that we would throw Carson to the zombies first in the event of an apocalypse.

So, we agreed. It was time to get out.

The drive to the falls was baking hot, but it became more bearable once I got the janky AC going and turned up the radio. As we left Hayfield proper the usual signals didn't carry so I switched it to some random oldies station and let it play. Gare sang along in his pitchy but charming way—*Come on baby, don't fear the reaper, baby take my hand*—until the tune was entirely eaten by static.

We all knew Gare played up his lover-boy persona to get us laughing. He used to be so shy. In that moment, I was struck by how good it was to see him grab the spotlight. Over those four years, we'd all done some growing up in our own ways, I thought.

As the song faded into garbled fuzz, we could hear bits of other signals bleeding through.

It was then, clear as day, that a man's voice on the radio said:

"FALL."

Nothing but static followed. No one mentioned it. Looking back I'm not sure if anyone else even heard it. I turned the radio off.

I think that's when we started playing truth or dare. If you chose dare, Carson explained, you would be given a special mystery dare once we reached the falls. Gare and Leo both chose dare. I chose truth.

"Have you ever kissed anyone?" Carson asked from her place in the passenger seat. I kept my eyes on the road but I could hear her grinning through the words. I hadn't. I also didn't want to sound like a total virgin.

"Yeah."

"Who?" I made a sharp turn as the winding rural road bent violently to the left. Gare fell almost all the way onto Leo's lap, the two of them packed into the truck's tiny backseat space. Leo cussed, rubbing his forehead where it had collided with Gare's. They laughed like fools at this.

"You wouldn't know them," I lied. "They already graduated."

"They?" Carson pressed. I'd clearly set myself up for more interrogation.

"That's what I said," I replied without looking at Carson. I wasn't giving her more ammunition. She let out a dissatisfied huff but turned her attention to the road instead as it changed from pavement into dirt. We were almost there.

That thin dirt road through the woods soon opened up into a small makeshift parking area which usually turned into a soup of mud in the rainy season. Today it was mostly dry. It was also completely empty. This was strange for a typical summer afternoon. The place was secluded, sure, but it was still a hot spot for just about every student and alum of Hayfield High.

"Sweet, we've got the place to ourselves," said Gare, waggling his eyebrows. "You know what that means..."

"Gross," Carson said with mock disgust, yanking Gare's baseball cap down over his eyes.

Carson and I hopped out onto the dirt first, then shoved the front seats forward to let the guys clamber out. Next, we stripped down to our bathing suits and sprayed every inch of our bodies with bug spray. That was just protocol around here to ward away the constant plague of mosquitos and horseflies.

It was a short hike to the promised land. We picked our way through the dense forest, pushing aside clumps of brambles and wisteria. It looked almost like a tunnel, the way the vines choked the trees and curled into each other above our heads. Bits of Spanish moss hung down from low oak boughs, prickling my skin as I trudged along. The air was thick here, peaty and sweet.

As the rushing of the falls grew closer, a hush fell over the four of us, as if these were hallowed grounds. Looking back, I think they were.

Incruenta Falls. No one knew why they called it that, but everyone agreed that's what it was called. The entrance used to have an informational plaque tacked onto a wooden post, but it had long since fallen down and worn away, taking its history with it.

The falls themselves were pretty, but not anything to write home about, just shelves of rock stacked around twenty feet high. Frothy fresh water trickled down into a round swimming hole surrounded by flat boulders that were the ideal size and shape for spreading out towels and picnic blankets. The water was a translucent dark brown. It always reminded me of over-steeped tea.

When the trees parted, Gare sprinted past us and took a flying leap into the hole with a whoop, disappearing beneath the surface. Leo took off running after him, executing a perfect cannonball that splashed me, Carson, and our towels.

"That's it, you're dead!" Carson dropped the things she was carrying and jumped in to exact her vengeance. I was left with our stuff. I soon found a good wide rock jutting out into the water, and began unfolding an old blanket as Gare swam over.

"Last one in is a rotten egg," he said, leaning on the rock with his elbows, "and you're getting rottener by the minute, Chlo."

I splashed him in the face. As I did, I noticed something. The water felt weirdly warm, like a hot bath. My fingertips tingled. Soon, my entire hand felt numb. Like static. I jerked it away.

No one else seemed bothered, so all I said was, "Okay, just give me a minute. I need more bug spray."

But as I said this, I noticed something else. I could not see or feel a single insect in the air. Normally the place was teeming with small clouds of gnats, water bugs, dragonflies, and of course the ever-present mosquitos and horseflies. It was an entire ecosystem unto itself.

Today, the swimming hole was in utter stasis. I don't know what else to say other than that it was deeply wrong. I found myself wondering if we'd taken a wrong turn. It felt so foreign, like a completely different place from the one I'd spent so many summers hanging around. No. The same toppled signpost had been there, I was sure of it. Why was everything so dead?

I did notice a few abandoned towels scattered about on the rocks. It was at least comforting to know that people had recently been here. Seeing this, I tried to push the thought from my mind, but I could not bring myself to get into the water just yet.

At some point, someone brought up the game again.

Carson and I dared Leo to jump from a thick oak branch overhanging the deepest part of the hole. He scrambled up the slick bark without a second thought.

*FALL*. My heart lurched. The voice from the radio played in my head, over and over, but Leo kept his balance. He stood straight up on the branch proudly, and pointed at us with an exaggerated wink. Then he jumped.

I held my breath, waiting for Leo to resurface.

We waited for a long, measured moment, and I remember thinking how I'd never forgive myself if something terrible happened.

Leo broke the surface with a gasp. He hauled himself out of the water, collapsing onto the rock belly-up. He was laughing, but he seemed different.

"You good?" I asked. He met my eyes and for that split second, seemed panicked. I've never seen him so terrified.

"Yeah. What a rush," Leo breathed. He stood, turning away from me. "Gare, you're up next, man."

Carson dared Gare to climb the falls. Leo seconded this idea. I chose to remain silent. I wish I hadn't. Gare folded his arms and squinted up at the stack of rock.

"How far are we talking?" he asked, eyeing the challenge. "All the way?"

"It's ok if you're scared," Carson said with that saccharine smile of hers.

"Hell no," Gare said, and began to climb.

As he did, I turned to Leo. Again, I asked if he was ok. He shrugged, not taking his eyes off of Gare, who was slowly picking his way up the slimy first shelf of the falls.

Leo finally opened his mouth. "I think there are people down there." My stomach churned. I searched his face for some sign of a joke. He looked down at me, stone-faced, as if daring me to call his bluff. "They tried to take me."

That's when Gare fell. Carson gave a sort of strangled yelp as our friend missed his foothold and teetered backwards, slipping into empty air.

*FALL*. That word kept repeating in the back of my mind.

I swear, it took forever for Gare to hit the water.

I can still picture his body floating there in the air, headfirst with no hope of bracing for impact, Leo screaming his name from the shore. I felt like I should've somehow predicted this outcome, and yet I'd done nothing to stop it.

Gare was swallowed up by the black water of Incruenta Falls.

We waited and waited.

He did not resurface.

The thing that has always bothered me most about Gare's death is this: they never found a body. I remember hearing that the recovery team dug up nothing but mud from the bottom of that swimming hole.

There was no casket at his funeral. Afterwards, Carson, Leo and I sort of lost touch. It just wasn't the same without Gare.

I've been trying to record everything I can remember about that day. Now that a few years have gone by, I feel like I can think about it again without spiraling into depression. Maybe if I finally get it all out, I can put it behind me for good.

I recently asked my parents about the whole Gare situation to confirm the details. They had no idea who I was talking about. I've checked the newspaper archives, public records, even drove by his parents' house. It was foreclosed.

It doesn't feel like my friend died a violent death. It feels like he never existed. He simply faded away. Looking back on those years and knowing I can't call up any of those friends today, it feels like we all did.

I've tried to get in touch with Carson and Leo again. Neither of them seem to be on social media at all. Nothing comes up in search results when I type their names. All I know is that they don't live in Hayfield anymore. At the risk of sounding too crazy, it's like somehow that blackwater washed them out of this world too.

On a different, happier day at the falls, as the four of us skipped stones and passed around a bottle of cheap wine, Carson posed a question.

"What does incruenta mean anyway?" she'd asked idly, taking a long swig from the bottle.

"It's when something's bloodless," Leo had answered, chucking a huge stone into the water. It sank instantly, barely leaving a splash in its wake. "Like a war with no bloodshed."

Gare had laughed at this. "Sounds like every day to me," he'd said. I've always wondered what he meant by that.

An update: I woke up this morning, reached for my alarm, and felt that something had been lost. There was no trace of damage at all, just a clean, smoothed over absence beginning at my wrist.

My left hand is gone.

It seems that when I touched the water all those years ago, it took a part of me with it. Why now, after all this [time](https://www.reddit.com/user/3_Magpies/comments/1n1wlbl/3magpies_story_masterpost/)?
