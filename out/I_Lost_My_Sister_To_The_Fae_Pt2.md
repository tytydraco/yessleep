[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/YAZhXx43vj)

As soon as I stepped into the Otherworld, everything felt utterly, utterly wrong. 

First of all, the colors were sickeningly vibrant and over-saturated, it hurt my eyes as they slowly adjusted to the brightness of my environment. It was like I was thrown into a cartoon, but it was extremely unpleasant. The wilderness there was  untamed, the grass overgrown and splattered with patches of luminescent flowers, the foliage was thick as anything and the trees were intimidatingly tall, making me feel like an ant under their giant shadows. The terrain wasn't flat like the woods at home, it was hilly and generally uneven. Vines and ivy adorned everything in sight, this forest was unrestrained in every way and the most beautiful display of nature I'd ever seen. 

Not only that, but when I looked up at the sky, towards a strange warbling sound that may have been a species of bird I'd never heard before, it was the deepest and most unnatural dark blue I'd ever seen in my entire life. The stars were big and bright like little suns, golden and shimmering, with swirls of gold specks trailing through the sky like the milky way. They seemed to rotate and pulse as if they were living and breathing things. 

This was all very breathtaking, but as soon as I entered that deceivingly beautiful realm, I was hit with a nauseating sense of wrongness that made every bone in my body ache to run back through the portal. 

I felt very unwelcome. I felt like I had just wandered into a random stranger's house and made myself comfortable as I waited for them to get home and discover me there, vulnerable and offensive. It felt like the universe itself was whispering to my mind that this land was strictly forbidden to me, and as a deeply unwanted visitor, I should make my business there quick or else something terrible would happen to me. Could you imagine being in a world so foreign to humanity that your primal instincts were screaming at you to leave as soon as possible? 

Each step forward was easier than the last, but that's not to say my defiance against the unspoken rules of this world was a walk in the park. It was like walking into a bear’s den, and by God I hoped I wouldn't be noticed. I just kept thinking of Zoe. Her face, her laugh, her innocence, and the way she vyed desperately for my attention as if I was the greatest person there was. She didn't deserve to be stuck in a place that felt so god awful to be in, and I was still determined to find her. 

I didn't know the first place to look, but I took out one of my sandwiches and left a trail of breadcrumbs in my wake a la the story of Hansel and Gretel. I didn't want to lose the portal. The distant trees faded into blue gloom like they were hidden by fog. I flinched as a giant moth-looking creature  with moss growing on its sickly green wings fluttered past my face. 

After a while of walking, I feared the bread crumbs would not last, but then I heard a babbling brook, or in other words, running freshwater nearby. 

Treading up a small hill laden with moss like a blanket, I came across a stream. Just like everywhere else, it was teeming with life. The water was clear and blue like the type you'd see at a tropical beach, the surface scattered with lily pads. Toads croaked, and a persistent buzzing from various insects filled the air. That's when I started to notice just how… dreamlike everything felt. I felt like none of this was real the longer I stayed there, like I was perusing through some great wonderland my imagination had cooked up and I was invincible, because after all I would simply wake up just fine the next morning no matter what happened. 

I traveled along the bank, feeling light and airy like I had just breathed in that happy gas at the dentist’s, until I heard that same harp music. It lilted through the thick air like a lullaby, contributing to my growing delusion that I was stuck in a dream. I followed the music, the brook wrapped around a bend and when I rounded it, a woman sitting on a rock on the bank came into view. 

I stopped in my tracks and stared, fear shooting through me and bringing me closer down to earth as I processed what I was witnessing. 

The woman was clearly not human, although she resembled one. Her skin and hair were unnaturally white, paper white at that, and almost seemed to shimmer and glow in the blue light bathing the forest. Her hair was so long it trailed behind her in wild tangles like a bridal train,  and her long gown was just as white as her, she damn near looked like a phantom. She glowed softly like a star, and her gaze was trained on the water as she beautifully played the silver harp she held in her hands. 

I stepped back behind a tree, my instincts screaming at me that this woman meant danger, the same way they screamed at me to leave this strange realm earlier. Once again, something seemed to whisper to my mind that I was not welcome, especially not by this pale female humanoid who seemed too ethereal and pure-looking to truly be good. Her almost angelic appearance felt like a trap, much like the heavenly music. 

I watched her play the harp, and as she did, the water in front of her started to stir with movement. What looked like fish rose to the surface and started flipping and popping out the water like popcorn in a kettle, as if in reaction to the music. A basin I didn't notice before was at the woman's feet, and the fish toppled inside. It seemed to me that she had charmed them with this strange melody, and now they would become her dinner. 

I watched in disgust as she picked one out of the wooden basin and dangled it over her mouth, which gaped open unnaturally wide. She dropped the wriggling creature inside and seemed to swallow it whole, because I couldn't see her chew. If I was ever uncertain about her lack of humanity before, I definitely wasn't now: no human would eat a fish like that, still living with its scales still on, and no human could open their mouth that wide either. 

The woman rose to her feet, and from her back, unfolded two brownish-black dragonfly-like wings that buzzed obnoxiously loud and beat themselves so rapidly they became a blur.  They seemed to withdraw from the back of her dress, which was open revealing her colorless flesh, as if materializing out of thin air, because I hadn't noticed them before. 

Something landed on my shoulder and the sensation frightened me enough without me looking to see a spider bigger than my face, purple like a grape and spotted with blue, skittering down my arm with thin spindly legs connected to a fat body. I wanted to scream to the top of my lungs but I merely gasped and brushed it off. 

Still, that gasp was too loud. 

I heard a high pitched chirp, and it definitely wasn't a bird, rather it came from the woman, and it sounded like nothing a human could replicate with their mouth. I remained hidden behind the tree, my hand over my mouth. This ‘dream’ was beginning to look like a nightmare. 

I heard the buzzing sounds grow closer, slowly, as the winged humanoid intelligently tried to sneak up on me without knowing exactly where I was. As if it knew I was prey waiting to be caught. 

The weird spider rushed out into the open, away from my feet, and I heard another unearthly chirp, much much closer this time, as it caught the woman's attention. 

It took everything in me not to scream and run as the faery pounced on the creature, diving onto the ground like a wild cat and closing her long-fingered hands over it. It struggled in her grasp as she forced it into her mouth. 

She was so close to me that I could lean over and touch her if I was truly crazy enough, and if she simply looked to her right and just a little behind her, she would see me. She buzzed like a fly and happily chirped and squawked like a weird mix of bird and insect as she feasted. At this proximity, I could see the blue-green veins under her skin, and little spidery feelers or legs sprouting around her wings and wiggling like fine hairs blowing in the wind, if each hair had a mind of its own. 

I was frozen to that spot in horror. The faery stood to her full height of seven feet, the arachnid's legs hanging out of her mouth. 

Silently, with my hands over my mouth, I stepped around to the other side of the tree before she could turn and see me.  I was shaking with the adrenaline that coursed through my body. I heard the buzz of her wings as she departed, and I chanced another peek at her to see her gathering the basin. She carried it further away down the bank, flying and ignoring the water sloshing over the sides. It was then that it struck me… 

That thing resembled Zoe's drawing of Boza, except it was an adult version. 

Not giving myself a chance to think it through, I followed the fae creature quietly, sticking to the cover of the trees as she or it traveled alongside the stream. The stream led to a wide open meadow with a stone cottage. The cottage was practically one with the nature around it, covered in plants with many of those mossy, giant moths drifting around the lantern lights hanging from hooks on the exterior walls.  I watched from the shadow of a giant tree as the faery brought the basin inside what appeared to be her home.  

Even from where I was hiding at the edge of the treeline, I could hear the laughter of what sounded like a child ringing out through the meadow. 

*Zoe. It has to be.*

A tiny bit of water hit my cheek and I looked in confusion at the stream close to me. A small human the size of my hand was peeking at me from behind a rock halfway submerged in water. Upon closer inspection, I realized that the stream was not filled with fish, but mermaid-like creatures that were half fish and half human. Think of a pixie, then imagine if mermaids were the size of pixies and had gray scaly minnow tails. The dopey smile of the little creature made it clear its head contained no thoughts as it pursed its lips and playfully squirted water at me again. 

The fact the fae woman ate such an adorable creature alive solidified her cruelty in my eyes. 

The stream ran through the meadow and opened up into a lake. I crept across the wild grass and around the side of the cottage. I peeked through a window and saw an earth shattering sight that made me want to cry on the spot. 

There was Zoe, in a gilded cage in the center of the room I was looking in. She sat curled up behind the golden bars, her fairy costume looking dirty and ripped and her teary eyes showing just how scared she was. And there, taunting her on the other side of the bars, was what I had thought was a figment of her imagination once: Boza. She was basically a miniature version of the fae woman, white like a ghost and wearing a pale blue frilly dress that you'd be mocked for for your outlandish sense of fashion if you wore it in the human world. 

Boza threw things at Zoe like various fruits, watching hungrily for her reaction, and reached through the bars to yank furiously at her brown hair when my sister didn't give her an entertaining enough response. Nearby, the fae woman was sitting at the table near a cauldron with boiling water above a fire pit. She was taking the small mermaids and preparing them with a sharp knife like how you would fish, scaling their tails and gutting not just the fish part but the human part as well, pulling their innards out and discarding them. She started the grisly process by lopping off their little heads, which rolled off the table and plopped to the stone floor, looking for all the world like bloody Barbie doll heads from my viewpoint. 

Being this close, I could see the eyes of the faery mother and daughter duo. They were slanted and pitch black, reminding me of an alien's, and the skin around them was tinted bright red as if they had been crying. Their jawlines and cheekbones were sharp and pronounced, and their noses just a bit too long. Despite their unsettling appearances, they were beautiful in a strange way. 

Suddenly, Boza went over to the adult one, and tugged her sleeve. Their lips were moving but I couldn't make out what they were saying. Whatever the fae woman said, it made Boza happy, and she flounced out of the room and returned with a golden collar connected to a long matching chain. I watched with horror as the fae woman stood, produced a key hanging from the necklace she was wearing, unlocked the cage, took the collar from Boza, and fixed it around Zoe's throat as if she were some common dog. 

Rage simmered inside me as Boza excitedly tugged Zoe towards the front door by the chain leash. My little sister had no choice but to follow, wiping tears from her face. When she walked too slow, Boza pulled harder and nearly choked her. The door opened, releasing the sounds of Zoe's quiet weeping and Boza’s humming from the building as they entered the meadow. I watched behind the corner of the cottage as the fae girl flew towards the lake, tugging my sister behind her like a pet. Desperate to not be seen, I crawled through the tall grass after them. My belly slid over the soil and sweat made my hair stick to my face. My backpack jostled on my back and my fingernails clawed through the wild growth as I frantically tried to think of a plan to rescue Zoe from this bizarre situation. 

“No!” Zoe cried. “I can't swim!” 

I lifted myself up a bit to peer over the grass blades. Boza was flying above the lake like an overgrown housefly, and trying to force Zoe into the water by violently yanking the leash. She seemed to be stronger than my sister, who was fighting hard to not be pulled to the center of the lake but was ultimately losing as she was dragged deeper and deeper. From ankle deep to knee deep then stomach-level. 

“Go on, play in the water!” Boza's exasperated voice, which sounded like any child's, except maybe a bit deeper in pitch, commanded. “You're my pet so you have to do what I say! And I want you to swim like a good little human!” 

“No! You'll kill me!” Zoe wailed, gripping the chain and pulling. The water was up to her chest now, soon it would be at her chin. Zoe really couldn't swim, and if this continued, she would drown. 

Sparing a glance at the cottage where the mom was, I burst into a run towards the bank. Boza and Zoe looked at me. Boza seemed surprised and confused at my appearance but my sister exploded into hysterics immediately. 

“Nina!” She reached for me, her face scrunched up as she sobbed. 

“Ni-na?” Boza repeated, frowning. 

I waded into the water, determined to save her. When I reached Zoe, I grabbed the chain and helped her pull with all my might. We pulled like we were playing a game of tug of war. Boza gasped as she nearly dropped down to our level, then she started pulling, too, flying backward and trying to drag us deeper into the lake. 

However, she was no match for both of us, and soon she went plummeting into the water. With a final yank, I released the gold leash from her stubborn grip, and reeled it towards me until I had it all bunched up in my hands. Then, I grabbed Zoe by the arm and dragged her towards shore. I heard a splash and looked behind me as I went. 

Boza resurfaced, soaked, and her face was balled up. She burst into tears, but when she wailed, it was a piercing cry, a pathetic little screech that rang out into the air and echoed all around us. 

Then, it was promptly followed by a piercing caterwaul that reminded me of a bird of prey. Zoe and I tensed as we stood on the bank dripping water. 

The cottage door banged open and the fae mother crawled over the wall and onto the roof before erupting in flight like an angered wasp emerging from its net. Before I knew it, she shot towards us like a bullet and landed heavily inches away from our shivering forms. She had grown grotesque, her pearly flesh now gray and a deep scowl marring her face.  Her gray skin faded into black towards her hands and feet, as if she had dipped the limbs into ink, and a network of now black veins were visible under her skin. Zoe screamed and hugged my side.

The fae mother roared much like a jaguar and her clawed fingers reached to ensnare my head. Yes, my head, I didn't even want to think of what she would've done to my head had I let her, perhaps pull it off my shoulders? 

Thinking quickly, I grabbed the crescent moon-shaped iron pendant dangling over my chest and raised it towards her. Reflexively, the monster recoiled, and regarded me warily. 

*“Iron...”* Her deep, alluring yet quiet voice dripped with disdain. 

“Yes, iron.” I tried to hide how terrified I was as I stepped around the fae mother, one hand clutching my sister to me and the other holding the iron towards the monster to keep her at bay. 

The fae mother growled unlike any animal I've heard before, it was a croaky and raspy sort of noise she drew deep from her throat. She seemed like she wanted to attack me, but her eyes never left the pendant in my hand. 

“What's your name?” 

“What's yours?” I dodged the question, having read that it wasn't wise to give the fae your name. 

“Aurdone.” She replied, and it sounded like or-doe-n, my spelling of this is simply a guess at how you would spell such a strange name, and ‘Ordone’ seemed to already exist in the English dictionary. “And yours?” 

“You should check on your kid.” I said, once more avoiding answering the question. “And…sorry. I have to take my sister.” 

Aurdone looked towards the lake and cried out haughtily. *“Boza, your wings…!”* 

As soon as she flew towards her child, I fled with Zoe, intending to get as far away as possible. We followed the stream at first, then the bread crumbs, all the way back to that tree arch gateway that led back home. It might've taken maybe 10 or 15 minutes. 

“Yes!” I was ecstatic as I went through the portal first, holding Zoe's hand and pulling her behind me. 

Zoe cried out in pain and a force propelled her backwards from the portal. I watched her slowly get up from the other side, confused. 

“What are you doing?” I asked. 

“It wont let me go through!” Zoe panicked as she tried to step through to my side again, only for the collar to constrict around her throat and once again send her flying back. She gasped and gagged, clawing at the collar until it loosened its vice grip. Tears wet her face as she looked at me pleadingly. “Nina, don't leave me here…” 

I looked behind me, at the woods which seemed comfortingly boring compared to the Otherworld’s mysterious woodlands. They were definitely easier on the eyes and the feeling of trespassing was lifted from me like lifting an anchor off my back. But I was definitely not going to go back home without my sister, especially not after seeing what she had been enduring all this time, so I walked back through into the Otherworld and hugged her.

After she was consoled and her tears started to dry, I inspected the golden collar around her neck. It was reflective and featureless other than a big keyhole in the center, but it didn't exactly look like advanced technology or anything. 

“I think it's magic…” Zoe whimpered. “We'll never be able to get it off. I don't wanna stay here, Nina, I don't like fairies anymore. They're scary and mean and they get really ugly when they're mad. They want to keep me trapped forever. I thought she was my friend but she wanted to keep me as a pet the whole time.” 

She sniffed and looked ready to burst into tears again. If we wanted to make it out of this mess, we both needed to pull together.

“Zoe, listen to me.” I knelt down in front of her and grasped her shoulders, looking deep into her eyes. “This is a dream, okay? Doesn't it feel like one?” I smiled as she nodded. “Everything will be okay… As long as I have this, she won't hurt us.” I showed her the pendant. “The fae hate iron, just one touch is agony to them, and wearing it repels them. Listen, did she use that same key that she used for the cage for this collar?” 

Zoe thought for a moment, then nodded. My heart sank to my shoes. “That's around her neck… Maybe she'll set it down somewhere after a while… But we have to go back to that house.”

At this, Zoe vigorously shook her head, her tangled and dirty hair shaking with it. Up close, I could see the dirt smudging her cheeks, mixing with the trails of tears. She smelled awful, too, after all she'd been gone for weeks, so they clearly hadn't bathed her. I smoothed her hair to comfort her as she started breathing hard. 

“It's okay, I promise. Your big sister is here to protect you, and this is just a dream. You're the brave warrior princess, just without your noble unicorn.” 

I looked around quickly and spotted some flowers. Working fast, I tied their stems clumsily together to weave a flower crown, and then put it on her head. I watched as she shrugged the fake wings off her back and ground them into the dirt with the heel of her flat. She put on a fake brave face. “So instead of defeating the witch, we'll defeat the… evil fairy?” 

I nodded, standing up and holding her hand again. “Exactly, it's your dream after all. Now let's go.” 

We made it back to the edge of the meadow where the cottage sat, witnessing strange bugs and hearing strange animal sounds along the way. The faeries weren't in sight, so it was safe to assume they were inside. We snuck over to the same window I was looking through before to see that Boza was drying her wings by the fire, sitting with her back to it and entertaining herself with wooden dolls. 

Then there was Aurdone…she was talking to a monster we had not seen yet. She looked pissed off, but that grotesque transformation she took on earlier was gone. 

The monster was a more terrifying sight, despite simply being a blood red hooded cloak floating a foot off the floor. But that was the dreadful part: we couldn't see it's face, its hood was long and dangled down over his head like a curtain to the point I was sure there was no way it could even see what was in front of it. It was short but being able to levitate to Aurdone’s height made it intimidating still, and long black arms that look like gnarled tree branches  stretched out from the cloak and grasped a large, sharp scythe in front of it. 

“What is that?” I whispered, my heart racing as I felt a terrible, sickening dread twist my gut into knots. 

“I dunno.” Zoe whispered back in a shaky voice.  “I've never seen that before.”

Aurdone, in the middle of conversing with this strange monster, gave it a familiar looking butterfly barrette. I looked at Zoe's loose hair and realized it was hers, and she realized it at the same time as me and gently touched her head where it would usually be. The hooded monster took the barrette with black, clawed fingers and brought it under its hood. I couldn't be sure, but I swear, I could see its shoulders lift and lower ever so slightly…

It was taking a whiff of my sister's hair clip. 

The monster nodded and Aurdrone grinned sinisterly. The hooded thing started to levitate past her but then stopped. The hood raised towards the ceiling and its body heaved with each heavy sniff it took of the air. 

Then it looked right at us, in the window. 

“Run!” I cried, grabbing Zoe's hand and hurtling towards the woods in terror, in the opposite direction of where we came. 

I dared not look behind me, but I heard the cottage door open and the sound of what I could only describe as a tree being split. As if a lumberjack had severed the trunk of an enormous tree and it was releasing a deafening creak and groan as it fell over. That was the sound of the hooded monster calling out animalistically, almost like a war cry, as it followed us. When we broke the treeline, I glanced behind us and saw it flying towards us, its cloak flapping in a non-existent strong wind. Its scythe was raised threateningly and I had no doubt it intended to kill us.

Zoe and I ran, and the uneven and rough terrain of the Otherworld's forest felt like going through an obstacle course. We leaped over logs and narrowly avoided falling into ditches and small ponds. The air felt thick, like I was traveling through gel, and it all truly and very literally felt like a bad dream. Nonetheless, I ran like my life depended on it, because deep down I knew this was all really happening. The thick tree trunks helped obscure us from our unearthly pursuer and the cacophony of otherworldly wildlife sounds drowned out our panting and footsteps. 

Zoe stopped running suddenly and collapsed, her breaths shallow. “I can't…. I can't breathe…” 

“Come on, just a little further…” I begged as I pulled her to her feet, hearing the loud rustling of the monster's cloak get closer.  

“I can’t run anymore…” Zoe wheezed, her face flushed red and sweat covering her little body. “Go without me… they want me alive, but they'll probably kill you.” 

My eyes watered as I gawked at my little sister. My selfish spoiled brat of a sister was telling me to save myself and leave her on her own with a monster after us. I thought about all the horrible things I had said to her back home, and how much I treated her like a nuisance, and I trembled with the weight of my guilt. 

*“Over here!”*

We both gasped as a little boy called out to us from the distance. And no, not a faery boy, a normal human child, even from our viewpoint we could see his skin was fair, maybe even a little tanned, and he had messy brown bangs scattered over his forehead. No wings to be seen at all. He waved his arms wildly, and frantically gestured for us to follow him. 

“Hurry!” 

Zoe and I bolted towards him as we heard the ear-splitting roar of the monster nearby which sounded like lumber being sawed and a tree being felled, accompanied by the sound of its cloak rustling. When we got closer, I realized the boy was maybe a couple years older than Zoe, perhaps 9 or 10. Once we were only a few feet away, he removed a large flat rock from the base of the giant tree he was standing by. Under the rock was a deep hole in the ground, which he jumped inside. 

“In here!” He whispered, before ducking through and disappearing. 

Seeing a flash of red fabric rippling in a wind in the distance, I pushed Zoe down into the hole and followed in after her. Once I was under, I dug my fingers into the grooves of the rock and slid it back over the opening to hide us from view.  

The hole led to an underground tunnel. The drop wasn't steep, and it sort of curved into this channel which was only big enough for Zoe to stand in, but the boy and I had to slightly crouch to fit. It was surprisingly well lit inside, the space was illuminated by jars containing luminescent flowers and what looked like strange glowing bugs too big and bright to be fireflies, and besides, fireflies were green and these were blue. There was also a hoard of random items inside and food the child had gathered, if I remember right, and it was clear the boy had been there for some time. His fashion looked outdated, and the clothes were very washed out looking and dirty. 

“Who are you?” Zoe beat me to the question that was on both our minds as we both stared at him. 

“I forgot my name.” The boy shook his head, looking angry. “The faery stole it from me, names give them power. Did you give it your names?” 

“Not mine,” I replied, before looking at Zoe. I was afraid she had, and the look on my face made my anxiety about that quite clear. 

“I told them my name was Princess Lily.” Zoe said proudly as she met my gaze. “Not cuz I was afraid, but because I wanted her to think I was special, too. I'm glad I did though.” 

“Me too.” I nodded and looked at the boy. “How long have you been here, exactly?” 

“A really, really long time.” He frowned. “I stopped counting days a while ago. Are my parents still looking for me?” 

“I don't know who your parents are.” I felt bad for him. “Do you at least know your family surname, or your parents’ first names?” I also asked him if he went missing in our area, but I won't reveal to you the name of the town we lived close to. He didn't remember any of the people's names, just the name of the town, and I could tell he wanted to cry so I switched the subject. 

“So you've been living underground?” I remember looking around and seeing a map he had been trying to work on, with old fashioned parchment paper and a feather quill. 

“It's the only safe place to live here.” The boy said, eating some strange green berries he had. 

“Stop eating that,” I lowered his hand clutching the fruit from his mouth, “I heard eating their food gives them power over you.” 

The boy snorted and glared at me judgmentally. “You don't think I know that? I know everything about the fae people. I haven't been able to leave here in a long time and if I didn't eat anything I would be dead. Duh.” 

“You didn't eat anything, right, Zoe?” I asked, turning to her. 

“Yes.” Zoe looked like she wanted to cry. “I was stuck here, I had to. They fed me those little mermaids and some weird looking fruits.” 

“Those are water sprites, I used to feel bad about eating them too but that's the only meat you can catch really easily here other than nasty bugs, and their brains are stupid like real fish anyways.” The boy replied, wiping berry juice from his mouth. “And since you ate here, you'll probably stop growing up, like me.” 

“What?!” Zoe and I cried out at once. 

“Well, I'm not sure if I stopped growing or if I started growing really slowly.” The boy said thoughtfully. “Faeries take a long time to grow, that little girl has been a little girl for a long time. I think when you eat the food here, the rules of this world start affecting you the same as they do the fae people here.” 

“Little girl? You mean Boza?” I leaned forward. “Have you seen her and her mother?” 

“They took me.” The boy replied grimly, a fire burning in his eyes. “I knew as soon as I saw you guys that they'd taken you, too. They kept me in a cage, but just like you I was able to escape.” 

“We're not escaped,” Zoe said, tugging her collar, “this thing won't let me go back home through the portal.” 

“There's a portal?!” The boy all but yelled, his eyes going wide. “Why didn't you say that before?! I've been waiting for another one to open for ages! We have to go right now!” He tried to crawl past us to the hole opening but I held him back. 

“Wait a second! I'm not showing you where it is until you help me get this collar off my sister.” I looked at him sternly, not wanting to lose Zoe's only chance of escape.

“Get out my way!” The boy hollered with rage. “If we don't hurry it'll close soon! Move!!” 

“Please!” I begged. “You've been here a long time and seem to know a lot about this place. We know where the key is, we just need help getting it. See? Simple!” 

“Didn't I tell you already I escaped them before?!” He spat. “You must think I'm pretty dumb, huh? I know exactly what you're trying to sign me up for. The faery lady keeps that key on her all the time, it's impossible. Besides, no one was here to help me, I wish my sister had come for me!” 

“If it was impossible, you wouldn't be here.” I argued. “And I'm sorry no one came for you… Hey, wait, did you say you had a sister?” 

The boy eyed me warily and nodded. “Yeah… I don't remember her name… To be honest, you kinda look like her,” he pointed at Zoe, “and I thought you were her, until you came close enough for me to see. But you're just a couple of random girls.” 

That's when I realized something. 

“Was your sister's name Emily?” I asked. 

He looked shocked. “Yes! I think it was! That sounds familiar! This is the first time I've been able to remember! Do you know her?” 

“Our grandma's name is Emily.” Realization dawned on Zoe as well. “Hey, she said her big brother went missing when she was my age!” 

“I didn't know she told you that story too!” I remember expressing surprise at this. I turned to the boy. “So your name is Dustin!”  

Dustin visibly shuddered. “It's coming back…it's all coming back… so I've been gone for that long? ‘Grandma’...? Does that mean…our parents are dead?” 

I nodded sadly, knowing my grandma's mom and dad were long gone. Zoe looked like she wanted to cry for him, but instead she gave him a hug. He was too shocked to hug her back. “I always thought I'd see them again…” He burst into tears. 

We watched him sob for a while. All I could do was awkwardly pat his shoulder until he gained his composure again and started wiping his face with his shirt. “I'll get them for this.” His voice took on a dark tone, his stare full of hatred. “I promise I'll get them for this.” 

“You'll have your chance if you help us.” I said. 

“So… you’re my…” He looked me up and down, unable to find the correct word. 

“Grand niece,” I smiled, “yeah. Since we're family, will you help? You will be able to see your sister again. Grandma would be so happy to see you, she was so heartbroken when you disappeared.” 

“Okay.” Dustin’s face transformed into a look of determination. “We're going to get that stupid dog collar off, kill those monsters, and go back home. But we have to do it quickly, the portals are always on a timer. How long has it been open?” 

“Maybe an hour.” I shrugged. “Zoe went missing a couple months ago, and I came here tonight. I think one opened for me, but I don't know why.” 

“Then we don't have very long.” Dustin muttered nervously. “I've seen them open portals when I was still their pet, and they don't last very long at all. I don't know why she opened one again, but if it closes, we could be stuck here for years.” 

At this, Zoe and I tensed up, feeling a very real fear strike our hearts like a lightning bolt. We knew we had to do whatever it took to escape the Otherworld.
