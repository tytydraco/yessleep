It was around my sister's birthday, and she wanted classic cartoon DVDs. I went to a local thrift store because with my age, I didn't have a card to order from online. When I walked in, the cashier greeted me and I asked if they still had any classic cartoons, and she said “Yes, right by the children's aisle, we have a shelf full of DVDs and VHS and we have a couple cartoons like Tom And Jerry and Popeye.” I thanked her and went to check it out.

 I saw DVDs of small amounts of episodes for one show, then I saw a DVD with many characters photoshopped on. I didn't think much of it because it could've been a cartoon mixtape someone made and put it on a DVD to donate. The title to the DVD was Ultimate Cartoon Collection and it had additional text saying 3+ hours of cartoons from the 40s to 60s. I put it by the register and the woman thought it was weird how poorly photoshopped it looked, but still rang me up and I bought it for five dollars.

 A week after, on my sister's birthday, I gave it to her, and she loved it. At around 8, after the party, my parents left and told me to babysit her. I put the DVD I gave her in the DVD player and gave her a remote. I told her to turn it off when she goes to sleep and I went into my room.

 After a couple minutes of trying to sleep, I hear a scream. I ran down and sawy sister crying with the TV off. I asked her what's wrong and she couldn't muster any words, I then took her to bed and played a video on my phone to make her feel better. I went and checked the TV, thinking that is why she screamed.

 When I turned the TV on, the DVD restarted to a Betty Boop episode and around five minutes in, it went black and text appeared saying “You thought this was normal, didn't you. You are in for a surprise.” It cut to a video of a man being beheaded and it lasted for what seemed like a long time, but I wanted to see what else was in there, I guess I had some morbid curiosity. It then showed a slideshow of pictures of decomposing bodies from body farms. A woman appeared on screen with her back facing the screen and she was holding her hair, a man then shot her in the back of the head. Then more text appeared saying “do you think that's all?” Then it showed more grotesque videos, so bad that my mind blocked out most of them, but I remember a handful.

 A man is hung and had his intestines removed, a woman in heels stepped on small animals, mainly small mammals, and killed them, a man gets his face torn off by a bear, a man jumps of a tall building to his death, and multiple people who are tied up, get doused in gasoline and lit on fire. It ended with text saying “well it looks like you made it, had fun?”

 I went up to the TV to take the DVD out and an image of a woman whose face had been completely removed who looked like she was screaming in agony popped up and a very loud noise could be heard, it was almost like multiple people screaming as loud as the can with their throats cut.

 I took out the DVD and snapped it in half, I then went to comfort my sister who heard the screaming from the jump scare. I heard a knock on the door and it was a neighbor who told me to keep the movie down, only if he knew what I watched. This was years ago and I remember keeping the cover, but it is in storage 2000 miles away. All I can say is that I never bought a used DVD again.
