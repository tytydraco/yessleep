I just remembered a very scary and weird encounter from my childhood when I was 10, I had totally forgotten about it.

Me and 3 friends went to a abandoned house that was planed to be demolished. It was tape all around it and my parents had told me that this place was very dangerous because one kid had fallen from some stairs inside the house and gotten hurt.

We had planed to play hide and seek in there and it was a perfect place for it, the house was big.

We went in to the living room, and the place was in very bad shape, I remember clearly the bad condition. We did a random pick on who was the seeker and I was one of the ones hiding. 

My friend started counting and I ran outside to the back of the house to go down in the basement by the outside basement entrance. I just assumed the door was open and it was. I went down the stairs and the first room had windows so I could see but that made the room bad for hiding. So I went deeper in and it went darker and darker and it started to smell weird, the windows deeper in was barricaded so just some light went in. When I have passed 2 rooms I stopped and looked at the wall,  I could see splashes of red. I thought it was paint or just graffiti, but there where not so much graffiti on the house so why the random red splashes down here. Now when I remember it all it was more alike blood then paint. 

After the wall inspection I heard some noises, I of course thought it was my friend coming down in the basement to look for me. There was not much to hide behind but there was a old table I could hide under, it was so dark enough to make me hidden. I heard the steps coming closer and now it was so close that the person that was down here with me was in the room next to me.Then I saw the boots and legs of a older man coming in the room, and my hearth dropped. I went frozen and started to breathe heavily. The man came to the table and went down on he's knee's and looked right at me in the dark.

 He grabbed my arm and pulled me up from the floor. He asked me why I was down here and if there was more people here. I was so scared that I couldn't talk. He then grabbed my arm tighter and told me that if I didn't told anyone that he was down here he was not gonna hurt me. Then he asked me something that made me so fkg scared that mby this was the thing that got me to suppress the memory.  He asked If went to the School Sofiebe***. And that he recognized me. It was my school, but I didn't make a sound.

Then a large crash sound comes from the window, glass is flying on me and he is losing his grip on my arm. I ran so fkg fast back to the entrance and when I was up again I could see my 2 of my friends throwing stones on the basement windows. I screamed RUN and they started to run with me. We did not look back and just went on running.


This is everything I remember. I am now 29 and it's crazy how I can unlock this memory just at random, I have never thought about this after that moment. I never ever mentioned this to anyone and this is the first time I am talking about it. It gives me the creeps that this random man did know my school and that he eventually did know who I was.
