It began when I first visited my girlfriend's family home. It was a lovely, colonial home on the outside. Even on the inside, it was pristine, during the day. At night, it seemed to change. I met her at work, and was ecstatic when she invited me over to her place. As soon as I showed up that first night, my girlfriend told me I had to leave by midnight because her Dad didn't know me well enough yet. It made sense to me, so once our movie ended around 11:34PM I decided to call it a night and left. I wanted to respect her Dad's wishes, especially before I had even met the man. I really liked this girl, and making a good first impression was my priority at the time.

Time went by, and I had been over to her house several times. Still, I hadn't met her father. I met her mother in passing one day, but she didn't say much. It was kinda weird. My girlfriend and I were watching a movie in the family room, and her mother just walked into the room without speaking a word. She didn't look at me at all. Instead, she seemed to be staring straight through my girlfriend's soul. Wouldn't even fucking look at me, until she was leaving the room. "Tread carefully, Ryan. She's tricky," she said as she disappeared into the kitchen.

"So you HAVE talked about me to your parents?" I said smugly. My girlfriend shrugged. It didn't bother me too much. So she had told her mother my name, that's a good thing, right? Yeah. I told myself such, at least. We continued eatching our movie and once 11:30PM hit, we got ready for my departure. I really didn't want to leave that night, as I figured we'd been doing this whole "leave by midnight" thing for too long. I wanted to be with her. Like, REALLY be with her. I told her I'd stay, and she blew the fuck up. Literally cursed me out for insisting and said that I was moving too fast. Damn, I thought...2 years and I had never spent the night with her. She wouldn't come over to my place either because her parents wouldn't allow it. It pissed me off, so I stopped talking to her for a few days.

After day 4, I grappled with my own mind and eventually decided to text her. She responded immediately and we deicided that we'd hangout at her place the following evening. We did the same thing we always did: watched a fucking movie. I really wanted more, and so I pushed for it and asked her why I hadn't formally met her parents. I know, right? Most people dread that. But for me, it was strange knowing that her parents were right upstairs everytime we hungout and yet, we'd never shared a dinner. When I asked her if we could go upstairs, she paused and then led me to the 2nd floor. Roaches crawled up and down the door she claimed led to her parent's room. Gross, but I was determined despite her pleas not to open the door. I opened it, and still regret it. Her mother laid on the bed next to the most grotesque creature I've ever seen. I've never seen anything worse, even in video games. This creature, was my girlfriend's father. Built of maggots, millipedes, roaches, and beatles. Probably more...but I'm no expert of insects. A few moments after seeing him, I passed out.

I'm in my own house now. I hear things in the wall...they sound like...bugs. i just looked at my phone and I have a text from Emily (my girlfriend). It says "I'm sorry."
