It started when I found the note at my front door.

*We’re watching.*

I couldn’t imagine who or why.

I had worked at a technology company contracting with the US military, designing software to monitor and recognize text related to or promoting terroristic activity.

And I had signed a non-disclosure agreement.

But I have no recollection of divulging any information related to the projects I was exposed to there.

Maybe when I was drunk.

I always wondered if they had agents tracking people, waiting for them to slip up and then…

And I don’t know.

Kill them? Silence them?

I really don’t know.

All I do know is that I’m apparently being watched, and I’m not sure why.

I went to the bar where I got drunk the other night — which is, I think it is relevant to say, a rare occasion — and asked the bartender if he heard me talking to anyone, and if he remembered what, if anything, I had said.

After a moment’s thought, he jolted in sudden recollection and told me I was the guy who sat alone at the bar all night and didn’t say a word.

Sounds like me.  Even drunk.

But, despite my social ineptitude being yet again confirmed, I was relieved because this was one less possible slip I may have made which could have led to my being currently under surveillance.

So it had nothing to do with violating the NDA.

Good.

My momentary relief was quite suddenly and jarringly displaced by my recurring paranoia when I saw a dark, suited figure standing across the street from my house.

He didn’t say anything, didn’t approach, but just stood there, still as a statue — and watched.

As promised.

A woman then walked up beside him, he removed his sunglasses, hugged and kissed her, and they got into his tinted black sedan and drove off.

Heh.

Funny how I assumed he was some kind of military agent.

Paranoia doesn’t just affect your thoughts.  It affects your perception, too.

When I got to my kitchen, I noticed something strange: everything seemed to be out of place by just a few inches — just barely enough to notice.

Was I imagining it?

I had to be.

My room and bathroom were the same.

I began to suspect that the military was trying to assassinate me.

The company I’d worked for had closed, being as it was a fully government-run operation under heavy classification.

The technology we’d helped develop was highly classified, the type of technology that must remain clandestine to impart any significant strategic advantage.

And now that we’d disbanded, and we’re no longer bound by the NDA, I wondered how anyone could be sure none of us would talk about what we saw.

Do they kill former contractors to keep them quiet?

I called a few former coworkers who I’d had some amiable relations with.

No answer.

None of them.

I saw a man walking his dog earlier, talking on his cell phone, and who looked straight at me through my window as he passed in front of my house.

I’ve been seeing a a lot of similar things lately.

I’m actually afraid to eat now, because they might be poisoning my food.

*Is this how they kill inconvenient witnesses to their classified projects?*

That would be slick.

Make them so afraid of persecution, they slowly erode, have heart attacks and strokes, starve themselves in fear of poisoning, and whatever else.

And it’s clean.  No trace.

Just a heart attack.  Happens all the time.

Sometimes I wonder if I’m imagining all of it.

But then I remember the note.

Undeniable.  I held it in my hands.

Could have been a prank, I suppose.  See a note like that and your mind conjures up the rest.

Very funny.

But, really, what are the odds?

It seems targeted.

My neighbor is on his phone and staring at me through his window.  Has he been compromised?

How many people are in on this?

I’m beginning to hear voices.  I think they put a chip in my brain, a sort of transceiver that decodes brainwaves into text so they can monitor my thoughts.

Or there are speakers somewhere in my house.

But I don’t think so.  I tore my house apart, and found nothing.

Last time I went to eat something, I noticed some kind of caustic solvent spilled on my counter.

That wasn’t from me.

Now I’m convinced they’re poisoning me.

Or trying.  I won’t let them succeed.

I don’t deserve to die.

This is their problem, not mine.

I guess you have to be careful what kind of companies you work for.  It could cost you your life.

Or your sanity at least.

I thought about going to restaurants, or only eating out of cans.

But if they can read my thoughts — which I’m almost certain now they can — they’ll know which restaurants, which grocery stores, compromise the chefs, replace the canned goods with contaminated substitutes…

There’s no escaping this.

I think I’m going to eat.  If it’s poisoned, then…

But I can’t let them win.  I’m holding out.

I’m not eating.

But what if they’re trying to make me think I’m being poisoned, so I don’t eat and starve myself to death?

I’m eating.

But can you imagine the pain of being poisoned?  And the humiliation.

No, I’m not eating.

I’ve picked up and put down this same can a hundred times.

I was thinking about redecorating.

But my house is a mess.  I tore right through those walls, pulled up every floorboard.

Even still, there’s always some place you didn’t look.  I’ll go over it again.  Those speakers are somewhere.

And if I find them, I’ll know they can’t read my thoughts, and I can eat.

I’m starving.  I mean actually starving.  I’ll go over the house one more time and check for those speakers.

They’re here somewhere.

Or there’s a chip in my brain.

I am *so* hungry.

I was planning on a walk, but I have no energy.

And my neighbors keep informing on me, standing there with their phones, just staring.

I should check for cameras in here.  But they can be hard to find.

And my heart is beating arhythmically.

And my arm is numb.

But it could just be in my mind.
