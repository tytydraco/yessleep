Hi. I don't know if this is the right place to write about this, but I can't get it out of my head. Maybe someone has had a similar experience?

I live in a small town in Oregon. Right behind my backyard, a dense forest begins, stretching for miles. Since childhood, I played there with friends, and as an adult, I often go for walks to clear my mind. It has always been my safe place. Until recently.

Everything started about two weeks ago. It was nighttime, I was lying in bed trying to fall asleep when I heard something strange. It sounded like… creaking. As if someone was dragging an old door across the floor, but it was deep, metallic, and repeated at regular intervals. It came from the forest.

Of course, living on the edge of the woods, we're used to strange noises – howling coyotes, rustling branches, sometimes even the sound of falling trees. But this was different. It sounded artificial, as if something unnatural was out there.

The next night, the same thing. I sat on the porch and waited. Exactly at 11:13 PM – the same sound. A long, unnatural creaking. I grabbed my flashlight and went to check. As soon as I approached the forest's edge, the sound stopped. As if something knew I was coming. I stood there for a few minutes, listening, but there was absolute silence.

For the next few days, I tried recording the sound with my phone, but whenever I hit record, nothing happened. As if something was toying with me. Eventually, I decided to go deeper into the forest. I took a flashlight, a knife (just in case), and started walking. It was eerily quiet. Even the insects had stopped buzzing. After a few minutes of walking, I noticed something strange – an old, abandoned staircase. Just standing there in the middle of the forest.

I had heard the legends – about staircases in the woods that lead nowhere. But I had never seen one with my own eyes. It was made of wood but looked perfectly preserved. No moss, no signs of aging. A cold shiver ran down my spine. I didn’t know why, but I felt I shouldn’t touch them.

Then I heard the sound. Creaking. It was so close that it felt like something was standing right behind me. I turned around suddenly, but no one was there. My flashlight started flickering and then went out completely. My heart pounded in my chest. Panic took over, and I did the only reasonable thing – I ran. I ran blindly until I saw the lights of my house. As soon as I stepped over the threshold, the creaking stopped.

Since that night, I haven’t heard it again. But I can feel that something is out there. Sometimes I get the feeling that someone is watching me through the window. I find strange footprints around my house, as if someone has been walking barefoot on the ground. The worst part? A few days ago, I received a letter – no stamp, no sender. Inside was just a note that read: "Do not return to the stairs."

But I can't help myself. Curiosity is eating me alive. What if this warning is something more? What if someone – or something – is trying to stop me from discovering the truth? Maybe I should go back there one more time. But this time, I'll be ready.

Tonight, I am going back to the forest. I’ve taken a flashlight, a pocketknife, and my phone with a full battery. I plan to record everything that happens. If someone finds this post and I never return… please, do not look for me.

11:10 PM. I'm leaving.
