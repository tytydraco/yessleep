“Stop! Think about your children, your grandchildren. Layla is only six-weeks old, she’ll never know her grandfather!”

Tom Flores, who I had known for 25 years, was standing on top of a kid’s jungle gym in his backyard. His feet tip-toeing on a thin metal rail, like some half-ass tightrope-walker. He leaned forward, his chest aimed towards the ground. 

The bend in his hips gave gravity the edge, a few more inches and he’d tilt to the point of no return. If he fell it was only about a six-foot drop, but it wasn’t the height that would kill him.

Below him was his old climbing pick-axe, he’d shoved it into the mud, point side up. 

Tom was going to impale himself. 

Even though we’d known each other for a quarter of a century, I wouldn’t call Tom a friend, though he once was. Things beyond our control made it complicated, as you’ll learn, for our friendship to have survived. But we had many things in common that kept us in each other’s orbit, including a horrific secret we shared. 

He was the only one in the world who understood the dread I lived with, the soul crushing weight I carried around each day. It burdened him as well, and was why he was about to drive a spike through his lungs.

The skeleton in our closet was we’d killed a seven-year-old girl two decades earlier. The same girl who was sitting on the jungle gym next to Tom. Sitting and staring at him.

Her name was Kate.

“Please Tom, don’t. This won’t change anything.” I pleaded, taking a step towards him. 

Kate shifted her glance my way. 

I stopped. My fear seizing every muscle in place. I hated when she looked at me.

Tom replied, “It won’t change, it’ll never change, but if I’m dead I don’t have to see her ever again.” He looked down at Kate, whose soul crushing gaze was back on him.

Tom teetered on the thin metal bar he stood on, his flannel shirt caught in the wind, his grey hair looked yellow in the sun.

We had stayed in touch, helping one another whenever the guilt and fear pushed us to the edge. His frantic voicemail had me in his backyard at that moment.

Kate sat there and watched. Wearing what she always wore, the clothes she had on when she died. A red North Face down jacket. Her red hair wet and matted, her face a cold blue.

Tom started to cry, through his sobs he muttered, “The others were lucky. Cancer, I wished for it, hoped I’d get it. Prostate. Lung. Whatever, please god, please make me sick!”

He was talking about Rachel Cross and Vince Bota the two other members of our Search and Rescue team. 

We all went up the mountain that day and when we came down, we were haunted; figuratively and literally by what happened. None of us thought we would kill an innocent 8-year-old.

Rachel and Vince had both died of cancer in their late thirties, just ten years after the “accident”. If stress can truly bring on illness, then their deaths made sense, since having a dead girl haunt you ever single day of your life would strain anyone to the point of breaking.

Vince had become a raging alcoholic and was in an out of rehab and prisons. Leukemia struck him down at the age of 38.

Rachel lived alone. A shut-in. I hadn’t seen her for five years before she died of breast cancer.

Both were haunted by Kate and both took their secret about what happened up on the mountain to their graves. Now, it was just Tom and I who knew.

Tom crouched and sat down on the metal bar, a measure of sanity regained.

Kate, climbed off the jungle gym and walked into the woods that edged Tom’s yard. Just before she stepped into the forest, she turned and looked and pointed at us.

Then she was gone. 

Kate never said anything, she would just appear and then leave. Sometimes she’d  be there for hours, other times just a fleeting moment. A spectral reminder of what we did to her.

I helped Tom down and pulled the pick-axe out of the ground.

He was a blubbering mess.

“I can’t take it anymore. I can’t. I just want her to go away.”

I patted Tom on the back, reassuring.

“Let’s go inside, get something to drink. You always have a bottle of Glenlivet around.”

Suddenly Tom lunged at me, his hands to my throat. His thumbs pressed against my windpipe. I struggled against his grasp. 

“It’s because of you! You did this! You were the one and because of you we all suffered!”

As he yelled spittle flew from his mouth and splattered my face. He was enraged.

His suicidal thoughts had transformed to murderous ones.

I struggled to release his grip. There was a buzzing in my ear, my lips felt numb. I was drifting into unconsciousness. I thrust the pick-axe, handle side first, into Tom’s groin. A muffled thud.

As his grip loosened, I was able to push him away.

He fell to the ground, moaning.

I caught my breath and stamped out of the yard to my car, shouting back, “It was all of us, we agreed it was all of us!”

When I got home, I rushed up the stairs. As I took the steps, two at a time, my husband Gary’s voice called out, “Don’t forget your pills!” It was a little game we played, him reminding me, and me never taking them. The truth was I knew I didn’t need any pills.

My medication was a sham. 

A way to explain away my anxiety, my fear, my night sweats and daytime trembles. I was diagnosed with panic attacks, but I knew what really caused me to break down and cry at the dinner table every other night.

Kate standing there and staring as I lifted each forkful of food. 

It wasn’t a panic attack that caused me to rush out of the auditorium during my son’s middle-school concert. It was Kate, standing behind him as he played his violin.

Christmas morning ruined, not because of anxiety, but the terror of Kate sitting next to me as we unwrapped presents. My daughter worried, asked me, “Are you ok Mommy, Christmas is supposed to be happy.” As I sobbed so hard my shoulders heaved in front of her.

Hundreds upon hundreds of moments over the years, of me reduced to a hyperventilating, crying, terrified shell of a person. I understood why Tom was going to drive a spike through his chest, I wanted it stopped too. 

There was something that I thought might end it. To escape Kate’s hold on our lives. It wasn’t a noose around my neck, or a gunshot to the head, but something simpler.

I made my way into the attic, standing there when I noticed Tom’s pick-axe was still in my hand. It slipped from my grasp and fell to the floor. I was up there searching for my old box of gear from when it happened.

I found it behind my grandmother’s old sewing machine. The jacket was still inside. On the back of it in red letters were the words  – “Mount Washington Search and Rescue”.

I put it on. It still smelled of pine and it still held memories.

Memories of what happened. 

I closed my eyes and I was back on Mount Washington in New Hampshire.

The call came in to the rescue center, a family trapped on the mountain. It was April, the worst time of year for people getting in trouble and dying up there.

Mount Washington was known for having the worst weather on earth. Unbelievable winds that drove pellets of ice through the air like bullets. The problem with April was that one minute it could be 60 degrees and sunny and in an instant change to blizzard conditions.

The mountain towered to around 6000 feet so snow and ice still covered the higher elevations even though it was spring. You’d start off hiking in warm sunny conditions but if you rambled too high up the peak, you were suddenly in the death zone.

Tom, Rachel, Vince, and myself were bounding up the mountain. We had the family in our sights in less than an hour. A mix of snow and rain pelted us as we got close.

It was supposed to be a family we were coming to aid, a mother, father and daughter, but all we saw were the parents. They were sitting against a boulder, huddled together trying to stay warm.

I was the first one there, when I asked the father if he was ok, he turned to me and showed me his hands. They were bloodied ribbons of flesh, scraped to the bone.

 He spoke in an almost trance like voice, which I realized was shock, “She…she’s there, buried under there.” Pointing his bloody finger to a mixed pile of snow and ice.

“Who’s buried?”, I asked.

The mother replied, “Our daughter, Kate.”

By that time, Vince, Rachel and Tom had joined me. Vince immediately went to work on the father, tending to his wounds. Rachel got an emergency blanket around the mother, doing her best to keep her from falling into hypothermia.

We learned they were hiking when they were overcome by an avalanche. A jumble of snow and ice cascading from above. The mother and father managed to get behind a boulder, but Kate had tripped and in an instant was carried away. Buried beneath a huge slab of ice.

The father tried digging his daughter out using only his hands. He didn’t have gloves, because when they started their hike it was a perfect spring day. Smiles and sunshine replaced by tears and dread.

Tom and I used our pick axes to chip away the ice. 

“There, I see her, she’s wearing a red jacket.” Kate was buried beneath a foot of frozen slush. I reached in, my fingers found the collar of her coat and I was able to wrestle her out of her glacial tomb.

I pulled of my gloves and I checked for a heartbeat and any sign of breathing. My fingers pressed against her slender wrist, hoping for that clockwork-like thump. I did the same on the artery on her neck.

Her skin was cold and a dull blue-grey hue, including her lips, their warm pink color missing and never to be seen again.

“Nothing, I’m not getting any pulse, on her neck or wrist.”

Kate was dead, probably had been for over an hour.

Tom’s eyes were swollen red, he fought back tears. In Search and Rescue death was a constant, but there was something about a dead child that always cut you down and hurt like hell.

Aside from some nicks and cuts around her face, Kate looked serene. If there was any comfort in the moment, it was she died quickly and probably didn’t suffer. The coroner would give us the details when we brought the body down off the mountain.

I pulled some pebbles out of her red wet hair. For some strange reason I thought of my wedding and my mother pulling rice from my veil after we had left the church steps. Little Kate would never have that moment.

Like Tom I started to cry.

Rachel and Vince stayed with the parents as Tom zipped the young girl into a black body bag. 

It was near sunset and the conditions had worsened to below freezing temps and falling snow. The idea of hiking down with the badly injured father and hypothermic, grieving mother seemed like a sure way to compound the tragedy.

I decided we’d make our way across the scree lined slope and spend the night at the Lake of the Clouds hut, which was closed to the public that time of year. It was nothing more than a cabin with beds. There was no electricity, but it would be out of the elements.

Once inside, Tom and I brought Kate down into the basement of the hut, her body still zipped up tight in the bag.

I didn’t want it to be out in view of the parents as we tried to calm and care for them.

We made our way down into the dark cellar. There was no light, just the beams from our headlamps. 

I held her shoulders through the bag and Tom her feet. She weighed about 50 pounds and was tall for her age. As gentle as we could we laid Kate down at the foot of the stairs. 

Before leaving her, I knelt and laid my hand on the body bag and said a silent prayer. Then we left her resting against the bottom step.

The plan was Tom and I would leave first light in the morning, before the parents, giving us time to maneuver our way off the mountain while carrying the body.

Most of that night we spent lending our deepest sympathies to the parents, letting them know they didn’t do anything wrong. There’s a reason the word accident exists.

Tom and I were up the next morning before the others. Rachel and Vince would slowly guide the parents down about an hour behind us.

The day was bright. The sun beaming in through the hut’s windows. It seemed too cheery of a day for what we had to do. Grey thick clouds that weighed down the mountain would have been more appropriate than the bluebird sky outside the hut that morning.

Geared up and ready, I opened the basement door. 

The light from the main cabin spilled down into the darkness.

Kate’s body bag wasn’t there.

“What the hell.” Tumbled from my mouth as I stared down to where the body should have been, at the bottom of the stairs.

Tom was confused, “What? What is it?”

“Did you move the body?”

“Move it? Why would I?”

“It’s not there.”

Rachel and Vince were up and awake by that time, getting ready.

I called to them in a hushed voice, asking them the same.

They both reacted like Tom, their head’s shaking “no” in unison.

I had Vince check the parent’s room to see if they had brought Kate up during the night to have her in their room.

He came back, “Nope, their asleep and it’s just them.”

I looked down again just to make sure, but Kate wasn’t there.

The four of us made our way into the cellar. Our flashlights piercing the darkness, raking the floor of the basement, searching for Kate.

Tom’s beam found the black body bag, it had rolled across the room against a stack of old broken snowshoes.

Kate was still in it.

I looked at the bag, confused and shocked. I called out to all of them.

“If any of you moved her and didn’t say anything, now would be a good time to tell me.”

Their silence was the answer.

Vince pulled the body bag to the center of the room.

We knelt around it. 

I pulled down the zipper. 

Rachel gasped, “God no.” when I peeled the bag open.

There was Kate, her face frozen in a perpetual scream. Her lips curled over her teeth, eye’s bulging. A horrific visage of terror.

Her hands were up by her cheeks, fingers bent and spread in a clawing gesture, as if she was trying to scratch her way out of the bag like some wild animal caught in a trap.

Bits of black rubber beneath her fingernails confirmed that’s what she was trying to do.

Clawing and screaming.

Tom wailed, “Don’t tell me she was alive when I put her in that bag…don’t. Sweet Jesus no! You said she was dead! You checked and told me she was dead!”

I begged Tom to quiet down, he’d wake the parents. I didn’t want them to see their daughter like this and I also didn’t want them to know what happened.

I stared at Kate trying to make sense of what I was seeing. 

Rachel kept her refrain going, “God no…oh god no.” She backed into the corner, trying to distance herself from the horror before us.

Vince, who was a paramedic, knew what happened. 

“Like when those kids fell through the ice in Jackson. They brought them up 70 minutes after they were under. No pulse, no breathing. It’s the cold, It’s like a mini-hibernation. The heart beats imperceptibly, barely pumping enough blood only to the brain and lungs. If you went to check her pulse on her wrist or even neck, you would have missed it.”

Kate had warmed up in the body bag. When she came to, she was terrified, not knowing where she was. Alone, imprisoned. 

Fighting to get out of the bag she rolled herself across the floor. Her screams trapped in the rubber coffin and dark cellar. We didn’t hear her calling for help.

The body bag is meant to be airtight, so no decomposing odors can escape, but that also means no air can get in. 

She used up whatever oxygen that was left.

“She suffocated to death.” I murmured.

Tom had another theory, “Yeah, maybe it was more like she was scared to death, trapped in the bag I zipped her up in, trying to get out, not knowing where she was…”, before Tom finished his thought he made a run at me. 

Vince held him back. For the next ten minutes there was more pointing and accusations and blame shared.

That’s when we made our pact. We had just spent the night telling Kate’s parents that what happened was an accident, it wasn’t their fault. The same applied to us.

Nothing good would come if word got out that we were all involved in the death of a little girl. 

Rachel and Vince, protested, insisting they weren’t the ones to declare her dead, or zip her up in the bag. But in the end they knew no one would remember who did what and their reputations who be ruined like Tom’s or mine.

We swore to each other that we’d never tell anyone what really happened.

I reached into the bag and pulled Kate’s clawed hands down from her face. Then wiped away the slivers of black rubber underneath her fingertips and gently closed her eyelids. 

No one would ever know, except the four of us…and Kate.

We had our secret, but she would never let us forget what we had done, what I had done.

But after twenty-two years I can’t do it anymore, keep this bottled up inside. Seeing Tom earlier, the utter depth of his anguish and desperation, there’s only one thing I can do.

I’m ending our pact.

You’re reading this now because I finally need to take responsibility for the tragic mistake I made on that mountain. A little girl died that day because of me. 

But I made things worse by also setting my friend’s lives down a terrible path.

Instead of owning up to Kate’s death and bearing the consequences, I lied and forced others to join me in a lie. As they say, it’s not the crime, it’s the cover-up that makes things worse. And I made things so much worse, destroying lives and perpetuating an enduring carnage. It’s washed over everything like a wave of misery each and every year since that terrible day.

I ask Tom to forgive me, that hopefully my confession can release him from this nightmare. He did nothing wrong, it was me, my fault alone.

Rachel and Vince are dead, I have faith they’ll know that I’m done including them in my falsehood. Their deaths, like Kate are a tragedy that I created, my sins to bear.

I beg everyone reading this to give me a small bit of absolution, to understand I didn’t mean to kill Kate.

I can see Kate now, she’s standing in the corner watching me as I type. I mean this with all my heart, forgive me Kate. I hope you find peace.

I can hear the wind whispering through the trees outside my bedroom window as I sit in front of my laptop. Whispers often carry secrets, mine is now carried out to the world.

Sometimes guilt can haunt you just like a ghost.
