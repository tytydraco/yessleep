It’s been three hours. Three hours trapped in this service closet, almost suffocating in this stale air. Three hours, and the silence is deafening. I’m stuck, no way out, no hope of escape. Every inch of me is screaming, but I can’t move. I can’t run. All I can think about is her. That’s all I can focus on now, and the terrifying realization that I’m not going to make it out.

So here I am. Writing this down. Because if I don’t leave something behind, something to prove I was here, who will know? Who will believe me?

Let me start from the beginning.

I’ve been working the night shift at Brookside Nursing Home for two months now. It’s just a part-time gig to cover bills while I try to finish up nursing school. It should’ve been a simple job that had me assisting, checking on the elderly residents, making sure everything was running smoothly. But it didn’t take long before I realized that Brookside wasn’t a place where people just grew old and quiet. No. There was something else here. Something dark that seemed to pulse beneath the surface, hiding in the cracks of the walls and down in to the floorboards. 

The place itself? It’s everything you’d expect from a second-rate shitcan nursing home. Dim lighting, cracked flooring that seemed to absorb sound, the musty scent of antiseptic mingling with something… older. And the residents. Most of them are barely conscious, their faces blank and pale as they sit in front of TVs or drift off to sleep in their wheelchairs. A few get the occasional visitor, but it’s rare. Too rare.

But still, something didn’t feel right. It wasn’t just the building. It was something… darker. Like there was a presence here, an energy that made the air thicker. Something sinister that clung to the walls. It felt as though the very ground beneath my feet was waiting for something. Watching. And I didn’t know what it was until I met it. Until I met her. 

Miss E.

At first, I thought she was like any other resident. An elderly woman who needed help, someone whose body had failed her, leaving her at the mercy of strangers. I’d seen her around the halls, always moving. Miss E was a “walker.” She spent her days pacing up and down the narrow hallways, her worn slippers scraping against the floor. Her chart said it was a normal behavior…nothing to worry about. But it struck me as odd.  She moved relentlessly, even when no one else was around. Day or night, Miss E was always walking.

I didn’t pay much attention at first. There was no reason to. She was one of the more self-sufficient residents, at least on the surface. But then the strange things started. Little moments, small enough to brush off at first, but after a while, they became impossible to ignore.

She’d pass by me in the hall, humming. At first, I thought it was just a mindless tune, the kind you hear from someone with dementia. But it wasn’t like that. The melody was…familiar. So familiar, but I couldn’t place it. It was like it echoed through my memory, tugging at something deep inside me. Something old.

And then, it got **worse**.

It wasn’t just her humming anymore. It was a feeling. A constant, suffocating presence. Like there was always someone watching me, even when I couldn’t see them. I couldn’t shake the sensation, the hair standing up on the back of my neck. At first, I couldn’t figure out where it was coming from. But then I realized—**it was Miss E.**

She would appear out of nowhere, standing in the shadows at the end of the hall or just outside a resident’s door, her eyes locked onto me. Her smile was unsettling—unnatural. It wasn’t the warm, friendly kind that you’d expect from an old woman. No, this was different. It was sharp, like something twisted beneath her skin, pulling at her features. A grin that wasn’t a grin at all. A smile that just didn’t belong anywhere.

I tried to ignore it. I told myself it was just her age, maybe some kind of condition that made her act… off. That’s what I convinced myself. But deep down, I knew it was something more. Something was wrong. Very wrong.

She never spoke to me, not in the first few weeks anyway. She would just watch, her eyes following me wherever I went. But one night, while I was charting at the nurses’ station, she came up to me. Silent at first, but this time, she didn’t just watch.

She whispered, her voice low and hoarse, like it hadn’t been used in months.

***“I steal the moments. I make them mine.”***

The words echoed through the air, twisting through my thoughts. ***“I steal the moments. I make them mine.”*** I told myself it was just old age, that her mind was slipping, but deep down, I knew it was something more. I couldn’t shake the unease, the odd and unsettling sensation that something foul was crawling beneath the surface, waiting. Waiting for me. 

So, I did what anyone might do: I avoided her. I told myself I was just doing my job, trying to keep my distance from whatever was wrong with her. I stopped passing by her room, stopped acknowledging her. Someone else could deal with Miss E. I had enough on my plate. It felt justified. I really wasn’t doing anything wrong.

But whatever twisted thing had taken root in Brookside finally confronted me. Face to face. And it wasn’t just Miss E. It was something far worse.

It happened tonight, on my last shift before my day off. I was finishing up some charts at the nurses’ station, the low hum of the fluorescent lights buzzing overhead, when it hit me—a presence, cold and palpable. My skin crawled, the hair on the back of my neck rising, prickling in fear. My heart pounded, and just as I started to turn, I heard it.

A voice.

Soft. Raspy. Distant, but clear.

***“Peek-a-boo.”***

A cold shiver ran the length of my spine. I froze. The voice repeated itself, but now, something was off. It wasn’t just any voice. It was *her* voice.

*My mother’s voice.*

***“Peek-a-boo.”***

I felt the world around me shudder, like the floor might actually open up and swallow me whole. My stomach twisted into a knot. My mother had been gone for almost an entire year. Cancer had taken her. There was no way it could be her. It was impossible.

But then I saw **her.**

**Miss E.**

She was standing in the far corner of the room, her body so still it looked as though she were part of the shadows themselves. Her eyes were wide, too wide, staring at me with an intensity that felt like they could pierce my soul. And that smile… It was wrong. It twisted her face into something grotesque, something that shouldn’t belong to a human. Her nostrils flared, and I could hear her breath, shallow and uneven, wheezing in and out of her nose.

Then she spoke again, her lips curling upward, her voice sinking into a mocking sing-song tone.

***“Yes. That was the game your mother used to play with you, wasn’t it? Do you remember? How she’d pop her head out and say it, just like that?”***

My body went rigid. My heart stopped. I wanted to scream, to run, but my throat closed up, I couldn’t speak a word. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. I was frozen.

I tried to get up, to stand, to break free of the paralyzing terror wrapping around me. But that’s when she moved.

No. *Lunged*.

Her body shot toward me with unnatural speed, and before I could even react, her bony fingers were digging into the sides of my temples. Her nails felt like daggers, pressing into my skin as her crazed eyes locked onto mine, wide and hungry. Her yellowed teeth gleamed in the dim light, strands of saliva hanging between them like a spiders web. I could feel her hot breath on my neck, the stench of something rancid and foul filling my nostrils.

***“Do you remember,***” she whispered, her voice low and guttural, ***“how she kissed your forehead? Oh, so sweetly. You loved that, didn’t you?!”***

I couldn’t breathe. It felt as if the world had narrowed to just her and I in this moment, this twisted and terrible moment. 

Suddenly, my body jerked into motion, my fight-or-flight instincts kicking in. I jumped up from the chair, heart pounding in my chest, gasping for air. Miss E collapsed to the floor, her body writhing as she burst into laughter - laughter that was just wrong. It was ragged, frantic, like she couldn’t catch her breath. The sound was horrendous, almost as if the air around us was being sucked away, leaving only that laugh to fill the space.

***“Ha ha ha. Awww. Don’t want to play with mommy, darling?”***

This wasn’t normal. This wasn’t anything even remotely realistic. This was supernatural in the truest sense of the word. Something that shouldn’t exist. Something that could twist reality itself. I couldn’t breathe. My chest felt like it was caving in under the weight of what I had just realized. And that’s when I looked down.

***“What the fuck are you?”***

Miss E rose to her feet with a slow, deliberate motion. Her back arched as if she was stretching from a long slumber, and then she smiled—wide and full of malice. Her eyes flickered with anger.

***“I’m not her,”*** she hissed, ***“I’m what comes after. I am what takes.”***

And in that moment, it all clicked. I understood. She wasn’t just a deranged old woman. She was a *predator*. Some sort of entity that hunted in the space between life and death.

My legs finally sprang to life. Every muscle in my body screamed to run. I didn’t think. I didn’t hesitate. I streaked down the dark corridors of Brookside, my heart pounding, the sound of her slippers shuffling behind me like a whisper from the grave. Every turn I took, every door I tried, felt like a dead end. But I couldn’t stop.

I found the service closet and slammed the door behind me, locking it, my breath coming in and out in gasps.

That was hours ago.

I still hear the shuffling. It’s closer now, almost like a heartbeat, beating in the walls. In the air. Every creak of the floorboards, every whisper of the wind through the vents—it’s her. She’s circling, waiting.

I don’t know if I’ll get out. I don’t know how long I can last in here.

But if you’re reading this, don’t come looking for me. Don’t come near Brookside. I don’t care if it’s in the middle of the night or the middle of the day. Don’t come. Because I’m hiding from something far worse than you can imagine. Something that doesn’t just want you to suffer - it wants to *take* everything from you.

If I don’t make it out… then let this be my warning. Stay far away. Because she doesn’t just want your body. She wants your ***soul.***
