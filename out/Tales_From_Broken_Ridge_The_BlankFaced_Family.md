Gerald Trevin, or just Trevin, has been a friend of my dad’s for as long as I’ve been alive. We moved into Broken Ridge after I was born, and Trevin was one of the first of our neighbors to introduce us to the town. One time, he took us on a tour of the community in his beat-up pickup truck. He even assisted the movers in getting everything into our house. Trevin’s seventy-something years old and always wears plaid shirts. His demeanor is often carefree, willing to offer a helping hand to anyone in need. He speaks with an accent that makes him sound like a seasoned cowboy with sideburns and a potbelly (No offense, Mr. Trevin). He’s the most social person I know.

I saw his garage sale sign the other day, so I checked it out. When I got out of my car and made my way to his driveway, I could see that his business was fully stocked. He had dozens of antique keepsakes. I also saw a few missing posters stapled to a street lamp. Someone took the time to laminate the posters, plastering them with photos of dogs and cats displayed in color. There was an orange tabby cat on one poster, a dalmatian puppy on another, and the last one showed a smiling toddler. I sighed and passed by them, focusing on finding Mr. Trevin.

He wasn’t hard to spot, his plaid shirt a stark contrast to, well, everything else. Trevin sat in his favorite lawn chair on his front porch, taking sips from a beer can and soaking in the sun. He noticed me walking up and raised his drink.

“Toby, my boy! Long time no see, huh?” His sunglasses glinted in the sunlight as he smiled at me.

“Yeah, it is. How’ve you been, Mr. Trevin?” I gave him a smile of my own, reaching out to shake his hand. He grasped my hand in an iron grip, the skin rough from decades of hard labor. He watched as I took a seat in the other lawn chair, the empty one next to him.

“Same as always, I suppose,” he sighed, leaning back in his chair. “My son came by yesterday. We went out to some restaurant for a couple of hours. It’s been a year since I’ve seen him. Can you believe that? How time flies. .”

I nodded, settling into the cushion of the chair. I watched as clouds glided far above the lawn, shading the greenery and allowing us a reprieve from the sweltering sun. “Yeah, time passes pretty fast sometimes.”

Trevin turned to me, his hands folded on his lap. “How ‘bout you, Tobes? Anything new going on with you?”

“Not really. I bought a dashcam off of Amazon, so I guess that’s something. Besides that, I-I don’t know. .” I trailed off with a shrug, not knowing what else to say. My knee was bouncing gently on the concrete floor, something I usually do when I’m in one place for too long. I’m not the most social person, having spent most of my life keeping to myself for reasons beyond my control. I clear my throat and focus on enjoying the shade of the trees overhead. We sat in relative silence for what felt like ten minutes.

“Find a girlfriend yet?” I looked over and saw a smirk on his wrinkled face.

I told him no, and he chuckled. “Come on, boy. You’re a fine-looking young man; I bet countless ladies are swarmin’ you at that store you work at!”

“Come on, Mr. Trevin. All the girls there are either taken or not interested in dating someone who has no experience in the scene.” This wasn’t entirely true, but I didn’t tell him that. I just let my eyes focus on the middle distance ahead. The house across the street blocked it. It was a fairly large house, with a two-car garage and a wide window on the far left side.

Mr. Trevin nodded, following my gaze and shifting in his seat. It took him a moment to follow my gaze to the house, He gestured vaguely at the home across from us. “Something weird is happening at that house.”

“Huh?”

“The Wellers family across the street there.”

I gave him a confused look, my brows furrowed slightly. “What do you mean, something’s wrong? It looks fine to me.”

Trevin let out a sigh and leaned back in his chair. “Well, it’s just that last night I was taking a walk around the neighborhood. I was coming back here when I looked into their window and I saw them.” He pointed at the large window at the front of the house, where I assumed it was the dining room. From the outside looking in, I could just make out a table and chairs surrounding it. Above it was a crystal chandelier hanging from a wire or chains. I could also see a radio as well.

“I saw them sitting around the table at, I don’t know, ten in the evening. I didn’t think too much of it, just figured they were having some family game night or a family meeting. Anyway, it was in the morning when I looked out again that I noticed it. Their car was gone. They always park their SUV on the driveway ‘cuz their garage is full of junk. I’ve seen it countless times: cardboard boxes, bicycles, the garbage bins, all of that. So I just thought it was odd that they would pack their car to the brim, and then just come back that night without it.”

I had to admit; it did sound odd that a family would do something like that. I nodded again and leaned back, idly watching a lone squirrel at the edge of the lawn, inching its way down a tree trunk. “That’s. . interesting. Did you see anything else last night?”

Mr. Trevin took another swig of his beer before setting it back down on the ground. “No, I didn’t. I only looked over there for a couple of seconds. They were just eating dinner, and I was tired from walking all evening.”

“Huh. .” was all I could say after Trevin finished.

Trevin put his hands on his armrests and stood up. His joints popped as he sighed and stretched his arms. He glanced at his cluttered driveway, which by now had a handful of people. “I’m gonna go greet the customers. You’re welcome to stay if you like.” 

I thanked him and watched as he greeted the newcomers, welcoming them to his property. He took some time to talk quietly to a solemn-looking couple, occasionally glancing at the missing posters at the property edge.

It wasn’t until the next night that I was in his neighborhood again. I had that night off from work, so I didn’t want it to go to waste. I ended up taking a walk to Mr. Trevin’s neighborhood. It was cool that evening, so I had to wear a windbreaker. I saw the occasional squirrel darting around, and plenty of small birds flying above my head. 

I hadn’t even noticed that I had passed by the Weller’s house until something moved in my periphery. I turned to see that the kitchen window was lit up, casting a warm yellow light into the room. Underneath the bright chandelier was the table, but the seats weren’t empty. I could see a man and a woman on opposite sides of the table. The other two seats had two children, also facing each other. Even though the young boy’s back was facing the window, I could tell that he wasn’t moving.

It was as if this were an uncanny reenactment for a family dinner. The family was completely still, devoid of the activity one would expect to see. The mother and father didn’t move their mouths or gesture with their hands, the children didn't shift in their seats or anything. It was as if someone came in and set up mannequins resembling the family in the dining room and left them there. 

I slipped my phone from my pocket and began recording the scene. I zoomed in on the father to get a better view. After a second, the image cleared and I could see that there was no expression on his face. I looked at the other family members and saw the same lack of expression. 

Keeping my phone focused on the scene, I looked around the neighborhood. I was the only one out there. Many of the houses’ windows were dark, and the few that weren’t had no activity inside them. The only actual things I saw were the dark silhouettes of squirrels darting and birds fluttering overhead. A dog in the distance, far away, kept barking, its sound echoing across the quiet night air, broken only by the rhythmic chirping of crickets. The occasional gust of wind broke the stillness of the forest, sending the dark leaves of the trees rustling.

I kept my phone trained on the window for another thirty seconds before I saw it again. I thought I imagined it, but the chandelier was flickering again, a ghostly dance of light and shadow. Their faces, blank and frozen like masks, did not show any perceptible reaction.

As I kept filming, the light went out on its own. A moment later, the room was once again visible. But there was something different now. The family had vanished, as if they were never there. I slowly lowered my phone, my mind processing what I had just seen. 

In‌ less than a minute, I had witnessed this family of people not moving an inch, then disappearing after the chandelier started short-circuiting. I will admit, my first thought after processing what had just happened was, “Well, that was cool.”

I pocketed my phone, taking one last glance at the dark window of the Weller House, and hastily walked back the way I came. I could feel my chest tightening from anxiety slowly setting in. I was aware of every noise I was making as I made the long walk back home.

I secured the deadbolt in my front door and secured the chain lock. Turning to face my home, my chest tightened a little more at how dark it was. Kicking off my shoes, I flicked on every light switch, moving through the place with haste. In less than a minute, my apartment was like a beacon to the outside world. I tossed my coat onto my bed and flopped onto it, taking deep breaths. 

After a few moments, my heart slowed to a steady rhythm. The tightening in my chest loosened. I rolled onto my back and stared up at the ceiling. This evening had fucked me up, no doubt about that. I hadn’t felt this kind of fear in a long time. When I calmed down, I pulled my phone out and opened my gallery. I opened the recording and reviewed it with my volume low. I noticed an old radio that seemed to belong back in the eighties or nineties. It was at the back of the room, but the Family members obscured most of it. I only saw the top edge of the radio and the antenna protruding from it. 

In the end, I sent the video to one of my only friends at work. I also sent the video to Mr. Trevin, though I know he won’t be able to get back to me until tomorrow. I need someone to verify what I was seeing. This is also the reason I’m writing this and posting it here. I want to know what I saw tonight, so I’m requesting your guys’ help. If this is a prank for some kind of show on Prime or whatever, then they probably got the reaction they wanted. I don’t know why they would choose a small town in the Midwest, though. Broken Ridge does not get much attention with national publicity. If it wasn’t fake or a setup, then I’m not sure what it is.

What do you guys think?
