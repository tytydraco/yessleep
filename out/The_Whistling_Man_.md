Dear Reader,

The night is alive with his tune, a relentless whistle that has become the anthem of my despair. I am Alex Mercer, and I fear this melody will be the last thing I ever hear.

November 9, 2024, 3:30 AM - The whistling has become my world. It is a constant, unyielding force that fills the silence of the Georgian night with its eerie song. I can no longer remember a time when it wasn't there, haunting me, taunting me.

November 9, 2024, 4:45 AM - In the depths of my isolation, I sought solace in the written word, hoping to find escape within the pages of my books. But the Whistling Man's tune has seeped into every line, every word, turning tales of joy into stories of horror.

November 9, 2024, 6:00 AM - As the first light of dawn broke the horizon, I dared to dream that the nightmare had ended. But the respite was short-lived. With the setting of the sun, the whistling returned, more insistent, more demanding than ever before.

November 9, 2024, 11:50 PM - The day passed in a haze of fear and anticipation. Each tick of the clock was a reminder of the inevitable return of the whistling. It has become a countdown to an unknown, yet undoubtedly sinister, conclusion.

November 10, 2024, 2:00 AM - The whistling is now a tempest, a storm of sound that threatens to sweep me away. It is everywhere and nowhere, a spectral serenade that knows no bounds.

I write to you now, Reader, as a man on the brink of madness. The Whistling Man's tune is a relentless assault, a barrage of notes that hammer against the walls of my mind, seeking entry, seeking to dominate and destroy.

The latest email arrived with a subject that sent chills down my spine: "The symphony reaches its crescendo." I fear that the final movement of this macabre composition is upon me.

November 10, 2024, 3:00 AM - The whistling has reached a fever pitch, a cacophony that drowns out all other sounds. It is as if the Whistling Man is calling out to me, beckoning me to join him in the darkness.

I sit here now, Alex Mercer, a man haunted by a melody that knows no mercy. The Whistling Man's tune is a siren song, a lure to a fate that I cannot escape. It is a call to the abyss, a whisper of the end.

If you are reading this, do not mourn for me. Instead, let my tale be a warning to all who hear it. The Whistling Man is not a legend to be taken lightly. He is a reality, a presence that stalks the night, searching for those who will listen to his song.

Do not seek him, do not listen for his whistle. For once it finds you, there is no escape. It will follow you, haunt you, until the very last note is played.

Yours in the shadow of the whistle,
Alex Mercer
