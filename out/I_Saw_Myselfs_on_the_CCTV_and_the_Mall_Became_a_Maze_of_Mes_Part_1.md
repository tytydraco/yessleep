I saw multiple versions of myself on the CCTV and reality itself has dissolved around me. I am trying to write the best I can, for my keyboard feels like liquid while my melting fingers type into it.

I’ve been working security at a dying mall for three years. It’s a place stuck in time—flickering lights, creaky floors, and empty corridors. But last night? Last night, though, the mall showed me something I can’t unsee. Now I’m scared to close my eyes, let alone go back, for should my head start spinning again, I might go mad.

It was 2 a.m., the hour when the world feels like it’s holding its breath. The security office was a coffin of buzzing fluorescents and cracked plastic chairs, the monitors casting a sickly glow across my thermos of cold coffee. I was half-asleep, lulled by the static hum from my radio, when Camera 7—the food court feed—flickered. There I was, walking past the shuttered pretzel kiosk. My navy uniform hung loose on my frame, my slouch unmistakable. But I was here, in the office, not there. The timestamp pulsed: 2:03 a.m., now, alive.

My stomach churned, a violent swirl like gears grinding an old maschine . I grabbed my radio, my voice trembling. “Anyone in the building? Identify yourself!” Only static answered, threaded with a faint whine, like wind through a cracked window. The log showed no one signed in. I was alone. But the mall seemed to disagree.

On the screen, the figure that wore my face froze. He turned, slow as a marionette, and stared into the camera. His eyes were too large, pupils blooming like ink spilled in milk, and his mouth stretched into a smile that wasn’t mine. The smile stretched too far—unnaturally wide, like invisible hands were pulling his face from both sides.

The air in the office thickened, tasting of copper and ozone. He raised a hand, fingers elongating, curling like tendrils, and pointed, not at the camera, but through it—into me. The monitor hissed, and his face pressed against the lens, skin rippling like a pond disturbed by a stone. Then the feed dissolved - into a kaleidoscope of static, colors bleeding into shapes that made my temples throb.

I knocked over my coffee, the liquid pooling on the floor in patterns that looked like spiraling galaxies. My breath caught in shallow gasps, each one jagged, as if the air itself had grown thicker as I cycled through the other cameras.

Camera 12 - east entrance: another me, standing before the glass doors, head tilted so far it touched his shoulder, his shadow stretching across the floor, writhing like a nest of eels.

Camera 4 - the atrium: me, perched on a bench, rocking back and forth, my hands melted into my knees, fingers sinking into the flesh as though I were made of wax, softening under pressure.

Camera 9-  service corridor: me, pacing in a spiral, my footsteps leaving smears of light that pulsed and faded.

Each feed showed a new me, each more wrong.

One crawled across the electronics store’s floor, limbs bending backward, joints popping like wet wood.

Another stood in the fountain, water cascading upward, defying gravity, his reflection a fractured mosaic of eyes and mouths.

The timestamps flickered, numbers dissolving into glyphs—squirming like worms, writhing as though alive. The monitors hummed a low, discordant song, and the walls of the office seemed to pulse, veins of light threading through the plaster.

I tried my phone -dead. The radio spat static, now laced with voices, overlapping, all mine, whispering words I couldn’t grasp. The air grew heavy, pressing against my skin like damp velvet. Then the office door groaned, bending inward as if underwater. I spun around, flashlight beam slicing the dark, but the doorway was a void, swallowing light.

The monitors flickered in unison, and every feed showed *me*, standing in the office, staring at the screens. Behind each me loomed a shadow, taller than the room allowed, its edges fraying into tendrils that coiled around the walls, the ceiling, the air itself. The shadows didn’t move, but their presence burned in my mind, a weight that made my thoughts slippery.

The shadows stretched towards me, and I realized, with a sickening lurch, that they had already started to crawl inside my mind.
