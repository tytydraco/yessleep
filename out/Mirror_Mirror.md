I close the door behind me, locking it. A sigh of relief escapes my mouth as I lean against the wall, exhausted.

I head to the bathroom and let myself relax under the shower.

I turn off the water. I wrap a towel around me and wipe the condensed mirror.

The woman in front of me still feels unfamiliar.

The pills glare at me from the plastic container. I take one with a mouthful of water. This should be my last prescription of these.

I clench the sink's tough surface, my knuckles turning white.

It's fine.

I take a deep breath and head to bed.

I get in bed, pulling the sheets over. Raindrops violently fall against the window—then I hear fingers tapping on the glass. Surely I must've imagined it.

As moonlight reflects on my bedroom wall, shadows of leaves make unusual movements.

If I were a little bit less sane, I could say I see a person's shadow.

But that's not the case anymore.

The movements almost seem deliberate for a hot second, a leaf slowly retreating and coming back from the exact same spot.

While I'm scrolling on my phone, trying to take my mind off the chilling shadows on the wall—I catch a glimpse of something in the corner of my eye.

I know it's my mind playing tricks on me, and yet...

A small pair of eyes creep from below the edge of the bed—observing.

I blink— and it's gone.

What the fuck.

I can feel my heart rate picking up. My breath getting heavier.

CALM DOWN, GRACE.

You don't want back in that awful place.

Only the thought of going back to psych sends a shiver down my spine.

As rain keeps falling, I hear a quick whisper coming from my left ear—

"Don't reflect."

I instantaneously turn my head toward the source.

There's nothing.

Just my troubled expression on the mirror door.

I sigh in relief.

"I need to stop watching horror movies..."

But even as I say that, I can't shake off the feeling of the voice from earlier. There's a lump in my throat.

I'm not scared. Be rational. Rain makes its presence known with violent drops that strike the window.

A high-pitched giggle resounds in the empty room, contrasting the storm outside.

No. It's not happening. You're not hearing anything. You're tired.

I close my eyes.

A knock—but from the mirror. You didn't hear anything.

Another knock. Stop, please.

A little girl's chuckle.

FINE.

I open my eyes. I sit on the bed's edge, facing my own reflection. I look at the mirror—I might be going insane, but I swear I see a little mouth, smiling from the other side of the room reflected onto the glass material.

My muscles lock. I hear slow, exaggerated breathing—drawn out, as if it's mocking me.

Icy liquid beads down my spine. I feel like I can't breathe. She's unfathomably still—the corners of her mouth parting uncannily into a gummy grin, revealing all her teeth.

My trembling hand reaches the lamp on the nightstand beside me. Light turns on—but there's nothing in the mirror...

Inhale 1...2...3...4...5

Hold 1...2...3...4

Exhale 1...2...3...4...5

It's over—you're going to prove yourself wrong. You're not seeing things anymore.

Inhale... Everything is better now.

Hold... It's not real.

Exhale...

THUD

I jump at the sudden sound. Something must have fallen in the hallway.

I let out a shaky breath—my hands quiver. I look towards the source of the noise with gut-wrenching anticipation.

Through the patterned glass on the door, moonlight shimmers gently.

The hallway lights flicker on.

Please... stop—I'm supposed to be healthy...

Lights dance only to reveal a black silhouette of a man.

He's holding something—a hatchet. Lights flicker again, and the man is gone. I'm hyperventilating.

I run as fast as my legs can hold me. I sprint down the stairs to the closest door near my house. I knock desperately on my neighbor's door, my hoarse voice pleading for their help.

John responds.

"Grace! Jesus! What happened?"

"JOHN! JOHN, PLEASE HELP ME, I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING INSANE!"

"Take it easy! I'm here, tell me what happened, okay? Breathe, Grace."

I'm on the couch, the warmth of the mug calming my senses.

I told him everything. John is the only one I can trust after everything that happened to me. He was the only one to visit me regularly after being sent to the psych ward.

Everyone else cut me off.

My own family didn't care as much as this man did—or at the very least, showed it way less than John.

"Listen, we'll take care of this tomorrow, alright? Just take the pills and rest. We'll figure it out together."

A calming expression rests on his face as he reassures me— but a small twitch in his eye gives him away.

He only does that when he's extremely stressed.

A wave of guilt punches my gut as I notice the small detail.

After taking the pills, I snuggle against him.

I wake up.

What's going on?...

Familiar men in white coats check on me, asking me questions.

Miss Miller, can you hear us?

Realization hits.

No. No. No. No. No. No.

"JOHN!! YOU SON OF A BITCH!" I scream, voice raw.

I struggle against the tight ropes.

"I FUCKING TRUSTED YOU."

"Miss, I'm going to need you to calm down. You're safe now."

Safe Safe Safe Safe Safe Safe

I'll never feel safe.

1 month later

My body walks as if on autopilot toward the bathroom. I'm accompanied by a nurse. She waits for me by the door.

I wash my hands and splash some cold water on my face.

I look in the mirror.

No.

A small hand presses gently against the mirror—so softly it feels like a warning.

I stumble back, nearly falling.

Inhale. 1...2...3...

The hand clenches into a tiny fist. It strikes. THUD.

I flinch. I swallow hard.

Hold. 1...2...

Another blow—harder. THUD.

My breath catches in my throat.

Exhale... 1...

Last hit—creaks fracture the fragile surface.

Pitch black.

I hear muffled screams of the nurse calling for help— and the cold surface of tiles against the side of my face. A high-pitched ringing envelops my auditory senses as I drift into a terrifying nightmare.
