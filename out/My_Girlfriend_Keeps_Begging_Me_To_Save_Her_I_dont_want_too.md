I woke up last night to my girlfriend crawling on the walls and begging me for help. She came to her senses again, as blood dripped out of her nose and eyes. Every night she pleads with me to save her, because I'm the only one who can. I'm the only one who knows how and every night I choose not to. Then as the morning comes her pleading goes from English, to Aramaic, then back to English and finally, she's normal once again.

I came to this Town three months ago to help People.

Ever since I was a young child, that's all I wanted to do. I grew up in church, went to every service and grew close to God. When the time came to take up my own calling, I became an evangelist. I would travel from Town to Town bringing People to God. I was so good at it that when I left a Town, there wasn't a single person who hadn't converted. It was all about saving souls and in that time I guess I forgot about my own life and needs.

Then the call came in for this Small Church Town, out in the middle of nowhere, they desperately needed help. Strange things were happening to the Young Woman here. No one else wanted to come, so I did. 

Melissa was here to meet me when I got off the train.

She was a worship leader in the local church. For those of you who don't know, the worship leader is the first line of defense against spirits in a church. Before the pastor comes in to give the word, the worship leader fights off any spirits People bring into church with praise and worship and encourages the congregation to do the same.

Over the next few days we went from home to home and it became clear that there was a pandemic here. Demons had come into this town like a virus and were taking over the bodies of Young Woman. Unfortunately, at the time, we never figured out how. 

All we could do was get to work, and that's exactly what we did. We found young girls who crawled up walls, young women who spoke languages they could never have learned. Women who hovered in the air and others who mutilated their own bodies. It was the thing of nightmares.

However they were no match for us, we worked together praying and casting out demons and as the pandemic slowed down and started to disappear, we fell in love.

When we had cast out the last of the demons, I decided it would be a good idea for me to stay in town and spend some time with her. 

Slowly we fell deeper and deeper into love

Everything she did was perfect, the way she treated me was perfect and the time we spent together was just perfect. Everything was going exactly the way it should have and it seemed like I was finally focusing on my own needs, until one strange night.

A loud crying had started to emanate from the town. Rushing outside I found several people in the street, all at once, seven girls had taken their own lives. The screams continued into the morning as their families mourned for them. 

We had a mass funeral for those young women. I thought I had saved them, I thought I had changed their lives for the better, I clearly didn't. It didn't make sense to me, until it started happening to my girlfriend too.

After one particularly intense prayer session, things started to become clear. I thought I was praying for the other girls in the town, but the one I should have been praying for was right in front of me.

As I invoked the name of God my girlfriend started to jerk and spasm, she went into a corner of the house and her voice got deeper. She told me the truth. 

She was the main demon, the first one, once she had taken over the worship leader, the town was defenseless against spirits. Then the other demons attacked, possessing every young woman they could find. Every time we prayed and tried to cast them out, they just faked leaving. The only thing left for me to do was cast out the demon in my girlfriend and everyone else would be saved, every demon would be cast out with its leader.

I never did.

Now another girl dies each day in this town and I don't know if I can do anything about it. You see I never met the real Melissa. I only met the demon inside her, the demon I fell in love with. I don't know if I can get rid of the demon, because it's honestly the love of my life.

Every night my girlfriend crawls on the walls, speaks in different languages and then when she comes to her senses she begs me for help. I don't think I can ever help her, because I love the thing possessing her body more than anyone else.
