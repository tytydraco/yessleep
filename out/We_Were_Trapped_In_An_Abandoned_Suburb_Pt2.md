We had walked in a straight line for nearly two hours and came back to 52 Magnolia Way. We trembled as we felt the weight of what was transpiring fall on us like a ton of bricks. We broke down under the burden of soul crushing dread. 

“That… That doesn't make any sense.” Yazmine whimpered, her hand slowly releasing from mine. 

Zack let out a strangled cry and crumbled to the ground, his tears dripping onto the asphalt. He hollered until his voice cracked. 

“No,” John shook his head and stepped backwards, “someone's gotta be playing a prank on us. I-I mean, they gotta be!”

“What type of elaborate fucking prank is that?!” Bryce screamed in his face. 

“I don't fucking know, alright?!” John screamed back, pushing him out of his personal space. 

“That's not possible!” I told John, swiveling around to face him with tears trickling down my face. “This wasn't here a few hours ago, it's not possible to change the entire layout of a town just for a prank-” 

“Okay!” John snapped, throwing his hands in the air. “Then I don't know! What do you want me to say?! That the ghosts did it?!” 

“Jesus Christ,” I moaned in exasperation as I took my glasses off and rubbed my eyes. 

“That's exactly what the hell is going on, don't even pretend it's not!” Vanessa argued with us, all while still filming. 

“I've had enough of that fucking camera!” Yazmine lunged for her and Vanessa ducked out the way. 

“Stop!”  I came between them as Yazmine fought to take the camera away, her face flushed red from anger. 

Vanessa was smiling, but it was a pathetic and weak smile, and her lips were trembling as tears ran down her cheeks. “I'm not doing anything.” She said quietly, wiping snot from her nose. “Just let me have this.” 

“Yaz, chill out,” I grabbed my best friend's shoulders and held her firmly at bay. She breathed deeply in and out through her nose, her eyes shooting daggers at Vanessa and her teeth worrying her bottom lip. “Fighting isn't helping.” I said in a calmer voice. She jerked her arms out of my grasp and turned away, trying to collect herself. 

“What's going on?” Zack uttered through quiet snobs, his voice nasally with mucus. “Why is this happening to us?” 

“If we go back, will the same thing happen?” John wondered. 

“I'm trying it.” Bryce turned and walked in the direction we had come. 

“Wait,” Vanessa rushed over to him and grabbed his arm but he shrugged her off, “we just came from there!” We rushed to keep up with them as the two bickered. 

“I don't care, we don't have anything to lose from trying,” Bryce replied stubbornly. 

“If the same shit happens… Then that means we're trapped…” Zack looked about ready to have another breakdown. 

John wrapped an arm around him reassuringly, “Don't think like that. We must have gotten turned around somehow.” 

“Bullshit!” Vanessa threw him a dirty look over her shoulder. “You guys are in denial and it's not helping the situation at all. What we need to be doing is trying to appease the spirits, not spending another two hours walking this fucking road.” 

“Appease my ass,” Bryce scoffed, “I'm not gonna-” 

He stopped walking, making Vanessa nearly run into him. 

“What’s-” I cut myself off as I looked ahead and realized what he was staring at. Everyone's gaze fell on a solitary figure, standing just at the edge of the further reaches of our flashlight beams in the center of the road.  

It was a child, made obvious by her height, and Bryce's flashlight highlighted her from the torso down. She wore a filthy, faded purple dress and her feet were bare. She could've been at least eight or nine years old.  

“What's a kid doing out here?” John muttered. 

Bryce lifted the flashlight and illuminated the figure's face, giving us the horrifying truth. 

The girl had no eyes. Only blood-caked, empty eye sockets. Her brown, frizzy hair was matted and tangled. Her skin was bloodless, and her pale lips were pressed into an eerie thin line. She stood still like a statue, not even moving a hair's width, the dark pits in her face emotionlessly boring holes into us. 

We all flinched and drew in a sharp breath, taken aback by the gruesome sight. 

“Oh…Oh my god.” Yazmine's mouth fell open as she staggered backward. “I saw her obituary. That's the Jenkins girl. She's fucking dead. She's dead!”

I couldn't help it, I screamed and ran back towards that dreaded Eye Ripper house, away from that horrifying specter. I could hear the pounding footfalls of the others right behind me, cursing and panting from fear. I scrambled into John's car, still parked outside, in the passenger side seat. 

“Go go go!” I screamed, slapping the dashboard as John threw himself into the driver's seat and took out his car keys. 

“We have to get out of here! Try it again!” Yazmine shouted as she and the others slid into the back seat, their shoulders flush against each other. 

“I'm trying, I'm trying!” John tried to ignite the engine over and over again, but it only spat and spluttered like a wounded animal. 

“This is hopeless.” Vanessa shook her head, camera raised towards the window as she looked for any more unwelcome specters. “They don't want us to leave, so we're not going to be able to. That's why we can't call anyone, that's why we can't walk back, and that's why the car won't start.” 

“Then what do you suppose we do?” I faced her with an annoyed look. 

“Clearly, we disturbed the spirits,” Vanessa began her explanation, “I think it happened when Zack left the game, you're supposed to say a proper goodbye when you're finished communicating with a spirit over the ouija, or else the window between our world and theirs won't close.” 

“Oh, come on,” Zack groaned, “don't put this shit on me.”

“I think this place was already fucked to begin with,” Yazmine theorized, “we just should've never came here, that was our mistake. And I know I begged you guys to come, so I'm sorry.” 

“To think I almost stayed at home…” Bryce groaned, head in his hands. 

“We can't sit here pointing fingers, we have to figure out a solution,” I said, looking at the house in front of us warily, “Vanessa, Yazmine, since you guys seem to know so much about ghosts do you have any idea how we can get out of this?” 

“Like I said,” Vanessa replied, “appease them.” 

“Appease them fucking *how?”* I pressed. 

Vanessa seemed surprised at my aggression, “Er, uh- we go in there, we get out the board, we apologize, and end the game correctly this time.” She shot a glare at Zack and he threw his middle finger up at her. 

“‘In there'?” Bryce looked at her like she was crazy. “In where, the house where we caught that thing in the basement on camera?! In *there?!”*

“Yes, in there!” Vanessa glared at him. “Unless you have any better ideas?” 

“Let's do it,” John said. He was the last person I expected to follow along. “I didn't believe in ghosts before but I guess I can't argue with whatever the fuck we saw back there.”

“Let's do this, and quick.” Yazmine agreed. 

“I'm not going back in there!” Zack shrunk in on himself. 

“Bro, there's six of us against one creepy little girl,” John tried to reason with him.

“And it might not work without every participant,” Vanessa added. 

It took some nagging to get Zack to agree to leave the car, but eventually we found ourselves going back inside. First John went out the car and checked our surroundings, and when he deduced there were no scary dead girls lurking about, we all got out next, took the ouija board from the trunk, and hurried through the front door. Bryce locked it. 

“Ghosts aren't deterred by locked doors, babe,” Yazmine raised an eyebrow. 

“Whatever,” Bryce waved her away, “let's get this apology thing over with.” 

“Are we gonna have to go back down in the basement?” I asked, hoping that wasn't the case. 

“That's where the kids died.” Vanessa nodded grimly. “We have to.” 

We filed down the basement slowly, flinching at every creak of the wood under our shoes. We scoured the whole place with flashlights, making sure no one was hiding, then sat down around the board like we did earlier. The atmosphere was heavy and foreboding. Once again, Vanessa set up the camera to film, and Yazmine lit four candles. We all piled our hands on top of the planchette, candle light flickering over our sweaty and nervous faces. 

“I-is there anyone there?” Yazmine stammered, all her nerves from the first time gone without a trace. 

This time, when the planchette moved under our hands, we didn't deny a ghost was doing it. We simply held our breath and watched as it landed on the word “Yes.” 

“Listen,” Yazmine choked out through a sob, “we just want to say we're sorry for bothering you all in here, we were just - I don't know, we were just trying to have fun and-”  

She stopped talking as the planchette spelled out a word. F. O. R. G. I. V. E.N. 

“It says we're forgiven!” I smiled and wiped away a tear. 

“So then…we can leave?” Zack asked unsurely. 

The planchette started moving again. L. E. A. V. E. Y. O. U. R. E. Y. E. S. 

“It said ‘leave your eyes,’” Vanessa whispered. My heart skipped a beat.

“We can't leave without our eyes, dipshits!” Bryce screamed towards the ceiling. 

That's when all hell broke loose. 

Suddenly, Yazmine, who was sitting right across from me, screamed and backpedaled away from the Ouija board. She was looking at me. No… she was looking… 

Behind me? 

I turned around, and an eyeless child, the boy I'd seen in the window, was standing over me.

Everything happened all at once. Everyone screamed the loudest and hardest I've ever heard them scream, and at the same time, the little boy's eye sockets and mouth yawned open into massive holes unnaturally elongating his white face. A ragged screech tore from his throat, and the ouija board suddenly picked itself up, along with the candles, and soared across the room, slamming into the wall. 

We all fought with each other to get up the stairs first, clambering and shoving and stampeding towards the door and away from that horrible banshee caterwaul the entity below was releasing. Zack tried to claw his way past me, and I shouldered him aside, our actions driven by pure and primal fear. He stumbled and fell down the stairs, and my mind in its state of fight or flight didn't register this immediately. Once we were in the kitchen, we turned towards the basement door as Zack's screams of terror spilled out from the darkness. 

“Zack!” John yelled, running for the stairs. 

Bryce held him back. “We need to go!” 

“Go where?” Yazmine cried, spinning in a circle.  “We're trapped!” 

Zack's screams were suddenly cut off very abruptly, and we all froze up for a single, petrified moment. 

“Anywhere but here!” I blurted before turning and dashing out the kitchen, down the hallway, and through the front door. I could hear the others following me. 

I had no plan, but as soon as I saw the neighboring vacant house to the right, I beelined straight for it. Thank God, it was unlocked, too, and also deserted while being fully furnished, like the tenants had left in a hurry, and the layout of the floor plan was identical. We threw ourselves through the front door and fled into the living room.

John immediately rushed to lock everything and cover the windows with the curtains. Yazmine curled up in a corner behind an armchair recliner and rocked back and forth, her face soaked with her tears. Bryce looked about ready to cry himself, but he somehow held himself back as he furiously paced the floor and muttered to himself. Vanessa sat herself down on the sofa, camera still held in her hand as if it were glued to it, and pathetically filmed us as she shook like a leaf. 

“What the fuck was that…” I murmured as I slowly slid my back down the wall until I was sitting on the floor. I had managed to grab my flashlight on the way out the basement, and it seemed John and I were the only ones that remembered to. 

“A spirit.” Vanessa replied, her voice completely hollow. “We should've never come.”  

“I'm gonna make sure nothing's in here.” John grabbed an old, dusty walking cane that was leaning against the wall as a weapon and left the living room. 

“You can't hurt a spirit that way.” Vanessa called after him. He ignored her. She got up and traipsed over to Yazmine, crouching and putting the camera in her face. “So, Yazzy, confession cam time. What do you have to say for yourself now that you know you're going to be the reason for our deaths?” Yazmine said nothing, staring into space and swaying back and forth. 

“Come on,” Bryce weakly protested. 

“Hey!” I snapped. “Leave her alone. You wanted to come just as much as her, in fact you were the first person to agree to going.”

“Don't even get me started on you,” Vanessa spun around and shoved the camera in my face next, “I know you pushed Zack. You two were behind everyone, but I know he didn't just accidentally fall down the stairs. You should ‘fess up to your sins before you die.” 

I felt sick to my stomach. How did she know if she was ahead of us? Did she look back at the wrong second? “Listen, he was shoving me, too,” I argued, afraid that I was going to be ostracized for this fatal mistake. 

Vanessa threw her head back and laughed. “Oh my God, dude, I was just shitting you, I didn't know you actually did it. Wow, you're like, a murderer.”

“Shut up!” I pushed her and she fell back on her ass, but she simply stared up at me through the camera lens with a taunting smile. 

“Guys, this is really not the time for a cat fight.” Bryce stepped between us, giving me a warning glare. 

Suddenly, we were startled by a pounding on the door. We all leapt to our feet, our caveman instincts ready to take over at the sign of danger again, but a familiar voice bled through the door.

“Hey, let me in!” Zack pleaded, banging the door some more. “Hurry up! Before they notice!” 

I ran to unlock the front door and threw it open to the sight of Zack, sweaty and breathing hard, his glasses missing. He rushed past me and I quickly closed and locked the door, but not before catching a glimpse of the outside. It was void of life on the street, thankfully, as I had half expected to see either of the creepy ghost children again. 

Zack stood in the center of the room, bent over with his hands on his knees and panting heavily. John came from upstairs just then. He seemed shocked like the rest of us. “You're alive?!”

“Barely!” Zack said. 

“You were screaming so much!” Yazmine said. 

“We thought for sure that thing back there had gotten you.” Bryce nodded. We all looked at Zack as if we were beholding a miracle. 

“It chased me, but I got away.” Zack walked over to the corner and turned his head towards the ceiling. “Thank Christ I got away. That was the most terrifying moment of my entire life.” 

“We need to figure out where to go from here.” I said, pushing my glasses up my nose. 

“Well, apologizing clearly didn't fucking work,” Yazmine grumbled.  

“Let's think about what we know about them,” I mused, “they were brutally murdered by a psycho, and they want their eyes back…” 
 
“Oh, yes, let's magically conjure up a set of working eyes for each of them!” Vanessa retorted. 

“You know, another crazy thing about this case is that their eyes were never found…” Yazmine said slowly. “Some people say that maybe he ate them, or just disposed of them, but no one knows. Not even his own eyes were found.”

“Yeah, because more creepy stories is exactly what we need right now,” Bryce quipped. 

“What if…” Yazmine seemed to brainstorm, slowly pacing the room. “...What if the eyes are still here?” 

“Huh?” John squinted at her. 

“Sometimes ghosts haunt people to get them to find their remains,” Yazmine explained, “what if their eyes were actually in that house all this time, but the police just never found them? I mean, he hid their bodies in the walls, he could've hid their eyes, too.” 

We all stared at her. I shook my head. “Yazmine, that's an insane theory.” 

“They said they're looking for their eyes!” Yazmine replied indignantly. 

“That doesn't mean they're still around! And if they are, they're probably rotted into dust by now!” Bryce scoffed. 

“I think it's worth a shot.” John said. He noticed the look we gave him. “Listen, I don't know about you guys, but I don't enjoy being trapped with a bunch of little demons, so I'm willing to try just about everything to get out of here, even if it means looking for rotted dusty old eyes.”

“Or we could sacrifice someone.” 

We all stared at Zack. Up until then, he has been standing awkwardly against the corner of the wall listening to us since he last spoke. He stared back stoically, and I realized he was dead serious. 

“Come again?” Vanessa raised an eyebrow. 

“They want our eyes, so, we should pick someone to sacrifice and give them that person's eyes,” Zack said as he stepped forward slowly, “then they'll be satisfied and leave us alone. I think that person should be Yazmine, since she led you all here.” 

“He's definitely going nuts.” Bryce cautiously kept an eye on Zack, protectively putting an arm over Vanessa and making her back away from him. Meanwhile, Yazmine confronted the skinny boy. 

“Oh yeah? You think that's funny?” Yazmine pushed him back against the wall. “Who do you think you are? You're only hanging with us anyways because John felt bad for you. Get back in your place before I put you there, asshole.” 

“You have pretty eyes.” Zack seemed unfazed and stared, unblinkingly, at Yazmine. In fact, I didn't remember seeing him blink much at all. Was he really losing his sanity? 

“Babe, do you hear this jerk?” Yazmine looked to Bryce for help, and frowned as she saw he was just letting Vanessa cower behind him and not making a move to stand up for her. “The hell? You just gonna let him talk to me like that?” 

“Listen, I don't think you guys should start a fight,” Bryce meekly said. 

“Zack, what's gotten into you?” John asked earnestly, appearing genuinely concerned. “Now's not the time for your weird sense of humor, man.” 

Suddenly, there was a rustling of a bush coming from outside, where dead shrubbery lined the exterior walls. I held a finger to my lips to signal them all to be quiet, creeping over to the window. I discreetly peeked through the smallest crack in the curtains and saw a little girl, this time blonde with a bloodstained pink shirt and white shorts, crouching in the bushes with her face in her hands as if she were crying but no sound came out. She was eerily still with flesh white as snow. I slowly backed away and gestured for everyone to go upstairs.

They followed me up and I closed us inside a bedroom and drew the curtains over the single window in there. The room was furnished with a big bed, a vanity dresser, and a nightstand, with a closet door in the corner. It was obvious by the decoration that everything was from a different era.

“We're just more isolated in here,” Vanessa complained. 

“I feel better closed up in here than down there,” I replied, glancing quickly at my exhausted face in the vanity mirror. 

“What was it?” Yazmine asked nervously. “The Jenkins girl again?”

“No, it was a different little girl,” I swallowed a lump in my throat, “she was blonde and had on a pink shirt and shorts. She was just- just sitting there, curled up with her face in her hands like she was either crying or playing hide and seek.”

I could see everyone's faces fall in fear, except for Zack's, he seemed absolutely emotionless all of a sudden, but he had been the most dramatic out of all of us so far so maybe he had tired himself out. 

“That sounds like Sarah,” Vanessa whispered, turning the camera to me, “that was the outfit she went missing in.” Leave it to a diehard true crime fan like Vanessa to remember even the smallest details about a homicide case she was obsessed with. 

“Soullessness hurts.” Zack quietly spoke, his voice void of emotion or any inflection. 

We all turned to him, and there was a beat of silence. He was facing towards the wall, away from us, just blankly staring at the flowery wallpaper that was peeling and faded with age. I frowned and took a step back. Something didn't feel right about him. His presence felt…off, compared to before, he didn't feel like the same person anymore. 

“What's his deal?” Bryce asked John, gesturing to him.  

“He's just traumatized,” John defended him, walking towards him, “you alright, Zack? I know what happened in the basement was-” He grabbed Zack’s arm and suddenly let go with a jolt of surprise going through his body, as if he had touched a hot stovetop.  

“What?” Vanessa asked. 

“He's ice cold, man,” John shook his head, bewildered as he looked at his own fingertips, “like he's been in a freezer. I think you should lie down.” 

Zack let John ease him onto the queen sized, canopy bed (like those princess beds with the curtains I dreamed of having when I was ten). Zack laid down on his back with his blank gaze fixed upward, not saying a word more and not making eye contact with any of us. 

“Look, I think we need to go through with my plan,” Yazmine brought all our attention back to her. “Zack's clearly in shock, we have to get him out of here.” 

“For once, I agree,” Vanessa sighed, “we have to do something.” 

“This is crazy,” Bryce shook his head, “I'm not going back to that house.” 

“Then stay,” John replied harshly, “look after Zack. Does everyone still have their walkies?” 

I patted the walkie still attached to my belt loop, hovering over my jeans. Yazmine nodded after checking to see that her walkie was still clipped to the breast pocket of her pink sweat jacket. Bryce took his walkie out his jeans pocket and Vanessa took hers out the pouch of Bryce's hoodie, which she was still wearing. John had his in his belt loop as well. 

“Great, since phones don't work, maybe we can communicate that way?” John lifted the walkie to his mouth. *“Testing, testing-”* 

“Sh!” I shushed him as his voice filtered through our walkies. “So are we doing this or what?” 

 “Let's go around back so that thing doesn't see us,” Yazmine suggested. We all agreed and she turned to Bryce and hugged him tightly, in case it would be the last embrace they ever had. He awkwardly patted her back. She went to give him a kiss, but he turned his face away. “What's wrong?” 

“Look around us, *everything* is wrong.” Bryce didn't look at her. 

“Whatever,” Yazmine stormed towards the door, trying to hide the hurt of rejection on her face. “Look after Zack and tell us if you need help. John, Grace, Vanessa, come on.”

Little did we know how much worse things would get from that point on...
