Hi. My name is Elias and I'm currently holed up in a shitty motel that I'm pretty sure is infested with ants. But that’s not really the point of this; the point is I'm looking for help or maybe even an answer to this horrid twist life has taken.

It started a month and a half ago when I finally managed to save enough money to move out of my parents house. After searching through Facebook groups and listing websites, I finally found an apartment complex on the other side of town. It wasn’t as close to my job as I had been hoping, but if it meant getting away from the problem that is my family, it was going to have to do. So after a quick look at the available apartment and an agreement on the lease, I packed up my belongings and got started on a new chapter of my life.

With the help of some friends, we set up what little I had in a matter of five days. The apartment was a typical layout; one bedroom, a bathroom, and an open space that was half living room and half kitchen. I even got to meet a few of my neighbors while moving in.

The apartment beside mine was owned by an elderly couple named Alan and Ingrid. They told me they had been there for over twenty years and babysat for most of the children that came and went throughout the passing decades. They seemed excited that someone was finally moving into the apartment beside theirs and told me their door was always open if I had trouble.

Across the hall was an older man, maybe early thirties, named Jorge. He came by when his dog, Bennie, bolted out the front door and into my apartment. We had spent at least twenty minutes luring the animal out from under the sink in the bathroom and when he finally decided to come out, Jorge sighed and apologized. I told him I didn’t mind and actually had a liking for dogs, even mentioned the one I owned growing up. He gave quite an… interesting response to that. Jorge had looked me up and down real slow, like he was inspecting every inch of my body. Then, with a big toothy grin, he said,

“Bet you’re a handful just like ‘em.”

Yeah, I did not like that. Thankfully, after maybe a five minute staring contest, he gave a nod and left.

The people in the apartment next to him were less odd but still left a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. It was a family. A dad, mom, and two twin girls. The girls, Lacey and Alice, seemed excited to see me and even gave me some drawings they had made as a welcome gift. Their father, Leon, gave me a firm handshake and said it was nice to see a younger face around the building. He said it was mainly elderly that came and went, which really confused me seeing as how close it was to the public elementary and middle schools. But I brushed off the thought and turned to his wife with my hand raised for a handshake.

She didn’t take it. Instead, she stared into my eyes for a solid minute before looking at her husband. He stiffened, coughed, and reached out to lower my hand.

“She uh,” a pause, I watched as his adams apple bobbed “She doesn’t like being touched.”

“Oh.” I felt embarrassed now, glancing between them both before I managed to smile at the woman “Sorry about that. I’ll make sure to keep my distance.”

She smiled, nodded, then ushered the girls inside. They whined and tugged on my sleeves for a bit but after a stern glare from their mother, they mumbled their goodbyes and ran off into the apartment. After another handshake with their father, he soon followed after and shut the door, leaving me alone with his wife. We just kind of stared at each other, not really saying anything. She didn’t seem like much of  a talker. But after a pure minute of silence, I got uneasy.

“I’m uh, I’m Elias by the way.”

She blinked at me.

“What’s uhm…” I trailed off and debated just how worth it this would be “What’s your name?”

She blinked again.

At this point I was starting to give up and even started to turn away to head back into the apartment, I still had some unpacking to do at that point. But as my hand reached for the doorknob, I heard her.

“Willow.”

Her voice was quiet, a little raspy even. I could barely catch the name she had said.

“Willow.” I repeated, nodding along like it was the most interesting name I'd ever heard “Well, it’s nice to meet y-”

The words died on my tongue as I turned around to find myself face to face with her. I could feel her breath fanning my face, the tip of her nose barely brushing against my own. Her pupils were blown. I could barely see the iris. She inhaled just once, shoulders raising and chest puffing out. I don’t even think she let it out when she spoke one more time.

“Welcome home.”

Then just like that, she was gone. Before I could even try to think of a response Willow was rushing down the stairs and to her car in the parking lot. I watched as she got in the driver's seat, turned the key… and looked at me. *Smiled* at me from the first floor to the third before the car backed up, turned, and sped down the street. All I could do was laugh. Short and a little uneasy. I was already starting to regret moving out.

A month had passed since then and I had started to slowly grow closer to my neighbors. Alan liked to take me out on fishing trips and Ingrid taught me how to bake. I can confidently say, I make a damn good peach cobbler. Leon was nice, we mainly just had passing conversations when grabbing the mail or simply passing in the hall. Sometimes Willow would be with him and just smile at me. I try my best to ignore it for the sake of the girls who I had the pleasure of babysitting once or twice when their parents had date nights. Lacey loves to draw and Alice wants to make a movie someday. 

That leaves Jorge. He… how do I even begin? He likes to stare. At certain places. I’d catch him during my drives to work or when I took the girls to the nearby pool. I started wearing shirts with my swim trunks. I tried to be nice, waving or smiling at him when I got back from work. I even offered to walk his dog for him which ended up being a mistake. The first time he brought Bennie over he barged into my home and said something about needing to use the bathroom. When he came out fifteen minutes later, my toothbrush and shampoo were gone. I never walked Bennie again.

But it seemed like the world wasn’t satisfied with that outcome because at the beginning of that very next month, just a few days after the bathroom incident, my car broke down. And my job? Fired me. *‘Can’t do your job without a car to get you there.’* 

Fuck you, John, you slimy bitch.

So there I was. Jobless, carless, and trapped in my apartment while I looked for a job within walking distance. I didn’t bother to fix the car, the thing was a piece of junk anyway and I didn’t really have the money. Plus when I asked the tow service to check what happened, they told me something that still scares me to this day. Basically everything that had a wire had been cut. And when they checked under the dashboard, they found an airtag.

I don’t know where the hell that thing came from. I definitely didn’t put it there and my parents were shit with technology so it couldn’t have been them. I thought maybe whoever messed with my car must have placed it but that didn’t make any sense. Why place a tracker if you were just going to kill everything? And if it wasn’t them… then maybe someone else put it there. Sometime between when I first arrived to when the car was tampered with. Someone was trying to keep an eye on me.

But why do that? I’m no one.

I tried to distract myself by spending more time with my neighbors, the good ones at least. I started filling a journal with all the recipes Ingrid was teaching me and Alan took me to play poker with a few of his buddies. I lost, of course. But they all just laughed and let me keep trying until I eventually won my first game. They cheered, laughed, and I bought a round for the table.

Life was starting to look up again as the weeks went by. I managed to get an interview with the post office downtown and I had another one scheduled with this cute little ice cream parlor my friends and I liked to spend time at. Everything was going my way.

Until I babysat the girls again.

It was around four when they were dropped off, giving a hug and kiss to their mom and dad before the two went off for their usual date night. The girls seemed excited to see me, running around and giggling as I booted up my old GameCube for them to play. Once they heard the familiar menu music from Luigi’s mansion, the giggling stopped and they crashed onto the couch with eager hands reaching for the controller.

“Alright, you little monsters. No fighting over the controller, okay? You get twenty minutes and then you switch.”

“Okay, Mr. Blackwell!”

“If you get stuck I’ll be at the table.” 

I reached down to mess up Alice’s hair before walking off to the table tucked away in the corner where my laptop was waiting. Sliding into the seat, I typed in the password before starting to browse through college websites. I was still looking for a job but I figured it’d be nice to go to school again. I took a couple years off after graduating high school and figured it’d be fun to take some online courses.

I had to have been at the table for only half an hour before I felt a tugging on my pant leg. Looking down, I found Lacey staring up at me with a frown.

“Mr. Blackwell, the light won’t stop blinking again.”

“Blinking...? Honey, the lights are fine, they’re not blinking.”

I gestured to the nearby lamp but her frown only deepened.

“Not that light! The little one!”

Turning around, she pointed towards the bookshelf on the right of the TV. Sure enough, almost completely hidden by the photo on one of the shelves, was a small blinking red light. Standing from the table, I walked over and pushed the photo to the side.

It was a camera.

It was small, square shaped, and solid black except for the red light coming from the top left corner. I’d never felt as nauseous as I did at that moment. I placed my thumb over the lens and picked it up before turning to the girls who were staring at me.

“Lacey, I need you to get my phone so I can call your parents.”

“Am I in trouble?”

“No, no, no… you’re not in trouble. I just need you to get my phone from the nightstand in my room.”

She hesitated, looking from my face to the device in my hand before running off down the hall. When she came back with my phone I called their parents, told them they needed to hurry home, and then stuffed the camera into an old jewelry box. I tried not to show how shaken up I was in front of the girls. They were far too young to understand what was going on and I was *not* going to be the cause of any nightmares.

When their parents finally got home and Willow ushered them into their apartment, I asked to talk to Leon. He seemed hesitant at first, glancing into the hall over his shoulder as he followed me into the apartment. Once we both sat at the table, he seemed to relax and finally looked at me.

“So. You said Lacey… found something?”

“Yeah. She… Fuck man, I don’t even know where to begin. Just,” letting out a heavy sigh, I grabbed the jewelry box and slid it across the table “Look.”

He gave me a strange look, like I had gone insane or something. But he decided to humor me, reaching for the box and lifting the lid just slightly. When he caught sight of the camera still blinking inside, he slammed the lid back onto it with a haunted look in his eyes. Neither of us said anything for a while. Him, from what I assume was shock, and me from waiting for him to start it off. He didn’t, so I let out an awkward cough and gestured to the box.

“I don’t know where it came from or how long i-”

“Did you tell anyone else?”

My hand stilled in the air and I glanced around in confusion.

“I mean… I told you guys to come an-”

Before I knew it Leon was on his feet and fisting his hands in the front of my shirt. He lifted me from the chair and slammed me full force against the wall, body trembling with what was either anger or fear. I think it was both.

*“Did you tell anyone else?!”*

“N-no, I didn’t! I wanted to get the girls out of the apartment before I called the cops!”

“Cops?”

Blue irises darted around the wall behind me as drool covered lips pulled into a smile. *“Cops?”* he repeated, hands tightening as he jostled me.

He leaned in and I turned my head. I could feel his breath fanning the side of my neck as my hands grabbed onto warm wrists, trying to pull his hands out from my shirt. I whimpered, fucking whimpered, as his nose nudged against my skin. I didn’t know what to do. Leon was bigger than me, stronger than me. I didn’t know if he was going to kill me or… do something else. All I knew what that I was scared and trapped in my own fucking home. As I felt his lips touch flesh, I decided to try and scream for help. But before I could, I heard a cough. We both stilled and looked at the doorway and right there like a beam of light in a world of darkness,

“Ingrid!”

I started crying at the sight of her, one hand reaching out like this frail old lady was somehow going to manage to get this six foot beast off of me. And to my surprise, and relief, she kind of did. With one stern look she had Leon dropping me on the floor and shuffling out of the apartment with his head hung. As soon as the door to his own shut, she walked towards me and knelt onto the floor.

“Are you alright, dear?”

“He… I thought,”

“I know, I know. You’re safe now.”

I collapsed into her arms, sobbing into her shoulder as she continued to shush me. We were on the floor for maybe ten minutes before I finally started to calm down. Rising off the floor, I glanced briefly at the jewelry box before picking it up and holding it out. Ingrid seemed to understand, taking the box from my hands and checking what was inside. She shut it just like Leon had, instead this time, she let out an almost sad sigh and placed the box back on the table.

“Have you called the cops, dear?”

“No, I...I haven’t. I was gonna do it right after telling Leon.”

“Don’t.”

“W-what?”

Reaching out, she grabbed my hands and looked me in the eyes.

“Listen to me, dear. You are not going to call the cops. You’re going to put the camera back where you found it and go about life like usual.”

“Ingrid I don’t understand-”

“I know you don’t. But you need to trust me… put it back.”

And she left. She just let me go and walked out, leaving me with more questions that I had started with. She wanted me to just put the camera back and pretend this whole thing never happened? That thing had been in my apartment for god knows how long, capturing and recording my every move! And to make it worse, whoever planted that now had footage of the girls! I couldn’t let this creep get away with something like that. So despite Ingrid's words, I packed a bag and left with the jewelry box in my pocket.

So yeah. Now I’m in a motel about a mile away. For whatever reason, no one wants me to give that camera to the authorities. Ingrid looked so worried when she told me to put it back, like she knew something was going to happen if I didn’t. And Leon, god I don’t even know what happened to him. I don’t know if I *want* to know. Just the idea of me telling the cops about the camera set him off like a wild animal. Whoever left the camera must’ve threatened them or something. Honestly? That was the least of my worries.

First thing tomorrow morning I’m bringing the camera to the cops and telling them everything that I know. For now I just wanted to get the word out and see if maybe this has happened to anyone else. 

Please, if you've ever found a camera in your home, help me.
