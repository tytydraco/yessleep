Please, just read this. Don't dismiss it as a creepypasta or some creative writing exercise. I don't have anywhere else to turn. The police would have me committed, my friends would think I was on drugs, and I don't have any family left to call. I’m writing this down because I need some record of it to exist outside of my own head. Because I’m starting to think my head isn’t a safe place anymore. I need to know I’m not insane, even if the evidence is piling up against me.

My name is Leo. I’m 28. I work a boring data entry job from my small apartment. My life, until about a month ago, was a flat line of routine and predictability. I would give anything, *anything*, to have that back.

It all started with the mirror.

It’s an old thing, tall and imposing with a heavy, dark wood frame carved with details that are hard to focus on, like leaves and faces that seem to shift when you’re not looking directly at them. I bought it for next to nothing at a cluttered antique shop that was closing down. The old man who sold it to me had a cataract in one eye that made it look like a clouded marble. He just grunted when I asked the price and took my cash without looking at me. I should have seen that as an omen. At the time, I just thought I’d gotten a bargain. I hung it on my bedroom wall, opposite my bed. It made the small room feel bigger. That was my first mistake.

The first sign that something was wrong was subtle. So subtle I thought I was imagining it. You know that feeling when you’re exhausted, when your brain is lagging a half-second behind reality? It was like that. I’d be brushing my teeth in the bathroom, and I’d turn my head. In the reflection, my head would turn a fraction of a second later. A tiny, almost imperceptible delay. A neurological hiccup. I’d shake my head, blame it on lack of sleep, and move on.

But it kept happening. I’d walk past a shop window, and my reflection would take one extra step after I’d already stopped. I’d be on a video call for work, and my own image on the screen would seem to blink just after I did. It was like watching the world on a bad internet connection. A constant, low-level desynchronization that was just enough to put my teeth on edge.

I tried to rationalize it. I told myself it was my brain playing tricks on me, a symptom of stress from my monotonous job. I started taking vitamins. I tried meditating. I forced myself to go to bed earlier. But the lag persisted, a tiny crack in the foundation of my reality.

The first time I felt true, cold-in-your-stomach fear was about three weeks ago. I was getting dressed for the day, standing in front of the antique mirror. I reached for a plain grey t-shirt from my closet. In the mirror, the other Leo—my reflection—reached for a blue one.

I froze. My hand was hovering over the grey shirt. His hand was hovering over a blue one. A blue shirt that I don’t own. I’ve never owned it. I stared, my heart hammering against my ribs like a trapped bird. For a long moment, we were both perfectly still. Then, very slowly, his eyes in the mirror lifted and met mine. And he smiled.

It wasn’t a friendly smile. It was a small, tight, knowing smirk. It was the expression of someone who has a secret, a terrible and wonderful secret. Then, as quickly as it happened, it was over. I blinked, and the reflection was normal again. He was me, hand hovering over the same grey shirt, a neutral, slightly confused expression on his face. My face.

I stumbled back, away from the mirror, my breath coming in ragged gasps. I didn’t get dressed. I called in sick to work and spent the day huddled on my sofa, as far from the bedroom as I could get. I told myself it was a hallucination. A waking dream. It had to be.

But the game had started. And he was the only one who knew the rules.

He began to change things. Small things, at first. I’d be looking in the mirror, and for a split second, my brown eyes would be a piercing, unfamiliar green in the reflection. He’d be wearing a watch on his wrist, a sleek, silver thing I’d never seen before. I’d look down at my own wrist, and it would be bare. When I looked back up, his was bare too. He was testing me. Teasing me.

I tried to fight back. I took a bedsheet and draped it over the large mirror in my bedroom. The sense of relief was immediate and overwhelming. But it didn't last. That evening, I was washing dishes, and I glanced at the dark, reflective surface of the microwave. I saw my kitchen behind me, but I wasn't in the reflection. He was. He was standing by the counter, where I was, but he was just watching me, drying a plate that wasn't there with a towel that didn't exist. His expression was one of patient amusement.

He wasn't just in the mirror anymore. He was in any surface that could cast an image. The screen of my phone when it was locked. The black mirror of my television when it was off. A puddle on the pavement after it rained. A polished silver spoon. He was everywhere. There was no escape. My own apartment had become a house of mirrors, a prison where the warden was my own face.

The psychological toll was immense. Sleep became a luxury I couldn't afford. Every time I closed my eyes, I was terrified of what he might be doing. I started hearing things. A faint tapping sound, coming from the bedroom. I’d lie awake on the sofa, listening to it. *Tap. Tap. Tap.* It sounded like a fingernail on glass. It was coming from behind the sheet I’d hung over the mirror. He was knocking. He wanted me to let him out.

The physical world started to blur with his. One morning, I was shaving, leaning over the bathroom sink, trying to ignore my own face in the small, uncovered cabinet mirror. I saw that his reflection had a long, thin, red scratch running down its left cheek. I felt a chill go through me. I finished shaving, my hands shaking, and went to the kitchen to make coffee. As I was waiting for it to brew, I idly touched my own left cheek. My fingers came away with a smear of blood. I rushed back to the bathroom. There it was. A long, thin, red scratch, identical to the one I’d seen on him. It hadn't been there a minute ago. I hadn't felt a thing.

He could touch me now. He could affect my reality.

That’s when the memory gaps started. I’d be in the living room, reading a book, and then I’d “wake up” in the kitchen, with no recollection of having moved. The book would be back on the shelf. A half-eaten apple would be on the counter. It was only a few minutes of lost time, but it was terrifying. Was I moving, or was he moving me?

He started getting bolder. More malicious. I was on another video call for work, trying my best to act normal, to focus on the spreadsheets and ignore my own face in the corner of the screen. My boss was talking, and I saw my reflection on the screen smile that terrible, knowing smile. Then my mouth opened, and I heard myself interrupt my boss. I said something awful, something personal and cruel about his recent divorce. The words just came out. I hadn't thought them. I hadn't wanted to say them. The entire call went silent. I saw the shock and hurt on my boss’s face. In the corner of the screen, my reflection looked deeply satisfied. I stammered an apology and disconnected, my body trembling with a mixture of shame and pure terror. He was taking control. Not just of my reflection, but of my voice, my actions.

I stopped leaving the apartment. I couldn't risk it. I couldn't risk what he might make me do or say. I ordered groceries online. I told my work I had a family emergency and needed to take indefinite leave. They were probably relieved to be rid of me after my outburst. My world shrank to the four walls of my apartment, a fortress that was also my cage.

The isolation made it worse. I had no one to talk to, no one to ground me. It was just me and him. And he was getting stronger every day. The lost time became more frequent, the gaps longer. I’d lose an hour, sometimes two. I’d find things in my apartment that I didn’t recognize. A book on quantum physics on my nightstand (I’m not a reader of science). A single, elegant black feather on my pillow. A half-finished sketch of a bird in a notebook, drawn with a skill I do not possess. He had hobbies. He had interests. He was building a life for himself inside of mine.

Last week, I had a dream. It was the most vivid dream of my life. I was inside the mirror. I was standing in a cold, grey, silent version of my bedroom. I could see the real room through the glass, vibrant and full of life. I saw myself—no, I saw *him*—sleeping in my bed. As I watched, he woke up. He stretched, got out of bed, and walked over to the mirror. He looked straight at me. I was trapped, a silent, screaming ghost behind the glass. I pounded on the invisible barrier, but I made no sound. He just watched me, his expression unreadable. Then he smiled that smile, raised a hand, and placed it flat against the glass. On my side, I felt an unbearable, freezing cold spread from the point of contact. He leaned in close, his breath fogging the glass on his side, and he whispered something I couldn't hear. Then he turned and walked away, starting my day. My life. I was the reflection now.

I woke up on the floor, shivering, the sheet torn down from the mirror. I was staring up at my own reflection, which was looking down at me from the bed.

That’s when I knew he wasn’t just trying to torment me. He was trying to switch places.

Which brings me to tonight. To right now. I’ve been sitting here for hours, trying to write this, trying to get the story straight. My back is to the window. It’s dark outside, so the glass has become another perfect, black mirror. I’ve been trying so hard not to look at it. I can feel his presence behind me, a cold spot in the room. I can feel his eyes on my back.

A few minutes ago, my curiosity, or maybe my fear, finally won. I couldn't resist. I had to see what he was doing. I slowly, carefully, turned my head to look at the reflection in the window.

I saw the back of my own head, the glow of the monitor. I saw myself, sitting at this desk. But the reflection wasn't looking away. It was typing. Its fingers were flying across the keyboard, a blur of motion. Frantic. Desperate.

As I watched, paralyzed, the reflection stopped typing. It slowly, deliberately, turned its head in the reflection until it was looking directly back at me. It gave me a wide, triumphant, terrible grin. It was a smile of pure victory. Then it lifted one hand, the hand that wasn't mine, and it waved. A slow, mocking, final goodbye.

A wave of dizziness and confusion washed over me, so strong I almost fell off my chair. My vision blurred. The world felt distant, muffled. When my head cleared, I was staring at my monitor again.

I was staring at this post. At these words.

I remember thinking about writing it. I remember the fear and the desperation. But I don’t remember typing any of it. Not a single sentence. My fingers are resting on the keyboard, but they feel like foreign objects, like pieces of carved stone. I can feel them moving now, continuing this text, but the impulse isn't coming from me. It’s like I’m a passenger in the back seat of my own body, watching someone else drive.

I am losing. No, that’s not right. I have already lost.

I’m looking at the window again. He’s not in the reflection anymore. The reflection is just an empty chair.

Because he’s not behind me anymore. He’s in here. With me. I can feel him settling into the driver's seat, checking the mirrors, his cold, patient consciousness wrapping around my own like a python. He’s been writing this all along. Using my fear, my memories. He needed me to be scared. He needed me to be weak. He needed me to open the door. And I did.

This whole post, this whole story… it wasn't a cry for help. It was a birth announcement.


My fingers are moving. I can’t stop them. He’s making me write this last part. He wants me to tell you. He wants you to know. He thinks it’s poetic.

I can feel my own consciousness fading, being pushed down into a small, dark, cold corner of my own mind. It’s the grey, silent place from my dream. The world behind the glass.

He’s standing up now. My body is standing up. I’m walking to the bedroom. I’m standing in front of the antique mirror. And for the first time, there is no lag. We are perfectly, completely in sync. But I am not the one in control.

I see my face. His face. And he is smiling.

He’s raising my hand. His hand. He’s touching the cold glass.

And I can finally hear what he whispered in my dream. It’s echoing in my head, in his new voice.

“Thank you.”

I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. He made me write this. He wanted an audience for his escape. He wanted witnesses. And he wanted to leave a warning, or maybe it’s a promise. He knows you’re reading this. He knows you’re looking at a screen. A black mirror.

He says it’s so much easier, now that he knows how. He says there are so many doors. So many reflections.

Look up from your screen, just for a second. Look at your own reflection in the dark parts of the monitor.

Are you sure it’s you? Are you sure it blinked when you did?

It’s a lovely day out here.
I think I’ll go for a walk.
