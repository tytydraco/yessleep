Let me start this off by introducing myself. My name’s Rodrick, but most people just call me Rod. I coasted through some little rinky dink college on a football scholarship, drinking and smoking my way to some bullshit degree that would never really get me anywhere. Ended up working in construction. Not even a good position either, the fucking grunt work. You know like pouring concrete and climbing up scaffolding and shit like that. I don’t mind it that bad though, been doing it for about five years now. It’s honest work at the very least, and someone’s gotta do it. Anyway, I decided to make this post because I’ve noticed some peculiar things working in construction for as long as I have. It mostly has to do with the people you see when you're out working a job late into the early hours of the morning. Like around three or four A.M. when I’d be getting ready to drive home from work. Fucking druggies mostly, but every once in a while something would strike me off about one of ‘em. Like their mannerisms seemed slightly off, even for someone on drugs, and trust me when you work this kind of a job you see people on all sorts of drugs. This was different. They would stumble along past the site, something unnatural in the cadence of their steps. And they would always mutter to themselves. Never really paid any attention to what any of ‘em are saying though. 

One of my buddies told me he caught something this woman was saying once that stuck with him. Said she had wandered onto his site and was just standing, still as a statue, right in front of a steel beam of the building they were pouring concrete for. So, he went up to her because obviously it’s a big safety concern having some random druggie wander into an active pour. 

“Hey lady you can’t be here.” He called out to her. Said she didn’t look up, didn’t even flinch. He shone the flashlight on her, right on her face even, and she didn’t react at all. 

“Lady, do you need help? Is there somewhere you can go? I can drive you to a motel or something.” He continued. As he got closer to her he said he noticed that her lips were moving, but he couldn’t make out what she was saying. When he got close enough to hear her he said he got really cold, like a shiver just ran down his spine. Said she kept repeating the same thing over and over again. 

“I’ve lost my way back. I’ve lost my way back. I’ve lost my way back.” 

“Lady wherever you need to go I can take you, but you gotta tell me where that is.” My buddy tried to respond. Nothing. She just kept repeating that phrase. Then he puts his hand on her shoulder and she just stops. She looks at him for a second before walking back the way she came from, resuming mumbling that same phrase. My buddy said the whole thing had him on edge the whole way home. Mentioned how she was walking funny too. 

I’ve run into my fair share of the tweakers myself. Most of them are just your common druggie, but I always wonder what they’re out doing so late and how they end up walking past our sites. I  keep a gun in my truck and I usually prefer to carry at all times, especially late at night. Can’t be too careful working around the places I do. Never ran into any trouble with anyone but it helps keep my mind at ease. Lately it feels like I’m seeing more and more of 'em out late at night. I see at least two or three of ‘em most days driving home. Walking on bridges and along highways. See their camps set up all over the place too, tents made from tarps and grocery carts. Man, I couldn't imagine living like that. I’m not too much for organized religion but I believe in God and I try to remember to pray for them. 

Anyway, I was at a bar one night with some buddies and my girl, Allison. We got on the subject of the homeless population, the drug use, and all that shit somehow. My buddy Jimmy was one who brought it up actually. 

“Hey man, have you ever seen the druggies on your way back from work?” He asked me, peering over his beer. 

“Oh all the time man,” I replied, used to talking about the subject. 

“You ever talk to any of ‘em?” 

“Nah man I try to just let them do their thing and hope they end up alright. I know a guy who’s been on my crew a few times though. He told me about this time one wandered onto his site and was mumbling some weird stuff.” Jimmy took a long draw from his beer before looking at me and responding. 

“Yeah seems about right, man.” I told him the rest of the story, then he told me his own. Apparently he got interested in trying to find out where some young man was heading to at like two in the morning. Said he was bored and it was almost time that he could head home. He also said the guy couldn’t have be any older than his mid twenties. So he walks up to the guy and tries to strike up a conversation to burn away the rest of his shift. 

“Hey man, your girl kick you out of the place?” He asked the guy. 

“Nah man, nothing like that. Just can’t sleep.” The man responded. 

“So you decided a construction site would be a good place to fuck around at three in the morning?” 

“Nah I just kinda ended up here man.” 

“Well where’d you come from? Like where do you live?”

“Oh… probably like a mile north of here, on 42nd.” 

“You wandered all the way down from 42nd?” 

“Yeah man.” 

“Damn you ain’t got like a tv or anything? How the hell is wandering around the city at night better than being at your own place?” 

I took a long draw of my beer, starting to become more and more drawn in by what Jimmy was telling me. I don’t run into too many of ‘em that are as conversational as the guy he was telling me about. Most of the time they were just stumbling along, mumbling nonsense to themselves. I guess this guy had a place though, so maybe he wasn’t in the same boat as the homeless population; plagued by the use of drugs and hunger, spending every bit of money on the next fix, fighting to get by yet for some reason still spending almost all they have to feed that jones. 

“Was he on anything?” I asked Jimmy. 

“Just LSD, none of the crazy shit that the stumblers are on. God knows what kind of a chemical cocktail those poor bastards are pumping into their bodies nowadays.” He continued. “No, this guy was pretty with it. I mean he was like staring at shit and would sometimes get sidetracked in the conversations but those are all typical when you're on acid. Anyway, that's why he was out walking so late, he said it was more interesting than sitting on his couch watching whatever bullshit was on the t.v. at that ungodly hour.” Jimmy got back to his story. 

“So you’re just out walking around the city then, huh?” He asked the man. 

“Pretty much man, walking around and talking to whoever I happen to pass.” 

“You just talk to anybody?” Jimmy laughed. 

“Yeah why not man, most people out and about this late are either way too hopped up to respond, or usually have a hell of a story to tell.” 

“You do this a lot then?” 

“Eh every once in a while, but yeah I’ve done it plenty of times.” 
“So you ever run into any of ‘em that seem kinda off to you?” Jimmy asked the man. He took a second to think the question over, glancing down at his feet for a few seconds before looking back up. 

“Yeah man, I think I know what you mean. The ones that seem like they got something wrong with the way they’re walking.”

“Yes, exactly, we call those ones the stumblers.” 

“The stumblers, I kinda like that man. Yeah I run into them every once in a while, only really talked to a few of them though. Not that I don’t try, most of them just mutter to themselves and act like you don’t so much as even exist.” 

“You’ve talked to a few of them?” Jimmy asked, now much more invested in the conversation. 

“Yeah man, one of them was trying to figure out directions back to where he was squatting, all he could tell me was he lived under a big bridge. Felt pretty bad for the guy. The other one really stuck with me though.” 

“What do you mean?” Jimmy asked him. 

“Like it creeped me out man. I was out tripping like tonight, and I found these big pipes going through a hill. They were big enough to walk through and I could see the other end so I headed into one. It was pretty dark, I couldn’t really see the ground and there were a bunch of sticks and leaves in the pipe. I was about halfway to the other end when I started to hear someone talking quietly. I couldn’t really make out what he was saying but I could tell he was on the other end of the pipe. So I crept a little bit closer, right, and I start to be able to hear what he’s saying. The guy was going on about how he had lost his way back or something to that tune. So at this point I’m shitting bricks and I just decide to turn back with my tail between my legs and scurry on home. I Started backing up and tripped over a branch. Big ole clang! And I banged my head against the pipe and cursed. My vision was swimming and my ears were ringing. I sat on the ground for at least a couple minutes. When I came to, I noticed that this guy had just started repeating, Who's there?” The man paused for a second and looked at the ground again. 

“What’d you do?” Jimmy asked him. 

“Well after I nearly shit myself I managed to call out to the guy. It’s cool, I go, I don’t want any trouble. ‘Come here’ he told me. So I did, I don’t know why, to be honest, maybe it was the drugs, maybe I just didn’t know what else to do. Anyway I get to the other side of the tunnel and a man, about ten years older than me, is standing on the grass below. There was about a ten foot drop from the pipe on this side, which I was very grateful for. The man looked pretty average but there was something off about him, like his mannerisms. I called out to him, what are you doing here man? The guy tells me he’s lost. Keeps saying he went to the place and he couldn’t find his way back. But he’d do this weird thing where he’d repeat the first part three times. I went to the place, I went to the place, I went to the place now I can’t find my way back. He just kept going about that over and over.” 

“What the fuck man?” Jimmy exclaimed. “Sounds like a tweaker.”

“You’re telling me.” The man continued, “So he’s going on like this for like a minute or two before I get the nerve to ask him another question. Where’s the place? The guy stops rambling on then looks up at me all slow like. He stares me dead in the eyes. Man, this guy’s stare felt like it shot right through me like icicles. He looks off, back towards the city and points, arm straight as an arrow. Then after a couple seconds he goes back to mumbling that same phrase to himself. I’d had enough of the whole thing so I booked it back through the pipe. After that I ran to my car and drove home.” 

We all sat in a silence so thick it felt like the noises of the bar around us were somehow muffled. Allie snapped us back into conversation. 

“That’s horrifying, what kinds of people are you guys running into out there?” She had a concerned look in her eyes, a look that told me I should play this one carefully. 

“I try to avoid them as much as possible. It’s just part of the job Allie.” She still looked kind of concerned, but she knew I carried and I think that helped to put her mind at ease a little. 

“So what happened with the guy?” I asked Jimmy. 

“Ah, we talked for a while longer, told me a couple more stories. None of them were nearly as interesting as the first one though. Then I got the guy's number cuz he said he’d sell me acid and he went on his way.”
 
“The people you meet, huh?” I replied. 

“Haha yeah for real man, just glad I never met the homeless guy from his story.” 

“You two need safer jobs.” Allison stated. 

“Allie, I have all the protection I need, plus most of the time these people don’t bother you. And if they do they’re too hopped up on whatever to do anything about it.” I protested 
“I’m just worried about you.” 

“Trust me there’s nothing to be worried about.” 

Allison and I continued to talk about the matter while she drove us back to our apartment. Although, I couldn’t really focus on the conversation. The story Jimmy had told us had implanted itself in my mind. The more people I had talked to about the homelessness in our city, the more people had pointed out the ones that seemed a bit off to them. I decided to ask around with some coworkers and see if anyone else I know has any good stories. I also decided that I was going to try to talk to one of them. One of the stumblers that is. You certainly don’t see them every day, and sometimes you go a few weeks without running past any of ‘em so it might take a while, but I wanted to write out how it goes so I decided to get down all the stuff leading up to my decision. I’m sure Allison wouldn’t be too happy about my choice, so I decided not to tell her. Anyway I’ll update this post once I get the chance to try to talk to one of the stumblers. For now, take care of yourselves and be safe out there, especially if you’re working construction at two in the morning.
