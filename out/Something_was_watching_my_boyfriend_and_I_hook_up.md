I was dating my high school ex at the time and staying with him and his family in Oregon. We were up on some lookout area right around sunset and grabbed some takeout and were eating in his jeep. It was getting dark, and there were these lights that were motion sensor when it was dark, so people coming from the trail to the parking lot could see. The sensors were at the edge of the trail, and one by one the last of the hikers left the trail coming to their cars. It had to be something big like a person to be able to set off the sensor too, wouldn't go off for just anything. 

We were the last ones there, there were no other cars insight. Being horny teenagers we wanted to hook up. But I had this really weird feeling, like we were being watched. There was literally no one else there though. I didn't want to get out of the car even to shuffle the stuff in the backseat to put it in the front, this feeling was so strong and eerie. I made him stay in the car to move stuff around. We crawl into the back of his car and start fooling around. It wasn't long before things started to get strange. The lights in the parking lot turned on, illuminating the entire car. We sit up and compose ourselves looking for the hiker that set the lights off. We peer outside and we don't see anyone. We brush it off and pick up where we left off. Not long though the light kicks back on. Same thing we look around but can't see a soul.

 I remember it feeling like a temp drop too inside the car. The lights just kept turning on then back off. I was starting to really freak out (and it wasn't a general we are gonna get robbed sort of feeling - my ex had like 6 different black belts in a couple different martial arts). It got to the point it felt like whatever was watching us just felt closer. I could not explain it, and I just started to panic. My boyfriend offered to get out of the car to have a better look. I was like no way, that sounds like the worst idea. He wasn't near as freaked as I was, he was probably annoyed he was getting cockblocked by something. We attempt one last time to pick up where we left off (I mentioned we were staying with his family so this was kind of our only opportunity) That's when I hear it, clear as day. A muffled voice outside of the car, whispering my name. 

I actually recorded me telling this account and I suggest listening to it if you want to hear more. My writing skills are pretty terrible and I feel I'm not doing the story justice in this setting. I have posted a link where you can hear the rest of my story on my reddit profile.
