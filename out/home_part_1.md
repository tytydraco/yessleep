My home doesn’t look scary; it has none of those archaic designs typical of haunted houses. It has no evil backstory that I know of, nor does the neighborhood. However, now that I think about it, when we first moved here, somehow there was a dog’s corpse in the attic. We had no background as to why it was there, and the fact that the attic was only accessible through an outside trapdoor, where we had to put up a ladder to climb, made all of that a bit weirder. How did a dog even get up there? But besides all that, no one ever noticed anything out of the ordinary.

The strange occurrences that I want to share don’t seem to happen to anyone else besides me, and until a few months ago, I was almost sure it was just my imagination. I’ve always liked horror and consumed a lot of content from this genre, so what if some of it had also consumed me? Even as things stand now, I believe there's a chance none of what I've seen was anything more than cheap hallucinations and that all those years of diving into supernatural tales had gotten into me. The very reason I’m sharing this is the hope that other people can relate, and maybe all of this is a recurrent phenomenon like those sleep paralysis episodes or human-shaped clothes in the dark. Our brains all work in a similar fashion, right?

So, what’s the deal? Well, ever since we moved to this house, I’ve had some issues being alone. I’ve always liked being somewhat by myself, and if you were to ever pay me a visit, 9 times out of 10, you’d find me in my room, probably watching YouTube or playing some stupid game on my phone—rarely doing exercises or dancing to let out all the energy accumulated by not doing anything. However, when it comes to being completely alone in the house.. I feel lightheaded. It always happens when I step into the kitchen or living room, and usually during daylight, which I find strange. If horror movies have taught me anything, it’s that ghosts and evil creatures appear in the dark.

It’s not a feeling that starts immediately; it creeps in after a few minutes. My vision becomes ever so slightly blurred, and I can’t seem to move my limbs properly. When I try to pick something up, I miss the spot, as if my hand is suddenly shifted to the side, and I need one or two more tries to get it. I notice this especially when I try to have a snack on the balcony—my hands move towards the cup, but it’s like they phase right through it, again and again. When I try to put my sandwich on the plate, I somehow misplace it—half the bread lands on the plate, the other half falling past the edge. In summary, it’s like I’m drunk (I’ve never been drunk, but I imagine it’s something like that). Not only that, everything tastes and smells a bit off—like the tea and bread I’ve had thousands of times before, now less sweet and a little more bitter.

Another thing that happens is my breathing slows down, as if I’m subconsciously holding my breath. At first, I thought the house was getting hotter and was making me sweat, but then I realized I was actually breathing too lightly, it barely made any noise in the silent empty house, and it left me constantly out of air and sweating. I had to consciously focus on my respiration to get it right.

I think it’s supernatural... I mean, I don’t want to believe it’s just something that happens when I’m alone, because if it is, how will I live when I move out of my parents’ house? But of course, the thought of it being supernatural doesn’t look that bright either.

For now, the strangest occurrence that really compelled me to write this down and share it with more people happened one of the times I slept in the living room. It was some months ago, I can't pinpoint exactly when, but my grandparents were visiting us, and I happily slept on the couch so my grandma could have my bed. I always enjoyed sleeping on the couch, but usually couldn't do it alone because it made me feel a bit uneasy. However, since my mom was also sleeping on a mattress on the living room’s floor, I felt just fine being there too.

I remember falling asleep just fine and having a normal dream that, as I woke up, immediately faded into forgetfulness. But trust me, if it had been a bad dream, I would’ve for sure remembered it.

When I woke up, it was still dark. To this day, I don’t even know what made me get up, and at this point, I attribute it to instinct. I’m thankful for it, though—had it not been for that, I can’t even be sure I would be here right now.

As dark as it was that night, the faint blue-hued light coming through the window allowed me to make out the shape of my left leg. It was slightly distant from my other leg in a way that can only be described as levitating. It wasn’t being pulled as if a monster were trying to yank me from the couch, but it was weightless and slowly rising, as if the air around it had been replaced by salty water. I remember vividly how I didn’t feel scared at first. Instead, there was this odd sense of detachment, as though I were watching someone else’s strange dream unfold. I stayed very still as I tried to process it, not wanting to disturb anything that was happening.

But in what was probably only a few seconds, though it felt like minutes, I began to sense that my curiosity was leading me somewhere dangerous. What I had thought was a random, indifferent phenomenon wasn’t just that… It had a malicious motive. Whatever it was, it was taking possession of me, slowly pulling me up while enveloping my limbs. In the cover of the dark, sickly, taking advantage of my unconsciousness… The unknown was dragging me closer to itself.

I instantly snapped, pulling my legs close and hiding under the blanket. And… As if the jig was up, I was no longer bothered that night.
