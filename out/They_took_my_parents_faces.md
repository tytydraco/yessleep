I had a horrible dream last night, at least I thought it was however as of writing this I believe that it was a warning. I dreamt that my parents woke me up saying that theres an emergency and I meed to wake up. My vision was blurry, however as my eyes slowly adjusted to the bright light in what I think was my room, I noticed their mouthes seemed to be slightly delayed behind what they were saying. I could hear this god awful scream and the closer they got to me, the louder it became. 

I woke up in a pool of sweat and a deafening silence. For a brief moment I was confused on if I was still dreaming. Then I heard it. They were slamming on my door, I shot up, adrenaline pumping through my veins, the silence was replaced with a deafening and blood curling scream, one of pure agony. At first it sounded incoherent, but I could slowly make out words like open and help. As embarassing as this is, I ended up peeing myself, the pure shock of what was happening finally started to register in my brain. The slamming grew louder, the screams becoming more and more aggressive, demanding that I open my door. 

I moved to the corner of my room, the walls giving me a small sense of safety. I dont know how long I waited, but whoever hell whatever was out there waa relentless. I was so dissociated, but then they said something, something that snapped me out of my frozen state and made the last bit of colour in my face drain. It made me realise that they weren't trying to get in, they were toying with me. I didn't know what else to do so I simply yelled, I yelled as loud as I could I begged them to leave me alone. That was a mistake.

They could sense that my sanity was draining. The door slowly opened, inch by inch. I realised that if I didnt do something now I'll be dead, or worse, I dont know what they're capable of. I ran to my window but was met with nothing but a concrete wall. I slammed as hard as I could, praying that It would give in and let me free. I was frantic, then I heard it. These things, they said my fucking name, it was my moms voice, I looked back, god I wish I didnt, I wish I had just closed my eyes and accepted my fate, but I didn't.

As I slowly turned my head to face whatever sadistic creature this was, I puked. I saw my mom, my eyes adjustes to the blinding light, and then I saw the full extent of what "she" really is. It was her face, but her eyes and mouth hollowed out. There was something behind the holes where her eyes and mouth would have been. Something else replaced them, it was wearing my moms face like a fucking mask.
