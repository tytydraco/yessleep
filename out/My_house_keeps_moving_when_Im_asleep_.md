Last week I noticed something strange, when I woke up from an abnormally long sleep my house wasn’t where it was supposed to be. I live in the suburbs of salt lake city Utah in a house that’s pretty old but for some reason when I woke up that day my house was in a field.

A wheat field that seemed to stretch endlessly to the horizon. I couldn’t tell if I was dreaming or not so I just got in bed and closed my eyes. The next thing I knew my house was back where it was supposed to be.

Though that wasn’t the last time this happened. About two days later things started to feel off. Everything felt like a dream, as if nothing was real and it was all in my head. But no matter what I did I couldn’t get rid of the feeling.

Yesterday I noticed that all the plants outside were gone. I looked at doorbell camera footage suspecting they were stolen but from what I saw the plants were never there to begin with. I texted my wife who planted said plants but she claimed she has never brought a plant in or around the house since we moved in.

I called my dad asking him about the plants but he said the same thing. I think im starting to go crazy or something because I could have sworn there was two pots in front of the house with some orange and red flowers and a tree out front. In fact now it seemed that my house was the only one without a tree on the property.

Anyways I have decided to write things down and post them online or where ever I put this for now this Is just a note to myself written on a word document.

I got out of bed this morning and had a donut and coffee for breakfast. My wife leaves for her work earlier than me. It makes the mornings peaceful and quiet. But sometimes, especially times like this it makes me feel quite lonely. When I walked out the front door I looked across the street to see my neighbors didn’t have and trees or bushes. As I turned my head and looked down the street I realized no one had any bushes or trees. Everyone gardens were empty patches of dirt bricks laid in circles around nothing.

A feeling of uneasiness filled me but I decided to worry because it was probably just a dream. I debated whether or not I should still go to work or take the day off. As I stood on my front porch it hit me, if I was dreaming I could wake myself up or at least become lucid. I did everything I could but nothing seemed to work. I walked inside and went to lay down for a bit when I hit my hip on the counter “*FUCK”* I shouted out loud.

The sharp agonizing pain or bumping into a marble corner was indescribable it hurt a million times worse than it should have. I looked at my hip and noticed I was bleeding. It wasn’t bad just a small cut but it still hurt enough for me to call it quits for the day.

When I pulled out my phone to call in sick I couldn’t find my bosses contact. And I couldn’t remember his number, and for some strange reason I couldn’t remember his name or hers i completely forgot what they looked like what they sounded like. And then I couldn’t remember where I worked.

I sat down trying to think but I started to question if I even had a job. Nothing felt real and I had no idea what was happening.

I think I just need to get some sleep.

I woke up to loud bang.

I jumped out of bed dazed and confused I was sweating and I couldn’t remember what I was doing asleep so late until I saw my laptop open beside me. I heard footsteps that crept closer to the door. “WHO ARE YOU” I shouted the bedroom door swung open and I saw my wife. “Your home? This early?” I asked “its seven, I’m late.” “oh shit its seven but that doesn’t make any sense. I feel like just two minutes ago I was going to go to work but then some weird stuff happened, and speaking of that I need to tell yo…” “work? You got a job?”

“what do you mean you got a job?”

“you said you were going to work why didn’t you tell me that you got a job?”

“What are you saying I’ve had this job for ten years I- I don’t know what else to say.”

“Are you okay?”

“well no there’s a bunch of weird stuff happening and I’m losing my mind about it”

“like the plants you wont shut up about”

“well yeah but the neighbors don’t have any plants didn’t you see?”

“honey you need to get some rest, I don’t know what has gotten into you.”

“what?”

My wife never called me honey before

“its just you need to sleep”

“I’ve been sleeping. ”

“well okay then. I need to run to the store and buy some dogfood.”

“What? For who?”

“for us silly.”

Her voice sounded strange. Monotone and lacking any emotion at all

“while I’m gone you should really go sleep”

“No, What do you mean for us?”

“for our dog its hungry”

“We don’t have a dog”

She looked at me with a blank stare and said

“I don’t know what your talking about he’s right outside.”

I turned around and looked out the back door and saw a small sheep dog running around on a yard full of dirt I couldn’t remember if there was grass in the backyard and then I started to remember having a dog.

I looked back at my wife and I couldn’t seem to fully recognize her. Her face felt off. I could recognize her voice even the strange way she was talking to me but her face I just couldn’t remember even when looking directly at her. I made myself dinner and went to my bed but my wife never came to join. I shouted her name a few times until I forgot what her name was. It was like I had been shouting gibberish I got out of bed and felt lost.

I walked around the dark house that now felt like I different world and couldn’t find my wife but then it hit me a realization, a fear. I was alone. And I never had a wife. I keep reading this over and over and over again but I cant remember anything I didn’t type in the last five minuets.

I’m losing my mind.

I have decided to just go to sleep and figure things out in the morning.

I woke up around 3 ish in the morning I was cold so I got up to turn on the heater but when I looked outside I saw a forest I ran to every window in the house to be met with the same sight. A pitch black forest, one of those it eats you alive forests. I couldn’t believe what my eyes were seeing I decided to go back to sleep and pray that this was just some weird dream but as I was getting in bed I saw a not on my nightstand it read “*don’t talk to them, don’t listen to them, don't look at them and never leave the house.”*
