Javon had football practice in the early afternoon. He stood in line with the other wide receivers, waiting his turn to practice his forty yard route. They weren’t practicing with coverage, just the receivers and the quarterback throwing them the pass. He was up next. At the coaches whistle he ran out, gave a fake jab left at the ten yard mark, and then sprinted down the field at full speed. The ball passed over his right shoulder, exactly as it was meant to, he lifted his hands at the last moment. The ball was right there, in the palms of his hands, yet he managed to drop it.

The offensive coach was waiting for him at the scrimmage, arms crossed over his protruding belly.

“Tell me Javon,” the coach said, “What’d you think of that throw.”

“It was as good a throw…as good as they get, coach.”

“Nobody bothering you on the field. Just you and a perfect pass.”

“I’m sorry coach, I won’t let that happen ag–”

“You’ve dropped three already today. What’s the matter?”

“I’ve been having some rough nights,” said Javon.

“Girls, is it? We got to keep them away from you?”

“No, it’s not the girls, I can handle them, it’s something else…” Javon said, hesitantly.

The coach leaned in closer, right up against Javon, “You’re wasting my time, Javon. I won’t risk losing games because you’re too shy to share your problems with me.”

“Nightmares, I’ve been having nightmares.”

“Nightmares,” the coach asked, “Like monsters and stuff.”

“Yeah, monsters and stuff.”

“Find a way to deal with them, or you’ll have a much bigger nightmare to deal with. Get off the field and get your shit figured out.” The coach spit to the side in disgust and returned with the others.

Javon left the field cursing. This wasn’t just a game to Javon. He was in his second year and was leading in total receiving yardage. He was already on the NFL’s radar and that meant a damn good chance at earning big money. He wanted it bad, to pull his parents out of poverty, and you know, to live the luxurious life. He had already put in the work and suffered the hits to get this far. He wasn’t planning on letting a few bad nights of sleep sabotage it.

Likewise, the nightmares were taking a toll on Mylah’s ability to succeed in school. The nightmare I shared with you moments ago wasn’t their first. They’d increasingly been having them. But the difference was that the memories of those other nightmares had faded away, like they normally do, disappearing moments after waking up. They knew about them, from waking up eyes-wide open, drenched in sweat, and heart pounding erratically. As the nightmares wrecked their sleep they were increasingly sluggish.

The most recent nightmare had been different. The details of it remain clear, till this day, everything up to near the ending, when their thoughts had been silenced, and they had merged into one.

Mylah, proactive as she was, sought therapy to resolve her problem. She sat, reclined on the white leather couch of the psychologist, a red head fifty-year-old lady.

“Tell me what you remember about these nightmares,” the psychologist asked.

“This is the first time I remember it so clearly. The creature haunting us remains mysterious. It is as if there is something out there, in the desert, trying to absorb me.”

“Absorb you, how?”

“It feels like it holds me frozen while draining my thoughts… Taking them away from me.”

“Your knowledge?”

“Yes, but not only…”

“Interesting,” the psychologist said. “What happens after?”

“A car appears. I climb inside, asking the driver to get me away from the thing.”

“Do you recognize the driver of the car?”

“No. He’s a young man…my age. I’ve never met him, and yet he doesn’t feel like a stranger to me.”

“Are you attracted to him,” asked the psychologist.

“I don’t think that has anything to do with it. I’m terrified, I just want him to drive me away.”

“Normally our dreams have people familiar to us, unless of course they represent an ideal, or a fantasy.”

I hate to interrupt this privileged doctor-patient moment, but I can’t resist the urge of revealing that Mylah is lying. Her memory of the nightmare is vividly clear. The doctor's question made her think back about Luke (she doesn’t yet know his name). She thinks of the way he looked at her while she explained she saw. She remembers his gentle smile and his intelligent eyes. She likes how he is calmn, receptive and how the hair of his mullet curls just slightly behind his ears. She doesn’t see much guys like him in Boston. Mylah, of all people, should have known that lying to a therapist was counterproductive.

“I don’t care about the guy,” said Mylah. “I’m worried about these nightmares, like really worried, I feel them draining me. I just can’t seem to shake away the fear. I can’t continue like this…”

“Stress is the main culprit most of the time,” said the psychologist. “You’ve got lots on your plate, perhaps too much for you to handle. Ever consider putting your Jazz gigs on hold while you finish school.”

“No, I can’t drop Jazz,” said Mylah, thinking it was a bad idea to come see a therapist. (Personally, paying a therapist to tell me my problems are caused by stressed is what I would call a ripoff.)

“Then why don’t you drop med school?”

“Oh, never, my dad would be devastated.”

“Hum, hum,” the therapist made these acknowledgement noises. Mylah understand the therapist’s non-vocal reaction as a statement that she had just pinpointed the problem.

“You’re saying my dad is the problem?”

“You said it, not me.” Mylah could hear the therapist’s smirk in her voice. “You fear losing everything you learned and disappointing your father. Using a short hypnosis, I will give the ability to control your nightmare. Next time you see this monster, stand your ground and repeat, dad let’s talk.”

“Dad let’s talk?” Mylah said, unconvinced.

“Those words will be the cue to take control of the dream. When you wake up, even if it is the middle of the night, I want you to call your father, tell him about the pressure you are feeling from his expectations.”

“I’m not sure if he’s to blame for this, he’s very supportive, actually.”

“Give it a try.”

Mylah agreed reluctantly.

“Now, I will set this cue up deep in your subconscious,” said the therapist. “Close your eyes and listen to me count down while you fall into the peaceful depth of your consciousness. Exhale ten…nine…relax…eight…”

\*\*\*

This is where I show up in the story. My name is Cody and I’m Javon’s roommate. I don’t play sports and this is obvious by the way I look, not that I look half that bad, just not athletic like college athletes do. For now, that’s enough about me. I’ll try to be a silent observer whenever possible, at least until my role becomes more substantial.

When I entered the apartment, I found Cody sitting at the kitchen table reading on his laptop.

“Didn’t you have practice?” I asked. Sharing an apartment with Javon was great; he wasn’t there most of the time. Either he was at practice, working out, on the road for a game, or sleeping. He didn’t use the kitchen often, as the football team had its own cafeteria. Basically, I had the place to myself most of the time.

“Coach sent me home,” he said, not happy with himself. “I couldn’t catch the damn ball.”

“Woah, that sucks,” I was surprised, because I knew how good he was. Normally he caught balls out of reach using what could only be something like Jedi powers. I couldn’t resist a snark remark at his failure, a privilege I granted myself as a compensation for my inferiority complex. “Are you good at anything else but catching balls?”

“I’ve been having crazy nightmares, they’re messing with me, man. They’re wrecking my game.”

“Crazy nightmares?” I asked, curious. “Like what, sexy alien octopussies?” He didn’t even laugh.

“Last night, a guy in my nightmare argued that I was in his nightmare.”

“Not scary, but it is weird.” I grabbed a beer from the fridge. I didn’t offer one to Javon. As I said, he was doing everything to be the best, he would have plenty of time and money to drink after he had made the cut as a pro player. “You know, maybe it’s an after effect of all those concussions of yours.”

“Do you ever say anything useful?” (For the record, I do say useful things on occasion, perhaps not as frequently with my roommate as with others.)

“So, what are you planning on doing?” I tried to be more useful.

“I’m looking for ways to take control of my dreams.” He was scrolling over his Google search results. I leaned over to see if that’s what he was really up to. He was in fact reading an article titled, Top Five Tricks to Control Your Nightmares Now.

“Find anything useful?”

“Yeah, once in a dream, all I got to do is anchor myself into doing something familiar and focus on that.”

“Let me guess, like catching a football.”

“You got it!”

“You better hope the other guy doesn’t try to control the nightmare too.”

“You’re such an idiot, Cody.”

I shrugged and finished my beer, honestly unsure of what I said wrong.

\*\*\*

The next nightmare started in full action. Luke was driving his 2023 Dodge Charger cruising down a desert straightaway, with Mylah sitting next to him. In the distance behind them, they could see the remnants of an explosion; scattered flames and a black cloud from the smoke filling the night sky with a darker mass.

“I think it’s following us,” said Javon. He was sitting in the back seat, sticking his head between the seats of Luke and Mylah.

“What’s following us?” said Mylah.

“The black mass,” said Javon.

“The smoke?” said Luke.

“That’s no smoke,” said Javon.

Mylah peered through the window, glancing up at the sky keeping her eye on the dark mass drifting over them. Luke accelerated, but the mass could not be outrun.

“Stop the car,” Mylah said.

“What?” Luke said, not believing it.

“I said, stop the car.”

“What happened to, go, go, go?” he said, imitating her from the previous dream.

“It’s time to deal with this shit.”

“She’s right, man,” said Javon. “Stop the car. This shit’s wrecking my life.”

Luke skidded the car around to a stop projecting Jevon to the side.

“Do you have to do it that way?” Javon said, picking himself up.

“It’s one of my small joys in life,” said Luke.

Outside, they watched the mass of darkness pass above them, shrinking in size but growing in thickness. A chill ran up their spins, each of them, all at once. Lightning flashed. A violent gust of wind blew between them, carrying a foul smelling scent that could only be carried over from the explosion.

Mylah shut her eyes tight and said, “Dad, let’s talk…Dad let’s talk.”

Javon and Luke watched her, thinking the girl had lost her mind. Javon tapped Lucas on the shoulder and said, “We are going to play catch.”

“Now is not the best time for games,” said Luke.

“Just throw me the football.”

Luke opened his arms, “I don’t have a football.”

“Go through the motion, the ball will appear.”

Lucas pretended to hold a football with a side stance, the same way he’d seen quarterbacks do it. Javon ran in the desert while glancing over his shoulder ready for a pass. The lighting flashes behind him.

“Dad, let’s talk,” continued Mylah.

“Throw the ball,” Javon shouted over to Luke.

“I still don’t have the ball.” Luke dropped his arms to his side.

“Come’on, you shouldn’t be arguing with me,” Javon said as he ran back.

The dark mass was now floating several hundred feet in front of them, a swirling cloud of dark gray around something that had become tangible and solid.

“Dad, let’s talk,” Mylah is now shouting her words, as vortex of debris spin among them.

“What is wrong with her?” asked Javon.

“What are you doing?” Luke asked her.

“It’s not working,” she said plaintively, while opening her eyes. “The monster’s my dad.”

“That’s your dad,” the two guys said simultaneously, pointing at the shape that had formed, a solid mass with two legs now solidly footed on the desert dirt.

“No, This isn’t my dad…I’m imagining a nightmare because of my dad,” said Mylah.

They both replied at the same time.

Javon said, “This is my nightmare.”

While Luke said, “This is my dream.”

“No, No, No,” said Luke, needing to raise his voice as the swirling wind was whistling in their ears. “If this was your nightmare, why would I be driving you two around in my car. Who lets somebody else drive in their own dream.”

“I don’t have a license,” said Mylah.

“Either do I,” said Javon.

“Really?”Luke had chills at this horrific idea. “How do you get around?”

“Metro,” said Mylah.

“Bike,” said Javon. (Though, in truth, he often asked me for rides to get around. I agree most of the time, figuring it might pay off to be nice if ever he did get one of those lucrative NFL contracts.)

“This is Mammoth, Arizona,” said Luke, “this is my home, where you need a car.”

“Or a camel,” said Javon.

“Then who’s this creature?” asked Mylah.

“What are you talking about?” said Luke.

“Why are you dreaming of this creature.”

The creature’s shape could best be described as a headless two legged creatures, lizardlike, the tail had funnel like tip. The gray gasses swirling around the creature slowed down and formed three long, waving limbs.

“Why are you having these nightmares?” asked Mylah.

“Haven’t got a clue,” said Luke, thinking of his reading of Lovecraft.

They didn’t look at each other as they spoke, but watched the creature’s three limbs detach from the lizardlike body, undulating in the air like floating snakes passing between them, and around their heads with a hiss.

“We can’t back down now,” Mylah said, biting her lips and holding her hands into tight fist. “We need to show we aren’t scared.

“I’m not scared at all,” said Javon in a terrified high-pitch squeal, as one of the snakes passed between his legs. He cleared his throat and managed to regain a bit of composure and said, “Let’s show these motherfuckers who’s boss.”

The snakes brushed along their bodies, leaving a trail of cold mucus where they passed. Here once again, the memories merged into one. By this I mean I can’t say which of the three were living the following experiences, so I will assume it was all three of them.

A snake coiled around their necks. They reached up to grab it, to pull the snake away. But the snake wasn’t tangible, their fingers passed through the bodies and were left covered in a sticky goo. There was a scream, like that of a young boy being tortured, unsure if they had screamed themselves or if it was one of the others. They wanted to look at the others, to see if they were suffering the same ordeal, but the snake had passed over their eyes, leaving mucus that distorted their sight beyond recognition.

They realized it was a terrible mistake to think they could control this nightmare. They were in real danger and knew it. The snakes multiplied into many to enter their nose and ears and push through their tightly held lips. But the creature wanted access to more than these hollow cavities.

They felt a crack and heard it too, like the walnut shell under the nutcrackers pressure. A fissure in the skull, providing access for the snake. They somehow knew what the creature wanted–to get inside them. Become them. They held their head tight, squeezing on each side like a vise to prevent the breach from widening. Gagging on mucus, they twisted and turned in pain, wanting to run but held motionless, convinced they were going to die, or at the very least cease to exist.
