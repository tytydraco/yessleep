I had been behind the wheel for almost twenty hours straight, transporting goods across Texas. My eyes were getting heavy, my head was ringing from exhaustion, and I knew it was simply dangerous to keep driving.

I stopped at the first motel I saw. A small, old building with a peeling sign that said "Desert Palms Inn." The lobby smelled like dampness and old carpet. The manager—a tall man with sleepy eyes—silently handed me a key to a second-floor room, number 214.

The room was just as expected: dim lighting, a creaky bed, dusty curtains. But I didn’t care—I collapsed on the bed and fell asleep almost instantly.

I woke up at one in the morning.

At first, I thought the creak of the mattress had woken me—maybe I had turned over awkwardly. But then I heard running.

Someone was dashing through the hallway. Fast, back and forth. The dull thuds of bare feet on the carpet.  
Sometimes—accompanied by an inhuman wheeze. As if someone was laughing, but in a way no human could laugh.

I went to the door and quietly looked through the peephole.

Two people were running in the hallway. A man and a woman. Naked, filthy, their hair a tangled mess. The woman was dragging a kitchen knife behind her, occasionally slapping the walls and screaming something incoherent. The man whispered to himself, running from door to door like he was searching for someone.  
They looked... like animals. Insane. Out of control.

I stepped back from the door. My heart was pounding so loudly I could hear it in my ears.

I wanted to leave, but… I froze in place.  
If they saw me—if they decided I was *the one* they were looking for?

I locked the door with every lock.

I thought about the room phone—it didn’t work. Only a dead tone clicking.  
I took out my cellphone—no signal. I was in a concrete trap.

I sat in the dark for almost an hour.  
Breathing quietly. Listening as they ran away, then came back. Sometimes stopping right outside my door.

Then I heard a scream.

From the room next door. A scream that sounded more like the death rattle of a dying animal.

I rushed to the door. Listened. Someone was tearing and biting. And a man’s voice:  
— Help! They’re biting me! They’re biting… my neck!

I looked at my phone and saw I had a weak signal.

I called 911. My hands were shaking. I could barely explain where I was.

The police arrived about fifteen minutes later. I watched through a gap in the curtain as they surrounded the motel. Approaching the stairs with flashlights.  
For the first time that night, I felt a shred of relief. But it lasted only a few seconds.

The maniacs—that couple—burst out of the hallway and attacked the officers like rabid dogs.  
One officer fell. Another managed to shoot.  
They were growling. Hitting with their hands. Clawing at faces. As if there was nothing human left in them.

Both were taken down on the spot.

Later it turned out they had taken hallucinogenic pills. They were drug addicts.

When it was over, one officer asked me:  
— Why didn’t you leave the room? Why didn’t you come out?

I answered honestly:  
— I felt that if I stepped out—I’d die.

Since then, I’ve never slept in cheap motels again.  
Even when I’m tired. Even when my eyes are closing.  
Because now I know: sometimes it’s not just noise behind the door. Sometimes, it’s someone who has already killed.

And silence—doesn’t always mean safety. Sometimes, it’s just waiting… for you to come out.
