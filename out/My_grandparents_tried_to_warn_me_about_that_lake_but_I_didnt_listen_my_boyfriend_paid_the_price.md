When I was little my grandparents used to always warn me about going near the water at our summer house and I should have believed them.



Me and my boyfriend were visiting my grandparents' summer house. We were so excited to get there as both of us were working hard before. That vacation was exactly what I needed. 



We drove there and everything was as usual. Nothing weird or unusual happened on the first day. 



We were cooking food on a campfire and telling stories to each other, when I mentioned about my grandparents always warning me about going too close to the water.



I told him how they were so overprotective about that and never allowed me to go alone to the lake. 



“They probably saw something weird there,” my boyfriend told me while smirking.



“No way, they were just scared that I was going to drown. ’’Old people don’t think kids can swim,’’ I argued.



We talked about different subjects after that and then went to bed.



The next day I woke up feeling good. I wanted to feel even better and decided that I would go for a swim. 



Walking to that lake I had a horrible flashback of my grandparents secretly whispering to each other about a nixie in that lake.  



I remembered overhearing a conversation about when my grandfather was young. They said that this creature called Nixie took his brother and that they shouldn’t tell me about it.



My grandpa and his brother were just swimming in the lake when all of a sudden his brother got taken underwater. That was the last time he saw his brother. 



Remembering that made me a little bit scared of the water but I thought they just made it up to make water seem like a threat. 



When we arrived at that lake, there were birds singing and crickets chirping.



“You want to go in first?” I asked my boyfriend. 



“No way, it's too cold. I think I don’t even want to swim,” he replied.



“C'mon you are a man and that cold water ain’t a threat to you,” I told him and teased him.



“Alrighty then,” he replied and started to take off his clothes.



We both got undressed and went to stand on that dock. The water was pretty clear for a lake. You almost saw the bottom.



I saw a dark fish-like figure swim under the dock. It was bigger than the average fish was at that lake. 



It was really massive, it swam under the dock and stayed there. When my boyfriend was just about to jump in.



“Don’t go in! I don’t trust this lake,” I yelled. 



My boyfriend stopped, turned and looked straight at me.



“What?” he asked. 



Then everything went quiet. All the birds stopped singing at the same time and so did the crickets.



It was really weird. 



“Don’t go in the water,” I continued to ask him.



He talked me back into swimming and just jumped in. Just before he went in, I saw movement in the water.



I saw something moving between the reeds. It was dark green, a little bit mossy. It resembled a human very much but it looked wrong in some way. It was just a quick glance and then it vanished. 



My boyfriend hit the water and swam for a bit.



“Come in with me!” he yelled.



Then he dived. 



He was underwater longer than I expected and I hesitated to go in. I thought he was rushing me to get in with this type of stunt. 



Then I had to jump, I went in and tried to swim frantically. I scanned the water for my boyfriend but couldn’t spot him. He was just gone.



I tried to look for him for a couple more minutes but didn’t see anything and then climbed back to the dock. As I got up I tried to yell his name. 



That was the last time I swam at that lake. It was also the last time I saw my boyfriend. 



After looking around and trying to scream his name. I called the emergency hotline and got help to find him but nothing was found. 



Saying this makes me angry and sad but I think my grandparents were right all along. That lake is dangerous, probably even cursed and nobody should ever go there.
