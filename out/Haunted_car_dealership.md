I have many stories through my line of work, this is a series that have taken place over the course of a few years at a car dealership.  

I supervise a couple of night guards for a night security shift at a high end car dealership Lexus, Porsche,BMW, Mercedes and on the  rare occasion Ferrari and Lamborghini.  This dealership has been owned by many people and now is in the hands of a group known for their racing teams.

About this dealership during the day it’s like any other dealerships, but at night the building no longer welcomes people.

The first night I met with the operations manager that day, we went over the ropes and what was expected.  Before he left he said to never enter with the lights off.  I asked him why and he said “I don’t want you tripping on something and damaging one of my beautiful cars” fair I thought, but he was lying.

Night time has come I am sitting at the front receptionist desk, getting tired of the brightness I turned off the lights. I was on my laptop playing some flash games then I hear a loud banging noise.  Immediately began to investigate.  Know keep in mind this dealership is two stories 1st is for sales second is for maintenance and repairs.  

On the 1st floor everything is how it was left, nothing out of touch.  From behind I hear someone talk and footsteps,  FOOTSTEPS! so close getting closer, I turned around shining my flashlight and the noises stopped.  I walk by the restroom and hear the toilet flush. I enter no one is there but the toilet would flush on its own, keep in mind there is a lever and no sensor.  Creepy!  I take the elevator then the bang happens again,took the stairs.

On the 2nd story I felt cold, someone was here I can feel eyes stab my skin. But no matter how hard I searched not a single person was there.  
I left the building and my laptop inside deciding I had enough.  Now in my truck I had the overwhelming urge to sleep. I figured it was safe to do so sense my task was done and I did.  About another hour later I wake up to see someone in the tree line. It was a man in good cloths.  The man starts to sprint towards my truck, dress shoes clacking on the pavement a knife in his hands.  I jump out of the truck draw my pistol he was gone.  I decide to go back to the building.

Now at the front entrance there is insane amount of tapping on the glass.  Too much to be a branch and it became cold again. I went back to the truck and moved it under the lights, no more creepy encounters.

The next night, I trained a new hire.  Almost
Forgetting about the encounters of the previous night I showed the new hire the ropes of the the property, what to do and look for.  This time with the lights on the tapping began.

Now with two sets of eyes we searched the property.  Related to the story the new hire is Jewish and is very active in his religion. He comes back to me and told me “I can’t do this, the building hates me”. I laugh and say it can’t it’s a building.  He told me what happened.

The new guard was on the second floor while I was on the first.  There was footsteps but this time he felt a cold hand on his shoulder, a whisper in his ear “we don’t like your kind in our business” then he turned around and met my ghostly friend as he was fading out of existence.

After that, we decided to blow it off and think nothing of it.  I left and went home.

The next night I call him, he told me that something kept staring at him in the wood lines and that the knocking never stopped.  He had the urge to sleep but every time our friend would wake him up.  We decided to stay in the brightest part of the parking lot after dark.  Our plan was to do all our task during the day and not enter the building at all.  The creepy encounters stopped.

A year later, my friend was out of work and needed a job, I told him we had a dealership open and I’ll get him trained on it tonight.  Keep in mind I have almost completely forgot about what happened.

I showed him the ropes not a sound, no tapping, no footsteps.  All was clear. For notes my friend is sleight obese.

I left and waited till the next day.   I call my buddy and asked him how his first shift went.  He said it was decent but I wasn’t funny. I asked what he meant.  Then he said you think it’s funny scaring
 people do you? I laugh and told him I was happy at home in bed what’s up?  Then he told me what happened.

The shift happened like normal, but then the encounters happened.  The same as before but this time the being walked up behind him and said “hello piggy, are you hungry? I saw some donuts in the break room, would the piggy want to eat?” He looked behind our mysterious friend was no where to be seen.  Throughout the night the footsteps would grow closer and it would say “piggy I know you can hear me! The piggy wants to eat doesn’t he?” My buddy went to his truck and found the brightest spot in the parking lot, no more.

The once new hire decided to place a few crosses hidden around the first floor so we can use the restroom in peace, it worked.  Now when we enter the property no more footsteps, tapping or weird voices.  We learned to never look at the building or even acknowledge the being after dark. If you look hard enough you can still see the being angrily stare from the second floor, trapped until someone moves our protections.
