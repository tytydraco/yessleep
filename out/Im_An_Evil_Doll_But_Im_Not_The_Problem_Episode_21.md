Anyone miss last week? I’ve got you covered:

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/xEMd0Dexgb



Impotent rage. 

It’s a term I’m sure you’ve heard a million times by now. One you might even think you understand. I know I thought I did. Lack of memory aside that is. 

But as I saw Alex fall. When I watched her young life snuffed out, I knew how wrong I was. 

We’ve taken cover in the Western themed food stand. Will hasn’t taken any further shots. Wherever he is, he’s content to cackle at us through the overhead speakers as the things around us start to close in. 

I’m afraid, but more than that, I’m angry. I’ve seen a lot of shit at this point, but Alex dying, it was too much. Survival instinct can only go so far, eventually the beast inside wants to make things even. Evil doll or otherwise. 


Leo pops up from the counter, injured body making the movement as jerky as the small army of living movie paraphernalia getting ready to kill us all. 

The shotgun is large, no doubt modified and enhanced by Leo himself, but the effect on the things out for our blood is minimal. 

“Fuck me, most of these bastards shouldn’t even be moving. They’re objects, for Christ’s sake. ” Leo says, taking cover again. 

“It’s Will, the guy is more than a creepy cowboy.” I reply. 

Kaz is with us, body nearly reknit, his new flesh is a strange pink color. Sveta though…

She managed to come back from the brink after the newsroom. Forcing her body to calm itself down.  

But missing a decent portion of her shoulder and chest, she has no choice. 

She thrashes and screams, more blood than could be possible pumping out of her gaping shoulder-wound. Those screams turn to growls, then barking, then a deep, rage filled howl. 

Once her body is done the gory transformation, she looks different than she did last time. 

She’s an emaciated, mange ridden thing. Exposed ribs and hips, patchy fur, and bloodshot, yellowed eyes. 

Dying god is another phrase that gets thrown around like rice at a wedding. The sense of sadness and awe a real dying god creates is as unique as it is horrifying. 

She can’t rampage through the creatures anymore, but she has the determination of a woman who has had her spouse murdered in front of her and the feral cunning of a starving wolf. 

She strikes at outliers, stragglers, the brave and the weak. But despite the raw power remaining in her deific form, the objects, given drive and motion by Will refuse to stay down. Won’t shatter or bend.

“Michael, loathe as I am to admit it, I think it may be time to make peace with Demetrious. He was nothing if not versed in the workings of esoteric objects.” Kaz says, not willing to make eye contact with Mike. 

 “Fucking around with the void is what killed him, or did you forget that part? Decided to daisy chain a bunch of cursed objects and it left him as a mental parasite. 

That option is off the table.” Mike says, wincing at broken ribs. 

“We both know you’ve got a card to play, Kaz. We’re surrounded by ingredients.” Leo says, pointing out the obvious. 

“Feel like cluing the rest of us in?” Mike says, a bottle shattering against the counter. 

“Candyman isn’t just a spooky name. 

When Kaz isn’t looking like a wax nightmare, he can make candy that does a lot of different things.” Leo says, as Kaz looks increasingly uncomfortable. 

“What you neglect to mention is that each piece of candy is made with a deal.” Kaz replies. 

“So, you give him the family and friends rate, what’s the issue?” I ask. 

“It’s not that simple. The toll is flesh or sorrow. And I’m bound to seek a beneficial deal for myself.” Kaz admits. 

“And I’m all out of flesh.” Leo adds. 

“Fuck.” Mike says, drawing the word out like a splinter, “Punch, real-talk time. 

You and I are the little brothers here, and besides Alex, we’re the ones Will has an issue with. 

Kaz, Leo, Sveta, Hyve, they need to make it out. They have a chance of stopping all of the crazy shit the bishop has planned. 

If Will kills us, maybe they can make some kind of deal.”

I’m shocked, Mike is a lot of things, but a quitter doesn’t seem like one of them. 

“So we just hand ourselves over? Are you serious?” I type. 

“Didn’t say that. 

What I’m suggesting is you and I cut a path from here to wherever the hell Will is. Hopefully on the way there we figure out a plan to put a dent in him. 

If not, what happens, happens. We’re useless here, anyway.” Mike calmly replies. 

I don’t know if he’s right or wrong, but it beats sitting here trying to figure out something useful to do. 

There’s no time to debate, with every passing second the newly animated statues, mannequins and animatronics are faster, more organized, more used to their newly granted mobility. 

“What is your vice?” Kaz asks Leo, the words sound formal, they have a spiritual weight.

Leo steels himself. 

“Give me a bit of luck.” He says, with a tentative tone I’ve never heard from him. 

Kaz starts to rummage through torn packages, decades out of date. Mixing various moldering snack foods together in a dented metal bowl. 

His eyes begin to glow a dim, flickering black. 

“A proper treat for a proper hero.” Kaz says, orange fumes starting to come from the bowl. 

Even in the guise of an ancient man, something gives Kaz a sinister air. Watching him do what he does, even knowing him for this long, is scary as hell. 

“What’s the price?” Leo asks, the forces Kaz is wielding struggle against the chaos of the liminal space.

“You have a heart attack. Younger than you’d expect. As things stand now, you survive, no long term effects  other than you easing up on the fast food. 

That will no longer be the case if you accept my offer.

Of course, this is one thread of the tapestry of time. But in any, where you are not cut down by the things you hunt, this thread will remain.” Kaz sounds almost like he’s reciting something being told to him.  

“My vice will be indulged.” Leo answers. 

Kaz begins to mix in packets of sugar and bits of debris. The fumes coming from the bowl begin to warp the metal. 

“I need you to keep those things back for a minute. Maybe slightly more, the energy here is making things difficult, and this isn’t something normally done in these kinds of conditions.” Kaz requests, small sparks starting to drift up from the concoction. 

“I can get you two, maybe. These things are shrugging off everything I can throw at them. ” Leo replies. 

Kaz keeps mixing, folding and adding ingredients. Against all odds his small spark of power fans itself into a flame. 

Leo places his various firearms under the counter and takes a deep breath before carefully rising. He unleashes a torrent of gunfire, impacts from oversized bullets stagger, and knock the approaching horde down, but much like Sveta, he can’t seem to cause any permanent wounds. 

Mike and I take this as our invitation to begin our own last stand. 

“My money is on  there being an AV room back by the exit that runs all of the screens and speakers. No one wants to lug 400 pounds of sound boards through a normal building, let alone this fucking nightmare. 

Take my lead.” Mike says. 

Something about his tone of voice, the way he begins to move, speaks more to his nature than the costume, or the weapons he left at home. Clad in nothing more than some faded jeans and a Toy Dolls T-shirt, the man moves like an escaped lunatic. 

Leo unloads a set of pistols into the incoming esoteric nightmares. Before the smoke has cleared the barrels he’s dropped them and begins firing an unwieldy looking, short rifle. 

Mike finds a service hallway, leading behind the attractions and stalls. Head twitching like a stimulant addict, skulking low enough to nearly be my height he navigates the pitch-black, cramped corridor expertly. 

“Now that we’re away from everyone else, we need to talk about something.” Mike says. 

“We’re marching to death and you want to have a heart to heart?” I type. 

“Something like that. 

Neither Demi or I know what happens to him when I die. It’s why this war between us has remained fairly cold so far. 

I don’t step in front of a train because the psychopath might gain control of the pieces. 

He doesn’t make me black out on a highway because maybe that’s the end of the line for him. 

But, chances are we’re going to find that out really soon. 

If that evil old shit gets what he wants, you need to understand something. 

You can’t trust him. He’s not Kaz, or you or Sveta. Power corrupts, and as far as regular people go, I don’t think anyone managed to amass as much power as he did.” Mike admits. 

At first, I think it’s a redundant statement. Don’t trust Jack the Ripper. But reading between the lines, I get what Mike is saying. 

Don’t become numb to the paranormal. Don’t let the fact it seems to be around every corner blind you to it’s danger. 

  “Fuck sakes, he’s blocked the hallway. “ Mike says, pointing out a pile of debris. 

“Right by a door to a stall.” I reply. 

“It’s a trap, but I’m half-dead, and you’re three feet tall. We’re not getting through that crowd back there.” Mike says, preparing to open the door. 

“If we get out of this, maybe don’t leave your tools at home anymore?” I suggest as Mike tries, and fails to kick the door in. 

“Sounds like a plan.” Mike says, finally managing to break the lock. 

Once the door swings inward a cloud of…something, escapes. Small fibres, enough of them to seem like a snow flurry. 

Mike and I walk in, and we see the entire room is covered in the same material. Thick enough in some places to pile into drifts nearly as tall as me. 

“Dog hair?” Mike says, confused, “What the hell?” 

The room itself, under the layers of fur is a mock up of an western themed home. We hear the noises of struggle and the paranormal outside, but can’t see a thing through the hair encrusted windows. 

“Mike, look to your left.” I request. 

What I’m seeing is the source of the room’s state. 

It’s old, fat and decrepit. One eye missing, it stands like a statue, staring at us in a pile of fur up to it’s shoulders. 

It begins to growl. 

“Kill it.” Mike says in a whisper. 

The dog looks to him, cocking it’s head. 

“I’m not killing a dog.” I reply. 

“It’s not a dog, it’s clearly one of the things being kept here.” Mike says, slowly inching his way to the exit, watching the ‘animal’. 

“It sheds more than is possible, I don’t think that’s grounds for a death sentence.” I type, looking around the room for something we might be able to use against Will. 

Mike laughs behind me, I didn’t think I was being that funny, but whatever keeps him on track, I guess. 

If there’s anything important here, I’m starting to think my chances of finding it are slim to nil. We don’t have time to shift through every dander drift. 

I hear a chair fall over. 

“Fuck.” Mike grumbles, laughing some more. 

Something catches my attention. It’s a small poster for some generic Lassie knock-off. But the frame it’s sitting in is off-kilter, almost as if it’s on a hinge. 

With a hair clogged screech the poster swings aside, behind it is a laminated sheet of thick-stock paper:

Instruction Booklet- Peons- Excerpt 1072-Hair of The Dog

First discovered on March, 29, 1952 in *******. Originally, Peon simply seemed to be an average canine with an extended lifespan. 

A stunt double for the short lived television series *The Smallest Traveler* it’s unique qualities soon became apparent. 

Lack of care during animal handling on set ( as was standard at the time) led to several accidents that should have lead to fatal outcomes for the Peon. After which the canine was surrendered to the Organization. 

On or about the 23rd of December 1984, Peon appeared to expire for a period of 7 days. After this, it’s more problematic qualities began to manifest. 

Exposure to secretions, dander, fur or other bodily waste causes human subjects to experience an extreme form of the condition colloquially known as “Brewers Gut” in which an individual’s digestive tract both produces and absorbs alcohol. 

Additionally, this peon ( Codename: Alpine.) produces waste of all forms at a rate of approximately ten times that of a normal canine. 

First aid can be administered with adequate hydration and removal of as much of the waste material as possible from contact with the subject. 

Addendum 2A:

Under no circumstances should Alpine be……


The end of the information sheet is torn off leaving me to wonder what further esoteric landmine is waiting for us on this battlefield. 

I hear Mike hit the ground, at first he retches, then coughs as he inhales what seems like a handful of dog hair. 

He vomits till he coughs then proceeds to cough till he vomits.

Mike’s eyes are glassy, he tries to stand, then falls again. 

“Help.” He says, before a dry heave puts him into the fetal position. 

I grab Mike and start to drag him, but the layers of fur make it hard to get any traction. It comes up in disgusting, matted chunks as I slowly move my inebriated companion. 

Inch by inch I drag the poisoned, retching man toward the exit. 

This place has made me weak, but I have to get Mike out. We have to keep going, keep putting one foot in front of the other. 

I get Mike out of the door, under the clouded eyed gaze of that dog. 

No time to think, I pull out one of my blades. I slice open Mike’s shirt and pants then roughly flip him out of them. He crawls away from the tainted garments as if they’re radioactive, wearing nothing more than a pair of clean but faded boxers and short black boots. 

Leo vaults the counter, eating something dark and misshapen. Thin, grey smoke starts to come from his mouth and nose in wisps for a brief second.

  My attention is torn from Mike as the objects start to encircle Kaz and Leo. 

A wax figure of a child trips, it’s body going inert as an undersized, plastic cork-gun drops from it’s hands. For a second it glows a dim grey color. 

Leo grabs it before it hits the ground, putting one of the four corks into the end of the barrel. 

He has trouble working the child-sized toy, but eventually manages to rack and fire it into the crowd. 

The cork files about 5 feet, wobbling, and lifeless. It hits a clanking, rusted Mechanical cowboy, then a screeching horse holding a brown jug in its mouth before finally resting on the ground and being trampled by the oncoming horde. 

Leo’s face goes slack, death now within arm’s reach. 

But then, in a flash of light I can only describe as ‘harmful.’ Everything the cork touched bursts into an almost sand-like consistency. 

Will’s tools fly from the force of the blast, struggling to rise as they experience a force as powerful as themselves. 

Leo smiles, “Guess it’s true what they say, it’s better to be lucky than skilled.”, he says, loading one of the remaining corks. 

Even the base, almost insect-like intellect of the animated objects knows to stay back from Leo now. But it’s a fleeting thing, three shots and dozens of objects closing in. It’s not a recipe for success. 

Mike is standing now, looking dazed, and wiping as much of the remaining hair from his body as he can. He points to a recessed black door marked ‘ Employees Only’. Before gagging, and beginning to lope toward it. 

“Didn’t you say you were an alcoholic?” I say, more trying to keep my mind off of the impending doom around me than anything. 

“Was, now I’d be classified as a problem drinker. 

I haven’t eaten anything real or drank liquid without the word ‘ Extreme’ in the name in god knows how long. Not to mention no booze.  

It’s hitting me like a fucking sledgehammer.” Mike replies, shoulder charging through the locked door.

We’re back in the cramped hallway, Mike picking himself up from the floor. The exit sign is to our right about fifteen feet away, and just like Mike predicted the sound room sits just beyond that. 

I get a good look at Mike. In shorts and boots, just how bad he’s hurting is obvious. Torn patches of skin, ribs sticking out at odd angles, and enough bruising to seem like a terrible tattoo job. 

His loping isn’t some affectation, it’s his left knee being roughly the size of a softball. 

As we get to the exit Will reveals himself. 

He doesn’t burst through the wall, or appear in a blast of energy. He simply walks, casually out of the soundroom. Something about that makes the fear worse. 

Mike steadies himself against a wall. 

Will is leaning into the cowboy angle hard. Long, torn leather duster, moth eaten cowboy hat, and armed with a collection of no doubt esoteric western-themed equipment, from six shooter to lasso. 

“Thought I’d dress for the occasion. My old kit from the mountain, with a few bits and pieces from this place. 

When in Rome and all that.” Will says with a rotten toothed grin. 

And it hits me. 

We’re fucked.

Mike tries to talk, coughs up a mouthful of blood, and leans against the wall. 

“I’m not going to have to do much more than wait, am I?” Will says smugly to Mike. 

Mike wipes his mouth, I ready myself for the vitriolic tirade the clown surely has planned. Even if it is just a play for time. 

“Yeah, I’m out. You win. Fuck me, you won way back on the Mountain.” Mike slides down the exit door, hitting the ground roughly, “Any chance of a last smoke? It’s been a rough ride.”

Will sneers at Mike, a look of superiority on his face, “Don’t leave home without ‘em.” He says, pulling a surprisingly modern looking pack of cigarettes  from a pocket of his duster. He lights one handing it to Mike. 

My friend takes a few puffs, red tinted saliva now beginning  to drip from one side of his mouth. His countless wounds soon leave him sitting in a pool of blood.  

Will stalks toward me. 

“Now, you on the other hand, little partner, I’ve got some long term plans for.” The cowboy grins, and I feel that familiar hold take over, that sense of my body no longer being my own, “Tell me how this idea grabs you. 

We go back to my workshop, I break you down and reassemble you into something fun. A torture kit, maybe a chainsaw. I leave just enough meat in there that you know what’s going on. 

Then from now to the heat death of the fucking universe, I use you on the most innocent people I can find. 

That tickle your fancy lil fella?” 

I have nothing to say, both figuratively and literally. This is the end of the line, Mike’s stopped breathing, I’m held fast, and Leo is trying to hold back the remaining animated objects with the threat of his last cork. 

I look upward, wanting to at least make eye contact with Will. It might be damn near homeopathic defiance, but it’s defiance none the less. 

Behind Will, he stands. 

No less than seven feet tall, clad in an ancient looking pitch black raincoat and dark tweed suit. A tophat adds to the figure’s height. 

It's Mike’s body, but it’s been changed, warped, features nearly cartoonishly redefined. Not a scratch nor bruise on it. 

I could spend ten pages talking about the minutia of the man standing behind Will, but I won’t. 

It was, in no uncertain terms, Jack the fucking Ripper. 

He bends low, putting his large nose nearly in Will’s cowboy hat and inhaling. 

Will is shocked, spinning around and drawing a pistol. 

“A revenant? I’d have expected more from something with such a pedigree.

William, correct? 

I’m sure I need no introduction.” Demetrious says. His voice, is an English accented bass rumble. Nothing like Mike’s Manhattan snark. 

“You don’t” Will says, seeming to have an ace up his sleeve, “But, I’m not seeing any of your trinkets hanging off that shitty suit.”

Will cocks the pistol. 

“Oh, it’s true, a few years back my collection of esoterica was destroyed. Rather spectacularly, if I do say so myself.

And alas, without it, I’m not half the man I was.” Demi laments. 

He grins, perfect teeth nearly glowing in the dark hallway. 

“But, I can assure you, in any measure, half of mine, is worth two of yours.” Demi’s grin goes feral, red irised eyes widening as he casually flicks his wrist. 

Will slams into the walls and floors in succession. With one swiping motion Demi sends him crashing through a brick wall, hitting the back of his crowd of possessed objects like a cannonball.     

The possessed objects stagger as their master is disoriented, his concentration broken. 

Demi surveys the scene. Interest, even delight show clearly on his angular face. 

He casually steps through the hole Will put in the wall. As he does, objects begin to gravitate toward him. They start to orbit around him like planets, the mannequins, and wax figures wielding them falling, inert to the ground. 

  When he speaks, walls shake, dim lights flicker, and he holds the attention of everyone in the room. 

“I am the prodigal son. I am the noble heretic.” Demi begins, more objects joining the orbit, “I am the wolf at the edge of fire. I am what none of you can be, I am the fucking…” 

The force wielding Mike’s body is cut short. 

Will’s lasso ensnares him, in an instant there is no Demi. Just Mike, looking a little less banged up, but still naked, afraid and confused. 

Will lets go of the lasso, the now living rope starting to twist and constrict around the clown. 

The things around us get their bearings, closing in like rolling fog. 

Sveta is missing a limb, even her deific powers are at their limit.  Leo finds himself out of ammunition. Kaz and Hyve seem to be trying some kind of ritual, but the energy can’t find an anchor. We’ve played every card we have. 

“That there, is called a ‘Nope Rope’ don’t ask me why all of these things have to have some kind of a pun name, that’s for bigger minds than mine. 

But the gist of it is, it stops shit from happening.” Will might as well be the devil himself. He walks through his army, fearlessly enjoying our impending death. “That being said, I think I should be hitting the old dusty trail. 

If you got any last words, say ‘em now cowpokes.”

Watching acceptance fall over the faces of my friends is the worst thing I’ve seen by far. 

“I do.” Says a small, warped voice from near the entrance. 

Will raises an eyebrow, looking toward the sound. 

She walks out of the shadows, a heartbreaking, misshapen thing. An accident of reality. The result of too many people playing with too many forces of nature. 

If I could cry, I would. 

Her torn eye is back, but it takes up a third of her face. A massive, diplopic thing, it flicks around wildly. 

Her entire body looks like someone tried to repair it in a rush. Shattered limbs have too many joints. Missing pieces plugged with tumorous growths or spurs of bone. 

Will starts to laugh, looking to us in turn, then back to Alex. 

“She’s a broken one, ain’t she? Never seen nothing like that. 

Come on over here darling.” Will says, beckoning Alex over. 

Alex mumbles to herself, her attention seemingly elsewhere. But slowly, like a stray cat, she makes her way over to Will. 

The cowboy cocks his oversized handgun, pointing it at Alex’s head. I can’t help but think maybe what he has planned is the most humane option. 

“You guys think the sequel will be as good as the original?” Will taunts. 

She grabs his wrist, faster than I can track. I brace myself for the gunshot.

But it never comes. 

Will’s eyes widen, then I see it too. 

Where Alex is touching, isn’t leathery undead flesh, but healthy living skin. 

She opens her mouth, revealing rows of needle like teeth. With a movement like a striking cobra she bites through the newly invigorated flesh. 

Will’s scream is high pitched and pathetic. The sound of something that has never known pain, getting a crash course in the subject. 

The gun drops, the things around us begin to move erratically. 

Alex looks to Sveta, tossing Will’s blood dripping hand to her. The werewolf catches and swallows it in an instant. Her wounds go from pouring blood to merely dripping. 

Will stares at his bloody stump in disbelief, screaming, eyes wild with pain. 

The things around us start to fall, flopping and crawling on the ground like dying fish. 

Will makes a break for the exit, his stride meandering, his arm spurting dark black fluid. 

Mike escapes the rope, and tries to tackle will. His aim is off, his mind foggy from the brutal transformation. But will trips over the lunging clown. 

Sveta charges, pushing herself as hard as she can. Will manages to get into the hallway by the exit, the canine deity too large to follow. 

All of us are too wounded to quickly follow, the revenant turns to us, visibly pushing back pain. 

“It’s been slice rancheros.” He taunts turning the knob. 

The door doesn’t move.

“Three things a smart man doesn’t leave the house without. Multitool, WD-40, and threadlock.” Mike says, shakily getting to his feet and using me for balance, “I figured you’d have a plan for Demi. And a big enough ego to turn your back to me.”

Will tries to run down the hallway, Sveta’s remaining arm plunges through the hole in the wall, blocking his path. 

Leo, Kaz and Hyve join us. 

The look of fear on Will’s face almost makes everything worth it. 

He begins to beg as Alex walks over. There’s recognition somewhere deep in her misaligned eyes. 

“Nine corners, nine cats lives, nine chances.” Alex mumbles, almost skipping toward will. Her limbs moving almost spider-like. 

“Listen, I can tell you where the bishop is going to be!” Will pleads. 

“I can do that.” Leo says, the look on his face dark. 

“I help you kill him!” Is Will’s next attempt. 

“I’ve got a whole army of spooky crap just waiting for the word go. Try again.” Mike says a maniac grin creeping up his face. 

“I can tell you *how* to kill him. How to do it without his people coming after you.” Will stammers. 

Alex is inches from him, her twisted form almost his height. 

“I became two, you become five. I’ll leave you your voice, and leave you alive.” Alex says, putting one hand on each of Will’s shoulders. 

“Sure, anything, just let me go.” Will’s tone is hopeful. 

“No.” Alex says, drawing out the word as Will’s eyes widen in horror. 

 Somewhere in that thin form is strength that rivals anything I’ve seen. She tears both limbs free of Will’s body. 

The undead bastard screams loud enough to tear apart his vocal cords. Hitting the ground, able to do nothing other than wail in agony. 

What Alex does to him isn’t right. Not by any stretch of the imagination. It’s vengeance by way of mutilation. Acts brutal enough, I’m not going to tarnish her memory with describing them. By the end Will sits in five pieces. 

Mike is working on unfucking the door, the rest of us are trying to get or keep our shit together. But if Will isn’t lying, were going to be bringing hell to the bishop. 

Once he stops screaming long enough to tell us anyway. 

Till next time. 

Avoid the darkness. 

Punch.
