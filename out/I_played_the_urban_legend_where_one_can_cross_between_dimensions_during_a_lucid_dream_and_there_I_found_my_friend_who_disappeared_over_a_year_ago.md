A little over a month ago, my ex-girlfriend Sara was found murdered. Outside the alleyway near her university, yet nothing could be captured over the camera about her perpetrators. We broke up 6 weeks before her body was found. The reason for our breakup was rather mature, yet apathetic. Long distance. Our universities were two states apart.

Sure we tried to get into the same one, but the one she chose didn't have my subject of passion and vice versa. We were civil when we broke up. We considered it to be a "reasonable decision" even though I loved her. But we weren't star-crossed lovers. It wasn't a forced break-up on my end, rather I suggested it myself. To which she reluctantly agreed. I wasn't even unhappy with her non-hesitant agreement, yet I found myself often thinking if we made the right decision. My feelings were confused and entangled but all came rushing down to me when her brother called me to let me know the devastating news.

Her death. It broke me. When we broke up, we were still on a whim that we'd get back together when we'd be close again, it was like an unspoken desire. But the reality that I would never have her in my arms again made me realize how much I needed her. How much I loved her and that long distance would have been nothing for the two of us. Sure we weren't Romeo and Juliet, they are overrated anyway but we could have been Elizabeth and Darcy! But someone who was even more broken than me, was her brother, Seth.

Sarah was his only family alive. They were practically orphans when Sarah took it upon herself to make sure to give him and her the brightest future possible. She was his sister, mother, father, mentor, and everything. As soon as I got the news I got myself a flight and reached the funeral home. Seth was in shambles. I have seen both of them almost throughout my life. So yes I have definitely seen him in bad situations. But never have I seen him so broken. So drenched out. It was like his life and hunger were squeezed out of him. He was completing the funeral duties like a robot. Forcing every smile, every greeting.

When he saw me, he broke down in tears. A familiar face, is probably what he thought.

Ever since then, all investigations hit a wall and dead end. All the possible suspects, like me, an ex or someone she had a feud with were out of state or occupied during the hour of the murder. And since the autopsy results came out, it showed that she had been under the influence of drugs and that her body had been injecting it for quite a while. After that, the police started to investigate the local drug dealers. This was a shocker to both her brother and me because no matter how hard times were Sarah wasn't a person to turn to substance as a solution.

With no leads and accepting her death, I somewhat started to move on. Yet there was still a hole in my heart. Also, I had to return back to my Uni thus I couldn't be longer there to take care of her brother either. Up about a month or so later Seth turned up at my University. At my dorm lobby.

Some guys who stayed on the ground floor rang me to let me know that someone came looking for me. I ran down to find an even more wrecked-looking Seth. He looked like he hadn't had a proper meal in days. His eye bags looked twice as darker. Skin looking dehydrated and pale. His fingers were shaking.

" I know a way to talk to sarah. It works. You know It actually works! I saw her! I Saw her" his eyes twitched as he spoke but he looked so hopeful. I immediately knew what he was talking about. He did something extremely dangerous. I promptly got the permission and took him straight to my room.

I slammed the door and asked him, "What the heck did you do Seth?"

My glaring eyes at him soon turned into terror when he said, "The sleep game."

"Why Seth Why why why? why did you do so?"

As much as I do not believe in this stuff to be real, they also petrify me.

What he "tried" was a lucid dream gateway. You have all heard of urban legends like Three Kings, Elevator Game to the other world, or Hide and seek. In all these games you play a game with a set of rules to enter, see or interact with another dimension, another world.

Now doing it in awake form is very hard. Triggering the rituals is like one in a billion chance and that is because when you are awake your spiritual connection with the void is very low. Imagine it like a chemical reaction. You have the reactants, but you don't have the catalyst to start the reaction. Now imagine you were somewhere, where the catalyst is overflowing. The catalyst being your spiritual self, somewhere you had a full connection, performing a ritual there would be a 100% successful trigger.

When a person dreams, they reach that spiritual state of mind. Where our subconscious is elevated. It is often said, when a person dreams, they can connect to many things, maybe the future, sometimes, other people, ending up in a shared psychosis dream or sometimes other dimensions. But it can never happen on our will because we cannot control our dreams as we don't even know that we are dreaming when we are asleep.

So how do we control our dreams? When we reach a lucid state. A lucid dream is where one can control their dream because they are aware of the fact that they are dreaming. Therefore a Catalyst that we can control.

How do I know all of these? Seth, myself, and Mira, we used to discuss all of these during our teenage years a lot. We got a lot into the internet horror culture, tried Planchet, bloody mary, etc. and researched a lot a heck lot! But this was all fun and games. And it slowly died down when we got older. Also about our friend, Mirajane, who disappeared out of the blue a year ago. thus talking about the paranormal caused us more pain than fun because it always reminded us of her.

Now getting into a lucid dream is as hard as it sounds. But Seth here says he met her? He met sarah? I think he just saw an elaborate dream.

"Seth I think you just dreamt of Sarah, there's no way you'd see her. also are you sure you lucid dreamt? It's really hard you know that"

"Not sarah!" he stood up as he replied to me. " I saw Mira." He calmed down his agitated self while I was in shock. and completed by saying  "Also yes it was definitely a lucid dream. It was as lucid as water."

*"Mira."* He said. Not in 100 years did I think I would hear her name again.

"If we can convince her, she can lead us to Sarah. Please you have to do this with me so that we can ask for her help."

"You see Mira and the first thing you can think of is how to use her to talk to Sarah, you didn't bother asking how she ended up there?!" I think I almost lost it on him and his delusions.

"I couldn't talk to Mira. I just saw a glimpse of her. Please just believe me. And yes Of course i want to know how she ended up there. But I only saw her twice. And none of the times could i talk to her. But she might know what happened to Sarah. Please Jake understand, She is my sister. Mira is not!"

He didn't lie. Sarah was his sister and the woman I loved. Even though I know all that is coming out of Seth's mouth is nothing but delusion and dream, the mere thought that i could see Sarah again does make my heart a bit excited. But I had to be rational. Seth was still young. He just turned 18. He is at a loss in life with his sister and his only family member's complete absence.

I send him away to his aunt. But the whole lucid thing stuck with me for quite a while. The thought of seeing Sarah again or at least finding out how what happened to her actually happened was enough to push me to it. 

I started researching again. How to lucid dream? I knew this was all silly and Seth needed immediate therapy, which I did suggest to his aunt over call. But I just had to at least try once. I went through the sites which had the most comments and ratings and gathered up some methods and rules.

1. Firstly we have to create a setting of a dream to which we will activate our state of mind in. And to get a specific one we have to think of a dream. Of a setting that we want. And continue thinking about it so much that it actually gets embedded onto our subconscious and actually occurs as a dream.
2. Once we have the dream of the setting we have to make sure we continuously have the dream every day or alternate days. and not get involved in something too interesting like watching a movie where a new setting will get into our brains and we will stop dreaming about the original setting
3. After a stream of the same dream has been set, we have to notice the things around us, maybe a pen, a clip, or a notebook. anything that will make us aware of the fact that we are in a dream. The only way to lucid dream is to make your brain realize it's a dream.
4. before going to sleep you have to murmur to your brain that you are going to sleep that means you will dream and whatever you will see is not a reality, it's a fiction of your brain.
5. Sometimes taking a 30-40 min break between sleep helps, it doesn't let your brain indulge in a deep sleep and you can remind yourself that you are sleeping.

I tried this for over a week, and the only thing i could attain was a similar setting. but every time i woke up i realized i could never remind myself that i am dreaming. I needed something to remind myself. something that would work for me to realize i am dreaming.  

Last night when i dreamt. It happened. I saw Sarah's coat. The one that has been confiscated by the police, the one she was wearing the day of her death. I have never seen it before in my setting and neither did i think of it any time before. and i knew i was in a dream. To try it out I stood in front of a door and imagined it to open and as voila! it opened without anyone touching it. I roamed around this dream world with my newly found freedom. 

'As long as no one from your wake world enters your dream you can always go back home even if the dream messes up. But if you have company you all should be careful. Also remember the difference between entering someone's dream or having a shared psychosis, If it's the later, then again you are safe'. One of the websites said.

Well i am all alone so there won't be any problem, i wondered to myself. Shared psychosis is when, two people dreaming at the same time, bring their consciousness together and combine their dreams, very different from entering someone else's dream. 

After venturing around for quite a while and having fun. I got serious. What is Seth was right? what if I could see Sarah again? I could try out a lot of rituals here, right? Sure! Then i might just try out the simplest. The Japanese Bus legend:

It's pretty simple: You get to a particular location in Akihabara, and at around 2 am a bus arrives. You will only see the bus if you are desperate enough. If you ride it, it will take you to reality and beyond. And in my lucid dream, desperation is a physical quantity and so is time.  


 I could imagine i amJapann, wait until it's 2 a,m and then hop onto the bus that leads to dea.? wouldn't that work? It probably won't and i will just wake up. but hey I'll have fun.

I slowly imagined myself getting a bit of money, taking a cab to the airport, and magically buying a last moment ticket to Tokyo. I reached Tokyo and then took a cab to Akihabara. Where the infamous bus often goes by.

Dreams don't have clocks.  but I can imagine that there is. and then POPs up!  a street clock at exactly 1:50 am. The clock steadily passes by and the bus arrives. I was petrified when it did because the driver's seat was blank. Shen i imagined it, i definitely expected a happy man in his 50s for some reason driving it. Isn't it my lucid dream? Why is there no driver? 

But paying less head to it I almost got up on the bus when a huge jerk from behind me on my shoulder pushed me down on the floor. I  looked up to see a glance of a woman. With jet black hair, light skin, and hazel eyes with an extremely domineering look, glaring at me. It was Mira. and before i could say anything i saw her eyes glowing, literally glowing, and next thing i know i woke up. 

I am typing this right now as i am packing my bags to go back to my home state to visit Seth and let him know what completely went on. I send him a text and he said he wanted to come and visit me, but  i refused and let him know that i would come instead. Whatever we do cannot happen here, two states away. It needs to happen where it started, Sarah's death and Mira's disappearance. 

I have no idea where to start and what to do next. Any form of advice would be appreciated!
