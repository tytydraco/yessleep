Hi everyone, this is my first ever post on reddit, and I’m only posting on here because my partner thinks I might be able to get some advice. I’ve also posted this to other subreddits as well, because I am desperately seeking opinions. I feel like I’m going insane.
I have lived in my house my entire life, it’s a two story brick home with wooden floors and a two room extension on the back of it- looking out into the back yard. That’s where I live. I have my bedroom and my lounge room that are connected, there’s direct entry into the lounge room through the back door that comes from the yard. It’s important to note that my bedroom window is on a “second storey”, my 6”8 partner had to be on his tippy toes to touch the glass of my window. 

For a quite a while I have felt incredibly uneasy being home alone, whether is it during the day or at night. My partner and I chalked it up to poor mental health, considering no one else in my family seemed to notice anything off. Another point of note: all the women in my family, including me, have experienced something of the paranormal in their lives. Now, a couple of weeks ago, I woke up to what I believed to be the sound of my back door handle being played with. It’s an old squeaky glass and wood door with metal handles, a very distinct sound. After being frozen in place for quite a while, I then turned in bed to face my window and grab my phone. I have horrible eye sight, but what I believe I saw was a tall, white, skinny figure right at the back of my yard near my dad’s shed. I rubbed it off as a trick of my mind, and went back to bed after shutting my curtains. Another note: I used to always sleep with my curtains open until this incident.

A few days ago I was laying in bed watching tiktoks, it was about 1am and I hadn’t slept yet. I also wasn’t tired at all. My curtains were closed but my window was open. My phone was on full brightness and my volume was loud too. When I eventually turned off my phone and rolled over, I heard a very clear, distinct knocking on my bedroom window. It was knuckles on glass. After being completely frozen for about 3-5 minutes, I rolled over and called my dad. Call went to voicemail. After the voicemail tone rang out I heard shuffling and movement from under my window. Dad eventually came with a floodlight torch, and nothing. 

My partner was worried about a stalker, so we set up a ring camera. There’s been nothing yet. Not even a single animal. I am house sitting currently but I visited my home at around 2pm yesterday. Home alone. Front door was locked but back door was open as I was repotting a plant in my yard. I have had really good mental health recently, so I know my feelings are not attributed to that. Sitting in the back yard I thought I could hear walking around in the house behind me, and I distinctly remember being too scared to look back at the house from the yard. I got cold all over, like my body froze up. I feel okay being in my room or my lounge room, but the rest of the house gives me a deep uneasy feeling that nags at me constantly when I’m alone. My entire life I’ve always known when I’ve been watched as I get a sharp tingling down my spine. It can happen at random, but it is ALWAYS followed by that incredibly intense uneasy feeling.

I’m sorry for such a long post, but if anyone has any advice or ideas that would be greatly appreciated!! I want to add that there is more to this story than just the above experiences, but I felt these were most pertinent to grasping what I’m going through.

Thanks
