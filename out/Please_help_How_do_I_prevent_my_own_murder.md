Hey guys. Sorry if this is written weird or anything, I’m really scared right now and I need some advice. Please read until the end.



So I guess I’ll just start from the beginning: I know I’ll be killed today.



Well… yeah. This is going to take a lot of explaining.



It actually started about a year ago; my ability to see the future, that is. Well, that’s the best way I can describe it. It’s not exactly like that. It’s almost like… I live some days twice. If that makes sense. I know it doesn’t, but stay with me.



It was a cool morning on March 3rd, 2023. The first of many days I will end up experiencing for a second time. The mornings are my favorite time of day, so I was glad to don a light jacket and take my dog for her daily walk, breathe in the fresh air and watch the sun edge over the horizon. It was a Friday, the final day of a stressful work week. I work as an actuary for this mediocrely sized tech company, which is great because the pay is alright and the office is only a short bus ride from my apartment. Anyway, not the point. Sorry, I ramble when I’m anxious.



The walk was much needed: I felt my jaw unhinge slightly as I breathed and my legs loosen as I walked. My dog, Arla, is well trained, and typically stays right by my side as we traverse the suburban sidewalks. This Friday morning, for the first time since she was a puppy, something had changed in her calm demeanor. At first, she stayed right with me as she usually does. Until she didn’t. As I took in a big relieved sigh, I felt a tug on my loosened arm. Arla had stood still, her nose to the air.



“What is it, girl?” I asked her. Her ears twitched a bit, and I could tell that her little brain was whirring behind her eyes. Maybe she had caught a particularly strong scent? But she didn’t move.



“Come on, let’s go. I’ve got to get to work,” I said, pulling the leash gently in my direction. It was this sudden movement that sparked a spiral of actions, almost happening in slow motion. I saw a wave of the leash roll from my hand to Arla’s collar. I saw the collar pull lightly on top of Arla’s now activated muscles as she turned to the side, quickly facing the road. I was still in shock when I felt her leash being ripped from my loose hand, when I saw her run across the asphalt, and when I heard the screeching of the tires and the heavy impact of meat on metal.



I think I screamed. After this moment, some of the details of this first day are… fuzzy. I know I called my best friend, Kasey, to see if he could come and take both of us to a vet hospital. Kasey agreed, even though he’d been woken up by my frantic calls. The car ride was sickening. I had wrapped Arla in two separate towels, both of which were soaked in blood by the time we arrived. The vet told me what I already knew: she had been dead on impact. I called in sick to work after that, and I left her body with them to be cremated. Kasey came back to my apartment and sat with me, giving me a cup of warm tea and letting me lean against him while I sobbed. But he had to leave for work eventually, so he gave me a tight hug before closing the door to my apartment behind him. After that, I was alone. I don’t think I did anything except scrub my hands with soap to rid them of phantom blood, and lay on the couch quietly for the rest of the day.



Sorry, writing this still makes me shudder. I don’t know if I want to think too hard about it.



Eventually, I tried to sleep. Obviously it took awhile, after the horrors of what I’d seen that morning. But when sleep came, I felt blessed to be taken out of the real world, at least for a little bit.



It was when I woke up the next morning to my alarm that I knew something was odd. Not odd in the grieving way, as you may expect, but just… familiar. I seemed to be well rested, though I had a slight tension throughout my body. I felt the same as I had the morning prior, as a matter of fact, mentally steeling myself for the last day of the work week. The sun’s light had just started to brighten my room. Weirdest of all, though, was that alarm. Even though I’m a morning person, I set my alarm for 5:30 just to make sure that I’m up in time to do everything I want to before I leave for the day. But the soft buzzing from under my pillow is only set to go off on weekdays so I can rise slowly and naturally on my days off. Wasn’t it supposed to be a Saturday?



Slightly confused but not confused enough to worry, I turned off my alarm and sat up in bed, stretching my arms. It was at this point that I remembered the events of the day yesterday. My face fell into a frown, and my arms crashed down onto my lap. I missed her, I did. But no tears fell. I just sat there, with a vague feeling of sadness for the presence I used to have in my lonely apartment. I look to my right at Arla’s dog bed on the floor. She was a decently sized pitbull, so I didn’t allow her to sleep on my already cramped full mattress.



To my surprise, my dog was sleeping right there, curled up like she always is. I rubbed my eyes. What?? I watched her die! I thought I must've been seeing things, so I reached out and touched her. She cracked open her eyes and glanced at me as I felt her coarse fur under my fingertips. My dog is alive, and breathing. I began to think that maybe watching Arla get hit by a car was just a bad dream, so I rose from the bed and got myself ready.



I kept my eye on Arla for a while, as I made a quick breakfast for myself. I grabbed my phone to check my socials while I ate, and noticed something weird. The date displayed on the lock screen was March 3rd. I could’ve sworn I had already spent March 3rd grieving the loss of my dead dog… but everything was telling me that I had just had a nightmare last night. I clearly hadn’t lived a whole day. Even though it felt so real.



I took a deep breath and decided I was still going to go for my morning walk with Arla. The more I convinced myself that I had just dreamt everything, the more the memories began to lose their weight, until they just drifted around in my mind. Thinking back, I was probably dissociating. So I hooked her up to the leash, grabbed my jacket, and we went out.



The morning was cool and brisk, and the sun was just starting to peek over the edge. Just like it had the day before. Or, the day of? I’m not sure how to refer to something like this. Arla walked right next to me, and everything felt normal. Normal, besides the increasing paranoia I felt as we walked past signs and markings on the road that reminded me of Arla’s death. When we arrived at the same street where I’d watched Arla run into oncoming traffic, my grip tightened on the leash. I’m glad it did, because I felt Arla stop walking, just as she’d done the last time we were here. I froze, and slowly turned so that I faced her. Her nose was to the air, and her ears twitched slightly. I noticed they were edging in the direction of the road.



Not doomed to repeat my nightmare, I grabbed the leash with my other hand. It was then Arla pulled as hard as she could towards the asphalt, just like she’d done before. In my heightened state, I held on for dear life, planting my feet to the ground. It only took about 10 seconds for her to stop moving. Defeated and panting, she came back to my side, eyeing the road. Or, something across it. I noticed a dark figure standing completely still on the other sidewalk. It seemed to be human… well, maybe it wasn’t. Its arms and legs were a little longer than I would expect. I couldn’t make out any details of its features; it was as if the figure was out of focus and bathed in a nonexistent shadow. I only saw so much before a bus passed in front of my gaze. When I was able to see across the road again, the figure was gone, replaced by an extra fat squirrel looking right at Arla, taunting. I blinked. Wow, I was really going crazy. That squirrel must’ve been the reason for her death the day before. It surprised me still, as Arla was usually a lot more behaved than she was in that moment.



I was a bit shaky as we finished our walk home. The image of the car slamming into Arla danced through my mind as I did the New York Times crossword and then even later when I headed off to work.



During my lunch break, I decided to call Kasey and ask him if he remembered taking me and Arla to the vet hospital, or making me tea back at my apartment.



“Hey, Kasey,” I said into the phone.



“Hey Sam. Are you alright?” he said.



“Uh… yeah, I am. I was just wondering if you remembered me calling you yesterday.”



I could almost hear his brow furrow through the phone.



“What do you mean?” He asked.



“You don’t remember seeing me… yesterday?”



“I do not. I saw you last weekend though, is this about that?”



“Oh, sorry, no it’s not. I might be thinking of someone else. Sorry to bother you. Talk to you later?”



He chuckled a bit at my stuttering.“Uh, yeah, okay. We can chat later. Bye.”



“Bye.” I pulled my phone down from my ear, probably more confused at that moment than I had been this whole time.



The rest of that day was normal, surprisingly. I was on edge, but everything just… went on as usual. The fact that it was normal was actually the very thing I felt was strange.



Waking up the next morning to the sun flooding my room and Arla sleeping in her bed next to me ended this wretched schedule. I quickly checked my phone, and I sighed with relief when I saw the number 4 on my screen. Finally, those two -- or one? -- hellish days were over.



…



So that was the first day. I didn’t relive a day again until three weeks later. I had finally calmed down from the strange experience, the memories faded in my mind. That day, I was getting coffee at a Starbucks sometime in the afternoon when a man in a mask walked through the door. He had a large gun pointed towards the cashiers. He didn’t shoot anyone, but stole a good chunk of cash from the register and a poor college student’s laptop. He had gone before the police could show up. I was shaken, but I left the building unscathed after the police had asked all of us some questions.



When I woke up the next morning, I felt like I knew what I had to do. I got out of bed and checked my phone. Sure enough, the day had repeated itself yet again. It’s an odd feeling, repeating the day. Almost like deja vu. But I knew I had to do something about what happened, to change the outcome.



Anxiety was high as the time creeped closer to afternoon; my plan was to call the police around the time I had been getting coffee. Maybe I could use this fucked up power for good, I thought to myself. So I did. I told them that there was a man with a gun at the Starbucks Coffee closest to my apartment. 



Once I got off the phone, I took a deep breath. The tragedy didn’t happen this time, I was sure it didn’t. I changed the future, in a way. For the better.



But when I woke up the next morning, the ACTUAL next morning, I was shocked to see that the situation had escalated. I saw the news unfold on my phone through a helicopter view: the man with the gun had been boxed in by police, and he had created a hostage situation with the rest of the patrons. The college student whose laptop had been stolen during the first day was instead dead. I could barely eat the oatmeal I had confidently prepared for breakfast.



Did I kill him?



Bringing my phone closer to my face, I could’ve sworn I saw a deep shadow standing clearly in the daylight. It was staring right through my screen. But I can’t be sure of what I saw.



I learned that the choices I made when I was lucky enough to get a “second day” mattered. I needed to think long and hard about what I would do when the next tragedy came to me. I was granted a second try a couple more times in the last year. Every month or so something bad would happen for seemingly no reason -- my bank account was drained, my mom fell down the stairs and broke her arm, etc. etc. Sometimes my solutions would work, and the day would go much better the second try. Other times… not so much. It’s those times that I can’t help but feel guilty for making a worse decision when I was lucky enough to get a second chance.



Actually, that’s kind of why I’m here. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to make the better choice.



I died yesterday.



I woke up early, as I usually do. It was Saturday, a day off from work. I busied myself cleaning my small kitchen, with YouTube blaring in the background. Kasey had bought three tickets to a concert tonight, and one of my favorite up and coming local artists was an opener. I enjoy going to concerts when I can, so of course I said yes when he offered me a ticket. Once I finished cleaning the kitchen, I opened my phone again to reread the texts out of excitement.



Kasey: hey sam ! I got tickets to go see Theoretical Pretender on Saturday

Kasey: …and Overkill is opening for them

Kasey: thought you might enjoy???



Me: Of course I’ll come that sounds like fun!!!!

Me: What time?



Kasey: I can pick you up at 6:30?



Me: That sounds great!! I can venmo you for the tickets on Saturday

Me: Is there anyone else going?



I was pretty sure that this wasn’t a date, because Kasey and I are just really good friends… but I wanted to check. Just in case.



Kasey: Oh, yeah I got three tickets so one of my friends is coming too

Kasey: I don’t think you’ve met him, his name’s Jon

Kasey: I think you’ll like him though he’s a funny dude



Me: Haha ok sounds good



Kasey had mentioned this friend, Jon, before. He’d told me a few funny stories of times when they were hanging out, doing stupid stuff. But he was right, I’d never actually met him. I was fine with him bringing a friend to this concert, I actually appreciated the opportunity to grow my tiny social circle. I should’ve suspected that tonight would be a prime opportunity for a tragedy to occur. It had also been a few weeks since the last one.



The time finally came where I saw Kasey’s grey Kia Soul pull up to the front of my apartment. I didn’t even wait for a text saying “I’m here!”, I just grabbed my small backpack and left, locking the door behind me.



Kasey was waiting happily for me in the car. He smiled when he saw me.



“Hey!” He said. “Are you ready?”



“Yeah! I think I have everything…” I rummage through my little backpack, feeling for all of my necessities. “Yeah. Let’s head out.”



We listened to one of the best Overkill albums on the way, singing along and trying to guess which songs Theoretical Pretender would play as the headliners of this concert.



Finally, we arrived at the venue. I had seen the stadium when we were about 8 minutes away. It got me excited for the performance I was going to witness.



We found a parking spot, got out of the car, and waited for Jon just outside the row of doors where we would enter the building. It only took 5 minutes of waiting before Kasey saw him. He waved, and jumped up and down a little bit. I froze, my smile quickly gone. It was the figure I had seen across the road when Arla died. Or… almost died. The image of her getting hit by the car played in my mind as “Jon” used those uncomfortably long limbs to get closer.



Before I knew it, the figure was right next to us. Kasey gave him -- it -- a hug. Its body still seemed out of focus and void-like. The spots where its limbs overlapped with Kasey’s felt like all the light was being sucked away. Kasey turned to me, and the figure did the same.



“Sam, this is my friend Jon. Jon, this is my friend Sam,” he said, gesturing to us both. “Both of you really like Overkill so I kind of figured that you might like to come. And you have something in common to talk about!”



I stood still, frozen. The figure’s featureless face bored into me as if it was staring me down. In a way, it felt like my light was being sucked into its emptiness. I squinted as I tried to focus on the figure’s defining edges, but it’s almost like it was blurred as much as the background in professional photographs.



“Are you okay?” Kasey’s voice brought me back into the world. He was staring at me nervously, and glancing at the outstretched “hand” that Jon had extended in my direction.



“Yeah, yeah… I’m okay,” I said. I timidly reached out my hand and shook. It was freezing cold, and our touch stung my skin a bit. “It’s… nice to meet you.”



The figure didn’t respond, but nodded instead.



“Jon doesn’t talk much,” said Kasey. “He’s more of a physical comedy kinda guy.” Kasey grinned at me and led us into the concert. Everything was telling me to run away from this situation, but I couldn’t leave Kasey alone with this… this creature. Kasey seemed so sure that this figure was a normal man named Jon. I didn’t want to look crazy in front of my best friend by pointing out that it was in fact a manifestation of a deep, endless Void. And that the last time I saw him, my dog died.



As the music started, I found it hard to enjoy myself. I didn’t even have to look around to know where Jon was, because I could feel his cold presence. He didn’t dance or mosh, but just stood, a still presence in the sea of happy people. Nobody seemed to notice him though. Occasionally Kasey would lean over and tell him something and he would laugh while the figure remained unmoving. A few times I caught Kasey sending a worried glance in my direction. He asked me if I was okay, and I told him I was, just that I was feeling a little sick. He gave a worried sigh and told me to take it easy. I got the impression that he wouldn’t take me home if I asked him to. Jon’s presence must have changed him, just like it did for Arla on that very first day.



It was about 50 agonizing minutes after the concert had started where things went wrong, as I knew they would.



The figure had turned away from the lights and music of the concert and was now staring directly at Kasey, who was singing along at the top of his lungs next to me. I froze again. I had been doing a lot of freezing that night.



“Are you sure you’re okay? You seriously look like you’re gonna throw up,” Kasey said as he stopped to look at me. I couldn’t take my eyes off of the figure. It began to walk towards us, its empty face pointing right at Kasey. I watched as its “fingers” grew to an unnatural length, and the ends thinned out until they became sharp points. They were almost long enough to drag on the floor.



It was going to kill him.



Suddenly, I wasn’t frozen anymore. I moved forward right as it lifted its knife-like fingers and lunged at Kasey, who didn’t even have time to flinch. I felt every inch of them enter my chest. I expected the wounds to be hot with blood, but instead they were freezing. Then I felt its fingers rip out of my body. I heard Kasey frantically say my name as I fell to the floor. My eyes were open, but everything around me looked hazy and unreal. Nobody seemed to realize that the figure was the one that stabbed me as they all looked down on me with shock. Through the haze I saw a flicker of what looked like a concerned, bearded blond man in place of the empty void. That must’ve been the “Jon” that Kasey was seeing. But that image quickly fell back to empty darkness.



To be honest, I wouldn’t wish death via stabbing on anybody. It didn’t feel great to bleed out, there on the floor. My chest throbbed deeply as I saw Kasey frantically calling 911. Ironically, that’s probably what I looked like asking him over the phone to take me and Arla to the vet hospital.



I heard Kasey’s voice, sounding far away.



“Jon, check her pulse! Quickly!”



Then, I felt something sharp and cold on my neck, and saw the dark, blurred outline of the figure leaning down towards my face.



“See you tomorrow,” it said in a raspy voice… no, that’s not right. It sounded like many voices at once, overlapping and contradicting themselves. They echoed around my skull. And that’s when I died.



And then I woke up this morning. Checked my phone. It’s another Saturday.



And we’ve reached the present, which is right now on a Saturday morning at 7:48 am. It took me about an hour to get this all down because my hands are shaking so bad. I *need* to know what to do next, any advice would be appreciated. I don’t want Kasey to die. *I* don’t want to die. Please respond as soon as possible if you can. I’ll update you on the situation as it happens.
