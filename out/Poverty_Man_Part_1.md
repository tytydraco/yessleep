My name is Welmund Sterling. If that sounds familiar to you, that's unsurprising, as you've probably heard about my podcast.  


I give financial advice that could move you from the bottom of poverty to owning your own yacht within a month. Many of my underlings that have taken my course have become millionaires within a year. Of course, there's the people who refer to it as an MLM after failing to put the work in. Knowledge is useless without application afterall. That's my motto (I'm still working on getting it trademarked).  


Anyways, I'm here to document my latest project.  


I am going to move to an area where I'm unknown, have no connections, and start with only 500 dollars. I will not be allowed to use any of my assets of regular bank accounts. I will take handouts from no one.  


The goal? Become a millionaire within one month. You heard me. Now, I know that sounds outlandish to the average person, I didn't get to where I am now out of sheer luck.

Sometimes you just gotta think outside the box a little, and be willing to put the work in.  


I found an area that's known for having low-value residents, and moved into the shittiest apartment I could find. After getting the boys together and moving some furniture into the place to make it feel like home, I was ready to begin my new life as a normie.  


Day one:  


So here I am, sitting on the couch in this tiny ass apartment. I have $500 in my bank account, and no job. Where do I start?  


I suppose my first step would be getting a job, right? That's what most people would assume, but like I said, I didn't get to my level of status by thinking inside the box.  


The first thing I do is establish my first source of passive income. I immediately get on my laptop and start investing.

I put $250 into my fidelity account. Now, I know it seems like a huge risk to use half of my income like this, but you can't become successful without at least a little bit of risk.  


Do I do research on what stocks are predicted to do well? No. That's a rookie mistake. Any "news" you see is outdated, used to trick the ones who are too lazy to figure things out for themselves. By the time it reaches r/wallstreetbets, the intel is long since expired.  


What you wanna do is trust your own instincts. Instead of putting all my eggs in one basket, I diversify. I choose a broad assortment of stocks, and put $5 into each of them. That's 50 different stocks that could potentially rise in value.  


The remaining $250, I'll use to keep myself afloat until I find a job.  


I spent the next hour on Indeed applying to every available job within a five mile radius. If I work somewhere close by, I can save quite a bit of money on gas. Surprisingly, most people don't seem to have thought of this. How many people do you know who's commute to work is 30 minutes or more? Exactly. That's a lot of time and money wasted that you'll never get back.  


After waiting about five minutes to get a response from one of my applications, I realize it may take longer than I initially anticipated. I decide to go for a run in the meantime, both to keep my energy levels high and to keep my mind sharp.  


At some point I noticed a blocked path going into the woods somewhere. There's a makeshift wire barrier tied to the surrounding trees, blocking the path. Taped to the improvised obstacle are pieces of cardboard with various warnings on them.

Stuff like "danger", "turn back NOW", and etcetera. A man nearby made an exasperated sigh and took them down one by one.  


"What's this about?"  


I asked  


"This area is private property, but the actual owner doesn't mind people exploring the place since it used to be a public nature trail and all. There's no actual rule against going in, but nobody does anymore cause of these stupid signs."  


"It's not the owner putting those signs up?"  


"Nope, just some kid who keeps insisting there's a ghost in these woods. I talked to the owner, and apparently he doesn't even know the kid. He has no business trying to keep people out."  


"Ah, he probably wants the whole area to himself. Here, let me help you with that."  


After helping him untie the wire, I decided to go down the path and check the place out myself.  


Now, I don't believe in the paranormal, but what happened next I have no logical explanation for.  


Long story short, I came across a clearing at some point. There was a girl about my age standing dead center in the middle of it. She looked strangely transparent, like any cgi ghost you'd see in the movies, but as I walked closer she began to look more "solid".  


Maybe it was some kind of optical illusion, or just my mind playing tricks on me (happens often with high IQ people. Sometimes random ideas that aren't important enough to be stored will leak out in strange ways just to give your brain some more breathing room for more important matters).  


What happened next, however, was quite strange.  


"Are you alright?"  


I approach her initially out of concern. I'm not sure why she's just standing still in the middle of a field like that. I thought maybe she was high on something.  


"I've had better days."  


There was nothing particularly strange about her voice, demeanor, or appearance. Not that I could pick up on so far.  


"If it's not too personal, would you like to talk about whatever it is that's bothering you?"  


"Well, after years of searching and applying, I finally got a job that pays better than my old one. But so far nothing in my life has actually changed. The price of groceries has gotten high enough where I'm spending pretty much the same amount of my income on food that I was before.  


And now my car just decided this was the perfect time to have issues that needed to be fixed. Expensive ones. And of course I couldn't wait on that since I quite literally need my car to be able to work.  


And this isn't even the first time stuff like this has happened. One time I got a pretty good tax return and ended up having to spend it all on bills for a medical issue that decided to manifest right then and there.  


It seems like no matter what I do, there's always some unexpected expense, or some contrived twist of fate that forcefully keeps me at the same place financially. I'm tired. I just wanna catch a break for once."  


I was a bit taken aback by this rant. I've seen it many times online, albeit worded differently, but I never expected someone to say something this embarrassing face to face.  


"Look, if there always seems to be an issue that keeps you in poverty, and it's happened so many times like you said, then it's not just a coincidence. The common denominator here is you.  


If you can't plan ahead of time for disasters to strike, then you're not as deserving of moving up as you think you are.  


Have you noticed that each problem you've described to me is something that could be solved by having a savings account? If you have money saved up instead of immediately spending it all, then it wouldn't set you back so much whenever the universe supposedly decided to sabotage you, which I doubt is actually the case.  


Drop the victim mindset, start learning how to think longterm, and you'll start to see some actual change in your life. You're responsible for your own life, and nobody is coming to save you."  


Upon hearing this, she began to smirk condescendingly as if she knew something I didn't. Honestly, if I see her again after this, I can't wait to see the look on her face when the challenge is over and I reveal myself to be a multi-millionaire entrepreneur. Right now she thinks I'm just some random, but evidently she doesn't know good advice when she hears it.  


"Is that how you feel? Do you think external circumstances play no part in the direction my life is going? I do put my money into savings, and I have burned through my entire savings account every time a disaster has happened, and it still wasn't enough.  


The most I can manage getting into savings before needing to use it is about $200. I can usually only afford to put in about $15 a day if I strategize good enough. There's only a finite amount of hours I can work in a day. If it was just a matter of hard work and budgeting, I'd be a billionaire by now."  


She responded. I couldn't help but laugh.  


"If your issue is that you can't possibly make enough at your job, and you somehow can't find a better one after a whole year, then what's stopping you from starting your own business?"  


"Let's say I did have the time and energy to start a whole business while working both of my part time jobs. Setting aside enough money to start it in the first place would take a year at the very least. Assuming nothing happens that would cause me to use that money for emergencies-"  


"See right off the bat, you're coming up with all these scenarios and reasons why it wouldn't work before you've even attempted it. There's always an excuse. Your mindset is clearly the issue here. I started my empire with nothing, and I'm in the process of doing it again."  


"Nothing? Nothing but the money given to you by your parents Janine and Earl?"  


Now I knew something was up. Somehow, my personal info has been leaked, and my current whereabouts were doxed. Instead of reacting, I remained calm and effortlessly deconstructed her argument, unfazed.  


"This might be hard for you to warp your head around, but my parents didn't just give me handouts all my life. Their money was theirs, not mine. I was taught how to create my own value instead of mooching off them.  


Did they help me kickstart my first business? Sure, but that was only after I proved myself to them. They're the types who only help people who are capable of helping themselves. They knew I could make the money on my own, but decided to invest in me to speed up the process. The only real difference it made was the amount of time it would've taken otherwise."  


"Mhm. I see. And this current challenge or project you're doing, it's to prove to everyone that you could've done it without their help, right?"  


"That's right. Once you see what I'm capable of on my own, you'll have absolutely no excuses left to hide behind. Next month, go ahead and look up 'Welmundvlog episode 49: 30 day poverty challenge' and see the whole thing get documented. It's gonna show the world once and for all that you have absolutely no excuses."  


"Ok then, I'll be watching. Good luck."  


I was already walking away, as I quite literally couldn't afford to waste my time conversing with low-value wage slaves.  


It was pretty dark out, and considering the fact I had apparently been doxed, I figured I should Uber home just to be safe. After getting home, I ordered a pizza and some drinks.  


I checked my bank account. $198 left. Not bad. You really don't need to spend all that much in a day, do you?  


Surprisingly, I didn't get any responses to my Indeed applications yet. Probably cause it was a Saturday.  


For my safety, I decided to get a security system installed. I didn't use my project bank account to pay for this, as it would be too expensive and wasn't relevant to the challenge. This was just a necessary precautionary measure so I wouldn't have to move or cancel the challenge altogether.  


For some reason, I couldn't log into my regular bank account. After calling the bank, they claimed my name wasn't populating in their system. Weird.  


I tried my other two banks and they said the same thing. I tried calling some of my friends to help me out, but for some reason they weren't in my contacts anymore, which sucked since I didn't have any of their numbers memorized.  


It was by that point I realized this wasn't a coincidence. Something fishy was going on. The doxing, the missing bank information, the missing contacts. Could that girl from the woods have something to do with this?  


Frustrated, I threw my phone at the wall and began to pace back and forth, thinking of what my next move should be. When I saw my phone on the ground with a cracked screen protector, I realized this was the only tool I had for finding my way back home. Throwing it like that was not a good idea. I didn't remember the way back, so I would need to use GPS.  


Thankfully, it just turned out to be the screen protector that was damaged.  


I got in my car and unlocked my phone. The second I did, I realized my screensaver had changed. After peeling off the cracked screen protector, I realized it was a picture of me taken from just outside my apartment window. It was a picture of me throwing my phone as the wall, which happened only minutes ago.  


Immediately, I hauled ass and drove the hell out of there. The challenge would have to be postponed.  


After a few hours of being lost in the sauce, I somehow managed to go in a complete circle and end up right back at my new apartment. At that point, I just decided to call it a day and go inside.  


I'm quite proficient in various forms of martial arts, so I'm not too worried about the people who are after me. In any case, I decided I may as well continue the challenge until a concerned friend finally attempts to contact me.  


I'll be back with an update soon. Stay motivated y'all, and remember, knowledge is useless without application. Peace.
