Did anyone else used to read [Madame Mother?](https://imgur.com/a/hwruqei)

It was this old mommy blog from the 2000s. I started reading it when I had my first son and, parasocially, I saw Madame Mother as his e-godmother. She was gospel to me. Every week the neighborhood mother’s group would be excited to discuss her latest updates. We even joined Madame Mother’s Facebook group, which was essentially a little fanclub/support group where mothers across the country could confide in each other their most tightly kept fears and experiences. It was an invaluable resource that even helped me navigate the bowels of my own divorce. It was the first internet community I was ever really immersed in and it holds a special place in my memories of raising my two sons.

I stopped keeping up with Madame Mother around the mid 2010s. Madame’s daughter had gone off to college so the blog had to reinvent itself. It became about recipes, interior decorating, and other miscellaneous lifestyle content. I still adored her, the blog just wasn’t really relevant to me anymore. That is until I decided to revisit it recently on a nostalgic whim.

She abruptly stopped posting in 2017. I couldn’t find any posts or announcements saying why, the blog just stopped. I decided to check back in with what was left of the old Facebook group and the ladies there shared [**this article**](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/mommy-blogger-found-dead/386660/) with me.

“Woman found dead inside sewer tunnels after reported missing last year.”

Unfortunately, it aligns pretty well with what I knew about Madame Mother. She was a widow with a college-aged daughter who lived in the Bay Area. The article is from 2018 too. Her real name was Liza Winslow. Holy shit.

I didn’t have much luck finding more info on the circumstances of her death, but admittedly I’m far from tech savvy myself. Hopefully, I can get one of my sons to do some digging for me next time they come over for dinner.

I read her last few entries to see if there was any mention of illness, or injury, or something that could explain away her seemingly sudden death. And while I didn’t find that, these last few posts proved unsettling in an entirely different way.

Going to post them here to see what you all think while I try to mine for more clues. This whole discovery has upset me terribly and I think it’d bring me a little more peace to know what exactly happened to her.

# Madame Mother’s Musings on Motherly Midnight Miseries

Ladies, I know I promised I’d share my latest invention this week, the coveted Black Sesame Swirled Cupcakes with Chili Crisp Cream Cheese Frosting recipe, but please, allow me a slight extension. Craving mothers and lovers of sugary multi-cultural flavor fusions, lay down your pitchforks. I can explain. Madame Mother wishes to try her hand at something profound this week. I’d like to talk to you all a little about dreams. Last night I had a very strange one, at least I think I did. I’ll explain what that means in a moment. For now, I’ll let you hear about the dream as transcribed from the moleskin diary I keep at my bedside. Enjoy.

>*Her daughter’s face; a swelling shape of monstrous black static in the corner of the mother’s bedroom. Digital noise, a warping darkness that carried the immensity of every possible creeping death, that took shape of her. Her daughter. Standing at the mother’s feet now, infant eyes boring through the dark, that look of endless wanting. That filthy, sapping neediness that tugged at the mother’s buzzing nerves, that pinned her to the bed with a burning paresthesia. Her daughter was scared, her daughter was hungry, her daughter couldn’t sleep. Never sated, never still, and now she had come to take everything. She slithered upon the mother, breathing mouthy and hot, a damp wetness that steamed the mother’s cheek. That mouth stretching and slobbering, slimy teeth joined in stalactites of spit, whose whiteness shot out from the darkness, severely recognizable amidst the undulating visual noise. Her daughter’s eyes, still so tiny, gleamed like obsidian. They darted and slowed. Feebly, they attempted to hold the image of the mother’s face, but would quickly fall from focus, like a baby new to its senses. But then they would shine in a moment of sober knowing, and she was no longer mother’s baby but something that, if the mother could unpin herself, she would strangle and pound, and would feel nothing about it at all. But the daughter, still hungry, still yearning, leaned her face down to the mother’s and opened it wide. And the mother looked in terror past the teeth, past the throbbing, prismatic insides, into a deeper, unmoving darkness. And she knew that she would never be anything ever again besides a heap of half formed something at the bottom of her daughter’s being.*

>*And it smelled like stomach acid.*

What an awful poem! I can’t believe I wrote this. Really, I don’t remember doing it. I discovered it this morning while trying to write about a disgustingly ordinary dream I had about being naked at the Whole Foods (I have these weekly). The lettering is almost illegible. It’s uncharacteristically chicken scratch coming from my hand. I must’ve written it half asleep. However, writing in the third person is most strange. My unconscious mind must fancy herself a little artist. To the non-mothers who come across this blog, this occurrence may seem a little intense or foreboding, but something like this is really par for the course for any nervous mother.

I remember when I was pregnant with my daughter, Ophelia, I was plagued with a whole laundry list of awful visions and dreams. It was a high risk pregnancy. I had miscarried twice before (you can find my post detailing that whole tragedy **here**) and my doctor had told me that Ophelia would fall right out if there wasn’t drastic medical intervention. My other two, also girls, were to be named Josephine and Juliet. Two beautiful girls that I wanted so badly. They were supposed to be the loves of my life and they ended as bits of black meat in the palm of my hand. I couldn’t bear to lose Ophelia too. So, they belted me to a table, held me upside down, and for two hours they sewed my cervix shut while blood pooled behind my eyes and threatened to pop them out of my head. And I cried from how badly my head ached and how my lungs burned from the effort of breathing. I thought they would let me die on that table. But I would do anything, anything at all for Ophelia to live.

Throughout the pregnancy, I suffered from bouts of sleep paralysis, or paresthesia, the medical term I became intimately familiar with in the following years. I can’t remember them all now, but there was a recurring one that feels relevant to the recent dream. It’s night, I’m laying in bed, and Ophelia has burst out from the sutures in a flood of hot blood that had begun to congeal under me. I try to check on her. I need to know if she’s okay. I need to know if she’s come out in chunks like her sisters. But I’ve lost too much blood or something because I can’t lift my head and I can hardly even look ahead without my eyes rolling back into darkness. Though I manage to see Ophelia. She’s in one piece and much bigger than she ought to be. She crawls up my belly with her tiny, tiny fists. In her mouth she holds some bright, pink meat and it takes me a long second to realize what she’s got in her mouth is some type of tubing she’s taken from me, could’ve been intestinal or fallopian, and she’s chewing toothlessly on it like a dog taunting you to try and grab its new toy. That’s when I realize that during her escape, she had taken much of me with her. I’m all strewn about between my legs and I was left with a great sunkenness in my stomach where it had all just been. Ophelia had disemboweled me upon birth. But how could I care all that much when I saw her alive and eating right there? All I could feel were waves and waves of enormous relief. Then I’d wake up.

I’d awake still in the same bed, still pregnant, and still frozen, but then it was because I was so afraid of all the gore that my body contained. During these kinds of nights, I’d spend the rest of them laying completely still, for fear of my own body, which had suddenly become completely alien to me. Eventually dawn would break and my husband would stir and he’d comfort me and remind me that I am a person. There is more to me than the invisible will of my flesh. Or so I try to tell myself. After going through something like what I did with Ophelia, it seems delusional to keep thinking of my body and mind as something I could ever master, let alone understand. I just don’t have that luxury anymore.

Maybe that’s why this new mysterious entry doesn’t bother me. I have been a nervous mother as of late. My most devout readers know that Ophelia is graduating from college soon, in a couple of days, actually. Serendipitously, it happens to fall on Mother’s Day. What a gift. I should be excited and I am, really. Honestly, I just have no idea if she can survive being out of school. Ophelia is graduating with an MA in Philosophy. Please, try not to scoff. If I tried to convince her to pursue anything else I’d be a major hypocrite. I graduated a Lit major after all. Sometimes, I just wish she wasn’t so damn like me. I hate to sound even remotely conservative but, regrettably, age and children make you practical. She thinks she’s going to become a shepherd in France. I’m just hoping it’s possible for her to move out of my house. Tenured teaching positions at colleges aren’t as easy to come by as they were in the past. She could write books, but the life of a writer is lonely and uncertain. I’d know. You could afford to follow your dreams in the 70s, 80s, hell, even the 90s. But things are tougher than they used to be. Well, now I sound like my own damn mom. Don’t you hate when that happens? Still, I shudder to think of Ophelia being starved into working some awful HR position. She doesn’t do well with boredom and I think something like writing emails and attending meetings for a living would bring her to murder. It’s all been a lot to worry about. So it makes sense to me that reconstitutions of old nightmares have begun to resurface. My girl is growing fast out of my hands and I guess something in me hasn’t quite figured out how to cope with that.

Though, I’d be lying if I said it was just the graduation that had me a little concerned. A couple weeks ago, at the end of my daughter’s final semester, she sent me the thesis paper she had been working on for over a year. It was enormous, something like 300 pages. She’s an obsessive, always has been. Truthfully, I just started reading it today. Don’t tell my daughter. She’s smart, but it’s hard to take someone’s ideas seriously when you’ve seen just how long it took them to figure out how to stop crapping themselves. But after discovering the journal entry this morning, I felt compelled to check up on what was going on in her head. I didn’t expect to find it so disturbing.

I always make a conscious effort to honor the privacy of myself and my family. Dear reader, I'm sorry, but Madam Mother is not my real name. Over the years, I’ve shared with you many unspeakable things, things that are largely uncharacteristic to the Mommy Blog archetype (postpartum depression, my husband’s death, my daughter’s illness, etc.) because I feel it's my responsibility to create a valuable resource to mothers who are looking to be spoken to truthfully. Motherhood is a life-altering experience. There’s lots of beauty, superhuman feelings of love, spiritual fulfillment, whatever. But these things are also accompanied in equal parts discomfort and straight up existential misery. All I can hope for is that my honesty about my hardships might help you rationalize some of yours. So, with that being said, I’m going to give some deep backstory on Ophelia’s childhood that’ll add needed context to this thesis that’s got me so worried for her.

Truthfully, Ophelia has always been a creepy kid. I don’t mean this in insult, I always thought she was very cool. She was different. She was quiet, observant, thoughtful, she had the disposition of an artist. But sometimes you’d wake up in the middle of the night and she’d be breathing on you five inches from your face and, yeah, she was a little scary. She was just being a kid though. Most of the time, she just wanted you to go to the bathroom with her because she was scared. Nothing unusual about that.

There was of course her epilepsy, which through no fault of her own, scared the shit out me. I’ve talked about it here before, but Ophelia’s seizures used to be pretty dramatic, especially when she was younger. Dead things tended to set her off. Some accidental glimpse of roadkill or a fallen bird would cause her to fall ill with grief. It embarrasses me now to think of how many times I went stiff with terror during her fits. I’d see my sweet girl go from singing and dancing along to the Wiggles, to violently thrashing and gurgling, possessed by something I couldn’t possibly exorcise. Thank God for my husband’s cool head. With time, her bouts became less threateningly alien to my eyes. My nerves steeled and I could readily replace my husband’s steady hand when he departed from us. Though sometimes, during a seizure or spasmodic night terror she’d cry out some ominous word or phrase and I’d shiver wondering what sort of psychedelic visions she was being seized by behind those upturned eyes.

When she got older, around her turning seven, she started displaying some very strange ideas. While I was putting away her laundry, I found a journal tucked way back in her sock drawer. In a regrettable invasion of her privacy, I read through it. What I found, I guess you could call it an essay, but more aptly put the book contained a manic scribble of scattered musings on Plato’s Allegory of the Cave of all things. Ophelia’s always been a spongy sort of kid, but this was far beyond anything she would’ve heard of at school or from our home library. I was impressed but also, I think it’s always a spooky thing when your daughter begins taking an interest in “dialectics”.

For those uninitiated, Plato conjured up this model as a critique on the “sheeple” or why supposedly most people spend their lives being so small-minded. Imagine there are some gentlemen sitting in a cave and they are chained in place so they are forced to stare at the cave wall. On the wall there are hypnotic dancing shadows that tell the people of the world and how it is. They believe the shadows and the world they are told about without experiencing it for themselves while, unbeknownst to them, a fire rages behind them and tyrants project these images and espouse these teachings. The only man who really knows anything about the world, is the one who decides to leave the cave. Wherever she got it from, her diary suggested that she got stuck on the idea of her reality being outside of her control. She believed her thoughts were not her own.

On a regular trip to the community pool I saw her talking to some older kids, a couple of teenagers who looked to be dating. They seemed amused by her and I didn’t think anything was wrong necessarily, but the younger they are, the more you worry about them. Whether it's warranted or not. So, I discreetly pulled up one of those sticky, plastic pool chairs, the ones that leave the attractive gashes across your back, and I eavesdropped on them for a bit. They were asking her what she thought about life, how her experience of it was so far, and what she thought it all meant. I think they just meant to make fun of her but she was enthralled by their questions nonetheless.

“Do you hear the man who tells you what to think?”

I distinctly remember her asking them that. Who was she talking about? A teacher? It seemed unlikely. Maybe she was trying to impress these kids in some backwards way? But she sounded so earnest. It gave me the creeps. Of course, the teenagers just laughed it off.

They told her no, they didn’t hear the man. Who was he?

“Inside my head, I watch myself and he watches me. I do things but it’s not really me. I’m alive but I’m not the one living. I’m just watching. I’m watching with him.”

Years passed. Then she was nine. Her teacher called me in for a conference. Apparently, Ophelia was a gifted writer, the best in her class. But the subjects she chose for her writing were troubling, to say the least. The prompt would be: Write a story about what you would do if you found a dinosaur in your backyard. Well, Ophelia wrote about how she would brutalize the dinosaur with a kitchen knife, realize she had actually killed the neighbor in the midst of a psychotic episode, and then, being driven mad with guilt, would kill herself with the same knife. (Note: apparently the story was so good, she was asked to read it in front of the class! I love being a proud mama!)

Everyone chalked that story up to my daughter having a superb imagination. But, it got worse. Prompt: Write about a time you visited a haunted house. Ophelia’s story: A group of amateur paranormal investigators stomp around some creepy old manor until each one is picked off and snuffed out by demons via increasingly violent death scenes. Think– impalings, choking on lungs stuffed with hair, eyes getting torn out, I think one poor girl even got her insides liquified while nailed to some blood-drawn pentagram. And then, a twist!

>*Reader, you are probably thinking to yourself, “If all of them died then who is telling this story?” It is a very good question. I am the Devil. I have come to warn you. Think twice before walking into houses that you are not invited to. It could always be mine. My guests are very funny but the joke will be on you.*

So clever! She could write for Blumhouse.

Her teacher suggested therapy. Now I know that these days everyone’s treating therapy like it’s the be-all and end-all solution to all feelings of angst or badness that come with being human, but as you can tell by my snark, I don’t really buy it. At least not for my daughter. Ophelia was a great student, she had friends, she was, all things considering, a very happy kid. Her father died when she was three, of course she’s going to turn out a little peculiar. I didn’t want her to feel different. She was eccentric. So what?

So, she’s grown now. Without my consent, she’s become a woman. All signs of her childhood hauntedness have been sanded down to a narrow, intelligent look about her. Or so I thought. I figured that somewhere along her growth, she had naturally leveled out and ditched her strange ideas much in the same way another child might grow out of playing with dolls or talking to imaginary friends. Now I realize she had just gotten better at keeping her thoughts to herself.

Back to the paper. My daughter’s philosophy thesis is not so much a model research paper with an argument on the first page and a compendium of references to back it. It’s a didactic novel. Whatever philosophy you’re supposed to glean from this, it’s delivered within a narrative via conflicts and characters. Well, conflict is a strong word, since her novel is mostly just one character assaulting the reader with endless ramblings.

Our protagonist is some lily-white, Victorian waif who floats from one end of her sprawling mansion to the other. She is wealthy, but in a boring sort of way. Her mother died in illness (which I was of course offended by), her father is immersed in his trade, and our girl, aptly called Pigeon, is supervised by no one but a withered, old governess. Probably by some product of extreme boredom, she takes to sneaking out at night to lurk in the shadows of seedy, seaside taverns and listen to the stories of the gruff folk who frequent them. She’s become a little more than obsessed with the lives of these men, but I’ll let you see for yourself in this excerpt:

>*At first, they kept themselves guarded in the way men do in the company of women. But my continued presence and placid reactions to their flint-sharp words and offensive tastes soon earned something of a trust between us. It was agreed that I would be treated as a mute. I was wholly dysfunctional as a woman but the men found me to be an adequate piece of décor. I became as much of a fixture of the tavern as the spiced smoke that hung above the bar and smothered the chipped gilt of the aged chandeliers, as endemic to the place as the waterlogged planks that sank underfoot like lichen. Acknowledgement of me withered to polite nods in greeting and sometimes, when the booze softened their manners, I would receive that dangerous wet look, and I knew it was time to take my leave and seek another tavern, another night, another life to steal for myself.*

>*The sailors were always simple. I listened to their tales of bracing against the hot cyclones of the Caribbean isles, of salt-stung eyes and rum-burnt chests, of women who smelled of cumin and bay leaves, who offered their beds to the most leathered of seamen. They only knew love from their evenings spent on shore. They sang in their hearts the words they had learned as boys, off worn and sanded disks that danced on their mothers’ gramophones. They could finally live in those old sonnets. Enchanting prose of profound relief: the relief of intimacy, the wholeness wrought by the gaze of a wanting woman. All at once their lonesome life at sea is distant, its only memory lingering in the coolness of their sweat slicked bodies and on their saltwater kisses, which would cling to the men’s mustaches for weeks after. But by morning the incense and perfume would ferment into something sharp and chemical, more cinnamaldehyde than cinnamon. The woman would be gone, off on her own life, and it was all just another night. But for the sailors of the tavern, these intermittent entanglements shone like stars, guiding them through the sameness of the ocean’s endless twilight. Stray romances become a traveler’s only home.*

>*After some experience, I had found men with particularly striking stories that became my favorites to hear. There was the French officer who made his living manning the lever of his town’s guillotine. He gave many years to the profession and only quit when he was tasked with the capitol killing of a young woman charged with infanticide. She was poverty-stricken, of gaunt frame, and clearly under the grim effects of consumption. There were rumors that she was bound for the altar but was abandoned on some roadside out of town, where after months of suffering from an unbearable shame, she found herself beneath the shrieking monster of the guillotine. The French officer will swear by her guilt but the heaviness of his drink always suggested otherwise to me.*

>*There was the Danish shepherd, who had married the love of his life when he was only a teen. They had come in search of better climate, to alleviate her illness, but the upheaval proved too difficult for her sickly constitution, and he was left alone with his sheep. He became a good friend to the women and children in town and would use his meager earnings to offer them candy whenever he could. He’d even save peppermints for me, the mute. But sometimes, when the tavern was long steeped in nighttime and the Dane’s mugs surrounded him on all sides like a crystal forest, he would fall so ill with resentment, he’d storm off towards the blackened sea. Then, he would not be seen for days after. The women would take turns caring for his herd until his return, upon which his gratitude was so charming, the women never found the effort to be a bother. Once, during one of his disappearances, I found him on the beach covered in lash marks, painfully purging his wounds in the ocean, his smallness hardly able to break the waves of the Celtic Sea.*

>*I am not charming. I am not handsome. My manners are suitable and my talents are plain at best. But, I have my gift. I listen closely, searing each one of their words into the essential memory of my being. Their lives become more me than anything I’d ever lived myself. I became overcome by an insatiable longing to act in the world, to love only with the most grotesque desperation and be maimed by that love. I wished to be one with the sailors who wore their loneliness like a cripple’s cane, or with the Frenchman haunted by that moribund beauty extinguished by his hand, or with the Dane that would surely destroy the world that took his wife, if he could only escape his own meager body. I wanted to be them all. Alas, womanhood is but a congenital failure. I am merely a fragment of marrow, torn from the heart of man and cast in his darkness. From his shadow, I earn his pity and am rewarded with the whispers of the world.*

Already, I disapprove. “Womanhood is but a congenital failure.” Why is my daughter talking like one of those “incel” boys from the forums? My diagnosis: she’s been single for too long. I haven’t been introduced to a boyfriend (or girlfriend or partner, I’ll take whatever) since high school. Shutting herself in her dorm to write self-loathing manifestos isn’t helping, I’m sure.

Besides that, there’s nothing especially disturbing in this section, just a collegiate understanding of old world angst. Then, on one of her nightly outings, Pigeon meets a playwright. His presence at the tavern is immediately striking, considering he’s an outright psychosexual freak amidst all the leather-skinned common freaks that are indigenous to this dusty place. He’s a natural demagogue, filling the tavern with images of the magnetic insanity from the days of antiquity. He speaks to the men of Hellenistic blood orgies, debaucherous Renaissance carnivals, parades of crossdressers and rampant animal sacrifice, (sounds like a night at the Margaritaville!) and so on. The men listen to the Godless writer for a long while, not seriously, but amused by his guiltless taste for sensual pleasures. For a small coastal town of wooden churches and quiet civility, they were happy to hear that their calloused lives were actually quite innocent in comparison to the man’s wild imaginings of history.

Pigeon, however, is not so pleased with him. To her, he was hijacking her voyeuristic hobby with his narcissism, conflating the experiences of men who’ve actually lived with his own empty posturings. She goes to leave, but is intercepted by him. He introduces himself to her as Lord Vesper Gower. Seeing her resistance to him, he begins to dress her up and down, in a brutal dismantling of her character.

>*He looked at me as one studies themselves in the mirror. He was searching, trying to find in me some spark of soul, some definite character. But as with one’s self, he was only met with a dark and vicious nothing. When he spoke, he did so as an accuser and judge. Everything was spoken with the plainness of fact.*

>*“You find me repulsive, don’t you? And why shouldn’t you? You’re correct. I am an ugly man. I preach the humanist detritus of the old world, I do. I say we are only made whole by affirming our nascent proclivities for violence and infidelity, that mankind can only truly be understood by its fallenness from God’s grace. So, rejoice! Rejoice when you have an encounter with the maenad’s kiss! Rejoice when your senses should leave you in a fever of feral pleasures! But should you covet my woman or injure me too harshly during the Bacchanalia’s dance, then I would not hesitate to drag you into a dandy’s court and allow the state to sentence you for your crimes against decency! I will gleefully brand you with the stigmata of savage, unsightly, and degenerate.*

>*Yes, I am a fraud! My religion is the honesty laid bare by human debauchery but, to me, their is only virtue in my own comfort. You should know it best, my little bird. I see you quivering all over like a white Narcissus. You see I know you better than you know your own heart and you can’t bear the shame! You sit there, a mute, a common chicklet, all curled in on yourself atop a nest woven from the myths of others. You haven’t a single characteristic of your own! And you sneer at me still. You have been domesticated by the anodynes of a paved earth, same as me. You know that. That’s why it’s vital that you come here to syphon the woes of others. But alas, ‘with individuation there is no vicarious atonement.’ Now I’ve forgotten who wrote that…*

>*Nevermind that. There is only one profession for one as barren of humanity as you! Acting! So it is fortunate for you that I am a playwright. You wish to eat from the fruit of Sodom yourself? Then be my conduit and me your Adonis. Nurture me with your blood and I will make you truly beautiful. Or continue on as a spiritual cuckold!”*

>*At this, he laughed himself into hysterics. The tavern had long since quieted to watch us. Very suddenly, his howling ceased. Our eyes met. He bent over and kissed me.*

>*So quickly had the boundary between us evaporated, I swore I had been hit with a canon. I felt a senseless, nauseous heat that tore me apart like a comet crumbling upon crossing the noxious mesosphere of Venus. Like a lamb upon the altar, I was gutted before the clergymen of the tavern. As his hands slid down my back, I felt myself become reforged in his image. We became of one body, bound by the connective fibers of spit, fused like the ouroboros, consumed by a carnal, cannibalistic desire. It was impossible to know whether the sounds that erupted from our union were mine or his. At once I understood the desperation of the sailors, the French officer’s guilt, the widower’s vengeful grief. This was it, the root of all wickedness. And it was obvious to me why knowledge got men cast out of heaven.*

>*Somehow, I made it home. I can’t remember it now. My moments alone have become entirely too unimportant to hold on to. All I know is the image that scorched itself on to the blacks of my eyelids and made itself known in every dark and salty crevice in town. The look on Lord Vesper’s face after our kiss, beholding me with something far softer than ubiquitous lust. That look that made our separation so excruciatingly palpable, I wanted to gouge out his eyes right there. And this vision is accompanied by a sound, something like the low rumble of tropic thunder.*

>*“You have never looked more beautiful.”*

>*The more I thought of him, the more I hated him, the more I knew I’d do exactly as he said. I’d allow him to compel my every thought and action. And I was never alone in my mind again.*

I went cold when I read this. “I’d allow him to compel my every thought and action*.” “*The man who tells you what to think.” I know, I know. My daughter’s got a special mind. This schizophrenic-adjacent idea could be some metaphor I’m not understanding or some obscure personal symbology. But against all reason I found myself queasy with worry, stuck to my desk like a scared animal. It was the same feeling I had whenever Ophelia would begin to seize and scream all those strange things.

“Don’t look at me! Please, don’t look at me!”

It’s a terrible thing for a mother to realize her daughter is a complete stranger. Despite being there her whole life, I don’t even really understand it.

Thank God I’m seeing her soon. That graduation is only two days away after all. Once I’m there I’ll be able to get a better temperature on her, see what she thinks of the whole thing, and I’m sure my fears will be put to bed. Then, I’ll finally have the peace of mind to put together that long awaited recipe for you all.

Until then, don’t forget to recharge your pussy power with a glass of wine and while you’re at it, call up your friends and get them to read this blog! Lord knows I need all the strength and mommy muscle I can get. Madame Mother wishes you all good health, rest, and great sex.

***Yours ever,***

***Madame Mother***
