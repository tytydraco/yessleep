With the rise in consumerism over the years products have been in an ongoing race to match up to the expectations of the masses. Products are rapidly created to reflect present trends with previous ones subsequently being dropped out of the disinterest of the makers or simply due to there no longer being a demand. What people don’t consider is what goes on behind the scenes of how their parcel magically appears at their front doorstep removing the need for them to leave the house. I am one such pawn in the ever-adapting chessboard of production and shipment. I am a warehouse operative, and this is my experience of narrowly avoiding being swallowed whole.

 

My job can be briefly summed up as scanning orders, receiving the location of products on the scanner, finding the products and collecting them, putting them in a box, and shipping them off. Not a lot to it but some technicalities come with the job. I don’t know if they are in any way related to my experience but for the sake of my sanity, I will explain here in the hope that someone can effectively elevate me of my paranoia. In the warehouse, we have **18 aisles**. These are labelled from **A- R** with aisle 1 being A and aisle 18 being R. The middle aisles I leave to you. When we receive the location for each product the scanner will provide a prompt such as **L**A **L**01 **P** 01. The first L in this prompt stands for the location of which aisle the product is in, the second L stands for the level in which there are **5 per aisle**, and P is the position in which there **are 23 per aisle**. In the case of **L**A **L**01 **P**01 this would mean the product is in aisle A level 1 position 1, right at the entrance of the aisle and low enough to where you would have to duck your head a little. The only prompt that appears that is outside of this logic is **L**X **L**01 **P**05. This prompt means the product is on the warehouse floor somewhere and has likely been dropped down by someone on a high racker as any level above 2 is unreachable.

 

Now you are all scholars in warehouse jargon I will recount the events that followed the order that made me quit my job. The order that still haunts me, is order 2100. It was like any other Monday morning. Shaking off the banging headache deserved for the previous night down at the pub, coffee in hand and a stack of orders already at my station. It's not uncommon not to see anybody at the beginning of the shift. This is for two reasons, the first is that people are surprisingly not eager to arrive early to a warehouse job, and second, people tend to begin orders as soon as they come and won’t ask for help from anyone unless there is a product out of reach like I mentioned earlier. I wish I had seen someone that morning… face to face. Maybe if I had this wouldn’t have played with my mind so much.

 

My first two orders were simple. The first was an order for three dolls and a pink toy car to go alongside and the second was for a new state-of-the-art gaming laptop. Our warehouse has a lot of ties with various companies and so the products which we ship tend to be an amalgamation of genre and type, electronic or not. Then came order 2100. The order was blank. I thought that maybe it was a problem with the ink in the printer, but it couldn’t have been since everything else about how our orders looked was the same. The date was in the top left, the shipment time in the bottom right and the barcode in the top right. No address was attached. I didn’t think it was necessary to speak to my boss about it since I could simply scan the barcode, collect the products, and then press **command T** to print the shipment papers which includes the address on anyway. I had a lot of orders to do that day so my best judgment told me to finish the order and make a note of the products and address on the order receipt so they could be logged by my boss as being completed.

 

I placed the order down, picked up my scanner, and scanned the bar code the pleasant beep stirring to life from the machine. The order of missing segments on paper was strange but I assume not completely out of the realm of reason, but what appeared on my scanner was impossible. None of the products were listed. Where the products should be was rather the dark abyss that backgrounded anything that was inputted on the scanner. What there was, however, was the subsequent locations for where these nothingness orders were.  The first location was simple enough, **LA L01 P01.** I walked over to my trolley and placed a large box on top as I was unsure how many products I would need to get. LA L01 P01, a stack of A4 paper. Simple enough but it must have been sat there for a while since there was a thick coating of dust. Now this isn’t unheard of in a warehouse but a product this close to the main floor would usually be seen and taken care of within seconds to avoid being marked down by inspectors. Taking initiative I walked back to my station grabbed a cloth and cleared the dust. Due to the scanner only telling me the location I was unsure how many products were needed and so I only grabbed one. In a field like ours, a mistake in quantity could mean hundreds in lost profit if oversupplied.

 

Location 2, **LD L02 P06.** The squeaking of my trolley as the loose wheel struggled across the floor doing more harm than good to my headache, I ditched it completely at the entrance to aisle D and walked down to collect the product. We’ve been having some bad storms lately, so thunder overhead and the ugly whistle created by the numerous cracks in the warehouse’s infrastructure were some of the many tortures we had to endure. The storm that day was worse than any we had, had that far. Mystery product number two was ironically a handheld fan. I chuckled to myself admittedly thinking that whoever **ordered 2100** was, would be certainly going somewhere a lot nicer than here. When I reached the entrance of aisle D however, my trolley was gone. I shrugged it off thinking maybe someone had mistaken it as theirs but why hadn’t I heard it squeak as it had been pulled away? At that point I didn’t think much about this question, likely due to all the noise the storm was making but this question would be stuck in my mind on repeat as I progressed through the order.  I walked back to my station and placed the fan on my desk certain that I would come across my trolley again at some point.

 

Location 3, **LC L01 P23**. As I entered the aisle of C I felt the pressure of my headache begin to expand into various regions of my body. With each step I took down the aisle my stomach delved deeper and deeper into the depths of pain exploring new-found territory I didn’t think capable. My feet dragged behind one another as I placed one in front of the other and my knees began to buckle slightly. By position 18 I was completely down to my hands and knees, one hand clutching my stomach in a desperate attempt to alleviate the waves of griping pain that came over me. I think the roof has taken a serious beating from the storms one after the other after the other as water started to seep through, creating the beginning of what would become a waterfall of downpour from above. As I entered the zone of position 23 my body had given up on me. A face full of rainwater, my limbs arranged like a ragdoll someone had finished playing with. All strength had left my body.

 

“Anyone! Please! Please help!"

 

I screamed as loud as I could, but I knew even then that no one would come. I was drained. A useless pile of skin and bone tucked into the shadows unable to even lift my head enough to make sure what I said wouldn’t just be a mumbled groan. Someone walked past the entrance to the aisle. I only saw the left side of them though, I was too far away to distinguish any features I could recognise as any of my coworkers, but the trademark vibrant orange vest was a dead giveaway. I tried again to shout.

 

“Hey! Hey! Please! Help! Help! Help me!”

 

No one came to my rescue. I wouldn’t be abandoned, mustering as much strength as I could I rolled onto my elbows blindly grabbing a product from the shelf and inch by inch minute by minute shuffled myself out of the aisle. When I reached the end, I was strong enough to kneel.

 

“Hey!  What the hell was that about?!”

 

I was enraged, but the figure was gone. Standing to my feet I walked along the aisles taking small steps at a time.

 

“Hey! Hello!  Hello… is anyone here?”

 

The figure was gone yes but so was everyone else. Everything else beforehand I have managed in some way to logically explain but I still don’t have an answer for this.  Looking down in my hand at the prize for my resilience I found a family-sized multipack of sweets. Totally not worth it. Defeated and still panting I returned to my station and placed the sweets on my desk alongside the fan. I decided then and there I would complete the order and then leave for the day as I was clearly unfit to continue. My quote-on-quote friends would certainly be getting an earful the next time I saw them.

 

Location 4, **LQ L02 P15.** My headache by this point started to resemble something more like a fever as I started to have hot flushes periodically that made me break out in a sweat, yet I was still adamant about completing the order as to not dampen my reputation as being one “to leave a job halfway done”. The entrance to aisle Q. I don’t know what it was that made me stop there so suddenly but I felt as if I was being watched. Remaining at the entrance I turned my head to the right. Nothing but my workstation which is starting to feel like a sanctuary to me. When I turned my head to the left, however, the figure was back this time with the back of their head facing me as they walked in the opposite direction.

 

“Hel- “

 

*\*squeak\**            

 

Spinning my head back to the right my trolley was back within arm’s reach. Startled I spun my head back to the left only to find the figure gone again, sending a shiver down my spine. I’ve never had any vendetta towards my colleagues and was even friendly enough with them to invite them to my wedding a year back, but now they were beginning to become a source of fear that I no longer wished to encounter for as long as this order were to last. Dragging the trolley down the aisle the fever grew with intensity, beads of sweat trickling down my back and leaving a trail clearly indicating where I’d been. The product was a genuine leather wallet. Ever since I was young, I always wanted a wallet like that. With both my Grandad and Dad having one just like it, young me believed that the day I owned a leather wallet was the day I became a man. I don’t know why I never bought one but with the pressure of bills piling up and new priorities stepping into my life like my partner, kid, and job it forever remained as something to get around to. I picked up the wallet and placed it in the box on the trolley.

 

*\*Beep\**

 

The scanner had refreshed again saying **LQ L02 P15**. Shrugging to myself I picked up another wallet and placed it in the box.

 

*\*Beep\**

 

It happened again. This ritual of the scanner refreshing each time I placed a wallet in the box happened over twenty times until there were no longer any more wallets.

 

*\*Beep\**

 

Exhausted and drenched in sweat I looked down at my scanner again as it read **LQ L03 P15**. Sighing I pulled my trolley just below, raised the trolley slightly, and climbed on top as it shuddered beneath my weight and rolled slightly. Clinging on to level three to stabilise the trolley beneath me I peered in. The pallet the products usually sit on was empty save for a single wallet all the way at the back. Pressing my chest against the rim of level 3 I reached my arm in as far as it would go, straining against the resistance and my body’s groans of disapproval. My fingertips barely grazed the side of it as I made a final push jumping a little to grab it, the trolley beneath me giving way. Yelling in surprise I was soon comforted by solid concrete as I thudded to the floor. My body ached sending a sensation like being electrocuted all throughout my muscles. I sat up slightly on my hands, dazed, before propping myself back up onto my feet and placing the wallet in the box.

 

Location 5, **LE L01 P13**.  I started to feel a little better at this point regarding my headache despite the newly appointed pain from the fall. Pulling the trolley along I entered aisle E. It was hard to see in the dimmed lights, but it was evidently clear that aisle E had not been cleaned properly Sunday night as my shoes would stick to the floor with a noticeable tug as it broke free each step I took. The trolley became harder to drag as its wheels started to become trapped in whatever was on the floor, but the product was only a couple steps away, so I pulled increasingly harder with each step I took becoming admittedly more and more frustrated until I abandoned it completely kicking the wheel and cursing under my breath as I left it. When I reached the product, it was a self-help book on anger management. Order 2100 was certainly our little comedian. Placing it in the box I picked the box up and turned my back on the trolley too tired to even free it from the aisle.

 

Location 6, **LA L01 P07.** I chuckled to myself when I saw this. After three products in a row that truly tested my patience the fact this one was not far at all from my station was a welcome change. Leaving the box where it was I walked down aisle A, to position 7 and looked at the half-open box that lay there. Clearly, someone had already been here before me, but this could have been weeks ago given that some products take longer to sell. Inside was a single smartphone, the package was demolished revealing a screen that was smashed in several places. What I don’t recall presently was hearing anything when I was in aisle A at the time not even my own breathing. Even the storm which could be heard throughout the order thus far had grown completely silent. I didn’t feel right giving this customer a broken phone and instead pressed enter on the scanner to see if there were any other locations with the same product. There was, **LA L02 P07**. Looking up at level two I carefully searched through the boxes for a phone that was as close to pristine as possible opting for one that had a tiny scuff on the bottom right corner of the package. Looking down, the scanner began to flash **LA L01 P07**. I had never seen the scanner do this before and it was clearly adamant that the broken phone was the correct one so I surrendered to its command and walked back to my station placing it inside the box.

 

Location 7, **LH L02 P13**. I recall hearing the storm again around this time. As I walked down past the aisles on my way to aisle H I couldn’t help but wonder how many more products were left. I was tired, drained in fact, in pain, and utterly defeated by the demands of order 2100. As I passed aisle C however I swear with every ounce of my being that I saw someone there, this time they were looking at me. Realisation overcoming me I swivelled back around on my heel towards aisle C. Again no one was there. This had happened too many times to be imaginary, it couldn’t be, it shouldn’t be, but if it wasn’t where did they go? Turning back towards aisle H, I saw the right side of a figure walk down it. Picking up the pace I rounded the corner to H. The entire aisle from bottom to top and from the entrance to the end, was completely soaked in blood. The stench overpowering my senses I fought back a flurry of heaving gags. I broke into a sprint towards the warehouse exit. This was the last straw. Someone or something was here, and it made sense to me that it was the reason for where all my colleagues had gone. Skidding as I rounded the corner I tripped rolling 3 times on the floor, stopping at the box for Order 2100 as I heard something moving across the floor.

 

\*Beep\*

 

Looking down at the scanner it read **LX L01 P05**, the product was on the warehouse floor. Looking in the direction of where I heard the rolling was my coffee mug. The mug my son gave me. The mug that read “World’s best Dad”. There was nothing else on the warehouse floor to my knowledge.

 

“Is this what you want!? You want me to finish your damn order? Oh, I'll finish it here and now!”

 

Picking up the mug, fury clouded my thoughts as I slammed it into the box ceramic chunks flying out.

 

“There! Are you happy now!”

 

*\*Beep\**

 

The scanner read, **LF L06 P06**. There is no level 6… unless… it meant the roof? Suddenly loud banging was heard from overhead the scanner beeping in quick succession to match each bang that echoed throughout the building, **LE, LD, LC, LB, LA**…. **LX L01 P05.** My throat began to tighten, my body shaking, tears running down my eyes as I turned behind me. The figure was directly in front of me and this time it was facing me. I couldn’t and still can’t recall what it looked like bar the orange vest. It was incomprehensible but what I do remember was its eyes. Two sunken pits of dark void engulfed by deep strokes of amber that licked beyond the rim of the pupils, they seemed to stare right to my very being and more. Fear taking hold I didn’t wait for it to speak, or touch me or whatever, I lurched from its gaze and darted toward the door. I didn’t even look back before I opened the door and ran out into the tempest.

 

Given that it was still before 5 pm, the roads were empty, and my wife and son were still at work and school by the time I arrived home. My boss called me countless times asking, “Where did you go?”, “Please come back” and the all too sweet admiration that “I was the employee that the company had envisioned for the role”. I told him each time that I had quit and would not return. As I am writing this, I received a further two calls from my boss asking how I was. I still haven’t seen my family and it’s getting late. I don’t know if they’ve gone to my Mother-in-Laws or what. I don’t know what’s going on but if anyone is reading this please use what I have said here as some level of advice. I pray you end up in a better fate than me but I pray even more for my sanity and for my family who may be affected.
