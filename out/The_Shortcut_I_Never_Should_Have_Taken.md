I was seventeen when it all went wrong. I still remember the date because it was the night before my final math exam. I’d been at my friend Luke’s house until almost midnight, trying to cram every formula into my brain. His place was a forty-minute walk from mine if you stuck to the sidewalks, the streetlights guiding you. That night I was exhausted, cold, and carrying a backpack that felt like it weighed a hundred pounds. I just wanted to get home, dive under my blankets, and pretend the exam didn’t exist.

Luke was leaning against his doorway, a flashlight in one hand, grin on his face. He shrugged and said I could save twenty minutes by cutting through Marrow Creek Woods. Everybody around town warned that those woods were off-limits after dark. Old tales about people vanishing, strange lights floating between trees, whispers that chased hikers off the path. I dismissed it all as local legend. Luke biked through that forest all the time and swore he never saw anything weird. He said maybe I’d spot a deer out there or a raccoon rummaging in the underbrush. No big deal he said, just bring the flashlight.

I stepped into those woods and felt the air change instantly. My breath came out in steamy puffs. My hoodie did nothing to ward off the chill. The trees rose so high they seemed to blot out the sky. Moonlight was nothing but a faint glow barely touching the leaf litter on the ground. I clicked on the flashlight and got a weak beam that shook in my hand for a second before it held steady. I told myself it was fine. It’s just dark I thought. It’s just me being jittery after too much coffee and no sleep.

The path underfoot was soft with fallen leaves and snapped twigs. My sneakers made a quiet rustling noise that sounded way too loud in the stillness. No animals scurried out. No rustling in the bushes. Nothing. I walked for maybe ten minutes and realized I hadn’t seen the old oak with the carved initials Luke mentioned. I hadn’t passed the rusty sign nailed to a post. I just had endless rows of trees, all looking the same. My heart started pounding so hard it felt like it might burst through my chest.

Then I heard it. Not wind. Not an animal. A soft snap, like someone stepping on a brittle branch. Then another, slower this time. Pause. Then two more. Each one closer than the last. My legs froze. My mind raced. I tried to tell myself it was a deer. A raccoon. Anything harmless. But the snaps were deliberate, spaced out to mirror someone dragging a foot. A slow, uneven rhythm that sent ice through my veins.

I stopped and held the flashlight steady. The beam cut a narrow circle of light. Beyond that was pitch. I whispered Luke’s name. No answer. The air seemed to press in on me, every shadow alive. My chest tightened. I rowed my arms for courage and took a step back. Another branch snapped. Crack. Crack. I swallowed and forced my legs to move forward. Faster. My breaths came in ragged gasps. My heart thrummed so loud I feared it gave away my position.

The flashlight flickered out. I dropped it without thinking. Darkness swallowed me whole. Panic flared in my chest. Thoughts tangled in my head. I could not stay here. I had to get out. I pounded through the leaves until I tripped over something that scraped my palms and knees. Pain shot up my arms and legs but I didn’t care. I scrambled, crawled, and got back to my feet. I ran.

Leaves slapped my face. Branches snagged my shirt. Every ounce of me screamed to stop. To scream. To turn and face whatever followed. But I just ran. I thought I heard a voice, a low whisper, calling my name. I jerked my head side to side but it was gone. My lungs burned like fire. My chest heaved. The woods seemed never-ending.

When I finally slowed to a stagger, I realized I was lost. The path had vanished. I couldn’t find any landmark. I couldn’t see the flashlight or the moon. Just endless trunks and that whisper in my mind. I pressed my back against a broad tree trunk and slid down to sit on the damp ground. Tears stung my eyes. I hugged my knees like they might keep me from floating away into the darkness.

That’s when I noticed the light. A faint glow flickering somewhere to my left. It could be my imagination. Could be fireflies. Could be a campfire. I mustered every scrap of courage I had and stood up. I moved toward the light, stumbling over roots, hands outstretched as if I could feel my way.

I emerged into a small clearing. A circle of stones held a dying fire. Around it stood three figures. I choked on my own breath. They were taller than any person I’d ever seen. Faces so pale they looked like they were carved from bone. Their eyes were empty hollows that stared right through me. Even from the edge of the light I could see their skin stretched too tight over skulls, thin lips peeling back into silent screams.

My legs seized. My mouth went dry. They lifted their heads in unison and turned toward me. No sound came from them. No footsteps. But they moved closer, long legs bending at angles that made my stomach twist. The fire cast grotesque shadows across their features, flickering in and out, reaching out as if to pull me toward it.

I screamed and bolted back into the trees. Branches tore at my shirt, scratched my arms, but I ignored the pain. I stumbled, fell, and got up again. The whispering followed—my name, soft and mocking. I ran until my lungs felt like they would collapse. I ran until I didn’t feel real anymore.

And then I was on the edge of the woods. Barely conscious. Head pounding, chest heaving. A truck idled on the road. A man leaned out the window and called to me. I collapsed into the passenger seat and passed out.

I woke up in a hospital bed with bandages on my hands and knees. My clothes were torn. The doctors said I probably got lost, had a panic attack, collapsed from exhaustion. They treated my scratches and sent me home. Nobody believed my story about the figures around the fire or the whisper in my ear. Nobody asked why I had deep handprint bruises on my back or why my flashlight was shattered on the ground nearby.

It’s been months but I still wake up drenched in sweat, heart pounding, flashlight beam dancing across my ceiling. I still hear that slow snap of branches and that soft whisper of my name. I still see those hollow faces, waiting in the trees. I’ll never set foot in those woods again. Ever. And neither should you.
