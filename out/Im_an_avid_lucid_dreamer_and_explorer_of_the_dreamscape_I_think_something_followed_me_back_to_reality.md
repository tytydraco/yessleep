My life has been difficult, and I do really mean difficult. People always say *no matter how bad you have it, someone always has it worse, so stop whining* but I really do have it bad, and I apologise if it makes me seem cruel, but I don't care about anyone else.

While I was still back in college, one night I had a very vivid dream, a lucid dream, although I came to learn of that name much later. In that dream I was conscious and aware, and able to do anything and everything I wanted. So I did the one thing I always wanted to do, I conjured up a scenario that has happened so many times before, but this time I made sure it had a different ending.

My bullies, Norman, Lukas and Jack all stood around me, frozen. I wanted to test these new powers of mine so I made them all kneel, and one by one, they all got down to their knees.

Amazed, I thought of them apologising to me, kissing up to my feet. Low and behold, the mighty 6 foot tall Norman bent forward, apologised in a hushed whisper and kissed my boots. I was ecstatic.

I played around in the dream for a while longer after exacting my revenge, which was watching those assholes run around the campus naked, while being chased by security.

Then I heard a loud ringing noise, the world started falling apart, and my eyes fluttered open to reality.

After that night, I wasn't able to enter the dreamscape for months, and I tried everything, and I do mean everything. Eventually I stumbled upon a post online on reddit, explaining the whole process of lucid dreaming step by step. It warned that it was a lengthy process, and not every night can result in lucid dreaming, but I tried nonetheless, and eventually I got back in. I was so happy that my momentary focus shattered and I woke up.

Since then, I've become an experienced lucid dreamer, that I just automatically enter the dreamscape as I drift off to sleep.

I've been all around the world at 30, I've seen all my wildest dreams come true, and sometimes even nightmares, I've lived full lifes, I've had sex with celebrities you couldn't even dream of seeing in person. I've done it all. The weirdest thing about it all is, my mind somehow knows the truth of something, even though I've never seen it.

One time I decided to try and watch a movie early, and I swear to fucking god, the movie played out the exact same as it did in theatres months later, another time, I got to see an actor shirtless, and this said actor had no shirtless pictures online or in movies, but my mind somehow conjured up a nasty birthmark on their back, and next week they posted a shirtless picture with that birthmark.

Freaky, right?

Anyway, thats not why I'm here today.

two nights ago I was exploring the dreamscape as usual, when I lost control and the world fell apart, and rebuilt itself into something different. It wasn't the first time that my mind couldn't keep its focus on what I wanted, and it would conjure up something different, but this time was different in the way that I couldn't move anymore. My entire body was shaking, but refused to listen to my commands.

I felt a pair of strong hands on my neck. "*I found you"* a raspy voice whispered into my ear, and the next moment I found myself tied up on a wooden chair, in some dark place.

*"You didn't think you could explore this realm for free for so long, did you?"* The raspy voice came from somewhere in the darkness.

*"Eventually, you'll have to pay the price"* It continued. "Who are you?!" I screamed into the darkness, meanwhile trying to conjure up a favorable scenario for myself, this was my dream, I had the power here. Or atleast that's what I thought.

The scenery shifted again and I found myself in my room, illuminated by the night sky. A dark figure was looming over me. I recognised this dark figure, it sometimes visited me before sleep, before I closed my eyes. It was the figure that came when I experienced sleep paralysis, it never did anything, it just stood there.

*"How do you wish to pay?"* It rasped into my ear, even though it was on the opposite side of the room, making me flinch.

Realisation hit me, I flinched, meaning I can move. I slowly got off the bed, "I'm not afraid of you, you're just a pigment of my imagination!"

The room shifted and a light came on, I did have some power here. The dark figure screeched and disappeared out of the room, but my victory didn't last long as everything shifted again and I was once again bound, this time against a tree, in a pitch black forest. *"The price.."* The voice whispered, and cold hands grabbed my neck once more and began choking me. I felt the pain and the lack of oxygen, it almost felt real.

A loud ringing resonated throughout the entire eerily quiet forest, my vision shifted and my eyes opened, I was back in my room, illuminated by sunlight. "*What the fuck was that?"* I whispered to myself. Maybe a nightmare?

I went into the bathroom and began brushing my teeth, when I noticed the rapidly receeding finger prints around my neck. I dropped my toothbrush and moved closer to the mirror, before the last of the prints faded away. I was in disbelief and shock.

As freaked out as I was, I managed to convince myself that it was just a nightmare, and I imagined the finger prints around my neck.

The following night I entered the dreamscape again, and everything was back to normal, I decided to treat myself to a luxurious dinner with a famous celebrity, and we chatted the evening away while eating an exquisite lobster in a five star restaurant.

*"Yeah and playing in that movie was completely exhausting, I really paid the price"* They said.

"The price?" I asked them to elaborate further, but the lights suddenly dimmed, and the loud chatter around us turned into hushed whispers. *"You also have to pay the price"* The voice grew distorted and twisted. I tried to stand up, but found myself to be bound to the chair. The food I was eating turned to rotten mush, full of worms. The person infront of me, remained unchanged, continued eating the rotten food, biting into the worms and chewing.

"What do you want?" I asked with confidence I wish I had.

*"You need to pay.."* It rasped into my ear.

"No!" I screamed, my bindings suddenly coming undone, I stood up and ran outside the restaurant, it was the forest again, I ran through the dead silent woods not looking back before I tripped on the branch and fell, I winced in pain as my perspective changed and I was back in the restaurant. *"You can't run from me."* It rasped into my other ear. "No, but I can wake up." I took the knife still laying on the table and stabbed it into my hand, the sudden surge of pain woke me up.

I was inside my room, It was still dark, I stood up, still feeling pain in my hand for some reason. I looked at it for a long moment, in disbelief. The knife wound was there, a hole right in the middle of my fucking hand.

I frantically stood up and went to the bathroom to my bandage my hand, I disenfected it and winced in pain, then looked in the mirror, from the corner of my eye I saw a silhouette outside the bathroom, just watching. "What the fuck do you want?" I screamed at it as I backed away from the door.

*"You will pay with your life.."* It rasped at me, In response I lunged into the dark hallway, right at it, aiming for the light switch, and flicked it. The shadow screeched as it slowly retreated back into darkness.

I stayed in the hallway the rest of the night until it turned daytime, and the entire time it kept repeating *"The price is your life."* I drove to the hospital at the first sign of sunlight to have my hand checked out, they asked me a lot of questions about the injury, but I had nothing to tell them.

I am back home as I write this, and it has already gotten dark. I can see dark shadows moving around the house, working on some devious plan. As for my plan, stay up all night and keep the lights on no matter the cost, because as I learned, it can't exist where light prevails, I only hope it is enough.

I can't let it get to me, whatever it is, it has followed me back, and wants me dead.
