Hi all, I will try to keep this short, but apologies if I ramble a bit, I'm not trying to, it's just that I'm pretty shaken up and I feel like I am in, or going to be in, so much trouble... I thought about posting on AITA, but it's pointless, I KNOW I'm the asshole, I mean, I broke into someone's house! Ugh okay let me back up a little…

My name is Maia and I'm 28 years old. I've worked for my company since I was 20, in a couple of different positions, but have been in the one I'm in now for the last 5 years. It's a pretty run of the mill company, local but with a few locations in our state, with about 100 employees at each location. We sell a product to bigger companies, yada yada it’s not important. My boss for the last five years has been a guy I'll call Lance. Lance is around 40, and until recently, I had never had a problem with him as my boss. He was always fair and kind, and really stayed out of all of our (his direct reports, I mean) business as long as we did our jobs. He's sort of a loner, never married, no kids, parents live out of state, and I don't know if he has any siblings, but if he does, I don't think he's in contact with them.

He lives really close to our company, which everybody knows, because less than a mile down the road from our building is his apartment complex, and his parking spot is right by the road. People have joked about seeing his car there to him before, and he has confirmed that it's where he lives, so that's that. Nothing weird about it, just an interesting little detail. He doesn't talk about his personal life much, and the consensus among us employees is that the main reason for that is that it is mostly non-existent. We know that he plays DnD with a couple of guys he knows from all the way back in high school, but that seems to be his only real social interaction outside of work, and he doesn't even seem to be that into it, it's just a once a month thing that he does. None of us ever run into him anywhere outside of work, and our town, while not tiny, isn't THAT big, and you often run into people you know. But whatever, him being a loner who is content to just go to work and then back to his apartment 99% of the time isn't a crime. Like I said, he's not even that socially inept -- a little weird, sure, and definitely behind the times (the man still has a flip phone for God's sake), but nothing bad, at least not until recently.

This all started, or at least, I started noticing it about a month ago. Only the managers like Lance have offices, everyone else has bullpen style desks. Mine has a lot of shit on it, I'm a maximalist, what can I say? Which is maybe why I didn't notice right away. But over the last month, some of my stuff has gone missing. The first thing I noticed was actually garbage... I had drank a Dr. Pepper on my lunch break, and then chucked the empty can into my recycle bin. At the end of the day when I went to empty and sort the recycle bin (we have to take it to the main bins and separate it by metal, glass, paper/cardboard, and plastic), the can was nowhere to be found. But the rest of the stuff in the recycle bin, little bits of paper, a flattened empty tissue box, etc., were all still there. It was so strange and I couldn't explain it, but finally rationalized that maybe someone bumped into my bin and only the can fell out, and they grabbed it and threw it away elsewhere. Why they wouldn't have just put it back in the bin well... I don't know, but I had no other explanation.

I forgot about it though, until a few days later when an almost empty tube of chapstick disappeared from my desk. I had a new back up one in my drawer, but I don't open the new ones until the old ones are totally used up. This one was ALMOST used up, but not quite. I tore my desk apart looking for it, and checked my trash and recycle bins too -- nothing. I asked the guy who sits closest to me if he had seen it or moved it, or noticed anyone at my desk, but he said no, and told me he hadn't left his desk all day. I was confused, but not too suspicious yet. But then, it kept happening -- little, innocuous things kept going missing. A sticky note with client information on it, a sticker that an adjacent department had given me that I hadn't yet done anything with, things like that. And then, last week on Friday, I came back from the bathroom to see Lance on his hands and knees, partially under my desk. He must have heard me approach because he hastily stood up and handed me my purse.

"Sorry, Maia," he said, cool as a cucumber as he handed it to me. "You know how clumsy I am. Kyle is running a system wide update and all computers in this block needed to be restarted ASAP, so since you were away from your desk I sat down at it to do the restart, and accidentally knocked your purse over." Now he looked a little embarrassed. "Your wallet and a couple things fell out but I scooped them back in, I didn't even look at what they were..." He then gestured to my computer. "And as you can see, I didn't even make it to doing the restart." He laughed awkwardly, and so did I, but I told him it was no big deal. Everything about his story seemed perfectly plausible. He asked that I restart my computer right away, so I did, and Lance walked away. While the computer was rebooting, I looked around under my desk, making sure nothing had fallen out of my purse that Lance had missed; I didn't see anything. So then I looked in my purse, and sure enough, sitting on top, having been hastily scooped back in, was my wallet, a tube of lip gloss, and a little thing of pocket sized hand sanitizer. It's a relatively large purse, so I moved those things to the side and looked through the rest of the contents. Everything was there... Except... My emergency scrunchie. I always keep a scrunchie or hair tie on my wrist, but have a spare one in my bag in case I forgot to put one on my wrist in the morning. I had just seen it that morning before leaving my house, because it had reminded me to grab another one to put on my wrist. And now it was definitely gone. I searched all around under my desk, and nothing.

I likely would have let even that go, and maybe even forgotten about it, if it wasn't for what happened at the end of the day. Perhaps TMI, sorry, but I was on my period, and I went to the bathroom around 4:30pm again. There are four singular, unisex bathrooms on our floor, two at one end of the floor, and two at the other. I went into one of the ones closest to my end and changed my tampon, disposing of the used tampon in the little trashcan after wrapping it up well in toilet paper, and put the plastic applicator of the new one back in it's little packaging and threw that away too. Then I washed my hands, and exited the bathroom, only to almost run into Lance. He was walking up to the bathrooms, and promptly moved out of my way.

"Oops, sorry!" He said, as he walked past me into the bathroom I had just vacated. It seemed a little odd, especially because his office is pretty much directly outside the bathrooms at the OTHER end of the hall... I suddenly just got this weird feeling, about everything that had happened that day. I don't really know what possessed me to do it, but I went into the bathroom next to the one I had just vacated, quietly locked the door, and put my ear up to the wall between the two bathrooms. I expected to immediately be grossed out and embarrassed by hearing Lance use the toilet, in any form, expecting to immediately be proven wrong about any budding suspicion that I had. Except that I didn’t hear anything. No sound of urine hitting the toilet bowl, no running water from the sink, no whir of the paper towel dispenser, not even the sound of someone moving around. Just… Nothing. Usually, you can hear some of what is going on in the other bathroom from one of them. So was Lance just… Standing in there? I stayed like that against the wall for another minute, it wasn’t more than a minute, before I heard the door open and his footsteps go back down the hall.

I waited until I couldn’t hear him anymore before cautiously exiting the bathroom and looking around the hallway. No one was there. I quickly opened the first bathroom door again and went inside, shutting and locking it behind me. It truly seemed like he had done nothing in there. There was no smell, and the little dab of soap I had accidentally left on the faucet’s tap was still there, indicating that it hadn’t been touched. The toilet made no sound and was not filling with water, indicating that it hadn’t been flushed in the last few minutes, which I knew it hadn’t, because I would have heard it. I was so confused, and about to leave the bathroom, thinking I was being silly, maybe he was just checking his hair in the mirror or something, when a thought occurred to me.

I still tried to convince myself that I was being stupid, that there was no way… But something told me to check the trashcan. I did, and there was nothing inside except a few old, crumpled tissues that had been in it when I opened it up to throw my used tampon and applicator away. The tampon and the tissue I had wrapped it in, as well as both the applicator and its packaging, were gone. I instantly felt sick and wondered if I was going to throw up. I couldn’t figure out a way to justify this one. I even checked my watch, I guess hoping that I had experienced some kind of glitch in the matrix that caused me to lose time or something. But no, it was still not even 4:40pm. I started shaking, unsure of what to do. In a kind of daze, I made my way back towards my desk, but then I stopped, and walked towards Lance’s office. I wasn’t going to confront him, I don’t know what I was thinking of doing, but I got lucky. Really lucky.

Lance’s office door was cracked open just a little, and I stopped and stood against the wall outside of the office. He was on the phone.

“Yeah, thanks Mike,” I heard him say. “Yeah I’m leaving tonight, I’ll be back Monday night, but the package should come tomorrow. I think they’re going to text me when it arrives but if you swing by after your shift around 5pm it should be there. It’s just my new dice kit, so nothing perishable, but expensive enough that I don’t want it sitting in the hallway. Just use the code to open the door and set it right inside the door.” The reply from the other end of the phone was inaudible, but then Lance dropped his voice a little and said “0404”. Bingo. I walked away from his office, I think already knowing in the back of my mind what I was going to do.

I waited until close to 7pm on Saturday night. I wanted to be sure that his pal Mike had come and gone by the time I got there. I knew it would be easy to figure out which unit was his based on the parking spot right by the road that I’d passed so many times. I parked across the street in the parking lot of a strip mall and quickly jogged over to the complex. Sure enough, his car was in the spot, and it was marked 2079. The complex is laid out sort of like a motel, where all of the front doors to the apartments open to outside. I looked around, but as the building was old, I didn’t see any central security cameras, and I reasoned that even if there were some, no one would have any reason to suspect anything amiss because I would just be walking up to a unit, inputting the code, and walking in.

My stomach was in knots, both because of the fact that I was about to pull a good old fashioned B&E, and also because of the reason why I was doing it, and the prospect of what I might find. I was dressed in all black, with my hair in a tight bun so that no strands would come loose in his place (how unnecessary that proved to be), and I didn’t wear my hood up, or a ski mask or anything, because I didn’t want to be suspicious. I walked quickly up the steps to the second of four floors, and followed the numbers around to the back of the building, where his unit (conveniently) is. Sure enough, no package in front of his door. I looked around for a personal security camera of some sort, or a Ring doorbell, but saw nothing, so I took a deep breath, put in the code next on the keypad next to the door, and when I heard the lock clicking out of place, tried the handle. I was almost shocked when it actually opened.

I froze for a moment, and then quickly entered the apartment and shut the door behind me. I stood in silence for a moment, frantically scanning my eyes around the dark rooms. It didn’t seem like anyone was home, but I felt like I had to be sure.

“Hello?” I called out in the deepest voice I could muster, hoping I didn’t sound like myself. If anyone responded, or I heard movement anywhere in the unit, I was going to sprint out the door and away from the complex. But I heard nothing. I took another deep breath and reached for a light switch that I could faintly see through the dying light outside the windows, but then I stopped, deciding it would be better to just use the light on my phone, so that’s what I did. I turned on my phone flashlight and scanned it around the room. I was standing in an entryway that then opened into a living room, with a small kitchen and dining table to my left. Sure enough, right to the left of my feet was the package that Mike had likely put inside an hour or so before.

As quietly as possible I slipped off my shoes and began to look around. Fortunately, the place was relatively clean and not very big, so it didn’t take me long. I looked in the fridge and saw extremely typical single man items — three different kinds of cold cuts, a half eaten and poorly wrapped veggie tray from Costco, a six-pack of beer with two cans gone, a Britta water pitcher… I closed the fridge and headed towards the living room, looking at some papers on the dining room table as I passed it, but they just looked like ordinary bills and fliers and the like. The living room was similar — TV, old couch with an even older looking blanket tossed over the back of it, some gaming equipment, a stack of magazines on a small end table, and a little bookshelf under the window crammed with books.

There were two bedrooms in the place, one right off the living room, and one that looked to be at the end of a hallway going to the right when you come in the door, that had the only attached bathroom. I looked in the bedroom off the living room first. The curtains were drawn, so I went inside, shut the door behind me, and turned on the light. The room was pretty bare — an old futon against one wall, and a big desk with a fancy computer and ergonomically correct chair against the other. The closet by the window was ajar so I nudged it open; its contents were also normal — some board games, a three-piece suit and a couple of old looking winter coats, a toolkit, and some random assorted junk. I jiggled the computer mouse, hoping the computer wouldn’t be password protected and I could see if there was any creepy shit on it, but of course it *was* password protected, so I sighed and left the room. The last room in the house was clearly the master bedroom. Lance’s master bedroom.

I was suddenly hit with a wave of guilt and fear, because what I was doing was so wrong. I had broken into my boss’s home and snooped around, and now I was about to go snoop around his most private inner sanctum, his bedroom and bathroom. I almost backed out. I almost turned and grabbed my shoes and ran out of that apartment, but then I remembered why I was there. I was almost certain that in one day, he had stolen a scrunchie out of my purse, and my **used tampon out of the bathroom!** With renewed anger and vigor I stalked down the hallway to the closed bedroom door. I paused and looked first through the open bathroom door, you could get to it from the hallway and from the bedroom, it appeared.

I decided to go into the bathroom first, working up the courage to go into the bedroom, and looked around. As with the rest of the rooms so far, the bathroom was exceptionally ordinary. Toothbrush and toothpaste on the counter, comb and nail clippers in the drawer, assorted medications and a stick of deodorant in the medicine cabinet above the toilet. And so, I took a deep breath and turned and walked into the bedroom. In this room too, the curtains were closed, so I turned on the light. At first, everything looked normal here too — queen sized bed against the back wall with a boring, navy blue comforter and two pillows, a TV mounted on the opposite wall, a chest of drawers on the wall next to the closet, which unlike the other bedroom, was closed tightly.

There was one bedside table next to the bed and I opened the drawer. Inside was a tube of Carmex, an issue of The Economist, a granola bar, and two condoms that looked older than I am. It looked like there might be another magazine under The Economist, so I picked it up, and let out an audible laugh when I saw a Playboy magazine underneath. ‘Who tf jerks off to magazines anymore?’ I thought to myself as I picked up the Playboy to see how old it was. But I never remembered to check the date, because when I picked up the magazine, something fell out of it, and when I stooped to pick it up, my blood ran cold. It was a centerfold spread from the magazine, a woman with a gorgeous body laying completely naked on a beach. I don’t know what her face looked like though, because it had been cut out, and replaced with a picture of mine. I gasped and dropped the page, before immediately picking it up again and staring in dismay at it. The picture was one from my Facebook page, totally innocuous, just a normal picture, but he’d printed it out, cut it out, and pasted it over this naked model.

Hands shaking, I flipped through the rest of the magazine, and fortunately didn’t find anything else like that. I hated to do it, but I put the page back in the magazine, and put the magazine back in the drawer with the other magazine on top of it. I stood for a moment with my hands on my knees, fighting the urge to vomit. Now I knew, I hadn’t come here for nothing. My suspicion had been correct and I had no idea what I was going to do next. I decided I had to document it, which I am obviously not going to post here because it would dox me, and it’s proof of me breaking and entering. But I got the magazine back out and took pictures and videos of it, as I did with everything else that I would find a few moments later.

Once I got the bedside table all put back together, I looked around the room more thoroughly, and frantically. I looked under the bed, in the drawers, behind the bedside table. Nothing. It was like I knew where everything would be and was putting off looking for it. I forced myself to go to the closet, and I took a deep breath before flinging the double doors open. I was actually surprised that all I saw were clothes, just hanging on their hangers, as normal as could be. But I wasn’t fooled. I plunged my hands into the clothes, feeling for the wall behind them, and almost immediately my hands hit a shelf, just behind the clothes. I grabbed the hangers at the middle of the closet and shoved them to the sides… And there it all was.

A small bookshelf with three shelves that came up to about my chest height had been shoved against the wall, and everything on it was mine. The lowest of the three shelves was almost entirely papers from work. Sticky notes with random information scribbled on them, a couple of logic problem sheets I had printed out and done when I was bored one day, a magazine that one of our distributors sends me once a month, all of which I had eventually tossed in my recycle bin. There was also one of my pens laying on top of the papers, all of which had been smoothed out as much as possible.

The second shelf had the Dr. Pepper can that had disappeared from my recycle bin, as well as a very dried up peel from a clementine I had eaten God knows when, a napkin with a smear of lipgloss and red chili oil from some lunch I ate at some point, and the most disturbing (on this shelf) in my opinion, a rather large wad of chewed gum. It was all different colors, clearly collected out of my trash bin over quite a long period of time, rolled into a multi-colored, faintly sweet smelling ball.

But the top shelf was the worst, by far. As I had sordidly predicted, my used tampon from the day before as well as the applicator were sitting front and center on a fancy china saucer. Next to them was a tissue from when I came to work sick a few weeks ago — my snot was bright green, which I guess he had noticed because the tissue that I had crumpled up and thrown in the trash had been pried open as best as one could, and put on display. The dried mucus on it was still that sickly greenish yellow, and was hard and crusty to the touch. I gagged. Also on the top shelf were the mostly empty tube of lip balm, more tissues, and my scrunchie, which had a huge mass of what I can only assume is my hair in the center of it. I have a hairbrush at work, and now that I was thinking about it I realized I couldn’t remember when I’d last needed to clear the shedded hair from it… Well, that’s because he had been doing it, and since the hairbrush stays at the office, he could do it anytime he wanted to since he has a master key and none of us employees do. There were also pictures of me taped to every wall of the shelf — some that he had clearly gotten from my social media profiles (we are not and never have been friends on any of them, so this is just what I have publicly available which isn’t much), plus a ton of candid shots of me at work, most of them extremely zoomed in, and some that I think he even took from the work security cameras, the quality was so bad.

Gagging and with tears streaming down my face, I got photos and video evidence of everything, and then I searched through the rest of the closet but found nothing else. So I put the clothes back and, still sobbing and shaking, did another lap around the apartment to see if I could find anything else. I was about to leave when I remembered the computer. I went back to it and sat down, wondering if I could guess the password. I tried **0404** like his house door code, but that didn’t work. Then I tried **Lance0404**; that was wrong too. A thought occurred to me and I shivered and typed in **Maia**. I was relieved that it didn’t work, but then I thought of something else and typed in **Maia0404**, and to my shock, dismay, and relief, the computer unlocked.

I mopped my eyes with my hands and tried to concentrate on the screen. There wasn’t much on it — a Steam icon on the desktop, and a couple of assorted video games, plus the normal icons for things like email, music, etc. There were three folders on the desktop, one labeled “Work Stuff”, one labeled “Family Docs”, and one labeled “Australia 2021”. I opened Work Stuff first, and it appeared that it was in fact work stuff. I recognized many of the file names, spreadsheets of our top clients, and found nothing out of the ordinary in it. So then I clicked over to Family Docs. This was mostly a bunch of information about his mom, who apparently (this was unbeknownst to me before that day) had been battling pancreatic cancer for years and had died three months ago. I felt sorry for him for about 3 seconds before I thought of the closet again. I exited Family Docs and opened Australia 2021.

It was a large folder with hundreds of pictures in it, and all of them did in fact seem to be of Lance’s trip to Australia in 2021. I scrolled through pages of thumbnails and was about to give up and leave when I got to the bottom of the file, where a second file folder was stored within the first one, and it was just titled ZYX (I figured out later it was likely titled that to ensure that it stayed at the bottom of the folder at all times). I opened it, and it was almost as bad as the closet. There were all of the digital versions of the photos he had printed and stuck to the shrine shelf, but the worst part was the audio and video footage. He had taken videos of me at work, just doing totally normal things, mostly from afar and zoomed in like with the photos. But the audios were the most bizarre and insane thing in the album.

He had evidently pulled the call logs of me on the phone with clients, and spent God knows how long cutting out individual words. Fortunately, he wasn’t very good at this, and it would be clear to anyone with half a brain that I hadn’t actually said the things in the audios and that they were spliced together clips of other conversations, but it was still horrifying. The titles of the clips were horrifying too. One titled “my girl forever” was a spliced clip of my voice saying “I love you Lance”. Another titled “making love” was crude clips of my voice that said, in a creepy, uncanny valley like fashion “make me come make me come Lance”. Another titled “always” was my voice saying “you and me together always”. I almost called the cops right then and there.

But I didn’t, and it’s part of why I’m asking for your advice, because… I broke into his house. I’m not a cop, so my “probable cause” doesn’t count for anything, does it? Wouldn’t what I found not be admissible in court because I broke in to obtain it? I’m wondering if I should like… Anonymously send my photo and video evidence of all of his insanity to the police? Obviously he’s stalking me… Sort of… I mean, from what I can tell he hasn’t followed me anywhere or anything but he’s clearly on some Joe Goldberg level of obsession, so…? I know what he’s doing is illegal on some level, but is what I did more illegal?

After documenting everything in the album, I closed everything on the computer, made sure I left everything in the apartment as I found it, and snuck back out, locking the door behind me. As soon as I got to my car across the street, I threw up on the ground. I can’t believe what I’ve found. I knew it was going to be bad, given that him stealing my used fucking tampon is what led me to investigate in the first place, but I just never could have imagined the level of obsession he was at. He acts so normal towards me in person! The one thing I did notice is that his obsession with me seems to have started around the time his mom died, which I guess makes sense, I know things like that can be a trigger, though I don’t know what set his sights on ME. But even in the last 3 months, aside from last Friday, his behavior towards me hadn’t been weird or different at all, which is terrifying. Anyway… I just don’t know what to do, and I really really need some advice. I’ve called out every day this week so far as I just cannot imagine seeing him, but I can’t call out forever; I have to deal with this somehow, so please, please help me. Thank you so much in advance. 😓
