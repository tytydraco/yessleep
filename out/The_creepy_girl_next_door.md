So before I even bother trying to explain what's happening to me right now, I need to give some background. 

This happened about two years ago. I was in my room cleaning and listening to music. It was nighttime and I casually looked put the window of my room, I can't say I remember as to why as it was two years ago. But for whatever reason I did. 

Now it's important to note that my house is in a complex area. So there's generally a row of about seven identical houses connected to one other in a line. Same goes for the houses in fronts and behind us. Meaning we share a backyard with the people behind us and a street with the houses in front of us. My window faces the back of the house so I have a clear view of the backyard and backside of the houses behind us. 

As I was looking out I noticed one of the windows from the other side of the yard. It was on the top floor and the lights were on. But the room seemed empty, now I don't know if that's true because I mean it was just a quick glance and there's only so much I could see from where I was. Just as I was about to turn around and go back to what I was doing something caught my eye. There was a person in the room now. The figure from what I remember had long dark hair and and tan skin. I don't remember what she was wearing as again it was fairly far from where I was. The thing I do remember was she didn't have a face. She just didn't. It look was just an empty canvas of tan skin. I thought this was odd, because even from that far away I should've still been able to make out small distinctions. But I couldn't. 

Anyways once I noticed her I stood there for a moment, not really thinking much of it. I think I remember having the passing thought of "oh that's weird I totally didn't see her there before" . 

As I stood there just kind of looking at her, I realized that she was looking at me too, or just facing my direction. I couldn't help but notice how odd she looked. She was standing in this  incredibly and perfectly still position. Her arms hanging by her side and her shoulders perfectly broad. Something about it was just so uncanny. 

At this point we had been standing there for I don't know how long. Felt like ten minutes at least. Then she abruptly stepped away from the window and sat down on something. Her head still completely turned to face my direction. There was a moment of pause. Then she sporadically started to sit up and down off the bed. Still facing me. Just over over and over again. But at incredibly speeds. It looked like she was a video and some one had sped up the film. It just looked odd. In humane. 

At this point I'm looking out the window and thinking. What. The . Fuck. Is this girl doing? 

I think I was a little bit creeper out by that point. But I brushed it off. Maybe she'd seen me staring and was just messing around trying to be funny. 

Then she stopped. She was standing again. Still facing me. Then she got up real close to the window. And just started waving her arms and moving up and down. Again I still thought she was just trying to mess with me, when I realized how deranged she was moving. How her limbs were bending in ways they weren't supposed too. The way it seemed like her joints were slowly becoming unhinged from there sockets. 

At this point I was mega creeped out. I didn't know if I was hullincatieng or if I was just imaging that she was acting so weird. So I just decided to go back to what I was doing.

I'll be honest I don't remember what happened that night. 

But what I do know, is that the people who live there? Don't have a daughter. It's just the two of them. Sure the girl I saw might be the lady who lives there with her husband. But the girl I saw seemed young. 


Anyways, that was two years ago. And I just brushed it off as some weird thing that happened to me and I haven't thought much of it. I had completely forgotten about it till just now. 


Again,I was in my room. Doing something. And casually glanced over at the houses across the yard. Across from me, there was room, seemingly empty, for the most part. In the right hand corner, there was girl her head awkwardly crooked to be looking my direction. Can't see her body. You know in cartoons when the character can peer around a corner with just there heads? Yeah. That's what she's doing. 

As soon as I saw I immediately picked up my phone and started writing this down. I needed to tell someone. And I was curious to see of anyone has had this happen to them. 


After I wrote that last little bit. I got up and looked out the window again. She's still there. Except this time there's something else in there with her. I don't know if it's a person, object, entity, whatever. But it wasn't there before. 


I don't know what to do. Has anyone had this happen before??
