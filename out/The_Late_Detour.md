# PART 1: PROLOGUE

Who doesn't love a good folk tale? To be honest, I grew up watching horror movies. Among them, it's interesting to watch if it's based on a folk tale or maybe urban legends. I like them even though most of their plotlines begin with a family or maybe a group of friends from town moving to the countryside, either for staying or for exploring, only to ultimately face their horrors in the end. Even though the beginnings are all the same, the presentation of it makes that flick watchable or exciting. What I have in store for you isn't different from any of that.

Willmore—a town abandoned over the years due to some infection that has taken its wake during the past three years. The settlements there are on the verge of their decaying stage. No one over the years has cared about that town and its people. They know of the consequences if they dare to step foot in there. Years of loneliness have made that town dark.

James and Taissa are on their vacation back in Arkansas. They had to cut short their trip as James has an unexpected business meeting to attend to. The last-minute rush was not a habit in either of their lives in the last few years. When it happened all of a sudden, their ways began to change, which led to arguments and shouting, and at last, they reconciled. After refreshing themselves, they packed their bags for an early checkout from the Lakeview Resort. They rushed to their car, needing to catch this flight. “It’s already late,” James mumbled with the steering wheel in hand. “You’ll miss it for sure if you keep driving like this,” Taissa argued with James. “Do what, Tessy? Now, I am the one responsible? Is that what you are about to say? Then say it,” James crossed her. “Anyways, try to be careful on the road,” Taissa opened up a peaceful solution.

Upon reaching the airport after skidding their way through heavy traffic, they learned that the flight was late for hours. So they finalized their journey by road. “There’s nothing to worry about, James. I’ve packed all the essentials.” “Thank God; now it has come in handy.” “Alright, alright, I know you’ll take care of it. After all, you are my resourceful Tessy Bear,” James smiled at Taissa. Taissa chuckled. “Don’t make me do it, dear hussy. Please don’t.” They are both sharing their precious moments from their early married life. They want it to be delightful, trying to make the most out of every chance they get.

# PART 2: THE TRAIL

The long journey has tired both of them, and they decided to take a rest. They look at the map. The nearest town is Willmore. They decided on the Willmore Motel at Firefly Lane. Moving along the path mentioned in the map leads them to a rusty board showing direction to Firefly Lane. “FIREFLY LANE—I wonder how this town got this name,” James said. It’s complete darkness all around; there is no sign of a single human being anywhere. “I am afraid we’ll get lost in here and there’s no service too,” Taissa seems concerned. “There’s nothing to worry about. We’ll reach the motel soon, and everything will be alright,” James pats Taissa. Taissa put out a fake smile at James.

They reached the motel late at night. After parking the car, the couple steps into the motel. “Welcome to Willmore Motel. How can I help you?” a dark, stout man at the reception counter inquired. “Well, we need a room for the night. We’ll checkout early morning,” James said in haste. The receptionist at the counter grabs a pair of keys from the wooden board with hooks behind him. “It’s room 107, sir. It’s just over there. Have a good night and a safe stay.” The receptionist showed them a room at the corner. “Feel free to call for any assistance; it’s 001 for the reception.” James thanked him, and they both went into the room. Both were tired from the long drive, and after having a brief bath, they fell into bed.

When the alarm blared at 5 in the morning, Taissa woke up and tried to wake James. James slowly came to. “How’s the sleep?” James asked Taissa. “Nothing much, but it's okay. Come on, we have to be quick before the traffic is at its peak,” Taissa encouraged James. James rushed into the bathroom, followed by Taissa, and they both brushed their teeth. After a bath, and when they finished getting ready, they locked the room and went to the counter. When they reached the office, they were shocked to see a pool of blood there, and a trail of something leaving into the woods caught Taissa’s attention. “James… James… here… look,” Taissa poked at a shocked James. “WHAT? WHAT IS IT?” James looked at Taissa with an angry face. After seeing what Taissa had shown him, James came to his senses and spoke, “There’s something wrong here… let’s leave.”

“Let’s have a look first,” Taissa said. “Look around? Are you out of your mind? There’s probably something loose out there. I suggest we scoot,” James stopped Taissa. They both went out to have a look at the motel and surroundings. It was all covered with overgrown moss and other creepers and was surrounded by a dense forest. The path they took is the road that ends at the motel. They rushed to their car. James turned the key. The engine sputtered and failed. James acted awkwardly with the whole situation going out of his hands. “There must be a way out for sure,” Taissa consoled him. “No, Tessy, we are trapped in this godforsaken place. All the other rooms seem to be empty. It’s just us here.” They both sat on the steps at the motel entrance.
