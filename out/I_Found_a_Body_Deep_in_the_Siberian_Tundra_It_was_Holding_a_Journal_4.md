So, it’s been a few days since I last wrote about this. Been crunching pretty hard - hopefully the quota’s met before pickup arrives tomorrow. Though, I think we’ll have some spare time, with the forensics team on site.

Sorry, stalling. Here’s the next section.

# The Uncoupled

The brutality displayed in this realm is nothing to be scoffed at, but at the very least, you grow accustomed. Meat and bone lose their sting. And yet, there are some things the scars can’t toughen you against.

One in particular stands out to me. Curt and I were out on a scouting trip. We’d long since made amends by this time and agreed to let bygones be just that.

Plodding along the ridge of a snow dune, Curt cocked his head to look at something, then grabbed my shoulder with a wary firmness.

“Get down. Now.”

We both dropped down below cover. I hadn’t seen anything, but by now I trusted Curt’s judgement.

“What?” I whispered, “what’d you see?”

“Caught it in the corner me eye. Thank fuck I ain’t look at it.”

Without thinking I went to peek over into the open snowfield. Curt tore me back down by the scruff of my jacket, bringing me to eye level.

“The hell you doing, you fuckin’ oaf? Don’t look at it!”

I stared, confused.

“At *what*?”

“The Uncoupled. Should really get Ellie to go over-”

“Woah, slow down. Uncoupled?”

“Yeah. Don’t look too deep int’ the name. I only seen it in the corner me vision before. Jus’ a dark shape. Nah, more than that, a stain. A stain on the world.”

Carefully, I turned my head in the direction he’d seen it, as if I’d be able to see right through the snow.

“Okay… if you can’t look at it, how do you know?”

“Been plenty here before you, mate. Knew one or two of ‘em. This kid called, ah… Kent, yup. He looked. Said it was hollow, sort of an empty imprint that mighta once been a person. I think he said som’ along the lines of, ‘*it’s like if you took someone and stripped everything away except their being*’. Still not sure what he really meant, but it’s enough to know I ain’t never gonna look at it. Well, that, n’ the fact that a moment later he’s already thirty feet ahead and stumbling toward it.”

Pausing to let Curt’s words sink in, I muttered,

“Where is he now? I mean, Yago got taken, and he came back.”

He shook his head, eyes focused on nothing.

“Couldn’t tell ya. Only way I even remember him is cause’a his voice. Screams, god-awful wailing, surfing across the dunes n’ through the air. In those short times when the wind stumbles, if you just listen…”

Following his lead, I cocked an ear upwards, frostbitten air slicing past my skin. There was nothing other than the howling gale and the hammering of my heart. However, the longer I listened, I picked up on something distinct from the wind whistling.

It *did* sound like screams.

For all I know, Curt could’ve just been pulling a sick prank. It’s easy to hear things that aren’t there. To see what you want to see. Only, as I focused, it began to morph. Into the tone and timbre of a voice I still remembered. One I remembered well. It was the last voice I’d heard before this all happened. I tried not to think about it.

“*HELP ME.*”

The words were hissed straight into my ear. It startled me so bad my legs straightened and I hopped off the ground. No question that time. It was *his* voice. After that, it wasn’t a matter of not thinking about it, but of trying to forget.

I must’ve been in a trance when Curt spoke up again, snapping his fingers.

“Hey! You alright? Come on. We should get back. Ain’t see nothing out there worth the risk today. Just, uh… if you ever see something in the corner your eye, something darker than dark… leave.”

I nodded, grimacing, and we made our way back down to our home.

# Weather

If constant, freezing snowfall wasn’t enough, the weather knows worse cruelty. For the most part, we have shelter if it starts raining anything untoward. If you’re caught out in the snowfield, though, well… let’s say you’ll be back in a few weeks at best. Months or years at worst.

That happened one time while Eleanor and Alexi went out scavenging. They must’ve been on their way back when it started raining these razor sharp ice shards, finger-sized blades that sliced straight through canvas and embedded deep into wooden platforms.

Pained snarls from above heralded Alexi’s arrival, the rope ladder quivering under his descent. The best way I can describe how he looked was as if a shrapnel grenade had detonated three feet in front of him - well, all around him really. Deep, weeping gashes littered his body, and strands of flayed skin danced in the wind. It was like looking at a mangled human-shaped version of those cheese strings. You know, the ones you peel strips off of? I wish I could taste one of those again.

Anyway, there wasn’t much we could do except bandage him up - even then, it was more so we didn’t have to see his injuries. I realised in my stupidity something we’d overlooked - he was alone.

“Oh, shit. Alexi, where’s Ellie?” Nia whimpered, “she fall behind?”

He sat there, lifeless. It could’ve been the bandages wrapped around his head. I think he was just too broken to register the question.

“Alexi you motherfucker, *where is she*!?”

With his throat and chest a pulpy mess, Alexi’s voice was little more than a grating rattle.

“Didn’t make it. Ankles… achilles sliced to shit. She fell down crack.”

Nia just stood there, letting her head lull back, and let out a forlorn wail into the sky. One of transparent despair and indignance at this reprobate world. One I felt all too closely.

I remember looking into the ice, and seeing torn flesh dangling from a Boreworm’s mouth. Dull pink smudges carried through the ice as they tunnelled.

A while later, two or three weeks at a guess, her rebirth began. It seems that whenever this happens, they aren’t too far away. Thirty feet, tops. I don’t wanna jinx it. Maybe it’s luck. More likely, it’s just how this place works. I dream sometimes of being reborn from the ice, only to fall out rigid and lifeless. But all we get are failed miscarriages.

Very, very dark. I almost sympathise with the author. I don’t want to believe it, I’d like to just pass it off as a testament to human creativity. Yet at the same time, is it better to be sure of true horror, or to leave questions unanswered, left to echo around in the edifice of unknowing? I’ll be thinking about that, for sure, though something in me leans toward the latter.

By tomorrow, I’ll have answers. Or so I hope. Until then, my modus operandi will be hammering out research, then sitting tight under a blanket.

Stay safe, out there.
