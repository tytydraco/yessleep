I was down hill from the juicer when it went over the edge, taking Jake with it. Dealing with a dead stander, getting ready to call the fall when I heard the yells behind me. It wasn't clear immediately what had happened -- whether it was operator error or the log road sloughed out from under the machine as he swung his boom, the only thing certain was the odds were very slim he was alive inside. Out of the corner of my eye through the second growth I could make out the what appeared to be the tracks of the machine, mangled and dissociated from the cab. The cab which contained Jake was further up. Dropping my saw and throwing off my harness and gear I sped towards the wreckage leaping over gnarled roots and downed logs, bounding off of fresh cut stumps. To my north the road crew tumbled down the hill in pursuit of the disaster. A flare fired overhead signaling mayday. We were hours away from camp, and camp was near a day away from a hospital. 

As I reached the first debris field I recognized the mangled metal without a shred of debt. The remnants of the brush guard that protects the operator from limbs and shards while yarding logs. Still bolted onto the roof plate armor -- removed from the cab itself, sheared off by a fir stump near 4ft wide. Jakes odds became even slimmer yet. The hours my friend may have had left alive rapidly dwindled into minutes. Turning to my left I descended the hill faster than my feet could safely manage. The crews now behind me had just reached the roof site. Judging by the cries and yells coming from them, they had arrived on the same conclusion I had. After what felt like an eternity I reached the cab. It was over turned with the emergency escape hatch impacted into another stump, the side door wedged against a log, and the exposed roof buried into the dirt. Hydraulic oil spewed from the engine bay and trickled out from the hoses that once connected to the tracks. 

And there he was. Strapped into his seat. Contorted. Now one with the machine.

"Jake!" I screamed, "Jake, can you hear me!"

I shoved my arm in through the frame of the cab and shook my friends shoulder, it was loose to the touch, it dislodged from it's horrific angle and fell to the side. Blood soaked the dirt below. When all at once my mind managed to associated what I was seeing. The odds of his survival were now zero. Jakes skull had been peeled off, leaving his lower jaw and tongue connected to his broken body. The brown fluid I regurgitated immediately after the realization was very clearly the only thing I'd had for breakfast, two cups of black coffee. I yelled to the crew above to stop. I begged them to stay-- to protect them from this horror I had seen. Three of them heeded my warnings. The forth did not. We sent for a stretcher from the first aid truck to lift his unconscious body back up the hill. I made the radio call, "bring the gas axe. we need to cut Jakes body free."

After a moment the crackle broke the silence, "relay. Gas axe on its way with rescue team. Confirm status. Over."

"It's a recovery, not a rescue, over."

"...understood. Over."

Two hours had passed, the sun now high in the September sky. It was getting warm. The base camp medical team arrived and with them, no equipment. 

"Where's the axe?" I asked.

"We um-- we-- aren't allowed to touch anything." a man 10 years my younger replied.

 "What do you mean?"

"We got news from Head Office on the island that we um-- we have to secure the site until insurance inspectors can arrive."

In an instant, my blood ran cold. The wind knocked right out of my lungs. A piercing sharp pain bore into my chest. I fell to the forest floor and wept. The med crew stood silently, watching. I gathered myself and asked "How long til they arrive?"

They looked at each other for a moment, arguing about who was going to break the news without speaking. The younger man then cleared his throat and said softly, "3 days."

"3 days!? Nothing takes 3 days!"

"The rest of the crew are coming up with wolf and bear defense gear, tents, everything you'll need."

I shook my head in disbelief over what I was hearing.

Here in the remote wilderness, isolated on the slopes of a mountain, with the 9 remaining logging crew, we must stand watch day and night until the suits can come decide who's paying the family of my dead friend Jake.

There will be no sleep.
