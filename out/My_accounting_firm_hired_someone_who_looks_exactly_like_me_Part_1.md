A few weeks ago, one of my bosses told me I'd be sharing my office with our newest hire.

I work a pretty boring bookkeeping job for a middle-of-the-road accounting firm. It's not my passion or anything, but my mom got me the job, and the pay is good, so I've stuck around for the better part of five years. When I first started working here, it was a lot more crowded than it is now, and they sort of shoved me into a corner desk in a small, multi-desk office space that was separate from the cubicles that occupied most of our rented office space.

At that point, I'd had maybe four or five other people in the room with me. They worked together more often than not—I think they were all part of a subdivision of the firm dedicated to a specific type of client, but I don't really know. I never paid much attention to them, because I preferred to spend my day with my headphones in. The sound of other people talking grates on me sometimes, when I'm trying to focus on other things.

Then we expanded the firm to a second office space, and they moved the team of four or five out, and I was pretty much left alone in an office designed for six people. It was nice—I liked the quiet, and it made me feel a little bit less guilty about how mediocre of an employee I'd always been compared to the people around me. I had a tendency to get distracted by my phone, or by some pop-up or other in the news bar of my computer, in the middle of the workday.

After that, they'd sat a few people in my office, but it was always a temporary position. I don't think I ever said more than a couple sentences to any of them; I never really felt the need to socialize, beyond basic introductions, and I started to realize none of them were ever going to last long anyway.

That's why it wasn't really strange to me to be sharing my space. Sure, it kind of annoyed me every time I had to sacrifice the quiet privacy of my lone position for a few weeks, but I was used to that by then. It wasn't like I had any power within the company to decide those sorts of things; my mom had been a partner at the firm at one point, but she hadn't worked there for just over a year by the time I'd been brought onto the team, so I couldn't exactly leverage her power.

The last Friday before my office was no longer my own, I prepared myself to be sharing the space by straightening out my desk—getting rid of a bunch of old post-it notes I no longer needed so it didn't look like I was a completely disorganized mess, and stuff like that. I spent the time getting some work done, since it was always harder for me to get things done when I felt like someone else could be hovering over my shoulder.

To be clear, it's not like anyone ever *was*. But the office was formatted somewhat strangely—nobody's computer monitors were ever quite private. Three people sat on each half of the room, with their backs fully facing the other half of the room. If I were to turn around, I'd have a perfectly clear view of whatever the person sitting in the corresponding spot on the other half of the room was working on.

At the very least, my monitors didn't face the windows that looked into the room from the hallway it was attached to, but I always ended up feeling a little paranoid when they sat someone in a space that could easily turn around and watch what I was working on, because half the time I wasn't really working at all.

I don't even think anyone ever looked. But *I* did. I was so worried about everyone else catching me, I looked over at them all the time.

I procrastinated on my work that day, too, so I'd have things to keep myself busy with for the first couple of days of cohabitation. The day before, some of my coworkers who worked in Admin came in to help set up the computer my new office-mate would be using, in the seat that reflected mine on the other half of the room.

I largely didn't think about my work situation on the weekend. I've always tended to keep my work and my personal life separate, so I spent Saturday and Sunday engaged in all my hobbies. I didn't really have any friends to talk to, and my sister (who I'm roommates with, though we don't live at our parents' house) works pretty long hours over the weekend at her service job, so I passed the time with art and music and general idling about my room. I tried not to scroll on social media too much, but I don't think I did a very good job.

About halfway through Sunday I took the trash out, and it was the only time I left my apartment that whole weekend. Someone was moving into the apartment across from mine—I could tell because their door was open, letting me see the half-furnished dining room of their apartment, whose interior layout seemed to mirror mine. I hadn't realized my neighbors were moving, but I'd never spoken to them anyway. I don't think I even knew what they looked like.

It made me sort of sad that there had been people whose door was less than ten feet away from me that I'd never spoken to. Not for the first time in my life, I wished I was better about actually interacting with the people who lived around me.

When I got back up to my apartment after tossing my trash into the dumpster, I could hear their footsteps on the tiled floor of the kitchen area through their open door. I thought about calling out to greet them, but in the end I didn't even turn around. Their door shut behind me as I put in the code to open mine, and I forgot all about the fact that I had a new neighbor within the hour.

I was ten minutes late to work on Monday.

My office was dark when I got there, so I knew before I could even properly see through the window that the new hire hadn't arrived yet. That suited me just fine, so I set my water bottle down on the table and shrugged my purse onto the floor beneath my desk, and started the arduous task of opening all the programs my firm insisted on using for keeping track of our work.

About thirty minutes in, the door to my office was pushed open by our secretary, Lucy. Since I could see someone standing behind her who I assumed must have been my new office-mate, I politely slid my headphones off of my ears and down around my neck.

"Hi, Sam!" Lucy smiled, offering her own brand of distant politeness. I offered a weak smile back, but I've never been very good at those sorts of things. "This is Alex. He's going to be working in here with you."

I was planning on responding to her, but the words never made it from my brain to my mouth; Alex had chosen that moment to step into the doorway from behind Lucy, and seeing him made my mouth go strangely dry.

To most people, he probably would have looked pretty ordinary. He had brown hair, which was cut slightly longer than you'd expect from a man in the accounting profession. He was dressed in an almost academic way that reminded me more of a librarian than an accountant, with a button-up shirt, professional work pants, and a sweater vest, with a set of thin, silver glasses on his face. He wasn't the most attractive person I'd ever seen, but he had a sense of composure about him that made him give off a very charismatic vibe.

And he looked just like me.

It took me a couple of seconds to register why I felt so odd about his appearance, but once it clicked, I obviously couldn't get over the fact that he had my exact face. And my exact haircut. And he looked like he was just about as tall as me. The only difference was that there was something far more masculine about the way he presented himself, in clothing and stance.

"Hi," he introduced, wearing a perfectly friendly smile. I was still struck dumb at this point, so I just nodded in greeting. He seemed to take that as a cue to keep talking, "I'm Alex. I'm joining the bookkeeping club."

The joke-but-not-a-joke made Lucy laugh, and it snapped me out of my surprised daze.

"Um, yeah," I replied. "I'm Sam. Nice to meet you."

I didn't point out that Lucy had introduced us already, so there wasn't any need for either of us to have shared our names. I just slid my headphones back onto my ears and returned to my work.

The rest of the day was filled with stolen glances behind me at Alex, getting himself comfortable with his new chair and his new computer and our firm's old, shitty software. Most of the day, our other, more experienced coworkers were in and out of the office, helping Alex get set up and showing him the ropes of our oddly-specific accounting setup. Most firms have their own way of doing things, and we were no exception.

I usually listened to music to drown out the noises everyone else in the room made, but I think the fact that the firm had just hired someone who was basically my identical twin sparked something curious in me. My headphones had a noise cancelling setting, but they also had a setting that basically let you hear your surroundings perfectly, and I spent the day with that switched on, trying to see if Alex would drop any hints about himself through conversations with our coworkers.

I didn't get much work done that day, and I didn't learn anything interesting either. Just that Alex was fresh out of college with a minor degree in Bookkeeping—so, probably about my age.

I was technically supposed to leave at 5, but I ended up clocking out at 4:30 because I knew I wasn't going to get any work done anyway. The drive back to my apartment felt rushed and frantic; in my first private moments all day, the strangeness of the situation really began to catch up to me.

Looking back, it should have also struck me as odd that nobody had even *commented* on how similar me and Alex looked. Almost everyone who worked with us had dropped by to greet our newest hire, and yet none of them took even a second to point out what seemed like the most obvious thing to draw attention to.

At the time, I'd just chalked it up to the fact that I never really talked to any of them anyway, so it wasn't like they'd had a reason to address me.

I called my mom the second I entered my apartment, slightly winded from the trip upstairs. It was later for her than for me, so I thought she might be at dinner, but when she answered on the first ring I couldn't hear any background noise.

"Hi," I said.

"Hi!" My mom replied, sounding about as cheerful as she ever did when I hadn't done anything to upset her that day. "You've been so quiet today!"

"Yeah." I was sort of halfhearted in my reply. I think my mom could tell, because she didn't immediately launch into asking me how my day had gone. "We had someone else move into the office, so…"

"Oh. How are you holding up?" She had always been sympathetic to the way I struggled with sharing my space.

"Um, fine. There was a lot of talking going on."

"I bet. What's their name? What are they like?"

"Alex," I answered. I wanted to tell her more, but the words couldn't seem to make their way out of my mouth. Besides, if I came right out and said that he looked just like me, she'd probably assume I meant we looked pretty similar, and I didn't want to drive the conversation in a weird direction. "He's fine. I guess."

"Well, he'll probably be out of there in a few weeks," my mom reassured me. I knew she was probably right, but for some reason it didn't make me feel any better to hear that, like it had when other people had temporarily been made to work in that office.

"I hope so," I admitted.

We talked for a little while after that about my day at work—what I'd gotten done, and all that. I ended up embellishing the day's achievements a little to hide the fact that I'd been too distracted prying into Alex's conversations to get much done, although I felt a little guilty about it, since the whole reason she'd started asking about my work was to make sure I wasn't floundering too much with my workload.

She ended up saying goodbye after around fifteen minutes of talking. I wasn't really ready to hang up, yet, but she always got tired of talking before I did. I didn't blame her. I never had anything interesting to say. Not that she'd want to hear, anyway; my hobbies didn't have much of an intersection with her sphere of knowledge, so the only thing we could ever talk about was work.

It still sucked.

The rest of the evening passed as it usually did. I microwaved a packet of dumplings that had been sitting in my freezer. I tried to do some art, but I'd been suffering from a nasty case of art block for the past several weeks, so I eventually gave up and turned to writing. I didn't get much of that done either, though, so the last two hours or so of my night were spent laying uselessly in bed, scrolling through meaningless posts and videos on my phone.

On Tuesday, Alex was at the office before me. He seemed like he was setting up his desk area when I walked in—there were a couple small boxes around his workspace, and the surface of his desk was currently adorned with a couple of small succulents that hadn't been there the day before. I took a peek at the boxes, and caught a glimpse of a couple other things—a file organizer, a pencil holder, and some other miscellaneous office essentials.

They were mostly brown and green.

My mood soured, though I knew I was being a little irrational for feeling annoyed. It was just that those were *my* favorite colors, and I'd always wanted to be the sort of person who had a cute office setup that reflected my personal taste. Seeing him unpack his things made me itch to buy my own, but I knew it'd look like I was copying him if I were to buy anything now, so I quickly batted the idea out of my head.

It reminded me a lot of when I was younger, and I'd always procrastinate taking showers until I could hear one of my siblings hogging the bathroom. Or how I'd put off doing laundry, and then get annoyed when someone else put a load in without knowing I was hypothetically supposed to do it that day.

Luckily, Alex didn't seem to pick up on the fact that his choice of decoration was annoying me.

"Hey," he greeted, in a tone that implied he was trying to catch my attention before I could get around to slipping my headphones on. "Do you think you'll have time today to show me how to do some of these clients?"

"What?" I asked.

"Sorry—there was an email," he explained. "I should have let you get set up before asking. My bad."

I didn't respond to him. Instead, I slid into my seat and booted up my computer. It was an old beast of a machine I'd had since my first day on the job, and it had probably been there since my mom and her old business partners had founded the firm. Practically everyone else in the firm had gotten an upgrade by now, but I was too worried about being a bother to ask for a better computer, so I had long resigned myself to dealing with the time it took to get anything powered on or opened. Even Alex had a newer computer than me.

When I'd finally gotten the computer turned on and my email opened, I spotted what Alex had been referring to. A single new email, sent only to me and Alex, from one of our firm's bookkeeping managers.

*Sam,*

*Would you be willing to train Alex on the following clients?*

*Thanks a bunch.*

Attached was a list of six clients I was responsible for. It seemed like a long list of clients to give to a newcomer, especially if he'd be getting some of everybody's work like what had happened with the bookkeepers in the past, but I had never been part of that client-sharing process before so I didn't really know the specifics.

Admittedly, I was kind of relieved. The clients that were being taken away from me were ones I tended to forget about when doing my end-of-month data entry, and I'd long felt guilty over having let some of them slip through the cracks for months at a time in the past. I typed out a quick reply affirming that I was alright giving those clients away (although it wasn't *really* a choice), then turned my chair to face Alex.

I almost jumped out of my skin when I saw his chair was turned to fully face me, like he'd been watching me the whole time. It scared me more than it should have—I knew he was probably just waiting for me to see the email, but I was still pretty shaken-up over the fact that we had the exact same face, so that didn't really comfort me much in the moment.

"Um," I said. "Are you busy?"

"Not at all. These are my first clients." He offered me a smile that I thought looked a little sheepish. If he were someone else, I might have thought there was some kind of awkward charm about him. As it was, I couldn't help reading his demeanor as a little sinister, even though there wasn't anything unusual about the way he was acting. "I'm a pretty quick learner. It shouldn't take too long."

"Okay," I said, because I wasn't sure how to respond.

I ended up moving my chair over to his side of the room so we could work on his newer, faster computer with the luxury of his larger and more high definition monitors. I was definitely more than a little jealous to see how crisp the nondescript display of his default desktop background was, and how smoothly he was able to open our shitty software. Nothing even crashed.

It became clear pretty quickly that he was a better bookkeeper than me, but that didn't surprise me. I hadn't gone to college, after all; I wouldn't even be here if it weren't for nepotism.

We mostly talked about work-related things, but I tried to slip in a few personal questions, like I was just another nosy coworker trying to feel out the freshest face in the office and not his paranoid clone. I haven't ever been good at small talk, so every question felt like I was hitting the wrong notes during a piano piece, and I practically winced after every non work-related question I asked.

He didn't comment on my obvious floundering, though, and I ended up learning a few things about him.

Firstly: He'd gotten his degree in bookkeeping out of convenience. His real passion, he told me, lay in the arts, but there hadn't seemed like a point in pursuing a degree in those when it was just as easy these days to get lucky on the internet. Apparently he'd submitted both art and writing to local contests and won pretty significant prizes.

Secondly: He didn't have family in the area because they'd moved away when he'd moved into his college dorms. He had a mother who he was on good terms with, and a couple of siblings who were still in the area that he talked to often.

And, finally: He didn't have a girlfriend. Or a boyfriend. He apparently wasn't into the idea of relationships at all; he said he'd tried dating a few times, exploring both avenues, but that he just didn't have his heart into it. He assured me that he was perfectly happy with the friends he'd made, the number of whom was apparently quite high.

Up until this point, I've mostly steered clear of talking about myself. I honestly don't really like doing that, because I know it makes me sound like a pathetic shut-in, and I'm just genuinely not comfortable enough in my own skin to put myself out there in that kind of way. Even in a mostly-anonymous setting like this. But I don't think I could do my reaction any justice without telling you a lot about myself.

I'm a 22 year old high school dropout. I have an attention disorder and an anxiety disorder, and I got halfway through assessments for autism before I decided they were more trouble than they were worth and decided it didn't matter. Likely for these reasons, I was a really shitty student, even though I was pretty good with the memorization aspect of things. I actually have a talent for the data entry aspect of the bookkeeping job, but my heart isn't really in it.

I'm an aspiring artist and writer, but I'm not very good at either, in the sense that I'm not very creative. I don't see pictures in my head, and I don't think I'm capable of having a genuinely original idea no matter how hard I try. Really, I've only ever accomplished things like fanart and fanfiction that don't rely on me coming up with original characters or plots or designs.

I've pretty much gone to online school my entire life, and I haven't kept up with any of my classmates, since I was too ashamed to poke my head into any of their post-graduation email threads after getting held back a grade and then dropping out. Both of my parents live out-of-state, and although I live with one of my siblings and about fifteen minutes away from another one, I almost never see them, let alone speak to them.

And I'm not the dating type, either. I've tried dating apps before, but I just can't get behind the idea that I should be happy to start a relationship with someone I don't know well enough to be friends with first. I even think I'd only agree to date a friend so I don't end up living alone for the rest of my life.

All that having been said, I'm sure you've probably realized that while Alex's answers didn't reflect my experiences perfectly, they seemed almost perfectly tailored to make me envious.

The more he talked about himself, the more I felt queasy, like something wasn't sitting right in my stomach. I genuinely had to stop asking him questions after a certain point, because hearing his answers made me feel like shit. It wasn't even like he was that much more successful than I was, but something annoyed me about the fact that he seemed so *confident* in everything he talked about. Here was someone who worked in my field and shared my hobbies, except he'd done things with his life. And he was sitting across from me, taking six of my clients I hadn't even wanted to work on in the first place—but I started to feel angry about the fact that he was taking them, and the fact that he was there at all.

Despite a general sense of dread that lingered with me after I finished showing him around those clients, the interaction had me feeling fired up in a very desperate sort of way. It sounds silly in retrospect, but at the time, I was honestly more concerned about losing my job than anything. I'd gotten it into my head that Alex, with his confidence and his better bookkeeping skills and his masculinity, was probably going to take my position in the firm.

And, honestly, I'll be the first to admit he probably would have deserved to.

I've made reference to this fact already, but I was a shitty employee. I still *am* a shitty employee. I procrastinate on all my work so I don't get more things piled onto my plate. I spend half the day scrolling social media on my garbage work computer. It was just such a small firm that I'd never been in danger of losing my job before, because they'd never needed to hire another bookkeeper to manage things.

I got more work done that day than I think I've ever gotten done in my life. I even stayed *late*, a fact I hadn't actually registered until I felt a tap on my shoulder.

It was the second time that day Alex had made me jump. I slipped my headphones off, taking note of the fact that he'd shut his computer off.

"You heading out anytime soon?" he asked. I glanced around, confused, until I noticed that the light in the hallway was off. It was activated by motion, so that usually didn't happen unless it was after-hours in the office, at which point it switched to manual. I turned back towards my computer to look at the clock.

Startled, I blurted, "Oh, *fuck.*"

It was 7:30. I don't think I'd ever stayed that late in my life until just then.

I heard Alex chuckle quietly behind me as I hurried to close out of the files I still had open and shut down my computer. I expected him to make his way out, but I knew he was still standing there because I couldn't hear his footsteps, and there was a slight pressure on the back of my chair that suggested he was probably leaning over it.

The quiet dread I'd felt earlier began to creep back in, and I made an effort not to look back at him. I hated being watched, but it wasn't like he had any way of knowing that, and I didn't exactly have anything to hide at that point—I really was just so in-the-zone I'd forgotten to look at the time.

"You don't have to stick around," I said, midway through the process of saving a particularly large excel sheet. "My computer takes a while with this stuff."

"I don't mind," Alex assured. "I think we're the last two people in the office. I figured we could at least go out to the parking lot together."

I didn't respond to that, so he pressed on, "It's dark outside."

I was actually afraid of the dark, but he was probably saying that because of the way I looked. Despite that we were practically identical, there was one clear trait setting the two of us apart.

It was a very considerate gesture, all things considered, but I couldn't bring myself to be comforted by the idea of being alone with Alex in an empty parking lot. The idea that he'd try to hurt me—or worse—wasn't even on my mind. Being around him just carried a very uncomfortable feeling with it.

It's a little difficult to explain why, but if you've ever been friends with someone who was better than you at one of your hobbies, you probably have a little bit of a basis for how I was feeling at that moment. Most people find it fun to have people who they can share their hobbies with, but it can be difficult to get close to people who just have more of a talent for something than you. I ran into this sort of problem whenever I tried to make friends with other people on the internet who did art; you start to feel a little invisible, when someone who outshines you is standing right next to you.

That was sort of what I felt when I thought about walking downstairs next to Alex. It was even becoming difficult to continue sharing the room with him, because the longer I dwelled on the feeling the larger the pit in my stomach got, and the more I was irrationally certain that if I walked downstairs with him, I would disappear completely.

But he hadn't done anything wrong. He hadn't even given the slightest indication that he even looked down on me. He'd talked to me more than any of the other people who'd sat in his chair and set themselves up in his space ever had.

"Okay," I said, and watched as my computer powered itself up. I grabbed my purse from its usual spot on the floor.

"You've got good style, by the way," Alex commented, giving my outfit a once-over.

The compliment made me blush—not because I was flustered, but because I was embarrassed he'd even mentioned it. Anyone looking at the two of us probably would have said that Alex dressed better than I did, with my too-loose shirt and my too-loose cargo pants and my too-loose sweater. I wanted to tell him I'd kill to have his style, but those kinds of things just never looked good on me. I even still had a pair of work pants I'd bought in a flight of fancy rotting at the back of my closet.

"Thanks," I mumbled. "Let's get out of here. It's creepy at night."

He laughed. "Yeah. I know. I got out late yesterday."

That didn't surprise me.

As soon as we were out of the office door, he kept an even pace with me, and leaned in to whisper conspiratorially, "The dark kind of freaks me out."

The feeling of disappearing returned in full force, and I squeezed my eyes shut for all of two seconds trying to force it to go away. At the time, I thought I was being stupid and ridiculous by feeling that way; just because we had something in common didn't mean he was somehow taking that thing away from me.

"Me too," I admitted. "I've never been in the office this late."

"I kind of figured," he said. "No offense. I'm not judging, or anything. Love a healthy work-life balance."

That was another thing that unsettled me about Alex. Even though he made me feel an insidious type of dread I'd never felt before, if I were another person, I probably would have considered him genuinely nice to be around.

"You'll get over the work after a week," I fired back. "They're pretty lax here. No-one expects you to do overtime, or anything."

"It's good to make a nice first impression." We'd made it to the stairs, by now. I figured he'd probably make it down faster than me, but as we descended, he kept a perfectly even pace. "The job market is rough these days. I want to have a job I can keep for a while."

I kept my gaze firmly fixed on the floor. It's not even worth reiterating what kind of thoughts that sent through my mind.

"Yeah," I said. "Well."

There was no end to the sentence, and we made the rest of our walk into the parking lot in tense, uncomfortable silence that I was sure Alex wasn't even aware of. There were only two cars left—a pristine hatchback, and my embarrassingly dirty sedan. It hadn't rained in three weeks, but my car was covered in the dried evidence of a storm that I just hadn't gotten around to getting washed off.

"Have a good night!" Alex called, as I was getting into my car. I offered a weary smile in response.

I was first out of the parking lot, eager just to get home and have my own space. The drive home passed by in kind of a blur; it was later than I usually drove home, so the road wasn't very crowded, and I could afford a little inattention.

The events of the day were catching up with me, like they'd done during my drive home yesterday. Now that I wasn't in a room with Alex, I let myself go over the facts of the situation without having to worry about getting work done or failing to react to something he said. It was only at this point that I began to consider the situation creepy in a supernatural way, rather than creepy in a regular way.

I mean, what were the chances someone who looked *exactly like me* showed up at my place of business and just so happened to have the life I wanted most? The more I mulled it over with the quiet sounds of the radio as my comfort, the more I started to think Alex couldn't be anything other than some kind of supernatural creature.

It sounds borderline insane that it took me so long to come to that kind of conclusion, but I think most people who aren't already obsessed with the paranormal and all that would probably have reacted the same way I did. I didn't live my life thinking that some kind of shape-shifter was going to walk into the office one day. I didn't even really believe in the supernatural beyond thinking it might be cool for ghosts and such to be real.

But I wasn't stupid. I'm *not* stupid. I'd read plenty of stories like this before. Once the thought occurred to me, I was absolutely certain there had to be something out of the ordinary going on with Alex.

As I was pulling through the gate of my apartment complex, I resolved to spend the rest of the evening googling all kinds of supernatural creatures to try and see if there was any overlap between any of them and whatever was going on with Alex. I hadn't even thought about what I would even do with that knowledge, if something caught my eye. I just knew I'd feel safer knowing.

It was then that I noticed there was a car pulling into the complex behind me as I made my way down its short main street towards the units in the far-back. Its headlights weren't especially bright, so when I turned right to park in my assigned space, I caught a brief glimpse of the car in my rear-view mirror.

It was Alex's hatchback.

I could practically feel the color draining from my face. My first thought was obviously that he must have been stalking me—I genuinely felt like kicking myself for not paying attention on the way home. I probably would have thought to at least take a few unnecessary turns before getting back on my usual drive home, or even headed to my brother's apartment.

As it was, I steeled my eyes straight forward and parked in my assigned spot, shutting my car off immediately but keeping the doors locked. I watched as Alex's car slid into the empty parking space two spots down from mine.

I peered in his direction as he got out of his car, putting his hands in his pockets to lock it remotely while he was walking away. His gait was faster than it had been when he was walking next to me, or at least I was fairly sure it was. He was heading directly towards the staircase that led up to my unit and the unit across from me. The petrified, clammy feeling spread to my whole body as I watched him disappear behind the solid backing of the stairs.

I must have waited in my car for a full five minutes. Then, I made what I even knew at the time was a really stupid decision. I grabbed my key fob from the outer pocket of my purse, grasping onto the spare key to my brother's apartment. In my other hand, I clutched my phone, navigating to the keypad. I hadn't seen him come back down, so if he tried to rush me when I got up the stairs, I'd run and call the cops.

I was shaking like a leaf as I made my way towards my apartment. I tried to be quiet, but the evening was quiet enough for my footsteps to echo in the empty complex anyway. If he was still outside, he could definitely hear me making my way cautiously and slowly up the stairs.

I didn't see him until I was almost all the way up. He was standing, facing the door across from mine, one hand resting slightly above the keypad to punch in his door code. When I was close enough, he turned his head towards me, and I froze.

"Huh," he said, as if he was genuinely surprised to see me there. "Small world, I guess."

Then, like no time at all had passed since I'd watched him get out of the car, he punched in the four-digit code to the door and let himself into the apartment.

I stood there on the stairs feeling far too cold for the weather for what felt like forever. I was absolutely certain he'd known it was me he was following; he'd left the parking lot right behind me, and the water stains on my car made it uniquely identifiable. And then he'd stood there, for upwards of five minutes, outside the door to what was evidently his apartment.

It was like he'd wanted me to see it was him who lived across from me.

As soon as that thought crossed my mind, I bolted the rest of the way up the stairs. It took me two tries to get my door code right—I was still shaking pretty badly. As soon as I managed to get the door open, I practically threw myself through, wincing at the sound of it slamming behind me as I closed it with all the force I had. I'd never turned the lock with that much urgency.

"You okay?"

I flinched, but relaxed soon after. It was my sister; she'd opened the door to her room while I was still settling down from my panicked state, and was looking at me with obvious concern.

I wanted to tell her what was going on. I'm not just saying that for the sake of saying it—I felt the words welling up inside my throat, ready to explode out of me in a manner that wouldn't have been remotely comprehensible the first time around. But it felt, almost, like a dam had been placed between my brain and my mouth.

I genuinely could not get the words out. I stood there, breathing heavily, for a few seconds.

"Fine," I answered, voice wavering. "I'm fine."

The fact I couldn't bring myself to talk about it was my tipping point. I was suddenly desperate to avoid further questioning, so I made a beeline for my room, shutting the door behind me with deliberate softness, as if to counteract the way I'd entered the apartment.

By that point, I'd completely forgotten to look into supernatural shape-shifters. But I honestly didn't do much of anything that night, including getting sleep.
