"What do you want with me?” I scream the ghost of my hand forming into a fist in my mind. "You've taken everything, my wife, my children, my fucking arm. Why? What did I do to you? You monster I Should've killed you when I had the chance”. Days, weeks, months pass maybe even years. I lost track of time, I have no idea as I wake up in this putrid cage filled with dirt, piss and vomit. I hear the cellar door open, a gun shoved to my beaten back as I turn around prepared for another day. Total darkness, a blessing and a curse, this bag over my head and it’s time for work. Pulling it apart, smashing it like flour over and over again down the conveyor belt. After the hours go by I barely feel my own hand. My plastic stick of a right hand only useful when I’m to tired to keep working. Hours go by and the bag is serenating my face again, the cloth my homestead the treachery of starting the day but the blessing of ending my shift. Did I do this to myself, what did I do to deserve this? Days and days go buy and only the sound of my fellow coworkers with tears down their eyes, the only seconds I have to look up before getting forced back to work. Mr. Wellers, I only knew him for a second and the next I saw him beat my wife, my poor Jayne. That monster bragging about the blood he just spilled. He turns to me with a smirk upon my face, “just another cattle for the butcher won’t you say”. My tears flooded my eyes, my veins feeling like they could pop. My innocent boy lying there staring at me with empty eyes and vanishing breath. I’ve lost everything to that monster.



This smell I could call it home at this point, my own shit in the corner of the room. I can’t tell you the last good meal I had, my food always covered with the dirt I could call my bed. Gerald blind as a bat older than me on the other side of the cell always holding tight onto the silver bracelet his wife always wore. Weaker than a dangling twig but somehow still hanging on to the tree. I wonder what pushes him, what pushed me to keep on living? A loud thud can be heard as the deep voice at the end of the hall screams, “lights out”. Everything sinks into silence, an abyss of all the dreams and life we once thought about in bed. The worries about tomorrow’s work all gone away. Only the thought of our loved ones, our life we lost, our own comfortable bed and our own clean clothes flood our minds. As the thought floods the mind of every person down the cell filled halls, a soft sob of millions, echoes down the hall. A symphony to the devil but a masquerade to those who have lost everything. I join quietly, same with my cellmates. The thoughts of my wife, my son fill my every thought as I wish to dream of them that night. Weeping in silence, I lay asleep in the corner of my cell filled with anger and loss-molded for bitterness and revenge. Another day, another night.



Lights flick on, the buzzing of the single bulb outside our cell starts ringing in the back of my dirt covered ear. My body aching from the pain. I turn up to see Gerald and with a mumbled reckoning we greet each other with a refrained “hey” as to make sure we’re both in this shit hole together. We hear the footsteps of the guards walk down the hall and one by one the cells, far to close open and groans of poor souls shower the halls, and the triumph calls of captures erupt after.  Our cell opens with a loud creak, “Turn around!” commands the guard, slowly we rise up from our bed made from a single bug infested mattress and blanket on the floor now. That mattress, the resting place of bugs and hope, oh how I long for the end of the day.  The soft thuds of the guards’ boots echoes the cell as he approaches us. In an inhumane way, like a piece of meat a butcher stuffs into a bag, my head is engulfed. This bag over my head, but as I get forced out with a gun behind my head I notice something.  Through all the grunts and screams, I didn’t hear our guard get near Gerald. Not an order of any kind, not the usual grunts he lets out after getting blinded by the bag. Only one person left the cell that day and Gerald wasn’t there when I got back.



A lonely cell, another day. Its rather lonely without Gerald to accompany me through the sorrow and through the pain. We both believed in a chance, a hope that one day something might happen, someone might rescue us, a friend, a sister, a brother might come looking for us. Having someone here made that bearable, even if to join with sobs in silence. Feeling forced to be an object, a machine just meant to work, someone there to bear the pain alongside you, makes you feel more human, makes you feel more sane. I need to rest. Another day, another night.



I think…. I think I saw the silver bracelet, down the conveyor belt stained with red blood, hidden in fresh meat to pound.



Drip…drip….drip…drip….what time is it? What day is it? What month is it? What year is it? Am I asleep? Is this a dream? Where’s my wife and son? WHERES JAYNE GODDAMNIT?! A flashlight blinded my eyes, “shut up” commanded the guard. I quietly mumble a smirky remark back to him, I hide under my deteriorated blanket wishing this to all be over. I can’t cry anymore, tears just won’t leave my eyes even after scratching them for hours. How can a human not cry? I begged and begged for the answer. How can I yearn to cry but no tears can be formed. Am I the monster? What have I become? I miss the life I lost. I miss it every second of whatever my existence is. A limbo of pure pain and servitude….



I’m sorry I can’t shed tears for you my love, my Jayne. I’ll get out I promise. I’m sorry my tears ran out son. I’ll kill the monster that caused this.



A rush of screams surface down the cold hallway, a slur of demands and orders. Soon after a single gunshot is heard, then a wave of gun sounds plummets down the halls after. The sound of a thousand little thunderstrikes cloud your mind, and a sweet little boy hiding under his blanket is all you could want to be. A passing moment of this war right down the hall around the corner gets suppressed by the now roaring sound of the sirens all across the factory. Red lights flashing through the halls but a shadow down the hall is running away from the gunfire around the corner. Checking the cells every other on, turning around frantically and soon stopping in front of mine. A silver key reflecting the light from down the hall, I instinctively start turning around expecting a bag around my face. The cell door closed and the lock turning and clicking echoing down the hall. Heavy breathing can be heard on the other corner of the cell in the same place Gerald would sleep and cry for his wife. I turn around staring at my new guest arriving abruptly at the only place I could call mine. I noticed the trail of blood that followed his footsteps.



A grunting man slowly states “go to sleep, nothing to see here”. I recognize that voice. Every second, every minute every scream my wife and son echo in my mind. Their death floods my mind, and the joy he had in his voice, that same voice. I walk slowly to him and with the flashing of the siren light out my cell, his face shines red with anger and disgust. I let out a anguish scream, with every fiber of my soul, with every fiber of my beaten flesh. Filled with hatred and a crazed haze I see red, the different hues of his blood splatter across the dirty mattress Gerald used to sleep. Screams of pain were masked with my own screams of hate, of triumph. I hear the pleads, grunts and begging to stop but I don’t listen. I can’t stop now, I won’t stop. I feel his flesh, I feel his life drain away through my hands. I feel my wife and son cheering me on behind me and I feel relieved. I laugh at the image bestowed upon me. A single shot fired in a last second attempt to stop me, I don’t feel pain but I hear something crack. I turn to see my wooden arm the same arm he put on me, broken with just a splintered spike in its place. I turn around quickly, like a animal fearful that his prey could escape, I swipe his gun away and with a ravingly scream I say the horrid thoughts I would conjure up in my dreams. “You deserve this, you deserve to die, you monster, burn in fucking hell”. I punch and punch and kick I wont stop I wont let him leave. I pluck his eyes, I break his legs, I take my wooden arm and plunge my broken pointed splintered arm through his skull. This present from god, oh…oh how I cherished it. Another day, another night.



I don't think I should be this happy seeing his bones puncture his body, exposing their color to the wind in the air, but a sense of relief shows in my smile. I can finally feel a sense of achievement overcome my aching body. The bullet storm has ended while in my crazed haze. Everything fell silent for a second it felt the only thing echoing down the halls are the cries and grunts pleading to stop from this monster who rightfully deserved it. Footsteps are heard quickly and pleads of help masking them, till the pleads end and the flashlights grow closer. The swat team came in, their faces masked with horror, their eyes widened at the scene. They took me out, forced me to comply and I gladly do. I killed Mr. Wellers; I took revenge for everything he did to me my family, to Gerald and his. He paid for what he did.



Three years in that cage eating my own feces, drinking my own piss, dreaming of the day I'd be free. I've never killed anyone and much less had the need to, but this monster had finally let his guard down, whichever god there is had finally answered my prayers. Restless nights begging for this moment to happen the moment he'd get to close. Tears overcome my face and in my fall of victory I pass out.



I’ve just been released, about two months now since I got through all the police cells and interrogations. No, I didn’t serve any time, it was all in self-defense. The truth is though, I no longer want to live. I’ve lost my family; I’ve lost the house no one wants to be around someone who was presumed dead for three years. My family sees me as a monster for the things I did in that factory. I don’t regret it at all but I want to be with my wife and boy. I’m posting this here to share my story, my truth that no one would believe me. No one wants to believe monsters like that exist even if the facts are there, everyone blames me for being the monster who enacted revenge. Thank you, goodnight, and let me rest alongside my wife and son.  My arm is gone, my wife is dead, my breath is soft, the factory is dead. Another day, another night.
