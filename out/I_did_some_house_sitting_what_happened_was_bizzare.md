I’ve always been a drifter.

I backpacked across India at 22, lived off-grid in British Columbia at 25, and by 30, I’d landed a house-sitting gig in Arizona. Quiet town. Dry air. Free rent. All I had to do was keep the plants watered and make sure the solar generator stayed topped off.

The house belonged to a woman named **Sabine**. She was a spiritualist, big on energy fields, sound baths, and “star being communication.” Her home was exactly what you’d expect—desert crystals on every windowsill, pyramids made of copper wire, hieroglyphs printed on silk tapestries. It looked like a cross between a yoga studio and an Egyptian burial chamber.

I didn’t think anything of it… at first.


I found a handwritten note tucked into a drawer:

> “If Ra opens the sky tonight, do not acknowledge Him. Close your eyes. Let Ma'at judge your heart.”

I thought it was a poem. Probably something Sabine wrote high on mushrooms.

But that night, the sky did something I’ve *never* seen before. A **beam of golden light**—like a spotlight, but...wrong. It had this undulating quality, as if it were *breathing*. I stared up, half asleep, and I *swear to God*, I saw **an eye** inside it.

The next morning, I told myself I dreamt it.


Things started to go missing. Not valuables—**symbolic things**.

* The feather from Sabine’s Ma’at altar? Gone.
* Her little statue of Thoth? Shattered.
* Her “third eye oil”? Spilled in the shape of an ankh.

I Googled the symbols. Ancient Egyptian, yeah. But she’d layered them with **new age stuff**—chakras, starseed maps, even crop circle interpretations. It was like she’d built a **hybrid religion** around rebirth, judgment, and… visitors. Ones from "beyond the veil of light."


I heard music at 3:13 AM.
Not *playing*—**humming.** Like a thousand voices, off-tune, humming through the floorboards.

I followed it to the garage.

There was a door behind the water heater I hadn’t noticed before. Behind it: **stairs.**

The humming got louder as I descended.


The basement wasn’t a basement. It was a **chamber.** A shrine. Walls painted with **black sun disks**, **scarabs with human eyes**, and **chakras pierced by golden beams**.

Candles circled a raised dais, on which stood a glass sarcophagus. Inside… was Sabine.

Or at least, something **that looked like her**. She was floating, eyes open, smiling faintly.

There was **no water**, yet her hair floated around her face like she was underwater.

Above her hung a copper pyramid frame, buzzing. A voice entered my mind, like a whisper scraped across stone:

> “**Do you submit to Ma'at? Is your heart light enough to walk in Ra’s shadow?**”

I ran.


I booked a motel that night. The next morning, I drove back to grab my stuff and leave for good.

The house was **gone.**
Just **a blackened patch of desert.** Like nothing had ever been there.

I went to the town sheriff. He said no one named Sabine ever lived in that area.
Showed me county records—no such house. No deed. No permit. Nothing.

But I know what I saw.

I still hear the humming sometimes. Especially around 3:13 AM.

And sometimes I wake up with sand on my feet and a copper triangle pressed into my palm.


**If you ever see a woman in robes standing in a copper circle whispering about “aligning the stars within,”** run.

It’s not Reiki.

It’s judgment.

And if your heart isn’t light enough?

**They’ll find you anyway.**
