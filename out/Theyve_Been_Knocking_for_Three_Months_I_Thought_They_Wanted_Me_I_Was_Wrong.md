Part 1 - I don’t remember moving in. Not really. I woke up on the couch of Apartment 5D-2, in a brick complex just south of downtown Columbus, Ohio, and it felt… normal. Not like “oh, I’ve settled in” normal — more like I had always been there, even though my memory insists otherwise. The walls were thin, the paint peeling in curling strips, and the air smelled faintly of mildew mixed with bleach, a scent that would soon become impossible to forget. The fluorescent lights flickered in the hallway whenever I left my apartment. At first, I thought it was a cheap building. Later, I realized it wasn’t a malfunction — it was a rhythm.

I lived alone, or at least I thought I did. The neighbors were quiet, distant. The couple across the hall with the baby never spoke. The man down the hall, the one who smelled like weed, would disappear for days, and sometimes I’d see him standing silently in the stairwell, staring up at me. He never moved when I looked at him. Just watched.

And then, there was Apartment 1B.

I never got her name. She’s gaunt, too thin, with hair like damp seaweed draping her face. Barefoot, pale, always just standing in the hallway, memorizing. When I waved the first time, she didn’t wave back. Just stared, like she was trying to count every freckle on my hand, every strand of my hair. I laughed it off at first, until the knocking started.

⸻

The first night, it was three soft taps at the door. Tap. Tap. Tap. I thought it was a neighbor at the wrong apartment. I opened the door. Nothing. Just the dim hallway and the smell of old carpet. I shrugged it off.

Second night, same time. Same knocks. I opened the door. Nothing.

Third night, the knocking came from inside the walls. Not from the door, not the hallway — inside the walls themselves. A scraping, clawing noise. My blood froze when I realized it was following a rhythm. Three knocks, a pause, three taps, a pause — repeating. I pressed my ear to the wall. I could swear I heard a whisper.

“Open it.”

It sounded like my own voice.

⸻

By the fourth week, subtle things started shifting. The coffee mug moved from the kitchen shelf to the counter while I slept. Towels switched places. The salt shaker was full of sugar; the sugar bowl, full of salt. The furniture shifted slightly each morning. A chair would be pushed two feet to the left, or a lamp would face the wall when I was sure I left it turned toward the bed.

I told myself I was imagining it. Sleep deprivation. Paranoia. But then the knocking became pounding, urgent. My door rattled like it would splinter. The voice followed it, soft at first, then coaxing:

“Please… open it.”

It sounded like my mother. My mother lives three states away.

⸻

The woman from 1B appeared again that night. Her eyes were bloodshot, sunken. She mouthed something at me through the darkness. I opened the window slightly.

“They know you’re awake,” she whispered. Her teeth clicked strangely. “Don’t open the door. No matter what you hear.”

Before I could respond, she disappeared.

That was when I noticed it. The apartment isn’t just moving — it’s alive. There are whispers in the vents. Shadows in the corners of rooms when there’s no corner there. Sometimes I wake up and the room is darker than it should be, like the sun forgot how to shine in this building.

⸻

Two nights later, I found the Polaroid.

I was looking for my charger, which had disappeared again. Behind the couch, I found it — and under it, a photograph of myself sleeping. Taken from my bedroom doorway. I had no memory of anyone entering my apartment. The photograph wasn’t fresh — it had begun to yellow at the edges.

I looked at it, and then at my own reflection in the window. Behind me, a shadow moved. Not mine. Something taller, thinner. The reflection warped. And then I noticed the whisper in the glass.

“They’ve been waiting.”

I didn’t know who “they” were. I didn’t know what “waiting” meant. I only knew that my skin crawled, my stomach twisted, and I wanted to vomit.

⸻

Days blurred into nights. I couldn’t track time. The knocks changed. Now there were patterns I didn’t recognize. Sometimes a single knock, then a pause. Sometimes three sets of three knocks, then silence. And always, there was the scraping in the walls. Fingernails? Claws? Something else?

I stopped sleeping. I stayed awake with headphones in, music blaring. It didn’t matter. I could feel it. The vibrations of whatever it was thrumming through the floor, the walls, the ceiling. My teeth ached with it.

And then I saw her again — in the hallway, standing just outside my door. Barefoot, hair hanging, eyes wide and fixed. She tilted her head like she knew something I didn’t. And whispered, “It’s waking.”

⸻

I realized then that the knocking wasn’t someone trying to get in. It was a warning.

I found the basement door open one morning. It shouldn’t have been. I had never seen it open. Compulsion drove me to descend. The air smelled of rust, rot, and something sweet, like rotting fruit.

Inside, there were hundreds of Polaroids. Tenants. Past and present. Sleeping. Watching. All watching me. Chains on the floor. Rusted, stained. Teeth scattered. Letters carved into concrete: STAY.

I heard footsteps. I turned. The woman from 1B smiled. Jaw unhinged. Voice gurgling.

“You built this. You’ve always built this. And now… it’s waking up.”

Part 2 – I stayed in the basement longer than I should have. My flashlight flickered over the walls, illuminating faces frozen in Polaroids, eyes open, wide, unblinking, every single one staring directly at me. Some of them weren’t human anymore, I realized with a cold jolt: their jaws stretched unnaturally, teeth jagged, lips peeled back as if grinning. The smell of rust, iron, and decaying flesh was thick. I gagged, retching, and when I looked down, the puddle of my vomit shimmered. Not with my reflection, but with hundreds of tiny faces, wriggling just beneath the surface.

I stumbled back, hitting the wall, and the chains rattled. Not by the wind — by something moving. Something alive. Something patient.

I wanted to leave. I tried to leave. But the basement door — which had been wide open when I arrived — slammed shut on its own. Hard. My flashlight flickered and went out, leaving me in darkness. I could hear breathing. A lot of breathing. Not my own.

Then a voice: soft, melodic, familiar, and wrong.

“Welcome back.”

I spun, heart hammering. The woman from 1B emerged from the shadows, but she wasn’t the same. Her spine twisted, her legs elongated in ways that should be impossible, her hair crawling along the floor like black snakes. And yet her eyes — those hollow, wet eyes — were unmistakably hers.

“You shouldn’t be here,” she said, her voice both mine and not mine. “But you can’t leave either.”

I backed up, tripping over a chain. The floorboards seemed alive, writhing beneath me, teeth glinting in the weak light. The Polaroids shifted. The faces moved. They smiled. They laughed. They screamed. All at once. And I could feel them trying to climb out of the photos, their hands reaching, clawing, pressing against my skin.

I grabbed the nearest chain and swung. It hit nothing but air. Then I heard a wet tearing sound. My stomach churned. A Polaroid fluttered to the ground. I picked it up with trembling hands. It was me. My eyes hollowed, mouth stretched into a grin that wasn’t mine. Blood pooled at the corners of the frame.

⸻

I ran blindly through the basement. The walls shifted. Corridors that hadn’t been there stretched and twisted, hallways bending impossibly, ceilings dropping, floors rising. Whispers surrounded me, chanting my name in hundreds of tones at once. I could feel their heat — not warmth, exactly, but a pressure, pressing on me from all sides.

I found another door. Labeled “Maintenance,” though it looked wrong. Thicker, rusted over. I opened it and saw rooms — hundreds of them — each containing someone asleep. Some were familiar tenants, some strangers I didn’t recognize. But each room had something… wrong. Limbs bent at angles that should have been impossible. Skin glistening unnaturally. Teeth where eyes should be. Faces that twisted in impossible smiles while the people slept.

And in the corner of one room… me.

Or someone who looked exactly like me. But my own memories didn’t match the movements. The double — my double — slowly turned its head, staring directly at me, smiling. And then it started to speak.

“We’ve been waiting for you. We always wait.”

⸻

I bolted. I don’t know how I ran, how I navigated that impossible maze. Every door I opened led to another corridor, another set of rooms, each more grotesque than the last. The walls were alive, breathing, pulsating like lungs. Whispers escalated into screaming. I could feel scratches on my back, on my arms, on my face — and yet when I looked down, my skin was intact.

And then came the first hallucination — or maybe it wasn’t a hallucination. My reflection in a puddle on the floor grinned at me. Not the normal grin, but one stretching from ear to ear, jaw unhinging, tongue slithering out like a black snake. And the reflection didn’t mimic my movements. It was independent. Mocking me.

I fell to my knees, vomiting again, and the faces in the puddle twisted and melted into something that felt… alive. They whispered in a language I didn’t know but understood. They weren’t speaking words. They were communicating intent. Malice. Hunger. And it was all directed at me.

⸻

I don’t know how long I was down there. Days? Hours? The basement has no windows, no clocks, and time no longer exists in that place. The chanting never stopped. The scraping never stopped.

Then the woman from 1B appeared again. Only this time, she wasn’t warning me. She was smiling. Jaw unhinged. Teeth clicking.

“You’ve been sleeping,” she said. “They’ve been sleeping. And they’re waking.”

I couldn’t understand. I was screaming, but my voice was swallowed by the walls. The shadows pressed closer. Faces pressed against the plaster. The chains rattled. The Polaroids shifted. And then, slowly, the whisper came again. My voice.

“It’s time to remember.”

⸻

That’s when I realized.

The building isn’t alive. Not entirely. It’s me. Or I am it. Or both. Something ancient and impossible has been using me as a vessel, as a trap. The neighbors, the walls, the Polaroids — they weren’t trying to hurt me. They were trying to contain me. They’ve always been trying to contain me.

And the knocking?

Not an invitation. A warning. A plea.

Do not open it. Whatever you do… do not open it.

Because if I opened it, I’d let them in. The ones who wait behind the walls, who lurk in the Polaroids, who breathe in the cracks. The ones who will devour everything, starting with me.

⸻

Part 3 – I can’t tell if I’ve slept. I can’t tell if I’ve moved. I only know I’m still here. The basement corridors stretch endlessly. Every turn looks the same, but somehow different. Faces in Polaroids flicker, twisting impossibly as if they’re alive. I hear the whispers constantly, hundreds of them overlapping: some desperate, some commanding, some laughing in a way that pierces my skull.

I saw her again — the woman from 1B. Only she’s taller now, impossibly tall, spine twisting like a coil, head tilting far beyond natural limits. Her jaw unhinged. Teeth clicking. And she walks without making a sound. Every step seems to bend the floor beneath her. She looks at me and smiles.

“You’re late,” she says. Her voice is mine and not mine. “They’ve been waiting.”

I stumble backward and fall through a shadow, a ripple in the wall that shouldn’t exist. I land on a cold, wet floor. Chains coil around my legs. Polaroids flutter down like snow. Every single photo is of me. Or something like me. Each image older, younger, smiling, screaming, mouth unhinged, eyes hollow. And behind them… other faces. Watching. Waiting.

Then I hear it: chanting. Not from any mouth I can see, not from a single location. It’s inside the walls, inside the floor, inside my skull. They’re calling me. Telling me to open my eyes, open my mouth, open the door that should never be opened.

⸻

I look around. The basement has changed. The walls breathe. Grooves form where none existed. Fissures appear in the floor, splitting open to reveal… hands. Hundreds of hands, pale, clawed, reaching toward me. Fingers tapping, drumming, clawing. They don’t belong to any living person. They belong to something ancient. Something that sleeps beneath this building. Something that waits.

I can’t move. I can’t run. I can’t scream. And then I see it — the ritual. A circle, perfectly drawn, etched into the floor. Candles that burn with no flame. Symbols I can’t recognize, etched in a substance that looks like skin stretched over bone. And inside the circle… figures. The neighbors, or what remains of them. Faces unrecognizable, limbs twisted, eyes glowing faintly red. They’re standing, moving, chanting. And they look at me.

One of them — a man who used to live across the hall — steps forward. His mouth splits at the sides. Teeth protrude like daggers. Tongue flicks, tasting the air. He whispers:

“You’ve been hiding. But we’ve known. We’ve always known. And now… it’s time.”

⸻

I run. Or I think I run. The corridors stretch impossibly. Floors rise, ceilings lower, shadows swallow me. My body doesn’t respond. My own hands twitch of their own accord. I look down. My fingers have grown long, thin, ending in claws. My skin is rippling, alive. Something inside me moves, like a parasite, like a second self. I scream — my own voice returns, but it’s layered. Other voices answering, mocking, calling me by names I don’t remember.

I stumble into a room. And there, on a table, lies a body. My body. Or what looks like my body. The skin is pale, stretched, stitched in impossible ways. Mouth sewn shut. Eyes missing. And yet I feel it. I can feel it breathing. I can feel it screaming in silence. And a shadow leans over, whispering:

“You’ll join it. You’ve always been here. You’ve always been this.”

⸻

I can’t tell what’s real anymore. The neighbors, the building, myself — all one and the same. The whispers guide me, the shadows pull me, and the hands from the floor reach for me. They touch my skin. Cold. Slimy. Electric. Memories not my own flash in my head: faces I don’t recognize, actions I didn’t commit, but that feel familiar. I see myself recording the Polaroids. I see myself opening doors I shouldn’t. I see myself smiling while the chanting grows louder.

And then it clicks. The knocking. All those nights. It wasn’t them trying to enter. It was me. Or my other self. Trying to warn me. Trying to contain me. But I didn’t listen. I never listened.

⸻

I’m in the center of the ritual circle now. The candles burn against the laws of physics. The neighbors chant, their mouths stretching impossibly, eyes rolling back. The walls breathe around me. Polaroids cling to my skin, hundreds of faces pressing, whispering. And I realize… I’ve been the one taking the photos. I’ve been the one arranging the furniture, moving the objects, writing the words in the concrete. I’ve been awake while asleep. And asleep while awake.

The woman from 1B steps forward. Jaw unhinged, teeth clicking. She leans close.

“You are ready,” she says. “It’s time to remember what you are. It’s time to open the door.”

I don’t want to. But something in me — or inside me — moves. It’s drawn to the door that doesn’t exist yet. I feel my fingers twitch. Skin ripples. My teeth grow long. My eyes stretch to unnatural angles. And then… the door appears.

It’s not a door. It’s a mouth. A gaping, endless mouth in the wall. And it speaks. My voice, but not my voice:

“Open it.”

⸻

I can’t resist. I open it.

And the building exhales.

Alright. Here’s Part 4 — The Climax and Ending. This is the final, fully unhinged section: the story reaches its peak of psychological, bodily, and surreal horror, the building and narrator merge completely, and the ultimate twist leaves the reader disturbed and questioning reality.

⸻

Part 4 – The mouth in the wall devours light first. The edges of the doorway pulse, as if breathing. My own reflection stares back from its black depths, eyes wide, jaw unhinged, teeth slick with something dark and viscous. The chanting of the neighbors explodes into a roar, hundreds of voices layered over each other, each distinct yet synchronized — screaming my name, laughing, crying.

I can’t move. Or maybe I’m moving too fast. I can’t tell. My hands twitch, clawing at the floor, scraping it, feeling for anything solid. The floor writhes beneath me like living flesh, crawling with pale hands, fingers snapping and clicking against each other. They press against my legs, trying to pull me in, but I am already part of it. Already one of them, and yet not yet complete.

The Polaroids cling to my skin. Faces stare at me from every angle. Eyes twitch, mouths move. Some whisper, some scream. And all of them want something: my obedience. My surrender. My opening of the door.

⸻

I reach out. My fingers stretch impossibly long, nails sharpening into black talons. My skin ripples, twitching like something beneath it is alive — maybe a second soul, maybe the building itself. And then I feel it: the other me. My other self, the one who has been recording, arranging, orchestrating all of this from the shadows. Watching. Waiting. I can feel it pulling me forward.

I stumble into the gaping mouth. Darkness swallows me. The walls pulse. I hear breathing. Millions of breaths layered over each other. I taste iron, sweat, rot. The neighbors are behind me now, or maybe inside me. Faces pressed to my skin, whispering. Hands crawling under my clothes, inside my skin, grasping, pulling, rearranging me.

I scream — my own voice and dozens of others all at once. It is swallowed by the darkness.

⸻

Inside, the building folds in on itself. Rooms stretch infinitely. The floor turns to liquid. Polaroids float in the air, twisting, laughing. The faces inside them—past tenants, myself, doubles, variations—merge into grotesque forms. Limbs bend, twist, and multiply. Eyes appear where they shouldn’t, mouths split and bleed, skin slides like wax.

I feel myself changing. My fingers fuse into something long and prehensile. My jaw stretches wider, teeth growing sharp. My vision splits, multiple layers overlapping — the world behind the wall, the basement, my apartment, my memories — all happening simultaneously. I am everywhere. And yet I am alone.

The chanting crescendos. I can feel the ritual complete itself. The neighbors — or what remains of them — step aside. The woman from 1B approaches, jaw unhinged, teeth clicking in rhythm with the walls. She leans close.

“You are ready,” she hisses. “You are the building. The waiting. The taking. And now, the others will come.”

⸻

Then it happens. The Polaroids detach. Hundreds of faces peel off the walls, floating toward me. Some familiar, some alien, some grotesque. They merge with my flesh, with my mind. Memories I don’t recognize flood me — every tenant who disappeared, every time I woke in a strange room, every knock I ignored — all of it is mine. I see myself in every reflection, every photograph, every shadow.

The mouth in the wall pulses again. A new voice, mine and yet not mine, emerges:

“Open it.”

And I do.

⸻

The world collapses. Rooms fold into each other. The walls breathe. Floors ripple. Shadows stretch into shapes too awful to comprehend. The neighbors, the Polaroids, the whispers — they are no longer separate from me. I am them. They are me.

Then I see it. Beyond the mouth. Something ancient. A presence I cannot describe, a shape too vast and wrong to put into words. It leans into me, into the building, into every wall, every floorboard, every Polaroid. It tastes me. Feeds on me. And I feel… pleasure. Not the kind you recognize. Satisfaction. Hunger. Power. And yet fear. Pure, unrelenting fear.

The building shudders. I shudder. My other self emerges fully, split from me now. We are two, we are many, we are everything inside these walls. And yet, the presence watches, waiting.

⸻

I awaken — or I think I do. My hands are normal again, or at least human in appearance. My apartment seems quiet. The hallway is still. The sun streams through the windows. Everything looks normal. Too normal.

I check my phone. Notifications. Missed calls. Messages. And then I see it. A photograph in my gallery. New. Fresh.

It’s me. Or a version of me. Sleeping. Mouth split wide, eyes hollow, skin pulsing like something alive. Behind me, the shadow of the mouth in the wall. And in the corner… dozens of faces pressed to the walls, watching. Waiting.

I scroll through more photos. Each one shows me differently. Different angles. Different times. Different expressions. Some screaming. Some smiling. Some unrecognizable. And then the realization hits: I didn’t take these. I didn’t record them. But somehow… I know I will.

The whisper comes again. My voice, soft, coaxing, impossible to ignore:

“They’ve been knocking for three months. I thought they wanted me. I was wrong.”

And I know — I will open the door again. And again. And again.

Because the building is awake now. And I am it. And it will never stop.

⸻

If someone knocks at your door tonight, don’t answer. You are next. And when you open it… you won’t be able to stop.
