(Real Story)

It was my friend’s brother’s story. He was working for Uber and usually drove the night shifts. I don’t remember the exact time but it happened in 2014 he was driving in Powai (Mumbai suburbs), he received a request from Aarey Milk Colony he accepted it but to confirm the pickup he called the passenger cause the location was a bit unusual because it lead to one of the byways with dense tree canopies which aren’t lit with lamppost’s and really has an eerie environment around it, in the daytime it is with a decent traffic. As any Mumbaikar (Resident of Mumbai) may know that there are some policemen with barricades at entry checkpoints at night from both ends to restrict entry to residents only (People living in royal palms apartments or private bungalows), though the police presence isn’t always consistent.

He called the passenger, and a woman answered. In the background, there was a loud, rhythmic sound of machinery, as if she were in a factory. He asked, "Madam, ye location kaha ka hai? Zyada andar hai toh mein nahi aa paunga, aur police bhi hogi entry par" ("Madam, where exactly is this location? If it’s too deep inside, I won't be able to come, and the police might be at the entry.")

She replied, "Aap aajao bhaiya please, itni raat ko koi ride nahi mil rahi... aur police nahi thi jab mein aayi thi" ("Please come, brother. I'm not getting any rides at this hour, and there was no police when I came in.")

He agreed and drove to the coordinates. When he reached the spot, there was absolutely no one there—just an abandoned factory or workshop. He tried calling repeatedly, but there was no luck. He drove a bit further and saw a bulb lit in a guard cabin. He approached the security guard and asked if he had seen a woman nearby, explaining he had a pickup request, to which he replied “No”. He explained that he got a call from a woman and had loud machinery  sound  in the background. The guard wheezingly said “Usne tujhe bhi fasa liya kya yeh factory kaafi saalo se band hai” (She trapped you too? This factory has been closed for years). Listening this from the guard made him spooked without loosing any second he stepped his foot on the accelerator and drove as fast as he could, as he was driving towards the main road of aarey colony his phone began ringing incessantly from the same phone number shitting bricks even in his terror, he picked up no one spoke but he could hear the distinct sound of heavy machinery running in the background he hung up and the phone starts ringing again.

Just as he reached the intersection of the byroad and the main road, he nearly collided with another car. Both drivers slammed on their brakes, avoiding a crash by centimeters. The other driver stepped out, furious “Abe maderchod pagal hai kya turning pe itna tezz chala raha hai” (Motherfucker are you insane driving this fast at a turn).

The brother, drenched in sweat despite the winter chill and shivering with fear, gathered enough courage to say, "Bhai, andar mat jaa. Andar bhoot hai" ("Brother, don’t go inside. There is a ghost.")

The driver ridiculed him: "Chutiye, tune daaru pee rakhi hai kya? Yeh bhoot-woot kuch nahi hota" ("Stupid, are you drunk? There’s no such thing as ghosts.")

The brother asked him if he had received a call from a lady with the sound of machines in the background. The driver’s expression changed—he agreed that he had. The brother warned him one last time and sped away, He drove straight home, about 4km from Aarey colony. After explaining the whole event to his family, he suffered from a high fever for a week, quit his job shortly after and never tried to enquire.
