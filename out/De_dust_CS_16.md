They say Counter-Strike 1.6 is just a game.

Pixels, old code, dusty maps.

They say there’s no such thing as haunted data. No ghosts in abandoned servers.

They say a lot of things.

But I’m telling you—they’re wrong.

There’s a rumor, passed around on dead forums, whispered in LAN cafes that haven’t closed yet, or mumbled at 3 a.m. on Discord voice calls between guys too scared to admit they saw something.

It’s about a player named Liam Holloway.

And I swear to God, he’s real.

Liam was just like the rest of us. Another basement-sitting, energy-drink-chugging CS addict. But he had something different. Obsession. de_dust wasn’t just his favorite map—it was his world. He didn’t even play with others anymore. Just booted up a private server. No bots. No objectives. Just walking it. For hours. Days. Weeks.

Then, one night, he vanished. Not offline. Vanished.

No logout. No last message. His game was still running when they found his apartment, but he was gone. His PC was humming. The monitor showed an empty de_dust server. Just the desert map and nothing else.

Some say he finally snapped. Others say something darker happened.

I didn’t believe any of it.

Until it happened to me.










It was a Sunday night. 2:36 a.m. I was bored. Tired. But not sleepy. The worst kind of feeling.

I decided to boot up 1.6. Nostalgia fix.

I launched into de_dust. No bots. Just me. Running through the map like I always did when I needed silence. That hollow echo of my footsteps on the stone. The distant wind in the speakers. Comforting. Familiar.

Then something… shifted.

I noticed the lighting was off. It wasn’t the same sunny yellow I remembered. It had a bluish tint—cold, sterile. The kind of light you see in an empty morgue.

I stopped at Bombsite B. That’s when I noticed it.

The chat flickered.




" Player: Liam_Holloway has joined the game."






I didn’t type that. I didn’t add any players. My heart dropped into my stomach.

I spun my character around. Nothing. Empty.

I told myself it was a glitch. Maybe some plugin I forgot to disable.

Then I heard it.

Crunch.

Footsteps. Not mine. Close.

I stood frozen in front of the double doors. Slowly, I turned the mouse to the left corridor near CT spawn.

And there—half-hidden behind a crate—was a CT player model.

Still.

Staring.

He didn’t move. Just stood there in the shadows. Watching me.

I typed:

 
"Liam?”



No response.

Then, out of nowhere, my screen flashed—white static, like a VHS tearing. My headphones rang with sharp digital feedback, like distorted breathing.

I jumped so hard I nearly fell out of my chair.

The screen went black for a moment.

Then the game returned—but everything was darker. The colors were drained, as if the map had died and no one bothered to bury it.

And Liam… was gone.

Or so I thought.


I ran through the map, panic rising in my chest. Every turn felt wrong. I’d walked this map thousands of times, but now the hallways felt longer. Endless. The skybox above looked like it was sinking, like the sun was collapsing.

I tried to quit. Esc. Alt+F4. Ctrl+Alt+Delete.

Nothing worked.

The game wouldn’t let me leave.

Then the whisper came.

Through my headset. Barely audible.


 “You shouldn’t be here.”



I stopped moving.

The sound wasn’t in the game. It was in my ears. Inside my head.

Suddenly, a blur darted across my screen—right in front of me. A CT model lunging from behind a corner and disappearing just as quickly.

No sound. No footsteps. No bullets.

Just movement.

And then—BOOM.

My screen exploded in red. Not blood. Not graphics.

Real red. Raw, fleshy red, like something living had pulsed through the monitor and into my eyes.

A text box appeared in the middle of my screen:




 “ROUND STARTING...”



And I was back at T-spawn.

But something was wrong.

I looked at my weapon.
It was gone.

I had no HUD. No gun. No ammo.

No way to fight.

And then I saw him.
Liam.

Up on the ledge above me. Arms limp. Head tilted unnaturally to the side.

He looked… empty. Like a corpse that forgot how to fall down.

Then—his mouth opened.

His model glitched violently, pixels snapping outward like breaking bone.

He said—no, screamed:




 “STILL.
PLAYING?!”



The sound ripped through my headphones like a demon crawling through a modem.

I tore the headset off, heart pounding like a drum, and yanked the power cable from my PC.

The room fell into blackness.


I didn’t sleep that night.

I didn’t touch 1.6 again.

But the worst part?

Sometimes when my PC boots, for just a second, I hear that wind from de_dust.

And once—just once—I woke up at 3:17 a.m. and found my monitor glowing.

It said:


 “Player: [yourname] has rejoined the game.”



I didn’t click anything.

I didn’t press start.

I swear I turned everything off.

So I’m telling you this, as a warning.

Don’t go alone into de_dust.

Don’t play at night.

And if you ever hear footsteps behind you…

Don’t turn around.

Because.........




Because, Liam might be watching you.
