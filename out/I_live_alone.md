It came back again.

Not just the toothbrush this time.

I woke up with water on the floor, puddled from the bathroom sink all the way to the foot of my bed. Like something walked it there.

Three toothbrushes. The blue one standing upright, soaked, toothpaste still foaming at the edges. The mirror fogged — but the house was cold. No steam. No heat. No reason.

I started crying without meaning to. Just stood there, shaking, whispering “what the f**k” over and over until it sounded like someone else saying it.

I needed help.

I drove to the nearest church. Old, grey stone, the kind you only notice when you’re desperate. A priest named Father Renwick met me near the back pews. Quiet man. Looked kind.

Until I showed him the photo.

I’d taken it that morning — the mirror with the word “SOON” traced through the fog. I didn’t want advice. I just wanted someone else to see it. To say I wasn’t losing it.

He barely glanced at the photo. His whole body went stiff.

Then he screamed.

Loud. Raw. Like something inside him just snapped.

He dropped the photo, backed into the altar, knocking over a candleholder. He was shouting prayers I didn’t recognize, fast and broken, like he was trying to outrun the words.

I tried to ask what was wrong — what it meant — but he wouldn’t look at me.

He just kept screaming.

Not at me.

Behind me.

I turned. Nothing was there.

When I looked back, he was gone. Just gone, like he’d been yanked out of the room. The candles flickered.

I followed the sound of slamming doors, down the hall behind the altar.

I found him in a small stone room near the back.

And I wish to God I hadn’t.

He was standing in the corner.

Bent completely backwards — spine twisted so far that his face was upside down, staring up at me from under his legs.

His mouth was open so wide it looked torn. His arms were flung out like he’d been frozen mid-fall.

He wasn’t blinking.

He wasn’t breathing.

He wasn’t dead.

His eyes locked on mine.

And then he made a sound I’ll never forget — this horrible, ragged wheeze, like a laugh and a sob had been jammed into the same broken breath.

Then I heard footsteps.

Not his.

Behind me again.

I turned. Nothing.

But when I looked back , Father Renwick was gone.

Just a smear of water on the floor. Leading toward me.

I ran. I left the church doors open behind me. Didn’t look back.

That was hours ago. I’m on a train now. I didn’t check where it was going I just got on

There are other passengers, but nobody’s talking.

There’s a woman sitting directly across from me.

She hasn’t blinked once.

Her bones look wrong. Her shoulders are too high. Neck too long. Like someone tried to build a person from memory and didn’t get it quite right.

She’s holding a shopping bag on her lap.

Inside it, I can see the tip of a blue toothbrush.

And she’s smiling at me.
