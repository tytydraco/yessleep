You ever heard of a game called "Kontrol" ? I had played it as a kid, maybe when I was 10 in the late 90's at a friend's house. He's pretty chill, and we still talk. It was a PC game having just a floppy disk. No box, manual or anything. It was strange, considering floppies weren't that popular, as CDs were the cool thing at the time. 
The game was pretty weird. The sounds were all chip tune, straight out of the motherboard itself. It had those early 16-Bit era games quality, and was pretty ugly. The stages were very... strange. They seemed random to me. There wasn't a connection between one and the next. It just displayed your objective, and you were thrown in the level. 

The first level gave us the plain text "Rob the Store", and so we did it. The map was a sort of convinience store, and our character a generic robber. It still used the arrow keys for movement and the spacebar for interactions. I remember it playing like a overhead view, but maybe it was point and click. It's been 20 years, I can't recall every detail.

We opened the door and walked in. The cashier of the store welcomed us, with basic text at the bottom of the screen. I think it wen't very casual, something like "Good morning, how can I help you ?" I moved the robber to the register and a single prompt appeared. "Rob."

This kind of stayed with me, because what was strange is how the sound was like. It was all beeps and bleeps. After pressing space, the robber pulled out a gun, and shot the cashier. It didn't make a bleep noise. I remember it clearly being an echoey sound of an actual gunshot. It was very strange. Why have the whole game make chiptune sounds if it can produce actual sounds ?

We made the robber take it all from the register and run to the end of the level. It just gave us a black screen, with the text "Concluded." No high scores, no continuing, nothing. We reset the game and we were at the title screen again. The level was different though. The objective: "Escape."

In this level you played as a Spider I think. It started on what I believed to be a basement, and we made it crawl all the way to the living room. I remember at this point a lot of noise downstairs becoming overwhelming. I'll never forget his mum's screams of fear. I think a bug, maybe a dog had walked in dowstairs. That's what I told myself at least.

In the living room screen, there were two people running around. We decided for the fun to approach them, and the prompt "Bite." showed up. We thought some funny animation would happen. The spider did bite the person, but it got squashed and died. We got a level concluded screen, same as before. 

We might've reset once more, but I wouldn't be able to tell what happened after. All I remember after this is going home because his family was annoying me with all that racket. I recently got in touch with him, his name is Toby. He was telling me he was at his mum's death anniversary, to remember her. He was catching me up on things.
Apparently she died 26 years ago, a bit after we stopped seeing each other. She had become horribly sick and died within a week of the sympthoms starting. He spared me the details of the cause, seems like it was too much for him to talk about that. I wonder what caused it.

He told me his dad had moved out of town right after that, as crime was rising. The retailer they always went to was shut down because of a murder, so his dad got scared and decided to move. No wonder I hadn't heard of him for a while after that day.

We talked about the game and he said he should still have the copy somewhere, and that I can drive out there to fetch it if I really want to. It's been eating up my mind thinking about it, remembering all these things. I want to know... How does that game end ? I'd love to see it. I'll check about this meeting.

Has anyone else played this game ?
