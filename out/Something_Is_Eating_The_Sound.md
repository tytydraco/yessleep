When Jenny spoke, it took her.

We were camping, four of us, out in the Wintercrest Woods. I know, it was stupid. Everyone said it was a bad idea to come out here if it wasn’t the dead of summer. We thought they were just talking about the terrain. Snow. Landslides. The cold. Typical camping worries. And we’ve been doing this for long enough that wasn’t a worry.

So—we went.

Jenny. Rob. Margo. Hunter. And me—Terry. Theodore, really, but only my mom calls me that. Called me that. I don’t think I’m going to hear my full name again.

Doesn’t matter. I’m getting ahead of myself. This won’t make sense if I don’t start at the campsite.

“It could be worse.” That was Rob, an attempt at being optimistic. A sad one, but I appreciated it. Honestly, the grounds weren’t great. There were too many stones and a littering of crunchy leaves everywhere.

Jenny dragged her foot over the ground, eyeing it uncertainly. “I think we’re going to have a couple of long nights out here. I can already feel my back hurting.”

“It’s going to be fine.” I dropped my backpack onto the ground and gave them a smile. “We’ve been talking about coming out here for *years*. Let’s just try and get some extra padding under us and—I mean, we can probably clear some of it away.”

Hunter snorted. “I’m not hauling rocks.” He crossed his arms over his chest, expression dour. “And I didn’t bring extra padding.”

“You have built in extra padding.” Rod gave Hunter a pat on the hip. “You’ll be fine.”

Margo helped me clear away some of the larger rocks. We doubled up our bags where we could and settled in for the night.

It woke me.

The *silence* woke me.

You know how sometimes you wake up in the middle of the night and the power has gone out? And it’s such an intense darkness, you *know* that’s what woke you? It was the same thing, but with the silence. Utter, intense quiet.

Fear churned in my chest. Every muscle felt tense. I was aware of the harsh rasp of each exhale. I could almost hear the rise and fall of my chest. It was terrifying. The thought of moving entered my mind but I was petrified of being the thing that broke the silence.

I don’t know how long I laid there. It felt like an eternity. All of a sudden, the forest just crashed back to life. Exhaling hard, I scrambled out of my tent on my hands and knees, ignoring the way the stones dug into my palms. Margo, Rob, and Hunter came bursting out of their tents.

Jenny was nowhere to be seen.

“Jesus Christ!” Hunter ran his fingers through his wild, tangled hair. “What the fuck was that?”

“Where’s Jenny?” Rob grabbed Margo by the shoulder.

She shook him off. “I don’t know. She said she was going to pee.”

“You didn’t go with her?”

“She’s thirty, Rob. She can pee in the bushes on her own!”

Rob took off into the darkness without another word. That’s when I realized I was freezing—my jacket was soaked with sweat. I curled my arms around myself and announced, “I’m going to change. I’ll be right back.”

I had barely gotten on my new sweater when Rob started screaming. I’m not going to bore you with the details. He screamed. We ran and found him. He had found Jenny.

She was dead.

Her throat was split open. Deep claw marks had split the flesh of her cheeks. The snow around her was stained red. We cried. Margo puked. We reconvened at the camp. It was dark. We couldn’t leave. And then—it went silent again.

It was like something had just suctioned all of the sound from around us. I froze, eyes going wide. They met Margo’s. She mouthed, *Behind you*, but I couldn’t bring myself to turn and look. My muscles ached. Rob was behind me. Hunter, too. I tried to hear something other than my own heart beating but it was drowned out by my thundering inhales.

Margo turned white. Tears formed in her eyes. I prayed she didn’t cry—I knew I would be able to hear the tear hit the ground and it would sound like a bomb dropping. It was just that quiet.

When the sound crashed back into being, it brought a splitting migraine. Intense pain shot through my skull and I dropped to the ground, shouting and grabbing my head. Margo collapsed across from me, forehead pressing to the stony forest floor as she sobbed.

“Terry,” She managed to get out. After the ultimate silence, her voice sounded like cymbals going off right next to my head. Margo fell silent, opting to just point a trembling hand.

Blinking the tears from my eyes, I managed to get back up to my knees.

Behind me, Hunter and Rob were splayed out on the ground. Red snow. Thick, open wounds in their necks where they had been split open. Hunter’s bottom jaw was dislocated, flesh purpling. His tongue was gone. God, his tongue was gone. Ripped straight out of his mouth.

“We have to go.” Even the whisper made my headache spike. I grabbed Margo by the hands and hauled her up. The dried leaves beneath our boots crunched; a chip bag getting crumpled in my ear over and over. The stones our boots knocked into skittered with the same crash as a wrecking ball.

We only made it ten foot before the sound was sucked out of existence again. I froze. Margo took an extra two stops before she caught herself and went still. But those two steps, they were too much. The sound split the silence open like a knife. She turned to look at me. All I could do was stand there and watch as a thin red line spread down the length of her throat. And then—it exploded open. The air filled with a fine red mist.

Margo fell backward, hitting the ground—but there was no sound. It was gone. Invisible claws silently ripped into her face, splitting her cheeks and her gums.

And then the sound came back but...I couldn’t move. I won’t be able to make it to the morning. I’m cold. It’s snowing. If the sound goes away again, the chattering of my teeth is going to give me away.

So instead of running, I wrote this.

I don’t know what’s eating the sound, but I do know if you come out to these woods in the winter, it’s going to hear you.

It’s going to hear you but you’re never going to hear it.
