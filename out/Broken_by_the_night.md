On January 12th, 2024, my happy, healthy, successful 43-year-old life was forever turned upside-down by one Friday night.

This is a tale of party drugs. It’s also a life-and-death journey I could’ve never imagined in my wildest dreams. 

Some will see my story as a case study at the intersection of brain science, medicine, pharma, and policy. Others, a harrowing dive into extremes of the human mind. 

As the one who lived it, telling this here, now, for the first time, ten months later, is therapy — assembling the shards of a shattered life and heart into one broken mosaic. 

Here goes…

At my brother’s 50th birthday in Cabo, Mexico, along with other party guests, I was offered cocaine. By no means a user, I’m also not a novice. I’m a normal millennial in that I’ve never looked for drugs, but am not afraid to try something passed by friends.

For context, I’m a responsible, well-educated guy with a bunch of advanced degrees. I manage a small, thriving international company. This background is not a brag, only to establish that until January I lived a drama-free life, successful by any metric. I’m also by nature an understated middle child, so making noise or having weird stuff happen is not my thing. Until that night, I’d coasted through life without anything big ever going wrong.

Being in my early 40s, my partying days have been over for a while, and January was my first time in a decade+ — since business school — touching party drugs.

Over several hours at a place called Bagatelle, where the first dinner of the three-day bash took place, I had a dozen+ lines/bumps of coke while sipping rum. It was a festive if over-the-top scene as our group of 40 danced atop the long birthday table, stepping over dinner plates — while magnums of champagne carried between waiters were poured directly into mouths like parishioners taking communion. Not your typical Friday night, but all were having fun celebrating my bro. So chemically speaking, cocaine and alcohol were the first ingredients in my blood.

As midnight approached, I was handed by a banker friend what I was told was MDMA brought from San Francisco. I’d taken molly twice before in my life — once at a wedding in Prague, before that at a club in Aruba — and had good experiences both times. I didn’t particularly want to take it that night in Mexico, being late and tired from flying out of DC at the crack of dawn… so I nearly said, “no thanks.”

But your brother only turns a half-century once, and I didn’t overthink it. I split the cap in half with my fingers, swallowed what I figured would be a light dose, and kept on with the party.

Biggest mistake of my life. Across all years. The one that changed everything… Even Dostoyevsky couldn’t have foreseen what lay ahead.

When added to the cocaine, MDMA instantly had a negative effect. In my two previous rolls, I hadn’t mixed it. This time with was different. I felt an overwhelming anxiety never known in my life.

An hour into that state, I had to leave the afterparty. I was consumed by unease and couldn’t continue to talk with people. When I got back to my room at Esperanza, I wasn’t able to sleep. This was no surprise since cocaine makes the process of settling down belabored, so I lay awake, passing out after sunrise.

When I awoke that afternoon, the angst hadn’t abated. I stayed in my room, skipping day two of the birthday bash, waiting for the malaise to pass. I’d never had a mood disorder or taken a psych med. Long-lasting unease was entirely new.

Day three came and went with me cooped up. My phone filled with messages as I skipped the close of the 72-hour celebration.

And that’s when the real problem started…

On the third night, when I tried to sleep, no sleep came. None. 

Day four, Jan 16, I flew to Mexico City for routine work meetings and events. The same pattern continued that night — and the one after — no sleep.

By the end of the sixth sleepless night, having barely scraped through what would have otherwise been stress-free obligations in CDMX, I flew home to DC, assuming all would return to normal in my own bed.

Nothing changed back home.

A seventh sleepless night became an eighth with an hour or two of broken rest, always springing wide awake with churning anxiety. It was as if my brain had gotten stuck in “fight-or-flight” mode, with no off-switch.

Now, in my prior life, a restless night — say, from a red-eye flight, before a big speech, or a tough board meeting — would lead to sheer exhaustion the next evening, crashing hard from the lack of rest. But “catch-up sleep” never came with this bizarre MDMA insomnia. I simply didn’t get sleepy, no matter how many nights passed.

After two weeks, I knew in my gut something big was up. After seeing my family doctor, I was referred to a psychiatrist for the first time, who began to treat me with introductory sleeping pills, starting with trazodone. These didn’t put a dent in the insomnia, and I was rotated to stronger categories of prescription.

This process repeated for the next month as I worked with a growing list of psychiatrists and sleep neurologists who wrote scripts for sequentially more heavily controlled meds. These trials included every sedative Rx under the sun. I won’t re-list them, suffice to say, I left no stone unturned. Just the categories of sleep-inducing drugs I cycled through, searching with doctors for one that worked, included orexin inhibitors, adrenergic receptor agonists, benzodiazepines, z-drugs, beta blockers, tricyclics, tetracyclics, melatonin modulators, antiepileptics, anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, and, eventually, full-on anesthetics — a la Michael Jackson. I had every bloodwork panel done, a sleep study (sleeping 50 minutes across the night), an MRI, EEG, hired a CBTi coach, etc… nothing helped or provided doctors any insight into what had happened in my brain.

By the three-month mark, I’d trialed 40+ on-label and off-label prescriptions. Here let me explain how so-called “psych drugs” work. When prescribed “on-label” for mood disorders like depression, anxiety, and bipolar, these drugs take weeks, if not months, to work. But when prescribed “off-label” for the sole purpose of promoting sleep, these same drugs either work or don’t on the first night, providing diminishing returns as tolerance builds. That’s how I was able, under doctor supervision, to test every sedating Rx in existence over 90 days, searching for an illusive solution.

The newest “designer” meds, like the DORAs, had to be specially ordered by the pharmacy. I was becoming so desperate as weeks past that for one called Quviviq (which had helped Matthew Perry sleep), and insurance wouldn’t cover, I shelled out $1k not knowing if it would work… it didn’t.

Against these sleepless nights, I tried to wear down my brain by spending every day in the gym and running miles outside. My goal became to tire myself to sleep, and I was like a warrior fighting this battle. I inadvertently got into the best shape of my life. People’s passing compliments couldn’t imagine the dark source of my transformation. Still, nothing changed at night.

Piece by piece, I removed as many potential stressors around me as I could think of in the hope that putting one on the back burner might help. So, fighting a tug of war with my heart that exhaustion eventually won, I pushed all intensity and passion from my personal life into the background — shutting out love in a way that’s haunted me since.

At work, I’d been doing what I could to keep on top of running a company, masking my increasingly drained appearance and depleted mental state — reminiscent of [Edward Norton’s workplace struggle with insomnia](https://youtu.be/8pDY_9u5Sn0?feature=shared) in Fight Club. Anyone who saw me in those days will know that the giveaway of this scene being fiction is Norton’s eyes aren’t nearly sunken enough, as mine had become.

On days when I simply couldn’t function, I couched my absence as “migraines” among colleagues and friends — too embarrassed to say I wasn’t sleeping, something that comes naturally to everyone, including me for the 42 years prior. On top of this, I was also ashamed by the source of my plight — a frivilous party drug, an admission I couldn’t broadcast beyond doctors. So I gutted it out in silence.

Eventually, the mental and physical toll became unsustainable, and I had to start an indefinite leave of absence from the job I loved. I cut out all travel and commitments — canceling trips, reassigning roles, and appointing surrogates. Still, nothing I did to streamline my life changed the sleeplessness. I never yawned, nor got tired. And all I could ever manage was an hour or two of medicated sleep — holding out hope with each passing week that a new drug cocktail might finally bring restorative rest.

Across three months, I’d invested tens of thousands of dollars seeing top experts in a 4-hour radius of DC, most of whom don’t take insurance. Yet I was no closer to a solution, let alone a basic understanding of what medically I was facing. I went to hospital ERs, begging to be put into a coma for one night of rest — as Jordan Peterson [had done in in Russia](https://nationalpost.com/health/jordan-peterson-benzodiazepines). But not being suicidal, despite insomnia as one of its biggest risk factors, I could never get past triage. I reduced my daily routine to the calmest activities, sushi diet, textbook sleep hygiene… but no matter what I did to LuLuLemonify my life, I couldn’t sleep. It was a hell you can’t imagine, without relief — not one night.

By mid-April, month four, encouraged by my doctors and the few people I’d let into my struggle, I took the next step and checked myself into the first of a series of private hospital residencies to treat this mysterious condition with 24-hour care. To put it in perspective, across the past two decades, I might have taken four sick days total. So flying to a clinic, let alone leaving work for weeks, was out of character to say the least.

In late April through early May, I travelled to Texas and checked into one of the top behavioral health facilities in the country. It’s the kind of private hospital oasis set among manicured gardens and quiet walking paths that takes away your phone on arrival, so nothing can distract getting well. While there, I was placed on a different kind of med — an SSRI — with no obvious relationship to sleep. It was prescribed to treat the increasing anxiety surrounding me as I shut my life down. Lexapro, a serotonin-reuptake inhibitor, works on the neurotransmitter 5-HT — just like MDMA.

Miraculously, and unexpectedly for doctors, Lexapro put me to sleep. For two weeks, my life went back to normal. I flew home filled with gratitude, energized to restart where I’d left off with more passion than ever. I jumped back into work and rebuilt the personal connections I’d so missed. After what I’d been through, life had handed back to me in a way that’s impossible to describe unless you lose it for a while. I was beaming, and while it baffled doctors, no one second-guessed the positive results. After all, Lexapro targets the same protein as MDMA, 5-HT (serotonin) — a signal fire as to what had gone wrong in the first place back in January.

I felt like I’d beaten by far the scariest thing I’d ever faced, and for two weeks, Lexapro was my lifeline. But then, in a cruel twist of fate hard to look back on now, as I adjusted to its SSRI effects, insomnia came right back. I stuck with Lexapro in the hope this was a transient side effect, but by week seven of the trial, my sleeplessness was worse than ever. I switched to other serotonin modulators like Trintellix and Velazodone but nothing put me back to sleep. The honeymoon of Lexapro became a bittersweet memory of rest that disappeared as unexpectedly as it had arrived.

A few weeks later, in June, I was finally able to see the chief sleep neurologist at Johns Hopkins Medicine, Dr. Christopher Earley, who I’d been trying to get in with for months but is booked a year in advance as the national authority on sleep science and the brain. A family friend on the Hopkins board helped get me up the list.

On hearing my story, after examining the details of my chart, and consulting with his colleague at Hopkins, neurologist [George Ricaurte](https://karger.com/nps/article-abstract/42/1/5/232593/3-4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine-Ecstasy-Induced?redirectedFrom=fulltext) — a well-known researcher on methamphetamine and MDMA neurotoxicity since the 90s — Dr. Earley told me what I’d taken that night in Mexico caused a “one in a million” reaction in my brain. When combined with the volatile punch of dopamine from cocaine, MDMA caused a “Serotonin Syndrome” that fried and down-regulated my 5-HT system through a rare but devastating neurotoxic reaction. Serotonin controls sleep in a way that requires a delicate balance to get right. This is why a few days of insomnia and malaise after molly is common — just not long-lasting, much less, permanent. For most people, damaged 5-HT proteins restore quickly; but in rare cases, lasting, irreversible neural damage can occur. Dr. Earley told me I wasn’t the first he’d seen and referred to cases in the medical literature about a range of neurological disorders from even one-time MDMA use.

With candor I appreciated, Dr. Earley couldn’t say if my brain would ever recover, why Lexapro helped and then stopped, or if anything would let me sleep again. Seeing the exhaustion in my eyes, he agreed to treat my case on “an experimental basis,” and ordered a weeklong sleep-study for more data. Becoming the test patient to one of America’s most seasoned neurologists was both affirming, given the extremes I’d been through in my search for a cure, and terrifying, for what it signaled about the road ahead.

June gave way to July and the 6-month anniversary of my insomnia was fast approaching. As this dreary milestone neared, I became isolated and was losing hope. I hadn’t worked in months, had retreated from my inner-circle, and lost precious parts of my life that meant the world to me. More than $200,000 had been spent going to the country’s top clinics — ending up at The Retreat, a full-service medical facility outside of Baltimore that runs $50k each 20 days and takes zero insurance. No price was too high, investing whatever it took to get me better, knowing not just sleep but increasingly my life was on the line. Still, after seeking the best of the best, no one could stop the insomnia, tell me how long this hell would last, or if it would ever leave.

Doctors had also run out of medications to try, the last being the narcoleptic anesthetic Xyrem (aka GHB, the infamous date-rape drug from [Diddy’s parties](https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/sean-diddy-combs-baby-oil-was-allegedly-laced-with-date-rape-drug/4002710/?amp=1)) — a Schedule I narcotic prescribed off-label by Dr. Earley as an extreme final resort. As the most controlled substance in America (only one central pharmacy is authorized to dispense it), Xyrem was taking forever to get approved, required passing through safety hoops, and cost $25,000 per month. Receiving it was weeks or more away with no indication would work where others failed.

Sleep deprivation is a form of torture considered among the worst. Losing one hour of sleep makes Division One basketball players miss twice as many shots the next day. We’ve all experienced at some point the relentless feeling from a single sleepless night. You don’t think straight. In as little as three days, sleep deprivation breaks prisoners of war into giving up classified secrets. So by the time my insomnia hit the 6-month mark in July, the once unfathomable thought of cutting my life short slowly started to creep into my mind as a last resort for rest. Insomnia had literally become my death bed. 

Compounding this was a Catch-22. It’s paradoxical, but the most effective sleep drugs doctors give for life-saving rest also come with “black box” warnings in their fine print about triggering severe depression and suicidality. So my hopelessness about not sleeping was being chemically amped up by the same medications I’d been prescribed in the hope of sleep. I was trapped in a “damned if you do,” “damned if you don’t” loop with no way out between crippling depression from not sleeping, or crippling depression from sleeping pills.

This snowballing downward spiral is how — coming from a guy who’d in December 2023 been the happiest in my entire life, with a thriving company I was expanding, pristine waterfront in Canada and on the Chesapeake I’d spent years developing into gardens of Eden to enjoy forever, a skylit top-floor place in the city, financial freedom, world-class mentors and colleagues around me, a dream job that took me to every corner of the earth, a full heart, in short, all I ever wanted and more — by the time July 2024 rolled around, the person I’d become was not recognizable as the same me. It was two different lives. Because I couldn’t sleep… I couldn’t think, I couldn’t engage, I couldn’t feel pleasure. I was a walking zombie who hadn’t rested since January. It was worse than anything I could have ever imagined would happen to anyone I knew, least of all, to me.

So for an eternal optimist who’d never felt down for any stretch, much less considered the idea of ending it all, even in my wildest nightmares, even as something I’d understand in others suffering, never able to grasp what could bring someone to that state… by July, suicidal ideation had become my everyday battle.

It’s sometimes said that self-harm is selfish. I thought that way too. But through the unending attrition of my sleepless hell, what came to feel selfish was continuing to drag everyone down with me. A clean break would free us all from the black hole.

Let me be clear on something. Weakness played no part in what follows. Those who’ve known me know I’m virtually unbreakable. No one builds the life I did without limitless resolve, nor could they endure the parts of this story still to come without iron will.

But the laws of nature are fact. No one — no matter how resilient, no matter how brave — can fight biology forever and win. Sleep exists for a reason. We cannot be without it. There is no alternative.

After spending the sleepless night of July 4th watching fireworks on the Baltimore skyline from my room at The Retreat — remembering my old life watching fireworks the year before on the Tred Avon River among friends and family, now a distant memory from a past life when all was well — two mornings later I gave up my last ounce of hope in ever getting better. Hope was replaced by the sinking feeling of a kamikaze pilot called for a one-way mission, summoned to a final test of courage. The universe had left only one way to end the endlessness, and get the rest I’d been desperately seeking for so long.

Pushing back tears, I scribbled a short goodbye note, remembered one final time the people and life I’d been so in love with before this all started, cursed God for cursing me… and hung myself.

I’ve always flown under the radar, never seeking attention. So doing the unthinkable wasn’t a masked plea, as can be the case with those who choose pills or cuts, and rarely succeed by design. That wasn’t me for a minute. I’d tried every path for help. I’m a quick study and my method instead represented a decision. I made a strong noose and secured it at such a height that nothing could allow me to turn back once the process began, knowing there would be — I had no idea how long — intense pain before blacking out. I told myself it couldn’t feel worse than what I’d already endured. So I bit my lip, prepared for that moment, and the eternal unknown to follow.

Against every probable outcome, I partially failed, or partially succeeded — depending on the measuring stick. You could call it my first piece of good luck in six months, coming at a crucial time.

On the other hand, what I did forever changed the life I once had and wanted, the people around me, and all that follows. I’m still here, but not in a way that feels like me — with brain changes beyond chemicals now that can’t be fixed no matter how far I search for a cure this time around. I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.

Some asked, how I survived. It’s a morose second act.

Since my original intent was to share an advisory, not explore psychological torture, I hadn’t planned to delve into the next chapter of my saga since July. But because it’s part of the ripple effect from that January night, and although it includes shameful details, I’ve been astounded by the honesty of others as I’ve navigated so much uncharted territory. 

So here’s the rest of my tale….

At the end of my third week in The Retreat outside of Baltimore, in early July, with the best doctors in the world no closer to helping me than any had been at the start of my journey six months before, I gave up.

Despite sharing with doctors a growing belief that my end was drawing near, and petrified family members calling to warn of the despair in my voice and what they feared was coming — naively, the nurses had loaned me a 14-foot charger cable.

Outside, in some woods nearby, out of view, I fastened the cable to a sturdy branch on an overturned log above a stream, doubled it twice around my neck, and slid my body off the edge. I’ve always been drawn to water, and dying in suspension above a trickling creek felt like the most peaceful place on campus I could think of to silently say goodbye. I passed out almost instantly as the noose caught and cinched tight. Sometime later — no one knows how long — one of the cords snapped, then the other, and I fell.

Two sudden bursts of orange flooded my head in flashes of the most intense pain I’ve ever known as consciousness returned. My eyes popped open and I jolted back to life, like a scene from a movie. But the right side of my body was numb, I had twitching fingers, double vision, pulsating pupils, uncontrollable shivering, and other weird thermodynamic effects from starving my brain of oxygen long enough to shut it down. This was all later diagnosed as an anoxic brain injury to my left hemisphere.

When alert enough to rise, I stumbled back to The Retreat and turned myself in. I was escorted to the emergency room in delirium — coping with the terrifying effects of the brain injury I’d just suffered, compounded by the insomnia that broke me down in the first place. Nothing, not even hanging, would let me escape. It’s like I was trapped in an episode of Black Mirror or The Twilight Zone.

Then, in a twist of dark humor from the universe (that even made Dr. Earley laugh when he later heard), I became sleepy in the ER for the first time in six months. Somehow, shutting my brain down reset it in a way that brought intense fatigue — which none of 40+ medications could ever do. So I dozed in and out of consciousness for three days, as MRIs, echocardiograms, and other tests were done to look for brain necrosis or a signs of a heart attack.

In spite of my self-induced asphyxiation, I was being kept on the hospital’s stroke floor — rather than its protected psych floor. It may have been my well-groomed appearance or polished manner that deceived doctors into not seeing the risk, ignoring the fact of what had just brought me in. And so that’s how, shortly before I was scheduled to be transferred to a trauma unit next door, on the afternoon of July 9, still in an anoxic delirium, I broke free from the sitter assigned to watch me when distracted, and bolted to the 6th-floor exit down the hall from my room. Without pause, I dove head-first down the stairwell center — figuring a six-story drop would end the suffering once and for all.

But security chased and reached for one of my feet as I went over the ledge — holding on for a split second, just long enough before I slipped through their hands — that I flipped as I free-fell down the stairwell center. In mid-air somersaults I collided with and bounced off railings, which zig-zagged my trajectory so that I ended up hitting on a landing 3 floors below, instead of free-falling 6 stories. 

Shrieks from above sounded the alarm as doctors from every floor rushed to the stairwell. Peering down in disbelief, through my motionless, glazed eyes — against all odds — I had a pulse, still. 

Somehow, going three floors headfirst didn’t kill me, as it did fellow musical soul Liam Payne recently in Argentina. But when the back of my head hit concrete, it deviated my eyes in a way that makes 3D vision weird (called strabismus), and gave me “Acquired Aphantasia,” which means losing your mind’s eye. So now, when I close my eyes, I’m blind. The image of every memory I ever made was erased on impact. I can’t picture what anyone looks like, can’t envision the future, can’t lock onto my eyes in the mirror, am not able to absorb written words without saying them, can’t navigate without GPS, and a myriad of ways that shutting off your imagination reshapes you. Since I’ve been told my whole life I’m a “visual person,” losing this half of my brain feels like losing me.

In more dark humor from fate, this new neurological condition is exceedingly rare, just like the MDMA insomnia before it. Acquired Aphantasia is uncommon in head injury because rear-occipital damage happens far less frequently than frontal-lobe, as with head-on car crashes. So I’m navigating this new chapter, once again, in the dark, flying blind, likely forever. 

After my fall, the scent of liability attracted hospital attorneys like sharks to blood, who to protect themselves, threw the book at me. I was strapped to a gurney, sent to a ward, and locked away for 40 days. Much of that time was on “1:1,” which is like solitary confinement, but with a guard standing at arm's length, 24/7, even in the shower, even in bed. 

Still in a trance from my head colliding with cement, I thought about Moses in the desert. I began to talk to my guard — this alter ego beside me — like the Voice in the Burning Bush. Her name was Sam.

When strong enough to walk, I walked in circles. Endlessly. Sam's voice beside me brought periodic news of the outside, beyond the walls… an assassin shot Trump at a rally, but the bullet grazed his ear… a giant bridge across the Chesapeake collapsed nearby, cars dropping into the water as stones into a pond. My world — inside and out — had become magical realism, One Hundred Years of Solitude. Fiction morphed into fact in this Borgesian labyrinth. My sleepless life had become the requiem for a dream.

Given my seeming penchant for transforming medical campuses into deathtraps, ward leadership was terrified of a lawsuit. So that meant all eyes on me, day and night, a never-ending watch. My life was paper scrubs, paper spoons, rubber mattress, plastic pillow, no sheets, metal toilet, no lid, Stockholm shower, no curtain. Strip searches at sunup and sundown. The pattern repeated, day after day after day. I’d become their Al Capone… Hannibal Lecter, without the Goldberg Variations as company… the Kurt Cobain of insomnia. But their overzealous posturing didn’t matter. The time to save me came and went before I arrived.

I did my time, and eventually, six weeks later, was released in mid-August. Since then, I’ve survived by planting and cutting trees on some acreage I own, and long adventures with my dog [Peanut](https://www.instagram.com/theotterholt/) — trying to keep at bay depression’s downward force of gravity on a level I never knew existed in this world. Worn out by what’s become a year without rest, now navigating unsettling deficits of a new brain trauma — I keep thinking back to my life before this all started, and the dreams I had to leave behind along the way. I can’t understand why any of it happened, and I’m not able to sleep much, still...

Most recently, I’ve spent September, October, and November fighting poison with poison — doing every last-ditch brain-reset known to man, including six weeks of TMS, five weeks of Ketamine, four Stellate Ganglion Block neck injections (used by military), and soon, triweekly [ElectroConvulsive shock](https://youtu.be/fQBTEemrF1Y?feature=shared) under general anesthesia. All that’s missing for Christmas are two turtle-doves and a partridge in a pear tree. 

But no brain-reset touches me. My mind’s blank. My heartlight’s out. There are no more stars in the sky.

When you add it up, what I’ve lived since January is so unbelievable it couldn’t be fiction — only fact. And now the sleepless nights that started it all are the prelude to an even stranger chapter I’m still awakening to.

I’ve never been a fan of melodrama, but I can’t help the feeling of missing life’s chance — derailing onto the wrong track from one night out, my train now headed in another direction. After being the driver my whole life, I’ve become its passenger, seeing where each day goes. I don’t know where this new ride in my new brain ends up. Fortunately, I can write, but I’ve lost the ability to be succinct (as you may have gathered) from Aphantasia. I now have to say everything in my head. I need to hear it. It’s all part of the sea change.

The harder they come, the harder they fall. The happy, go-lucky me of December 2023 has become a distant character in an old movie. Every moment radiates from the past. Through the fog of time between then and now, it’s a miracle and a curse that I made it. January 12 will always mark in some way the last day of my life.

My story from one night of party drugs may rank among the most life-changing of all time. I’m the exception to the rule, not the rule.

But I’m also not alone. Not the only one.

The world is full of terrified people experiencing lasting insomnia from MDMA. [Here’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/lexapro/s/l88p1xECmC) one, here’s [another](https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/s/R77cNigJ0y), all variations on the same theme. Most testimonies get shot down by a mob of enthusiasts who doubt the same drug they love could damage another. You can’t understand until it happens to you. I never would’ve, but I’ve since discovered so many lives broken by this chemical’s dark side.

If you look up NIH case reports, you’ll find things like permanent [anxiety disorders](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5968564/) and intractable [psychosis](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3304680/) brought on by even one-time MDMA use in otherwise healthy people, as I was.

If you search blogs for what’s called “long-term comedown” (LTC), there are troves of devastating accounts of MDMA creating neuroses lasting months, years, forever. People around the world have contacted me with heartwrenching life-turns. 

Without a doubt my case is exceptional. As Dr. Earley said, a “one-in-a-million” neurotoxic event.

But if I had any idea I was playing the lottery that night, even at one in a billion odds, even a trillion, I would’ve never taken the cap handed to me. I loved life too much to risk it. What hit my brain eventually took away the best parts of me. I can’t make sense of it, nor will I ever.

I’ll also always wonder what good was waiting around the corner if I’d been only made the other choice that night. It’s too much to think about. I can’t explain fate, but I didn’t deserve this. No one does.

For 999,999 people out there, since the chances are slim, you’ll soon forget my story. I would have too. Before that night, I never worried. Didn’t know the first thing about meds, the brain, or drugs. Never stressed. I was living a charmed life and got lucky at each turn. Everything just worked and was good. That was my world for 42 unforgettable years.

But for the next one-in-a-million, just maybe, my tale gives pause before plugging in chemicals with the power to reshape a mind. We each make our own choices, but from where I stand in its abyss, the mind is too powerful a supercomputer to toy with. It’s our universe, and because it surrounds us, it feels permanent — like the sun always rises. But, truth is, we don’t understand our mind’s universe, let alone what can throw off its axis and rotation for good. I learned too late.

I wish I never had this story to tell. I’d give up anything to go back in time to when the cap was in my hand. It’s a what-if reel I’ve replayed ten thousand times, sometimes every hour, every minute. I can’t change the past, but my journey can help someone else’s future.

People may ask…

Did the system fail? No.

No, in that MDMA put the writing on the wall. That was my choice, and while it may soon be legal in a bunch of countries like the US, Mexico is not one. Ironically, that same morning, Jan 12, Mexican authorities seized on arrival a CBD lip balm from my toiletry bag — received on my birthday, three days before, bought over-the-counter in DC. So there’s no consensus on what’s safe and what isn’t.

No, in that I was treated by countless compassionate doctors who did the best they could. Too many to name.

Most importantly, No, in that there’s not a neurobiologist on earth who understands the human brain. We haven’t reached anything beyond presumption. So how can any doctor be faulted for not finding my silver bullet?

On the other hand…

Did the system fail? Yes.

Yes, in that 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) was first synthesized by Merck Pharmaceuticals, owner of the same patented drugs I would later take to fight its damage. You break it, you buy it.

Yes, in that the very medicines prescribed to give me life-preserving sleep gave me life-destroying depression.

Yes, in that nurses at high-end facility loaned me a 14-foot cable, knowing I was approaching the breaking point from no sleep. Had I arrived with that in my bags, it would have been confiscated for the glaring risk. 

Yes, in that I turned myself in to an ER in self-induced anoxia, only to be assigned a room beside a six-story stairwell — when an entire trap-proof floor existed in the same hospital for patients experiencing delirium.

My story’s worth telling if for no other reason than the questions that intersect across medicine, policy, pharma, drugs, health, and brain science.

But none of these questions matter now. I wasn’t thinking about any of them as I sat on the log, rolling back the reel of time.

I was remembering the people and places I love.

The story’s told. How to move on…
 
Growing up, my older brother was the daredevil. He’d push me down our hilly driveway on a skateboard. He’d take me climbing 20-story cranes at night. How could I survive so many adventures, but not his 50th. We haven’t spoken since. It’s not his fault. No one knew.

I was always loyal to my company and the people I share it with. They’ve been loyal all these months, flying the plane, awaiting a return, never giving up hope.

The last thing left to face is my heart.

As a kid, I spent summers at Langley Pool, a neighborhood club set on woods beside the Potomac River. Each day, I’d see a reclusive old man with long grey hair enter the neighboring forest — stark naked — and walk a path only he knew to a tucked-away cove. For as long as anyone could remember, he’d [been building a half-mile long dam](https://wtop.com/news/2011/11/naked-ned-hunts-for-the-infinite-along-the-potomac/) out of rocks by hand in the rapids that, across decades, single-handedly redirected the course of one of America’s most famed waterways. To this day, his handiwork is visible on Google Earth, just west of the American-Legion Bridge.

Legend had it Crazy Ned, as he was known, was stuck in an endless loop from a bad drug trip that broke him, like the strange [case of the frozen addict](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x95edl8). Looking back, Ned’s appearance in the haze of my childhood, now seems almost a Biblical omen… this Sisyphus cursed by a pill to push stones against the current forever, a Hailey’s Comet sent to me as a warning from the stars.

But I never saw the sign.

And now the stars — even Karlvagn — have all gone out.  

In the ensuing darkness, there’s no place left to hide from my heart. It’s been sealed shut since May, burying deep memories that forever haunt me. Black car, bright eyes, black boots, two smiles, autumn leaves, two oaks, white dress, two hands, starry night, two AM, daybreak drive, two hearts, midnight melodies, two flights, Swiss chocolate, two views, dancing kisses, two lives, dreamy promises, to forever… our own little universe, the one we wanted, all the time in the world, always and for alltid, our dreamland, foreland, island, play-land, homeland, heartland, elskland, our everything, elsklingdom.

I was [the luckiest](https://youtu.be/ISMnfcnX6Ng?feature=shared). Those who saw, saw shining eyes. I had it all, in my hands, the best parts of life, in the making. But from dream to dreamlessness, dreamland to wasteland, my love at first sight was ripped from my fingers, piece by piece, stripped bare, carried off, a thief in the night, night after night, endlessly, until it vanished… the ruins of insomnia.

For third grade we lived in India. Each day at school my eyes caught in shy glances a little blond girl with sparkly eyes. She was two grades above me, but I had friends in her class. We wrote secret folded notes, she invited me to her birthday, played spin the bottle, and became each other’s first kiss. Those were the best days of childhood. 

But just as our story was starting, my family had to leave the country, no warning. At the Delhi airport, before our flight, I called her from a pay phone to tell her what happened. No one was home. I never got to say goodbye. 

Her face in the 1990 Embassy School yearbook followed me for years. Her piercing eyes and flaxen hair became my colors — the colors of her flag, Sweden. I drew it everywhere. Her smile haunted me long into my teens and beyond. I never gave up the ghost.

Then, out of nowhere, last year, on a flight from London, she came back. All grown up, majestic, demure, golden. Bright like a diamond. Made for me. Her last words, before the sleepless nights took her away again, this time for good: I love you unconditionally.

On another earth, one where I didn’t take the orange pill, we’re still together in drømland. [Liebesträum](https://youtu.be/FZ651tNXp0Y). But here, in this parallel universe, the upside-down — all is gone.

Coming up on the anniversary of the first night that started all the sleepless ones to follow, I keep thinking back to this time last year… healthy and strong, chemical-free, soundly sleeping, my world in motion, a new moon rising, criss-crossing shimmering sea-waves, embarking on what I thought was becoming — like a lightening strike — the brightest chapter of my life. I’d always heard, “From the brightest day, comes the darkest night.” Now I know.

Sleep is like true love. It finds you when you’re not looking. It fills you with dreams. Its melody is a nocturne. And when you lose it, you lose everything.

There is one difference. Everyone knows sleep. Few ever know true love. I couldn’t know it then, but I lost both, the same night. 

One tiny cap I barely remember taking, broke my sleep, my world, and my heart — in that order. Lovestruck, became lovesick, but never lovelorn. Because I did it to myself. That is the hardest pill to swallow.

This December, every carol echoes a bittersweet reminder of the final weeks of shining eyes one year ago, before my story began. I miss those days like you can’t imagine. Last year’s songs are the shooting stars of a light-filled universe, set ablaze, then vanished and gone. I’ll never get those starbursts back, the shining eyes — or why they slipped away.

Here’s hoping ECT erases all the memories — like [Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind](https://youtu.be/yE-f1alkq9I). Meet me in Montauk.

For now, red wine and sleeping pills help me get back to your arms. [Maybe. I will see you. In the next life.](https://youtu.be/EcSvMFm2ABE?feature=shared)
