I was doing deep sea research on a large research vessel that me and the other researchers called the leviathan a large submarine capable of impossible depths it would seem,

We were moving along the Mariana trench studying life in the depths something I'd dreamed of since I was a young boy I remember reading stories about ghost ships and light houses where the crew just disappeared my favorite was the Mary Celeste I always wondered what happened to the crew of the ship I always joked that a kraken grabbed the ship and took the crew.

I looked at the cameras around the vessel looking outside just infinite darkness light not making it more than 10 foot from the sub the ocean is so mysterious but unexplorable it's the most non livable place and it won't even let you see the environment around you they say space is terrifying but atleast you can see. 

As I watched the cameras I saw a large rock face along side us much different from the other rocks around us this one was slick and smooth like glass and it seemed to never end and it started to dip below the ground but It came back out a little later I thought it was off but rocks form strangely sometimes I thought until I saw it jet straight up and I panned the camera up and it disappeared into the void of darkness its scales reflecting the light back at me and the sub stopped I rushed to the front telling the crew we need to move and surface and I told the captain why he didn't believe me I told him to check the cameras and as he looked it just vanished without a trace he looked at me crazy muttering to himself "these scientists and Thier damned minds I'm glad this is the last time Ill be down here" 

I tried to sleep it off but I kept seeing that thing in my dreams I had to know I just wish I would've kept sleeping a hard shove against the sub followed by the deafening sirens aboard the vessel jolted me awake the sub now steaming ahead and surfacing as fast as we could the crew rushing trying to fix what happened I went to the cameras the dark slick glass-like skin now becoming more visible the cuts and gashes from the creature it's open maw and void of a throat large enough to swallow a small ship whole chasing us gaining quickly the crew got to escape pods on the ship the captain bringing us as close to the surface as he could I barely made it in a vessel before it grabbed the sub it it's mouth clamping onto it as the escape pod jettisoned from the sub the large serpent now coiling around the entire sub twice over.

It's been 20 years since I went back into those waters but we're still not safe on land either were at the mercy of nature we merely just live here because they let us.
