A week later in the middle of a morning lesson, just as I asked the class a question and Chaney raised her hand to respond while ignoring a slew of hostile glances from her classmates, we were suddenly interrupted by loud voices. Chaney’s hand froze mid-movement. I almost dropped my chalk. The loud voices continued.

I studied my class. They were all quiet, staring at me with frightened gazes. There was no one else in the room. Tentatively, I walked out to the door and checked the hallway. It was empty. Then I walked over to the only window in the classroom and checked the picture outside. There was no one there. I wiped my forehead, as the voices paused. Chaney raised her hand again.

And then they returned, even louder than before.

“WHAT is that?” Mitch asked without bothering with the hand-raising, striving to make himself heard over the voices.

I paused the lesson and checked with the teacher next door, a sullen brunette named Angela. She looked at me like I was crazy. After checking with the rest of the teachers, it soon became clear that the only places the mysterious voices were heard in was….my classroom.

“Probably just the construction guys,” was the ultimate verdict, carried out by Kenan, another teacher. “Wasn’t there some roof issues that needed some fixing?”

“I thought they fixed that in the summer?” I said, remembering a message about the repairs just before the school year ended.

“I don’t think anyone was here doing the summer,” said Barb, a fellow teacher. “If I were you, I wouldn’t worry about it. Though I get that you’re probably still jumpy from the candy incident. Can’t blame you there.”

I returned to my classroom slightly calmer. But the moment I opened my mouth, the loud voices returned. I returned to the window and gazed out onto the roof. It was empty.

“Did you find out what it was?” asked Sara, who was huddling in the corner with the other girls in the class, looking petrified.

“Construction,” I said. And then changed the lesson plan on the spot. I was going to show the educational cartoon during tomorrow’s lesson, but decided now would be a better time. After stopping by the school’s media center which was thankfully on the same floor, I verified that the DVD player and TV were available and wheeled them into my classroom. A moment later, I put on the cartoon and turned the volume all the way up, covering up the loud voices.

The students visibly relaxed. But five minutes later, there was a knock on the door. I tensed up but had no choice but to open it. It turned out to be Barb, who pulled me out into the hallway, fixing me with an angry gaze.

“Can you turn it down over there? No need to bring the voices into OUR classrooms.”

I had no choice but to comply. But the moment I turned the cartoon off, the loud voices returned. The same ones that no one outside of my classroom could apparently hear. The kids looked less panicked this time. Construction was a reasonable explanation to them. But I knew it was a lie.

After the school day ended, I headed straight for the principal’s office. Doug was known for his calm and friendly manner, but by the time I finished my story, he looked annoyed.

“The roof was finished over the summer,” he said. “And there was no more construction scheduled.”

“That’s right, so I---“

“I’ll ask my secretary to get in touch with those contractors. If they think they can just come by unannounced and bilk us for work that’s not needed, they have the wrong school.”

And that was that. With a sinking feeling, I realized I was the only one who suspected there was something much more sinister afoot than a random custodian with a drug issue. But I had no proof.

The next morning when I began my lesson, the loud voices had ceased. I was in the middle of answering Cameron’s question, when all of a sudden there was a loud bang. I turned around just as the only window in the classroom shattered. Suddenly, a drone flew around the classroom to the sound of mass screaming before colliding with Kelly seconds later, knocking her down with an oomph. After checking on Kelly, I ran to the window, but it yielded no clues. The road outside was just as empty as yesterday.

Thirty minutes later, Kelly was taken away on a stretcher. The drone was handed over to the police. And, by the end of the day, a hasty school-wide meeting was convened. During it, the school administration blamed the drone on “some kids on the playground flying it without supervision.” It was never mentioned who precisely those kids were or how they got their hands on a drone, never mind that I had looked out the window during the immediate aftermath and there had been no one there. Then there was the fact that the earliest recess hadn’t been due for at least another hour.

Right after the school assembly finished, Doug summoned me to his office. This time, he was less friendly than yesterday, flanked by his secretary who informed me our meeting was being recorded.

“I called the construction guys. It wasn’t them yesterday,” he said just as soon as I sat down, before adding: “Why is it that bad things keep happening in YOUR classroom?”

I told him I had no idea. Doug studied me suspiciously. The meeting proved to be a waste of time, as it soon became clear that he had settled on me as the ‘prime suspect.’ Just why I would be sabotaging my own job like that didn’t seem to even enter the picture, as Doug ended our meeting coldly.

“If anything else happens to the students, I won’t leave a stone unturned.” Somehow his tone of voice sounded threatening. Which is when I realized he was treating me like a suspect.

“Do you know what I’ve been doing this whole afternoon?” Doug suddenly turned outright hostile. “Fending off calls from concerned parents!”

I nodded, not wanting to set him off any further.

“I told them you’ll be getting in touch with them shortly.”

“I will.”

As I left his office, Doug gave me one last searching look. One I returned right back at him.

\*\*\*

The meetings were scheduled in fifteen minute intervals, with those who agreed to them. Ever since the fake Smarties incident, Henry’s and Barry’s parents had joined forces and lawyered up. Doug had made it clear that the school’s attorney would be the one handling them, so I skipped them in my calls. Kelly’s parents had a quick conversation with me over the phone, because they were still with her at the hospital. I couldn’t tell if they were buying the school’s excuse over what happened, but at least they seemed to believe me that I was as clueless as them about how a drone ended up in the classroom.

After my call with them was done, I set about meeting the rest of the students’ families face-to-face. Jack’s parents were the most laid-back about the whole thing. Perhaps because his dad was a former stuntman, and mother a skydiving instructor.

“Just tell them to knock it off,” Jack’s dad said after he and his wife excused themselves due to their ‘full schedule.’

“Them?” I asked, with no idea who he was referring to.

“The pranksters. Tell them it ain’t funny. Thank God Jack hates Smarties and is good at avoiding drones.”

Cameron’s parents were more concerned.

“How did that custodian get out of jail and launch a drone?” asked the mother, an accountant by trade, who spent our whole meeting egging on her psychiatrist husband to give me a “piece of his mind.” A request which he thankfully ignored.

“According to our school administration, the drone was actually launched by some kids fooling around on the playground,” I said without much conviction, which Cameron’s mom immediately seized upon.

“And how did they get the drone? Let me guess: they weren’t kids! They were the custodian’s accomplices!”

Her husband looked skeptical about his wife’s interpretation, but nevertheless kept me on my toes during my whole time with them, treating me as if I was one of his patients. Only after he was satisfied that I truly knew nothing, did they leave my office, albeit reluctantly.

The rest of the parents were less memorable. Jill’s speech therapist mom, who was divorced from her wrestler dad, had come alone and rushed off to a dentist appointment soon after. Leon’s grandfather came instead of his parents, looking at me suspiciously for the duration of our interaction. It turned out his parents were on vacation overseas and he didn’t want to worry them. Meanwhile, Harriet’s and Sara’s moms, who worked in the same tech start-up, came together, treating the whole meeting as a gossiping session. Without much prodding, they made it clear they suspected these “unfortunate events” were the doing of Caleb’s father, a never do well who was currently incarcerated, in the same jail as the school’s custodian incidentally.

“But how was he able to get out of there without anyone noticing?” I asked, to which neither had a response.

Sally’s father came with his girlfriend, who wanted to leave as soon as they sat down. I couldn’t tell if she was the reason behind his nervousness, or if there was something else at play. At one point, it almost felt like I was interviewing him rather than the other way around. In contrast, Mitch’s father, a CEO of a car dealership, was more assured, stopping by my office with both Mitch’s mother and her new husband.

“If we hadn’t divorced, Mitch would not be attending this school,” he said, to which Mitch’s mother had no response. They quickly pulled Mitch out of the school shortly after.

Jerry’s twenty-something sister, a law school student, came in place of his parents, threatening to “bust the school’s balls” if “this harassment wasn’t taken care of ASAP.”

The last to show up were Chaney’s parents, accompanied by her brother. All three seemed more concerned about the bullying Chaney faced than the happenings in the classroom.

“The girls won’t talk to her,” her mother, a hairdresser, cried. “She sits alone at lunch. Spends her recess counting down the minutes to when she can go back to class. It’s unnatural.”

“The boys are even worse,” her father, an engineer, added. “They threatened to beat her up if she keeps raising her hands in class, and laugh at her behind her back.”

“I’ll try to talk to them,” I said. “Chaney is a great student, and sometimes it’s hard for those more…academically gifted to be liked by their classmates.”

“They don’t like seeing someone smarter than themselves,” Chaney’s brother Cannon suddenly spoke up. He looked about twenty, with striking blue eyes and wavy brown hair.

“Don’t worry, I have Chaney’s back,” I said. But the truth was, I was no longer the teacher I had been even a month ago, with my nerves growing more rattled by the day.

\*\*\*

It happened again the next morning, in the most unexpected of ways. It was still early morning, and my classroom was empty. The trash can was still overflowing from the day before, and the desks looked a little dirty. Evidently while the school had been quick to fire the custodian, they had been less quick when it came to finding his replacement.

As I was wiping down one of the desks near the window, I heard a commotion outside. A moment later, I found the source of it: a gray Ford F-series pick-up that looked remarkably similar to my own car. Two tall figures with baseball caps pulled on low and face masks shielding their faces, were struggling with three little girls, pushing them inside the car. My heart skipped a beat as I realized I wouldn’t be able to get there in time, so I started pounding on the window furiously, banging on the parts of it that still had intact glass that is, since it had still not been repaired after the drone incident due to the contractors insisting they could only get it done over the weekend, which was still another two days away.

But my actions only served to embolden the men. And that’s when I recognized that the girls they were shoving in the back seat, were none other than Harriet, Sara, and Jill. I ran out of the classroom and down the hallway, exiting the school—just as the pick-up pulled away from the curb.

\*\*\*

The abduction finally did what even the fake Smarties and ill-flown drone couldn’t do: force the school to up its security. For the first time ever, police officers were stationed around the school and outside all of its exits. There were constant meetings with the school staff, the school parents, and the students themselves.

Notably, after a well-attended start of the year, the absences suddenly began to pile up. Not just in my class, but the others as well, as many parents got the jitters. Unlike the fake Smarties, which had been blamed on the drug-taking custodian, and the drone, which had been blamed on kids fooling around on the playground, there was no explanation over what happened to Harriet, Sara, and Jill.

\*\*\*

“Today, we’ll be watching a fun video about the alphabet,” I said a couple of days later, once things had somehow calmed down, though they truly never really did. My class, which had started out with fourteen students, was now down to seven, after two were poisoned, one was injured by the drone, three were abducted, and one was pulled out of school by his worried parents. Little Jack, Cameron, Leon, Caleb, Sally, Jerry, and Chaney looked up nervously at me, as I turned their attention to the TV.

Shortly before the class had started, I had heard Jack brag about how his father a former stuntman, signed him up for karate reasons in the light of everything that happened. Cameron, who had been the recipient of this tidbit, had responded that his own father, a psychiatrist, had signed him up for therapy. Their little exchange had then prompted a reaction from Caleb, who had said that *his* father had somehow managed to send him a makeshift dagger from his jail cell, so he could better “protect himself.” And then, to the sound of oohs and aaahs, Caleb showed it to them in-person, scaring little Sally with its presence.

In a moment, I was transported back to my conversation with Harriet’s and Sara’s mothers who had accused Caleb’s incarcerated father of being behind everything. Evidently not, I decided, studying Caleb’s scared face.

As the kids were watching the video, I allowed myself to relax for its thirty minute duration. Caleb carrying around a dagger and showing it off to his fellow first-graders was wholly inappropriate, and I was thinking about how to deal with it without offending him, when my thoughts were interrupted by one of the kids screaming.

I jumped up from my desk and ran up to them, with my heart pounding a million times a minute, as the fake Smarties, window-smashing drone, and straight up abduction played out in my mind over and over again.

“What’s wrong?” I managed, looking at the eight little heads in front of me. There were police officers all over the place now. There was no way anything else could happen. Right?

“Look!” Sally yelled out while pointing to the screen, her chubby cheeks glistening with tears.

I scrambled to think what might have been scary about the video, which used a cartoon of smiling animals to help the first graders learn the alphabet. And then I looked at the screen.

Somehow, the images of friendly animals had been replaced by images of figures in dark capes and green ghoulish masks. They were hovering around a little boy, whose head was turned to the camera. He was screaming his head off as one of the figures grabbed his neck, positioned a knife, and---

I turned the damned thing off, blocking the screen with my body. How could something so gruesome and disgusting find its way onto the DVD? And then I froze, as I remembered. I had kept the DVD on top of my desk, with a sticky note for when I was planning to use it. Anyone with dark intentions could’ve easily grabbed it off my desk and…replaced it with *this*.

My heartbeat quickened. The failure to guard the candy; now the failure to guard the DVD. It was my fault all over again. But how was this possible? There were now cops all over the place. How could someone get into the classroom now, remove my DVD, and replace it with this…horror, all the while remaining undetected?

I swallowed hard as I wheeled away the TV. The DVD had been in the same case as the authentic one. Had even started the same way. There had been no reason to suspect there had been anything wrong with it. I shuddered as the images from the fake DVD replayed in my mind. I would be going to Doug’s office the moment the school day ended.

“C-can I talk to you?” The voice eased me out of my stupor. It was Sally, her eyes wide in terror. Unlike Chaney, she had been friends with Harriet, Sara, and Jill, and since their disappearance, her cheerful demeanor had turned into one of constant fear. With no one left to share her girly talk with, she had at last turned to Chaney, awkwardly attempting to strike up conversations with her after by turns ignoring her or joining the other girls in taunting her for the last month in a half.

“Can it wait until after class?” I asked her, cognizant of the stares from the rest of the children, centered squarely on us.

“I want to talk to you now,” Sally said, her voice getting louder. “P-please.” She gazed up at me with those wide scared eyes, and my heart broke for her. I was of course the grown up in this situation. The authority. I could never confess to her that I was just as scared as she was. Just as unable to make sense of what was happening.

“Fine,” I said somewhat reluctantly. As we exited the classroom, I left the door ajar. If something happened during the next two minutes, I would at least hear it.

“I saw them,” Sally said as soon as we were in the hallway. Her voice sounded a little calmer now that we were outside of the cursed classroom, but her eyes betrayed the same fear.

“Saw who?” I asked, thinking about the weirdos from the video, which was every parents’ worst nightmare. Who in their right mind would do something like this? And who was that poor child they had been tormenting?

“Harriet and Sara. I saw them near the school.”

“What?!”

“This morning.”

“How is that possible?”

Sally shrugged.

“I waved at them and they didn’t wave back.”

“Where are they now?” I asked, thrown off by the unexpected direction our conversation had taken.

“Don’t know. The bad men took them.”

“Yes, a couple of days ago.”

“No, today.”

I stared at her. But before I could ask her more, there was a noise from inside the classroom. Our conversation was finished.
