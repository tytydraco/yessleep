To start this story off, I have to explain that I found this document in my grandfather’s closet. He was always an outgoing, charming man who never seemed to have enemies. I believe he is the subject in this story. As you can imagine, discovering something this shocking about a family member has been difficult. If anyone has insight on what this might be, or why he would have this writing, I’d deeply appreciate it.

**Interview Transcript: July 5th, 2027** **Location:** Nebraska State Police Department **Interrogating Officer:** Detective James Davis **Subject Name:** Unknown **Physical Description:** Male, approx. 5’10.5”, dark brown/black hair, blue eyes, lean build, unusually attractive

***Davis:*** *Hello. How are you doing today, sir?* ***Subject:*** *About as good as anyone could be, given the circumstances. (He chuckles softly. It’s not nervous. It’s amused.)* ***Davis:*** *Right. I can see that. You want something to drink or eat? You must be starving.* ***Subject:*** *A water would be nice, thank you.*

*(Detective Davis steps out momentarily. Surveillance footage shows the subject sitting perfectly still while waiting. No signs of stress or discomfort.)*

***Davis:*** *Alright. Let’s not waste time. You know how this looks. Just be honest—did you do it?* ***Subject:*** *No. I would never.* ***Davis:*** *Then tell me your side of the story.*

*(The subject calmly takes a sip of water. He sets it down without a sound. His posture is casual. No sign of fear.)*

***Subject:*** *I’m homeless. I was just looking for shelter. The barn was unlocked and it was freezing. I know I was trespassing, but I didn’t have much choice.* ***Davis:*** *Go on.* ***Subject:*** *I heard a scream. Loud. I ran toward it and saw a man—being mauled by a bear. Big one. I couldn’t stop it. When it was done, I tried to help, but he was already gone. I swear I tried.* ***Davis:*** *You’re saying a bear did that to Cooper Johnson?* ***Subject:*** *Yes, sir.* ***Davis:*** *You see where it went?* ***Subject:*** *I think it ran off behind the fence. I didn’t follow. I was in shock.* ***Davis:*** *What brings you to Nebraska?* ***Subject:*** *I’m a traveling musician. Folk music. I play in small towns, bars, anywhere people will listen. I try to bring something beautiful to places that feel forgotten.* ***Davis:*** *My son loves folk music. That’s a kind thing to do.* ***Subject:*** *I just do what feels right. Music, kindness, surviving.*

*(Davis looks at the subject for a long moment, then reaches into a folder and pulls out a tablet. He sets it on the table.)*

***Davis:*** *That’s a hell of a story. But there’s something I want you to see.*

*(He taps play. Surveillance footage from the barn appears. It's black-and-white, slightly grainy. The subject is standing still. Cooper Johnson enters from the left. No conversation is exchanged. The subject approaches him slowly, raises something in his hand, and slits Cooper’s throat in one fluid motion. Johnson collapses. Blood pools quickly. Then the feed distorts. Static cuts in. A massive, twisted figure enters the frame. Its movement is wrong. Jagged. Flickering. It tears Johnson apart with unnatural speed. The blood is blindingly bright. The camera glitches heavily. When the feed returns, the subject is standing alone. Calm. Still. Covered in blood. Then the flashing of red and blue lights flood the barn from outside. The subject's face changes. Suddenly alert. Mouth open. Eyes wide with a rehearsed kind of shock.)*

***Davis:*** *So… what the fuck are you?*

*(The subject turns to Davis slowly. His expression is blank. His eyes are fixed, ice blue, too bright. They don’t blink. They don’t move. The air in the room seems to shift. Davis doesn’t speak again. The camera feed begins to glitch once more. The image distorts, warps, then goes black.)*

***\[END OF RECORDING\]***

*I’d love to write this off as a prank or someone’s twisted fiction, but the folder I found it in was tucked deep in a locked box, alongside my grandfather’s military discharge papers, a deed, and other official documents. This wasn’t just loose paper. It looked government-issued, with seals and serial numbers I don’t recognize. If anyone can verify whether this is real or part of some kind of case file classification system, I’d really appreciate it. I’m not trying to stir up conspiracy or drama, I just… I need to know I’m not going crazy. Whatever this is, it’s shaken me.*
