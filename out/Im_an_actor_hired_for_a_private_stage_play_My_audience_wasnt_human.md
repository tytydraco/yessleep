I’m a freelance actor. Well, a self-proclaimed freelance actor, if I’m being honest, as I have never received any proper training in acting. A few years ago, I dropped out of my literature degree to pursue this career after achieving some minor successes, including acting in student projects and local theatre.

I moved to a big city, eyes widened by the dream of making it big. Yet, the consequences of this decision soon hit me like a truck. I struggled to find any roles, was too broke to take up an acting class, and was too proud to come back home. I was on the verge of being homeless when a strange number called on my phone.

“Mr. Mike?” A middle-aged woman's voice came from the speaker. “You can call me Mrs. Thatcher. I’m urgently looking for an actor to perform in a private stage play. Can we meet in person to discuss the details?”

It was unheard of for someone to contact me directly to offer a role. Perhaps my luck had finally turned around, and some big shot finally recognized my talent? Either way, I immediately agreed to the appointment.     

A few hours later, I awaited my guest at a nearby cafe. Mrs. Thatcher arrived in a black SUV. The woman was in her late forties, of average height. She wore an all-black suit, a huge trench coat, and a fedora, reminding me of a detective or an agent. After briefly exchanging pleasantries, my guest got straight to the point.

“The performance is for my father, Mr. Roger. Back in his youth, the man was a huge theatrophile and an aspiring writer. He used to write hundreds of scripts in the hope of making it to Broadway. Unfortunately, his writing career never took off, and eventually, he had to abandon his dream to find another job that could support his family.

Three months ago, father was diagnosed with stage four cancer, and his health has rapidly deteriorated since then. Before he leaves this world, our family hopes to fulfill father’s lifelong dream of seeing his own scripts performed on a big stage. That’s the play I’m hiring you to take part in, Mr. Mike.”

“That was such a touching story, Mrs. Thatcher, but if I may ask, why hire only me? Isn’t it better to hire a professional troupe? Surely you don’t expect me to play every role by myself?”

“We did hire a drama troupe, and a luxurious venue, if I may add. However, an actor was injured in a car accident yesterday, and my family wants the play to be exactly two days from now, on father’s birthday, so I need a replacement as soon as possible. A friend of mine teaches at your university, and she recommended you. She told me you were decent at acting and very adaptable, the perfect solution for my issue.”
“I see. But you say the play is only two days away. I’m not sure if I can make preparations in time.” I answered nervously. This performance was such an emotionally weighted occasion for Mrs. Thatcher and her poor father. I dreaded messing it up. And knowing myself, I’d have totally messed it up.     

“Don’t worry, you only have to play a minor role, the protagonist’s steward. Your character has basically no line. His only role is to follow the lead around on stage, so as long as you don’t make a fool out of yourself up there, you will be fine. Also, we are having continuous rehearsals from this afternoon until the D-day, so you should catch up in no time! Oh, and I almost forgot. I’m paying you handsomely as well.”

The payment offer really hit the spot as I was desperate for money. I immediately agreed, convincing myself that this was going to be an easy gig. Mrs. Thatcher drove me home to pack my stuff and then headed to the rehearsal right away. She also gave me the script to skim through while in the car.   

Mr. Roger’s story followed a young prince whose kingdom was invaded by an evil empire. He managed to slip away alongside a loyal steward by escaping into a cursed forest that the empire's soldiers didn’t dare enter. Turns out, the forest was home to a tribe of fae. After proving his bravery to the fae king, the prince received the king’s grace and led a fae army to retake his kingdom.

I finished going over the script just as we arrived at the venue, a classical cathedral-like theatre on top of an isolated hill. The interior design followed the Renaissance style with a proscenium stage, spacious auditorium, and multiple levels of balconies. This venue’s luxury and elegance overwhelmed me, as I had never dreamed of setting foot in such a grand theatre, let alone performing in one. “Mr. Roger must have been the greatest dad in the world if his children are willing to blow this kind of money just to fulfill their old man’s dying wish!” I thought to myself.

Mrs. Thatcher led me into the backstage area, which was also big and well-equipped. About fifty people were running around back there, both actors and backstage staff, all appeared tense and focused. We headed toward a handsome, blonde young man in a prince's outfit. Despite his age, he seemed to be the one in charge, ordering people around with a cold, demanding voice.

“Mike, this is Alan, the director and lead actor of the show.” Mrs. Thatcher introduced.

“Hi, I’m Mike. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m still an amateur, but I’ll do my best, so looking forward to learn from you!” I smiled and extended my hand, offering a friendly handshake. 

Alan, however, completely ignored me. Instead, he turned to Mrs. Thatcher with a pissy tone.

“What is this, Thatcher? Where is Luthor?” 

“Alan, as I have told you, Luthor broke his leg in an accident. He’s rapidly recovering but won’t make it in time for the play. Mike here will be Luthor’s replacement.”

“I have trained with Luthor for years, and now, you expect me to work with this third-rate fool?”

“Yes, Alan, I fully expect you to do anything, as long as it helps the play proceed without any more issues. It’s your duty, afterall!”

“Fine!” Alan’s voice boomed in anger. After a deep breath, he turned to me. “Listen here, Miguel, this play is of utmost importance for us, so you will not mess it up! From now on, you do exactly what I say! Copy? Now go line up with other actors, we are rehearsing right away!”

“I know what to do. And my name is Mike, not Miguel!” I protested, but he ignored me.

Alan was obviously a megalomaniac, and I hated his guts. Taking up both the lead role and the director position, who did this guy think he was? Also, did he demand that his friend keep performing despite their injury? I had to repeatedly convince myself that the gig was only for two days and that I would soon receive my compensation.

The following days were a blur in my mind. We practiced intensively until my body was almost at breaking point. Still, I was happy to learn from my fellow actors, who were all adept professionals. Despite his rough demeanor, Alan was competent at both acting and directing, so I only had to follow him around, which made my job much easier. 

Strangely enough, despite having a large cast, most of them only played soldiers who chased the prince around. I only saw two people acting as fae, and the fae king’s actor never showed up for rehearsal. When I brought this up to Alan, he brushed it off and yelled at me to focus on my own movement. I asked Mrs. Thatcher when she checked up on us, and she told me a famous actor would play that role, but since he was busy, he would only show up on the D-day.

One hour before the play, I had just finished putting on my servant costume when Mrs. Thatcher called for me individually. She took me up to a balcony directly facing the stage, where an old man in a wheelchair was waiting for me. Mr. Roger looked pale, wrinkled, and fragile, as if a single breath would blow him to pieces. He sat motionless on the chair, the only movement coming from his eyes. 

“My father recently suffered from a stroke. His condition is getting worse by the day. Still, he wants to greet you in person before the play begins.” Mrs. Thatcher explained.

“I’m honored, sir!” I bent over and lightly shook his hand. The man didn’t respond, obviously, but his eyes gave me a gentle and approving look, albeit with a bit of sadness. Upon standing up, I noticed a strange tattoo on his palm - two question marks and an exclamation mark, both yellow, joined by a dot to form some sort of crown. 

“Father has a soft spot for the steward character. Fifty years ago, he performed this script with his childhood friends, playing the same role. Perhaps you remind him of his youthful self. Anyway, you should return to your position. We wish you the best of luck tonight.”

And so, my fateful performance began. From backstage, the auditorium was pitch-black, and the stage itself felt like the sole remaining piece of reality floating above a sea of eternal darkness. Before our entrance, Alan nagged at me one final time: “Remember, stick to the script, no matter what happens!” After practising for two days straight, I was too stressed and tired to respond, so I just gave him a quick nod. 

The first act proceeded without an issue. A few dozen soldiers chased the prince and his servant around until we reached the cursed forest on the opposite side of the stage, indicated by a few plastic tree props. But the moment Alan and I exited behind the curtain to prepare for the second act, when we met the fae king, something changed. The temperature suddenly dropped to freezing. The backstage area was devoid of light, even though we had left an LED bulb on, and no staff member was in sight.   

Before I could calm down, Alan pulled my hand, signaling our entrance for act two. All the lights had gone dark except for a dim spotlight shining on Alan and me. Layers of thick shadow covered almost the entire stage, giving it a gloomy, mysterious vibe. Around us, weird statues depicting dancing people in questionable poses spread around the scene, and at the centre of them all was the fae king’s majestic throne, towering at almost twice our height. 

“How did the staff move all these props so quickly and silently? They must be real pro!” I admired in silence.

Atop the throne was the fae king, his entire body covered in darkness. All I could see was a red and white clown masquerade mask covering the upper half of his face. He spoke in a powerful, yet filtered, insect-like voice, making a great impression of something non-human.

*“Why had you entered our domain, mortal?”*

“I’m Prince Alan the XXVIII. Those savage, witless brutes from the empire have invaded my home, slaughtered my family, and enslaved my people. I wish to seek the power from the old Gods of the cursed forest to take back what is mine, and to exact revenge upon my enemies!”

*“Ah, thirst for vengeance, thirst for destruction. We like vengeance, we like destruction, we like fresh meat! But our grace, our power, vast and eternal, does not come cheap. What price are you willing to pay, little prince? Hehehe!”* 

“Anything! My soul, my bloodline, my kingdom. Whatever you ask for!”

*“Hehehe! Bold talker you are, little prince. Very well, come before us, and we will see if you are as good as your words!”*

I tried to keep a straight face as the scene unfolded, but inside, I was totally panicked. “Something was wrong here. None of these lines was in the script. Did these two just have their moment of enlightenment and start freestyling? Also, did Alan just use his own name for the prince? What the hell are they thinking?” 

Alan moved forward as the king ordered, but not before whispering to me to keep it to the script. I was getting back at him with a witty remark about how he broke his dialogue first, but as Alan took his steps, the ceiling light turned on one by one, illuminating a hellish scene that froze me in fear. 

The dozens of statues surrounding us weren’t statues at all. They were all living humans, made of flesh and blood. “Living” might not have been the right word to describe these poor souls, as they had all been completely flayed, exposing all veins and muscles. Only two flaps of skin remained on each one’s back, stretched out to imitate pairs of fairy wings. Wooden stakes pierced their limbs and torsos, immobilizing them in their perverted poses. Golden stitches sewed their mouths shut, as if they were stuffed toys. Yet, their eyes still moved erratically, and their chests pounded lightly every few seconds, telling me they were alive.

As horrifying as these human statues were, their suffering was trivial in comparison to the fae king. Not only was his skin flayed, but all his bones except the skull were also ripped out and then stuck back together to build the throne he was sitting on. The king’s head was entirely cut off from his neck. His lower jaw was broken, hanging danglingly under the upper jaw. Yet, somehow, his eyes still showed signs of life, and the exposed heart on his chest still beat. Darkness enveloped the king’s back, despite the ceiling light shining directly above him, and from there, two insect claws emerged, holding the king’s head.

I dropped to the floor and threw up on the spot. “Fuck, fuck, fuck! What kind of sick joke is this? Is this some VR special effect experiment? Am I in a nightmare!? Please wake up! Please wake up! Please wake up right now!” I kept hitting myself, hoping this was all a bad dream. 

The loud noise attracted the entity’s attention. It turned the king’s head toward me and manually moved his jaw to mimic the act of speaking.

*“What do we have here, a new face! Oh, how exciting! Tell me, prince, has your old steward already kicked the bucket? Hehehe, trick question! If he did, we would already know!”*   

“Director Roger’s health is in critical condition. He is here with us tonight in the auditorium, but is unable to perform. Instead, we provided a new witness, a new messenger, one who is unaware of our tradition, as you have demanded last time.” Alan answered calmly.

*“You humans are always so thoughtful, so trustworthy. But tell us, little prince, would you have followed my demand if your friend Luthor hadn’t gotten gravely injured in the accident? I think not. Humans, always feel yourself as smart, trying to trick us with your petty schemes!”*

 “I…” Alan stuttered, his mask of bravery completely felt off, and he now shook in fear, trying to come up with an answer. “We thought one of our experienced agents would be of better service to you!”

*“Hehehe, if you say so! Oh, come on, don’t be so afraid, little prince. Your fate will be the same, no matter what. And, fortunately, we’re quite fond of your new friend here! Now then, why don’t we introduce ourselves first?”*

The entity emerged from the shadows and moved toward me, revealing itself as a giant, headless tarantula with eight massive, razor-sharp, clawed legs. Thousands of smaller spiders crawled on its back, fighting and eating each other. The entity still held on to the king’s head with its two front legs, continuing to move its jaw as it spoke.

*“Hehehe, not the talkative type, eh? No problem, we already knew everything about you!” The spider lifted my face with one of its legs, looking directly at the king’s head. “Let’s see, literary background? Acting experiences? Good, good! But you need to learn some manners! It’s rude to ignore someone when they greet you, you know? Hehehe! Now, say something!”*

Overwhelmed by shock, terror, and above all, confusion, I could only mutter: “What… are you…”
    
*“Now we’re having a conversation! Us? We are the fae, of course, haven’t you read your own script? Though we’re not the fae king. We’re merely actors, spokespersons for his liege. And fae is not our real name. It’s only a term that came up by fearful humans after you all abandoned us to follow the big man in the sky. No, we are Gods. Ancient, mighty deities who once ruled over all existence!”*

“Gods? Then what… what do you want from us?”

*“Hehehe, a thousand years ago, an ancestor of Alan over there made a deal with our king, trading power for his entire kingdom and bloodline. We had owned this land and its people since then! But lucky for you all, we are merciful Gods. We only demand basic necessities, bread and circuses, as your kind said. Every few years, Alan’s family has to come and give us some food and entertainment. That's all we ask for. But you, you are no food. You are our witness and messenger, delivering our wills to the mortal world. Now then, let's begin your first day at work!”* 

The spider casually extended its back legs, piercing Alan’s chest, making him scream in agony at the top of his lungs. Right after that, the auditorium lights turned on, uncovering hundreds of disturbing monsters, each more horrifying than the last. They started rushing toward the stage, and my survival instinct finally kicked in, allowing my legs to run as fast as they could toward the backstage. 

Upon slipping behind the curtain, I somehow found myself back at the original stage. All other actors and staff members were there, forming a defensive formation with their plastic swords and shields. I screamed at them to run, but before I could finish my sentence, a giant two-headed wolf with a third head inside one of their mouths lunged toward those people, broke the formation, and crushed some of them with its fangs. 

I jumped down the stage and stumbled through the pitch-black auditorium, trying to find the exit as more monsters flooded out from behind the curtains. I finally found the front door, but standing there, blocking my way, was Mr. Roger, still sitting in his wheelchair, tears running down his cheeks. “We need to move, now!” I shouted and reached for his chair, but with a sudden burst of strength, Roger moved his hand slightly and grabbed mine. My palm felt an immense pain, as if burned by a melting metal rod. 

The giant spider appeared behind us, followed by another entity. This second creature had a humanoid silhouette, but its entire body somehow felt even darker, more sinister, and more empty than the darkness surrounding us. The only thing I could make out from this figure was a pale yellow scarf wrapped around its neck, tied into a hood that covered its head.    

*“The transition is completed. Please, enjoy your aged delicacy, my liege!”* The spider bowed to the second entity. Then, he turned to me. *“As for you, messenger, we have an important message. Tell your bosses their little stage play has gotten stale, and we demand something new, something related to your flashy new internet technologies. If you try to pull any other scheme, we won’t be so merciful next time!”* 

After finishing his speech, the spider slammed me into the nearby wall with its leg, knocking me unconscious. I woke up in my apartment an hour ago. A crow tattoo, similar to Roger’s, appeared on my palm, letting me know that it wasn’t all just a dream. I don’t have much time left. A black SUV is coming toward my apartment, probably Thatcher and her men. I don’t know if they are government agents or devil-worshipping cultists, but I’m sure they will not let me get away easily. It may have been too late for me to ask for help now, but if someone, anyone, knows about these people and those creatures, please tell me what the hell happened and what I should do now.
