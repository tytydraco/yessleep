I used to stare out through the cracked, blackened bars of my window and dream about escaping into the shadows. The chain that bound me to my bed was just long enough to let me reach the window ledge, so every night, after my father would lock the door from the outside, I would lie in silence, watching the dark settle over the earth, waiting for the last whispers of the day to die away.

I’d listen to the low rustle of the trees and the faint scratchings from somewhere outside, where I imagined things that lived beyond the light, things that crept through the night unnoticed. I knew they saw me too, just beyond the window, held tight in their ghostly gaze.

Then, one midnight as I lay awake, something impossible happened. I had drifted off into a restless sleep, only to be awakened by a quiet tapping on the glass. Rubbing my eyes, I looked up to see an owl perched just outside, its hollow eyes staring right into mine.

I crawled over to the window, feeling the cool metal of the bars, and whispered to the creature, “Hello, Mr. Owl.”

“Hello, little one,” the owl replied, in a voice that sounded like distant thunder.

I froze, unsure if I was still dreaming, my pulse loud in my ears. Finally, I managed to speak.

“Do you know how to talk?” I asked.

“All creatures do,” he replied softly. “But not all listen closely enough to hear.”

The owl blinked, its large, unblinking eyes reflecting shadows that seemed to twist and writhe. He cocked his head and said, “Why do they keep you in a cage?”

I looked down at my bound feet and muttered, “I think it’s my fate.”

He only nodded, watching me as if he knew all my secrets.

He flew off silently into the night, leaving me to drift into a sleep filled with shadowed wings and low voices. And each night, he would return, with secrets of the dark to share, tales of things that slithered beneath the ground and spirits who whispered in forgotten tongues.

As winter crept in, our conversations grew longer, filled with warnings about the cold and what it brought with it. “The frost isn’t the only thing that stirs in the dark,” he said one night. I didn’t understand what he meant, but I felt a chill even in my sleep.

Finally, the first night of snowfall came, blanketing everything in eerie silence. I lay awake, waiting for the owl’s familiar tap, but he didn’t come. Instead, a strange darkness gathered outside, blotting out even the dim moonlight. Then, without warning, I heard scratching, louder than before, like a hundred claws against the walls.

Suddenly, there was a loud crash, and the window shattered, the glass exploding inward. Something pale slipped through the bars, long and twisting, filling the room with an unnatural chill. It whispered to me in a voice colder than ice, calling my name, echoing the words I had shared with the owl night after night.

As I felt its touch, cold and consuming, a shiver ran through me—a silent scream caught in my throat. The room was dark, filled with shadows that moved and pulsed like a living thing.

The next morning, when the first light crept over the horizon, there was nothing left but a single feather on the floor and the distant cry of an owl that sounded almost like laughter.

And now, every night, I hear that familiar tap, but when I look, there is nothing there. Only darkness and the faint memory of a promise I made, echoing back to me, calling my name, again and again.
