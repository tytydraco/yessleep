Three years ago, I found a job listing that intrigued me. 

"Night Watchman Needed. Excellent Pay. No Experience Necessary. Discretion Required."   


The ad had no company name, no contact info beyond an email address. I was between jobs, desperate, and curious enough to apply.

The response came fast. A single-line email with an address, a time, and the instruction: **"Arrive alone."**

The building was a nondescript warehouse on the edge of town, surrounded by nothing but dead grass and cracked pavement. Inside, a man in a gray suit greeted me. He didn’t introduce himself. He just handed me a contract with thick black lines through most of the text.

He then tapped my shoulder and said, “Hey kiddo, sign here if you want the job.”

The pay was obscene. $75 an hour for six-hour shifts, five nights a week. I didn’t ask questions. I signed.

The job was simple: Sit in a small, windowless room with a single monitor displaying a live feed. Once an hour, type a brief log about what I saw. That was it. No cameras in my room, no visitors, no talking. A red button on the desk labeled "ALERT" was my only means of **communication** with the outside world.

The first night, I watched a white room, sterile, brightly lit. In the center sat a wooden chair. And in that chair sat a man. He didn’t move, didn’t speak, didn’t react to anything. He just stared forward, unblinking.

I logged it: “Subject seated. No movement.”

Every night was the same. He never moved. Never ate. Never slept. Just sat.

By the third week, I convinced myself he was a dummy. A prop. Some weird experiment. But then one night, at exactly 3:33 AM, he smiled.

It was small, subtle. Just a flicker of movement at the corner of his mouth. But I saw it. I was sure of it. I hesitated before typing my log.

“Subject seated. Minimal movement. Possible facial expression change.”

The next night, his eyes moved.

Not much. Just a slight flick toward the camera. Toward me.

I hit the red button.

Seconds later, a reply appeared on my screen: “Maintain observation. Log activity. Do not interact.”

I wanted to quit, but the money was too good. So I stayed.

The nights dragged on. He moved more. His head tilted. His fingers twitched. And every time, I reported it, and the response was always the same: "Maintain observation. Log activity. Do not interact."

Then, one night, he stood up.

I stared, heart hammering. He shouldn’t be able to do that. He had sat there, motionless, for over a month.

I hit the red button.

The response was instant: “Maintain observation. Log activity. Do not interact.”

I watched, frozen, as he took one step forward. Then another. His eyes locked onto mine through the screen.

I couldn’t breathe.

He grinned.

Then the feed cut to black.

The door behind me clicked open.

I turned slowly. The chair from the white room was now in the center of my observation room.

Empty. Waiting.

A new message appeared on my monitor:

“Please take your seat."

I didn’t move. My entire body screamed at me to run, but my legs refused to work. The door was still open, but the hallway beyond was pitch black. I had never seen the hallway dark before. It was always lit, sterile, like the room on the monitor.

Another message blinked onto the screen:

“Take your seat, Jacob.”

They knew my name.

The man on the monitor had never moved like this before. Never acknowledged me. But now he was gone, and the chair was here.

I backed away, pressing myself against the wall. The room felt smaller, the air thicker. I was about to make a run for it when the monitor flickered back on.

It wasn’t the white room anymore.

It was my observation room.

I saw myself on the screen, standing in the corner, staring in horror. And behind me...

The man.

He was right there, inches away. His grin stretched wider than should be humanly possible.

The screen cut to black again.

The lights flickered.

And then I felt breath on my neck.

I spun around, but the room was empty. My pulse pounded in my ears. The monitor flickered back on.

The camera feed showed the white room again. The chair was no longer empty.

I was sitting in it.

My breath caught in my throat. No. That wasn’t possible. I was standing right here.

The figure in the chair slowly lifted its head. My head. My eyes. My face. It grinned, wider and wider, until its skin cracked.

A new message appeared on the monitor.

**“Observation complete. Subject transfer successful.”**

I tried to move, but my body wouldn’t respond. My fingers tingled, my vision swam. The screen flashed one final message before the world around me faded into blinding white.

**“Welcome to your new position, Jacob.”**
