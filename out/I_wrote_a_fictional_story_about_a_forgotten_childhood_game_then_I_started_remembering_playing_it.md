I have a wildly unsuccessful YouTube channel—which I won’t name, because this isn’t about self-promotion. I make creepy shorts about internet mysteries, usually tied to lost media, digital folklore, or fringe psychology. Occasionally, I do longer deep dives into creepypasta and online horror stories—The Elevator Game, The Backrooms, The Russian Sleep Experiment. You get the idea. A few hundred views, if I’m lucky.

But the other day, I decided to try something different.  
I thought: what if I made a story up completely from scratch? No existing lore, no viral myth—just something **entirely fabricated**, but treated as if it were real. I'd give it layers, fake screenshots from old forums, speculative psychology, and subtle inconsistencies to make people ask, *“Wait… is this real?”*

So I made a video about a childhood game no one can fully remember. A game with no name.  
But certain details appear again and again in forum posts:

* A strange chant
* Vague rules
* Kids standing in a circle
* And something about… a man in a hat.

The chant was this:

**"Hop hop, hide hide or the man in the hat will find you at night."**

The story suggested that maybe we’re not *supposed* to remember this game. Maybe the memory gets… filtered. Suppressed. Or worse—rewritten.

The video flopped. Like, aggressively.  
No clicks, no interest. Total algorithmic rejection.  
But weirdly… I couldn’t stop thinking about it.  
That night, I couldn’t sleep. And I’m not easily spooked—I'm obsessed with horror. I seek it out. But something about *this* story was different. It made me feel like I had disturbed something quiet inside myself.

As I was writing it, I had this moment of self-reflection:  
Why *don’t* I remember how childhood games worked?  
I remember **playing**, sure.  
But not the rules. Not how they started. Not who taught them.  
There were elaborate adventures, imaginary battles, complicated rituals played out on cracked pavement with chalk and sticks… and I remember *none of the structure*. Just the feeling.

Then it hit me.

I think I actually **played** a version of this made-up game.

I vividly remember a version of Hopscotch that doesn’t match anything I can find online. The court had a head at the end. A man’s head. With a hat.  
I assumed I imagined it for the story. But now… I’m not so sure.

Curious, I googled the chant—*Hop hop, hide hide or the man in the hat will find you at night.*  
To my shock, the **AI Overview on Google** gave me a weird explanation, as if the line came from an actual nursery rhyme. Something about bunnies and sleep. I don't seem to be able to attach a screenshot, but you can try it for yourself (google the chant without quotation marks)

It sounded like a typical AI hallucination… but then I clicked through to the Wikipedia page it cited—about **shadow persons**.

And that’s when it got really strange.

Because apparently, **The Hat Man** is a well-known subtype of shadow person.  
Often associated with sleep paralysis and hallucinations.  
And when I mentioned this to my older brother, he casually said:

“Oh yeah—you used to have dreams about visiting the land of the Shadow People. You talked about it all the time as a kid.”

I had completely forgotten, but now I kinda remember - Did the Man in the Hat find me at night?

Not only that—I’ve written an entire unpublished fantasy novel where shadow people play a major role. A fictional invention, or so I thought.

So now I’m left wondering:  
Did I invent a creepypasta about a forgotten children’s game?  
Or did I *remember* something I was supposed to forget?

Something half-remembered.  
Something buried in chalk and dreams.  
Something that watches.

**Hop hop. Hide hide. Or the man in the hat will find you at night.**
