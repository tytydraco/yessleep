You don’t need to if you don’t wish to though.  

Now I know the last post was not overly scary. I decided to pick a more tame case to dip my toe into sharing my cases. I decided that this case I would say would be a little scarier for you all good people. 

Now my job is not just hunting down monsters. Sometimes I'm sent to explore certain places. Places we get reports that are haunted or had some strange thing in it. Once I got sent to a store with a living dummy. Another was a building that had a portal to a different dimension. The strangest was an apartment building. It’s how I got my cat actually. But that’s a case for a different day. 

This one was a tunnel. I got the case and drove myself to Minnesota. See there are a bunch of old mining tunnels in the state. I think they mostly do iron, but I didn’t really ask. I knew this one was no longer in use. 

People are not supposed to be in them. But that doesn’t stop stupid kids or explorers from entering them. We wouldn’t usually explore these types of things. I mean homeless people would be in them, other people scaring each other, the list is endless. 

But when teens say they have seen claw marks in the rocks or adults saying clicking noises have been echoing, we start to pay attention. A handful of people have also gone missing in the tunnel. So the director said it was best I went and checked it out. 

I parked as close to the tunnel as I could. I had a short little hike up, looking at the tunnel. I could see some graffiti around and inside. Simple hellos, signs, and those pictures you always see. One thing did stand out to me. Near the middle on the top, I saw a red circle drawn. It looked unfinished. A little line was drawn but looked like the person either ran off or fell before finishing it. 

“Well doesn’t this look creepy?” Hazel asked, looking into the dark hole. 

“I mean I guess,” I replied, turning on the flashlight I had. I took a step into the dark. 

I walked through the tunnel for a while. The drawings and paintings stopped after a good six minute walk. That isn’t always a good sign. After all, if people don’t go into free space to do their art, something is wrong. I looked around for any sign of some kind of creature being in the man made cave. 

I stopped when I saw four large claw marks in the stone. I lightly touched it, blinking a bit. This was deep. I didn’t know any creature from Earth that could do it. I thought at first maybe it was a bear or mountain lion. Granted I have no idea if either of those creatures are native to the state, but similar ones are. But this looked different than the marks you see in trees. And I don’t think any animal had claws that could make a deep mark in solid stone. I would guess they were a good eight or nine inches deep. 

“Well you don’t see that everyday, huh?” I asked Hazel. She looked at them with a frown. 

“Nope. I don’t know a lot of creatures that can do that. But a few come to mind. Make sure not to let your guard down. If it’s still in here, we don’t need you getting eaten.” 

“I didn’t plan on it. It might hurt.” 

I kept walking. I saw a few more of those marks, but no other signs of something. I would say I was walking a good twenty minutes before my foot hit something. I looked down and went wide eyed. 

It was a bone. 

It wasn’t a big bone. It looked more like a coyote or dog’s leg bone. I couldn’t say for certain, but that would be my best guess. I looked around and saw a few more bones. It looked like a mix of different creatures. And in the scattered remains, I saw a human skull. 

“Shit,” Hazel mumbled under her breath. “Something is eating good.” 

“Strange, they end,” I commented. The trail of bones did end. It was almost like a small path. I carefully followed the path. 

I shined my light at the area. It seemed darker than the other spaces. I saw a hole. Not a normal one made by a human with a machine mind you. Almost like those claws dug its way into the rock to make its own little den. I was careful not to try and disturb whatever was in there. That would be a one way ticket to a painful day. 

“Hazel, can you check that out?” I asked her. 

“On it.” 

I watched as my partner slipped into the hole. I saw the faint blue glow of her skin as she explored it. I waited as she looked. After a brief moment, she came back. 

“Good and bad news,” she told me. 

“Hm?” 

“Good news: it is not in the den. Bad news: it is not in the den.” 

“Any sign what it could be yet?” 

“Well… there is a huge egg sac in there.” 

“I’m sorry what?” 

“A- Mark look out!” 

I heard the clicking behind me as she yelled that. I quickly turned around, feeling the wind of a large clawed limb barely missing me. I looked to see what it was, but all I could see was the inky black that surrounded me. I moved the beam of light around, trying to see what was with me. But I couldn’t see anything. 

I heard the clicking again. It sounded behind me. No, beside me. No, I… I couldn’t tell at that moment. It was a far too small area I was in. The sound was echoing around the stone. I couldn’t see where it was and it was quick. I saw a small flash of dark brown moving out of the light. But not enough to say what was there. 

I pulled out my knife. I wasn’t going to let this thing get close if I could help it. My gun was too risky. It could ricochet off the stone and hit me if I missed. And that was a very likely option since I hadn’t even seen my attacker. 

All of a sudden a sharp pain hit my back. I yelled out in pain, trying to quickly turn around. But the claws were deep in my back, keeping me from turning. Let me tell you, it hurt like a bitch. Before I could turn my head, it threw me onto the ground with a loud thud. I coughed, my vision getting blurred. Then suddenly everything went black. 

I don’t know how long I was out. I was hearing something. It sounded like a voice. I couldn’t tell what it was saying. I slowly opened my eyes, groaning in pain. I could feel the pain in my back and heard dripping noise. I couldn’t tell at the time, but now I know it was the sound of my blood hitting the stone of the creature’s den. I felt my arms and legs wrapped up in something. I looked, seeing some strange orange web keeping me up to the walls. 

“Mark! Are you okay?” I heard the voice finally. It was Hazel. She was floating in front of me, looking worried. 

“Yeah… just a bit of pain. But I’ll make it,” I told her. “What happened?” 

“You got your shit rocked by a creature,” she chuckled a bit. “Need some help?” 

I nodded a bit, knowing I would need her help to get down. She carefully started to pull the orange webs off my arms. Before you ask, yes, Hazel can touch things. It is a bit hard for her to do so. So don’t ask if she can hold a gun or knife or something. She can, but she may drop it. That means she often just pulls things or points at things for me. Her knowledge is the best part of having her as a partner. 

“Man, this stuff is tough!” she groaned, trying harder to pull it off. She was making some progress, but not a lot. “What on Earth is it?” 

“That I don’t have a clue on,” I answered. 

That’s when we heard the clicking again. We both turned to look at the entrance of the den. That’s when I finally got a look at the creature. The only light was from Hazel, my flashlight nowhere to be seen anymore. In the dim blue light, I saw the large, black creature. 

It was a good seven to eight feet tall. Its black skin looked like that of a beetles, all glossy and exoskeletal like. It had eight large legs it was standing on. They all came to a point. Two large arms were in front of it, each with four large spikes at the end. Its head was like a praying mantis. The best way to describe it was like if a praying mantis, a spider, and a beetle had a baby. And that baby jumped into toxic waste from a comic book and grew to be bigger than a human. The head had a large mouth that was clicking every time it moved. 

I blinked a bit, looking at it. Its eyes were a dark grey, almost black. But it wouldn’t look at me or Hazel. It… It looked blind. Like the clicking it was doing was to see us. Echolocation maybe? Or maybe the clicking was a strange smell thing. I couldn’t tell. 

Hazel seemed to also connect those dots. She was going to be fine. Ghosts don’t give off scents or can really be located by echolocation. Only thermal means. But I was a different story. I wasn’t dead. I was giving off mass and scents. That’s why I was pinned to the wall. So I was easier to find when it was ready to eat me. 

She pulled even harder at the web. She had to get my arms free so I stood a better chance while she got my legs free. I watched the creature as she pulled at the webs. It walked over to a patch of the orange webs. I saw parts of a human with the flesh still on the bone. It looked like the torso with a few of the limbs still on it. From what I could tell, an arm and a leg. One arm and one leg were already gone as was the head. It was hard to fully see since it was wrapped up in that web. 

It ripped the arm off the body, pulling some of the flesh off the bone. It moved a bit and dropped the rest of it onto the web. That's when I noticed something even more horrifying than the giant bug. It was a bunch of tinier versions of it. They were the size of medium size dogs and were all rushing at the food. They ripped and pulled the meat with sickening noises. I had to do what I could not to lose my lunch right there. I may have seen a lot of things, but that doesn’t mean giant bugs eating a human was something I wanted to see or would get used to. 

“Hazel, please hurry up,” I whispered to her. I could feel the web loosening a bit. But it wasn’t enough for me to get free. 

The creature turned in our direction. It clicked a few times before walking towards me. It raised its giant claws to strike me. Most likely to chop me off into bits. It was going to hurt. 

“Got it!” Hazel cheered. I felt the web on my right arm give way. It was free. I reached down and pulled out my gun, aiming and shooting off one bullet. It hit the creature’s chest. It screamed in pain, stumbling back. I pulled out my knife and cut the web the rest of the way off. I looked at the creature. The bullet didn’t kill it. It was getting up again. It was clicking, trying to find me again. I was not about to stick around and find out how many bullets it would take to kill it. Not in its own lair. 

I rushed to the tunnel it had made, crawling out of it. I had to ignore the pain stinging my back. I was still cut and bleeding. But I had to ignore it for now. After all if I stopped, it would be able to find and catch me. I saw light at the end of the tunnel. My flashlight! 

I climbed the rest of the way out of the tunnel, grabbing the light. I could now see what I was doing. I looked around to try and find the claw marks in the walls. I could use them to find my way back the way I came. I started to run the way I thought was towards the exit. Come on, run faster! I nearly begged my legs. 

I could hear the clicking behind me. Large legs hitting the rocks as it rushed after me. It was a lot quicker than I could imagine. I felt another sharp pain in my leg. It hit me again. But I wasn’t going down. It was just a nick. It barely hit me, but it was enough to hurt like hell. I turned and shot another bullet, hoping it would either kill it or stop it for now. It cried out again, stopping again. 

I ran faster, breathing heavily. Come on, come on, come on! Was all I could think. I could see the light. But I would hear the clicking and the thuds behind me. I didn’t look back, even when I felt the claws behind me again. Barely missed. 

I burst out of the tunnel into the light. I covered my eyes as I ran. I didn’t stop running until I made it to my car. I quickly opened the trunk, looking around for something to help. But I didn’t hear the clicking again. I looked up and saw the creature still in the tunnel. It wasn’t following me anymore. It was clicking and standing like it was waiting for something. 

I watched it for a while. It stood there, doing nothing but standing. I watched it while it turned, walking back into its cave, its home. I pulled out a first aid kit, starting to wrap up my back and my leg. I had work to do. 

Once I was patched up, I grabbed a machine from my trunk. I walked back to the cave, making sure it was clear. I climbed up a rock a bit and placed the machine, hitting a button. Once it was working and I had stepped back, I couldn’t see the cave anymore. It was now just a normal looking mountain. No more humans will see the cave. That should stop some of the deaths. But not all. Not until we could get a team out here and get it back to her home dimension. 

I got in my car, breathing a bit. I let Hazel drive us back home. I was too tired and in too much pain to do so. When I got back to HQ, I sent a team with the info I had to make the cave clear again. After all, I couldn’t blame her. She just needed to eat and feed her kids. Humans were probably the best food she had gotten in a while. And I bet I was a good looking meal being a tall guy. I’m not a bodybuilder or anything, but I am in good shape. I was most likely a lobster dinner for her and her kids. I didn’t see the need to kill her. 

I mean I wouldn’t kill a bear for wanting to eat. I would if it tried to kill me of course, but I was able to get out. I didn’t want to block the cave either. After all, if wild animals walked in, she could eat them. She clearly did. 

I did get patched up. Kaya gave me hell about getting so hurt again. Kaya is the medic we have on staff. She also happens to be my best friend. I will tell you more about her another time. This post is getting pretty long. She patched me up and sent me on my way. 

I’m healed now. This case isn’t the most recent case. I mean that would be a simple hole I took care of. This one was from a few months ago. But hey, it was a far more creepy time than the last one. And I still have plenty of creepier cases. I also have plenty of tamer ones. I am happy to share plenty. 

For now, I do have to go. My cat is asking me to feed him and turn on the TV. It’s about time for Family Feud and he loves to guess what us silly humans are going to guess. He’s a wiz at the game shows. Spoiled thing. I’m coming, Farrell.
