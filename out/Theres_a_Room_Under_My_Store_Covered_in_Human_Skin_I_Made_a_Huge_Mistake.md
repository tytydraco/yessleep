**PART ONE- The Lease in the Woods**

I should’ve known something was off the second I signed the lease. It was too cheap. A fully-stocked, stand-alone general store deep in the woods —50$ a month, no questions asked. No electricity bill, no landlord check-ins. Just a rusted key, a contract that looked like it had been typed on a typewriter, and one line at the bottom in faded red ink:

***Don’t open the basement door.***

I laughed when I first saw that. Thought it was some small-town superstition bullshit. Something the previous tenant added to scare the next guy. Maybe they saw too many horror movies. Maybe they were just bored.

But now I know.  
Now, I f\*\*king know.

I moved in on a Friday, hauling a duffel bag full of clothes, a box of instant noodles, and a Bluetooth speaker. The store itself was eerie in that untouched kind of way. Like no one had entered it for years, but somehow everything inside was still fresh. Stocked shelves of canned food, stacked soda crates, old newspapers from 2012… and dust. So much dust.

There was no signal here—no Instagram, no WhatsApp, no GPS. The moment I crossed that winding dirt road and saw the outline of the store between the trees, my phone might as well have been a brick.

I liked it at first. Solitude. Silence. No honking cars. No toxic bosses. No pressure. Just me and a creaky old store in the middle of nowhere.

Until I heard the dragging sounds.

The first night, it came around 3:12 AM. I remember the exact time because I woke up needing to piss and saw the glowing red digits of my battery clock. That’s when I heard it—slow, wet dragging. Like something was being pulled across concrete. Or like a body with no limbs was trying to crawl.

It came from under the floor.

I froze. Held my piss in. Listened.

**Drag. Pause. Drag. Wet. Sticky.**

Then a soft *thump*. Followed by a gurgled moan—somewhere between a cry and an animal choking on its own blood.

I didn’t sleep that night. I sat with a rusted wrench I found behind the counter, eyes fixed on the trapdoor behind the shelves. The one I thought led to some dusty storage basement.

The one I was told not to open.

By day three, the store changed.

The canned food started swelling, bulging like something was growing inside. One tin exploded in the aisle—spraying a thick, grey-green sludge that smelled like rotting meat and bleach. I almost threw up. But what got me wasn’t the smell. It was what I found in the goo.

Teeth.  
Human teeth.  
Small ones. Like a child’s.

I stared at them for what felt like hours. Five tiny teeth, clean as porcelain, arranged in a perfect smile.

I should’ve left right then.

But I didn’t.

On the fifth night, the dragging turned into scratching.

Not animal scratching—no, this was calculated. Rhythmic. Like someone with long nails was carving letters into wood.

I finally gave in. Grabbed my flashlight. Went to the trapdoor.

As I opened it, the air changed. Heavy. Metallic. The kind of air that clings to your skin like blood.

The stairs creaked under my feet as I descended. Ten steps. Fifteen. The light flickered.

Then I saw it.

Chains. Hooks. Buckets full of bones.

And walls… covered in skin.

Real skin.

Stretched like wallpaper, stitched crudely, still glistening in places where it hadn’t fully dried. I don’t know how I stayed standing. I don’t know how I didn’t scream.

Then the light caught something on the far side of the room. A table.

A cold metal table… with a man on it. Or what used to be a man.

His chest was opened wide, ribs peeled apart like wings. His eyes were still blinking.

He looked at me.  
And he **smiled**.
