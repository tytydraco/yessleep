I had a weird dream last night. So terrifying and confusing. I don’t remember much about it, to be honest. But it had me awake in the middle of the night, scared to even look behind my back.

At first, I was inside a big, scary house, swallowed by darkness. It was hard to even see anything. I knew I wasn’t supposed to be there. I knew I had to get out as soon as possible — but I stayed anyway. I don’t know if there was a specific reason I couldn’t leave. I just… don’t remember. You know that weird, hollow feeling you get right after waking up, when you're trying to remember a dream but you just know there are missing parts you can’t quite grasp? Yeah.

I found a room in that house, a seemingly safe place to spend the night. Once inside, I turned the key once in the lock and heard the soft click of the door securing shut. I thought I would be safe as long as it stayed locked. Still, something deep down told me to turn the key a few more times. I shook my head and told myself to stop being paranoid — it was locked, after all.

After a while of lying awake, I realized there was no use in staying up all night. There was so much ahead, and I needed rest. I lay down on the bed and fell asleep.

That’s when it got strange.

Something woke me up. I don’t know what exactly. My subconscious stirred at a faint noise, and I felt that something was off. I started to wake slowly, my eyelids heavy and groggy with sleep. But the drowsiness vanished instantly when I saw her.

A little girl.

Don’t be fooled. She looked like a child, but something deeply wrong pulsed beneath that innocent appearance. I could feel it — the evil wrapped in that fragile shell. She was dressed like it was the 1920s. Short curly hair. Black shoes. She stared at me, surprised, like a curious puppy. I could tell she’d been watching me sleep.

Then I noticed the door. Wide open.

God. Maybe I should’ve turned the key more times.

I don’t know where I found the strength, but I stood up from the bed and pointed at her. I demanded she leave — in the name of Jesus Christ — calling out whatever she was: demon or spirit. She gasped and ran toward the exit of the room, saying “How did she manage to do that?”

I think it had something to do with the fact that I woke up and actually saw her. I'm not sure.

As soon as she was gone, I slammed the door shut and turned the key as many times as the lock allowed. I turned on the lights and started praying — begging God to help me, to banish any evil from the house. I could hear her outside, walking up the stairs, yelling something I can’t remember anymore.

I thought I was safe.

I fished my phone from my pocket and tried calling my mom. Then my dad. My brother. No one picked up.

Then — a loud thump. Right above me. It scared me shitless. I could hear her running down the stairs again, screaming, “I’m gonna catch you now!” and for a second I thought I was inside a horror movie. Like, what the hell was happening?

My whole body shook. I kept trying to call my mom while fear surged through every bone in me. She was getting closer. I could hear it. The weight of her footsteps. The hatred in her voice.

I thought I was going to die.

But before she could reach the door… I woke up.

Calm. Confused. Staring into the darkness of my real bedroom.

I wasn’t terrified then, but there was this lingering fear of looking behind me — as if I might find her there, watching me sleep just like before.

I stayed like that for a while. Wondering if I should just end the fear and look. I’m not someone who scares easily. I should look behind me — for peace of mind, right?

Now, writing this at 7:30am, I wonder if it was the right decision.

Because I didn’t look behind me.
