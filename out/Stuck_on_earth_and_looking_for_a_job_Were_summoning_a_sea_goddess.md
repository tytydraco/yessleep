If I’d had any idea that the same six ladies who had been cooking and serving me meals and beverages were secretly a coven, I… well, I probably would have kept going there anyways. We’d arranged to meet after hours together with my savior human and Elijah Carter to go down to the grotto. The witches were already waiting for us outside the unlit neon sign. They were wearing the same matching dresses that constituted their mildly out-of-date yet undoubtedly elegant diner uniforms. With them, swaying and light on his feet like a tiny golden bird, was Frankie Preston. 

I skipped up to him to give him a hug. He rolled his eyes, then wrapped his arms around me rather tightly. “Hey Sunshine. Oh. He-ey,” he added to Nettie when she came up behind us. “We’re good, right?”

“I said so, didn’t I,” she replied evenly. “I gotta stick to my word now, for better or for worse.”

“You know, I like you just fine. I was being an asshole for no reason. It’s not gonna happen again.”

“It better not,” she said, shrugging sweetly while not bothering to hide the threatening undertone in her response.

“Right,” Rhonda chimed in, looking slightly uncomfortable. “I understand you got a nixie or mermaid needs rescuing…”

“Precisely. You’re sure this is manageable for your coven?” I ventured.

“I’m not sure about anything. But I told you we’d see what we can do.” She gave me a generous smile. “You’re getting the friends-and-family-discount.” She reached over to ruffle Fran’s hair. He groaned, then moved over to me to make room for Nettie as she sidled up to the ladies.

I slid my hand into his. He grinned. “Demanding, you.”

I withdrew. “Sorry.”

“Oh, brother,” he grumbled, snatching back my hand. “Sure stand out from this crowd tonight, don’t I?” he asked jokingly, nodding at the gathering. 

“You stand out most of the time.” I perked up when Mae-Lynn pointed out another, decidedly taller figure approaching. Eli was wearing a longer coat, shielding himself from the nightly chill carried to us upon the breeze. His hands were buried in his pockets and his shoulders hunched, but a smile crossed his face nevertheless when he spotted us. "Good to see you. How've you been?"

I traded uncertain glances with Nettie, then Fran. "Busy," I concluded, answering for the three of us.

"I'm glad you came," my savior human supplied.

"I don't know if I can be of much use," he muttered, allowing her to wrap her arms around him for a moment. 

Rhonda waved him off. "Sure you can. Let's get going, now that we're all here."

Our group began to head down to the beach. Dim moonlight illuminated our path through the streets and across the sandy expanse, guiding us along with the sound of tossing waves drawing nearer. The smell of salt hung heavily above us, the wind tugged on our clothes and tousled our hair. We were a strange procession as we climbed over the rocks and down to the mouth of the cave. Had anybody seen us, I wouldn't know what they'd have made of it. I glanced over at Nettie to find her shivering. Whether it was due to the crisp spring night temperature or the excitement of the moment I couldn't tell. Instead, I reached for her hand. "Are you alright?"

She gave me a wavering nod. Flicking on her lime green flashlight, she allowed the bright beam to cut through the darkness. Her thumb rubbed over the stickers adorning the shaft of the small torch—a piece of memorabilia from our early years. "I put those there," I reminded her, pointing them out.

"Oh, I know," she deadpanned. "That was the same week I gave you all those handicraft supplies. *Never again.* You know how long it took to pry off the dozens of googly eyes you glued to the toilet seat?"

"It was artful. I thought you'd like them."

She snorted, lightly batting my shoulder. "Of course you did." Her chest heaved as she took a deep, cleansing breath. "Okay. Let's go."

Elijah and I led the way ahead, the former carrying his own heavy flashlight which he kept trained on the ground at our feet. We tried to stay as close together as possible, wary of the slippery surface we were walking on. The further we proceeded, the more anxious we became. Eli hid it masterfully, the only thing that gave away his apprehension being the vein that bulged on his forehead. I could feel his tension, though. It was in his shoulders, the stiff way he held his neck, in the force of his grip on the torch. It almost looked like he was trying to crush it.

The witches appeared to be nowhere near as impressed. They moved forward with a relaxed sort of confidence, casually stepping over puddles in their paths as though they were merely skirting around tables at the diner. Their attitude was mirrored by Frankie. I couldn’t help but glance back at him over my shoulder every couple seconds, his wheat-blond locks bouncing around his head with each of his spirited steps. Nettie Peterson, hanging from my arm, followed my gaze and let out a low grunt. “That boy is entirely too cheerful right now,” she muttered, only to squeak when she nearly tripped over a small rock. “Lord, I hope you know where we’re going.”

“Sure we do,” Elijah replied from up front. 

“Approximately,” I added.

We weaved our way through the tunnels, trying to recall the way to the corpse cave. Rhonda had told us she wanted to see Kit Sutton’s mother. In a strange way, I was looking forward to seeing the sleeping giantess again. Despite the horror she was surrounded with, her sight had left a deep impression on me. The coven was chatting to each other in the back, their hushed voices the only sound to break the otherwise clammy, uneasy silence. Until we heard *it*.

A voice carried through the darkness, sweet and bell-bright with a heated, gravelly undertone. Her song filled the washed out corridors, echoing off the rounded stone walls and riding the ripples of the lake we were currently passing by. The words were in a foreign tongue, but I would have recognized my roommate’s singing anywhere. 

Nettie tensed up, her arm around mine turning to stone. I could hear the hitch in her breath, taking note of the way her eyes grew wide in the lamplight. Our whole group had come to a halt in the middle of the large cave room, glancing about in awe as we tried to locate the source of the voice. It sounded like it was coming from everywhere at once, an omnipresent melancholy with just the hint of a fury in it. Like a calm, slow river with a strong, rapid undercurrent. I listened in rapture, my gaze fixed on my savior human’s elegant profile. Her lower lip trembled ever so slightly, its gloss capturing the warm sheen.

"Kit!" she suddenly called out. 

The song broke off, leaving only eerie silence.

"Are you there?" my best friend shouted again, her voice nearly breaking. 

Everything was still for another beat. Then we heard stones shift and clatter, followed by naked feet slapping the wet ground. We turned around, and there, standing beneath the arch of one of the side tunnels, was Kit Sutton. Nettie let out a sharp cry, broke free from my hold and ran towards her, wrapping her arms around the taller woman's neck. Kit stared down at her in shock before throwing her arms around her, burying one hand in her long, dark coils of hair and pressing the other to the small of her back. Anabel, who works the kitchen at the diner, let out a soft coo. We stayed back for the two of them to have their moment before my savior human eventually disentangled herself. 

"You're very wet," she told Kit, inspecting her now damp sweater.

My roommate's lips curled. "I mean, you hugged me pretty close, so…"

Nettie smacked her upper arm. "Idiot," she whispered, her tone warm and gentle. 

The smile faded from Kit's face as her eyes roamed the small crowd, settling on me. "What are you doing here? I told you not to come back, and now you've actually brought *more* people?"

"Kit, this is the coven from the diner. Coven, this is the water spirit I told you about." I turned to Rhonda, who nodded and took a step forward.

"We came to see if we can't do something about your situation," she told her. 

Kit scrunched her brows. "You guys are a coven?"

"They are," I supplied. "And they managed to hold off my stalker with their magic so they're pretty serious about it. That reminds me; I have a stalker now. Anyways, they want to see your mom."

My roommate looked beyond skeptical. "You know this is dangerous, right?"

Hailey groaned. "Girl, we've been in this for a long-ass time. Either you let us see what we can do or you don't, but don't think for a moment that we're ignorant."

Kit threw up her arms. "Fine. Come along then. I warned you."

She started marching ahead, her impossibly long hair trailing behind her like a veil. Nettie had to be careful not to step on it as she walked alongside her, the two having linked hands. When we reached the corpse room, my savior human looked like she was about to faint. The sight once again sent a cold chill down my spine and I instinctively looked over at Eli Carter. His face was scrunched up, his brows knitted as he attempted to keep his eyes trained on the ground. Frankie on the other hand appeared to be rather interested, his gaze roaming the hall. The coven didn’t seem to care whatsoever, instead following Kit to the water hole where the enormous statuesque creature was resting. 

“Woah,” Nettie said eloquently as she leaned over to look into the depths of the pond. “That’s your mom?”

Kit Sutton gave a brief, unspirited nod. “She is, actually. Quite a bit bigger than me but yeah. Well, I don’t see how this is—” She fell silent when the six ladies started to round the pit, exchanging knowing glances as they reached for each others’ hands. “What? What now, what are we doing?” she stammered, taking a step back and slightly raising her barnacle-covered arms. 

Hailey turned to her with an encouraging smile. “We could wake her up. I really think we could.”

For a moment, she didn’t respond. “You think that’d help?” she then asked.

“Would it help to have a giant sea goddess up against your father?” Rhonda deadpanned. “Of course it would. He clearly had a problem with her, else he wouldn’t have done that. He felt threatened, most likely. You might not be able to fight back against him yourself, but she ought to tip the scales.”

“Great idea,” Frankie said, earning a proud nod from the older waitress. “It’s a good rule of thumb. If you’re too weak, you just find someone strong and scary to hide behind.” He beamed at me. “You’re so pretty, Eva.”

Kit snorted, looking a little more at ease but still uncertain. “You guys know I’ve actually never spoken with her, right? What if she’s, like, feral? Maybe she won’t want to help me; she could just make things worse.”

“Worse?” Nettie Peterson blurted out. “Girl, you’re grounded for a hundred years! It doesn’t get much worse than that.”

“Good point.”

“Glad we agree,” Mae-Lynn crisply chimed in. “Okay now, everyone join hands, go on.” She reached out for us and we gathered around the pool. Nettie entwined her fingers with mine on my left while Aliyah, the oldest of the witches from the looks of it, took her place on my right. She told Frankie to stay out of the circle, giving him an apologetic smile as she sent him off to wait on the side. “Sorry, sweetie,” she told him over her shoulder. “But having an inorganic link might disturb the chain.”

“So what now?” Elijah asked.

“All of you just close your eyes and clear your minds. Don’t think of anything, like you’re meditating. You’ve got to stay calm. I’m gonna borrow what I energy I can from your minds and use it for the big girl,” Rhonda told us, pointing her chin at the motionless giantess in the water down below. “Now, what Blue here says is true, so if this works, we’ll just all *bolt*, okay? We wake up the water queen and then we leg it.” She nodded to Kit. “You have the best chances at dealing with her on your own. I’m optimistic overall but she’s been locked inside her own body for God knows how long. She’s likely to be confused and we don’t want to make her feel ganged up on.”

“That actually makes sense,” my roommate conceded, brightening up a bit.

“Everybody ready?” Rhonda asked, receiving scattered nods and mumbles of affirmation. Bracing herself, she rolled her shoulders and proceeded to raise her voice, beginning to murmur something I could not understand. It sounded like a human language, but not any one that I knew. My heart was beginning to beat a little faster, her rhythmic cadence reminding me of the beating of a drum. I couldn't help it. I took a peek at Rhonda, my stomach sinking when I saw her face.

Her eyes were wide open and had rolled back into her head, leaving only the white to fill the eerie, void spaces. Her body was trembling as if there were invisible hands shaking her by the shoulders. The veins and arteries on her face and neck were standing out, weirdly discolored. The longer I looked at them, the darker they became until eventually turning black entirely. They were pulsating, the blood pumping through them at a powerful, forcible pace. 

I pressed my eyes shut once more, trying to clear my mind despite the image sticking with me. *Focus on nothing, focus on nothing…*

It turned out to be quite difficult. I've never tried to actively empty my head before, not like this. Something always kept popping in, disturbing the peace up there. Unwanted thoughts of Jewel's tears, the Devourer Of Worlds, my intestines quelling from my stomach pushed their way into the void I was trying desperately to create. When it wasn't that, it was the image of Frankie's beautifully coordinated movements. I briefly allowed my eyes to flutter open once again to turn and sneak a glance at the waiter. He was sitting cross-legged on the rocky ground, busy tossing pebbles at the slimed-up corpses to see if they stuck. Forcing myself to concentrate, I tried to picture what "nothing" would even look like. 

Probably all black. Light had to be absent after all. Endless; no ceiling, no floor, nothing to stand on and nothing overhead. Nothing to hear, see, smell or feel. Nothing at all; nowhere.

Around me, I felt the air in the room beginning to heat. The grating of stone upon stone penetrated my ears in the most uncomfortable way, but this time, I was determined not to muck it up. My facial muscles straining as I clenched my lids and mouth shut, I tried to ignore the sound of water beginning to bubble nearby. The pond was hissing as if it were a pot of boiling soup, splashes and dripping noises overtaking the silence. Rhonda's voice rose higher and higher, bouncing off the hollowed cavern walls and coming back with three times the volume. Goosebumps threatened to break out on my arms, the hairs on the back of my neck already standing up. I had lost my sense of space—I had no idea who was standing beside me anymore, I could barely feel their hands in mine; their touch was a foreign sensation I was only distantly aware of. 

There truly was nothing there. Nothing but Rhonda's chanting. It filled every nook and cranny of my mind, coming from everywhere around me. My pulse was fluttering as if dancing to its rhythm. My heart was pounding like a drum to the best of its cadence. A faint sense of panic was whispering to me at the edge of my conscience, but it was unable to perturb the *nothing*. There was a veil before my inner eye that could not be lifted anymore.

And then, all of a sudden, one of the hands I was holding was wrenched from my grasp as a scream interrupted the incantative chorus. "Run!" Rhonda cried out. 

My eyes flew open, instantly coming to rest on the pond. The water's surface was bulging, looking like a stretched out balloon about to burst. It formed a strained, blue dome, as from beneath it, two enormous hands rose to break its ceiling. 

"She's coming!" Kit yelled out, her face a contorted grimace of hope and horror. "Get out of here! Hurry!" Shoving Nettie and Eli towards the exit, she rallied our group.

Frankie had jumped up and snatched my hand, already dragging me into the direction of the corridor. I craned my neck to look behind me, only for him to pull harder. "This room is gonna be flooded in, like, a moment! You wanna drown?" my waiter shouted, largely into my ear. I was still a bit dazed, the mental fog from the ritual not yet having let up. I really didn't have the time to come to, though. The ground was shaken by a sudden, massive earthquake. The walls began to shudder, drops of water raining down on us from all sides along with tiny pebbles coming loose from up above. 

"Get out of here!" Kit bellowed, her voice so loud it came close to cracking. 

Rhonda and the rest of her coven were already crowding the mouth of the cave room, racing out into the tunnel single file. I, Frankie and Elijah followed on their heels, the latter ducking his head as he slipped through the opening. Nettie kept looking back over her shoulder. I yelled her name at the same time as Kit shouted at her to leave. Eli Carter was already fumbling with his flashlight and grabbed her wrist with his other hand to drag her into the corridor with us. "You need to—"

"I know," she interrupted him, tearing herself loose and breaking into a sprint. 

And thus, we ran. Somehow, it was a lot easier to find the way back than I'd expected. Before I even had the time to process the twists and turns in our path, we were already standing outside the cave again. The stale air from inside was replaced with the fresh smell of salt and the roaring of restless waves. My heart was pounding like a sledgehammer, my blood singing in my veins. 

"We can't stay here," Eli hollered as he emerged behind us. "When that thing stands up, the whole cave is gonna break in! Move!"

Nettie Peterson let out a high-pitched whine but readily hurried along as the ten of us scrambled up the sand and boulders, away from the grotto and the shore. We finally came to a halt a safe distance away on one of the cliffs, overlooking the scene. For a moment, the only sound disrupting the nightly symphony was our joint heavy breathing. 

Then the sound of massive rocks shifting and cracking reached our ears. From the grotto, a vibration spread through the ground all the way over to where we were standing. The mouth of the cave began to crumble, bits of stone falling down and sealing the opening. Then the whole cave began to split. My savior human grabbed onto my arm, her fingernails digging into my skin. "She'll be okay, right?"

"For sure," I said, ignoring my pulse thrumming in my ears.

Time to call Mary Markov again.
