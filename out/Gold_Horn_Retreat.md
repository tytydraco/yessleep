“Gold Horn Retreat: You are home”

The simple tagline that I had read on the retreats website repeated itself on a well kept wooden sign. The gate behind it lifted, and the thick lining of trees that surrounded either side of the road finally broke and opened up into a sparse collection of large lodges, a good distance from each other with tire tracks leading towards the central building. The central building, where I presumed I would meet my new employers, was large and out of place. Founded on a bed of cement, it towered over the housing of the retreat. Nearly pressing my face against the bus window, I counted twenty stories. Far too many for what they were going for here. The bus pulled up to the front of the building, and shortly after me and my new coworkers were ushered off the bus, and instructed to take our luggage from the undercarriage of our transport.

Gold Horn Retreat had posted a listing for line cook a month ago, and after a set of quick and easy interviews, I was bound for a seasonal position in this secluded area. I got the impression that they were short on staff, and desperate to fill the various positions that littered the job boards before summer. Luckily for them, I was just as desperate as them and willing enough to take anything that would get me out of town for a while. I lived alone in New York before this. Dark alleys and blending into crowds  were my home, not Gold Horn Lodge. I’m not a good person. I didn’t belong here and I knew it. I made my money by selling drugs and stealing cars. My funds were low, and I knew I was just one misfortune away from missing rent. The pay was good, and it was a chance to make an honest living, and something to add to my sparse resume so why not right? Plus, I heard that one of my regulars was looking to jump me after I apparently sold him some “Fake shit.” 

“Look at this place, it’s amazing!” The older woman who sat next to me exclaimed to me, a smile wide on her face. Everybody made a point of keeping to themselves but Catherine, who sat next to me on the bus.

Catherine did her best to make conversation with me throughout the ride up, not taking the hint that my polite smile and brief responses to her attempts were a sign that I wasn’t up for conversation. Still, she didn’t let up. I would’ve been annoyed, but her overwhelming positivity and the earnestness in her voice kept me from ruminating, so I was glad for it. Catherine, in turn, didn’t seem to mind that I didn’t contribute nearly as much as her to the conversation as she told me about her adult children who never visit, her ex-husband who was apparently a bastard, and how excited she was to get away. She even called me a good listener at one point. She seemed kind, but lonely, and I promised myself that I would make more of an effort throughout the few months we would be here.

“It really is.” I responded, and meant it. Those same trees that narrowed our view on the ride now circled the retreat neatly, making the twenty acre property feel even more isolated than the fact that it was an unknown distance from any sort of civilization already made it. We were told that the retreat was incredibly private, and that we would not know its location at any point during our time working there. Not the best sign, but again, I was desperate. 

“Well, come on then.” Catherine said and smiled at me. I followed her, and the rest of the group, inside.

The interior was grand and rich. I knew that most of the annual patrons weere far more well off than the average person, but I didn’t expect an interior that could have matched any Four Seasons. Orientation was quick, but organized. We each received a personal itinerary, given keys to our own rooms within the central building, and told to get settled. I was expecting a small room with just the essentials, but was shocked to find that the rooms for us matched the lobby. If the staff was provided king sized beds lined with silk and a stocked mini fridge which a small note left on the desk assured us was free, then I wondered how impressive the actual lodges were.

I spent the night studying the menu and looking up at the crackless ceiling as I drifted off to sleep early in the night, thanking whatever guiding force in the universe deemed me deserving of such luxury when everything else in my life was going to shit. For three months, I could disentangle my brain from worries, and make good money while doing so. I dreamt of open fields and clean air for the first time in my life.

The next day, I couldn’t find Catherine. I looked for the man who was in charge of our orientation.

“Excuse me?” I asked timidly, not wanting to be a standout but also uneasy without my new friend present. “I think someone’s missing. A woman named Catherine.” The man looked at me, made no facial expressions, then glanced down at his clipboard. He flitted through several pages before looking back up at me.”

“No Catherine on the list. Maybe you misheard her name?” He looked towards the crowd of new workers, counted them, then checked his clipboard again. “By my count, everyones here. It’s a new environment, maybe you just got confused. No one would blame you, Gold Horn Lodge makes quite an impression on people.” He smiled for the first time during the conversation.

“Right… maybe.” I replied, unsure. Did I fall asleep on the bus and dream up a conversation that never happened? Either way, there wasn’t much I could do. Maybe she left the same night on that same bus, and the man’s list was updated to reflect that.  I decided that it was none of my business whether Catherine existed or not, and pushed her out of my mind. I had a station to learn and money to make.

I didn’t have any professional experience as a line cook, so they had me on prep work, cutting vegetables, herbs, and whatever else they needed for the day. During our break after lunch, I made myself a sandwich for lunch and decided to eat outside. I expected to find families walking around the retreat, but the space outside was eerily barren. No cars, no people. Just the odd staff member walking in and out of the central building with silver platters housing either meals on the way out or covered empty plates on the way back. 

“Our clients are very private.” The same man I had asked about Catherine before explained. “They come from high stress careers and lives and just want time for themselves. I’m sure you’ll see some soon enough.” In the week that followed, I didn’t. I hadn’t been paying too much attention to the others, so I couldn’t be sure, but it felt like every other day, there was one fewer amongst us that were taken here on the bus. The day after someone would replace them, a face I was sure I’d never seen, but couldn’t be sure because again, I still didn’t bother to actually get to know anyone here.

One night, I decided to take a walk. I circled the treeline, doing my best to avoid any other staff members. I was just about to reach the end of my path when I saw that one of the lodges had their lights on, something I had never seen before. It was around midnight, so I had to be asleep soon, but I figured that a small peek inside from the windows couldn’t hurt. Not a smart idea, I know but no one was around at the moment to see me, so I let my curiosity get the better of me. 

I’m glad I did. 

I couldn’t see much except from a small peak from a misaligned curtain. Ahead on a table was a silver platter, one that I assumed must have been missed from before, except there was still food on it. A New York strip steak with a loaded baked potato and asparagus. The food must have been freezing by now. I heard a crash.

I turned my head to look towards the side of the room the crash came from, where I saw a man tied a chair, a red ball gag in his mouth. At first I assumed I was looking at something private, but then realized that the man tied to the chair was one of our own. I only recognized him because he had had a loud argument with the man who organized us that same day. Something about wanting to go home because the stress wasn’t worth it. He was on the meat station, which was always busy, so I figured he just couldn’t hack it and would be sent home. But there he was. Someone I couldn’t see lifted his chair back upright. He had fear in his wide eyes. Slowly, he was surrounded by hooded figures. One after another they bit into his neck, arms, chest, legs and tore flesh away by the mouthful.

I covered my mouth so as not to scream. As the figures backed away from the tied up man, half of him was missing in un-uniformed chunks of pink flesh and white bone. I backed away, and ran towards the central building. I needed a way out. The surreal, horrifying scene forced a feeling of disorientation in my mind that left me weak, but the one thought penetrated through was the understanding that I had to leave. Now. I found the bus and thanked God that a life of dishonest living gave me the skills to hot-wire a bus. As the engine roared, those same figures through their lodges door open as light spilled from the doorway. They bound towards me. I decided to bound towards them in turn. 

I hit one. The others scattered. 

The impact slowed me as I began to turn towards the gate, and slammed my foot on the accelerator. I didn’t look back. Hands pounded on glass near me, then further towards the back the faster I drove. I crashed the gate, and drove. I kept just driving. My brain was numb. I didn't believe what had just happened, but the memories were still fresh and undeniable. I wasn’t aware of anything except for the road.  

It wasn’t until I found some small town nearby that I ditched the bus by the roadside, and walked the rest of the way. I used the rest of my money to catch a greyhound. My overloaded brain remained numb the rest of the way.

I was home. My real home, in Michigan, with my parents. I never told them a word of what happened, but not a night passes that I don’t remember or dream of Gold Horn Retreat. I dream about the bus ride over with Catherine when I’m lucky, the exciting but foreboding feeling of exiting my comfort zone, the unknown, and I dream about the ravaged man in the lodge when I’m unlucky. Those nights I dream of muffled screams and sinew.

I’m looking for local work now. I’m writing this not only to get this off my chest, but also to warn others. If you come across a posting for a job with housing provided, make sure you vet the place, no matter how desperate you are. I tried to find any trace of Gold Horn Retreat, but it’s been effectively erased from the internet. We all met in Wisconsin, but the ride was long, and there's no way for me to realistically provide any evidence for what had happened. Maybe they re-branded. I expect they have the resources to disappear and reappear at will.

If you’re desperate for work, and if you find any job posting claiming to be your new home, take my advice and ignore it. If you find something too good to be true, it probably is. You will not be home, no matter how consumed you are with the opportunity.
