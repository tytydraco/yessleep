I knew we were on the brink of a monumental discovery the moment I was invited to Athens to join the Nenata Research Collective. Before me, five researchers had begun the painstaking work of translating 3,030 obsidian tablets. They were all part of a single corpus, all written approximately 6,000 years ago. It didn't take long for them to realise that the scope of what they were translating was far grander than anybody could have imagined, so the original team of three Classicists and two linguists quickly expanded into a group of seventeen scientists, drawing in experts from every corner of ancient history and the sciences. I joined as the palaeoclimatologist, studying prehistoric climates.

I suspected from the start that these tablets were something special. Ancient humans simply did not write on obsidian. Not only is it a nearly impossible material to work with — so hard it requires quartz or diamond to etch, yet so brittle a mere drop could shatter it — but the sheer scale of the corpus defied all precedent. We ran obsidian hydration dating no fewer than five times to be certain, and the results were undeniable: the tablets were inscribed between 4,300 and 3,800 BCE. For comparison, the earliest known Sumerian cuneiform is dated to around 3,200 BCE. Already, it was becoming clear we were facing what may well be the most significant discovery in human history. And the contents of these texts, collectively called the Book of Nenata, have only confirmed it.

I should stop rambling, though. With the unanimous consent of the Nenata Research Collective, I am here to share with the world what we have learned. At this stage, we know what will happen once our translations are published. World governments, corporations, and intelligence organisations will try their best to suppress the findings and warnings of the Children of Nenata. There is a warning repeated multiple times within these obsidian tablets that is intended for us. What we have learnt bodes dire consequences for the human race unless we change our ways. And so we must share this message.

You, too, would understand if you only opened your mind to the Breath. I promise it will make more sense soon. The pieces of knowledge I share will all come together at the end. But for you to understand the Breath and the warning given to us, you must first understand what the Book of Nenata truly is.

——————————————————————————————————————————————

It all began when construction workers on the outskirts of Athens uncovered an ancient well, long sealed and buried beneath a mountain of earth. In accordance with protocol, the City of Athens's Ephorate of Antiquities was immediately notified, and construction work was halted. Archaeologists arrived on site and, after excavating the well, uncovered a passageway sealed with lead. Beyond was an ancient chamber filled with stone chests, each containing one hundred obsidian tablets. They were all inscribed with a script unlike anything seen before.

The real breakthrough came when another chest was discovered. This one held tablets written in both the unknown script and the Linear B syllabics of Mycenaean Greece. Though also carved into obsidian, these particular tablets were much newer, dating to around 1,500 BCE. To their astonishment, the chest contained what could only be described as a dictionary: thousands of words and even grammatical concepts carefully translated between the two languages. The find sent ripples of excitement through the academic community. For the Classicists and linguists, this was by far the most sophisticated use of Linear B ever uncovered.

It was at this point that the original team of five researchers was brought in. While they were unable to identify the older language outright, the dictionary gave them the tools to begin translating the tablets. Each fragment bore the words "Book of Nenata" at the top, followed by a sequential number, like a primitive Dewey Decimal classification. The name stuck.

And so the five researchers were tasked with translating some of the tablets, to see what information they contained. Unsure where to begin, they selected a fragment at random, and set to work.

——————————————————————————————————————————————

From the very beginning, the contents of the Nenatan corpus enthralled the researchers. At this time, they believed the tablets to be nothing more than ancient stories preserved on obsidian. They also learnt that throughout the five centuries it took to compile the Book of Nenata, there were ten chroniclers, never more than one at a time, each carrying the task of recording their world.

One of the first fragments they translated told of a prophetess named Selur of Thamar, who invented writing by carving words into obsidian with her bare hands. Other fragments described seven secretive waterfalls where one could drink "selen", the nepenthe of the mountains. The chroniclers wrote of a man who walked among the stars, and of a queen who saved her kingdom by condemning to death all those who dared speak a lie.

The researchers kept translating. As they continued, a sense of awe began to settle over the team. The level of geographic knowledge contained within the Book of Nenata was unlike anything they expected from a people living 6,000 years ago. According to our best modern understanding, humans of that era were sparsely distributed, existing largely in isolation from one another. And yet the Book spoke of no fewer than fifteen distinct civilisations spread across the Old World, all engaged in vibrant trade networks and existing together in peace.

For instance, the Seledine of the High Cliffs were said to dwell in the mountain valleys in a vast range to the west of the Children of Nenata. This could not be anything other than the Alps. The Kaedurath of the Green Hills lived in a cool mountain climate beyond a vast desert, which can only be either the Ethiopian Highlands, or the Sarawat range of Yemen. And the Fire-Walkers were a people of the eastern highlands, likely situated in Anatolia or the rugged terrain of present-day Iran and Afghanistan. One of the more distant cultures mentioned were the People of the Sticky Grain, whose homeland, by every indication, lay within what is now China.

But most astonishing of all were references to the People of the Obsidian Loom — an advanced civilisation said to have thrived in the verdant mountains of what is now a vast desert to the south. By the time of the Book of Nenata, the civilisation had already ceased to exist. This account aligns with the end of the African Humid Period, when the Sahara, once a fertile grassland, began to dry around 4,500 BCE. The People of the Obsidian Loom, it is said, calmly emigrated from their homeland, their descendants dispersing and integrating into distant societies. It is likely they lived in the Tibesti Mountains of modern Chad.

What interested the researchers even more, though, was that it seemed all these different civilisations had the same belief system...they all believed in something called the Breath. A multifaceted concept, it was usually described as a life force animating the vessels that humans inhabit. At times, however, it was also portrayed as the natural ordering principle that connects all living beings and even inanimate matter. Rarely, it even appeared as a conscious deity, capable of communicating with people. The aforementioned prophetess, Selur of Thamar, supposedly invented writing after communicating with the Breath.

The Linear B translation we had with us rendered the Breath as pneuma, a Greek word that, in its religious sense, calls to mind the Chinese qi, the Sanskrit prana, and the Ancient Egyptian concept of sekhem. In this way, the Breath became the most enigmatic yet unifying concept in the entire Nenatan corpus.

After this point, it became clear that the original team of Classicists and linguists was nowhere near enough. This was not a collection of fables and legends; it was an entire encyclopedia. Fragments described ancient trade networks, agricultural practices, medicinal knowledge, and more, necessitating the involvement of economic historians, palaeobotanists, and zooarchaeologists.  This is when I was invited to join, tasked with reconstructing the climate systems that shaped the world at the time the Book of Nenata was being compiled. As one of the leading palaeoclimatologists in the world, it was an honour to be part of the Nenata Research Collective. Just as I said, I knew we would discover something that would forever alter the way we view our history.

——————————————————————————————————————————————

Two days after my arrival and debriefing, we began translating the fragments in their sequential order. The Nenatan version of the Dewey Decimal System, as we jokingly called it, numbered the fragments neatly: 1.01 through 1.100, 2.01 through 2.100, and so on. The final fragment, however, was numbered 30.30. The original five researchers had already translated its title and noted that, despite being the last in sequence, it appeared to serve as an introduction to the entire Book, so we began there.

It's important you understand that what you are about to read was written nearly 5,800 years ago. This is what the Book of Nenata is about. This is the fruit of our efforts:

**Fragment 30.30**

*If these words have found your eyes, then rejoice, for you hold in your hands the first weaving of all knowledge that ever walked upon clay and stone. I, Saphreth of the Nenata, have spent my life gathering the wisdom of countless generations to pour it into this vessel of obsidian. Here lies the fruit of ages: a record of the Long Dawn, a mirror of the forgotten peoples, and a lamp for those who yet breathe in the fading days.*

*In this tome is preserved the totality of our remembrance: the songs of the winds that first caressed man's cheek; the parables whispered by rivers long since swallowed by salt; the charts of the sky as it danced in forgotten patterns; and the laws of Breath, which hold man in harmony. All that was, all that is, and all that shall yet stir in the loom of the unseen are written herein; not as fancy, but as truth drawn from the lips of the wise and the hearts of prophets.*

*Know, O wanderer in the dust of centuries, that you and your kin are but shadows of what man once was. Where now you measure life in fleeting decades, once we counted lifespans by centuries. In those days, the marrow of men burned strong, and their vessels endured the weight of centuries without bowing. Now you come to the world brittle of bone and shallow of breath, your hearts unmoored. Yet despair not! For within these pages lie the remedies for forgetting.*

*Upon receiving wise counsel from Nenata, she proclaimed to me: "Write, Saphreth, for though the eyes of your age are growing blind, a day shall come when eyes long shut will open. They will find these words in the deep, and though they laugh at first, the Breath will stir again in their chests, and the weaving shall begin anew."*

*Therefore, though I know this Chronicle shall lie buried in dust and stone, I write without sorrow. All unfolds as it must.*

*Know, then, O seeker beyond the Long Dawn, that this Chronicle was centuries in the making. Ten chroniclers bore its burden: scribes, weavers, singers, and elders now gone from this realm. I, Saphreth, am but the last chisel upon the obsidian stone. My vessel grows frail; my flame burns low, yet I rejoice. To have lived to complete this work is my greatest joy.*

When we finished translating that first tablet, a quiet fell over the room. We were still jubilant, still eager to continue, but seeing that accurate prediction on how the Book would be rediscovered, as obvious as it may have seemed, carried with it a strange weight. It felt as though we were all meant to be there, assembled for some greater purpose. And who, or what, was Nenata? We would learn in the weeks to come.

The stories that followed were among the richest and most intricate I have ever encountered. It is difficult even now not to digress into tangents about everything we uncovered. No one went to sleep plagued by strange dreams or visions, but we found ourselves working late into the night and beginning again early each morning, compelled by nothing more than our own excitement. As a palaeoclimatologist, I was especially enthralled by the detailed accounts of the climate. For the first time in human history, we had direct testimony of environmental conditions reaching as far back as about 4,500 BCE. It was a revelation that would forever change my field.

——————————————————————————————————————————————

After two months, we had progressed as far as Fragment 9.45, occasionally skipping over certain groups of fragments that seemed less interesting. We agreed we would return to them later. Whether it was a conscious decision or not, by some unspoken consensus we were all searching for fragments that would reveal more insight into the Breath.

I expected my scepticism to grow over time. I expected there would come a moment when we encountered a claim so fantastical, so absurd, that it would shatter the illusion and confirm the Book of Nenata as nothing more than the embellished mythology of a long-forgotten civilisation. Sometimes texts seemed to deliver on this expectation. We read of the Glass Cities of Velthira, glittering in the desert, and the obsidian-hulled ships of the Thallenari seafarers, both feats that should be impossible even now.

But that moment of disbelief never came. For we also encountered passages on the importance of washing one's hands before handling newborn children; detailed instructions for constructing pyramids and ziggurats using techniques so advanced that even in Mycenaean Greek they resisted easy translation. These fragments proved among the most technically difficult for us to translate, and we unanimously agreed that it must explain how the Ancient Egyptians built their pyramids. The more we read, the more impressed we became with how comprehensive this encyclopaedia was; there were even the words to hymns not sung in millennia.

Although, different fragments did spark fierce debate within the Nenata Research Collective; Fragment 8.78 detailed the account of an ancient man who claimed the Breath had lifted him beyond the skies, into a realm of darkness where stars surrounded him. From there, he observed what the Greeks would call "the wanderers of the sun," or planets. He claimed he saw a fifth one, large and stormy, with rings of dust and stone surrounding it.

I argued passionately that it had to be factual, however supernatural it seemed. How could a pre-modern observer describe the rings of Saturn? They're invisible to the naked eye! I was backed by some of my colleagues, but others countered that it must have a more logical explanation. Perhaps it was a visionary dream, a poetic metaphor for spiritual ascent, or even a distorted memory of a solar eclipse.

I became certain that there was some truth in the more fantastic claims of the Book of Nenata when we began working through the fragments concerning the Sunken City of Athra-Midon. I will provide an excerpt from Fragment 1.03, written by Anthar, the first chronicler. You will soon see how it is connected:

*The Long Dawn was an age of slow ripening. Bones did not bow beneath the weight of time, and teeth remained sharp even as the fifth generation of a man’s children danced at his feet. Women bore sons at the hundredth summer, and even then their hair was as dark as the obsidian stone which I write on. Men spoke then of elders who remembered the rising of great ice, and others who had seen the ice retreat. In those days, the Breath within men burned brighter and endured longer, for it was untroubled by the poisons that now gnaw at flesh and marrow.*

This passage intrigued us beyond any other. It spoke of lives that stretched across centuries, where humans were smarter and healthier. The parallels were striking: the same motif echoes through Abrahamic scripture, Sumerian mythology, and Indian cosmology, all speaking of a time when humans lived longer lives and were closer, somehow, to the divine. The historians buzzed with excitement. Could this ancient belief system be the source of all world myths, like the hundreds of flood stories?

At the same time, we kept reading tablets that told of Athra-Midon:

**Fragment 1.87:** *The greatest of cities was Athra-Midon, whose gates of gold faced eastward to the morning star. This city fell to the swelling of the waters, when the deep burst its bonds and devoured a thousand valleys.*

**Fragment 2.12:** *O Athra-Midon! If I close my eyes, I see you still. Your streets like rivers of light, your arches like the arms of repentance. Your temple's mist clinging to my hair as my Breath drinks deeply. Yet I open my eyes, and I see only ruin and silence.* (This is a poem by Leluth of Aram, who will be mentioned again later.)

**Fragment 6.61:** *Athra-Midon sank first, her pearl towers still glimmering as they fell beneath the waves. Villages in the Lush Coast say the cries of her people echoed in the hollow deep for seven generations.*

Eventually, we came to Fragments 9.45 and 9.46, the most detailed accounts we have of what happened to this sunken city. The story of Athra-Midon goes like this:

Founded during the Long Dawn in what was once a river delta, man raised a city of splendour. Its towers of pearl and emerald caught the light of the sun, casting rippling colours across canals. Athra-Midon became a place where knowledge and trade converged. Travellers from every known civilisation made their way to its gates; in an age when lifespans stretched into centuries, journeys that spanned decades were no obstacle. Athra-Midon was not only a centre of commerce, where goods from across the world were exchanged, but also a sanctuary of wisdom, for at its heart stood the Library of Memory. If we believe the Book of Nenata, the first "library" was not a collection of written texts. It was a sacred temple complex where Reciters, each devoted to a specific discipline, could be approached to share the vast reservoirs of knowledge they held in their mind. With lifespans of three, five, or even seven centuries, they could commit thousands of stories, histories, and discoveries to memory.

We were in awe as we read these passages. Suspend your own disbelief for a moment and imagine: if humans lived for centuries, what depths of understanding might we achieve? How much oral tradition, how many innovations, could be passed directly from one generation to the next? All of it, compiled in a single international city that welcomed every major civilisation at its gates. The Library of Memory was, every chronicler claimed, the greatest repository of human knowledge that ever existed. If real, I agree — the Internet, with its forced advertisements and misinformation, could not come close.

Athra-Midon also contained the Temple of the Moist Breath, a structure of black stone in a city otherwise dazzling with light. Inside, "selen-root" burnt as pilgrims washed their hands in water and circled a crystal said to hum with the Breath. The chroniclers noted that it sang differently for each person who approached. But then came a boisterous noble who desecrated the temple. He questioned what good is life without revelry, and began a tradition of blood sports in the once hallowed halls of the Temple. Brothers who lived for centuries together fought each other for amusement, their bodies strong enough to heal from even the worst wounds. Athra-Midon descended into chaos. Foreign envoys recoiled in disgust, confining themselves to the markets or the Library, which still endured. Even as the city rotted around it, its Reciters remained steadfast, preserving what they could.

In the end, the consequences for forgetting the Breath and living in a corrupted state came. A deluge arrived, sudden and unbidden, "like a Bridegroom in the night." When the waters receded, only a few hundred, perhaps a thousand at most, had survived, carried away on prepared vessels. Warnings had been given, but too few heeded them. Thus remained the memory of the Sunken City of Athra-Midon. After this, lifespans decreased to what they are today, though everybody alive at the time still lived long lives.

As a palaeoclimatologist, my mind leapt instantly to one thing and one thing only; the Black Sea flood hypothesis. This hypothesis suggests that rising sea levels at the end of the last Ice Age caused the Mediterranean to breach the Bosphorus, catastrophically flooding what had once been a vast freshwater lake. Fertile coastlines and settlements disappeared beneath the waves, creating legends of great deluges that lingered for millennia.

Taking an earlier fragment into account, the sinking of Athra-Midon would have occurred around 6,500 BCE, which is roughly the latest proposed date for what we now call the Black Sea flood. Could this be proof that this flood was real? Not only that, but could it also explain away three ancient legends with one obsidian stone? The sinking of Atlantis, an advanced city. The so-called Abrahamic antediluvian period/Hindu Dvapara Yuga era, when humans supposedly lived impossibly long lives. And Noah's Ark, the great flood of Abrahamic tradition where only a select few escaped on his vessel.

By this point in our work, even the staunchest sceptics among us found their doubts eroding. The Book of Nenata was simply too detailed to dismiss as mere fiction. Of course, certain aspects, like centuries-long lifespans, could perhaps be exaggerations or misinterpretations. But having a reason given for those long lives made it feel somehow more real to me. The Book of Nenata claims humans wasted their extended years in a corrupted state by participating in blood sports and basking in idleness. The chroniclers also wrote that, with centuries to live, a person would hardly think twice about spending decades journeying to distant lands. And one would be able to commit to memory far more things with such a long lifespan, especially as it seems old age affected people less even when it did come.

Regardless of my thoughts, every chronicler lamented the loss of the Library of Memory. They called it the single greatest loss of knowledge in all of human history. Gone were thousands of effective medical treatments, architectural techniques for building wonders we cannot replicate, and most importantly, countless methods for connecting to the Breath.

A handful of Reciters survived because they had not been in Athra-Midon when the deluge struck. Some chose to pass on what they remembered, sharing fragments of their knowledge in the hope it might endure. But most took the disaster as a sign from the Breath that such wisdom was not meant to survive. They wandered the earth until, one by one, their still-long lives came to an end.

——————————————————————————————————————————————

The final piece of context you need to grasp the warnings of the Book of Nenata is the knowledge of the seers, of whom Nenata was one.

Despite its name and the fact it was written by the Children of Nenata, actual references to Nenata herself in the Book of Nenata were surprisingly scarce. They usually came as fleeting mentions noting that she had provided counsel, or that she had divulged the knowledge the chronicler is writing down. Yet every chronicler, from Anthar the first to Saphreth the tenth, spoke of her. For a time, we assumed "Nenata" was a title, passed down through generations. Fragment 9.57 shattered that assumption...or rather, it complicated it:

*Nenata is not one woman but many; she dwells always in the form of an elder. When her vessel grows thin, her Breath passes as smoke between reeds into another of her choosing. Thus she lives again and again, her memories braided into the loom of every vessel she inhabits. She walks freely between the Breath and the clay, and from her lips we have gathered much of what fills these pages.*

A sort of reincarnation, for sure, but not remotely similar to the kind mentioned in Buddhism or any other known belief system. It also seemed to apply only to Nenata and not to other humans (there was one exception, who I will mention soon).

The tablet went on to explain that each vessel of Nenata rarely survived beyond a decade. Upon her passing, a new elder would wander into a village and declare herself as Nenata. This woman was always unknown to the world before her sudden appearance. The Children of Nenata had even established a system for verifying her authenticity, though the details of this system were frustratingly vague.

Most interestingly, it described how Nenata would inhale noxious vapours from a pit deep within a cave, granting her visions of "some of what was, most of what is, and a bit of what will be." The Classicists among us immediately drew parallels to Pythia, the Oracle of Delphi, who, according to ancient Greek tradition, sat upon a tripod and inhaled vapours that allowed her to commune with the divine. It was a fascinating connection, but by the time of Classical Greece, the Oracle of Delphi had become more symbolic. Pythia was only a mediator for Apollo. Nenata's role, in contrast, seemed far more direct. Even more curious, and unsettling, was the fact that Nenata's acolytes would encase her in lead, leaving only her face exposed, and then lower her into the pool of fumes itself. This extreme act was reserved for times of greatest need, for it often killed her current vessel, and Nenata herself confessed that each successive vessel seemed frailer than the last.

It was clear that the Children of Nenata did not merely believe in seers and oracles; they had witnessed their abilities firsthand. Fragment 9.58 expanded on this, claiming the gift of prescience had once been widespread during the Long Dawn but was decreasing as the centuries passed. It was decreasing because humans were losing their connection to the Breath.

At that time, apart from Nenata herself, only a handful of seers remained. People would walk for years, even if they now only lived for mere decades, seeking their counsel. Among these surviving oracles was the enigmatic Oracle of Naethalam, said to dwell in a nearly impenetrable jungle south of a vast desert. There was Keura, who lived among the Kaedurath of the Green Slopes; a man known only as Crystal Eyes, whose home lay in the distant eastern mountains ; and the Whispering Sisters of Thamar, who inhabited a swamp. Earlier fragments had also mentioned Zarathum the Flame-Bearer, who inhabited the eastern highlands, but by Fragment 9.58, he was presumed dead after walking into a massive pyre and never returned.

Apart from these, there were two seers in all of human history who stood apart from the rest.

The first was Athura of the Loom, the last “Black Weaver” of the People of the Obsidian Loom. She was born with purple eyes, which were said to pierce the veil of our present and glimpse what lay beyond it. Before leading her people out of their rapidly drying highland homeland, Athura wove and sealed a colossal tapestry. This tapestry contained within its intricate patterns the stories of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of events yet to unfold. It was her parting gift to a world she knew would forget her, but she always claimed that, even if the mountains become a barren and inhospitable wasteland, the Breath would guide those who need to be guided to her tapestry. Based on contextual clues from early fragments like 1.23, and also my own understanding of palaeoclimatology, Athura was likely born in the Tibesti Mountains of Chad around 4,500 BCE, not long before the Book of Nenata began its compilation.

The second great seer was far more ancient — Akalos, Seer of Flames. Unlike Athura, he was a pyromancer who gazed into fire and saw vast spans of time, calamities and triumphs alike. He lived for nine centuries, it is said, before vanishing without a trace, walking, perhaps, into his own prophecy. Even by the era of Athra-Midon's sinking, Akalos was already a legend of the deep past. Counting backward from the generations the chroniclers placed between him and their own time, we estimate Akalos lived sometime in the 9th millennium BCE, dying around 8,000 BCE.

——————————————————————————————————————————————

I have now shared with you the provenance of the Book of Nenata and what we know of the Breath. You have glimpsed lost civilisations of which we have found no trace, and observed the extended lifespans of humanity before the sinking of Athra-Midon. Through these words, you have seen with your own eyes what became of the Library of Memory, and how oracles and seers shaped the world of these ancient people.

And now, at last, you are ready to understand what the warnings contained within the Book of Nenata mean for us.

Every seer and oracle, from Nenata herself to Athura of the Loom, foretold that humanity would one day forget the Breath. They warned that we would wander the earth like empty vessels, aimless and hollow. This prophecy recurs again and again throughout the Book of Nenata. I could have chosen any one of dozens of fragments to share with you. But we, the Nenata Research Council, have unanimously chosen the one that stuck with us the most. It was written by Dathenar, the fourth chronicler and my personal favourite.

For the fragment I am about to share, I must share the identity of Leluth of Aram. Apart from Nenata, he is the only known individual to have inhabited multiple vessels. He was but a youth when Athra-Midon was swallowed by the deluge, escaping aboard one of the few surviving vessels. For years he wandered the world, lost in grief for all that humanity had known and lost. But in time, Leluth claimed he found a purpose. He withdrew from the world, living as a recluse, though occasionally he emerged to share his wisdom. Each time he died, he returned in a new vessel, and each time, he retained the extraordinary lifespans of the Long Dawn. He provided stories and counsel to each of the first four chroniclers. The fragment I am about to share with you was his final contribution before disappearing from the world forever.

——————————————————————————————————————————————

**Fragment 10.14**

*As set down by Dathenar, Fourth of the Chroniclers*

*I, Dathenar, bearer of the obsidian stylus and servant to the Breath's whisper, now lay forth what Leluth of Aram confided to me in his last season of strength. For among all the gifts he passed to the Book of Nenata, this final utterance weighed most heavily upon him:*

*It was after the wailing of Athra-Midon had fallen into silence that Leluth of Aram began wandering this world, lamenting all that was lost. One eve, as he stumbled through the eastern highlands, Leluth saw in the distance a vast and steady blaze that crowned the plateau like a second sun, defying the moonless night. Compelled as though pulled by the Breath's own hand, Leluth drew nearer.*

*At the pyre's base stood a figure, tall and robed in grey. To Leluth's astonishment, it was a certain Reciter of the Second Circle who had once spoken to Leluth deep within the Library of Memory. He was one of the few Reciters to survive the sinking of Athra-Midon. But now there was no library, no halls of obsidian, only the night and the fire.*

*The Reciter spoke: "You have walked long, Leluth of Aram. Long enough that your vessel grows weary, and your Breath strains to hold it. We are both here by the design of the Breath. We are both here by the design of Akalos, the Seer of Flames.”*

*They sat together in silence as the flames roared. They consumed nothing, yet were continuously replenished. Leluth did not ask what fuel fed it, but in its glow he saw the figures of men and women, their faces twisted in both ecstasy and torment.*

*Finally, the Reciter spoke again: "Leluth of Aram, you will be the Last Ember of Athra-Midon. One day, when you must depart this plane of existence, the time will come for you to share the knowledge of what I tell you. This knowledge was given to Akalos in his last days, as he bowed to the Breath at a pyre even bigger than this one. It is not a gift I give you lightly, nor one you may lay down once taken."*

*Leluth responded: "If I do not carry this final ember, I will wander a hollow vessel."*

*The Reciter spoke solemnly. "So be it." He began to tell how, after the Deluge consumed Athra-Midon and the Library of Memory drowned in silence, he too wandered. Eventually, he found a wide chasm that called to him. Down he climbed until he emerged at the bottom. He continued onwards until he eventually discovered an ancient stone door marked in glyphs so old they predated even the Ten Poisons as written by Prophetess Selur of Thamar.*

*Beyond laid a cavern aglow with crimson flame from torches that looked unnatural. At the centre lay Akalos, Seer of Flames. The Seer's body was embalmed with such skill that even millennia later his flesh bore no rot. Around him stood thousands of sealed capsae, some of obsidian, some of crystal, each humming faintly.*

*In a corner, the Reciter found a capsa that matched his Hum. And so he took it. Upon it were written glyphs; these were the words of Akalos. Though his lips had been still for millennia, his voice now breathed into Thoras, the Reciter of the Second Circle:*

*"Greetings, Thoras, son of Raphenol. Though you and I have never met in the flesh, I knew you would come, for the Breath showed me your face long before your vessel was ever formed of clay and dust. I know the weight upon your shoulders, the lament that fills your heart at the loss of the Library of Memory. You weep for its drowning, and I weep with you. I wished that the Library could truly be eternal. But nothing is, not even the flesh of seers. Only the Breath. So I speak from beyond the veil, though my vessel lies still and hollow. You, Thoras, will now hold what I saw, what I carried. I will ask only a little of you, and in return, I will leave you with knowledge."*

*"Thoras, the Grand Pyre showed me my place in the weaving of time. I am but one thread, yet I was marked to burn brighter than most. The Breath granted me prescience greater than any before, and it is by its design that I must use my abilities to warn the Breathless humans of what is to come. My work was not yet done when my vessel first withered. I retreated here, to this final resting place, where I gazed into my pyres until my eyes no longer saw and yet saw still. I left messages for those who would dare the descent, for those whose Breath would guide them to these words. Through my pyres I learnt tongues that would not be spoken for millennia and etched these glyphs you now read, though they mean nothing in my time."*

*"The future is not fixed, but most paths end in darkness. I have seen humanity rise and then crumble. You see it even in your time: Man is forgetting the Breath. Centuries after your time, humanity will fall into an age of darkness you cannot imagine. You would weep if you saw into my flames. In the ages to come, they will sever their bond with the earth that bore them. Forests will fall, their roots torn up and their canopies burned away. Rivers will run thick with poisons until even the smallest fish float lifeless upon their surfaces. Great herds that once roamed in freedom will dwindle to nothing, their bones bleaching under sunless skies. The air itself will grow heavy and sour, no longer fit to draw into one's lungs. In place, they will build towers of glass that scrape the sky, but their souls will remain hollow vessels. Their cities will be consumed by endless seas of metal beasts which choke the Breath. They will rediscover the importance of washing with water and consider themselves advanced for learning to stretch their lifespans mere decades beyond their forebears, yet never again will they live centuries. People will declare themselves masters over their neighbours, waging wars of fire and iron to erase them. And though they will grasp at knowledge with desperate hands, they will forget the Breath that once granted it."*

*"But among all these paths, one alone leads true: a path where, in the far future, the Breathless humans awaken and return to the way of the Breath. They will cast aside their monuments of glass and steel and live in harmony with the living earth once more. The forests will be reborn, the rivers will run clear, and even the winds will sing with renewal. Their homes will blend with the land like moss upon stone, and they will take no more than the earth is willing to give. No beast will fear their footfalls, for they will walk as keepers, not conquerors. They will respect one another, and once again, a noble will smile at a farmer, for they live as neighbours. In this way, the Breath may yet flow freely through all things again."*

*"There are roles to play for all to succeed. Each who enters this chamber holds a thread. Some threads are small, others monumental, but all are needed to weave the pattern. Some will fail. When they do, others will be called to their place. The Breath chooses and calls each in its own time. Even now, it calls to you, Thoras. You are not the first to stand here, and you will not be the last. Your task is simple but important. You must find Leluth of Aram once more and set him upon his path. He is the Last Ember of Athra-Midon. He will wander in vessels of clay and dust, lifetime after lifetime. But on his final Breath, he will know. He must seek this chamber and perform one last deed. If he takes your words to heart, it may yet be that my message to you reaches even Breathless humans."*

*Leluth finished his recitation: "And so it was, Dathenar, that I understood my place. I am the Last Ember, and my time approaches. I have lived lifetimes upon lifetimes, but this vessel will be my final. Tomorrow I depart for the eastern highlands to seek the chamber and fulfill the Breath’s design."*

*Thus I, Dathenar, have set down this account from Leluth of Aram, the Last Ember of the Sunken City of Athra-Midon.*

I have no words for what we found in Fragment 10.14. None of us do.

We translated it last week, and for three days afterwards, the entire team sat in silence. Ten thousand years ago, a pyromancer spoke before writing even existed, and now, against all odds, you are reading his words. He hoped his message would survive the ages to reach the Breathless humans: the ones who build towers of glass, who choke the world with cars, who plunder the earth for profit and cannot stop waging war. That message was meant for us.

There are no sceptics left among us. The Book of Nenata is fact. It is warning. It is plea. Humanity must realign itself with the Breath, or all paths will converge on ruin. This is not some trite, anticlimactic environmentalist moral tacked onto the end of a story. It is the single most important truth we have ever uncovered. And we will not pretend to have answers. But this much is clear: this information must be shared. The world needs to see it. Every single human being needs to read these words. Perhaps, somewhere out there, there are still those who remain connected to the Breath. Perhaps now they will feel the courage to step forward and teach the rest of us what we have forgotten.

Or perhaps this is all in vain, and one of the many dark paths for humanity will be chosen. But that pathway will not just affect us; it very well may destroy the entire planet alongside us.

We of the Nenata Research Collective choose not to believe in despair. We choose to believe in the faint, stubborn light of humanity's better nature. We choose to believe there is still time.
