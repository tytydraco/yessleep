  
It was 9pm and I was looking forward to a fun night out with my friends at the local club. We were looking forward to switching off, dancing and just having fun. The club lights were blazing and the music was pulsing as we hit the dance floor. At first everything seemed to be fine.  
  
But suddenly I realized that one of my friends, Tim, had disappeared. I asked my other friends where he was and they said he'd met her and gone to the bathroom with her. A mischievous smile crept onto their faces and I could guess what they meant.  
  
We danced and laughed, time passed quickly and the atmosphere was exuberant. But then something weird happened. The door to the club closed with a loud bang, sending an uneasy shiver through the crowd. We looked around confused, because something like that shouldn't happen in a club. The teller, an elderly man with a kind face, rushed to open the door. But before he could reach her, the unbelievable happened. The door seemed to take on a life of its own and crashed down on the man. A scream echoed through the room and we stared in horror at the lifeless form of the teller.  
  
The shock and panic was palpable as the crowd poured towards the emergency exit, hoping for an end to this nightmare. But when we reached the emergency exit, the horror repeated itself. The door remained tightly shut, and the desperation grew. The mood turned from joy to horror as we realized we were trapped in this club without knowing why or how.  
  
A wave of anxiety swept over us, and an ominous feeling permeated the darkness of the club. Then the lights went out. Absolute darkness surrounded us, and the screams of the people mingled with my own rapid heartbeat. We felt our way forward unsteadily, the uncertainty and fear were literally palpable.  
  
The sounds of darkness were as eerie as the situation itself. Whispering voices seemed to come from everywhere, whispering shadows moving around us. I could hear my own pulse pounding in my ears as I lost myself in this dark world. Thoughts raced in my head as I tried to comprehend what was going on.  
  
The darkness seemed endless as we slowly gathered in a corner of the club. Our backs pressed against the wall and our breathing was shallow and rapid. We tried to calm each other down, but the fear remained omnipresent. Hours passed while we waited for something to happen.  
  
Then, suddenly, the light returned. The door to the club was open and we didn't hesitate a moment longer. Uncertainly, we ventured out into the night that seemed safer than the cursed place we had left. The street lamps lit the way, and our relieved breath mingled with the cool night air.  
  
When I finally got home, the shock was still deep. I would never forget that night - the damn club, the horrible events and the nagging question of what exactly happened. The memories of that night would stay with me for a long time, as an eerie and inexplicable episode in my life.
