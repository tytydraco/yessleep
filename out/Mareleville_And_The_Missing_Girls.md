We don’t have much of a police presence here in Mareleville, being in the middle of nowhere, most of us eventually want out when we come of age. 
I reckon I can count on both hands how many officers we have. 
We have a lot of weird goings on but never something that really required any cops until that first girl went missing, so as you probably guessed, they joined up with the villagers in putting in curfews and a search of the village and surrounding forest. 
The girls were never found. 

Two months later, another girl goes missing. And another, and another. 

Then Charlotte, my girlfriend went missing. 

By this point our police and locals were baffled, there was no evidence of them leaving and no evidence of anyone abducting them. 

But with Charlotte gone, I was distraught. I had to find her. 
I’d just turned 18 and went to our only pub, The Wolf Shack. 
I downed a whiskey and some guy I didn’t recognise came and sat next to me. 
He was dressed in a long blood red trench coat and a black trilby. I looked at him with eyes of wanting to be left alone but then he spoke. 

“I’ll help you find her, Charlotte I mean”

It was the fact he knew her name that made me jump up and punch him. When I did, he laughed and told me he was a friend and that I needed to calm down or I’d never find her. 
So of course I sat back down and told him to talk. 

“Call me Tripel, I’m a private investigator but you need not know who hired me”

Ok, it made sense now how he knew her name, someone had hired him to find her but why not tell me? 
I thought it might have been her parents or one of her friends who didn’t want to put more shit on me. 

Tripel handed me his business card, it was black with red lettering. Three L’s with a phone number underneath. 

“So what’s your actual name?” I asked. 
“Doesn’t matter, just call me Tripel and listen”
I nodded, I couldn’t be bothered to pry, and if he was going to help as he said, I didn’t want to piss him off either. 

“I don’t know where she is now, but I know she’s still in Mareleville and we need to find her fast before this whole world goes to shit, this is my buddy Hero and he’ll sniff her out in no time”

He clicked his fingers and a small ginger Bloodhound came out from between his legs, looked up at me and winked. How I hadn’t noticed he had a dog, I don’t know. I didn’t really care either. Any and all help were welcome and Bloodhounds have an amazing sense of smell and tracking ability. 

Tripel ordered me another whiskey, told me to down it and follow him. 
That’s when things started getting weird. Or weirder let’s say. 

The music in the pub suddenly came to a stop mid song, everybody went quiet, I looked at Tripel and he just shrugged his shoulders at me. 
Hero started to growl. 
I looked to where he was staring intently and realised everybody in the pub except for us three had been frozen in time. People’s mouths were hanging open from talking and singing, a glass was halfway to the floor after being knocked by a drunk and it looked like one guy was about to fall backwards off his chair. 

Then the entrance door opened. 
Charlotte walked in, her beautiful black hair swaying in a non existent wind. 
I had a feel of relief wash over me and I stood to run to her but as soon as my feet touched the floor, the floor beneath cracked and started to open. 
All I saw was a white glow as I began to fall through.
But then I stopped mid air, almost frozen in time like the rest of the patrons. I could still move, just not up or down. 
Tripel was still sat at the bar, he’d picked up the now going crazy Hero and held him tight. 

Then I saw Charlotte’s face peer over the hole with a smile. 

“Char”
She cut me off half way, placing a finger to her mouth to shush me, I found I couldn’t finish her name. 

“Adie, don’t look for me, it’ll only end badly and I don’t want to hurt you. Tripel, nice to see you, shame about the circumstance” 

“Yes Miss” was all he replied. 
Hero was now barking quietly, the ferocity was still there but it was like he’d had his volume lowered.

Charlotte then left. Tripel dropped Hero, grabbed my hand and pulled me up, the hole closed and time restarted. 

“You fucking know her?” I screamed in Tripel’s face. 
“No sir, well yes sir but no sir”. 
“What does that even mean?”
“I don’t know her, she knows me. She knows everyone now”
“Start making fucking sense”
“Hey, it’s exactly how I say it is, she took over and now she knows everyone”
“Took over what?”
“Hell”. 

Normally if someone said something like that to me, I’d have laughed. But in light of what had happened, I couldn’t. I actually believed him. 
He looked at me and smiled, knowing I was still going to look for her regardless. A strange hope that I could somehow save her from what she’d become. 

“Least I still got a job then”
“And on the way, you’re going to tell me who in the literal hell you are”
He chuckled and nodded as we left The Wolf Shack and its drunkards behind.
