I saw another one today. It was spray-painted above the entrance to a sewer, along with an arrow pointing downward into the darkness. Twenty years later, MVSH is finally back in town. 

*MVSH.* Four little letters. I know it's stupid to be scared of them, just as I know that no one is likely to remember me as the person I was twenty years ago. None of that helps when the memories come flooding back. 

The summer I turned seventeen, my life was about music: grimy basement mosh-pits, drunken field concerts where the amps were plugged into some survivalist’s gas generator, night drives with the windows down and the radio blaring. A part-time job at Sundown Records paid bums to buy beer for me and kept my gas tank needle half an inch from empty. My parents bit their nails about my future, but I didn’t care: why shouldn’t life just go on like this forever?

Working at Sundown Records had another perk as well: I got to spend time with Dylan Fughes. He was a big name in the local underground scene, and his music shop reflected it. The walls were covered with the concert flyers of bands he’d discovered and made great; the high-end sound system played only music that met his own exacting standards. 

My interview at Sundown was just to listen to three songs and tell Dylan what I thought of them. When I told him I thought they all sucked, a polished white smile flashed across his face; he put his crocodile-skin shoes up on his desk and told me that the job was mine if I wanted it. 

Dylan gave me tips on all the most exclusive shows, even let me borrow albums from the shop. He was charming, he was worldly, and unlike the boys in my high school, he actually knew how to dress himself. It wasn’t long before I was head-over-heels in love with him. That was how it started. 

I was breaking down cardboard boxes in the hallway beside his office when the phone rang. My heart skipped a beat: *nobody* dared to call Dylan after five PM, not unless it was an emergency. I still remember the giddiness in Dylan’s voice when I pressed my ear against the door to eavesdrop:

*“Really? They are?* *I’ll be there.”* 

Dylan burst out into the hallway just as I got back to my heap of cardboard. *Big news, Vee,* he was yelling. *MVSH is playing this weekend!*

I’d missed a key word in there: it had sounded like his mouth had suddenly filled up with half-chewed meat. Dylan rolled his eyes at my blank expression. Apparently, *“MVSH”* was the hottest thing on the scene right now. No one knew who the band members were, where they were from, or even how to pronounce their group’s name; MVSH didn’t even sell tickets to their concerts. The only way in was to show up with a specific food item: it served as proof that you had been told about the show by someone close to the band.

I nodded along to Dylan’s story, not trusting myself to speak. When I was alone with him, my words tangled themselves into stupid, humiliating knots. I always wound up talking to my shoes, and half the time I had no idea what I had actually said to him. I was thinking about how unfair that was when I realized that Dylan had just invited me to go see MVSH with him. 

*Sure, I guess,* I finally managed to shrug. My boss must have seen right through my attempt to look careless. There was a sneer on his face as he peered out into the shop: he wanted to make sure no one overhead what he was about to say next. I got goosebumps as he leaned in close and whispered:

“Well, then. There are a few other things you’re going to need to know…” 

I had it all planned out. I waited until my father had finished three-fourths of his coffee and reached the sports section of the newspaper before I asked him if I could stay over with my friend Sara on Friday night. We had a biology exam on Monday, I lied, and Sara wanted to study together.

My father glanced up sharply, and I knew I was busted. I had been an idiot to suggest that I cared about school; he knew me better than that. He gazed out the window, brushed some crumbs off of his tie, and sighed:

“Sure, honey. You can go. But you’re bringing Raquel.” 

Trying to hide the horrified expression on my face, I gave him a quick hug and bolted out the door. This was going to ruin *everything.* 

The difference between my sister Raquel and I was clear just by looking at our notebooks. Hers were neat, detailed, each perfectly-shaped letter contained inside the lines; mine were jumbled and chaotic–filled with stickers, doodles, and my friends’ phone numbers. If I tried to leave Raquel alone at Sara’s, she would rat me out for sure. My only option was to bring her to see MVSH as *my* guest–and hope that I could convince her to follow Dylan’s bizarre instructions.

The afternoon before the concert, we raided the heaps of donated clothes in the Methodist church basement. We were searching for the ugliest, filthiest stuff we could find. Dylan said that MVSH didn’t let anyone in unless they looked like they had been sleeping in a dumpster for a few weeks; I told Raquel that we could throw everything away after the concert anyway. 

“Gross.” My sister made a face. 

I took a deep breath and did my best to explain to Raquel that seeing MVSH live was a life-changing experience. Did she really think that *Dylan Hughes* would be wrong about something like that?

If she did, she kept her mouth shut about it, finally settling on a pair of paint-splattered khaki pants and a greasy orange T-shirt. The jeans and tuxedo vest that I’d picked out for myself were in tatters, but at least they fit me and (sort of) matched. I was especially proud of a leather belt I’d discovered  in a dusty corner beneath some trash bags. Its steel buckle was brick-heavy and handmade in the shape of a grinning skull. Now there was just one last stop to make before we caught a bus to the location that Dylan had given me. 

“What’s with the soup?” Raquel asked later, when she saw me pocketing two packets of bullion cubes at the mini-mart across from the bus station. 

I repeated Dylan’s instructions: 

“When you go to a MVSH concert, you’ve got to bring something that shows you know somebody cool. You know, like a password. This time, it’s chicken soup cubes. We got lucky. Dylan says that one year it was oatmeal, and last time, it was pig’s blood.” 

“Hey!” Raquel hurried after me, whispering: “You’re going to pay for that, right?”

I got us a coin locker across from some broken-down payphones. As we stored our stuff,  I reminded Raquel that she couldn’t bring *anything* into the show with her: no wallet, no phone, *nothing.* 

“For punks, these guys sure have a lot of rules.” Raquel complained–but handed over her shoulder bag anyway. 

When the bus arrived, Raquel sat in the front seat, her spine straight and her hands folded neatly in her lap. I lounged beside her, drumming my fingers impatiently on the windows and hoping she wouldn’t realize how nervous I was. I had assumed that Dylan would be fine with me inviting one extra person…but what if he wasn’t? 

Our stop was near the end of the line, its crazily-leaning sign barely visible in the amber streetlight glow. I was expecting some gritty industrial club with steel shutters and a line of leather-clad hipsters at the door, but the sidewalk was empty. The factories and warehouses looming over us were either closed down or partly demolished; mangy cats prowled through the weed-choked lots. The only sign of life was a pair of white semi-trucks backed up against one of the decrepit buildings. For the first time, I found myself doubting my boss’ intentions. What if Dylan was just toying with me? What if the whole thing was just some kind of cruel joke? 

Raquel and I slipped through a gap in a chain-link fence, then turned down a blind alley. At the far end, *MVSH* was spray-painted above a rusted factory door. A crowd had already started to gather: their clothes were just ragged as ours, and there was a packet of bullion cubes in every hand. I spotted Dylan’s silky smooth hair right away. We had made it.  

As my boss approached, that feeling of relief vanished. Without his expensive clothes and soft lighting of the record shop, Dylan looked…*old.* He licked his lips when he saw me, and suddenly I wanted to puke. I wondered what an adult man was doing inviting a teenage girl to an event like this, then wondered why it had taken me so long to ask that question in the first place. The hungry expression on his face soured when he saw Raquel at my side:

“Who’s this?”

“My sister Raquel.” 

“I *specifically* told you that there’s only one invite per guest!”

“Right. You invited me, and I invited my sister.” I found myself getting angry on Raquel’s behalf. Who did Dylan think he was? She had just as much of a right to be here as anyone else! “If its a problem, we can just leave–”

“No, no problem.” Dylan clearly still thought he had a chance. He looked at Raquel’s outfit and snorted. “Just act like you don’t know me when you get to the door, okay?” 

“That won’t be hard.” Raquel snorted. There was a sarcastic edge to her voice that I had never heard before, and it occurred to me that maybe my sister was more than just the whiny teacher’s pet that I had always believed her to be. Maybe during these long years of high school, she had changed, too. 

A breeze blew down the alley, carrying dust, ripped-up plastic bags, and soggy newspaper pages. One of them stuck to Dylan’s pants and he pried it off with two fingers as though it were some disgusting laboratory experiment. 

“So do these guys always keep their audience waiting forever?” Raquel asked. “Or are we special?”

Dylan, usually so glib and sarcastic in his office, suddenly had nothing to say.

At the far end of the alley, the factory door opened with a metallic screech. We all clapped–even Raquel–but our cheers died in our throats when we saw the six hulking figures that walked out of it. If they were bouncers, they were the most intimidating security team that I had ever seen. 

It wasn’t just how eerily similar they all looked, with their bald heads and pale skin; it wasn’t even how large they were. It was their eyes. There was no emotion in them at all. The six of them were surveying the crowd like we were cattle waiting to be processed. I had been to concerts with sketchy security–sometimes motorcycle gangs or ex-convicts–but this was different. Something was wrong.

Before I could express what I was feeling to Raquel, the line started to move. The six strangers were even more disturbing up close: something about their pasty skin reminded me of cold porridge or graying meat left out to spoil. Their outfits were made of stitched-together strips of ragged old clothing–clothing that looked a lot like ours. Two of them were scanning the concert-goers with metal detecting wands. Raquel gripped my arm.

“I have a phone…” she whispered. 

“*What?!*” I snapped.

I wasn’t worried about not getting in; I was concerned about what those pale strangers might do to us if we gave them an excuse to do it. Dylan had made it clear that MVSH was ruthless about enforcing their weird rules, and if they dragged us out of line here–in an industrial wasteland far from any help–anything might happen. 

“Dad said I couldn’t go unless I brought it…” 

I bit my lip and held out my hand to Raquel:

“Hand it over.” 

Using Dylan’s broad back as cover, I slipped my sister’s cell phone down the front of my pants. If it triggered the metal detectors, I could just point to the steel belt buckle that was covering it. They wouldn’t investigate further…I hoped. The closer we got to the six of them, the less confident I felt. Those beady black eyes never seemed to blink, and there was a *smell* to them–something irony and astringent that I couldn’t quite identify. 

Raquel looked over her shoulder at me as rough hands separated us. Their metal detecting wands moved over our bodies. Raquel disappeared through the lightless factory door just as my belt buckle set off a horrible electronic whine. The large figure in front of me pointed wordlessly at it. Forcing my mouth into a sheepish smile, I took the buckle off for closer inspection. As I did, I shook the phone further down my pant leg. 

The strangers passed the buckle around, then handed it back to me. Their metal detectors passed over my hips and thighs, but there was nothing there to trigger them anymore. Looking almost disappointed, they waved me through. 

I couldn’t see anything, but from the way the crowd pressed up against me, I guessed we were in some kind of corridor. I called out to Raquel, but she didn’t respond. I had an awful feeling that if I stopped or stubbled, I would be trampled to death by a mass of shuffling hipster feet. Everyone had gotten over the shock of the six strangers at the door.  People murmured and shoved each other forward, eager to see what MVSH had in store for them next. 

We filed out into a much larger space, and stage lights came on above. It was a sort of square room that had been set up on the factory floor, with solid metal walls that were about three times my height. The stage hung overhead, casting fractured shadows onto the excited faces around me. 

When MVSH walked out onstage, the applause was scattered: the band members were the same six grim, burly figures who had been working security outside! What the hell was going on? A hairy hand squeezed my shoulder and I jumped. Dylan was right behind me. He kept jabbing his finger at the walls and shouting something, but the band had already started playing: I couldn’t have heard him even if I’d wanted to. It was easy to lose him in the crowd. 

Dylan had been right about one thing: I had never heard *anything* like MVSH before. When they began their first set, the droning buzz felt like I had stuck my head into a hornet’s nest; the *chug-chug-chug* of the bass reminded me unnervingly of chomping teeth. People glanced at the faces around them, unsure: was this really the band we had all gone through so much trouble to see? Despite their doubts, the crowd began to dance along to the music–probably hoping, like I was, that what we were hearing was just a buildup to something less…*disturbing.*

I bounced and swayed along with the  rest of them. I wanted to lose myself in the music, to forget about the sense of unease that Dylan’s wild-eyed expression had left me with. I kept seeing the same face as I moved through the audience, which was more tightly packed than ever–but there was no sign of Raquel. That nagging sense of wrongness was getting stronger and stronger. 

Sprinklers switched on overhead, soaking us all with oily, lukewarm water. The dance floor filled with the out-of-place cozy scent of chicken broth: the bullion cubes we’d all brought with us were dissolving. The nasty liquid puddled around our feet, making the metallic walls and floor even more slick than they already were. Someone threw a shoe at the band; I was no longer the only one looking around anxiously for an exit. 

About half the crowd was loving it–or at least, they had convinced themselves that they were. They slam-danced in a sweaty, frenzied mosh pit just below the stage, oblivious to the creeping claustrophobia that the rest of us felt. That was where I finally spotted Raquel: spinning her wet hair and pumping one fist above her head. She was having the time of her life. 

The hipster beside me bumped into me. He blinked, wiped water from his expensive glasses confusedly, then turned back to the band. It didn’t make sense: we had both been standing still. No one had slammed into us or forced us to collide with one another, which left only one explanation: *the room was somehow getting smaller.* Was that what Dylan had meant when he had pointed to the walls? That they were moving somehow? 

Squeezing through all those slimy bodies to reach my sister probably took just a few minutes, but it felt like it took hours. Raquel threw her arms around me; I wasn’t sure what she was screaming, but from her big grin I understood that she was thanking me for bringing her here. Her smile faded when she saw the worried look on my face, the way I kept pointing away from the stage.

I tugged on Raquel’s arm, but her slick skin slipped right through my fingers. She shook her head, and her disgusted glare showed me exactly what she was thinking. She had spent all those years studying, all those years being the *“good”* daughter while I went out and had fun–and now I was trying to drag her away from her first night out. Raquel shoved me away and started dancing harder than ever.

The soup-reeking water was almost knee-high and rising. Up on stage, *MVSH* hammered on their instruments. Did they even know how to play them? Or were they just making as much noise as possible to cover the rumble of the engines hidden inside the walls. By the time Raquel and the rest of the audience realized what was happening, it would be too late. 

Sticky flesh and wet clothing pressed in on me from all sides. The claustrophobic feeling made me want to scream, and eventually, that’s exactly what I did. My shrieking became so loud that I could almost hear it over the *“music,”*  but nobody nearby paid me any attention. They were convinced that this was what they had come here to see. 

No matter how much I squirmed, I just. Couldn’t. Move. Only when the pressure had pushed my belt buckle so deeply into my skin that it hurt did I think of the phone I had smuggled in with me. I twisted my arm until I could reach into my jeans and pull it free. The rectangular screen glowed like a lighthouse beacon on the dim dance floor. 

The band stopped playing. An angry cry rose from all sides: *I had broken MVSH’s rules!* Through the wall of irritated faces I caught a glimpse of Raquel, looking more furious than any of them. Someone swatted at the device in my hand, and suddenly I was being shoved, lifted, pulled in all directions by a mob of strangers. I kept a death-grip on the phone, fighting to punch three digits into the screen: *9-1-1.* 

One of the *MVSH* members grabbed some long, cruel-looking tool that reminded me of a noose on a pole. It closed around my neck, dragging me backwards over all those angry, anonymous hands…onto the stage. I clawed helplessly at the rubber cord that was cutting off my air supply. The audience cheered.

“Please let me go.” I whimpered.

*“9-1-1, what’s your emergency?”* A cheery voice blared from the phone’s speaker. 

The crowd fell silent; the *MVSH* members looked at each other. One grabbed me by the arm and dragged me offstage. The others picked up their instruments, ready to continue their performance.  

*“Hello? This is 9-1-1. Please state your emergency.”* 

The operator’s words echoed eerily from the abandoned factory walls. I was being taken back out the corridor we had walked in through, toward the alley door. The MVSH member tightened his grip around my bicep until I thought my arm would snap in half. He hadn’t said a word, but the message was clear: he could beat me to death a long time before the police could arrive. 

*“Remain on the line, and first responders will…”*

“Oh geez,” I apologized. “I must have called by accident. I am *sooo* sorry!” I hoped the operator couldn’t hear the quaver in my voice. There was a pause.

*“Are you sure you’re alright, ma’am?”* 

“No, I’m fine, I think I just rolled over in bed and hit a bunch of numbers on my phone,” I lied. “I’m not going to get in trouble for this, am I? I mean, I’m still a teenager…” 

The grip on my arm loosened and I backed out the rusted door. The MVSH member let me go but stayed within arm’s reach–ready to pounce if I broke our unspoken deal. 

*“Not this time, ma’am, but you need to be more careful in the future.”* 

*Click.* 

The MVSH member’s black eyes glared at me expressionlessly. I continued backing away, holding the glowing screen out in front of me like a magic amulet. I was ready to hit redial if he tried anything, and we both knew it. 

“I have a sister in there,” I began. “If you could tell her–” 

Another MVSH member came running out of the shadows, carrying that awful pole in his hands. I turned to run and felt the *woosh* of the pole as it swept over my head and slammed into my wrist. Pain exploded in my hand; Raquel’s phone shattered on the asphalt. I expected to hear chasing footsteps behind me, but instead, the steel-shuttered door slammed door slammed shut. 

It was like the pair had never been there at all. Deep within the guts of that abandoned factory, the concert was still going on, its unsuspecting audience being pressed tighter and tighter until…*what?* Until they were all crushed alive while the band played on above? I didn’t want to think about it, because somewhere in that crowd was my sister. 

My wet clothes stuck to my skin, reeking of chicken broth and reminding me of what was happening back there. I had to get help, but finding my way through the winding alleys between the warehouses was taking forever–and even once I got back to the road, there was no one passing through this derelict district so late at night. Caught somewhere between exhaustion and panic, I waved my arms at anyone that passed by. 

The first car didn’t stop. Neither did the second. After what felt like hours, a grizzled fifty-something in a pickup truck pulled off the road–but he kept his hand on a glovebox pistol just in case. He didn’t have a cell phone, but he would take me as far as a gas station where I could make a call. 

By the time my garbled story got out and the police closed in on the factory, it was almost dawn. MVSH, the two white semi trucks, and their audience had vanished. With so many sudden disappearances, I had imagined that the case would make national news, but none of the journalists my family contacted were interested. After a while, I began to see their point. *A traveling band that crushes its audience into goo?* Not even the weirdest tabloids would consider running a story like that. The police said nothing about my sister’s disappearance, only reassuring us that the investigation was *“ongoing.”* 

I started doing some digging of my own, and what I found was bizarre. Despite being such a supposedly *“phenomenal”* band, there was almost no information about MVSH online. What little there was got taken down almost as soon as it appeared, but even so it was clear that I wasn’t the only one who had lost a loved one to their deadly concerts. 

Someone on an anonymous forum claimed to have seen MVSH carrying plastic sacks of pink sludge into their white semi trucks after one of their shows; someone else said she found a heap of ripped, discarded clothing in the woods near where MVSH had performed. 

Two days into my search, I began to receive bizarre, threatening messages. They were nothing but a jumble of letters and numbers, but scattered inside the chaos were eerie details: the name of the drink I had ordered at the coffee shop that morning, the address of the friend whose apartment I’d visited the night before. 

After that came the phone calls. There was never any voice on the other end of the line, only a bunch of garbled noise…and screams. It was the sound of a MVSH concert. As soon as I stopped investigating MVSH, the messages and phone calls stopped. 

Did I want to know what had really happened to my sister? Sure, but not enough to die for it. I learned to live with the past. I went back to school, eventually getting a doctorate in literature and taking a teaching position at a forgettable college in the southeast. Bands don’t even come through this *state* while they’re on tour, much less this unimportant town.

And yet two days ago, the music professor approached me in the cafeteria with an excited sparkle in his eye. A super-experimental band was coming to town, he explained, one so exclusive that didn’t even charge tickets for entry. All we had to do was bring a few spice packets, and they would put on a show that would change our lives forever.
