I do believe in the things we can't see but I never thought that they actually existed in my house up until now. I was laying on my bed listening to some really loud music almost deafening. I couldn't hear anyone over it so I liked playing it at the highest volume. You know block out the noise of the world. Be in my little world. It was your usual Saturday night. We live in a fairly quiet neighbourhood so you donâ€™t have much happening around. The most that happened around was stray cats mewling and quarrelling in backyards. 

However, that night something unexpected happened. I heard a very aggressive thud over the music. Like someone had banged something very hard against a surface. At first I thought it was my mother probably up to use the restroom but the thud happened again right outside my room. It was so near that I was stunned for a minute. 

I stared out of my room into the dark expanse of the living room. It suddenly grew quiet and all I could hear was my own rapid breathing. I wondered if anyone else had heard that strange noise but it was 1am and everyone else in my house was fast asleep. I peered harder into the dark and the first thing I noticed were the stairs. Thats where the sound had come from. I was never paranoid of the stairs but right then I felt this weird feeling like something or someone was hunched over at the stairs. My first thought was I was just seeing things. I was tired and sleepy and I was seeing things. There was no one there. I'd locked every door myself. No one could get inside the house. I kept telling myself that and returned to listening to music but my eyes kept going back and forth to the stairs.

It was so dark so they took a while to adjust to that and right then I noticed the thing or figure again. Whatever it was it had moved by several inches. It was now hunched over the corner of the stairs. My blood had run cold. I could not make out if it had a solid body or not. It did not seem like something normal. My immediate next action was to scramble out and turn on the light. No one was there. Vacant stairs. No man no creature nothing. 

My mother had awoken and asked if everything was okay. I pointed to where I had last seen what I saw. There was no explanation as to what it was. She could tell I wasn't lying with the fear in my eyes. She believed me. She checked upstairs and downstairs but found no one. I slept in my mother's room that night. The next morning we searched the whole house once again for any break ins but nothing was out of place. Whatever or whoever that was was not human and I hope I never see it again.
