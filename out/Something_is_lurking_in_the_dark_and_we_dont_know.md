As a child, I was very afraid of the dark. There was something about the dark that scared me. Everytime I looked down a dark, empty room or a dark hallway, I expected something to jump out of a corner and get me.  
But that, never happened, and now that I am a teenager, I have realized that in fact, ghosts, monsters with 8 legs and giant spiders don't exist.

But, something that happened to me recently, changed my mind about everything.

I usually wake up in the middle of the night for no particular reason. When this happens, I stare at the ceilling for a few minutes, and then I just fall asleep again.

But one particular night, I experienced somethingÂ **horrifying**.

I woke up at about 4:23 in the morning, and thought : "meh, just another regular night". I then put my strategy into place : I started at the ceilling until I fell asleep. But this time, it didn't work, I just couldn't fall asleep.

And then, It happened.

I heard a single footstep.

And then, another one.

And a last footstep, before they stopped.

I was scared, but I didn't want to check what it was. I didn't have the courage to check. I just sat there, frozen in place.

A while later, I started hearing a beeping sound which repeated, kind of like a primed bomb about to explode. The beeping kept getting faster, and faster until it stopped. Then, I saw what looked like a shadow, standing almost next to my door, looking towards the entrance of my parent's bedroom. It then dissapeared after a bit. I wasn't experiencing sleep paralysis, but I was too scared to even move my eyeballs around.

Eventually, I got the courage and looked down the door...... nothing. There was nothing there. Was I seeing things? But then, it happened. I heard the loudest scream that I have ever heard. It was coming from downstairs. I was scared. I couldn't move... I didn't want to move. I was frozen. I looked down my door again... nothing... and again.... nothing. After some time, I heard what sounded like a cat mewing, but it was somehow....... different. "No, it can't be " I think. "Is this a nightmare?" I pinch my arm, but I don't sudenlly wake up.

Eventually, I somehow calmed down, closed my eyes, and fell asleep. When I woke up the next day, I imediatelly checked the time : 7:31. I got up and went downstairs. I didn't tell anybody about what I had experienced, because I felt they wouldn't believe me.

Also, I never really talked to any physciatrists, as I don't have any physcological problems. But, I needed someody to know, and that's where you guys come in. I don't expect you to believe what I have written, neither am I certain that everybody who reads it will love it, but it's here.

After this night, I am now certain, that something is always lurking in the dark.
