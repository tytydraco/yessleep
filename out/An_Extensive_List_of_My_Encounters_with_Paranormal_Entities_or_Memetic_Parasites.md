This is a personal first-hand account of my experiences with what many would consider to be the supernatural. While I do believe there are natural explanations for the phenomena I have experienced, I am going to explain the events as plainly as I can before elaborating as to my personal theories.

As a child, I used to have night terrors, I would claim a man would come out of my closet and yell at me. My siblings saw him as well. One night, my mother came in to calm me down and encountered the man. She described him as wearing overalls and a baseball cap. She was so scared she didn’t know what to do and he just left. To this day we don’t know who he was.

I don’t remember much about this, however I have been told the story by numerous people and closets give me anxiety to this day.

One of the earliest memories I have regarding this stuff pertains to my “Leprechaun.” When I was a kid, my grandmother gave me an old toy goblin/space alien guy that seemingly went to some sort of board game, as it was only an inch or two tall. He was a little, bald green man, with pointy ears, yellow eyes, and a little sash that went over him like a bandolier. The reason we all regarded him as a Leprechaun was that he had a little hole in his head, and in that hole was a four leaf clover when we found him. If we put the Leprechaun on a shelf with other toys they would often wind up thrown across the room or broken mysteriously. I honestly chalk this up to my sisters pulling pranks on me, as they were quite older than me and enjoyed doing things like that, however there was one experience I actually witnessed myself. One time I caught myself being spied on in my sister’s room by a tiny, green figure. However, the thing is, it wasn’t like the same type of green as the plastic of the toy, it was an electric green. The type you might see if you closed your eyes after having a camera flash in your face. I began chasing it and it was unmistakably a humanoid figure. It ran all the way back to its spot on the dresser, which was when I realized it was my Leprechaun. Nothing like that ever happened again, but it was still impactful.

My house burned down on June 6, 2006 due to unknown causes. I know that may seem like it’s part of the supernatural stuff, as it is so insanely on the nose, but I don’t really think it’s supernatural in nature, and I will give my own theories regarding the more outrageous sightings and experiences listed, however this is important to note because the Leprechaun was lost in the fire, and we moved into a rent house while awaiting the rebuilding of our new home.

At the rent house I only remember one account of anything spooky happening, I was laying down on the couch in our living room when I was grabbed by a hand coming from between the couch cushions. I immediately woke up my parents because this scared me shitless, but my father rationalized it as me sleeping on my hand, it falling asleep, and then me grabbing myself, scaring myself shitless. My arm wasn’t tingly at all however, but nonetheless it seems like a very rational explanation. 

After moving into our rebuilt new house, I played with a Ouiji board at my house with friends and everyone ran out of my room after seeing the shadow of a little girl behind us, although I never experienced this personally. None of my sister’s friends ever wanted to go near my room however, as even those not present for that event claimed it had a weird energy.

One event that wasn’t hallucinated at all was when a box on my shelf flew across my room out of nowhere. It scared me so bad that I screamed until my dad rushed to my room. Once again he rationalized, but I’m still unsure of how it happened the way it did. He figured the box merely fell and bounced off a drawer, but it literally flew across the room. I would say, rationally speaking, that it’s possible my ceiling fan combined with how the box was placed on the shelf caused a slight updraft so that when it fell it got more air then it seemingly should have. I’m sure there’s a better explanation than that that makes more sense, but I honestly do not know. 

I used to watch TV at night and I vividly recall how one time I went to sit down and watch television only to be gripped with terror, my whole body locked up, as I heard a voice booming both in and out of my head “**GET OUT**”, which I immediately did.

In order to fully disclose why I don’t believe these interactions are supernatural in origin, however are interesting nonetheless, I should also explain I saw Santa once.

One Christmas Eve Night, I saw him walk right by my door. He looked almost exactly like the Coca-Cola Santa, except he had mistletoe or a similar plant on his hat, and some leafy plant on his belt as well. I could hear his boots on the ground as he walked, he had a giant sack over his shoulder, and he had a gleam in his eyes. He was turned towards me as he passed. His finger was over his mouth as if he was shushing me. 

So, I think most rational adults are starting to understand what’s actually going on here, but I’ll continue with the experiences and you’ll be able to draw your own conclusions…

I occasionally encounter a being I call the patchwork man, or Patchwork. He is lanky, taller than me but usually hunched, so his height is hard to tell, his face featureless, limbs double jointed but rarely contorted, and most importantly, his skin looks like a quilt made of various patches of rotten flesh.

I first encountered this being while playing hide and seek with my siblings. I have a small room under our stairs. We would occasionally hide in there to scare one another. While searching for my sister, the last to be caught, I saw the door was cracked open, and so I opened it to catch her. Inside I saw the silhouette of the being I would later know to be Patchwork. He was covering his mouth, or at least where his mouth should be, as if trying to stifle a laugh. I thought it was my sister, but part of me was scared both of that dark room and of the presence I felt within it. I have horrible eyesight, I am actually blind, so I just held firm it was her and I was scaring myself, something I assumed she was counting on. I kept saying “I caught you.” And “I know it’s you, come out.” Until my sister revealed she was hiding behind the laundry door behind me, laughing at me for being stupid. At this moment I am in a total panic, slamming the room door shut and running out with my sister immediately tailing me, also in a frenzy.

I would later see him more clearly for only a few seconds when looking for my brother in his room. I opened the door only to see the Patchwork in there. In a panic I flipped it off and closed the door. I know this response is strange, some fight, flight, freeze, or fawn, but I usually go for utter confusion in instances of genuine terror.

I spotted it a few more times in passing, under similar circumstances.

One of the most real-feeling encounters was when I was asleep on my wrap around couch. My couch wraps around right at the corner of the wall it’s up against, leaving a gap between the couch corner and the wall corner. I woke up in the middle of the night, unable to move. I had been lucid dreaming since age twelve so I was already well aware of sleep-paralysis. But suddenly I began to panic, and then I saw it. I saw Patchwork crawl from behind the arm of the other side of the couch, onto the couch and make its way into the gap between the couch and wall. The second it left my sight, I was able to move again. I shot up instantly, I didn’t have to open my eyes, they were already open, which was one of the scariest aspects of this encounter.

I have seen various shadow entities under paralysis as well. Actual shadows of people on the wall. 3D human silhouettes that are just black. The Hat Man, something I was terrified to learn is commonly hallucinated. And then more distorted ones. A humanoid figure with long claws and writhing snake/worm like tendrils protruding from its head. Strange octopoids and insects, some of who whom I have later seen in more detail as fully realized creatures, as well as an encounter with a “mantis” like entity, which I will elaborate on.

I have experienced hallucinations in which the crack of my door will open, not as if my door is swinging open, but as if it’s sliding open from the bottom like a freight elevator. Almost every time this happens something bad makes its way towards me. Sometimes shadow figures, other times fully developed beings with definitive intentions, such as demented alien/deformed/mutant surgeons who perform surgery on me. I feel it while it happens and it is often painful. On one occasion, I remember a shadow figure stepping in, as I tried to focus on it there was a blinding light above me. I looked up and saw surgical lights over me. The figure stepped over me and blocked the lights. It had a texture that I don’t think I can properly describe because it’s not something you would see physically. It was basically tinted, like transparent, to where you can almost make out what was behind it, but it was still the deepest black, black as night. It began to materialize further, its skin was still black but simultaneously translucent, however it had an almost glossy sheen to it as well, like that a phone screen, or an insect like a wasp. Its head was also unmistakably insectoid, like that of an ant, but with numerous insect like legs sticking out of the side of its head. It felt as though it had numerous eyes, but they were hard to discern. The creature placed a cold instrument against me and I felt sheer panic. It chittered to itself, making a sound as if a beetle had been a chronic smoker its whole life. It then cracked my ribs open and removed a strange glowing, pulsating object from me, before waving its claw over me, causing me to pass out. This is also strange due to the fact that every other time something like this has happened I have remained mentally awake the entire time and have to calm my nerves before returning to sleep.

Sometimes otherworldly animals wonder through the same doorway, one notable example being the time an animal resembling a freshly skinned, demonic aardvark came in, same way as the others, through the door sliding open, and crawled on the wall around my bed to where it was behind me. It then started sniffing at my head from above me, just barely in view, however I could feel its wet snout. On one occasion, numerous smaller shadow demons with glowing red eyes spilled out of the light coming through the crack of my door, climbing on my walls and ceiling towards me.

I have seen strange, asymmetrical insects and octopoids, usually coming in colors of a brownish rotten flesh color, light blues, moldy greens and sometimes pink-red with the same texture as the skinless/inside-out animals.

Sometimes I see strange animals or shadow dogs out of the corner of my eye, or just feel their presence.

I used to have an irrational fear that something was under my bed, it just felt like there was a presence there. It got so bad that I removed my bed frame. Now I feel something moving under the mattress. 

In contrast, I occasionally feel my bed sink in, as if something is climbing onto my bed with me. 

So, what’s going on here? Am I a beacon for the other side? Probably not. I know people like to believe in the metaphysical, but there’s often little thought put into the legitimate mechanisms of how the metaphysical world actually functions. Like, what are spirits made of? The most scientific explanation I’ve ever heard in reference to the concept is that they are made of “energy.” No particular energy, just energy. It’s very underwhelming, and there’s no substantiating evidence to support the vast array of metaphysical claims, and believe me, I wish there was, because the alternative is far scarier to me.



Acute, episodic schizophrenia. 



I’ve had two therapists mention this to me without knowing about these experiences and I’m inclined to believe that their conclusions, coupled with these experiences, might be highly indicative of just that. I have never been diagnosed, so hopefully I’m jumping the gun there. Keen-eyed readers will notice there’s underlying themes in each encounter. I am typically asleep, or nearly asleep, and often in sleep paralysis. It’s common for some people, so that’s good to know it’s not something only people going insane experience. The other is that there’s often a feeling of anxiety associated with many of these sightings when I’m not in sleep-paralysis. So a combination of a tired mind and anxiety causes realistic horrifying hallucinations for me occasionally. That makes it easier to handle on paper, but in the moment…

It’s of no comfort. It doesn’t matter if it’s not real because it’s real to me. I have no control over when it happens and it startles me sometimes. Now, even though there are many examples listed, this is not an overly common occurrence. I am 27 and this is a lifetime’s worth of encounters.

I mentioned lucid dreaming earlier, and for a long time the escape it provided was worth the occasional nightmare event, but that last two years something has changed. 

When I become lucid in a dream it starts to become a nightmare, and the more I attempt to influence the dream, the worse it gets. Like now, if I try to fly in a dream I keep flying so high the ground turns into a map and then I’m above the clouds and then low-earth orbit and I realize I’m not breathing, or I am transported to an abandoned office building with grey walls and floors and untouched typewriters/computers on desks in cubicles and I’m just flying through breaking everything, or endless hallways, or an endless maze of a house with concrete base that’s still under construction so only wood framing is up, or I’m dragged through a murky brown lake, sometimes a combination of all in the same dream. I’ve experienced all those locations numerous times, and rarely in the dream do I have NPCs that interact with me. Usually they will either run away from me, or are shadow people just watching me. A few times I am chased by animals or people that look like they’ve been skinned or turned inside out but lack any discernible facial features. The last few times I’ve opted to fight them and there’s a sudden moment of absolute panic as I hit them that shocks me awake. Typically these dreams cause a great deal of anxiety, but I can’t control when I become lucid really, as I said, I have been lucid dreaming since I was 12 and the loss of control in the last 2-3 years is actually quite odd and discouraging. I rarely sleep at night anymore and typically opt to stay up until sun up before going to sleep, even then I experience regular bouts of insomnia, which lately has been making the feelings and subtle hallucinations return…

I do not believe in ghosts, but I do believe in memetic parasites. It is possible they are an aspect of consciousness mirrored in on itself feeding into itself which in turn makes it feel more impactful. It’s also possible they are conscious in their own regard, and that by causing strong emotions they are able to persist longer in their own regard back of one’s mind. The end result is the same, regardless, they persist due to the mental energy afforded to them. I also believe in memetic viruses. That is to say, these beings may be able to reproduce via word of mouth. Maybe, just by virtue of reading this story, I might have implanted their offspring in the back of your head. You may start seeing shadows in the corner of your eye. Feel yourself being watched. Experience night terrors. See what I see. There’s only one way to find out I guess…
