Everything started with a flyer.

“LOOKING FOR PARTICIPANTS: PAID SLEEP STUDY — $2,500 compensation. One overnight stay. No known sleep disorders. Call to apply.”

I was unemployed, behind on rent, living off microwave noodles and fear. Easy money just to sleep? Hell, I didn’t even read the fine print.

I showed up at the address, a medical-looking building off campus that smelled like disinfectant and quiet regret. A woman in scrubs greeted me. Too friendly. Too still. Her badge said “Dr. Ellery.”

She led me down long hallways lit with flickering fluorescents, into a small white room. One bed. One camera. Wires. Electrodes. Air so clean it felt dead.

“Lie down,” she said. “You’ll feel a little pinch. Then, sleep.”

That’s when everything started to go wrong.

I dreamed of a facility.

Not that facility. A different one. Bigger. Darker. Deeper. The walls weren’t white. They were a dull, fleshy pink. Something organic pulsed just beneath the surface, like muscle. Or membrane.

I walked barefoot down a hallway. The floor was warm. Other people were there too, some in hospital gowns, others in regular clothes. None of them spoke. They just stared straight ahead. Wide eyes. Open mouths.

A man in a lab coat walked up to me. His face moved too fast, flickering like an old film reel skipping frames. His voice sounded like static pushed through clenched teeth.

“Welcome to Level One.”

I woke up. Or at least, I thought I did.

The room looked the same. Same bed, same camera. But Dr. Ellery was different. Her smile was... wrong. Too wide. Like her skin had been stitched into place by someone who didn’t quite understand how faces were supposed to work.

“Did you sleep well?” she asked, tilting her head far too much. The angle was unnatural.

“I’m done. I want to leave.” I shot upright.

She blinked once. Then again. But this time, the eyelids moved sideways.

“You’re not finished yet,” she said.

\*\*\*

Every time I "woke up", I was in another layer. Each "room" felt a little less real than the last. The ceiling rippled like water. The walls breathed. In one version, the bed had veins. In another, the camera blinked at me, literally blinked, like an eye.

They told me I was making progress. That I was doing well.

“No subject has ever made it this far,” one of them said. His voice dripped like molasses slow, syrupy, wrong.

That’s when I realized: They weren’t studying how I slept. They were studying how I dreamed.

And I was sinking layer by layer, deeper into their world. That’s when I started seeing the others — the real ones.

People who’d also signed up for the sleep study. One girl, Sasha, told me she’d been there for weeks. Maybe months.

“They keep us dreaming,” she whispered. “They feed on the transitions. That flicker between sleep and waking. There’s energy in it.”

I asked how we could wake up. She laughed a horrible, empty sound, like something rattling in a dry throat.

“You can’t. Not unless you reach the bottom. But no one knows where that is.”

\*\*\*

One night, if you can even call it night here, I found a mirror. It was cracked. Blurry. But I saw my reflection. My skin was turning gray. My eyes sunken. Something was moving under the surface of my neck, twitching, like a worm squirming just beneath the flesh.

I screamed. The mirror rippled then showed me another version of myself. Smiling. Clean. Perfect. Behind her were the dream researchers. Their faces stretched like melting wax. Mouths open in silent howls.

I shattered the mirror. It bled. That’s when I started fighting back. Refusing to sleep inside the dream. Walking, endlessly, just to avoid the transitions.

They punished me. One level down, they took time away. No day. No night. Just a dull gray light pressing into my skull like a migraine that never ended. In another layer, I heard voices. My mother. My first girlfriend. My own voice. All whispering behind the walls.

They knew my memories. They knew my fears. And they used them. That level broke me.

I collapsed on the floor, sobbing. Whispered:

“Please... I just want to wake up.”

That’s when it happened. The Chief Investigator. He didn’t wear a lab coat. He wore my face. But not exactly,  just enough to feel wrong. The teeth were too long. The smile never moved. The eyes were glassy, blank, no pupils at all.

“You’re doing well,” he said, in my voice. “You’re getting close to Level Zero.”

“What’s Level Zero?” I croaked.

“Wake up,” he said. “If you survive.”

Then he touched my forehead. I screamed. I fell. Crashing through layers, like ice cracking beneath my feet. Flashes of rooms. Colors. Memories. My fifth birthday. My grandfather’s funeral. My first kiss. All of it peeling away, layer by layer, as if I was being stripped down to a raw, dreaming core.

And then—Silence.

Darkness. One word burned into my vision like static etched on a dead TV screen:

LEVEL ZERO

I opened my eyes. I was back. Back in the original unit. Bright lights. The real Dr. Ellery. My clothes neatly folded. A clipboard next to the bed.

“You’ve been under for seven hours,” she said, smiling gently. “How do you feel?”

I broke down in tears. Relief flooded through me like rain after a long, cracking drought. I grabbed her wrist.

“It was horrible,” I said. “I… I thought I was trapped.”

She handed me a cup of water. Said the brain can play strange tricks during sleep. Hypnagogia. Nested dreams. Lucid cycles.

“All perfectly normal.”

\*\*\*

I signed the forms. Took the check. Left that place as fast as I could. I ran all the way home.

That night, I tried not to sleep. Every time I shut my eyes I saw them. The researchers. My reflection. My own face, rotting.

I paced around my room. Drank coffee. Chewed my fingernails until they bled.

But eventually…I passed out.

And I woke up in a room I recognized.

A bed. A camera. A clipboard.

The door opened… and "Dr. Ellery" walked in. Only this time, she didn’t even bother wearing skin. Her face was a rotting mess of tentacles and teeth, eyes blinking like barnacles growing out of her skull. Her voice didn’t come from her mouth — it came from everywhere. From inside my ears. My teeth. My bones.

“You reached Level Zero,” she said. “But you never left.”

I screamed. Clawed at the walls. Tried to wake up. Tried to move. Tried to breathe.

Nothing changed. The room stayed still.

The clipboard now read:

Subject: Ethan Cross  
Sleep Study: Phase 3 – Simulated Awakening  
Response: Highly Compliant  
Status: Core Integrity Breached  
Extraction: Denied  
Retention: Indefinite

I wasn’t dreaming anymore. This was real. A reality they built. A prison made of belief. And the worst part?

Every time I think I’ve woken up… There’s another clipboard.

Just now, someone knocked at my apartment door. I answered. A man was standing there, breathless, holding a crumpled flyer.

“Hey,” he said. “Did you… do that sleep study thing?” His hands were shaking. “I can’t wake up.”

I smiled, my mouth opening wider than it should.

“Come in,” I said. “Let me tell you how it starts.”
