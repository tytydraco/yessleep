I started looking into the Coney Island mermaids because of the parade.
Every June, thousands of people dress up in seashell bras and fish tails and march down Surf Avenue, celebrating the fantasy of mermaids washing up on Brooklyn’s most famous shore. 
I’d grown up going to it. 
Everyone knows the joke: no real mermaids ever stayed in Coney Island. 
They “moved on,” people say. 

Or they never existed at all.

But there’s an old urban legend the local board walk dwellers whisper if you stay long enough after the rides shut down. 

That the mermaids were here. And that they didn’t leave.

They were used up.

I’m a freelance researcher, into historical oddities, forgotten scandals. By this I mean, I poke my nose where it doesn’t belong and don’t get paid for it. 

It was shortly after the parade in June when I started asking questions about its origins. 
That night after several interactions with parade goers, marchers, and locals my email blinked notifying me of a possible lead. 

It was a retired sideshow performer saying the Mermaid Day Parade was “a memorial whether people know it or not.” 

I thought it was a hokey poky email. 
Still, I followed the trail, it was the only thing I’d gotten in my inbox besides promotional offers for local attractions and spam mail. 

The first thing you learn about early Coney Island is that it was never subtle.

At the turn of the 20th century, it was the most electric, chaotic place in Eastern America. Luna Park glittered with a million lights. 
Freak shows lined the boardwalk, educational exhibits, they called them where human beings were displayed like curiosities. 
Bearded women, Little people, “Primitive races.” 
Things that modern audiences would deem ( and rightfully so ) inhumane, but it was seen as entertainment & educational then. 

Respectable as long as you paid admission.

What surprised me was how often aquatic exhibits came up in the archives.

Old posters advertised 

“Living Mermaids of the Atlantic!” 

alongside seal acts and diving horses. 
I assumed they were hoaxes women sewn into fish tails, Barnum-esque trickery. 

But the descriptions didn’t match. They mentioned saltwater tanks, medical staff on hand, feeding schedules.

And injuries. 
Lots of injuries. 

I found a ledger from 1907 in the Brooklyn Historical Society that listed “maintenance losses” for a sideshow aquarium. 
One line item simply read: 
“tail rot. unrecoverable.”

That’s when I stopped thinking this was kitsch, and started to believe. 

The real break came from the Dreamland Fire.
In 1911, Dreamland burned to the ground in a single night. Thousands of animals died. Performers fled into the dark, half-costumed. It’s one of the most photographed disasters of the era. I went through every image I could find.

In the background of one photograph just barely noticeable, there’s a tank being wheeled toward the beach by four men. Something long and pale spills over the edge. 

Too long and too heavy looking to be fabric.
The caption just says: 
“salvage.”

After emailing the former performer back and asking for some more information, they sent me back a list of names of former Coney Island employees, carnies, and performers from around that time. That’s the best they could do, they said. 

They told me this was something their grandfather talked about lot about, and they never gave it much thought until working on the board walk. 

They didn’t want to meet in person and told me to keep their name out of any retellings, they liked their quiet life by the beach and didn’t want any problems. 

I tracked down a descendant of a man who worked concessions on the boardwalk before World War I. He had boxes of letters in his basement. 
One of them mentioned “the fish girls” being moved after the fire, “before the inspectors come.”

“They ain’t girls,” the letter said. 
“Girls don’t scream when you take them out of water.”

That was the first time I felt sick.

Here’s the part no one likes to hear about Coney Island:

The freak show fish girls weren’t just entertainment. 

They were supply chains.

The mermaids, hybrids, sea creatures whatever they were, were never meant to be seen for long. They were advertised as rare, fragile creatures, and audiences were told they might disappear at any time. 
That was true. 

Just not for magical fairy tale reasons.
Medical journals from the 1910s talk about an unexplained influx of “marine protein” being studied by doctors attached to Luna Park. Restaurants on the boardwalk proudly served mermaid stew and Neptune cutlets. It was a joke, a novelty. Everyone knew it wasn’t real mermaid.

Except it was.

A former butcher’s ledger lists deliveries from “S.S. Siren,” docked off Gravesend Bay, marked simply as 
“long pork: salted.”

Another euphemism. 

Another lie everyone agreed not to examine too closely.

They were eating the tails.

They couldn’t, right?

The tails were too fibrous, too dense, too full of cartilage and bone, right?

Wrong. 

The mermaids were filleted and broken down into portions small enough that no one had to think too hard about what they were eating. 

I finally found proof in a place I didn’t expect: the Mermaid Day Parade archives themselves.
The parade started in the 1980s, meant to reclaim the strange, lost magic of Coney Island. 

Early organizers talked about honoring “those who belonged to the sea but were taken by the shore.” 
I thought it was metaphor.
Then I found a box of rejected costume designs.

One sketch showed a mermaid with scars at the waist. Another had a tag written in shaky handwriting: 
“No chains. Be respectful.”

The note attached chilled me more than anything else I’d read.

“We dress up so they don’t have to anymore.”

The final piece came from a closed restaurant at the far end of the boardwalk, shuttered since the 1970s. 

I snuck in to look inside, it wasn’t hard. Nobody cared about the forgotten buildings on the boardwalk. 

I trekked the building with no real direction. I was looking for what used to be the kitchen. All the rooms were grey and stripped bare. But, that’s when I found it. 

A staircase leading to the sub floor of the building. 

I didn’t even know that it had a sub floor. 

I found a few big restaurant grade ice boxes. A few of them were open, empty. 

But a few were chained shut. 

After smashing the rusted lock, I saw bones. 

They weren’t fish.

They weren’t human either.

The pelvis was wrong. 
The spine extended too far, too flexible. And the ribs. 
God…the ribs curved inward like something built to compress under water pressure.

On the wall above the ice boxes, scratched into yellowed tile, were the words:
WE CRIED OUT THEY CALLED IT MUSIC

That’s why you don’t find mermaids in Coney Island anymore.

They didn’t vanish.

They were exhibited, studied, carved up, and served with lemon wedges while people laughed at the joke. 

By the time anyone thought to protect them, there were too few left and the ocean had learned not to give us anything that could scream.

The Mermaid Parade isn’t a celebration.
It’s an apology.

And if you go this year, listen closely when the drums stop and the crowd quiets near the water.

Sometimes, just under the surf, something sings back.

Not to entertain you, but to remind you. 
If something surfaces just long enough for you to mistake it for driftwood or shadow, don’t get closer for a better look.

Coney Island already took everything it was offered.

Next time, the ocean won’t be offering anything, it’ll be collecting.  
Because they’re hungry now.
