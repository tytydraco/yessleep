Chaper One - The thing in the woods 

Frankie and michael are sitting on the roof of a seemingly ran down hotel. 
Both are just staring in the distance admiring the sun set. Michael peirces the silence asking "so what have you been up to, its been a while." Frankie exhales smoke before stating "nothing much man just trying to stay alive, its hard nowadays" michael follows up "what about astrid is she okay?" frankie exhales "honestly man im starting to worry about her mental health, i couldnt imagine being stuck in a shitty house my entire childhood." 

michael sits in silence trying to figure out what to say. Frankie interupts his thoughts "hey" pointing out in the ditance tworads a run down train station. "you remember when we used to go spraypaint on that trained that crashed in 97?"  michael exclaims "oh my god i forgot about that, i wonder if our drawings are still there...  remember the" frankie shoves her hand over his mouth and ducks down.

 she whispers "shhhh, i see N.A.Ps" she uncovers his mouth and they watch as two muscular men with the letters NAP printed in bold letters on the back of their jackets approach an apartment door. They bang loudly on the door until a woman cracks the door only revealing her head. inaudible chatter ensues until the N.A.Ps appear to get frusterated and force themselves inside. 

Frankie and michael then hear muffled wrestling and screaming until the N.A.Ps emerge from the appartment laughing while dragging a man and shoving him into their van. they then hear the woman screaming histerically begging god to keep her son safe. the two of them sat in silence knowing that she will never see her son again.

 Michael breaks the silence "hey i know that we arent supposed to leave living quarters but weve already broken that rule coming out here tonight. you wanna go see if we can find one of the dicks we drew on that train down there?" frankie laughs "that does sound fun but idk what if we run into a waygaurd or something. plus astrids alone i dont want to leave her waiting to long" 

michael insist "come on dude we will be there and back in 30 minutes, i know a way to take. and N.A.Ps havent came to this hotel in months im sure astrid will be okay." Frankie hesitates "okay fine but i have to go check on her and grab a few things meet me at the dumpsters around back." michael exclaims "yes! okay il see you soon" michael stand up and climbs down the fire escape latter ducking into a window below.

 Frankie puffs on her joint a few more times before doing the same. walking through the dark hallway an elderly woman pokes her head out of her door "frankie what are you doing out here?" 

noticing it was one of her moms old friends she says "i just had to step outside to get some fresh air" the woman exclaims "get back to your room, and be safe" going back into her room. Frankie approaches her room and unlocks the door.

 "Frankie!" she hear from another room. she approaches the room "hey kiddo what are you doing?" astrid explains "im drawing us and mommy and daddy" frankie responds "thats cool let me see" she peers down at drawing of their entire family standing side by side. she notices something. "whats that on daddys neck?" she asked concerned. 

astrid responded "thats the rope that killed him" frankie hugs astrid tight and says "lets not draw that part again, okay kiddo?" astrid agrees "okay, i wont" frankie says "i just came back to pick up some things, im going to go do something really fast. will you be okay alone for a few more minutes?" 

Astrid reluctently says "yes but please dont take to long".  frankie opens a dresser drawer grabbing a flashlight. she says "okay im leaving. what do we do if someone knocks?" Astrid says "we turn the lights off and hide under the bed". Frankie responds "thats right. i love you, be back soon. 

She makes her way to the back exit and emerges to a dark ally. michael jumps out from behind a dumpster and grabs her. "ha gotcha" frankie says angrily "dont do that stupid shit, you almost gave me a heart attack. lets go" 

michael leads the way as they stumble down a hill emerging onto an old dirt road and begin walking. Frankid interupts the sound of their footsteps "Hey i dont wanna bring the mood down but Astrid is starting to scare me." michael ask "why is that?" "well she drew us dad and mom, but she drew a noose around dads neck"  

she says in a concerning tone.  michael follows up "i wouldnt think too much of it. its probably just a coping mechanism. i mean she was the one that found him." frankie sighs "youre right, i just hope shes okay". 

michael says "i did the same thing when my mom died and look how i turned out. haha" Frankie responds with sass "yeah a drug addict risking his life to see a dick". michael laughs "oh shutup you know what i mean". the approach a old train track and in the distance a crashed train surrounded in trenches it created. 

"there she is" michael says. "she is indeed" frankie responds "come on" she runs twords the train carts and begins examining them. "come help me find one of those dicks"  

they look around for a few minutes until they hear a deep voice yell "HEY" Frankie looks over and yells "Waygaurd!, RUN" they both run into nearby woods and eventally stop to catch their breath. michael says in a trembling voice "do you think they seen our faces? 

oh god we're fucked, we're fucked" Frankie says annoyed "Shut up and le-" shes interupted by a loud explosion. "What was that, are they shooting at us?" frankie ask. michael already yards ahead yells "i dont know but im not finding out!" 

frankie runs behind him "wait for me" out of nowhere a large creature jumps out of the bushes and tackles michael, just out of sight of frankie. she stops in her tracks "michael?" she says in a trembling voice as she slowly approaches. 

she hears a guteral gargling noise along with what sounds like bones cracking. out of the bushes appears a mangled man with his spine patruding, empty looking eyes, and mangled arms crawling on all fours. 

she takes off running back twords the train station. when she gets back she finds a waygaurd brutally murdered. she hears the creature still darting twords the scrubs twords her and notices the waygaurds shotgun sitting beside him. she picks it up and checks it for ammo.

 she has one shot. "come get me motherfucker" she whispers to herself as she prepares to shoot the creature. she hears footsteps on the top of the train before it jumps off and begins to run at her. she screams and closes her eyes as she takes the shot. 

a moment of silence ensues before she opens her eyes. its laying on the ground twitching. she waste no time investigating and makes her way to her apartment. she runs through the street making her way through crowds of screaming people, running and getting brutally murdered by creatures frankie could never imagine existing.

 she gets to her motel and it is dead silent. she rushes up the stairs to her apartment and sees that her door is wide open, the hinges busted off and laying on the ground. "astrid?"

 she creeps into the apartment hearing a wet thumping sound from the other room. as she peeks around the corner shes met with the image of a bloody room, her sister sitting on top of a dead N.A.P repeatedly stabbing him him the chest with a kitchen knife. "she says in a broken voice "oh baby, im so sorry, im sorry" as she pulls her off of the man
