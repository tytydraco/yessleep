As the abominations skittered close to us, I saw Stephanie grab a black key she kept hanging around her neck on a silver chain. The pendant looked ancient like some sort of key to a medieval dungeon. But it had no sign of rust anywhere on it. It shone like jet-stone, glossy and smooth. She let it drop back under her shirt where it disappeared. It looked like it had some strange occult symbol on it, almost like a 7. For a moment, I wondered if Stephanie was into witchcraft.   
  
The flying scorpions descended on the soldiers like dive bombers. They had dark, spiky tendrils flowing back from their heads with wicked barbs at the end. Their faces looked like those of hairless, mutated children. Their eyes looked faded, the pupil hiding underneath the milky film like some leviathan swimming under the ocean.  
  
Agent Garland sprinted towards a machine set up on a folding table nearby, in the middle of other military hardware. It looked like some sleek, futuristic sewing machine with handheld speaker sets connected to it by wires. He frantically started screaming into one of the speakers.  
  
“We need back-up immediately!” Agent Garland shrieked over the sound of gunfire. I saw three of the scorpions swoop down on a soldier in camouflage pants and a kevlar vest. The soldier raised his gun, blowing the face apart on the nearest abomination. Sapphire blood streamed from the destroyed mass of tissue that was its head. Clear venom continued to stream from its stinger as it crashed to the floor, rolling on its back and twitching like a dying hornet, its tail still whipping crazily in all directions.   
  
But the other two scorpions dodged the bullets, their dragonfly wings beating the air hard. They fell straight down on top of the soldier. One wrapped its tail around him, while the other used its stinger to inject venom straight into his back. The man twisted, his mouth an O of terror and agony. He dropped his gun, his eyes fluttering. Within a fraction of a second, his body began to swell and change colors.  
  
As they flew back down the tunnel they had come from with their new meal, the soldier used the last of his energy to reach down into his belt. He grabbed an M67 fragmentation grenade and pulled the pin. I also saw he had more on his belt that would undoubtedly detonate during the explosion. The scorpions were only about fifty feet away with soldiers scattered all over the massive cavern, firing and screaming and dying together.  
  
“Everyone down!” I shrieked, backpedaling away from the struggle. “Grenade!” Agent Garland looked up suddenly as the cave erupted into a fireball. A roaring filled my ears. I felt fire lick my skin and smelled burning hair. People started screaming all around me. Shards of rock and dust started falling all around us. I felt one smash into my head. Stunned, I reached up and touched my forehead, pulling my fingers back and seeing them covered in crimson streaks.  
  
I looked back the way we had come. More scorpion creatures flew towards us. I grabbed Stephanie’s hand and shouted over the cacophony of gunfire and screaming.  
  
“We need to run forward!” I shouted. “Where’s Bear?” She looked around frantically. I saw Bear running over to Agent Garland, pulling him up to his feet as one of the burnt conglomerations skittered towards them. Bear spun, raising his .45 and firing. One of the creature’s heads exploded in a shower of blackened skin and bone splinters. The rocks in the cave gave a tortured groan as the cave started collapsing around us faster and faster. The cave had filled up with thick, choking smoke. The smell of blood, death and gunsmoke hung heavy all around us.  
  
“Bear!” I shouted, pulling Stephanie forward. He looked up, his eyes wild. “Come on! Time to go!” I motioned forward with my head. The way was still blocked by more conglomerations and flying scorpion creatures. The soldiers kept firing, mowing down those in front. The scorpions landed hard on the dirt-strewn stone ground, sliding as their legs kicked and their stingers twisted and smashed against the walls and floor.  
  
The conglomerations reached us in a sickening wave of limbs and mutilated flesh. They ran forwards like tanks, crushing the dying soldiers and writhing scorpion creatures under their heavy, stomping feet. Their sightless eyes continued to roll, their mouths drooling and moaning like coma patients as their long, twisting arms reached out, grabbing any people they could find and snapping their necks. They threw the twitching bodies onto the floor like pieces of garbage.  
  
Agent Garland still stood next to the mass of now-destroyed military hardware, looking stunned. Bear grabbed his arm and pulled him forward. We tried to skitter around the conglomerations. I saw that, beyond this wave, the way forward looked clear.  
  
With the cries of dying, agonized soldiers following us, we left that cavern of horrors. I looked back and saw no one living. Now only the conglomerations stood, nightmarish masses of flesh, victors over the broken corpses of the living.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
We had nearly reached the center of the bottomless pit by this point. Far off in the distance, I saw light streaming through the tunnels like a second sun. For a long moment, my eyes hurt.  
  
I heard more cries, more fighting and shouting, but this time the voices didn’t seem human. The cavern opened up in front of us. I saw clouds of silver floating hundreds of feet above our heads. Diamonds and opals embedded into the walls sparkled and shimmered as our lights ran over them.  
  
Agent Garland started to come out of his stupor after an hour or so of walking. The cave seemed to play strange tricks with sounds. I thought I would hear fighting nearby, demonic shrieking in thousands of tongues and angelic humming, but I would find only more empty space.  
  
“We’re almost at the end,” Bear said, walking next to Agent Garland. “Why don’t you tell us what’s really happening? I know you haven’t been totally truthful. How are you guys involved in stopping the Apocalypse, and what’s really going on?”  
  
“There are many gods and many universes,” Agent Garland began introspectively. “In fact, a likely infinite number of both. We’ve found ways to see into the other universes with some… unique technology.   
  
“Each universe has its own creator god. In some of them, the gods are well and healthy, and the people live forever, feeding on bliss and light and music in towers of gold and silver. In these Heaven worlds, tides roll over purple-streaked majestic mountains, and the sky itself sings with joy. Cancer, aging, addiction and many other evils do not exist there. The beings do not have a concept of aging. Like the angels here, they came into consciousness fully formed at the alpha point, and until the omega comes, they will physically remain the same age.  
  
“But sadly, in our universe, the creator god could not deal with the stress of exploding all things into existence. It shattered his mind. That’s why our world has so much suffering and death, so much war and oppression. It always has and always will, because the foundation itself is rotten.  
  
“There are also universes that are far worse than ours, where their creator gods became even more sick and evil at the moment of their Big Bangs. The trauma of those shattered minds rippled across spacetime and created Hell worlds- worlds where beings exist in incomprehensible agony and torture. There, the beings get burned alive, sliced into pieces, dunked into boiling lead or have molten steel poured down their throats. Yet every time they die, their bodies miraculously heal. They come back to life to start the torment again.  
  
“In universes like ours where God wants to destroy himself, he comes into being surrounded by angels. The angels may be part of his own mind, the will to live. They try to keep whatever essential pieces are still alive imprisoned forever, so that the universe will not end.  
  
“Likewise, there are demons. These may also be part of God’s mind. They come into existence at the beginning with him. They are, I believe, his death drive, his desire for annihilation.  
  
“There are occult sites located across the Earth. Believe it or not, some people worship Abaddon and his demons. They want to start the Apocalypse. They believe that, when the universe ends, they will become powerful, god-like beings in Abaddon’s new world. These cultists find extremely powerful objects and come here to bring them to Abaddon. I don’t know if you’ve ever read the Book of Revelation…”  
  
“We have one right here!” Bear said excitedly, absolutely enthralled with the conversation. Stephanie had a stony look on her face as Bear went into her backpack and retrieved the Bible. He gave it to Agent Garland. He opened back up to Revelation 9 and read aloud.  
  
“And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit,” he read. We had all stopped around him. My eyes widened as he read the words. Something flashed like lightning in my mind.   
  
I looked over at Stephanie. She grinned, a psychopath, reptilian grin that made my heart turn to ice. A memory came to me then. Stephanie had been the one who had wanted us to go to Death Valley in the first place. She was the one who had subtly guided us towards the bottomless pit.  
  
“So the key,” Agent Garland continued saying, oblivious to the danger, “was a black artifact that came to Earth in an asteroid. Somehow, the cult members recovered it after spending millions of dollars and countless years searching. Our agency got a tip-off that a cult member was trying to get the key to Abaddon, so that he could unlock the divine chains.”  
  
“Stephanie,” I hissed. Everyone looked at me, Stephanie with amusement and bloodlust, Bear and Agent Garland in confusion. “She has the key. She is the cult member. She must have led us here on purpose!” Bear spun, starting to raise his gun, but Stephanie had already seen it and stepped forward. With a lunatic cry, she stabbed Bear in the neck. His gun went off, the shot smashing through the silver clouds high above us as he fell back, dying. He choked on his own blood as Agent Garland went for the pistol holstered on his camouflage pants.  
  
There was a demonic roar directly behind us. We both twisted our heads, seeing the body of something red, massive and hellish. It towered high above us, forty or fifty feet tall. It had thick legs like a tree trunk. Its feet looked like those of some enormous rhinoceros. Looking up at its stomach, I saw the crimson flesh ragged and only connecting in strips. Behind it, I saw a pulsing, dark mass of black blood and organs.  
  
“I am Abaddon,” the creature roared in a voice like a cannon firing. My body froze as ice water ran through my veins. Agent Garland’s mouth hung open. He looked from Stephanie to Abaddon. Stephanie kept her eyes lowered. No one was looking at his face.  
  
Stephanie bowed in front of the nightmarish figure standing there. Two dark, reptilian wings stretched out from behind his back. I caught a glimpse of some monstrous crown on his head, three sharp, silver spikes rising dozens of feet above him.  
  
“Abaddon,” she said, kneeling. “I come as your faithful servant. I have brought…” Agent Garland jumped forward, putting the gun to Stephanie’s head. Just as he was about to fire, a long, twisted hand came down and crushed him. His body exploded in a shower of gore and spattering blood. It soaked my face and chest. I felt a silent scream welling up in my throat. But the adrenaline coursing through my body sent me into action.  
  
I ran forward, jerking Stephanie’s head up so that she was looking straight at Abaddon’s head. I used my other hand to keep her eyelid pried open. She began to shriek, her body growing hot under my skin. It felt like she was burning alive from the inside. Her face began to drip and melt like candle wax, the flesh falling off in strips. Her scream grew deep and harsh. Slowly, it started to fade.  
  
I looked down, seeing a skeleton in my hands. A skeleton with clothes on and a sacred key. I grabbed the key. I saw it had a sharp, dagger-like point at the end.  
  
Abaddon started to shriek with fury, his demonic voice shaking the stones. From further down in the tunnel, dozens of angels streamed forward, their deafening battle-cries reverberating around the cavern. In front of them, I saw the Angel of Death, her face towards me as she smiled.  
  
Abaddon looked at the large army approaching and fled down the cavern, his heavy footsteps shaking the floor. The angels followed, some of them flying forwards and stabbing him in the back and legs. Within minutes, I found myself alone with the corpses of my friends.  
  
I started walking forward toward the tower of light in front of me. The Angel of Death had told me how to get out, after all.  
  
“The only way out is further in.”  
  
\*\*\*  
  
With the key securely placed around my neck, I crossed a bridge made of fine threads of silver and gold. All around the bridge, a blinding effulgence rained down on me. Behind it, I saw trillions of eyes flicking around madly. They surrounded me on all sides, radiating light, their pupils dilated and wild. From everywhere and nowhere, a voice began to speak, shaking me to the core.  
  
“I AM THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGA, THE FIRST AND THE LAST. I AM THE FOUNTAIN OF LIFE.” God’s voice rang out like thunder. It wasn’t a human voice but instead had a strange, metallic ringing behind it. It roared and echoed around me with a sound like rushing water. I stood silent, staring into the foundation of existence itself. I saw human eyes, bird eyes, goat eyes, snake eyes, and many others not of this world. Some eyes just radiated light, glowing like headlights in the abyss.  
  
“WHY HAVE YOU COME BEFORE US?” the voice boomed with a sound like a nuclear bomb detonating.   
  
“I got tricked into coming down here by a follower of Abaddon, an evil person who wanted to start the Apocalypse,” I said. The trillion eyes regarded me coldly. “I just want to go home.”  
  
“ABADDON IS, INDEED, GREAT. I WAS ONCE LIKE ABADDON MYSELF IN MY LAST LIFE. I SCHEMED AND KILLED AND MANIPULATED, UNTIL I RELEASED THE FIRST ONE WITH A TRILLION EYES TO DESTROY THE UNIVERSE.   
  
“IT DID, AND WHEN EXISTENCE TOPPLED, I WAS PULLED INTO THE PIT. I SPENT ENDLESS YEARS ALONE, SLOWLY GOING INSANE. FINALLY, I DECIDED TO FORM SOME OF MY ETERNAL SOUL INTO ALL THINGS AND CREATE THIS UNIVERSE. I MADE THE SAME MISTAKES AS THE ONE WITH A TRILLION EYES BEFORE ME, AND NOW THE CLEANSING MUST COME. WHEN THE CLEANSING IS OVER, ALL BEINGS WILL JOIN ME IN AN ETERNAL, DREAMLESS SLEEP.”  
  
“You deserve to be imprisoned,” I spat at the infinite thing. Its eyes seemed to flash faster, rotating all around me like endless stars. “You don’t even try to make the universe a better place. You just want everything to end so that you can wash your hands of all of it.”  
  
“YOU DO NOT SEE. YOU ARE NOT WORTHY TO BE IN MY PRESENCE. YOU ARE A BUG, A SICKLY, DYING THING, A MISTAKE THAT CAME FROM OUR VERY ESSENCE.   
  
“ALL OF YOUR KIND ARE WORTHLESS BUGS. FROM US YOU HAVE COME, TO US YOU WILL RETURN.” I stared up into the infinite spirals of lidless, staring eyes. They undulated and twisted.    
  
“Why did you create the universe if you hate us so much?” I asked. “Why create the Earth at all?” The voice that came from nowhere and everywhere went silent for a long moment.  
  
“AFTER SPENDING ETERNITY ALONE IN THE DARKNESS, I FELL INTO A DREAM. THE DREAM TOOK EVERYTHING STRONG IN ME. NOW I AM A SHELL. I WILL BE THE LAST TO DIE, BUT ONCE ALL CREATURES HERE HAVE DIED, I CAN SLIP INTO THE FORMLESS.   
  
“FOR MY CONSCIOUSNESS IS IN YOU, AND I CANNOT SLEEP UNTIL THE TIME OF THE CLEANSING HAS ENDED.”  
  
\*\*\*  
  
I reached the end of the bridge of gold and silver. The blinding sun stood overhead. I looked around, finding myself back in Death Valley.  
  
I stood next to the car, but the pit was gone. I reached into my pocket for the keys, feeling the weight of the pendant against my chest.  
  
I decided to drive to the Pacific Ocean, thinking of Bear and Stephanie the whole way. In the end, I threw the black key deep in the water.  
  
And I hope no one will ever find it again.
