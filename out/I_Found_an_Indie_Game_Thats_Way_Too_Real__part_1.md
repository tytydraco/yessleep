I’m not usually the type to post here, but something’s been gnawing at me, and I need a second opinion. It started a couple of weeks ago when I stumbled on this obscure indie game called **Blood Detective**. I’m a sucker for anything dark and gritty, so I figured I’d give it a shot. The game’s premise is simple: you’re a detective solving a series of murders in a fictional city.

But here’s the thing—one of the murders in the game feels... too familiar.

There’s a case I read about years ago. A guy was found dead in an abandoned house, staged like he was sitting at a dinner party. The killer had dressed him in a tuxedo, set the table with rotting food, and even lit candles. It was sick, but what really stood out to me was a random detail: the victim had a rose sewn into his chest.

Guess what’s in the game? The same exact setup.

I thought it was just a weird coincidence. Indie devs pull inspiration from real life all the time, right? But then I noticed something else. The game gave an address for the crime scene—a random house in its fictional world. For fun, I plugged the address into Google Maps. The real-world location is an actual abandoned house. And it looks *exactly* like the one in the game.

At this point, I should’ve walked away. Instead, I dug deeper.

I started cross-referencing other murders in the game with real-world cases. Two more matched. Different locations, different victims, but the details in the game were spot on. Right down to stuff that wasn’t made public, like how one victim was missing a tooth or how another had a specific tattoo.

I know how crazy this sounds, but I can’t shake the feeling that whoever made this game knows more than they should.

I’ve been combing through forums and old case files, trying to figure out where the dev got their info. I’ve even been poking around in the game’s files—nothing illegal yet, just some harmless snooping. The deeper I go, the worse it gets.

Here’s the kicker: last night, I got a notification that the game updated. A new chapter dropped, with another murder to solve. The opening screen? A map zooming in on my town.

I couldn’t resist checking out the new chapter. I loaded it up, fully expecting the usual eerie vibes. Instead, the game dropped me straight into a map screen—only this time, it wasn’t the fictional city anymore. It was a pixelated version of my actual town.

At first, I thought I was imagining things. The street names were slightly different, but the layout? Perfect match. My apartment building was even on there.

I started exploring, clicking through the map. The game let me zoom in on houses, including *mine*. That’s when I noticed something that nearly made me shut the whole thing down. My building was marked with a red X.

Naturally, I panicked. I tried to rationalize it—maybe this was a coincidence, maybe the devs pulled real-world data for the game’s map system. But then the game’s detective character popped up, pixelated and silent, and walked straight into my building.

The screen went black for a moment. When it loaded again, the detective was inside an apartment. It was *my apartment*.

I’m not exaggerating. The details were spot on—the crappy beige walls, the mismatched furniture, even the stack of empty coffee mugs on my desk. I don’t know how the devs did it, but they recreated my living space down to the last detail.

Then, the detective walked into my bedroom. I could feel my heart pounding as the screen showed my bed, unmade like I’d left it. On the nightstand was a single rose.

That’s when the game threw up a dialogue box. One line: *"Are you ready to play?"*

I slammed my laptop shut and sat there in silence for a good five minutes. I haven’t opened the game since, but I feel like I’m being watched. My blinds are closed, my phone’s camera is taped over, and I’ve started sleeping with a bat under my bed.

Here’s the thing, though. The rational part of my brain is telling me this has to be a sick prank—some genius dev who found my info online and decided to mess with me. But the rest of me? It’s screaming that there’s more to this.

I’ve been digging into the game files again, but they’re encrypted to hell. I found what looks like a user ID in the metadata, though. If I can crack it, I might be able to trace it back to the creator.
