As the end of November loomed, Nick and I were trying to figure out where to go next. Allie and her kind had turned to something we could barely comprehend. It was hard to wrap our heads around, but we’d agreed – we would deal with this one last thing, and then we were heading to Dallas.

Nick had this idea to trace her steps. Allie was a predator – more creature than person. She’d hunted something down and feasted on them. As Nick so eloquently put it;

“There’s gotta be a bunch of bones laying around.”

 

Not in a physical sense, but a metaphorical one. Meaning there had to be traces. While we’d chased after her, she’d been busy hunting prey and feasting on them. And at some point, something clicked – turning her into whatever she’d become. A strange sort of quasi-human, unraveling at the seams. You could tell just by her face.

It wasn’t all that hard to get a few crumbs to follow. Charlie on dispatch told us there’d been reports of highway assaults, and there were a few more missing people being reported than usual. That had to mean something.

Sifting through a handful of cases, one stood out. It was an older one, but it caught my attention.

 

There was a case talking about an obsessive woman named ‘Marielle’ who’d been missing for a long time. Apparently, there’d recently been a ping on that case; someone had recognized her at a supermarket down in Mankato. I’d felt the pull of Allie a couple of times, going south. This Marielle had a couple of strange mentions in her file. For example, how she was obsessed with a particular phrase, and a word – ‘Blameless’.

While it was impossible to confirm, my working theory was that Allie had gotten to her and consumed her. This somehow created an amalgamation of the two, perhaps giving Allie the clarity of mind she needed to overcome her feral state. It would explain a couple of things.

Then there was that book. The Diary of Emmett Rask. That seemed important.

 

For all I could find about this, nothing was substantial. Rask was prolific, but strange. He wrote poems, children’s books, a couple of short stories; but his diary? That was, seemingly, an urban legend. The working theory was that Rask and his identity theory touched on the idea that you can ascribe a person’s essence into words that, when read, could be translated and transcribed onto the very being of another.

Perhaps somewhere in that picture of his life, there was a vast bank of knowledge about worlds that never were, or places that couldn’t be. Maybe he knew more than he lead on. There was no way to tell, but that would explain why Allie got hold of it. But that was another bone buried somewhere. If she had it, that meant someone else *didn’t* have it.

If Allie could wrest something like that away from someone, she’d have made a powerful enemy. Maybe an enemy powerful enough for us to make use of them.

That could work.

 

We didn’t know a lot of people who might have any kind of insight into this type of thing, but there was always Evan. Problem was, Evan hadn’t been around for some time, and he was a pain in the ass to track down. He always seemed to appear when he had to, somehow. But you can’t just wish upon a star and hope for the best.

Nick and I took a drive out to Evan’s place in early December. The place looked abandoned, but what else could we do? There was no car there, no obvious signs of movement. Nick was enjoying a gas station hot dog as I stood outside the house, calling out at the top of my lungs. Returning to the car, I leaned against the hood with a shrug.

“Got any other ideas?” Nick asked.

“We gotta make more noise,” I said. “I don’t know how good his hearing is.”

“Who says he has hearing?” Nick scoffed. “Maybe it’s like a thousand little tongues vibrating on the back of his neck or something.”

“I’m gonna ignore that.”

Nick shrugged and picked up his hunting rifle, firing a shot into the air. It rung out across the forest, scaring off a flock of birds.

“That oughta get his attention.”

 

As predicted, it didn’t take that long for Evan to show up. Not from the house though. There was just a sudden shade looming over us, then he was standing behind our car. Good thing he wasn’t there to rip our throats out, or he’d have a field day. It was easy to forget how unpredictable a creature like Evan can be.

The large figure was still covered in his makeshift poncho-pile of blankets and debris, reminding me of a trash island. He said nothing as we turned to him.

“We got a problem,” I said. “And we need your help.”

He tilted his head to show that he was listening.

 

Nick and I took turns explaining the situation with Allie. Her efforts to break something fundamental, and her acquiring of this unusual diary. I tried to explain how bad it was about to get.

“This could hurt a lot of people,” I said. “Maybe all of us.”

“…*yes*,” Evan agreed.

“Maybe you could help us then,” I said. “Take her down.”

He shook his head.

“…*no*,” he said. “…*I got a friend in need*.”

“And that’s so important that you’re ready to risk all of this?” Nick chimed in. “Knowing how bad it can get?”

Evan nodded. Apparently, something was just more important to him.

 

We didn’t leave empty handed though. Evan had an idea of who might’ve had a copy of the diary of Emmett Rask, but he wasn’t sure about sharing that information. He was afraid we might do something “rash and unpredictable” if not properly supervised. While I couldn’t guarantee anything, I promised we’d do our best to keep it civilized.

And with that, he handed us a business card. A simple plain black laminated card with white text on it. ‘Gepetto’. Just to show that it was from him, he drew a symbol on the back with a silvery marker pen.

And with that, we had a new target.

 

‘Gepetto’ was an entrance code to an underground club up in Minneapolis. According to Evan, the owner had an unusual contact that, in turn, owned a copy of the book. It was all a bit wishy-washy, but at least we had an address. It was a lead, if anything.

The following weekend, Nick and I drove up there. We discussed “clubwear” all the way there, and how neither of us had just kicked back for the past year. Then again, we weren’t really club people. Not that we were too old – you just get a feel for these things over the years. Especially as a cop.

 

By Saturday evening, Nick and I were standing outside a club called ‘Puppets’. It was on a busy off-street with a crowd that was either too drunk to keep going, or too sober to think a place like that was a good idea; meaning the only people inside were regulars and misguided tourists.

Add to that, the place was a creepshow. They had these weird white plastic dolls in one of the windows. Nick leaned over to whisper as he saw them.

“I’m not sure why,” he said. “But I hate those things.”

 

Showing the black card to the bouncer, we were ushered inside.

“Don’t we need a stamp or something?” Nick asked.

“Inside,” the bouncer huffed.

Stepping inside, my jaw dropped.

 

Close to 50 people, all dancing to this intense rave music – all wearing white masks.

We’d seen those masks before. I’d seen them too close for comfort. There was no way in hell I was wearing one.

An attendant approached us, and I just waved the ‘Gepetto’ card at her, declining the mask. Nick did the same, but let me carry the conversation. She took a long look at the card and the symbol Evan had drawn. She looked up at us; her eyes darting back and forth.

“The boss?” she said. “You lookin’ for the boss?”

“An acquaintance of his,” I said. “Someone, uh… a bit odd. Has a collection.”

“You gotta be more specific, doll.”

 

I thought back on that time when I’d been forced to wear one of those masks. It’d been at the start of my time in Tomskog. There’d been masks everywhere. There was one guy in particular that stood out in my mind. I could barely remember him, but there were details fluttering in the back of my mind.

“I think he’s got a gray hoodie,” I said. “Expressive mask. Thick hair.”

“Oh, mister Handsome? You here to see him?”

Nick and I looked at one another. I shrugged at her.

“I suppose we are.”

 

We were guided past the dance floor and into the kitchen. The attendant kept talking to us over her shoulder.

“Any friend of mister Handsome is a friend of ours,” she continued. “He’s done so much for the society, you know?”

“And what society is that?” Nick asked.

“Oh, you tease,” the attendant smile. “Break a neck, then come ask me that again.”

“Isn’t it break a leg?” I asked.

“That works too, sometimes.”

 

We were led down a spiraling staircase, and into the underground maintenance area. There were corridors marked with letters ranging from A to H. By the ‘G’, someone had added ‘epetto’ with a white marker. The attendant pointed us down the hall.

“You go on ahead, I’ll wait upstairs.”

We approached the door at the end of the hall, looking up at a single red light. I knocked on the door while Nick took a step back to keep watch. Old habits die hard; officers work in pairs to watch each other’s backs.

Something thumped against the door. It was hard to tell with the bass humming through the floor. I decided to enter.

 

There was an empty takeout box on the floor, apparently thrown at us. The room was fairly small and covered in a red light. It reminded me of a darkroom. In the middle of it sat a person in a gray hoodie with a white mask; just like the people upstairs. I’d seen it before. As he turned to us, I was reminded; that wasn’t a mask. He just had a strange and twisted face in porcelain white. It moved as his mood shifted.

He reached out his arm; but it didn’t stop. It went about a foot longer than it should, past me and Nick, closing the door behind us. He got up from his chair, and somehow grew taller. It’s as if the shape of his body could adjust and differ depending on what he wanted to do. It was eerie to see, and given our previous interaction, I wasn’t sure we hadn’t been led into a trap.

There was a long pause as we watched one another. Nick had his hand inside his jacket, where I knew he had a hidden handgun.

 

The walls were covered in tools, materials, and electronics. One corner was full of boxes, stacked to the ceiling. A couple of masks hung from strings tied around pipes lining the edge of the room. They slowly rotated, pushed by invisible winds; like a silent, restless crowd. I put on my cop persona and straightened my back.

“Good evening,” I said. “Did you recently lose a copy of a book named diary of Emmett Rask?”

His neck grew about the length of an arm as he pulled back from us, bobbing back and forth like an owl trying to focus on its prey. He nodded twice in rapid succession.

“We’re tracking down the thief and dealing with her,” I said. “But we could use some help. I’m not sure if you’re the right person to help us.”

 

There was a long ‘hmm’ sound coming from him. Nick looked at me, as if trying to tell me to keep going.

“We’re having trouble finding her,” I said. “We sort of… lost that tool. We also don’t know how to deal with her. She’s dangerous.”

The strange man nodded, still ‘hmm’-ing. He walked over to the masks hanging from the pipes and plucked one from a string like a ripe fruit. Sitting back down, I saw the lower end of his jaw unhinge and loosen with a snap, as a long blue tongue extended from his face. Using it like a paint brush, he started making changes to the mask. Pushing up a cheekbone. Adjusting the corner of a lip. A touch of blue, a touch of red. Massaging the mask with his hands, he shaped it like clay.

It was made darker. Longer. There was a tint of blue running from the eyes, like someone crying; yet the expression was neutral. Finally, he pushed his thumbs in at the top, making two protruding nubs – like budding horns.

He turned to Nick, holding it out like a gift. He had this eerie smile on his face, nodding enthusiastically. He didn’t say a thing. He just huffed, as if trying to laugh. Nick took it, giving it a closer look.

 

Before I got a chance to say or do anything, the mask maker grabbed my hands. Nick stepped to the side, drawing his pistol. These two long hands, with fingers that wouldn’t stop moving or changing size, grasped all the way to my wrists. It wasn’t forceful, but unpleasant. It didn’t even look at Nick, instead focusing every heartbeat of attention on me. I felt like was being stared at by the sun; it was overwhelming.

He put something in my hand, and moved my fingers. It just took a couple of seconds. Then he stepped back, allowing me to see what he’d done. He’d placed a card in my hand, and had my hand write ‘I.O.U’. Then he held out his hand, as if asking me to give it back to him. I just stood there for a moment before it clicked.

“You’re saying I owe you,” I said. “That’s what… what you’re trying to say.”

He nodded. I handed the paper back to him.

“Fair,” I nodded. “As long as this helps.”

 

We left that place without turning our backs to him. He went right back to working on another mask. The moment the door closed, I could hear whistling. Nick put his gun down, panting heavily.

“I was this close,” he whispered. “This fucking close.”

“You think that’ll help?” I asked, nodding at the mask he’d been given. “For anything but next Halloween, I mean.”

“Nah,” he shrugged. “I’m going as Charlie Brown.”

“Nick, I’m serious.”

“Look, these freaks got their screws so loose we don’t even know what toolbox they’re in anymore. But we keep coming back to ‘em, and that’s gotta count for something.”

I looked down at the mask. A simple neutral face in a coal black, with blue tears streaming down. It was uncanny. So realistic I thought it’d blink at me.

“Sure,” I agreed with a sigh. “It counts for something.”

 

I drove back while Nick fiddled with the mask. He looked it over, treating it a bit like a magic mirror. The rhythmic flow of the streetlights gleamed off the mask again and again, reflecting what little light it could in the strange, molded plastic.

“Should I put it on?” he asked.

“Are we supposed to?” I asked back.

“What else are we gonna do?” he scoffed. “It’s a mask.”

“Maybe I’m supposed to do it,” I said.

“But he gave it to me, right?” he sighed. “I’m going for it.”

 

I didn’t have time to protest. He put it on, adjusting a strap on the back of his head. It fit him perfectly. Nick leaned back in his seat.

“It doesn’t feel like anything,” he said. “It’s just a mask.”

“Try saying something, or thinking something,” I said.

“You don’t think I’m thinking something?”

“Generally no, Nick.”

He shook his head at me, then closed his eyes.

 

I glanced over at him a couple of times. He was making little movements with his head and fingers, like a dog having a quiet dream. It looked strange. Involuntary. Then for a second, he clutched his chest, inhaling forcefully.

I threw myself on the breaks to pull over and check on him, but Nick just waved me off. He pulled the mask away, shaking his head.

“No, no, no, I’m fine. I’m fine,” he insisted. “It’s fine. It was just… just a lot. At once.”

I didn’t care. I pulled over and put the car in park, looking at him.

“I thought about what we need,” he said. “And it showed me something.”

“What?”

“I think it’s a way to get to her,” he said. “And you’re not… I mean, this is weird.”

 

We made it all the way back to Nick’s. By the time we arrived, we were exhausted. I collapsed on his couch, wrapping myself in a blanket as his TV ran in the background. Nick slumped down next to me, still holding his mask. He looked weird without his pink sunglasses.

He told me about his experience with the mask. He said it felt like he’d been in a dark room, talking to a stranger on the other side of a wall. They’d told him about something he needed to find, and a cryptic message. That Allie wasn’t out to kill – she was waiting for an eye to blink. A blind spot in which to act.

“I don’t get that part,” he said. “What eye? What blink?”

“The Yearwalker,” I said. “Maybe this proverbial eye blinks the moment it grants a wish. Maybe that’s what she’s waiting for.”

“So… New Year’s Eve,” Nick said. “That’s our target? We banking on this?”

“I dunno, you’re the one making out with a scary charcoal oracle face.”

“I am, huh?”

He turned the mask over, holding it up to his face. He wanted to put it back on, but he didn’t. Instead he let out a long sigh, closing his eyes.

“I think you’re right,” he continued. “I dunno why, but I think you are.”

“I usually am,” I smiled. “Maybe that’s why.”

“Maybe.”

It was strange. No quips, no callbacks. That, more than the mask, concerned me.

 

For the next few days, we went on a wild goose chase. There were items we needed to get. Some of them were simple, like a large white sheet and a couple of metal rods. Others were a bit more difficult. We had to drive to a nearby town to get an old movie projector, for example. Then there was Digman’s ranch.

John Digman’s place had burned down, but we went there to poke through the ashes. It didn’t take long for Nick, adorned with the strange mask, to find what we were looking for. A green metal lockbox in the back of a collapsed building. Looking a bit closer, there was a time-worn plastic title glued to the side.

‘The End of Eternity’.

 

By that time, Christmas was just around the corner. Nick and I didn’t have a lot of time to think about it, but it was nice seeing the town do something so normal for once. All the shops had little sales, and there were decorations in every driveway. Lanterns, candles, and a couple menorahs adorning the windows. The occasional decorative blue sunflower – some with little Santa hats. All in all, Tomskog was still a town full of people – and people still loved Christmas.

Nick got me a laptop. He was tired of me using his computer, I suppose. Funny – that’s the laptop I’m writing on right now.

I got him a couple of round sunglasses – but black, not pink. They looked way cooler. I couldn’t tell if he liked them or not, but he wore them a lot on his own accord.

As the days grew closer to New Year’s Eve, Nick had it all set up in his house. A screen, the movie projector, and the strange film. I asked him to double-check the film roll, but he insisted that it was a bad idea. We were gonna play it on New Year’s, and never again. He treated that thing like it was something dangerous, and I wasn’t inclined to doubt him.

Then it was time.

 

As New Year’s approached, the town transformed again. Fireworks were going off at all hours of the day. People were out celebrating and singing in the middle of the day. But I was inside with Nick, clutching my hunting rifle. We were finding Allie and taking her out. And yet, I had doubts. As we sat on his couch, watching the empty projector screen, I asked him.

“You sure this is gonna work?”

“Yeah,” Nick said. “They said it would.”

“It’s really gonna be that easy? Stepping through, boom, done?”

“I think there’s more to it,” he said. “But we got this.”

“Mind if I take a peek?” I asked. “I wanna know what you know.”

Nick threw the mask at me with a shrug.

“It ain’t saying shit,” he explained. “It’s my mask, and it doesn’t wanna speak to anyone else.”

I tried it on, but nothing happened. He was right; the mask must’ve been bound to him the moment he put it on. It’d even started to look like him, a bit. The nose was different. The hairline too. I gave it back to him.

 

As the clock crept closer to midnight, I was freaking out. He switched up his clothes from a white sports t-shirt to a black shirt. He said it was camouflage, but I think he just wanted to look nice for New Year’s.

That final hour before the ring of the bell felt like an eternity. Nick insisted we wait. He would flip the projector on, and I was to follow him; without looking. That was important – not to look. Something about the film was too dangerous to see. According to Nick’s mask, the film was a sort of gateway to something horrifying; but if you didn’t look, you might be okay.

But that was the keyword here; might. There were no guarantees. Not anymore.

 

As we closed in on five minutes, Nick put away his mask and grabbed his rifle.

“Close your eyes,” he said.

I did. Then the film rolled to life, one click at a time. I could feel the heat of the projector. I could see the changing color through my closed eyelids. Something was showing, but I wasn’t supposed to look.

Nick took my hand. He was nervous. He took a few deep breaths.

“We good?” I asked.

“Yeah,” he sighed. “We good.”

 

We stepped forward. For a moment, I thought we were walking straight into his living room wall, but after a couple of steps it seemed that the room had grown larger. Much larger. It didn’t stop.

“Just a little more,” Nick whispered. “Keep her in your mind.”

I imagined Allie the way I’d first seen her at the Hatchet compound. This woman was an educated genius – you didn’t get that kind of position at a place like Hatchet without being exceptional. That she’d ended up here was, at the end of the day, just a strange happenstance. A long, winding road of bad choices.

Maybe this was just another one of those choices.

 

Nick let go of my hand.

“You can look now.”

And I did.

There were no more fireworks. No celebrations. Just an alien sky, a ruined landscape, and a distant tree reaching for the moon. The ground was covered in this fine powdered blue and black ash. It had a similar color to Nick’s mask. I was glad he left it behind; that thing creeped me out.

“Hold up,” Nick said. “I gotta test something.”

He held up his rifle, firing a round into the air. Pushing the casing out, it turned to ash; same as the ground. Nick checked the chamber, showing me. The bullet was still there.

“The mask said that time works differently when the eye blinks,” he said.

“She’s vulnerable now, huh?”

“Something like that.”

 

We headed towards the tree. It felt like walking through the ruins of Tomskog. I could see the outline where certain buildings had stood, but it was hard to navigate. Was that the corner pub or the supermarket? Impossible to tell.

I found an old piece of sheet metal. It’d been pressed into a pattern, but it looked burned. It had a logo on the side; Hammerhead Pharmaceuticals. It even had the blue sunflower logo. I showed it to Nick.

“Not quite Hatchet,” he said. “But similar.”

“It’s weird, right?”

“Yeah, but what do you expect?”

Hammerhead. Similar, but not the same. Well, except for the logo.

 

Time really does move differently in the places beyond. In a second, you can be a mile away. In a minute, you’ve just moved a couple of feet. It’s a space bound by fragmented and infrequent rules; remnants of something that used to govern.

By the time we made it to the tree, I couldn’t tell if it’d been days, weeks, or seconds. The base of the tree was so massive that it stretched to the horizon and back either way we watched. It was impossibly large, like a vertical ocean. But it wasn’t the size of the thing that bothered me.

This wasn’t a tree. It was organic. Muscle, bone, and sinew. Some large, some small, some downright alien. Every rippling heartbeat moved like flash floods, straining under the flimsy shell. It was alive and well – a cancerous growth protruding from the ashen earth.

 

There was a large building up ahead. It looked like an old hospital, the edge of which had been swallowed by the ‘tree’. The full moon felt like a midnight sun, sending a warmth across my arms. Looking down, our shadows had grown longer. It looked like they were trying to pull us back; begging us not to go any further. The building loomed ahead, accentuated by blue sunflowers.

We stopped just before the main entrance, looking up at a sun-bleached sign. I saw the Hammerhead logo, but not much else. Nick checked his rifle again and nodded at me.

“This is it,” he said.

“How’d you know?”

“Trust me,” he said. “This is it.”

 

We made our way through the dark corridor. It’s surprising how dark it can get when all the electronics are gone. There were no windows, and only a vague reflection from the light outside. It was quiet. Peaceful, even. There was a swaying sound coming from outside, like shifting winds. It took me a while to realize it was the pulse of the tree; a force of nature, if anything.

I found a staircase, and we hurried upstairs. Rifles at the ready. My breath catching up to my throat. I had a bad feeling, and I didn’t know if it was coming from my worries, my body, or something in between. We weren’t supposed to be there, in so many ways. But this had to end.

We were going to Dallas.

 

By the time we got to the top, it was pitch black. I could feel a door handle. Nick was catching his breath too, so I just stopped for a second. I didn’t want to go out there. If anything, I felt like turning back and crashing on Nick’s couch. We could be in Dallas by morning. We didn’t have to risk it. My mouth blurted out the first thing it could think of.

“Did you really like the sunglasses?” I asked.

“Yeah.”

“Really?”

“Yeah,” he insisted. “It was never about the color, or the shape. It’s the intention, you know?”

“Intention?” I asked. “What intention?”

“You wanted me to look cool.”

I snorted. It was dumb, but cute. That sort of summed him up, in a way. He tapped the door to alert me. It was go-time.

We pushed, and the doors swung wide open.

 

It was an old helicopter pad; or what remained of it. The ‘H’ had been reduced to an ‘I’. I could see old emergency relief boxes stacked empty in the corner. Bullet holes lining the sides of the roof. Someone outside had been shooting up, and someone up here had been shooting down. There were empty bullet casings on the ground, sun-faded on one side.

There were tracks in the dust. Someone had been there recently. I looked up, seeing the towering mass ahead of us. She had to be here. Allie couldn’t get away again.

It didn’t take long to spot her.

 

She’d grown since last time I saw her. At least twice the size, with only remnants of her white robes clinging to her. She was barely holding a consistent shape – much like the tree itself. Instead of a changing face, her entire body was morphing in and out of whatever tool, pose, and movement she needed.

She was climbing the tree. Heading to the top, to reach for the moon with the rest of the world.

Instead of stretching out an arm, a cyst would burst to reveal a new arm, leaving the old arm to wither and die. A hooked hand would reach, pull her upward, and something else would take its place. A localized storm of flesh and mass, making its way upward like an infection reaching for a vein.

We’d been right on time. She’d only just started. Nick crouched down, steadied his rifle, and took the first shot. I followed his lead.

 

It was like popping balloons. Sudden little screams compounded into a mass of voices calling out in senseless hate. Nick kept firing. We got a couple of shots off, and he was right – time didn’t work as it should. The bullets never left our chambers, but they still hurt her.

I was on my 12^(th) shot when I hit her shoulder, sending her reeling to the ground. Allie crashed into the concrete, breaking apart and reforming with a painful moan.

“***…not now!***” she called out. “***Not now!***”

I glanced over at Nick, and he met my eyes. He was terrified. His lips trembled.

“Don’t stop,” he wheezed. “Not for anything.”

 

We didn’t move an inch closer. We kept our distance, and we fired over, and over, and over. She kept screaming. Screeching, like a wind in pain. A tortured choir.

“***…how can you be this moronic?!***” she cried. “***Are you this… this hungry to die?!***”

Nick shook his head and kept firing. I did too. An arm punctured. A jaw cracked. A shoulder blade splintered. We had to keep going. We *had* to.

She had trouble moving, instead trying to spasm her way across the roof. She was going for us, but she couldn’t. We were always ahead, running circles around her and never stopping the ceaseless bullet rain. Her blood sunk into the eroded cracks of the concrete, spilling across the roof in a crackling pattern.

She turned to me, her reformed eyes trying to roll back into their sockets. When she looked at me, something changed.

 

I saw me and Nick on top of a burning mountain, firing at a sizzling mass of lava. Stabbing her with spears as she rolled around in a lake. Sticking her with bayonets in a bombed-out apocalypse-scape. The fight wasn’t going to end here. It wasn’t ever going to end. She was immortal – unending. Inevitable.

I stopped firing. I looked into those eyes, and I saw that it would never end. We were begging her to make us Sisyphus – pushing the same bolder up the hill forever. She would not stop. She couldn’t. And she thought herself blameless in this.

Then I got slapped with cold metal right across the jaw.

 

Nick didn’t hold back. It hurt like hell.

“Don’t stop!”

“It’s pointless!” I yelled back. “Look! She just… she can’t stop!”

“So?!”

He turned back to her, firing another shot. Another. Another. A finger flying off the side of the roof. A scalp popping open like an inverted pocket. A hand hanging on by a thread. I felt this darkness sinking into my chest, begging me to just give up. But Nick’s voice was louder.

I saw it clearer and clearer. In another place, we were sailors chasing a whale. We were the Mayan twins, killing the bird demon. Herakles killing the Nemean Lion. Perseus killing Medusa. King George and the Dragon. Theseus and the Minotaur. Arjuna wielding the Rudra Astra, slaying countless unyielding demons.

In those places and times, we burned her with fire, acid, and toxin. We pierced her with spears, and swords, and axes, and knives. We used every conceivable weapon. Every tactic. Every clever trap and trick. But she just did not die; she always found her way back, and we would have to do it all again.

And yet there I was. I still pulled the trigger. An endless, pointless cycle of violence, desperation, and opposition. She would not die, and we would not let her live. Immovable objects and unstoppable forces. For every piece broken, another would take its place.

And then, Nick stopped firing.

I blinked.

 

Looking up, his rifle hung loose at his side. He was smiling like an idiot. He looked at me, then pointed at Allie. She was more of a bullet hole than a creature. She’d stopped moving. Not a twitch. Not a huff. Still as the grave. Nick wiped some blood spatters from his forehead. I hadn’t even thought about how long we’d stood there.

“What… what happened?” I asked.

“I goddamn knew it,” he grinned. “I knew she was a liar. The mask said she was a liar. I felt it.”

“A liar?” I said. “That’s it? That’s all this is?”

“You’ve met hundreds of people who are nothing but liars,” Nick sighed. “How is this any different from someone… desperate to get out of a citation?”

“The arms, for one,” I said, pointing at the dead body. “And the head, kinda.”

“Funny,” Nick nodded. “Real funny.”

 

He sat down, and I followed his lead. Allie didn’t even have enough blood left to bleed by now.

“You think we gotta pay the mask guy?” Nick asked. “You gave him an I.O.U.”

“We better,” I said. “I’m kinda done with this.”

“With what?”

“This,” I said, nodding to Allie. “Done.”

Nick nodded, adjusting his black sunglasses. He couldn’t help but smile as he did.

 

We just sat there for a moment, looking at half the moon peeking out behind the vast bio-tree. The only wind I’d feel would come from air being pushed as waves of flesh rolled with an unseen beating heart.

“I got a good feeling about this,” Nick said. “I really do.”

“About what?”

“This,” he said, gesturing to Allie. “I think we’ve done something here. Something real.”

“Maybe,” I said. “Right now I just want a shower.”

“Let’s wait a day before Dallas. Get some takeout.”

I’d almost forgotten it. It felt so distant. It felt too real, in a way. There was this life, here with Nick. Then there was that other life, with taxes, loans, elections, and rear-wheel drive. Could I really live like that? Could I willingly choose to be safe and warm, when I’d seen how close we were to the edge?

I wasn’t sure. But Nick seemed to be.

 

There was a little ticking noise. Metallic.

I couldn’t tell where it came from. I checked the chamber in my rifle. The bullet was still there.

Looking over at Allie, I could see bullet fragments rolling out of her wounds. Tick. Tick.

 

I looked at Nick. He was still looking up at the moon.

I didn’t have enough time to warn him.

Something shot out of Allie like a scorpion’s sting – a second spine coming out of the remains of her jaw. Just a small puncture wound.

Right to Nick’s heart.

 

I couldn’t think. I couldn’t scream. I raged for a minute, a second, a day. My heart was skipping beats like a broken record, bursting my thoughts into a desperate static.

I threw myself at Allie. The eroded roof collapsed, sending us tumbling into the dark. It would never end. I would be Cain to her Abel, slaying her in the field. I would be Thor, killing and being killed by the great Jörmungandr – the world serpent. But no matter my role, no matter the place, and no matter the how, the when, the why, we would always destroy one another. And when it happened, it would just continue somewhere else.

But she would be back. She would try again. And if I stopped, she would win.

 

For a moment, she wasn’t moving. I stepped out of a crater of broken bones and flesh. Allie was already putting herself together again. This broken place, where time was never-ending, allowing her to try again, and again, and again. Just like the bullet in my chamber. Something was looking the other way, and on this night, in this moment, the rules didn’t apply.

I grabbed a cinder block and beat her to a pulp, over, and over, and over. I was screaming at her, begging her to die. Not with words, but with actions.

I didn’t even notice I was bawling like a child. This was it. Me, in that pit, that’d be it. I couldn’t let her win, but she couldn’t lose.

 

I’ve never felt so desperate. That insight into what your reality was turning into. What you’d lost along the way. What you could’ve had if you just kept your mouth shut and looked ahead.

I could’ve just gone to fucking Dallas. I’d had so many chances. I’d been such a senseless idiot, just like Allie had said. I’d destroyed everything, and now  I was gonna have to keep destroying, over and over. There’d be no end.

I couldn’t fathom that thought. I couldn’t live with it. It felt like my heart was turning an icy blue, begging me to lie to myself. I sat there, beating a dead body with a rock, screaming. Like the last wolf howling at a moon - for no one to hear.

 

Then, a tap on the shoulder.

I turned around.

Nick?

 

He’d made his way down the stairs. There was a puncture wound straight through his chest; all the way through his heart. It wasn’t big, but the bleeding was intense.

Of course. *She* couldn’t die here so neither could *we*.

The mask had called her a liar. She hadn’t lied about being immortal. She’d lied about there being nothing we could *do*.

 

Nick looked me over, checking me for wounds. It was harder than it looked; I was more blood than human. I was, largely, alright.

“It’s okay,” he said under his breath. “We’re good.”

“We’re… we’re not good, Nick.”

“We’re good. It’s okay.”

“Nick, for fuck’s sake, you’re-“

“Not now.”

 

He put his hands on my shoulders, then pulled me in for a hug. I slobbered all over his shoulder, ruining the only part of his shirt that wasn’t blood and sweat. I could feel the cold metal of his black sunglasses. I held him tight.

“It’s okay,” he said again. “It’s okay. We got this.”

“We can’t stay here forever,” I cried. “We can’t stay here. We can’t be like this.”

“We can fix this,” he said, stroking my head. “We made it this far.”

“So this is it? This is the end of the line? Just killing this thing, over and over?”

Nick chuckled, holding back a sob.

“So?”

 

But there was that one thing that neither Nick or I had counted on. Maybe it was a snag in the machine, a deteriorated frame snapping apart. Who knows. But as the movie projector in his living room caught fire, something happened.

It felt like falling. I was pulled away, but Nick wasn’t. Flashes of white, gold, and black. Bursts of static playing with my mind.

Last I saw of Nick was him checking the chamber, holding up a hand in a casual goodbye.

He still had his black sunglasses on.

 

In a moment, I was standing in the middle of his living room in front of a blank projector screen. I was dripping blood across his carpet. The projector tipped over as one of the legs gave out, spreading out what remained of the cursed film as soot on the wooden floor.

It was just a minute past midnight, and the celebrations were going strong outside. But all I could hear was my beating heart, and the tip-tap of dripping blood. The black mask Nick had been given had split in two; the face now resembled me. The tears looked the same.

Nick was still out there. He’d *always* be there. Long after I’m gone, he’d still be there. That icy thought gripped my gut and twisted. I cried myself to sleep on the floor that night, never even getting to the shower.

 

It hurts to recount what happened next. The weeks of dead-end leads. The DUC left Tomskog after the Yearwalk came to an end. The Missing posters of Nick across the town popped up and disappeared as time passed. Still, had he left that place with a hole in his heart, he would’ve died. Maybe it was a blessing in disguise.

I never stopped trying to find a way back, but there was nothing left to do. All trails had turned to ash, and all hope had followed. Evan was nowhere to be found. Not even the Yearwalker was around. All that remained for me was a strange town where I wasn’t wanted.

So what could I do? I left. And for a while, that’s been my story.

 

That is, until not too long ago. I was talking to Charlie. Yeah, we still keep in touch every now and then. She doesn’t get out much. Turns out there’d been sightings of Perry Digman, the Yearwalker, in Grand Rapids, Michigan. I drove up there as soon as I could.

I met Perry as he left his shift at a restaurant. I don’t think he recognized me, but I sure as hell recognized him. You don’t easily forget the faces of people you’ve saved. Not even if they’re surprised, and under a struggling streetlight

We had a short conversation, and we came to an agreement. A realization.

He’s going to do the Yearwalk again to get his uncle John back.

Now I’m doing one too.

 

Hold on, Nick. We’re still getting to Dallas.

We good.
