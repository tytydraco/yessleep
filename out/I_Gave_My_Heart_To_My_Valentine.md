At our office, there was this beautiful brunette called Julia, with whom I fell in love at first sight. She’d been working there for years when I started, and I quickly realized that she was every guy’s favorite. I almost gave up on her until she announced she had to return to Australia due to her parent’s health.  
I was devastated.

  
I knew it didn’t make sense for a guy like me to love such a beauty, but the abruptness of it gave me a change of heart. I felt compelled to reveal my true feelings. Even if it was the last thing I’d ever say to her, I just wanted to get it off my chest. And what better way than to write a letter explaining how I’ve been besotted with her the moment our eyes met?

  
Last Friday, I finally worked the courage to tell her. I knew she stayed later than most of our coworkers. And since she’d be gone soon, I was certain she’d stay even later to settle all her work. So I waited. And waited. It was really strange to see how many worked till eight, nine, even ten PM; I’d usually be out by six or seven tops. No wonder my boss hates me.

  
We all have a keycard to unlock the doors and clock in and out. As long as you’re there nine hours a day, nobody bats an eye. Or so I was told. Needless to say, everyone was surprised to see me typing away that late at night.

  
It was almost 11 PM when my last coworker left. I was alone with Julia. Which is when I realized I was an idiot. A stupid moron who didn’t think straight. The moment I stood up to give her the letter, I realized that I could’ve simply talked to her instead of being a socially inept imbecile handing over an envelope like an awkward teen.

  
I fumbled. At that moment, Julia swung her bag on her shoulder and stood up. She had to walk by my desk to leave. When she did, she froze. Of course, she saw me gawking like a goofball.

  
“Er, hi,” I said.

  
“Oh, er, Caleb, was it? I didn’t know you worked here that late,” she said. I was happy she’d remembered my name, but somehow disappointed that she’d hesitated, because to me, it meant that she barely took notice of me.

  
“Me neither. I mean, today I – I wanted to give you t-this.” She jolted when I lurched my hand with the envelope at her. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you. I’d like you to read this. If you want.”  
Julia hesitantly pinched the letter with two fingers as if it was contaminated and said “Sure” then stood there. When I kept staring at her she asked, “Should I open it now?” I simply nodded. I wanted to tell her that it was up to her, but part of me wanted to be rejected on the spot. I couldn’t bear coming in on Monday and getting embarrassed in front of everyone, or worse, being completely ignored. It would’ve broken me.

  
She pulled out the letter from the envelope. It took her a long time to read, and she swiftly peered several times from over the pink letter while doing so. Or maybe she was just pretending to read and contemplated how to formulate an appropriate response. Finally, she lowered her arms. “That’s very sweet of you, Caleb,” she said. “But I have to think about it.”

  
My heart sank. I knew it was over. “It’s fine, you know. I – I thought you wouldn’t – but it’s fine because it’s just how it is, isn’t it? I don’t mind. Just wanted you to know and, maybe… if… you know…” My words didn’t make sense. I was rambling on, even though I had replayed this scenario over and over again in my mind, going as far as speaking with my reflection in the mirror. But experiencing a face-to-face rejection was completely different.

  
“No, I didn’t mean it like that. I really have to think about it,” she said. “Tell you what. I’ve got your number.” She waved my letter with my phone and email scribbled at the bottom. It made me wince. “I’ll send you a message this weekend, OK? I’m just too tired to think straight now and I’m *really* hungry.”

  
“Oh, er, sure. Thanks.”

  
She forced a smile and left. I don’t know how long I lingered there, but next thing I knew I was sitting on my bed. Everything that happened in between was a blur. My mind was vainly contemplating whether she had rejected me, whether she was serious about contacting me, or whether she’d been crept out and pleaded to go past me. *Was I really that creepy?* Maybe.

  
Saturday started as it ended; no message from Julia. I almost forgot to eat, spending the entire day fixated on my phone. In the morning, I wondered whether she’d already woken up. At noon I thought she might be busy packing her stuff or calling her parents in Australia. What’s the time difference, anyway? I thought. But I didn’t look it up. I just wanted to ruminate absent-mindedly on my fate for the rest of the day.

  
I had given up hope when it was nearly midnight on Sunday. There was no way I could show my face to the office on Monday. While I was practicing my sick voice, my phone vibrated. A message from an unknown number.

  
***Thanks for your letter. I really appreciate your feelings. I really do. But I have to go back to OZ soon, so if you’re fine with that, we could maybe go eat somewhere on Tuesday. Tell me what you think.***

  
“On Valentine’s Day?” I blurted out loud and immediately replied “Where do you want to go?” and read her five sentences at least ten times. Until I got a message back.

  
***Novra’s Ole Pub. 11PM. Far from the prying eyes of our colleagues.***

  
I immediately accepted and she sent me another message.

  
***By the way, Friday was my last day at work because I have to use my accumulated vacation days so don’t worry when you don’t see me on Monday.***

  
That took me aback. At first, I thought that she’d invited me to a pub because, well, she wanted to set the record straight in person. But if she doesn’t return to the office, then there’s really no need to do that. I was over the moon. Despite my overexcitement, I slept like a baby. I was a little disappointed on Monday morning when I realized that Tuesday was not Valentine’s Day but the thirteenth. That didn’t reduce my anxiety, so I tried to repress my emotions at work. Julia was adamant not to let our coworkers know and I certainly would keep it to myself. Besides, all the other guys were now out of the competition.

  
Tuesday came. I entered the pub half an hour in advance and waited for Julia in my best clothes. I even sprayed myself with perfume for the occasion and bought a box of expensive chocolate because I knew she had a sweet tooth. Flowers were my first choice, but it was a lot more noticeable, and I didn’t want to risk embarrassing her in public.

  
Eleven came and went. By midnight, the few glasses of juice had entered and left my body several times. I didn’t dare to drink alcohol in case I’d get drunk. At that point, I wanted to send her a message but was afraid she’d ghost me if I was too tenacious. But what if she has already ghosted me? I thought. I can’t remember how many times I read our text exchange. All I know is that I was certain that she wouldn’t do such a thing. Julia had always been nice to everyone in the office; she wasn’t the malicious type.

  
It was nearly one in the morning when I got a message from her.

  
***I’m so sorry! I was so tired and took a quick nap but I ended up sleeping from 6PM till now. I’m getting ready. Wanna meet at a hotel near my place?***

  
“No worries! Sure. Where?” I replied immediately. She gave me the address and I rushed there. It was about twenty minutes from where I was. Ten if I ran. I could’ve taken a cab, but I had already spent money in the pub for nothing. My adrenaline was also pumping after all that sitting and waiting. I had also realized that it was Valentine’s Day, since it was past midnight.

  
I arrived at the hotel and went straight to the restaurant. Julia was nowhere to be seen. Maybe all that exercise gave me some newfound courage because I immediately texted her, “Can’t find you at the restaurant.”

  
That’s when she simply messaged me, “Room 1508”. My brain shut down. There was no way this was real. I closed and reopened the text app. I checked all our previous messages to make sure it was Julia. Even double checked the phone number. My legs dragged me to the elevator where I pressed number 15. I stepped out and looked right. There was a sign with “1527 – 1552”, so I went left to “1501 – 1526”.

  
The hotel was fancy. Very. Below my feet there was a red carpet embroidered with a school of black and gold fish going in the opposite direction, as if to warn me that I was going against the flow. But there was no way I was wrong. Everything checked out.

  
I arrived in front of room 1508 and stood there for an awfully long time. I breathed in, waited, and slowly breathed out, trying to keep my cool. My heart pounded so hard that my hand trembled as I rapped on the door. Footsteps within. They stopped abruptly. One, two distinct clicks and the door opened to reveal Julia, radiant like the morning sunshine. Before I could utter a word, she welcomed me inside with a broad smile. I thought I couldn’t be more surprised when I entered not a simple hotel room but the living room of a suite with a door on both sides. This led me to half-hope, half-expect that Julia would be undressed when I spun around. But that wasn’t the case.

  
“I’ve prepared some drinks,” she said, showing me to a round table with two comfortable velvet wing chairs. I sat in the right one while she settled into the one on the left. She poured some champaign in a crystal glass.

  
“Oh, yeah, here’s a small gift,” I said, giving her the chocolate. At that point, I was almost ashamed it wasn’t jewelry. It sounds weird but being placed within that luxurious environment made me feel rather small and insignificant.

  
She opened the box and beamed. “Oh, thank you so much. Those’re my favorite.”

  
“Really? I – I didn’t know.”

  
She held her champagne glass up and said, “To us.” I did the same and drank it entirely. When I realized mine was empty and hers was nearly full, I blushed a bit. She also noticed and chuckled.  
“So, why this room?” I asked. “I mean, it’s… grandiose.”

  
“Glad you like it.”

  
She didn’t really give me an answer, so instead I said, “So, er, about that letter.”

  
“Do I really have to answer that?” she asked, opening her arms. “Have you seen the place we’re in?”  
I didn’t know how to answer, so she refilled my cup with some champagne. This time I drank a little more conservatively. “So, when will you leave again?”

  
“Next week,” she said, looking out the window. I hadn’t noticed up to that point, but the view was amazing. The dark contour of buildings with lights scattered across the windows. The cars’ red and white lights slowly cruising across the roads. I almost forgot where I was. Our eyes met and I started to feel light-headed.

  
She stood up and frowned. “Are you feeling all right?”

  
“Yeah, it might’ve been the champagne on an empty stomach,” I said. My head began to turn.

  
“I think you need to lay down for a bit,” she said and grabbed my arm. She smelled so good. I tried to keep my eyes open, but I felt so sick I closed them, trying to follow her lead. After the sound of a door opening and closing, I was put on a surface that felt harder than a mattress. There was a metallic smell in the air, as well as something antiseptic. My head lolled to the side. It took me a lot of effort to pry them open. Next to me was a sort of table with someone being operated on. That someone looked familiar. Then I remembered it was Robert, one of my coworkers.

  
I felt my body being restrained and my head realigned upwards. Julia stood next to a surgeon. I tried to open my mouth but no words came out. I don’t even think my mouth was open in the first place. But I could hear them speak.

  
“The next guy will arrive in an hour. Make it quick,” said Julia and the surgeon nodded. I felt a sharp object piercing my body. It hurt so much. Until it didn’t. And all turned black.

  
I woke up in a dank place. All was dark except for a small bright line somewhere up to my left. I quickly realized where I was, but it took a lot of effort to open the lid of the dumpster. My body was so damaged I wasn’t able to get out so I called for help. It felt like hours when someone finally came to my rescue.

  
And this morning, I woke up in a hospital room with tubes and wires attached to me. Soon after, two doctors told me they found numerous scars on my body. They said I’m missing my left lung and right kidney, as well as part of my liver, pancreas, and intestine. It’s a miracle I survived. I’ll need months to recover. For a start…

  
I tried to call the office, but nobody answered. This whole thing feels like a surreal dream. I don’t know what to do or what will happen next. I’ve barely spoken to the doctors because I’m so confused and afraid and I refuse to believe Julia is behind all this. Was she coerced? If so, why? I can’t think of anything. She seemed so nice and perfect. The drugs they’re pumping into my veins makes me drowsy. Now, all I yearn for is to close my eyes, hoping to awaken from this nightmare.
