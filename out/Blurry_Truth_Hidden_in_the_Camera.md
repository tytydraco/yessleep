“Can I get one iced Americano, extra shot please.”

“Sure, would you like to add anything else, sir?” the cashier asked.

I shook my head. After paying, I went straight to a table by the window. The clock struck exactly 12 noon. Perfect time for a little break.

I scrolled through today’s shots. It’s been a week with no jobs coming in, so I’ve been spending my time wandering around town, hunting for spontaneous moments to capture.

Like earlier, there was this old uncle sweeping the street with a cigarette hanging from his lips. I managed to snap that moment. Later, I came across a traffic sign marked with graffiti, with a small alley behind it. Seemingly simple, yet it felt like it carried a story.

Early in the morning, the place was already busy. People walked quickly to work, some riding bicycles. I thought to myself, “This would look great with a long exposure, catching all that busy movement in one frame.”

The waiter came over with the drinks. “Are you a photographer?”

I nodded. “Just freelance. Hey…where around here would you say the most interesting shops are?”

“What kind of interesting things? A place to eat or to shop?” he asked.

I grinned. “Shops, for sure. Food? Easy, I’d just sniff my way there.”

He chuckled softly. “Try checking out the new store at the end of the row, they sell secondhand stuff. Just head straight, last shop on the corner.”

“Right at the end, yeah? Okay, thanks,” I replied. After finishing my coffee, I headed straight to the shop the waiter had mentioned. After about five minutes on foot, I found it. The signboard read “Whispers of Antiques.”

“Damn…what a unique name,” I muttered under my breath.

Though the shop was new, its deco felt old-school. Black walls paired with dark brown wood, dim lights casting a gloomy, mysterious atmosphere.

“Wow, they really put in effort…vintage vibes,” I grinned as I stepped inside. In my head, the cashier was a young woman in a metal band tee, dark eyeshadow and black lipstick. But the moment I pushed the door open, a small bell rang above the frame. Tanned skin, long wispy beard, round glasses. Plain white singlet, loose cream-colored slacks.

“Hello, young man. Can I help you?” His voice was calm, almost too friendly.

I forced a smile. “Uh, hey. Nice place. What do you sell here?”

He chuckled, shaking his head. “Secondhand stuff. Things I’ve picked up since I was young.” His eyes flicked down, settling on the camera bag over my shoulder. He pointed at it with a crooked finger. “You’re a photographer, aren’t you?”

“Yeah…not full-time though. I'm Ben,” I said.

“Hugo,” he replied with a faint smile. “So, what are you after? Maybe I can help.”

I shook my head lightly. “Just looking around. If I see something I need, I’ll let you know.”

He nodded once, slow and steady and didn’t say another word.

I walked down the narrow aisle, shelves packed with random junk. Faded ceramic figurines. A big wooden clock that had stopped God knows when. Dusty books. Picture frames with the colors drained out.

Then I heard it soft, almost a whisper. “Young man…come here.”

I turned. Hugo stood behind the counter, hunched, pulling something from an old cabinet.

He placed it down, an old DSLR camera. Rust crawling up the edges, like it had been left in the rain for years. “You know cameras, right?” he asked. His tone was careful. “I’ve had this one for a long time. Never met anyone who could fix it.”

I stepped closer. “A little. Is this yours?”

He didn’t answer that. Just nudged it toward me. “There’s still a memory card inside. I'm really bad with computers. Can you check it?”

I hesitated. Something about the way he skipped my question felt…off. “You want me to see what’s on it?”

He nodded. Slow. “Just try. I trust you. ”I’ve always found it hard to say no when an elder asks for help, so I agreed even though deep down, I felt uneasy. Not out of fear but more out of pity.

That night after dinner, I sat in my small studio and put the camera on the table. It looked worse under the light. I tried pulling the memory card out but it wouldn’t move. Like something was jamming it in place.

That’s when I noticed. No battery. “Great…should’ve asked him about that,” I muttered, rubbing my face.

I got up and headed to the storage room near the kitchen. I remembered I still had my very first camera. Different models but the same brand. On top of the cupboard was a box labeled ‘personal’. I pulled it down and searched until I found my old camera.

“Hi, buddy,” I said, half a smile on my face. Next to it lay the charger and battery. I grabbed them and went back to the studio.

I slotted the battery into the charger and while waiting for it to fill up, I took a microfiber cloth and started cleaning Hugo's camera. I brushed away the dust, scraped off dried mud stuck in the grip and finally twisted off the lens.

Click.

The sound of the lens unlocking sent chills down my spine. I couldn’t explain why.

After an hour, the battery was almost full but I pulled it out of the charger anyway. Slid it into the camera. Thankfully, it fit. Otherwise that whole wait would’ve been a waste. The camera gave a slight shudder as it powered on. I set the date and time, it had been left untouched for so long. Then I opened the photo gallery.

A row of thumbnails appeared. I tapped the first one. Blurry. I opened the next. Blurry. And the next. Same thing. Every single image was out of focus, like they were taken by someone running or maybe someone shaking the camera on purpose.

I stared at the screen for a long while. “Is the lens broken?” I whispered to myself. “If this camera was faulty, he should’ve sent it to a repair shop, not handed it over to some stranger like me.”

As I flipped through the photos, even though they were blurry, I could still make out the subjects. A run down house, trees in a forest and an old road. Standing by the window, camera still in hand, I raised it to my eye, wanting to test it myself to be sure. Slowly, I turned the zoom and pressed the shutter.

Click.

When I checked the photo, my blood ran cold. There was a figure of a man in a jacket, his body blurry, standing at the end of the road.

I froze. Quickly, I lifted the camera back toward the street. Empty. I lowered it, and looked with my own eyes. Still empty. I tried again, and looked through the camera. Nothing. Pressed the shutter.

Click.

When I opened the photo, the figure was back. The man in the jacket. Same spot, standing tall with one hand raised, pointing in a direction. My chest pounded, my hands shaking. I set the camera down on the table, switched off the studio light and rushed straight to my bedroom. Fear wrapped tightly around me.

I lay down, shut my eyes. The image of the man appeared, jacketed, his body blurred, standing far off with his arm raised, pointing into the distance. I pulled the blanket over myself. In the mix of panic and dread, I wasn’t sure when I finally drifted off.

The next morning, I woke up and went to the kitchen to make coffee. I sat there for a long time, lost in thought, trying to piece together what had really happened the night before. My memory was hazy. Slowly, I pushed open the studio door. The camera was still there, sitting on the table.

I sat down at my computer chair, took a sip of coffee and muttered, “Feels like last night was just a dream…a man appeared while I was taking pictures.” I let out a small laugh.

But the laugh died instantly. A cold chill stabbed through my chest as I opened the gallery. On the screen clearly displayed, the figure of the man in the jacket is still there. I gasped, my chest tightened. My legs carried me straight to the same window. Raising the camera with trembling hands, I pressed the shutter.

Click.

I checked again, and the figure appeared once more. Same spot. Standing still. Hand pointing in the same direction. “So it wasn’t a dream,” I whispered.

My heartbeat raced. Yet at the same time, another feeling crept in like the figure was trying to tell me something. Without overthinking, I packed up. Slipped the camera into my bag. Honestly, I didn’t even know where the courage came from but my gut told me I had to follow the sign.

Outside, I walked straight to the spot where I’d seen him. I lifted my head, tracing the direction of his finger. That’s when I saw it. An old bridge. Wooden, sagging, leading straight into the tree line. “This bridge…is this it?” I muttered.

I stepped onto it. The wooden planks creaked softly under each footstep. My eyes darted left, right, up, down, searching for whatever it was the figure wanted me to see. I crouched, peering between the gaps in the planks, then glanced at the murky river flowing beneath.

“Looking for something? Drop something in the river?”

I jumped, almost slipping. My head snapped around. It was the waiter from the coffee shop. Same uniform, apron still tied like he was on his way to work.

“Oh…no,” I stammered. “Just…checking out the bridge. Inspiration, you know?”

He chuckled. “Damn, bro. That serious, huh? Careful though. Don’t go too deep into that forest.” His voice dropped a little. “There was a case…years back. Made the news.” He pointed toward the trees beyond the bridge.

“A case?” I asked before I could stop myself.

His eyebrows went up. “Wait...you heard about it?”

“Only from locals. Thought it was just gossip,” I muttered. He shook his head slowly. “I don’t know, man. But if it made the news, maybe there was something real behind it.”

I didn’t answer. The air felt heavier, the only sound was the leaves moving in the wind. He glanced at his watch and stepped back. “Anyway...I should get going. Be careful, alright?”

I nodded once, but didn’t say a word. A few minutes later, I remembered I still had Hugo's camera with me. Even though my gut told me this was ridiculous, I pulled it out anyway. I aimed it at the bridge.

Click.

The shot came out blurry. Weird. My eyes saw everything sharp, nothing wrong. I tried again, this time pointing past the bridge, down the old road.

Click.

The figure appeared, standing at the end of the road right before the forest. His hand was still pointing straight into the trees. Without thinking, I picked up my pace. But something felt wrong. Every step gave me this weird sense like I’d walked this road before. Familiar in a way that made my stomach twist.

Which didn’t make sense. I’ve only lived here a year. I came for the quiet, away from the city. Work’s in town, half an hour drive, nothing more. I shouldn’t know this place.

I shook the thought off and kept moving. The forest wasn’t even that big. Locals said this used to be the old road to another village, before the highway cut through. Maybe that’s all it was. Just old history bleeding through.

Before going any deeper into the forest, I lifted the camera again.

Click.

In the photo, the man in the jacket now stood inside the forest, pointing to the right. But from where I was, I couldn’t see, it was blocked by a small hill. I drew in a long breath, forcing myself to step forward. My pace was slow along the deserted path, the only sound was the crunch of dry leaves beneath my shoes.

Ahead, I spotted an old wooden fence and a weathered signpost, half-buried under fallen leaves. The letters were faint, eaten away by moss. So it was true this really had once been the path used by villagers long ago.

I glanced left, then right. An uneasy feeling crept over me, as if unseen eyes were watching from behind the thicket. When I finally reached the spot shown in the photo, I stopped. Silence. Only the dense forest all around.

Up ahead, just beyond the small hill, was another path. That path led to an old house. From afar I saw a large wooden structure, almost swallowed by weeds and wild trees. Its roof was black, thick with moss.

My throat went dry. “This house…is this what you wanted me to see?” I whispered, barely more than breathing.

I raised the camera to my eye just then and suddenly a strong gust of wind swept in, like a soft whisper. A sharp chill ran up from my feet to the nape of my neck. The hairs on my neck stood on end. I gripped the camera tightly, took a deep breath, trying to steady my nerves.

Click.

Just as I suspected, the man in the jacket appeared again. This time, he was standing in the front yard of the house.

I started walking. The house was about the distance of two football fields away. With every step closer, the atmosphere grew heavier and quieter. And as I got closer to the house, a strange sense of familiarity crept over me, as though I had been there before.

The house was big, raised on tall stilts but already swallowed by overgrowth. From the outside, I tried to peek in. Wild shrubs covered the front door, the windows were shattered and the paint on the walls was cracked and peeling.

I hadn’t brought a machete, so clearing a way inside would be nearly impossible. Through the broken window, I spotted graffiti scribbles of names and a large X painted across the wall. I frowned, trying to focus on the writing.

Pap!

The sound of a branch breaking. I jumped back a step, startled. My eyes darted around every corner. Silence. No one in sight. Swallowing hard, I raised my voice, “Who’s there?”

Silence. Only the sound of my own breathing. I slowly stepped back, my eyes still darting around every corner. “Am I really doing the right thing?” I muttered to myself.

I tried to take a deep breath. “Calm down…stay calm… calm…” I whispered over and over.

I lowered my head, shutting my eyes for a moment. When I opened them again, my gaze fell on camera, still hanging on my chest. I lifted my head, tightened my grip on it with both hands and slowly aimed toward the old house.

Click. I pressed the shutter again. Once. Twice. Three times. Four. Five.

Scrolling through the gallery, the first three shots were just a blur. But when the fourth picture came up,  it clearly showed the man's figure. The figure stood at the side of the house, pointing toward an open patch of ground next to the old building. I stepped closer, eyes fixed on the clearing and raised the camera.

Click.

On the tiny screen, the image appeared. The man was still there but this time, he wasn’t pointing somewhere far away. His hand was aimed straight down. At the ground. My heartbeat quickened. With a trembling voice, I whispered, “What’s down there?”.

I drew in a long breath, trying to gather my strength. My thoughts spun wildly, a thousand questions colliding in my head. But one thing I knew for sure if I didn’t search for answers now, this question would haunt me forever. 

I looked around looking for anything I could use to dig. My eyes landed on a small hoe, rusty, its blade dull and its wooden handle worn. But that was all there was. So I grabbed it and started digging into the ground.

With every strike of the hoe, the uneasiness grew stronger like something was waiting beneath the soil. Nearly half an hour passed. Each swing grew heavier, sweat dripping faster down my face. Then, the tip of the hoe struck something solid. Not stone.

My breath grew shallow. Slowly, I scraped away at the spot. And then it appeared a torn scrap of cloth, ragged and old.

Forcing myself onward, I dug deeper. Moments later…bones. So many bones.

With every scrape of soil, the shape of a human skeleton began to emerge. I froze. My knees buckled and I collapsed to the ground, sitting up. My breath caught in my throat.

My hands trembled, chest ready to burst. With what little strength I had left, I grabbed my phone and dialed the police.

“Hello…police…please, come quickly!”

\*\*\*

A few days after the incident, news spread quickly throughout the whole community. I kept to myself, trying to calm down and process everything. Finding a human skeleton for the first time, who wouldn’t be scared?

Later, I got a call from the police station. They asked me to come in. I’d already given my statement a few days earlier and handed over the camera as evidence.

When I arrived,  they confirmed that the remains I had found belonged to a journalist who had been reported missing and even made the news five years ago.

A police officer then approached and handed the camera back to me. “Sir, we examined the camera, forensics found nothing. No evidential value.” the officer explained.

“Nothing?” I asked. “What do you mean? Those photos...”

He cut me off. “They’re all blurry. Whatever figure you thought you saw? It’s not there. Nothing we can use.”

I just stared at him, lost.

He slid a form across the table. “You can keep the camera. But if anything else happens…don’t wait. Call us.”

On the way home from the station, my mind was blank. Deep down, I had the feeling the officer thought I’d made up the whole story about those photos.

As soon as I got home, I went straight into the studio and sank into my computer chair. I sat there for a long while, staring, trying to process everything that had happened.

Finally, I turned on the computer and began searching for news about the missing journalist. When the journalist’s photo appeared on the screen, my heart nearly stopped.

The jacket was the same! “Holy shit…that’s the same jacket,” I muttered, my voice cracking. “The same one from the photos.”

With trembling hands, I grabbed the camera again. I flipped through the photos one by one. Every single shot blurry. A cold shiver crawled through me. Until I reached the very first batch of photos, the ones already stored in the memory card. That’s when it hit me.

Those blurry shots I’d seen from the beginning. When I looked closer, I realized. The places where the figure appeared. The old road. The forest. The abandoned house.

No wonder I’d felt that strange sense of familiarity. I had already seen it from the very beginning, hidden in that blurry photo. The same place I had walked through, clear in my memory.

I set the camera down on the table and collapsed onto the living room sofa. My head was full of thoughts swirling. I needed rest. Without realizing it, I drifted off.

Click.

I jolted awake. The sound of a camera shutter. I tried to brush it off, maybe I’d imagined it, just my mind playing tricks. I shifted, trying to get comfortable again.

Click.

The shutter sound again. This time, I was sure I heard it. My heart pounded hard in my chest. From the sofa, I glanced toward the studio door. Silence. No one there.

With slow steps, I approached the studio. I eased the door open and peered inside, my eyes fixed on the camera sitting on the table. My gut told me the sound had come from it. My heart raced faster but my legs moved on their own, bringing me closer.

With trembling hands, I grabbed the camera and opened the gallery.

I froze. On the tiny screen…a new photo appeared.
