I want to preface this by saying I am not a skeptic by any means, however up until last weekend I had never experienced anything the average person would deem “paranormal”. I had been to a couple of “haunted” places, for example, the Mineral Wells Hotel in Mineral Wells Texas, or the Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia Pennsylvania, but both of these visits were completely uneventful aside from some slight paranoia. However, I am an avid consumer of Ghost Hunting content on YouTube, and by avid I mean I fall asleep to Sam and Colby visiting downright demonic places. That being, about a month before my visit I came across their video covering the Goat Man's Bridge, and after realizing it was only about an hour from where I live, I decided to gather my friends and plan a trip to this infamous location.

It took much longer than expected to get the ball rolling on our visit, however after a couple weeks of friends replying with "I can go this weekend" and others replying "this weekend won't work for me", we had gathered the crew and were counting down the days till our plan could unfold. Our plan went as follows: meet at a friend's house within an hour's drive, drive over together, and stay at the bridge until we either got bored or experienced something that forced us to leave. A pretty basic plan, but we decided it would be best to go into the "investigation" blind without much research before, aside from the few videos we had watched.

The weather on the day of the trip was perfect, sunny and warm, the typical Texas Summer weather. I had gotten off work and after arriving home meticulously packed a bag to take with me, making sure I didn't leave anything important behind. The items in my bag included a camera with a flashlight taped to the top, a headlamp, another flashlight with a small cross attached to it, an army knife, a portable charger, and plenty of water. I felt like I wouldn't need everything, but in my mind when it comes to ghost hunting it is better to be safe than sorry.

The drive to my friends was over an hour, meaning I had ample time to prepare myself for the occasion. I was surprisingly calm and didn't think much about the bridge and the horror that might lay in wait for me. Arriving at my friend's house, I showed them all the things I had brought with me for "protection" from things that could be seen and things that also couldn't be seen before we piled into my car and started the drive over to the Goat Man's Bridge.

The drive over was honestly pretty serene and entertaining. Lots of laughter, music, and talking filled the space between my friend's house and the bridge, with the sun setting as we drove creating the perfect backdrop for the road. As we got within 10 minutes of the bridge, we noticed ourselves starting to be surrounded by dense forest, which was a stark contrast to the city landscape we had been surrounded by moments earlier. The parking lot we arrived at was off a main road and positioned directly by the entrance to the main trail that would bring us to the bridge. We got out of my car, grabbed our belongings, and as we stepped out to face the trail, the four of us in the group immediately said "This place feels off."

The parking lot was empty except for a white van, with dark windows, almost looking like something a van dweller would live in. The air was hot and humid, but quiet. Occasional noises were coming from the forest, indicating nature going about its daily business, but other than that the only other sound was our footsteps and voices. Directly adjacent to the parking lot was a clearing with the forest surrounding it, and a sign marking the area of the "Historic Old Alton Bridge" which the sign clearly stated was built in 1884.

As we passed the sign, the bridge suddenly appeared on our right. It was larger than I had initially expected and looked far older than the bridge in the pictures I had seen. The sun was beginning to set as we stood at the foot of the bridge, and as a group, we decided it would be best to explore the forest while we still had light, in case it got dark and we were to get lost. Turning from the bridge, our group headed down a path leading deep into the dense forest.

The forest was uncomfortably quiet as we began on the trail, trees surrounding us on every side. As we continued down the trail we noticed a swamp with trees jutting out of the water, like something straight out of the Louisiana Bijou. I had never seen a forest like this before, and leading the group, we should continue farther down the trail. The sun was still out as we came across open fields, strange buildings between the trees, and small sub-trails leading to who knows where. The sub-trails we passed were so small and uncharted that the thought of even beginning down one of them was daunting.

The intense swarms of bugs lining every inch of the trail were extremely uncomfortable. As we walked farther and farther the bugs became more dense and more aggressive. By this point each of us was covered in bites, itching on every exposed surface we had available. The sun was starting to set and I remember the sudden uncomfortable feeling I was getting as I looked into what seemed like a never-ending array of trees on our right and left. I kept spinning my head around half expecting to see something standing off in the distance behind us, down the trail we had just come from. After another five or ten minutes of exploring, I let the group know that with the sun going down I didn't want to be deep in this maze of trees, not because I feared we would run into "the Goat Man" but I felt like I wouldn't be able to trace our path back.

We turned around and I began walking back the way we came, far more anxious and paranoid than I had been since we started into the forest. Out of nowhere, a low, very obvious, growl came from somewhere in the forest behind us. I stopped turned to the group and asked "Did anyone else hear that?" My three friends behind me all agreed something made a sound, and at this point, I was no longer comfortable. I began to pick up my pace when we heard it again. For the next five minutes or so I was breathing heavily, attempting to keep my composure. Something felt off and the gut feeling I had was screaming for me to get back to the bridge and the parking lot where our only means of escape sat parked.

The growling sound continued periodically, with no difference from when we first heard it. Doing my best to ignore the noise, I continued with the group in the direction we had come, talking and laughing to lighten the mood. As we entered the field we had passed earlier, I felt a wave of relief knowing we were headed in the right direction.

Through laughter and conversation, I felt a sudden urge to yell "Marco" in the field we stood in. If you ever grew up playing childhood games in the pool, you would have played the game Marco Polo before. I had this image in my head of myself yelling "Marco" and then suddenly hearing "Polo" coming from somewhere beside me in the forest. So without hesitation, I screamed "MARCO" at the top of my lungs. Seconds later a high-pitched scream pierced the air. It sounded like the scream of a young girl, in pain or suffering and needing help. I spun around and immediately asked my friends if they had heard it. They all looked shocked and also said they heard a scream.

I had read online that hearing screams or voices from the woods was pretty common, but I didn't think I would be experiencing anything. I picked up the pace right after this, urging my friends to stick with me so we don't get lost, and don't have to stay in the forest longer than we had to. I was beginning to feel the familiar sense of panic coming over me as we now walked quickly back down the trail, the forest around us becoming a blend of darkness. You couldn't see anymore around you, and the flashlights we had brought could only pierce so far into the night.

I never thought I would be overjoyed to see the sight of this "demonic" bridge, but when we came out of the trail and it stood there waiting for us, I felt at ease. We took a second to catch our breath and discuss what we had just experienced. No one seemed overtly uneasy, and the panic our group had felt earlier was starting to subside. Following the path onto the bridge, I was taken aback by how old the thing was. The original planking was still visible on the bridge but since then there had been long large planks placed on the bridge surface to use as a walkway. Holes littered the old planks underneath the crudely fashioned path, and before we could cross I stopped the group to let them know that I wasn't planning on going any farther.

Having spent a lot of time researching the bridge, as I mentioned earlier, I found that most individuals seemed to have experienced the demonic shit on the other side of the bridge, farthest from the parking lot. We stood now just feet away from the trail leading to the woods that ordained the far side of the bridge. I wanted to refuse the idea of going further, cautioning those in the group, but it didn't seem to work.

Mustering the courage, I walked across the bridge and stood with my group staring down the start of the new trail that led into what looked like a portal to hell. The trees were creating a semi tunnel on the path, and the darkness that awaited us looked far heavier and spookier than the darkness that had followed us on the first trail we traversed.

Our group stopped right before the beginning of the new trail and the entrance to hell, and agreed to set a timer for 2 minutes. 2 minutes in, 2 minutes out simple as that. Hesitantly I agreed and we proceeded to flip on every possible light source we had before stepping forwards into the darkness that awaited.

It took a whole 30 seconds before I felt a strong sense of anxiety, panic, and fear. Off to our left was a sub-trail leading to a small open circular clearing. From where I stood, my light illuminated a tree just off to the right of the clearing, which was no more than 15-20 feet across. Resting against the tree was a white object, its shape made me go cold. The object looked like a body wrapped and tied in a white tarp, head and chin leaning down, arms crossed in its lap. I couldn’t look at it, panic was beginning to cloud my judgment. I tried to point it out to my friends but only one other person seemed to see it, and I seemed to be the only one who was on edge. 

I couldn’t take it anymore, I began to feel sick, nauseous, weak, and extremely heavy. It was a strange feeling, something I hadn’t felt before. Again my mind jumped to previous things I had read, particularly that a Demonic presence can cause people to feel sick, nauseous, or like they are going to pass out. I was feeling all those things at once and had to trust my gut, which was begging me to leave this place. 

Spinning around I booked it back down the trail, focused on getting back to the bridge, because in the moment I felt a suffocating weight crushing my being. Our group walked quickly towards the center of the bridge, panic in our voices. We all agreed that something was wrong on that trail, whether it was visible or not we felt it. I couldn't get the image of the white object out of my head, the outline of a body was all I could see.

I wanted to spend a few minutes longer on the bridge, testing an app on my phone that used SLS cameras to identify human form in any open area. Two of the people in our group didn't want to stay on the bridge any longer, and through constant prayers, made their way back across the bridge to wait for us near the parking lot.

As I opened the app and let it calibrate, I scanned the bridge and the water surrounding it with my flashlight, almost half expecting to see a pair of red eyes hidden in the brush. However, nothing caught my eye and with the app ready I started recording the area around us. Within seconds a full stick figure appeared by one of the metal railings lining the bridge. I jumped visibly, calling for my other friend on the bridge with me to come see this. He ran over and immediately saw the figure as well. I didn't care about staying any longer after this, and began once again to feel heavy, nauseous, and overall unwell. We left the bridge and headed for the car, my body and stomach doing summersaults as I walked.

We approached the car, and opened it, all getting in shutting and locking the doors. I was struggling to stay calm, panic overflowing like a glass with to much water in it. I shut my eyes tight and focused on my breathing, attempting to calm the flood. After a few minutes of discussing what we just experienced, everyone in the group wanted to leave the car and go back except for me. I physically couldn't leave the car, every piece of me was begging me not to return. I refused to go back and insisted my friends go back if they wanted, though deep down the thought of being left alone in the car was just as scary.

Right as they planned to leave one of my friends in the front seat spun their head to the side staring straight into the lingering darkness of the parking lot visible through the car window. We all turned and looked out the window, but nothing was there. Then as if it were a prank, my friend asked for my SLS camera. Opening the app, she started recording and within seconds two small stick figures standing motionless side by side appeared in the dark. I let out an audible gasp and once again felt sick and weak.

It couldn't have been a coincidence. In the midst of our panic, she said that just seconds before looking out the window, she had sworn there were two people standing, which is why she asked for my phone. At this point I was finished. I couldn't take it any longer. I was sweating, covered in bug bites, weak, exhausted, overall feeling very uncomfortable and on edge. 

As our group decided what to do next, three or four cars pulled into the parking lot, and at least ten people got out of the vehicles after they were parked. The sudden influx of people stopped the others in our group from wanting to go back to the bridge, so we decided it was best to leave and head back to our friends house. The ride back was filled with discussion of what we had just experienced, and no matter how we tried to reason the events that occurred, all of us mutually agreed that something about that place wasn't right. 

There was evil at that bridge and I am convinced of it. From the sounds and anomalies we picked up on the SLS camera, to the intense physical reaction I had when I crossed the bridge, everything pointed to the "haunting" the bridge is famous for. 

Did our group see the famous "goat man" or come face to face with a demon? We did not. However, without a doubt I have now experienced the feeling of the paranormal, and am not more than ready to go at it again. The Goat Man's bridge is an experience everyone should try at least once. The forests surrounding the bridge are actually pretty beautiful, and during the day I don't think you would even realize the place has the reputation of being haunted. 

However, once the sun goes down and the demons come out to play, the bridge and surrounding area do a full 180 and you are bound to have at least one unexplainable experience. If you have had any experiences here, please let me know. Also, if you guys would like some photos or videos from the bridge, comment below and I can try and share them. I also have a very distinct video of the scream we heard, that I mentioned earlier. I can share that as well.
