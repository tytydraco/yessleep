I used to think I was just in a bad relationship. Toxic, controlling, the kind people warn you about. But now… I’m not even sure I was in a relationship at all. I don’t know what to call it anymore.

She was my girlfriend for almost two years. At first she was everything I wasn’t. Loud, funny, fearless. I’m quiet. Careful. The kind of guy who double checks the door lock twice before bed. She pulled me out of my shell. Made me feel seen. I fell hard.

The control started small.
“Text me when you get there.”
“Don’t keep your phone on at night, it’s bad for you.”
“Don’t say that word, just trust me.”

I laughed it off at first. I thought she was just quirky. Protective. Maybe a little paranoid. Nothing serious.

But then things changed.

She showed me pictures from a friend’s birthday. I know I was there. I stood by the fridge half the night because it was too crowded in the living room. I remember holding my beer while people laughed around me.

But when she scrolled through her phone, picture after picture, I wasn’t in any of them. Not even blurred in the background.

I laughed nervously. “Weird. I was right there.”

She tilted her head, smiled faintly. “Maybe you just think you were.”

I said, “No. I was literally standing next to you.”

Her smile didn’t change. “If you say so.”

My stomach dropped.

A week later I texted her that I’d be home late from work. When I got back she was cold, distant.

“You didn’t tell me you’d be late,” she said.

“Yes I did,” I pulled out my phone, showed her the message. Sent at 5:12 pm. Two check marks. Read.

She opened her phone, pulled up our chat, and held it out. No message. My text wasn’t there.

She stared at me. Calm, almost amused. “See? You didn’t send anything. You only think you did.”

I wanted to scream, but instead I just stood there, heart racing.

She began asking me questions I couldn’t answer.

“Are you sure you’re real?”
“Why do you always feel like a placeholder?”
“Do you remember things that didn’t happen?”

Sometimes she whispered it like she was testing me. Sometimes she said it casually, like asking about the weather.

At first I thought she was joking. Then I realized she wasn’t.

One night I woke up and saw her phone glowing on the table. She was asleep. I shouldn’t have looked. But I did.

There were folders. Labeled things like “Tests.” “Shadows.” “Phases.”

Inside: photos of me. Sleeping. Cooking. Sitting on the balcony.
But the angles were strange. Always just enough to make me look… not solid. Off. Like a background element, not a person.

One video had me talking, but there was no sound. Just my mouth moving while faint music played over it.

I felt sick. I put her phone back and lay there wide awake until morning.

When I asked her about it, she didn’t deny anything. She just said:
“You weren’t supposed to see that. You’re disrupting the process.”

That word stuck with me. Process.

She started talking more about “tests” and “phases.”
She told me her job was classified. “They’re watching how I react,” she said once.
“Who?” I asked.
She just smiled. “If I tell you, you’ll disappear.”

She said it so casually, like she was reminding me to take out the trash.

I tried leaving once. I packed my bag, shoes half on, socks mismatched. I was halfway out the door when she said softly:

“If you walk away, they’ll know you broke character. Is that what you want?”

I froze.

She looked so calm, sitting there with a blanket around her shoulders, watching me. “You can play along, or you can ruin the experiment. Either way, I’ll be fine. You won’t.”

I don’t know why, but I put the bag down.

We had dinner with my mom. Afterwards, driving home, she said, “You know you weren’t actually there, right?”

I laughed bitterly. “What the hell are you talking about? I ate the damn pasta.”

She shook her head, almost sad. “I ate alone with your mother. You weren’t there. You imagine these things.”

I pulled the car over, hands gripping the wheel so tight my knuckles turned white. “Stop. Just stop.”

She leaned over, whispered in my ear:
“If I react wrong, they’ll delete you.”

I started writing everything down. Keeping receipts. Taking photos of meals before eating. Counting tiles in the bathroom to see if they stayed the same every day.

It sounds insane, I know. But when someone is erasing you piece by piece, you’ll cling to anything solid.

I finally snapped. I yelled at her. Told her she was lying, gaslighting me, breaking me down.

She just stood there, expressionless, while I screamed. Then she whispered:
“You’re not supposed to know.”

I grabbed her phone. Code 2222. Easy. I opened the folders again. More photos of me. More videos. More evidence of… nothing.

She didn’t fight me for the phone. She just watched. When I finally looked up, she said:
“You’ve ruined it now. You’re contaminating the study.”

I left that night. Stayed on a friend’s couch. Thought maybe it was over.

Two weeks later, I saw her.

In the store. Middle of the day. She was standing by the exit, holding a bag. Neutral expression. Not angry, not happy. Just watching.

I walked up to her before I could think. “Hey.”

“Hi.”

“How are you?”

“Fine.”

It was small talk, but the air around us felt heavy, like my chest was filling with sand.

Finally I blurted out, “I’m real. I don’t care what you think. I’m real.”

She tilted her head. Eyes steady. Voice quiet.
“You’re still here? They haven’t deleted you yet?”

My blood went cold.

That’s the last time we spoke.

Since then I’ve noticed small things. Lights flickering. Messages appearing on my phone, then vanishing before I can read them. Screenshots that come out blank.

The other night, I found an envelope slipped under my door. No return address. Inside was a single photo. My kitchen. My phone on the table. The same angle I always sit at.

Only… I wasn’t in the picture.

On the back, in messy handwriting, it said:
“Do not feed.”

I don’t know if she planted it. Or if someone else did.
I don’t know if this is still about her, or if it ever was.

But I can’t stop thinking about what she said that day.
“You’re part of a test. You were never real.”
