The nightlight next to my bed casts long shadows that don’t dare stretch past the closet door and I’ll get a glimpse of her, standing beyond the threshold before I pull the covers over my head. 

There’s an angel in my closet.

The black inside is an oppressive thing, but I always see her just fine and I know she sees me just fine too. She has the widest eyes you’ve ever seen. Creamy milk dollops floating in space with onyx pins in the middle. 

She’ll get close enough where some of the damp grayness of the room threatens her dark silhouette but I’ve already thrown the covers over my head. It’s better not to look. Not sure why. My mind tries to ask the pit in my stomach and the skip in my chest, but its interrupted by silent footsteps, so light it might just be the wind. My angel likes to walk alongside my bed. 

Sometimes the footsteps will stop and then all I can hear is her breathing. These wet slurps and bubbles, like the last bits of milk through a straw. They’re painful, harsh and from under the covers I struggle to breathe too like a man drowning in space.

If she decides I can sleep, she’ll be gone within the hour. And if not then she keeps me company, pattering about the room, gasping tiny moist breaths, until the sun sends her back. In both options, the closet door groans and one final click. I peel the covers back and I’m wet. Mostly sweat, sometimes tears or even a warm stickiness about my legs.


When my wife was in labor with our first child, the doctors moved like chefs around some great stew they were preparing. They were going to let her sit and marinate for a bit. I stood next to her moving my thumb over the ridges of her knuckles then across her palms, feeling the callouses and promising each one I found that I’d work hard enough so they’d never lay their charred edges on her skin again. 

I felt it after my wife had squeezed my hand. She delivered a sharp crush that surprised me, and I chuckled until I felt another pressure down around my ankle. I looked and from under the bed stretched an emaciated arm like a tiny stick that would break if you breathed too hard on it. The angel’s fingers couldn’t fit all the way around my leg but constricted tight enough anyway that a fuzzy pins-and-needles sensation was beginning to introduce itself. 

My wife tugged at my shirt and asked me if I was alright. My hand had slipped away from hers, fallen to my side and the doctors were asking her to push again. I hoped to God the angel would let go of me if I moved and it did. 

As hard as it squeezed, just as easily it let go as I took shaky steps towards the door, leaving an empty excuse in my wake.

My wife delivered my first son while I shivered out in the hallway. 

The first three years of my son’s life I never saw my angel again. I was horrified one day when my son was listing his friends at the breakfast table.

“… Matty, Alex, Hunter, Gina. And did you know there’s an angel in my room.”

Milk spilled across the table when I grabbed my son’s hand. I demanded where, when did he see her but he was already crying.

“She’s my friend, she’s my friend,” he wailed. 

I waited until my wife was sleeping before I padded quietly to my son’s room. In a chair in the corner of his room I drifted until something caught my eye. His closet door, cracked so slightly I still thought it was closed. Something shimmered behind it, rustles, and then the crack in the door was gone with a click shut. I took my son to our room and we slept there together.

My sleep was forfeit after that. Once, on the couch when watching my son build some great tower of magnets, I closed my eyes and I saw her. Not the silhouette or the shadow. My angel. 

She was so little, so small. Her features were twisted to the left like someone had stuck invisible duct tape to one side of her face and yanked it across the opposite way. Her lips curled upwards but her jaw hung slack with a nubby pink tongue cloistered inside. She twitched and jerked, and then trembled never looking away from me. The eyes, gosh, those empty eyes so wide and full with white they threatened to swallow me.

There was a fragile hand on my knee and I screamed. I kicked and jumped onto the couch, and I screamed at my son. He had seen his Daddy sleeping, twitching on the coach, moaning and he had tried to wake me. I went to the bathroom and hid there while my wife held my crying boy.

That night my wife slept in my son’s room and my angel was in my closet. She came closer to the bed than she ever had before, I could see her figure through the sheets. She reassured me that she had never left, only watching us grow. I told her to go, to please leave me and my family alone and her breathing got louder, more violent, coming and going in agitated hacks. 

She sat at the bed, shaking it so it rattled my teeth, and I listened to her watery respirations not daring to move until the sun came and her weight evaporated from the mattress. 


There was an email on my phone in the morning. A reminder I had set for myself. I got dressed, told my wife I was sorry about the day before and I’d be back by dinner. For the thirty-minute drive and the twenty I spent in my car in the parking lot I presented arguments to myself; ethos, pathos, logos, and illogical. But I went outside.

It rained for the last two days. The dirt was loose and the grave was small and I imagined the ones who dug it thanked God for his good fortune and the easy work. It would be a busy week. Another nearby cemetery had foreclosed and those already at rest were disturbed in order to find another hole in the ground. Most were brought here.

I held myself to the edge of the cemetery unable to enter, like a demon on the front steps of a church. Black umbrellas sheltered the procession, but I saw the casket barely larger than a suitcase lowered into the ground in front of the headstone:


Our Angel on Earth, and our Angel up above
RIP
2017-2020


I was halfway through the parking lot when I hit the asphalt. My head rebounded against the pebbled ground and the idle noise of the world was snuffed out for a moment. When sound returned to my ears it was the scuffle of shoes on the ground, screaming, shouting, swearing and the drum of the rain around me.

“Worm. Fucking maggot.”

I was on all fours and my face met the ground again when a solid kick slammed into my side. The toe landed square on my rib and I felt a crack. 

“Go home! You here now, huh, bitch? Not when it mattered!” 

I tried to roll away. There was a car nearby and my body urged itself under it, but it was too much to even breathe. There was liquid in my mouth and when I tried to inhale, copper syrup splashed into my windpipe. I coughed and coughed and each time a lightning flash of agony impaled my brain.

“Stop. Please stop! Stop!” someone repeated over the chaos.

When I stopped coughing, the voices were fading. I dared to bring my head up and I saw a group of fine-dressed men a small distance away. A few had their suit jackets off and one was being dragged away, fire in his eyes and teeth gnashing over rabid dribbles of spit hanging from his lips. He looked like he wanted to kill someone. He was looking at me.

I tried to put shaky legs beneath me but there were soft hands on my shoulders.

“Sit, over here. Yea. Like this, put your back against it, good.”

I lay propped against the bumper of a red pick-up truck. The chipped paint pricked at my neck, but I thought this was the most comfortable I’d been in a long time. It was a warm day, and the rain was refuge on my hot skin. It carried the blood from my scalp and ran with it in muddy streams down my face. I licked it from my lips, washing the stickiness from my mouth, and when I closed my eyes I imagined myself steaming there, like a soaked sauna rock. 

“I’m sorry.”

Her voice woke me from my smoky day-dream. It was another angel. Her name was Nina.

I shook my head. “I needed that… that was… I needed that.”

She huddled with her chin resting on her knees. Her fingers grasped at her elbows. Nina said, “They can’t understand why you’re here, but I do. I didn’t think you would come, but I’m glad you did.”

I waited until the rain felt like it was hugging me again. “It wasn’t for you,” I said.

“Good. You are human after all. I wasn’t sure.”

There was nothing to say for a while. The assembled families seemed to have calmed down and walked toward the funeral home.

“Nina!” one of them called. It was her dad. A role model, friend, and even a father to me at one point. A man I still admire but can no longer look in the eyes so instead I studied the stray thread of fabric poking out from my pants. “Come inside.”

Nina shook her head, and he turned away, the last to desert the lot.

The rain hugged us both. My clothes were a mess, but the tragedy was watching Nina’s hair begin to mat and her pregnant sleeves droop from her skinny arms. I couldn’t tell she was crying until she spoke again with a broken voice.

“I didn’t have the money. She was growing out of her shoes towards the end, and I didn’t even have enough for that. I had to let go… Why them and not me?”

I said, “I’m sorry.”

She took a shaky breath and finally stood. She looked at me the same way if you saw a mortal enemy bleeding out on the floor, an odd oxymoronic mix of pity and loathing.

“God forgives. I’ll only remember. And so will Angel. I still see her sometimes,” she said with a hitched laugh. “It sounds crazy but she visits me at night. She’s beautiful. Glowing and happy, like a real angel. Just how we imagined she would look.”

I remember. Nina and I, wrapped up together in a blanket whispering about the legends to be written of her. The most beautiful girl in the world. Nobel peace prize winner, and accomplished scientist. Special in every way. We’d stay up, taking turns at the helm, cradling the swell in her stomach and feeling her kick. She was going to be strong.

At the hospital, the doctors once again preparing their stew. Push, breathe, relax, push again. Kicking and screaming, until the doctors pulled her out. But something was wrong. She wasn’t crying. She wasn’t moving. She didn’t look the way we had dreamed. 

One of my daughter’s first experiences in this world was the slice of cold steel and a tube being shoved into her pudgy throat. I would sit with Nina while she recovered, holding her while she cried. It was out of love that she cried. Then I would sit with my daughter. She lay in her own room, in a pink cradle. The hospital gave her a room with flowers painted across the walls, and we filled it with stuffed animals and children’s books. She was there, the doctors told us. But she was trapped.

Two years, and we saw the hospital more than we did our own home.

I would always read to her; “The Very Hungry Caterpillar”, “Where The Wild Things Are”, “Brown Bear, Brown Bear What Do You See?”. I had to raise my voice over the sound of the oxygen being blown into her lungs. I would slip a finger into her half-curled hand sometimes. She was warm but she never squeezed back, she couldn’t.

When the doctors allowed us take her outside in the summer so she could feel the warmth, see the grass, it was one of the few times I almost felt happy in the past two years. Until I looked back at my daughter. She was staring at the sun, just staring. She couldn’t look away, couldn’t close her eyes, the only fucking thing she could do was let the tears well up and spill down her cheeks.

Sometimes you’d be able to see something on her face, a unique expression. It always happened when the nurses came in to suction her. She couldn’t swallow so the saliva would pool in her mouth and leak down her chin. The machine they used was like the one at the dentist, made this terrible slurping sound as it sucked and cleared the liquid from her mouth. Whenever they did this my daughter’s eyes would actually flutter, she’d take this deep breath from the hole in her throat like a sigh of relief. Then her face would calm, like someone who had finally climbed into a hot shower after a long day.

I read to her one time late into the night. My favorite one to read as an adult: “Love You Forever”. When I got to the end, I was crying. It was out of anger I cried. Why me? I looked at her and she looked back at me. Her eyes were so big. Like she was trying to catch everything around the spot her pupils were fixed to. They were fixed to me. And I didn’t want them to be. 

I didn’t say goodbye to Nina, asleep on the chair next to the cradle. I left everything as it was and slipped out the door. I looked a last time at the plaque next to the door.

Room 617: Angel

It was the perfect name for our daughter. The one we imagined on those dreamy nights in bed together; belle, scientist, athlete, philosopher, and philanthropist. Not for the one that lay in that cradle.

I left and I thought forgetting would be easy. But Angel wouldn’t let me.

In the parking lot with the rain creating tiny explosions on the ground around us, I listened with my mouth open to Nina’s words. She looked up at the angry clouds, spitting their wrath on us, but she had this peaceful smile on her mouth. 

“I know it’s not real but she’s there in my room. She crawls into bed with me and I hold her while she sleeps. I can feel her breath on my chest and she mumbles in her sleep. Did you know that? Our daughter sleep talks, it’s the funniest thing. So cute.”

Nina looked happy. And I… I looked around me. The chipped paint of the truck bit my neck, more vivid and painful now. The last of the blood from my face pooled around me, diluting into the puddles collecting on the ground. My body ached and my head throbbed. And Nina looked happy. How did she look so happy?

“She talks about you sometimes,” Nina said. She had lowered her face from the spray and water dripped from her nose while she looked at me. “She told me she has a brother now. I lie to her when she asks me questions that I can’t answer, but God, she’s smart too. She knows I’m lying when I tell her you loved her.”

The water now felt cold and slick. My clothes were frozen to my skin and my breath came out wispy pants. My bottom lip quivered while Nina studied me, and she nodded slowly, understanding. 

“So, you see her too.” She blinked a couple times. “Then maybe you can answer those questions.”

She turned, stopped halfway around to look across the field toward the little gravestone guarding the freshly filled plot of Earth. That same smile came back and this time her entire face looked at peace. Her body relaxed. Her shoulders lowered and her head tilted to the side. She left me then, and it seemed like the rain parted around her as she moved toward the funeral home. Like a guardian angel trying to keep her dry.

The door opened for her, and a man guided her in before leaning out and pointing at me. “You bleed on my truck, I’ll make sure there’s enough for a new paintjob.”

It took me ten minutes to reach my car. Crawling, then trying to walk, then crawling again, before finally using the parked cars along the way to support my fragile steps. The entire car ride was pain. I tried to lean one way, shift my weight the other, but the ribs in my chest screamed the whole way. 

My wife demanded to know what happened. She wanted to call the cops when she saw the laceration on my head but I moved past her like she wasn’t there. I need to rest, I told her, please just let me rest. I left a trail, shedding my heavy clothes as I climbed the stairs and stumbled through the hall.

I pulled the blankets up to my chin. I closed my eyes but I didn’t try to sleep. I waited until I knew she was there. The sound of air being sucked through a film of spit. 

I sat up and opened my eyes, but my room was empty. The closet door stood there firm and closed; ancient in the way it looked like a door that had never opened before and never would again.
