I don’t know how long it’s been.

Let me start at the beginning. I woke up at around 2-2:30 am to get a glass of water for my scratchy throat - it was most likely that I had contracted something from school. I dragged myself out of bed with a groan, cursing myself for not thinking of placing a water bottle on my bedside table. 

Before going downstairs to grab the water pitcher, I made sure to slip my phone into my pocket - it was a habit of mine, to always keep my phone with me. Mostly because I was addicted to it, but I always had the feeling that I would need it in the case something went wrong. I opened my bedroom door, ready to step outside into the uninsulated cold, when I was greeted with… 

Nothing.

There was absolutely nothing where a hallway had been. There was no adjacent room where my sister slept. There was no connection to the master bedroom where my parents slept. There was just a void, well, devoid of anything. 

Shocked, I backed away from the void, tripping over my messily placed backpack (“Don’t put that there, you’ll trip over it one day!” my mother had always said,) causing my phone to eject out of my pocket and slip into the void. My one potential connection to the outside world had just fallen into the great darkness. Using every single curse word I knew at full volume, I cursed my past self for leaving my backpack in such a stupid place. “Why the FUCK would I put that there!!” “WHO THE FUCK TOLD ME TO PUT THAT THERE??” I screamed, fully aware that I was the one who put that there out my laziness. 

One thing you should know about me is that I’m a quick adapter. It was necessary for staying alive at my school, where it was either to be a hyped-up monkey who started fights everywhere or to be somebody who was aware of their surroundings. I’ve read enough horror stories to know that there was no stupid thinking allowed, that screaming for help or trying to jump out my window (which was also void, I checked), would simply waste my energy. I had no water in my room, after all that was what I had woken up to get, and I had almost no food except for a bag of trail mix. I knew I would have to preserve this for as long as I could, and then find some way to retrieve my phone from the void, in order to try and call out for help. 

I tried many different ways to retrieve my phone, which I kept logged neatly in a notebook that I dug out from my backpack - a journal, if you would. I had always dreamed of surviving a disaster, dying, and then having somebody reading my journal, making me a part of history as consequence and weeping. But no matter what I tried, I could not see where my phone was - the void was like a thick fog, and groping around blindly with a clothes rope did nothing for me. Several weeks - months passed, with no hope of me getting that wretched phone. 

And how hungry and thirsty I was! I had long run out of the meager bag of trail mix on my desk, and I was starving - ravenous. And the thirst - my body felt like it was eating itself… Many times, in my small bedroom, did I wish for death. But it never came. Whatever had happened to me, wherever I was, I was incapable of dying. 

At some point, I had enough of it all. Enough of the small bedroom that had become my prison, enough of the time that I had wasted fruitlessly attempting to get my phone. I was ready to do anything - driven crazy by starvation and thirst. So one day, after saying my prayers, and hoping that the void below had an end, I jumped.

I had made a huge mistake.

There was no end.

The darkness was infinite. It was everything and anything.

You know the feeling when you close your eyes for too long and you start seeing things that aren’t there? The same happened to me. I started hallucinating, dreaming up things that - hopefully - weren’t there… ghosts of all shapes and sizes… My own mother read the eulogy at my funeral. I looked into the casket – it was empty. It was odd, it was like I was everything but nothing at once, I could see beyond the walls of this dimension, but yet I was falling,

And falling.

And falling..

And falling.

In the end, I never came in contact with my phone. I never came in contact with anything that could have helped me communicate with the outside world. But I did learn that I could interact with the… world I knew, through this dimension. Like I was an otherworldly spirit shackled to an invisible limitation. 

Somehow, I just know this will go through. 

Find me, for God's sake.
