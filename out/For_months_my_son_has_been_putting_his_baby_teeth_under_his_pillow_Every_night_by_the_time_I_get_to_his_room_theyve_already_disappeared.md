Milo's at that age where baby teeth fall out of kids' heads like ripe fruit from their boughs. A few months ago, he lost two teeth in middle of baseball practice, a lateral incisor and a molar. Both times, he sprinted over to my seat on the bleachers, smile bright and chin smudged with dirt, waving the teeth around for all the parents to see. 



That night, I slipped into his room with a few dollars in a plastic bag. My kids don't believe in the Tooth Fairy, never have, but who doesn't enjoy a tradition that involves waking up to cash? I approached his bed and gently stuck my hand under the pillow, but I failed to find the bag I made him put his teeth in. Not wanting to risk waking him up, I put the money under his pillow anyway, figuring he'd forgotten to place it. 



In the morning, he swore that he had put the teeth in a bag beneath his pillow, and suggested that it may have fallen between the mattress and the headboard. That seemed like a reasonable explanation, but after dropping the kids off at school, I practically took apart his bed, and I still couldn't find the teeth. They weren't wedged beneath the mattress, they hadn't fallen to the ground, nor had they slipped into a pillowcase. I was stumped. I could only hope that Milo had accidentally thrown the teeth away. The alternative was that they were lodged in some crevice in his bedframe, and I would find them browning and rotten months later. 



A few weeks ago, it happened again. In the midst of dinner, Milo suddenly went still. I locked eyes with him from across the table as he grimaced, grabbed a napkin, and spat a mouthful of half-masticated food into it. Peaking out from the mush was a shiny, white tooth. My husband, joking that Milo was bleeding us dry, reminded him to put the tooth under his pillow this time. Milo nodded. 



And yet, when I reprised my Tooth-Fairy role, I was unable to redeem my previous failure. Again, I couldn't find the tooth. I remember standing there in the darkness of his room, considering the possibilities. Once was an understandable oversight; twice meant that Milo was doing something with the teeth. Something that, for whatever reason, he didn't want me to know about. 



I looked away from the bed, scanning over the piles of clothes and toys on the floor. There was one particular pile in the corner of his room that I hadn't remembered seeing earlier in the day. I spent a long time staring at the amorphous lump of what was probably clothes hanging over his desk chair, then turned my attention back to Milo. From the faint light seeping in from the hallway, I could see that his eyes were wide open and focused directly on me. 



The sight made me start. I flinched a bit, apologized for waking him, and then said something about not being able to find the teeth. For a moment, I thought his attention moved to something behind me, something in the corner of the room. Then, he quietly asked me if we could talk in the morning. Feeling embarrassed and oddly unsettled, I obliged and left the room. 



I didn't get the chance to talk to Milo the next morning. His little sister fell ill, badly enough that I had to take the day off work, and by the time the chaos settled, the missing teeth had slipped to the back of my mind. Several days passed before I thought of them again.



One night last week, as we were getting into bed, I finally told my husband everything—about the teeth, and about the creeping unease that had begun to color my conversations with Milo. My son was withholding something from me, and the longer it went unaddressed, the more concerned I grew.



At first, my husband didn't share my worry. He laughed and suggested the Tooth Fairy might be real, stealing Milo's teeth before I could get to them. But his tone shifted when I mentioned the small changes I'd noticed in our son. Over the past few weeks, Milo had grown more reserved. He was still mostly cheerful, but there was a nervous energy beneath it, something restless and strained. I wondered if he was being picked on at school. He's always been a bit of a teacher's pet (a fact I've long feared could make him a target) but I couldn't figure out how the missing teeth fit into that hypothesis.



"You know one thing I've noticed recently?" My husband asked abruptly. "He never asks for anything anymore. Candy, clothes, video games–he used to ask me to bump up his allowance every other week. Who knows; maybe it's not bullying, maybe it's just that he's starting to grow up." 



I remained unsatisfied by that explanation. Yesterday, it took me until dinner to realize that he was missing a central incisor. I hadn't even known it was loose. When I asked him when exactly he had lost the tooth, he merely shrugged, saying that it must have fallen out during lunch. 



Looking back, laid out like this, there was nothing inherently suspicious about the missing teeth. They could have been easily explained by childish carelessness. Still, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. I was so convinced of it that I stopped by Milo's school this afternoon, just as the kids were getting out. The ladies at the front desk weren't particularly thrilled by my unscheduled visit, but I guess I've volunteered at enough PTA events that they let it slide. The secretary escorted me through the main doors and led me to Milo's classroom. 



By that point, most of the kids had filed out of the building and onto the field for pick-up. The secretary returned to the front office, and I looked through the narrow, rectangular pane of glass in the door to ensure Milo's teacher, Mr. Haskett, was still there. He was still seated at his desk, looking exhausted. I watched as he opened a tin of Altoids on his desk and popped a mint into his mouth. He reclined in his chair and closed his eyes like he'd just taken a long drag of a cigarette. Amused, I opened the door slowly, trying not to startle him. 



As I stepped into the room, he gave me a look of surprise which was quickly replaced by a wide smile. He greeted me by name and gestured for me to take a seat across from him. Papers crunched and the Altoids rattled in their tin as he quickly cleared the top of his desk, shoving everything in a drawer as I pulled up a chair. 



"I'm sorry to stop by so late," I said, sitting across from his desk. "I know the day's already over."



"It's no trouble at all," Mr. Haskett said. "I'm glad you came by. Milo's one of my favorites."



I smiled reflexively at that. "He's always enjoyed school—this year with you in particular," I said. "Lately, though, he's been a little… inward, I suppose."



Haskett nodded, listening. "I've noticed he's quieter," he said. "More independent. He gets his work done without prompting. Doesn't ask for much."



"Ah, well, that's something my husband and I have noticed as well," I said. "I'm sure it sounds silly to complain about a child asking for less, but it's as if he's decided he doesn't need anything anymore."



"Sometimes that's just part of growing up," he said. "Kids get to that age where they like to do things on their own. They don't want things handed to them."



I considered that for a moment. "So aside from him getting a little more stoic, you haven't noticed anything strange? No trouble with the other kids?"



"I haven't seen anything out of the ordinary," he said, his tone calm and confident. "Milo's a smart and kind boy. Well liked by the other students." 



I nodded, unsure what else to say. We made small talk about school for a few more minutes, then I thanked him for his time and stood, smoothing my skirt as I turned toward the door. That was when I noticed the cubbies along the far wall. Most were empty now, stripped down to forgotten mittens and stray worksheets. 



One wasn't. Milo's name was printed neatly on the label. Inside sat a pair of high-top sneakers that I recognized instantly. A few weeks earlier, we'd been shopping together for new winter clothes. Milo had stopped short in front of a store window and pressed his hands to the glass, pointing them out excitedly. I'd told him they were too expensive, and he had nodded and let it go, his disappointment folded away so neatly it had almost hurt to watch.



"Those shoes," I said, pointing. "Have you seen Milo wearing those shoes?"



Haskett glanced over, then shrugged. "Not sure. Why do you ask?"



"I didn't buy those for him."



"They're probably in the wrong cubby, then," he said. "The kids mix things up all the time."



"But why are they in someone's cubby and not, you know, on their feet?"



He laughed lightly. "Couldn't tell you. But don't worry, I'm sure they'll find their way back to whoever they belong to."



As he spoke, he began gathering his things, packing his back with practiced efficiency. The message was clear enough. That was my cue to leave. Still, I lingered a moment longer.



"Before I go," I said, gesturing toward his desk, "Would you mind if I stole a mint?"



He paused. When he looked up at me, he gave me a wide smile—strikingly white and entirely humorless.



"Sorry," he said. "I'm all out."
