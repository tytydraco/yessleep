Before GPS, before satellites narrated you along a sure path, if you got lost, you drove until you found a major highway and followed it out. There you would find the necessary signs to get you back to civilization. On one occasion, I drove deeper into oblivion, lost in a labyrinth of dead-yellow corn fields and evergreen hills.

It was my first long voyage as a new driver. My father had given me his old Thunderbird, not the classic, but the in-between years, or maybe better yet, the dying off years when the company half-assed assembled a chassis with an engine not much more powerful than a lawn mower and slapped a Thunderbird emblem on it. This bird didn’t fly. It sputtered and faltered, leaking and burning oil, bleeding out crude faster than I could replace it. Repairs at this point were not in the budget. Shoveling fries and punching cash register keys didn’t provide the necessary funds, and yet, against my better judgement I decided to drive a hundred miles east to see my old girlfriend. Love is in insane motivator.

I was lost. I drove for hours. The needle crept closer to “E.” A rough calculation signified that I was shit out of luck and about to run out of gas. My priority had changed from finding a known highway to finding a gas station, any gas station, even if it had a single archaic pump with a glass globe attached to the top, and hadn’t worked in fifty years. I was willing to try. My gaze was locked on the fuel gauge, but that was the least of my problems. The oil light flashed bright and ominous. The smell of neglect wafted up through the air vents. I hadn’t topped of the oil in quite a while. The engine seized, and gas or no gas, that bird came to a complete stop and tumbled dead to the shoulder of the road.

I was in nowhere land. I couldn’t have been more lost than if I had been in the middle of the Costa Rican rainforest. The only thing I could do was to pick a direction and walk.  

I walked the same road, avoiding the temptation to turn off onto an adjoining road. I figured my best option was to keep straight, follow wherever it led. If it came to a dead end, then I would go back the other way. The thought that I should’ve walked back the way I came pestered me for a good while, but I was sure something useful was on the path I hadn’t traveled. The scenery seemed to suggest that nature was subsiding, that people and the accessories of modern civilization were only a short distance away. Besides turning back seemed a longer route than going forward. My hope was I would encounter help soon.

After walking about two more hours, I finally saw signs of human habitation. I could see a few scattered cinder block buildings in the distance in a sea of gravel, surrounded on all sides by briars and thistles. There were a couple of rusted trucks with campers parked on the outer perimeter. The sun was tucked low between two of the buildings, half sunk beneath the earth. Night was fast approaching and I needed shelter. I searched for a path leading to the buildings but could find none. I had no choice but to trudge through the rough foliage.

There were four buildings, nothing special. Each looked exactly alike, four walls, a roof, and a solitary door with no windows. Upon each door was a heavy chain and padlock on the latch, and none looked to be unlocked. Empty slots were built into the bottoms spaced out every few feet. There was no one around, or at least I thought so. From inside one of the buildings there was a sudden banging and a muffled voice. Startled, I stopped and listened. Maybe I had imagined it. Maybe I was exhausted and hungry, hallucinating, but it was no farce. There was a brief silence and then a cacophony of metal clanging and voices crying. The doors were shaking, the chains swinging and banging in a chaotic rhythm of desperation. Dust was pushing through the bottom of one of the doors. I heard a scuffle. It wasn’t the closest building, but it was the one I ran to first.

I banged on the door. “Hey!”

“You need to separate these two,” a voice explained. “I know you guys don’t care, but at least give the rest of us some peace and quiet.”

I didn’t immediately answer, didn’t know what to say or what he was even requesting.

“Officer? Are you there?”

“I don’t have a key,” I stammered. My voice, lacking any tone of authority, betrayed me as an ignorant coward who had only stumbled upon this situation by pure dumb luck.

“Son, you need to let us out.”

“Are you criminals?”

“No. We’re victims.”

“Then why’d you call me officer?” 

“Let me out,” he demanded.

I walked away and toward the back of the buildings, convinced that I best not get involved. A siren wailed in the distance and then an eerie silence ensued. The hollering and banging abruptly stopped. I waited for a few moments and looked around. This could be my chance to get out of here and back home.

“I wouldn’t wait around for what’s coming next kid,” I heard a familiar voice advise. He was peering up at me through one of the slots, his eyes unusually bright, affixed to a sunken and sullied face, a skull with a thin layer of skin.  

“These ain’t good men.”

Although his demeanor and suspicious captivity was cause for concern, his sincerity in that moment seemed authentic. The simple proclamation that these aren’t good men was a profound expression of fear in a man already dead. It was a sign that maybe I was in a bad place.

Behind the buildings there was a wooded hill with a dirt road ascending to the top. The road meandered left and right and then disappeared under the trees. I ran from the buildings to the dirt road. I heard the roar of a heavy engine at the top of the hill. A part of me wanted to be seen, to be found, but that face in the slot invaded my mind and convinced me otherwise. I got off the road and hid in a thicket of trees.

A large military truck with a canvas top raced down the hill. It stopped at one of the buildings, one which did not house my concerned friend. Two men dressed in tan uniforms and wearing gas masks jumped out of the cab armed with guns. The tallest man had a larger gun with a wide barrel. The other pulled out an air horn and blew it three times as a third man finally stumbled out the back of the truck. He unclipped a set of keys from his waist and proceeded to search through them. As he got to the door the man with the wide barreled gun positioned himself directly behind the man with the keys. The man with the keys opened the lock and slid the chain through the latch. He kicked open the door and moved quickly out of the way. Several cannisters were shot inside the building. Smoke drifted through the open door. A disheveled, sickly thin man ran through the smoke. The other armed man shot him in the head. His head jerked and pushed his falling body to the wall. The man with the wide barreled gun slung his weapon around to his back and quickly dragged the dead man further away from the door. They then waited patiently, commenced to talking and laughing, as if nothing had happened.

After a few moments, the man with the keys peered inside and made a gesture with his hand. The three of them rushed inside and dragged one of the unconscious men out of the building. They slammed the door shut, repositioned the chain and fastened the lock. They rolled the unconscious man to his stomach and handcuffed his wrists and ankles. They picked him up and carried him to the back of the truck. When they had tossed him inside, they took off their gas masks. There was nothing monstrous about them. They looked like good old-fashioned church-going God-loving men. Maybe it was silly but I guess I was trying to gauge their trustworthiness by their appearance. My task was to get home. I could overlook that they had just killed a man.

The truck disappeared under the trees as it rumbled back up the hill. I had almost decided to head back towards the car and walk the other way. There was no clear indication that I could trust either the men with guns nor the imprisoned man. I chose the third option and was sauntering towards the road when I heard a child groaning. The sound was coming from further up the hill. I walked to where I thought I heard him but found nothing. Then there was another groan, weaker and more pitiful than the first one. I squinted and surveyed the hill more closely. The sky had grown grey and the sun faint, shadows and the silhouette of trees had merged into one indistinct mass of darkness, and yet, I saw movement. There was a child slowly walking through the forest towards the top of the hill. He stumbled a few more feet forward and fell to the ground. I rushed up the hill to find a young boy lying on the ground. He was emaciated, his shirt and pants hanging loosely around his thin frame. His arms were wiry and long. He wore no shoes and his feet were covered in cuts and bruises. He was a child obviously malnourished, lost and alone, without anyone to help. I had no choice. I picked the child up and made my way up the hill.

At the top of the hill was a single building surrounded by a fence with razor-wire. The sliding gate wasn’t shut. The truck was parked in front, engine purring and both the passenger and driver side doors opened. Blood dripped from the tailgate and onto the pavement.

I walked up to the front door of the building. It was a two-story building with barred windows. I pushed opened the heavy steel door. There was a line of prison cells, three on either side.

“Hello. Anyone here.”

My steps echoed as I walked through the facility. The air was icy and still. The boy began to breathe heavy. He shivered and coughed. I looked down. His face was buried in my chest. His brown hair was plaited into intricate swirling patterns, highlighted with silver pressed metal ends. His body stiffened and he wailed in pain.

“Don’t worry, I’m going to get you help.”

There was a staircase at the end of the hall. I hurried up the stairs. It was the same set-up as downstairs except there was a room to the left with a wall of monitors.  I could see that cameras were situated all around the building. There were even cameras monitoring the buildings at the bottom of the hill. In one of the monitors I saw the soldiers struggling with the man they had put in the back of the truck. They were beating him and trying to tie him up to a metal post that was just beyond the fence in the back of the facility. One of the officers turned and made his way towards the building. I saw him come through the back door and then heard his footsteps pounding up another set of stairs on the opposite end of the hallway.

I could hear him talking to himself as he made his way up the stairs. When he appeared in the doorway, his face went pale.

“What the hell?”

“This kid needs help,” I explained.

“You stupid son of a bitch. Take that thing back outside the compound.”

I stepped forward. He stepped back and placed his hand on his holster. I felt the child stiffen again. His skin felt rough. The boy pushed away from me and hurled himself to the ground. He was scaly and green, with patterned yellow lines. He turned and looked at me with pale, red eyes. His teeth were sharp and long. Everything about him had changed but his plaited hair. He turned and ran on all fours, the knees bending and flexing now in the back, an inversion of what had just been a normal little boy. He lifted his arms in the air to embrace the poor officer in his savage attack. There were more than five fingers on each hand, all fitted with razor sharp claws. A shot was fired. Blood and flesh exploded through the back of the creature, but to no avail. It had little to no effect. There was no reaction to the shot. The creature simply absorbed it with hardly a notice. He landed on the officer’s chest and wrapped his arms and legs around his prey. He then sunk his teeth in the officer’s neck.

The creature firmly grasped the officer’s neck while he reached down and dug his claws into the wrist of the hand that has holding the gun. He wrenched the wrist like a vice, shattering the fragile bones. The gun fell to the floor. The creature loosened his legs and in an odd unnatural way swung his back legs around to find the floor. Once he got his footing he dragged the officer to the floor, still holding his neck in his teeth. The officer couldn’t make a sound or a cry for help. His neck was crushed. His eyes glossed over with fear. The creature viciously slammed the officer over to his back and dragged him into one of the cells.

The prisoner then appeared at the top of the stairs. He saw the gun and picked it up. The other two officers were close behind, but the prisoner shot into the darkness beyond the door. I could hear a body tumbling down the staircase.

The prisoner turned towards me, oblivious to what was going on in the cell beside him, ready to pull the trigger. He stepped, there was clank and then an angry shriek, fierce and loud. The creature jealous and protective of its kill slammed the cell door shut.

“What the fuck?” The prisoner’s attention was wholly fixed on the creature, on the exact means of his execution. At that moment, while he was distracted the tall officer ran and tackled the prisoner from behind. The gun fell and slid across the hallway. I quickly picked it up.

There was a struggle. The officer got the upper hand and sat on the prisoner’s chest. He started punching him in the face, his anger growing with each punch. The immediacy of his partner’s death motivating and urging him to do what had originally been the monster’s job. The prisoner’s face was a tattered mess and only out of pure exhaustion did the officer stop.

He struggled to get to his feet and held his hand out towards me.  

“Give me the gun.”

“No. Back up.” I could hear the tearing of flesh and the crunching of bones coming from inside the cell. The creature joyously enjoying his quarry.

The officer looked into the cell and let out a weak sigh.

“What’s going on?” I asked.

“Just give me the gun. I’m the good guy.”

“How do I know that?”

“That piece of shit lying on the ground is a mass murderer. All those buildings down there are housing death row inmates,” he explained.

“What’s that thing in the cell eating your partner?”

He grimaced with anger. My comment was a little too insensitive.

“I don’t know. I only know that it lives in these hills. Maybe it came from space. Maybe it’s a werewolf.”

“It doesn’t look like a werewolf.”

“What are you a fucking expert on werewolves? All I know is that it periodically changes into this thing and it doesn’t change back into that sweet little boy until its belly is full.”

“Why not kill it?” I was genuinely curious. “Why keep it alive?”

“It’s like an endangered species, I guess. The government wants it alive. Its territory is rather confined if it has enough to eat and that’s what we’re here to do. Why not kill two birds with one stone? That’s all I know. Now give me the gun,” he demanded.

I didn’t know what to believe but I didn’t want to hold this position much longer. He knew how to clean up the situation and hopefully get me out of it. I went to hand him the gun but the prisoner surprised us and lunged for the gun. He got possession of it, turned and shot. The tall officer recoiled back, blood trickling down between his eyes and fell backward, his head hitting hard against the floor.

The prisoner stood over the top of the officer and crowed loudly, boasting of his achievement.

“Hell yeah, you thought you had me, but look bitch… there’s a bullet in your head.” His boastful heckling of the deceased officer disturbed the beast. It slammed against the bars of the cell and growled.

“Holy shit. Forgot all about you. What an efficient beast you are. Leave nothing on your plate.” He looked over at me. “This motherfucker has licked it clean. There ain’t hardly a drop of blood in that cell.” Sure enough, the cell was clean except for the officer’s bloody uniform. Not a chip of bone, nor a shred of flesh left. The beast was licking the floor for every last morsel.

“Isn’t he supposed to change back into a kid or something?” the prisoner asked.

It was at that point I recognized him. He was indeed a mass murderer. A man that had walked into a movie theatre and killed seven people, including a child.

“I guess he’s still hungry.” He looked at me with a sinister grin. “Move on over to that cell.” He motioned with the gun as if I didn’t understand his directions.

“I’ll shoot you. Either way, you die today.”

“I’d rather be shot than eaten.”

He chuckled. “Can’t argue with that.” He then squeezed off a round and hit me in the thigh. The force jolted my leg back, my knee locking and pushing me backwards. I fell to the floor; the pain shocked every nerve of my leg, even to the bottom of my foot. Every little jolt or movement exacerbated the pain. The prisoner began to walk towards me, ready to drag me over to feed the beast, but at that moment the cell door swung open and the beast flung himself onto the prison as he did the officer. The prisoner tried to shoot the beast but missed. He squeezed off four more rounds before emptying the chamber. There was nothing left but a useless click of the trigger.

The beast bit off several large chunks of the prisoner’s neck. Blood sprayed up onto the ceiling. The prisoner’s body twitched. His eyes rolled, he convulsed one last time and went limp. He, like the officer before him, was dragged into the cell.

I crawled into the monitor room hoping to find another gun. Not only was there a gun, but also a first aid kit. I bandaged up my leg the best I could, pulling the dressing tight above the wound. I backed up against the wall facing the door and waited.

I either passed out or fell asleep. When I came to a little boy was standing in the doorway. He walked out of the shadow and into the light. Other than the protruding stomach, he was a handsome lad. He knelt down before me. I pulled the gun up and laid the barrel on his forehead. He stared at me with his big blue innocent eyes. I went to pull the trigger, but my hand went limp. I had lost the will to shoot. If only he was the monster at that moment. The boy smiled and dashed out the door. I watched one of the monitors and saw him skipping happily away into the dark night.

There was bundle of keys on the table in front of the monitors. It was no doubt the keys for the buildings housing the prisoners. I thought for a moment I would make my way down the hill and free everyone, but I was wounded and too exhausted to do anything noble. I slept and waited for reinforcements. In the morning, there was a simple interview and then a ride back home. The government even towed my worthless T-bird back to the house. I saw on the news that night that a mass murderer’s stay of execution had been lifted and he had been executed by the state, or if you knew the truth, executed by a kid with a ravenous appetite.
