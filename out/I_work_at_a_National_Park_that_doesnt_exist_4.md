I'm not exactly sure how to start this. I woke up in the Canadian wilderness with no memories and nothing other than the clothes on my back and a crumpled envelope shoved in my jacket pocket. On the back was written “Open and PLEASE post” with the login information for this Reddit account. By some stroke of luck, some passersby gave me a lift to a police station in a town called 100 Mile House. From there the past couple weeks have been a blur of law enforcement and government employees coming to ask me questions I didn’t know the answers to and me trying to piece my life back together. 

To be entirely honest, I didn’t open that envelope until a few days ago. I almost didn’t post it at all after reading the other stories on this account. It all just feels too unbelievable. However, everything I’ve learned since waking up with amnesia in that forest makes me think maybe, at the very least, I should do this as Ranger Jackson’s last request. Inside was the story that follows-



Hello, my name is Ranger Jackson and I worked at the national park that doesn’t exist, Forest National Park. I found it. I figured out what Ranger Daniels saw in the Forest. 

Shortly after my last post, I grabbed a tent and some provisions and I set off into the Forest. I left just after sunrise down the North Stream entrance. I went down through the Sunlight Zone, and Twilight Zone deep into the inky blackness of the Midnight Zone. I found the spire-shaped rock mentioned in the last post with little issue and went into the treeline. 

I walked and walked, searching for whatever Daniels had seen, but I couldn’t find anything. Hours of walking right where it should have been but there was nothing besides massive trees jutting out of pine needles. I thought about turning around. Leaving the Forest and giving up on this stupid search of mine but for some reason, I stayed. I set up my tent right there in the middle of the trees, something that I couldn’t even have imagined doing a few weeks ago, and went to sleep. 

I woke up after an indeterminable amount of time to rhythmic creaking. Through the fabric of my tent, I could see light, a complete impossibility that deep. I laid there for nearly half an hour just listening to the creaking. *Creeeak creak creeeak creak*. The feeling that the noise was malicious never crossed my mind, but as I listened more it began to feel familiar, even inviting. I slowly unzipped the entrance of the tent. Unfiltered light filled my vision, momentarily blinding my eyes which had become so used to the dark. When they finally adjusted, I saw something completely incomprehensible given the situation- a swing set. 

There, sitting in between massive trees with sunlight streaming down from a gap in the canopy, was a wooden children’s swing set, just like you’d find in someone’s backyard. One of the swings was gently moving back and forth like a breeze was pushing it. The cracking yellow plastic of the seat and the rusty chain links holding it to the wooden beam above beckoned me forward. Something stirred within me, I felt like I knew this swing, the way the chain links felt in my hand and how that seat gave to my weight, cradling me. I reached out and touched one of the beams that connected it to the ground. Just like that, any worry I had was gone. Any recognition I had that I was over a thousand feet below the canopy of a forest that had claimed countless lives was gone. I sat on the swing and sent my legs back and forth, feet scraping the ground every swing. I was gaining height and losing the sadness I didn’t even realize had been plaguing me for years. I was nearly giddy as I reached the maximum height of the swing. I closed my eyes and enjoyed the feeling of freefall for that instant.

Just then, a woman’s voice yelled out in the distance. “Jack! Dinner!”

Without commanding it to, my mouth moved, “Coming!”

I opened my eyes and brought the swing to a stop, stretching out my legs to reach the ground. I was in the middle of a field of prairie grasses. Here and there ragweed popped out of the green and beige like flecks of gold in an alpine stream. I hopped off the swing and turned towards the house. There was my mother, standing in the doorway to the backyard with an oven mitt on and a look of amusement on her face. I ran to the house with the gracefulness of an 8-year-old, tripping up the stairs at my mom’s feet.

“What are we having?” I asked, voice high and squeaky.

“Chicken tenders and potatoes.” She replied sweetly. 

I heard the front door open and the heavy footsteps of my father as he came into the kitchen, dressed in his work clothes, and hugged his wife. He made a big display of smelling the air and said, “Man, hun, that smells good!” She giggled and set our food out on the table. I immediately dug in, stabbing the chicken with my fork and clumsily cutting it into pieces with a knife clutched in my balled-up fist. As I wolfed down the food, I vaguely listened to my father recount his day at work. Something about another client trying to scam his agency out of money. Just any other night, like every day of this past summer. It was only a few days before I’d be going to my first day of second grade. I looked towards the front door, obscured by the wall separating the kitchen, and knew that in that hallway my backpack was already hanging on the peg by the door.

My mom noticed that I had stopped eating and said, “Everything alright Jack?”

I turned to speak to her, but I blinked, and in the moment before my eyes closed my mother’s face transformed. Her eyes became black voids pushed to either side of her head like someone had stretched her face like silly putty. My heart jumped and I kicked back from the table, chair tipping past the point of no return. I landed hard on the floor and scrambled backward. The movement and fear felt familiar and something clawed at the back of my mind like a raccoon trying to free itself from a trap.

My mother stood and walked towards me. She looked completely normal, but something primal inside me screamed that something was wrong. She looked at me, concerned, and said, “Hey, hey, calm down, what’s going on?” I stopped scrambling as I hit the wall behind me and an overwhelming sense of peace came over me, yet that gnawing primal fear persisted creating a medley of emotions that made me sick. I tucked into a ball as my mother loomed over me and felt something sharp poke my leg. Gripped in my hand was the kitchen knife I was using to cut my chicken.

At that moment I made a decision. I jumped up and plunged the knife into my mother’s stomach. In an instant, she was on the ground and I was overpowering her, my 8-year-old body now the size of my father’s. I ignored his and my mother’s screams as I plunged the knife into her chest. My father yelled unintelligibly and I looked up to find that the fields outside the kitchen window had been replaced by trees. The screaming beneath me turned to bleating and I saw that my mother had turned into a fawn, bleeding out on the linoleum. Standing and walking backward, I closed my eyes tight to get the scene in front of me out of my head. I crashed hard into something solid behind me. My legs gave out and I slid down, clothes tearing on the rough surface. Tears sprang out of my eyes and I began sobbing. 

I fumbled with my headlamp and finally opened my eyes. I was in the Forest. In the pine needles lay a dead fawn, stabbed through with a kitchen knife. That’s what Ranger Daniels saw. He thought it was his memories, but whatever that was was not my memory. That wasn’t my family and I never lived in that house. I looked at my hands, covered in blood, and noticed they were wrinkled. I stayed like that for a long time, curled at the base of a tree crying and covered in blood. 

My memories become quite patchy after that. Eventually, I must’ve gotten to my tent and packed it because the next thing I remember I was even deeper in the Forest. Despite my efforts to get out, I couldn’t seem to make any progress. Every time I felt like I was getting somewhere, I would lose consciousness just to wake up in a completely different place. Now and again I would swear I could hear people talking incoherently just beyond the reach of my ever-dimming flashlight. Massive shapes would move in my peripheral vision only to solidify into a tree when I looked. Footsteps, water, screaming, gunshots, all impossible to determine if they were real.

One of these times I came to consciousness on my hands and knees drinking from a stream like an animal. I composed myself and turned around to look at the trees to get a bearing on how deep I was. In front of me was a wall of bark that my flashlight couldn’t illuminate either side of. I was far deeper than anyone I had ever known had ever been in the Forest. By my estimates, probably very near if not in the abyssal zone. 

Out of the corner of my eye, an unnatural shine drew my attention. There in the detritus of the forest floor was a large piece of gold. It was intricately carved into the form of an eagle head like what you’d find adorning a totem pole. Further ahead there was another glimmer. This time, a gold bear head. Then another. I began running up the trail, picking up these gold idols. They brought me to a pile of gold statuettes about two feet tall. I became hysterical imagining the riches I would have once I left the forest. I fell to my knees at the base of the pile and felt pain shoot up my legs. I turned my flashlight to the ground and my heart sank. Just under a thin layer of pine needles, coating the ground like gravel, were thousands of human teeth and shards of bone.

Shocked, I stood and took a step back. Immediately, I became aware of what sounded like wind, an impossibility in the Forest. It was coming from high in the air, getting louder and louder. Like a rock, a massive object fell out of the sky and halted just above the stream. A moose head the size of a two-story house attached to a neck that stretched high into the inky darkness above me brought its lips to the stream and completely stopped its flow. Thousands of gallons of water disappeared, pulled some indeterminable distance into the sky into a body I could not see. Once it drank its fill, it turned towards me, milky eyes reflecting brightly off my flashlight’s beam. They seemed to fixate on me despite the obvious lack of pupils. I was too stunned to move as the sound of wind filled the air again and a massive, yet disgustingly thin, hooved leg swung into my field of view. The head began moving towards me, uncannily sliding through the air without sight of the body it was attached to. It was far too fast to escape, so I didn’t move as it twisted its head and scooped me into its antlers.

Nausea rose in my body as it rose rapidly into the air. Now so close to the beast I could see that it was a microbiome in itself. Opossum-like hairless creatures the size of adult men burrowed through its fur in chase of insects the size of dogs. Here and there slugs the size of my forearm used bony mandibles to shave down individual hairs that looked like tree branches. In its eye, I thought I saw the silhouette of a fish swimming just under the jelly-like sclera. In short order the ground was out of sight and my ears popped painfully from the rapid changes in pressure as we rose. It was a remarkable amount of time before I noticed a light that didn’t come from my flashlight begin to illuminate the space around us. Looking up, I could see sunlight filtering through the canopy above. The beast gradually slowed down and came to a stop at a branch. It opened its mouth wide and engulfed the branch whole, chewing it loudly, the muffled sounds of wood snapping and cracking inside its mouth.

I watched it in awe, content with staying on its antler until the next time it chose to get a drink, but a growl snapped me out of it. One of the hairless opossums had noticed me and was making its way up the base of the antler towards me. I backed up to the very edge of the antler and looked off. The ground was completely invisible, branches blocking any line of sight. The opossum was closer now, black, round eyes bulging in what could only be described as excitement. Its tail swept back and forth, scaly skin scraping against bone. It clicked its teeth as it stalked ever closer. Then, without warning, it lunged at me. I figured that jumping to my death would at least hurt less than being eaten and flung myself into the air. My stomach somersaulted as I went weightless. I watched as the opossum couldn’t find purchase at the edge and joined me in freefall, hissing and scratching at the air. I wasn’t looking down to see the branch I was heading right towards before I slammed into it, going unconscious.

When I came to, I was lying in the Sunlight Zone. I’m not sure how I got there, but the impact mark my body left on the ground suggested that I somehow fell there. Taking inventory of my body, I had a pounding headache, several broken ribs, a multitude of scrapes, and my left shoulder was dislocated. The thing that struck me was that I wasn’t bleeding. All of my scrapes were white and fat bubbled up through some. I pulled up my tattered sleeve to look at an especially large one and I swear I could see a layer of skin beneath.

I made my way out from there and immediately went to my cabin to start writing this. The van is gone, I’m not sure how long I was down there. I’m on a medley of drugs to stay sane while I write this and I can feel that they are beginning to wear off. I won't be able to get this out to you all myself. Even if I tried leaving here I don’t think I could. The more time I spend outside the Forest, the more I feel compelled to return. My skin is wrinkled, I *have* to go back. I have one last ace up my sleeve, a hail mary that might bring this to the light. If you’re reading this, it worked.

Don’t search out Forest National Park, hell, don’t even go to British Columbia. If you ever see a job open for a position in a Canadian National Park, think twice before applying. This has been Ranger Jackson, saying until next time for the last time. 



And I suppose that I was his Hail Mary. I don’t know who I *am* exactly, but I don’t think I’m Ranger Jackson. Or at least in a weird way, I hope I’m not. That being said, like I mentioned, some things have happened since I woke up that are… weird. First off, it took me a long time to get ID’d by police, and when I finally was, the Canadian government took over. I got all my documents back but they have weird typos. Like, for example, my birth certificate claims I’m 122 years old, 1903. That’s gotta be a misprint. Based on appearance I'm only in my early 20s. I also seem to have no records of ever having a family.

There was another note in that envelope. It told me not to tell the internet anything that was on it, not that there was anything special or revealing, but it did personally warn me to move to the other side of the country. I’m still not sure if I believe any of this, but since I don’t know what else to do, that’s what I’m doing. I’m writing this on a plane headed for Toronto to try to start a new life from the ground up out there. Fortunately, I have a bank account with a decent amount of money so I’m not dead in the water.

Expect no more posts from this Reddit account. Whoever Ranger Jackson was, I suspect he isn’t alive anymore and I don’t have *any* stories to tell. Please do not try to find me and ask me questions, I know exactly as much as you do.
