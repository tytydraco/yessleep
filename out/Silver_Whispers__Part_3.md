Hello there. Sophie again here.

&#x200B;

I have an update for you and, unfortunately, it seems my instincts were not not wrong. I want to finish writing and sharing it, because some parts seem to be fading fast from my memory. For the previous entries on this, check in here ([Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/17hj757/silver_whispes_part_1/), [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/17k0u2b/silver_whispers_part_2/)).

&#x200B;

There were sightings again, also two more missing person reports that could fit or not the description, happened nearby rivers or lakes. Most of them I picked in Facebook groups. I shared them myself and tried to make people aware a psychopath was on the loose, although I knew it was much more than this.

&#x200B;

Nocturnal issues went on, they happened even more often. I do not know if it was a dream or real, but I started hearing, like in my sleep, voices that called my name at my window. Like those in the park. After I awoke and checked the window, nothing was visible. For now. I have talked to mom about this and, one night before Halloween night, she started experiencing similar things. Dad said he felt nothing. But he is Human, me and mom are Elves. Neither me or my family felt like going outside and celebrating, but staying indoors locked, in the present circumstances.

&#x200B;

The Halloween evening started in a bright way. My friend Helena came over early in the evening, to cook something for the occasion. Those who have read about me, not just what I have written recently, know very well about my friend Helena, who is a pretty powerful dark magical being. Of course I have talked to her on this, especially as me and Michael came to her house after our own experience. Most Humans would run in terror only by her mere presence, being a predator by nature of whom Humans have an instinctual fear of, although she is, actually, benevolent and a Christian, like me.

&#x200B;

Romanians do not, traditionally, celebrate Halloween or Samhain. The traditional feast that was, more or less, related and similar to Samhain, was Sânmedru, the night of Saint Demetrios of Thessaloniki, on 26th of October, not like Halloween, on the night of the 1st of November. Yet both of them mark the same midway between Autumn Equinox and Winter Solstice and have some similar traditions. Since I (and my family) it was the first Halloween and, since this dear is dear to her, but also to me and mom, we decided to celebrate it mixing Romanian and non-Romanian traditions.

&#x200B;

I can say the dishes were marvelous. They were vegan dishes, as Helena prefers. I do not want to digress too much from our story, but I shall mention only the pumpkin pie, spiked up with cinnamon and dried apple. Even my dad, who is pretty afraid of her, seemed to have really enjoyed it, especially with Helena„s favorite red wine. For sure, her Strega (Vampire Witch) and our Elven magic mixed and created something that delighted most of us, including Artanis. Only dad was somewhat removed from this. (I think magic is the best word for it, not energy or vibe.)

&#x200B;

We discussed recent events with Helena, after dinner. From her previous witchcraft experience before becoming an Orthodox Christian, being around a witch for years, she seems the most fit to talk into this. While taking a sip of wine, looking at me, she said:

&#x200B;

”A blood donation last night brought in high energy today. Something that happens rarely. I think you have every right to be concerned, as a mother, but try to chill down and be as rational as you can. Indeed, something seems to be hunting people. If so, you can not rely on the police, since this is clearly supernatural in nature. I admit I have not heard of anything like it, although I know about **will-o'-the-wisp** some things.

&#x200B;

I can tell you that certain types of candles are used in black magic. There are different traditions, some claim that a candle can be used as a vessel to house a spirit. This is only temporary and limited and, very often, a certain type of sacrifice is required to achieve it. If I am right, this is the reason they are trying to get people. Things do not seem to be a large-scale operation, as you suspected to be, it seems somewhat clumsy in a way, I think. Or this could mean they are desperate, whoever is doing this.”

&#x200B;

”Do you have any idea what they are?” I replied. She answered: ”I have a hunch, although not sure. I think I need to see them with my own eyes. Indeed, the most obvious answer would be demons, as they usually are. Yet, things may be more complex than this.I think there is some sorcerer who is doing something, We need to keep an eye on all this.”

&#x200B;

After a few hours, as Helena spent the night at our place, she and mom stayed up, but Artanis needed to go to bed early, so I went with my daughter to my room. The magic of the evening was still present and both of us fell asleep on it.

&#x200B;

I had a dream. I do not know how much it felt like living it, or like seeing a movie or someone telling me something. Looking back, I think it was, mostly, like some sort of movie. I write those things before the memory of the feeling fades away too much.

&#x200B;

The dream started of a land of green grass and forests, beyond the green of our world, and a deep, unbelievably sweet magic was inside every particle. I just stepped in, behind me the sea and a wooden ship. In the distance, Elves dressed in white, Full, mature Elves, and even I was like them. Blissful existence that went for millenia untroubled, until the world shall end. In the distance, some Elves were playing music and singing something that in this world I never heard, an inconceivable beauty for most mortals. In this world I stepped in, I do not know if I was a newcomer, yet, the Elves embraced and accepted me like one of them. And I was, as it seems, a Full Elf.

&#x200B;

I was kind of detached from all this, it happened to me but also, in a way, it felt like a recording. I think this is the best way to express this, since it felt that I started to see millenia pass, and me living like denison of this land, from first coming to it. I had a warm welcome at the beginning, but I do not remember much. My mind compressed into something quite general, the experience being compressed into a feeling and the feeling into a concept. There were settlements there, in the Elvenland, several of them, buildings and a ”thick” and open magic, like I never experienced in my real life. It was like the ultimate step for an Elf on this Earth, since Elves can not leave this planet in their immortal lives.

&#x200B;

As time passed, I think I was getting *bored.* But in a way I can not describe, like the deepest mundane boredom is like a mouse to blue whale, or worse. Like a spiral going down. Yes, I was detached, I was receiving this like from the outside, if I lived this, I would probably not have been able to endure it. The fairness and the bliss, remaining fairness and bliss, turned into something harder and harder to bear, precisely because they remained, more or less, the same. The place that could be considered by some an earthly paradise (those who can not truly, comprehend what the meaning of ”paradise” is) was turning, gradually, into some gates of Hell. And not just me, most, if not all, Elves around me felt more and more the same, they became grim. We tried to fool ourselves and take comfort that we are in our ultimate state, but it did not work for long. Spite, bitterness, anger took over us, as we could not see any way out of our golden prison.

&#x200B;

I remember some rumble that shook me, a shapeless fear and death coming to the land of the immortal. Yet, it felt almost liberating.

&#x200B;

I woke up, Artanis was crying. As I held her in my arms, trying to calm her down, I could not shake up the dream, part of me still felt that deep, dark feeling. I looked at the window, a mixture of dream feeling and the previous experiences anxiety was all over me. Nothing was visible outside, at first. I breastfed my baby and listened in the dark of the night. It was close to 3 am, the city was pretty quiet, but not entirely quiet. It was a full moon and the moon light came through my bedroom.

&#x200B;

Slowly, a faint white mist, a familiar white mist, started to creep outside the house, bringing a chill with it. I kept looking at the faint light that was strong enough to illuminate the floor and, soon enough, I got lost in my thoughts and feelings, a deep sorrow being over me, But I blamed it on the dream.

&#x200B;

I was already pretty tired and it seemed like me or the baby could fall asleep while breastfeeding, something already familiar. The moonlight started to shiver. I did not realize this at first, until I could hear some sort of swish outside. I felt kindled by this chill shadow, me and Artanis, also my family and my house.

&#x200B;

The mist was growing thicker and sparkles started to be seen distantly, in the street, then in the yard. I felt the need to get downstairs, to Helena, for help, as it felt too similar to what I felt in the park, a few days ago. I thought for a second I was overreacting, but I was not, as it will be soon visible.

&#x200B;

The familiar noise from the park started creeping from outside. Firstly slowly, then growing,  until it started to sound like something was calling my name: ”Sophieee… Sophieee…” It sounded much stronger now, although not as close  and it was *so beautiful*... Something inside me wanted to desperately open the window and answer.

&#x200B;

I shook up from my dullness and got up. The voice kept calling: ”Sophieee… Listen to meee…” The moonlight was stronger and moving. Artanis started crying. I noticed the street light was out, I tried to look at my phone, it was dead as well. Outside, the white mist was much thicker and widespread. The moonlight inside of it seemed like one of the most beautiful things I had ever seen. It shone in white and grey, with rays of light, a bit like in an old disco, or like a giant gem reflecting candle light. It was getting stronger and I decided to take my baby and exit the room.

&#x200B;

I went to my parents room, both being on the first floor, knocking on it, as I felt they were in danger. Finally, I heard my dad yawing irritatedly: ”What's going on? Why are you waking me up? I heard mom screaming and running towards the door. Finally, it opened and managed to see the same moonlight shining, but even closer and I could hear the voice calling like a long lament with a vibrant echo: ”Sophieee…Odetteee… Talk to me… Open up to meeee…!” An ominous presence of death was creaking in the more I stared at the light and listened to the calls. The window was opened, as it was an unusually warm October and, most likely, they fell asleep before closing it.

&#x200B;

Artanis was crying, mom and dad hasted towards the door. The voice outside came closer and closer to the window and I started to make sense of what seemed to be like moonlight.

&#x200B;

It was a luminous figure, dressed in white or light grey, almost translucent, floating through the air, like a full white elegant robe, with appendices moving in the wind. This supposed cloth covered what seemed to be an inner shape, a head, a trunk, arms and legs, but neither thoroughly visible, only through the elegant movements inside the robe/sheat/ghost sheet they were visible. For a few seconds, I could distinguish a Human-like face underneath all the sheat, with the mouth being opened large, when calling our names and making the face more visible.

&#x200B;

Goosebumps were all over my body. The dread made me shiver like being naked outside, in the middle of December. I looked for a second in the eye sockets of the apparition and I felt like this being holds a lot of secrets I know, in my heart, I want to know, secrets about and my nature, secrets this being could and wanted to share.

&#x200B;

All of us were like under some sort of drug. First of all, small *Candles*, like the ones from the park, entered the window. Then, the shroud or cloak that the entity seemed to be covered with had some appendices that started entering.

&#x200B;

I screamed at them: ”Run!” As mom was getting close to the door, I ran towards the stairs, as my daughter was screaming her lungs out. I expected that my parents would follow me. Unfortunately, my dad, who stayed behind a few seconds, did not look too much on what was behind and came after me and mom, not closing the door. I think that, in his confusion, he thought we were in danger inside the house, not realizing something came from the window. I think that, if he managed to close the door, they could not have entered the rest of the house. But, soon enough, the grey light of the entity illuminated the dark house.

&#x200B;

The power of whatever this was crept even the entire house, enveloping us. I started praying the Jesus Prayer: ”Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner!” countesly, and mom started praying to the Mother of God, as we ran downstairs.

&#x200B;

Slowly, but surely, it felt like we were leaving this existence and joining a new world, a magical world, an *Elven land* of sorts, where we were, truly home. Only that the land was dead and our place was with death, in death, there we belonged. I shivered uncontrollably.

&#x200B;

Fortunately, Helena was awake (of course she was, since she is a Vampire), browsing the web from mom's laptop, when she felt the presence. She noticed electricity going down and already came up the stairs for us. The entire corridor was almost filled by the presence of the invaders, a presence that was aggressive in itself, if it makes sense, how it was pushing into our minds. Helena signaled us to get downstairs and shouted: ”Do not let them touch you!”.

&#x200B;

The Specter started talking, like whispering out loud, long, sweet and harsh: ”Listeeeen to meeeeee!... Sophieee… Odetteeee… Help me!....” Helena shouted (something she really does and, trust me, she can be terrifying in her own right while shouting): ”Do not listen! Go downstairs!” We complied. Helena was calm and trying to use her powers, as I knew her too well. She tried using her telekinesis to materialize some ”ghost object”, but it does not seem to be working. I think she was afraid to use some brute force, like the telekinetic equivalent of a baseball bat, not knowing the nature of the entity and the potential toxic consequences destroying the physical shape of the Specter. She did not seem sure on what to do. I was basically hiding behind her like a child behind their parent, in front of danger, and mom and dad, most likely, had the same attitude.

&#x200B;

The Specter spoke in that monotone, echoing voice, deeply inhuman, like coming from another world, that vibrated in my flesh: ”Help meee…! Let me in…” a real portion of a magical world, a world where I belonged naturally, was in here, with us. But not like alive, but like dead. This silver light with blueish and white tints had a nauseating effect on us, something between drug and hypnosis, charming us literally. I knew that, if this takes too long, I shall no longer be able to hold on. This had to end quite fast. Actually, the Specter may have wanted to buy some time, so that the poison could work its way into us.

&#x200B;

Some small Candles reached us, Helena swiftly turned to one almost reaching Artanis and crushed it using telekinesis. A grey goo fell on the floor, leaving a smell like putrid flowers. She took them down one by one. The remaining ones flew back behind the Specter in fear, but the Specter itself came closer to Helena.

&#x200B;

One of the appendices of the shroud touched Helena„s dress, on her left arm, while she crushed a small Candle. She flinched and looked towards the Specter with a rage that would probably petrify me if someone like her would look at me like this. A power came out Helena, her face changed, a tint of crimson came into her otherwise white, corpse-like eyes. Around her faint vein-like things, like hot copper wire, became visible. A pair of black wings, made of mist or shadow, came out of her back, partially darkening the hallway filled with that light. It was clearly a fight without physical contact because, as it seems, touching each other would cost them too much.

&#x200B;

Helena came down carefully, looking back only as much as necessary, keeping an eye to the Specter.  Artanis was crying, I kept praying, but also tried to be careful of what was going on.

&#x200B;

As she managed to get downstairs, Helena shouted: ”Hey, Sophie, Odette, do you think we can do the droser scheme?” ”I did not think I can…” I replied, as I desperately tried to comfort and protect my baby. Mom came closer to Helena and tried to back up with Elven magic, but it was hard without „warm up”. Elves have magic build-in, so to speak, and we managed to use some of it alongside Helena, through explorations but we were not Full Elves, to be able to help in an instant. How much she succeeded in the circumstances, I do not know.

&#x200B;

The shroud or whatever was very long, it seems to me it got even longer and it tried to reach all the corners of the room. I was afraid Helena would reach her limits soon enough, as she likes to push herself beyond her normal use of magical resources. This is why I tried myself to join in the mix, only by a bit, although I found harder and harder to keep myself on my feet, both literally and mentally,

&#x200B;

”Get behind me!” asked Helena, pointing towards the door. ”Open it!” Going in the cold night, dressed only in a nightgown was not too pleasant, but I complied, holding my child. I was the last to exit, before Helena. I was right, Helena wanted to bring the Specter out of the house, and she succeeded. It seems all electricity around our house was off, including street lights. Indeed, for those who read about Helena before, know that she has the power to take out electricity, just like those things or like whatever is behind them. The Specter floated in the air and it tried to reach me again, but Helena covered us with her wings. I looked at her face, she was really fierce now, not just like a living corpse, as she usually looks, but like a horrid beast. Yet, she was my dear friend and trusted her with my life. Also my child's life.

&#x200B;

”Back me up, please...” she said as gently as she could. The small yard makes it harder to keep out of the appendices of the Specter. The cold of night, combined with the cold of this magic and the stress of fighting for my daughter's life barely let me breathe, yet I tried to help a bit. She turned to us, covering us, like protecting us and giving up the fight. The Specter came close to the prey and the fight inside me was hot in favor of just succumbing to irrational fear, letting go of my sanity and my mental awareness, it felt like dancing on a string with a bear chasing me. Then one push, like an adrenaline rush, Helena style.

&#x200B;

She seemed to be doing something similar to  when she turns electricity off, with her power. But the electricity was already off. What was she doing? Then, I realized what she wanted to do, when she was successful in turning electricity back *on*. The Specter gave a shriek when it realized it was connected to the wires of a lamppost, pinned by it.. It started to give some unearthly shrieks and screams, as electricity fried it. Helena covered us with her wings from the burning debris coming from the Specter. In the end, with one last shriek, the silver light ended, the magical cold presence was off and the Specter was on fire. Or what was left of its physical presence, as it seems to have been such.

&#x200B;

”Hold your breath and get in as fast as possible!” Indeed, the leftover of our intruder emanated the similar corpse flower smell I have experienced before, but much stronger. After a while, as the oozy substance came down from the lamppost and laid lifeless at its bottom, our hearts could finally be tranquil.

&#x200B;

A neighbor woke up and offered some help, we wanted to call 112 (European equivalent of 911), but dad convinced him not to and the final pieces of the fire went off using a fire extinguisher.

&#x200B;

Helena was back to her normal appearance of a living embalmed corpse, although all this took a toll on her. I went in, to calm down Artanis, Helena checked the house to be ok before us.

&#x200B;

Morning came and a pile of wax like dirty grey substance laid mostly on our yard, a bit in the street. Small piles of the same thing were in the house, where the small Candles were crushed. Helena checked the substance, as said, coming back in the house: “I advise you not to touch that with your bare hands, only with gloves. It seems to contain substances from dead bodies. Also, we need to be hasty, it needs to be destroyed somewhere far from your house.”

&#x200B;

I looked in her eyes: “Tell me, please. I suspect what they were. Yet, I do not think I like to know, but I need to…” Helena replied calmly: “Remember when we first met and I tried to convince you I was not one of those dead things trying to get you? Of course, I was not. But those things were dead things trying to get you. They seemed to be focusing on you and Artanis.” A cold chill came to me and I held firmly my sleeping baby in my arms.

&#x200B;

Helena continued: “You think that, as a Christian, that all hauntings are demonic, because Human souls are in the hand of God. . In principle, this is the truth for sure. Also, in practice, the vast majority of hauntings are purely demonic. But to rules there can be rare exceptions, not just to this, if the proper conditions occur. Think of me, how can someone conceive a Vampire, a monster like me to exist, and not just that, to be a Christian? But here I am. And yes, I know what you are thinking. There were *dead Elves*.” Another chill came to my bones.

&#x200B;

She went on: “You know too well that, unlike Humans, Elves have one life in all of them, the life of Earth itself. Humans each have their own mortal lives, that are destroyed at death, as the soul leaves the body. But Elves, even if they end up dead, this life is not destroyed and they remain bound to Earth, even in death. Indeed, if they are not saved to be allowed to Heaven, they end up in their own earthly Hell, different from the place doomed Human souls go, beyond the world. I heard that it was, supposedly, possible for Elven souls, in certain conditions, not to be in the Elvish Hell, but roam on Earth. I also knew of a type of necromancy using candles, to summon souls of the dead, but it made no true sense to me, until this.

&#x200B;

Someone is practicing necromancy with dead Elves. People disappear, most likely, because they are sacrificed to be able to create these false bodies for the Elven ghosts. They can not trap the souls of the living victims, but they take something from their lives to keep this going. Who or why, I do not know. This is hardcore necromancy, yet it seems amateuristic, in a way. Whoever there is, they are making progress, since the big one from last night was Candle, like the small ones, only like an upgraded version. I suspect the successful kidnappings made it possible.

&#x200B;

I think it is better to stay at your house for a while, to guard you. I shall ask for the help of father George. Unfortunately, he has not returned from the pilgrimage outside the country and we need to handle things as we can.”

&#x200B;

Ruxandra later came and took some of the wax, in plastic bags, dad took another part, and they set it on fire outside Bucharest, Ruxandra in Domnești, dad in Cernica. For now, we have had some peaceful days and nights, but we are still on the watch. I shall keep you updated, if anything new comes. I hope I shall be able to.

&#x200B;

Take care,

&#x200B;

Sophie
