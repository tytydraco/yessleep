I wrote my first post when my therapist asked me to share my experience, believing it would help process the whole thing(here it is https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/O2G1uelsMr )
If you’ve read my last post, you know my upbringing has been… Rough. This memory isn’t a bad dream, it’s a nightmare

 I woke up and the screen was gone. I cried in relief for almost half an hour before leaving the room. Once I realized the residents were out of their trances, I ran outside and rushed straight to the park to meet David. I went to our usual spot, but he wasn’t there yet. I waited and waited, but he never came. I decided to go to his house. I knew more or less where he stayed and it wasn’t too far, so I went and knocked on a few doors until a woman that looked like him answered. I guessed correctly that she was his mother and asked if David was there, to which she answered that he had gone to the park to meet me. I thanked her and left, puzzled. I went back to the playground, but he was still nowhere to be seen. Actually, now that I think about it, the whole park was empty. The sun was starting to set, and I realized I might be at the candy shop.

 I ran to get there before it was completely dark and was happy to see that the cute cashier was there. She smiled brightly went she saw me, and my heart melted. She was probably sixteen, working her first summer job, and I was madly in love with her.

“Hello there little guy, what can I do for you?” she asked me in a singsong voice.

“I’m not little!” I answered proudly. “The doctor tells me I’m actually pretty big for my age!”

The cashier chuckled. “I’m sorry sir. I can see now that you’re a big strong man!” she said jokingly but, still all in good heart. She handed me a handful of jellybeans, and she did a zipping motion across her mouth. I nodded slowly, vowing to protect the secret with my life.

I was so happy that I didn’t even look for David in the store. I just went on my merry way, prancing back home and eating my sugary bounty. I got back home and tried to go to sleep, but the sugar kept me up. I lied in bed for quite a while, squirming and turning as my tummy started to hurt. I finally succumbed to my ache and ran to the bathroom. That’s when I heard a muffled sound coming from downstairs. From the room. 

I wanted to turn back and try to sleep, but I felt guilt. Somehow, I thought I recognized the sound being a voice, but I wasn’t quite sure where from. I descended slowly into the basement and the voice grew louder and louder. The voice was screaming, desperately and terrifyingly. It was still familiar but the terror and the fritz coming from the tv masked just enough to keep me guessing. I grabbed the handle when I finally knew where I had heard the voice. I opened the door and saw the screen. 

It showed a feed of the deer’s tree. The rib cage opened, showing a gaping hole inside the tree, the whole filled with teeth-like splinters made of wood and branches shaped and moving like tendrils, eating David alive. Blood was spurting from the grotesque mouth as David screamed desperately. I sobbed, begging the screen to stop. David’s eyes locked into mine as the tree finished consuming him. His eyes were filled with anger, anger at me. I whispered sorry over and over under my breath until trunk closed with one last blood curdling scream. I crawled to the corner of the room, sat down and hid my face in my palms. The tv shut off, leaving me alone in silence. After a while, I heard it turning back on.

“Eddie, you okay buddy?”

I didn’t answer, I was still crying.

“Aw come on Ed, you hurt me first you know? All I ever asked for was to have a nice friend like you and yet you ignored me, preferring to spend your time with fucking losers instead” it snarled. The swearing caught me off guard, had me terrified. 

“Well, now we’ll have all the time in the world, just the two of us, right?”

Filling with rage, I snapped. “I HATE YOU, HATE YOU. LEAVE. ME. ALONE.”

The room stayed silent for a few seconds, and then the channel switched. Now, over the deer’s face, human skin was stretched. I recognized it despite the ripping of the skin and the blood. I threw up.

“Do you love me now? Do I look close enough to her?” it asked in the cashier’s voice. It waited for an answer, but I didn’t know what to say. “I wish I could hug you, Eddie. I wish I could hug all the pain away.”

 I looked up and glared at the screen. I got up and kicked the tv over and over. And screamed and cursed at it. It mocked me. “Wow, Eddie. You really do need that hug!” it taunted and laughed loudly, and then the screen finally shattered. It stopped talking. I went back to my bed, gritted teeth and clenched fists, and fell asleep out of exhaustion.

I woke up the day after to find all the residents gathered around me, my grandma included. It was still dark out. I looked at them and was horrified as I realized that the floor and my pillows were drenched with blood. All of the people staring, the ten or so, had had their arms ripped, strands of flesh and tendons dangling from their torsos. I looked at my grandma with distress.

“Wha-what’s happening?”

I heard loud distorted laughter coming from deep within the house, echoing through the walls. I ran through the curtain of people, gunning for the exit. As I passed the door to the basement, I heard slapping sounds. Hands, dozens of them, slapping against the hardwood floor rabidly, getting closer and closer.

“I can give you so much love now, Eddie!” The creature bellowed. The voice was completely fried, broken and distorted. The pitch shifted madly as it sang the lullaby. “One day you’ll love me as much as I love you…”

I ran as fast as I could. I got to the front door, but it was locked. I punched into it screamed as I heard the creature scuttling behind me. Now closer, it slowed to a full stop. I looked behind and saw rows and rows of dead blue fingers, slowly emerging from behind the corner of the wall. I froze. I heard lips smacking and it started speaking, still hiding behind the wall.

“I can almost taste you, Eddie. You know how hard it is to love you right now?”

“LEAVE ME ALONE.”

“It’s like… being friends with a chicken nugget, you know? You love chicken nuggets, don’t you Eddie?”

“MY NAME’S NOT EDDIE, LEAVE ME ALONE PLEASE.” I screamed, my voice straining and breaking.

“If only you knew how much self-control I have. You’re just too young to get it, but it’s alright. I’ll show you in time.”

Suddenly the door opened, almost magically. I sprinted out as I heard the mass rushing in my direction, but it stopped at the door. Having plenty of distance between myself and the house, I looked back. Hands were reaching out from the doorway, grabbing at the air in my direction. Inside the mass of dead limbs were two eyes shining from the darkness. Even from far away, its voice still echoed into thew night, punctuated by sound of it licking and smacking its lips.

“See ya soon Eddie! I love you!”

I ran until a car stopped me. It was a police officer. She brought me to the station and I was asked many questions I didn’t have answers to. The police went to the retirement house to verify the few things I was able to remember. They searched the building but couldn’t find any trace of the room I had described. I asked if my grandma was ok, but she was nowhere to be found. As for my father, he never came back.

Lucky for me, the officer who found me had always wanted to have children, but sadly never could. She managed to give me somewhat of a normal childhood, putting aside the intense reoccurring nightmares and me becoming a bit of a troublemaker. I had a lot of substance abuse issues, trying to drown the trauma, and she was always there to hold my hand through it. I even managed to more or less purge the memory out of my brain, until now. She helped grow into a person I’m proud to be, husband to an amazing woman and father to another one. I’m sorry I never got to tell you this in real life, but Lynn, if you’re reading this from up there, I love you. You’re the mom I’ve always dreamt of having. 

But the reason I’m writing this today is because I don’t know what to do. Today’s my 36th birthday. We had a nice dinner, my wife, my daughter and I. My daughter gave me a card and a box. Both my wife and I were surprised and wondered where she got it from. I opened the box to find a ring, one with an engraving within it





From Your best friend, to Edward.
