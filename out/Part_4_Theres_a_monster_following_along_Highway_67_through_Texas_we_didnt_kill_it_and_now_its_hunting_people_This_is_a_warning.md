Finally, the Ford Focus lurched to a stop in front of the liquor store. B killed the car and we all sat there for a minute.

"C'mon," B breathed out and she sounded exhausted and sad, "Let's start the hardest part." Joey leaped out of the car and ran into the store while Sam anxiously hovered by the entrance, alternating between looking at us and the expanse of darkness beyond. 

As I made to get out, my injury made itself very known. It had mellowed to a low, broad throbbing and the blood had stopped. Now that the adrenaline had truly faded I was suddenly faint, with cold creeping into my hands and feet. I noticed the blood had soaked the entire material of the seat, along my right thigh and up my hip; as I moved I could feel dried blood cracking and flaring with fresh, sparking pain. I imagined the wounds widening like a dozen mouths and it made me nauseous. I just kind of slid out of the seat with the motion of opening the mangled door, clutching for dear life onto the oh-shit handle. Before my face could make friends with the gravel B and Sam were there supporting me on both sides and we awkwardly shuffled to the front entrance.

Roger opened the door as we limped in. He helped settle me onto one of the thin plastic chairs shoved between the quarter machine and the Little Debbie snack rack. B sat beside me while Sam disappeared like a ghost among the shelves. Roger got a little First Aid kit from the counter then crouched in front of my leg, though I guess he didn't have too much confidence in what he was doing because he never actually opened the kit. He did keep up a constant conversation, which helped distract from the throbbing pain.

"Yer boy's done got ma office phone, makin' a call ta tha pah-leece. Yer fellers are pretty lucky 'doe, 'eey said you got pretty banged up there in tha caah wreck, son." He nodded towards my shredded leg. "They done lauched 'da helicopter, sorry to say it'll be a hot minute 'fore they get here. You ain't dying or nothing are ya?" I shook my head dumbly at him. Car wreck? Before I could question him Roger continued, "Damn ironic, 'cause at the same time yer fellers ain't very lucky at all. Lucky to get away, ain't lucky it happened to ya. Robbers! Damn. *Damn.* And here we all up in a tizzy 'bout that damned mountain lion!"

B said what I was unable to, her voice wavering "Car wreck?"

Roger turned to her with a fatherly smile on his face, "Now you don't worry 'bout nothin' missy, this ain't yer fault but those damned ner'do'wells 'parently runnin' the country side. You was tryin' to get away, that's all. In fact, you done saved yer friends. 'M sorry 'bout yer car, but you oughta be proud 'o yerself."

He addressed both of us again, "Y'all forgive me for sayin' this, but I'm glad it was a' couple young'uns like y'all who were able to get away. Lord knows many of the older folks 'round here wouldn't have been able to. Bad backs. Bad hearts. 'M 'fraid the bastards would've slaughtered them in their beds, seein' how they treated you young'uns."

Roger would've continued, but then two cop cars pulled into the parking lot, sirens blaring, red-and-blue lights spiraling. Four cops burst into the store and then things got really complicated.

The only female officer, who had her hair pulled back into a smart bun, rushed over to me. Roger hastily moved out of the way as the officer introduced herself and got to work examining my leg.

"Worst part is a nasty laceration about fourteen inches long along your outer thigh and knee. It's gonna need a lot of stitches, but all I'll do 'till we can get you to the physician is bag and tag it (her slang for "gauze and bandages"), but don't you worry you'll be just fine--"

Despite everything that happened that night, I still found the strength to be humiliated when I had to shimmy the shredded remains of my jeans down to my ankles so the officer could properly treat my wounds. Though the sensation (and pain) of ripping fibers, skin, and muscle quickly drowned the humiliation of sitting only in my undies in the middle of fuck-all nowhere with a pretty lady police officer helping bandage my wounds caused by some demon-from-Hell.

While she held a massive wad of gauze to my leg and began securing it with bandages, another officer (who I deemed 'Mr. Mustache' due to his resemblance to that heavy set guy from *Blue Bloods*) began asking me for my statement. He briefly explained that they had been able to trace the origin of my 9-1-1 call to Bob and Maria's ranch and had sent officers to investigate, while a helicopter had been sent out due to the anticipation of a medical emergency. The officers had arrived at the ranch and were in the process of clearing it when Joey called from the liquor store. It was quickly determined we were the same folks that had called earlier and the emergency services had been rerouted.

Mr. Mustached looked at me seriously, "Now, something clearly went down in the house tonight, son. I just need you to tell me what. We're asking your friends as well, so we can get a clearer picture and cross-reference statements. I know this has been a stressful night for you all, but I need you to be truthful with me here." He got out a notepad, man, did cops really still use notepads? Didn't he have at least, like, a recorder or something? Surely that would be more accurate? "Now, go on, tell me your version of events."

And so I did.

Not about the demon-from-Hell that chased us down the highway. I decided against telling them about that. I was exhausted and it occurred to me that I wouldn't believe me if I was telling myself all the crazy shit that happened that evening. I just wanted this entire nightmare to be over. Anyway, at best they would assume the blood-loss had made me delusional or I was high out of my mind on drugs. So, I told them something similar to the tale Joey must've told Roger and the dispatcher. That is, broadly, a break-in occurred and we got into B's car to flee. In our panic, B "wrecked" the car a few miles in, perhaps scraping the car along some boulders or a guardrail. I was injured and B had managed to limp the car to the liquor store.

The officer took my statement then went over to his buddies and I anxiously waited for him to come storming back, to tell me I was a bald-faced liar and that all our accounts differed more than Mt. Everest and the Sahara Desert. But he didn't. The nice lady officer got me a shock blanket and they helped escort me to the helipad about half a mile down the road for the helicopter to fly me to the hospital.

And that was the end of that.

\*\*\*

I want to say that we recovered from the ordeal with nothing more than scars and bad dreams and that life went on as it had before. But I can't. I never spoke to Joey again after the events of that night. It was only two days later when I finally got home that B told me he and Sam had broken up almost immediately after the night's events. Where I would have before jumped for joy then hunted the fucker down just to punch his teeth out, there was instead a deep, yearning numbness in my chest and I found I did not care at all. If before Sam was a sweet, shy girl with a poor taste in men, now she was a frozen shell of her former self who, during the few sad get-togethers we tried to have, sat there with her hands in her lap and a dazed, distant look in her eyes. She quit talking in our group chat and, eventually, stopped coming around all together. Me and her were actually going to start our first semester the same college, but I never saw her around and quickly realized she had either changed schools or decided to not go at all.

B said that she told her aunt and uncle what we told the police: the whole break-in/car crash song-and-dance. She explained Dolly away as just more plain-Jane bad luck with the 'mountain lion' simply killing Dolly the same night.

At first I thought B hadn't been as affected, like the rest of us. I guess that's just what I wanted to believe, anyway, wanting to comfort myself more than B. When I was in the hospital, and I first opened my eyes from the sedatives, no one was in my room. I had drowsily scanned the scene, thinking ‘ugh, hospitals’ and that I couldn't wait to be home. But then B came and it was like nothing had happened at all. She gently punched my shoulder and said "Nice to see Sleeping Beauty's awake." before throwing her arms around me. I think you may have already guessed this, but I loved B. Or, at least, I think I did. As much as a kid-adult knows what love is, anyway. She threw her arms around me, and I put my arms around her and my chest felt so warm and full like it could burst and we were in a shitty hospital room where it smelled like antiseptic and the lights were achingly bright and we had just exited Hell, but suddenly I could stay there forever and die happy. If I could just stay there, at that moment. I would be content. 'This,' I thought, 'Please, God, don't let this end.'

But all the good things *do* end, don't they? And they ended almost immediately after that. When together, though our banter remained superficially the same it seemed... fake. A veneer of joviality hiding the hurting thing underneath. B did try to bring up the incident several times, but I always deflected. Then, I really fucked up.  About two months ago, B brought up the... events of that summer and she wasn't to be swayed. It was somber and uncomfortable, and I wanted things to be back to where they had been before. So. I made another joke. Something along the lines of, "Hey, at least Joey fucked off, right? If getting chased by a demon from Hell is all it took, I would'a talked to the Devil sooner." I laughed big and exaggerated but immediately knew that had been an extraordinarily stupid thing to say.  B's expression just kind of shut down-- from intense and serious to carefully blank. The last light of our friendship dying. I waited to get a tongue lashing like the one Joey had received.

But B didn't do that. She didn't laugh, or cry, or yell. What she did was so, so much worse. B simply looked at me for a long moment, then got up and walked away without another word.

We haven't spoken since.

\*\*\*

I want to forget this, all of it. My friends, the cat, Dolly's sightless eyes. The pain, the hurt, the terror. And I've tried. God, I've tried. I finished my first semester of college with every night being spent either wasted or hunched like a goblin over a library computer and the second semester is following in it's footsteps.

But I can't, because... well the title really says it all, doesn't it.

We didn't kill it. Distracted it. Maybe even scared it a bit, I like to think. But we didn't kill it. And it's still out there. Once I got home from the hospital I started digging through news stories along Highway 67 and the surrounding areas looking for the beast's trail. I sure did find it. Like Bob had said, there was a rash of livestock killings. But I wasn't interested in that. I was looking for unsolved murders or unidentified bodies that, at least from what I could discern, echoed our... encounter. But I didn't find that-- just tragedies from domestic violence incidents and greed. Besides, Bob hadn't been too worried about the mountain lion either and rumors weren't circulating about a ravenous man-eater, so I don't believe the beast was going after humans before.

But it is now.

That's kind of why I'm writing this, I guess. If our encounter had been a one-time thing, occurring simply because we had stumbled upon the monster, I would have kept the truth to myself. But about a month-and-a-half ago a man named David was reported missing by his wife. The couple lived just off Highway 67. He had walked down their half-mile driveway to get the mail and never came back. One week after that, campers found his ripped and mangled body about eighteen miles away from his property. While the police speculated the old man had died of a heart attack and that the coyotes had gotten to him afterwards, the body was in too bad of shape to definitively determine a cause of death. And, y'know, they had no fucking idea how he had gotten eighteen-fucking-miles from his mailbox. I suspect this to be the work of our monster. Even if it's not, the thought keeps me awake.

I don't understand. What made the change from animals to people? It's not the absence of prey in desperation or anything of the like. Another thing: why didn't the beast kill me and B in the woods when we first came upon it? It's taken down seven-hundred-pound cattle, ripped apart wood and steel like it was tissue paper, kept speed with B's Focus even when she had the gas pedal touching the floorboard, but it couldn't catch us as we fled across the fields? Bullshit.

I think of Amarai batting around a poor mouse, allowing it to get away before chasing it down again. She was bored and she wanted a new game to play.

Is that all we were? A new game?

I am not going to be the one to kill the beast. I'm not Rambo or John Wick or anything. Frankly, I'm a coward and I plan to never enter the state of Texas again. All I can do is warn people. And by writing this, that's what I'll do.

There's a monster following along Highway 67 through Texas, we didn't kill it and now it's hunting people. Be wary. Be alert. Stay safe. I don't know what would be capable of taking this thing down.

This is all I have to tell you guys. My leg hurts and I'm so, so tired. So let me end with this: Find somebody you love and hold on to them with all the strength you can muster. Have the good conversations but also have the tough ones too. You don't want to be left with things unsaid.

Because there are much, much worse things than tough conversations. A wolf lurks outside your door. It lurks outside for all of us, waiting for the porch light to turn off, for the last candle to be extinguished, to take away both the good and the bad times. Until there is only darkness, and fire, and the beast between both.
