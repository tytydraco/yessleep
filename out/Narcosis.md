The depth gauge on my wrist computer read 84 meters. That’s roughly 275 feet of crushing black water, channeled through a limestone throat so narrow that my stage tanks scrapped against the rock with the screech of metal on bone.

We were in the "Gut"—a restriction in an uncharted cenote system somewhere beneath the jungle floor, miles from the nearest extraction point. My dive partner, Beckett, was ahead of me. I could see the yellow tips of his fins and the violent, jerky halo of his primary light cutting through the absolute dark.

We were pushing too hard. I knew it. He knew it. The dive profile was aggressive, borderline suicidal for a two-man team on open circuit, but the survey grant was expiring, and Beckett had this feverish obsession with connecting the Gut to the main aquifer.

"Check pressure," I mumbled into my regulator, the words gargled by the mouthpiece. I tapped my light against my tank—clank, clank—the signal to check in.
Beckett didn't respond. He kicked harder, his fins churning up the silt layer on the floor.

That’s the cardinal sin of cave diving. You do not touch the bottom. The floor of a virgin cave is composed of aeons of settled clay and organic decay. If you disturb it, you trigger a silt-out. The water turns from crystal clear to chocolate milk in seconds. You lose up, down, and the exit.

A cloud of brown fog rolled backward from Beckett’s fins, swallowing me.

I cursed, purging my buoyancy compensator to halt my forward momentum, trying to back-fin out of the cloud. But the tunnel was too tight. The silt enveloped me. My light beam died, scattering into a useless, blinding white wall against the particles suspended in the water.

"Beckett!" I shouted, forgetting he couldn't hear me.
I reached out for the guideline—the thin nylon string that was our only physical link to the surface. My hand grasped empty water.

Panic, cold and sharp, spiked in my chest. I swept my arm left, then right. Rock. Rock. Water. No line.
Beckett must have cut it on a jagged edge, or pulled the wrap loose when he surged forward.
I was blind. I was deep. And I was breathing air at a depth where nitrogen acts like a narcotic. At 84 meters, the partial pressure of nitrogen affects the brain like four or five martinis on an empty stomach. They call it the Martini Effect. It slows your reaction time, kills your fear response, and replaces logical thought with a fuzzy, euphoric acceptance of death.
I forced myself to hover. Breathe. In. Out.
The sound of my own respiration was deafening. Hiss-click. Roar. Bubble-rumble.

I checked my SPG (Submersible Pressure Gauge). 110 bar. Maybe twenty minutes of air at this depth if I stayed calm. Five if I panicked.

I decided to wait. Sometimes, if the current is right, a silt-out clears. I floated in the brown void, feeling the immense weight of the rock above me.
That’s when the narcosis started to whisper.
It wasn't a voice. It was a feeling. A sensation that the water wasn't water at all, but syrup. I felt warm. The crushing cold of the subterranean river faded into a pleasant, numbing heat. I felt the urge to spit out my regulator, just to see what the water tasted like. It probably tasted like iron. Like blood.

No, I told myself, clamping my teeth down on the rubber mouthpiece. That’s the narc. Stay sharp.
Then, I saw the light.

It was faint at first, a diffused glow penetrating the silt cloud ahead of me. It swung rhythmically. Left, right. Left, right.
Beckett.
He had turned around. He was coming back for me.
I tapped my tank again. Clank. Clank.
The light stopped moving. It hung there, suspended in the murk, maybe ten feet away.

I waited for him to signal. The standard "OK" sign. The "Thumb Up" for terminate dive. Anything.
The light just hovered.

I finned forward cautiously, my hand outstretched. The silt was thinning slightly, settling into the heavy, stagnant layer below. As I moved closer, the silhouette of a diver emerged from the gloom.
It was Beckett. He was hovering vertically, his trim perfect, his arms dangling at his sides.
"Beckett," I thought, relief washing over me. "Line. Where’s the line?"

I flashed my light in his face, signaling for attention.
Beckett didn't react. He just floated there, drifting slightly in the weak current.
I got closer, within arm's reach. That’s when I noticed his gear.

His BCD (Buoyancy Control Device) was unbuckled at the shoulder. One of his side-mount tanks was hanging by a single hose, dangling like a severed limb. And there was something wrong with his bubbles.
There were no bubbles.
He wasn't breathing.
I froze. The narcosis fuzz in my brain suddenly sharpened into a distinct, jagged horror. If he wasn't breathing, he was dead. He had stroked out, or an embolism had hit him, or he’d panicked and held his breath.

I reached out to grab his harness, to shake him.
Beckett’s head snapped up.
It wasn't a slow drift. It was a mechanical, violent jerk, chin to chest, then snapping upright to look me dead in the eye.

My light beam hit his mask.
His eyes were wide open. Not the vacant stare of a corpse, but the hyper-focused, dilated stare of something predatory. But it was the mouth that froze my blood.

Beckett didn't have his regulator in his mouth. It was floating behind his head.
He was smiling.
At 84 meters, the water pressure is roughly 135 pounds per square inch. If you open your mouth without pressurized gas pushing back, the ocean forces itself into your lungs with the force of a fire hose. You drown instantly. Your lungs collapse.
Beckett was grinning at me, his teeth white and perfect in the harsh LED light. His lips were pulled back to the gums. No water was rushing in. No bubbles were rushing out.

He just hovered there, mouth open in that impossible, wide rictus, staring at me.
Narcosis, my brain screamed. This is a hallucination. You are narced out of your mind. He’s dead, and your brain is drawing a face on the tragedy.
I squeezed my eyes shut, counted to three, and opened them.

He was closer.
He hadn't finned. He hadn't moved his legs. He had simply... translated through the water. He was inches from my face mask now.
I could see the pores on his nose. I could see the tiny capillaries in the whites of his eyes.
And I could see that his throat was moving.
A rhythmic, pulsating bulge traveled up his neck, under the skin, like a swallow working in reverse.
He reached out.

His hand, gloved in black neoprene, didn't grab my harness. It reached for my face. Specifically, for my regulator.

I slapped his hand away. It felt solid. Real.
"Get back!" I screamed into my mouthpiece, the sound muffled and useless.
Beckett’s smile widened. It stretched.
The corners of his mouth didn't stop at the molars. The skin of his cheeks tore—not with a rip, but with a wet, silent separation, like pulling apart raw dough. The smile kept going, splitting his face all the way to the ears.

Inside his mouth, there was no tongue. There was no throat.

There was a pale, translucent tube. A fleshy siphon, pulsating, lined with rows of tiny, translucent cilia that beat against the water.

It wasn't Beckett. It was something wearing Beckett.
I kicked. I slammed my fins into the rock floor, exploding the silt again, not caring about visibility anymore. I needed distance. I back-pedaled, scraping my tank against the ceiling of the cave, hyperventilating.

Hiss-Hiss-Hiss. My regulator delivered air in frantic bursts.
I shone my light into the brown cloud.
Nothing.
Then, a sound.
Sound travels four times faster in water than in air. It comes from everywhere at once. You can't directionalize it.
Click. Click. Click.
It sounded like wet stones banging together. Or teeth snapping.

I checked my pressure gauge. 50 bar. I was burning through air. I had to leave. I had to find the way out.
I turned 180 degrees, putting the silt cloud behind me, and swam blindly into the darkness. I prayed I was heading back toward the entrance, back toward the wider cavern where the sunlight might filter down.
The tunnel narrowed. My chest scraped the floor. My tanks scraped the roof. A restriction.
I didn't remember this restriction.
Wrong way. You went the wrong way.

I tried to back up, but my tank valve caught on a limestone protrusion. I was stuck.
I twisted my hips, trying to wiggle free. The rock held me fast. I was pinned, 84 meters down, in a stone coffin.
Click. Click.
The sound was louder. Closer.
I twisted my head, looking back over my shoulder, back down the tunnel I had just squeezed through.
My dive light cut a cone through the clear water behind me.

Beckett was there.
He wasn't swimming. He was crawling.
He was pulling himself along the floor using his elbows and knees, moving with a jerky, insectile coordination that shattered the human anatomy. His legs bent at the wrong angles. His back was arched backward, concave, like a broken doll.

He stopped ten feet away.
The silt had settled enough that I could see the details. The "Beckett" suit was loose now. The neoprene was wrinkled, sagging. Whatever was inside had shrunk, condensing itself.

The head hung limp, chin on chest.
Then, the neck snapped up again. The smile was gone. The lower jaw was gone. It hung loose, detached, flapping against the neck.

From the gaping hole where the mouth used to be, the siphon emerged. It was longer now, thick as a python, pale and translucent. It weaved in the water, sensing the current. Sensing the vibrations of my panic.
I saw movement inside the siphon. Something dark and solid was being pushed up from the chest cavity, traveling through the tube.

It was Beckett’s dive computer.
The entity spit it out. The plastic puck clattered against the rock floor.

Then it spit out a wedding ring.
Then a tooth.
It was purging the inedible parts.
I struggled against the rock, thrashing, screaming into my regulator until my throat tasted like copper. My SPG read 10 bar. Two minutes. Maybe less.
The entity resumed its crawl. Scrape. Drag. Click.
It didn't have eyes anymore—the eyes had rolled back into the skull, replaced by the glistening white meat of the parasite—but it knew exactly where I was. It knew I was trapped.

It stopped right at the soles of my fins.
I felt a hand—or what remained of a hand, the bones crushed together into a grappling hook—clamp onto my ankle.

The narcosis hit me then, a final, tidal wave of warm indifference. The terror didn't vanish, but it detached. I watched it happen from a distance.
I watched as the Beckett-thing pulled itself up my legs. I felt the weight of it settling on my back, pressing me down into the silt.

I heard the hiss of my regulator delivering the last dregs of air. The needle hit zero. The next breath was hard. A vacuum.
I looked at the rock in front of my face. There was a fossil there. A tiny, spiral shell, millions of years old. It was beautiful.

A face appeared next to mine.
It was the mask. Beckett’s face, hollowed out, draped over the entity like a wet rag. The siphon pushed through the torn cheeks, seeking a seal.
It pressed against my regulator.
It wanted in.

I realized then why it had worn Beckett. It wasn't just camouflage. It was a pressure suit. It needed a shell to hold its form against the weight of the deep. And Beckett’s shell was broken. It needed a new one.
I spat out my regulator.

Not to fight. But to welcome the water. To let the ocean crush my lungs before it could take them.
But the water didn't come.

The siphon latched onto my open mouth instantly. It tasted like rot and ancient, stagnant brine. It formed a perfect, airtight seal over my lips.
And then, it pushed air into me.
It breathed for me. A recycled, foul gas pumped from its own bladder into my lungs. It was keeping me alive.
It needed me warm. It needed me fresh.

As the siphon began to slide down my throat, expanding to fill my esophagus, the narcosis finally offered me a small mercy. I started to laugh.
I couldn't make a sound, plugged as I was, but my diaphragm spasmed in a silent, shaking loop.
I was going to be the new suit. And we had a long swim back to the dark.
