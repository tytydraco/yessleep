I am typing this real time. It is 8:09pm. I live alone, but have a a cat named Teddy. Teddy is an all terrain type of cat. In a nutshell, he comes in and out as he pleases. That's all you need to know.


I heard Teddy doing his usual pawing at the door. I was about to get up and let him in but a glanced and noticed he was asleep next to me. At first I thought maybe it was just some stray begging for food. But then this little fuck meowed. 

I shit you not, it sounded IDENTICAL to Teddy. Teddy has a very unique meow that only he can do. 

It sounded as if a recording was being played of his meow. But this also has me questioning, what if it *is* him. 

Then what the fuck am I sitting next too? Frankly I'm not too sure, I'm gonna move into the bathroom real quick before he or it wakes up to be safe.

Ok I am in the bathroom. Whatever is outside is being relentless, just like my Teddy. I considered going to the bathroom with a window, but I've read enough stories to know that bitch will fuck me over and get in through the window. I also covered the mirror with a towel. I got no idea what I'm dealing with after all.

Oh shit, whatever was sleeping with just woke up. It's 8:19pm. The pawing and meowing at the door has been going since 7:54pm. I hear it walking about the house.

It's 8:21pm. The pawing and meowing stopped.

Dammit, there's a paw coming up under the bathroom door. Idk what it is. Wait. NO! I JUST HEARD A CATS SCREECH! TEDDY NOOOOOOOO!

I think he's dead, he's fucking dead. That little fuck killed my fucking cat. I'm certain. It's 8:34. There's a pawing under my door. Oh god... there's blood. There's fucking blood. What the actual fuck. 

Hold up, that blood.. it's not red.. it's lavender? What in the 7 rings of hell is that? Is that even blood? Ugh god help! It smells noxious!  I hear squelching, round 2 is about to ensue. 

All I hear is crashing, hissing, and squirting. Something just crashed against the door! I want to look under the crack, im gonna stick my phone under the door and snap a recording. 

I swear you won't believe me when I say this. I see Teddy, fighting some demon esk... thing? It's oozing that lavender liquid. Lemme break down what it looks like. 
It has 5 eyes, teeth i can only describe as sharpened human teeth, it is the size of a malnourished 2 year old. It has paws and claws, but it looks like human skin is stretched over them, and it's entire body. Like a big cat wearing a human skin suit. But it has a human head? It's head was twisted upside-down, and it's body contorted in ways I can't even describe. If your wondering how Teddy is fending off gods forgotten creation that Satan stole, he is a HEFTY maine coon cat. One time he brought home a dead chiwawa that I think he killed. This bitch is savage.

Oh shit. It stopped. It's dead silent. It's 8:51. I see a black paw under the door with that lavender shit. Praise the lord. Im coming out of the bathroom.

JESUS. Teddy is pretty beat up, this thing I THINK is dead. I'm getting a gun and firing some rounds off in it. Good thing I live away from people.

Ok, I just loaded off some rounds in this ugly fucker. Time to take Teddy to the vet NOW. I'll update you guys on his condition.
