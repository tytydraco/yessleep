So, yeah, the title pretty much sums it up. I (32M) work as a cop in a mid-sized city. My partner, Sam (30M), has been riding with me for about four years now. We’re tight. I’m talking family barbecues, godparent-to-my-kid kind of tight. If you’d asked me last week if I’d ever lay a hand on Sam, I would’ve laughed in your face. But then... well, then Tuesday happened.

We were responding to a 10-78 call (that’s a backup request for you non-cops). Dispatch had been all kinds of weird lately, flooded with calls about “violent disturbances.” People biting each other, attacking pedestrians and it sounded like bath salts 2.0. We get to the scene, and it’s chaos. People screaming, running, and yeah.. biting.

Sam and I did what we always do: wade in, try to restore order. Only, this time? It was different. These weren’t your typical bar-fight drunks. They didn’t go down easy. Tasers barely slowed them. And one guy? I swear I broke his arm, and he didn’t even flinch.

Anyway, during the scuffle, some woman sunk her teeth into Sam’s forearm. Deep. I managed to pull her off, and we cuffed her, restrained her, since she kept gnashing her teeth like a feral dog.

Sam waved it off. He’s tough like that. “It’s just a scratch,” he said, even though it was very clearly not just a scratch. I had seen bites before, but the blood seeping out looked to be a darker sludge than a simple drool that one would expect. 

Fast forward to later that night. We’re back at the station, filling out paperwork, and Sam starts looking... off. Sweaty, pale, not cracking his usual sarcastic jokes. I told him to go home, but he waved me off again. “I’ll sleep it off,” he said.

Except he didn’t go home.

Around midnight, I hear this weird, guttural noise coming from the holding cells. I go to check it out, thinking maybe one of the perps from earlier is having a seizure or something. But no. It’s Sam.

He’s standing in front of the cell where we locked up the woman who bit him, staring at her like a lion eyeing a steak. She’s snarling at him, her hands clawing at the bars, and he’s just... standing there, drooling.

“Sam?” I said, keeping my distance.

He turned around, and holy shit, I barely recognized him. His eyes were bloodshot, his veins looked like black spiderwebs under his skin, and there was something wrong with his face, like his jaw wasn’t sitting quite right.

“Hungry,” he muttered.

I backed up. “Dude, you need a doctor. Right now.”

But he wasn’t listening. He lunged at me, teeth bared, hands out like claws.

Instinct kicked in. I clocked him with my baton. Hard. He dropped like a sack of bricks, but even on the ground, he kept snarling, his fingers twitching like he was trying to crawl toward me.

I called for backup, but the radio was static. Turns out, the station was already empty. Most of the force had been dispatched to deal with similar “disturbances.”

So there I was, alone in the station with my unconscious, very possibly zombified partner and a feral woman locked in a cell.

I tied Sam up with some zip ties. Hands, feet, everything. It felt wrong, but what else was I supposed to do? Let him eat me? I locked myself in the break room and waited until morning.

When the sun came up, I ventured out. The station was eerily quiet. Sam was still tied up, but his breathing had stopped.

Here’s the thing: I don’t know if he was actually dead, or if he just... changed. I didn’t stick around to find out.

So now I’m holed up in my apartment, trying to figure out what the hell is happening. The news is calling it a “viral outbreak,” but I know better. This isn’t just a virus.

And yeah, I feel like absolute garbage. I knocked out my best friend, tied him up, and left him to... whatever that was. But what was I supposed to do? He tried to eat me.

AITA?
