I was never one to make friends easily, and I had reached the age of twenty with only a few numbers saved on my phone. If, as some middle-aged relatives had complained, making friends as adults was indeed difficult, I could only do my best in youth, and hope that I'll have enough friends left to avoid a dull retirement. Perhaps this is why I wished my reunion with Arya had gone better.
    
One of my principal hobbies was walking while listening to music. In such a small town like mine it was common to catch familiar faces on a walk. I had seen some of my friends from highschool repeatedly: sometimes acknowledging them, sometimes detracting. Once, however, the choice was taken from me. Arya tapped my shoulder from behind and I removed my airpods to greet him. I had seen him with two others from highschool a few times, and once we talked briefly. This time we spoke of the same things: how we were doing, feeling, thinking, how college was going; we compared colleges, weathers, cities. The mundane topics were soon exhausted and Arya gave no hint of walking away. "I have only ever seen you alone," he said, "and I'm determined to change that." I remembered him as a spirited boy who was destined to grow into a worldly man, the sort who can talk with anyone about anything. I didn't object. "Where do you want to go?" I asked, "a cafe, perhaps?"
    
"A cafe?" He exclaimed with a touch of ridicule. "You're a classy person." I could not figure out what that meant but I took it as negative and we started to walk with no particular destination. We walked and talked; the conversation splintered.  Now we talked of literature, now, of politics. I discovered that Arya was an avid reader who, fond of Russian novels and Eastern philosophy, was also an admirer of our own poetry. He could recite poems in several languages with ease and confidence. He held strong opinions about the literature of the world. Russia had the best novels in Europe; England, the best poetry. Shakespeare was good; Milton was better; an obscure poetess from Iraq was by far better than both.
    
The current spoilage of Kurdish literature was of course not to be endured. But so long as "we" were plodding for democracy, there could be no organized support of "our" aspiring artists. At any rate, we strolled around the same subjects, and I noticed that my friend wished to circle the roundabout and move up from the second street, going back to where we started. I made no comment and followed his lead. Until then, I had been trying to dodge the attitude that no two Iranians could avoid in a conversation for long, that of asserting that the country was doomed and we had no future. Arya, however, gracefully connected his dissatisfaction with modern literature to the graver knots in economy and security, and we were forced to revisit the same themes with added gloom.
    
Once again we reached the roundabout. So passionately was he expressing his woe that he moved down mechanically to cross it and we took the same course a second time. Once again I made no comment. "Could there be a duller way of reuniting with a friend?" I thought to myself. Walking had been my hobby but that day I felt strangely tired. Arya's part in the conversation grew solitary. I suggested we sit down on a bench by the sidewalk. I must have yawned at least twice. When we sat down, Arya lost some of his enthusiasm and asked whether I was still in touch with anyone from highschool. I said I wasn't. He looked sympathetic and proceeded to list all the people he was still calling and meeting. He did not realize that some of those names were not from highschool but I had no energy to correct him. After this we had almost nothing left to talk about. We sat awkwardly and alternately yawned.
    
The sun was setting. He answered a phone call, and I made one to my mom to ask if she needed anything. She did. I had to excuse myself and we departed without exchanging numbers. I went home and lied down to rest my eyes for a while. I had my dinner late that evening.
