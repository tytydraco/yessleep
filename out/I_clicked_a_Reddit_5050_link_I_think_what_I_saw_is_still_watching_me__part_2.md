I wish I could tell you that the night ended there—a scary video and a panic attack, washed away by a pint of Jack. But I’d be lying if I said that was all.

The next morning, I woke up nursing a brutal hangover on top of barely any sleep. My eyes burned, the bitter, sour taste of bile clung to the back of my throat, and my head pounded like a war drum. I knew I needed to eat, but I had zero motivation to cook. Eventually, I mustered the strength to get dressed and stumble down to the local deli.

I ordered my usual: sausage, egg, and cheese with a hashbrown tucked in, plus a black coffee. The cashier stared at me—probably because I looked like hell—but said nothing, just rang me up. A few minutes later, she called my name. I stepped up to grab my sandwich, and she was staring again.

Uncomfortable, I tried to break the tension. “Sorry, I’m kind of a mess. Had a long night.”

She blinked and suddenly seemed to snap out of it. “Oh! I’m sorry, sir. I don’t know why, but I could’ve sworn I served you earlier this morning. Weird. Anyway, have a great day!”

She brushed it off and returned to the register like nothing had happened.

If I weren’t so hungover, I might’ve asked her what she meant. But I felt like death, and I knew if I didn’t get food in me fast, I’d redecorate the deli floor. So I made a beeline for my apartment. And that’s when things started to get weird again.

My computer monitor was off—but the webcam light was on.

How long had it been like that? Had it ever turned off? Was it recording?

I reached to unplug it, bumping the desk in the process. The screen flickered on. My stomach dropped.

“What the hell is going on!?” I yelled.

The video was still playing.

That same face—way too close to the camera—filled the screen. It began speaking again, completely unfazed:

“Your brain has two options. The first is to try to make sense of it. This often presents as déjà vu, or a vague feeling that you’ve seen something before, even though you haven’t.”

It paused.

The silence dragged on—long enough to make my skin crawl.

Then it continued.

“The second option is fear. Most will call it paranoia, or maybe agita. A vague discomfort at seeing a stranger you think you recognize. They’re the smart ones.”

It smiled then.

That awful, hideously perfect porcelain smile—impossibly white teeth, too many of them.

“My question for you is this: next time you see one of us, how will you respond? Will you fear us… or brush us off, like that cute girl at the deli? Oh well, we won’t have to wait much longer to find out…”

It chuckled, and the screen cut to black. Then it rebooted to a blue screen.

All I could hear was the pounding of my heart, thudding like it was trying to escape my chest.
