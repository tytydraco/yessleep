I have struggled with anxiety for as long as I can remember. Many things have been recommended to me throughout the years as aid. Breathing exercises, outdoor walks, meditation, sensory items, etc.

The one thing I truly came to enjoy and found to actually help in a "quick almost fix" sort of way was a hot bath. 

While it certainly hasn't cured me of my anxiety disorder, it has helped so much. I was overjoyed when my husband and I purchased our home that included a massive garden bath in our master bathroom. 

After a long, hard day - I look forward to coming home, lighting a couple of my favorite candles, dumping in some essential oil infused bathsalts/bathbombs and sometimes bubble bath liquid and just relaxing. 

I sink into the warm water and close my eyes and just breathe. At least, that's what I did until this started. 

I need to backup a bit to explain. When we purchased our home, I was so thrilled. I invited over family and friends to show off our new home. Hosting wasn't something I ever thought I'd enjoy until we made this big time purchase. 

All was well until I invited Bethany over. 

I met Bethany many years ago at a Summer Camp my family sent me to thinking it'd help me make friends. Bethany and I both were socially awkward and clicked right away in the lunch hall on day two of the week-long camp. 

Much to my parent's dismay, Bethany was the only friend I made that week. We stayed in touch by mail, social media and texting and visiting whenever we could throughout the years. I text Bethany shortly after moving into our new home and invited her to visit if she was ever in the area as she had moved a few states away. 

A little over a month after moving in, Bethany came to town for a visit and agreed to join me for a tea date at our house. I was so excited as I opened our front door and saw her grinning at me with her arms outstretched for a hug. I hadn't seen her in a while and after a good hug, she stepped in. As I was shutting the door, I heard her make what I call a "shiver" sound.

"Your home is freezing!" She exclaimed as I tried to take the sweater she was wearing. Granted, it is somewhat still winter time here, but we keep our house at 72 degrees. "I can turn the heat up!" I answered quickly as I stopped trying to pull her sweater away from her. 

"That won't help." She stated as she walked further into our house and looked around with her arms folded across her chest.

"Someone died here." she stated flatly before I could question her further. I froze beside her, not sure what to say in response to that. Now is a good time to explain that Bethany is a self-proclaimed medium. I've known this since I met her all those years ago. While I've never doubted her, I've never really experienced her gift in person.... other than stories she has told me and one crazy oujia board experience.

"That was never mentioned by our realtor." I finally answered after a couple minutes of silence. "I wouldn't expect them to volunteer that information." She answered as she wondered up our stairs with me following behind her. 

I stayed quiet as she wondered down the upstairs hallway.  She walked into our bedroom then stopped outside of our bathroom entry. "Here." She stated in her same flat tone. 

"What now?" I asked standing beside her again. "A woman." She answered. "A young woman. She died in the bathroom." She said in a quieter voice. She didn't move. She just stared into our bathroom. Right at our bathtub. 

The rest of the visit is honestly a blur to me. I know I somehow shrugged off what she had said and was able to get her to come back down stairs to the lower level in the kitchen.  I brewed tea and we chatted over the steaming cups for the remainder of her visit. I do recall asking her to stay in one of our spare bedrooms while she was in town to which she refused. 

The only other clear memory I have is her hugging me goodbye at the front door and telling me to be cautious. "That woman is angry!" She exclaimed in my ear right before pulling away. She then walked out, got in her car and drove away. 

Shortly after her leaving, my husband arrived home from work. I told him about my visit with Bethany over the burgers he had picked up for dinner that evening. I told him about what she had claimed happened in our bathroom. 

"No offense," Jason (my husband) started, "but I always thought she was a little.... weird." He finished. He must have seen my disapproving expression as he started again "She's nice and all but I assure you, our house is death free." He stated with a smile. 

I smiled back at him as I got up to clean up the remainder of our take-out dinner. 

"Go take your bath." He said as he kissed me on the head. " You deserve to relax after the day you've had." He said sweetly. I climbed the stairs to our room and into our bathroom. 

I started my bath, checking to be sure the water was hot enough for my liking. After undressing and lighting my candles, I lifted my left foot into the water. As I submerged my body into the hot water, the earlier conversation with Bethany flooded my brain. 

I was being paranoid, I thought.  I stretched out in the long tub and closed my eyes as I slid down and rested my head on my bath pillow. 

I felt my tense body relax as my mind wondered to other things. Much happier thoughts. This was interrupted when I felt a cold chill come over me. At first, I was confused. The cold feeling started at my feet then slid up the length of my body. It was then that I realized it wasn't just a chill. The water was suddenly ice cold! Just as I was about to sit up and grab for my towel, I felt myself being pull under the water. 

The cold water surrounded me as my head went under.  I began fighting to sit up again but something was holding me firmly in place. Images filled my head. 

A woman with long dark hair, she was crying and fighting. Water splashed around her but the heavy weight on top of her kept her from emerging. I felt someone viscously yanking me by my hair towards the bottom of the tub and pressure on my chest keeping me in place. As the images of the woman faded from my mind, I felt myself being jerked upright. 

"Jesus, Sam, what happened???" I heard the familiar voice of Jason ringing in my ears. 

I coughed and felt the, once again, warm bath water splashing around me as I furiously smacked at the water with my arms. My eyes flew open as I looked around my familiar bathroom until my eyes landed on a very concerned looking Jason.

"Sam???" He said as he pulled me against his warm body. I coughed more as I relaxed into his embrace. 

"Where is she??" I called after I finally felt that I could speak. "Who??" He said as he pulled me back from him to look into my eyes. 

"The girl!" I sputtered, "she was here!" I cried as tears streamed down my face. 

"Damn you, Bethany!" Jason stated angrily as he pulled me out of the bath completely. He wrapped me in my towel and carried me into the bedroom and laid me on our bed. 

A short time later, I was sitting up on the edge of our bed wrapped in my robe as Jason paced the floor infront of me. 

"Bethany is not allowed back in this house!" He exclaimed as I kept my head down and my eyes glued to the cream colored carpet that covered the floor of our room. "We are going on two months living here with no issues and after she shows up, I find you nearly drowning and shouting about some woman!" He continued.

As I remained quiet, he stopped pacing and knelt down infront of me as he took my hands in his, "she scared you and then scared me when I found you just now, Sam...." I looked in Jason's pleading eyes and agreed. 

For several nights after, I would only shower with Jason when he was home. Bethany had sent a couple texts reaching out to check on me. I ignored them all as I wasn't ready to face that whole situation.

Today was a grueling day back at the office for me. I arrived home before Jason as usual and decided I needed a bath. It has been days since the whole incident and I decided I was done being fearful. Bethany had simply psyched me out and it wasn't right. 

I went up to our bathroom and ran a hot bath. I lit my candles and poured some rose scented bathsalts in the water. 

As I stood beside the tub and looked down into the water to step in, I froze as I realized I wasn't alone. There, in the water, was an almost translucent looking woman laying in the tub. What I could mainly makeout was long dark hair sprawled out and two lifeless looking gray eyes staring directly upwards.

Before I could scream, those two lifeless gray eyes jerked to look directly at me.
