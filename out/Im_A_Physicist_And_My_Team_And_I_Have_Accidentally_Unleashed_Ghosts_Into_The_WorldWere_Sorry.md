The existence of ghosts is *almost* an undeniable reality, and scientists and paranormal investigators have long sought to bridge the gap between the living and the dead.

With the advancement of tools and technology such as phones, EVP recorders, and thermal imaging, it's allowed humans to catch glimpses of the spiritual realm. However, the breakthrough we had been waiting for, actually came in the form of a new type of energy â€“ one that promised to reveal the *full* extent of the afterlife.

I'm a physicist and have dedicated my entire adult life to unraveling the mysteries of the supernatural. My research over the years led to the groundbreaking development of a revolutionary device known as the Spiritual Energy Generator(SEG). The SEG was designed to harness and amplify the energy required for ghosts to manifest in our world.

As the SEG neared completion, my team prepared for the first live demonstration of the device. The anticipation was palpable as we gathered in the laboratory. The air was thick with both excitement and fear.

"Okay," I said with a nervous huff. "Here we go."

With a flick of a switch, the SEG sprang to life. It emitted a soft, pulsating glow that filled the room. As the energy levels began to surge, a hushed silence fell over us all. Suddenly, a faint figure materialized before our eyes, its form wavering like a mirage in the desert.

It was a ghost.

We watched in awe as the ghostly apparition hovered before us, its presence mesmerizing.

"I'm going to make contact." I announced.

I stepped forward, my heart pounding with a mixture of scientific curiosity and a tinge of fear. I reached out to touch the figure, but as my hand drew near, the atmosphere suddenly shifted.

"Wait, something's not right!" Shouted one of the technicians. "The SEG is spiking!"

The entity let out a terrifying wail that reverberated throughout the lab, flooring all those present.

Panic and screaming ensued as the SEG's controls malfunctioned, its energy output spiraling out of control, sparking and spitting out more and more entities.

*My God...What have we done?*

It seemed as though the longer the ghosts were in our world, the stronger they became, gaining more and more ectoplasm until eventually, they began to manifest real skin. What we had conjured was something beyond our understanding, something beyond the living and the dead. These entities were neither ghosts, humans, nor zombies, but a terrifying amalgamation of all three, and now, fueled by their newfound energy, they began pouring out the laboratory and spilling into the world.

I did what I could in saving this data, all of which will be uploaded to many social media platforms, then grabbed the camera for one last recording...

"The SEG has worked in ways we could've never imagined...The boundary between the living and the dead has been breached, and it does not favour the living...these, *things,* are angry...angry and dangerous...I'm afraid the consequences of our actions are still yet to come...my team and I will be dead by the time you find this...

...We're sorry..."
