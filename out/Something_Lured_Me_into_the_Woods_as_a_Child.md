When I was an eight-year-old boy, I had just become a newly-recruited member of the boy scouts – or, what we call in England for that age group, the beaver scouts. It was during my shortly lived stint in the beavers that I attended a long weekend camping trip. Outside the industrial town where I grew up, there is a rather small nature reserve, consisting of a forest and hiking trail, a lake for fishing, as well as a lodge campsite for scouts and other outdoor enthusiasts.  

Making my way along the hiking trail in my bright blue beaver’s uniform and yellow neckerchief, I then arrive with the other boys outside the entrance to the campsite, welcomed through the gates by a totem pole to each side, depicting what I now know were Celtic deities of some kind. There were many outdoor activities waiting for us this weekend, ranging from adventure hikes, bird watching, collecting acorns and different kinds of leaves, and at night, we gobbled down marshmallows around the campfire while one of the scout leaders told us a scary ghost story.  

A couple of fun-filled days later, I wake up rather early in the morning, where inside the dark lodge room, I see all the other boys are still fast asleep inside their sleeping bags. Although it was a rather chilly morning and we weren’t supposed to be outside without adult supervision, I desperately need to answer the call of nature – and so, pulling my beaver’s uniform over my pyjamas, I tiptoe my way around the other sleeping boys towards the outside door. But once I wander out into the encroaching wilderness, I’m met with a rather surprising sight... On the campsite grounds, over by the wooden picnic benches, I catch sight of a young adolescent deer – or what the beaver scouts taught me was a yearling, grazing grass underneath the peaceful morning tunes of the thrushes.  

Creeping ever closer to this deer, as though somehow entranced by it, the yearling soon notices my presence, in which we are both caught in each other’s gaze – quite ironically, like a deer in headlights. After only mere seconds of this, the young deer then turns and hobbles away into the trees from which it presumably came. Having never seen a deer so close before, as, if you were lucky, you would sometimes glimpse them in a meadow from afar, I rather enthusiastically choose to venture after it – now neglecting my original urge to urinate... The reason I describe this deer fleeing the scene as “hobbling” rather than “scampering” is because, upon reaching the border between the campsite and forest, I see amongst the damp grass by my feet, is not the faint trail of hoof prints, but rather worrisomely... a thin line of dark, iron-scented blood. 

Although it was far too early in the morning to be chasing after wild animals, being the impulse-driven little boy I was, I paid such concerns no real thought. And so, I follow the trail of deer’s blood through the dim forest interior, albeit with some difficulty, where before long... I eventually find more evidence of the yearling’s physical distress. Having been led deeper among the trees, nettles and thorns, the trail of deer’s blood then throws something new down at my feet... What now lies before me among the dead leaves and soil, turning the pale complexion of my skin undoubtedly an even more ghastly white... is the severed hoof and lower leg of a deer... The source of the blood trail. 

The sight of such a thing should make any young person tuck-tail and run, but for me, it rather surprisingly had the opposite effect. After all, having only ever seen the world through innocent eyes, I had no real understanding of nature’s unfamiliar cruelty. Studying down at the severed hoof and leg, which had stained the leaves around it a blackberry kind of clotted red, among this mess of the forest floor, I was late to notice a certain detail... Steadying my focus on the joint of bone, protruding beneath the fur and skin - like a young Sherlock, I began to form a hypothesis... The way the legbone appears to be fractured, as though with no real precision and only brute force... it was as though whatever, or maybe even, whomever had separated this deer from its digit, had done so in a snapping of bones, twisting of flesh kind of manner. This poor peaceful creature, I thought. What could have such malice to do such a thing? 

Continuing further into the forest, leaving the blood trail and severed limb behind me, I then duck and squeeze my way through a narrow scattering of thin trees and thorn bushes, before I now find myself just inside the entrance to a small clearing... But what I then come upon inside this clearing... will haunt me for the remainder of my childhood... 

I wish I could reveal what it was I saw that day of the beaver’s camping trip, but rather underwhelmingly to this tale, I appear to have since buried the image of it deep within my subconscious. Even if I hadn’t, I doubt I could describe such a thing with accurate detail. However, what I can say with the upmost confidence is this... Whatever I may have encountered in that forest... Whatever it was that lured me into its depths... I can say almost certainly...  

...it was definitely not a yearling.
