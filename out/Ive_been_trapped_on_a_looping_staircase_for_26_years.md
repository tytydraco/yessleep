Have you ever heard of the impossible staircase?

The Penrose steps, some call them. Maybe you’ve seen drawings of the concept before. A staircase of four flights in a continuous square loop, forever ascending or descending, depending on which way you walk. A stairway with no beginning, no end, and no escape.

*An impossible object*, I would have told you before I moved into my new apartment building. *An optical illusion*.

That was twenty-six years ago.

I’ve lived on the stairwell longer than I lived on Earth. Stuck in a place that defies reality’s governing laws of time, and Euclidean geometry, and *morality*. Eternal imprisonment is only half as terrifying as the things I have done in here.

January 23^(rd), 2000. That was the day I went missing from the real world. The day I entered an infinite spatial loop. Do you know what that does to the mind? If you do, tell me, because I don’t. I’ve no idea what it does to the body either. For nearly three decades, I haven’t eaten or drunk, and I haven’t earnt any fresh creases on my skin; other than a few scars from my run-ins with *them*. My reflection, according to the dusty screen of this old computer monitor, looks the same as it did in 2000.

The only evidence time *has* passed is that fragments of the real world have slipped into this betwixt dimension, which spans no more than a short second-floor hallway. Apartment doors are left ajar from time to time, so I creep inside to see how the interiors have changed. I’ve never seen another person; only ever echoes of their material things.

Let’s start from the beginning.

There *was* a beginning. A before-all-of-this.

Before infinity.

Before Hell.

I should’ve known better than to move to this side of town. The apartment was only dirt-cheap because its complex sat not more than a few hundred yards from the old Hawthorne House: a decrepit mansion in which four children went missing on New Year’s Eve, 1999. Nobody wanted to move to a neighbourhood dressed with *Missing Person* posters on telephone poles and lampposts, so the landlord offered low rent.

We took him up on the offer.

Number 11 was a nice-enough flat for the era: white stipple ceilings and a geometric rug with rucks from the sofa we were hastily shoving into place; it was blisteringly cold on moving day, so Zane and I were desperate to hurry along and settle down with some hot drinks.

“That’s what we’re missing,” I said once we’d finished. “Tea bags.”

Zane shivered. “I’m not going back out there, Annette.”

“And I wouldn’t dare make you, my little princess. You just get cosy on the sofa.”

“You’re not seriously going out to the shop just for tea bags?” he scoffed.

I blew him a kiss from the front door. “I’ll be back in a jiffy.”

That was the last time I saw him.

The last time I saw another human face.

Zane and I had already walked up and down the building’s main staircase about two dozen times that day, lugging boxes and bulky furnishings up to our second-floor flat. I knew the stairway well by that point. Separating the second and first floor were four flights of ten steps, hugging the flat walls of a rectangular brickwork column which ran through the centre of the building. Four flights down to the first floor. Another four flights down to the ground floor.

This time would be different.

Starting at the second floor, I started downstairs, as I had so many times that morning. I turned ninety-degrees after each flight of steps, skirting around that large red-bricked column, only to eventually arrive at—

Not the first floor.

“What the fuck?” I said aloud.

I’d descended four flights of steps to end up in a hallway with three apartments: 10, 11, and 12.

Number 11.

Our apartment.

I was back on the second floor.

Back where I’d started.

Now, twenty-six years is a long time, so it’s hard to remember exactly how I rationalised what had just happened. I only remember scurrying to the end of the hallway, facing the same stairwell, and trying again. Following the four flights of stairs around the brickwork column to arrive at—

The second floor.

Again.

I remember my reaction that time. I leant against the wall and clutched my chest. A panic attack, though I didn’t realise that at the time; such things weren’t as commonly discussed back in those days. Given the piercing pain, I ignorantly called it a stroke, and an interrupted blood flow to my brain might’ve explained the supposed hallucination I’d just experienced. I prayed Zane would find me in the hallway and phone for an ambulance.

But I didn’t collapse. My heartbeat slowed after ten minutes or so. I was drenched in sweat, but very much alive, according to the painful pinch of the wrist I gave myself.

I wanted Zane.

I shakily unlocked my front door to find an apartment pitch-black inside. It was only a little after noon.

“Zane?” I called out.

He didn’t respond.

But something did.

Something that shone from the black interior of my apartment. Not natural or artificial light, but two glassy spheres; like unlit bulbs with filaments emitting a grey and muted glow. And as those two murky lights climbed upwards, I became certain that they weren’t lights at all.

They were eyes.

Encased in the vaguely humanoid silhouette of a figure who rustled noisily towards me, agitating the tiny carpet strands with limbs as undoubtedly impossible as the Penrose stairs. Its glassy eyes neared me, looking less like unlit bulbs and more like waning stars; illusively small and dim, for I saw they burnt with such tremendous clarity and purpose beneath their foggy sheen. Those eyes bore intent cold and calculated. An intent too cosmic, and colossal, and clouded for my apish brain to see.

That terrified me.

*Why?* I thought in horror.

I remember letting out a pathetic whimper as I slammed the front door on the abomination, and it hammered against the other side, sending a paranormal shockwave across the corridor. I toppled backwards and scraped my forearm against the brickwork, painting it with blood; painting myself with a scar that would never fade.

Then I turned and ran. Not downwards this time, but upwards. I had to try something different.

Back up the four flights of stairs I went, eyes welling as that creature rattled my apartment door below. I felt almost hopeful that I might escape to the third floor as I went around the last corner of the column up to—

The second floor.

I sobbed, but I was grateful when I realised the noise had stopped. There was no monster bursting out of Number 11. The door was standing ajar, and light was spilling out of our apartment. I found myself facing not the Glassy-Eyed Man, but an apartment still filled with unopened cardboard boxes; only, the flat looked different, as if some time had passed. And atop the box by the door was a stack of posters labelled:

*Missing Person*

Each bore a photo of me and information regarding my disappearance.

“Zane?” I called out again.

Nobody there.

I hoped.

So, now you understand my prison. I have endured so many terrible things these many years, and I've tried so hard to reach out to the world, but only crumbs of reality appear here; this is the first computer to materialise in all that time. I would tell you more about the things I have seen and done, but things change constantly in this cursed place, so I’m trying to be quick. I ask the same of you. If this message makes it out into the real world, please help me. Please reply ASAP.
