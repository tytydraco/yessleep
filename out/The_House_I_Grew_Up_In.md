# [The House](https://i.imgur.com/UBNJNxC.jpeg)

In the early 2000s my parents decided they wanted to get out of the city and move into a rural Yorkshire village, so we did just that. I was around 9 or 10 years old when we first moved into this 1800s built house. The house was initially a vicarage where the vicar from the church would live. He would've had servants that lived on the grounds or in the house. It was with the church up until the 70s when it was purchased by a care company that housed troubled/insane children.. After that, we bought it.  
  
From the start we experienced things that were unexplainable.. I've never really shared these memories with people before, I made a brief imgur post once but never really went into detail and I thought some people here would find this interesting.  
  
So here we go..

# [My Bedroom ](https://i.imgur.com/Q9kBUAD.jpeg)

I was 9/10 years old when we first moved in, my brother was in the Navy and my sister was living in America on a work visa so it was just me, my Mum and my Dad. 

Because of this, they told me I could pick any room I wanted as my bedroom. I walked up the long staircase and went room to room, nothing stood out to me until I entered the room in the top left corner of the picture. I noticed light was shining in through both windows, the wooden floors felt warm on my feet and there was a strange sweet smell in the room.. I picked that one because it felt like the brightest and warmest room in the house.

Later that night, I was laying in bed trying to sleep when I all of a sudden heard muffled crying. I figured it was the TV as my parents were in one of the rooms below me. I closed my eyes and tried to ignore it.. It started to get louder and louder. The muffled cries turned into a girls voice saying "Help me, please.. help me" and she began wailing in a distressed tone.. I opened my door and noticed it sounded like it was coming from down the landing (hallway) and around the corner at the back of the house upstairs.  
  
I sprinted down the stairs so fast it felt like I was floating.. [I burst into the living room frantically crying and trying to talk but everything was coming out chaotic. ](https://i.imgur.com/voaA2CS.jpeg)

My parents finally calmed me down and I explained what I had heard. They told me it was just my imagination.. It was an old house, I wasn't used to it and I was a kid.. They figured it was all in my imagination.. I started to believe them.. It probably was. I never heard it again.

Fast forward to 6 months later, my sister has been home for a few months from America and she had picked a room down that corridor. One night we're all sat at the table talking about the house and my sister looks at my mum and says "can I tell him?", she nods. 

My sister tells me the first night she came home, she heard a little girl screaming for help.. she said it sounded like it was right outside her door.. She said she opened the door and the sound seemed to be in the corridor but it sounded like it was coming from different sides.. She couldn't figure out where it came from. I went white. We both heard it. It wasn't my imagination.

We later found out that when the house was a vicarage, the whole quarter where my sister was staying had burned down at some point during the 1800s and was rebuilt. Could not find anything related to deaths but from what we read, that side of the house was the servant quarters so whoever that was asking for help was probably a servant in the house who was trapped.

I remember one weekend morning around 10am, everyone was downstairs, we had just eaten breakfast and I walked back upstairs to go play PS1.. [As I walked past my parents bedroom](https://i.imgur.com/frCsKXK.jpeg) door, I noticed a man stood in a long black coat, with a top hat on.. He was just stood at the end of my parents bed.. I stepped back and he was gone.

Right next to my room was a toilet, with an old wooden door with a big keyhole. We didn't have the key, it didn't come with the house and was likely lost many years ago. I was the one that mainly used that bathroom because it was right next to my room. One night before bed I went to pee and the door wouldn't open.. I tried twisting the handle and it wouldn't budge. I tried pushing against it with my shoulder to force it open and then I heard a loud deep growl.. from what sounded like a dog.. Like before, I ran downstairs and explained everything.

My parents came back up with me, the door opened freely.. Nothing there.

After hearing that, I started occasionally seeing a 4-legged shadow come through my door.. it would run like a dog on four-legs and go into the wall and vanish. Made no noise or anything and it would happen so quickly.

Months after this started happening, my Dad was landscaping the front, he was digging out a spot for a big stone sundial they had bought, when he found bones.. lots of small bones and two skulls. They were from dogs.. After he found those, I never saw that shadow again..

Above my room was two rooms (the attic) and around the attic was the eves (little tunnels around the inside of the roof, used for storage). The left room still had a writers desk in there which we figure belonged to the vicar as it was very old. It had a small safe that we never opened. The right room was larger and empty. (at that time).

At night, I would hear something being dragged across the floorboards in the attic above my room. It sounded heavy as shit.. Almost like metal chains. This would happen multiple times a week. I never could figure out what it was.

The year before we moved out of the house, for 7 days straight, my stereo system would turn itself on. Usually, when I turn it on, it defaults to the same local radio station.. but for some reason, for 7 days, at the exact same time every day, it would turn on at full volume, maxed out volume, and it would be just white noise. No radio station. The first night it happened I figured my older brother was fucking with me but that idea soon died when I realized the next few nights it happened, we were all together eating dinner. After the 7th day, a Sunday, it stopped doing it. Never did it again.

The last thing about my room, remember how I said it had a sweet smell? Well, turns out when it was a care home, there was a young man that lived in my room. He would walk to the local bakery and buy sweet cakes and he would bring them back home and hide them inside his wardrobe or under the floorboards. We found this out from someone that used to work there. That person found us through a mutual friend.. I checked under every board I could and never found anything.. but my room always smelt so good.

# [The Dining Room](https://i.imgur.com/EsiocNw.jpeg)

The dining room was a formal dining room where we would eat for special occasions like Christmas or New Year. For birthdays, etc. One Christmas my Auntie & Uncle had flown over to spend time with us. It was late so we had all gone to bed. My Auntie said she heard music coming from downstairs, she figured my mum had possibly drunk to much wine and fell asleep with the stereo on.. That wasn't uncommon when they were together.. They both loved drinking wine lol.

She made her way down the stairs and thought it sounded like it came from the dining room. As she got closer it was definitely coming from there so she went in.. The stereo system was at the opposite end of the table to the door, so you had to walk around the table to get to it. It was on the bottom of a pine shelf unit. 

As she walks up to it, she noticed the display isn't lit up blue, like it is usually when it's on but the music was loud so it had to be on. She goes to unplug it.. and it's not plugged in. Confused.. She turns around and walks out the room and the door slams behind her. She said she went straight upstairs, got into bed and pretended like it never happened.

The same thing happened to my sister a month prior but my mum and sister hadn't told anyone.

# Driveway

The dining room had laaaaarge windows all the way around the side/front of the house to let in a lot of natural light.. but at night time it felt like someone was watching you from the side of the house.. It actually always felt like that on that side of the house. Even walking down the long drive way, there was always a weird uneasy feeling from that side. I don't know what it was but every one would feel it.. It actually became somewhat of a running joke with us.. we would invite people over and ask them to walk down the driveway by themselves, anyone that did it always said they felt like someone was watching them from the right side of the house..

That side of the house has a long archway made from trees. That archway was apparently where the horse + cart would come in from the street, it would go alongside the house and to the back building which used to be a stable. (which became a living space for my grandparents).

One night my mum and sister came home from grocery shopping, they parked the car along the side of the house because that's where the door to the kitchen was. As they popped the boot (trunk) they say something sprint across the front of the car into the trees towards the right side of the house.. They screamed so loud I heard it even with headphones on.. My Dad ran outside and they were frantic. He calmed them both and they couldn't explain what they saw.. They said it didn't look human. After that we always went to the store as a family to make them feel safer.

# [Kitchen](https://i.imgur.com/rBahnzX.jpeg)

The kitchen was the hub of the house really. It's the place we would all gather multiple times a day. We're a close family and always would sit around the table, drink tea and just chit-chat. Would always eat dinner around the table together.. but sometimes after dinner we would just chill and talk for hours.

One night, it was just me and my sister. We had all eaten dinner, my parents went to watch TV and my brother went out for the night. Me and my sister just chilled at the table and talked. While we were talking, we both saw a kitchen drawer slowly open.. stuff started just hopping out of it.. like something out of a cartoon.. I'd see a pen just flip out.. Another pen.. Some batteries.. A rubber band ball.. 

By this point we had been in the house years and we were used to seeing weird shit so we just ignored it. This because a regular occurrence.. I'd see glasses slide across kitchen counters, salt n pepper shakers get knocked over, etc. 



# The Basement

Right outside of the kitchen was a corridor, along that corridor was a door that opened up to a thin walled in basement. Back when the house was built, the basement was the entire size of the house, it was gigantic. It had been used as a wine cellar in later years before being completely concreted in. This thin basement passage was the subject of many conversations over the years.. Why was it concreted in? Was it for stability on the floors? Was it for another more sinister reason? 

One thing we did notice, was whenever we opened that door, the dogs would not go anywhere near it. My Dad used to get them to follow him right up the the door, and as soon as he pulled down the handle and swang the door open, all the dogs would scatter.. Like their life depended on it. It was the strangest thing I've ever witnessed.

These weren't just any dogs.. It was 3 dobermans, a german shephard and a cockerspaniel.. They usually were not afraid of anything.. Especially together.

My Dad used to use the basement as a party trick, he would show guests how the dogs act when he opens the door.. and then he would dare them to go inside and close the door and be in the dark for as long as they can.. Most people would last 2-3 minutes before getting creeped out.

  
I have other stuff that happened but that's just some of it I thought people might find interesting.
