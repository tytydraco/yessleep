Hey, R/nosleep . It's me, Nate, yeah. You know, the same Nate who got stuck in whatever kind of hell the Consumers come from. It's... been quite a while. As is customary, here are the other posts I and Sarah have made up until now.

First off, I'm okay, though I cannot say that I am in one piece, broken arm is a bastard, still got the marks of  a black eye and my back still aches and creaks. I've been spending the last few days recovering, guess we can all thank Sarah for ensuring that I wasn't dead, at least. 

For those wondering, Sarah did write up her story. I think I will paste it tomorrow night, but I'll be sure to give some details to you all first on what happened, how Sarah and I have been and what little information I've been able to glean from this absolute mess of a week and a half. 



I don't want to say it, but Sarah is schizophrenic, paranoid schizophrenic to be exact, sometimes she sees or hears things that aren't entirely real. I only learnt this as apparently she had not taken her medication in her rush to meet up with me. I only started to piece that together after she rambled at me about the phone conversation we had and how I had vanished when she was waiting. Which... neither of those had happened. 

Though, from what I can tell, I believe it's the trauma she's suffered that has caused it. I think it's also why she seemed to immediately focus on trying to make up whatever mistake she made with romantic affection, which I personally am not one for. At least to me, it sounded as if she wanted to throw herself onto me to somehow make things better. But sex, love, a partner, it doesn't heal any of the wounds I've been dealt, not for me, a partner doesn't make it go away, it never will. 

Maybe, if we get to know one another better, maybe I'd be open to it, but for now, for me? There's nothing anyone can do to help. This is now something I have to deal with, try to find a solution to. 

I didn't leave the store, on the night that Sarah slept in, because the old man came back. Right after closing hours, right when it was just me, looking over the security computer, the freak broke loose. 

There's no way I wasn't being oblivious, the smell, the noise in the vents, food going missing in the stock room. He- *IT.* Was in the vents, growing more and more distorted whilst I and everyone else thought nothing of it, putting it up to a rat dying in the fans and the smell being the decay. 

I'll put a space between this sentence and the experience, to prepare my mind to write down what I recalled, what I had experienced, all right when the breakroom vent's service hatch smashed open.



I had been halfway through logging the images caught on the cameras when I heard the foldout tables in the breakroom snap, as the sound of metal on metal rang in my ears. I wasn't the fastest, but I did immediately stand up and move over to check. Maybe if I had not, it would not have seen me and given chase. 

The old man had become what I can only describe as a human mosquito, a fat, blubbering stomach that sloshed with foul juices that dragged behind it, whilst its limbs had become longer than even the cap wearing Consumer. It's face had lengthened too, with a tube like snout that lapped at everything around it. But it's eyes... dear god. They were so human in appearance, it juxtaposed the entire thing, made it a horrific mix of familiar and alien. 

For once in my life, I felt the real fight or flight response, no freezing up, no standing, I bolted. It lurched after me in response, buzzing like a swarm of wasps as it practically waddled along. 

Something that distorted, that bloated in the areas it was should not have been that fast, as every time I looked back, it was just a bit closer. As soon as I was out of the office and into the deli department, it was already crashing onto the top of the serving counter, knocking over cardboard holders of meat sticks and freeze dried jerky strips. When I bolted through the fruit and veg pagoda, it cut me off and forced me to run back around and down the sports aisle. 

Every turn, every aisle, it kept either trying to cut me off or succeeded and forced me further off. The more it chased me, the more it seemed to slow, as if it was running out of energy. I was too, I wasn't fit like Sarah or able to endure the pain like Kyle could on a long 12hr shift, I was just a checkout manager. So when I ran out of energy to run, it began to make a B-line for me. At that point, it was scampering on all fours. 

In my blind but silent terror, I had run into the pet and haberdashery aisle. The one aisle with solid tools besides the cooking supplies aisle. I didn't think, I grabbed hold of the closest thing with weight, a trowel and threw it at the Consumer. It hit, but only stunned it. I do swear, though, that I saw it's bones crack and writhe under it's skin when the trowel smashed into it's impossibly thin forearm. 

As soon as I saw that it had pulled back, I knew I could fend it off. So I did the one thing I had never done in my life, I destroyed a shelf by throwing everything everywhere. 

Trowels, gloves, shears, watering cans, plant mix, a random masterlock package. It did the job, it caused the Consumer to flee, as the weight of a plant mix bucket caused it's bloated gut to rupture. It immediately turned to flee, trailing behind it was it's brown and blackened intestines, which writhed with maggots and other insects. I vomited, as I saw it, but I should have tried to hold it in, as it stopped dead in it's tracks and turned to look right at me. It then grinned with its round mouth. 

'Much to show you.'

It grabbed me. I don't know how, I don't know why, but it was able to snatch me up like a ragdoll, running with me like a prize in one of it's hands. It forced me to unlock the door and practically threw me into the other world's version of the shopping centre. 

Maybe it intended to knock me out, maybe it didn't, but I know that I blacked out, only to awaken to my phone vibrating violently. Sarah had been trying to call me. Problem was, when I answered, it was static. 

Now, this is where my account and Sarah's differ. I was not chased, I didn't see any of the Consumers for a whole day, as I shambled about, lost and confused, but I did find myself holing up in a rundown two story banking building a couple blocks away from Willy's. There was some water, it tasted like dirt, but it was viable, there was also some stale but intact crackers stored in a desk on the highest floor, which did require me having to make a leap of faith. But it paid of. 

Two days, that's how long I was in there. Can safely say I was boiling alive the whole time, as I kept my winter gear covering me at all times. The air in that place is toxic, feels like you're being dissolved from the inside out every time you breathe it in.   

I didn't sleep once, so I was awake for nearly 72hrs. It was not fun, nor was seeing Sarah enter the place, go right past the building, vanish, come back again and then seemingly have a conversation with... something else. 

When she called me whilst in that world, my phone did not ring once. And when I tried to ring her, when she was walking right past the building... something that was not her responded to me. 

It sounded like her, if you put a country goth's voice through at least three levels of static grain. Despite the fact that she had a Samsung phone, with a great mic. 

I'll leave the transcript for you all, I am not sure what to make of it. 

'Hey, where are you?'

'...'

'Nate?' 

'Is that... you, Sarah?' 

'Of course it'd be. Who else.' 

The voice was too unnatural already, but the response was too out of character, too. 

'I'm... not sure.' 

'Look for landmarks.' 

'...'

'Is it along Myrtle Street?' 

That was the street I was on, the voice kept asking things, but I knew very well that it was not Sarah, that it was not human. 

'I can't help you if you won't cooperate, Nathan.' 

She never used my full name in conversation.

'I just want to help you..!' 

I hung up. But then I got a call from that number again, even though Sarah should surely have left the other world by then, as it was 5:32am. I chose to ignore it, another one appeared. 

It kept calling me, for five hours. When it stopped, I then realised that there was a new landmark to the local area, that perhaps I had simply not noticed before, until now, being as deprived of sleep as I was. There was a large broadcasting tower that craned over the nearby buildings. I thought that it was me being delirious, but I caught a brief glimpse of the security cameras on it having human eyes where the lenses should be. 

Whatever the other world is, it's a consumerist hell scape. Trash everywhere, spoiled food acting as soil, smog choked clouds and no nature as far as the eye can see. The air and rain is not even needing mention, considering everything that's been detailed by Sarah. 

I was on the 63rd hour of sleep deprivation when I saw the shifting trash ghillie suit of Sarah's shuffling down the street. At that point, I was seeing all kinds of things, but something about it made me decide to head down, even if it wasn't Sarah, or someone who could help. 

There are moments in our life that we could so easily fix with foresight, but in that moment, I lacked it. I blundered out and shouted, causing Sarah to dive for cover in her trash suit. 

A blinding spot light fixed onto me, as I heard thousands of tonnes of metal creak and bend. I saw Sarah's face go pale under the suit as I froze and turned. 

That tower I mentioned, the one that I had originally thought was not noticed due to my deliria was in fact moving. It craned over buildings like an inquisitive titan, inspecting ants. Spotlights from its various mounts shone on me as camera eyes stared at me. 

I heard dozens of Consumers begin chattering in surrounding buildings, as the metallic behemoth began to move. My phone began to buzz again. This time, I had no choice in whether I could answer or not, the call began immediately, Sarah's phone too, speaking as the tower's way of communication. 

***'We tried to help you. To save you. You denied us. You are bad for profit. Consider this your termination.'*** 

Maybe that's cheesy now, thinking on it, how it said it, like some supervillain, but what was not in any way amusing was me being rammed into by a pole of metal. 

It hit me in the shoulder and then the face, clipping me and throwing me across the road. Sarah responded in shock, shouting my name. I could barely get up, I was so damn tired. She pulled me out of the way as a spire of metal smashed into the pavement I was just lying on. 

Even if Sarah's account had faults, she saved me, the real her, not the false her that the tower tried to make me think was real, she was prepared, at least, for the most part. 

The hit from the metal limb of the tower had shattered the bones in my forearm and left the right side of my face bruised and swollen. But there was no real time to dwell, as Sarah continued to run and drag me along. Problem was, it was 4:26am. 

I think she had been tricked into going all the way to the Beverly Hill. So by the time she was back, moving through the streets when I had seen her, it was too late for either of us to get out at the usual time. 

For some reason, I do not remember much else, but Sarah managed to practically carry me as she ran back. The Ghillie Suit stank, but I didn't care, apparently I had passed out by the time she threw herself and me right under the roller door on the strike of 4:31am. 

I woke up at the local hospital after that, having apparently slept for a whole two days after everything. My face was half bruised while my arm was now apparently 45% metal wire and wrapped in the thickest plaster cast I had ever been forced to wear for a broken bone. 

Apparently Sarah dragged me to the ER after we left the store, though she could not convince the reception that she didn't have any hand in what had happened to me, causing the cops to be called on her. She's currently been under strict supervision, or else risking being sent to a psych ward for a believed psychotic break due to not taking her medication. It was hard to convince the officers she was not the one to hurt me, as well, could I trust them to not also try and throw me in a psych ward too? 

It took a lot of talking, a lot of lying, lies I had to excuse with playing up a concussion. But the story that managed to get her and I out of hot water was that I had taken a nasty fall while out at her place, we'd been watching the stars and when we went to get down, I fell, broke my arm and slammed my face into the dirt real hard. 

From how the officers and medical staff seemed to act when Sarah came in, I have to wonder if perhaps they have something against her, as they asked no questions before they tried accuse her, rather than try and figure out the truth first. Maybe the police here just suck? Don't know... but I do feel sorry for Sarah. But I did have to pull away when she tried to kiss me as she was crying, it didn't feel right. 

I also learned about the lie she told my mother... apparently the entire neighbourhood now thinks I'm dating Sarah, due to my mother being unable to not gossip. But I don't fault her. 

As of now, though, appearances have to be kept up and David is demanding a meeting tomorrow between him and I, to explain my absence. I think he knows, because after finishing a light duty shift today, he looked at me with a softer gaze than usual (usually he looks annoyed or pissed), as if he pitied me. 

Jason has been a real prick, though, trying to make jokes at my expense when he gets the chance, even though it constitutes workplace harassment. Though I know I can't talk back, it'd just make things worse. 

I haven't really read over what you all said on Sarah's post, but if you have any advice, I'd love to hear it... no, I ***need*** to hear it. Forewarned is better prepared, or however that saying goes. 

Otherwise, I'll see you all around, Nate, regrettably, signing off.

PS: Never before have I appreciated Coal more than I do now, having a warm black blob of a cat purring and snuggling up to me after all I've been through is probably what I need to heal... that and getting a hug from Sarah, hugs are fine, just the whole relationship thing isn't appropriate at the moment.
