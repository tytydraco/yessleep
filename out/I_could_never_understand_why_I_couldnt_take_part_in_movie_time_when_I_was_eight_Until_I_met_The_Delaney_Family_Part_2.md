When I was eight years old, I saw something I shouldn’t have. 

You.

Saw.

Something.

You.

Shouldn’t.

Have.

Those were the exact same words coming out of my [brainwashed](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15r6jav/i_could_never_understand_why_i_couldnt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2) boyfriend’s mouth in a low robotic drone as his siblings fought to hold me down. It felt like drowning. Like my mind and body were being plunged down, down, down into the black, into the nothing I couldn’t escape. And deep inside that nothing, was none other than a spark of red light that entranced me, dragging me towards it. “Freida.” Spencer Delaney finished in a breathy murmur, his voice a lot harder and fierce despite lacking humanity. 

I had come to several realizations in the moments it had taken for the Delaney family to secure me to their fifties-style couch. Spencer Delaney was not my boyfriend and had simply lured me to their family's house. I saw his real identity in the shoe closet, hanging from an ID tag amongst piles of belongings from other victims. Had this boy been a victim of these people too? Was Spencer a product of this house, or did his role in the family go much deeper? His voice was still raw in my ears, that word scraping the back of my mind. But I refused to let it register. 

I refused to admit it was real. In the back of my mind, suppressed memories were slowly resurfacing, my eight-year-old self drawing closer and closer to that tantalizing illumination of blood red. I shook my head, but whoever these people were, this is what they wanted. They wanted me to go back to eight years old. Back to being drowned in rainfall and throwing my elementary school doors open. 

The wet splat of my shoes taking slow steps inside pooling darkness, and my curiosity pulling me towards the intense red light of the video room. 

I took a step back, my body jerking, my brain retracting from the splintered memory. 

In a mismatched blur of everything and nothing, I was aware of the family living room, and how cosey it was. There was definitely a theme—fifties sitcom style. The ancient television looming over me flickered, buzzing static filling the screen. I could see it in the backs of my eyes, starry across my vision, and slowly creeping into my mind. 

My head spun and I swung it to the left and then the right, trying to focus on something else; on Mrs Delaney standing off to the side, watching her children’s handwork. I couldn’t see her expression, but I knew she was smiling. Mrs. Delaney matched the room, dark yellows and browns catapulting us into the past. I tried to make sense of what she was wearing, out-of-date clothing that somehow fit her perfectly—but the static from the TV was taking hold. 

“Well done, Delaney family!” 

That inhuman voice screeched from the television, stiffening my body. Luna forced my head forward, and I had no choice but to stare at the screen. The woman had already spoken, already said words that felt foreign, alien, almost upside down when I tried to take them in. Whatever they were, however, I couldn’t recall them. 

She started to clap, the static around her mimicking her applause. 

“You have successfully acquired the target.”

She turned towards me, her smile widening. “Hello, Freida! We have reasons to believe that you may be a ʍopɐɥs! Under the United States government law, ʍopɐɥs are considered national threats and must be destroyed to protect our great country!”

I thought she was going to continue before the screen flickered, and I found myself watching what looked like an old-school videotape. The screen was bright blue, with white text coming down in a star-wars-like roll. 

“Welcome!” The voice this time was male, emotionless. “If you are watching this video, you are aware of the existence of ʍopɐɥs. We do not know where these entities came from. However, what we do know is how to protect ourselves and our families. Step one,” the static came back, this time buzzing in my brain, a nest of bees burrowing into my skull. “Ask the question: Am I looking at a human?”

I remember fighting back at that moment, the video flashing out of existence when I blinked before my eyes were forced open again. This time I was seeing two blocky silhouettes on the screen, a human and a question mark. “Does what I am looking at have an upside-down face?” the voice asked. The question mark morphed into a person with its features twisted. 

“If so, please lock yourselves and your families inside your house and do not come out under any circumstances. If the entity is inside your house, you are already compromised. Please do your best to destroy yourselves and your family. If you are near a sharp weapon, a simple intrusion into the brain will reduce pain. If any family members begin to show the following symptoms, please exit your house. Symptoms include: ˙ʇɥƃıs uo ʎoɹʇsǝp ǝsɐǝld 'ʍopɐɥs ɐ ǝʌɐɥ ʇou sǝop ɹǝqɯǝɯ ʎlıɯɐɟ noʎ ɟI :ǝʇou ǝsɐǝlԀ ˙ʍopɐɥs ou puɐ 'ʇno ǝpısuı ɹɐǝddɐ llıʍ ʇɐɥʇ uıʞs 'uʍop ǝpısdn ǝq oʇ ɹɐǝddɐ llıʍ ɥɔıɥʍ ǝlıɯs ɐ.” 

The words once again failed to register in my mind, and yet just like before, they felt familiar. The video moved on to steps two, and then three, outlining disposing of these things, as well as how to catch them. When it was finished, the woman was back. 

Her face bled in and out of focus the more I struggled against my captors. Jasper Delaney’s fingernails pricked at my eyelids forcing them open, while Luna Delaney pinned down my battering arms trying to find an anchor, trying to hold on against this thing trying to encompass my thoughts; I felt her presence like a spider web, weaving its way through my skull and nestling inside.

“All right then, Freida! I’ll let the family take it from here! I will still be here if you have any questions, but our agents will begin the procedure.”

Spencer came to crouch in front of me, leaning back and forth on his heels. His expression was empty of emotion, empty of everything I thought he was. His face was illuminated by the TV screen, bleeding static shadowing vacant eyes. I wondered if he was like the woman, a being made from static that shouldn’t exist. But then I remembered his ID tag. Spencer was a real person, no matter how much my mind insisted he wasn’t. His touch was strangely soft, fingers tip-toeing across my cheeks and brushing hair out of my eyes. I hated that his touch felt real. 

If I closed my eyes and used my imagination right, I could take us back before everything went wrong. Before I’d met his psycho family. Though the reality was that he too was a member of the Delaney family. I wanted to scream at him, to ask him why he was doing this, but part of me already knew. 

The family knew what I had seen when I was eight years old. They knew of the existence of the video room. Before I could open my mouth, the woman popped back into view with her eerie, uncanny smile that I couldn’t call human. Everything inside The Delaney Family house was uncanny, like a dream, or a nightmare I had once had—and forgotten. The living room was small and crowded, but it also stretched out, mismatched and colored doors appearing out of nowhere, leading to oblivions and liminal spaces beyond my own foggy, drugged thoughts. There was a bright yellow rotary telephone on the wall, and wallpaper that swam in and out of vision like an optical illusion. The family themselves became progressively less human around me, bleeding into shadows and silhouettes. The only one who looked real at that moment was Spencer. “Is it ready?”

His cavernous gaze lifted, presumably to his siblings. In a flash of dizzying movement, one of them was darting towards the television and turning the dial. I felt a physical force crack its way through my skull, burying itself inside my mind. And with it, the red room drew closer. This time I screamed with no sound. I remembered how to use my body. But I was already under its control. I was aware of my frenzied eye movements slowing down. I could sense rough fingers taping open my eyes so I couldn’t blink. “Now, Freida,” the woman spoke to me through the siblings. Her voice was in my ears, leaking its way into my skull. It had a soothing tone I almost wanted to understand and release myself to. “You saw something at the age of eight years old,” she hummed, and her voice echoed from the others, a symphony drone coming from every direction. 

I could hear it in the Delaney siblings and their parents—and finally, Spencer, who was still sitting in front of me. 

The TV mimicked the words, this time in bursts of color exploding in the backs of my eyes before settling on one singular red dot in the middle of the screen. I was told to look at it, so I did. I wrenched my arms in one last effort to get away, but my wrists were no longer mine—pinned under restraints. The eldest Delaney sibling's breath was in my left ear, while his sister’s found my right one.  

“You saw something.”

The TV and the family spoke as one, and somehow, their words found my mind, skittering like bugs on my tongue. It was impossible to fight, an endless stretch of pure, dizzying light expanding in the backs of my eyes, leaving just the dancing dot.

“I… saw something,” I repeated, entranced by the thing dancing from left to right, up and down, as if it was teasing my next move.

Spencer nodded, coaxing me with his eyes. If I looked closer, it almost looked like the dot was spiraling around his iris. “What did you see, Freida?”

I squeezed my eyes shut, shaking my foggy head. “What are you… doing to me?”

“When you were eight years old, you saw something inside your elementary school,” he pushed. “What did you see?”

“Your name…was Zach.”

I don’t know why I said that. 

It just came out, my mind a muddled blur of drugs and whatever this thing was doing to my head. Seeing him like this hurt me. I didn’t want to believe that Spencer Delaney was just like his siblings—except he had been the one to lure me here with golden retriever smiles and fake promises—with one of them being that he loved me. But that wasn’t him. The boy with my boyfriend’s face, who had been pulled into this family against his will, whose college ID I had found in the Delaney shoe closest filled with what I could only guess was the family’s victim’s belongings, was called Zach.

The dot was like a physical thing drilling into my skull, but I ignored it, or at least tried to, culminating my own words that weren’t that monotone echo being forced from my lips. “You go to UCLA in California,” I managed to push the words out, and even when they felt wrong, twisted, like gibberish on my tongue, I still wanted him to hear them. “Zach Valdez,” I gritted out.

I thought… Well, a naïve part of me thought I could get through to him. Except I didn’t understand how deeply rooted the family was inside him.

“You saw something.”

Spencer repeated the words, and I watched them explode in my vision, a visual distortion throwing me further and further off-kilter.

YOU.

SAW.

SOMETHING.

His voice was harsh and invasive despite the gentle tone, violently dragging me back to a hallway drowned in the dark, and that red light. “Stop,” I whispered, trying to blink against the tape stretching my eyelids. 

But I couldn’t fight against hands that became phantom, my own body becoming detached. The last thing I felt was my own blood sliding in thick rivulets from my nostrils, and my desperate attempt to pull from the restraints. It was like sleeping, falling down those deep, cavernous pits inside our own minds where we abandon the bad and scary.  I was no longer inside The Delaney Family’s living room, but the dot was still in my mind, still prancing around in my skull, TV static buzzing in my ears. I was eight years old once more, my hair damp from the rain. I cupped my hands in the pitch darkness, my frantic eyes glued to the red room in front of me. 

“Hello?” I whispered. “Is anyone… in there?” I took another step, and then another, my heart beating in my ears—my stomach trying to projectile into my throat. “PJ!” I hissed my brother’s name. “Cam?” I didn’t want to go in. The red room was scary, but the light transfixed me. When I stopped at the threshold, the swarming static in my ears grew louder. The door was open, standing ajar, scarlet light spilling out onto the hallway. There was a sound, like music. It was upbeat, and I wondered if my friends were dancing to it. Another step, and my hand was wrapped around the door handle, my body angled so I could quickly peek inside without being caught. 

But something pulled me further until I was over the threshold, blinking into blurry white light flickering from a television screen. The buzzing was alive in my skull, a nest of bees swarming inside my brain. If my own mind had been fooling me this whole time and I did in fact go inside that room—what else had been suppressed?

As if hearing me, the dancing dot still prancing in the backs of my eyelids, pulled me further inside the room. 

“That’s it!” The voice came from the television. All right, kids! Now, this is how to look human! Watch carefully okay! Contract your face like this. I don't want to see any of you cheating!"

The woman’s face twisted into a nightmare, and I remember taking a slow step backward. But I couldn’t stop watching, my gaze glued to the TV screen. “Now, can you tell me what language I’m speaking?”

“English!” The small, shadowed faces in front of me sounded like my classmates, but when I squinted and tried to find my brothers, I was only seeing figures, silhouettes sitting cross-legged. When the light from the TV illuminated a fifth grader's face, who copied the woman’s actions on the screen, I realized I wasn’t looking at a classmate. The bleeding shadow had a little girl’s pigtails and a bright pink dress, but her face was twisted, contorted into a monster. Upside down. 

Her eyes were upside down, her mouth curled and stretched where it was not supposed to be. I blinked rapidly, except the monsters didn’t go away. 

I found my brothers among them. I glimpsed their familiar red hair. When I opened my mouth to scream their names, though, Cam’s face was no longer his, features dripping down his face like his skin was melting. PJ cocked his head, and thousands of eyes blinked back at me. I watched his contorted lips mouth my name before the scream that had been clawing at my throat, inching its way between my teeth, finally split through the music on the television. Somehow, though, the TV kept going, like it didn’t hear me. 

“Very good! How do we stop our faces from falling off? Why don’t I give you a scenario, and you help me fill in the blanks? Ready?” her smile brightened. 

“Okay! So, you are at school, and you get hungry! What do you do?” 

Three colorful answers flew onto the screen, and the monsters with my classmate’s voices giggled, and shouted their answers, only for the woman to shake her head with a laugh. 

“No, we do not—" The woman’s voice was paused mid-way through a cartoon dance routine, and Mrs. Parish, who had been supervising, jumped up from her chair. 

I didn’t wait to see if she too did not have a face. I backed away, falling over my feet and hitting the ground. The teacher was already standing over me, ordering someone to call my mother. 

I didn’t stop screaming until I was away from them, away from that room, back in the hallway, my face pressed against the prickly carpet. When my mom arrived, I let her throw her arms around me. She carried me all the way to the principal's office, set me down gently. 

“What did I say?” Mom paced back and forth in front of my principal’s desk. “I told you this school wasn’t right for her, especially when 99 percent of children…” she trailed off, her knuckles whitening around the coffee she had been given to calm down. “Look.” Mom stopped pacing, her free hand going to her hip. “I expected you to make sure my daughter did not go inside that room. Inside there is not what she is, it’s what I am—and what my boys are. It has nothing to do with her and she deserves a normal life.” She placed her coffee cup on the desk. “So, fix it,” she hissed out. “Or I’ll be taking this matter to the board of education. You’re the only school in this town that accepts humans, and I don’t even know what I’m going to do about middle school!” 

Her hands went to claw at her hair, and for a moment, just a moment, I thought I saw a third eye blossoming on her forehead. I blinked and shook my head, nestling my face into my arms. “I want my daughter to go to school alongside her brothers and not feel like she does not belong,” Mom whispered. “So, if you could perhaps talk with her—"

“There is no need,” The principal cleared her throat, cutting my mother off. “Freida, can you look at me?”

“No.”

Her laugh was delicate, almost coaxing me to give up and find her gaze. “Why is that?”

“Because of the monsters.”

“And where are the monsters, Freida?”

I squeezed my eyes shut tighter. “Everywhere,” I whimpered, “They’re everywhere. I don’t want to look."

She hummed. “Do you want me to make them go away?”

“Yes!”

Until then, I had been too scared to look at either of them. When I did look, the world around me shifted into something I did not understand. 

My principal’s face would fall upside down, mimicking her frown. I could sense them around me, shadows bleeding from the walls and reaching out to grasp hold of me. I didn’t like that they surrounded my mother. I lifted my head to answer her and was aware of my own words asking why there were so many shapes, so many scary things when I opened my eyes, before everything turned to confusing white light, then red light, and then I was back with my Mom, my fingers entangled with hers. I didn’t question my confusion, or that we were no longer in my principal’s office. I kept walking, my gaze glued to the floor. 

There was something at the corner of my eye that I didn’t want to see—and yet when I looked up, there was nothing there. It felt like something had been taken from deep inside me, and all that was left was a deep, dark cavern inside my head. I got the same feeling when I looked at my Mom, bugs skittering up and down my spine and filling my mouth. “What did you see, sweetie?” Her fingers tightened around mine before she stopped, and pulled me to her height, her eyes hard, lips curled. “You have to tell me what you saw, Freida,” Mom hummed. “What did you see in the video room?”

I thought back, scrunching up my face. I got a flash of stepping over the threshold before nothing. I couldn’t remember. “I don’t know,” I mumbled, blinking away the feeling of far too many eyes watching me. They were above me blinking on the ceiling, in the walls, and on the ground. I stepped on them to make them go away, my stomach twisting. “But it was scary.”

Mom’s expression softened, and she pulled me into a hug. “Some things aren’t meant for you, Freida,” she murmured into my shoulder. I could feel something twitching on her face, something moving underneath her skin. 

“¿ɐpᴉǝɹℲ 'ǝɯ puɐʇsɹǝpun noʎ op?”

My mother was not human—and neither were my little brothers. I expected to feel pain and disgust and fear curling inside me, but all I really did feel was… relieved. I finally knew why video time was not for me, and why mom wanted to protect me.

Mom’s voice echoed in my skull, and the dot was back, this time drawing out the reality around my little self. It was still there, in the center of my vision. 

I was not hugging my Mom. I was hugging tendrils of darkness that felt gentle and warm, like home—against my chest. When I lifted my head, the tendrils twitched and squirmed without a face. But the monster held me tighter, whispering reassurances with words that both did not make sense and did. 

I could not shape them on my tongue, and yet they felt familiar. The blinking eyes in the ceiling grew bigger until they were bursting, a cacophony of giggles coming from every angle. 

They were watching me. Cam and PJ. I could see them at the end of the hallway, their necks stretching inhumanly long, rapidly blinking eyes and teasing grins appearing on every wall. The dot started to expand and shrink, and I was falling, plunging from my own mind. When I opened my eyes, I was no longer on The Delaney Family couch. In my blurry vision, I was inside a room made of metal, staring dazedly at a figure looming over me, a human face. Mr. Delaney, wearing a surgical mask. I could see the crease in his mask where he was grinning. 

When he held up a metal instrument, I became aware my body was pinned down to a metal table. I twisted my head frantically, starting to panic, a cry collapsing on my lips, when my gaze found the same television screen flickering from every wall around me. 

Illuminated in its buzzing light were the three Delaney siblings. Luna, standing off to the side, her arms folded across her chest, while Jasper stood next to his father with no expression. I couldn’t see Spencer, only sense him. “We were right,” Luna Delaney spoke up when I was trying and failing to pull my arms from the metal restraints holding me down. “She’s human. The family is not. There is a whole town full of them.” Her voice was that same monotone drawl. “The orders have changed, Father. We are not dealing with just one family.”

“She’s human.” Jasper Delaney nodded his affirmation. “However, there is ʍopɐɥs residual left on her, imprinted by the mother.”

“Following protocol 4.FGT789, it will be removed.” Luna finished for him.

“Indeed.” Mr. Delaney chuckled under his mask, just as the TV’s around me once again flicked on. I got a flash of the woman teaching tiny twitching shadows how to act human inside the red room, and my body jolted against the metal holding me down. As if the static itself from the television was reading my thoughts, the same woman from earlier jumped onto the screen. 

They looked the same. I remember thinking dizzily. How could they? While one existed to hide monsters from human eyes, the other created… my thoughts trailed off when she once again greeted me with a bright smile, and then a mocking frown when I screamed, throwing my body into an arch, and slamming back down on ice-cold metal. She just laughed. 

“Now, Freida. We now know you’re human, so you have nothing to worry about! In fact, we would like to offer you a place in the Delaney family! Isn’t that exciting?” she clapped her hands together. “How fun does that sound? As for your... hmm, let’s call it education! Or re-education!” 

She turned to face the Delaney siblings. 

“Would any of you like to tell me what re-education is?” 

She was speaking to them like children, and I was hit with a realization. If a videotape had existed to help my little brothers disguise their real selves, did another tape exist to create the family? Were the Delaney’s the product of this flickering static in front of my face? Once again, a large dot formed at the center of the TV screen, and something spiked the back of my head.

Mr. Delaney quickly reassured me that it would not hurt, that it was just a small intrusion inside of my skull.

“Re-education,” Luna Delaney spoke up, “Is a practice of education or training to change a person’s beliefs or behavior.” She inclined her head, empty eyes boring into mine. “In this case, the subject will undergo a procedure turning her into an asset.”

“Very good!”

The woman praised the girl, before turning her attention back to me. I think that was her job at that moment, to lure my focus to her, while something cold and cruel was splitting my skull open. I was wide awake, aware of the pain, the agony writhing my body. But I couldn’t move. I could only stare at her face getting closer and closer to me, bleeding into the real world. Music started, and she bobbed her head to it. 

“Then let's get started!” 

The screen burst into dizzying color, and I found myself trying to find her. 

“I’m over here!” This time, she was at the back of my eyelids. “Now, what we’re going to be learning about today are ʍopɐɥs! I know, scary name, right?” She jumped into the air and did a cartwheel, and my lips started to form a smile. I was well aware of my wrists still struggling, though every passing second, while my gaze stayed glued to the screen, and the music dripped into my skull, I stopped struggling. “As an American citizen, we are giving you—yes, you! The chance to destroy these entities!” she stabbed at the screen. “And you can do it all by yourself! You just need to follow several steps!”

I could feel my head bobbing to the music, despite my own blood sticking to the back of my neck and dribbling from my nose, as the pressure on my skull tightened.

I could feel Mr. Delaney’s surgical gloves scraping my scalp and delving deep inside my skull.

“Hey, try not to be distracted!”

The woman’s voice brought my eyes back to her, and she giggled, while my mind filled with fog, and I attempted to chase the dot on the screen, my eye movements following its frantic dance. It went up, down, left, right, up down, left right, up, down...

Left.

Right.

“What did I just say? Come on kids, say it with me!”

“We can do it ourselves.”

The words popped from my mouth, and I imagined a room full of human children echoing my words.

“Exactly! I want you to look super, duper closely, okay? Can you spot the ʍopɐɥs?”

The screen showed a grainy picture of a house. It looked normal at first before I found the pair of eyes staring at me through the window.

It wanted me to point it out, but my arms were strapped down. So, I blinked my affirmation and nodded my head.

“Yes, it is in the window,” The woman appeared at the left side of the screen, mocking a frown. “To tell the difference between a human and a ʍopɐɥs, there is only one thing you have to do,” she pointed to the thing on the screen. 

“If it has a face, it is a human! If it has a face with too many eyes… you must shoot it with no hesitation; ʍopɐɥs cannot be looked at for too long. If you maintain eye contact with a ʍopɐɥs, it will already have you. And you will destroy yourself. Destroying yourself, you simply protrude your gun into the side of the temple and pull the trigger.” 

She turned directly to me, her eyes suddenly far too real. “Again.” She spoke into my head, and I could feel the sleek metal of a gun molded into the flesh of my palm. In the blur of mind, was my mother, her hands tied behind her back. “What do we do if these things do not have human faces?”

“We…”

Mommy.

I felt like a kid again, and despite her upside-down eyes and a smile with too many teeth, I wanted to run into her arms.

Before I could though, I was pulled back. I could hear Mr. Delany speaking to his children. “I am going to start on dinner,” he said. “Please look over the subject. After finishing the initial procedure, I am waiting for her re-education to conclude.”

His footsteps faded away, followed suit by Mrs. Delaney, leaving me with their three children.

Something snapped inside me, and I blinked rapidly, retracting from the video, only for it to pull me back in, a vice grip tightening around my skull.

“Shoot the target.”

The woman’s voice was harsh and demanding, and the image of my mother reappeared, brighter this time.

“I said, shoot the target.”

I pulled the trigger, and my mother’s head exploded into scarlet.

“Again!”

This time, I could see Cam and PJ, the two of them were frightened, their arms raised in surrender. They did not have human faces.

The woman’s expression hardened, her lip curling. “They do not have human faces, shoot them.”

I nodded, my lips moving in time with her words. “They do not have human faces,” I gritted out. “Shoot… them.”  

Another crack of a gunshot, and I felt myself being filled with unimaginable happiness watching my little brother’s drop to the ground.

This time, the gun felt right in my hand, my finger against the trigger was comfortable, easily taking both of them out.

“What do we do to people without human faces?”

I answered without hesitating, my words spaced out as my mind struggled under a crushing weight. “We… kill… them.”

“No, we don’t use that word! Try again!”

“Delete.” The words curled on my tongue, a disdain being planted inside me. “We delete them.”

“That’s right! What else?”

“Even those who resemble our family members,” I remembered the words coming from my mouth without me thinking of them. “We kill them.. to protect this country from the ʍopɐɥs. To protect our families and the next generation of children.”

“Well done!” The woman’s voice trilled. “Why don’t you give yourself a pat on the—”

Her voice splintered into nothing inside my mind when cold fingers removed the tape from my eyes, ripping it away so abruptly, I lost control of my breath. 

The TV screen in front of me blurred to an empty screen, the woman flashing out of existence. Blinking rapidly, her words were still trailing in my mind, half-finished and foggy. I almost opened my mouth to ask what my order was before a figure loomed over me. Human, and with a shadow, it was not a ʍopɐɥs. It did not need to be deleted. Still, though, my body stiffened up, a new feeling blossoming inside my mind. I reached for a weapon I didn’t have—only to realize my hands were tied down. That didn’t stop me from twisting my head, my gaze searching for one. The silhouette stared down at me, a silhouette without a face, drowning in the surgical light still blinding me. Before it came to fruition. 

Spencer. I felt his rough hands grasping at my restraints and pulling my wrists free.  The Delaney boy was speaking, though I couldn’t make sense of his words –no, they were numbers--  as he dragged me to a sitting position, taking slow gulps of air through every digit. “Three point one, four, five, nine…” 

He helped me off of the table, and the second my bare feet touched the ground, my body seemed to have a mind of its own, swinging a punch at his face, only for him to duck and grasp hold of my fist, shoving me back. I noticed he was sweating, and not just that. Spencer’s nose was bleeding, thick rivulets of red staining his chin. His breath was thin and shuddery as he exhaled out a hiss. 

He wasn’t a threat. I don’t think he was Zach Valdez, I figured that boy was gone. However, he wasn’t Spencer Delaney, either.  “Out.” Was all he managed to say, grabbing my shoulder, and dragging me towards a door. 

His steps were shaky, shuddery. 

“I don’t know where the others are and we don’t have time to get it out." he gritted out, his voice a whine I didn’t recognize. I watched him flit through metal instruments, trembling fingers scraping across scalpels. “There is something in our heads that we need to get out,” he surprised me with a harsh laugh. “Your head, I mean. I’ve been subjugated for too long. They will notice I’m awake and will put me on standby, which means all of us. So, we need to be quick. He dragged me up a wooden staircase, throwing us against the wall, playing cloak-and-dagger with the Delaney parents clanging around in the kitchen.  Spencer counted to three in short gasps of breath, dragging us behind the couch, and then against the door with a light thud. “Three point four, one, five, nine, two, six—” Spencer dragged me through the front door into the night, into pitch dark I had not been expecting. 

Still muttering strings of numbers to himself, he pulled me down the stairs, the two of us stumbling toward the gate.

Spencer’s eyes narrowed, his gaze glued to something I couldn’t see. “Are you squeamish?”

“What?”

“Get me something sharp,” He said, “Preferably one of my father’s drills.” He nodded to the garage, his hands flexing by his sides. “There should be one in there.” The boy groaned, his hands going to his temples. “Three point four, one, five…nine, two…”

“For what?!” I hissed out.

Spencer didn’t reply, only hissing out in pain, numbers came out in hysterical sobs this time, and I found myself tightening my grip on his hand. “Three point four, one, five, nine, two, six, five, three, five, nine.” He exhaled out, “Three point four, one, five, nine, two, six, five, three, five, nine.” Another breath. “Three point four, one, five, nine, two, six, five, three, five, nine,” he squeezed my hand. “When I say run, I want… you to… fucking run….three point four, one, five, nine, two, six,” His fingers were growing hot and clammy, and I did as I was told, mentally mapping my way to the garage. 

I started forward in a sprint before something slammed down on my head, and I hit wet grass, all of the breath being violently dragged from my throat.

“Orders were to leave the subject downstairs."

Jasper, standing with his arms folded. He didn’t waste time, throwing a punch that Spencer managed to dodge, only just managing to stumble back. I watched him drop to his knees at the mercy of a triple flip followed by a punch,  before diving to his feet and wrapping his hands around his elder brother’s throat. “Three point four, one, five, nine, two, six, five, three, five, nine—” The elder sibling had the upper hand, however, against the strength he lacked, due to having at least some consciousness. Jasper easily managed a punch in the gut, and then a roundhouse kick to the face, sending him sprawling. When I tried to get up, the curve of a sneaker stamped down on my throat, and I choked for breath, spots blossoming in my eyes. 

Luna Delaney stood over me, her vacant eyes penetrating me. “Under protocol 5M7_9, you were ordered to remain downstairs,” she said, pressing the toe of her heel into the curve of my throat. “Father will not be satisfied with our performance.” The girl cocked her head, her lips curving into the start of what I thought would be the last words I would ever hear. Before she slammed her hands over her ears and screamed a deep, guttural cry that rang in my skull. The other siblings joined, Spencer, lying on his back, his body jolting like it had been shocked, and Jasper, dropping onto his knees, his scrunched fingers clawing at his ears. 

Like a frequency that I couldn’t hear, a sound only boiling in their brains, the three of them stopped moving completely, their expressions going slack, arms falling to their sides. I used that time to force myself to my shaky feet.

“I am disappointed in you, Delaney family,” the woman’s voice was in my head, faded, a low murmur temporarily stiffening my limbs.

In their heads, however, it must have a deafening, screeching cry. The three of them cried out in sync, three mouths shaping into an agonizing O. Which was some kind of emotion, or at least a semblance of it, that I had never seen before. It wasn’t the fake façade they had put on when first meeting me, it was something else, a slight wrinkle of humanity clenched in bared lips and eyes squeezed shut. “I am afraid I will be putting you on pause until further notice,” the woman sighed. “Stand by for further instructions.” I watched them, transfixed by their synchronized movements like they were telepathically connected

“What's going on?"

The quivery voice dragged my attention to the oldest Delaney sibling, who was stock still, blinking rapidly, a slow stream of scarlet running from his nose. He looked confused for a moment, staring down at himself and his trembling hands slick red.

“Fuck!”

He swiped at his face with the knuckles of his fist and squeezed his eyes shut. “Three point four, one, five, nine,” He strode over to Spencer, wrapped his hands around the boy’s arm, and shoved the motionless sibling towards me. “Get him out of here.” I grasped hold of the guy, wrapping my arms around his limp form, his head hanging. When I didn’t, or rather couldn’t move, confused about who exactly I was talking to, Jasper turned to me with enough lingering humanity in his eyes for me to understand him. 

“Did you not hear me?” He hissed out, “Three point four, one, five, nine…” he swiped at his nose, and I could have sworn his eyes were seeing something else entirely, his fists coming out to slam against invisible bars. “Get him away from here!” He pointed toward the gate. “There are agents lining the road, but…” His face twisted, stumbling over the numbers. “Three p-point four, one, five, nine…” he took a deep breath. “Take a left when you get to the end of the road, and you should be able to avoid them.” Jasper groaned, bending over and burying his head in his lap. “Go.” He gritted out. 

“Now!”

I did.

Jasper was still screaming those same numbers when his mother calmly walked into the front yard, grabbed hold of his hand, and dragged him back into the house. It was two days later when I realized escaping town would be a problem. I could see things that didn’t use to be there; crowds of people had become faceless shadows drifting in and out of my vision, speckled eyes attached to every corner of my eye. They were everywhere. 

A whole town full of them, hiding under men and women, and children. Spencer Delaney was a ticking time bomb, on standby, a puppet cut from his strings. I kept us hidden for two days, seeking refuge under an abandoned tunnel. I tried three times to do exactly what Spencer had told me—to drill a hole inside my head—but each time, my fingers were no longer mine, the tool slipping from my grasp. She was still there in my head. 

And she was waiting for me. 

I realized that when I hit a blockade when attempting to escape the town I called home.

Four family members stood in front of me, with their fifth next to me in the passenger seat.

I waited for Spencer to move, to lunge forward and attack me—but he didn’t, his body limp against the window, eyes open, and yet no life inside.

The Delaney siblings were back to their usual selves. Luna stood with her arms folded, while Jasper’s fingers were expertly wound around the butt of a gun.

When alarms started going off, I realized they weren’t just blocking us from getting out, they were trapping the whole town. “Neutralization of every ʍopɐɥs begins now,” the woman’s voice seeped right into my skull, as well as the car radio. “Delaney family, are you listening?”

Throwing the car backward, my phone rang, and I answered it. "Mom?!" 

"Freida, please come home." 

Mom's voice didn't sound like my mother, a static screech in my ears, just as Luna Delaney dived onto the trunk of a car. I thought she was going to shoot me, but her attention went to my tires, blowing them out one by one. 

With both hands over my ears to escape the signal, I crawled out of the car, abandoning saving my own mind, to drag Spencer with me. To my confusion, the Delaney family did not follow me. Instead, they started forwards, doing exactly what they were told to do, eliminating the threat. They were not the only ones. I heard gunshots over the blockage of cars, glimpsing young people jumping from their cars, and attacking town residents. While the red room existed to hide from us, another video, brutal and unforgiving, existed to create hunters.

I could see them, upside-down figures hiding under human faces. 

I threw myself into a crowd of retreating shadows without faces, dragging my fake boyfriend with me, trying to ignore Jasper Delaney slicing a little girl's head off, leaping onto the top of a car, and taking out five citizens with one single shot. Blood spattered, a blackish goo stained red. I kept running, forcing my legs to go faster. 

I caught the elder Delaney sibling's gaze when I risked a look back, the hardness of his eyes settling on me. 

He was waiting for something. I discovered what it was  when my mom opened the door-- my sweet mom, with upside-down eyes, and no mouth, and yet I could see her terror. I let Spencer drop off of my shoulders and reached into the hilt under my skirt where a gun had been strapped there. The weapon felt so right in my hand, melded to my skin, my finger on the trigger, as I followed my dormant order. 

Blowing my mother's head off.
