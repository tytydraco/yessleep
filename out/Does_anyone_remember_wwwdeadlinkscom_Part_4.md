[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kcega7/does_anyone_remember_wwwdeadlinkscom_part_3/)

We broke. 

Derek slipped out to find the monster, to bait it back. Ryan and I dragged the heavy desk into position, tipping it on its side and propping it against the wall near the door. We waited. We sat, jittery, watching the door like it might breathe. Ryan tried to lighten the mood with some dumb inside joke from way back—and we laughed. Not because it was funny. Because it felt good. Almost normal. It was the last bit of calm before the storm.

I opened my mouth to ask him something—Did anything weird happen to you after DeadLinks?—but the words never made it out.

The sound of frantic footsteps in the distance caused me to shoot up to my feet and rush to the doorway. I peered out, eyes darting up and down the hallway—I saw him. Derek, full sprint, rounding the corner.

And the antlered beast was right behind him.

“Derek!” I shouted, waving him in. He ran harder, his face pale and twisted in terror. “Come on, come on, come on—” I whispered. He was almost here. Just a few more steps—

I reached out—but it was already too late.

The creature grabbed Derek by the leg and yanked him backwards. With just one effortless swing he became a blur.

*BANG*

The sound of a horrific wet explosion sent chills throughout my whole being. It wasn’t just an impact. It was everything breaking at once. The wet, sickening crunch of flesh and bone folding in on itself. 

Derek had become a fresh coat of paint on the wall.

I slumped to the floor. My stomach twisted violently. My eyes darted, frantically searching for him—there had to be something left—

The only piece of him still whole was his left leg, that the monster was playing with like some kind of sick joke. Only a single piece of Derek, when just seconds ago, he had been right in front of me. 

Alive. 

I couldn’t move. My body refused to function. My brain kept rejecting what my eyes were seeing, refusing to believe it. This wasn’t real. This couldn’t be real. Tears streamed down my face. My chest convulsed, sucking in jagged, useless breaths. My vision blurred—I was frozen. 

Suddenly, I was pulled backwards. 

The antlered beast flew past me. Ryan had grabbed me and pulled into the room just before I was about to be hit. He crouched down beside me, clamping a reassuring hand on my shoulder. His own face was streaked with tears, but his eyes were unwavering. Full of pain, but full of purpose. His voice came out rough, barely above a whisper. “I understand how you feel. But don’t throw your life away after Derek just used his to save ours.”

“You’re right,” I whispered back, my voice hollow.

We didn’t even have time to register what happened to Derek. The moment we stood up, Ryan was pulled backwards as one of the cloaked creatures grabbed his leash and started dragging him toward the door. “Ryan!” I shouted. He tossed the tranq dart to me just before disappearing into the hallway. I lunged to chase after him—

But I was stopped when I heard a sharp exhale.

The antlered creature stood in the doorway. For a split second, I thought—maybe I can trap it under the desk we’d propped up earlier—

The desk came flying at me like it had been fired from a cannon. I dove aside just in time, the heavy table crashing into the cabinets behind me with a deafening explosion of splinters and metal. “How the hell did we ever think we could beat this thing?!”

I had to get out—now.

The creature advanced, slow but deliberate, each step heavy. I clenched the tranq dart in my fist and made a break for it, heart pounding, trying to slip past the towering figure and out the door before it could stop me.

I was too slow.

The creature saw right through me. Its massive clawed hand snatched my arm, gripping with such force that I felt my bone fracture. Agonizing pain ripped through me as my fingers spasmed, and the dart slipped from my grasp. I barely had time to register its loss before the horrifying creature yanked me up, my legs dangling uselessly in the air.

I was face-to-face with it now.

Its hollow, gaping eye sockets ignited with a blinding green glow. Strings of thick, glistening saliva stretched between its jagged teeth as its jaw began to unhinge—wider, and wider. The sickening crunch of snapping bones filled the air as it forced its maw past its natural limit. The gaping abyss of its throat loomed before me, and I could feel its scorching breath on my skin. The stench that drifted from its mouth was sickening—a sweetness warped by decay, both inviting and revolting all at once.

Memories started flooding my mind, each one flying by like pages in a flip book. 

The moment its teeth began to descend, I was knocked from its grip. I hit the ground hard, pain jolting through my body. Dazed, I looked up to see a ghoulish figure—skin stretched tight over its bones, sunken black eyes gleaming—sink its teeth into the beast’s side, tearing away a hunk of flesh.

The thing shrieked.

They collapsed into a writhing mass of claws and limbs, their monstrous forms tangled in a feral struggle. Dismembered arms slapped against the wall, twitching like they were still searching for something to grab, while new ones sprouted in their place. The antlered beast’s wounds sealed almost instantly, but the smaller creature relentlessly bit and clawed, keeping it distracted.

"This will probably be my best chance." I thought.

I scrambled across the floor, my hands desperately searching in the darkness. My breath came in ragged, panicked gasps. Come on, come on… My fingers brushed against something cold and metallic.

I seized the dart.

Slowly, carefully, I stood, my eyes never leaving the two monsters as they savagely ripped into one another. I crept forward, stopping just a few feet from them, searching for an opening. 

None. 

I needed a better distraction. As my mind raced for a solution, I absently reached for my neck—I felt my eyes widen.

The collar.

I pressed my fingers against the jagged metal edge. The needles drove into my flesh instantly, sharp agony searing through my fingertips. My vision blurred with pain, but I didn’t move. I need blood. Forcing myself to endure the agony, I held my fingers there, counting the seconds in my head. With a sharp inhale, I yanked my hand away, gathering as much blood as I could under my thumb.

I flicked it.

Two crimson droplets arced through the air and landed with a soft plop. Both creatures stopped. Their heads snapped toward the sound, their bodies tensing. I shoved my bleeding fingers into my mouth, stifling the scent. The moment they turned away, I moved.

In one swift motion, I drove the dart deep into the still healing chunk on the creature’s side.

It screamed.

Its body convulsed violently, thrashing with such force that both the ghoul and I were flung across the room. I crashed to the floor, pain exploding through my ribs—I felt something break. My vision blurred, my ears ringing. Through my haze of agony, for a split second, it looked small. A lost, broken thing, throwing a tantrum in a world it didn’t understand.

Its glowing eyes flickered. Its frantic, spasming movements slowed and dulled, then—

It stopped.

As the paralysis took hold, a deep, rasp came from within the monstrous form.

Silence.

My body slumped against the wall.  I let out a breath, heavy, exhausted. "I actually did it."

A sudden skittering noise caught my attention. My head snapped up. The ghoul—the one that had saved me—was scrambling away, its awkward, too-thin limbs propelling it toward the exit. On its foot—was Derek’s shoe.

Its foot had burst through the front, forcing it to run awkwardly on all fours.

Tears welled up in my eyes. A broken, disbelieving laugh escaped me. Getting up, I wiped my tears away, though they kept coming. 

My chest ached, and my legs felt unsteady as I stumbled out of the room, desperate to find Ryan. I found him standing over the motionless form of the cloaked figure. Its head—what was left of it—was a pulped mess, smashed beyond recognition. Blood pooled around it, thick and dark, seeping into the cracks of the floor. 

The sight made my stomach churn, but what truly scared me was Ryan himself. He was hunched over, his entire body trembling with each ragged, uneven breath. His hands were curled into shaking fists at his sides, coated in red. 

His shoulders rose and fell in frantic bursts, as if he was still lost in whatever madness had taken hold of him. I barely recognized him. His face was twisted—jaw tight, nostrils flared, sweat and blood streaked across his skin. 

He looked feral. 

Like an animal backed into a corner, running on nothing but pure instinct. "Ryan…" I whispered, my voice barely escaping my throat. He turned toward me slowly, his movements unnatural, almost puppet-like. When our eyes met, a chill raced through me. His irises were gone—just milky, glazed-over white staring back at me. 

My heart pounded. 

That wasn’t Ryan. That wasn’t him anymore. I stepped back, every part of me screaming to run—

“Damon?” His voice was small. Fragile. Confused.

His eyes cleared. The white faded back into a warm, familiar brown. He blinked as if waking up from a dream. He looked down at his hands, at the blood dripping from his fingers, then at the corpse at his feet. He gasped. Both hands clapped over his mouth, smearing red across his skin. His knees buckled, and he crumpled to the floor, a sob ripping through him.

“Ryan…?” I reached for him, but his body shook violently.

His voice came out broken, barely above a whisper. "What have I done?" Over and over again. I knelt beside him, hesitating before placing a hand on his shoulder. He flinched at my touch, his whole body recoiling like he didn’t deserve to be comforted. But I didn’t pull away. I helped him up to his feet. 

“Ryan, we gotta get out of here before the tranquilizer wears off.”
