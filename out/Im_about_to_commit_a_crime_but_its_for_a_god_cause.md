I've been having dreams for the past couple months.  Grime, rust, and crimson surround me as the nightmare slowly turns into a prophetic call to action.  Peace washes over me as I observe the bloody weapon held loosely in my hand as I stand over a fresh corpse.

Every night I watch my dream self in the third person as she takes in the act she had just committed, lips in a straight line, eyes at half-mast, frame slouched and loose she could be pushed over from a gust of wind.  I try and speak but she disintegrates leaving me in the silence of an empty apartment with a strange gangly figure and I would wake up in the musty bed in the corner at the dank squat feeling that bliss slowly disappear.

I stood in front of this dingey apartment building trying to sus out a back entrance, cracked window I could kick through, or an easy fire-escape.  I wanted to wait for someone to leave so I could walk in, but I had been especially grungy these last few months and was pretty sure residents would feel weird with a dirty street urchin running into their building with blade and a pensive face.

On the side of the building near the garbage cans, I managed to find a window I could bust through. After seeing the inside of the building, I figured the tenants were used to the sound of broken glass; the complex had a certain bombed-out factory feel.  Rust upon rust upon rust, angst within walls within walls within walls.  Perfect containment for the dysfunction no one wants to see outside of a good movie.  The crusted paint hung down like begonia blossoms, the creaking of industrial flooring emanated like a chorus revealing my divine task.

I stumble upon the familiar crimson light descending the middle hallway stairs and began to climb.  Step by step the weight of my task grew on my shoulders as I ascended basking in the warm red glow feeling a mix of determination and regret for the crime I was about commit on an innocent.  Not a crime, a sin.  I'm not just breaking a law but also leaving behind a stain.  Although that stain will be used nobly, I doubt he will forgive such an act.

The light, now so thick I could barely see in front of me, melded with a miasma that projected from the units and surrounding the halls.  I turned right but stopped as if running into an imaginary wall and turned towards the east side of the building to see a door that stood out from the gold spilling from the bottom that clearly wasn't from a lamp.  My hand landed on the green rusted doorknob and turned like I was opening up a stale jar.  The rust chipped off as if opening a mechanical mausoleum that hadn't moved in decades.

The red became less dense once inside, revealing a regular apartment.  Left over takeout, blankets left off the couch, plain-white floor, some beer and diet sodas left in the recycling.  I noticed how the blinding white paint had caked in certain spots leaving the walls appearing blotchy rippled.  I'd never noticed the technicalities of a dude's wall before this moment.  Normally I’d be judging a dude’s taste in movies or certain nick-knacks, but he didn't have enough items to show signs of a personality other than diet coke, old pizza, and half eaten rotisserie chicken.

My friends found me to be a stain on their lives and slowly cut me out which made me realize how little I cared about losing people who've been in my life for so long.  Years went by and that incongruency with my surroundings got to the point I wasn't recognizing my childhood room; I woke up many mornings thinking someone dragged me to a random B&B with creepy staff.

Once I became a teen the thought of my parents erupted a feeling of rage which turned to ambivalence and led me to forget their faces when I wasn't around them.  I never told them this; I didn't want a therapist giving me a diagnosis.  I enjoyed my ambiguous identity.

This derelict shanty tower filled with junkies and psychos was the closest place I found to a home.  A place filled a bunch of "half breeds"; half human half something else.

I spent most days just studying the graffiti that decorated the walls of this derelict factory like a mantra of delinquency.  There were symbols to decode, and enough dead cats sprayed on the walls to keep me entertained for years.  There were many an insignia that connected people to certain groups.  They'd call themselves gangsters, but I'd disagree with that assessment.  These groups got together out of a shared desire to project their confusion so as to make the world look like the inside of their heads; the biproduct of being in a shared living situation without an ounce of consistency be that in location or values.  No one in this building, especially the "gangsters", had the ability to be on the same page, let alone have a common enemy.  Not even the most charming of charlatans could whip these guys into a mob as he'd probably be eaten during the middle of his speech.  The only thing on this earth they shared was a location filled with people who facilitated more disarray.  That's why I liked this place.

I got along with most but found the junkies to be a bunch of cowards who were in less control of their lives than an infant wearing a weighted vest.  They stole, beat, and killed, but convinced themselves it wasn't them; it was the substances that turned them into demons.  I never disagreed with that assessment; they were coerced into this lifestyle by a chemical reaction they didn't expect to take place.  No one takes a pill thinking they will rob old ladies. They weren't interesting like the psychos, just sad people who got scammed into hell.

Most of the depraved came to this place stone cold sober with a common goal none of them cared if they shared.  Some came and hid here out of necessity, some had intense blood lust and wanted to push their limits, others were curious and wanted to act out a fantasy, and many had lives on the outside and came to scratch an itch and couldn't afford to have it seen by their community.  they weren't coerced by a mistake they'd made while in college or high school; they embraced this lifestyle.

I pushed the dude's bedroom door not caring how silent it was compared to how cruddy everything else looked and saw my victim; chosen by fate.  An innocent man waiting for the divine instrument to jump start the new world using him as the first domino.  The crimson light shining through the window gave me an oceanic feeling that slowly put into perspective the long historical thread that began with the "original one" and led to this moment.

I wanted to do the deed quick and painless but knew he had to be awake to create the emotional energy that could support my tulpa's existence.  I threw a soda can at his face.

"Yo!!  Get up!!"  He moved immediately as if expecting some sort of conflict.  "Wakey wakey!!"

His body remained still while his eyes opened as if operated by a machine.  He took a few seconds to get a grounding of the fact that a woman had entered his home, she had a knife, and this wasn't a dream.  He let out a guttural 'gak' trying ask what was happening, but I interrupted.

"You knew this was coming."  The words slid out deceptively velvety with a grin that could fool a poker player.  The man shook chaotically but stopped to glare at me.

"You don't have to do this!"  He spoke sharply.

"I know I do."  I said with more confidence.  "Your sacrifice won't be in vain."

"You have no idea what you're doing!!"  He was afraid but not surprised.  Like this fear was something he was used to.  "This doesn't have to happen!  You can stop this!  Break the cycle!"

I laughed.  I felt a twinge of comical curiosity.  "Why would I want to stop the coming of the new world?  Don't you see this is bigger than you and I?  You should be honored,"

I didn't feel enough adrenaline to stop myself from falling to the floor after a right cross to my cheek.  I looked up at this scared man and smiled.  He had no idea how lucky he was sharing this destiny of emotional unity.  He just needed a push.

The crimson glow became thicker until it covered my whole vision.  A whistle whirring than only red.

I woke up on Saturday which turned out to be Thursday that felt like Monday not knowing if it were noon or 3 PM and drank some whiskey only to realize I could barely get a buzz after three pints.  My space had no windows and without access to the sun, you spend your life in temporal ignorance, where you could make believe it was always midnight on Saturday.  

I threw my ceramic mug and noticed one of the psychos from upstairs giving me the same look a large man would give a piece of meat.  I was never sure of the motivation behind these guys, and the ambiguity might have been the reason I found them so interesting.  There didn't seem to be animosity as we watched each other the same way scientist would watch a subject.  I wasn't an idiot; I knew my time would come eventually if I stayed here long enough.  I enjoyed these men, but I also knew what they were; a fact I found more intriguing than scary.

I decided to get this over with.  "Hey!  If you're going to do something to me, make it interesting."

He smiled at me like we were both in on something and just as quickly, his smile disappeared.

"I'm not going to hurt you.  You're not the one."  I heard the freak walk all the way out of the front entrance, leaving me with a pit in my stomach that made me cry for the first time in over a decade,

\*\*\*\*\*

The red that covered my vision begun incrementally fade revealing the stale room I was in just a few moments ago.  One dead and another standing on the other side of the room revealing the scene from my nightly premonitions.  My tulpa stood faceless and pale with a sickly frame.  He wasn't finished being made.

My tulpa just pointed out the window lighting my path to our next location.

I sprinted down the city street feeling transcended as the rusty wind blow through my skin as I darted towards my goal..
