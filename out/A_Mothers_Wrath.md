I never thought it would come to this. I never thought she'd come back.

My mother wasn’t a perfect woman. Far from it. But no one deserves what we did to her. My father, my brothers, my sisters... and me. We let it happen. We *made* it happen.

It was three years ago. She was... a burden, we said. Too much to handle. Always complaining, always weak. My father decided she wasn’t fit to live any longer. He didn’t want her to drain us. And we all went along with it. I don’t know what was worse—the plan or the fact that none of us stopped it.

We did it late one night, after a family dinner. Everyone had their role. My brothers held her down, my father smothered her with a pillow. My sisters helped cover it up, and I... I just stood there. Watched. Silent. We buried her in the woods behind our house. We told everyone she had just disappeared one day. No one ever questioned us.

But she didn’t disappear. Not really.

At first, it was small things. Her favorite chair would rock back and forth in the living room. I heard the creaking every night, even when no one was in the room. Then the whispers started. Quiet at first, just my name in the dead of night. "Claire..." She was calling me, I was sure of it.

Then, two months ago, my father died. It was sudden, and no one questioned it. Heart attack, they said. But I knew better. I had seen the terror in his eyes the night before. He had started talking to her, or at least... he thought he was. He said she was coming for us. We thought he was going mad. I didn’t believe him.

Not until my brother was next. He fell from the attic while trying to get something down for the winter. Snapped his neck. And I swear, just before he fell, I heard the sound of her voice calling from up there, laughing.

We’re being hunted by her. By my *mother.* It’s like she’s picking us off one by one. Last week, it was my sister. She drowned in the bath. But the tub wasn’t even full.

Now it’s just me and my youngest brother left. I haven’t slept in days. Every time I close my eyes, I see her face. Pale, cold... the same face I watched die. Her eyes, wide open, staring at me with that look. That same look from the night we killed her. The look that told me she knew what we did, that she would *never* forgive us.

I hear her now. It’s always the same... the creaking of the chair, the whispers growing louder. "Claire..." She's calling me again. I know it won’t be long before she comes for me.

I’m writing this down because I don’t think I’ll survive tonight. If you find this, you’ll know. You’ll understand.

She’s here.

I can feel her cold breath on my neck.

She’s—"
