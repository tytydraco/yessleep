Part I: When the Smoke Turns Black

The village of Naporia clung to the edge of the Beartooth Mountains like moss on bone. Wooden homes, their roofs blanketed in pine needles and rot, stood in silence among the dark trees. Smoke rarely rose from chimneys now. The wind whispered too often through empty homes.

Last year, Naporia counted 127 souls. Now, only 52 remained.

It began in winter. Toma, the herder’s boy, vanished while gathering kindling. Then Sister Melwen, the priestess, who’d gone out at dusk to bless the woods and never came back. Then the Jarl’s eldest son, found split open in the well.

Each time, the same was found — or not found. Blood, yes. Bones, sometimes. But never the whole body. Never tracks. Only pine needles strewn in odd, circular patterns, and sometimes… gouges in the bark, long and deep as spears.

Some whispered it was the mountain itself. Others said a forest god had been angered. The older folk simply said, “Something old’s awoken. The land’s remembering again.”

Whatever it was, it was killing them.

And so, they did what no one wanted to do — they pooled what little silver they had. Coins, old trinkets, a pair of wedding bands. Even the Jarl gave his ceremonial brooch, forged from a knight’s sword and kept in his family for three generations.

The trader who agreed to carry the message never returned.

But the Hunter came.

He arrived on the 7th night of Fogfall.

A long coat wrapped him like a shadow, crusted with dried blood at the hems. His face was gaunt, marked with pale scars and tired eyes. Strapped to his back was a notched longsword, its handle wrapped in black leather. At his hip hung a satchel filled with bottles, bones, and powdered stones. The other villagers stood silent as he passed, clearing the road without a word.

The only sound was the dogs — growling low from under porches and chicken coops.

He came to the center of the village and raised his voice.

“Who speaks for Naporia?”

The Jarl stepped forward, his once-proud form diminished by sleepless months.

“I am Jarl Wern, son of Balric. Welcome, stranger.”

“I’m not here to be welcomed,” the Hunter said, voice hoarse. “I’m here to end a horror.”

“We’re told… that’s what your kind does.”

The Hunter said nothing. He turned to the gathered crowd.

“Fifty-two of you remain. That is the count?”

There were nods. A few mumbled in affirmation.

“Then stay inside tonight. Bolt your doors. Leave no candles burning past midnight. Do not call out to anything, even if it mimics your voice.”

A murmur rippled through them.

“You’ve seen it?” asked Elna, the widow who’d lost two sons.

The Hunter met her gaze. “No. But I’ve smelled its work.”

The inn was nearly empty now. Its owner, Torrin, offered the Hunter the attic room.

“You’ll find it quiet,” Torrin said, nervous hands wiping the same mug for the third time. “No one's stayed up there since the priestess vanished.”

“Good,” the Hunter muttered. “Ghosts make less noise than villagers.”

He dropped a silver vial on the bar. “Boil this in water. Pour it in the hearth before sundown. It will smoke black.”

Torrin blinked. “That’s—why?”

“If the smoke changes color, don’t enter the inn.”

“…What color?”

“You’ll know.”

That afternoon, the Hunter walked alone to the forest’s edge.

He muttered to himself in a tongue no longer spoken by men, dipped a pine branch into a goat’s blood pouch, and began marking trees in tight spirals. He scattered ash and powdered bone, drew symbols along the ground, and poured salt in lines that glowed faintly under the twilight.

He muttered:

“Old flesh… old hunger… old name…
If bound you are, I call you forgotten.
If free you are, I call you found.”

He returned to the village at dusk.

The hearth smoked black, as ordered. The people watched him from behind curtains and shutters.

That night, he sat by the inn’s fire, flipping through a codex bound in rough, yellowed leather. The symbols on the cover were burned in, not inked. He flipped through entries:

Haunters – avoid eye contact. Weak to grave-ash. Do not follow if it flees.

Ghost Brides – summon via mirror. Burn at dusk, not dawn.

Hollow Men – not men. Never were. Never let them near children.

He paused on a sketch. Tall, eyeless things, with skin like dry moss and mouths that split up to the ears.

Beneath the drawing, in faded ink:

The Nameless Mist - “They do not eat to live. They live to eat.”
Weakness: unknown.
Origin: bound to fog. Freed by breath.
Avoid: Beartooth range.

His eyes narrowed. “Damn it.”

Before dawn, Erlin the Miller vanished.

His door was not broken — it was peeled, as if by claws too long and deliberate. Blood stained the steps in wide crescents. Drag marks stopped five feet out, where the earth was churned and needles circled the soil.

The mill still turned, slowly, though the wind had not stirred all night.

The villagers gathered, white-faced and tight-lipped.

“He slept on the floor,” murmured his wife. “Right there… near the fire. Said he heard something outside… a whisper. Like me, he said. But I was asleep.”

“Did he open the door?” someone asked.

She nodded once, and began to sob.

The Hunter knelt near the threshold, dipping his fingers into the blood. He sniffed. Tasted. His eyes twitched, barely.

“Still warm.”

He rose. “It was here. Less than an hour ago.”

He turned to the crowd. “It’s testing us. Me.”

Jarl Wern frowned. “What does it want?”

The Hunter looked toward the forest — where the mist never lifted.

“It’s not about wanting.”

He drew a rune on his arm in ash and spit.

“It’s about remembering.”
