Haunted Haveli of Kota, Rajasthan,India
This story is about a haunted mansion in Kota city of Rajasthan.

This haveli was built during the time of Raja Maharaja. But for the last eighteen years no one has come to live in this haveli till date.

No one was able to live in this mansion even if they wanted to, because people said that this mansion is haunted.

When Ajit Singh came to know about this haveli, he decided that he would keep knowing this secret, why people are not able to live in this haveli.



He made complete preparations to live in the haveli with strong will power.

When he stepped forward to go inside the mansion, some unknown person stopped him at the door. And went closer and said, "Who are you, and where are you going?"

Instead of answering, Ajit Singh asked a question in front of him. "May I know, who are you?"

My name is Arjun Singh, and I live near here.

Ajit Singh said, “Oh well, I hear it is a haunted mansion. And no one can come here.

So I have decided to stay for a day in this haveli.

Arjun Singh said, "Yes... You heard right.

And you also don't go inside, if you agree with me then you also go back. There is great danger here.

Ajit Singh became happy after hearing this. As if they have won a lottery.



Seeing his happiness, Arjun said, "Why are you getting happy, you should be scared to hear the name of a ghost."

You might not know that I am quite interested in ghosts.

If there is a ghost in this mansion, I will definitely go inside and find out the truth.

Saying this, Ajit Singh went to that mansion.

Going inside, Ajit kept his bag on the side and started looking around the haveli. Checked all the rooms too.

Later came to the drawing room and sat on the sofa. He also drank two to four pegs of liquor while sitting there.

And suddenly a light bulb started flickering in that room. But Ajit didn't pay attention to that

After a while the second bulb started flickering, then all the lights in the mansion started flickering.

Seeing all this, Ajit stood at his place and became fully conscious.

Suddenly a small table in front of him started flying in the air. He went up in the air about 6 feet and started spinning in a circle.

And later Ajit's started coming faster.



Ajit immediately changed his place and went to the other side and that table fell down where Ajit was standing.

As soon as Ajit could understand something, the sofa sheet started coming towards him. He quickly stood up and jumped on the other side. Due to which the sofa hit the wall and Ajit was saved.
Suddenly everything fell silent.

Ajit looked around cautiously and said in a loud voice, "Whoever you are, come forward and talk."

There a big shadow appeared in front of him.

Ajit looked at the shadow and said, "Who are you? And why do you want to kill me?

shadow: because of your mistake

Ajit: My mistake? What mistake did I make?

Shadow: Mistake of coming to this mansion. I can't see anyone happy in this mansion.

Ajit: But why?

He replied with a shadow, eighteen years ago the owner of this mansion had killed me on this very spot. It was not even my fault.

Because of this reason, my soul keeps wandering in this mansion. I will not let anyone stay in this haveli because my blood happened in this haveli.

Whoever comes to live in this mansion will die.

Ajit said, “I want to see you in your true form.”

I will definitely fulfill this wish of yours before killing you.

And that question took a terrible intermediate form. His face was so terrifying that even Ajit was scared for a moment, but in a second he overcame himself.

Later he took out white powder from his pocket and threw it on the ghost.

As soon as the powder fell on the ghost, it started burning. A big flame started rising.

He started crying very loudly and later got completely burnt.

After that Ajit breathed peacefully and fell asleep there.



Arjun was shocked to see Ajit coming out of the haveli safe and sound the next morning.

Arjun asked Ajit, "How are you alive?" When Ajit told Arjun the incident that happened last night in a perfect way and said that now this mansion is not a haunted mansion.
