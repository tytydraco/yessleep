My name is Zoey Scottson, and I was a person who used to have a life worth living. I used to have a family and friends. I was content with the life I carved out for myself. Now, here I am, left with my own thoughts and regrets with not the chance of the inevitable sweet release of death; all I have is the tormenting connection to the outside world but no way of seeing it. 

I want to apologize in advance. I haven't written something like this in a long time. I tend to go on tangents, so please forgive me for that. I seem to not be able to keep a single train of thought for long nowadays. 

Before I ended up here, I was part of the touring crew of an off-boardway show. I will not mention the name of the play because I don't want anyone involved being asked questions. They have all been through enough about it already.

I was part of the lighting crew. It was my passion. Something so simple of lights can be so layered. The way lights make people feel when certain lights are on, the way they worked, the ins and outs, I loved it! It seems so silly to be so interested in something so mundane on the surface. 

While on the way to the next city on our tour list, we were told that the hotel we were going to be originally staying can't let all of us stay on the same floor because part of the floor we were on was closed due to reconstruction needed in mine and another member of the cast and crews room. Turns out some dumbass tried to make some explosive or something in their room, and it literally blow up in his face and the next room over. 

I would have just bunked up with some other person I was traveling with, but I've always had a weird thing about sleeping in the same room as someone. Some deep-rooted trauma stuff that I don't want to talk about and, in the nicest way possible, it's none of your business. 

So, I and the other two went to the front desk to talk to the staff there about finding another room. Which should have been the end of the story if it wasn't for one small detail. They could easily get a room for the other two members, but I had to go onto another floor entirely. The *17* th floor. Being on a floor alone was strangely unnerving to me. I had this gut instinct to fight the staff on putting me on the floor with my friends, but they told me that there was no vacancy left up there. Not only did we have a large team, but we are obviously not the only ones here. 

Sometimes, in a show, you just have to go along with it. If an actor screws up their lines, a stagehand brings a set piece out too soon, you miss your cue; you just have to go along with it. There's a lot of times where you end up in these sucky situations, and you just got to play with the cards you were delt. So I had to take a deep breath and throw in the towel and take the room. 

We thanked the front desk people, and as I waited for them to fetch me the key to the room, the person assisting us said to me 

"Hey, small side note, it's easy to get lost up there. If you get lost, finding your way out will take longer than you think. Trust me, it's an eternity up there."

I just raised my eyebrows and laughed a bit. He laughed back, and for the rest of that short period of time of me waiting, I joked how much he made it sound as if the floor was haunted. God, the irony. It's so stupid. It's so clich√©, and it irrates me to think back on it. He was giving me a warning but it sounded so much out of a horror movie that it sounded so fucking dumb that there was no way it was correct. 

I was not one to believe in the supernatural. I thought it was all fake. It's just something to satisfy the mind. Things happening that doesn't add up or something that seems unexplainable is not something your brain likes so it makes up fiction to explain it in the best way it can. That's how I thought back then. 

When I got to the *17* th floor, I immediately noticed the slight oddities of the place. Seemed like it wasn't as well kept as the floors I've been on so far. 

The buttons to call the elevator were dusty and the signs directing what sides the rooms were on seemed to be a bit rusty. Maybe the ghost stories of this floor made people not want to go to it. I think it was stupid that the cleaning crew can't take care of a floor just because of some cryptic message someone said. Something I hated the most was when someone is supposed to do a job and comes up with a dumb explanation for why they didn't do it. It was my biggest pet peeve. 

I sighed and followed the numbers to the room. My room was on the left wing. Room *17*68 The hallway itself gave if this strange energy. Now, I've been in MANY hotels before and walked through the hallways many times. I know how eerie they can feel. However, this time, red alarms were going off in my head to turn back. There's no shame to call someone to walk with me to my room. It's not the first time I've done so. 

I called up one of the actors whom I will be referring to as Marcus. I told him the situation, and he gladly accepted. He said he would be waiting at the elevator and told me to turn back in to meet him there. 

As I walked back down the hall, the sense of unease only increased as I recognized every room number was different. Instead of the room numbers counting down (like *17*57, *17*55, *17*56), it was counting up. I actually found my room not too long after.

I called up Marcus and let him know I found the room. I wonder what would have happened if I didn't. If I called him to try to find me. Maybe I wouldn't be alone right now. 

I spent most of the night in my room after that. We already went out to eat and stuff, and rehearsals weren't until the next morning. We were told to be up and down in the lobby by 9am. I liked waking up early because I tend to get easily sidetracked. I need extra time to get ready in the morning. I set my alarm for 6am and turned on the TV to see what was on. 

It wasn't even 5 minutes when I heard my alarm go off. I thought it was odd. I thought it was just I set it for PM instead of AM, but that was impossible because it was dark outside in the middle of June. The sun didn't usually go down until 8pm. Last I checked the time it was 10:32pm when I set the alarm.

I went into my settings to see if I was on the wrong timezone, but it was correct. I checked all the rest of the timezones, and they were all saying it was AM. 

I resorted to looking up the time on Google, and, sure enough, it was 6:16AM. I thought I was going crazy. Ain't no way it's been a full 7 hours since I set the alarm. It was not possible. I usually get tired around 11. I spent another 30 minutes trying to rationalize why the time was all messed up, but no answers came.

On top of that, I didn't feel tired. I didn't feel any of the usual things I did in the mornings. I didn't feel like I needed to encourage or tear myself out of bed to start the day. I didn't feel like a zombie in need of a coffee. I felt normal. I felt like how I usually do when it's around noon time. 

Whenever your brain fails to add up everything, you start grasping at straws to prove to itself that there is still some sanity left in you. It starts to rationalize and try to explain the unexplainable even though in the deep recesses of itself is the answer. I bring this up now to explain why I decided to get up and pretend like it was the morning time. 

I bring it up now to illustrate and to shut up that one person who's going to call this a work of fiction because that action is something seen out of something of similar to a movie or something. I wish this was. I wish this was all fake because then I would be happy and free from this nightmare 

When I realized I was trapped, that the hallways would never end, I panicked as most people would do. I ran down the halls, calling for help. I backtracked and screamed for someone. I banged on the floor with objects. I went into my room and started breaking the TV, flipping over nightstands, doing anything to get someone's attention.

But no one came. 

I practically kicked down doors, but no one answered.

I yelled and screamed and shouted until my vocal cords were so strained I thought they were severely damaged. But no one heard.

I did the one thing I could think of left and called someone. I called Marcus. He answered on the first ring.

"Zoey!" He chipped. "Oh god, where the hell are you?"

"I'm on the *17*th floor." I said with a mix of desperation and relief and hoarseness in my voice. "I need help."

"*17*th floor?" Marcus questioned. "What are you talking about?"

"The *17*th floor of the hotel." I shouted in panic.

"In the hotel you went missing at?"

"Yes!"

"There was no *17*th floor."

My heart suck in my chest. A burning sensation in my chest of rage and pure terror. It was impossible. It was unreasonable. It was absurd and ridiculous in every way. 

"What do you mean?!" I cried, sounding a little more mean than I intended. 

"Zoey. Just please, tell me where you are! I'll tell the police! They have to reopen the case."

"Reopen the case? What do you mean?" My voice dipped as all the hope in my soul left.

I dreaded what he had to say next, hoping he wouldn't confirm the worst thing imaginable. 

It was true. I was a missing person. Somewhere in the world is a wall with a poster that reads "Missing" with my name on it; my picture; my face; my birthday; my height; my weight; my age; the day I was last seen.

I had been missing for 8 months. I thought I couldn't scream anymore, but I managed to let out one gasping and loud screech and cried I hadn't experienced since my mother died. 

I thanked Marcus. I told him everything. He told me he'd help me. I could tell he was just as confused as I was, but he didn't want to push my already distressed state. According to my phone calendar, it has been 5 months since the call. 

It didn't take long for me to realize I still have a connection to the outside world. I thought it was a blessing. I thought it would be my salvation, but it turned out to be worse than the endless hallways and rooms and the maddening sound of my footsteps against the soft carpet tiles. 

I called my parents, my family, and friends. Everyone. I told them I'm okay. I talked to them for hours. I kept up with the news of my own dispearance. The people who love me looking for me, their pain and fears, all of them. They were all looking for me. I was so close yet so far. I could talk to them, but they couldn't see me. They couldn't interact with me. They couldn't embrace or touch or kiss or show me any physical comfort. 

After a while, their comforting words came one ear out of the other, and I was overwhelmed with the feeling of my will to live being crushed. I tried. I tried so many times, but I can't die. Whatever is holding me here, whatever fucked up game this is, it's not allowing me to escape even with death. Even if I could, would it be something my loved one would want for me. I never want to ask them. They already lost me physically, they can't know I want to make them lose me forever. No matter how tempting it is. No matter how much of an easy answer it was. 

I don't feel hunger or thirst. I don't get the luxury of feeling human and having basic human needs. The only need I have is to walk, to maybe find the exit. To ignore time. 

Whenever I get tired, The Floor taunts me once more by having the last room I stop in front of being that of my own. Room *17*68.

I decided to fully cut off the outside world, I can't bear it anymore. It is torturous to no end. I love my family, and I love my friends, but I can't listen to their stories anymore. I can't listen to the news anymore. I can't walk here alone knowing the world is spinning still. So, this is my last post. This is my final goodbye. 

To my family who might see this, I'm sorry. You loved me and never given up on me, and it breaks my heart. I can't do it to myself. That I can't give up on myself. That I can't love me like you do. That I can't be patient and hold out hope for myself.

To my friends, you have shown me support and love, and I consider you the best humanity has to offer. It's been a hell of a ride sharing what my life was with you.

And to Marcus, I'm sorry. There's a million things I want to say to you yet, not the words to say them. You were my brother. You had my back even when you had every right to leave me. Not just in here, but in my life. You listened to my rambles about lights, and you nodded respectfully even though you had no idea what the hell I was talking about half the time. 

Whatever is holding me here is cruel. This is hell. It wants me to feel hopeless and sad and alone. It wants me to feel tormented. This must be how it felt for the people in that Harlon Ellison short story. But the biggest difference is:

I have a mouth, I can scream, but no one will ever hear it.
