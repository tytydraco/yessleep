The morning sun casts a pale light over the scene as I pull up, the flashing red and blue lights of the squad cars casting an eerie glow over the small, idyllic village of Saranac Lake.

I’d spent the better part of my career as a detective for New York’s 5th Precinct, dealing with the grit and grime of the city. The days were long and nights were perilous, as I navigated through the underbelly of a city that never sleeps.

But despite everything - the danger, the sleepless nights, the encounters with the worst of humanity - I loved my job. There was something about the pursuit of justice, of bringing closure to those who had been wronged, that fueled me.

Then, one fateful evening, everything changed. My wife Julie was involved in a fatal accident, a hit-and-run that shook the very foundation of my world. I threw myself into finding her killer with a fervor that bordered on obsession, but the case remained cold. The perpetrator was never found, and the lack of closure gnawed at me with a relentless intensity.

The constant reminders of her absence, the echoes of her laughter in our now-empty apartment, the unresolved case file that sat on my desk - it all became too much.The emptiness cast a shadow over everything I knew and loved. I needed a change of scenery, a chance to breathe, to heal.

So, when a position for a senior investigator opened up in a quieter, more serene part of upstate New York, I jumped at it.

I thought I had left this life behind – the never-ending stream of difficult cases, one bleeding into the next. Yet here I am, on Christmas Eve, facing a grim reminder that no place is immune to crime.

I see the cozy lake house, nestled on the shores of Saranac Lake, standing isolated, cordoned off with police tape. The snow gently falls, adding a serene contrast to the chaotic scene before me.

What strikes me most, amidst the flurry of uniformed officers and patrol vehicles, is the distinct lack of Christmas decorations on the house. In a town where practically every building is adorned with festive lights and wreaths, this absence feels like a silent scream in the stillness of the winter morning.

I glance over at my partner, Olga, her expression grim yet determined. She may be a rookie, but she's got resolve in her steely blue eyes. Yet, I can't help but notice a slight quiver in her posture, a subtle hint of uncertainty, maybe even dread.

This is her first homicide case. I remember my first time. Nothing ever quite prepares you for  when the reality of death hits you.

"How are you holding up?" I ask, my voice low but steady.

"I'm fine," she replies quickly, a bit too quickly.

I can tell she's not fine. The tension in her shoulders, the way she avoids looking directly at the house, it all speaks volumes. I'm not the best at giving pep talks, always been more of a man of action than words, but I know she needs it.

"Listen, Volkova," I say, keeping my voice steady, "homicides are tough. But you've got good instincts, and you're here because you're capable. Stick to the facts, keep a level head, and we'll get through this, together."

She listens, her eyes fixed on the ground for a moment before meeting mine again.

She nods, a faint smile crossing her lips, a glimmer of appreciation in her eyes. "Thanks, Chen. I needed that," she says, her voice steadier. "I won't let you down."

We exit our unmarked cruiser, the crunch of snow under our boots breaking the stillness of the morning. Our breaths create small clouds of mist in the cold air as we approach the house. The scene is quiet, save for the muted conversations of the officers scattered around.

As we near the entrance, an officer, his face weathered and stern, steps forward. "You folks from the State Police?" he asks, eyeing us cautiously.

I reach into my coat, pulling out my badge. “Yes, I’m Detective Dominic Chen,” I introduce myself. “And this is my partner, Detective Olga Volkova.”

The officer gives a nod, a silent acknowledgement of our jurisdiction. "I'm Sergeant Timothy Reynolds," he says, gesturing towards the house. "Come on, I'll walk you through what we've got."

Reynolds leads us through the front door, its frame marked by the tell-tale signs of a forced entry.

Inside, the air is heavy, tinged with the metallic scent of blood. As we navigate through the narrow hallway, I notice how the home speaks of a life once lived in quiet simplicity. Old photographs line the walls, memories frozen in time.

Entering the living room, we’re greeted with a jarring sight. The furniture is upturned, indicating a struggle. Splatters of blood adorn the walls and floor, a gruesome tableau that tells a story of violence.

It's clear this wasn't a random act; the destruction is too personal, too targeted.

Reynolds's voice is somber as he fills us in. "The victims are Harold and Edith Collins,” he starts. "Both were in poor health. Mr. Collins had a stroke last year, and Mrs. Collins was battling breast cancer."

As he speaks, I glance around, realizing that their physical limitations must have prevented them from putting up the Christmas lights this year.

Then, something catches my eye – a small Christmas tree, tucked in the corner of the room, adorned with a few simple ornaments and a string of twinkling lights. It’s a silent witness to the horror that unfolded in this room. Beneath it, a scattering of wrapped presents lies untouched, their cheerful colors jarring against the dark backdrop of the crime scene.

"Who found them?" I ask, keeping my tone professional despite the emotional weight of the scene."It was their home nurse," Reynolds replies, leading us through the house towards the backyard. "She came by for her morning visit and found… this."

As Reynolds leads us into the backyard, the first thing that hits me is the breathtaking view. Saranac Lake, in all its glory, stretches out before us, a vast expanse of frozen tranquility. The surface of the water, partially covered with a thin layer of ice, reflects the pale morning light, creating a serene atmosphere that feels worlds away from the grim reality we are here to confront.

But this serenity is shattered by the sight that meets us a few feet away from the house. There, lying on the pristine snow, are the bodies of Harold and Edith.

It's a haunting image – they lie spread-eagled, their arms and legs extended as if they were mid-motion in creating snow angels.

I crouch down next to them, taking in the scene methodically, trying to piece together the final moments of the Collins.

It’s clear from the state of the bodies that they were attacked with brutal force. The wounds are deep and savage, indicative of an ax or hatchet. The cuts are irregular, haphazard – not the work of a skilled assailant, but rather someone frenzied, uncontrolled. They’re final moments were gruesomely violent.

The lack of blood around the bodies suggests they were placed there postmortem. It's a meticulous, deliberate act, someone wanting to send a message or perhaps fulfill some twisted fantasy.

I stand up and turn to Olga, who's been silently observing the scene. Her face is a mask of professionalism, but the slight furrowing of her brow tells me she's processing, trying to make sense of the senseless.

"No defensive wounds," she notes. "They probably didn't even see it coming."

I nod in agreement, my mind racing through the possibilities.

"Sergeant Reynolds," I call out, turning to our local counterpart who's been respectfully giving us space to examine the scene. "We'll need to canvas the area, talk to neighbors, anyone who might have seen or heard something. And we'll need the full list of people who had access to the Collins' home."

Reynolds nods, understanding the gravity of the situation. "We'll get right on it. I'll have my team start the neighborhood sweep."

We begin our initial assessment, methodically examining the area for any clues that might have been overlooked. The blanket of snow acts as both an ally and adversary in our investigation. It preserves some evidence while potentially burying others.

Olga and I split up, covering different sections of the backyard. The cold bites at our skin, but we're too focused to mind.

As I move further away from the grim tableau, something catches my eye – a set of snowmobile tracks leading away from the house. The tracks are distinct, cutting through the otherwise undisturbed snow. They start near the back of the house, veering off into the dense line of trees that mark the property's boundary.

Before I could examine them further, Olga's voice pierces the silent air, urgent yet controlled. "Dominic, over here!"

I quickly make my way towards her, noticing the pair of faint footprints she's found. They lead towards a small tool shed, partially hidden by a cluster of bare trees. The snow around the footprints is lightly dusted, suggesting they aren't recent, but they're the first solid lead we've had.

Olga and I exchange a glance, an unspoken agreement to proceed with utmost caution. We approach the shed, our sidearms drawn.

With my left hand, I gently push the door open while my right hand grips my Glock firmly, ready for any threat that might present itself. The door swings open, revealing the dim interior of the shed. We pause for a moment, allowing our eyes to adjust to the subdued light filtering through the dusty windows.

The shed is cluttered, filled with gardening tools, old paint cans, and various bits of hardware. But it's immediately clear that there's no one inside. The sense of relief is brief, however, as our attention is drawn to a conspicuous gap on the wall-mounted tool rack.

Amongst the neatly hung shovels, rakes, and other gardening implements, there's an empty space where a tool should be. It's outlined with a faint layer of dust, suggesting that whatever was there had been in place for a while before being recently removed.

Olga steps closer, her eyes narrowing as she examines the empty spot. "Looks like a missing ax," she observes, pointing to the shape of the outline. "Could be our murder weapon.”

"We need to get forensics in here," I say, holstering my sidearm.

We head back inside the house, our steps heavy with the weight of our findings. As Olga makes the call to bring in the forensics team, I take a moment to look around the living room once more.

My eyes are again drawn to the small Christmas tree in the corner of the room.

The twinkling lights cast a soft glow on the wrapped presents beneath it. Most of the gifts have tags indicating they're from friends and family – simple tokens of love and care. But one present, tucked away at the back, stands out. It's wrapped in plain red wrapping paper, the bow slightly askew, and the tag reads, "To Harold and Edith, From Santa Claus."

The oddity of the tag, especially considering the couple's age and the situation, piques my curiosity. With gloved hands, I pick up the gift, feeling its weight and size. It's not particularly heavy, but there's something about it that feels deliberate, intentional. The handwriting on the tag is neat, almost meticulous, which contrasts with the haphazard wrapping.

I carefully peel back the tape, mindful of not destroying any potential evidence. As the paper falls away, a small, plain box is revealed. I lift the lid and find inside a simple USB drive, no markings, no indications of its contents.

"Look at this," I say, holding up the USB drive.

Olga's eyes widen slightly. "That's... unusual. Could be anything on there. We need to get this to the tech team ASAP."

—

As the morning progresses, the quiet serenity of Saranac Lake is further disturbed by the arrival of the forensics and tech teams.

The tech team sets up a secure laptop in the dining room, away from the chaos of the ongoing investigation in the living room and outside.

Olga and I watch intently as one of the technicians inserts the drive into the laptop. The screen flickers to life, revealing a series of video files.

We gather around the laptop, the room silent except for the low hum of the machine. The technician clicks on the first file, and the sound of children singing Christmas carols fills the room. It's a jarring audio backdrop, given the grim scene just a few rooms away.

We listen as the carols play out, each video clip featuring a different group of children singing classic holiday songs. There's an eerie feeling to these seemingly innocent videos, a sense of foreboding that grows with each passing moment.

Then, as we reach a clip titled "Santa Claus is Coming to Town," something shifts. The familiar melody starts, but it's abruptly cut off. The screen goes dark for a moment, and when it comes back on, the scene has changed dramatically.

A figure appears, dressed in a Santa suit, but this is no jolly, red-cheeked St. Nick. The suit is tattered, the colors faded, and the Santa mask he wears is grotesque, with twisted features and empty, staring eyes. His voice, digitally distorted, sends a chill down my spine.

"Ho, ho, ho," he begins, his voice unnaturally deep and menacing. "Welcome to my special holiday performance."

“What the Hell?” Olga exclaims.

"The spirit of the season has been lost and forgotten," he sneers, his voice taking on a mocking tone.

"Harold and Edith, pillars of the community, where was their holiday cheer? Where were the lights, the songs, the joy?"

He paces back and forth in what looks like a dimly lit room, the camera struggling to keep him in focus. As he moves, he gestures wildly, as if performing for an unseen audience.

"They denied the essence of Christmas, the very heart of it. They needed to be reminded, to be taught a lesson," he continues, his words sending a shiver down my spine. The man's logic is twisted, his reasoning chillingly detached from any semblance of reality.

As he speaks, it becomes increasingly evident that this wasn't just a random act of violence, but a targeted attack driven by a deranged motive. The lack of decorations at the Collins' house, something initially seen as a minor detail, now appears to be the trigger for this horrific act.

"Those who forget the spirit of the holidays must pay the price," he rants. "I am the enforcer of cheer, the harbinger of yuletide justice."

The killer's proclamation grows more ominous as the video progresses. "Tonight," he declares, his voice laced with a twisted excitement, "I will wander the village. Those homes filled with the sound of Christmas music, with lights shining bright, will receive my blessings. Holiday tidings to celebrate the season's joy."

His demeanor shifts as he continues, "But for those who remain silent, who shun the spirit of Christmas... they will face my wrath. They will learn, as Harold and Edith did, the price of forgetting the true meaning of this time of year."

The video suddenly cuts to a scene of the Collins' house, filmed from a distance. It's clear he'd been watching them, planning his move. The video then abruptly ends, leaving us in stunned silence.

Olga is the first to break the silence. "This is sick... it's like he's living in his own twisted fantasy. He's delusional."

I stand there, my mind racing to process the chilling words and images we've just witnessed.

"We need to act fast," I say. "He's planning something tonight. This isn't just about the Collins anymore. It's about anyone in this village who doesn't meet his twisted standards of 'holiday cheer'."

I call Sergeant Reynolds over, quickly briefing him on the situation. "You need to mobilize the entire force," I stress. "Every available officer should be out on the streets, ensuring people's safety. We should also set up a hotline for any suspicious activities related to this case."

"We should warn the locals, advise them to either display some form of Christmas decoration or stay somewhere else for the night," Olga suggests.

The idea of causing a widespread panic on Christmas Eve is unsettling, but the safety of the community is paramount. I run my hand through my hair, feeling the weight of the decision.

"Let’s do that," I agree reluctantly, my voice firm despite the uncertainty churning inside me. "But let's keep it as calm as possible. We don't want to create hysteria."

—

As the day unfolds, we work against the clock, coordinating with the local police force under the mounting pressure. The village is a hive of activity, officers moving door-to-door, advising residents while trying to maintain a semblance of calm. The hotline is set up, and calls start coming in, but most are false alarms or well-meaning tips leading nowhere.

Back at the crime scene, forensics meticulously collects every piece of evidence. The snowmobile tracks outside lead to a dead end, vanishing into the dense forest surrounding the village. The team manages to lift a partial print from wrapping the killer used, but not enough to run through the databases.

As nightfall approaches, the tension intensifies. Olga and I retreat to the police station, transforming a small conference room into our temporary command center. The walls are lined with maps of the area, photographs of the crime scene, and notes on potential leads. The atmosphere is thick with the urgency of the situation, and the clock ticking towards Christmas Day adds an ominous undertone to our efforts.

I'm poring over the Collins' personal records, searching for any connection, any detail that might have been overlooked, when Olga calls out from across the room. "Chen, come look at this."

She's been combing through the local social media groups, tracking any unusual activities or posts. What she's found sends a chill down my spine. A series of posts from a local man, Nathanial Brooks, stand out. His profile is a collage of disturbing imagery and rants about the 'loss of traditional values.' His fixation on Christmas traditions and his disdain for those who don't celebrate in the 'proper way' mirror the sentiments expressed in the killer's video.

We delve deeper into Nathanial's background. Locals say he's a loner, mostly keeping to himself. His history reveals a troubled childhood, bouncing from one foster home to another, each experience more harrowing than the last. Records show a pattern of mental health issues, largely untreated due to his distrust of institutions.

We uncover that Brook's last known residence is a secluded cabin in the woods, a few miles outside of town. It's the kind of place that someone would choose if they wanted to stay hidden, away from prying eyes. The details fit too well with our suspect's profile, and we can't afford to ignore this lead.

I immediately call the district attorney's office, laying out the evidence and the urgency of the situation. The prosecutor is quick to understand the gravity, and within an hour, we have a signed search warrant in hand.

—

As dusk settles over Saranac Lake, we organize a small team of state troopers and local police and make our way to Brooks' cabin.

The cabin is located deep in the woods, a good distance from the nearest road. We leave our vehicles and proceed on foot, navigating the dense forest under the cloak of twilight. The crunch of snow under our boots and the distant call of a lone owl are the only sounds breaking the silence of the winter evening.

I glance over at Olga. Her face is illuminated by the beam of her flashlight cutting through the darkening woods.

"Stay close to me and keep your eyes peeled," I remind her in a low voice. Her response is a silent nod, her icy blue eyes scanning the surroundings.

As we approach the cabin, the eerie atmosphere intensifies. Brooks' place is surrounded by an excessive amount of Christmas decorations, but there's nothing joyful about them. The lights are a mix of harsh blues and reds, blinking erratically. Twisted figures of elves and reindeer populate the yard, their expressions more menacing than merry. A large, dilapidated Santa figure stands near the entrance, its once-jolly face now cracked and peering soullessly into the night.

The sight of a snowmobile parked haphazardly near the cabin solidifies our suspicions. Its tracks, identical to the ones we had found at the Collins house, are a clear indication that we've come to the right place.

We fan out, taking positions around the cabin, ensuring no exit is left uncovered. I signal to Olga and two other officers to follow me to the front door. With my hand resting on my sidearm, I lead the way up the creaky steps, the sound of our footsteps seeming unnaturally loud in the stillness.

We position ourselves by the door, the tension palpable in the frigid air. I knock forcefully, announcing our presence. "Nathanial Brooks, this is the New York State Police! We have a warrant to search the premises. Open the door!"

Silence greets us. The only response is the creak of the dilapidated decorations in the cold breeze. I knock again, louder, repeating our announcement. Still, there's no answer, no sign of movement within.

I exchange a look with Olga and the other officers, a silent consensus forming.

"Prepare to breach," I whisper, signaling to the officer carrying the ram. We step back, giving him space as he positions himself in front of the door. With a swift, practiced movement, he slams the ram against the door, the sound echoing through the woods. After a couple of forceful hits, the door gives way, swinging open to reveal the dark interior of the cabin.

We enter the cabin, weapons drawn, cautiously moving through the threshold. The faint glow of our flashlights reveals a living space consumed by chaos and neglect. Tattered curtains hang limply at the windows, swaying gently in the draft. The air inside is stale, heavy with the scent of mold and something acrid that I can’t identify.

As we progress deeper into the cabin, the sound of a Christmas carol playing on a record player becomes audible. The melody is hauntingly familiar - "Silent Night," but it's played at a slower speed, giving it a surreal, almost ghostly quality.

We methodically clear each room, finding no one inside.

Finally, we reach the room where the record player is located. The sight that greets us is unsettling – a cluttered space filled with bizarre trinkets and disturbing drawings plastered on the walls. The record player sits on a rickety table, its needle dragging across the vinyl in a slow, methodic rhythm.

As I step closer, something catches my eye—a series of wires running from the record player, intricately connected to what appears to be a homemade explosive device. The realization hits me like a punch to the gut: the record player is rigged to set off the explosives when the record ends.

"Explosives!" I yell, my voice sharp with urgency. "Everyone out, now!"

Olga and the other officers react instantly, turning on their heels and sprinting towards the exit. We move as fast as we can, the haunting strains of "Silent Night" chasing us as we evacuate the cabin.

As we clear the threshold, the final notes of the carol play out, a foreboding silence falling for a brief moment. Then, with a deafening roar, the cabin erupts into a ball of fire and smoke, the force of the explosion sending shockwaves through the forest.

The night sky is briefly illuminated by the fiery blast. The force knocks me off my feet, sending me sprawling into the snow. Debris rains down around me as I huddle on the ground, ears ringing and hearts racing.

Scrambling to my feet, my first thought is Olga. I call out her name, my voice strained against the disorienting aftermath.

"Volkova!"

There's no immediate response, the smoky air thick with the scent of charred wood and explosives. My flashlight, still clutched in my hand, cuts through the haze as I search frantically.

Then, a few feet away, I spot her. Olga is lying on the snow, dazed and disoriented. I rush over, my mind racing with concern.

For a split second, as I look down at her disheveled form in the snow, my mind plays a cruel trick on me. I see Julie, her body broken and lifeless after the hit-and-run accident that tore her away from me. I blink hard, forcing the haunting image from my mind, refocusing on the present.

Kneeling beside her, I quickly scan her for injuries.

"Olga, can you hear me?" I ask, gently shaking her shoulder.

Her eyes flutter open, meeting mine with a look of shock. "Chen?" she murmurs, her voice barely above a whisper.

She manages to sit up, her face etched with a mix of pain and confusion. "I think I'm okay," she says, more to herself than to me.

A quick assessment reveals no serious injuries, just a few cuts and bruises.

"I got you," I reassure her, offering my hand to help her up. She grips it firmly, pulling herself to her feet with a grunt of effort.

I quickly turn my attention to the other officers. My flashlight sweeps across the snowy ground, looking for any signs of the others. That's when I see him – Sergeant Reynolds, lying motionless a few yards away.

My heart sinks as I rush to his side. The blast has thrown him against a tree, and it's clear he's gravely injured. I kneel beside him, assessing his condition with a sinking feeling. His breathing is shallow, his face pale and contorted in pain.

I call out to Olga, my voice urgent. "Volkova, get over here! We need help!"

She's by my side in an instant, her training kicking in as she assesses the situation. She barks into the radio, "Officer down, we need immediate medical assistance. Repeat, officer down!"

I try my best to provide first aid. His injuries are severe, and I do my best to stem the bleeding, but it's clear that he needs more help than we can provide here in the woods.

The sergeant's eyes flicker open, meeting mine. He tries to speak, but only a faint whisper comes out. I lean in closer, trying to catch his words.

"Chen," he whispers, his voice barely audible over the crackling flames and distant sirens. "Get the… Get the fucking bastard."

I nod, fighting back the emotion that threatens to overwhelm me. "I will. I promise."

His hand weakly grasps mine, a silent plea for reassurance. "Make... make sure..." His voice trails off, his grip loosening.

Reynolds' eyes close slowly, and despite our efforts, his breathing becomes more labored, eventually stopping altogether.

The reality of the situation hits me hard. This isn't just a chase for a deranged killer anymore. He killed one of our own. It's personal.
