Everyone was pushed away from the beach and subsequently ousted from the campgrounds, the entire park being shut down for the foreseeable future. Since the phones and radios weren't working, Dave and Hector helped me load Michael into the back of my van. I drove like hell. The nearest hospital was a clinic twenty minutes away from the campgrounds in the town of Alexandria Springs. They were equipped with enough to handle breaks, bruises, burns, and your general camping injuries. Anything more serious would result in an airlift to the much larger hospital in Orlando.



Ten minutes into my drive, The Sheriff spotted us and pulled ahead of my vehicle, lights flashing and sirens blaring. Adam Parker often drank with Michael and me down at the Old Irish Pub, so he knew I wouldn't have been driving like this without reason. Leading our convoy without the intended destination would have been difficult, if all of Alexandria Springs didn't fit down one four-lane thoroughfare. He peeled off as we turned into the clinic, circling back around a few moments later to see what was going on.



By the time the Sheriff rejoined us, the nurses had come out, and we all loaded Mike onto a gurney. He was catatonic. They tried smelling salts, sternum rubs, and even a shot of epinephrine. No attempt at rousing any response from him worked, and his body seemed to outright reject the drug, oozing all of the medication right back out of the injection site. His eyes reacted to light, and he was breathing, albeit shallowly and slowly. Michael also seemed to be burning up, almost painfully hot to the touch.



Nurse Joy told us that he would need more intensive care but that they hadn't been able to reach the hospital to request a helicopter. We offered to drive him there, but it was over three hours by car, and they weren't sure how his condition would progress. Instead, he was moved to a backroom, and we were enlisted as help to cool him down with wet washcloths. Each pass with the soaked linen resulted in a burst of steam, but little by little, the six-man team had managed to bring his temperature down to a normal level. The two nurses instructed us to keep him cool while they went to check their other patients. Hector split off to head back to the park and make sure there wasn't any more trouble from the remaining guests, while Sheriff Parker went to secure coffee and energy drinks.



Dave and I worked in ten minute shifts, alternating between wiping down Mike and filling the buckets with fresh and clean, cool water. As I was wiping down the forty-six-year-old ranger, I noticed that his skin had begun to turn an odd shade of pallid green. It was not unlike the fish that I had spotted at the bottom of the springs earlier. I started to panic, quickly pressing my fingers to the side of his throat to check for a pulse while calling for help. The throb of his heartbeat was strong; it felt as though my fingers were not on a vein but resting directly against his heart. I pulled my hand back as the nurses returned to the room, trying to get out of the way. However, as I did so, the rotten flesh emulsified and peeled away.

I wanted to throw up. Thick yellow ooze pooled in my gloved hand and reeked of pus and pestilence. One of the nurses stepped forward to investigate the new wound on his throat, only to collapse under the weight of her own body and feint. The most senior nurse, Joy, directed us to move her to a nearby cushioned bench seat while she looked at Mike.



Once Dave and I managed to put the younger girl into the resting spot, I rejoined to watch. Nurse Joy used a cotton swab to probe around the site of the peeled-back flesh, causing a sheet on the side of his neck to deteriorate and splash onto the bed. It instantly stained that same putrid yellow color, tinged with hints of violent red blood. However, beneath the stinking, wretched mess lay plush, soft, pink skin; the kind of skin you'd expect to find on a newborn baby.



Morbidly curious, or unsure of what else to do, nurse Joy continued to poke and prod. As more skin melted and sloughed off his form, I stepped forward and helped with my gloved hand. His skin squelched and squished under our touch, the rubber flesh slipping along the greasy ooze beneath until it covered the bed, the floor, and our clothes. Trying to clean off the shedding skin around his hair led to a vile, tearing sound, like wet velcro that was mashed a little too tightly together. We probably should have stopped, more correctly, I probably should have stopped when nurse Joy did. But instead, I gripped tighter against his emulsifying flesh and wrenched against his hairline and beard. Finally, it gave way, and I was so satisfied I almost didn't mind the sickly smelling viscera splashing against my face. Almost.



I did throw up now. Contained mostly within the small plastic trashcan, I puked up the half coffee and bagel I had eaten for breakfast. Then, I scrubbed harshly against my face with soap and water in a surprising silence. Despite the victory and subsequent horror, no one was saying anything. I dried my face with a paper towel and turned around to see what was happening, only to find Dave and Joy in stunned silence. Following their gaze, I too found myself unable to speak.



Resting atop the gore-sundered cot lay Michael, pink flesh slowly returning to its normal, lightly tanned hue. What drew my eye first was the area I had been working on last, his face, and dark black beard. It hadn't been black when he was wheeled into this building, nor was his hair. Yet now, as he lay on this table, all of his hair was. The man before me was noticeably thinner, his exposed arms were densely packed with sinewy muscle, and the beer gut that I was accustomed to had deflated. Scrubbing away the layer of putrescence left him looking twenty years younger. Was that a byproduct of him falling into the water? Had it rejuvenated him?

Surprising all of us, Mike's hands twitched and then raised, wiping away crusty bits of ragged flesh that still clung to his eyes. I held my breath as he straightened up and stretched, as though he was waking up from a normal night's rest.



"Something stinks." He murmured to himself, finally opening his eyes and looking around. His eyes, a more vibrant shade of blue than before, opened wide and darted back and forth to all of the stunned faces in the room.



Rooted to the tile she stood on, nurse Joy was the first to verbally venture forward. "How do you feel?" Dave and I exchanged nervous glances before returning our gaze to our mutual acquaintance, who now seemed so vastly different.



"A little hot, maybe. Otherwise, I feel healthy as a horse." Michael quirked a brow at what he believed was a strange line of questioning. Then he realized he was sitting in a pile of pus and viscera, recoiling as his hand touched the chartreuse puddle. He sprang out of bed, retching, but narrowly managed to keep his own bile down. His eyes asked the question that he couldn't choke out, 'Is that from me?' And we all nodded.



It was surreal to watch his expression as he finally caught sight of himself in the mirror over the sink. Mike touched his face and stroked his hair, pinched his arm, and even slapped himself. I couldn't blame him for assuming that this was a dream. Who would've rightly assumed that they'd regressed twenty years back into their prime?



The Sheriff returned, and the ordeal played out once more, shock and confusion at the suddenly young man. The same question was raised again and again, 'What happened?' As I explained the morning's events to the nurses and the Sheriff, I remembered that the artifacts I had dredged up were still at the park, and the pictures I had taken should've been printed by now. Hopefully, someone had been smart enough to collect the oddities from the sand where I had left them. The nurses stayed, and the rest of us returned to our vehicles to make our way back towards the campgrounds.



Throughout the whole drive, Mike couldn't stop looking at himself in the vanity mirror of the sunshade. "I just don't believe it. I look younger. I feel better. My bad knee feels good as new, and I haven't breathed this clearly through my nose in a decade!" He laughed, pleased with the changes.



"Nothing feels... off?" I was hesitant to bring his mind back to the horrors I had found in the water. The fish genocide weighed heavily on my mind, all of them the same odd pale green that Mike was before he melted in my hands.



"No, nothing, not a damn thing. I feel like I could run all the way back to camp and not even get winded. I don't know what's in that water, but falling in is the best thing that's happened to me in years, Jay." His voice was deeper and smoother too, not quite so gruff and gravelly.



The rest of the ride was silent, with Michael staring at himself in the mirror, and me stealing glances at the young stranger. Being so young and so fit again must have been an amazing feeling; there was a cold, quiet ounce of yearning that burned in my gut.



The closed gates of the park rolled aside to allow us to re-enter. That meant that they'd gotten all of the visitors out in the few hours we had been away. Good. If any of them saw Mike's changes, then they may want to get into the water too, and I still wasn’t sure if I could trust it.



The visitor center, at the top of the hill near the springs, was abuzz with activity from all of the park rangers. Making my way inside with Michael left the room bereft of the activity we had seen through the windows. Those who were here had all gathered to stare at my developed photos, pinned to a nearby corkboard, but their idle chatter regarding the strange images stopped the moment one of them caught sight of Mike. For a final time, the same conversation from the clinic played again, complete with all the questions about how he felt and all the strange gratitude for the reinvigorated look. Maybe if Mike knew about the laborious process that had changed him, he would be less excited to brag about his luck.



As the others clouded around the revitalized ranger, I slipped over to the corkboard to look at the printed pictures. Each one had been blown up to the size of a full page, and while slightly grainy, the subjects were explicitly clear.



The dead fish. Now I had to wonder if they were really dead? Their scales and skin all bore the same mottled green skin as Michael's. Had they all been going through a metamorphosis beneath the clouded water?



The malformed gator with the third eye. The photo I had gotten was unfortunately before its eye was fully open, but even so, I could still slightly see through the slit. Pale white bordered the dark mass that I assumed was an Iris, but it didn't reflect back a red glow as reptilian eyes often did. I wasn't able to glean any further information from the squinting eye and only had more questions. If the liquid was rejuvenating whatever fell into it, then how had this alligator grown an extra eye? I had found it parked next to the wound. Was the liquid's effect stronger there? Or had the gator suffered some other fate by eating the stringy flesh?



Finally, the bleeding flesh. My mind had decided that was what it was in these photos, and no matter how much I tried to tell myself that it was something else, I couldn't break that notion. What was the cause of the blood, though? What was bleeding? I hadn't seen any wounded animals, just the gaping hole of the very sand itself. It couldn't have been our spring that was weeping crimson, right?



On a small table just beside the corkboard were the items that I had recovered from the ichor pit. The stringy flesh had dried into a brittle crisp that snapped and began to disintegrate beneath my touch. The small chunk of rock was now very clearly a small chunk of bone. Finally, the fish corpse, which had inflated into a grotesque sphere. A twisted vision of what might have happened to Mike if we hadn't intervened. What had we done that had saved him from that fate?



As a group, we ventured down the long hill towards the springs. The winding concrete path felt agonizingly slow, littered with the signs of fleeing visitors and being loomed over by the strange pool below. Normally, the rangers would've paused to pick up the wayward trash and scattered food, but not today. Their focus was entirely on the water that we trudged towards. Rabbits, squirrels, and raccoons capitalized on the treats, barely paying us any heed as we walked past.



Returning to the retaining wall, the pool looked different than before. It was still murky and dyed that hideous shade of red, but now the signs of life had partially returned. The surface of the water rippled from movement below, and the fish were visible whenever they neared the surface. While the water of the pool had begun to turn with life again, the forest seemed to be holding its breath. The life that we could feel from the forest was very different from the life that we could see in the waters. The waters brimmed with potential and excitement while the forest hissed with warning.



The air between us was terse with excitement, hesitation, and yearning. I could tell just by looking at some of their faces that a select few of the rangers wanted to take a plunge. The look on their faces was the very same one that was growing in my stomach; I was just kept at bay by fear. The older members had edged closer and closer to the wall, peering down the drop into the water below. I opened my mouth to object to the developing course of action, but not even a breath escaped before the Sheriff's boots had left the stone.



He was merely the leading general of this suicidal charge. Fully dressed and fully equipped with his badge and gun, he dove from the ledge, followed closely by four others. The younger people stayed on the ledge and exchanged nervous glances, watching with a lump in our throats as this squad of seniors splashed in the springs. I expected a long and uncomfortable afternoon of cooling and peeling the flesh from these people, but they didn't exit the water. With no fear in their hearts, there was no urgency to climb out of the ichorous liquid. Shit, were we gonna have to pull them out of the water when they collapsed?



Only a minute had passed before Mike collapsed, so I waited with baited breath for the group to collapse. But then one minute passed. Then two. Five, ten, thirty. As they crawled through the shallow waters or ventured out into the deeper areas to swim in circles, nothing happened. We had needed to actively cool Michael earlier, but now, the springs' naturally cool water was sparing them from spontaneous immolation. Every few minutes, they would swim past each other, shaking their heads to confirm that nothing had happened yet.



At the hour-and-a-half mark, their movements began to slow. My initial assumption was exhaustion, plain and simple, but then the green flush to their skin deepened into an unmistakable shade. The Sheriff was the first to slip under the water, then the rest of the swimmers followed in short order. They were too far out for any of us to safely save them, resigning us to watch in horror and pray they would resurface before long. We didn't time how long they were under the water, so it felt excruciatingly long before their heads finally breached.



They were screaming. It was deafening, even at this distance, primal and raw, as though the screams themselves were shredding through their victims' throats. One by one, they rose, their voices joining a harmonizing chorus of suffering and anguish. It wasn't long before they were fighting against themselves, clawing hands, tearing flesh asunder. They tore and thrashed and writhed, churning over and over in the water until it became a bubbling froth. Sandra was closest to the stairs, and she flung herself up them, trying to run towards us and flee from the pain. Outside of the water's grace, she collapsed unconscious, mashing her face against the lip of the top stair, cracking her skull and bleeding profusely onto the stone and into the dirt.



As her voice waned and fled the chorus, we were shocked and stunned into silence and inaction. Rather than peeling, the putrid flesh clinging to her body began to expand and swell, bloating towards a crescendo. As the distant screams began to soften, I broke from my trance and rushed forward to help, but it was too late. The moment my hand lay against her skin, it popped. It was a gentle pop, much more like a quick smush than anything else. A long line split from her shoulder down across her back, like a stitched seam tearing open. The plush skin was pushed aside by an ocean of blood and pus, which escaped and stained the sand or cascaded down the stairs back into the pool. The screams of terror returned, but it was just me, unleashing a frightened yelp at the goo-stained skeleton clinging to the pathway up from the water.



The hours that followed were bittersweet. Those who had swam were preoccupied with their new, younger forms, individually looking twenty to forty years younger and far more fit than any of us had ever seen them. The rest of us mournfully collected Sandra's remains into a large unlabeled box. She had no immediate family here in Alexandria, and she constantly griped that she hadn't heard from her children in years. We were the only people left to mourn the sudden and violent tragedy.



After putting her bones inside her trailer, we all scattered for the night. Cots were set up in the station, and I claimed one, far too tired to drive all the way home. Maybe I should have. The changed members of the group spent a long time drinking and partying to loud music.



Unconsciousness found me at some point, which I don't remember, then the soft glow of sunrise roused me. I found silence in the station, which was unusual, as all of the rangers were early risers. I quickly pulled on the clothes I had been wearing before my dive yesterday, and rushed out to see where everyone was. The lodge itself was occupied only by the scent of brewed coffee, discarded sleeping bags, and cots and blankets scattered across the floor. Through the big bay windows, I could see people gathered at the water's edge once more.

I sprinted down the winding stone path as fast as I could, trying to get a glimpse at why the rangers had ventured down the hill. Finally breaching through the trees, there were only five people on the beach - apparently the Sheriff hadn't gone home last night either. In the water, the remaining three rangers swam in small circles or floated idly around. These three, Dave, Chris, and Jasmine, were already far younger than the rest of the people here. They didn't NEED the restorative effects of the water! If the pool took twenty years off their lives, they would be children again.



The water sang an alluring song of promises to me, one that I had an extremely difficult time ignoring. At thirty-seven years old, I could lose twenty years and it wouldn't be as problematic. I couldn't lie and say that I wasn't envious of my friends' more youthful visages; it was a feeling that had been building in my heart since Mike woke up. Still, fear stayed my hand. The others must have been able to sense my yearning, as they tried to goad me into joining the younger people in the water, but I refused. There were too many questions that didn't have answers for me to willingly walk down those steps.



We barely knew anything regarding the ichorous water, merely the stages of transformation after bathing in the pool; there was still the potential for lingering side effects, and we didn't know why the gore was affecting us this way. If someone entered the water, they would be fine for a little while as long as they remained there. Failing that, they would suffer a spell of unconsciousness as their body progressed through the metamorphosis. If the body was kept sufficiently cool, whether by remaining in the water or being bathed in cold water, it would eventually bloat and their skin would be virescent. Once their skin had fully soured, it needed to be peeled away from their body or else it would continue to bloat until they eventually exploded in a shower of viscera and pus. Should the person be able to absolve themselves of the tainted flesh, they would be born again, in new, far younger flesh and blood. The age at which each individual would regress seemed to be dependent on the bather.



I had only been on the shore for ten minutes when the bodies in the water went slack and drifted below. Just as the older rangers and the Sheriff the day before, the swimmers began to thrash and seize beneath the surface, but today it was a far quicker process. Yesterday had been agonizing, and watching the process felt like it took hours, but now it was over as quickly as it began.



The bodies exiting the water were not as drastically changed, missing only a few years at most. They still benefitted from toned musculature, fuller hair, and clearer skin. I couldn't help but rethink my aversion to the liquid. Chris, Jasmine, and Dave joined the rest of the campground staff and celebrated how much better they looked and felt. It was surreal to be the only one who had not yet swum in the pool.



"Alright, Jay. You're up." Michael said, the group moving in an amorphous blob to completely surround me. I swallowed hard. Suddenly, I realized that if they decided I needed the effects of the pool, I would be powerless to stop them. Sure, I was a physically healthy guy, but I wasn't prideful enough to say that I could fend off eight newly reinvigorated people.



"I dunno, guys. I mean, you look great and all, but..." My voice trailed off, unable to rationalize all of the reasons I was hesitant about the lake.



"Come on, Jay, don't be a pussy!" Jasmine laughed and shoved me playfully, and the other laughed as I stumbled slightly.



"Dude! Look at us, that water is great!" Dave caught me as I stumbled backwards, speaking almost directly into my ear.



"Well, no, I know you guys look great, and it's really tempting, but what about Sandra?" They were standing on the gore stain where she had collapsed and died. At my mention of her name, a shock of sadness split across their faces. In their excitement over the benefits they were reaping from the pool, they must have forgotten the horrible death of their coworker and friend.



"That won't happen to you. You've spent more time in that water than any one of us. If anything, you deserve this more than any of us. The spring is your home, not your grave." Mike stepped forward and placed a hand on my shoulder, speaking softer and more earnestly than I had heard him before.



My gaze drifted to the water that I had spent years playing in. I wasn't born here, but my family had lived in this sleepy town since I was an infant. I could hardly remember anywhere else. Maybe Mike was right. Maybe the bounty of this water was my birthright.



"JAY! JAY! JAY! JAY! JAY!" Lost in my thoughts, I was only snapped back to reality by the rhythmic chanting of my name. The small crowd pumped their fists and smiled at me, moving to give me a clear path to the water. The chant turned into a harmonious cheer as I stepped towards the water with a sheepish grin on my face. Hidden behind the chanting of my friends was a nearly inaudible whisper from the forest, begging me to turn back.



I stripped off my jeans and T-shirt before ambling down the stairs and allowing the frigid water to fully embrace me. It didn't physically feel any different from the thousands of times I had swam before, but there was a spiritual mysticism to my dip. Trying to describe the feeling in my heart left me with only strange abstract concepts, swimming through the very heart of Mother Nature or wading against the current in the river of time. My consciousness didn't feel like it was truly my own as euphoria carried me deeper and deeper into the water.



It was hard to keep track of time while I was floating blissfully through the water. My mind was preoccupied with the joy that I felt from swimming and ducking beneath the water to play alongside the fish. I had completely forgotten about the torturous ordeal that I was required to suffer until I felt the burning sensation on my thigh. Despite the frigidity of the water, my leg began to burn, scorching and throbbing as though it were directly in a fire. The pain spread. Agonizingly slow, that napalm burn crawled through my veins, spreading away from where it initially started. I moved through the water faster, desperately hoping that I would strike a cool spot and feel even a moment's relief.



I looked to the beach with panic in my eyes, hoping to scream out that something was wrong. However, as I opened my mouth, no noise would escape. The infernal claws had claimed my lungs and my vocal chords, and I was unable to rouse the group on the beach for any aid. How fucking stupid was I? How had I let myself be peer-pressured into jumping into the water? I had been so against it until Mike convinced me. Why had I taken his word as gospel? He was unconscious for this whole transformation.



The incineration finally reached my eyes, and I dreamed of digging my fingers into the soft gelatinous orbs and tearing them out. Sparks of white clouded my vision as my hands rose for their anointed task, robbing my sight right as my fingers drove towards my face.



Losing consciousness was a god sent gift that momentarily granted me reprieve from hell on earth. But the blackness of sleep only lasted a few short moments before I was thrust back into pain. Like dull and bent blades, my fingers tore into the soft flesh of my forehead and peeled away a harvest of rotting meat. Each clawful of meat brought a tearing sensation, seasoned with the electric snaps of breaking nerves and synapses. I immediately forgot about the hellfire that I had been experiencing before, as this new excruciating ordeal surprisingly surpassed that torment. My entire body itched as though I was being devoured by ants and scavenged over by spiders and rats. Wailing in Agony, I continued to scrape and scar and gouge the old flesh from my body, trying desperately to rend the imaginary chewing creatures from my body.



Falling back under the water as I tried to shred the skin from my body, I temporarily lost my sense of direction and began to thrash in a wild panic. Gulping in the red-stained liquid, my lungs began to ache and burn, begging for oxygen. However, my mind was too focused on the task of tearing.



I don't remember if I lost consciousness beneath the water again, as the next thing I could remember was climbing to my feet at the stairs. As I vomited up the colored liquid that filled my lungs and gut, the crowd of onlookers cheered at my success in the pool. I could hardly believe it as I saw the missing scars on the back of my hands. It had been a harrowing and hellish experience, but finally looking into a pocket mirror and seeing a twenty-something-year-old man with brighter eyes and no wrinkles looking back made it clear that it had been worth it.
