I didn’t believe in any of it. Not really.

Demons, rituals, salt circles... all that stuff just felt like folklore—old cautionary tales wrapped in mystery. That’s probably why we laughed when Dev pulled out that weird old book.

It was Friday night. Me, Dev, Jay, and Alina were hanging out at Jay’s house. His parents were away for the weekend, and we were deep into one of those nothing nights—lazy, tired, half-buzzed, half-bored. Dev had been digging through a box of his dad’s things in the basement when he found it. This heavy, leather-bound book with cracking edges and pages that looked like they’d been stained by time—or something worse.

The title said:  
***"The Lesser Key of Solomon."***

Most of it looked like junk: faded Latin, weird symbols, dramatic warnings. But Dev turned to one of the marked pages, finger tapping an underlined name. “**Orobas**,” he said. *“Says here he tells the truth, protects people. One of the good ones.”*

Jay laughed. *“A chill demon? You gotta be kidding me!”*

Alina rolled her eyes, already over it. I don’t know what made me say it. Was it boredom, too much beer, or sheer curiosity? But I said, *“Let’s summon him.”*

We weren’t being serious. It was just something dumb to kill the time, get some laughs. Maybe get a few clips to post later. We lit a few tea candles from the junk drawer, sat in a circle on the cold concrete floor, and Dev read the words out loud.

We skipped most of the steps. We couldn't be assed to go through all that and waste time. No protective circle. No fancy herbs or incense. Just candlelight and bad decisions.

And? Nothing happened. That just made us laugh harder. It was fun—we bashed each other, tried to scare each other a bit, and ultimately shrugged it off and went to play Mario Kart.

But after about twenty minutes, the basement door creaked open. Jay swore he’d shut it tight.

But those doors were iffy... He went and locked it. We still got some laughs, saying maybe the chant succeeded.

Then we heard a soft knock upstairs. Just once. Soft enough to not be intrusive, but sharp enough to stop our talking. Then came the sound of a pan hitting the floor in the kitchen.

Jay went up to check. Came back frowning. “The pan wasn’t even near the edge. It was pushed off, probably the damned cat.”

I remember Alina saying something like, *“Must’ve been the draft”,* but I wasn’t convinced. The air felt heavier. Not cold exactly, just... wrong. I didn’t feel at ease anymore. Something felt off.

Then something slammed into the wall behind us. Loud. Deliberate. Hard!

We all jumped—even Dev looked rattled, and he was the one that didn’t get pushed off the rails easily. I saw that he looked freaked out... terrified at this point.

He grabbed the book again and started reading more closely. His brow furrowed, and the rest now realized this wasn’t a prank anymore.

*“Orobas, if summoned without circle or seal, may wander freely. Though not of harm by hand, he grows stronger through fear and time. He may torment, mislead, and draw harm from the world to you, to reveal the truth. At the final hour, when shadow becomes flesh, he may touch. He may take. Protection lies in circles of salt and in the light. He cannot cross either unless broken. If he does not possess a soul until daybreak, he shall return to his realm.”*

Jay’s laugh came out sharp and short. “*Nice. Real funny.”*

Then we all heard it. Breathing. Right next to my ear. Cold, uneasy, and damp—and very much there.

I freaked out, turned, expecting something, someone—nothing.

Dev’s voice cracked when he shouted. *“We didn’t bind it! It says right here—no binding, no control.”*

More noises upstairs. Then a bulb popped in the stairwell.

Alina screamed. Jay cursed. I didn’t say anything—I was trying not to lose my shit.

We scrambled. Dev tried googling binding rituals. Yes, funny, but not so funny when we faced something we didn't understand... This was supposed to be fun, a joke! We realized all too late that it wasn't.

I ran upstairs and grabbed a bag of salt and we poured it around us in a shaky ring, all of us standing close now, barely speaking, undecided if we should watch around us... or each other.

Then the lights started dying.  
One bulb. Then another. Then another. Pop... pop... pop... Always just outside the circle. The darkness was creeping closer with each pop. We knew—we knew we were in real danger now.

I held up my phone’s flashlight. It flickered. But the battery was full. It shouldn’t have.

Dev read again, barely above a whisper.  
*“He may not touch the soul unless it slips from light into dark. Or into dream.”*

*“Don’t fall asleep,”* Alina said, and her voice broke halfway through.

*“I don't think that will be a problem,”* Dev said. *“Doubt anyone could sleep.”*

It was now 4.25 AM....  
And we **-just-** had to make it until sunrise.  
Time went slow...but it moved...

The next hour... I don’t even know how to describe it right.

There were scratching sounds. Not constant, just enough to keep you from forgetting. A chair skidded across the floor by itself. Something moved in the corner, just outside the light, but when I looked, it wasn’t there. Not gone. Just... wasn’t.

Then... something happened that made us aware we were indeed not safe... the gas.

It hit all at once. Sharp, sour. Alina started coughing.

The burner upstairs. Someone had turned it on.

But we’d all been downstairs.

We didn’t want to leave the salt circle, but we couldn’t just sit there and let the house fill with gas.

We decided to go up together, slowly. One person always shining the light on the others. Like kids playing flashlight tag in a haunted house.

The burner was on, full blast. The knob was gone. Yanked off.

Jay found the valve under the counter. Turned it off with pliers. I took the handle, shoved it into my hoodie pocket.

Then the phone lights flickered again.

We ran. We ran like hell, we held a grip on each other, and we just ran.

Back into the basement. Into the salt. We didn’t talk anymore. We just breathed—shaky and quiet.

I remember looking out the small basement window and seeing the sky start to go that weird bluish gray. Just barely. Just enough to believe it might end—it might be over.

Everything was silent. No more noise. No more draft. Nothing moved. Everything was... peaceful. Just that nice warm feeling of first sunrays on the skin.  
That sunrise came slow. It always does when you’re watching it. When it finally did, I felt like I’d been holding my breath for hours.

Alina stood up, stiff. *“It’s over, right?”*

Dev was still sitting there. He hadn’t said much in a while.  
Then suddenly—he stood up.

*“I’m going home,”* he said.

*“What? No. Wait, Dev—”*

*“I’m tired,”* he said. *“I just want to sleep.”*

He said something else under his breath. I didn’t hear it. But Jay froze.

*“What did you say?”*

Dev looked confused. *“Nothing. Good night.”*  
And then he left.

We didn’t follow.

We started cleaning. We had a lot to clean—the mess, candles, broken lights... the salt circle. Just trying to return the room to something normal.

Then Jay said, quietly, *“The circle.”*

We turned. He was staring at the floor.

There was a break. A line in the salt where someone had stepped in too fast. A single heel mark that had smeared the edge.  
**-A gap.-**

And Dev had been sitting right near that spot.

We just stared at it.  
Didn’t speak.  
Didn’t clean it.  
Didn't want to admit it was there.

And Dev hasn’t answered any of our calls since.

We keep telling ourselves he just needed space. That he walked out that morning and went home.

But none of us actually saw him leave.

We just remember the sound of the door.

And when I think back to that moment... I can’t shake this feeling—

What if Dev never made it out of that basement?  
What if we let something else walk away?
