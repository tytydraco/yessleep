It happened seven years ago when I changed schools and got admitted to a new (all-girls) school. It was a government school, so the building hadn’t been renovated in who knows how long. The classroom walls were yellowish with peeling plaster, though the space was large and filled with educational posters and paintings, giving it a somewhat welcoming look.

After my teacher helped me find my classroom, I walked in and greeted my teacher and new classmates happily. I was so excited for my first day at this new school! But the day took a turn for the worse when I got my period right after arriving in the classroom.

I’m a very sensitive person when it comes to my periods. When I realized I’d gotten them on such a special day, my excitement started to fade. I asked my teacher if I could go to the washroom, but she said “NO,” making me feel even more embarrassed. Now, everyone in class was curious about why I’d approached the teacher and then returned to my seat!

Unable to handle the curiosity and whispers, I went back to the teacher and told her directly, “I need to use the washroom because I got my period.” She gave her approval, but then I made a mistake. Instead of just taking a pad from my bag, I awkwardly grabbed my whole bag and left the class. Usually, I keep a pad in my pocket, but I’d forgotten to this time, so I felt too shy to take one out in front of everyone. My teacher looked shocked and asked, “Why are you taking your bag?” Embarrassed, I replied, “My things are in here for the washroom,” and she let me go without further questions.

Our school’s washrooms weren’t attached to the main building but were located in a separate structure at the corner of the courtyard. As I headed there, I felt the eyes of the whole school on me, making me feel even more self-conscious. Instead of walking calmly, I awkwardly ran, which only seemed to draw more attention. I heard some laughter behind me as I finally made it into the washroom.

Inside, the conditions were shocking. The place was dirty, with an unpleasant smell, discarded hygiene products, and stained floors. I felt nauseous. The washrooms had only one tiny window, which barely let in any light. I tried the first toilet, but it was clogged, as was the next. The other stalls either had no water or were unusable.

As I was assessing my options, another girl came in and, instead of using a toilet, sat on the washroom floor and began to relieve herself right there. Shocked, I stood frozen as she finished, gave me a mean look, zipped up, and left.

Finally alone, I locked the door and took care of my needs. When I finished, I went to wash my hands, but the sink’s tap was dry. I checked all the taps in the washroom—still nothing. Frustrated, I headed toward the door, only to hear water start flowing behind me. Turning around, I saw the sink tap now running, so I washed my hands. Just as I was leaving, I heard another sound of water, this time coming from one of the toilets. I checked and turned off the dripping tap.

Then, I heard a different dripping sound, like water slowly dropping into a water mug: drip… drip… drip… It was late, and the bell was already ringing for the next class, so I hurriedly began opening each stall door to check. When I reached the last door, a strong gust of wind blew in, causing the last piece of glass in the tiny window to shatter. I turned to look at it, and just then, I felt a whisper in my ear. Turning toward the sound, I could still hear the dripping water, now louder and more unsettling.

As I opened the last stall door, every hair on my neck stood up, and the dripping sound stopped instantly. Inside, I found the floor covered in water, yet the tap was securely off. Confused, I closed the door, but as I did, the water started spreading quickly, soaking my shoes. In a panic, I wondered why it hadn’t flowed out before, only to hear another whisper, sending a chill down my spine. Ignoring my instincts to turn toward it, I stepped forward. The dripping resumed, louder now. Turning back, I saw the previously closed tap now gushing, filling the stall again.

At this point, I was so fixated on the tap and water that I’d forgotten everything else—until a loud BANG on the door snapped me out of my daze. My classmate was outside, calling my name and telling me to come out. She explained the teacher had sent her to check on me. I hurriedly grabbed my bag and opened the door. She looked at me strangely, asking, “Why did you lock the door? It’s broken.” Unsure how to respond, I simply nodded, and we walked back to class.

Before entering, I glanced back at the washroom, still feeling a lingering sense of dread. That night, I caught a high fever—I don’t know if it was from my period or from the fear that experience left me with. I even cried in my sleep, which had never happened before.

I eventually recovered, made new friends, and shared my story with them. That’s when I learned something unsettling: the year before I joined, the washroom had been the site of strange events. Girls had repeatedly complained of weird sounds and experiences, but the principal dismissed them as rumors.

One incident, however, changed things. Right before summer break, a girl went to the washroom and didn’t return. The teacher went to check on her and found the door locked from the inside. When she called out, there was no response—just the sound of distant, eerie screams. The principal and watchman eventually forced the door open, finding the girl unconscious with purple lips and fingertips. She was rushed to the hospital, but when she regained consciousness, she claimed she couldn’t remember anything, only that she’d heard a whisper before everything went dark.

After this, the principal approved building a new washroom facility, tearing down most of the old one. The remnants of the old washroom, though, were still visible near the new one. Although girls continued to report strange sounds, nothing serious happened again.
