Hello, Reddit. I need to talk about something that's been going on for months now, but I think some background is important.

  
I live in a small town where everyone knows everyone. The type of town where not getting a casserole when you move in means no one wants you around and you should start saving up to move away. I've lived here my whole life, so have all my friends and family. Most everyone is a farmer, and we all get along well. We see each other at church every Sunday, attend barbeques and events, and kids can play outside with no worries about kidnapping. It was a good life.



Then March 23rd came.

  
Nine-year-old Anna Moore's parents went to go wake her and came across a truly horrendous sight. Her room was almost just as they found it. Books on insects on the floor, clothes and papers littering her desk, unfinished homework scattered about. Her blankets were in place, as though she was still sleeping. Her worn-out butterfly plush was ripped apart, and its wings had been placed on her pillows. Her dresser had one drawer open, and some clothes had been taken.

  
Anna had been a bright young girl, so sweet and friendly. She loved insects and could always been seen trying to catch one on her hand. She even liked roaches. I'm twice her age, and I still scream when I see one. It didn't matter how much of a nuisance the bug could be, she loved them. I loved babysitting her.

  
Her mother's scream has never left my mind. I was walking some dogs when I heard it. You know what rabbits sound like when they scream? That was it. Just inhuman and horrific.

  
Her father and brother would go out every night with their shotguns and rifles to try and find her. They'd come my father's bar after with defeated expressions. Defeated isn't even the right word, but I doubt there's a word in any language to get the point across.

  
May 8th.

  
Calla Dollenganger was next. She and her sister, Marie, were seventeen at the time. They were both the sweetest people I'd ever met. They'd always perform at gatherings, and the whole town loved them. Calla was so cheerful and wonderful, and I miss her every single day. Whatever it was that took her.....she didn't deserve it.

  
She had gone missing while camping with some friends. Ben, her ex-boyfriend, had said that she went back to her car to get something and never returned. Everyone searched for her, but all they found were scraps of fabric, strands of her black hair on branches, and her favorite sunglasses. Those red heart frames were smashed to bits. Later on, they said, they heard her voice calling out to them as sweetly as always, but it would get farther and farther away as they got closer.

  
Marie was inconsolable. I remember I tried to give her my condolences on the last day of school, and she just shoved me down. "I hope you're next, Nola!" she had hissed out. "Bring her back!"

  
Don't think badly of her, please. Calla was her favorite person in the whole world.

  
She was found unresponsive in her bed just a month ago. Rumors had swirled around the school hallways the next dat. "She saw the creature. Saw it and lost her soul," they said. I don't know if that's true. Her family will be moving away next week. 

  
June 2nd.

  
Piper Sweeney was after Calla. No one really missed her. She was a bitter and angry teen, the type of person who lashed out at everyone and anyone for things she refused to fully explain. Still, she had her moments where she was so goddamn funny and clever. Her disappearance was blamed on her father, but there's no way he could fake the footprints that were found.

  
Five-inch wide, muddy footprints that dirtied up the carpet and flooring. They were round and weirdly shaped, almost like hooves. Even if he was as drunk as sin, he wouldn't make those. He's an uptight man with more secrets than it's worth getting into. 

  
Younger girls started going missing over the summer. Thirteen, ten, seven, two, four, eleven, five. All at home, all with the doors and windows locked tight.

  
Whatever took them, it hasn't stopped. It just slowed down.

  
Any help is appreciated. Thanks.
