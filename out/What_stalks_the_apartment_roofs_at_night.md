I live in an apartment building of 7 floors, on the the 6^(th) floor and in our vicinity are other apartment buildings ranging from 5 to 9 stories. All the buildings are made of reinforced concrete and are thusly very sturdy and MOSTLY noise proof. My apartment is spacious but not huge, it like all the floors above and below has a pretty large balcony – over three meters in length. But instead of a solid wall separating it’s instead a glass wall with a door that has handles on both sides. These descriptions will be relevant later on.

This whole thing started about a few weeks ago, I hadn’t really pieced that together until later when I was thinking more about it and trying to remember. It started simple, I think I woke up because I really needed to go to the bathroom but maybe it was because of the noise, and my bladder was just accidentally full. Strangely it sounded like tapping or knocking against my blinders behind the glass wall, I liked to keep them down for some privacy as the wall revealed the whole of the living room. A raven probably trying to catch a spider on the blinders or something I figured and sure enough when I clicked the lights on it stopped even though there is no direct sight into the bedroom from the balcony or the living room. And so, I went about my night.

My upstairs neighbours were the worst, easily the worst thing about the apartment. They were a couple who instead of going out to party would host the party even if they invited no one else… And you’d think it’d be just the weekends but no – Tuesday nights as well going well into Wednesday dusk. Worst of all they kept their music low enough to evade anyone else being annoyed by it- just me. And of course, the dancing would just be “jumping” on my head. Bah! I tried talking to them, but it seemed to have no real impact, they would really sweetly say they really like dancing and having fun and promise to keep it down only to go back to it the next week. Despite this really nice and sweet outwards appearance I knew they had some troubles, sometimes instead of the music and the dancing they would argue and yell and scream at each other a few times I think things were thrown.

Then about two weeks ago they put on Lady Gaga- Just Dance, and I listened to it while it played, I really love that song. Afterwards I put on my headphones for the YouTube video I was watching, it seems it was going to be one of those Fridays. Some half an hour later, through my headphones I hear loud glass shattering. For a few brief moments I pull them off and hear the woman’s muffled voice yelling something and the man scream back. I rolled my eyes and just put my headphones back on, it was a double whammy of a day both partying and fighting.

Over the next week I had noticed that I didn’t meet either of them in the lift or coming or going out of the building. And I frequently left to go to the office for work and for my evening walks around the neighbourhood. I felt a pang of guilt, maybe I should have reported their fights, but even if someone was seriously injured, I thought there was no way both of them were.

Finally, I decided to check up on them, I had knocked on their door and rang the doorbell. I could barely make out scurrying, almost like running mainly because it seemed like it was through clutter. I didn’t recall ever hearing any clutter downstairs but maybe because of the thick concrete the sound was just too muted to reach me. As I turned to walk down the stairs back, the lift pinged and out came someone from the same floor. We greeted and they briefly mentioned not seeing them the last few days.

After a few days I was getting into bed and I looked out my window, at first my blood ran cold. It had to have been the first instinct of seeing things move in the dark – I though to myself then. I saw someone run across the roof of one of the taller buildings. Probably some teenagers or something who got a hold of the roof keys I told myself and calmed down. Then the next day I caught the figure on another one of the taller buildings, they were quickly turning their head looking around, for a brief moment I think they looked over to me and I could see a flash in their eyes. My heart once again jumped. It raced. But clearly it was a guy on the roof looking around, I had to calm down. I lowered my bedroom blinders and went to sleep. Sleep hardly came but eventually it did.

Finally, a few days ago, I’m scrolling my phone, unable to fall asleep. And yes, it’s a bad habit I should get out of bed until I feel sleepy, but I just didn’t have the energy. As I was just scrolling social media with no sound, I hear something that resembled wing flaps. Once again, my heart started racing but I took a few deep breaths, obviously it was some bird or bat flying nearby – calm down.

A few more minutes pass, and I get distracted by my social media again. Until I hear the latch on the glass door move open – which pulls the door up on its hinges creating a very distinct and otherwise cool sound. But there is no cool sound when it’s the latch that opens the door from the outside on the 6^(th) floor.

I take a deep breath, my eyes wide, if anything walks in from the balcony and I was unlucky it could spot me in 15 seconds. If it runs – I’m a dead man. The feeling of fear was paralyzing, and it felt like a lifetime, yet I heard the latch finally be fully pressed so only a few seconds at most have passed. I swallowed a big gulp, and taken another deep breath, I quickly stretched out my leg onto the floor followed by the other. I thought maybe if I get under the bed, I’d be safe. In hindsight a dumb thing but it was my gut instinct at the time – like what unhinged serial killer wouldn’t look under the bed.

When the glass doors were opened and had hit the wall gently, I remember the walking “footsteps” so clearly as if I was hearing them now. The most accurate description is of a dog with long claws walking on the floors and you could hear those clinks – or a cat running with it’s claws out just much less hectic. My bed was in the corner of the room, so I pulled completely back to the wall and curled up. I don’t think the thing was searching for long, before it finally came into view – or at least it’s feet, but it felt like literal days had passed.

The legs were frightening they weren’t human; they seemed like large crow’s feet. The talons clicking against the floor with each step. And to both the left and right of the feet seemed to be the “tail” ends of wings with night black feathers. Apart from the talons clicking on the floor with each step the room sounded dead silent. It lingered in the room, I assume looking around as it would move then pause and move again.

Finally, it moved back out of the living room, it checked the kitchen and bathroom before it finally did another full sweep of the apartment. As its final search seemed to yield no results it gave a slight warble and a few clicks, if I didn’t know any better, I’d say it sounded sad.

I stayed under the bed the next morning until 13 the next day. Quiet as a mouse and looking around, listening. Finally, I figured that I should do something, I crawled out, slowly I made my way around, making sure to check every corner. I was faced with the open balcony doors, and I was ready to close them and lower the blinders over them but then I hear tapping, it reminded me of the night a few weeks ago although this time it was against concrete – upstairs. I took another big gulp and decided against doing anything that would make noise.

I got dressed in whatever I could find and left the building; I got into my car and called my friend to stay over. My trusty car got me over to my friend, and I was finally feeling relaxed and safe, they had to go run out to the market to get something. I crashed on the couch, watching some series when I looked out, I saw it again: the eyes. The glowing eyes. Googling it apparently glowing eyes are a feature of predators who hunt in the night and thus need superior night vision – which isn’t humans.

I am now hiding in the closet, I can hear tapping on the windows from time to time and it’s just the same as that first night. My friend should be back from the store soon, and I’ve been texting them not to come back but they think I’m playing an elaborate prank. I fear we both might not make the night.
