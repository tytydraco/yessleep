 I could hear the twigs cracking beneath my feet as I walked through the forest.
The trees loomed ominously above me, their foliage blocking out the moonlight and casting a veil of darkness around me.
I tried to keep calm, but my heart was racing with anticipation as I nervously surveyed the area.
Suddenly, I spotted something in the corner of my eye; a shadow moving quickly between two trees in the distance.


I froze in fear as I watched it slowly slink away into the darkness and vanish from sight.
That was when I started to notice them; figures in the shadows, standing still like statues and watching me from all directions with piercing eyes. 
 Sweat was running down my face as I slowly backed away, trying to keep an eye on them at all times without drawing attention to myself. 
Then, without warning, they started to move towards me, slowly at first and then faster and faster until they were sprinting across the ground towards me with alarming speed! 


 Panic set in as I nervously turned around and started running for my life, their footsteps echoing behind me in unison like an eerie chorus of death.
 As I ran, flashes of black figures made their way through my mind; tall and slender humanoids with pale skin that seemed almost translucent in the moonlight - it was like a vision from some forgotten nightmare! 
 It felt like hours before I finally reached safety, but by then my legs were trembling so badly that I could hardly stand up straight! 
 Then suddenly it hit me; those black figures weren’t following me; they had been chasing something else…something that had been lurking in the shadows just like them…


 A chill ran down my spine as I realized what it was; a pack of wild creatures, black as night and completely silent in the darkness. 
I quickly made my way back home, never wanting to set foot in that place again. 


 I still remember those black figures in the forest, their eyes filled with an eerie hunger that will haunt me forever. 
 I had heard rumors of mysterious creatures living in the depths of the woods, but nothing had prepared me for this.
 In the days and weeks that followed, I could still feel their presence lingering in the air around me, like an invisible cloak of fear that refused to leave my side. 
 I started to avoid that part of the forest at all costs, making sure to keep a safe distance between myself and those dark figures. 


 But deep down, I knew that this was only the beginning; if I ever wanted to find out what really lurked in those shadows, I would have to go back and face my fears head on. 
 So one night I mustered up enough courage to venture out once more into the darkness, hoping against all odds that I would make it out alive. 
 As I slowly approached the edge of the forest, I started to feel a strange presence in the air around me; a presence that seemed to be emanating from those same black figures I had seen before. 
 I could feel my heart pounding as they slowly emerged from the shadows, their pale skin glowing in the moonlight and their eyes staring directly at me with a menacing hunger.


 They seemed to be waiting for something, almost as if they wanted me to join them in their hunt for whatever lurked beyond the trees. 
 I was so scared that I could hardly speak, but eventually I managed to muster up enough courage to take a few tentative steps forward; somehow drawn towards them like a moth to a flame. 
 And that was when it happened; all at once, like some sort of silent command, all of them started running into the darkness and disappeared from sight! 
 They seemed to be leading me somewhere, but with each step I took, my fear grew stronger and stronger and my courage began to waver…


 Eventually we reached our destination; an old abandoned cabin deep in the woods; and without warning they stopped dead in their tracks and began to circle around it silently…like predators stalking their prey! 
 Suddenly one of them stepped forward towards me and pointed towards the cabin door; it was almost as if he were asking me permission to enter!
 My heart was pounding so hard that I thought it might burst out of my chest! But before I could move or even think about what was happening, they all vanished into thin air! 


 Left alone in total darkness, I tentatively stepped forward and opened up the door – only to find myself face-to-face with what appeared to be an ancient ritual chamber filled with dozens of black figures wearing hooded cloaks! 
 Panic set in as they all turned round to face me at once – my legs felt like jelly as they slowly advanced closer towards me - were they going to hurt me? Were they going to kill me? 


 Before I knew it, one of them had grabbed hold of my arm – he had a firm grip on it but his touch felt strangely warm and comforting - almost as if he wanted nothing more than for me understand something important…  Suddenly he pulled back his hood revealing his face – he was a middle aged man with kind eyes and an air of wisdom about him - and immediately my fear began to subside…  He spoke in a gentle voice that seemed strangely familiar “You are not safe here child," he said - "These are dark forces at work here - forces you do not understand - so please go home now”  Then he let go of my arm – almost as if he knew that his words had been understood – before turning back around and rejoining his companions who then quickly vanished into thin air without another word.. 


I stood there for what felt like hours until finally gathering enough strength within myself stumbles home - shaken yet somehow reassured by this mysterious encounter...  When morning came, it was as if nothing happened - everything looked perfectly normal again yet deep down inside something had changed forever  From then on whenever night came calling, no matter how scared or tired i become i can’t help but feel drawn back into those woods again - hoping against hope that i will find answers hidden amongst those ever-present black figures.  So every night i set off once more into the darkness hoping this time ill make it out alive.  Little by little i start understanding more about those mysterious beings - how they move together in unison like an army protecting something hidden behind those trees. Yet every time even after getting close enough i still can’t figure out what its is these cloaked protectors are so desperately trying keep away from prying eyes. But then one night after months searching something happens: One figure separates himself from the others. As though beckoning me closer, he starts walking away from them.  A few moments later we stop before an ancient tree surrounded by thick fog. He pulls aside its heavy branches revealing what looks like entrance. Without thinking twice, i enter. Inside is an underground chamber filled with statues depicting many strange creatures. Suddenly everything becomes clear: these creatures have been guarding something hidden from us humans for centuries. Just when i turn around ready leave ,the figure stops me. His gaze remains fixed on mine for what feels like eternity until finally speaking “This place is not meant for your kind” He said “It is best you leave now”

I tried going in, but he strongly pushed me out and the entrance closed. I tried as hard as i could but it wasn't possible.

I had to go back to my house, but i will find them again.
