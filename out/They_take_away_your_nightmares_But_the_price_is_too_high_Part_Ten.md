[Part Nine]( https://redd.it/12va5pi)

**** 

We rode in silence for about half an hour before Holliman spoke up again, his voice low but hard, as though he was chastising a misbehaving child during a church service.

“This is all unnecessary, you know.  And it will take hours to reach it.  We’ll be driving half the night.”

I tightened my grip on the gun slightly but kept staring out at the road ahead.  “That’s okay.  We have time.  Mrs. Graves won’t be ready for us to visit until in the morning, remember?”

He puffed out a breath and fell silent for a few moments, and when he spoke again, his voice was softer and calmer.  “What are you looking to get out of this, Clint?  Do you think getting answers will make things better?  Because take it from me, knowing more isn’t always a good thing.”

Turning to look at him, Holliman’s face looked drawn and old in the late afternoon light.  We were out on a rural highway, stands of trees on both sides blocking much of the sun as we pushed through patches of bright and dark on the way to…what?  I wasn’t sure.  I didn’t know if even a gun would make him take me to the right place anyway, and I realized in that moment that some of that was my fault.  I had been so focused on what Holliman and Graves meant to me—authority, employment, a door to a better—or at least more interesting—world than I’d known all my life.  But how much did I know about them, really?  And if I was going to stay ahead of them, didn’t I need to understand them?

“Why are *you* doing this?”

He glanced my way and frowned.  “What do you mean?”

“I mean, you and Gracie talk about “serving” and helping people and all that, but why are you doing it really?  You never talk about it.  How you got into this and why you both put yourselves and each other at risk.”

His lips had drawn down into a tight line as I spoke, and for a moment I thought he wasn’t going to answer at all.  When he did, it was slower and more measured, like he was weighing every word before letting it fall from his lips.

“I…I grew up as a very lonely boy.  I was smart and…well, my father called me bookish, though to him I think it was somewhat of a pejorative term.  I didn’t have many friends or much family, and like many who have good imaginations and a desire for life to be different than it is, I found myself drawn to those things that hinted at some other, better world than the one I lived in.”

Smiling weakly, he gave a slight shrug.  “When I was young, it was Bigfoot and aliens.  The Loch Ness Monster and magic and…well, anything else I could find.  Back then there was no internet, so I spent plenty of time at the library and mail ordering those things I could find that seemed exotic and worth the money I’d saved up to buy them.”  He snorted.  “Most of it was trash, of course.  Semi-literate diatribes written by lunatics or charlatans.  People that fed or preyed on the very urge that drove me.  To belong and to be special by finding a hidden world behind the world.  Not just for the promise of what such a new magical world might hold, but because it justified my failure at finding a place in this one.”  His voice grew softer.  “It wasn’t because I was weak or unlikable.   It was because I was meant for something wonderful.  Something better.”

I’d sat the gun in my lap while he talked, and now I felt guilty for having pulled it in the first place.  But no. I couldn’t trust him, not yet anyway.  And what did it say that I had to pull a gun for him to show me the truth?  Still, hearing the embarrassed pain in his voice, I couldn’t help but speak up when he fell silent.  

“Shit, man.  Everybody feels that way sometimes.  Why do you think people do all the crazy shit they do?  Worship celebrities and want to be famous?  They want proof that they don’t suck and that people like them.  Love them, even.”

He nodded.  “You’re right, of course.  But just like everyone else, my pain was tailor-made for me.  It fit me well and traveled along wherever I went.  When I went to college, I thought things might change, but it was largely the same.  Before long, I retreated back to searching for something more, now with the resources of an nascent adult surrounded by enormous libraries and a few strangers that shared a love of the strange.

“Much of it was still bullshit, of course.  The three Ls, I used to call them.  The Lonelys, the Loonies, and the Liars.  The fact that I counted myself among them only made me hate them more, not less, but any contempt I felt was outweighed by my hunger to find something real.”  He glanced my way again, his eyebrow arched.  “And eventually I did.  A few small things at first.  But I was like a desperate prospector that finally gets a bit of gold in his plate.  That taste only makes the hunger worse, as it confirms that you’ve been right all along.

“So I kept pushing.  Edging into groups that were stranger, yes, but I’d developed a keen nose for the bullshit by that point, and I’d keep moving when there was nothing real to be found.  I stepped into the borderlands of several things, but secret things are secret for a reason, and frequently I’d either run into an obstacle I couldn’t overcome or the leads would just dry up.  I was out of college and working by that point, and nearly all my resources were being funneled toward my extracurricular activities, but they were still limited.  And by my mid-thirties I’d grown increasingly bitter and despondent, despite the fact that I’d cultivated a network of contacts and knowledge that had put me deeper into those hidden worlds than my younger self would have ever dreamed possible.  It was never enough, you understand, because it was still always me looking in from the outside.

“Then three things happened within less than a year that changed my life forever.

“The first was that I met a small group that was very close to making contact with something that they called ‘The Dreamer”.  The second was that I met Gracie.  And the third was that I was diagnosed with terminal cancer.”

I turned back and stared at him.  “How long ago was that?”

He chuckled.  “Just about twenty-four…no, twenty-five years ago.  I was thirty-nine at the time.”

I nodded slowly.  “So…what, you beat the cancer?  Because you don’t look sick and that’s a long time to…you know.”

He gave me a wan smile.  “Live with terminal cancer?  Yeah, I know.  And I did beat it after a fashion.  But that’s getting ahead of myself.”  Gripping the steering wheel harder, Holliman continued.  “When I found out about the cancer, I was coming off the best six months of my life.  I’d found a group that had claimed to have contact with the Dreamer—some kind of supernatural power they and I didn’t fully understand.  What I *did* understand is that they weren’t lying or crazy, at least not all of them.”

“How did you know?  That it wasn’t lies or bullshit?”

He paused a moment, licking his lips before he went on.  “I’m good at reading that stuff like I said, but this time it was more than that.”  He trailed off a moment before continuing.  “A friend of mine once told me a story when I asked something similar.”

**** 

Once upon a time there was a king that wanted to see God.  So he sent out his knights and pages to all corners of his kingdom to see if anyone could help him.  Now he was a respected king, but he was also rightfully feared, and out of all the land, only three men came forward to offer their aid.

The first was a big fat man who was quick to smile and easy to talk.  He strolled into the throne room, gave a deep bow, and then waited for the king to ask his question.

“Can you take me to see God?”

The fat man immediately began to nod and laugh.  Yes, he said, he’d be happy to take the king to see God.  There would be the matter of expenses for all the preparations, of course, but they should be able to make the journey in a year’s time.

The king listened to his response intently and then gestured to the guards.  The man was taken down to the courtyard and beheaded that very afternoon.

A week passed and then a thin, wretched man came shuffling into the castle saying he could help the king.  He was granted audience, and while the stranger kept looking in every direction and jumping at every shadow, the king got his attention long enough to make his inquiry.

“Can you take me to see God?”

Lips trembling, the man looked around at the silent guards and advisors in the throne room before nodding to the king.  He said that he could take the king to see God, but only if he didn’t bring all these laughing demons with him when they went.

The king listened to him sympathetically and then had him gently poisoned late that night.

Words of these deaths spread far and wide, and more than two months passed before another soul dared enter the castle with word of how God could be seen.  When they finally came, it was a young man who had been a soldier in the king’s last campaign.  Word was he had been a loyal and brave fighter until he lost half his arm and almost died to infection, and in the past two years he’d worked as a farmer in his family’s land amid the northern mountains.  Hearing all of this, the king dreaded what the boy might say and what action might be required, and so he asked more questions this time.

“Tell me, boy.  Do you come to me with tricks and lies?  Because I chopped the head off the last liar that came to this throne.”

The boy, still kneeling with his eyes down, shook his head.  “No, my king.  I do not lie, least of all to you.”

The king nodded.  “Very well.  Are you beset by some insanity that makes you see the world differently than it is?  Because I put to sleep the last pitiful lunatic that came to this throne.”

Shaking slightly now, the boy shook his head harder this time.  “I do not claim to be wise, but I am not a fool, and I have no doubt that I know the truth when I see it.”

Leaning forward, the king was surprised to find that he was actually getting excited now.  Could this finally be what he was looking for?  “I see, I see.  Then let me ask this.  Have you seen God?”

The boy was shaking harder now, but his voice was still strong.  “I have, my king.  Up in the mountains beyond my home.  I have seen God there.”

The king stood up from his throne, barely maintaining his composure as he asked his next question.  “And will you take me to see God?”

The boy looked up and met the king’s eyes now, his face filled with surprised horror.  “Oh, no, my king.  I will tell you where to go, but I will never take you there.”

So taken aback and disappointed at someone daring to tell him no, the king didn’t even get angry at the boy’s refusal.  Instead, he kneeled down in front of the boy, his normally gruff voice soft and beseeching now.  “Why, boy?  Why won’t you take me there yourself? ”

The boy never blinked, and only when the king lowered his own gaze did the young soldier answer him.

“Because I have been there.  I have seen God.  And I will not return to that place.”

The king frowned at him, his voice rougher again now and pregnant with threat.  “Are you not afraid of displeasing your king?”

The boy gave a short, hollow laugh.  “Meaning no disrespect, but I fear only one thing.  You don’t understand why that isn’t you, but…go on up that mountain.  You’ll understand soon enough.”

**** 

Holliman’s face looked paler when he glanced at me next.  “These people I’d met…they hadn’t been up the mountain, but they’d gotten close enough that their excitement had turned to an awed fear that was so deep it was instinctual.  It was unnerving, and before long I found that animal cowardice infecting me as well.”  He let out a dry laugh.  “But then I met a girl.  Gracie was better than me in every way—kinder, smarter, more courageous.  I felt like a fraud around her, like any moment she’d figure out how much less I was and run away.  When I realized she actually had similar interests to my own—a thirst for the extraordinary, she called it—I was ecstatic.  This was something where I had the advantage, where I could offer her something most could not.

“And that is why, with her, I sought out the Dreamer and faced what we found.  It wasn’t anything like what I expected, of course.  None of it was.  When we finally left its presence, we had been asked to serve.  Asked, not told, which seemed like an important distinction at the time, though now I’m not so sure.  Gracie was all for it from the start, but I was far less certain.  Part of it was my base cowardice raising its yellow head, but more than that was fear of losing her.  We didn’t understand what we’d be doing at that point—not really.  Just that an entity beyond our full comprehension was asking us to help it with important work that would help the world.

“But where she saw exciting purpose, I saw unknown danger and dread.  I didn’t want to risk losing her to it, though I also feared losing her if I didn’t go along with what she clearly wanted.  This lasted for nearly a month of me stalling for more time and trying to subtly warn her of my fears if we entered into some covenant with the Dreamer.  And then one day, I started seeing blood.

Holliman rubbed his face.  “I won’t bore you with all the details of the next few weeks of tests and worry.  Long story short, they said I had a few months left.  I was shattered.  Wanted to give up.  Tried to break up with Gracie because I knew losing me would only hurt worse if she was there for the end.  But…”  I saw a tear at the corner of his eye.  “Not my girl.  She told me to shut up.  That we were going to fix it.  That the Dreamer was going to fix it if it was so powerful and wanted our help.”

When he sat silent for several moments, I spoke up.  “It cured you?”

He nodded as he turned down a street.  I saw that we were in an industrial part of a town I didn’t recognize.  How much time had…but then he was speaking again.  “Oh yes.  Like the cancer was never there.  And the gratitude I felt?  Well, there wasn’t much I wouldn’t do at that point, and such a demonstration of its power also made me feel safer about us doing its…well, bidding sounds dramatic, but that doesn’t make it inapt.

“Not that we minded.  We *were* helping people, and we were part of something special, and we were doing it together.  And then when we had Nicholas…well, things were perfect for a time.”  He shook his head as he came to a hard stop.  “But enough of that.  We’re here.”

I blinked, looking at him and then out at the building we were in front of.  It said “Corbett Textiles” in a faded sign across the front, but there was no sign of light or life anywhere other than the dim streetlights crookedly leaning over the broken asphalt we’d drove up on.  I had so many questions I wanted to ask now.  Who was Nicholas?  Their kid?  And I didn’t get the sense they were still married or together or whatever, so what had happened between them?  But all of that had to wait.  I needed to get this question answered once and for all.  “This is where the Dreamer is?”

Holliman inclined his head slightly as he kept staring out the window.

“Are you going to take me in?”

He smiled slightly.  “Oh no.  I’m not going back in there.”

I frowned at him.  “Why not?”

His expression was cold and unreadable as he turned to look at me with his tight, thin smile.  “You’ll understand soon enough.”

**** 

He was right, though not in the way I first thought.  Coming back out of the building three hours later, my mind was such a jumble I could barely talk when I climbed back into the car.  It wasn’t until the next night, when I was trapped and terrified with Gracie, that I was able to put into words what had happened in there, and by then it was too late.

For the time being, I used what words I had to tell him we had to go back.  We had to go back and get Gracie now.  That something was after her and she wasn’t safe.

He didn’t question me, but just floored it back toward the hospital, calling ahead to tell the nurses that some crazy had called and made threats to harm her, and he expected security to be in her room around the clock until we returned, or they were all going to get sued until the lights went dark.  I couldn’t hear their responses, but he seemed slightly calmer when he finally hung up from talking to the third person in hospital administration.

The next two hours were some of the longest of my life.  It was a miracle that we didn’t get stopped for speeding several times over, but something seemed to be watching over us as we navigated the dark roads back to Gracie.  When we finally got there, we found that she was okay, at least for the moment.  An old security guard was sitting in a plastic chair outside her room and after some argument, the nurses agreed to let one of us stay in the room with her overnight.  Gordon told me to head on back down to the car and get some sleep—that he’d slept some while I was inside…well, when I was inside.  I thought he was lying, but I didn’t feel like it was my place to argue either.  So I told him to call me if he needed to swap out, and I went back outside to wait.

Getting into the car, I saw the gun laying discarded in the passenger floorboard.  I hadn’t even thought about it on the way back, and didn’t specifically remember when I set it down or let it go.  Not that it mattered anymore.  We were doing what we needed to do.  Coming back here and keeping her safe.  Getting her out of here as soon as…

I jumped as my phone buzzed and woke me up.  It was daylight, a little after nine by the dash clock, and Holliman was calling me.  Fumbling with the phone, I hit the accept button and started asking if everything was okay.  Holliman’s voice on the other side was tired-sounding but calm.

“Fine.  Everything is fine.  About to be wheeling her out if you’ll pull up front and help me get her into the car.  They gave her a sedative for pain and she’s a bit out of it.”

“Sure, sure.  Heading over there now.”

Fifteen minutes later they were wheeling her out, and Gordon hadn’t been lying.  Her head was lolling to the side as the nurse pushed her out to the curb.  She saw my concerned look and gave me a smile.  “Poor thing.  It hit her a bit harder than we expected, but she should be awake in an hour or two.  And she’s already checked out and ready to go.  Your father has all the prescriptions and instructions for her wounds.”

I went to correct her but then decided against it.  What difference did it make?  Instead I helped pick up Gracie and ease her over into the passenger seat while Gordon went around to the driver’s side.  It was as he was going around the front of the car that Gracie suddenly grabbed me around the neck with surprising strength, whispering to me before her grip loosened and then fell away.  I tried to keep my face neutral as I buckled her in and pondered the word.

*”Kerioth.”*

I’d heard that word before recently, but I couldn’t remember where.  And I had no idea why it was so important to Gracie that she’d made a point of whispering it to me through the fog of her sedation.  Looking up, I saw Gordon staring at me.

“Did she say something to you?”

I shook my head as I backed out of the car.  “No, just mumbling.  I think she’s dreaming.”

A pause and then.  “Okay.  Get in and we’ll go.”

Reaching for the back door, I felt my phone buzz.  The name said “Wallace Minter”.  I felt a stab of worry and guilt.  I’d told him to call if he ever needed anything, and I’d meant to check on him more frequently, but it had been months since we last talked.  Still, last time I’d heard from him he was doing…well, not great, but okay.  I’d have to call him back, but now wasn’t the time.  There was too much going on.

Refusing the call, I got into the back seat and looked up front to where Gordon was staring at me in the mirror.  “Ready?”

I nodded.  “Yeah, but are we driving all the way back right now?  Is she okay for that long?”

He shook his head.  “No, I wouldn’t want to risk it.  She needs to lie down.  But we actually have a place less than an hour away.  Haven’t been there in a good while, but it should be just what we need.”

I stared at him.  “Really?  I never knew you had another place this close to Braxton.”

Holliman shrugged.  “We’re three hours from Braxton, and it’s just never been relevant until now.  If you’re done with the questions, I’d like to focus on driving.  I’m quite tired and don’t want to make a mistake.”

Frowning, I shrugged.  “Yeah, fine.  Let me know if you want me to drive.”  Sinking back into the seat, I stared out the window.  There was a part of me that still wanted to argue or question everything more—not that it wasn’t possible for them to have multiple properties, but it all just seemed so strange and coincidental.  On the other hand, my brain was fried, and between trying to wrap my head around what I’d seen the night before and everything else, I didn’t really have the energy to fight anymore.  Instead I sank into a stupor as we passed through a couple of small towns and then a third, finally coming to a stop on the eastern edge of a place that I’d never been before but still seemed strangely familiar.

The neighborhood had seen better days, but Gordon had pulled up in the driveway of the one place on the street that looked clean and in good repair.  A two-story house with a well-kept yard and fresh paint, I felt a small tickle in the back of my head as we got out and Holliman began searching the yard like he’d lost something there.  Didn’t he say they hadn’t been there in a long time?  Still, they could be paying someone to keep the place up, right?  And…what the fuck was he doing?

Gordon suddenly stood up, holding a rock that, upon him turning it over, was actually a hide-a-key.  Giving me a small, strange smile, he popped the key free and went up to open the door before coming back to help me carry Gracie inside.  She was limp but snoring, and while she didn’t seem in distress, I still shot him a worried look as we started up on the porch.

“Should she be sleeping this heavy?”

He puffed out a breath of exertion as he climbed the steps.  “She’s always been sensitive to sedatives.  She should be fine in an hour or two.  Just need to get her inside and comfortable.”

“Okay.”  I was going to say more, but something caught my eye as we were crossing the threshold into the house.  A little sign hung outside the door, carved and painted in the shape of a small dock with a fisherman on the end casting his line into some unknown sea.  Underneath the dock was a wood placard that said “Willie’s Place”.

I stopped dead for a moment.  Who the fuck was Willie?

Holliman frowned at me.  “Don’t drop her.  What’re you doing?”

I shook my head and started forward again.  A few minutes later and we had her settled in what I thought was the downstairs living room, but it was hard to say.  There was furniture throughout the house, but it was odd and mismatched, like someone had taken things from a dozen houses instead of one.

“Can you stay with her?”

I looked away from the weird old t.v. I’d been staring at and looked at him.  “Yeah, sure.  Are you leaving?”

He nodded.  “Just for a bit.”  He pulled some papers from his pocket and waved them.  “Got to go get her medicines filled.  I’ll pick us up some food too.”

“Okay.  Yeah, sure.  I’ll keep an eye on her.”

He started to leave and then paused a second.  “I…thank you, Clint.  I really do mean that.  For everything.  I just wish…Just, if she wakes up, tell her that she’s home and safe.  And that everything will be okay.  Can you do that for me?”

“Um…yeah, sure.  I’ll tell her.”

**** 

I sat on the floor next to the sofa for the next half hour.  God, even then I hated that place.  It was boring and I had no phone service in there, but the worst part was how creepy everything was.  Even now, after everything else, I still dream that I’m back in that place.  The peeling wallpaper, the lonely, almost angry buzz that was in the air and the light of every room.  A sense of sadness and wrongness that made my skin tingle and was made so much worse by the furniture and other items scattered across the rooms with some chaotic sense of insanity or something worse.

Weird shit, like the old-timey television.  Looking closer, you could see ripples in the screen’s glass like someone had run their fingers through thick icing.  The sofa Gracie was on, it smelled…it smelled like skin.  It looked like fabric, but it fucking smelled like a woman’s skin.

And then there was the rocking horse.

I don’t know why it stood out to me the most, but sitting across the room near the entrance to the hallway was an old wooden rocking horse with peeling paint and a faded head of molded plastic that once had looked like a charging black stallion.  The saddle was the oddest part—while the rest of it looked weathered, the leather sadle was polished and pristine, and I could even read the gold lettering above the stirrup.

[*Nick’s Best Steed*](https://redd.it/qt83xw)

Who the fuck was…

“Oh God.  Oh no.”

I jumped at Gracie’s voice behind and above me, and when I looked back, I saw she was sitting up, looking around in horror.  Turning around, I put my hand on her arm.

“Um, Gracie…um, Mrs. Graves.  It’s okay.  Mr. Holliman is going to be back soon and you’re okay.”

“No, no, no, no!”  She looked terrified, eyes shining wetly as she looked to me and the room and back over and over again.

“He…he says we’re safe.  He wanted me to tell you that you’re home.”

She squeezed her eyes shut as she lowered her head.  And when she spoke this time, it was a brief, broken whisper.
