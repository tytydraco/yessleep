Today, I’m moving into a student residence. For the first time, I’m leaving my family home. The thought fills me with both excitement and a touch of nervousness. My boyfriend came along to help me unpack. 

The apartment, located on the second floor, is small but functional. It offers me a first taste of independence. As we carry boxes, a strange smell catches our attention, seemingly drifting from the stairwell. We exchange a glance but choose to ignore it, opting instead to take the elevator.

As the days pass, something keeps me from settling into this new space. Despite my boyfriend’s reassuring presence, the apartment remains oddly cold, impersonal. Nights are especially unsettling. Strange noises echo from the floor above—a low rumble, sometimes the creak of wood. We dismiss it, attributing it to the old building’s quirks.

Then one night, while we’re comfortably settled on the couch watching my boyfriend’s favorite movie, Forrest Gump, my phone vibrates. A message appears on the screen from an unknown number:

**Leave apartment 74.**

I frown. I live in apartment 47. Assuming it’s just a mistake, I decide to ignore the message and keep it from my boyfriend.

But as the night wears on, the noises from above grow more persistent, almost invasive. There’s banging against the walls, the scraping of furniture being dragged across the floor. Each sound draws nearer, becoming more intense, until it’s almost unbearable. Finally, on edge, I suggest we go check it out. My boyfriend nods, equally disturbed by the relentless noise.

When we step out, we find that the elevator we used earlier is now out of order. A sense of unease washes over me. We have no choice but to take the stairs. The strange odor we noticed during the move still lingers, now stronger and more nauseating.

As we ascend, the noises abruptly stop, leaving us in an oppressive silence. We pass a few older residents who seem curious about our presence. When I ask if these sounds are common, they shake their heads, puzzled. They vaguely mention that previous tenants had also complained about noises from apartment 74. My stomach tightens. The memory of the anonymous message resurfaces, sending a cold shiver down my spine. My boyfriend, sensing my discomfort, suggests we go back.

Once inside our apartment, I give in and show him the message. He reads it, his brow furrowed, but before he can respond, my phone vibrates again. Another notification:

**I’m watching you.**

My breath catches. Who could be sending these messages? A bad prank, maybe? My boyfriend tries to calm me, but I can see the uncertainty in his eyes. He suggests we go to apartment 74 in the morning to clear things up.

We attempt to resume the movie, but the noises return, more aggressive this time, as if something is desperately trying to break through the ceiling. My anxiety spikes, my body tense with fear. My boyfriend pulls me close, promising to check on the noise. I refuse to let him go alone. Hand in hand, we head for the stairs leading to the floor above.

The smell now is nearly unbearable, a rancid, damp stench that seems to seep from the walls themselves. Each step brings us closer to something undefined, something we dread to discover. Halfway up, my phone vibrates again:

**Go back down.**

The message is simple, yet it chills me to the core. I stop, my heart pounding in my chest. We exchange a look, unsure. My boyfriend tries to reassure me, but I can see the worry etched on his face. We move forward regardless, each step echoing in the heavy silence of the building.

When we reach the door of apartment 74, we notice it’s slightly ajar. A faint, flickering light escapes from inside, casting strange shadows on the hallway floor. My boyfriend raises his hand to knock, but I instinctively hold him back. My heart races, and I suggest we wait, think it through. He shakes his head, determined to go in.

The door creaks as it opens, the sound piercing the silence of the floor. Inside, the room is dimly lit, with the curtains drawn tight, blocking out nearly all light from outside. Only a computer screen glows faintly, casting an eerie light over the room. The place is in disarray, as if someone had ransacked it.

We cautiously step inside, the heavy atmosphere pressing down on us. My boyfriend approaches the computer, drawn by the screen’s glow. “There’s a video playing,” he says, his voice tense. I move closer, feeling panic rise within me. On the screen, a black-and-white video shows our apartment. The camera is pointed directly at our living room, capturing our every movement.

For a moment, my heart stops. The scene is surreal, beyond comprehension. My boyfriend begins to speak, but his words fade as another message appears on my phone:

**You shouldn’t have come here.**

The apartment door slams shut behind us with a loud bang, shattering the oppressive silence. We rush to the door, but it’s locked. The handle refuses to turn, as if an invisible force is keeping us inside.

Suddenly, slow, heavy footsteps echo in the hallway, drawing closer. Each step sounds nearer, more menacing. My boyfriend signals for me to find another way out. We frantically search the apartment, but the windows are sealed tight, and no other exit is visible.

Then, a loud thud comes from the kitchen. We turn simultaneously toward the sound. On the counter, an unfamiliar cell phone vibrates, displaying one final message:

**Look behind you.**

The light suddenly goes out, plunging the apartment into total darkness. And in that blackness, a barely audible whisper reaches our ears:

**“You won’t leave here.”**
