The digging of a grave is not the dark and sinister affair you would probably imagine it to be. Rather it is an act of respect for the dead. I've been the sole gravedigger at Slaughter-Neck for 14 years now. And recently the grounds have been a far more terrifying place than ever before.

&#x200B;

Beginning of August, 2022, I made a heart stopping discovery, and I haven't told a soul. I don't know who to trust and I am afraid of what could happen if I say something to the wrong person. See only a handful of people know the overall day to day operations around here well enough to find the time to do the things that I have come to be aware of.

&#x200B;

The first discovery was the worst overall. I guarantee I was pale as a ghost for a whole day after the find. I had finished digging a grave on the far west end of the cemetery that day and the work stretched into the wee hours of the night. I finished off the site just after midnight that night. I remember the night fog had just begun to creep into the cemetery as I was packing it up for the night. 

&#x200B;

I made my way back to groundskeeper's shed near the main buildings to stow away the Bobcat and the rest of my gear. Afterwards I spent the remainder of the night listening to late night radio on my small portable for background sound. And then I dove into my guilty pleasures. Sucking on the soft caramels I've loved so much since I was a little kid and keep in a drawer at the desk here. And reading horror novels on my downtime.

&#x200B;

About an hour before dawn broke I made my last walk through of the grounds that night, or morning I guess I should say. And as I rounded the West side of the cemetery on my way back around to where I  had begun my walkthrough, I noticed the grave cap had been moved on the grave I had finished earlier in the night. Basically just a large piece of half inch thick plywood that keeps critters and trash from falling in before the grave can be put to use. 

&#x200B;

Not a first but definitely not the norm either. I made my way over and noticed in the muddy area around the grave opening were fresh looking footprints. Not boot prints or shoe prints, but bare feet prints, and from the looks of them, from a sizeable man. The corner of the grave had been left exposed and I nearly just slid it back and walked away regardless of the strange prints. But the thought of a homeless man wondering through and falling in gave me pause, so I decided to check first. 

&#x200B;

At first glance and first pass of my flashlight, I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. But a brief flash of color caught my eye and made me look a little harder at the bottom of the grave. There was obviously at second look a piece of material of some sorts sticking up from the loose soil at the bottom. And I knew for certain it was not there when I finished out the hole to begin with. So I made my way to the storage shed and retrieved a ladder and made my way back over to the gravesite.

&#x200B;

I slid the ladder down into the grave and began my descent into the dark hole in the ground. As my feet came down off the ladder, I reached for my light and turned round to survey the grave floor. My light found nothing except for the 3 by 3 inch piece of material I had seen from above. It stuck up from the loose soil like the tag on the edge of a mattress. It was brown and checked like old burlap sack cloth. I kicked at it first to see if it was just a bit of loose material that had fallen in the grave due to the plywood being off a bit from covering the grave completely. But it stayed put, buried firmly in the soil there.

&#x200B;

I leaned down naturally as I would picking up any other bit of trash in the cemetery and gave it a firm tug. I came up with a little effort, a rolled up hunk of burlap as I had suspected. Obviously there was something rolled up within the material but what I could not tell. I kicked at it a bit and drug my boot across it to help unroll it from itself. And to my absolute horror a series of small bleach white bones shown in the light of my flashlight. Only a few very small bone fragments fell out at first, but the shock of it spurred me to lift up on the corner of the material spilling out its contents. The true horror came with the small round object that rolled free from the material and stopped along the side of the grave. A skull, small and bleach white like the rest of the bones. 

&#x200B;

It was terrifyingly obvious it was the skull of an infant or small child. It's small hollow sockets stared up at me from the grave floor. I went up that ladder so fast I ripped both of my shins open on the ladder rungs but it didn't slow my ascent one bit. I ran back to the main building and into the groundskeeper's office and picked up the phone. Obviously some crazy person had disposed of their dead baby in an open grave in our cemetery and I needed to report the situation to my boss and the authorities. But I had to set the receiver back down to calm myself enough to think, I didn't know the numbers by heart, I hadn't ran into an issue before that required a call to anyone.

&#x200B;

I started thumbing through the desk looking for the notebook that had the numbers I needed in it. And in the time it took to locate it and slap it down on the desk, I had a chance to think back over the events that had just unfolded. I had left the ladder, my flashlight, and the situation so abruptly I had overlooked a couple facts of the matter. The burlap material I had pulled free was part of a larger mass of material buried shallowly at the bottom of the grave. I only freed the bottom portion of it when I had pulled it up from the dirt beneath my feet.

&#x200B;

I needed to go back, as badly as I had been shaken, and as horrible as it had been, I needed to fully assess the situation at the bottom of that grave. I don't know what told me so, I just knew it to be true. There was more to what I had stumbled upon and I wasn't going to make those calls until I knew what it was. Until I knew what the hell was going on here. I made my way back across the cemetery, I moved slowly, almost deafened by the blood rushing past my eardrums, my heart rate was dangerously erratic. 

&#x200B;

When I made it back to the hole I picked up the flashlight from near the edge of the grave that I dropped as I ran off the first time. From my experiences as a gravedigger in the past I know full well that bones won't bite. My fear was born in the back of my mind at the thought of the person responsible for this being somewhere nearby. I definitely did not want to bump into the person responsible in the fog of the night after what I had just discovered. They were obviously mentally unhinged or worse.

&#x200B;

Long story short, their were two bodies at the bottom of that grave that night. An adult skeleton and the baby skeleton. I made the call to my boss and he instructed me to stay put in the office and he would be right over. Now my boss I know lives roughly 40 minutes drive from the cemetery. And I swear he was there in 15. It didn't ring suspicious at first, I just assumed he had rushed over due to the situation at hand. But what happened next made me seriously worry about my own situation. 

&#x200B;

After arriving he told me he had contacted authorities and that it was okay for me to go ahead and check out for the night. My shift was pretty much over anyways so I wasn't going to argue. I wanted far from that situation anyway. But the next day I had expected to see something in the newspaper about the find at the cemetery. Or even on the news or radio stations about the happenings. But no matter how hard I looked for information on it there was absolutely nothing to find. And when I came in the next night the grave was now someone's permanent resting place. The cemetery had placed the casket and headstone and filled it in already. 

&#x200B;

When I asked my boss about what had happened he gave me a bullshit story about the cops and a detective showing up and all kinds of details about what had taken place. But I know that never happened because after he told me I called my sister in-law and asked her to have her father ask around about anything he may be able to find out about an incident at the cemetery. I gave her no other information just that. Her father is a retired robbery/homicide detective in Delaware, and he still has friends in the force I know. She said nobody knows about anything happening at the cemetery as far as he can find anyway. Then she tried to press me for more info on my end and I just said never mind and tell my brother I said hi and ended the call.

&#x200B;

So I have been diligently looking for the old caretaker/gravedigger that was here before I took over. He actually trained me as his replacement years ago. He was advanced in age even then but with any luck he might still be alive and he would almost certainly talk to me about the issues at the cemetery. I actually found his address, but when I went over there his wife answered the door and when I mentioned having some questions about work at the cemetery, she literally slammed the door and cut me off without so much as a word.

&#x200B;

I'm not sure where to go next with this situation, but I am worried about my safety to a degree. And I am certain my boss has something to do with this. How many bodies are buried just under someone else' coffin? How long has this been going on? If anyone has any suggestions for me about what my next moves should be, please let me know..
