the inevitable , I got weak. The fight between my morals and my sanity raged for four years and I broke. I just need you to understand that I didn’t want to do it. I was driving home from where I would hunt in the mornings. When I saw her, she was around my age. She had blonde hair and green eyes, kind of thin but healthy. Seems she was trying to get a ride somewhere so I obliged. She got in my truck thanking me for the favor. 

“Thanks for the pick up, big guy is way more humid than I thought it'd be today” she said with such a sweet smile. 

I responded with a nervous chuckle and said “no problem i could tell you needed a hand”
She dropped the visor mirror to fix her hair “my mom always said that hitch hiking was dangerous cause there's a bunch of killers out there, that's not you mister is it” she said in a sarcastic tone as she bit her tongue at me
“What? No no, well i mean i hunt but that's about the only killing i've ever done” i choked out
	“Well good cause i don't look good enough today to die like this” she said with a snarky chuckle

We drove for about 20 minutes before I started to hear the bells. “God not them again i can never catch a break” i said with an annoyed sigh
"What're you talkin' 'bout?" She craned her neck to peer out of the rear windshield. Did she think we were being followed?

"The bells. The bells are starting to ring." I assumed it was obvious what I was talking about. It was too embarrassing to add that the bells rang because my shot earlier that day had missed, and my hunt had failed.

She started to move closer to the door and sheepishly mumbled “oh, no ive never really heard something like that before.” she had that same sweet smile it's almost like she meant it before she followed up with. “You can drop me off at this stop sign at the end of the road. I can walk from here. My mom doesn't like me riding with strangers and I don't wanna get in trouble.” 
I sat in silence only giving a nod to her as the bells started tolling louder and louder, my ears started ringing I had to do something…. no , I needed to do something.

 I grabbed her. I couldn't take it anymore. Every thought about stopping or letting her go was drowned in an orchestra of metal banging metal. I wrapped my hand around her throat, she was thin so I enveloped her whole throat, and I squeezed and squeezed. I felt the muscles in her throat fighting against my hand for breath. I watched her eyes plead and beg for me to stop but the bells they hungered for suffering and I was done giving it my own. I watched her eyes glaze over and she stopped fighting. I didn’t stop choking her till I knew for certain she was gone. The bells clanged once more with laughter on the melody. I stripped her and burned her things in the woods and dumped her body in a nearby hog den.

It started when I was 13. I would hear bells in the distance most days, I figured that it was some kinda church that would ring its bells at noon. Since I grew up in the southern parts of the United States that was far from out of the norm or so I thought. When I was around 16 was the first time I saw him or I'm not sure really at this point. I was at the park with some friends. We were fishing in the local pond when I heard the bells again but they were very close within the park. I tried to ignore them like I had in the past but the droning was deafening. 

I could feel it in every part of my body, it was  like someone threw me in a washing machine and hit an ultra spin cycle. I made up a reason that I had to get home to my friends, something about having to help with dinner. On my walk home the bells followed me. I couldn't escape them. I tore off through the nearby woods from the road, I ran for idk how long I was in deep swampy marsh land before I collapsed to my knees. The bells were assaulting every part of my body, my insides felt like I was being chewed up by some monumental force, my bones were grinding against themselves trying to escape the tolls with no luck. 

Then there was silence; the marsh was quiet. I looked up to see a figure walking through the water, the steps made no sound which made no sense. This figure was large, almost tall enough to touch the power lines that run along the roads. Its body was disproportionate, its arms were long hanging to its knees, its torso was gaunt and long but the part that made me start freaking out the most was its head. it was a huge church bell I don’t even know how its body could support it the weight would seemingly crush its frail body. Its silent approach through the land was interrupted by the snaps and crack of its bones; it seemed with each step its legs and spine were straining against its wrought iron weight. 

I did the only thing I could think of at the moment, I prayed. “Lord, I come to you” I whispered to myself as the bells started tolling once more. “my refuge, for protection from evil.” I was speaking normally now trying to drown out the bells. 
“Surround me with your love and shield me from harm” I was screaming to myself as I felt my ears ringing and my body turning to jelly. “both physical and spiritual. In your name, Jesus, I trust." Silently, I opened my clenched eyes to see nothing. There were no marks in the mud, no evidence of that thing being there, then from a distance the bells continued.

From that point on there was no reprieve from the  insolence ringing, nothing could deafen the screams of metal. Until I was driving home from school and hit the neighbors dog who got out of the house.I tried to stop but the bells were hitting harder than normal and then quiet, the moment my truck made contact with that poor dog I was in blissful silence. After the shock of it I saw it again standing in front of my truck. It spoke to me or it made me understand it. The bell started ringing and in the ringing of my ears I heard “the price for peace is life.” The voice was raspy and melodic; it was inviting but dangerous. I had no idea what to do and as the bells rang louder my vision blurred and it was gone.

Over the next few weeks I picked up hunting. It was a fairly normal pastime around my town. When I started to hear the bells in the distance I’d go out to kill a squirrel or hog, maybe a deer and I’d have peace for another few weeks. The time between needed kills was getting shorter. It seemed that the larger the animal the longer time I had ,but it was to a point now where a good sized buck would only get me 1 or 2 weeks and then only a week. That was when I’d turned 20 and I want you to understand I tried. I really did, I did everything in my power to avoid the inevitable ,but I got weak.

I found the most peace I’ve had 2 whole months of silence before I heard them again in the distance. I saw a new person get off at the bus stop today. It seems like they are tourists so hopefully no one will notice when they’re gone.
