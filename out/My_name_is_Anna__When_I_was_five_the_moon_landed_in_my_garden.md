My name is Anna. When I was five, the moon landed in my garden.

One minute I was staring out my bedroom window, watching it descend, and the next, I stood shivering, barefoot on the damp grass, in my *Care Bears* pyjamas, clutching my stuffed fox, staring up in wonderment at a silver disc glowing like mother-of-pearl. It wasn’t the moon, of course not – how could it be?  But five-year-old me?  I didn’t know what else to call it.  It made perfect sense to me that the moon simply dropped in to singe the snowdrops.

Hovering silently above the washing line, the disc cast light which shimmered across the daffodils and made the air itself electric, muting familiar sounds.  No barking dogs.  No soft “swish” of passing traffic.  No hooting from the owl nestled in the eaves.  My ears felt oddly blocked.

*They* came.

The *Greys*.  Back then, I didn’t know they had a name. I do now.  

They glid across the lawn like ghosts, silent and scentless.  One leaned in close, two, enormous, black, oval eyes, reflecting like finely polished obsidian, skin grey like a riverbed rock smoothed by decades of currents, and an inverted teardrop-shaped head obscenely large and long for its reedy body.

The Grey extended an arm, elongated, paper-skinned fingers enveloping my small, stubby fingers and palm.  It didn’t speak, but a voice, female in tone, resonated in my skull: “*Don’t be afraid, Anna*.”  

I was terrified.

Their ship smelled like disinfectant and ozone. The floor was cool, soft, almost pliable beneath my bare feet.  The walls pulsed gently, as if breathing. My stomach suddenly lurched -my dinner threatened to make a reappearance.  To distract me, one of the taller Greys shepherded me to a curved window, and my breath caught.

Space, an eternal tapestry of black, stitched with silver stars and the whisper of forgotten light. Far beneath, Earth drifted - a swirl of cerulean blue and meadow green, cradled in the ink-stained hands of the cosmos.

The small craft merged seamlessly with a second vessel. No *clunk*. No metallic screeching.  It loomed, silent and immense, surface illuminated by veins of white light. Inside, they led me, unseeing, through blinding corridors of colourless light to a room filled with children.

“This is our *nursery*,” the female Grey informed me.

My temporary blindness evaporated.  I studied the children.  

They weren’t quite *children*.

They were pale, fragile, limbs abnormally thin, heads unreasonably oversized. Wispy, white-blonde hair fell into enormous, celestite-blue eyes. When they blinked, their irises and pupils dilated unnaturally – like morning ice thawing upon a lake.

One girl was beckoned forward. She was older than I – perhaps seven or eight.  Her presence pulled at me, like a memory I hadn’t yet formed.  I questioningly peered up at my escort.

“This is your sister.”

I blinked. “What’s her name?”

“She is designated *731*.”

“Seven-three-one? That’s a number, not a name!”  Despite my fear, I giggled, nervously.

“That is how you will understand it.  You would not comprehend her true name.”

“Why doesn’t she live with me?  Is she sick?”

“No.  Earth cannot sustain her life.  She is not the same as you.”

I reached out to the girl. She didn’t flinch, as though she’d anticipated my movement.

“Why are they all so quiet?”  I asked. “Don’t they know how to play?”

“You are here to teach them to play,” the Grey continued. “They do not know how.”

I spent hours showing them how to chase, to laugh, to jump, fall, and pretend. They were curious, cautious, continually observing. Sporadically, they copied me in perfect unison. It was akin to performing in front of mirrors made of moonlight.  I ate with them – a strange concoction I can only describe as “green jelly and rice pudding” – odourless, and tasteless, yet satiating.  They slurped through a large straw because their mouths couldn’t open wide enough.  Reluctant to be the exception, I used the straw provided, instead of tipping the beaker up and drinking.

The female Grey returned, escorting me away.  I cried for my sister and kicked out refusing to board the transport craft.  Darkness ended my resistance.

I woke lying on the floor beside my bedroom window.  I scrambled to my feet, and ran to my parents’ bedroom, babbling excitedly about meeting my “big sister”.
  
Instantly, my mother was awake, shaking my father.  “Call Tom, *now*!” she ordered him. 

I thought it had all been a dream. Mum said I’d watched too much television. “Too much of *The X Files*,” she scolded in her angry brogue.  “I bloody told your dad no’ tae let ye watch them!  It’s no’ right for a wee lassie!”  

The dreams never ceased.  Consistently, the light returned.  I’d interact with new, aberrant youngsters, but never saw my sister amongst them.

As I reached eighteen, the visitations increased. Quarterly, like clockwork - invariably aligning with my cycle. I’d drift comfortably into sleep, cocooned in my duvet, then rouse, aching, disoriented, and marked. Frequently bruised. Occasionally, there would be three small dots forming a triangle below my ribs.

Other times, I remembered more than I desired.

Less than twenty-four hours after one particularly gruelling event, I came to in a room that stank of antiseptic and sweat.  Strapped to a hospital bed, IV lines taped to my arms as a masked figure leaned over me, shining a penlight into my pupils. 

He wasn’t a Grey.

He was *human*.

“*You were taken. You were returned.*”

“*What did they show you?*”

“*What did they tell you?*”

They never asked where I’d been, when it happened, nor why.  They *told* me.  Repeating the same questions as one would a mantra, whilst they pumped a cold, vile tasting substance into my veins.  I didn’t answer.  I *couldn’t*.  My mind replete with pebbles that cleaved my tongue to the roof of my mouth.  Still, they continued.  Men and women in lab coats, personnel wearing indigo uniforms flitting in and out of focus.  More questions, more observations. 

Then came the beach.

I fell asleep on our worn sofa, television muttering in the background. I returned to consciousness, lying on my side on the shingle at Rhu Point, cold, barefoot, icy sea spray biting my face and clothing.  Something felt amiss.

A ship hung low over the water - sleek, silent, silver. Beneath it, a small Grey glided toward me, clutching a luminous rod which reminded me of a disco glowstick. Vainly, I attempted to scramble away, but my legs refused to obey.

The Grey reached out. The wand touched my left temple.

My breath left me. I fell backwards.

I started awake, naked and shivering beneath harsh light.  Paralysed, invisible restraints secured me to a freezing, metallic table. 

The *Tall Doctor* approached – a commanding Grey, who’d been there since my childhood.  Towering, severe, and far angular than the others. His eyes, deeper than before, sliced through me.  He’d never had compassion.

“No…” I begged. “Please… not again.”

He didn’t acknowledge my pleas, slightly stepped aside, and deftly continued his work.

*731* entered.

She wasn’t the peculiar, diminutive girl from our first meeting.  She was grown - taller than I, ethereal in a skintight, pale green uniform. Her hair still floated like silk, her eyes the same penetrating blue.  She moved, sylphlike - a dancer in slow motion.

Piercing, white hot pain screamed through my navel, and several more points on my abdomen.

“Help me,” I sobbed. “Please, make it stop. Please!”

“I was created to assist the *Tall Doctor*,” she advised, softly.

She slid closer. “I can ease your distress.”

Her forehead delicately pressed against mine.

My mind shattered.

Thoughts, fears, memories—everything—rippled outward like pages in a book rifled through by a wind only she controlled. My body tensed, resisting the intrusion, but she held steady.

The agony abated.

My limbs sagged. My breathing slowed. Her eyes filled my vision.

“*I’m sorry*,” she whispered deep inside my brain.

Oblivion.

I awoke in bed. 

More bruising – three large, triangular indentations. Stinging tenderness. Confirmation I had never been dreaming.  I had simply refused to believe.

Doctor Christine McFadyen reassured me I wasn’t crazy. She spoke with a soft smile and quiet, coaxing tones often employed by psychiatrists.

Our sessions were fraught with my anguish.  

“I just want a diagnosis,” I finally admitted. “Something I can *name*. Maybe a medication to make me *normal*.”
She simply nodded and scribbled her notes. She always took such detailed notes.

I never saw what she wrote.

Last week, the sedation failed. 

The uniformed men arrived as always - dark clothing, seamless entry and extraction, hands that worked with practiced precision. I felt the needle slide into my arm. My vision blurred. The stretcher beneath me moulding to my spine.

Something slipped. The dose wasn’t right.

I heard voices, garbled, and muted as though underwater.  Snatches of streetlamps through a van window. Flashes of overhead lights as I was wheeled through a beige corridor, and into the stench of perspiration and antiseptic.

The fog slowly began to lift.  Faded clarity returning.

“…Subject *M3* is activated…”

A man’s voice. Familiar. Deep.

“Dad?” I croaked, my tongue thick, struggling to form words. “Dad… help… me…”

Panicked movement, a flash of silver hair. A hand pressed an oxygen mask to my face. I caught a glimpse of a symbol on their shirt cuff - a crescent moon within a square.

I welcomed the void.

The following day, I arose late - tongue like sandpaper, heart thumping against my sternum. 

I remembered.

That *voice*.  

My *father’s* voice.

I tore through the attic searching for answers. Something – *anything* within my childhood journals, scribbled drawings, old dolls. Beneath a crate marked “SCHOOL” I discovered more than I’d bargained for.

A padded, manila folder, thick and heavy. Embossed with a crescent moon within a square.

Inside: files. Hundreds of pages.  

Stamps: ***TOP SECRET: LUNAR.*** 

Personnel records. Medical assessments. 

Interrogation transcripts.

My name. My *designation*. 

*Subject: M3*

Authorised by: *John McVey. Lena McVey.*

I couldn’t breathe. 

They *knew*.

They’d *always* known.

Dad wasn’t merely a security consultant at Faslane Naval Base - he was Second-in-Command of a covert unit codenamed *LUNAR*: Logistical Undercover Nocturnal Abductee Reconnaissance. 

Mum worked and colluded with them, too.

Multiple reports on *me*. Timelines.  Abduction logs. A list of every job application I’d ever submitted - and the notes ensuring employers rejected me.

They never intended to let me leave.

My inheritance from my dead grandparents? *LUNAR* money.

The only positive?  Active encouragement to earn my driving license as quickly as possible.  No wonder my parents pushed me so hard to learn when I was seventeen.  It was all pre-planned.  Collated.  Controlled.

One paragraph chilled my core: “*Subject M3 exhibits stable hybridisation. Unlike prototype 731, M3 can adapt to both terrestrial and extra-terrestrial environments. Viable for continued ovum harvesting.  Potential host. Recommend monthly observation aligned with reproductive cycle.*”

The final page: Mum’s signature. Dad’s.

I ran downstairs and waited.

When Dad walked through the door, I shook, seething, and blocked his way in the narrow hallway, a claustrophobic urgency radiating from within.

“Anna?” he looked at me, quizzically.

“Oh, is that my name?” My voice was flat, lifeless. “I thought I was *Subject M3*.”  My eyes flashed at him.  “It was *you*.”

He froze.

“I remember…*Dad*.”  I spat the word “Dad”.

He reached for me. “You weren’t supposed to…”

I batted his arm away.  “*You* did this to me.”

“I was trying to protect you.”

“Protect me?  HOW?  By drugging me? Restraining me? Lying to me every day of my life? Am I really your daughter? Or am I simply a fucking cell in a spreadsheet?”

His mouth opened.  I abruptly cut him off.

“What else have you and Mum agreed to on my behalf?  What else aren’t you telling me?  What else are they doing to my body?”

I turned away. Withholding a sob.

“Who *are* you, Dad?”

Mum broke the moment she saw the file on the kitchen table. Openly weeping as I demanded answers.

“They stole her from me,” she whispered.

“*731*?” I confirmed.

“That’s not her name!  We chose *Lily*.  I was 26 weeks gone. I thought I miscarried.  *They took her*.  They left me *empty*.”

“Why allow them to do it again? Why let them take me?”

“I didn’t know they *would*! And they *didn’t*, not until you were five,” she sobbed. “Tom - Commander Larson assured us we’d be safe if I worked with *LUNAR*.  If I shared intelligence about my own abductions - we could stay together. They *promised*…I…I believed we had no other option.”

She collapsed into the chair, clutching a tepid mug of tea to her chest.  “It didn’t matter. They took you anyway. I failed ye, hen. I’m so sorry.”

I wanted to scream. 

I sought Christine’s counsel, my heart cracking like fallen porcelain on granite.

She listened, suggesting she guide me through hypnosis.

I remembered *everything*.

The table.  The unseen restraints. The regular harvesting of my eggs. *731*’s calm detachment. The pain.  How the *Tall Doctor*’s voice echoed like it came from inside my bones.

“*The Contract formed when you were but a Starseed within the dust of nebulae. The Pact will end when your soul returns to the dust of galaxies.*”

When I came out of the trance-like state, I screamed, voiceless, with tears of rage, frustration, and betrayal.  

Christine cancelled her afternoon appointments to extend our session.  She handed me a tart, flavoured water to drink.

“Electrolytes,” she told me.

I downed the small bottle in three, long gulps, and soon calmed enough to discuss what I’d experienced.
 
Several hours later, as I stood to leave, something caught my eye.

Christine’s coat. Indigo, expensive, neatly hung. The left cuff adorned with a small, embroidered patch.

A crescent moon within a square.

*LUNAR* insignia.

I turned, ice in my veins. “You’re *one of them*?”

She didn’t deny it.  “I gather data in many ways,” she said, coolly. Not her usual warm, welcoming tone.

“You lied to me! All this time?”

“I supported you.”

“You *sedated* me!”

“I helped you remember.” 

I couldn’t fight the Greys. 

I couldn’t stop *LUNAR*. 

I *could* make them look me in the eye.

Resolute, I demanded my dad convene a meeting between me and the Commanding Officer - Thomas Larson.

Larson arrived with the typical military precision I’d watched in my father every day of my life. Square shoulders. Square jaw. Square answers.

“You’ve been monitoring me like a lab rat,” I said. “That ends now.”

“You’re a vital resource, Anna.”

“I’m a person!”  I growled, struggling to maintain my composure.  “I have terms.”

“Proceed.”

“No more forced *retrievals*.  No more sedation *unless I request it*. I’ll willingly report what I *consciously* remember. No more, no less. No *hosting*.  I want a complete list of the abductees you’ve interrogated…”

“That’s a lot of terms, Anna,” he interrupted.  “I’m not sure…”

“I want *my* life *back*!”  I hissed.  “I *know* I won’t escape *LUNAR* or the Greys until the day I die.  I *refuse* to be controlled anymore.”

He tapped his pen against his chin, drawing out the moment, then stood, excusing himself and my father from the room.  

Two hours passed.  A secretary entered with coffee and a sandwich.  I refused to consume either – I couldn’t be certain the food and drink weren’t spiked.  A third hour.  A different staff member entered and removed the tray, brow furrowed when he saw the meal was untouched.  By the fourth hour, I regretted not slipping a snack into my handbag when I refilled my water bottle before leaving home.  

The secretary reappeared.  “Would you like to freshen up?” she politely offered.

Until that point, I had ignored my bladder, but now, the copious sips of water I had taken to quell my hunger, screamed I had less than a minute to get to the bathroom.  I gladly accepted the offer.

Ten minutes later, I returned to Larson’s office.  He was back, ensconced behind the mahogany desk.  Wordlessly, he slid a contract across the leather blotter.  

My father refused to look at me.

I studied the paperwork for exactly forty-two minutes. 

I signed.  

It wasn’t ideal, but it was a contract *I* had negotiated.  Not my *soul*.  Not my parents. Not the Greys.  *Me*.  I did this.  

Last night, I stood before the mirror, adjusting my new uniform blouse.

Indigo.

The left cuff itched slightly where the emblem was embroidered.  

A crescent moon within a square.

I caressed it, fingers lingering. It would likely soften with wear and washing.  For now, that discomfort was a reminder that I was taking control.  

*I* would be *LUNAR*’S irritation.
I looked like one of them now.

But I wasn’t theirs.

Not entirely.

Not anymore.
