A loud creaking jolted the man awake from his peaceful sleep. The sound resonated through his house as if someone was walking around downstairs in the living room. Rolling over in bed he turned to his wife to find her sound asleep. “Karen” he whispered, gently shaking her by the shoulder, “did you hear that”. She turned away muttering, “go back to sleep it's probably the racoons again.” The man settled back into bed trying to get back to sleep, but less than a minute later he heard a loud stomp. There was no denying this time that something was there. The only question running through his mind now was, is that noise inside or outside. 

Throwing the covers off he hoped out of bed rushing straight for his closet. Pulling his shirts out of the way he pressed his thumb onto the panel of his gun safe unlocking it with a click. He took out his M4 shotgun, racking a round into the chamber and turning on the mounted flashlight. If it wasn’t just racoons he didn’t want to take any chances. Closing the safe back he quietly crept toward the bedroom door, listening for the creak again. He held his breath waiting for the sound, but it never came. 

Deciding he needed to go check if his wife was right, he swung open the bedroom door, peering out into the empty hall. At a glance nothing seemed out of place, and he swore he would have heard if anyone had stumbled up his noisy staircase. Looking down at the staircase he was annoyed it was his problem to deal with now. Heading down to the main floor he kept his eye on the glow of his flashlight, trying his best to move quietly. Despite his best efforts the steps let out creaks and squeaks every other step. At the bottom of the stair, he stood still again patiently waiting for any sounds, scanning over the living room. 

Standing in the stillness of the night he almost managed to convince himself to just go back to bed. That his wife was right, and the racoons were just being mischievous tonight. Then a crash came from the back of his house. It was so loud the man wondered if a tree had fallen on his deck and how his wife could stay sleeping through all of this. Moving carefully though the house he headed toward the back deck off the kitchen. The crashes and creaks had settled, letting the quiet of the night return. 

As the man got closer to the glass doors leading out to the deck he could hear a faint crunching. It was a relaxing sound that let him relax, loosening the grip on his shotgun. His wife must have been right; it wasn't an intruder, just a rowdy animal stopping by for a late-night snack. Still while he was here a quick shine from the flashlight mounted on his gun ought to scare off the critters and let him get back to sleep. 

The man panned his flashlight out through the glass doors, expecting to see a frightened racoon scurrying off the deck. Instead, light illuminated onto four narrow fleshly legs holding up an amorphous sack of flesh. A long neck sprouted from the body precariously holding up a head with a sagging face. The creature looked back through the glass with a racoon tail dangling from its mouth. Hollow eyes looked into the light and the face seemed to smile tilting up the sagging corner of its mouth. Before he knew it the man was tightly bracing the shotgun to his shoulder. Two rounds of buckshot fired out from the gun shattering the glass door. 

The ringing out of the glass blended in with his blaring phone alarm, jolting the man awake in his bed. Fumbling to turn off the alarm he sat in bed wiping the sweat off his face confused at what was going on. It was just a dream he told himself, but it felt so real. His hands were trembling, and he could still feel the tension in his shoulder from firing the shotgun. He turned toward his wife but she wasn’t in bed. Dragging himself out of bed he threw on clothes hoping talking to his wife would bring back the feeling of normalcy. Getting ready for the day felt heavy, like moving through a fog as if this was the dream and not last night. 

Heading downstairs in the light of day everything seemed normal through the house, but he couldn’t shake his dream. His wife was waiting for him in the kitchen buttering some toast. He was about to sit down but found himself heading to the glass doors. 

“Is everything ok?” she asked. 

“I just had a bad dream.” 

Compelled to check out the doors, pressing against the glass. Everything seemed fine but touching the glass brought back the memories rushing from his dream. Still in the effects of the heavy fog he headed back upstairs to his closest examining his gun safe. 

Opening up the safe he backtracked through last night's events. Holding the shotgun in his hands he clung to the fading memory. He told himself again that it was just a dream as he unloaded his shotgun counting the rounds. All the rounds were accounted for, making him feel more than a little silly for checking. He loaded them back into the shotgun not sure what he had been expecting. Placing the shotgun back in the safe, the box of shotgun shells on the bottom shelf seemed ajar. He figured he must have bumped it taking out the shotgun but after seeing the box he couldn't stop himself. Opening the box, he counted through the remaining shells and two were missing.
