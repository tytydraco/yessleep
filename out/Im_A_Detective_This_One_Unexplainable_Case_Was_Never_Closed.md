You can never stop being a Detective. It’s the kind of career that changes the way your mind works and once you’ve started to think like a detective, the switch never really goes off. You start down a path, and you cannot go back… not that I would, even if I could.

&#x200B;

I’ve had a particularly interesting career as a detective both during my years on the police force and in the years since I left to start my own firm as a private investigator.

&#x200B;

It’s funny… I had actually left the police service with the expectation of taking on *less* stressful jobs. In fact, I almost expected it to be boring. I used to work in homicide and while it can be rewarding work, there is a mental toll to it. I’d like to claim to have some faith in humanity, but it’s hard to do that when you see the worst of it day in and day out. As a private investigator, I don’t see nearly as much carnage during my work… but the work is anything but boring.

&#x200B;

Last year I spent two hours being interrogated by American secret service agents because an adulterer I’d been trailing just so happened to be staying in the same hotel as a US ambassador and they found my parked car suspicious. I suppose part of the reason they even noticed it is because my car tends to stand out. It’s a red 1957 BMW 503 Coupe. Subtle? No, perhaps not and I have swapped it out for my wifes vehicle when necessary. (Her Toyota is far less conspicuous.) But a man should be permitted *some* vices, and my car is mine.

&#x200B;

A few years prior to that, I actually pressed charges against a gentleman after he opened fire on my car, causing considerable damage to the body. He had (correctly) suspected I’d been hired to look into the suspicious arson of a business he owned. One would think that the insurance fraud charges that would likely follow my investigation would be less severe than the murder charges he would have faced had he successfully killed me, or the attempted murder charges and property damage lawsuit he received but I digress. 

&#x200B;

My work remains exciting and my psychiatrist has thanked me for switching to a less stressful career… but I must admit that some days I do miss working in homicide. I don’t miss the bodies or the carnage… no… but I miss the feeling of accomplishment. The sense that I had done something good for some poor unfortunate strangers by granting the dead some justice and the living some peace.

&#x200B;

I suspect that was why I accepted the job from Gemma Shaw, a twisted nostalgia for the good old days. Had I known then what events would unfold… I’m not sure what I would have said to her. Would I have chased her out of my office like a stray cat, or would I have accepted anyway? Would I have accepted, knowing that the curious fate of Richard Shannon would keep me up at night for what may well be the rest of my life?

&#x200B;

I don’t know.

&#x200B;

I really don’t know.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Gemma Shaw was past 30 but had aged fairly gracefully and barely looked a day over 21. She had long brown hair, delicate features, and a charming, innocent smile. When the knock on my door that heralded Shaw came, I was at my desk, closing out a report I was going to email to a client regarding a case of insurance fraud. Nothing too interesting.

  “Come in.” I said without looking up from the screen of my laptop. Shaw entered quietly as if she were afraid of disturbing me. 

   “Sorry to bother you…” She said quietly, “Mr. Moore, right?”

  “I am,” I replied, looking over at her as I closed out my report, “What can I do for you, Miss…?”

  “Shaw, Gemma Shaw.”

&#x200B;

  “Miss Gemma Shaw,” I repeated, getting up and offering her a hand to shake and a reassuring smile. It seemed to put her a little more at ease as I guided her to a seat. “Charmed. What brings you to my doorstep?”

  “My father…” She said, “Trevor Shaw. He passed away around two years ago.”

  “I’m quite sorry for your loss, then.” I said. “What was his cause of death?”

  “Officially, suicide… but I’ve had some doubts about that for some time.”

  “Oh?”

  “My father wasn’t the sort of man to take his own life, Mr. Moore. I believe that there was more to his death.”

&#x200B;

  “I see. Miss Shaw, if you have suspicions or evidence suggesting foul play, I’d recommend you bring it to the police, not to me. I don’t typically take on homicide investigations anymore.”

  “I’ve already brought my suspicions to them,” She said, her tone growing a little more bitter. “I brought them up during the initial investigation after his death… they still deemed it a suicide.”

  “So why are you here, two years later?” I asked, raising an eyebrow at her.

&#x200B;

On cue, she produced a folder from her coat.

 “I have some friends in the police department… they don’t usually make a habit of passing things like this along to me. But given the circumstances, they thought it was necessary.”

She offered me the folder and I looked through it. It contained several photocopied pages of some sort of notebook. A list of names and dates. One of those names was Trevor Shaw.

  “Scans from the ledger of one Mr. Damien Scott. I recall you heard of him in the news?”

&#x200B;

Damien Scott… the name did sound familiar. He’d been in the employ of the Morrow crime syndicate, based out of London. From what I’d heard, he was the lapdog of their current head, a gentleman with a rather unpleasant reputation by the name of Jack Morrow. When Morrow or one of his mates wanted a man dead, Scott was allegedly the one they sent. No one quite knew how he operated… by all accounts, the man was some sort of murderous genius. For every kill, he seemed to have some sort of perfect alibi. It had made catching him especially difficult. From what I heard, they’d technically only gotten him on money laundering and were trying to build up from there.

&#x200B;

Unsurprisingly, they hadn’t gotten far with him. Supposedly he’d conveniently hung himself in prison, although few of my old mates still on the force had mentioned that he’d still left behind quite a bit of information. Ledgers on victims the Morrow family had paid him to kill. By itself, it wasn’t damning evidence, but it opened up quite a few doors that Morrow would probably have rather remained closed.

&#x200B;

Doors like Trevor Shaw.

  “Interesting,” I said softly, staring down at the name on the ledger before closing the folder. “You’ve brought this to the police?”

  “My fathers death was a closed case. They’re prioritizing the ones that are still open. The ones they didn’t solve,” Gemma said. “But I always knew that his death wasn’t a suicide and as far as I’m concerned this proves it.”

  “It just might…” I admitted, “Scott was a hired killer. Say he did murder your father… he likely did it on Jack Morrow’s orders.”

  “My father had no connections to Morrow,” Gemma said sharply.

  “You’re sure of that?”

  “I’m positive.”

  “Then why would he be murdered by Morrow’s pet hitman?”

&#x200B;

  “Because one of the men he worked with did. My father owned a construction company. After he passed away, one of his partners, Richard Shannon took over. I *know* that Shannon has ties to Jack Morrow… I just can’t prove it.”

  “And this is where I come in, isn’t it?” I asked. She nodded.

  “If you can prove Shannon is connected to Morrow… maybe it would be enough to get someone to reopen my fathers case. Please… I *know* that man paid to have my father murdered. He’s gotten away with it for too long… he can’t *keep* getting away with it. Please, Mr. Moore… I don’t know who else to turn to.”

&#x200B;

She stared at me, pleading with her big brown eyes and I knew that she was desperate. And maybe it was that look that finally sold me. As I said before, I’d put my days of homicide investigations behind me… but I’d seen that look on her face before. She wasn’t the first person to plead wth me to grant them closure. Odds are, she wouldn’t be the last either. 

  “If there’s a connection between him and Morrow, I’ll find it,” I promised. 

The look on her face… the relief… it defied expression. 

  “Thank you Mr. Moore,” She said and that tone in her voice reminded me of the good old days… the days where I could give closure to the mourning. 

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

There’s a useful four letter word… and Richard Shannon was full of it. As I started to dig into the man, it became immediately clear to me that he was an insufferable prick. Before I even set eyes on him in person, I did some snooping online. I don’t personally partake in social media… but it does make my job much easier. You can learn a lot about a person through what they post online and Shannon could barely go an hour without posting. 

&#x200B;

He was a greasy looking man with a graying goatee and a cowlick who seemed to fancy himself some sort of business influencer. His LinkedIn profile described him as: *Prometheus, Igniter of the Human Renaissance, Entrepreneur, Advisor, Analyst, Engineer, Investor, Success Coach, Futurist, Disruptor.*

&#x200B;

I suppose in a way, his little biography told me everything I needed to know about him, although maybe not in the way he anticipated. Most of what he shared came down to typed sermons on how to succeed in business. Unfortunately, almost all of it came across as soulless socially incompetent madness.

&#x200B;

The three most recent posts he’d made read as follows:

&#x200B;

*‘I’m going to say it, YES you should be putting your business over your family! Your business PROVIDES for your family! There’s countless people out there who will share tear jerking posts about how you’ll regret missing out on moments and milestones but the harsh reality is that building a foundation for your childrens future requires SACRIFICE! If you will not SACRIFICE your family FOR your family, they will NOT thrive! My son Taylor UNDERSTANDS that I might not be there for every moment but he's why I'm GRINDING FOR THAT FUTURE! So put the business first! Your kids will THANK YOU for it! Agree?’*

&#x200B;

*‘Understand which employees are assets and which are liabilities. The employees job is to serve the company, NOT the other way around. I let go of a gentleman who spent five years working for me today after he broke the news that his wife was pregnant. I let him go because I knew that he would no longer prioritize the business over his family. He lacked the HUNGER required for success! If an employee is no longer an ASSET, then they are a LIABILITY. DM me to learn more.’*

&#x200B;

*‘If you are making under 80,000 pounds a year, you are NOT in a position to start a family. Your salary is a clear indication of your worth. If it is low, then you are NOT in a position to have children! You are simply setting yourself up for deeper failure! There is no case for argument here.’*

&#x200B;

In a word… lunacy. Complete and utter lunacy. And yet his modest amount of followers all seemed to gobble it up, lauding him as though he was some kind of corporate Nostradamus. He spoke of hustle and grind as though he were some top floor executive, changing the fate of society with naught but a phone call as opposed to a small man who’d suspiciously inherited a relatively unremarkable company. ‘*All Hat and No Cattle*’ as an American friend of mine sometimes says.

&#x200B;

I rarely feel much of anything for the people I am asked to investigate… but I will confess that I did feel a profound dislike for Richard Shannon. Fortunately for me, ego often goes hand in hand with incompetence… and I imagined that Shannon would prove to be no exception. I had imagined that a man like Shannon might keep his secrets in one of two places. His home office or his company office. 

&#x200B;

The company office seemed the logical place to start and I’d have an easier time getting in there without a warrant. Shannon worked in his office from 11-7 Tuesday to Friday. He was not the first to arrive, but he was indeed the last to leave. I spent a few days trailing him at a distance to get a feel for his schedule, and once I’d gotten a feel for his routine, I made my move. 

&#x200B;

Now, in the interest of transparency here, I'll admit that some may call what I did breaking and entering. Lockpicking just so happens to be one of many nifty, albiet unscrupulous skills I've picked up during my career. Although if asked I'd tell a judge the door just happened to be unlocked. Either way, I found myself well enough alone in Shannon's office and wasted no time in having a look around. I started with his desk, looking through any papers he'd left out but none of them were relevant to my investigation.

&#x200B;

So I moved on to his laptop.

&#x200B;

As I said, ego often goes hand in hand with incompetence. A startling number of people leave their phones and laptops unlocked… and almost as many use piss poor passwords that are fairly easy to guess. Shannon wasn't stupid enough for the former camp but he was stupid enough for the latter… the idiot had even enabled his laptop to give him a hint, as if there was any way he could *forget* the password.

&#x200B;

**Hint: Why grind?**

&#x200B;

My first guess, *'Future'* didn't log me in, but my second did.

&#x200B;

*'Taylor*.'

&#x200B;

Well, at least he was a little sentimental.

&#x200B;

I wasted no time in opening up his emails to skim through them. Like the papers on his desk, most of them weren’t relevant to my investigation. But given the amount of personal correspondence he’d used his professional email for, I had little doubt that what I was looking for would be in there.

&#x200B;

Despite my focus on his laptop, the sound of footsteps outside of the office didn’t escape my notice. I froze, looking up to see a figure out in the hall. Instinctively, my hand dropped to the gun I kept at my side, although that instinct faded quickly the moment I saw the face of my visitor. 

  “Well, well, old man. Hope you don’t mind my joining you. The door was unlocked.”

&#x200B;

I almost laughed at his wry remark as he sauntered into the room as if he owned the place.

  “Neil Rutland,” I said, “Following my trail again?”

  “A cherry red BMW is difficult to miss, you know.” Rutland said. “You really ought to upgrade to something more subtle.”

  “Well, what’s the point in owning a classic if one doesn’t drive it?” I asked. 

  “What indeed?” He conceded with a shrug. He rounded Shannons desk as if he was just as entitled to see what I saw as I was and I did nothing to stop him.

&#x200B;

Neil Rutland was a man I’d known for decades. Once upon a time, during my days in homicide he’d been my partner and having spent a good portion of my career working alongside of him, he was one of the few men I trusted implicitly. Rutland was a charming man with a low voice with a mild Scottish accent. He wore his hair in a bit of a combover to hide his receding hairline and had intense, focused eyes. Despite his charm and the warmth he radiated, he’d always been the less personable between us, which suited me fine. He’d left homicide shortly before I had, although he hadn’t left the force, he’d simply moved on to cases of fraud.

&#x200B;

  “Interesting running into you here,” I noted, watching as Rutland stared down at the laptop. “I take it this isn’t coincidence?”

  “Yes and no,” Rutland admitted. “I imagine you’re aware that the former owner of this particular company was named in the ledger of one Mr. Damien Scott, correct?”

  “I’m well aware. Trevor Shaw. A suicide, though his daughter contests it.”

  “That’s who hired you?” Rutland asked. I didn’t confirm it, but my silence said enough.

&#x200B;

  “So what brings you here?” I asked.

  “A favor to a friend, working in organized crime. They don’t have the resources to investigate every name in that ledger, but he had some suspicions about our friend Mr. Shannon.”

  “You’re looking for ties to the Morrow syndicate?” I asked.

  “Whatever I can find,” He said. “You’re after the same, aren’t you? And you were kind enough to open the door for me.”

  “And you were kind enough to ask for my assistance on this matter of mutual interest,” I said.

&#x200B;

Rutland laughed.

  “Yes, I suppose I was.” He said as we both looked down at the laptop again.

  “What have you found so far?” I asked.

  “Well aside from being positively mental, Shannon seems clean. Divorced. Lives alone. Seldom goes out.”

  “Well, a man like that wouldn’t likely be the center of attention in an operation like Morrows,” I said, as Rutland stepped aside to let me finish combing through the emails. He instead focused his energy on a nearby filing cabinet.

&#x200B;

  “Maybe not, but he might know who would be. Your client… she wants evidence that her fathers death is a syndicate hit, doesn’t she? Enough to reopen the case.”

  “Correct,” I said.

  “Say you found it… you’d make damn fine witnesses against Mr. Shannon. How much pressure do you think a man like him would need before he cracked?”

  “Oh, not much,” I said. “Especially if you find just the right…”

&#x200B;

I paused, staring at something down on the screen. An email… just what I’d been looking for. I read over it, before calling over Rutland.

  “Take a look at this.”

&#x200B;

Rutland looked away from the folders he’d been thumbing through before coming to read the email over my shoulder. It had been sent from an email address that seemed to belong to the late Mr. Scott and read as follows:

&#x200B;

*Shannon.*

*You’ve got a chance to do the right thing. One payment. Our business is concluded. You can have a fresh start somewhere else.*

&#x200B;

  “Well, well… how ominous,” Rutland said, as I put the email Scott had used into the search bar. It brought up a whole series of buried emails, each one from the same address. I clicked into the next one.

&#x200B;

*Shannon.*  
*Not accusing you of anything, but numbers don’t lie. Jack doesn’t like it when people get greedy. We don’t want to think the worst of you. Check your budget for 192 Gordon St again, please.*

&#x200B;

Rutland read over the email with narrowed eyes before turning and heading back to the file cabinet.

  “192 Gordon Street…” He murmured, before taking out a folder and opening it.

  “Flats… been under construction since 2017. Completed last month.”

  “Really? Quite a long development, isn’t it?” I asked, looking over as Rutland examined the folder. He huffed in bemusement.

&#x200B;

  “Two fires… destroying everything and resetting it back to zero… 200 plus people on payroll… high salaries, ‘consulting fees’, supply invoices… somebody pulled these numbers out of their arse.”

  “Money laundering?” I asked.

  “Most likely… although I can’t imagine every name on payroll was on site, putting in work either. I’ll need to go over this in detail.”

&#x200B;

  “You may not have time,” I said, “Looks like Morrow suspected Shannon of taking more than his share. Whoever took Scott in just might’ve done our man a favor in keeping his name out of that ledger, but I doubt Morrow will be inclined to forgive and forget.”

  “Well it’s not usually how he does business,” Rutland admitted. “Even with Scott gone, our man Shannon must be watching every shadow right now.” 

  “A man that scared might be looking for some new friends.” I suggested.

Rutland nodded slowly.

  “Yes… he just might be. Shall we introduce ourselves?”

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

The Headmasters Steakhouse was one of the more upscale spots in town. I’d dined there on a few special occasions, although it really wouldn’t have been my first choice. *Upscale* and *good* were not necessarily mutually exclusive terms. The food wasn’t bad. Not by any means. But the place had what I could only describe as a rather pretentious atmosphere. That said, I suppose if I wanted to impress clients and had my head firmly lodged up my own arse, it might just be the place I would have taken them.

&#x200B;

According to Richard Shannon's calendar, he was scheduled to be dining with a client at 8 PM at the Headmaster… and I really do wonder if Rutland and I may have done that client a favor by interrupting.

&#x200B;

Shannon sat jovially at his table, talking loudly, eating a lobster thermidor, and shooting back an expensive bottle of champagne like it was cheap liquor. Judging by the flush in his cheeks, he was already drunk. As we sat at a nearby table, Rutland regarded him with a sardonic disgust and his client didn’t seem to think much better of him. They left quickly after Rutland and I got up to approach the table.

  “Richard Shannon?” Rutland asked. I let him take the lead in talking to him.

  “Hmm? Yeah?” His words were slurred and almost unintelligible. 

  “Detective Neil Rutland. And this is my dear friend, Detective Simon Moore. May we sit down?”

&#x200B;

Shannon’s expression darkened. He seemed to sober up a little as if realizing why we were likely there. His client took the opportunity to quietly excuse themselves and he didn’t say a word as they did. Rutland didn’t wait for an answer. He just sat down across from Shannon as if he’d been invited. I caught him staring down at the lobster on his plate, bright red and dramatically splayed out on its back, with its meat proudly on display in its hollow shell.

&#x200B;

  “My apologies for interrupting your dinner. But this really couldn’t wait,” He said. “I’m sure you understand, considering the borrowed time you’re living on… oh but don’t get me wrong this is a lovely way to spend it! Fine food, fine champagne, Dom Perignon 53… fantastic.”

  “What can I help you gentlemen with?” Shannon asked, his words still slurred but his tone far colder than it had been before.

  “Oh I don’t believe you can help us,” Rutland said. “But… we may be able to help you.”

&#x200B;

Shannon just continued to stare at us as Rutland continued.

  “Jack Morrow is a dangerous man to have as an enemy. I’m not here to make any insinuations about your honesty or moral character. But Morrow? Well, seems he’s already made up his mind about you, hasn’t he?”

  “Your point?” Shannon asked.

  “Well in your shoes, most men might find themselves a little nervous,” Rutland said. “I certainly would. Even with Damien Scott out of the picture, I really can’t imagine you’ve got much time left.”

&#x200B;

  “Those affairs are my business, not yours,” Shannon said.

  “I disagree. I think they are,” Rutland said. “Let me make this clear, Mr. Shannon. From where I’m sitting right now, I see a man in over his head, about to drown. I can help.”

&#x200B;

Shannon cracked a dry smile.

  “You must be the ones who were poking around my office last night,” He said softly. “Whatever help you think you can offer me… I don’t want it.”

  “You may come to regret that statement,” Rutland said. “Say you do make it out of this Morrow situation with your life… you do realize that with what we found in your office, you’re likely to go down with him, right?”

  “If Morrow goes down.” Shannon said.

&#x200B;

  “If?” It was my turn to chime in. “I would’ve thought a man in your position would be eager to see Morrow go down.”

  “Maybe,” Shannon said. “But not to the likes of you… let me put it this way, detectives. I’ve got the Morrow situation under control. So unless you’ve got enough to arrest me right here and now, there’s really nothing for us to talk about, you got that?”

  “You don’t strike me as a man in control…” I noted.

  “Then you don’t know me. Is there anything else, detectives or are we done here?”

&#x200B;

Rutland narrowed his eyes at him, before looking over at me. Neither of us had much more to say.

  “Goodbye, gentlemen,” Shannon said, rudely shooing us away like a couple of houseflies. Rutland stood up and fixed his suit jacket.

  “Goodbye, Mr. Shannon,” He said curtly before turning to leave. I took one last look at Shannon before following him.

&#x200B;

  “The man’s either a damn fool or about to do something damn foolish…” Rutland murmured as we left the restaurant.

  “Not much of a line between arrogance and idiocy, is there?” I agreed. “My gut says arrogance.”

  “Mine too… normally I’d be content to wait for the funeral but…”

  “He’s more valuable to us alive.”

&#x200B;

Rutland nodded. As we stepped outside, he went for a cigarette. I lit it for him.

  “I’ll watch him,” I promised. “Track his movements. See if anyone else is keeping an eye on him.”

Rutland nodded, taking a deep drag of his cigarette.

  “That’d be best… but use your wifes car, will you?”

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

I suppose it was not surprising that Richard Shannon lived in a fairly nice house. Even without his ties to the Morrow syndicate, I would have expected him to live comfortably and had he been a fully legitimate businessman, I may not have even batted an eye at the luxury of his residence. It was a two storey tall Mediterranean-style house with a balcony over the second floor. I may not have described it as exceedingly luxurious, but a house like that would’ve sold for a few million pounds easily. 

&#x200B;

He lived alone. He left for only for work and rarely returned later than 8 PM. He did not go out otherwise. Even on the weekend, he remained secluded in his home, blinds and curtains drawn as if he were afraid of anyone peeking inside. Had I not seen the careless bravado he’d been so keen to display the other day I might well have thought him a completely different man than the one I met at the steakhouse. 

&#x200B;

Rutland and I took shifts watching Shannon. He would watch him during the day, I would watch him during the evenings. As per Rutland’s request, I had switched up the vehicles I used for my shifts watching him. I used my wifes car and on a few occasions I rented a car with which to watch him. I never parked in the same spot either. Rutland had asked I take extra precautions and I was inclined to humor him… although really, after several days of watching Shannon I was starting to think I may well have not even bothered. Nothing seemed to be happening and I was almost ready to suggest we have another chat with our man when… well… 

&#x200B;

I’m still not entirely sure *what* to make of what happened that night. I suppose this was the moment this relatively simple and routine investigation finally took its surreal turn. I recognize that up until this point I’ve spared few details regarding the background of my investigation. Truth be told there may have been some that were not important to this telling, but I still thought it best to exclude nothing. I’m still not entirely sure how to explain what happened with Richard Shannon next as each and every logical explanation I’ve tried to come up with has simply defied me. 

&#x200B;

It was six nights after Rutland and I had first spoken to Shannon at the Headmasters Steakhouse. Four nights since we’d begun to shadow him. Up until then, he had mostly behaved like a recluse… and I truly don’t know why things changed on *that* particular night.

&#x200B;

Perhaps he caught wind that Morrow was preparing to make a move on him? Perhaps, despite my best efforts, he realized he was being watched. I really can’t say.

&#x200B;

Either way - six nights after we had approached Richard Shannon, he left his house in a hurry.

&#x200B;

It was around midnight when I watched him from across the street as he shuffled out into his car, looking a tad more skittish than usual. As he took off down the street, I followed him at a distance. I wasn’t sure where he was going, but he seemed to be in quite the hurry.

&#x200B;

He was heading out of town, following some darkened backroad. His headlights illuminated shadowy trees draped in autumn leaves as he sped down the highway, still slick from the rain. I followed him for the better part of 45 minutes down winding backroads leading to seemingly nowhere at all and at some point, I turned off my headlights completely and let myself fall further behind him until I could only see the distant red glow of his taillights far ahead of me.

&#x200B;

He stopped seemingly at random along some unnamed, barely paved road and as he stopped, I did the same, pausing around the bend and turning off my car lest he see or hear me. I could see movement near his vehicle. Shannon was clearly getting out and in the faint light that came from his dying headlights I could see his shadow walking into the forest.

&#x200B;

I watched him until the shadows swallowed him up completely… and then I waited. I watched my clock. Richard Shannon stayed in that darkness for over half an hour. I saw no flashlight in amongst the trees. I saw no sign that he’d done anything but wander aimlessly into the night.

&#x200B;

He was simply gone.

&#x200B;

And when he came out again, he hurried to his car at an anxious jog, throwing himself behind the wheel again and hastily keying the engine. He started driving before he could even get his seatbelt on, speeding away as fast as he could. I almost lost sight of him in my struggle to turn my own car back on to follow him.

&#x200B;

From there, Shannon found his way back to the main highway, all too quickly leaving the backroads behind. When he returned to his house, I saw him step out of the drivers seat a shade paler than he’d been before. I noticed him clutching his right hand uneasily and could have sworn he had a rag wrapped around it, almost as if it was injured. 

&#x200B;

He didn’t linger outside for long, simply running straight into his house and locking the door behind him. Through his curtains and blinds, I could see that the lights were still on. I could see his shadow pacing around doing… something, but I had no idea what. The lights never went off that night, and come morning, Richard Shannon did not leave for work.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

  “Odd,” Rutland said as he joined me the next morning. We sat side my side in my wifes car, staring at his house thoughtfully. Only one light was on now, up on the second floor.

  “Some sort of meetup, perhaps?”

  “Possible… but unlikely. I saw no other cars out there.”

  “They’d be easy to miss in the dark,” Rutland said.

  “Perhaps… but I’m not sure if I’m convinced this was some sort of meeting. There’d be far more practical ways to conduct one.”

&#x200B;

  “There would be, but this lot have all kinds of stupid ideas they’ll pass off as smart.”

  “Clandestine meetings at midnight in the woods, though?”

  “Simon you and I have both heard stupider things.”

I nodded but wasn’t quite convinced yet.

&#x200B;

When I came back that evening to take my shift watching Shannon's place, Rutland had no news for me.

  “I’m not sure what he’s up to in there… but he hasn’t left all day,” He said, a hint of frustration in his voice. “No visitors either.”

I noticed that the same light on the second floor was on.

&#x200B;

Curious.

  “Maybe he’ll have another late night rendezvous,” I said, half joking. 

  “Perhaps. You’ll call me if anything comes up?”

  “Of course.”

&#x200B;

He nodded, before bidding me good night and leaving. I wish I could say that the night after Shannon’s little late night drive was interesting, but it really wasn’t. The light on the second floor stayed on… there were no shadows that moved inside the house.

&#x200B;

Nothing changed.

&#x200B;

That didn’t sit right with me.

&#x200B;

When Rutland returned to take over his shift that morning, I was waiting for him outside of my car.

  “And here I thought you were trying to be subtle,” He said, half teasing although I saw the concern on his face. He took one look at that house, and knew something was wrong, just as I did.

  “There’s been no movement inside that house since the night he went into the woods,” I said. “There’s one light on… and it hasn’t changed since yesterday evening.”

&#x200B;

Rutland just stared at the house in silence, his expression going grave. We both knew from experience that a man on a crime lords hit list didn’t have a particularly long life expectancy, and both of us knew that there were plenty of ways one of Morrow's men could have snuck past us. For all we knew, Richard Shannon could be long dead… and there was only one way to find out for certain.

&#x200B;

Rutland exhaled through his nose before looking at me. 

  “Let’s check in on the old man, then,” He said before we walked side by side towards Shannons front door.

Rutland rapped on the door with the back of his hand although predictably there was no answer. He and I exchanged a look, before he knocked again for courtesys sake. I on the other hand wasn’t so courteous. When Shannon didn’t show any signs of answering, I picked the lock. 

&#x200B;

The door swung open and we calmly stepped inside. Shannon's house was as silent as a tomb. It was tidy but not necessarily clean, with dust settled on most of the lesser used furniture. Once upon a time this place had, had a womans touch. Not anymore.

  “Mr. Shannon?” Rutland called, but there was no answer.

&#x200B;

I started up the stairs to the second floor, wasting no time on formalities. I spotted a closed door with a light underneath it once I got up there and pushed it open.

&#x200B;

What I saw inside that room defied any rational explanation I could hope to give it. 

&#x200B;

Shannon had taken a knife to just about every surface he could inside of that room, carving some sort of rune or sigil into it them. The walls, the door, the windowsills, even the floor. The same rune, over and over again.

  “Bloody hell…” I said under my breath. 

&#x200B;

Beside me, Rutland just stared in confused disbelief, unsure what to make of any of this madness.

&#x200B;

Madness…

&#x200B;

That really was the only word for it.

&#x200B;

The room was devoid of furniture. The only thing in it was a red leather bound book on the floor. It had no title on the cover, so I picked it up and thumbed through it.

  “What is it?” Rutland asked as my brow furrowed.

  “Some sort of… grimoire…” I said softly, before opening it to a page that Shannon had folded down.

&#x200B;

***The Man In The Forest.***

&#x200B;

Rutland got closer to me, reading the text of the grimoire over my shoulder. The section that Shannon had marked off described a ritual to summon some sort of… entity. 

&#x200B;

*Enter the deepest shadows at the forest at the deepest darkness of midnight. Bring with you no protective charms or weapons. Walk until light has abandoned you.*  


*Find a suitable tree and with a ritual dagger, mark it with your own blood.*

&#x200B;

*He will come, drawn to the scent of blood.*

&#x200B;

*Call to Him. Make your offering. Should He fall silent, you have his attention. Should he still approach, your death is nigh.*

&#x200B;

*Offer up an effigy of your Despised, and in your hatred, pin it to the marked tree.*

&#x200B;

*Should the forest be silent still, your contract is sealed. Should He draw closer, your life has ended.*

&#x200B;

*Thank The Man in the Forest, and leave quickly.* 

&#x200B;

*Return immediately to the sanctuary you have prepared and pray He hunts your Despised before He hunts you. Pray your Despised does not know how to protect themselves from Him, or if they do, pray their Sanctuary is weaker than yours.* 

&#x200B;

*It cannot be stopped now. At least one of you will be rended by his claws. Only He can decide which of you it will be.*

&#x200B;

Madness… it had to be… complete and utter madness. Some sort of occult ritual to summon some sort of demon to… do what? Kill a man? Who? Morrow? 

&#x200B;

Rutland stared down at the book, his brow furrowed in confusion. He didn’t seem to know what to make of any of this either. Although, as we stared down at the book in disbelief, our eyes were both drawn toward something on the floor beneath us.

&#x200B;

Marks in the wood.

&#x200B;

Long trails, scratched into it… trails that led toward an air vent in the floor. If I didn’t know any better… I might have said that they were fingernail markings.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

We needed to call in homicide after what we’d found in Richard Shannon’s house, although I really think that it goes without saying that they found nothing.

&#x200B;

No body.

&#x200B;

No blood.

&#x200B;

Nothing.

&#x200B;

While I was able to present the evidence that Rutland and I had gathered to Gemma Shaw and earn my payday from her, the case was never really closed. Richard Shannon was eventually listed as a missing person and the general consensus is that he went into hiding, either to hide from Morrow or to hide from us, after he realized he was being investigated. An active warrant is out for his arrest… but I know they’ll never find him.

&#x200B;

Richard Shannon is gone.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

It was a month after his disappearance that I got an email from Neil Rutland. Rutland wasn’t usually the type to stay in touch, so I knew that whatever this was, it was likely important. His email contained a couple of attatchments. One was a PDF of some of the files from the Damien Scott investigation. I skimmed through them. Most of it was details I’d already heard from some other former colleagues. But Rutland had sent me one thing that my colleagues hadn’t.

&#x200B;

Photographs from Scott’s residence in London.

&#x200B;

Most of them were unremarkable… but near the end of the set were several pictures of a bare room Scott had kept in his basement.

&#x200B;

A room with familiar sigils carved into its walls, onto its windowsills, onto the door… everywhere. The very same sigils Shannon had used in his occult room.

&#x200B;

The second attachment that Rutland had sent me was a video from a porch camera across the street from Damien Scott’s house. The footage was dated as being from the same night that Richard Shannon had gone into the forest. In it, I could see a car pulling up in front of Scott’s house… and I could see a familiar man getting out.

&#x200B;

Jack Morrow.

&#x200B;

His face is only visible for a few moments, but it was long enough for me to ID him. As soon as he got out of the car, he went straight for Scott’s house, running inside as fast as he could.

&#x200B;

At a glance, the footage seemed strange but mostly unremarkable… but I’ve watched it a few times now. I’ve watched it over and over again, looking for any other details I might be able to find. And there’s one thing in that video that I’m not sure I can explain.

&#x200B;

At a glance, Jack Morrow is the only person visible in that video. But looking closer… I could swear I see another figure standing in the shadows on the left hand side of the screen.

&#x200B;

I could swear that Morrow *looks* directly at that figure during the few moments where his face is visible on camera.

&#x200B;

And I could swear that the look on his face is one of pure terror.

&#x200B;

I don’t believe I’ll be continuing with the Richard Shannon case, or any cases related to it. I’m not sure I want the [answers.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/)
