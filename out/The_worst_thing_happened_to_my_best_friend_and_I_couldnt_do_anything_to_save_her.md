Hi reddit, I want to tell you about something terrible that happened to my best friend, whom I will call G, approximately 11 years ago. This post is more for me to vent and ask for advice or opinions, please read until the end.

I know what I'm going to say will sound crazy and impossible to believe and in fact I don't expect you to believe me, I just want to share what happened to her years ago, I've been keeping it to myself for too long, I write this with anger and helplessness for not having been able to do more for her when I could...

So, I was 16 when everything happened, my best friend G was 17, she was one of the few friends I made in high school, she was beautiful and tall, I loved being with her, we were both from Nayarit (a state in Mexico) and we agreed on many other things, we had incredible chemistry and I started to fall a little in love with her, but someone had to come along to ruin everything, you see at my school there was a BULLY whom I will call R, he always made fun of me at school, he messed with everyone, especially me, the teachers never did anything because they never gave him importance, besides he lied very well and always acted as if he didn't do anything to me, but what made me the most angry is how he approached G and he tried to flirt with her or even touch her under her skirt, R was a very perverted boy, but he almost always only focused on G, she was a shy and reserved girl, so she never said anything, nor did she want me to say anything.

All this continued for several months until one day R asked G to be his girlfriend outside of school, I saw them from afar, and the obvious happened, G with some fear rejected him, I already knew that was going to happen, but I did not expect R's reaction, he left very very upset, I think I have never seen him so humiliated and frustrated in his entire life, although I admit that it was very satisfying for me to see him like that, later that same day he wrote to me on Facebook and said the following words: IDIOT, very soon absolutely EVERYTHING of G will be MINE, her life, her body, her mind and everything she has and loves, will soon belong to me! I assumed he said it out of anger, so I didn't take his threats seriously, but just 2 days after R didn't come to class, the teachers informed us that R had died of unknown causes the night before…

We were all in shock and secretly a little relieved, we knew he came from a dysfunctional family and it was rumored that he suffered abuse from his parents, so I figured he simply committed suicide, although I was told that the cause of death didn't seem to have any apparent reason, it was as if his heart had stopped beating from one moment to the next…

Behind me was G, I could see her hiding a smile when the teacher informed us of R's death, I knew she hated him a lot, but I didn't think she was that sadistic, shortly after that, G began to behave in a way... very very different and when I say different it's because she really seemed like another person, although I noticed that she tried to hide it when I was near her, she became very rude, disrespectful, very rough, she no longer looked anything like the shy and quiet girl I knew, her behavior was strangely similar to R's, in short, she became more "masculine" but the strangest thing came one day when she sent me a half-naked photo of herself with the message "friend look at the great body I have" on WhatsApp, but she deleted it 1 minute later, we were best friends, but she would never send me something like that, especially because as I said, she was shy and reserved...

Until one day, fed up with the weird that was acting G, I asked her for explanations without backing down, she told me to go to her house after school, her parents would not be home all day and there she would explain everything to me, when we arrived and went up to her room "she" or rather he, confessed everything to me... the one who was in G's body was R who using a possession spell or something like that, which he found on the deep web, had managed to possess G, she also told me that the photo she sent me was by mistake and that she actually wanted to send it to a friend to whom she had told her secret, although he needed one last thing for the possession to become PERMANENT.

R told me all this while squeezing her breasts with the smile of a psychopath, that was very unpleasant and scary to see…

He needed someone to have sex with him and cum inside him, R ordered me to do it, but I refused, I was very very angry, I had taken my best friend's life away, I yelled at him to give me back G by taking him by the arm, but he yelled at me to get away by kicking me in the crotch, then he told me that if it wasn't me, he would just get someone else, after all, any man would want to do it with G, I was too confused, upset and sad at that moment, I didn't know what to do, what he told me was true, but I don't know why this idea went through my head at that moment, I thought that maybe if I do what he wants I will return G to normal, I raised my head and looked at him, he was looking at me with a look that conveyed anger, superiority and a lot of pleasure to see me like that, he put his hands on his waist, it was then that with a firm voice He said to me: WELL?! STUPID?! WILL YOU HAVE SEX WITH ME OR NOT?! It was then that I told him something that to this day I regret, I said yes, let's do it, just promise that you will bring G back… he just replied, I will think about it…

I don't want to give too many details of what we did, just that R picked me up and roughly laid me down on his bed, took off his school uniform and bra, I instinctively took off my shirt, things escalated quickly, we lasted about 10 minutes before I finished inside, R had achieved his goal...

After that R made me get dressed and quickly kicked me out of the house, the vacation started soon after and R convinced her new parents to change her school since according to "her" she was harassed a lot, she moved with her parents to California and I didn't know absolutely anything more about "her" because she blocked me from everywhere, but I found out something about "her" recently from some photos on Facebook and she is unrecognizable, she invested a lot of money in her body, from what I saw she is kind of famous, but you know what is the The worst thing about all this? R is already married… she has continued with her life and now runs a beauty products company, but that is not the worst of all, she is now the mother of 2 children and her family lives very well because “she” and her husband earn a lot of money and travel a lot with their children, when I saw the person he had become, I felt incredible rage, he stole my best friend’s life, he got married and started a family against G’s will…

Anyway, this is more for me to vent and if you want any advice or opinion it wouldn't hurt, what would you have done in my place? Is there any way to get G back? What do you think about what R did?

btw, here I have some photos of G before and after R possessed her....
