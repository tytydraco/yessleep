I’ve experienced things in my life that I still can’t explain, and though I grew up religious and always believed in the idea of the paranormal, nothing could have prepared me for the moments that still haunt me to this day. One of my earliest memories of something unexplainable happened when I was about seven or eight years old in my bedroom. The floor was hardwood, the kind that creaked when you shifted your weight, and I remember sitting on it one afternoon, playing with my Dora doll, the one whose hair could grow and shrink at the push of a button. I’d pressed it a hundred times before, but that day the doll’s head jerked sharply on its own, snapping toward me in one unnatural, mechanical twist. The sound of it was too quick, too alive. The hair button hadn’t been touched. My stomach turned cold as the silence in the room pressed against my ears, until all at once I threw the doll into my toy box and bolted down the hall to my mom, who brushed it off as my imagination. I knew better. I never touched that doll again. Around the same time, I had just come inside from playing with my friends, showered, and wiped the steam from the bathroom mirror when my heart suddenly stopped. My reflection looked back at me, but it didn’t feel like mine at all. The eyes were darker, meaner somehow, as if they belonged to someone else who was only wearing my face. The longer I stared, the heavier the air felt around me, until it seemed like my reflection was mocking me, pretending to be me, but hiding something sinister just beneath the surface. I leaned closer, breath fogging the glass again, until fear surged up my chest so suddenly that I had to yank myself away. Even now, I can’t shake the feeling that something else had stared back at me that day.

When I was thirteen, my family moved into the house my parents still live in now a one-story home with a basement. The bedrooms, living room, dining room, and kitchen were all on the same floor, with my mom’s room directly next to mine, our doors so close they nearly touched at the hinges. My own bedroom was right above the staircase leading down into the basement, which had two rooms: a boiler room/ storage room, and my sister’s bedroom. During our first week there, my mom asked me to take something into the storage room. I opened the basement door, and from the top of the stairs I caught a glimpse of her, a woman with long hair, moving too quickly for me to see her face, slipping behind the wall. Every nerve in my body screamed. I slammed the door, ran to my mom, and told her flat out that I wasn’t going down there. That night, though, I forgot what I’d seen and ended up sleeping in the basement room with my sister. Around 3 a.m., I woke up sick to my stomach and started rushing upstairs. The second my foot landed on the same stair where I had seen that woman earlier, I doubled over and vomited violently, my entire body convulsing. Maybe it was greasy pizza, maybe coincidence but it felt deliberate, timed, like whatever I’d seen wanted me to know I hadn’t imagined it.

Strange things only built from there. One afternoon I was babysitting my youngest sister. I had her down for a nap in my mom’s room, and I was sitting at my vanity in my own room across the hall, with the door open so I could hear her. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a figure slip into my mom’s room. Assuming it was her, I called her name and went to check, only to find her still fast asleep, undisturbed. My stomach dropped so hard I scooped her up and kept her with me until my mom came home. At fourteen, the dreams started. For one solid week, seven nights in a row I had the same dream with the same plot: someone breaking into our house and murdering my entire family, always saving me for last. Each night the killer’s face changed my mother one night, my stepdad the next, then my siblings but the storyline never shifted. On the final night, the dream reached its peak horror: I was in the bathtub when I was stabbed again and again, feeling each slice as if it were real, the water around me going cold and pink. I even felt the moment my head was cut from my body, my vision slipping underwater as I drowned in the dark. 

Years later, when I was eighteen, I moved into my sister’s old basement room, and that’s when things became impossible to ignore. During finals week, I was exhausted, sleep-deprived, and every night I heard scratching inside the walls followed by heavy thuds above me, as if someone were pacing just past the ceiling. I tried to tell myself it was mice, or my family moving around, but then one morning, while I was changing, something cold brushed against my bare skin. It felt exactly like fingertips. I spun around, but no one was there. The air just hung heavy, icy against my body. That same week, I dreamt my dad died, and on that particular morning, something happened that I’ll never forget. As I began to wake, before my eyes had even opened, I felt a presence close beside me. Then, clear as if someone were leaning over my bed, a voice whispered directly into my ear: *“What happened?”* The words were so soft that I felt the warmth of the breath brush across my skin. My whole body jolted upright, still half tangled in my sheets, and my eyes snapped to the crack under my door. Shadows were moving back and forth, shifting in that unmistakable way of someone pacing just on the other side. My first thought was relief, it had to be my family. But when I yanked the door open, the hallway stretched out silent and empty. The house was still. No one was home.

But the worst encounter I ever had in that house happened when I was about sixteen. My parents had argued that night, so my stepdad was sleeping in the living room while my mom stayed in her room, and I was in my bedroom, the one directly above the stairs, watching YouTube late into the night. That’s when I started hearing it; the sound of the basement doors opening and closing, slow and deliberate, followed by footsteps pacing back and forth. At first I thought it was him, restless after the fight, but then I realized I could hear his heavy snoring from the living room. The footsteps grew louder, climbing the basement stairs, each step drawn out with a pause in between, as if whoever or whatever it was wanted me to hear. My chest tightened as the steps moved through the house until they reached the living room. And then, cutting through the silence, came a scream. My stepdad’s scream. Frantic footsteps thundered back down into the basement, ending with a slam so violent it rattled the walls. My whole body went numb. Later, when he told me what had happened, my heart dropped into my stomach. He said he had woken up to find a woman standing over him, gently stroking his face. His scream had made her vanish back into the basement. But the part that haunts me most is that the basement door at the top of the stairs never opened. We would have heard it. We always heard it. So how had she gotten past it?
