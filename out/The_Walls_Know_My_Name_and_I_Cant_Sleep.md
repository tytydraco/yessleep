I could just be paranoid writing this—before going out to the cabin my ex boyfriend bought me a book on bear attacks. I think the title was just *Grizzly Ends.* I don’t think he intentionally wanted to scare me with it; don’t think he even knew about the trip. If anyone, it’s my fault for actually reading it. The first few chapters covered incidents where a young bear was taken from the wilderness and treated as a pet. It was only when the bears got older that they turned on their owners. Owners who, in many cases, saw it like their own child. As the title suggests, each scenario described the eventual attack in grizzly detail. The puncturing of eyes, tearing of face, bloody maulings, the book never shied from delivering every detail. The end of each chapter emphasized the strength of bears and warned not to underestimate them. Now I’m alone in the dark. Terrified to make a sound, or even breathe too loudly. Outside it’s cloudy tonight so all the stars are hidden. It’s mostly quiet. I can hear the whining wind against the old log walls but that’s all. Naturally I know it’s partly the book that has me so on edge. That being said, input from anyone willing to help will be appreciated. I don’t think I’m completely imagining the scraping in the walls. 



To start off I guess I should introduce myself and my siblings. My sisters are Edith, 15 and Joelaine, 20. I’m the oldest, 23. My name’s Beatrice. The three of us are staying in my uncle’s cabin; he was kind enough to let us stay here over the weekend. 



The GPS stopped working on the way over here. The cabin’s isolated, about a half hour drive away from Kamloops (a city in BC, Canada), so none of us had any service. Luckily we still had a rough idea of where it was located. Both Joelaine and I remembered visiting it with the family. Edith had been too young to remember. 



It was Joelaine who spotted it first. “There,” she said, pointing. I turned down onto the gravel road and gripped the steering wheel a bit more tightly. Vibrations rattled the truck as I continued on and made the final turn up to the large cabin. The only other man-made structure I could see was another building about 30 yards from the cabin. Its white walls were stained with grime. It looked almost like a chapel with a slanted brown roof. At the tallest point was a single window, glowing with yellow light. I only mention it because of the nagging suspicion I had of being watched as I looked up at it through the windshield. 



The smell of cedar was almost claustrophobic as I stepped out of the truck. I remembered the area being more open. I noticed Joelaine wrinkle her nose as she took a few tentative steps towards our cabin. Tall brush and grasses made the walkway cramped up to the doorway. 



“Whoa, yeah I don’t remember any of this,” Edith said, lowering her phone. She pushed her way out from under the mountain of blankets piled in the back seat and stepped down onto the gravel path. “They do have wifi here, right?” 



“We’ll have to see,” I said, “but let’s get all our stuff inside first.” …that didn’t last long. After the first few bags had been brought in, I found myself on my own bringing in the rest of the stuff. Edith wanted to explore the house and she dragged Joelaine along with her. I heard them giggling down in the basement as I continued making trips to and from the truck. I guess I didn’t really mind. It was nice to hear them having a good time, especially Edith. That being said, I was exhausted by the time the truck was empty. 



I packed a lot of food for this trip. We’re just staying 5 days (Friday today), but I’d brought extra snacks. Luckily, the kitchen had a refrigerator which seemed to be working fine. My eyes widened in alarm just as I set the cooler down on the counter. There were rat droppings everywhere all along the milky grey surface. *Should have expected it,* I thought, *the house has been empty for over a year now.* I wiped it off the counter using a kleenex and threw it in the bin.



With everything put away I could finally explore the cabin. To the left of the front entrance was an elaborate fireplace of red brick. A ring of stone floor was around it and an ax was leaning against a heap of dusty wood. 



I immediately noticed the hunting gear seemingly everywhere. There is a gun in the kitchen. Many deer antlers had been hung up along the walls. There were also pelts lying like mats over the floorboards. I felt my heart beat faster as I noticed a bear skin at the base of the stairs. Its head was still intact, staring towards the door with an open maw. Its claws were still gleaming like black razors on each paw.



“Aren’t we going to have something for dinner?” Edith asked rounding the corner. I’ll admit I jumped at her sudden appearance. 



“I thought what we had on the drive would be enough,” I told her. She scowled, trodding across the bear skin to go upstairs. It might sound silly, but I stepped around it, jumping over the back edge to get to the steps. I looked over my shoulder as I went up. Something about that bear just really creeped me out. Skinned animals in general have always unsettled me—I can’t look at them without imagining the process. Of it being peeled off skin and muscle. It’s a gruesome image in my head. 



(Not sure if sharing pictures work here but I drew a map of the cabin. It might be helpful later on in the story.

There are two rooms in the cabin, each with a single bed. They were too small for the three of us, so I ended up on my own. I’ll fast forward a bit to when it was dark out. My sisters both went to their room for the night. The sounds of them giggling fluttered sporadically. 



I packed a white nightdress for tonight. It’s covered in a pattern of vibrant strawberries. After getting changed, I ended up staying up late reading, long after the voices in the other room went quiet. A few more chapters of the same book I mentioned. It’s sitting next to my knee now. The cover’s pretty horrifying, especially since the scratching at the door has gone quiet… alone with just my thoughts. It’s a glossy cover with teeth that stick out a bit from the surface. Its mouth is wide open, nose pointing straight up with the white of its eyes showing. There’s something in its mouth, though I couldn’t tell you what it’s supposed to be. Maybe a salmon, or a part of some other animal.



I needed to go downstairs to take off my makeup. That’s when it all really happened. I guess part of the reason I waited so long was because I was already feeling nervous. Putting it off definitely didn’t help. I have only myself to blame. Anyway, I was a bit at ease hearing Joelaine’s snoring as I stepped out into the hall. Our family has always joked about how loud she can get. Sounds like a gas lawnmower trying to start. I don’t know how Edith managed to sleep with it. I’d gladly trade places. Maybe she can be the one with her own room tomorrow night. 



I crept past their room and down the stairs, heart pumping rapidly in my chest. I kept telling myself it was alright, that it was just me awake. I held my wrist in my hand as I went, tightening my grip at every little sound. I remember the feeling of the smooth floor against my sock as I stepped down the last step. I felt like I was hyper alert at that moment, aware of everything around me. Sitting here now I feel so stupid. 



Inching my way past the fireplace I turned down the hallway and into the bathroom. It was a long hallway. Halfway down I heard a sound. A grinding noise behind me like a baseball rolling over cement. I ran the final steps and sighed with relief as I closed the door behind me. *Rats in the walls,* I told myself, spotting the mousetrap behind the toilet. *Guess my uncle already knows about it.* I washed my face with cold water, taking off my makeup. There was a small cubby there where the three of us stashed our makeup bags. Me and Joelaine at least, I think Edith forgot hers. I noticed a few of my wipes had already been used. 



Leaving the bathroom everything was fine. When I got to the stairs, that’s when it hit me, one foot on the carpeted stair, the other on the smooth wooden floor. Wasn’t there bear skin here? I braced my arm against the wall, heart beating ever faster. I felt dizzy, almost like I’d pass out. What explanation was there? Could something be in the house? 



Back home our family had an orange cat named Kiki. I always recognised the sound of her running up the stairs. The thud of the front legs, followed by the back as she bounded upwards. The sound charging up from the basement then was similar, only I could hear it was a much larger animal. 



My body reacted as my mind registered the approach. I ran like a scared deer. Up the stairs I went, clenching the banister to pull myself to the summit. The galloping claws were behind me. They paused for a moment when I started. I’m sure it hadn't noticed me at first or else now I’d be in its grasp. I could feel how large it was as it followed behind, bumping the walls with its weight. 



I made it to my room and slammed the door, pulling the lock in place in a fluid motion. The thing must have been a hair behind. Its weight slammed the door, and I was nearly certain it would break.



I could just stand there petrified, listening to the bending of the door’s wooden planks. I backed up with my arm behind, finding the rim of my bed and slumping down onto it. I can only guess what the intruder was. If it was a bear in the house… I don’t know if anyone’s seen the videos online of them climbing trees. They can bound up in an instant, or jump from one and scale up another. It’s terrifying how fast they are. That combined with the stories from this book… for a half hour after I heard its scraping claws. The scratching continued along the wall next. There was a crack, then the sound changed, closer as if a paw had found its way between the panels. It was breaking through. But then it was just silent. 



The final sound still has me terrified. I never would have answered, I know it wasn’t him. I swear I heard a voice. It knew my name. “Beatrice,” it called to me, the sound coming from where the scratching had ceased… and it was my uncle’s voice. A bit gruff with an air of impatience. Whatever it was, it only said my name once. It’s been quiet since then. It’s possible I imagined being chased but the scratching on the door felt very real. I don’t think it was my uncle. 



I can’t sleep. Service here is spotty but I’ll be reading any responses this gets.



Thank you, 

Beatrice.
