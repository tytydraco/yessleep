My story dates back to 2015-16, when I was in the 6th or 7th grade. This happened in a hospital. My granny has been diabetic my whole life. She’s been on medication since forever. one day, we got a call, she was in the hospital. Her kidneys were giving her trouble, and she needed to start insulin. Thankfully, we could avoid dialysis for now, but insulin meant that she was only getting worse. She was the only grandmother I had, and with god’s grace to this day, still do. She is my mom’s mother, my dad’s mother passed away when I was five (this is important for the story). I needed to see her. I knew she had to see me too. I knew me being there would make me better.

 

During my summer vacation, which was June to august, I went to see her. I arrived at the hospital she was admitted at. I didn’t go to my home country frequently. it was barely twice a year, so I did not know my way around there. I was staying at the hospital for the night. I am someone who loves the paranormal. I love ghost stories, horror stories, serial killers, and all the jazz. So that one night, when I was unable to sleep, I decided to try out the Korean elevator game. I will explain the game as I go about what I did that night. The events started around 2am that night. 

 

For the game you need a building with at least 10 floors. I found a door and went ahead. this area had absolutely no one near it. it was a working hospital for god’s sake, why was it so empty? nonetheless, I saw an elevator, and went towards it. now I had to get into the elevator and press a bunch of buttons as follows; click the buttons for the 4th, 2nd, 6th, and 10th floor, but do not get out any of these floors, or else you have to go to the ground floor and restart.

 

Then you have to go to the 5th floor where you’ll find a woman. ignore her at all costs. she is here to take you to the otherworld forever. no matter what she does, ignore her. she may look familiar to you, and for me she was so similar to me at the time best friend. she even smelt like her. the same perfume, the same shampoo, hell, the same voice. it was very creepy, and I almost gave in. the woman came into the elevator with me and tried to talk to me, but I avoided her at all costs. it was a matter of life and death after all.

 

then press the button for the 1st floor. if the elevator actually goes to the first floor, something is wrong, please run out of there and go to a safe place, DO NOT AT ANY COST try it again, your life is in danger. but if instead, you go to the 10th floor instead of 1st, you have reached the other world. some signs of the otherworld would be that the moon is red in color, and I think the cross would be upside down. I’m not sure about that detail but I know about the red moon. And when the doors opened, I was on the 10th floor. I had made it to the otherworld, and the moon was red. the entire place was red. I was in the hospital, but instead of normal white lights, they were red. the woman was still in the elevator, but I exited. 

 

suddenly I heard, and saw someone very familiar. my dead grandmother. my dad’s mother. I hadn’t heard her in years, almost forgot her voice, but I was so glad to see her. she told me I am in so much trouble. I didn’t know what she was talking about. she dragged me to the nearest fire exit and pulled ,e down the stairs. for some reason when I went down one flight of stairs it said 16th floor. for some reason I was on the 17th floor, not the 10th. she continued to drag me down the stairs while the stairs behind me were collapsing, and I heard growling coming from above. when she was dragging me down the stairs, I only heard her say one more thing to me. "Zozo is after you." That scared me, because Zozo is considered to be one of Satan’s worst and most nightmarish angels. one who's name shouldn’t be taken, just for the fuck of it.

 

She kept pulling me down what seemed like an infinite loop of stairs, and finally came the exit door. she pushed me out the door and I went out, leaving her behind, having spent only a few minutes with my dead grandmother. I lay against the exit door thinking about everything when a nurse spotted me. She told me that my whole family was searching for me for so long.  So long? when I checked the time it was 11:30 am. I thought this was a were minutes, maybe 30 minutes maximum, but I had been missing for 9 whole hours? When the same nurse asked me what I was doing on this side of the hospital, I turned toward the door to tell her I was there. This was when she told me that side of the hospital had been closed for almost 7 years now, and when I looked at the exit door, there was a huge padlock with chains that couldn’t open even if I tried. this was the very door my grandmother pushed me through. every time I look back and think of this, I get chills, and it leaves me more confused than ever.

 

Guys, please never try this game please. I love everything horror, but the marks on my wrist from my grandmother pulling me, and some scratches on my back that I can only describe as nails I have never seen before, please don’t try this. I have never told a family member about this, and I hope I never have to.
