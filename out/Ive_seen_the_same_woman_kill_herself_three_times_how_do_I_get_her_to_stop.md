Hello Reddit!

Not sure if this is the right sub to be asking about paranormal stuff.I think it's paranormal anyway. But if anyones an expert on ghosts, demons or even something dumb like creepy pastas, please feel free to take a swing at my problem.

Now about that problem, it’s as simple as it sounds.

About four months ago, I was walking home from college to my bus station. Listening to Lady Gaga and drinking a Pepsi max. I was tired -  having to deal with my bum of a professor for the last 4 days in a row so I was looking forward to the mildly comfy chairs of the old bus.

I got to the station and waited for a long ass time before the bus finally arrived. I sat down at the very back on the left side and almost immediately drifted to sleep, Gaga being my only line of defence from complete slumber. 

I then saw her, she was this sad, ragged looking girl. With baggy eyes and a saggy face she just stared off into nothing. To be completely honest she was pretty similar looking to me, it was like looking at a version of me that had died and come back to life. She even had my same beautiful curly hair. She was sweating, I could see the large and thick droplets of sweat running down her face, clinging to the edge of her chin and her nose. Her hands were buried in her pockets of her hoodie and shivered relentlessly. 

I was admittedly very uncomfortable at the sight, who wouldn’t be? So I made an admittedly idiotic mistake. 

I spoke to her.



“Are you ok?” I said removing my head phones and leaning in a little closer. Her spacy gaze quickly shifted to an intent stace at me, the quick snapping of her neck to face me made me jump back a little bit. Her face was angry, more angry than I thought was possible. It was like every level of hell was condensed into a single person and it was being directed to me. I pushed back against the bus window, as if I was trying to somehow move through the glass like a ghost.

And then in one swift motion, she pulled out a short silver revolver, jammed it in her mouth and pulled the trigger.

The thick cloud of red mist erupted from her skull, her eyes quickly lost all soul that was behind them as her corpse fell to the side, brain matter, bone, skin, it was all leaking together into mush.

The police got involved, I had to double up on therapy and the general public just wrote what happened off as “just a random crazy who killed herself.”

I honestly don’t remember much from the rest of the day, I was trying everything I could to just rationalise what I saw. Took me about one and a half months before I felt likeI could function again.

But, like a horrid twist of fate, that wasn’t the last time I saw her. 



After 2 months of the first suicide , it was like déjà vu. It was the same Gaga song, the same drink and the same day. As I got on the bus that day I felt another impossible sense of dread. I was scared she’d come back. And she did, she got onto the bus and sat in her same seat. But instead of talking to her, she spoke to me this time. 

“Why, why is this my fault?” She said, looking as if she was staring over my shoulder, staring at nothing. 

“What?” I asked her.

“Why do you hate me?” She continued.

Just as I was about to get another word in, she pulled out the revolver. I think you know the rest.



I didn’t take the bus the next time. I instead chose to walk 3 whole hours just to get home. It was better than risking seeing her again. But I was stupid to think the bus was the problem. It was like she was waiting for me this time. I rounded a corner to an empty street and she was standing before me, presenting herself with the gun already in her mouth. And again I think you know the rest.

The police were interested and very suspicious about me. I mean I don’t blame them, 3 girls who look the same all killing themselves in front of me in the span of 3 months. But, that quickly died down as I had literally no connection with her besides looking similar. The girl herself had nothing about her, no name, no family, it was like she was never real to begin with.



So Reddit. How do I make this stop? I know it won’t be the last I see of her unless I do something about it. Any kinds of things I can do to dispel curses or evil spirits? Literally anything would help. I’m not crazy, but what else do you do in a situation like this?
