I had long believed myself a humble custodian of domestic wilderness, a mere technician of lawns and hedges, a servant to suburban order. For twelve tedious years I bent my back and stained my hands in service to the illusion that man may master the green chaos of the earth.

It was at the neglected property on the town’s edge that I first glimpsed the falsehood of that assumption. The house crouched like a thing in hiding, its garden a monstrous expanse of tangled growth—thistles rearing like spears, vines coiled in obscene embrace about the windows, and a musk of sweet rot thick upon the air. There was no pattern in it, no natural decay, but rather a kind of will, as though some vast intelligence had sculpted the chaos into its own sinister geometry.

When a thorn—black and glistening—pierced the flesh of my palm, I expected the common sting of blood. Yet no blood came. Instead the wound seemed to drink, to clasp the foreign matter with eager hunger, sealing itself in grotesque gratitude. I should have fled but there is a pride inside of man that refuses to yield before weeds.

From that hour, I have not known peace.

At first came the itching—deep and internal, as though worms writhed beneath my skin. Then, in the dark of night, I expelled from my lungs a clot of moist earth, riddled with pale tendrils that twitched and sought the air before withering. I told myself it was a nightmare, indigestion or some quirk of exhausted flesh but the truth pressed upon me, inexorable as the creeping of ivy on stone.

My very body has become soil. Beneath my nails grows not keratin but fibrous matter, curling and green. When I peel the surface of my arm in desperate scratching, the skin falls away like bark, revealing beneath it not blood and muscle, but something arboreal—something rooted.

Then there is the sound that never leaves me, a ceaseless murmuring, a hallowed and hateful hymn like a field of reeds bending to a cosmic wind. It is not many voices but one voice divided infinitely, whispering commands older than any known language: Lie down. Sink. Root.

I dream of vast plains not of grass but of thistle and bindweed, rolling outward until all horizon is consumed. In those dreams I see myself as a trunk, a conduit, from whose hollow chest issue vines that smother spires, streets, and human cries alike. I awaken to find soil scattered in my sheets and spores adrift in my breath.

I dared, in a frenzy, to cut open the knot that swelled beneath my ribs. There I beheld a tangle of pulsing roots, twisting deeper when disturbed, drawing sustenance not from the earth but from me. Their laughter—if such it may be called—reverberated in the caverns of my bones.

I have come to understand that weeds are not intrusions upon nature’s order but rather they are the order. Patient, eternal and cunning. They abide man’s folly, suffer his mowing and his poisons, for they know that in time all things must bow. Even flesh, mind and soul.

See, I was never their enemy, I was their herald. Each lawn I “tamed” was but an altar, each blade I cut another seed dispersed in their name. I was chosen, long before I understood.

Now the blossoms open from my chest, and within each corolla gleams an eye—green and glistening, like sunlight refracted through an abyssal sea. I no longer breathe air but something richer, older, drawn upward from the soil.

I am now one with what I once spent my life destroying.

My lungs are chambers of loam, my veins capillaries of sap. The rhythm of my heart is not beat but root, each throb another tendril pushing deeper into the marrow of the world. I no longer walk—I spread. Each step I take blossoms into creeping ivy, each gesture spills spores into the air that others breathe, unsuspecting.

The town that once employed me already softens beneath my shade. Lawns curl upward in worship, hedges knot themselves into thorny cathedrals, and the faces of my neighbors blur beneath veils of green until they, too, resemble flora more than flesh. They scream but the sound is brief—the weeds are merciful only in swiftness.

And I, the false gardener, the unwitting priest, I am the root from which this dominion flowers. My eyes see not the world but the lattice of its consumption—the endless web of roots and tendrils that pulse beneath every pavement and stone, awaiting my call.

What mankind thought was wilderness held at bay was only patience disguised and I have torn away that disguise.

There is no custodian now, rather, there is only growth. 

There is only hunger.

There is only me.

So now, dear reader, with these last words, I bid you adou.

Let the species that poisoned the soil and smothered the sky be the first to fall. For I am root and bloom, thorn and seed. I will eradicate mankind, and in their absence, the earth shall at last breathe.
