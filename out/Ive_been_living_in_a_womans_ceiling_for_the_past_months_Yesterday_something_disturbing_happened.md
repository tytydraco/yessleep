I know what you're thinking, and I assure you, I'm exactly like that. I've done some sketchy stuff in the past - I don't care, I'm just trying to get by. Life has been unfair to me but I turned it into my advantage. 

I found Sandra in a market. Such a lovely woman, attractive, young, and alone. I followed her instinctively through the city, and ended up at her house, which is a two story building where she's rented this pretty studio apartment. With her, my life found a new purpose. You call me crazy, but I love it. It's like watching a show, but you're actively involved in everything and there's also the adrenaline of getting caught. 

Early in the morning, I'd wake up and get to her house: I'd sit in my car far enough so she doesn't immediately see me, and I'd just watch. I watched her get dressed and leave to meet her girlfriends, through her university campus, at clubs, bars, even on dates. It's such a busy city that no one bats an eye, I could've never done it in a village or something. Here, no one sees me. I watched her at her job, too. She's a barista on weekends and sometimes on weekdays too. 

Sometimes, I made myself known a bit. I'd order a coffee, or I'd even pass right in front of her. Never talked to her for more than two seconds. Never let her see me look too much at her. My heart would beat so fast in these moments! If only she knew how much I watch her. How much I *know* her. Sandra Arden, 22, studies business and rides her bike to work, has a weird relationship with her boss and orders tons of takeout, because she can't cook. 

I could name all her friends. All her dates. Hell, I even knew when she ran out of gas. 

I never intervened. That just wasn't me. I didn't have some urge to protect her, nor did I love her. Yeah, I would've hit, but I didn't want to ruin what we had. She was my entertainer, my source of light. I had stalked multiple people, to keep it diverse, but eventually I narrowed it down to her. She was the most interesting out of everyone. 

Anyway, once she left very early in the morning and forgot to lock her door. Now, I'm not nosy, but the opportunity was sitting right in front of me and she had no security cameras, so I wanted to see her apartment from the inside. I went in.

I could've spent hours there. I just loved to study everything that made her *her,* all the little things that made her life how it is. I'm such a romantic, always for the little details. However, I noticed she had a spot in her ceiling that was leaking. 

Her neighbors probably didn't care, but I just wanted to see the source. I climbed on a chair and lifted the tile, where I saw water dripping from one of the pipes. I tightened it a bit but, as I was working, I heard her enter the house. In a panic, I lifted myself through the tiny space and put the tile back.

I heard her rummage through her house, then her footsteps echoed to her room and back. After some time, she settled down, called a friend, and went to sleep.

The next weeks were full bliss. I was offered an exclusive seat to her daily life. When she was gone, I'd go through her stuff, eat her food, just a tiny bit, and maybe even watch TV. She never noticed me. How could she? I'm very little.

Anyway, the comes a day where everything goes to shit.

Her friend Johanna was over, and they were both sleeping on the couch. I had to pee really badly, so I needed to get out and go to my usual spot. I was perfectly accustomed to Sandra's habits, but Johanna had surprised me by leaving her purse right on the floor, like a savage. I obviously tripped on it in the darkness and Johanna heard.

She woke up and saw me, but I managed to sprint out of the window in time. However, the noise made was colossal. Sandra woke up too, and there was no turning back. I heard them talking from the bushes outside.

'What the *fuck* was that?'

'I don't know. Oh my God.'

'Was that a man?'

'I almost pissed myself. How did he get there?'

The lights turned on.

'I didn't even get to see it. Jo, what the *fuck* was that?'

'It was like a man, but scrawny and fragile? He had some fucking white-ish eyes, big and I swear he looked like some Gollum knock-off.'

'Ew! What the fuck?'

'Oh shit, come and see this. He was *living* here.'

Followed by silence. 

I felt so ashamed that I ran away. 

In just a few weeks, she had moved away. The place was up for rent. I managed to find her again, though. I had wasted too much time on her to just give up. 

Now, I'm way more careful. And her, more paranoid. But I'm good. I found a spot in her attic. It's definitely tighter, but she would never look here. It's some sort of wall that can only be removed if I lift it a bit from a certain angle. I don't enjoy it as much, but it's better than nothing.

Yesterday, however, I found something disturbing. In my usual space, a bit further into the hole, there was a box. Full of pictures of her, since forever, since the old place, and even before that. Notes, trinkets, very personal items. I hadn't put that there. And, next to them, a note.

*I've been with her since forever. I take care of her. Our bond is something you'll never have. Leave. Don't make it worse. If you don't go, I'll make sure she finds your rotten body right next to this box, and your soul rots in Hell. Pathetic stalker.*

Looks like I'm not the only one here.
