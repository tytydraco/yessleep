Thump

Nick turned over in bed. Back to sleep.

Thump thump

It was probably nothing, he thought. He lay in his queen size bed and listened for more noise. Nothing. He started to doze off again.

Thump thump thump

Nick bolted wide awake. It was a new house. He had moved in a few weeks ago. He had heard a few creaks and groans before, but this was different. More rhythmic.

He wiped the sand from eyes and checked his phone for the time. 2:30 AM. He put his phone in his pocket and made for the bedroom door.

Thump thump thump

It was probably just an animal, he thought. He still had to check. A first time homebuyer at thirty-two years of age, he felt he needed to do the responsible thing. Probably a raccoon. Best case scenario he could scare it away. Worst case scenario, he’d be putting in a call to animal control and getting an extra cup of coffee before work in a few hours.

Nick made his way down the stairs and saw a faint red light in the kitchen. Did he leave his oven on?

He heard a shuffling and noticed a large amorphous shape had replaced his dining room table. He walked towards it, into the kitchen.

CLUNK

Bright searing lights turned on all over his kitchen and conjoined dining room right as he stepped through the threshold, as if he had stepped on a tripwire that activated them. His eyes took a second to adjust to the blinding brightness. He looked around where his dining room table had been, he saw two rows of people in theater-style seats facing the kitchen. He recognized all of them.

His third-grade teacher Mrs. Pemberton, the guy who cut him off in traffic last Tuesday, and someone who looked exactly like the stock photo model from his insurer’s website.

He saw his college roommate Chad, who still owed him $50 he borrowed and lost in a cryptocurrency pyramid scheme.

Even his great aunt Gertrude, sitting in the corner and crocheting a sweater that read “It’s Your Kitchen, Nick”.

“Wait, didn’t she die like 3 years ago?” Nick thought to himself.

They all watched him with an expectant look. The giant flood lights illuminated his kitchen, where he saw two podiums. One was empty, at the other was a middle aged man with a combover and too much bronzer in an electric blue tuxedo who held a long baton with a small sphere at its end. It was a microphone.

“What the hell! How did you people get-” Nick started.

“Hey Nick!” The man in the blue tuxedo interrupted. “I’m sure you’re wondering what we’re doing here, isn’t that right folks?”

A din of agreement and nods of varying enthusiasm came from the crowd that almost paradoxically fit inside his modestly sized dining room. One man, who Nick recognized as his car mechanic from back when he lived in Boston, shouted “That’s right!”.

“Well, Nick, my name is Chuck Bazzleton,” The man at the podium said, his voice booming over speakers Nick couldn’t find, “and we’re here too play…” Chuck smiled and pointed the mic at the crowd.

“IT’S! YOUR! KITCHEN!” The crowd roared in unison.

Nick looked around and felt a wave of vertigo.

How did these people get here? There was a production crew. A camera man. An “on air” sign glowed red where he had hung his NASA deep space photo calendar. After a moment, Nick’s awe and amusement turned to anger.

“No. No. I have work in the morning. I am calling the cops.” Nick said calmly.

A collective gasp from the crowd. Nick took his phone out of his pocket and dialed 911.

“Now, Nick, that isn’t very sportsmanlike of you” Chuck crooned. “What do we think of that folks?”

The crowd booed and a few showed their thumbs down for Nick.

“Why don’t you just be a good sport and play the game, Nick?” Chuck added as Nick waited for the call to connect. Nick heard a momentary dial tone.

“911 What’s your emergency?” The operator asked.

“Yes I’m at 121 Chestnut street, and people have broken into my home.” Nick answered calmly, a smirk growing on his face.

“Just play the game, Nick” the operator said calmly before hanging up.

“Wait! What? Hello?” Nick exclaimed into the phone, as he looked around the room.

“You heard what the nice dispatcher said, Nick” said Chuck Bazzleton. He patted his hand on the empty podium. “Why don’t you just come over here and play. The prize tonight is-”

“No. No!” Nick interrupted. “So you have someone on the inside. I don’t care. I know where the police station is. I’ll just drive over there and tell them”.

“I wouldn’t recommend that, Nick.” Chuck said, his voice growing a bit more hostile. “Hey folks, what do we call a contestant that doesn’t want to play?”

“LOSER!” The crowd said in Unison.

Nick put on his shoes and grabbed his car keys. He opened his front door, but instead of seeing his quiet suburban street, the front door opened up into, his kitchen.

Nick ran to the back door. Before he opened it, he had a feeling he knew what he would see on the other side of the door.

When Nick opened the door, he didn’t see his backyard. He saw exactly what he had seen out the front door.

He felt a dark and foreboding dread build in his gut. He turned back to his kitchen and looked at the empty podium. Chuck and the crowd looked at him longingly. Chuck motioned for Nick to come on stage.

“What is it we say folks?” Chuck said, holding back laughter and pointing his microphone to the crowd.

“IT’S! YOUR! KITCHEN!” The crowd cheered.

“That’s right.” Chuck said through eerily white teeth “And that’s all there is!”

Nick walked back to the kitchen. He saw they had moved his trash can to make room for the two podiums. He stood behind the podium and looked back at the crowd, dejected. Chuck beamed at Nick as cheesy game show music played from the speakers Nick still couldn’t find.

“So glad to have you here Nick. Now tell us, where do you hail from?” Chuck asked.

Nick was incredulous.

“Here. I come from right here. We’re in my house.” Nick said waving his hands around at, well, everything.

“That’s right! We’re in your home! 121 Chestnut, isn’t that right folks?” Chuck exclaimed. “Or it wouldn’t be” He turned the mic to the crowd as Nick closed his eyes in despair.

“IT’S ! YOUR! KITCHEN!” The crowd boomed.

Eyes closed, Nick began to whisper to himself “This isn’t real. This is a dream. Just wake up Nick. It was probably those noodles”.

“Nick, I assure you this IS real” Chuck said. “It has nothing to do with those nine-day-old noodles you had for lunch the other day. Now are you ready to play the game?”

“Sure” Nick said with a resigned shrug.

The crowd cheered.

The lights felt hot on Nick’s skin as Chuck took out some cue cards.

“Ok Nick we’re ready to start playing.” Chuck said as he looked down at the first cue card. “What… is your biggest regret?”

As soon as Chuck had asked, all of the lights, save the spotlight trained on Nick, dimmed. Chuck shoved the microphone in Nick’s face.

“Is this hell?” Nick asked.

The crowd erupted into raucous laughter, and Chuck brought the microphone back to his own face.

“Well that’s not the answer is it folks?” Chuck asked.

“NO!” The crowd sang.

“Now let’s try this again.” Chuck said, the grin widening on his face. “What is your biggest regret?”

“I don’t know.” Nick started. The crowd began to boo. “Ok let me think! Let me think. My biggest regret was probably… Not getting my masters in engineering”.

A loud siren rang as soon as Nick was done talking.

“That is incorrect!” Chuck said with a mischievous grin. “Your biggest regret was breaking up with Janice. She was such a nice girl, you really could have made a life with her.”

“Wait what? How do you know what my-“ Nick started.

“Alright folks,” Chuck interrupted “that was round one, now it’s time for a word from our sponsors”. He smiled into the camera and froze for a moment as the cheesy theme music played again. The lights dimmed, and a serious voice came from everywhere and nowhere.

“Alright people! That’s commercial, we’re back in five.”

In an instant, there were two people standing on either side of Chuck Bazzleton. One patted his face and seemed to be applying makeup while the other handed him a bottle of water. The water had a label that just said “It’s Your Kitchen” in plain black text over a white background.

After the makeup artist and assistant walked off to god knows where, Bazzleton turned to Nick, his voice gravelly, his smile more subdued. “You’re doing great kid. The camera loves you.”

“What the hell is going on! How do you know my biggest regret? Why can’t I leave?” Nick exclaimed.

Chuck turned to the crowd, pointed a thumb at Nick and asked “How about those first timer jitters, folks? Huh?” With a chuckle.

Nick heard a voice he recognized from the crowd. It was his former employer from the power plant, Mike Schmidt, “Just play the game Nick! Don’t overthink it!”

Nick took his phone out of his pocket and attempted to call his dad.

“You really think that’s gonna do anything?” Chuck said with a sneer.

The phone started to ring before blinking an “out of service” message. Nick tried to call again, but the phone ran out of battery. He had been charging it next to his bed all night.

“How is this possible? Why are you here?” Nick screamed. The crowd seemed unfazed. He took a soup ladle off of his counter and started destroying the podium. He must have hit it a dozen times, the cheap fiberboard coming apart. He struck the lights, shouting like a feral animal. He had destroyed two of them and began laughing maniacally.

“Whose… kitchen… is it… Now!” He exclaimed as he destroyed the set, the crowd now looking on with mild interest and disapproval. He pointed the ladle out to the crowd. “And why is my great aunt here? What the FUCK is that?” He shouted. Gertrude didn’t even look up from her crocheting.

He turned back to Chuck Bazzleton and looked down and to his right. The podium he had just destroyed stood there with no visible sign of damage. The lights were on again, not a scratch to be seen.

He pointed the ladle at Chuck Bazzleton’s face, and shouted at the top of his lungs “WHAT IN THE FUCK IS GOING ON?”

Chuck, completely unmoved by Nick’s outburst, shrugged, lean forward, and said “I don’t know, kid. It’s just another gig for me.”

Nick gripped the large metal ladle in both hands like a baseball bat and hit Chuck square in the jaw.

The man went down like a sack of potatoes. Blood pooled on the floor as Nick looked down. He heard the clunk of the spotlight turning back on and felt the heat on his neck.

The voice came again. It wasn’t from the speakers. It almost seemed to come from earbuds in Nick’s ears. But he wasn’t wearing earbuds.

“Alright folks and were back in five, four, three…”

Nick saw the camera man count two and one with his hand. Nick turned around to see Chuck Bazzleton, completely unscathed, standing at his podium smiling his irritatingly charming grin.

The theme music played.

“Alright folks, welcome back, were here with Nick tonight, and it’s time to play…”

He pointed the mic at the crowd.
