When we first arrived, Cathy called the house a dream come true. I had my doubts. I wasn’t so sure.

It was a building of medium size, perched at the edge of a sprawling meadow that stretched lazily toward a glistening lake.

On one side, a dense wall of trees loomed—their thick trunks and tangled branches woven so tightly they blocked out almost all light, forming a natural barrier from the outside world.

On the other end, the nearest neighbors were miles away, making it feel as though we had stepped into our own secluded little world.

Our 7 year-old son, George, lit up the moment he spotted a row of wooden swings in the neatly manicured garden beside the house. Without a word, he took off running, his laughter ringing across the open space like wind chimes.

At first glance, everything looked perfect. The house was old, but recently restored. Its weathered stone façade had been brought back to life, and tall bay windows bathed the interior in golden afternoon light.

The floors gleamed with fresh polish, the walls wore crisp coats of paint, and the faint scent of sawdust and varnish still lingered—a quiet reminder of the work that had gone into reviving it.

Meanwhile, our one-year-old daughter, Justine, remained in Cathy’s arms, her tiny hands gripping her mother’s shirt as she gazed up at the high ceiling in open-mouthed wonder.

Cathy turned to me with a knowing smile, as if to say, *You’re not going to pass this up, are you?*

I simply shrugged and smiled awkwardly. The decision had already been made.

A few days ago, I had received a call from an employment agency—completely out of the blue. They were looking for a family to immediately move into a mansion on the outskirts of town and act as its caretakers, which included housekeeping and basic upkeep.

The pay was more than double what I’d earned at my last job. And for someone who had been laid off and searching for work for weeks, it felt like a miracle.

But something about the whole deal unsettled me. In all this time, I had never spoken to a single person associated with the house—no owner, no previous staff, no groundskeeper.

The only person I ever dealt with was a lawyer who showed up at my doorstep, had me sign a five-year contract… and then vanished, never to be heard from again.

When I arrived at the address, the agency had simply told me that the key would be placed under the welcome mat by the entrance. And sure enough, there it was.

The strangest part though?

The moment I agreed to take the job, my bank account was credited with a $25,000 signing bonus.

It all felt *too* easy. Too convenient.

But looking at Cathy and the kids, already settling in, I couldn’t back track. Not when I had no other offers.

The house in itself was well-furnished - an elegant blend of old-world charm and modern convenience.

A wall-mounted flat-screen TV hung in the main living room, but what caught my eye was the old teak radio set beside it—a relic from another time, with a large central dial worn smooth and a frayed, useless power cord trailing behind it.

I ran my hand over it, idly twisting the dial before setting it back. It looked more like a decorative piece than a working device—but something about it seemed off. It felt… misplaced.

The mansion had five bedrooms in total—four on the ground floor, and one upstairs, presumably the master suite. That room, with its two large doors, however, was locked tight.

Also next to the entrance of the master suite, stood a table, atop which rested a small, intricately carved ivory box.

I found it empty when I opened it. Only a faint trace of dust remained, just enough to suggest it had once held a key.

The agency had been clear: the master suite required no housekeeping, no maintenance. We were free to use the other rooms as we pleased, but that one was strictly off-limits.

When I asked why, the answer was brief and vague: *Just follow the terms of your contract.*

Setting aside my unease, Cathy and I spent the rest of the day unpacking, settling in, and trying to make the mansion feel like home.

George casually explored from room to room, taking in his new surroundings, while Justine clung to her mother, wide-eyed and quiet.

By the time we were done, our bodies ached with exhaustion. We sat down together and ate the sandwiches Cathy had packed that morning—simple, familiar, and oddly comforting after a tiring day.

Once the last crumbs were gone, we decided to call it a night. Cathy headed off to bed, while I lingered in the hall for a quick smoke.

As I leaned back in my chair, George wandered over, holding something in his hand.

“My tooth fell out,” he mumbled, showing me the tiny incisor resting on his palm.

He parted his lips, and sure enough, there was a fresh gap where his tooth had been. He didn’t look too thrilled about it.

“Lost a tooth, huh, buddy?” I asked, managing a faint smile. “Did you make a wish for the tooth fairy?”

“No, Dad. My friend Charlotte says that’s silly. She told me there’s a better way,” he replied.

“Oh?” I raised a brow, half amused, half wary. “And what’s that?”

 “She says… if you bury your tooth in the soil,” George said, glancing toward the garden, “something better grows in its place.”

I let out a dry chuckle. “Your friend sounds like a smart lady. Alright, let’s give it a shot.”

Out in the garden, we stood in front of a tidy patch where carrots, bell peppers, tomatoes, and cucumbers were growing side by side.

George crouched down, dug a small hole with his fingers, muttered a little prayer under his breath, placed the tooth inside, and neatly covered it with dirt.

Back inside, I wished him goodnight and headed to my room—where the moment my head hit the pillow, the exhaustion finally caught up with me.

I was asleep before I knew it.

I don’t know what time it was when I woke up, but my eyes opened to a pitch-dark room, and for a moment, I wasn’t even sure what had stirred me—until, I heard it again.

A voice, crackling through the baby monitor.

*“Shh… don’t wake her. He’s still listening.”*

A cold shiver ran down my spine. I sat up slowly, my body tense, heart pounding in my ears.

For a split second, I was frozen, my mind trying to rationalize what I had just heard. *Maybe I misheard? Maybe it was some strange frequency interference?*

Then the baby monitor crackled again:

***“Her hands….. are so small. So soft…. so easy to hold.”***

I bolted out of bed and rushed to Justine’s room across the hall. My breath caught in my throat, but as I reached the crib, I let out a shaky sigh—she was fast asleep, her tiny chest rising and falling in a steady rhythm.

Swallowing my unease, I stepped into George’s room next. He was curled under the blankets, his small frame peaceful, undisturbed. Nothing seemed out of place.

I shook my head, forcing myself to finally breathe. *Just my imagination. Stress, maybe. I really need to get some sleep.*

But as I closed George’s door and turned back toward the hallway, a sharp knock echoed through the house.

It came from the front door.

I immediately stopped in my tracks. The sound wasn’t frantic, but it wasn’t hesitant either—just a steady, deliberate knock.

Three beats. A pause. Then three more.

My pulse quickened. *Who the hell would be knocking at this hour?*

Cautiously, I made my way toward the front hall.

With every step, the air felt heavier, the silence of the house pressing in like a weight. I tried to peer through the windows flanking the door, but a thick mist had settled across the glass, distorting everything from the outside.

Another knock.

I hesitated, my fingers hovering just above the doorknob. The knocking continued at intermittent interval - never urgent, never stopping.

Taking a deep breath, I unlocked the door— and pulled it open.

Stepping onto the front porch, I was met with nothing but silence.

The night air was cool and damp, carrying the scent of pine and earth.

I scanned the empty steps, the gravel driveway beyond, the towering trees lining the property—nothing. No sign of anyone.

Then, my eyes drifted to the garden.

The swings.

A slow chill crawled up my spine. There were three of them, hanging side by side from the wooden frame. The two on either end were perfectly still, untouched by the breeze. But the middle swing… it was moving.

Not swaying gently, not rocking in place—but swinging.

Back and forth. Back and forth.

And steadily gaining momentum.

My breath hitched as I took a cautious step forward.

The swing cut through the air with an eerie smoothness, its arcs growing larger and larger, climbing higher with each pass.

 Soon, it was reaching the very top of its arc before reversing, soaring just as high on the other side.

And then—

It went completely over.

The swing looped around the top bar, the chains twisting unnaturally, suspending upside down for a fraction of a second.

That’s when I heard it.

A voice.

A gleeful, disembodied *“Woohoo!”*

The sound echoed through the empty garden, playful, almost taunting.

I stood frozen, my pulse hammering in my ears, watching as the swing completed its impossible loop and came back down. The seat thudded against the wooden frame, but even as it settled, it seemed poised to complete another unnatural rotation.

Before my mind could process what I had just witnessed, a voice from behind made me jolt.

*"What on earth are you doing out here at this hour, Tom?"*

I turned sharply to see Cathy standing in the doorway, her robe pulled tight against the night chill, eyes heavy with sleep.

Wordlessly, I pointed toward the swing, my breath still uneven. She followed my gaze, craning her neck to see. Then she turned back to me, brows furrowed.

*"See what?"*

I whipped my head back toward the garden—The swing was still. Perfectly still.

All three hung in quiet harmony, swaying only slightly in the faint breeze. No wild arcs, no impossible loops, no phantom laughter.

Cathy sighed, rubbing her arms against the cold. *"You're exhausted,"* she murmured, reaching for my arm. *"Come back inside before you freeze out here."*

I let her pull me back toward the house, while I continued to look over my shoulder.

As we stepped inside, I watched the door click shut behind me—and when I turned, Cathy was gone.

My heart skipped a beat as I stood alone in the hallway trying to retrace her movements, even though I hadn’t looked away for more than a second.

Our bedroom was at least 15 feet away, too far for her to disappear without a trace.

So I slowly walked towards our room and stopped by the open door only to find her fast asleep on her side of the bed and this made my stomach churn and twist in confusion.

Something really weird was going on here, and the silence pressing in around me only made my head throb.

That’s when I heard it again—a sudden burst of static ripping through the air, followed by a voice crackling from the old radio tucked away in the corner.

It was my little girl, Justine, breaking into a wail, her sobs echoing across the cold empty hall. And then I heard another voice, soft and syrupy, as if trying to pacify her, but something about the tone made my skin crawl.

"*There, there, little one… hush now,*" the voice cooed, the words dragging out in a slow, breathy lull.

*"You don’t want to wake up the whole house now,.. do you?"*

I didn’t even bother to turn back and look at the old radio set. Instead, my feet instantly dragged me forward again toward Justine’s room.

I reached the room—and froze. The crib was empty.

Heart pounding, I rushed in, scanning every inch. She was nowhere. The room was empty.

Justine’s cries still crackled from the old radio, but they sounded fainter now, distant and broken, like they were being pulled away.

Then came another sound, soft but distinct—footsteps—slow, steady and deliberate.

I stood rooted in the doorway, watching the empty space ahead. No one appeared.

Only the sound of invisible footsteps, climbing higher and higher up the wooden stairs.

With each step, the house grew quieter—Justine’s cries fading, the footsteps softening—until everything vanished into the darkness above, leaving me standing there, in stunned silence.

It took a few moments for the panic to loosen its grip. Then, clarity struck, and I bolted up the stairs.

When I reached the first floor, I noticed a faint sliver of light spilling from the narrow gap between the two doors of the room. But what truly caught my eye was the little ivory chest sitting on the side table, glowing with a faint green hue.

Drawn toward it, I slowly approached the chest and lifted the lid. Inside was an old, elongated key—ornate and heavy, clearly meant for the locked door ahead.

A warning flickered in my mind, urging me to stop. But all I could think of was Justine. I shoved the thought away, and picked up the key.

My hands trembled as I slid it into the lock, twisting until I heard the soft click.

I tightened my grip on the handle, exhaled slowly, and pushed the door open—
