When I was fifteen, my friends and I kind of naturally split into two groups. It wasn't intentional or dramatic—it just sort of happened.

On one side, there were the kids who stayed focused, did their homework, and basically stuck to what parents and teachers expected. They spent weekends studying, playing sports, or hanging out at someone’s house, staying away from trouble.

Then there was my group. We were different—not bad exactly, just less interested in rules. We liked parties, staying out late, and having new experiences. We tried stuff we probably shouldn't have, like sneaking cigarettes, drinking beers behind the school, and messing around with whatever seemed exciting at the time.

At fifteen, it just felt good to be free and careless, and we didn't think much about consequences.

By that point, I’d already experimented a bit with drugs, mostly just weed. It wasn't like we were heavy users or anything—we were just kids messing around, trying things out, seeing how far we could push things before they got serious.

But there was something else on my mind, something that seemed even bigger than anything else: I really wanted to have my first time. A few of my friends had already done it, and every time they talked about it, I felt this annoying sense of missing out.

Looking back, I couldn’t help but laugh at how important it seemed. But honestly, at fifteen, that's exactly how you think. You’d do almost anything to avoid feeling left behind or inexperienced, even if you weren't ready. It was stupid—but not completely unusual.

Back then, I used to hang out mostly with my friend Maxwell. For reasons none of us fully understood at the time, Maxwell lived completely alone. Some family issues had pushed him out on his own, and by the age of sixteen, he already had his own small apartment. It became our unofficial hangout spot, a place free of rules and parents, which was exactly what we were looking for.

Usually, it was just me, Maxwell, Bobby, and David—though we all called David "Fatty" since he was a bigger guy. Nobody really meant anything by it; the nickname just stuck. We’d sit around for hours playing video games, smoking weed, and joking about nothing in particular. At one point, we even decided we should form a band. We had guitars and drums and big plans to get famous, but somehow, we never really got around to actually practicing, let alone playing any gigs.

Sometimes, during these lazy afternoons, I'd quietly scribble poems in a notebook. Nobody ever read them, and honestly, I’m grateful for that. They were probably terrible, just teenage angsts and random thoughts.

One afternoon, I was hanging out at Maxwell’s again, just killing time and figuring out what to do later that night. We were on our phones, calling around and texting people, trying to sort out plans, when suddenly the doorbell rang.

Maxwell looked confused. I asked, "Did you invite someone over?"

"Nah," he replied, glancing back at me. "Did you?"

I shook my head.

Maxwell got up, walked over to the door, and peered through the peephole. Almost instantly, his expression changed into a wide, knowing grin. Without another word, he swung the door open, revealing his cousin, Tommy, standing there with a casual smile.

"What's up, Tommy?" Maxwell asked, clearly happy to see him. "What brings you here?"

Tommy stepped inside, shrugging slightly as he said, "I was just in the area—business, you know the drill."

Tommy was Maxwell’s older cousin, probably somewhere in his early twenties. He worked at some IT company, doing the kind of tech stuff we knew nothing about. To us, his job was a mystery—but that wasn’t really what mattered. What made Tommy special was that he always seemed to know everyone, and even better, he usually brought weed.

"Oh, by the way," Maxwell said, motioning toward me, "this is Clay."

I gave Tommy a quick nod and smile, and he returned it easily. Then, without ceremony, Tommy tossed his jacket onto the couch and plopped down right beside me. Maxwell’s eyes brightened as he asked, "You bring any weed?"

Tommy laughed and reached into his pocket, pulling out a small plastic bag and placing it on the table. Maxwell’s face lit up, and he immediately grabbed the bong from the corner.

"Should we hit the bong?" Maxwell asked eagerly.

But Tommy shook his head, suddenly serious. "Nah, man. I heard about Mike’s lung collapsing after he hit one. That stuff freaked me out. Let's keep it simple."

Maxwell agreed, putting the bong aside and reaching instead for some rolling papers.

We smoked and relaxed, sinking comfortably into our usual routine. As we sat there, I thought back to the first time I'd smoked weed. It was right after school, hidden behind some wall, coughing so hard I thought I was going to throw up. Now, though, smoking had become just another ordinary part of life, something normal, familiar, and comfortable.

After we finished the joint, Tommy casually reached into his pocket and pulled out a small mirror. Without saying a word, he placed it on the table and carefully poured some white powder onto it. My curiosity instantly kicked in.

"Is that cocaine?" I asked, trying not to sound too eager.

Tommy shook his head slightly. "Nah, it's speed," he replied. Then he glanced up at us. "You guys want a line?"

Maxwell immediately waved it off. "I'll stick with weed," he said. He never liked experimenting beyond that, always content to keep things simple.

But me? I felt different. I was eager for new experiences, ready to try anything at least once. I nodded quickly. "Yeah, I'll have some."

Tommy smiled slightly, pulling a credit card from his wallet. He carefully cut a small line for me and pushed the mirror toward my side of the table. He handed me a rolled-up bill, I leaned down and inhaled sharply. The powder stung a bit as it hit my nostrils, but the feeling quickly passed, replaced by an intense, alert sensation.

Tommy chuckled, leaning back on the couch. "You ever snorted before?"

I shook my head, still feeling a rush building inside me. "First time."

He nodded knowingly. "It's good stuff. Keeps you awake, focused. I took all my exams on it."

Just then, Maxwell glanced down at his phone. "Fatty just texted. Said we should meet him at our usual spot."

Tommy stretched, getting ready to stand up. "I gotta head out anyway," he said, grabbing his jacket. Before leaving, he turned to me, shaking my hand firmly. I felt something small and metallic press into my palm, and I immediately slipped it into my pocket without looking. Deep down, I had a pretty good idea of what it was, but I didn’t say anything.

Tommy gave us a casual wave, walked out the door, and vanished into the hallway.

Maxwell and I got ready, locked up the apartment, and headed out to meet Fatty and the rest of the guys. As we walked down the street, I started to feel the speed kicking in for real. It was like a jolt of electricity running through my body. My mind raced, every sound and light felt sharper, clearer, and I couldn't stop myself from smiling. I felt unstoppable, confident, energized in a way that I never had before. It was a rush like nothing else.

As we approached our usual hangout spot, we saw Fatty standing outside, surrounded by a bunch of people. The place was ironically called *Stay Clean*, but it couldn’t have been further from the truth. It was a run-down, shady bar, but the owner didn’t care how old we were as long as we spent a little money, which is exactly why we hung out there.

Fatty had brought along some people Maxwell, and I had never seen before, including a few girls, good-looking ones, as I quietly pointed out to Maxwell. That was Fatty’s “special talent”. Somehow, despite being bigger than the rest of us, he always managed to attract girls. Back then, we couldn't understand how he did it.

But looking back now, it makes perfect sense. Fatty had something the rest of us didn't—confidence, charm, and an effortless way with words.

After a few beers and some casual conversations, I got up to head to the bathroom. Once I was done peeing, curiosity got the better of me. I took out the metallic object Tommy had slipped into my hand earlier. Opening it carefully, I saw it was filled with speed. Without hesitating, I used my phone screen to form a line, snorted it, and instantly felt the powerful rush, stronger than the first line Tommy had given me. It sent a jolt of excitement through my body, making me smile as I stepped out of the bathroom.

Suddenly, I had a strong craving for cigarettes. Looking around, I saw Fatty standing outside with two girls, laughing and talking. One girl was blonde, and the other had brunette hair almost exactly like mine. I decided to head outside too, lighting a cigarette and positioning myself next to the brunette.

"Hey," I said casually, taking a drag and smiling at her. "Haven't seen you around before."

She smiled back easily. "Yeah, I know David from school. I'm Julia, by the way."

"Clay," I replied, exhaling smoke into the cool night air.

We stood there smoking and chatting about nothing in particular, but soon I felt restless. Maybe it was the speed talking, but I felt bored, eager for some action. "I’m kind of bored," I admitted impulsively. "Wanna do something else?"

Julia looked thoughtful for a moment before suddenly brightening up. "Let’s go watch a movie at the theater," she suggested, smiling mischievously.

I raised an eyebrow, confused. "Theater? You know that place has been abandoned for years, right?"

Everyone in town knew the old movie theater hadn’t shown a movie in at least two years. It was falling apart, and people used to joke that you'd catch aids just from sitting on the seats too long.

Julia laughed, rolling her eyes. "Exactly. That’s why we should break in."

At first, I hesitated. Sure, I was a little rebellious, but breaking and entering wasn't exactly my thing. Getting into trouble wasn’t on my to-do list. But then again, I was fifteen—a dumb, reckless fifteen-year-old convinced this might finally be my chance to have my first time. Plus, with the speed coursing through my veins, logic wasn't exactly running the show.

So, without much more thought, I let her grab my hand and lead me away from the bar toward the old theater, feeling both nervous and excited as we disappeared into the night.

We walked along the main street, passing cars, streetlights, and groups of people out for the night. Eventually, we reached the place. Even from a distance, it looked completely run-down, with faded movie posters still hanging outside, windows cracked, and a booth with broken glass. It was exactly the kind of place you'd expect to be haunted or something.

Julia walked up and tried the main door, which was obviously locked. Then she turned to me, eyes sparkling mischievously.

"Kick it in," she said, nodding at the door. "It's glass anyway—we can slip right through."

I hesitated at first, but looking at her expectant face, I knew I'd probably do anything to impress her. Taking a deep breath, I thought, screw it, and kicked the glass. To both of our surprise, it shattered easily, the sound echoing loudly through the empty street.

She laughed softly, squeezing through the broken door. I followed quickly, trying to ignore the voice in my head screaming that this was probably a terrible idea.

Inside, the place was even more eerie. We wandered into one of the halls, rows of dusty old seats stretching toward a huge screen at the far end. As we made our way down the aisle, my eyes unintentionally drifted toward her backside. She must have sensed it, because she glanced over her shoulder with a knowing smile, causing my face to immediately turn bright red.

We sat down in the front row, and I lit up another cigarette, trying to act casual. "So," I asked, exhaling smoke, "what now?"

She raised her eyebrows playfully. "How about a show?"

For a moment, I just froze, my mind instantly spinning through every possible scenario that could mean. I stayed quiet for too long, clearly, because she suddenly laughed and shook her head. "A movie, dummy," she teased, smirking at me.

"Oh," I replied awkwardly, feeling incredibly stupid. "Right."

She glanced around thoughtfully. "There's gotta be a projector room somewhere. Think you can make it work?"

By this point, hesitation wasn't even a factor. I stubbed out my cigarette and stood up quickly. "I'll give it a shot."

I wandered around the dark halls aimlessly at first but eventually found a door behind the main hall that looked promising. Praying silently, I reached for the handle. It turned easily, and the door creaked open. Relieved, I stepped into the dusty projector room, my heart racing with excitement and anticipation of what would come next.

Inside the projector room, I looked around quickly but didn’t see any film reels lying out. Just as I was about to give up, my eyes caught sight of a dusty cardboard box shoved under a desk. On the side, someone had scrawled in black marker: **Pleasure**. I smirked to myself, curious now, and dragged it out.

Opening it, I found a few old film rolls inside. They had no titles, just numbers scribbled randomly on each one. "Screw it," I thought. It didn’t really matter what movie played. I figured Julia and I would probably be too busy making out to even watch it.

After fumbling around with the old, rusty projector for what felt like forever, I finally managed to load a random film and got the thing to sputter to life. The projector whirred quietly, casting flickering light onto the big screen.

Before leaving the room, I stopped, pulling out the vial Tommy had given me. I poured the rest of it out, cutting a quick, shaky line on the back of my phone and inhaling sharply. A rush instantly hit me—sharp, energizing, making my heart pound in my chest.

Feeling confident, I quickly checked my wallet, making sure the condom I'd been carrying around for ages was still there. Confirming it, I put my wallet back and headed back toward Julia, ready for whatever was next.

But as soon as I stepped into the hall, I noticed something was off. The seat next to where I'd been sitting earlier was empty. Julia wasn't there.

I didn't panic immediately. Maybe she'd just gone to the bathroom, I thought, sitting back down. To pass the time, I lit up another cigarette, glancing absently at the screen. The movie was weird—grainy footage, shaky, like something made by high school kids instead of a real movie studio. It showed some old dirt path, surrounded by trees and shadows, nothing really happening. I shrugged it off, too distracted, wondering where Julia had gone.

After finishing my cigarette, I started feeling restless. Julia had been gone too long. Putting the cigarette out, I stood up and walked toward the door, suddenly anxious.

When I pushed the handle, the door didn't budge. I pushed again, harder. Still nothing. A sinking feeling crept into my stomach, and panic began to stir deep inside me.

"Julia?" I called out, trying to keep my voice calm. Silence replied.

I stood there, heart racing faster, as a slow realization started to dawn on me: the door was locked.

I took a shaky breath, trying to convince myself everything was fine. Julia was probably just stuck outside or playing some kind of prank. I sat back down in my seat, rubbing my sweaty palms on my jeans and trying to settle my nerves.

But then, my eyes wandered to the screen again, and my heart froze. It was Julia—but not in front of me. She was on the screen, walking along that strange, wooded path from earlier. She turned around, smiling slightly, waving as if she wanted me to follow.

I squinted at the screen, confused. Something felt incredibly off. It didn't feel like watching a movie at all; it was far too vivid, almost as if I was looking through a window, rather than at a projection. It felt so real I thought I could touch it.

Before I knew it, I was on my feet, drawn closer, my hand stretching toward the screen. When my fingers touched the surface, instead of feeling fabric or solid material, my hand went straight through. A sharp jolt of panic shot through my body as I pulled back, staring at my hand, trembling.

A thousand thoughts raced through my head, but curiosity—or maybe something darker—got the better of me. I took a deep breath and stepped forward, passing completely through the screen.

Suddenly, I wasn't in the cinema anymore. I was standing in an open field surrounded by torches, their flames flickering softly in the night. Beneath my feet, the ground felt strangely uneven, loose, like someone had dug here before. I glanced down, and a chill shot through my spine—mixed in with the dirt was something else, strands of hair, dark and familiar.

Brunette hair. Like Julia’s.

A sudden, crushing force seemed to knock me to my knees, as though the earth itself pulled me down. Panic surged through me as I frantically began to dig, my fingers clawing desperately at the dirt. My hands cramped and ached, but I couldn’t stop—I had to know.

Finally, my fingers brushed against something solid. I cleared the dirt away desperately, expecting Julia’s face to stare back at me.

But it wasn't Julia.

It was mine.

I stumbled backward, gasping, heart racing out of control. Fear gripped me so hard I could barely breathe, and without thinking, I scrambled to my feet and ran. I sprinted through the field, down that cursed path I'd seen before, driven only by raw panic and fear.

Suddenly, everything blurred and shifted. I blinked, disoriented, and found myself back in the cinema, sitting in the same seat as before. Warm blood trickled slowly from my nose onto my shirt. My chest heaved as I tried to regain my breath, heart still thumping furiously.

I stood shakily, legs trembling as I moved to the door. This time, it opened without resistance. Without looking back, I ran through the abandoned cinema, out into the street, and kept running until I reached Maxwell's apartment, slamming the door shut behind me, desperate for the nightmare to be over.

I passed out the second I hit Maxwell’s couch. The adrenaline had worn off, the comedown hit me like a brick, and everything from the night before spun around in my head until it all just… shut off.

When I woke up the next morning, the sun was already creeping through the blinds. My mouth felt dry as sand, my head foggy. Maxwell was already up, scrolling through his phone, a bowl of cereal in his lap. He glanced at me.

“You good?” he asked, chewing lazily. “Looked like you had way too much to drink last night.”

I blinked at him for a second and nodded. “Yeah,” I said. “You're probably right.”

I wasn’t about to tell him what really happened. I barely understood it myself. It felt too weird, too unreal—like some dream that slipped through a crack and got stuck in my brain. Part of me didn’t even trust my own memory. Had I just freaked out on a bad trip? Or did something *actually* happen?

“I should get going,” I said, grabbing my jacket. “Before my dad flips.”

Maxwell just shrugged, and I left without another word.

The walk home was slow. Everything felt distant, like I was watching my life from the outside. I kept going over the night in my head—Julia, the cinema, the screen, the field… *my own face in the dirt.* It didn’t add up. None of it did.

And then there was Tommy.

I kept thinking about that vial he gave me. He said it was speed, but what if it wasn’t? I didn’t know much about drugs, not really. I thought I did, but now I realized I had no clue. For all I knew, he could’ve handed me anything.

By the time I got home, I barely said a word to anyone. I went straight to my room and just lay on my bed, staring at the ceiling. Even after dinner, when I tried to act normal, my head kept drifting back to that night—what I saw, how it felt, how *real* it all was.

Eventually, I grabbed my phone and called David. If anyone knew Julia, it’d be him, right?

 

“Yo,” he answered casually.

“Hey,” I said. “Quick question—Julia. That girl you brought last night. Brunette. Cute. You got her number?”

There was a pause on the line.

“Julia?” he repeated.

“Yeah. From last night. She said she knew you from school.”

“Clay, I don’t know any Julia,” he said, sounding genuinely confused.

I sat there; phone pressed to my ear. My mouth went dry.

“Are you serious?”

“Dead serious,” he said. “You sure you’re okay, man? You sound off.”

I didn’t answer. I just ended the call and stared at the wall, everything suddenly feeling a whole lot colder.

The next morning, I was shaken out of sleep by my dad knocking on my door.

"Get up, Clay," he called. "You’ve got school."

I grunted something close to “okay” and dragged myself out of bed. My body felt heavy, like I’d barely slept, but there was no time to think about it. I got dressed, grabbed my backpack, and took my bike out into the cold morning air.

As I rode through town, I passed the same streets, the same stores, the same half-dead energy that every weekday seemed to carry. But then I saw it—the old theater. Just sitting there like nothing had happened. Like it hadn’t nearly torn a hole in my reality two nights ago.

Something pulled at me. Maybe it was curiosity, or maybe something worse, but I slowed down, staring at the building. I glanced at my phone. First period was 15 mins away.

*Screw it.*

I locked up my bike nearby and walked toward the entrance. My heart started pounding as I got closer. But then I stopped cold.

The glass door, *the one I had shattered with my own foot*—was perfectly intact. Not a crack. Not even a scratch. It looked exactly like it always had old, dirty, but unbroken.

I pushed on the door. Locked.

I looked around to make sure no one was watching, then backed up and gave it a hard kick. Nothing. The glass didn’t budge. No satisfying crack. No crash like last time. Just a dull thud and pain shooting up my leg.

Frustrated, I found a big rock by the sidewalk and hurled it at the glass.

*Crash.*

Finally, the window went in. Shards clattered to the ground. I ducked through, heart pounding like I was walking into a crime scene—and in a way, I was.

Inside, it looked exactly like it had that night. Old, moldy, dust clinging to everything. The air smelled the same—damp and forgotten.

But something felt… off. Emptier.

It took me longer to find the projector room this time. Like the place didn’t want to be explored. When I finally got there, I opened the door and headed inside.

The projector was still there, sitting like some relic of the past. But there was no film loaded.

Worse than that—the box. The dusty box marked *Pleasure* with the random film reels—it was gone.

I searched for the room top to bottom, but it wasn’t there. Nothing was. It was like someone had come in and cleaned just that one thing out. That gave me chills.

So now I had two options: either I’d had the worst trip imaginable—an overdose-level hallucination where I imagined an entire night, a girl, a movie, even my own death—or…

Or someone had been here. And they’d taken the films.

But the one thing I couldn’t shake, no matter how hard I tried, was Julia.

Where had she gone? Who was she? Why had David said he didn’t know her?

She wasn’t just a part of the trip. I remembered her. Her voice. Her smile.

I made my way into the main hall again, the air still thick with that musty, forgotten smell. It looked exactly like before—those rows of ragged seats, the torn curtains flanking the massive screen that hadn’t shown a real movie in years.

I walked slowly down the aisle, heart dragging with every step, until I reached the same spot where Julia and I had sat. I lowered myself into the seat, elbows on my knees, hands covering my face.

I had to face it.

It wasn’t speed Tommy gave me. Whatever it was, it messed up my head in ways I couldn’t explain. Hallucinations, time lapses, things that couldn’t be real.

For the first time since this whole thing started, I admitted something I didn’t want to admit: maybe all of this—the experimenting, the chasing of highs, the craving to be part of something “cool”—was just bullshit. It wasn't fun anymore. It wasn’t harmless.

And I wasn’t in control.

I sat up, drawing in a slow breath. I felt clearer, even if the pit in my stomach hadn’t gone away. It was time to stop. Time to grow up, or at least try. I stood, ready to leave this place behind and maybe get to second period, like nothing had happened.

But that’s when I saw it.

Right there on the ground in front of the seat—just lying there like it had been waiting for me—was a bundle of brunette strands. Long, tangled, and unmistakably real.

My breath caught in my throat. I crouched down, reached for them with shaking fingers, and picked them up.

It was hair.

Julia’s Hair.

I turned slowly in place, the silence around me suddenly louder than before. The walls seemed to lean in, the screen looming above like a giant eye. Every creak of the building now felt like footsteps. Every shadow, like something watching.

I stood in that old cinema, holding those strands in my hand, and for the first time since that night, I truly felt like I wasn’t alone.

Something had been here.

Maybe it *still* was.
