I know, you must be wondering how it's possible to 'accidentally' do that.

But, hear me out. I never was really superstitious, and when I recently moved to this new town I did not expect that to change.

Anyway- I'm new to town, so what do I do? I throw a housewarming party. Invite everyone nearby, and the party goes on well enough. I feel like I've gotten to know at least some of my neighbours okay-ish, or at least, as okay as you can in a few hours.

And eventually the party winds up and everyone leaves. I look back at the house and the mess left which I will of course put off for tomorrow morning.

I was about to wind up and go to bed when my front door camera picked up someone near it. I opened my phone- wondering if someone had left something behind in the house. 

I opned the footage on my phone and saw... no one. Looked out the window- nope, no one there. I would've thought it could've been some kids playing a prank but it was two in the morning and I was going to just shrug it off when it alerted me again.

I opened the footage and this time I was very confused. I had no idea what it was that i was looking at. It looked like a dog- but far too big to be one. I only got more confused as it someone stood up on its hind legs.

And there was something... off for lack of a better term about it. The eyes weren't moving or blinking. It looked like a costume of some sorts.

At first I thought it was a Furry and not some eldrich creature (not sure encountering which one would've been worse to be honest) and opened my window and screamed at whoever it was to leave. 

Needless to say this didn't work as I heard weird noises in response. Before I could think of anything else, there was a loud crashand I realized someone had torn the front door down.

I immediately regretted that I was on the first floor- there was no where to hide. I couldn't run anywhere and so I broke a window- and then hid in a close that was out of the way. My hope was that the intruder would think that I had jumped out the window and ran and get out rather than check the closet. Unless they were a thief... but I had a gut feeling this was no robbery. They were here... for me.

Through the crack at the bottom of the closet, I could see a shadow move across the opposing hallway. I could hear it now... it sounded like a weird mix of human and animal. 

I then heard a thump! and assumed it had jumped out the window- but I was so scared I didn't even move or dare make a sound until the sun came well up at around eight AM.

As you can imagine, the fact that my front door was busted down drew a lot of attention. I called the cops-and though they might've been a bit sceptical at first, the signs of damage to my property were impossible to ignore not to mention the footage from my camera.

Later that day, Dan, someone I had just met, came over. He asked a few questions, then shifted his eyes around. "I know you might not believe me... but I think you encountered a skinwalker."

Dan told me how he had seen one around these parts as a boy, but had been sensible enough to run back inside his house until the beast went away. As per him, those things coudl only get inside if you invited them in.

"But I never invited this one in!" I protested. I was pretty cranky about the whole thing given the lack of sleep, and to that, he simply pointed at my front door. The banner that said 'Everyone's Welcome!' that I had hung out before last night's party.

Everyone... I had just handed that thing a blanket invitation. I took it down immediately.

Even now, i sometimes wake up at night wondering how it would've been if my trick with the window hadn't worked. Thank god it did though... but I learned my lesson. Never again would I issued out a blanket invitation like that.
