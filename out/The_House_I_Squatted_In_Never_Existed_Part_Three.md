My apologies for the long time since my last update. The holidays are such a busy time, not to mention remembering everything has been a difficult thing to do.

  
I hope you understand this has been a commanding and draining task for me. I will try to make the next update quicker. Until then.

  
**. . .**

  
Void. I was in a void. 



I felt like I was endlessly falling through a void in space. Darkness enveloped me, and all I could hear was the sound of wind as I raced to nowhere. 



My heart felt heavy. My head was pounding. My wrists burned. 



I wished that, at the end of this, it would be death. It felt as though it was all I deserved.



“Kris?” I heard a voice echo through the emptiness. My eyes shifted side to side, but found nothing. “Kris!” It called again. I felt the air leave my lungs. 



I shot up with a gasp, my eyes squinted from the sudden bright lights. My breath was ragged as I finally took in my surroundings. I had fallen asleep on the living room floor. My gaze drifted down. 



There was blood pooled at my sides. A discarded razor blade at my feet. And Maddie, a mess of tears, knelt at my side. “Kris, you asshole, you scared me!” She screeched. 



“What?” I asked in a raspy whisper. I lifted my arm and winced in pain. My wrists were wrapped in blood-soaked bandages.



“You wouldn’t answer your phone, so I-I came here and-” she stifled out a cry, “there was so much blood, Kris. You…you tried-”



“I didn’t.” I interrupted her, the memory of the previous night coming back to me. I couldn’t remember falling asleep. I couldn’t remember slashing my wrists. I couldn’t remember anything except seeing my mother. I looked into Maddie’s red-rimmed eyes and felt my heart catch in my throat. “I’m sorry…I don’t remember doing this…” My voice could barely rise above a whisper.  She sniffled and wiped her eyes.



“You promised you’d stop,” she spoke quietly and took my hand in hers. “You promised to talk to me.” I didn’t know what to say. I felt like I had betrayed her, but I didn’t even know how, why, or when. “I didn’t call nine-one-one, I know you hate hospitals, but Kris, I can’t…I don’t…fuck.” She stifled another cry and put her head on my shoulder. “Don’t do that again…please.”



“I won’t,” I promised in a whisper and kissed the top of her head. “I’m sorry. I didn’t…I can’t remember what happened.” She lifted a shaky hand and caressed my cheek. 



“Talk to me.” Her head lifted and stared directly into my eyes. She always did this when she thought I was about to lie. I hated how much it worked.



“I don’t know, Maddie.” I brought my knees to my chest and looked at my bandaged wrists. There was so much more blood than usual. How deep did I go? “I just…I feel like I’m going fucking crazy.”



“You’ve been through a lot, Kris.” Her voice was gentle, like she was handling glass. “More than you should have. You…” she hesitated and chose her words carefully. “You’re not okay. You need to talk to someone.” 



I always hated the idea of therapy. Going to some random doctor who pretended to care about my sob story never felt appealing. I figured with enough time and enough alcohol, I’d end up fine. 



Obviously, I was wrong.



“Talk to me, Kris.” Maddie’s voice broke through my thoughts. I looked at her and wondered what to say to her. Do I tell her everything my mother had said to me? Every beating Darren gave me? The door? 



God, I couldn’t tell her about the door. I’m already so crazy I nearly killed myself in my sleep; what would she think if I told her about the frozen door that came and went at random? Or the kitchen that redesigned itself in the blink of an eye?



I cleared my throat and spoke quietly. “I’m scared, Mads,” I admitted. “Of my mom, of Darren, of this fucking house.” I felt tears threaten to spill. Maddie’s thumb slowly rubbed my cheek. “I just…I want to stop being scared.” She brought her lips to mine and gave me a gentle, tentative kiss. When she pulled away, I watched a tear roll down her cheek.



“I’ll tell mom and dad I’m staying with Liv for Christmas. I’m not leaving you alone anymore.”



“I don’t need-”



“Stop it.” She spat with a venom I hadn’t heard from her in a while. “Stop pretending you’re fine. You’re not. Just…” she huffed and sat up. “Please, Kris. I’m scared.” I saw the terror in her eyes. I saw everything she felt, and I wanted to make sure I never saw that again. 



“Okay,” I whispered with a sigh. “Okay, stay.” She managed a small, broken smile and kissed me again. 



“I love you, Kris.”



I froze.



That was the first time I’d ever heard those words come off her lips. They stunned me. I felt the air grow warmer and my heart get faster. My throat was too dry to speak. Maddie gave a small laugh. “It’s okay, idiot, I know you love me.” 



The rest of the day went by easily compared to the rest of the week. The house felt like a home. Maddie baked us cookies, had to stop me from picking at my bandages, and the house seemed to stay exactly as it had when we first got there. 



As we munched on cookies and sipped glasses of milk, I heard her laugh echo farther than it should’ve. It bounced off walls that didn’t exist. I felt that familiar chill run up my spine. I ignored it. Maddie looked happy. I couldn’t ruin that.



As we moved to the bedroom, I glanced at the wall opposite the door. Blank. Just a wall. I only stared for a few moments. I didn’t want to freak Maddie out more than I already had. 



“Mind if I wear one of your shirts?” She asked as she opened the squeaky closet door. 



“Wow, I can’t believe you’re asking this time.” I mumbled under my breath.



“What the hell?” I heard Maddie mutter behind me. I turned and saw the subject of her confusion. On the other side of that door was a bedroom. A familiar bedroom. My bedroom. 



Maddie’s body stiffened. I watched as she took a careful step inside. 



“Kris?” She called out shakily. “What is this?”



I couldn’t answer.



I stared into the room. I knew exactly what it was. The NOFX and Dead Kennedys posters sloppily pinned to the wall, the stack of records next to the bed, the old patch-filled denim vest on the floor—this was fourteen-year-old me’s room.



“It’s my room.” I said under my breath without thought. Her eyes found me when she turned, wide and shocked.



“H-how?”



“Get out of there.” I demanded through gritted teeth. We both jumped when we heard a voice come out of the impossible room.



“Don’t you fucking walk away from me!” My mother’s voice screeched. We heard a door slam and watched my younger self pick up the vest and throw it on. Maddie took a few steps back and covered her mouth with her hand. 



“That’s you,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “Kris, that’s you!” My legs moved without thought. I grabbed her arm and pulled her back.



“Mads!” I scolded her. She jerked her arm away and whipped her head back at me. 



“What the fuck is this, Kris?” Her voice was shaky, and I could see the utter confusion and fear on her face. 



“I don't know,” I whispered. It seemed that was a good enough answer for her. I reached for the door handle to shut this memory away, only to find the handle was gone. The door was stuck in the wall. “Fuck.” I muttered under my breath. My eyes slowly drifted back to the impossible. 



Maddie was a statue, her eyes glued to my younger self. I didn't stop her from watching.



It wanted her to see this. Whatever the fuck the house was, it was showing her this, and it felt like I had no way of stopping it. 



My younger self climbed onto the bed and tried to lift the window. That window was always a bitch to get open.



“Don't you even think about it!” My mother’s voice leaked from the other side of the room. 



“Fuck you.” My younger self spat at her, only to have my mother pull him off the bed by his hair.



“Get off him!” Maddie yelled, seemingly out of instinct. She stepped inside the room, and I immediately chased after her.



“Maddie!” Before I could get to her, she reached out and tried to smack my mother.



Her hand went right through her head. We both stopped in place. Cautiously, she reached for her again.



Straight through. Like we were trying to touch a ghost.



“Listen, you little shit,” venom spewed from my mother's mouth, “I do not want the police around here again, so you aren't leaving this house, you hear me?” 



“We need to get out of here.” I said with a waiver in my voice. Maddie wouldn't budge.



“Kris…” She breathed out quietly. “Is…did this happen?” I didn't answer. I just tugged her arm and tried to pull her back to where we came from. 



It was gone.



My eyes widened as a poster of Johnny Rotten stared right back at me.



“Where's the door?” I said hurriedly. “Where—the door was right here!” I turned and saw Maddie had turned back around. I followed her gaze and found what she was stuck on; blood dripping out of my younger self's mouth, with my mother standing over him. 



“Do you fucking understand?” 



“Y-yeah.” His voice was weak. My stomach turned. I could feel the pain again. I remembered the fear I felt when I saw my mother's fist fly towards me. I heard Maddie sniffle. 



“Fucking useless.” Those were the last words my mother spat before she left the room. 



The room was silent. The three of us stood still, frozen in confusion and fear.



Something metal hit the floor. He fumbled with something in his shaking hands. 



A razor.



“We need to go.” I suggested, knowing precisely what would happen.



No movement from Maddie. 



“Don't…” She whispered, a weak attempt to change my past. 



The first slash was silent. I couldn't bear to look at it. Yet, I felt my own wrists burn underneath my bandages. I squeezed my eyes shut for a moment, and when they opened, I found the door in front of me. Open. A way out. I grabbed Maddie’s hand and pulled her out of the room. The door slammed shut behind us and closed us off to the memory. 



Silence. It weaved between us, filled in the gaps, and constricted around us like a snake. 



I couldn’t look at her. Not after what she’s seen. 



I kept my back to her, but felt her eyes burning a hole through my skull. “Was that real?” Her words felt light, broken.



“It…” I swallowed. “Yeah. It happened.”



“How did we see it?”



“I don’t know.” She took a few moments to collect her thoughts.



“Kris, why did you never tell me?” My hands balled at my sides.



“Mads—”

“Be fucking honest with me.” Her voice raised and my skin prickled. “I never asked because I didn’t want to cross a line, but Jesus, Kris, how long has this been happening?” My jaw tightened. I took a deep breath before I found an excuse. 



“A long time.” I answered simply. I listened to her sigh before her fingers carefully wrapped around my arm. 



“We should get out of here.” Her voice was silk now, comforting. ‘I don’t know what that was, but I don’t want anything like that happening again.” I finally turned to look at her and saw the way her eyes sparkled. It was comforting, but she couldn’t hide the fear on her face. She was like that. Reality was crumbling, and she wanted to save me first.



“There’s something wrong with this place.” I muttered under my breath. “Whatever your dad pays for this place, it isn’t enough.” A quiet giggle escaped Maddie. I felt my mouth curve into a small smile. My hand took hers, I placed a small kiss on her lips, and we headed for the door. 



We entered the living room, and Maddie gasped. I just gave a half-hearted laugh.



Windows were gone. Door was gone—just the wall.



“Kris?” Maddie asked shakily. I squeezed her hand, but didn’t answer. I just laughed again.



There was a door on the wall, now. Iced over, foggy, giggling. 



“Fuck you.” I mumbled as I stared at the door. Maddie shivered and shuffled closer to me.



“What the fuck is happening?”



“I wish I could tell you.” The door laughed again.



This time, I laughed back.
