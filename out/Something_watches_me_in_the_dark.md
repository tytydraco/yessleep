Things haven't been the same since five years ago. It always follows me.

A few years ago, I moved into a house in a nice neighborhood, but it wasn’t the neighborhood that felt off—it was the house itself. From the outside, it looked just like the others. But inside, it felt frozen in time, untouched since the day it was built. No furniture. Nothing.

Except for the rocking chair on the porch.

There was something about that chair. A presence. I tried to ignore it. I’ve never believed in this kind of thing—always thought people made up ghost stories for fun. But the first night I slept in that house, I had the worst sleep of my life. I heard the bathroom faucet turn on and off, the crack of a door opening. I told myself it was just a dream. It had to be a dream.

Then the dreams started.

Every night, I found myself alone—not just in my house, but in my entire world. I would stare out into the neighborhood, but there was no one. The air felt thick, the streets foggy, the silence unbearable. It was always the same.

One night, after an exhausting day at work, I came home at 4:30 a.m., barely able to keep my eyes open. I had forgotten about the chair. How could I forget? I was so stupid to forget.

I sat down.

I fell asleep.

I should have never done that.

When I woke up, it was still dark. I reached for my phone, but my pocket was empty. The house was silent. The air was wrong. I looked outside, expecting to see people heading to work, cars in the driveway, porch lights flickering on.

There was nothing.

No people. No cars. No sound. The houses looked abandoned—like they had been for years. I felt a sinking dread in my stomach, but I tried to shake it off. Maybe I had slept longer than I thought. Maybe I was overreacting.

I went inside to wash my face, to shake this eerie feeling. I turned on the faucet. And that’s when I saw it.

Or rather, when I **didn’t** see it.

My reflection was gone.

Panic set in, ice-cold and suffocating. I waved my hand. I touched the mirror. Nothing. My breath hitched in my throat. I wasn’t there.

Then it all clicked.

The sounds I had heard in my "dreams"—the faucet turning on, the door creaking, the rocking chair moving—**they weren’t dreams.** It was me. I was the one making the sounds. I had been living through them before they happened.

It’s been five years since I sat in that chair. At least, I think it has. Time doesn’t seem to move here. I haven’t seen a single person in so long. The houses, the stores, everything is empty. The sky never changes. It’s always dark. It’s always foggy.

But the worst part? **I’m not alone.**

Something is here with me. I feel it watching. I hear it. Footsteps, slow and deliberate, following me from room to room. Every time I turn around, there’s nothing. Just silence. The first few times, I told myself it was in my head. But I know better now. The sound is always too close, just behind me, like something is breathing down my neck. And it’s getting bolder.

Last night, the footsteps stopped **right next to my bed.**

I didn’t dare move. I just laid there, listening to my own shallow breaths, waiting for whatever it is to make the next move.

I don’t know if anyone will ever read this. I don’t even know if this world is connected to yours. But if this reaches you, just know—**you should never sit in that chair.**

**But if you do… I’ll see you soon**
