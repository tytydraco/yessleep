I know how this sounds. Believe me, I do.

But if you’re reading this—if you haven’t scrolled away yet—please. Just listen. Because I don’t think I have much time left. They’re close. I can hear them breathing through the cracks in the walls.

It all started when I met Sayuri.

She was... beautiful in that way that feels ancient. Like she belonged in an ukiyo-e woodblock print, or a forgotten poem whispered by moonlight. I met her on a foggy evening at the foot of Mt. Osore, near a ruined shrine. I was there researching local legends for a book—yōkai, ghosts, old curses—and she claimed to be a folklore scholar, too.

We connected instantly. She spoke in this soft voice, but her words always lingered a second too long in my mind, like incense smoke in a closed room.

We married within two months.

I know. Stupid.

It was only after the wedding that things got... wrong.

— THE SIGNS —

Animals hated her. I had a dog, Tama, a loyal mutt who’d been with me for five years. The moment Sayuri stepped into my apartment, Tama screamed. Not barked—screamed. He tried to run through the window, broke his leg. I sent him to stay with my brother.

Crows would gather on our roof every morning. Five. Always five. Watching. Waiting.

And the mirrors... God. The mirrors.

She started covering them.

“All reflections are doors,” she said once, brushing her hair with a comb carved from bone. “Sometimes, it’s better not to look too closely.”

I should’ve run then.

— THE FIRST YOKAI —

I saw the first one after a week of bad dreams.

It was standing in the hallway outside our bedroom, just after 3 a.m. It looked like a woman at first, but her neck stretched like rope, winding down the hallway and disappearing around the corner. A Rokurokubi.

Its head snapped toward me. Her eyes were milk-white, her mouth wide open, dripping black ink. She smiled and whispered Sayuri’s name with affection.

When I turned on the lights, she was gone. But I heard laughter in the walls.

Sayuri said I was stressed. That I was “inviting spirits in” by researching them too deeply.

But then came more.

— THE PARADE BEGINS —

One night I woke to sounds—drums and flutes in the distance. Like a festival, but wrong. Off-key. I looked outside and saw a procession moving down the forest path near our house.

It wasn’t a parade.

A Gashadokuro, a giant skeleton made from the bones of starved villagers, walked silently, its eyes burning like lanterns. Tiny Zashiki-warashi danced beside it—child spirits with no faces. A two-headed Noppera-bō dragged a cart filled with limbs, giggling like a drunk.

And in the middle, cloaked in flames, walked Sayuri.

She wore a red kitsune mask and had nine burning tails, each one leaving scorch marks in the air.

I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t move.

When I blinked, they were gone. And Sayuri was in bed next to me, asleep.

Smiling.

— THE TRUTH —

Yesterday, I confronted her.

She didn’t deny it.

“You were always curious,” she said, running a claw gently down my cheek. “I like that. That’s why I chose you. Most men scream and die too quickly. But you? You listen. You believe.”

Then she leaned in and whispered:
“Let’s see how long you can last.”

She let me go.

She wants to watch me break.

— NOW —

I’ve been on the run for 72 hours. They’ve followed me across highways and tunnels, through shrines and bus stations. No one sees them but me. Or maybe everyone’s too scared to speak.

I’ve seen:

- A Yuki-onna, gliding on frozen air, eyes hollow with frost, whispering my name with breath that fogged up my rearview mirror.
- A Nurarihyon, slipping into my hotel room, sipping tea as if he lived there, smiling with shark teeth when I screamed.
- A Tengu, wings spread over the parking lot of a FamilyMart, eyes glowing red like coals, chanting in Old Japanese I couldn’t understand.
- A Jorōgumo, hiding in a shrine, half-woman, half-giant spider, spinning webs made of hair and shadows.

I’ve scratched ofuda seals on my doors, muttered every purification prayer I remember. Nothing works.

They want me broken. Terrified. Delicious.

And Sayuri?

I see her everywhere.

In reflections. In dreams. In the flames when I light a match.

She’s watching.

Waiting.

— FINAL WARNING —

If you’re reading this—don’t look in your mirrors tonight. Don’t answer if you hear flute music with no source. And if a woman named Sayuri ever smiles at you under moonlight—

RUN.

Because once the fox chooses you,
the hunt never ends.
