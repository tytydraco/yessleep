I was originally going to post this in a marriage advice thread, but after what happened today I think it belongs here instead. I’ve definitely lost sleep over this and that’s what this thread seems to be about, right?

Let me preface this by saying that my husband is a good man. He’s always supported me, he’s an excellent father, and he’s never raised a hand against me or our son. Even now I don’t feel unsafe around him, just confused and worried. 

I suppose I should back up a bit. My husband, Jim and I live on the outskirts of Sheboygan, Wisconsin, just close enough to be within the city limits, but far enough away to not have neighbors within spitting distance. It’s a beautiful city, pressed right up against Lake Michigan. We were lucky enough to find an old, fixer-upper house that was in our price range and for the last five years we’ve been slowly turning it into our dream home. 

Jim got a job as a mechanic at a nearby auto parts place while I happily settled into the homebody life and worked from home in order to take care of our son, Micah. He’s two and showing early signs of autism so I’m extra concerned with making sure he’s getting the attention and care that he needs to be an independent adult. 

We have a dog too; a three-year-old St. Bernard named George that we adopted from the local animal shelter as a puppy. 

This probably isn’t very interesting to anyone, but I promise it’s all relevant. 

Everything started a few months ago in March. I was in the kitchen with Micah, trying to get him to try some new food. He struggles with textures so anything new or unfamiliar takes a lot of work to adjust to.

I remember being so annoyed when my phone went off. It was a number I didn’t recognize so I almost didn’t answer it and I still haven’t decided if it was good or bad that I did.

“Hello?”

“Hello, is this…uh…Daphne Prittchard?” It was a man’s voice. He sounded stiff and uncertain like he was new at his job and was reading from a script.  

“Yes it is,” I said, waiting for the first signs of a scam. 

The man cleared his throat and I heard him swallow before he continued, “I’m calling from the Hummingbird Hospital. Your husband, James Michael Prittchard was brought in just a few minutes ago and you were listed as his emergency contact.”

Have you ever had vertigo? When the whole world feels like it’s spinning around you and you feel like you’re swaying even though you know that you’re standing perfectly still and your stomach sinks like you went down the first drop on a rollercoaster. That’s how I felt right then. I actually grabbed the counter because I felt like I was about to fall over. 

“Mrs. Prittchard?”

“Yes, I’m still here!” I gasped, “What-what happened?”

“It seems your husband was in an accident–” I honestly don’t remember the rest of what the man said. I was already grabbing my car keys and getting Micah out the door as calmly as I could. One frantic phone call later I had dropped him off at my parent’s house and was heading for the hospital. 

I feel I should point out here that I had never heard of the Hummingbird Hospital before. Jim and I both went to St. Nicholas. But when I punched the name into my GPS it recognized it and gave me directions. I can only assume that the ambulance brought him to the nearest hospital available or that he had been transferred there by St. Nicholas. But if that were the case, you’d think that St. Nicholas would have called me. 

I didn’t take time to look at the building when I got there but I saw it plenty of times later so I’ll give you a brief description now. Hummingbird Hospital was a boring, gray building just like every other hospital you’ve ever seen. The only thing that makes it different is that, instead of having a lot of religious imagery and framed scriptures on the walls, it had pictures and statues of hummingbirds everywhere. 

I barely remember talking to the receptionist or the walk through the identical white hallways of the hospital. My memories are a blur until I stepped into the room where my husband was. 

He had tubes and wires sticking out of him everywhere and his face was a swollen red mess. Both of his eyelids were purple and swollen shut and he top lip was split so badly I could see his teeth. Every inch of his body that I could see past the white bed linens looked like it had been rubbed with a cheese grater. 

There was another man in the room. A well dressed older man who looked about sixty and introduced himself as Doctor Smoot. He’s the one who told me that Jim had been in a car accident. The police officers who investigated the scene think that a drunk driver was driving on the wrong side of the road and hit him head on. Witnesses said that the impact flipped my husband’s car into the air. I won’t even bother writing down the laundry list of injuries he had.

But Doctor Smoot was optimistic. 

“He’ll need a lot of support and physical therapy, of course,” he said, “But I don’t see any reason why he shouldn’t make a full recovery. Your husband is a very, very lucky man, Mrs. Prittchard.” 


The next few months were spent driving to and from the hospital visiting Jim, going to physical therapy with him, and learning all of the new responsibilities I was going to have to make sure he made a full recovery. Thankfully, Jim’s parents were kind enough to loan us some money to make up for the lack of Jim’s income until he was able to get back to work. 

Which brings me to this month–or I suppose last month now since today is the first of June. Jim was finally released from the hospital and came home. He was still using crutches but Doctor Smoot felt that his recovery time would speed up if he was in a more familiar environment.

I was just happy to have my husband home.

I helped him up the front steps and into the house to his favorite chair. And that was when things started to get a little odd. Like always, as soon as the front door opened, George came bounding to meet us, but when he spotted Jim he stopped. He didn’t growl or raise his hackles or anything dramatic like that, but he didn’t seem to know what to do. Jim has always been George’s favorite (to my dismay), but now he was treating him like a stranger. At the time I chalked it up to him having been at the hospital so long that George didn’t recognize his smell. I’m not so sure about that anymore.

The next odd thing that happened was when my parents came by to drop off Micah. His face lit up when he spotted Jim and he ran over to him. Micah doesn’t hug, but when he wants to show he’s happy to see you he’ll put his hand on your arm and give it a little squeeze. But that night when he put his hand on Jim’s arm he jumped away and started to cry. I have no idea what made him react like that, but he hasn’t let Jim near him since. Whenever he gets too close or picks up one of his toys to try to play with him he cries so hard he throws up.

Jim’s appetite has been off too. No matter what I make he’ll pick at it for a few minutes and then has to run to the bathroom to throw it all up. And yet he hasn’t lost any weight. My husband…isn’t a small man, it’s easy to notice when he’s losing weight and with how little he’s been able to eat there’s no way he could stay the same weight. But he has. He’s exactly the same size he was before the accident.

Then there was last night. 

I woke up in the middle of the night laying on my side with Jim’s face inches away from mine. His eyes were unfocused and open so wide I could see white all the way around the iris. And his face…how can I describe it? It was so still it looked plastic, like it was a mannequin made to look like my husband. You don’t realize all of the little micro-movements people make until they aren’t making them anymore.

“Jim?” I whispered.

He didn’t blink, but his eyes came into focus and he smiled.

I said before that I’m not afraid of my husband. That was a small lie. Right then, in that exact moment, I was afraid of him. That wasn’t Jim’s smile. It was too slow, creeping up his face like the corners of his mouth were being pulled by invisible wire instead of muscles under the skin while the rest of his face stayed completely motionless. Not even the corners of his eyes moved.

He said nothing and after a torturously long few seconds of that awful smile it dropped from his face like a stone and he turned onto his back and closed his eyes.

Jim never sleeps on his back.


It’s morning now. Jim just finished throwing up his three bites of breakfast and is watching tv. I had almost convinced myself that what happened last night was a dream. But a few minutes ago, I noticed him watching Micah pay with his toy car and he had that same, unnatural smile on his face. 

I don’t know what to do. I know that sometimes people are different after a serious accident, is that what this is?  Am I overreacting? Please give me advice if you have any. I’ll update if anything else happens.
