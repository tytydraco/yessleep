Locked in the Dark

Kyle and Mia had always loved late-night movies. There was something magical about sitting in a near-empty theater, just the two of them and the silver screen. That night, the film was a slow-burning horror movie—a perfect choice for the sleepy old theater they frequented.

Halfway through the movie, Kyle felt his eyelids grow heavy. Mia was already leaning against his shoulder, her soft breaths signaling she had drifted off. The theater was nearly silent, save for the muffled dialogue from the film.

When Kyle woke, the air felt different. The movie had stopped, replaced by the low hum of static on the screen. The lights were dimmer than before, casting long, eerie shadows across the empty rows of seats.

He glanced at Mia, still asleep, and then noticed movement in the back of the theater.

A man sat in the last row, partially obscured by shadows. His posture was rigid, his face barely visible in the dim light. But his gaze was unmistakably fixed on them.

“Hey, Mia,” Kyle whispered, nudging her gently. She stirred and blinked at him groggily.

“What’s wrong?” she murmured.

Kyle nodded toward the back row. “There’s someone watching us.”

Mia turned, but the man didn’t move. His silhouette seemed unnaturally still, like a statue carved from darkness.

“We should go,” Kyle said, pulling Mia to her feet.

They made their way to the exit, but when Kyle pushed the door, it wouldn’t budge. He pushed harder, his heart sinking as he realized it was locked.

“It’s stuck,” he said, trying to mask the rising panic in his voice.

“What do you mean, stuck?” Mia asked, her voice trembling.

Suddenly, the man rose from his seat. The sound of his slow, deliberate footsteps echoed through the theater, growing louder with each step.

Kyle grabbed Mia’s hand. “We have to find another way out.”

They hurried toward the side exit, but it, too, was locked. The footsteps quickened, and Kyle turned to see the man now running toward them.

Before Kyle could react, the man grabbed Mia, dragging her away. Her screams pierced the air, desperate and terrified.

“Mia!” Kyle yelled, lunging after her, but the man shoved him back with inhuman strength.

Kyle scrambled to his feet, but the man was too fast. He watched helplessly as the shadowy figure dragged Mia into the darkness. Her cries grew fainter until they were gone.

“No!” Kyle screamed, tears streaming down his face.

The man turned to him, a glint of something metallic in his hand. Kyle barely had time to react before the figure struck him across the head. Pain exploded in his skull, and the world went black.

When Kyle opened his eyes, he was back in his seat. The movie had ended, and the credits were rolling silently on the screen.

He blinked, disoriented, and turned to see Mia beside him, scrolling through her phone. She looked up at him and smiled.

“You fell asleep,” she teased. “I told you this movie would put you out.”

Kyle’s chest heaved as he tried to catch his breath. He glanced around the theater. It was empty, just as it had been before.

“It was just a dream,” he muttered to himself, relief washing over him.

“Come on,” Mia said, standing and stretching. “Let’s get out of here.”

Kyle followed her to the door, his legs shaky. But when he pushed the door, it didn’t move.

His heart sank. “It’s locked,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

Mia frowned. “What? That doesn’t make sense.”

Kyle turned back toward the theater, and his blood ran cold. In the shadows of the back row, the figure stood once more, motionless, watching them.

“Mia,” Kyle whispered, gripping her arm. “He’s here.”

The figure began to move, stepping into the faint light. The air grew heavy, and the sound of slow, deliberate footsteps echoed through the empty theater once again.

This time, Kyle wasn’t sure they’d wake up.
