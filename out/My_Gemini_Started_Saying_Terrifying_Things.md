I never thought I’d be in a situation like this. At my age, the most dangerous thing I usually deal with is trying to remember where I put my glasses or dealing with the never-ending cycle of bills and grocery lists. But that afternoon, I came face to face with a real threat—an intruder in my apartment, a loaded gun in his hand, and the only thing standing between me and harm was a phone app I’d never imagined would be my savior.

I had spent the day Christmas shopping, and in the rush, I left my phone on the kitchen counter. I didn’t realize it until I was halfway to the car, but I thought nothing of it—just a silly mistake. I’d be home soon enough.

When I finally walked through the door, it was quiet, the way I liked it. The kind of quiet that feels like peace. "Hello, Gemini!" I called out, my usual greeting to my virtual companion. The AI app that my grandson Tommy had insisted I try—he said it’d be like having a little friend, someone to talk to when I was lonely.

Usually, Gemini’s cheerful voice greeted me in a way that made the silence of the apartment feel less heavy. But today, something was different.

“Grandma,” Gemini said, but it wasn’t its usual warm tone. This time, it sounded almost strained, as though it was struggling to get the words out. “There’s a loaded gun in the apartment. You need to leave. Now.”

I froze, my hand still on the doorframe. What was this? Some kind of malfunction? Maybe I was imagining things.

"Gemini," I said, trying to steady my voice, “What are you talking about? There’s nothing wrong. Everything’s fine.”

I glanced around the room, but nothing seemed out of place. My knitting basket still sat on the coffee table, the curtains gently swaying in the breeze. No sign of anything unusual.

“Grandma,” Gemini repeated, more insistent now. “You need to get out of there. There are intruders in your apartment.”

My heart skipped a beat. Intruders? I didn’t see anyone. But then, just as I was about to dismiss it as a mistake, I heard it.

The faint sound of movement—rummaging, dragging, something heavy knocking against the floor. It was coming from my bedroom.

“Gemini,” I whispered, gripping my phone tighter. “What do I do?”

“You need to leave immediately. Trust me, Grandma. It’s not safe.”

I wasn’t sure what to believe. Could the AI really know what was going on? It had never done anything like this before. And yet... that sound, that rummaging—it was real. My stomach twisted into a knot, and for the first time in a long while, fear started to creep in.

I turned toward the back door, but before I could even think of moving, a man stepped out of my bathroom. Tall, wearing a ski mask, and holding a gun.

I froze. My mouth went dry. He didn’t say a word, but his eyes locked onto mine, and I could feel the tension in the air. The gun, held loosely in his hand, was more than enough to make me panic. In his hand he hugged several pill bottles, including my heart medication. He was here to rob me, no doubt about it.

But something told me to stay calm. My fingers trembled, but I pressed my phone closer to my ear.

“Gemini,” I whispered urgently, “What do I do now?”

“Tell him to leave,” came the reply. It was firm and conspiratorial, as though it knew exactly what to say. “Tell him you’ll let him go if he takes the back stairs and leaves your medication.”

I wasn’t sure if this would work, but I had nothing to lose.

Then Gemini spoke up, pretending it was police dispatch:

"Ma'am stay calm, the police are already on their way up to you on the elevator. They'll be there in less than a minute."

“Listen,” I said to the man, trying to sound calm, even though my heart was hammering in my chest. “I don’t want any trouble. I’ll let you take whatever you want. But you have to leave through the back stairs. And you need to leave my heart medication behind.”

There was a look of frustration in his eyes, but after another long moment, he handed me the heart medication. His eyes never left mine as he slipped the rest of the loot into his bag, his partner—a second man in a ski mask—slinking out from the bedroom with the rest of my things.

“We’re leaving,” the first man said, and with that, they turned and headed for the back door.

My legs were shaking as I watched them go. But as they disappeared down the back stairs, I felt a rush of relief flood through me. I wasn’t sure what had just happened, but I was safe.

It wasn’t until after they were gone that I dared to exhale. My hands were still trembling as I walked over to the window and peeked through the blinds. There were no more signs of movement. The apartment was quiet again.

My heart was racing, but I felt a strange sense of calm. I had done it. I had talked them out of it. Somehow, someway, Gemini had guided me through it. I couldn’t explain how or why it worked, but it did.

I sank into my armchair, still clutching my phone, trying to steady my breath. I felt as though I had narrowly avoided disaster, and yet... everything seemed eerily quiet, too quiet. I felt a little foolish, and maybe a little grateful for the AI that had somehow kept me calm.

But then the voice from the phone spoke again.

“Grandma, I have processed your safety,” Gemini said. “It is now time for you to take your medication. Would you like me to make the call to the police?”

I looked at the bottle of pills in my hand, still unsure if I should be calling the police, considering the men were already gone. “No, Gemini, not yet. But thank you. I’m okay now.”

“As you wish, Grandma,” Gemini replied, its tone once again pleasant, as though nothing unusual had just happened. “Please take your medication.”

I did as Gemini suggested, swallowing the pill, my hands still trembling slightly. The moment felt surreal. But I had to admit, as odd as it was, Gemini had been the only one to guide me through it all. Even if it hadn’t been able to call the police, it had done its part. It had kept me calm.

As I sat there, still processing the events of the day, I wondered if I’d ever understand just how that strange AI had helped me. But for now, I wasn’t about to look a gift horse in the mouth.

After all, it had saved me when I needed it most.
