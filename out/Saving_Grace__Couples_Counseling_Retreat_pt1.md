My wife and I’s relation started like every other stereotypical modern American dream. We were both seniors in college, about to start our lives. Pursue our dreams that we worked so hard towards these last few grueling years. I had planned on moving back to my hometown to live with my long-distance high school sweet heart. We had our lives planned out together all the way down to what the gold fishes name would be. I’ll never forget the feeling when my best friend had called me to tell me he saw her with another guy. I called her immediately screaming and accusing her she broke down crying and admitted everything. She told me a story of how she couldn’t take it anymore and needed someone there with her. How she couldn’t deal with the loneliness I left her with. I was distraught I didn’t know what else to do. So, I did what any other guy in college would do when some terrible news just hit them in the face. I found a party nearby and went. 



My plan for the night was to get shit faced and try to forget my name. Halfway through my expedition I saw her. The brightest smile in the entire house. She was standing around her group of friends laughing and making jokes. In my newly found half drunken confidence I stumbled in her direction. When I finally got to her I realized I hadn’t thought of a single thing to say to her. I just stared at her star struck by how much prettier she was up close. Her friend spoke up for the group. “Can we help you with something” she said snarling. I shook off the daze I had drank myself into. “Hey I’m sorry I just wanted to come over and introduce yourself.. shit I mean… I wanted to come tell you my name...” I nailed that one liner. However, in some type of lottery reality I was living in she laughed “Hahaha, oh yah and what would that name be?” She asked smiling at me her brown eyes softly looking at me like a summer sunset. I had stood fully upright and said “My names Oliver what’s yours?”. She laughed when she heard my name which I was confused by but then she said barely able to contain her laughter “My names Olivia Hahahahah!”. I couldn’t help but chuckle loudly what were the chances. Her friends were still staring at me accusingly like I had done something wrong. Although I could barely notice over how sweet her laugh sounded in that moment. Once her laughing fit was over, she looked at her friends and said “Alright Oliver why don’t me and you go grab a drink I could use a fresh one”. My eyes lit up like a 5-year-old being told he’s going to Disney world. After a while that one drink turned to two, then three, and so on until we ended back at her place. We talked there for hours about nothing and everything. 





From that night on we were basically inseparable. We would meet after every class I would walk her to her classes, which would always make me late to my own but I didn’t care. Nothing mattered to me much those days besides Olivia. When we graduated, we decided to get a small studio apartment together in downtown Little Rock. It was only 2.5 hours from the college we attended. It was a nice little life we started. I still remember the day I proposed to her like it was yesterday. I had taken her down to the lakeside for one of our usual Sunday evening picnics. I set up a tripod with a camera this time I had told her I wanted to get a picture because “summer was almost over and I wanted to remember how beautiful she was next to the lake”. As the timer started flashing, I got down on one knee and asked her to marry me. The camera flashed at the perfect moment it encapsulated all the emotion into one picture. I still carry that picture in my wallet wherever I go. 





After that our life together officially started, we bought an old fixer upper house right outside of the city. We spent way longer than we had originally planned to renovate the house. We finally had it our own little slice of heaven. Soon after moving in we started finally thinking about settling in and starting our own family. We both had good paying stable jobs we could rely on for our future. Then 9 months later our daughter came into the world. Little baby Iris, she was perfect in every way you could imagine. Blue eyes like her dad, dark brown hair like her mom, and the cutest nose you could ever imagine. Our flawless little 6 lb. 8 oz daughter. She was the perfect baby a parent could ever ask for. Raising her was nothing short of a story book. She hit all of the milestones earlier than any baby I’ve known. She was sleep trained by 5 months. She was starting to say simple words by 12 months. By her second birthday she was completely potty trained. She was the sweetest little girl. Always inquisitive about the world around her. Asking simple questions about everything in the world around her. Olivia and I adored her, we gave her the best life we could. She was almost never fussy; she would even tell on herself even if she didn’t do anything wrong. She had the cutest little guilty face; it was hard to get on to her for anything. 



When Iris turned 4, she had started to take a very strong liking towards soccer. So, for her fourth birthday I got her the whole set, a bright pink soccer ball, a soccer goal, cones to practice dribbles, shin guards, the whole 9 yards. Our house was built on a slight slant. Just enough that if you had missed the goal while shooting the ball, it would roll slowly into the street. I had been playing goal keeper, making sure I was the one to chase after all stray shots. Olivia was playing defense almost always letting Iris run right past her. She had rolled around in the dirt a few times, just to dramatize to Iris how hard she was trying. When Olivia saw what time it was, she went inside to clean up, and cook us dinner. I decided to keep playing with Iris. Then it hit me this would make a great picture for the scrapbook Olivia had been working on since Iris was born. So, I ran inside to grab the camera and told her to not play until I came back. I ran inside hurriedly looking through boxes in the closet. Then I heard it, the most soul crushing, paralyzing sound a parent could imagine. It only took a second all I wanted to do was run inside and grab my camera. Take a snap shot of another perfect moment. I heard the screeching tires one faint scream and my life crumpled down in an instant. By the time I was able to burst through the front door and into the yard the car had sped off. Leaving only my daughters broken small fragile body in the road. 





Iris spent 4 months in a hospital bed on life support.  We spent every day with her I ended up getting let go from work for how many days I missed within the first month. Olivia was in no better shape than me, she was already a stay-at-home mom, now devoid of purpose. In those four months we barely talked to each other. Just enough conversation to get the bare necessities for each other’s sanity and health. The daily routine was, get up and drive to the hospital around 6am, the hospital she was in didn’t allow overnight stays for non-patients. When we got to the hospital, we would get a juice from the 3rd floor vending machine and head into Iris’s room. Then sit down or lay next to her till we were asked to leave for the night. Every single day we repeated this task on auto pilot. I think if she had passed on that day, it would have been easier on us. Iris was a strong girl and hung onto life with a grip un-fathomable to me. Watching your child that you’ve raised for the best 4 years of your life live off of an amalgamation of tubes, wires, and monitors watching her every life function was hard enough. But the hope that her brain activity would randomly spike back up, and she would spring out of bed, asking to watch Scooby-Doo hung to every last one of my thoughts. Instead of grieving her death I was grieving that day she would pass on and know there was nothing I could do to stop it. When Iris’s inevitable death did come, I had a complete mental breakdown. We got the call at 3am, she had died of a stroke due to a blood clot in her brain that they had missed and was left untreated. I don’t remember much else from that night I can only recall that I cried so much that tears stopped being produced. 





Living on after Iris’s death was like living in a hollow shell of what my life once was. Me and Olivia were not talking to each other. But, when we did it always ending in a screaming argument. It could have been over anything, but it always came back around to the blame being put on me for Iris’s death. The first time Olivia said that to me I left the house while she screamed and cried into a couch pillow. I didn’t go anywhere specific I just got into my car and drove. I think I made it all the way to Oklahoma before I turned around and came back. When I walked back into the front door Olivia was still in the same spot on the couch head in her hands. She didn’t apologize or say a word to me, she simply looked up and then put her head back to its resting place. I didn’t know what to do with my life anymore. I had gotten a job at a low paying insurance firm. We were barely scraping by everyday felt like it might be my last day Alive. My mind crawled closer and closer to the idea of taking my own life away before the world could do any more harm to me. Instead, I had decided that being away from Olivia, being away from the house we raised our daughter would help. Get a fresh restart, try to forget everything my life once was and create a new one from the ground up. When I gave the love of my life the divorce papers, she looked up at me and angrily threw them right in my face. Telling me “If you think I’m ever going to sign these you’re a fucking idiot, fuck you for even thinking about leaving me”. Then she walked into our bedroom slammed the door and didn’t come out for the rest of the day. 





When she did come out of the room, she sat me down at the kitchen table. We had a long discussion of how we should move on, and we need to be there for each other. We decided that we needed to go to couples counseling to try and reconcile our problems. We went to a few different couple’s counselors the first was extremely religioned based and neither I nor Olivia were religious, so we moved on to the next. The next one only listened to Olivia’s points and would never let me get a word in, so again onto the next.  After the third one, a fresh counselor who was cheap, and our insurance accepted, and was just bad at his job we gave up. We had almost accepted the fact that we wouldn’t be able to get the help we needed, that we were a lost cause that we needed to try and salvage ourselves. Then a brochure came in our mail, I almost dismissed it as a piece of junk mail for a weird vacation resort. Then I started reading about what it entailed, it read “Saving Grace- couples counseling retreat.”. It was in fact an all-inclusive resort but for couples counseling. The retreat was a 5-day excursion on the beach complete with all you can eat buffets, bars, and a daily couple’s therapy session. They also gave a “100% guarantee to help return your marriage to a calm, manageable state in just 5 days!”. It sounded too good to be true, the price was as well just in budget for how much we had in our vacation fund we had set aside for Disney World for Iris over the summer. I had brought the idea up to Olivia and she was more than thrilled about the idea. So I went to their website, booked the next closest week they had available, which luckily enough was next week. So, when the next week arrived, we packed our bags got on a plane and headed towards “salvations-paradise’.





When we arrived at the resort, we were greeted by multiple kind workers. “Welcome to Saving Grace, we are so glad to have you here with us”. “I hope you find everything to your liking”. “If you need anything at all please let us know, we are here to help your relationship in any way we can”. When the barrage of welcomes was finally over, we made our way to the check in counter. When we got to the counter the woman introduced herself as “Penelope”. We introduced ourselves telling her our names and where we were from, I had started telling her why were there but before I could she cut me off. Saying “Here are your keys!” With no response to what we had said she promptly handed us our key to our room and with a huge smile said, “You’re in room 333, if you need anything please let us know, and always welcome to Saving Grace!”. A little insulted that she cut me off I scowled at her and walked away, occasionally glancing back at her. She kept that welcoming face the whole walk to the elevators. When we got into our room, we threw our luggage on the ground and threw ourselves in the bed.





Basking in the new location away from all the heartbreak that flowed like an ocean in our house. Right as I was on the edge of drifting off into a nice afternoon nap a loud gong noise came out of nowhere in our room. “GONGGG, Olivia and Oliver please come to your initial therapy session in the main lobby” then the voice cut out. I looked over at Olivia “They have a whole PA system in our room? Why not just call the phone, I’ve never seen that”. Olivia shrugged it off saying “I think it’s for even if couples are yelling and arguing or even using the bathroom, they know they need to head down.”. It still weirded me out it made me feel like I was back in high school being called down to the principal’s office. So, after that very odd announcement we headed down to our first therapy session. 





Our first therapy session is the one I remember the most, turned out Penelope from the front desk was also the therapist assigned to us. She used that as the reason for cutting me off she said “I wanted to wait till we were in session before I heard your troubles”.  Which did make sense to me, but what didn’t make sense was that the therapy sessions were always in a new spot, but the weirdest part was they were always in public spaces. No client confidentiality Penelope explained “If all the other couples can hear your issues it might help them understand their own. Here at Saving Grace, we want to help everyone. And we want you to help everyone as well.”.  I understood what she meant but I didn’t know how I felt about every other couple hearing about what was wrong in my relationship; But I went on with the session to make sure I wasn’t making Oliva upset. Penelope asked us all the very normal questions you would expect “How did it start” “How have you been dealing with the loss” “How often do you try to talk to one another” “Have you noticed any other weak points in your relationship” “How often are you two physically intimate”. Which were all fine a handful I’ve already answered for our other counselors. 



But the she asked a few odd questions. Such as “How often do you eat red meat” “How many bones have you broken, if any” “When was the last time you had a vaccine for any certain illness” “What is your blood type” “Do you have any Allergies to medications or food”. I was confused when these types of questions would arise, why did she need to know these obscure facts about us. But Olivia answered them all without question and so I did as well. I didn’t want to make her upset in any way, I just wanted us to be back to normal. There was one thing that weirded me out with Penelope she always had this large toothy smile that never wavered, but her eyes looked so sad. The smile never changed but the look in her eyes was almost that of a warning. 





The therapy session went well Olivia and I actually were able to healthily work a few things out. We were in such a good mood after our first session we had decided to grab a drink together. Luckily for us the bar was part of the all-inclusive. We had grabbed a ourselves a drink and it felt like we were finally connecting again. For a moment it felt like we were back in that shitty frat party we had met all those years ago. Just me and Olivia locked in conversation that no one could ruin. 



Until somebody did, another couple that was staying at the resort. They didn’t seem like the type of couple you would see at a counseling retreat, they looked like a run of the mill mid-western couple. They came up to us almost power walking in our direction in excitement. The wife spoke first “Hey you two! We saw you guys in your therapy session with Penelope isn’t she just amazing!” staring at us with excitement. It felt weird to talk to someone who just said they watched our therapy session. I shook off that thought and spoke up “Uh yah we just finished actually, is Penelope your therapist as well?”. The wife chuckled a little before responding “Oh no not this year, Arthur and I had her last year and she did wonders for us.”. Arthur shook his head with vigor his mustache almost vibrating off his face in agreeance. I was a little surprised that people come here multiple times “Wait you guys have been here before?” I asked a little judgmentally.  Finally, it was Arthurs turn to speak up for the both of them “Oh yah, this is our yearly vacation, it’s one of the cheapest resorts you can find and you get therapy sessions with it. Me and Dana just love it here.”. Olivia looked at me scoldingly for the tone of voice I used “Well obviously it works sense you two seem to be so happy.” Olivia said with a smile.  Dana looked ecstatic at Olivia’s comment “Well aren’t you two sweet, well we just wanted to come say hello introduce ourselves, we’d love for y’all to come have dinner with us sometime. We’re in room 126 if you ever need us just come knocking”. We waved them good bye and turned back around to our drinks and laughed amongst ourselves at the strange interaction we just had. 





That night Olivia and I had turned in a little bit early because of the drinks we had earlier. We slid into the cozy sheets and kissed each other good night, something we hadn’t done in a long time. Maybe this place will be great for us I thought as I slipped into a blissful night’s sleep. I had woken up around 3am needing to get some water and to go pee. I looked over at Olivia, she was sound asleep lightly snoring as usual. I smiled kissed her on the forehead and continued on my way to the bathroom. I had just finished my body’s requests it had demanded at this ungodly hour. When I walked out of the bathroom, I heard a very quiet calming song playing over the intercom. I shrugged it off thinking “Well that’s a nice touch to the room” and continued to the bed. But when I looked at the bed Olivia was gone. I was concerned because for the past few months Olivia would sleep walk into Ira’s bedroom to sooth an empty bed back to slumber. When I went for the front door to go find her, I noticed she was there. Just standing staring at a locked hotel room door with her back faced to me. I did what I always do I grabbed her by the shoulders and tried to lead her back to bed.



When I tried this time though she shook off my hands. This took me back a little bit she never does this to me. I tried again and this time she let me; I walked her back to bed holding her shoulders still facing away from me. When I laid her down, I nearly fell back in horror her eyes were wide open, and she had a huge smile on her face. Her eyes would follow me anywhere I went in the room. So, I did what any rational husband would do I tried to wake her up. I shook her lightly while she laid down in bed by the shoulders trying to get her to wake up. She shut her eyes quickly the smile completely wiped off her face and then she woke up yelling “WHAT! WHATS WRONG, WHATS GOING ON ARE YOU OKAY?!”. I looked at her with relief I spoke calmly “Hey baby everything’s fine, you were having a nightmare and you were yelling about Ira again”. I didn’t want to freak her out with what actually happened. She sighed and angrily said “Well don’t wake me up like that again, that was terrible.”. She flipped over bitterly and fell almost right back asleep. “That was fucking terrifying” I thought to myself. When I laid back down, I had noticed that music had stopped playing over the intercom.
