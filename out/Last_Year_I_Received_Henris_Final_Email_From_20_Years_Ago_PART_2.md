[**PART 1**](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/18jd20q/last_week_i_received_henris_final_email_from_20/)

Last month I finally went to England, marking my first ever visit to an English-speaking country. I was delighted to hear in person the language I’ve been speaking for the past quarter century. The flight had also been a long, long moment of bliss. Maybe it was the altitude, but my tinnitus was cured and so was my dread. I slept with ease in the twilight of the cabin without worrying about ruby eyes prying from the window. Even my dreams became pleasant. And when I woke up mid-flight, I questioned whether my experiences had all been a figment of my imagination. Ah. It took me aback. I had mentally described my issues the same way as Henri did. Sometimes I wonder how much our correspondence has shaped my person.

Upon landing, I took a connecting flight to the north of England, where I presumed Henri’s estate was located. A lot of research went into finding the approximate area. Despite this, nowhere did I find any information concerning the name of Henri C., Henri Colton, or any other of his supposed ancestors’ names.

I opted to rent a car for my stay. The bus was impractical and a cab was out of the question. My wealth was limited, unlike Henri’s.

The first day began – and ended – when I arrived at the hotel some time before dusk. I set out for my initial point of interest the following morning. The journey was longer than expected, but oh so lovely. I felt rejuvenated. Instead of watching documentaries about England, I was experiencing them. The traditional English breakfast was delectable, and so was my picturesque car ride through hills and rain.

Ah, the English drizzle. Those grey clouds were different from home. What a charming melancholic touch they had, perfectly suited for the aged buildings and landscape. That day I truly grasped the American sentiment behind the phrase “Europe is the Old World”. But I won’t bore you any more with my selfish exhilaration.

I drove through a village bordering a dense forest but knew instantly that it wasn’t the one. Just to be sure, I drove around. As the afternoon wore on, I had to return to my hotel. Even without the voices, I wasn’t about to take any chance of experiencing the dark. The trepidation I’ve had back home was not easily forgotten. I needed to spend the night inside my room with every light on, surrounded by rooms filled with other guests.

Day three went by like the second, and so did the fourth. Snow fell on the fifth day. It’s also when I nearly swerved into an oncoming vehicle when whispers of woe suddenly filled my ears. I knew the estate was nearby. As I rode on, I noticed a fenced forest. I drove along and it culminated into a wall going on and on, until I happened upon a gated road. I stepped out of my car and wondering how I could get over the gate. A large sign with bold capital letters read,  **“PRIVATE PROPERTY – TRESSPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED – GUARD DOGS ON PATROL”**. I supposed that this notice was enough to keep most people out. *I* surely didn’t wish to be mauled.

I tried to drive around. Problem was that roads didn’t fully encompass the estate. Rather, it was surrounded by hills and farmlands. Left without alternatives, I reverted to the entrance and parked my car on a stable patch of grass.

My body wasn’t as nimble as it used to be. But nobody saw me clumsily climb over the fence and fall on the thin layer of snow. Once within the property, the manor was a brisk walk from the gravel road. I couldn’t believe I’d come to this accursed place. To my surprise, someone was already there because a luxury car was parked near the entrance. A midnight blue Rolls Royce with a crystal Spirit of Extasy. The car radiated so much luxury I dared not go near; I hadn’t the means to compensate the owner for even a scratch. Which got me thinking. I’d just trespassed on this property. A car meant people. People meant trouble. I was nervous, but my gut told me to ring the bell and deal with the consequences. So I rang. The grandiose door opened. I barely noticed the woman standing behind a broad-shouldered bloke, scowling at me.

“Who on earth are you? How did you get here?” he growled.

“Er – I’m Caleb. A friend of Henri,” I said.

“Who?” he glowered. This reminded me that Henri was an alias, so I did my best to quickly explain the situation.

“…and he decided to enter a cave between two boulders and –”

“Please do come in,” the woman said, popping up in front of the large man. “I’d like to hear the whole story in all its detail.”

The manor was as described by Henri. Well, it was in much better shape, since all the modernizations he wrote of had been realized. I was in awe at the opulence. Even five stars hotel didn’t look that good – I imagined.

We sat on the most comfortable chairs I’ve ever sunk in. Soft and cushioned, but with the right firmness… perfect. I told my story from the edge of an overly long table overseen by a glistering chandelier. The woman didn’t interrupt me once, but her everchanging expression told me enough. She was gripped by my story, covering her mouth with her hand here, biting the side of her finger there.

“… and that’s why I decided to climb the fence and ring the bell,” I said, concluding my story. Only the heavy ticks and tocks of a grandfather clock disturbed the silence of the spacious room. The woman dabbed at her eyes with a silken handkerchief. I glanced at the man, but when our eyes met he scowled and I immediately looked down.

“Thank you,” the woman said. She slid her hand inside her Chanel bag and retrieved a photograph. It was a man a little older than me, with a glorious moustache. “This was ‘Henri’. His real name was Hector Colter. He was my father.”

My heart stopped. I had imagined this woman was someone who knew him, but I’d never have thought she’d be his daughter. “I kn– am sorry,” I quickly rectified myself.

She shook her head. “I should be apologizing,” she said. “You’ve made the journey all this way solely for my father, despite not having made his acquaintance in person.”

I didn’t really know how to answer that and I didn’t like the awkward silence that followed. I hesitated, but ended up asking her for what I came for. “If it’s all right, I would like to enter the cave.”

She exchanged looks with the other man and cast an apologetical glance at me. “It’s impossible,” she said. “We have demolished the place and leveled it with concrete. On top lays a headstone for my father, and another for all my forefathers.”

“W-why? How?”

“Because he told my mother about this accursed place. Listen, please.” She swiftly gestured with her hand as I was about to interrupt. “We entered with a group of people, but it only went as far as thirty feet below the ground. Workers have dug again and again. Rock and dirt were all there ever was. Nothing else. Which is why we decided to destroy it and permanently seal it off.”

I sunk further into my chair. It couldn’t be. The voices were still omnipresent. There had to be something below that cave. Or maybe they sealed off the wrong cave. Yes. That was the only logical explanation.

“Could you lead me there?” I asked.

She closed her eyes and gave me a longwinded sigh. “I vowed never to go near that place ever again. Jonathan will lead you.”

I thanked her and followed Jonathan, the big bloke, to the forest. How strange it was to see the path, now clear of trees and overgrowth, to walk past refurbished tombs and to see those Roman or Greek statues in pristine condition. This estate truly had become what Henri – or rather Hector, I should say – had envisioned. Except that I’m sure he was imagining wandering through those woods himself instead of lying dead inside a dank cave.

Several times I inserted my fingers into my ears in an attempt to block the noise. Like Hector, the whispers increased the closer we got to the cave. I was both excited and frightened. If it wasn’t for the comforting presence of Big Jo, I think I would’ve bolted. But this big bloke made me feel safe.

We arrived at an incline, and, although many trees had been felled to open a clearance of sorts, there was a lingering darkness that I couldn’t explain. As the woman had said, there was a concrete platform with two pseudo-graves on top, but no boulders to be seen.

“I don’t see the boulders,” I said.

“Mrs. Rosaline has had them removed.”

“What? Are you sure? Those must’ve weighted tons.”

“I’m afraid I am, yes. They had to use explosives and drag the crumbles away.”

I stared at the clearing. At Hen– Hector’s grave. It could not be. “Can I go near them?” I asked.

“Of course,” answered Jonathan.

I stepped on the concrete to Hector’s grave. Or rather, tombstone, since there was no body underneath. Well, not directly, at least. My chest constricted and a lump formed at the base of my throat. Tears began to well up. The voices, this place, the sudden realization of loss. Never thought a middle-aged man like me, who had no one left but his dog, would shed any more tears in my life. Then, from the middle of Hector’s grave, two ruby eyes stared at me, with a large, wicked grin underneath them. Laughter, deep as the cavern below, resonated throughout my skull. I was staring agape, transfixed on the eyes. A face took shape. “Hec…tor?” I whispered and his face began to age rapidly, maturing into a wrinkly old man until its skin became mummified, brown like leather, and its features hollow with a hole in place of a nose. I fought hard to look away but could barely move my head half an inch, eyes still staring at his. Until his face lashed onto me. I flinched and shielded my head with both arms.

When nothing came, I squinted my eyes open. He was gone. I frantically scoured the entire area from where I stood, but found nothing but Jonathan, who was eyeing me suspiciously. “Everything all right there?” he called. I nodded and quickly regained composure.

I paced around the large concrete circle and found no gaps, no way in. “Would it be p-possible to crack this s-slab?” I stammered, still in shock from what happened.

Jonathan almost recoiled at my question. “Mrs. Rosaline would *never* allow for that to happen.”

“Guessed that much. But I can’t give up now, though. I must ask her,” I answered, upon which we backtracked to the manor. Every now and then I glanced over my shoulder, much to Jonathan’s annoyance. Nothing seemed out of place, but I had the creeping feeling that something was following.

Mrs. Rosaline, as Jonathan said, was most surprised and denied my request at once. Until I told her about the voices.

“Didn’t you say that those voices have ceased since you came here?” she asked.

“Yes, but remember what I said about how I knew this was the right place. I heard whispers.” I licked my lips, which felt unusually dry. “They have only increased since and were at their peak when I stood on the concrete.” I thought it wiser not to mention her father’s ‘vision’ I’d had.

“I don’t understand. Why do you hear those whispers? I thought they were only audible to male heirs of my family.”

“I – I don’t know. It all happened after I read his last message,” I said hesitantly. Then I had a bright idea. “If you have a computer here, I could log in my mailbox and let you read it. Perhaps you will hear them too?”

“And be cursed for that matter? No thank you,” she replied instantly.

“Didn’t you just say it should only happen to male heirs?” I reminded her. “If your theory is true, then you should be safe.”

“Except you began to hear those voices, which obviously means anyone could hear them.”

“Then remove the concrete and let me enter on my own and find out what I came for.”

Her mouth remained half open while she considered my words. I was certain that, deep inside, she also wished to get to the bottom of this. Except she knew the risks. She knew by my and her father’s account how mad those voices could drive someone. “Jonathan,” she said, biting on her lower lip. “Get me a laptop.”

“With all due respect, Mrs. Rosaline, I–”

“Will take a laptop and do what I ask,” she asserted. Her expression softened as she added, “Please.” Jonathan bowed and left the room. Rosaline and I sat there, with nothing but the grandfather clock’s ponderous ticks.

Jonathan eventually came back with a laptop and I logged into my account to let Rosaline read the message, after which she wanted to read all of our correspondence. Jonathan also wished to read them, and Rosaline consented, even though the permission was mine to give. I didn’t mind though, since none of those messages were particularly private or anything. I mean, Hector had died and I only encouraged him to leave this accursed place and seek mental help. Eventually they had scrolled through it all. Just like my story – no, even more so – she went through a rollercoaster of emotions.

“My father truly was a stubborn man,” Rosaline sighed, biting her finger. “And you have all my gratitude for trying time and time again to stop his madness. If only he had listened…”

It would have been a little insensitive to reformulate my request, so instead I asked, “Did you start to hear any voice?” Both shook their heads. I was relieved yet disappointed. It was no surprise, though, since it took days before I heard anything. “Maybe it will be as for me and take some time. Be careful though. In my case, it seemed as if something lurked in the dark. And that was thousands of miles from here.”

“Yes, I saw that my father warned against darkness, and I will be careful,” she said, vacantly looking outside. Suddenly, she stood up. “Goodness gracious, have you seen the time?” I looked out, and it was obvious that the sun would set soon. I hadn’t noticed because the clouds had darkened the entirety of the day. “Will you get to your hotel in time?”

It was nearly four. Even speeding, there was no way to arrive before darkness. I gritted my teeth at my own inaptitude to keep track of time.

Rosaline gestured something at Jonathan, who nodded back. “If you wish, you could stay here for the night,” she suggested. My face radiated for a brief instant, until the fresh memory of the tombstone vision came to me like a smack in the face. She must have noticed, as she added, “Don’t worry. We will keep every light within this manor on. There are even garden lights,” she pointed at them, “to keep our surroundings lit. If something were to approach, we would see it.”

I furrowed my brows, deeply entangled in doubt, even though I realized I had no other choice if I wanted to avoid the clasps of night. As soon as I accepted, I followed Jonathan to retrieve my car, parked as I left her. Luckily, I had brought a change of clothes, lest I should be in this exact situation. Instead of a luxurious manor, I would’ve been staying in a family inn or something cheap.

My guest room was as large as my living room back home. It came with a powder room and a bathroom. I let my body drop on the king-sized bed, embellished with pillars on each corner. *Am I in a European fairy tale?* I wondered. Everything was over the top, yet harmonious and elegant. The combination of old and new blended well, hallmark that it was designed by someone with good taste. The whispers of woe were now a mere annoyance. My eyelids became heavy as lead inside this wondrous bedroom. I tried to keep them open but they kept closing. *What gives?* I thought. After all, wasn’t I in the safety of light and surrounded by nice people?

The moment my eyes shut down I felt constricted. I opened them and the ceiling started to crumble. Holes cracked open, spewing mummified cadavers all around me while I was unable to move, unable to scream, unable to do anything but watch as a fissure grew larger from the corner of the room. Dozens of black hairy legs emerged from it and widened it further apart. A mist of shadow absorbed all the lights. From within, two ruby eyes sparkled, and a foul mouth formed with teeth large as tusks. The smell of death made me sick because it spread on my tongue; I could taste their rot.

It was closing in. Engulfing the corpses in its path. My whole body shivered as the temperature dropped. I wanted to scream for help but was unable to. In fact, I couldn’t even breathe. The dark mist was surrounding me, above me, and light ceased to exist within this void, except for two vivid ruby eyes. And movement below them. I could perceive the horror of its mouth trying to regurgitate something. Something round. A head. My head! Mutilated in the most horrible ways, turned inside out.

I woke up drenched in sweat, tears flowing from my eyes, heaving. Someone knocked on the door and I let out a cry of anguish.

“Caleb! Caleb! Is everything all right?” Rosaline shouted from beyond the door, but I barely noticed. I looked around, still possessed by my nightmare. The door clicked open and I screeched, until I saw Rosaline followed by Jonathan and two other household staff. “What happened? Are you all right?”

I swallowed hard. My throat was burning. “Water,” I rasped in a voice that didn’t belong to me. One of the staff immediately complied and I empties the glass. “Sorry,” I said. “Nightmare. Am fine.” I actually wasn’t fine. I was disoriented, dizzy, and drenched. “Need some time.”

Rosaline looked upset, with an ounce of pity in her eyes. She asked me again if all was all right, and after making sure that I had all I needed, she asked me to come down for breakfast when I was ready.

I looked at the clock and it was already half past eight in the morning. I quickly took a shower, during which my nose was completely blocked. I tried to unclog it and a crimson stream flowed down my nostrils. Even after the shower, it took some time to stop the bleeding. That’s when my head began to pounce. I really couldn’t catch a break. Not until breakfast. English breakfast. Bacon and eggs, sausages, baked beans, mushrooms and bread. All that served with savory tea. Rosaline had given me other options in case I disliked it, but needless to say I was over the moon, albeit anxious. Because I had fallen asleep without eating dinner, I was surprised to see three other people inside the manor to cook, serve, and clean the place. Of course there were. This was a giant manor, not some kind of large middle-class home. I wondered when they arrived, or whether they were always there, simply somewhere else on the property. Or maybe they had rooms in the basement, not unlike those wealthy American mansions.

Satiated and happy as I ever was – even though the whispers were disruptive – Rosaline decided it was the best time to speak to me.

“I have thought about everything last night,” she began. “It was a lot to take in, especially in one day. I wasn’t even expecting you in the first place.” This innocent remark made me flush. Somehow, I had forgotten that I was an uninvited guest. Maybe I should have shown some restraint eating that succulent meal. “And I came to the conclusion that it would be best to leave that hole alone.” She paused, as if waiting for my answer. When it didn’t come, she went on. “However, I would like you to stay here for the remainder of your trip, if you wish. First, I want to wait and see whether Jonathan or I will start to hear those voices. Secondly and most importantly, I think that if you ever came here while Hector had been alive, he would’ve wanted you to stay here and enjoy the splendor this place has to offer.”

My jaw dropped to the ground. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Staying just one night in this magnificent – yet cursed – place was the most incredible thing to ever happen to me. I genuinely thought it was a one-off. But no. I was offered to stay here for the next two to three weeks. “I hope this means “yes”?” she said and I nodded. “Very well then. Jonathan will drive you to your hotel and back again with all your belongings.”

I won’t describe the trip in detail. But let me tell you that I don’t think any car can top the comfort of a Rolls Royce. It’s incredible how large the gap of comfort is between normal people and those on top of the chain.

Nothing happened during the following week. I tried to make the most of every day, exploring the manor, learning more about Hector, even strolling through the woods. Dreamlike is the word I’ll use when recounting this story. Because dreamlike it was. Especially since that horrible nightmare seemed to have been one off.

Two weeks had passed, and I had only one to stay. Neither Rosaline nor Jonathan had heard the voices, and the whispers inside my head gradually increased, trying to lure me deep inside the woods, imploring me to destroy the concrete. I was ruminating inside my room, waiting for the dribble to subside and go outside, when there was a knock. “Enter,” I said. Rosaline came in and closed the door behind her. She was alone.

“You told me you need to return next Wednesday, is that correct?” she asked. I nodded. “Would it be possible to stay a little longer?”

“Maybe a few days, but I really need to return to my workplace because I’ve used not only all my vacation days but also several non-paid days off,” I said.

“What if I paid for your stay?”

“I can’t accept that,” I said, surprised at the offer. “Besides, it’s not only about money. I could get fired, and I really like my job. If you could simply –”

She frowned. “I can arrange that. Give me your company and superior’s name and I’ll persuade him to let you stay for another month.”

“Another month?” I blurted out. “I – I really can’t be here that long. There’s my job, my dog that’s being taken care of by my neighbor, my passport… I’m really sorry but I have to decline the offer.”

“Please, have a seat,” she said, showing me to the round table near the window. “I have spoken to a few people about this matter and I have something in mind. It will take some time, though, which is why I want you to stay here. If it is as I think, I might change my mind about the concrete slab and get it removed.”

This sudden change of heart was strange to say the least, so I inquired what she had in mind.

She looked straight in my eyes. “I can’t tell yet. I simply want you to extend your stay by a month. If you need help with anything, your visa, money, clothes, ask Jonathan. He is at your service for now.”

In any other circumstance I would have jumped from joy. Here and now, however, I became suspicious that something was up. “Did something bad happen?” I asked.

“No. Trust me. I am not as reckless as my father. All I ask of you is to stay inside this manor, and if you wish to go anywhere, whether to visit or shop, you are free to go with Jonathan. I simply wish you return before night falls and sleep within the safe confines of this manor. Will you do that for me?”

She seemed sincere and perhaps even concerned for me. I reluctantly agreed since I really wanted to get to the bottom of this whole ordeal. We chatted a little, and when she was about to leave the room, I was startled by a red flash in her eyes for a fraction of a second. The door closed and I was alone in my room. Alone with the whispers. Wondering why I saw this flicker.

Now, I have to patiently wait for Rosaline to tell me what’s next. I can’t complain as long as I’m in the comfort of this manor, safe with other people. But something doesn’t seem quite right. I can only hope that this mystery will be quickly resolved...
