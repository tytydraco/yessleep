I’ve been in demolition for over a decade. I’ve seen everything—hoarder houses filled floor-to-ceiling with junk, rodent infestations, places that smelled like something had been dead in the walls for years. But there’s one job I can’t shake. It was the house on Fairmont Street.

The city had condemned it. From the outside, it didn’t look that bad—peeling paint, broken windows, an overgrown yard. But the neighbors told us it had been abandoned for nearly thirty years. They also said nobody lasted more than a night if they tried to squat there. We all laughed that off.

When we got inside, the air felt heavier than it should have been. Not just stale—thick, like you had to push your way through it. The smell wasn’t rot or mold, more like… old coins and damp earth. My boots stuck slightly to the floor, not from dirt, but from layers of dust so fine it was almost greasy.

In the living room, all the furniture was still there, but covered in white sheets, yellowed with age. Underneath one, I saw an old armchair with deep claw marks in the armrests—not like an animal’s claws, but more like fingernails. In the dining room, the table was set for dinner—plates, cutlery, even glasses—but the silverware was all tarnished black. It was like whoever had lived there just got up in the middle of a meal and never came back.

Upstairs, things got worse. Every bedroom door was shut. The first one we opened was completely empty except for a single chair facing the corner. No dust on the seat. The rest of the room was thick with it.

The second bedroom had wallpaper peeling in long strips, and underneath, someone had written words directly onto the plaster. Over and over, in what looked like pencil: He’s still here. He’s still here. The writing got shakier the lower it went down the wall, until the last few lines were nearly carved into the plaster.

The third bedroom… I wish I hadn’t opened it. The windows were boarded from the inside. The floor was covered in dead flies. There was a bed pushed into the corner with all the blankets tucked tight, but the mattress was moving—like something small was shifting underneath it. I thought it was a rat, so I lifted it. Nothing was there. The movement stopped instantly.

We left that room alone after that.

Two days later, we came back with equipment to start tearing the place down. But when we got inside, all the bedroom doors were shut again. I know we left them open.

By lunch, one of the guys refused to work upstairs. He said every time he carried debris down the hallway, he swore he heard footsteps following him. Not slow ones—fast, like someone running right up behind him. When he turned, the hall was empty.

We finished the demolition the next day. But when the excavator pulled down the last section of wall, I swear I heard something—a low, deep sound, almost like a groan, coming from inside the house as it collapsed.

I told myself it was just the structure giving way.
But sometimes, late at night, I still hear that same sound.
