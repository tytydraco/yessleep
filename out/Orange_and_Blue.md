Campus Town in Champaign-Urbana, IL, is a bit of an oddity. It’s about half a mile of Green Street that, due to the nearby University of Illinois, is hyper-developed. It’s a tiny slice of a big city, between two Midwestern towns.

I don’t visit there often, but recently, I had a meeting near the university and was forced to drive through. The changes took me by surprise, to put it mildly. I saw a bunch of new buildings where old familiar and nostalgic sights used to be—sleek, towering glass structures with sharp edges that glinted orange in the sunlight. My first impression was that it was all surprisingly modern, almost too clean and high-tech for a place like Champaign-Urbana.

The street felt different—literally. Within one block, the road seemed to become almost unnaturally smooth, crisscrossed with faint lines of orange and blue lights embedded in the pavement. The lights pulsed faintly, flickering like veins of neon. The cars around me seemed futuristic—sleek little hybrids with odd curves, mirrored windows, and unfamiliar logos.

Honestly, it felt like driving through a sci-fi movie set. Through the bug-splattered windshield of my Jeep, I caught sight of the college kids. They were dressed oddly—either in skintight plastic outfits or in flowing, multi-layered semi-transparent robes. Each of them wore sleek, unfamiliar head devices: orange visors displaying scrolling text and graphics, and blue earpieces glowing in sync with the pulsing pavement beneath them.

It was impressive—beautiful, even—but weird for sure. It had been a while since I’d been on campus, and while I know things change fast, this seemed extreme. In fact, the street, once filled with nostalgic sights, was pretty much unrecognizable. The new buildings seemed too big, too modern, and the colors didn’t feel warm or inviting; they felt sterile and artificial. It reminded me of a hospital—bright and clean, but cold.

I couldn’t stop thinking about it, so the next week, I found an excuse to drive through again.

The change hit like a gut punch. The sleek, futuristic vibe I thought I remembered was gone, replaced by a sense of decay and dread. The sky was overcast during my second visit, heavy with thick clouds that cast a bluish tint over everything. Maybe it was that? But the young faces looked pale and sickly, as though they were lit from below by the strange, diffused blue light.

The few vehicles I saw, seemed odd, with metal panels over their windows, pitted dull-metal exteriors, and chain-mail tires. The buildings seemed to be looming higher and closer now, too, covered in flickering blue panels flashing ads for things I didn’t recognize. They seemed to buzz faintly. The air felt thicker as well, harder to breathe. My car’s vents were closed, but a faint smell, like burning plastic, still seeped through.

On the sidewalks, the kids seemed to be moving slower, their heads bowed. And something seemed to have shifted in their expressions—I saw resentment, fear, or something worse. Craning my neck and looking around, I almost ran into a young man stumbling into the street. His pale face, suddenly looming in my windshield, had a faintly bluish tint, and the veins on his temples and neck seemed to be drawn with blue marker. Then he was gone.

I saw drones hovering above the street as well, their metallic shells a dull, matte blue. Their multiple lights blinked orange in quick, rhythmic patterns as they moved methodically through the air. I saw one pause above a street vendor who was selling something from a rickety cart. The vendor didn’t look up as an orange light stabbed out and scanned over him.

Then came the voice from unseen speakers, low, mechanical, and distorted:

“KEEP MOVING. NON-COMPLIANCE WILL RESULT IN PENALTY.”

As I passed, in my rearview mirror, I saw the vendor drop to his knees with his arms raised, his upturned face pale in the blue haze. The orange light blinked once, and he fell forward, face first, as though rendered instantly unconscious.

In shock, I just kept driving, gripping the wheel so tightly my knuckles ached. I felt like I was dreaming. Or having a nightmare. I told myself I was imagining things: It was overcast, my windshield was dirty, and I was tired.

But I couldn’t stop thinking about the things I saw.

A few days later, I went back. I couldn’t not go back. Doubt and curiosity—these can be types of madness.

This time, the streets looked like a war zone. Litter and broken glass covered the ground, reflecting faint orange glimmers from fires burning in trash cans. The only other vehicle on the road was an armored blue SUV with tank treads instead of tires, it was nearly blocking the street, and I had to drive up on the crumbling curb to inch around it.

The towering buildings were cracked and scorched, their once-glowing blue panels dark and lifeless.

The drones were larger and flying lower. They bristled with spiky protuberances. Antennas? Weapons? Their shells were a gleaming dark blue and reflected the light of the flickering fires. The orange searchlights pulsed erratically, casting sharp, unnatural shadows on the sides of the buildings and street below.

The police patrolling the streets wore uniforms that matched the drones—bulky dark blue exoskeletons with reflective visors covering their faces and glowing orange insignias on their chests and shoulders. Each cradled blocky rifles with barrels that glowed a pulsating dull orange.

Ahead, a commotion on my right side caught my eye. A young man in a tattered overcoat was being shouted at by one of the officers. As I was passing him, unbelievably, I saw the officer raise their weapon. In my rearview mirror, I saw a flash of searing orange light burst from the barrel, and the man, his face and empty hands illuminated briefly in the flash, collapsed backwards into the shadows. In shock, I accelerated and passed an even more surreal sight: a line of college-aged kids behind a chain-link fence, their faces gaunt, their eyes hollow. One of them reached out to me through the fence with a stick-thin arm. I saw her terrified face for just a moment—gaunt and hollowed out. Her skin had a bluish tint, and there were dark blue bruises under her eyes.

And then I saw the bodies, hanging from the streetlights. Their feet dangled limply, and their faces, lit for a moment by the sweeping light of a passing drone, were frozen in expressions of silent agony.

In horror, I accelerated, and within a few blocks, I was in a residential area. Everything was normal. Shaking, in shock, I drove back home. I couldn’t accept what I’d seen. Couldn’t process it. Couldn’t talk about it.

A day later, I went back.

The street was unrecognizable on my final trip. The air was hard to breathe. The road was jagged and cracked, veins of molten orange light seeping through the asphalt like the earth itself was bleeding. There were no cars on the road, just a few smoldering piles of rubble that I had to navigate around.

Fires burned uncontrollably in the ruins, their flames casting flickering orange highlights on walls, streets, and the shadowed forms shuffling through the haze.

The figures along the sides of the road were barely human anymore. Their skin glowed faintly blue, and dark blue bruises bloomed across their skeletal faces and necks. They moved slowly, hunched and shivering, their eyes reflecting the orange firelight like animals caught in headlights.

I swerved around charred human-sized shapes in the streets. At street level, I saw black, ashen silhouettes scorched into the walls of the buildings. Some were frozen in mid-run, while others seemed to be clinging to one another—locked in an eternal embrace—like they had been immortalized by a mad, impartial muralist.

The horizon pulsed with an orange glow that seemed alive. And it wasn’t just the horizon. It was above me, around me, and pressing in on every side. I could feel the heat of it on my skin, a heat that didn’t burn but seemed searing all the same.

When I turned my car around, the glow followed, filling the sky behind me.

I don’t know how I got home. My nose hasn’t stopped bleeding since, and the front of my shirt was soaked with blood. My head’s pounding, my stomach’s churning, and my vision is blurring at the edges.

I parked in front of my house, and as I staggered to my front door, I saw the orange glow still flickering against the horizon. Though my neighbors—one walking her dogs, the other raking his leaves—seem oblivious.

My girlfriend looks at me like I’ve lost my mind when I try to explain what I saw. Her blue eyes are filled with disbelief. Her blonde hair and tan face are shades of orange beneath the kitchen’s overhead lights. Holding a wad of tissue against my still-sporadically bleeding nose, I told her I had to lie down and went into our bedroom.

Now, I’m lying in the dark typing this out on my phone. Sending a warning to whoever reads this.

I’ve seen the future. It’s coming for all of us. It’s orange. It’s blue. And it’s closer than you think.
