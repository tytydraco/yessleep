I’ve never been a great sleeper. It’s not insomnia exactly, just this restless, heavy feeling that kicks in around 2 a.m. most nights. I’ll wake up sweating, heart racing, sometimes with this weird sense that I’ve forgotten something important. A lot of the time, I’ll just grab my phone and scroll Reddit until my brain shuts up. But last night wasn’t like that.

Last night, I woke up to static.

At first, I thought it was my phone. Maybe I fell asleep watching something and it was still playing, but when I reached for it, my arm didn’t move. Neither did my legs. Or my head. I wasn’t just stuck—I was gone. Like my body didn’t exist anymore.

I tried to tell myself it was sleep paralysis. I’ve read about it enough to recognize the signs. The pressure, the feeling of being trapped… But this was different. I couldn’t feel my chest rising and falling. I couldn’t feel anything.

That’s when I noticed the walls.

I don’t know how to describe them because I couldn’t see them. I just knew they were there, pressing in on me from all sides. Smooth. Solid. Suffocating. It felt like I was stuck in a box barely big enough to hold me, but my body still wasn’t there, so how could I be trapped?

The static got louder. Not in a physical way, but inside my head. It was this layered, vibrating sound, like a thousand whispers smashed together into a single, endless hum. And then, beneath it, a voice.

“This is a test.”

It wasn’t loud or soft. It wasn’t even really a voice—it was more like a thought that didn’t belong to me. Cold. Mechanical. Detached.

I wanted to scream, to shout “what test?”, but the static swallowed everything.

And then the walls shifted.

It wasn’t much, just a tiny movement, but I felt it everywhere. The space was shrinking. Slowly. Deliberately. Pressing closer with every passing second.

“How long can you hold?”

The voice came again, but I still couldn’t answer. I couldn’t think straight because of the pressure, because of the static that was crawling through my skull. Every time the walls closed in, it got worse—sharper, heavier, like it was trying to crush me from the inside out.

The pressure started next. Not on my body—on my mind. It was like something was squeezing me, forcing my thoughts into tighter and tighter spaces.

“How long can you hold?”

I wanted to fight, to push back somehow, but there was nothing to push against. I didn’t even know where I was.

“Will you break? Or will you bend?”

The voice was clearer this time, almost impatient. Like it was waiting for something—an answer, a reaction. But I didn’t know how to give it what it wanted. I just stayed there, trapped in that shrinking, buzzing void, wondering how much longer I could take it.

And then, suddenly, it was over.

I woke up in my bed, gasping like I’d just surfaced from underwater. My chest ached, my ears were ringing, and my whole body felt heavier than it should. I spent the rest of the night sitting in the dark, trying to convince myself it was a nightmare.

But it wasn’t. I know it wasn’t.

Because right before I woke up, I heard the voice one last time.

“You passed. For now.”

I don’t know what I passed, or who—or what—was testing me. But I can’t stop thinking about the walls. How close they were. How much closer they could’ve gotten.

And when I close my eyes, I swear I can still hear the static.

It’s faint, barely there, but it never really stops. Like a radio tuned just past a station, whispering beneath the silence. Last night, I thought I imagined it. But today, when I was at work, my phone glitched—just for a second—filling my earbuds with that same crackling hum.

I pulled them out so fast I nearly threw my phone. But even without them, the sound lingered. Just for a second. Just long enough to make my stomach drop.

I don’t know when it’ll happen again. But I think it will.

I think I’m still being watched.
