*"Let's go over it again."* The tall, stern-looking police detective told me.

I took another sip of my decaf coffee, rubbing my eyes. There wasn't even a clock in this room to look at. Nothing to distract me from the horrifying situation I was in right now. I knew it had to be past 3 in the morning, based on the small amount (or lack thereof) of light penetrating the bright white room. There had to be a way to end this sooner than this detective wanted to.

*"I've told you everything I know. She was playing on the playset in the backyard about 25 feet away from the back of the house. It had to be about 4:30 pm because I was worrying about her pajamas getting dirty,"* I felt more tears begin to form in my eyes. It was hard to keep them away, now more than ever with the lack of sleep, *"I looked away for maybe 5 seconds, 30 max. When I looked back up, she was gone. Nothing. The swing was..."* I paused, taking another sip of my coffee to calm myself down and to give myself a breather, *"The swing was still moving from where she was playing on it."*

The cop nodded, rubbing his beard with one hand like all men do with their beards. He was a real pig. Fat, tall, big beard. Judging by his sloppy appearance, I assumed he must have had a background as an undercover. Or maybe it was just him. I stared at the crumbs on his unironed undershirt. There was a wine stain on his white pants, right by the crotch. Probably fresh, or maybe this slob didn't own a Tide brush. 

  
*"Well, thank you, Mrs. Green. We'll contact* *you at a reasonable hour*  He checked his watch, "*So later today or tomorrow at the latest."* He tried to smile, but it was pathetic. He was disgraceful. I hated him with every ounce of passion one could hate. 

  
I grabbed my black purse from the front desk collection tray and stomped out the automatic doors, seething as they had a slight delay. The pressure behind my eyes increased as I pulled out my phone and opened the Uber app. With a shaking finger, I called upon the forces of the magical app-driven driver to carry me to the 3:30 am ball at my home. My husband had been 'released' earlier in the day (night?) and hadn't stuck around. We had two other kids to care for, after all. The Uber was an old Sudan with one door that was the wrong color for the black car. The driver had a clean-shaven face and was fairly thin. 

  
*"Where to, Ma'am?"* He asked cheerfully, looking at me in his rearview mirror. I was painfully aware that I hadn't showered that day and my face was likely covered in patchy tear-streaked makeup. And that he'd just picked me up from the police station.

  
He smiled as I replied with my address and paused to plug it into his phone, which chimed flatly with a response 'Turn right in a quarter of a mile'. I wondered how he would treat me tomorrow when news broke about the disaster. Would he pity me? Pray? God, I hated people praying for catastrophes. Thoughts and prayers were about as useful as a penny to a homeless drug addict. My Mother-In-Law would likely be in a frenzy right now, gathering up her church-going giggle girls to flock to my home with dozens of casseroles and prayer books. She'd probably be bringing her foul tuna casserole concoction which she'd given me the recipe as a wedding gift. I'd always try to make it better, but it was like rabies followed by leprosy. Nothing could mend it. I giggled a little and then was hit with a wave of guilt. How could I be laughing right now? I was going home to a house missing the light it once had. I'd just spent how many hours being questioned by officers. And now, I was laughing about casseroles. New tears welled in my eyes and I covered my face, desperately attempting not to burst into hysterical tears on the freeway while a stranger drove me home.

The man looked up nervously. I'm sure he was used to women crying in his car. He still looked worried, which was a little bit appreciated. It was nice to know that this random guy, who had no idea who I was, was still concerned for me.

*"Rough day?"* He asked gently, looking at me through the rearview mirror, *"I've had a few of those."* He smiled. I noticed that his eyes were a faint shade of blue. Almost gray.

*"You could say it was. I just wanna get home. My husband is probably waiting for me."* I sniffled, wiping my eyes of the scalding tears that continued to force their way out of my eyes. It felt like I had cried out all of the water in my body, yet they seemed to continue.

*"I'm sure he misses you. It'll be okay. Don't worry about it at all."* He smiled gently.
