Part One

  
**The Chosen of the Black Goat**

The kingdom of Kaliat had no sun. It had sky, yes—but not light. The stars above it hung wrong, constellations twisted as if drawn by the fingers of a mad god. In the village of Ormind Hollow, tucked between the dead trees of the Withering Woods, a boy named Klaus screamed into the silence.

He was nine.

His wrists were bound in red hemp soaked with ashroot and rat blood, tight enough to bruise. Sigils circled him—scrawled with shaking hands on rotting floorboards. Twelve candles sputtered in the windless dark, their flames bending toward the center like they, too, were praying.

“Do not cry,” his mother hissed. “The Black Goat does not take weak offerings.”

His father struck him, not out of rage—but ritual. Calm. Rehearsed. This was the fifth night of preparation.

They were second-grade sorcerers. Small-time, desperate. And somewhere in their warped minds, they believed that sacrificing their own son to Shub-Niggurath would elevate them—grant them her favor, her secrets. Her power.

But Shub-Niggurath had no interest in their offerings. She had already chosen one.

The floor groaned beneath Klaus’ bloodied knees.

His parents began to chant. “*Iä Shub-Niggurath… the Black Goat of the Woods…*”

The sigils ignited, not with fire—but with a darkness deeper than shadow, a black that pulsed and breathed. The room dropped in temperature. The walls began to weep. And from the center of the circle, the air *ripped* open.

Something stepped through.

She was tall. Wrong. Female, but not. A silhouette made of limbs that moved like roots and tongues and desire. She wore a crown of bleating skulls. Her face flickered—one moment goat-like, the next, *his mother’s*, the next, something no human had ever seen without losing their mind.

“**This one is mine.**”

The voice was inside their heads. Klaus’ parents screamed. They tried to run, but their bodies stopped obeying. They collapsed, trembling, mouths agape, eyes leaking black tears.

Shub-Niggurath floated toward the boy. She touched his face with a hand made of silk and rot. "*Child of suffering,*" she whispered into his mind, "*not all are born to be prey. Some are born to devour.*"

She opened a wound in the air—a void spilling screams, starlight, and memory. From it, she pulled **the Ring of Demise**.

Dark, obsidian, veined with something alive. It pulsed in her palm like a dying heart.

“**This once belonged to a god. I took it from him in pleasure. In his bed, I wore the face of his queen and stole his pride. Now it is yours.**”

She slipped the ring onto Klaus’ finger. It latched like a leech. He gasped as his bones froze, then burned, then *changed*.

“Now…” she purred. “*Give me their blood.*”

Klaus blinked through tears. “I… I can’t—”

Her hand cupped his chin. “They were going to feed you to me. You would’ve died cold and alone. But I see what they were too blind to: you were not born to worship gods, Klaus. You were born to *replace* them.”

The ring tightened.

He rose.

His parents screamed.

He walked into the dark, one hand glowing with black tendrils, the other clenched around a dagger of bone.

When it was over, the candles flickered out, one by one.

And in the silence that followed, the Black Goat laughed.

 

Chapter 2 **CHAPTER TWO: THE RITE OF THE BLACK SPIRAL**

*Innocence is the sweetest marrow. And Klaus was starving.*

The glade of **Namh'reth** lay beyond maps, veiled in mists that whispered in tongues older than the moon. No birds sang here. No insects stirred. Even time, in this forsaken clearing, seemed to bleed and stagger.

Klaus stood at its heart, barefoot in the loam, eyes shadowed with sleepless purpose. The **Ring of Demise** pulsed on his finger, humming with want—a soft, rhythmic throb, like a second heart.

Twelve stones circled him. Twelve bodies knelt upon them.

Six boys, unscarred by hate.  
Six girls, pure as starlight.  
All gathered from the furthest reaches of the five kingdoms—Avena’s song-charmed forests, Mellimore’s hidden covens, Olympus’ gleaming temples.

Some wept. Some prayed. One, a boy with golden curls, looked up at Klaus with eyes like his own had once been—*full of trust.*

Klaus turned away. He would not look again.
