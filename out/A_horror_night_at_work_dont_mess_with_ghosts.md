I was working the closing shift at my job, I work in a fast food restaurant and let's just say they're know for there chicken. 

Me and some of my colleagues were talking about how this place used to be a bank while we were cleaning up. After some research and rumors about it we came to the conclusion that there was a robbery and a little girl was killed years ago in this very building. 

Already creeper out I mentioned how unsettling the upstairs lobby was at night especially in the toilets. Whenever I was cleaning them I would always here,

"Knocking?" I was interrupted by my male colleague who was cleaning lobby that night he already seemed spooked and I just nodded back at him.

My female colleagues was like me and found ghosts really interesting. She claimed to hear it too and said we should try and communicate in some way.

So I grabbed one of our soft drink cups and placed it high up on a shelf.

I said outloud if there were any spirits here they can come forward and knock it off or give us any other sign.

We waited but nothing happend so I went back to cleaning.

I was cleaning the other side of front when the cup was launched at me. At first I didn't  register what happend but then I realised and shouted for the others to tell them what happend.

Ofcourse they didn't believe me so we checked the cameras upstairs and there it was. Camera evidence of the cup being thrown off of the shelf directly at me.

Next, now me and fc ( female Coworker) were exited and ran to upstairs lobby to see if we would talk with them some more.

Mc (male Coworker) followed as he diddnt wanna be alone by himself the whole thing started to Creep him out.

As we were upstairs looking around waiting for something to happen we heard cries and tears from a little girl comming from our bathrooms.

This was a bit to much for me and mc but fc claimed we could've just left someone here when locking up and it's best to check.

So she went in by herself while me and mc stayed outside the toilets because we were both scared out of out mind.

Fc came back looking pale. She exclaimed that the crying was so loud in there as if it was coming from our speakers which were off at night and the toilets were empty.

Now all of us were creeper out and finished out closes to go home as fast as we can.

The morning staff reported to us that they came in to a tip in the morning and the camera footage showed that between early hours of 3am, which I think is a huge coincidence, all the packaging was knocked off the shelf by nothing. 

The asked us if we knew anything about paranormal activities in the work place and we told them what we did.

We had to "apologise" to this spirit of sm. Loudly in lobby thr next night and nothing ever happend again.

The knocking never stopped tho.



The worst part of this story 


is that it's true.
