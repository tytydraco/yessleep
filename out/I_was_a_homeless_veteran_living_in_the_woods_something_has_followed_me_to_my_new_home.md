This is an update to a story I posted several months ago. I had left the military in search of a better life in kansas City. When I first got here, I was homeless, I had to sleep in my car for a few weeks until my first paycheck came in, and I could afford a place to live. In those few weeks, I encountered a creature stalking the woods I was forced to park by due to my situation. I even attempted to change my camping site miles away from where I originally encountered the creature. It didn't help.

Night after night, that thing would find me. It would lightly tap on my window to try to get my attention. It knew I was aware of it at this point. I never dared look back at it. Seeing that hideous grin once in my life was more than enough. It felt like every night got worse. It stopped lightly tapping my glass and started scratching at it, maniacally, desperately, so much so sleep was impossible. I hadn't been able to sleep in days. In fact, my mental health was beginning to be affected to a point I thought about finally confronting that bastard one night. I had thought of it all day, I'd stay awake and wait for it, maybe run over it with my car, doing something was better than the nightly torture it put me through.

So I waited...and waited, hour's went by until I passed out due to sheer exhaustion. Just when I thought I could finally get some semblance of rest that night, my car began to shake violently. I thought it was an earth quake until I ripped the sheet from my face and saw that the thing had grabbed the back of my car and was shaking it side to side. I never imagined this thing could be so strong. Then I came to a terrible realization. Upon seeing the crazed look on its face, I realized it was salivating. It wasn't trying to scare me anymore. It was trying to get in.

In a dazed panic, I jumped over my driver's seat and attempted to start my car engine. It felt like an eternity, but I was able to force my key in the ignition,only to have my car stall. I look back and see that the trunk door is ready to come off it's hinges, I was moments away from certain death as a pair of headlights come into view. As the vehicle, the creature drops my car and seemingly vanishes. I keep trying to start my engine and begin worrying the thing might've sabotaged it so its meal wouldn't squirm away. 

the vehicle that was approaching us had parked a few feet in front of my car, and a man came out pointing a flashlight in my direction. 

"Sir, get back in your vehicle!" I cracked my window down slightly to try and warn the stranger. "Thereâ€™s something out here, get back in the car and--" before the man could get the confused look off his face, a burst of red mist came out of some part of his body. The bright light emitted from his flashlight turned to a bright red hue for a few seconds, he could only scream as that thing was on him, ripping chunks of flesh with those razor Sharp claws. 

I panicked and tried to turn my car engine on desperately, trying to ignore the horrendous carnage in front of me. Miraculously, my car roared on, and my headlights immediately activated. There was nothing left of the poor bastard that pulled over only minutes ago. There was only a pile of minced meat and snapped bones where I last saw that thing ripping into him. Before I could register the thought of where that thing had run off to, it slammed against the side of my driver seat window. It only stared at me for maybe five seconds before it licked the window that was between us. I stepped as hard as I could on the gas and got out of there like a bat out of hell. I drove for hours trying to put as much distance between that thing and me until my car was running low on gas.

I stopped next to a gas station to try and catch my breath after such a traumatic night when I got a notification on my phone. It was a message from my bank alerting me that my paycheck had just become available. 

It has been several months since that terrible night, I was able to rent a nice house and rescue a dog that I named Sam. I moved far away from the area that creature appears to have claimed as it's domain and things have been very peaceful until recently...

Sam started barking around midnight tonight, I tried to comfort her before heading to bed. My new house had a pretty expensive security system: cameras,lights, and motion trackers. If anyone or anything was lurking anywhere near my home, the security system would pick it up. Around 3am, I slowly woke up from a nightmare I could only faintly remember. I woke up only to realize my reality was much more terrifying than any dream my mind could conjure up. While laying in bed halfway covered in my sheets, I could hear something clawing away at the walls of my house. First, it was barely audible, and then the scratching became faster, more desperate. 

As if to confirm my fears, I reach for my phone on my nightstand where security notifications all read motion detected in multiple areas around my house. I jumped out of the bed and headed toward the living room. I saw Sam shivering in a corner, and she immediately moved towards me, I grabbed a shotgun I purchased in case this thing ever happened to find me again. "it should be enough to take it out if I get a good shot in, right?" I said to myself or maybe to Sam as some sort of reassurance that this confrontation would somehow end with me beating this thing. I swallowed hard as I opened the door to exit out of the safety of my house, I was done cowering in fear of that thing, and I would at least hurt it bad tonight.

 My confidence and anger faded fast as I took my first few steps into my backyard. It was large and dark, the security lights only able to illuminate so much. I felt watched by a thousand eyes in the darkness surrounding my home. As my eyes focused, I saw something that turned my bravery and wrath into cowardness even with the death dealing tool in my hands. Maybe 50 feet in front of me in the woodline, I could see a grotesque face smiling back at me. Then another, and another. When I realized what I'd gotten myself into, I heard that familiar scratching noise coming from behind me. Before I could even think of pulling the trigger, I felt a sharp pain in my back and fell to the ground. The last thing I ever saw was the many faces of creatures ripping into me with maniacal pleasure.
