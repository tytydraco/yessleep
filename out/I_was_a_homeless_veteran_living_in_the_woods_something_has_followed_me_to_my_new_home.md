This is an update to a story I posted several month's ago. I had left the military in search of a better life in kansas city. When I first got here I was homeless, I had to sleep in my car for a few week's until my first paycheck came in and I could afford a place to live. In those few week's I encountered a creature stalking the wood's I was forced to park by due to my situation. I even attempted to change my camping site miles away from where I originally encountered the creature. It didn't help.

Night after night, that thing would find me. It would lightly tap on my window to try to get my attention, it knew I was aware of it at this point. I never dared look back at it, seeing that hideous grin once in my life was more than enough. It felt like every night got worse. It stopped lightly tapping my glass and started scratching at it, maniacally, desperately, so much so sleep was impossible. I hadn't been able to sleep in days in fact, my mental health was beginning to be affected to a point I thought about finally confronting that bastard one night. I had thought of it all day, I'd stay awake and wait for it, maybe run over it with my car, doing something was better than the nightly torture it put me through.

So I waited...and waited, hour's went by until I passed out due to sheer exhaustion. Just when I thought I could finally get some semblance of rest that night, my car began to violently shake. I thought it was an earth quake until I ripped the sheet from my face and saw that the thing had grabbed the back of my car and was shaking it side to side. I never imagined this thing could be so strong. Then I came to a terrible realization, upon seeing the crazed look on it's face, I realized it was salivating, it wasn't trying to scare me anymore, it was trying to get in.

In a dazed panic, I jumped over my driver's seat and attempted to start my car engine. It felt like an eternity but I was able force my key in the ignition,only to have my car stall. I look back and see that the trunk door is ready to come off it's hinges, I was moments away from certain death as a pair of headlights come into view. As the vehicle The creature drops my car and seemingly vanishes. I keep trying to start my engine and begin worrying the thing mightve sabotaged it so it's meal wouldn't squirm away. 

the vehicle that was approaching us had parked a few feet in front of my car and a man came out pointing a flashlight at my direction. 

"Sir, get back in your vehicle!" I cracked my window down slightly to try and warn the stranger. "Thereâ€™s something out here, get back in the car and--" before the man could get the confused look off his face, a burst of red mist came out of some part of his body. The bright light emitted from his flashlight turned to a bright red hue for a few seconds, he could only scream as that thing was on him, ripping chunks of flesh with those razor Sharp claws. 

I panicked and tried to desperately turn my car engine on, trying to ignore the horrendous carnage in front of me. Miraculously, my car roared on and my headlights immediately activated. There was nothing left of the poor bastard that pulled over only minutes ago, there was only a pile of minced meat and snapped bones where I last saw that thing ripping into him. Before I could register the thought of where that thing ran off to, it slammed against the side of my driver seat window. It only stared at me for maybe five seconds before it licked the window that was between us. I stepped as hard as I could on the gas and got out of there like a bat out of hell. I drove for hour's trying to put as much distance between that thing and me until my car was running low on gas.

I stopped next to a gas station to try and catch my breath after such a traumatic night when I got a notification on my phone. It was a message from my bank alerting me my paycheck had just become available. 

It has been several month's since that terrible night, I was able to rent a nice house and rescue a dog that I named Sam. I moved far away from the area that creature appears to had claimed as it's domain and thing's have been very peaceful until recently...Sam has been nervous at night and I can sometimes hear something scratching at the walls and a slight tapping at my windows...
