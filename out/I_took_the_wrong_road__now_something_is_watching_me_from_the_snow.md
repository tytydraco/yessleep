A few hours ago, I left Aspen hauling an unplanned return load through a mountain range I've never been through before.

As a trucker, surprise loads and switch ups in the plans are no big deal, normally. But tonight, my GPS led me down a weird road, maybe to avoid construction or traffic, I have no idea.

I stopped for food and gas while I was on the main road leaving the city, but after driving awhile, I had to make a stop to fix my windshield wipers. 

Despite the radars looking clear for the day, I found myself in a slowly growing snowstorm, my truck chugging loudly between the unfamiliar rocky cliffsides reaching high above me towards a slowly whitening sky, the sun a slowly waning beacon of hope as the snow began to pick up, kicking violent gusts of icey tree limbs and snow.

I pulled over on an old road stop that sat near a few trees and boulders, a small parking lot next to a long-since abandoned service station that sat pretty close to the main road.

When I got out to fix the wipers, I lingered for a moment half way out the door, watching as the snow seemed to form small tornadoes all around me, encircling  the mostly empty parking lot, dancing with the ravaging winds that began kicking up clouds of snow that glittered in the truck's headlights.

I got out and climbed up the side of the hood enough to get the wipers unstuck from their positions. On the way back down, the headlights took my sight in a flash for just a moment. 

That's when I saw him. A silhouette in the snow, just out of sight. Maybe 100 feet away. I hadn't noticed them before, but a pair of headlights were on next to the obscured figure. 

My heart skipped a beat as my eyes barely adjusted in time to see him. I was suddenly hyper aware of the sounds of spiteful and angry wind tearing it's way along the now snow covered cliffs that surround me. It felt like my head was going to spin off into the wind at any moment.

I choked out a weak, "Hello?" that barely made itself heard over the bitter whispers of the wind. 

Nothing... 

I slowly approached, at the time I thought maybe someone needed my help, maybe they didn't hear me.

When I got to the man, he was standing facing his car. He was on the passenger side and the door hung slightly ajar. The snow has already started building up inside the car and around the man's feet. 

"Sir, are you ok?" I managed to squeak out as I grabbed the man's shoulder, fully expecting him to be frozen solid.

I managed to get him to turn, and at this point, I wish I never had.

The man wasn't frozen, despite the snow slowly building up on and around him. He turned and looked at me, his features gaunt and a gristled and grey beard hung low and dripped with icicles. He almost looked normal... But his eyes.

Like two soulless white orbs that were suspended in cavernous black holes on his lost looking face. 

As soon as I grabbed his shoulder, he practically jumped up a foot into the air. I  tried to signal to him, but he wouldn't react to my words or finger snapping. He was either blind and deaf, or catatonic. 

His throat cleared and he had to fight not to upheave as he spoke frantically to me, "It's in wind, it's in the wind..." He kept saying it. Over. And over. 

He got louder, slowly breaking into a hysteric "IT'S IN THE WIND! IT'S IN THE WIND, GOD DAMN IT! IT HIDES IN THE SNOW!"

The man started thrashing about in a rabid state, spitting and frothing at the mouth, screaming upwards into the sky and letting his fear and hatred be carried through the mountains by the wind. 

I only watched long enough to see his skin was beginning to flake off in frozen chunks as the wind began to rend across his body. The headlights of my truck were starting to falter. Something was wrong.

I ran frantically back to my cab, the sound of the old man's screams of terror slowly faded into the howling and rushing winds that pursued me. I could feel the ice starting to pierce my coat and flesh, trying to reach into my veins.

And now here I am, watching the snow slowly build up on the hood of my truck from the inside. The power died a little bit ago. 

Sometimes, I see the old man wandering about in the blizzard. Once he came over to my truck. He tried the handle of the passenger side door for about two minutes, rambling and muttering to himself slowly. 

When he was close, I saw most of the skin and meat on his skull has been torn off by the wind. The muscles are still keeping him going, but that's about it. His eyes were searching, his mouth was trying to ramble while blood and meat slowly churned out in an ooze from his mouth.

I called the police, hospitals, fire department... But I can't give them an address. My GPS is not working here. And for some reason they can't track me down. Most of them think I am joking...

I don't have much longer to type here. I can hear something in the wind. It's telling me to come out and it will help me find my way home. It wants to take me to a place where I will always be warm and happy. It feels a bit crazy saying it, let alone typing it...

But I'm not going to trust it. I see what it does to us. 

That old man came back. He was looking right at me, his mouth wrapped up in a snare like smile that showed blood covered teeth and rotted gums. Even though it was mostly skull now, he kept leaking that red ooze.

I watched as the wind tore him away from the door handle this time. He was dragged through the snow by something in the wind. I couldn't hear it, but I saw his sinister laugh as he clawed at the snow and ice, his fingers leaving oily red streaks of blood as he tried to cling to anything he could.

I saw him for one last moment, and fear finally twisted his face as realization and self awareness kicked in.

Then, it was quiet. All but the skittering snow that is slowly consuming my entire truck. My entire life. And it has been quiet ever since.

I can't make calls anymore, but I keep spamming "post" on this, hoping it will get some shred of bandwidth. 

I won't go out there. Maybe someone will find me, but probably not. I have 3% battery now and all I have is the smell of cold air, and the whispers of the wind, trying to force it's way inside.

I'm going to try and get some sleep. I am so cold. If I can, I'll update you. If not, well... Stay out of the wind.
