It’s one thing to say you’ve seen the abyss stare back at you, but another entirely to have it laced with the ancient stuff of myths. I was in Narvik, Norway, drawn by the lure of a WWII shipwreck rumored to lie untouched in the icy depths. A perfect blend of history and adrenaline—my kind of gig.

Equipped with my trusty diving suit, I submerged into the Nordic waters, the cold a sharp bite against my skin. The visibility wasn't half bad, and before long, the silhouette of the sunken warship emerged from the murk like a ghost. I moved closer, my torch cutting through the water, revealing rusted metal and a graveyard of maritime history.

That’s when I felt it—a vibration in the water. Subtle at first, then growing, rhythmic, almost like a heartbeat. Curious, I followed the sensation, navigating around the ship's stern. And there it was. Not a torpedo, not a mine, but something far more bizarre—an enormous scale-covered coil, vast enough to wrap around the ship several times.

My heart raced. I knew the tales, the Nordic legends of Jörmungandr, the World Serpent, a creature so large it encircled the Earth, gripping its own tail in its jaws. A myth, or so I thought until today. The scales shimmered with an eerie iridescence, the colors shifting with the sway of the water. But something was amiss—the tail was loose, not held tight as the stories insisted it should be.

A shiver ran down my spine, not from the cold but from the sudden realization of what this could mean. Ragnarök. The end of the world. According to legend, the moment Jörmungandr releases its tail, the apocalypse begins. I never put much stock in myths, but there, in the deep, with the only sound my own breathing and the distant, haunting echo of the sea, belief became a chilling possibility.

I should have returned to the surface, reported my findings, maybe even alerted the authorities. But there’s something about human curiosity, isn’t there? The need to see, to know, even if that knowledge might be your undoing. I approached the serpent, close enough to touch it, to see the ancient patterns etched into each colossal scale.

It moved then, a slow, deliberate coil, a ripple of muscle and myth, powerful enough to create currents that buffeted me back. My equipment screamed warnings, my own instincts yelled louder. But as I retreated, I saw it—the eyes, ancient and endless, aware, watching not just me but the shore beyond, the world beyond.

I made it back to my boat, heart pounding, mind racing. The sea had calmed as if nothing had happened. But as I stripped off my gear, the horizon seemed darker, the air heavier. Whether it was my imagination or the beginning of the end, I couldn’t say.

So, here I write this, not sure if it’s a warning, a story, or the ramblings of a diver too long in the depths. Somewhere out there in the cold, dark waters of Narvik, Jörmungandr stirs, and the world holds its [breath](https://new.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1d3diim/a_killer_gave_us_a_list_of_instructions_we_had_to/), [waiting](https://new.reddit.com/r/PageTurner627Horror/comments/1bg4l0g/i_found_out_why_my_dad_never_talked_about_his/).
