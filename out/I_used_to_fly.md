When I was a kid, I used to fly.

Not in a plane, not in a dream—I mean really fly. My feet would lift from the ground, the air would wrap around me like unseen hands, and I would rise, higher and higher, leaving the world behind.

The first time it happened, I was seven. It had rained heavily, and the streets shimmered like liquid glass. I was playing in the yard, jumping from puddle to puddle, when I felt something shift inside me—like a balloon inflating in my chest. A lightness. A pull. Before I knew it, my toes skimmed the grass, then left it entirely. I floated, weightless, the wind cool against my skin.

It was exhilarating. Addictive. I learned how to control it, how to direct myself through the air, gliding over rooftops and treetops. The world from above was peaceful, soft, almost silent. I could see the town stretching beneath me like a toy model, the distant forest rolling like an emerald sea beyond its edges.

But as I grew older, something changed.

One night, I went flying as usual, letting the wind carry me up, up, higher than ever before. The town became a blur of lights, the forest a smudge of black against the horizon. I should have felt free. But something was wrong.

The air was heavy that night. Thick, oppressive. The sky had darkened unnaturally fast, clouds swallowing the stars one by one. I tried to descend, but the wind didn’t listen. It pushed me higher, stronger, forcing me away from the ground. Panic clenched my chest.

I twisted, flailed, willed myself downward—but gravity had abandoned me. The earth shrank beneath me, the houses no longer doll-like but distant, fading away. The clouds rolled in, black and roiling, swallowing the world below. The stars winked out. I was alone.

I screamed, but the sound was lost in the rushing wind. The sky was alive, a monstrous thing with no edges, no escape. My breath came in ragged gasps as I fought against the pull, my body aching with effort. I was so high now, too high, and the air was thin and wrong, seeping into my lungs like ice.

Then, I stopped moving. I was trapped, suspended in the sky like an insect in amber. The air had turned thick—dense, suffocating, like wading through gelatin. My arms strained as I clawed downward, but I barely moved. My lungs burned. I needed to descend. I needed the ground beneath me.

A sudden jolt—like an invisible hand yanking me down. I plummeted, my stomach flipping as if I’d dropped from a great height. The air pocket spat me downward, but just as suddenly, I was stuck again. The wind gripped me, refusing to let me go.

Another drop. My breath ripped from my chest with the force of it. I barely had time to inhale before I was caught again, suspended in the suffocating, crushing sky. My vision blurred, my muscles screamed. I kicked, thrashed, willed myself to fall. Another jolt. Another gut-wrenching drop. The cycle continued—fall, freeze, fall, freeze—until, finally, the wind lost its grip.

I could move.

Shaking, gasping, I willed myself downward, guiding my body toward the distant safety of the earth. My descent was shaky, uneven, but I didn’t care. I just needed to touch solid ground again. The lights of the town grew closer, the rooftops sharpened into view.

And then, at last—my feet touched the grass. My knees buckled. I collapsed, pressing my hands against the damp earth, as if afraid it would vanish beneath me.

I never flew in the sky again. After that night, I didn’t dare. And as the years passed, it was as if my body forgot how. The lightness inside me faded, leaving nothing but memory.

I will never let the wind take me again.
