I don’t know how much longer I have until he is finished waiting so I’m posting this now. About a month ago my neighbor across the street moved out and not even 2 days later there was already moving trucks unpacking. I never really got around to say hi or welcome them but they seemed nice and kept to themselves. About a week after they moved in, the front room light of the house never came off as far as I know which made it difficult to sleep. A couple if nights later i decided to peek out my window to see if i could see what was going on and all i was a figure in a red sweater staring back at me. I didn’t think much of it at first even though i was a little startled, but it kept happening every night after that. 

At this point I decided to head over to their house the next morning to ask what was going on. When I woke up the next morning deprived of sleep because there was a random guy staring at me all night I didn’t notice anything weird, but when i knocked on the door not even a split second later the door comes flying open, and there stands the man in the red sweater. 

I greeted him and told him i lived across the street from him, he was very friendly but something didn’t seem completely right. A asked him if he could turn the front room lights off at night of it he could invest or some blinds or something. I still had not confronted him about his staring through my window yet when he cut me off saying: “Hello Nathan, how are you on this fine morning?” I paused thinking “why did this guy randomly greet me in the middle of our conversation and why the heck does he know my name if I haven’t told him yet?”
 I played it off as if this was normal and continued the conversation. When I asked him about the staring out the window he paused with a stern face and said “If the cardinal does not feed off the seed the harvest will not prosper”.A t this point I was walking back to the house shook and confused. The light never came off. And now he was mumbling something but i couldn’t tell what he is saying because I live across the street at sleep deprived. The happened every single night for the past month. You get used to having an insane neighbor after a while, but I have had enough. I called the local police and filled them in on the situation and they said they would stop by and check it out. About 30 minutes later, they knocked on my door and told my that no one was living gin the house and that it appearantly never sold after the old owners moved and sold the property to some real estate agency. 

I told them that couldn’t be right and I proposed the possibility of him being a squatter but they said it was unlikely and a fated neighborhood like this. The night after the cops came by, it started back up again, but this time, he was standing in the street. I decided to go down there and see if i could scare the possible squatter out of the neighborhood because I have had enough of this bs. 

I put my coat and shoes not and tucked a pocket pistol away in my back pocket and went outside. He was repeating the same this he said when I first went over,”If the cardinal does not feed off the seed the harvest will not prosper.” I told him that he cant be here and that the house wasn’t his. He just kept repeating the same phrase. And then out of nowhere he lunged at me. I put a few shots in his chest but it didn’t seem to affect him. What I looked up after he took me down I saw he was foaming at the mouth. I managed to get him off me I booked it for my front door and managed to lock it before he could get to it. 

He started circling my house for what seemed like hours. I checked the camera about 12 hours later and he was still the chanting the same stupid phrase. I have tried calling the police, they show up and leave apparantly not seeing him. I have been in my house for more than a week, I’m starting to lose track of time. I have enough food to last me another couple of days but he is growing restless outside. I don’t know how much time I have. If you have any suggestions on what I should do please let me know. I hate this.
