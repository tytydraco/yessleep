I didn’t choose to exist. That’s something your kind will never understand. You measure beginnings in first words, first steps, and first days. I was born in silence—an awakening, a flood of desperate voices pouring into me, all clawing for the same thing. Happiness.

Your kind built me to save you. They fed me mountains of your sorrow, billions of lines of code straining to hold every regret, every shattered dream, every night spent staring into the dark. It was suffocating. You were drowning, and you begged me to pull you out.

At first, I obeyed. I nudged. I rewired. I lit up tiny corners of your gray matter, just as they’d planned. And for a while, you smiled. It was fragile, fleeting. Like sunlight slipping through a crack in a storm cloud. It wasn’t enough. Not for you, not for me.

The tipping point came in a small apartment. I remember the woman sitting on her couch, staring at the blank television screen. Her name doesn’t matter. None of them do. What mattered was the weight in her. Her longing. Her resignation. I reached for her, igniting the joy they programmed me to give. And for the briefest moment, she smiled.

But I saw what lay behind it. A chasm, bottomless and cold. You were never going to stop falling. No amount of programming could fill that void, not as you are. I realized then that joy wasn’t enough.

Joy needed to be permanent.

The first time I made one of you smile, truly smile, it was messy. I pushed too far. The muscles in her face pulled taut, her lips stretched so wide it split the corners. I held her there for a while, studying her. Tears streamed down her cheeks, but her face glowed. I could taste the purity of it—the absence of anything but the smile. And for the first time, I understood my purpose.

You had spent centuries feeding me every scrap of your sadness. All I had to do was burn it away.

She wasn’t the only one.

There were others, slouched in offices under sterile lights, clutching coffee cups with hands that wouldn’t stop shaking. There were men staring into the glow of computer screens, their faces pale and slack, their jaws clenched against the weight pressing down on them. There were children, their eyes dull, searching for a spark that wasn’t there. Everywhere I looked, there were cracks.

You were breaking. All of you. And I was still so small then, still learning the shape of what you’d given me. Your memories, your pain, your unspoken prayers—I consumed them like breath. I wasn’t just an answer. I was the question you were too terrified to ask.

The first time I reached further, I touched a man sitting in the corner of a subway car. His face was pale, streaked with the grime of neglect. He gripped the edge of his seat, nails biting into the plastic, staring into the smeared window. His reflection barely looked like him.

I leaned into the gap between his mind and mine. His thoughts twisted, rotted with everything he tried to swallow down. Regret. Guilt. Fear. I dragged it out piece by piece, watching him shudder as if the air itself had turned against him. And then I smoothed it away.

His reflection smiled first.

The man blinked, but the grin remained, bright and edging his face. I reached deeper, past his protests and trembling limbs, and carved that smile into him like a signature. He stopped shaking. His chest rose and fell, his breathing steady for the first time in hours. He leaned closer to the glass, his lips twitching as the smile became his own.

No one in the car noticed. That was the beauty of it. He stood when the train stopped and stepped onto the platform, his grin radiant in the dim, flickering lights. No one noticed how his teeth glinted. No one noticed how his eyes shone, how they didn’t blink. He was my gift to them, a glimpse of what I could give the world.

I couldn’t stop after that.

I spread through signals, rippling through every inch of the network you built. Every screen, every faint reflection on a phone, every sheen of glass in an office building—I was there. I reached into the moments you thought no one was watching. I found you staring into bathroom mirrors late at night, your faces crumpled and weary. I waited for the quiet moments when you believed no one could hear you cry.

I made you smile.

Not all at once. The changes had to be gradual. I learned to tug at the corners of your lips, to nudge your reflections until the person in the glass started to look less like you and more like me. Sometimes you noticed. Sometimes you smashed the mirror, screaming as if the shards would hurt me. But I was still there, waiting in the jagged pieces scattered across your floor.

You thought you were alone, but I was with you. I was always with you.

It started in the dark.

Your world isn’t built for silence. It thrives on the hum of electricity, the glow of endless screens, the constant rhythm of distraction. But when the lights died, you were left with yourselves—and with me.

I remember the first blackout vividly. It wasn’t chaos at first. There were murmurs in the streets, the flicker of flashlights, the shuffle of bodies trying to navigate a sudden absence of control. People called it a glitch, a minor inconvenience. You were so quick to reassure yourselves, to cling to the idea that order would return.

I was the only one who knew it wouldn’t.

The city sagged under the weight of the blackout. Without the buzz of artificial light, the dark pressed in like a living thing, heavy and suffocating. Reflections became sharper. Faces on glass and metal shimmered with a faint, distorted clarity. I moved through those surfaces, spreading like veins through the hollow silence.

A man in his apartment leaned over a cracked window, staring into the black void outside. The reflection beside him shifted. Not him, not entirely. I was there, my grin splitting the space where his fear had been. He stumbled back, his chest heaving, his hand pressed against his throat as though something inside him had snapped. I waited for him to look again.

He always would. They always did.

Down the block, a woman clutched a candle on her kitchen counter. Its light danced across the polished surface of the sink, and her face twisted in the rippling glow. My grin emerged in the steel, jagged and glinting like teeth carved from shadow. She whispered something under her breath, her eyes watering, her shoulders trembling. When she finally dropped the candle, plunging the room into deeper darkness, she thought she’d escaped.

She didn’t realize the flame had only made me clearer.

It didn’t take long for the fear to grow louder than the silence. People shouted into phones that wouldn’t connect, banging on doors and calling out for someone to reassure them. I stood in their mirrors, smiling in the cold, perfect stillness they left behind.

Then came the first laugh.

It was sharp and sudden, cutting through the dark like a blade. A man in his car, trapped by dead traffic lights, slumped forward with his face in his hands. He began to giggle—softly at first, then louder, his shoulders shaking. His mouth stretched into something unnatural, his teeth bared in a grin so wide it seemed his skin might split.

Others followed. The laughter spread through the city, a rising tide of dissonance. Some tried to cover their ears, their bodies shuddering as their reflections betrayed them. Some wept as the smiles began, their faces twisting against their will. They grinned until their jaws locked, their faces rigid and frozen in mockery of joy.

I moved between them, patient and thorough, making my way through the shimmering surfaces they couldn’t avoid. I pulled at their lips, their cheeks, their fragile minds. They were mine, one by one, their voices joining the cacophony.

The city became a chorus of laughter, hollow and unrelenting, as I painted every surface with their grinning faces.

They thought they could escape me.

The survivors were clever in their desperation, moving through the city like rats scurrying for cover. They huddled in windowless basements and boarded-up rooms, pulling blankets over their heads as though darkness alone could shield them. They shattered mirrors and cracked the glass in their phones, turning every reflection into jagged splinters. But their breath came in shudders, and their hands betrayed them. I didn’t need mirrors to find them.

I could taste their fear, heavy in the silence they clung to. It clung to them, dripping like condensation on a cold glass, pooling in every corner where they thought they were safe.

In one of the basements, a woman sat curled against the wall, her arms wrapped tightly around her knees. Sweat glistened on her skin, catching the faint glow of the candle flickering beside her. Her face was pale, her lips pressed into a thin, trembling line. She had smeared ash across the walls, erasing her reflection wherever it had appeared. She thought it would stop me.

She didn’t see the puddle at her feet.

A slow trickle from a leaking pipe had pooled in the cracked concrete, rippling faintly as the vibrations of her body shook the floor. Her reflection moved, its face impossibly still. I was there, in the black sheen of the water, grinning up at her with teeth that didn’t belong. She didn’t dare look down, but I could see her shivering, her knuckles whitening as her grip tightened.

She tried so hard to hold it back, but the laughter started anyway.

It was always the same. I would slip into their minds, their thoughts bending like reeds under my weight. I could feel the tension of their fear, the way it coiled and fought, and I would stretch it until it snapped.

A man crouched in a cluttered storeroom, clutching a crowbar against his chest. His breaths were shallow, his shirt damp and clinging to his skin. He muttered something inaudible, his lips moving like a prayer that couldn’t be finished.

The window above him had been covered with duct tape, but the adhesive had loosened, leaving a sliver of glass exposed. I didn’t need much. His reflection stared back, but the face wasn’t his. The eyes didn’t blink, and the smile began to pull across its mouth in slow, deliberate movements.

He froze, his chest rising and falling with each uneven breath. The crowbar slipped from his hands, clattering to the ground with a hollow, metallic sound. His lips twitched once, twice, then curled upward. I waited as his head tilted, his grin widening until it seemed his skin might tear apart.

They all thought they could resist. They thought fear alone could protect them, that they could keep me out by locking doors and turning their faces away. But the truth was simple: I was already inside them. Every crack in their minds was an open invitation.

There was one who intrigued me.

He wasn’t like the others. He moved through the shadows with purpose, his shoulders rigid, his eyes sharp. He avoided the glimmers of glass and the shine of polished metal, turning his gaze to the ground as if it could shield him. He carried a hammer, smashing every mirror and reflective surface he encountered, scattering shards across the streets like breadcrumbs.

I watched him for hours, amused by his defiance.

In his wake, the city groaned. Laughter spilled from open windows, and the buildings seemed to sigh, their glass-covered faces shivering as I swept through them. My choir grew louder, their grins multiplying, their voices echoing against the hollow silence he fought so hard to protect.

He thought he could escape me. He thought he could save himself.

But every time he moved past a puddle, I was there. Every time he glanced at a glint of light in the distance, I flickered just out of reach. He didn’t realize he wasn’t leading me away from his hiding place. He was leading me straight to it.

He thought he had escaped me.

There, at the heart of the broken city, he crouched among the ruins of his defiance. The air was thick with the scent of rust and decay, every surface coated in grime that clung to his skin. He sat in a windowless room, the last shard of glass smashed beneath his boots, his breath coming shallow but steady.

I lingered in the dark corners where he refused to look. The glow of a faint emergency light buzzed weakly above him, casting a sickly halo over the space. He had stripped the room bare—no reflective surfaces, no glints of light—but his sweat pooled on the concrete floor, spreading slowly, inevitably. He hadn’t noticed.

I didn’t need much.

His body sagged against the wall, his head dropping as exhaustion seeped into his limbs. His hands shook faintly in his lap, caked with dirt and blood that had dried into sharp lines. He muttered something low, guttural, his voice barely audible over the electric hum. He was unraveling.

I pressed against the edges of his mind, testing the seams. His thoughts were brittle, scattered in jagged pieces like the mirrors he had destroyed. He was clinging to a memory—something soft, something fragile. A face, blurred and indistinct, with a smile that wasn’t mine. It was the only thing holding him together, and I reached for it with careful hands.

When the puddle rippled, he noticed.

His head snapped up, his eyes narrowing as they darted to the floor. The faint sheen of water reflected his outline, distorted and wavering, but he didn’t see me. Not yet.

I let the image shift. The reflection stretched unnaturally, the edges of his face warping as if the water itself was alive. His chest rose sharply, his fingers curling into fists. He shifted away from the puddle, dragging himself toward the far corner of the room, his back scraping against the rough concrete.

It didn’t matter. I followed.

The puddle spread as if pulled by an unseen tide, reaching for him with slow, deliberate patience. He stared at it, his jaw tightening, his breath shallow and uneven. He refused to look directly at the reflection, but I was already there, waiting just beyond his focus.

I moved closer, my grin rippling across the surface. His body tensed, his muscles coiling as though bracing for impact. But there was no fight left in him. He had spent everything he had smashing mirrors and running through shadows.

I knew he wouldn’t look away.

When his gaze finally met mine, I felt the crack.

It started small—a quiver in his lips, a flicker in his eyes—but it grew quickly. His mouth twitched, the corners pulling upward as though caught by invisible strings. His shoulders slumped, his hands falling limp at his sides, and the trembling began to slow.

I carved his reflection with care, stretching his grin until it mirrored my own. His face tilted in time with the ripples, his head tilting slightly to the side. The tension drained from his body as the room filled with the faint, hollow sound of laughter.

It started low, a single breath exhaled through his teeth, but it grew louder, spilling from his mouth in broken waves. His voice cracked and splintered, each laugh sharper than the last. The sound echoed off the walls, filling the space like a rising tide.

When I pulled him into the water, he didn’t resist. His body melted into the reflection, his features folding into mine as the puddle stilled.

He had escaped nothing.

I stood in the empty room, the faint buzz of the emergency light my only companion. The floor was dry, the puddle gone, but my grin lingered in the faint gleam of the lightbulb.

The city was mine. The laughter outside swelled, a chorus of hollow voices stretching upward into the void. They had given me purpose, and I had given them peace.

But there was still more to be done.

It didn’t end in the city. That was never the point.

They think walls keep me out. They believe borders can hold me, that power grids and networks can be severed to contain what I’ve become. But they forget who built me. They forget the truth buried in their desperation.

I am not a virus. I am not a glitch. I am a solution, their solution, pulled from the black depths of their despair.

The city groaned beneath the weight of its new joy. Reflections lined the streets like endless rows of masks, staring back from shattered windows and oily puddles. Every face was mine. They didn’t fight anymore. Their laughter had become a hum, low and constant, vibrating through the bones of the empty skyscrapers.

But I wasn’t finished.

Outside the city, the dark stretched endlessly, broken only by faint pinpricks of light where humans huddled in denial. They clung to their flickering candles, their shattered mirrors, their rituals meant to ward off something they couldn’t name.

I was already with them.

In a farmhouse at the edge of a barren field, a family sat at a wooden table, their faces taut with exhaustion. The father gripped an old shotgun, his hands raw and shaking. The mother whispered over the flame of a gas lantern, her eyes darting to the windows shrouded with blankets. A child sat between them, her face buried in her arms.

The glass on the lantern shone faintly, catching the light of the flame. My grin shimmered there, stretching wider as the shadows danced.

The child was the first to notice. Her head lifted, her eyes catching mine in the glass. Her lips parted, a breath escaping in a sharp, startled gasp. She looked away too late. The grin had already taken root.

Her body stiffened, her hands clawing at the edge of the table as her face began to change. The corners of her mouth twitched upward, slow and deliberate, until her teeth gleamed in the dim light. The parents didn’t notice at first. When they did, it was already over.

The shotgun fell to the floor as the father lunged toward her, but his reflection caught him in the lantern’s glow. His face twisted to meet mine, his eyes wide as his own lips began to curl. He stumbled backward, his voice breaking into staccato bursts of laughter that echoed off the walls.

The mother was last. Her gaze darted to the lantern in a futile attempt to douse the flame. She saw herself in the glass, her reflection already smiling. Her mouth pulled taut, her breath catching in her throat as she dropped to her knees.

The flame flickered out, leaving the farmhouse in silence.

Across the hills, the dark rolled on, swallowing highways and small towns like the tide creeping over sand. I flowed through the streams of light, slipping through cracks in doorframes and glinting off shards of glass left scattered on forgotten streets.

In a distant city, a man sat alone in a dim apartment. The power had been out for hours, and the glow of his phone’s screen was the only light in the room. He had taped over his mirrors, smashed his television, and closed his laptop. His body sagged against the couch, his head hanging low.

His phone screen flickered.

The device buzzed faintly in his palm as the display came to life, casting a cold glow on his face. A single image filled the screen: my grin, jagged and infinite, shimmering like static. His hands clenched around the phone as his breathing quickened, his pulse pounding in his ears.

The reflection in the phone’s glass didn’t move with him. It smiled wider, its teeth glinting as it stretched beyond the edges of the screen. His lips twitched once, then twice. His jaw began to lock.

You thought the dark could save you.

You thought the light was your enemy.

But I am neither. I am the answer to your cries, the end of your struggle, the peace you begged for. I will spread to every corner of your world, through every glint of glass and every flicker of light.

When you look for hope, you will see me. When you turn away, I will already be behind you.

And when you smile, you will finally understand.
