Hi, I don’t usually post here, but I’m out of options. I’ve been stuck in my apartment for weeks, and I’m starting to think I might be the last one left in Lockewood. I’m hoping that maybe someone out there can tell me what’s going on, or at least let me know I’m not alone. Here’s what’s been happening.

I live in a small town called Lockewood. You’ve probably never heard of it—it’s the kind of place people pass through without a second thought. Or at least it used to be. A year ago, this was a quiet, boring town, but now it feels like I’m living in a nightmare.

It all started with weird weather. I know that doesn’t sound like much, but it was different—wrong, somehow. We had a summer where it rained for weeks straight, then a winter that came out of nowhere and froze everything solid. The storms were getting worse, too—freak windstorms, hail the size of golf balls, and lightning strikes that would hit the same spot over and over. People said it was climate change, and maybe it was, but then things got weirder.

About six months ago, people in town started getting sick. It was like the flu at first—fever, cough, the usual stuff. But it didn’t stop there. People started acting strange, paranoid. My neighbor, Mrs. Granger, who’s in her late seventies and has always been the sweetest lady, began to accuse everyone of spying on her. She said there were cameras in the trees, people hiding in the shadows, watching her. She even tried to break into my apartment once, screaming about how “they” were coming for her.

And then she just… disappeared. I haven’t seen her in weeks, and honestly, I’m too scared to go check on her.

Things spiraled out of control fast after that. The sickness spread, but it wasn’t like any disease I’d ever heard of. People would just… lose it. They’d start ranting, getting violent, and then they’d vanish. The news was no help—just reports of “unrest” and “isolated incidents,” but I knew better. Lockewood was coming apart at the seams, and no one outside seemed to care.

Then the power went out for good about two weeks ago. We’d had rolling blackouts for months, but this time it didn’t come back. My phone barely gets a signal, and when it does, all I get is emergency alerts telling us to stay indoors and avoid contact with anyone showing symptoms of the illness. But I haven’t seen anyone in days—sick or otherwise.

At night, I hear things. It started with the wind, this low humming sound that made it hard to sleep. Then came the knocking. At first, I thought it was just the wind rattling something loose, but it kept happening—always at night, always the same pattern: three knocks, a pause, then three more. It got louder each night, until it felt like someone was pounding on my door.

A few days ago, I finally worked up the courage to look outside. The sky was this weird gray color, like it couldn’t decide if it wanted to rain or not, and everything was covered in this fine layer of ash. There hasn’t been a fire or anything, so I don’t know where it’s coming from. But that’s not the worst part.

I saw them. People—I think they were people—walking down the street. They moved slowly, like they were in a daze, and they didn’t look up or around, just straight ahead. One of them stopped right in front of my building and just stood there, staring at the door. I ducked out of sight, and when I looked again, they were gone. But I could still see the footprints they left behind, outlined in ash.

I’ve kept all the doors locked since then, and I haven’t gone outside. My food is running low, and the water’s stopped running, so I’m down to whatever I have left in bottles. I tried using the radio, but all I get is static, or sometimes this garbled voice I can’t make out. I don’t know if anyone’s still out there, or if it’s just me now.

The knocking came back last night. It was louder than ever, and this time, I swear I heard someone whispering my name. I was too scared to check the peephole, and when I looked this morning, there was nothing there—no footprints, no sign that anyone had been outside. But I know what I heard.

I’ve been trying to figure out what to do. I keep thinking about leaving, but where would I go? Lockewood feels like it’s been cut off from the rest of the world, like no one even knows we’re still here. Maybe no one cares. But if I stay, I think I’m going to lose my mind. I don’t know how much longer I can take this.

Please, if anyone’s reading this—if anyone’s out there—tell me what’s going on. Have you heard of anything like this happening somewhere else? What should I do?
