“You should feel it,” he said with an extraordinarily evil look on his face. To say I was scared was an understatement.

To say Dick was pissed was also an understatement. It was a chaotic day, a hot day in August, and tonight Dick had found his son, 21 years old, non responsive in the basement. Dead. Like cold and dead. And unlike the previous nights in August, this night wouldn’t bring with it cooler temperatures. This would be a night of hell.

The only thing I kept thinking of was how the fuck was I going to get out of this without going to prison?

Now Dick, Dr. Dick but most of his patients called him Dr. Deez Nutz, spoke.

“Go put on the red lingerie Kathy. Do it now,” he said. This wasn’t going to be easy. Dick was a big guy and not one who you wanted to be sexually frustrated with you. Then I saw Dick start fucking with his camera equipment. I knew whatever dirty thing he did to me would be on that recording. That part I thought I could handle. I was wrong. 

I went upstairs and put on the lingerie, the lingerie that was supposed to be for a celebration, the red lingerie. Goddamit why did his son Rick have to fucking ruin everything? We were supposed to get married…now that seemed very far away. I was supposed to be his next wife. His ex-wife. How many times had she called wanting me to check on him? Was it 4 or 5? I needed to keep my story straight for the police. The truth was I never did check on him. I had better things to do and honestly I didn’t care. I hated Rick. I thought he was a loser that didn’t appreciate anything his father did for him. Surely, Dick would forgive me. I would do whatever sexual thing he wanted tonight. I can fix this, I thought.

I went downstairs and I saw Dick standing there next to the fireplace. The fire was lit and the room was dark. At first I thought he had the poker in his hand but then I saw it was a whip. He knew I hated to be whipped. 

“Do you know what happens to the brain during an overdose Kathy”, he asked me very calmly.

“No,” I replied. I was never a good student in school but I did have the looks.

“It suffocates because no air can get to the brain. The person then suffocates,” he said. Rick’s dead body was on the couch about 3 feet away. All of a sudden I felt like running out of there and never coming back. I should’ve. 

“Do you know what it’s like to suffocate Kathy?” He asked me.

“No,” I said.

“How many times were you asked to check on him?” Dick asked me.

“It was either 4 or 5 but I did check on him I swear….” I lied and he held up his hand and told me to shut the fuck up. 

“Get on the bed…on all 4’s Kathy,” he said.

Fuck.

He whipped me and whipped me and then he started fucking me, and he recorded everything. I was crying and I felt so ashamed. I hated his son Rick. I would always hate him. I even said a prayer that Rick could see what his father was doing to me and when I said that I felt a wave of piece come over me. My prayer would be answered I knew it.

“You know the dead can see everything. He can see what you’re doing right now, “ I said. I said it because I wanted him to stop, but he wasn’t done.

“Oh they can, can they, “ Dr. Fucking Dick said.

He grabbed a rope. Wtf was that for?

He put it around my neck and then he said again, “You should feel it. How it feels to suffocate.”

“Now how many times was it Kathy, that you were told to check on him?”

“4,” I replied. You can guess what happened next, and the whole thing was recorded.

“If you tell anyone what I did to you, I’ll put this video all over the internet and I’ll turn you into the police for not checking on my son” He explained.

“Dick can we turn on the air; it’s really hot in here,” I asked. What he said next horrified and terrified me at the same time.

“Kathy do you realize the situation you have put me in? My son can’t die today. I’ll lose custody of our daughter. My ex-wife told me to check on him all day and I trusted you to do that. My son has to die tomorrow. In order for that to happen, time of death can’t be determined. In order for time of death not to be determined, temperature has to be hot to speed up rigor mortis so it might smell like trash. And if you can’t leave, unless you can figure out how to get those handcuffs off. Do you think it’s normal to light fires in August Kathy? God you are so dumb. It’s a good thing you look good. If you don’t want to go to jail, deal with it you cunt.”

“Oh and Kathy? He said. Oh God what does he want now, I thought? “You better hope the dead can’t see like you said, because we’re both in a lot of trouble if that’s true.” He said and when he said it the hairs stood up on the back of my neck.

But the dead can see. I know that because I’m not the woman in the story. I’m just the messenger for Rick who wants the date on his grave changed from August 13 to August 12.

Dr. Dick doesn’t want to do that. That’s why Rick visited me on the night he died 4 years ago. He wants me to tell his story because he can’t.
