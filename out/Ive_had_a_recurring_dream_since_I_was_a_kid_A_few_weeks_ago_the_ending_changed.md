The dream never began with anything particularly noteworthy. Sometimes when I woke up I remembered little bits of the beginning, these quick ideas about being lost or aimless in a strange city. A sense that I needed to get off the street and find safety indoors flickered in the back part of my awareness, so I hurried through the nearest door. Often times, I didn’t remember the first part too much. But the middle act always stayed with me, the part where I had to run. 

Something followed me, kept pace just out of my range of vision. I sprinted away from it, through a labyrinth of interconnecting buildings. An ancient library flowed into a rotting hospital, which led to a huge array of unoccupied cubicles lit by dying fluorescent lights. The path changed, circled back, refused to make any sense by the standards of the waking world. And, really, the choices I made didn’t matter anyway. In the end it always caught me. I never saw it but sensed it gaining on me. A terrible thing that would never stop. It could chase me forever. Closer, closer, here. My stomach dropped, and I woke up. 

It used to bother me. In childhood I often slept with the lights on, not out of fear of the dark but because I was always trying to put off falling asleep. This was before we had internet, so I spent the nights reading mostly. Eventually I would succumb to exhaustion, pass out face down on a tattered paperback, and the forgotten lamp would coat my room in its dim yellow light until morning. It’s weird how even a little lost sleep makes you detach a bit from reality. I meandered through my boyhood in a haze of sleeplessness. Later I tried medications, both legal and, ahem, less legal to see if I could stamp the dream out. Of course, nothing worked.

Much later, when adulthood extinguished the jumpiness of childhood, I stopped minding the dream so much. I became a man, got married, got a good job. In all the busyness of day to day life I was too tired for nightmares. On the off night I did happen to find myself in my dream city, at least I knew where I was, what I had to do, what would happen. I even woke up with a kind of strange comfort, the ease of familiarity. After all, it was just a bad dream. I outgrew my fear. In light of what’s happened, I wonder if that’s why it waited so long to show me its face. Maybe it wanted to lull me into a state of blissful unbelief.  Or perhaps it needed to get me alone.

Eventually I started running in real life. It’s kind of a chicken or the egg thing when I look back on it now. I’m not sure if the dream inspired me, or if it was my own tendency toward the flight part of “flight or fight.” Whatever the reason, around my fortieth birthday I bought a pair of very expensive sneakers and took off. 

Ok, maybe “took off” is not the right phrase. I plodded off. Running, it turned out, was harder than I remembered. But I had time to get better. COVID lock downs forced my company to embrace remote work, and without the drive time I had a couple extra hours on my hands. 

My wife also had a couple extra hours on her hands. She used those hours to find an attorney and become not my wife anymore. I could have resisted, stretched out the process a little more, but I didn’t. I signed everything she handed me. I figured we’d had a good run. We’d never fought before, no need to start now. 

Now I had even more spare time. 

My runs stretched out into whole afternoons of wandering around the admittedly not great neighborhood that surrounded my also not great new apartment. After a couple miles at a brisk pace (by my standards) I would walk slowly, dreading the return to my empty living room. 

The building I’d moved into after the divorce used to be some kind of warehouse. It’s down by the old port and the decommissioned navy base. The city calls this area “up and coming.” Really it’s mostly abandoned buildings interspersed with the occasional rusty silo. A muddy river runs through it to the Atlantic, with little branches of creeks and marshlands splintering off now and then.

Whoever designed my building tried to carry the industrial look over into the apartments. When I first looked at it with the building’s sales lady, she made a point to coo over the original brick and exposed pipes. Even at opposite ends of the room (social distancing) we were maximally ten feet away from each other. I could see her surgical mask puff out when she spoke. The exposed pipes running across the ceiling made it feel even more claustrophobic. I hated to see the insides of things. It felt like looking at a wound.

I told the sales lady that Rachel would have hated it. She asked softly who Rachel was, and I said my wife, then corrected and said well she used to be. Then I realized from the look on the top half of her face that she thought Rachel was dead. My words fell over each other. I could see them piling up and tangling behind my own mask, one of those cheap black fabric ones you could get off Amazon. The whole situation kind of got away from me, and I suddenly found myself signing a one year lease for an apartment that looked and felt like the setting of one of the Saw movies. 

On the way to my car the triumphant sales lady told me the building had many single residents. Right on cue, a blonde girl with a bouncy ponytail popped out of the door behind us. She smiled politely as she walked past then broke into a light jog down the broken sidewalk. Maybe this wouldn’t be so bad after all. 

But before I had time to wax poetic to myself about new starts, an impossibly frail man creaked past on an old bicycle. He wore a tattered suit, capped off by a jaunty motorcycle helmet which appeared to weigh about a hundred pounds. It was the only part of his ensemble that looked new, a pattern of patriotic stars and stripes shining in the golden evening light. His head lolled on his shoulders as his neck struggled with the weight of it. He had somehow rigged several clear plastic bags stuffed to the brim with cans to the back of the bike. They rustled against each other as he pedaled past us. 

I think he nodded at the sales lady, but it was hard to tell if it was intentional or just the weight of the helmet pulling his head down. She glanced briefly at him, then turned to hustle back to her office.

A block away the blonde girl had stopped in the middle of the sidewalk for a quick quad stretch, so the can man had to bump off the curb into the gutter to avoid her. It would be an easy maneuver for someone less rickety, but I thought for sure this guy would wind up sprawled in the road, cans everywhere. Somehow he pulled it off. For a moment the stars and stripes of his helmet turned her way ever so slightly. Then he kept on riding, cans rustling into the distance. The girl didn’t take much notice of him. In a moment, she ran off. Her neon pink running shoes flashed away in the glow of the sunset.



A few days later I moved in my small but growing collection of Ikea furniture and the few odds and ends I’d hung on to in the divorce. Between the masks and the social distancing, there was no possibility of meeting anyone either in the building or out of it. We couldn’t even share the elevator. At some point the management had put up a sign restricting it to one household per trip. The loneliness compounded when I gradually discovered the group of friends I had accumulated over the years were all actually Rachel’s friends. Things became very quiet in my world.

I tried to embrace the enforced asceticism of my new lifestyle. This was the perfect opportunity for me to finally embrace the self-improvement ideals I always scrolled past on TikTok. COVID couldn’t go on forever, and when it ended I would be ready, a new man. I filled my fridge with bagged salads and the healthiest looking TV dinners at the store. I tracked my weight and muscle density on an app. At night, I read self help books while the filtered sounds of laughter from the apartment next door drifted in through the vents. I even got a journal, although I never could think of anything to put in it.

The only self care task I really enjoyed was the running. I ran every day, mostly after work, but before the sun went down. By the end of summer my mile time had dipped under the ten minute mark, and I felt like I was really on my way to something. Occasionally I saw the woman I’d mentally nicknamed “Ponytail” out running in the early evenings too. She went a lot faster than me. 

I always took the same route. Turning right out of my building took me to a train yard with a high fence, so I went left. On the inland side of the road I could see the collapsing roofs of the old navy base, and on the water side I passed mostly rehabilitated warehouses much like the one I’d come out of. There were docks on the other side of those buildings, but I couldn’t see them without venturing off the main road. The farther I went from home, the less rehabilitated the structures became, until I hit a row of fully abandoned depots. I crossed three rusted steel bridges over tidal creeks, then turned back when I hit a series of huge silos that still seemed to be in use. This path took me about three miles away, then I used the three miles back to delay sitting by myself in the confinement of my apartment.  

It wasn’t the best part of town, but despite the intermittent reports I saw on the news, I never worried too much about my safety. The only thing that gave me pause was the traffic. Not many cars drove through the area, but those that did far exceeded the limits, like they were trying to escape as quickly as possible. But I stayed diligent about checking before crossing and I never wore headphones while running, so I could hear approaching vehicles.    



One evening on the edge between fall and winter I saw something that brought my run to a full stop. It stood between two low, boarded-up warehouses just before the no-mans-land of the rusted bridges, a concrete structure I hadn’t seen before. I remembered the red corrugated siding of the building to its right and the broken windows of the place to the left. How had I never noticed this behemoth in the middle? The sun had already dropped from view, leaving weak gray light behind, but it was enough to reveal a looming edifice of smooth concrete. No windows interrupted the walls of deep charcoal stone, and I couldn’t see any doors for entry from where I stood either. The dappled texture of old water stains dripped down from the roof, but otherwise I couldn’t see any kind of clue as to the purpose of the building.  

It stood at least five or so stories tall, including the steeply pitched roof, but the facade was narrower than you would expect for a building that size. At the far end of the roof line I could see a cluster of jagged spires, probably some kind of smokestacks, but in  context they looked like the remains of a broken off steeple. I found myself picturing a few disparate places I’d been and trying to put them together to make sense of it—the shape of the big cathedral in the nearest city, the industrial chutes and ladders of the paper mill across the river, the hopelessness of the brutalist memorials I saw on a college tour of eastern Europe.  

The pavement surrounding the church/factory/monument looked cracked and pitted in the usual way for this part of town. Despite this, someone had kept the lot immaculately clean. Typical roadside debris had gathered in the surroundings of both the neighboring buildings, but I could see invisible barriers where some caretaker had removed all the trash from the ground surrounding the mystery building right up to each property line. 

I don’t consider myself some kind of urban spelunker, but the longer I stood there the more I wanted to cross over onto that clean pavement, to explore a little, if only to see where the door to the building was. I would have, too, but just before I stepped into the road a truck blew past, inches from my face. In my effort to avoid getting hit, I over balanced and landed sprawled across the sidewalk. 

I haven’t fallen down much as an adult, and it took me a minute to get myself together enough to start trying to get up again. By the time I’d attained the dignity of a seated position, I heard a kind of whispery sound behind me, coming up fast. I flinched again, imagining another truck bearing down on me. But I whipped around only to see the curved figure of the can man. He pedaled as fast as he could, the stars on his helmet bobbing wildly. I could hear his breath whistle from exertion, as his cans jostled and rustled along. 

When he got close, he hopped off the bike with surprising nimbleness. He dropped it—cans and all—on the grass next to the sidewalk, like a kid who just rode up to a friend’s house. It took him some effort to struggle out of the helmet. Once he finally freed himself he shook his head a little, looked at me, down the road where the truck had gone, then back at me.

“Got-damn!” he said. His voice sounded younger than he looked.

He had a crumpled face, sun dried, and a gold tooth that glinted when he talked. His eyes had once been blue. He asked if I was alright, and I said I thought so. For a moment he offered his hand to me before thinking better of it, probably worried about germs. He wiped it on his shirt before stepping back a pace. I struggled to my feet on my own. On inspection I had scuffed up my elbow and the opposing hand. When I stood up and stayed vertical, the can man turned and started to shuffle back to his bike.  He hefted the helmet back onto his head. For a moment the black visor of his helmet reflected a warped version of the strange building across the street, and it occurred to me that he might know something about it, being an old timer and all.

“Hey what was this tall stone building for?” I asked, a little too loudly.

He stopped walking, and stood totally still for a moment. 

The silence bore down on me, so I talked some more. 

“I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything like it. No windows or doors. Can’t be up to code.” 

He turned a little. I could feel his faded blue eyes staring at me from behind the helmet.

When he spoke, the words came out muffled and strange. I could swear what he said was, “You see it.”

I said, “What?” and then he turned to me.

“It’s nothing,” he said, “There’s nothing in there.” 

He paused, seemed to consider his next move. Suddenly he stepped closer, until he was far closer than I would have wanted, even in the pre-COVID days. I could see myself reflected in his visor then, somehow smaller and paler than I remembered. He spoke so softly and quickly, I could barely make it out. Something in the rough softness of his voice made me want to listen carefully. 

“It’s nothing in there. Nothing. The dark places are not meant for little creatures like us. Forget you ever saw it. Forget it.” 

Then he wheeled around, and started back to the bike before he stopped again. 

This time, he spoke a little louder, as if that would help me understand. As he spoke, he shook his head mournfully. The stars on his helmet swayed side to side. 

“If you do see it, don’t touch it,” he said.

“Don’t touch what?” I asked. The stars still swung back and forth. I could feel myself getting lightheaded.

He scoffed a little at the question before he answered, like it was something I should already know. 

“Do not touch the hem of the garment, the cloak. And whatever you do, stay out of the water.”

Then he turned, and grabbed the bike, and pedaled back the way he had come, looking over his shoulder now and then like something could chase after him at any moment. Nothing did. 



That night I dreamed of being chased again. The rooms of my dream city flowed together like they always did. I passed through a dormitory full of empty beds, an algae infested indoor swimming pool, a grocery store populated by scuttling insects, places I’d seen a thousand times before. But then, somehow, I found myself somewhere new. At the end of a dark hallway I found these two huge, curved doors. They rose up from the shadows, and as I got closer I could see the spotted marks of old water stains. They were closed. 

When I reached them, I swept my hands over their surface and confirmed my initial impression—smooth concrete. If there was a way to open them, I couldn’t find it. In the darkness of the hall behind me, I could feel the thing that chased me approaching, faster every breath. Even when I pushed frantically, the doors didn’t budge.

In all these years this was the first time I ever encountered a door I couldn’t open in my dream. Whatever chased after me always caught me, but whenever it happened before I’d always been running. I had never been trapped in one spot, a fish in a barrel. As the sensation of doom poured over me, I closed my eyes and curled against the cold stone of the doors. A high pitched squeal pressed into my eardrums, and I woke up. It took me a moment to realize the source of the sound was my own voice. I’d screamed myself awake.

It turned out I’d screamed the neighbors awake too. They didn’t love it. The next morning I got a strongly worded warning email from the building’s management. I recognized the name at the bottom as the sales lady from before. I guess she got promoted. Good for her. 



As winter crept in things quieted down again. Every few nights I woke up gasping for air, after getting trapped at the stone doors again. It felt a little distressing, but in all I didn’t think that much of it. I’d had this nightmare all my life, and the bulk of it remained the same. I guess I assumed the presence of the stone doors was just some new mental quirk, my brain solving some kind of subconscious problem. Between the tiny apartment and the isolation of COVID and the divorce and, well, all of it, I did feel fairly trapped in my waking life. Of course it had poured over into my sleep. 

The problem of the mysterious concrete building remained. I tried to look into its history, but beyond the address and the fact of the structure’s existence, I couldn’t find much else. Some corporation owned it, but the numbers I could find online didn’t work, and they didn’t have a web presence of any sort. Someone definitely maintained the lot, but I never saw anyone there. Occasionally I even tried mixing up the time I ran, just to see if anyone would be there in the morning or afternoon, but still nobody was ever around. I did learn one thing of value. The ponytail girl in her pink sneakers seemed to mostly run early in the morning. I started to get up earlier.

Sometimes I would see her shoes off in the distance, but most mornings our paths crossed in the stairwell. Her apartment must have been on the floor above mine, because she would be heading up as I headed down. Sometimes when that happened, she smiled at me, or at least I think she did. Her eyes would crinkle up above her mask. After a few weeks of mutual nodding, I’d worked up the courage to say good morning to her, or comment on the weather, real Casanova type stuff. I knew the likelihood of ever moving our “relationship” beyond hallway pleasantries was unlikely, especially considering my paralyzing shyness. Still, having any social interaction to look forward to felt good. I hoped she felt the same way, but at the very least she often would be the first to say good morning as she bounded up the stairs.

A few weeks before Christmas, I was disappointed to realize I hadn’t seen her for a few days. I figured her running schedule must have changed. The mornings were getting pretty cold, midday would be a more comfortable time. Then I didn’t see her when I ran on lunch either, so I figured she’d gone out of town. Maybe she went home for the holidays. I got in touch with my parents with a similar idea in mind, but they didn’t want to risk the exposure.



I was on a lunch run when I spotted a pink sneaker at the back corner of the windowless building. I stopped, back at the place on the sidewalk where I’d met the can man weeks before. The sneaker lay on its side, one lace trailing out, reaching toward me. A trickle of intuition crept in my belly, but my feet carried me across the street. It felt colder next to the spotted concrete wall. I could see my breath when I bent over to pick up the shoe. It had to be hers. I would recognize that shade of neon pink anywhere. For some reason I felt the need to be covert, but I didn’t see anyone out back. I poked my head as far around the corner as I could, and from my position I still couldn't see any doors or windows. Behind the lot the river had that thick glassy look water gets just before it freezes. I shook myself off. There was only one place left to look.

I let out a sigh of relief when I didn’t see anything in the river. Between the retaining walls on either side, the water sat stagnant and empty. I don’t know what I’d expected, maybe a bloated blonde corpse like something from CSI. I did notice a little structure at the base of the retaining wall where I stood, a culvert or something. Maybe when this building had a function they had some drainage pipe set up to run into the river. It was hard to say. I took the shoe with me and headed back to my building.

I stopped in at the management office first. The sales lady was the only one working that day, and the significance of the pink sneaker seemed to elude her. When I explained it belonged to a woman from the third floor, she said there wasn’t a woman on the third floor.

“Those apartments haven’t moved yet,” she said. “We’ve been working from the ground up to minimize noise issues.”

I stammered a little while I tried to collect my thoughts. 

“She was here when I had my tour over the summer. She walked by right when we were leaving the building?” It wasn’t a question, but I phrased it as one.

The sales lady shrugged and smiled.

“She definitely lives here, the blonde girl. I see her out running all the time,” I said.

“There aren’t any young women in this building currently. Maybe she lives in one of the properties down the road,” she said. She held up empty palms.

My brain struggled to reboot itself. The sales lady checked her watch and apologized for not being able to help. She looked at the door expectantly. I could tell she was ready for me to leave, so I did. In my hand the shoe felt a little too heavy. I wandered up to the third floor. The air up there smelled stale. Construction dust coated all the surfaces. I could see it on every doorknob. Nobody lived up here. I asked around on my floor, but none of my neighbors knew her either. I’d hit an impasse, so I went home to finish my work day and consider my next move.



After work I ate a Lean Cuisine on my couch, Swedish meatballs in a congealed sauce, and stared at the pink shoe. I’d left it by the door, next to my running shoes, a pair of battered gray Altras. The pink shoe had held up a lot better than my shoes over these past months. It still looked brand new. 

It took me a long time to fall asleep that night. Things felt off. My world seemed to have slipped out of line, and I could feel everything beginning to separate. It was almost a relief when I found myself running through my dream city again. I passed by the usual places. Behind me, whatever chased me matched my pace. But when I came to the great stone doors, I discovered one of them was ajar. For a moment I stopped. I couldn’t see what waited inside. Back down the dark hallway, a shadow shifted toward me, and the need to move took precedence over my hesitation. I plunged into the darkness, turned and pushed the door shut behind me.

It took a second for my eyes to adjust to the darkness. I realized I stood in the narthex of some kind of church. Two rows of stone pews flanked a center aisle. Something big slammed into the doors behind me. I looked over my shoulder, but the stone slabs seemed able hold up against the weight of whatever was trying to get in, for now. I moved down the aisle, searching the walls for another set of doors, any way out. Near the altar, I found something else. It was a little pool of dark water, maybe six feet in diameter, and in the center of it the pink running shoe floated on its side. The image of a cartoon carrot under a box propped up with a stick came to me. Even in my fog of dream logic, it felt like a trap. I don’t know why I reached for it.

I leaned out and tried not to touch the water itself. Just as my fingers brushed the nylon fabric, my foot slipped. I fell in. The cold of the water pressed in on my chest, and despite my attempts at kicking my feet I felt myself sinking down. Finally I woke up gasping for air, drenched in cold sweat. No, not sweat. Murky water ran off me in rivulets. It smelled strange, like musty perfume.

The apartment felt simultaneously too big and too small. My throat and chest burned, and my stomach turned over at the sensation of the damp sheets on my skin. I stripped the bed and wandered through the living room to get a drink and collect myself, intending to shower, maybe watch some TV to pass the time until breakfast. I stopped by the front door. The real pink shoe was gone.

I put my own shoes on, and stepped out into the dark corridor. I think I’d intended on a quick look around the building. Through the haze of sleeplessness I thought potentially an intruder might have taken the shoe from my apartment. Maybe I would see them and come up with some piece of evidence I could take to the police. As quickly as it came to me the idea faded, and I found myself jogging down the stairs. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I knew there was no thief to chase after. I just wanted to run. My feet took over, and soon I’d made my way down the road. The farther I ran, the faster I went, and by the time I realized where I was going, I was already standing in front of the concrete building trying to catch my breath. 

It looked bigger against the depth of the night sky. As I crossed the street to approach it, I smelled something strange and burning, like rotten incense. The closer I got to the concrete face of the building, the stronger the scent became. I had to consciously pull the thick, caustic air into my lungs. I looked up, trying to trace the source of the smoke, and for a moment I saw this wave of blackness tumbling down over the sky. It looked as though some celestial giant had drawn a curtain over the universe. Even the moon disappeared behind the billowing dark. 



A scratchy, squeaking rustle worked its way into my ear, and I opened my eyes. Pink morning light ignited a series of pains which ultimately led to a source at the back of my head. I realized I was sprawled on my back on the sidewalk. The noise came closer, and after a few moments the gnarled face of the can man filled my vision.

“Well shit,” he said, “Can you stand up?”

I groaned. His fingers worked their way into my armpits and he lugged me to a seated position. On the way up I felt my hair peel off the sidewalk like an old bandaid, and I reached up to prod a mass of congealed blood at the place where my head must have hit the ground. The can man crouched to look into my eyes. 

“Listen, we got to move. We’re too close.” He looked over his shoulder, as if checking to make sure the strange, doorless building hadn’t crept toward us. He threw my arm over his shoulder and heaved until I was vertical enough to hobble to the other side of the road. He settled me on the grass and went to pull out a giant Nokia brick phone. It had a tie-die snap on cover.

“Wait,” I said. I pawed at the phone, pushing it away from him. “What do you know about that place?” I pointed back to the building. 

He shook his head and said, “You need a doctor.”

“Is there a way to get in there?” I asked.

He frowned and started to mess with the old phone again. He seemed to be trying to turn it on, pressing every button aside from the one he needed. I grabbed for his arm.

“Listen, I think something happened to her.”

He stopped and looked at me. “To who?”

“The girl. The blonde girl with the pink shoes. I think she’s in there.”

He scoffed before brushing my hand away. An idea came to me.

“You saw her. When I first came here. You had to ride into the gutter, because she was stretching in the sidewalk. The people at the building said they’d never seen her, but you did. I know you did. I found her shoe over there yesterday.” I pointed to the spot. “But this morning it was gone, and,” I trailed off. “What is that place?”

He stared at me for a long moment before speaking. “One time I saw this thing on TV, they went down deep in the ocean. Bunch of scientists took a submarine down to the sea floor, I guess.” 

I tried to interrupt, but he waved me off. 

“It’s dark at the bottom. Sun can’t reach. There’s a big fish down there with a little light on a string, and it dangles the light out until the little fish come to see it, then snap.” He made his hands into two closing jaws. 

“I know what an angler fish is,” I said, exasperated. 

Mentally I scolded myself for thinking this unwell man on a bike full of trash could help me. The world spun around me, and I sat down.

“That place,” he nodded his head across the street, “is the fish. And the girl is the light.”

I tried to shake my head, but the motion set off a series of spinning explosions, so I stopped and laid myself out on the grass. The can man sighed. He finally found the button to turn the phone on. 

“What do you think it’s like,” he asked, “being a little fish down there in the dark?”

I closed my eyes as I heard him dialing 911. His old phone still made the beeping noises out loud.

“I bet it’s lonesome. You see a light like that, looks pretty good. Even if it’s not real, it would feel good swimming towards it, hoping to see another fish maybe, maybe not to be all alone in the dark. Yeah, I found a guy on the sidewalk down by the bricked up church. He don’t look too good.”

I felt myself start to drift away.

“It’s a church?” I asked.

Darkness closed in, and I heard the can man’s voice somewhere far away. 

“It used to be.”



A cold pressure along my spine woke me up. I found myself back in a seated position, this time in near total dark. A sweeping feeling of disorientation nearly knocked me over again, but I caught myself on the stone edge of my seat. I was back in the chapel, this time in one of the concrete pews, at the front left side to be precise. Behind me I heard the pounding of something huge on the doors. As I moved to stand up, water dripped from my clothes and pooled on the floor beneath me. 

At the altar a candle flickered. Had it been lit before? I couldn’t remember. It looked like it had nearly burned itself out, only an inch of wax remained. In the wavering light I could see a trail of water leading from the little baptismal pool to the seat where I’d woken up. Something banged into the doors again, frantically now, and I got up to move to the altar. As I stood by the little candle I scanned the walls around me, looking for any opening I’d missed before, any avenue of escape. I even looked up, and noticed how the walls seemed to stretch skyward forever, disappearing into heavy black shadows, which seemed to condense into an ultimate darkness behind the altar. I couldn’t even see the back wall from where I stood, even though logically it would be nearby, maybe a few feet away. I picked up the stub of candle. It had been left on a little dish of cut crystal, which I cradled in my palm. The warmth of the pooled wax in the dish comforted me. I held it up and crept forward. 

I realized I could detect a texture in the blackness ahead of me. With each small step a network of lines resolved into a kind of rough order. It was fabric, some kind of heavy curtains draped from the ceiling until they pooled on the floor at my feet. I surged forward, picturing some new way through to the other side. My outstretched hand brushed the fabric. I barely felt it really, a sensation of roughness at the tips of my fingers, before I realized I had made a terrible mistake. 

The fabric rippled and billowed away from my hand, like when you drop a rock in a puddle. Overhead something massive shifted and groaned. The ground shook. It felt like everything around me started moving, and I stumbled backward. If the floor hadn’t been smooth stone I would have lost my balance. As it was I barely managed to stay upright. I realized everything wasn’t moving, just the partition ahead of me, the black fabric. It was so huge it just made it feel like the world was shifting. The darkness rippled and billowed, and turned. As it turned, I found myself looking up, and up, and as my eyes tracked upwards my brain caught up to what I was seeing, just a little too slowly. 

I hadn’t touched a curtain. That much was clear to me now. Somewhere overhead a shape began to take form. Shoulders tapering up, some kind of pointed hood or hat, it all fractured, and I couldn’t quite figure it all together again. From the top of the massive head, a cowl flowed down, like a child pretending to be a ghost, or the veil of a bride. Something huge waited here, a giant covered and alone in the dark. And with my touch, I had drawn its attention. This figure the size of a mountain turned its head and looked down. It saw me. 

It saw me. 



I’m home again now. I was in the hospital for a couple days. The doctor said I would recover in a few weeks time. It’s funny though, after I got back, my whole apartment building emptied out. Each day I saw less and less people around. Even the sales lady stopped coming in to work. For a while, my car was the only one in the parking lot. I wonder if it’s still out there.

It’s darker out too, or maybe the nights are longer. It’s hard to tell. Time seems to get away from me more and more lately. Winter arrived, and the days kept shortening until they pretty much disappeared. I can’t remember the last time the sun came up. When I last looked out the window, the streetlights all seemed to have gone out. Even the moon was gone.

I don't run anymore. The ground and the sky have flattened out into two dark planes that seem to go on forever. There’s only one place left to go out there, one building on the horizon, one person waiting inside to see me again. So I stay in. It turns out there are worse things than being alone.

Sometimes I can still get my computer working, at least for now, so that’s why I’m writing this. It’s a long shot, but if you see the can man, will you tell him I’m here? Tell him what happened. Maybe he can help me. And if he can’t help, tell him he was right. It’s lonely down here in the dark.
