“The world’s going to end tomorrow, you know.”

I looked at my grandfather’s wrinkled face and sighed. “No it’s not. We’ve been over this for-”

“Twelve years,” he interrupted. “I’ve been saying it for twelve years.” He looked down at the antique wooden box in his hands, opening the tiny door just a crack to peek inside. 

“Yes,” I groaned. “The same date, over and over again. Frankly, I’m looking forward to this being finished.” I leaned closer. “After tomorrow comes and goes, and we’re still here, can you promise never to talk about this again?”

He gave me a dark stare and a grin that did not reach his eyes. “Of course,” he promised, taking a long sip of his whiskey. “Never again.”

Two days later, the world was still spinning. 

Then I got the call from my mom, and my world stopped. 

*

He had tripped at the top of an escalator and gotten trapped in its teeth. Doctors call it “degloving.” The metal edges had peeled off most of his wrinkly skin like the flesh of a rotten peach. His entire head looked like the saucy part beneath pizza cheese. 

He was still alive and screaming when the paramedics got to him.

*

“He left me the trailer. Collections agencies took everything else.”

I folded my arms and looked away from my mother, nodding, wanting the conversation to end.

“Except for the clock. He left it to you.”

“What?” I asked, looking up. “What clock?”

Sitting on the desk next to my mom was his antique wooden box.

*

“Don’t open it,” my wife warned. 

I smiled and looked down at the box. “Why not? I saw Grandpa stare into this thing a hundred times, and I always wondered what it was.”

“Maybe there’s a reason you weren’t supposed to see it.”

“Too late,” I snapped, looking inside. 

A scrolling digital roll gazed back at me. It didn’t give the time; instead, it read “19 years, 13 days.”

It was a countdown.

“I told you not to open it,” my wife warned, wiping her eye. “I’m afraid that there will be a horrifying consequence to this action.”

*

Nineteen years and twelve days passed. “Well?” I asked Erin, pointing at the clock. “Do you still think the world’s going to end? We’ve both gotten a little grayer, but other than that, I feel fan-fucking-tastic.”

She shot a sour look and turned away. “Just avoid any escalators, okay?”

*

I stayed away from escalators on the day the countdown hit zero. In fact, I stayed home entirely. I would never admit to her that I was scared, horrified about the consequences – but I was.

The day ended, and I was safe. 

But Erin didn’t come home.

*

The car accident had pinned her to the driver’s seat. She was still alive when the ambulance arrived, and they promised to get her out safely.

They did not live up to that promise.

The fire started quickly, and they couldn’t get her out in time. The had to leave her there, trapped, as it inched closer, ignoring her screams as she begged for help. 

I knew they were lying when they said she died quickly.

Now I’m too scared to touch the clock. I don’t want to look at it, and I’m too horrified to destroy it. I have a feeling that it will outlive me and find its way to someone else.

Because now I realize the horrifying truth: Erin was right, and the action of looking at the clock resulted in the consequence of her [terrible death](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/).
