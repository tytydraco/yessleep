You probably have lived in one of those new developments with huge houses and a HOA to ensure that everything is color coordinated. Maybe you lived in an antique neighborhood with picturesque little houses and Victorian Mansions. Me I live in a war neighborhood. It is boring and I love it. Built before the war; well directly before America entered WWII. The neighborhood was “designed to support aerospace” the Realtor said. Aerospace at the time was the bomb and rocket factory. The houses are quaint and small. They hadn’t invented the term tiny yet.

Most of my neighbors have two bedrooms one bathroom and a common room plan that was too small for anything to be called “Great”. But my house was special. You see when they built my house they bought two lots both small but together you could make something. And after the war they did. My house expanded adding a sunny and grand living room and an attached garage with a small second story. My house is only smallish.

We moved here for the schools. There is a fantastic high school only a few blocks away, walking distance. And they call the neighborhood “affordable”. It isn’t, but everyone calls it that.

So my son wanted to move upstairs during his sophomore year. When we moved in, he wanted to be downstairs for more independence.

“Sure but why the sudden move.”  
“Dad, the house is haunted.”  
“Preposterous the house is too new to be haunted. The old lady across the street has known everyone who lived in this house.”  
“She is old as dirt and maybe senile” he said.  
“No!”

Admittedly they were still prototyping rocks when she moved into the neighborhood.

“She says no one ever died in or near the house and no one who lived there was depressed enough or mean enough to haunt it.”  
“It’s still haunted, Dad!”  
“Have you seen any ghosts?”  
“No”  
“Have they talked to you?”  
“No”  
“So how do you know?”  
“I hear them. They make noises.”  
“Damn! We probably have rats.”

So goes the saga of moving his stuff upstairs, but hey our Work from Home Office is next to the kitchen. So much closer to the coffee.

Ah but now he is off to college. Living in a brownstone that is definitely haunted with four roommates. There is even an article in the newspaper about it. Granted the article was from 1872 so maybe the ghosts moved out. He seems quite unbothered.

“We should get a dog!” the wife says.  
“We are still mourning the last dog!”  
“It has been over 4 years. We haven’t had a dog in this house.  
With the boy in college I miss the pitter patter of little feet.  
We can get a rescue and avoid the puppy phase.”

With our genes the “pitter patter” sounded more like a Clydesdale learning to tap dance to pornographic Rap music.

“Ok.”

We adore corgis and they are smart, cute and can’t jump the fence.

“See!  We could adopt this one she is a rescue.”

“She might not be potty trained. Many rescues aren’t.” says the adoption lady.

We are in luck, well mostly. She is potty trained. At least during the day.

*Thump, Thump, Thumpity thump.*

There we were watching a movie in the sun room. Did I mention the sun room? Sometime in the 1960s someone added a sun room. Not one of those attach a tin garden shed to you house things but a proper room but with a flat roof tucked under the eaves of the house. This seems to be the source of our problem. The roof is flat enough to stand on. I have done it while cleaning the gutters.

“We need a camera.” says the wife.

Yes she is "the wife". Always "the wife". Even my friends refer to her as "the wife".

“A camera?”  
“Yes! A camera for the roof.”  
“For the roof?”  
“The dog is scared of whatever is on the roof. If we had a camera we could see it. They have speakers and sirens now. We could scare it off. The dog would potty outside at night. Aren’t you tired of cleaning up?”  
“It’s a squirrel.”  
“Squirrels aren’t nocturnal and it sounds way too big anyway.”  
“It is probably a rat then or the neighbor’s cat chasing a rat.”  
“Be that as it may, the dog is scared to go out in the dark.”  
“We have lights.”  
“She is still scared. You can install the camera while I am at my sister’s. She is ill and needs help.”

Yeah her sister needs help alright. So does my sister. They both are “ill”. But the wife has spoken and electronics and outdoors is my jurisdiction so I had better hop to it. Her jurisdiction is emergency birthday cakes and IRS audits. I think I have the better end of the deal.

Today I have the camera. It is quite fancy. Express shipping when you really wanted it here yesterday but can wait two days. It is solar and has a speaker with a siren and AI motion detection built in. Wow! It is even does color at night. I have out done myself.

So here I sit. Me and the dog. We are watching another movie.

*Thumpity thump, Thump, Thump.*

**Bing.**  
**Animal Detected on the roof.**

I have you now. Let’s see how you like me talking to you roof rat.  
I pop open the app on my phone.

It isn’t a rat.  
And it isn’t the neighbor’s cat.  
But it is eating a rat.  
And posing for “selfies”.

“Honey, Sorry to bother while you are at your sister’s but we need to move.”
