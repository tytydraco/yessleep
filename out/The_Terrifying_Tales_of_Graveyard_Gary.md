I knew him before he was Graveyard Gary. Back when he was just Gary Cooper, a weirdo kid with a mullet. He was an awful boy, even then. He arrived at our school sometime in Grade 6. Straight away, the kids hated him. And for good reason: Gary would light insects on fire and laugh as they burn. Then he would toss the charred carcasses at girls and laugh as they squealed and ran away. Like I said, he was a strange character. But it was in high school when he became Graveyard Gary. 
 
Gary was over-eager, overweight and overtly awkward. Needless to say, he couldn’t charm his way out of a James Bond movie. Still, he was smart, no denying that, and he got good grades, unlike me. But still, I kinda liked him. Maybe because he was such an odd ball, someone who desperately wanted to fit it, but couldn’t, no matter how hard he tried. Maybe because no matter how bad my life got, at least I wasn’t as unpopular, or weird, as Graveyard Gary.
 
I discovered his secret (if you can call it that) during lunch break. Back in Grade 11, I believe. You see, I too, was weird. Still am. But unlike Graveyard Gary, I kept my mouth shut. I wasn’t popular by any stretch of the imagination, but I got by. Being good at sports, especially track and field, helped a lot. 
 
But I digress.
 
Like I said, sometime during high school, he became Graveyard Gary. I can’t remember who came up with the name, but it stuck. Stuck like a fly in wet cement.
 
Gary was the biggest pothead in school. And that’s saying a lot. Believe me. In fact, I smoked my first joint with him. He approached me at the end of lunch break. His eyes were red and glossy, his hair disheveled and unkempt. I’d just rushed out from School Band practice. (I played bass in the school funk band).
        	
“Duder,” (he called everyone that), “this is what you need.” He handed me a joint the size of a football.
 
I took it and smoked it right then and there, in the parking lot. I was curious. Lots of kids were using pot, so I figured I’d at least give it a try. I got so stoned, I barely made it to class. 
 
Embarrassing story aside (everyone in class knew I was blazed, including Mrs. Stafford, my English teacher. Fortunately, I was saved by a snap assembly at the auditorium), I started getting high with Graveyard Gary every day at lunch. This is where my tale begins. Meaning: this is where things get creepy. Downright terrifying, if you ask me.
 
Graveyard Gary mostly smoked hash. He had plenty of it, too. One gloomy fall afternoon, Gary led me out back behind St. Joseph’s Cemetery, the oldest (and creepiest) cemetery in the lowly town of Gulp.
 
The cemetery is next to a path leading to Main Street. Kids from both Blessed Mother of Mary High School and St. Joseph’s Elementary School used the path, so there was plenty of traffic. We sat behind a large tombstone, where nobody could see us. Something about this cemetery seemed wrong. I hated it. Too many dead souls in one place. No wonder everyone avoided it. Everyone, that is, except Graveyard Gary.
 
Gary and I were sitting with our backs against an anonymous grave, gawking as a group of kids walked past, probably returning from the local pizza place. I remember being extremely self-conscious. What if they see me? Oh, they’d call me stupid names, like Cemetery Sam, or something worse. Not gonna lie, this thought terrified me almost as much as what comes next.
        	
“Do you believe in ghosts?” Gary casually asked. He was putting a small piece of hash onto the heater of a cigarette and then sticking the cigarette into the hole of an empty bottle with a hole cut into it. (This is affectionately known as a Bottle Toke. BT for short.)
 
Yeah, welcome to Gulp.
 
Before I could answer, he passed me the bottle, and I inhaled the swirling smoke. “Nope,” I said, amidst a coughing fit.
        	
Gary chuckled, his eyes big and red and round. “Look over there,” he pointed.
 
I did. He was pointing to a tall gravestone with fancy calligraphy carved into it. Despite its grandiosity, the grave was grim and very old. It was super creepy; the kind of grave you’d expect a vampire to climb out of. Harold P. Halliburton was the name on the grave, I remember. That name has stuck with me ever since. And for good reason.
        	
“There!” he snapped. “You see it?”
 
I didn’t. Nor did I care to. This place was weirding me out. The way the wind tickled the long grass poking out of the graves, making strange and inhumane noises; the way the graves seemed to all be pointing toward this particular tall and ominous tombstone. Plus, the feeling of being watched was as strong as the hash I was inhaling.
        	
“Look harder,” he said, unkindly.
 
I did. Squinting and straining to see something – mostly to amuse him – I saw something: a shimmering light, like steam released from a kettle. Just a flicker, but it was enough to give me the heebie-jeebies. Before I could look away, the soil surrounding the tombstone moved.
 
I rubbed my eyes, pretending not to notice the ghastly ghost stumbling out of the Halliburton grave; pretending not to smell the sweet stench of rotting flesh prickling at my nostrils. The corpse – a zombie-ghost hybrid, perhaps – started staggering toward us, scaring me half-to-death.
 
“Aha! You see him!” He seemed proud. And stoned. “I knew it. I always did. That’s why I kept you around all this time.”
        	
I raised my eyebrow, and was about to intervene – like, what’s this ‘kept you around nonsense?’ – when he dropped another bomb.
 
“You’re a Sleether. Like me.” He finished preparing another BT, then handed it to me. “You just don’t know it.”
        	
I don’t remember much of what happened next. But thankfully, the Halliburton ghost disappeared. We chatted nonsensically, then we ambled towards the school, good and high, for our afternoon classes. I do recall trying my darnedest to forget what I’d seen. I was stoned, I told myself, the Halliburton ghost was my overactive, inebriated imagination. 

I told myself this, but I didn’t believe it. Not for a second.
 
…
        	
Getting stoned at the cemetery became a ritual. One afternoon, a week or so later, Graveyard Gary seemed agitated, barely speaking a word. This was odd. You see, he didn’t care enough to become upset. Even though he was an outcast, nothing seemed to bother him. I figured it was the drugs.
 
We sat at our usual grave. I waited, while Gary prepared the first round of BT’s. As I was about to take a healthy-sized toke, something in the cemetery screamed. The sound ricocheted off the graves like a flat stone on a calm lake. The scream sent ripples down my spine. I could feel it in my teeth.
 
Immediately, I was terrified. I hadn’t heard nothing like it before. Not ever. It was extremely loud. And piercing. Both near and far away at the same time, almost like it was a part of me.
 
REEEEKEEEEEE…
 
It happened again. The sound dripped from my forehead like cold sweat. I probably peed my pants.
 
Even Gary seemed startled; so much so, that he dropped his hash nuggets. He cursed, while rubbing his large hands through the cold cemetery floor, searching for his precious hash.
 
For a moment, the world went dark and still. I swear I could hear the cemetery’s raspy breath rattling all around me. To my horror, the Halliburton ghost emerged, haggard and horrible. It groaned as it stood tall; too tall, if you ask me. Then it flickered and returned to its grave. I sighed with great relief. 

Then something grabbed hold of me. Something big. It flashed before my eyes, sending a shock wave throughout my body and soul. It was awful: an abominable beast with maggots for eyeballs and thick matted fur. It stood erect – ten feet tall, at least – wearing mud-stained rags. It wasn’t human, but it wasn’t an animal. It was both. 
 
It came at me from behind, scraping my stomach with its long, jagged claws, cutting me open. The pain was egregious. Immediately, I started leaking blood by the barrelful. I freaked out, trying to get the monster off me, but it latched onto me. I fell to my knees, groaning in pain as the creature pounced.
 
Again, it shrieked.
 
REEEEKEEEEEE…
 
I panicked. My trembling hands were covered in gore and blood – my blood – which was leaking like a faucet.
 
“Relax,” Gary said forcefully, as he stood up. “I gotta piss. Here seems fine.”
 
To my astonishment, as I lay leaking blood, being devoured by some unholy apparition, Gary pissed on the Halliburton grave. As he did, thunder rattled overhead and the sky grew menacingly dark. Lightning flashed.

“Looks like you’re bleeding,” Gary said, without sympathy, after he’d finished. 

He stuck his fatty finger deep inside my blood-guzzling wound. I hollered in grief. Everything went gray. For a moment, I thought I was dead. Then my eyes shot open in a flash. Graveyard Gary was slapping my face, grinning like a lusty lounge lizard. I saw my reflection in his eyes and shuddered.
 
“Bleeding,” I manage to say, my eyes pleading for help.
 
Graveyard Gary crooked his huge head, brushing aside his brown bangs. “I told you,” he said, as though talking to an imbecile. “It LOOKS like you’re bleeding. LOOKS.” By then, he’d given up trying to find the lost hash. “You’re not bleeding. You just think you are.” His smirk widened. “Halliburton is a huckster. He’s inside your head, gutting you like a pig.” 

Gary started squealing and making pig noises.
 
I leapt to my feet, panting and thrashing about. I couldn’t shake off the ghost no matter how hard I tried. It was taking over me. My entire body felt gross. The creature was pulling at my spine, bending my bones. My hands and arms and legs were saturated in thick, gooey blood. My school uniform was ruined. How would I explain this to my father?
 
Pain and panic infused me. I reached for my phone, then thought better of it, not wanting to ruin it with my splattering blood.
 
Meanwhile, Graveyard Gary was laughing and rubbing his belly. For the first time that day, he seemed back to his old self. To my dismay, he produced a bag of candies from his jacket pocket and started shoving them into his pudgy face, chewing them like a hog.
 
Watching him mock and belittle me was appalling. I hated him.
 
Making matters worse, the Halliburton ghost started speaking. Its breath was rank and highly offensive, like sulfur mixed with saw sewage. “Sam,” it said. “Stay with us. You’ll love it here. I promise.”
 
I flew twenty feet into the air, shrieking and crying and bleeding.

That’s when Graveyard Gary’s face changed. It was an expression I’d never seen on his face: a mixture of concern and contempt.
 
“Smarten up, Sam,” he said, after stuffing his soiled BT bottle into his backpack, “I told you. The ghost is screwing with you. That’s all. The blood ain’t real.”
 
He slapped me. Not hard. But hard enough to steal my dignity. Whatever was left of it. When I look down. The blood was gone. Most of it, anyway. And so was the Halliburton ghost.
 
“Well,” he said dramatically, as though he’d been rehearsing this, and the time has finally come so he’s gonna milk it for all its worth, “the BLOOD isn’t real. But…” His rubbery lips stretched into a grotesque grin, making him look like a full-fledged psychopath. “The ghosts are real.”
 
“Ghosts?” I didn’t like how he’d pluralized the word.
 
Graveyard Gary ignored me, and peered across the endless row of tombstones, shaking his head. “Hmph. Getting realer every day. Stronger, too.”
 
He helped me to my feet, and we meandered back to class. I kept checking to see if the blood was still there; it wasn’t, but that didn’t reassure me. Nothing would, after that. How could it?
 
Just before we parted ways, he patted my shoulder, looked me dead in the eyes, and said, “Remember Sam: You’re a [Sleether.”]( https://www.reddit.com/user/CallMeStarr)
