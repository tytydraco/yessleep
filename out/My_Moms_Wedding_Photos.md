**I had to win a legal battle just to retrieve this.**  


It was only ever a post on an online forum. But that didn’t seem to matter.  
This is what we submitted—what we were allowed to submit—as **evidence for the defense**.

Our photographer sent this photo to us privately.  
Said he wouldn’t include it in the final package, but thought we should have it anyway.  
He didn’t explain why, but I think I understand.  
It’s of my husband and me on our wedding day.  
We wanted the shoot to be playful.  
He caught us mid-laugh at a joke Mark made.  
A stupid inside joke about something my sister did the last time we were here.  
She was helping us find gorgeous places for our wedding shoot.  
I keep staring at the picture on my phone.

Have you seen this before?

My eyes keep drifting to the same spot in the background.

Earlier today, Mark said, "It’s like we’re looking at that spot when we’re not looking at the picture."

The photo shows us laughing at each other, heads pressed together.  
We’re in the bottom right, standing at a lusciously green mountain overlook.  
The wind catches the scent of the ocean in our hair.  
The sun warms our slightly pink faces.  
It looks like the moment was made for us.

I was just scrolling.  
Didn’t even pause on this post at first. Just flicked past it.  
But the image stuck.  
Like it imprinted or something.  
I kept thinking about it.  
About that bend in the tree line, the light hitting the rocks just right.  
There was this... chill, like stepping into a house that’s been empty for too long.  
So I scrolled all the way back until I found it again.  
I didn’t even notice the people until after I got back to it.  
I’ve seen it somewhere...  
But it wasn’t in the mountains.

Yes. Yes. I know exactly what you mean.  
For me it was at the beach.  
It was like something was playing in the waves.

Well... playing is a strong word. More like experiencing the waves.

I don’t remember the waves hitting it...  
But the salt in the air felt thicker right then.  
My mouth filled with it, like breathing soup.  
That was when I was eight. Twenty-four years ago.  
We left the beach early.

My sister Kathy let out a sound like something had been torn out of her.  
She had a natural birth that nearly killed her,  
but the breakdown from the beach was viscerally worse.  
She was inconsolable.

Not even with ice cream. Her favorite was chocolate.  
Why did I even say that.

I saw it in a train window.

There was an empty car, so we thought we hit the jackpot.

No one else was there.  
We were looking out the window, and something caught our eye outside.

It felt like it was following the train, but there was nothing there.  
I remember thinking it was the bogeyman. But I was only 6.  
My dad made us move to another car.

One that had other people in it.  
He said he felt like something was going to get on board.

It wasn’t in the window in the other cars with people in them.  
But the freezing wind made the walls rattle in that empty car—  
a metallic pressure, sharp as breath on frostbitten skin.

I screenshotted it. Showed it to my mom.  
She got quiet. Said, “That’s where we lost your dad.  
He had to know. He hiked to the spot it was in.  
Didn’t even report him as missing. Didn’t need to.”

**\[edit\]**  
Checked again.  
The spot is somehow bigger, but still not there.  
My husband and I are looking at it.  
I think I just noticed that we weren't looking at the camera.
