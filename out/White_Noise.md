I had trouble sleeping through my early childhood. Sometimes, I would be awoken to various noises that I could not identify. This got worse and worse as my young mind would begin to associate these sounds with monsters in the hallway or people moving about downstairs.

This all changed when my mom got me a white noise machine. If you don’t know what they are, they are little devices which create white noise to help with sleep. White noise is a general term referring to anything from waves on a beach to a washing machine. The latter was what I usually had mine set to.

I got the machine around when I was 12, and immediately my sleep improved. Instead of waking up to various noises in the night, I usually slept fine.

I had the machine set to one of the lowest settings. Not too loud, but not too quiet. Every night, I turned it on, and every morning, I turned it off. I got into a routine like this for the next year, never missing one or the other.

Until one night. I woke up, not to a noise in the hall, not to the white noise machine, just to complete and utter silence. This unnerved me more than anything I had ever felt. Why it did, I cannot say. It was like when you forget something, and it isn’t immediately noticeable. But you know something is missing, and it prompts you to take action.

I turned over in bed and looked at the machine on my nightstand. Along with being a white noise machine, it had a little light that I also had set to low intensity. However, the light was off as well. 

A chill ran through my entire body when I realized this. Immediately, I lurched forward and turned on both the light and the white noise. I didn’t sleep for the rest of the night.

When I told my mom about it, she said I must have forgotten to turn it on before I went to sleep. But I couldn’t go to sleep without it being on, I told her. She insisted that I had just forgotten. Finally, I accepted this truth and went through my day. That night, I made sure, absolutely sure, that it was on before I drifted off.

But I woke up again. This was something else. Not silence, this time. My noise machine was blaring at maximum volume. The tossing and turning of laundry filled my ears. It filled the entire room. It was deafening. 

Without thinking, I turned the machine off. I was plunged into complete darkness. But not silence. My heart beat faster than I ever thought possible in my ears. My entire body went rigid and cold. There was another noise, heavy and repeating.

Breathing. In, out, in, out. It was labored, as if whoever was making it was using a lot of effort to do so.

I jumped out of my bed, and, as I did, I felt warm breath on my feet and ankles. This spurred me and I sprinted all the way into my parent’s room and locked the door behind me.

The police rushed over. In fifteen minutes, they knocked on the door. We didn’t leave the bedroom, but we heard the officer’s voice muffled behind the bedroom door.

“Is everyone all right in there?” it said.

When we left, we learned that nobody was under my bed, and when the officer arrived, the front door was unlocked. The officer also found trash and food under my bed, indicating that the person was there for at least a few days.

Meaning that whoever was in my room, under my bed, messing with my white noise machine, had been waiting. But when I ran, they unlocked and left through the front door.

Whoever they were, they were still out there. 

After that, I threw away the machine. We moved across the country to a different house, and made sure to install extra locks on all the doors and windows.

Take this as a warning. Noise can be an escape, a wall, almost. But be careful. Walls can cover up things you’d rather not see.
