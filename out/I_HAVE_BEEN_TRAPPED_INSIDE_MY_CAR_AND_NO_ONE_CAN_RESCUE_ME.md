My car won’t let me out.

I reached home around 1AM and parked the car next to the curb in front of my house. Switching off the ignition and pocketing the keys, I unlocked the door and got out of the car, only to find myself right back into the driver’s seat, sitting exactly as I was before.

I stopped for a moment, confused. The streetlights over my house went out, freaking me out even further. Just a coincidence, probably. Still a bit dazed, I opened the door and got out again.

And this time too I found myself right back in the driver’s seat with the door locked and the keys still in ignition.

Once, it could be a slip up in imagination. Twice, it could be the lack of sleep. 

But this kept on happening every single time I tried to get out of the door. 10 times. 20 times. Every attempt to escape was met with a chilling reality. The car, a malevolent entity in its own right, thwarted my efforts, returning me to my seat with an eerie precision. 

Annoyed and petrified at the same time, I rolled down my window. Thinking I could maybe jump out of it, I leaned through the window and pushed myself off the floor of the car. I was hoping I’d land hands first.

As soon as my fingers touched the ground, I thought I was safe.

But the very next second, I found myself back in the driver’s seat exactly as I was, except there was some dust on my clothes. Not only that, I noticed that all the windows in my car had now turned an opaque black. I tried to roll the driver’s window down again, but it was jammed. I tried the other windows but none would budge. The only way for me to see outside was through my front windshield.

It still won’t let me out.

I gulped.

PINGG! PINGG!

My phone buzzed. My roommate, Sid, was calling me.

“Dude, where the hell are you? Are you coming back tonight?” said Sid. He reminded me that I had forgotten to take the keys when I had left tonight.

I gave Sid a half baked explanation about how I was right outside the house but my car door was jammed and I wasn’t able to get out.

“Could you help me out?” I requested.

“Yeah. I’ll be out there in a minute,” he said, ending the call.

I waited for about ten minutes. The cold breeze of the night swept some dried leaves with it in front of me.

PINGG!

This time it was a message from Sid.

SID: Dude, don’t fuck with me, ok?

ME: What the hell do you mean?

SID: You’re not here. No one’s here. And why the hell is the streetlight not working.

ME: I’m in my car.

SID: And where is your car?

ME: Next to the curb.

The blackened windows blocked my view. But I kept banging against them to let Sid I was right there. 

SID: Are you sure?

Was I sure? I didn’t understand. Why was he making a whole fuzz –

PINGG!

A photo from Sid. I opened it. It was the view from our front porch. As my eyes followed the driveway to the curb, I was horrified to see that the spot where my car should’ve been parked, with me stuck inside, was completely empty.

SID: Is this another one of those DRUNK PRANKS by you and your friends?

I was too stunned to answer. The photo didn’t make sense to me at all.  

SID: Yeah, I’m going back in. Stay at your friend’s or whatever. Good night.

I started shouting his name out of the car but I got no answer. He had also stopped replying to my texts and calls.

I contemplated if I could click a photo of the driveway from my angle when I got out of the car to tell Sid I was really here. Preparing myself mentally, I opened my phone’s camera and switched on the flash. Then I unlocked the car door and got out. As soon as my feet touched the road, I clicked a photo.

When I found myself back in the driver’s seat again, I unlocked my phone and checked my gallery. I saw that the flash of my camera had captured a hazy yet grotesque sight. Standing five feet away from my car was what I could only describe as a tall, menacing shadowy figure. Its eyes, if it even had any, seemed like deep distant pits of darkness. Its form was indistinct, but I could tell it was standing on inhuman limbs. A twisted, gnarly hand of bone jutted out of the figure’s body, reaching out for my camera.

Terror seized me as my blood ran cold. Disbelief surged through my mind. I was sure there was nothing in the driveway when I just went outside.

SCREECH!

Nails hit against my darkened window, trying to break it down. The ensuing horror that washed over me made me switch on the ignition and hit the accelerator like a damn madman.

Down the straight. Hard right. A few blocks to an intersection. Left. Another left. The roads were very empty. Expected, given how it was 2AM in the night. I kept on taking any random street possible till my heart, which had been beating hard enough to launch me to the moon, returned to a normal pace and allowed me to take a few easy breaths.

I passed by the church I used to visit when I was younger. The door was closed but I could see the lights on inside. Father Romano always let the church remain open for whoever wanted to get the Lord’s blessings.

And I definitely needed some of His magic. My hands were fatigued and my eyes were starting to feel the numbness which comes when you want to fall asleep. But I didn’t have it in me to have some rest. 

I stopped under a bridge and took a few deep breaths. The shadowy figure was nowhere to be seen around. But I couldn’t be so sure. I took out my phone and opened the camera. This time, I got out of my car, facing behind. And clicked a photo.

When I was transported back into the driver’s seat, I checked the photo and a sigh of relief came over me. 

It was empty. 

The entire street was empty.

I perused the entire photo, every corner, but I could see nothing. I took another deep breath.

My mind wondered how I ended up in this disposition. I remembered going to a friend’s party and having a few drinks there. But I didn’t drink much because I knew I had to drive back home. However, I have absolutely no idea when I left the party and when I sat in the car.

In fact, I don’t even remember whose party it was.

Less than a mile ahead of me, I could see a toll plaza with its lights on. I wasn’t sure if there were people there since the barriers appeared to be open. In fact, I wasn’t sure if the toll plaza was even operational since I hadn’t been around this highway often.

As I pondered over the events of the night while gazing at the stars, I noticed the lights at the toll plaza go off. Still no signs of any employee coming out of there. Few seconds later, a streetlight near the toll plaza also shut off. And then the next one did too.

Another streetlight died down. I could feel the goosebumps prick on my arms.

The next lamp dwindled down too. Desperation gnawed at me as I fumbled for my phone. I opened the door as another streetlight switched off. Getting out, I decided to take a burst of photos before I got transported back inside.

In the car, I started checking the photos as the next light went out too and I saw a horrific sight. The road in front of me was flanked on both sides by not one but two of the shadowy figures like the one from before. With their deformed legs stretching out, it seemed like they were walking. They must have been 200 metres ahead of me.

I swiped to the next photo. 150 metres. They were now looking towards the car.

Next pic. 100 metres.

Next pic. 50 metres.

I hit the accelerator just as the last streetlight ahead of me died down. And then –

THUD!

My car bumped into thin air. The Figures, I thought. 

My brakes brought the car to a screeching halt as I hit the reverse gear and turned. 

THUD!

SCREEEEEECHHH!

My windshield erupted in a cacophony of shattered glass. Panic surged through me as shards of glass rained down and cold air surged through my face. I couldn’t figure out where They were attacking me from. But I held my breath and made a quick U turn, then pressed the accelerator all the way down. 

I made a couple of quick turns. Soon, I came back to the street where my old church was. Taking another turn down the lane, I observed that the doors were open but the lights were off… 

I arrived at a junction of 4 roads. Straight ahead, I noticed streetlights in the distance switching off again.  There was a traffic light towards the right side of the road which was blinking with a yellow color given how late it was. I was about to turn when I saw the traffic light break down too.

I swerved left. 

THUD!

Something hit the right side of my car so hard that my car slid onto the curb. More Figures. Getting a hold on myself, I accelerated quickly enough to get out of the street.

A couple of turns. A few rights. A left at a T-point.

I roamed endlessly. The speedometer climbed higher but still I didn’t feel any sense of safety. I didn't know where I was going, just that I had to keep moving. Every curve in the road, every flickering light in the distance, sent shivers down my spine.

I turned into an isolated road on what felt like the outskirts of my city. It was surrounded by cornfields on both sides. It creeped the hell out of me. Suddenly, I saw a blinking signal behind the steering wheel. 

“Oh fuck,” I said, realizing that my car was on the verge of running out of gas. 

I had been stuck inside for the past 6 hours. It was 7AM. The sun should’ve been up but it was still dark. What the hell was happening?

My heart pounded in my chest, a frantic drumbeat echoing the rhythm of the tires against the road. 

I drove for ten minutes more on that road until I turned into the cornfields on my left, as my car eventually came to a halt. Hiding under the tall crops, I closed my eyes, wishing for my luck to turn around.

I miserably tried to get out of the car one last time and run, but was not surprised with the outcome.

My car still won’t let me out.

I’m attaching the photos for everyone to see. I hope they get uploaded. I don’t know if anyone will see this. I’m getting very low signal here so there’s probably not gonna be a lot of updates on this post.

I just looked behind. In the distance, I could see a streetlight on the road switch off and collapse…
