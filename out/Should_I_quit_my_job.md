So recently I just got hired at Chuck E Cheese as an overnight security guard.  I always liked the idea of being a night guard at a mall or any other establishment.  I had my first night yesterday and I have to be honest, I was kind of spooked.  I work at the Chuck E Cheese that still has the animatronics that perform shows. I liked those as a kid. I really liked them as a kid but at night they kinda are a little creepy all turned off.  My shift started at midnight and I bid the last guy goodnight and I worked till 6. really good pay 18 bucks an hour so I made a little over $100 last night. But I'm starting to think something is a little off.  I'll let you guys be the judge of it.

My shift started off with telling the last security guard Scott goodnight and I clocked in. the first hour was quiet. I spent most of my time in the security office looking at the cameras. It was kinda fun at first because there isn't a camera itself in the security office. Only right outside. So I kinda just glanced every so often at the cameras while I checked my socials, watch videos, and scroll through reddit. I mean who would want to rob a little kid's party place? Plus my store gets shuttered and locked at night so if someone broke in, I'd definitely hear it and see it.  

But now here is where the weird stuff happened I heard a loud scraping noise. Like metal on metal scraping noise and it was LOUD.  My hair stood on end when I heard it and I looked at the cameras to the front entrance and the back entrance and nothing looked broken into at all.  I was pretty scared and I was thinking of just hiding in that small office. But then what security guard would I be if I hid from a break in?  I got the courage to grab my flashlight and a taser that the company provided me for any intruders if there was a break in.  

When I walked out into the party room I went straight to the front entrance really slowly and quietly while calling out that I was armed and that if someone was in the store they can show themselves and no one would get hurt.  I got no response.

I heard the loud scraping noise again and it made me almost jump out of my skin. I heard it from behind me so I spun around and shown my flashlight at where I heard the noise and the stage housing the animatronics was lit dimly with my flashlight. Then I noticed it. That purple character on the drums. Munch I think he's called? Apparently the animatronic looked like it moved its arms like it was going to play on its drums like it does during one of the shows. It was a little creepy because it looked like its arms were up but it's dull plastic green eyes were locked on me.  Then it happened again. The loud scraping noise and the arms of the animatronic moved very quickly but then stopped and the character's eyes where mid blink mouth slightly open. 

I decided to go a little closer to investigate the stage because the manager did tell me that the master controls for the characters where located beneath the stage and I thought maybe the maintenance crew didn't fully turn it all off. 

Then I noticed this horrible smell when I got close to the stage. I thought it maybe the rug but Scott told me the rug was cleaned last night. so maybe it was just some leftover food somewhere that went bad.  I plugged my nose and opened up the control board and it looked like all of the switches seemed to be turned off.   I decided I'll just turn Munch on and off to see if that would do anything so I did a very quick flick and flick and then Munch's arms went all the way up and slammed down on his drums and I don't think I let him continue his cycle because he was in his off posistion but his eyes where staring straight down at me.  

At that point I just could not handle that smell so I decided to head back the office with a little haste in my step because I was kinda creeped out.  The rest of the night was quiet until my quitting time at 6 when I went to clock out I heard the scraping noise again but when I turned around it was from that bird. It seemed to have turned its head straight at the entrance while I was about to leave. I quickly locked the door, went to my car and sped on home. I filed to the manager some malfunctions with the animatronics and a weird smell but I haven't got anything back. 

Should I quit? Something seemed a little off last night. If I do stay I will keep you guys posted.
