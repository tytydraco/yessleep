Christmas Eve is supposed to feel warm, magical,a night when snow falls softly, lights twinkle in every window, and the whole world seems to hold its breath, waiting for morning. At least, that’s what I used to think. Now I know better. Because when the snow fell that Christmas Eve, it wasn’t magical,it was smothering, muffling the screams. The lights didn’t twinkle; they cast shadows that danced and stretched, mocking us. And the whole world wasn’t holding its breath,it was holding something back. Something old. Something hungry.

We were one of those picture-perfect suburban families, at least from the outside. Dad with his tie askew, Mom humming Christmas carols while baking cookies, my little sister Lily barely able to sit still from the excitement. She was six, still a firm believer in Santa Claus. I was thirteen, old enough to know better but still young enough to let her have her magic.

The neighborhood was the same as always on Christmas Eve. Houses lined with blinking lights, inflatable snowmen wobbling in the yards. You could almost forget about Jimmy Peterson down the street,the kid who’d gone missing a week ago, just vanished from his bed. The police said it was probably a custody dispute or a runaway. Mom and Dad believed that. I didn’t.

Even before the sun set, I felt it. Something wasn’t right. It wasn’t the kind of thing you could see or hear, just a weight, like the air itself was leaning in too close. The streets seemed too quiet, the windows too dark behind their cheerful lights.

“Quit being so serious,” Dad said as we hung the stockings. “You’re going to scare Lily with that storm cloud face.”

“I’m not scared,” I shot back. But I was lying.

After dinner, we put Lily to bed. She left out the cookies and milk with painstaking care, even writing a little note to Santa in her best wobbly handwriting: *Dear Santa, I’ve been so good. Please don’t forget me.*

My parents went to bed early, leaving me to sit by the tree, staring at the lights. The house felt too big, too quiet. The silence crawled into my ears and stayed there, amplifying every creak of the floorboards and rustle of the wind outside.

Then I heard it. A sound that didn’t belong.

Not the wind. Not the tree settling. A faint jingle, like bells. It came from outside, faint at first, then louder, clearer. But it wasn’t cheerful like the bells on a sleigh. No, this was slow, heavy, deliberate, like someone dragging them along.

I pressed my nose to the cold glass of the living room window. The snow-covered street was empty. No cars, no movement, just that eerie sound, getting closer.

I was just about to convince myself it was nothing when I saw the first shadow move. It flickered across the roof of the Thompsons’ house, long and hunched. Then another. They didn’t look like reindeer, too tall, too spindly. And they didn’t look like Santa, either.

Then he appeared.

He moved across the rooftops like an animal,crouched low, almost crawling, dragging something heavy behind him. His silhouette looked like it belonged to Santa, with the coat and the sack slung over his shoulder, but that’s where the resemblance ended. Even from a distance, I could see his proportions were wrong. His legs were too long, his shoulders too broad, and his head turned in jerky, unnatural movements.

I stumbled back from the window, heart racing. My first thought was to wake my parents, but the noise stopped me. A scratching, scrabbling sound on the roof.

Our roof.

I stood frozen as the sound moved toward the chimney. My breath caught in my throat when I heard the faintest thud, something landing in the living room behind me.

I turned slowly. The Christmas tree lights flickered, casting just enough glow to see the figure standing by the fireplace. He was enormous, hunched so his shoulders brushed the top of the mantel. His red suit was filthy, the fabric torn and hanging in strips. The beard was there, but it was yellowed, matted with dirt, or something worse. His hat sat crooked on his head, the white trim stained.

And his face. God, his face.

The eyes were sunken pits, gleaming faintly, like animal eyes catching light. His mouth stretched too far, full of crooked, sharp teeth that seemed to shine wetly in the glow of the Christmas lights. He smiled at me, wide and knowing, and I swear I heard a sound, a low, wet chuckle.

The sack slung over his shoulder writhed. Whatever was inside wasn’t presents, it was moving. Squirming. He dropped it with a thud, and a muffled cry came from within.

That broke my paralysis. I bolted up the stairs, nearly tripping in my panic, and flung open Lily’s door. She was already sitting up in bed, rubbing her eyes. “What’s wrong?” she whispered.

“Shh,” I hissed, dragging her out of bed. “We have to hide.”

I pushed her into the closet and climbed in after her, pulling the door shut just as the floorboards creaked outside her room. I pressed a hand over her mouth to keep her quiet, my other hand trembling so hard I thought it would give us away.

The door opened slowly, the hinges groaning. Through the slats in the closet door, I saw him. He stood in the doorway, his head cocked to the side like he was listening. He sniffed the air, low and loud, then let out a guttural growl.

Lily whimpered against my hand, and I squeezed her tighter.

He took a step closer, his boots thudding against the hardwood. Then another. I thought he’d found us, but at the last second, he turned toward the window. He climbed through it, disappearing into the night as silently as he’d come.

We stayed in that closet until the first light of dawn crept through the cracks. When we finally emerged, the house was eerily still. The cookies and milk were gone. So was Lily’s note.

When I looked outside, I saw the tracks, boot prints leading away from the house, joined by a smaller set, like a child’s.

Down the street, the Thompsons were standing in their yard, shouting Mark’s name. Another missing kid. Another family left to wonder.

I never told anyone what happened that night. They wouldn’t have believed me. But every Christmas Eve, when the snow falls and the streets go quiet, I stay awake, listening.

Because somewhere out there, he’s still coming. And the next time, he might not leave me [behind](https://youtu.be/0A-6kh0YeKs)
