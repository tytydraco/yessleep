It happened when I was nine. After school, when everything should have been safe, predictable. It was one of those afternoons where the sun hung low in the sky, casting long shadows over the playground. Aftercare was nearly empty, just a few kids left scattered at tables, waiting for their parents. Mrs. Ramirez, our teacher, sat at her desk with her back to us, eyes on her computer screen, clearly lost in her own world. I was drawing, mindlessly scratching a pencil across the paper, waiting for my dad to show up.

That’s when I noticed him standing in the doorway.

At first glance, he looked like someone who belonged—a tall, unremarkable man with a slightly disheveled appearance, maybe in his late thirties or early forties. His clothes were worn, a frayed denim jacket over a faded t-shirt, and his hair was tousled in a way that seemed casual, like he hadn’t bothered with it that day. He gave a small wave, smiling as if he knew me. As if we’d met before.

“Hey, buddy,” he said softly, his voice smooth but too familiar. He said my name then, like it was second nature to him. “Your dad got held up at work and asked me to come pick you up. He said he’s sorry.”

I froze, confused. My dad had never mentioned anyone like him before. I didn’t know this man, but he spoke with such confidence, like it was obvious I should know him. The way he smiled made my stomach twist. 

He looked at Mrs. Ramirez. “I’m Mike. His dad asked me to grab him; he’s stuck in traffic. I’ll get him home safe.”

Mrs. Ramirez barely looked up from her screen. “Oh, okay, sure. You know the drill,” she said, dismissively. She waved her hand, not even checking to see if what he said made sense. 

I felt the knot in my stomach tighten. I wanted to ask her to call my dad, but something about the way he was staring at me—his smile never faltering—kept me quiet. I grabbed my backpack slowly, feeling like I was watching the whole thing from outside my own body.

“Come on,” he said, still smiling. “Let’s get you home.”

I followed him outside, my heart beating in my ears. His car wasn’t in the usual line where parents picked us up. It was parked farther away, nearly hidden at the end of the block, just beyond the reach of the school’s front lights. A beat-up old station wagon, the kind with peeling paint and rusted edges. The windows were dark, too dark to see inside.

My feet felt heavy as I walked toward it. Everything inside me screamed to turn around, to run back into the school, but my legs moved as if they were on autopilot. 

He opened the passenger door and gestured for me to get in. “Hop in, bud. We’ll be home in no time.”

The air inside the car smelled off—like something damp and rotting. I hesitated before sliding into the seat, my skin prickling with unease. He closed the door behind me, sealing me inside with that thick, sour air. 

As we pulled away from the school, I noticed something strange: he wasn’t driving in the direction of my house. My mind started to race. “Where are we going?” I asked, my voice barely louder than a whisper.

“Just stopping by my place first,” he said, his eyes fixed on the road. “I left something important there, and I promised your dad I’d be quick.”

I didn’t say anything. My stomach churned. Something was very wrong.

The neighborhood we drove into wasn’t like mine. The houses were smaller, older, with cracked sidewalks and overgrown lawns. His house was near the end of a quiet street, barely standing out from the others. The windows were small, dirty, and barred. The porch sagged under the weight of neglect, and the front door hung crooked on its hinges.

“We’ll be quick,” he repeated as we got out of the car. He unlocked the front door and motioned for me to follow. “Come on in. I’ll just grab my stuff, and we’ll head out.”

I stepped inside, and immediately, the smell hit me—stronger now. The house felt suffocating. The air was thick, stale, and damp, like it hadn’t been aired out in years. The walls were yellowed with age, and the floor creaked with each step. I hovered near the entrance, too afraid to go any further.

The living room was cluttered, piles of old newspapers and magazines stacked haphazardly against the walls. And then I saw it—something that made my blood turn to ice. 

There were photographs on the wall. Dozens of them. All of me.

I stared, my breath catching in my throat. They were pictures from all over—me at the park, me riding my bike, me walking home from school. Some were taken from far away, others disturbingly close. My mind raced, trying to make sense of it. How long had he been watching me?

I felt his presence behind me, too close, and I jumped when he spoke again.

“Hey,” he said, his voice soft but unsettling. “Why don’t you come down to the basement with me? I’ve got something really cool to show you.”

My stomach twisted violently. Every part of me screamed to say no, but the words wouldn’t come. I nodded slowly, not trusting my voice. He smiled, satisfied, and pointed toward a door at the end of the hallway. “It’s just down there.”

He walked ahead, leaving the door slightly open. I heard the creak of the stairs as he descended into the darkness. The air from the basement felt colder, heavy, as if something was lurking down there, waiting. 

“Come on,” he called up, his voice echoing from below. “Come see what I’ve got for you.”

I stood at the top of the stairs, my heart hammering in my chest. I could hear his footsteps down there, slow, deliberate. He called my name again, his voice more urgent this time.

Something told me if I went down those stairs, I wouldn’t come back up.

I bolted for the front door, my hands fumbling with the lock. The old, rusted latch stuck for a moment, and I thought I heard his footsteps coming back up the stairs. Panic surged through me, and I yanked at the door, finally wrenching it open. I ran.

I sprinted down the street, my lungs burning, my legs aching. I didn’t stop until I reached the house a few doors down. I pounded on the door, tears streaming down my face, barely able to speak when someone finally answered. 

The police were called. They took me in, and I sat wrapped in a blanket, trembling in the back of the squad car, trying to explain what had happened. But even I didn’t fully understand it.

When they entered his house, they found more than I could have imagined.

The basement was worse than anything I had pictured in my mind. Photos—hundreds of them—covered every inch of the walls. They were all of me. But there were other rooms, and those rooms held secrets darker than I could comprehend.

There were boxes, dozens of them, filled with photographs of other boys. Some looked younger than me, others older, and all of them were captured in horrifying, intimate moments. Some of the photos were so graphic, so detailed, the police refused to let anyone see them. The man had been watching us—stalking us—documenting every moment of our lives without us even knowing.

I was the lucky one, they said. The only one who got away. The others—some of them—were never found.

After that day, I never let my teacher out of my sight again. I clung to her in aftercare, never trusting anyone to pick me up, never trusting the world the way I used to.

I was always afraid that I’d look up I would see him again. Watching. Waiting. And even though they said he was in custody, I knew there were more like him out there, and that they were watching too. And every night, I dream of that house. Of the basement I never went down into. Of the voices of the other boys who weren’t as lucky as me, calling out from the dark, waiting for someone to find them.
