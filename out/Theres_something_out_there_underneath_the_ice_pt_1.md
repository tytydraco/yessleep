"Bishop to g5," I said into the microphone. "Bishop takes pawn. Check." 

There was a faint electric crackle over the headset as Donovan considered his next move. We were miles apart, separated by a heavy snowstorm that left the outside world in a blur of white fuzz. In my mind, I could still see him squirming in his computer chair, could picture his lips gently moving as he whispered to himself his next move. 

"King to d7," Donovan replied. 

"Can't. Queen at a4. You'll put yourself in check." 

A faint groan escaped my headphones. Donovan had been operating on maybe three hours of sleep. His head wasn't in the game. The nightmares were getting to him. Getting to us all in their own way, but I was used to little sleep. 

Before I started working at the United States remote research station: Outpost Delta, I lived with my older brother and his girlfriend. They had a 2 year old and a newborn. Sleep was a luxury that I hadn't experienced for almost four years running. 

"Fine," Donovan said. "King to c8." 

"Knight to e7. Check...again." 

"You think I don't see what you're doing, you little shit?" 

"Please, enlighten me." I had to stifle the laughter from my voice. "What am I doing?" 

"Trying to force me into the corner," Donovan said. "You're lucky I don't have my queen anymore. Your king is wide open." 

"You should probably do something about that once you're not in check." 

"Yeah, real funny. Keep laughing." He didn't make a move for a while, and when he did, there was a growl in his voice. "King to b8." 

"You're getting awfully close to that corner, my friend." 

"Why couldn't we have just played Guess Who like I wanted?" 

"Because we've played Guess Who almost a hundred times by now, and I'm sick of it." 

"But I hate Chess. I actually hate it." 

"You just don't have the patience for it." 

In the year we'd known each other, that was the first thing I came to find out about him. The second was that he was an immense cinephile. When he wasn't wasting his time playing board games with me, or working, he was on the couch watching a movie. 

"You know what I miss?" he said. 

"Papa John's pizza and Netflix?" 

"Come on! I mean, who doesn't?" We laughed about that. "I miss Runescape." 

"Never got into it. My brother did for a while." 

"Let me tell you, it's a lot more fun than Chess." 

"You're only saying that because you're losing." 

Before he could respond, another voice intercepted our conversation. "Have either of you talked to Edvard lately?" 

It was Mia from Cabin G. We were all part of a research team observing odd phenomenon in Antarctica. Recent tremors and unusual climate change effects. Harsh storms at least two or three occurrences a week followed by hot days. Not necessarily hot in the normal sense, but relatively, it was warmer in the artic than it should've been. 

"No, I don't think so." I double-checked the daily log beside my computer rig. "He hasn't been on the public channel since this morning." 

"Don?" Mia asked. 

"A quick call on a private channel around two or three," Donovan said. "Nothing important. Just wanted to see if I needed anymore supplies before he sends the registry to the company. Why, what's up?" 

"He got ahold of me about an hour ago--" 

"Little early for a booty call, don't you think?" 

The airwaves went silent aside from the static. I clamped my hand over my mouth to keep from laughing. 

"Sorry, not funny," Donovan said, but his tone implied otherwise. "Seriously, though, what's up?" 

"Nothing," she said, "I just can't get ahold of him." 

"He's probably taking a nap. Hard to keep a normal sleep schedule out here." 

Donovan wasn't wrong. The nights felt endless, and the daytime was fleeting at best. Perpetual darkness around the clock. The increase in storms weren't helping either. It was hard to get out from under the covers when you were constantly bombarded by the cold. 

Our cabins had heating systems, but it just wasn't the same. Wasn't as cozy or safe as being beneath the blankets the company provided us with. Some days, you know the type, I didn't get out of my pajamas. On those mornings, I wouldn't even bother with a cup of coffee. Instead, I'd just make some hot chocolate, curl up in my computer chair with a blanket draped across my shoulders, and try not to fall asleep. 

It was especially difficult during the off season. The rest of our colleagues were airlifted home for the holidays. The four of us 'volunteered' to stay behind as the skeleton crew. Keep up with the research and monitoring until the New Year passed. 

The others were scheduled to return January 6th. Then, we would get transported back home for about a week and a half to visit our relatives or do whatever we wanted. Not a bad trade-off considering the extra pay. Time and a half for the weekdays, double time for the weekends. 

"I don't know," Mia said softly. Her voice was a faint whisper against the wall of static from the storm. "Something doesn't feel right." 

"What'd he last say to you?" I asked. 

"He thought someone was knocking on his door." 

"Bullshit," Donovan cut in. 

"No, he did!" 

"I'm not saying he didn't, but that's impossible. There's no one else out here but us. Guy just needs to get more sleep." 

Again, Donovan wasn't wrong. But to get more sleep implied getting any sleep to begin with. 

"That's not all," Mia continued. "He checked outside his front door and found footprints in the snow. Thought he saw someone out there too." 

I swiveled in my chair, turning to access the navigational radar to the left of my computer
The display showed a circular grid with all the cabins pre-rendered into the system. When we had a full team, there would have been twenty-six colored dots on the screen. One at every cabin. 

Instead, there were only four dots showing. One at Cabin C (Donovan), another at Cabin J (that was me), and a third at Cabin Y (Mia). Edvard was supposed to be at Cabin R, but his transmitter was casting a signal about two miles north of Cabin M. 

"What the hell?" I whispered, restarting the system in hopes that it might recalibrate. 

It had done this before. Almost two months ago. There was an interference of some kind that set all of our equipment on the fritz. GPS kept scattering our transmitters all over the place. Lights were going on and off. Communications were down for half the cabins. Everything was a mess. 

Oscar, from Cabin D, even had his power go out. Luckily, the back-up generator kicked on long enough until Rita, from Cabin L, got over there to perform some much-needed maintenance on his fusebox. Blown circuit, corroded wires. Whole thing had to be replaced. 

It was a bad time for Donovan. The company couldn't send replacement parts for almost a week, so he and Oscar had to share a living space for a little while. The cabins are about the size of a studio apartment, maybe slightly bigger. As you might imagine, cramped spaces aren't an ideal environment for multiple people. And you can't exactly complain about the other person without being overheard. 

After the fact, they were good sports about it. Oscar requested a care package during a supply order. Choclate-covered cherries, a variety pack of chips, and a whole assortment of other goodies that he sent Donovan's way. In retur, Donovan ordered some books, movies, and video games for Oscar's 3DS. 

When the radar came back online, the dots were all the same. Edvard's transmitter still put him out by Cabin M, located in the middle of nowhere. 

"Hey, Mia," I said, "did Edvard say anything else to you?" 

"No," she said. "I told him they were probably his footsteps from last night or something. That there's no out here but us." 

"I checked the radar, looks like he's out by Henry's place." 

"What the hell is doing out there?" Donovan remarked. 

"No clue," I said. "You guys keep trying his handheld. I'll take the Snow Cat out to him and see whats going on. If you get a hold of him, radio me." 

The cabins were each located about a mile apart from each other. The distance could vary depending on the terrain. A little far on foot, but a quick trip for the plow. 

Of course, that was assuming the weather would be forgiving. Unfortunately, it wasn't. 

Snow came down in curtains, pelting the windshield with bits of ice, sticking to its surface. I turned the wipers on, but there was only so much they could do in a storm like that. 

It took me about half an hour to get there. Even when I arrived, I couldn't be sure if Edvard was actually there. Everything was white, and the snow flurries were funneling in a conical pattern, spinning around me until up was down and left was right. 

I pulled the hood of my coat over my head and anchored myself to the Snow Cat with climbing rope. Thick and durable. A reel almost 100 yards in length. Enough to travel the span of a football field. It might sound dumb, but in an environment like that, it doesn't take much to get lost. And with the low temps, you can't be exposed to the cold for more than maybe ten to twenty minutes without facing serious repercussions. 

I checked the compass I kept in my coat pocket and wandered out into the storm heading northeast. Every analyst was equipped with proper gear for outdoor travel: boots, insulated coat and pants, gloves, goggles, and a face mask. Still, the cold was unbearable. Felt like my skin was on fire, and I'd only been out there for a few minutes. 

I tried to call Edvard's name, but there was nothing I could do against the howl of the wind. Every word was swallowed by it, suppressed into a muffled whisper. I got lucky though. Edvard had left his Snow Cat's headlights on, and through the mist, I followed the pair of yellow beams. 

The windows were frosted over, and the exterior was coated in snow. I pulled on the handle and threw the driver's side door open. It was empty, but the interior lights were still on. I could hear Donovan's and Mia's voices coming in over the radio. 

"Houston to Edvard, you there Edvard?" Donovan said. "Do you read me, space cadet?" 

"Ed?" came Mia. "Can you hear me?" 

I moved to answer their calls, but then, out the other window, I saw a silhouette against the white backdrop of the blizzard. 

I leapt from the Snow Cat and sprinted towards the shadow. The boots were heavy and awkward. The insulation padding for the coat and pants didn't allow much in the way of mobility. It was like trying to walk in one of those inflatable Halloween costumes. 

With enough determination, I reached him. He stood still as a corpse, staring down at the ground. He was dressed in gear similar to mine, his own colored a shade of orange. But after so long in the storm, it had all been frosted white. An anatomically correct snowman. 

Usually, you can tell when a person is breathing because of the fog around their mouth, but there was no mist with Edvard. No indication of life until I grabbed his shoulder. Then, he turned towards me, his face concealed beneath a pair of goggles and a thick balaclava. 

"Come on!" I yelled. "You're going to freeze to death out here!" 

Somehow, in spite of the wind or the sound of my beating heart, I heard Edvard speak. A frail, breathless whisper: "I was here."
