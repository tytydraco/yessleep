Art… was never really something I wanted to do. While it was a family thing starting all the way back with my Grandfather I didn’t inherit the artistic eye or touch. Hell my stick fingers looked like shit. I don’t even understand how you can fuck up a Goddamn line? 

 But that’s not what this story is about. The story is about my Grandfather kind of. The artistic skill he had was passed to almost everyone in the family tree on my dads side. My father and his father all the way back to my Grandfather and probably beyond. As far back as my damn family line goes. All the men in my family had been blessed in one way or another with beautiful artistic skill. My father was given the skill of glorious oil pastel work riveling all artists of the same nature and medium. However in the modern area with a focus on damned abstract art. None of his pieces were appreciated by the more modern viewers. His pieces, despite their beauty and depth, went widely unappreciated.

 His greatest piece “***In Animata Oculis***” a Magnus opus that had no equivalent in the era he worked. The picture. Is that of a woman standing in a luxurious lavender field a mix of purple hues with the luxurious reds yellows and oranges of the setting sun behind her. The bright wholesome colors, a stark contrast to the empty void of darkness that is her eyes. Making them clearly obvious. Some people find the painting highly disturbing, some claiming that “it looks at me”. However only a small amount of its viewers feel the necrotic fear it elicits. 

 Though the feeling is most likely due to the different application of a black… almost void like black paint instead of pastel that is used in the eyes. The woman, however, is otherwise completely normal dressed in a flowing blue and violet gown. I often looked at the piece admiring it but wondering what made my father paint the eyes in such a way as that. Perturbing and disturbing. When I asked him what the inspiration for the eyes was, he replied “One doesn’t draw what they don’t see” in a horse tone. 

 Damn, I got sidetracked, my apologies. You came here because of my grandfather. An artist talented in water paints and acrylics and to draw wonderful scenery with them. One of his works. “NeoNew York in the Rain” a cyber reality of New York in the far future though done in the early 1970s it still conveyed a strikingly modern appearance with sleek cars and computers a very unique way compared to the others of his time who saw the bulky computers and equipment conveyed it in their movies and literature. 

 But his Magnum Opus, a far cry from his normal gorgeous and colorful work, their beauty and serenity a balm to the world. Was a piece called “***Regnum Spirituum***” a piece comprised of simply Black, Grey and White scale colors Seemingly, depicted a bleak plain in which the grass though determined to live was failing as all other things. There are spirits, or phantoms, depending on who you ask, of those unfortunate enough to manifest or be called to be and exist on the malignant plain, if one could even call their blighted state “existing”. Instead likely craving the sweet release of obliteration. A lesser evil to their cursed state.

 Though it was my grandfather's magnum opus it was seen as more of a curse upon the family as no one wanted to buy the piece. And simply it disturbed everyone who saw it. No one wanted to look at its stark and cursed face for more than a second before feeling nausea at its sight.

 That is where I come into the story. I had no talent for any medium in the artistic sense. However I held a pencil or pen and could write elegant narratives on just about any topic and by the time I was fourteen I had written my first novela. But I could not get the handle on a slick wood brush or fill in a piece with foul smelling markers with the alcoholic scent they exhumed. 

 Not to say that I didn’t admire art, for I did. I enjoyed visiting my relatives' studios and admiring their latest project. Beautiful works that brought tears of admiration and awe to their beautiful works. I took a special liking to my grandfather's ode to waste and loathing though. Much more than anyone else in my family, or the world at large. I thought the piece to be thought provoking and interesting, it was disturbing yes. But no more so than any other horror pieces that had been done in my family. My uncle made a piece entirely out of rusted nails and screws he had found in an abandoned house. Supposedly the scene of a grizzly murder, suicide case. And used them to make a sculpture of a man being torn from reality to a foul pit of hell.

 My grandfather's piece on the other hand had some unique aspects that made it more interesting than disturbing. Which is why when I learned I had acquired the piece in the will from my grandfather I was ecstatic. 

 At first I was surprised that my grandfather had willed it to me. I figured it would either be donated to some museum of bleak and loathsome works or burned to end its blight on my family. He had known my fascination in it but had never shown any interest in giving it to me though I frequently asked. But I had finally gotten the piece I had wanted. 

 When I brought it home my wife, Sarah, wasn't thrilled about it being in our home but I hoped in time she would like it enough to be able to admire it with me. I hung it up in my study to look at as I worked allowing me to admire my forefathers work. Often I would be working on my next story and glance up at it to admire the work and when I looked down I saw that my hands had been moving across the keyboard on their own and that an hour or so had passed and that my writing talent had been awoken in full. In front of me on my computer screen sat a well written, if short story. But as I continued to I found viewing the painting helped more and more as time went on. I came out of my stupors of creativity and often felt like my hands had been guided by my grandpa. As though he had helped me in my endeavor to paint beautiful pictures with words. 

 He helped me find my talent and let it blossom and grow. His hand on my shoulder, kind and guiding. Leading me down the path to something I enjoyed and was good at. Instead of forcing my hand to artistry and something I didn't enjoy. 

 I became a very successful Sci-Fi and Fantasy writer. With well read titles such as “Frontier 20” and “Beyond the Deep Cold black”, finally I had done something that made my parents proud of me and my accomplishments. I was no longer a burden on my family but finally someone who had brought new fame to our family legacy.

 The painting was the center. The painting and my grandfather, his clawed, lifeless hands there to guide me. He guided me into worlds previously unseen by the eyes of mortal men. Powerful things. Gods… gods at the centers of universes with untold vastness the edges of their spiraling forms unfolding in the vastness. Expanding from the inky blackness of the void. They laughed, they cried, they danced, they fought and died, they lied to one another. Lies that determined the fates of countless lives and whole galaxies. Their lives, similar to ours, but where we cast a stone into an ant colony and it interrupts their lives. They cast a stone and an interplanetary war starts, shed a tear and birth a new multicolored celestial body. Bleed and create a new universe and civilization with it. Their lives and essence, the thing that keeps the universe together. 

 All these and more my grandfather showed me. My dark ferryman and revelation to unseen things. His decayed hand, ever on my shoulder as he showed me these glorious things. He showed me and I wrote and I dreamed. 

 It happened after I returned from a vacation on the west coast. I had visited Utah and seen the Great Silent Wall. A beautiful mountain though in some strange way foreboding as though it had its secrets to share. When I returned from the trip and all the lavish hotels and parties I had stayed at and gone to. Me and Sarah returned to our own bed deeply comfortable and happy. We shared a night more lovely and beautiful than any other save our wedding night. I enjoyed her and her me. We slept and dreamt together of wonderful things. Not of gods and worlds but of each other.

 That morning I awoke with a start a sense of panic washed over me though I could not tell why. As I thought, I realized what it was that bothered me so profoundly. I had forgotten the names of my stories I had written. And not just forgot but they ceased to exist for me. As I pulled “**The Overview Effect**” (I later learned which it was) off my shelf and looked at its cover I saw nothing but the smooth leather surface was barren. I opened it and saw my words written on the page but they didnt feel like mine anymore.

 I sat in my office the entirety of the day pondering on what to do about my degradation trip I was on. I looked at the piece yearning for my grandfather to place his hand on my shoulder and to guide me back to worlds untold. But the closer I tried to get the further away from me it ran ever out of my grasp. I would need to atone for what I had done. For being unfaithful to Him.

 That night as I sat my gaze still fixed on the painting I thought of my life. Of how much of a failure I was to my parents and family. Of my first job when I was ten forced to work for my food as my parents found my lack of ability to paint or draw an impertinent burden upon them. Then I thought of the happiness of my first kiss and the pain of my first breakup. The love as I married Sarah and the elation that night. I thought of my life and its meaninglessness, how I was nothing in a universe of gods and worlds of horrible and wonderful things. And as I pondered my mind drifted to thoughts of grand things. The beings that lay betwixt the star splattered sky. Of gods and universes. Of the death and birth galaxies. I saw civilizations that made humans' most grandiose dreams seem like sticks and stones in comparison. When I awoke from my stupor I found myself one again in front of a well written novel of grandiose proportions. My gift had returned as had the guiding hand of my grandfather though now that he had returned it felt less like his hand on my shoulder and more like some malefic creature feeding off of me and my soul chewing through my psyche and soul. Hungering for more. The bastard creature, my source of strength and malignant undoing. 

 I continued down the path to my foul downfall. It occurred slowly at first in trivial things. I developed a small stutter, forgetting the path of my words, my tongue slipping as I spoke to editors or publishers. Hell with anyone really. A small problem but i knew it was but the start of my punishment for my sins.

 The night before I was blessed one last time. A tear came into my eye as I dreamt. I saw the birth of a star, a wondrous hue of colors some unseen by humans shot forth from it as it came into being and its concurrent galaxy with it. A wonder to behold vast in its beauty. Though not something to describe in mortal words, something too beautiful too glorious to share. Something only minds with power can behold. Any others viewing it would only bastardize its beauty.

 That morning I awoke to Sarah tapping and shaking my shoulder. “Honey… Honey! Are you ok?!” she pressed “Are you ok babe? You’ve been whispering things all morning!” as she said this a tear of horror and realization dripped down my face. Not because of what I saw or what my wife said. But because of what I heard. She… she said my name. 

 Not a pet name. Not honey or babe she said my real goddamn name. My ears heard her say something else. But my mind saw her say my real name. Tears fell freely down my face now. The hand on my shoulder, the hand of what I had thought to be my grandfather slid off my shoulder in a slow, chilling way. Leaving my mind a void where I had once seen glorious things I saw nought but void and emptiness. It had left me and taken not just my skill in literary arts, but also my name and my ability to trust myself. For if I my own name when it was spoken how could I know what I was hearing was truthful and real? As my mind considered these damned realities. I slowly retreated further into myself feeling the punishment He had given me for my disobedience, my disobedience to Him the Father. I searched myself for the one thing that mattered. I searched the cosmos and found things that are indescribable. But not my name. The Father was there watching my suffering. Cruel company. Eons. Without a name I exist no more. 

 I found myself in a place of gray, black and white scale colors. A place where the grass despite its best efforts to live was slowly dying like the rest of the flora.
