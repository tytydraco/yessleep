I was nothing, floating in an endless black sea.

Then the lightning struck.

I was no longer tossing and turning in a void of my own non-existence.

My skin was prickling, my fingers were twitching, my arms chafed on metal restraints. I opened my eyes and countless lights assaulted me, but only one figure—a young man, fair of face and of hair, his muscles glistened with sweat and his eyes glittered with interest.

My eyes flickered around the room, I saw a window, A window! How did I know that word? Then my eyes saw past it, saw water falling from the sky… Rain! The Borrowed Brain in my head began to hum to life with old memories. My eyes continued to pass over the room, beakers, vials, rulers, all these words flooded into my brain until I began to draw a conclusion about the room, it was a lab, my brain whirred, and i began to parallel my own situation with works of fiction consumed by those who formerly inhabited parts of my body. 

This Frankenstein, my maker, wore a white lab coat, and brown khaki pants, his black undershirt seemed to consume all the light in the room. But then he… Recoiled? This happened immediately after he caught my gaze, though I did not yet realise the correlation and then he began to weep. I tried to reach for him, to comfort him, but great rings of metal stunted this motion. Soon the misery in his face turned to rage and he turned on me.

Every stick, every beaker, every vial crashed down upon me and broke with futility in the process.

“Why… Won’t… You… Die?”

These four words, heavy and laboured, were my first experience with the English language.

…and they would teach me but one thing…

Hate.

The rest of a broken vial cut towards my neck like a knife,and my body raged, every mismatched cell in my body, every nerve crossing my body sparked to life and, in retaliation, nay, in a burst of anger and adrenaline, I shattered the restraints and grabbed him by the neck with a satisfying crack.

He went limp.

I found something in the pocket of this dead man who had made me—it was a mirror, and as I looked at it, I realised my body was not so unfamiliar, save one thing—his eyes were warm, calm, and a bright, beachy blue,  whereas my eyes were a fluorescent orange and wore an undressed sadness. They were beautiful—or so I first thought.

You see, Nothing of me is original. I am the combined effort of everyone I’ve met.

And all I've known is hatred from those different to me.

In the next days, months, years of my life I spent studying my maker’s notes, this taught me but two things:

Firstly, The method of my own creation.

And Secondly, most importantly, How disgusting my abnormal eyes really were.

Then I began it, the project - Raiding the corpses my maker had so egotistically stored in his vaults, with them, and with my maker's own rotting corpse, I began to build myself a friend.

Then the lightning struck.

And her eyes were green.
