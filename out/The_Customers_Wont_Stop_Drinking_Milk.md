 It was just another normal day in your average small town.  

 My food supply was getting low in my apartment building so i had to go out to the store. 

 I went to my local Save-A-Lot and right off the bat I see a poster about a new product. 

 It had a picture of a cartoonish looking man wearong a white store outfit holding a jug of milk. The sign said: Try out our new Miracle Milk! With lower prices than regular millk! It's a steal! 

 I just scoff and went into the store. I hate advertisements. 

 So I went in and grabbed a few things and went to the back to the dairy aisle. My face quickly turned into a frown. Instead of the milk i normally get sitting there is a whole row of Miracle Milk!  

 "Fuck", I say to myself getting ready to head to the front. 

 Suddenly an old woman who was just standing there for a few minutes got a jug. I thought nothing of it and went past her. Suddenly I hear the lid of the jug plopping on the floor and big gulps coming from her. 

 Gulp! Gulp! Gulp! 

 The old woman drunk that gallon in only a couple of minutes and threw the jug down. My shocked expression couldn't go any further when she grabbed another jug of Miracle Milk! And started drinking it. 

 "Hey!" Dan the manager of the store yelled at her a few feet away from me. 

 "What the hell do you think your doing! You know your going to have to pay for that!" His words just flying away from the old woman who just there down the jug reaching for a third. 

 As Dan walked up to her to grab her shoulders suddenly a couple of the onlookers started grabbing gallons of milk. 

 "Stop it!" Dan yells not reaching anybody. Someone brushed pass me almost knocking me down and started drinking. 

 "Hey what's your problem?" I yelled at the guy. But he didn't even pay attention to me as he was fighting for a jug another store goer got. 

 I watched in fear as the guy that brushed past me yanks the jug out of the womans hands and hit her across the head. 

 Dan screamed as the woman fell to the floor as if the jug of milk was a piece of wood. I was about to leave my stuff there and run when my face looked toward the old woman who started it all. 

 My heart sunk as her skin was mostly hollow. Her fat was just dragging across the floor as milk was dripping from all ober her. 

 She was starting on her 10th jug. 

 I screamed and ran towards the front of the store as more of the customers started to drink and turn hollow. 

 I ran through the parking lot and got into my car and drove fast to my apartment. 

 I was scared shitless and didn't know what to do. I just showered and went to bed hoping my nerves would calm down and i was having a bad dream. 

 The next day I decided to test my dream theory and went back to the store. My heart started beating as I recognize the cars from last night. 

 I went and headed to the door and opened it. It wouldn't budge. I looked down to see if it was locked and my heart sunk. It was Dan, or what was left of him, laying face down with blood all over him. 

 After I puked in the parking lot I took another glance inside the store. The customers that were inside are now skinny hollow creatures dragging their own skin behind them. 

 I fled out of there real fast and came home. I don't know what to do. What did that milk do to all them people? I'm asking all of you since I think the police would call me crazy. 

 Just don't buy the milk.
