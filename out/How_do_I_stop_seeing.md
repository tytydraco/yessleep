I fix watches for a living. I like things that fail in understandable ways. Springs lose tension. Oil dries. Gears slip. You can see the cause, isolate it, correct it. Time behaves if you’re careful enough.
I didn’t think bodies worked like that.

The first thing I noticed was an itch in my left palm. Not on the skin. Under. Deep, where the bones meet, like something was rooting around in the marrow. I checked for splinters, for cuts. Nothing. I washed my hands until the skin wrinkled. The itch stayed.

Three days later, the skin tightened like a drumhead. It became waxy, shiny under the workshop light. A thin, perfect slit opened in the centre of my palm. It didn’t bleed. It was not a tear. It was an aperture. It had opened.
Inside was something dark and wet. I probed it with the fine tip of my tweezers. The wet thing shuddered, and then, with a soft, sticky sound, it rolled over.
It blinked.
There was an eye in my hand.

I slapped a bandage over it. I could feel it shift, the pupil dilating against the gauze. I ran my hand under the ice-cold tap, a punishment. The eye did not flinch. When I shut the water off, in the dripping silence, I heard a faint, wet schick as it turned to follow the last drop’s path down the drain.

I wrapped my hand in thick layers. I wore a leather glove over it. At night, lying in bed, I could feel its slow, methodical movement. It wasn’t random. It was surveying. Panning across the ceiling, tracing the window frame, settling on the dark shape of my bedroom door.
Then my vision began to double.
I’d be looking at a broken mainspring from my own eyes, and simultaneously, I’d see the edge of my workbench from a low, tilted angle—from my hand, resting on the table. The nausea was instant, vertigo of the soul. I started missing my cuts, scratching brass, my hands trembling.

Then I started seeing things that weren’t in my room.
A popcorn-textured ceiling I didn’t recognize. The smell of stale cigarettes and lilac air freshener. A hand, pale, with bitten nails—reaching down toward me, and a wave of terror that was so visceral, so alien, it made me vomit. Then it would snap, and I’d be back in my own sweat-soaked sheets, gasping.
This kept happening. The angle was always low. From inside a crib. From the floor of a car. From inside a purse.

I searched online, my typing clumsy with the glove. I found a forum, buried in an obscure medical subreddit. The title: REMOVAL METHODS?
The posts were frantic, coded, terrified.
“Black orb under the skin of my thigh. Pressure. Feels like it’s looking at me from the inside out.”
“Left shoulder blade. It watches me sleep. I see my own back in my dreams.”
“It’s in my ankle. I see feet walking past. Strangers’ feet. All day.”
They shared desperate, brutal ideas. Needles heated with lighters. Kitchen knives. Promises of “digging it out.”

I read their details. Specific street names. A unique paisley bedspread. A tattoo of a sparrow on a wrist. I’d seen these things. In my visions.
A cold, understanding crystallized in my gut.
I wasn’t just hosting an eye. I wasn’t just seeing through others’ eyes.
I was the hub. The central connection. All their signals were routing through me. The eye in my palm wasn’t just watching for me. It was watching through me, broadcasting everything back to the network, and piping their sightlines directly into my brain.

The visions became a collected mess. A jagged street view from a shoulder. A blurred bathroom floor from ankle-height. The searing white of a hospital light from the back of a neck. A child’s toy, enormous and close. Fragments of a dozen stolen lives, screaming into my mind. It was an avalanche of intimate trespass.

The forum turned dark. The desperation curdled into rage.
“It’s not random. We’re being watched ON PURPOSE.”
“There has to be a source. A main line.”
“If we find it, we cut it. We blind the watcher.”
They were hunting. They were hunting for me, and they didn’t even know my name.

I felt their attempts. Not psychically. Physically.
A user named SparrowWrist posted: “Tried a needle. Got deep. It flinched. I think I hurt it.”
At that exact moment, a white-hot sting lanced through the centre of my left palm. I cried out, ripping the glove off. The eye in my hand was weeping a clear, viscous fluid. It was wide with panic—her panic.
Another, PopcornCeiling, wrote: “Holding a knife. Going to try to pry it out of my calf tonight. Wish me luck.”
A terrible, grinding pressure bloomed in my lower leg, a bone-deep ache of imminent violation. I felt her resolve, her terror, as if they were my own.
I was their unwitting surveillance operator, and they were fighting back, their scalpels and needles and knives sending shockwaves of pain directly down the connection to me. I was watching them try to mutilate their way to freedom, and every cut was a message addressed to my soul.

I stopped repairing watches. Time was no longer a series of ticks to be corrected. It was a smear of overlapping, screaming nows.

The realization was a quiet, dead thing.
I was not a victim. I was the infestation.
I was the keystone. The broadcaster. As long as my eye functioned, the network lived. As long as I drew breath, these people—a woman with a sparrow tattoo, a man who lived under a popcorn ceiling, a dozen others,they would never know a moment of privacy in their own skin. Their most intimate moments would be my violated visions. Their pain would be my pain.
This was not a problem with a mechanical fix. There was no spare part, no cleaning solution. A watch can be taken apart and reassembled.
Some systems only have one failsafe.

I went into my workshop one last time. The silence here was different. It was the silence of a stopped clock. I didn’t go to my bench. I went to the old vice bolted to the heavy oak leg in the corner.
I selected a tool. Not a scalpel. Not a needle. A blunt, purposeful instrument. A watchmaker’s hammer. Small. Dense. Final.

I sat on the cold concrete floor, my back against the leg. I placed my left hand, palm up, in the iron jaws of the vice. I didn’t look at the eye. I could feel it watching me, sensing the intent. I felt a flicker—not from it, but from them. A collective, distant shiver of premonition across the city.
I tightened the vice slowly. The metal jaws closed around my wrist, snug, immovable. A perfect restraint.
I waited in the mental storm, the shattered mosaic of other people’s lives flashing behind my own eyes, until I saw a single, clear moment. Someone was laughing, truly laughing, at something on her phone. A private, unobserved joy. It was beautiful.
I raised the hammer. I had to. 
I didn’t bring it down on the eye.
I brought it down on the vice.
A single, solid, professional strike to the locking screw. The mechanism, designed to hold, obeyed. It was a beautiful, understanding piece of engineering. It instantly tightened with a force no human hand could muster.
There was a sound. Not a scream. Not a pop. A crunch, deep and muffled. Like compacting wet gravel. The structure, not the liquid.
It did not feel violent. It felt like a switch being turned off.

The mental noise didn’t fade. It vanished. As if a cathedral full of screaming voices had been instantly, utterly silenced.
The pressure in my palm, the crawling presence I had lived with for weeks, was simply gone. 
Then, for one final flicker, I saw them:
A woman in a kitchen stared at her thigh, her hand frozen over a bloody needle, her face slack with sudden, inexplicable relief.
A man on his bathroom floor dropped a kitchen knife, clutching his calf, sobbing as a lifelong sense of being watched dissolved into empty air.
A dozen others, pausing, touching their scars, feeling for the first time in months the simple, terrifying solitude of their own bodies.
The silence here is also total.
The pain is immense, a solid, roaring thing anchored in the ruin of my hand. But it is my pain. Mine alone. It doesn’t echo. It doesn’t broadcast.
I can see the steady, quiet dial of my own wristwatch from my own eyes. Time is linear again. It is failing in an understandable way.
The blood is pooling on the concrete, a dark, expanding oil slick. It behaves as it should.
Soon, it will stop.
That's all I need to make sure.
