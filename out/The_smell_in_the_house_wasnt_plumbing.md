A few months ago, **a close friend and I** travelled to a small town to visit someone we had known from college. Hotels were expensive, so he suggested we stay at **a friend's** instead.  
He said the house was on the edge of town—quiet, cheap, and empty most of the time.

It sounded perfect.

When we arrived, the house didn’t look strange at all. Old, yes—but clean. Paint peeling in places, a small garden out front, nothing that raised alarms.

What did catch my attention was the smell.

It wasn’t overpowering. Just… heavy. Like spoiled food left out too long. I remember wrinkling my nose and joking that someone needed to clean their fridge.

My friend laughed. “Probably old plumbing.”

Our host greeted us warmly. He was polite, soft-spoken, offered us water, asked about our trip. If anything, he seemed a little too normal. Too calm.

He showed us to our room and left us alone.

That first night passed without incident. We talked, scrolled on our phones, and eventually slept. The smell lingered faintly in the hallway, but I ignored it. Old houses have weird odors.

The next morning is when things started to feel wrong.

I woke up coughing.

My throat burned, and my eyes watered like I’d slept in smoke. My friend was already awake, sitting on the edge of the bed, holding his shirt over his nose.

“It smells like… meat,” he whispered.

Not cooked meat. Not food.

Raw. Metallic. Sweet and rotten at the same time.

The smell was everywhere now—our room, the hallway, the stairs. It grew stronger as we followed it toward the kitchen, each step making my stomach churn.

Near the fridge, it was unbearable.

The refrigerator door was streaked with dark stains—brownish-red, cracked and dry, like something had been wiped off in a hurry and left to rot.

My hands were shaking when I opened it.

Inside was not food.

The fridge was stuffed wall to wall with flesh—no packaging, no labels. Just wet, pale pieces stacked like groceries. Maggots crawled in the corners. Flies buzzed lazily, trapped inside.

I couldn’t breathe.

My friend gagged and stumbled backward.

That’s when we heard footsteps behind us.

The man who owned the house stood in the doorway.

He didn’t look angry.  
He didn’t look surprised.

He just stared at us—eyes empty, mouth slightly curved upward.

Then he rushed forward.

Everything after that blurs together. Screaming. Pain. My friend yelling my name as he was dragged away. Hands slipping in blood. My own voice breaking as I ran.

I don’t remember leaving the house. I only remember running until my lungs burned, straight to the police station.

They didn’t believe me at first.

But when they returned with me, their faces changed.

The drainage ditch around the house was clogged—thick with decomposing flesh, tangled in plastic, floating like garbage in dark water.

They arrested him.

They found my friend alive in a locked back room—injured, barely conscious, whispering things that made the officers step away in silence.

I still don’t know what he saw in there.

I still don’t know how long he was meant to stay alive.

All I know is this:

That smell wasn’t leftovers.  
It wasn’t plumbing.

And it wasn’t the worst thing in that house.
