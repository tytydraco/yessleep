It was after midnight when the first shots cracked through the dark. The zipper popped off my sleeping bag as I tore my way out, dazed and rattled.

The night was cold, a chilly wind grated against my skin, and I was pissed.

Sure, we took it seriously. But bumping us in the small hours was more than serious. It was *rude.*

“Contact front!” a voice called out with a teenage sounding crack. Ryan, our fearless leader, was already prone in the grass, snapping off shots into the dark.

I didn't bother lacing up my boots, just shoved them on, shouldered my M4 build, and hit the deck. I met the dirt in the worst possible way, knocking the wind from my chest.

Out there, my groggy eyes latched on to shapes darting between the trees, shadows rolling up the hill. I lined up my red-dot as best I could and popped off shots, just hoping they'd give up quick, break off, and let us go back to bed.

The others tumbled into the grass beside me, gear rattling. Ryan barked orders at us - *form a line!* *call targets!* *keep your heads down!* We started sloppy, but muscle memory kicked in, and soon we were a well-oiled machine, laying down a hail of BBs, prepping for a quick flank.

We were so dialed in that none of us noticed what should’ve been obvious.

The shots coming back sounded *wrong*.

I’d seen guys mod their HPA rigs before, slap on Gucci muzzle devices that make them sound like the real thing.

But this was something else. The shots barking back at us weren’t dry, plastic slaps. They were cracks - concave, heavy, *real.*

“Who the hell are these guys?” Ryan hissed, switching mags.

“I dunno, but they’re good!” I called back.

The enemy advanced in formation, moving in a way that chilled me. Not one of those shadows ducked or flinched, even as we dumped entire mags into their lines. They held tight, disciplined ranks marching on us fast.

Beside me, Alan’s face lit up, his puffy eyes glued to his iPhone. I was about to tell him this isn’t the time to be scrolling reels, but his stubbly face was pale.

He turned the screen to me, jaw slack.

I squinted. There was a message from the group chat we had with the other team.

*"Guys, ngl we’re lost as hell, haven’t even made it to the field. Gonna punch out at first light tomorrow, see you then".*

My eyes darted back to the shadows, adrenaline forcing them to cut details from the darkness.

Grey coats, tattered sleeves, swinging beards, bayonets glinting like teeth. The front rank dropped to one knee with perfect coordination, lifted their rifles, and-

*Boom!*

Orange sparks burst from flintlock actions. Black powder smoke erupted in rippling sheets. Dirt kicked up in wet, heavy clumps as the volley of shots slammed around our position.

“Live rounds!” I screamed. “MOVE!”

We broke off. I covered Alan as he sprinted back, then he dropped to a knee and laid down suppressive fire while I leapfrogged past. A textbook peel, ruined only by the fact we were bringing BBs to a musket fight.

We gave up, running blind into the tree line behind our camp, our bodies crashing through brush and branches. Musket balls ripped past like flying hammers, shearing chunks of bark from the trees and dropping branches down on our heads. The rattling of snare drums followed us through the dark.

Eventually, the forest thinned away and we spilled into a clearing, shaken and out of breath.

I stumbled into the grass, then yelped. My boot struck a stone. Then another. Rows of them. Half-sunk boulders scattered through the tufts. There were other relics strewn between them. Rotting drums. Rusted cannon wheels.

“What the hell is this?” Ryan panted, turning in frantic circles.

Jason dropped to one knee. “I feel writing” he whispered, running a hand over the mossy face of a stone. “Gravestones.”

I picked up something leaning against a broken wheel. It was a musket, or what was left of one, just wood and metal crumbling in my hands. The bayonet snapped off where it had been jammed into the earth, reversed like a cross.

"This can't be right", I say to the group. "How did we get out here?"

"*You* brought us here, man" Ryan spat.

"Yeah..." Jason chimed in "Nav was your bag, remember?"

They were right, I did remember guiding us the day before, compass outstretched, red in the shed. But I picked this place because it was empty, free of all the hurdles our last few games ran across. No logging roads choked with trucks, no shotgun-toting farmers, and certainly no graveyards.

It was just fences, “*No Trespassing*” signs, an old chain blocking the trailhead...

*Could* I have overshot the bearing? led us straight into the last place we should ever be playing a match?

They all looked at me, knowing what I knew. We had to get out.

Then the woods darkened.

Figures appeared between the trees. Grey coats swaying, bayonets gleaming silver under the moon. They stood still, silent. Watching us.

“What are they waiting for?” Alan whispered.

“I… I don’t think they can attack us here,” I said. “We’re… in their home.”

Ryan’s breath hitched. “You don’t think..?”

Our eyes met, practically daring each other. Our hands moved at the same time, grabbing our NVGs from their pouches and strapping them on.

The cheap Temu goggles worked surprisingly well, painting the forest in a grey VHS midday. Every tree, every branch, every blade of grass lit up like Christmas.

And there they were.

Skeletons.

Gnarled, empty eye sockets watched us from under threadbare Kepis. Bleached, withered fingers clutched rifle butts, curled around the hilts of rusted sabers. Cracked jawbones gnashed in anticipation.

Jason made a sound like a dry heave.

They were still. Enough that their crooked bones almost blended with the tree limbs. Until one stepped forward.

He was taller, sharper.

Gold bars on his shoulders caught the moonlight. A cavalry badge sat crooked on his slouched hat.  A saber rattled at his side, skeletal fingers drumming the hilt in a rhythm. Then they raised, a single bleached fingertip pointing at us.

The ranks surged forward.

We ripped the goggles off and ran.

The clearing was a minefield. Gravestones rose from the grass like endless rows of broken teeth. We clambered between them, tripping over history, over a silence that should never have been broken. Somewhere behind me, I heard yelling. A cry of pain peaked by a teenage sounding crack. I didn’t stop.

We scrambled until the woods swallowed us again, rattling snare drums chasing us. The woods were thick, and as we pushed ourselves through, hidden by the tangle of branches, we almost felt safe.

The feeling lasted seconds. Shadows peeled from behind the trees.

One, two, three.

Blades glinted in the ribbons of moonlight. They lurched toward us, their footfalls silent.

I dumped an entire mag through the chest of the closest shadow, gritting my teeth. My stomach dropped as I heard the BBs clatter into the undergrowth ten feet behind it.

It kept coming. As it lurched towards me, the moonlight revealed a gnarled, yellowed skull, a withered, swinging beard. And a chipped Bowie knife, raised, looming above me.

At the very moment I knew I was dead, I tried something crazy. My shuddering fingers found the sight attached to my barrel, mashed the button.

The green laser flared on.

It hit the shadow's chest and spread, threads of green light fanning over the tattered uniform, dancing across the bones underneath.

The figure stopped. Shivered. His shadowy form infused with bright green light, then unraveled, torn into threads of white mist that faded into the moonlight.

“LAZE THEM!” I roared.

Alan’s laser snapped to life, green dot blazing. Jason followed. The forest lit up with rippling lasers, slicing between trees. The shapes kept on coming, clawing at us. But one by one they met the beams, shrieked, and then vanished.

We ran again. *Fast*. No formation, no covering, just a mindless dash, crunching through bushes and dodging branches. Trees blurred past. Ghostly limbs reached. Knives flashed. I snapped a look backwards here and there, saw the others lagging behind.

Alan limping. Jason slapping his laser as it flickered on and off. All I could do was run, lazing each shadow as they leapt out from the dark.

My beam grew dull. I wasn’t sure what would exhaust itself first, the army of spectral ambushers, or the cheap battery in my Temu laser.

I kept on pushing, twisting my body through the undergrowth, until I spilled into another clearing, cut up and tattered. A familiar gravel crunched beneath my feet. I’d made it to the carpark, our vehicles sitting there just as we left them. As I dug through my pockets for keys, I looked around, and saw I was alone.

No Ryan, no Alan, no Jason.

I turned. Listened. No crashing footsteps. No cries. No voices calling my name.

Just the wind.

Just me.

I stayed there, whispering their names. Willing them to spill from the treeline, shaken up, but alive.

I waited hopelessly until the sky lightened. Dawn bleeding in grey behind the treetops.

I turned, numb, and saw the stone monument at the lot’s entrance. We barely noticed it on the way in, just a typical sandstone block you'd see marking any site with the faintest air of history.

But now the first pale rays struck its bronze plate.

I stepped forward, read the weathered inscription:

*This monument commemorates the battle of Bishops Hill, 1863, in which the 37th Regular Militia fought against Union forces, and rest where they fell.*

Names of the dead scrolled down the plate, the writing eroded and caulked with green grime. But at the bottom, there were newer inscriptions, clearer.

Ryan \[REDACTED\]

Alan \[REDACTED\]

Jason \[REDACTED\]

They wanted it to be real, deep down we all do. But this wasn't the history we wanted to be part of.
