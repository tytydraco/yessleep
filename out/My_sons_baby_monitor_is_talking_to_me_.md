My son will be one in just a few days, so my husband and I have decided it is time to sleep train. We have got to get our flare back, and the only way we know to do that is to get our son out of our bed. So one night last week, we jumped on the opportunity as our son was extremely tired, and it was now or never. I ran into his closet to find the unopened baby monitor, we have had no reason to use it so far. It is a nice little monitor, I had gotten it at the baby shower, brand new from my dad and step mom.  I know you have probably all heard of the creepy stories of monitors that connect to wifi, and someone will connect to it and talk into it.  So for that very reason as the “well researched” mother I am, I only asked for one thing NO WIFI NEEDED MONITOR!  Of course my step mom and my dad heeded my wishes and grabbed a no wifi needed baby monitor. 

So fast forward to the day we began the sleep training, I was so excited. I knew I probably wasn’t going to be getting much sleep in these upcoming nights, but hey what mother really is sleeping anyways. Then 7 oclock hit and it was finally bedtime.  We did our nighttime routine so baby boy didn’t suspect anything different, but after bath and lotion and one last nursing session, I laid him in his crib. Surprisingly, he fell straight to sleep (thank you daycare!), and I was so happy for him and even happier for the reconnection my husband and I were going to share. 

Around 12am, I woke up naturally patting the spot next to me, but of course there was nothing there. My baby was in his crib and I should have been ecstatic, but I started to cry. I was going to miss this season of life and miss his sweet snuggles at night, but I knew this was something that needed to be done. I pulled my phone off the nightstand and started to scroll on Reddit, then I heard the weirdest thing coming from my end of the monitor. 
“Hi Mommy” 
I jumped but didn’t want to wake my husband, my baby is only 11 months, he doesn’t say much of anything other than the goo goo ga ga’s, mama, dada, and the occasional HAT (he loves hats). I rubbed my eyes, many times I had gone delusional in the middle of the night so I chalked it up to that. I did double check the monitor though, and saw my little angel peacefully sleeping. 

Around 2am, my internal alarm clock woke me again. Not even knowing what to do at this point I again grabbed my phone and hit up all my usual games and social medias, but as I was scrolling something weird happened again.
“Why are you ignoring me, Mommy?” 
This time I screamed, I know I definitely heard something as the monitor lit up green indicating someone was definitely talking. My husband groggily rolled over and barely even opened his eyes, and then drifted back off. I snatched the monitor so quickly and stared for what felt like hours, but in reality it was maybe only 5 minutes. Nothing was out of place, and yet again, my baby was happily in dreamland. Something in me told me to rush to the room and grab my little boy, but you know the age old saying “Never wake a sleeping baby”. So I didn’t, but mother’s intuition is always right, and I should have listened to it. Too late now, all I can do now is sit back and ponder all the mistakes I made that night, because somehow I slowly drifted back to sleep. 

My alarm went off at 5:45am, I work at a local daycare and I bring my son along with me. I got myself dressed, and I brought the monitor into the bathroom with me just to make sure he wasn’t awake, while I was doing the boring morning things. I brushed my teeth quickly, went to the bathroom, and then grabbed a diaper and lotion to get my boy ready for his day. But as I was getting his clothes picked out, the monitor turned green again, but nothing was said just a hushed laughing sound. I thought for sure that was my little man waking up, after all he is a bubbly boy and loves to laugh. Then the monitor turned green again and I heard something that will forever haunt me. 
“You shouldn’t have ignored me, Mommy” 
I ran to my baby’s room in a panic, I did what I should have done the first time I heard a peep out of that thing. But to my horror, my son was nowhere to be found. He just had recently started pulling up on things, so I thought maybe he had managed to escape the crib. I searched everywhere, his favorite hiding spots, his closet, my bathroom, but he was gone. I yelled louder than I think I ever have, and my husband came running, again we searched but it was as if that sweet boy had just vanished. We of course called the police, but no leads yet. So for anyone reading. Should I call a priest, is this something paranormal, or was my son abducted. I guess I wasn’t as well researched as I thought.
