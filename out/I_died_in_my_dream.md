I died in my dream last night, and now I’m starting to think it wasn’t a dream.

Around a month ago I was invited to a ski trip, me, my dad, my uncle T, my uncle J, and my cousin P. We were gonna go up to Germany and ski at some resort I can’t even pronounce nor spell. I was excited, the deal was if I keep my grades up then I would get to join them. 

My dumbass gets all Cs and Ds. So I couldn’t go.

My dad left around a week ago for the trip and I stayed home with my mom. I enjoy being able to stay up late and play video games cause my mom’s the chill one. My dad gets home a week later with no issues. The day he gets home I have the dream.

You know when you're in the whacky dream scenario and suddenly you have that moment of clarity. Where you can feel everything, see all the small little details and hear the smallest pen drop.

I remember being in the car, it was an suv, black, kinda like a minivan but not really. It had a nice white leather interior, and we were listening to music. It was some sort of German country song.

We were all vibing and rolling down the road on the side of a mountain, with a big lake at the bottom. I remember thinking how cool it was that we were so high up. 

Then suddenly a thud, and it was almost in slow motion, dream logic I guess. We started to swerve. We went off the side of the mountain through the guard rail with a big crash. 

I started watching the water get ever closer. And nobody said anything. We all stayed silent, no one screamed. we all knew it would do nothing. I remember saying this line that still haunts me. 

“You killed us”

We hit the water, the sound was deafening. And In an instant I was dead, and I remember feeling a weird sensation. I felt almost happy, like a shot of euphoria had just hit me, I wanted to feel sad but I couldn’t, I could only feel that warm sensation of pure bliss. 

My vision was just a snapshot of right before we hit the water, it was like I was in a still image and the only living thing there. I could still look around. I could see the shattered glass with the water rushing in. My uncles terrified eyes. I looked over and saw my cousin in a ball, I saw my dad. I didn’t realize it till now but he was holding my hand, he was holding it so tight.

I remember thinking, shit I’m dead… I’m fucking dead, that’s it. No second chance, no redo. I’m just dead.

And then I woke up. I cried after that. Feeling so fucking greatful to be alive. It was a real wake up call, I was kinda wasting my life. But it got weirder.

I talked to my dad and asked him if he had driven down a mountain like mine in the dream. And he had, I then asked them what car they were driving.

“a small Toyota sedan.” He said

I'm convinced if I was with them then they would’ve had to get a minivan, which would have resulted in that terrible crash. Turns out bad grades might have saved my life.
