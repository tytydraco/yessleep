Hello nosleep,

I am writing this in anticipation of my interview on a podcast called Curiouser, run by a known skeptic. This all happened to me a year ago and I’m not sure how to describe it without sounding insane. I am going to make this as detailed as possible so that if the host tries to catch any inconsistencies I will be prepared to answer.

However, I’m warning you right now. If you attempt to google Three Cities, Nevada, you won’t find it. At least, not until I've managed to prove its existence.

\*\*\*

I thought I had known happiness, until I met Penny. Now, 3 years after meeting her and a year after she said yes, I know I was never truly happy without her in my life.

People tried to warn me. I met her at the depths of her lowest point. She has an OnlyFans, which people said made her untrustworthy. She had baggage from her ex-boyfriend Anthony, which people said would make her difficult to open up. But those things never deterred me. From the moment we locked eyes in that café, I knew she would be the love of my life. All those little moments – getting our dog together, moving into our new apartment, binge watching stranger things, cooking new recipes we invariably failed – are the reasons that I wake up in the morning. Without Penny, I am nothing.

Of course, there are issues. Her job means that she is constantly in contact with other men. I am not a jealous man, but this kind of work will test the limits of any man in a relationship. I won’t lie when I say that I had to adjust to the love of my life getting naked on the internet. But at the end of the day, what matters is that she is loyal to me. She loves me, she has never lied to me, and I know she would never do anything to hurt me. We have implemented a no-secrets rule, where we tell each other anything and everything that is important.

Which is why, amidst our wedding planning, she tells me something she deems I needed to hear.

“Anthony followed my page.”

I immediately rush to her side. Her eyes are wide, her jaw clenched.

“Are you serious? How did he find you? You use a fake name! You wear a mask for fucks sake!”

“I don’t know. The man is determined.”

“Are you sure it’s him?”

She points to her new follower. There, plain as day, was Anthony.

“What are you going to do?”

The question was replied with a new notification. Anthony, minutes after following Penny, had promptly donated 5000$.

That alone would pay for the flowers and the cake.

“You can’t accept it,” I said. Penny simply shrugged. “There’s not much I can do.”

“If you accept it, it means he’ll think you owe him something.”

Penny tries to remain stoic, but I can see the tears in her eyes. I gather her into my arms. I’m a calm man and I want to be there for her, ease her worries, make her feel at peace. But if that bastard ever comes near Penny again, I WILL kill him.

“Should you call the police?”

“And explain what? That he followed my page? The minute the cops hear I’m a sex worker they’ll just dismiss everything I say.”

“Didn’t you put a restraining order on him?”

“Does that even apply to social media? Doesn’t he have to be physically close?”

Ping. Another 5k donation.

Ping. A message

“Hi Penny. Long time no see.”

Penny’s tears are getting bigger.

“Penny listen. We’ll find a solution to this. Okay? Just focus on our wedding. I swear on my life that he will never be able to touch you again.”

I gather her in my arms as her tears start running down her face. I whisper comforting words that I try to believe myself. It’s okay. Everything will be fine.

Ping.

“I was hoping we could have a chat soon.”

\*\*\*

 I never thought I would be taking the train to Vegas. But here I am.

“Not gonna lie,” I say to Marty, “I didn’t even know there WAS a train to Vegas.”

Bill smiles and pats me on the back. “See? We’ll get there. And the airline is giving us a discount too.”

“They could have given us a full refund,” says George.

“That’s what you get for booking with a shit airline,” says Marty.

“Okay both of you, stop fighting,” I say. “We’re all tired, we’ve been in this train station for like 5 hours and I think we all need some coffee.”

We all remain silent.

“I just hope we’ll make it in time for the fight,” says Marty.

I take a deep breath, unable to stop the lingering tension in my mind.

“Honestly guys, the fact that you organized this trip is already big. If we miss the fight, that sucks, but worst comes to worst we can always gamble and shit.” My voice comes out cracked and strained.

There’s another silence.

“You’re worried about Penny, aren’t you?” says George.

“How can I not be?” I snap at the poor guy, who probably wasn’t expecting this reaction. “That sick fuck has been bombarding her with requests! And here I am partying while she’s at home and I can’t watch over her?” My hands clench. I think it might be the exhaustion, but my heartbeat is audible in my head. "What if he finds her?"

“Listen Owen,” says Marty. “It’s just for 2 days. She will be fine. You have your phone, she can contact you, right?”

"And she has a restraining order right? She can call the cops," adds Bill

"She won't have to call the cops man. You 2 moved states to get away. How the hell could he know you live in LA now? Her location isn't public is it?"

I shake my head. "I guess you're right." My pulse is slowly calming down. Quite frankly, I think I’m too tired to be mad.

“She will be okay. Come on man deep breaths.” Marty walks me through deep breathing. “It’s going to be fine. She’ll be okay. It’s just 2 days. For all you know she’s drinking wine watching the great British baking show happy you’re gone for a while.”

This gives me a shaky exhaling laugh. “I guess you’re right,” I repeat.

“Train is here”

We all turn to Bill, who’s staring at the timetable screen. Boarding has started.

“Okay guys, this is it! We’re going to Vegas! Owen, you ready for your last night out as a single man?”

I take a deep breath, putting aside my worries. Penny will be fine. It’s only 2 days and I’ll be back to her in no time.

“Hell yeah. Let’s do this!”

I am greeted by loud cheers from the other guys. We grab our bags, and enthusiastically board the train, hoping to be drunk and happy in Las Vegas by 9pm tonight.

\*\*\*

I am awoken to the sound of the chug-chug of the train, and the conductor’s voice, loud and grainy.

“Attention passengers, this is your conductor speaking. We are now approaching our final destination: Three Cities, Nevada. Please make sure you have all your belongings and prepare to disembark. Thank you for traveling with Galley Express, and we hope you have a pleasant stay in Three Cities.”

I’m suddenly wide awake.

Where the fuck is Three Cities?

I look out the window. It’s mostly pitch black, but I can make out the vast desert, the cacti, the stars of the night sky, the occasional small shack. And there, in the distance, is a burst of light way down the horizon. What appears to be a city with a size rivaling Las Vegas itself. Not quite as illuminated as Las Vegas however. I can make out several tall buildings, but all of them seem to be empty, without a light in sight. The only lights seem to be from the inside of the city, peeking out through the skyscrapers, outlining the silhouettes of the buildings.

I wake up the rest of the guys in a panic.

Marty groggily opens his eyes. “Are we in Vegas?”

“We all fell asleep in the fucking train and now we’re going to a place called Three Cities.”

George slowly sits up, his hair mussed. “What?”

“Three Cities, Nevada. The conductor just made an announcement. This is the last stop on the route. We fell asleep on the train; we must have passed by Vegas.”

“Are you sure you weren’t dreaming?”

That was Bill, looking out the window in his confused state. “Look down there, that’s Vegas.”

“That can’t be right.”

“No no, that’s clearly Vegas down there,” says Marty.

"That's not Vegas guys," says George. "Look how fucking dark it is."

I swear I didn’t dream. I heard, clear as day, the conductor telling us we were stopping in Three Cities. Am I going insane?

That’s when the four of us notice a gentleman seated one car away. He’s the only one, aside from us, in the whole train. A well-dressed gentleman with sunglasses, he’s sitting ramrod straight in his chair and doesn’t seem to be moving.

“Excuse me sir!” yells George.

The man turns to face us without moving his body. I shudder. There’s something about the man that seems…off. His skin is covered in a sheen of sweat and has an unearthly blueish tint to it. His cheeks are hollowed out, the skin pulled taut over his face, his jaw, like he hasn't eaten in a month. And yet the rest of his body is quite portly, with a prominent gut.

“Yes? What is it?”

“Do you know where we’re headed?”

The man answers in a clear, resonant voice:

“We’re headed to Three Cities. The announcement said so.”

We all pause. And I notice, amidst the dim lighting of the train, that the man has no bridge and no ear grips to his sunglasses. They are simply attached to his eyes, with nothing holding them up.

George seems to notice it too. He stammers, looking away.  “Okay thanks sir. Have a good trip.”

The man nods and turns back to his original position.

My hands are trembling. The knowledge that I’m not insane is of little consolation as my heart hammers in my chest. What the hell is Three Cities? Outside, the desert slowly gets more illuminated as we rapidly approach the strange town. Which, no, it’s a city. Judging by the size, it looks to be one of the major cities in America.

“Can anyone google where the fuck we are?”

There is a pause. A deadly silence as the 3 guys look for their phones. I see Marty look for his backpack and I feel my heart drop even more as I look down at where my own luggage had been.

The pause stretches on as we process what we are seeing. The calm before the storm. The sinking feeling in our guts as it dawns on us that our situation went from bad to worse.

We were robbed.

My jacket is gone. My wallet is gone. All our luggage has been stolen.

“WHERE ARE OUR BAGS?”

Marty jumps up and I can see the panic on his face. George is paralyzed.

“I don’t have my phone with me.”

“Me neither!”

Bill runs to the man.

“Sir have you seen our luggage?”

The man simply shakes his head.

“I’m blind. I haven’t seen anything.”

Marty looks like he’s about to attack the man until George holds him back. George won’t even look at the man.

“Does anyone have a phone?” Marty almost wails.

That’s when I remember. I keep my phone and credit card in a secure pocket hanging around my neck whenever we travel.

All is not lost. I have a phone and I have money.

“I have my phone with me. I can call the cops and tell them we’re stuck in Three Cities and our bags were stolen.”

There’s a collective sigh of relief as the 3 guys pace nervously around. It’s not much, but there is hope. And hope is the only thing we can cling to.

I take out my phone.

And the world goes blurry.

I am suddenly no longer in the company of my 3 friends. I am no longer in a train speeding across the desert. I am no longer slowly approaching Three Cities. I am no longer concerned about my luggage, the strange man, or even my own sanity anymore.

The clock says 1 AM. I have no cell phone service.

The only connection I have to the outside world is 2 notifications I got 3 hours ago, back when I must have had service.

It’s from Penny.

“Owen come back. I just got a message from Anthony again.”

And another.

“He knows where we live.”
