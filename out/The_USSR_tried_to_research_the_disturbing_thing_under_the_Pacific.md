Well, I was spending my afternoon reading NoSleep stories, which to me are usually hilarious, when I stumbled upon a strange one… [The USSR found something disturbing under the Pacific.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11g8n3r/the_ussr_found_something_disturbing_under_the/) Intriguing. When I finished reading it, I decided to write a post of my own. I was surprised one of those poor bastards in the submarine was still alive. Differently from what retired Major Lukashenko said, and yes, I know it’s you, Lukashenko, there are not a “few of us” left. There’s only one person, Lukashenko himself. How I know all of this? My name is Pyotr Lebdjev, and I was the KGB Officer charged with supervising and later censoring all information related to the Northern Pacific Great Fossil, or as they called it, the Maw of God. All members of that crew except for Lukashenko killed themselves or were executed.

If the Soviet Union was still a thing, merely mentioning all of this would be enough for a decade in Siberia, but now things have changed. First, I’m retired. Second, I don’t even live in Russia anymore. The whole country has become a massive mafia state and I left while I still could. Third, the Russian state already wants me dead anyway because they didn’t exactly allow me to leave, so I don’t think it matters. 

Let’s start from the beginning. The descent into the “Maw of God” happened, and they barely escaped alive. This can be read in Lukashenko’s post. After the expedition was when I took charge. The high command was very perturbed by the reports, but that was not when they decided to stop tests. In total, four expeditions were made into the Northern Pacific Great Fossil. The first, which Lukashenko already wrote about, and then three others headed by the Alternative Sciences Secretariat, an obscure branch of the KGB responsible for investigating possible paranormal phenomena.

The second and third expeditions were more successful than the first one. We were able to estimate the age of the creature at being approximately two billion years old. Tests inside the Maw itself confirmed two interesting facts: Once any sufficiently large object entered it, the teeth would gradually close in, blocking the exits, and the water would slowly be replaced by fluoroantimonic acid, but the tests proved that this period of replacement, which in the first expedition took nearly two months, was reduced to one month during the third expedition. Subsequent geothermal analysis concluded there was an exceptionally large living creature connected to the Maw, thirty miles below the sea level, deep into the trench. This creature was somehow connected to the teeth, even if they were not alive anymore by themselves. The second expedition believed there were underground tendrils connected to the teeth, but no evidence was presented. 

However, it’s debatable if the teeth were not really alive. This is because of a simple reason. The first submarine was able to exit blowing one of the teeth using a torpedo. The second expedition had to use four torpedoes. The third used around twenty. But the fourth submarine was never able to get out. Do you understand what I’m getting at? Not only the fossilized teeth were getting stronger somehow, the destroyed teeth themselves were completely replaced by the time a new expedition went in. 

The Politburo was fascinated by these teeth. If we were able to find a way to use them, to research them, we would have the strongest tanks in the world. Fortresses that would be indestructible. Missile-proof cities. And our trains would never need maintenance, because their structure would regrow.

That’s why, in the October of 1983, six months after the first expedition, Project Maw was started. To guarantee secrecy, all information related to the project was sent via helicopter in letters to a KGB officer in Vladivostok who would make weekly summaries and send them to Moscow. I was this officer.

Project Maw was an ambitious project. The oil platform would be transformed in the gateway to a massive underwater station, where the ground would be drilled and the teeth and its components studied, and if possible, even extracted.There wold be nearly a thousand workers and fifty of the best scientists in the country. In hindsight, this was a very dumb idea. The cost was exorbitant, and the scientists were pressured to provide results as fast as they could, causing many accidents and risking rushed and unsafe measures. A gamble by the Politburo that the profit would be so great that it would compensate the gargantuan losses. Well, in the end, this whole operation ended up being a small factor in the collapse of the Soviet Union because of the massive losses. Some even called it Eastern Chernobyl. 

At first, the entire thing was pretty boring. Every two days, Director Puschinkin would send me a new letter. "Comrade Lebdjev, a new underwater tunnel section was finished yesterday!", "Comrade Lebdjev, we have extracted new samples from the 15th teeth!", "Comrade Lebdjev, drilling operations have started in sector whatever!". Yes, everything was terribly, terrifyingly boring during the first months. The only bad thing was that the workers and scientists were reporting nightmares, but that side effect was already known, and we believed it was derived from the isolation. If only it stayed the only bad thing.  

It was in the 19th day of February, 1984, when things changed. The helicopter pilot who every two days would go there with supplies and bring out the letters told me when he last went there, the entire facility was seemingly abandoned.

The next day, I personally went with a military helicopter to verify what was happening. I hoped that they were all at the underwater tunnels when the pilot came, but in my mind I knew something was very wrong. Upon arriving, I confirmed what the pilot said. The entirety of the former oil platform was empty, like if everyone had suddenly been evacuated. 

When we used the elevator to go to the underwater outpost, there was a violent scene expecting us. In the main corridor, there were hundreds of bodies, some of them in advanced decomposition. Like they had been dead for weeks. Walking among the bodies, there were naked people, covered in corals, algae and blood. Director Puschinkin was in the middle of this insanity, using a drill to perforate the eyes of a random worker, who was being held by other two of the algae-covered men. I didn't waste time trying to understand what happened. I immediately ordered my men to shoot everyone that moved. We then ran back to the elevator, and as soon as we exited it in the former oil rig, I personally shot the cables. The next thing, I entered the director's office, and took his computer. After that, we left as quickly as possible, and we used the helicopter guns to bombard the former oil rig until it collapsed into the ocean. As it fell, we could hear, even with the explosions and the helicopter loud noises, a gargantuan growling coming from deep beneath the sea.

As soon as I arrived back in Vladivostok I turned on the director’s computer. There were videos of the security cameras. These corals and algae had been growing on the people working there for weeks. There was not a single registered medical appointment to verify what was happening to everyone. More than 90% of everyone there had these maritime life things all over their bodies. The only people who had not were those who only stayed in the former oil rig, and rarely if ever went to the underwater tunnels. 

But it wasn’t just that. For weeks they had been killing people using drills and pickaxes, and then walking over the bodies, like nothing was happening. Like they didn’t realize what was happening. No one even looked at the bodies, as if they were invisible. These killings occurred at random. One moment they were working together, then they were drilling the brain of someone, and then working again like nothing had happened.

But the worst of all were not the humans. It was the coral-like demons who roamed corridors in the underwater sections, sometimes in plain view, and no one noticed them. Every time one of them walked in one of the tunnels, a murder occurred not long after.

Immediately, I asked my supervisor for help. He arranged a flight for me to Moscow the next day, and I had to go before the Politburo. That was maybe the most tense moment of my life. I had been in shootouts, I fought in Afghanistan, I had investigated other paranormal phenomenon, I had even infiltrated the Chinese secret service before, but that was rough. And I had to tell them: “I have destroyed the access to the facility, because the thing down there was somehow corrupting the workers. The footage shows that strange fish-beings were infiltrating the outpost, and people have been dying for weeks without anyone noticing.” 

Secretary General Chernenko, who had been brought from the hospital to the meeting and was furious, told me: “You’re saying you destroyed the entrance to a research facility that cost us billions of rubles because fish-demons were killing everyone? And that no one noticed?” Luckily, I had brought the director’s computer of me, and I showed them everything. The Politburo was as appalled as I was when I first saw the footage. Chernenko then said something like: “If this leaks, the population will not trust us anymore. Even if director Puschinkin didn’t told you what was really happening, it was your duty to keep us informed, and you failed. Listen to me, agent Lebdjev, and listen very well. You will eliminate every trace, every document, everything that could say Operation Maw happened.”

I lost count of how many papers I burned, how many computers I dismantled, how many people I bribed. How many people I’ve “silenced”. And I will not lie. This was the easiest part. 

Things only got really difficult to cover up after the Petrova Incident in early 1987…
