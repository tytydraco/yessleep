I’m the kind of girl who loves a good thrift. I’m always in places like Goodwill looking for something new for my wardrobe or stopping my car at random yard sales to see what I can find.

&#x200B;

To be honest you’d probably consider me a hoarder of some sort. I’ve got vintage mixing bowls, old CRT TVs, a coffee percolator, Rolodexes, Waterford crystal sets, VHS movies…you name it and I have probably had it. Or something like it anyway.

&#x200B;

Recently I got a hold of a Sony Walkman tape player. Now I know there are much more efficient and readily available means to listen to music, but there’s just something so satisfying about rewinding a cassette and hitting that play button and listening to the tinny sounds and slight crispness of the music on a tape.

&#x200B;

Now I know I could have probably found some tapes for a pretty cheap price on eBay or something. But I’d rather come across them “in the wild” as we thrifters like to say. So recently I did find a large box of tapes at a local garage sale. There were several. Maybe a couple dozen. The lady who sold them to me was nice enough to let me take them off of her hands for $20. Less than $1 a tape. I couldn’t beat that.

&#x200B;

When I got home that night I was really excited to see what my money had fetched me in terms of music. I knew I had probably missed the mark here and there. But there was bound to be some good music in this box of tapes. I was right. Bruce Springsteen, Aerosmith, Teena Marie, Phil Collins. But I had some crap too. The narrated version of A Christmas Carol, Sounds of Nature II, On Christianity and its History…among other things.

&#x200B;

Over the course of the week, I started listening to the tapes whenever I had the time. Then I came across the first oddity included in this batch of cassettes I had purchased. Inside one of the cases I had bought, there was a plain-looking tape that clearly wasn’t supposed to be there in the first place. I pulled it out and looked over it. On one side there was a yellowed and older-looking label with the words *M. Wilson 1987* scrawled across it in black ink.

&#x200B;

*What in the hell is on this tape? It certainly isn't Boston like what it says it is supposed to be.*

&#x200B;

At first, I could hear faint music in the background. Clearly jazz. It was a song I was vaguely familiar with. Something my dad would have listened to.

&#x200B;

*Look at me, I’m as helpless as a kitten up a tree*

 *And I feel like I’m clinging to a cloud, I can’t understand*

 *I get misty, just holding your hand*

&#x200B;

I didn’t know it immediately at that moment but I later found out that the song was “Misty” sung by Johnny Mathis. It’s a fairly well-known song. But that wasn’t all that was on the tape.

&#x200B;

Halfway through the music the song stopped and there were a few minutes of static. Then it sounded like a door creaked open and someone had entered the room. Then I heard the tearful and hysteric voice of a woman.

&#x200B;

“Why am I here? What did I do?! I don’t understand! Please don’t hurt me! I’ve barely lived my life yet!”

&#x200B;

There was a bit of a pause and then I could hear movement and what sounded like the clinking and ringing sound that is only made by metal. The woman was sobbing and clearly terrified. I then heard a long and deep sigh…the song started to play again except it was mixed with sounds of terror and agony.

&#x200B;

*Look at me*

 “Ahhhhhggghhh haaaaaaaaa Noooooooo! Pleeease!"

 *feel like I’m-* 

"Noooooo! Stoppppppp!"

*I can’t unders-* 

"Eyyyyyyehhhhhhhhh! Errrrccccchhhhssssssssshagggggkkkkkk!"

*Just holding your hand*

&#x200B;

The noises from the woman became low gurgles and finally, after what sounded like the last few struggling breaths, I could no longer hear her.

&#x200B;

*Holy fuck. I just listened to someone’s murder.*

&#x200B;

I sat there for minutes and had just blanked out. I couldn’t wrap my mind around what had just happened. The song was now over and was just playing static, and when my Walkman clicked stop at the end of the tape, I nearly jumped two feet in the air.

&#x200B;

*This is too much. I can’t deal with this. What happened to that poor woman and why did someone do this to her? That  was too real. It couldn’t have been fake.*

&#x200B;

The rest of the night I did not sleep. All I could hear was that stupid fucking song. That and those screams. Those terrible and agonizing screams. It was so visceral and real. I could feel the weight of her fear in the pit of my own stomach. I felt like I was being swallowed whole from the inside out. I tried to close my eyes and quiet my mind. But I could only hear music. “Misty” played over and over in my head all night long.

&#x200B;

About two entire weeks had gone by and I had done my damndest to try and put the experience I had out of my mind. I didn’t want to think about it. I probably should have tried to take action and involve law enforcement. But I didn’t even want to give it another thought. You have to understand that I was considering my own mental health. At this point, I just wanted to forget what had happened.

&#x200B;

Then I encountered the horror of it all again. It was like deja vu. I just wanted to listen to some music on my Walkman. The tape was supposed to be Bonnie Raitt. But it wasn’t. It was another blank tape with a different label this time. *C. Jacobs 1984.*

&#x200B;

*I can’t. I can’t play this fucking thing. How is there another one? One fucked up tape was bad enough. Now two!?*

&#x200B;

I sat there and looked at it for about five minutes. I didn’t want to listen to it. I knew damn good and well what I would hear. But I hadn’t heard it yet. My mind was racing in all directions and I could feel a cold sweat break out over my body. I just couldn’t believe what was happening. Why did I have to find these tapes?

&#x200B;

*Fuck it. I have to know.*

&#x200B;

I put the cassette into my Walkman and took a deep breath. I hit the play button hard, almost expecting it to send a shockwave of pain radiating through my arm. After listening to the initial static, I heard a new sequence of horrifying audio.

&#x200B;

“Where-where am I? Is anybody there!? I can’t see anything! Hello! Where the fuck am I?! Somebody help me! Help me, please!

&#x200B;

Then I heard the footsteps again as the door creaked open as it had on the previous tape. Slowly I could hear the drone of music slowly crescendo into my headphones.

&#x200B;

*Look at me, I’m as helpless as a kitten up a tree* 

*And I feel like I’m clinging to a cloud, I can’t understand* 

*I get misty, just holding your hand*

&#x200B;

The rest of the tape was a carbon copy of the first one I had heard. The only difference was that the screams and painfully agonizing pleas for mercy were coming from a different woman. I had listened to the final moments of someone’s life yet again.

&#x200B;

The worst part of it all was that it wasn’t the last time I would have this experience. In the months after listening to those first tapes, I had found more intermixed into the box of horror I had apparently become the owner of.

&#x200B;

*J. Long 1989*

*K. Daniels 1992*

*M. Hathaway 1983*

*S. King 1990*

&#x200B;

I listened to every tape. I heard every scream. I experienced every second of terror. I knew every word to “Misty”.

&#x200B;

I know that I should probably have given these tapes to the police. It was all evidence. I know that and I don’t dispute it. I know that these women deserve justice. But I didn’t want to become involved any more than I already was. I wasn’t going to explain this to some cops in an interview room, and I sure as hell didn’t want to talk about it on a witness stand.

&#x200B;

I tried desperately not to let it affect my mental health. But it did that and much more. My performance at work was becoming poor, I had isolated myself from all of my friends, I was losing weight because I was eating very little, and I hardly ever slept more than 2-3 hours a night.

&#x200B;

I was slowly losing my mind.

&#x200B;

My mother noticed my decline more than anyone else. So she was the one who finally convinced me to go into therapy to try and get some help.

&#x200B;

I took a personal day off from work and scheduled an afternoon appointment on a Wednesday.

&#x200B;

I knew I desperately needed help to get better. I didn’t want to continue to feel the way I was feeling. So having someone to talk to would be a welcome change.

&#x200B;

That Wednesday came and I got to the counseling center in the early afternoon and waited about 15 minutes. Down the hallway of the building, a door opened and a younger woman exited out of it followed by who I assumed was going to be my therapist. A middle-aged man, wearing khakis and a button-down plaid shirt. His salt and pepper hair was combed over to the side and he smiled at me as he approached the waiting area.

&#x200B;

“You must be Sabrina. I apologize for the delay. Come on back, please.”

&#x200B;

I followed him back through the hallway and into the room he had just left moments before. The walls were painted in a teal color, a large shelf full of books was next to the door, and there were several comfortable chairs placed throughout the room. I took a seat in a leather armchair. I was nervous. So as I usually do, I tried to make light conversation.

&#x200B;

“I don’t do this much. I’m not very good at talking about myself. But I’m sure you’ve heard that before, haven’t you.”

&#x200B;

The man who had just become my new therapist looked at me over a pair of reading glasses he had slid down the bridge of his nose and gave a sort of half-smile.

&#x200B;

“When you’ve been a therapist for as long as I have, you’ve heard a lot of things. But sure, I have certainly heard that before. It’s a pretty normal sentiment. Most people, including myself, don’t like exploring their own personal feelings or issues. Especially not with other people.”

&#x200B;

I smiled and sunk into my chair a little bit.

&#x200B;

“Yeah, I guess you’re right.”

&#x200B;

There was a short pause before we talked further.

&#x200B;

“Before we get started I’d like to start out with an exercise. I find that slow breathing and listening to some nature sounds helps to focus the mind and calm any nervousness or anxiety. How does that sound?”

&#x200B;

I nodded my head in agreement and began to breathe in slowly.

&#x200B;

And then I heard the sound slowly emanating into the room.

&#x200B;

\-

&#x200B;

*Look at me, I’m as helpless as a kitten up -*

&#x200B;

Then just as suddenly as the song had started, it stopped.

&#x200B;

I froze into place and felt my heart leap into my chest as it began to beat furiously. The room felt as if it were slowly starting to shrink in on all sides towards where I was sitting.

&#x200B;

I could feel the color draining from my face.

&#x200B;

“I am so sorry. I must have had my playlist queued up on my phone. Let me see if I can find the nature sounds on this stupid thing.”

&#x200B;

His voice almost sounded like a distant echo, pulsing and reverberating towards me. 

&#x200B;

“Sabrina...Sabrina? Are okay?”

&#x200B;

I slowly turned my head and looked at him. He had piercing grey eyes and a slight look of concern on his face. I didn’t know what to say or do. I could barely even move a muscle in my body. 

&#x200B;

“You know what. It’s fine. Let’s forget the nature sounds for a minute. I have a consent to treat form and some releases for you to sign.”

&#x200B;

He slid the papers across a coffee table that was seperating us and I looked down and felt an icy chill surging up my spine as I read the top half of the first form.

&#x200B;

**For Office Use Only**

Patient: *S. Higgins*

 DOB: *2/10/96* 

Intake Date: *5/10/17*

 Referral Source: *Self-made appointment*

&#x200B;

*S. Higgins*

I instantly recognized the handwriting.

&#x200B;

At that moment I jumped up from the chair and ran out the door and down the hallway. I briefly looked back and could see the perplexed look on his face as he stood at his office doorway.  I practically ripped the front office door off of the hinges as I ran to my car.

&#x200B;

I got my affairs in order that same week.

&#x200B;

I ended up quitting my job, I broke the lease on my apartment, I packed up all of my things, and I moved as far out of state as I could.

&#x200B;

As for the tapes, I put all of them in a large Ziploc bag and dropped them into the mailbox at the police station.

&#x200B;

I don’t know if anything ever came of it and I don’t care to.

&#x200B;

I don’t want to think about that time of my life.

&#x200B;

I don’t want to relive that horror.

&#x200B;

And I sure as fuck don't want to ever hear that song again.
