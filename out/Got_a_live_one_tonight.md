Jim heard the panicked squeals even through the thick metal door. “Good,” he replied. “You know I like a little fight in ‘em. How long’s this one been here, Charlie?”

“About a week. Not in the best shape but you’ll have to make do.”

“How much?”

“For my best customer?” Charlie paused to consider his offer. “Let’s say an even thousand.”

Jim retrieved an envelope from his coat pocket and removed a wad of bills. He counted out ten of them, folded over the stack, and offered it to Charlie.

“Have a good time,” Charlie said, holding out a bucket into which Jim placed his phone – no recording was the only rule.

Charlie handed Jim a key and slipped on a pair of headphones. Like clockwork, Jim came on the first Tuesday of each month. Charlie knew that’s when Jim told his wife, Marlene, and daughter, Jessica, that he and the other church elders met for planning meetings.

As a matter of fact, Charlie knew a lot of things about Jim. In the business they were in, you had to know who you were dealing with. One mistake could mean life in prison.  

An hour or so passed and the door opened. A slightly disheveled Jim exited the room. “Good one this month,” he said.

Charlie nodded and passed over the bucket.

Jim grabbed his phone and saw a missed call from Marlene. “I’ll be in touch,” he told Charlie, and went outside to his truck.

Once in the quiet of the cabin Jim phoned back his wife. “Hey babe, leaving now. Be there in twenty.”

“K, drive safe.”

Jim returned home and walked into the kitchen to find Marlene at the stove making dinner. “Hope you’re hungry tonight,” she said with a laugh. “I never know how much pasta to make.”

“Fine by me. You know leftover spaghetti’s my favorite.” He grabbed three plates from a cabinet and brought them to the table. “Jess, dinner!” he called.

Jessica descended from upstairs with eight loud thumps. “Hi, Dad. How was the church thing?”

“Meh, business as usual,” Jim replied as they all sat down at the table.

“Did you discuss a new sign?” asked Marlene. “The one out there now is barely visible from the street.”

“Yep.” Jim spooned some salad onto his plate. “Just need to appropriate the funds and find a good company to make it. We don’t want it falling and hurting anyone.”

“Not a bad idea for an insurance scam,” Jessica said. “I’d be able to buy a car in no time.”

Marlene shook her head and smiled. “Or you could be like a normal person and get a job.”

“I’m trying, Mom.”

“How’s the search going?” asked Jim.

“It’s OK,” replied Jessica. “Tried a few clothing stores at the mall. Just waiting to hear back.”

“Well, keep at it. You’ll find something soon,” Marlene said. “I know how badly you want the car.”

“Seriously. Why can’t we be rich? You just had to become a priest, huh Dad?”

“I wanted to be a rockstar,” said Jim. “But there was one tiny problem.”

“Yeah,” Jessica said. “You sound like a dying cat when you sing.”

“Bingo,” Marlene chimed in.

The three had a chuckle and the conversation drifted off. Dinner continued as normal, as did the coming days, and the weeks began fading into the uniformity of suburbia. A month passed when one night, they found themselves in the living room watching TV.  

“Oh, I’ve got good news,” said Jessica.

“You’re moving out?” Marlene smiled wryly.  

“You wish. But anyways, I have a job interview at the mall tomorrow. Can I take your truck, Dad?”

Jim shook his head. “Sorry, got the church meeting.”

“Ugh, that’s right. First Tuesday,” Jessica groaned. “Guess I’m getting the van.”

“What time do you need it?” asked Marlene.

“Four-thirty.”

Marlene nodded in confirmation.

“Well,” Jim said, standing up from the couch. “With that, I think I’ll hit the hay. I have an early morning marriage prep. Hopefully I’ll come home to an employed daughter.” He kissed the top of both girls’ heads. “Goodnight, love you.”

The next workday passed uneventfully and Jim made his monthly trek to Charlie’s. He parked down the street and fired off a text to Jessica.

*Hope the interview went well. Can’t wait to hear about it later!*

Jim exited the truck and made his way to Charlie’s door, signaling his presence with a special knock.

Charlie answered with an enthusiastic grin. “It’s your lucky day. Got a fresh one for you,” he said, ushering Jim inside. “Different from the usual ones we get – not filthy or drugged out.”

“How much?” asked Jim, reaching for the envelope of money in his coat pocket.

“Three grand.”

Jim raised an eyebrow.

“Buddy, this one’s special. Arrived about two hours ago – you get first crack.”  
Jim pursed his lips and took a deep breath. “OK, but for that price I’ve got a request.”

“What’s that?”

“Turn the lights off. I want a little more of a challenge this time.”

Charlie shrugged. “Sure, if you want.”

Jim handed over a wad of bills and Charlie extended a bucket.  Jim silenced his phone and deposited it into the container.

“Lights off,” Charlie said, flipping a switch to the left of the doorway.

Jim slipped into the room. Almost immediately the thuds and grunts of a struggle emanated from behind the door. Charlie put on his headphones and sat down to wait.

Thirty minutes went by. Then, an hour. Jim didn’t usually take this long.

Seventy-five minutes passed. Ninety. Charlie’s heartbeat began to quicken. Any deviation from the norm made him nervous.

 Right when Charlie had worked up the courage to investigate, Jim emerged from the room, tidying himself.  

“Worth every penny,” Jim said, zipping his fly. He reached into the bucket for his phone. “Keep the girls coming like that and I’ll make you a very rich man.”  
  
Charlie nodded his acknowledgment and Jim left.  

Once outside, Jim glanced at his phone to find twenty-four missed calls from Marlene. He hurried to the truck and dialed back.

The phone barely had a chance to ring before a panicked Marlene answered. “Jim, where the fuck are you? The store called looking for Jessica – she didn’t make it to her interview and I — I can’t get a hold of her either.”

Jim’s heart leapt into his throat. Jessica wouldn’t have missed the interview on purpose.

“It’ll be OK,” he replied. “I’ll be right there.” He hung up and went to slam on the gas, but a stomach wrenching thought stopped him cold. He flung open the center console, grabbed his pistol, and dashed back down the street.

Startled by the sudden banging at his door, Charlie looked out the peephole to see Jim furiously pounding. He cracked open the door and Jim muscled his way inside, holding the gun to Charlie’s head,

“Whoa, what the fuck?!” Charlie raised his arms.

“Where’d you get the one today?” asked Jim.

“You know I can’t give you details.”

Jim retightened his grip on the gun. “Answer the question or I’ll blow your fucking head off.”

“Ok, ok. She was picked up over by the mall. What the hell is—”

A shot pierced the air and Charlie slumped backward onto the ground.

Jim’s heart thundered in his chest as he stepped over the body and approached the heavy metal door. He grasped the cold handle, pausing to drop his head in prayer before easing it open and looking inside.

Curled up in the far corner was Jessica, clothes shredded and hair tangled. She recoiled at first, but upon seeing it was Jim, scrambled to embrace her father.

A horrified Jim stood frozen as his daughter hugged him with all her might. In the light he could see cuts and scrapes covering her body. He wriggled from her embrace, doubled over and retched.

“Dad?”  
  
Jim looked up at Jessica and began to weep. “Oh, fuck,” he whimpered, standing up and putting his hands on his head. “You…no…I…” He paced back and forth in distress.

“I’m sorry,” he blubbered, standing up and hugging Jessica. “So, so sorry.” He kissed the top of her head and pressed her face further into his body, shielding her from seeing him raise the gun. 

“It’s gonna be OK,” he said, voice trembling. “I love you, Jess.”

He closed his eyes and pulled the trigger, cringing at the sound of the shot.

Jessica went limp in his arms. Tears streamed down his cheeks as he tenderly lowered her to the ground, eyes still clamped shut to avoid the horror.

His mind raced as he staggered back to his truck. He considered running, but Marlene would be shattered when the truth came to light. Surely she would die of a broken heart. He owed her more than that.

If only he could take back what he had done. Paralyzed by grief, Jim did the only thing he knew how; he prayed. Through the tears he clasped his hands together and looked skyward, asking the Lord to guide him once more. More than anything he wanted his family to be together again. He realized they would never share another meal or go camping at their favorite spot by the lake. No birthday or anniversary could ever be the same – at least in this life.

And then… an answer popped into his head.

He sped home to Marlene and found his wife at the table, face down, sobbing in her arms. She raised her head and their tear-stained eyes met for a split second before Marlene glanced down to his crimson stained clothes.

“Jim, is that–”  
  
Without a word he whipped the gun from behind his back and discharged a single slug into her forehead. Marlene toppled off the chair and onto the floor, dead from the shot.

Jim rushed to her side and laid down on his back next to her, taking her lifeless hand in his. “Lord Jesus,” he said. “Forgive me for my sins. By dying you unlocked the gates of life for those who believe in you: do not let me be parted from you, but by your glorious power let me and my family reunite in the heavenly Kingdom of God where you live and reign for all eternity. Amen.”

And with that final prayer, Jim inserted the gun into his mouth and squeezed the trigger.
