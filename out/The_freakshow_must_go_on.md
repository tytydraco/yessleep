————

The days blurred after that night. I slept in pieces, never long enough to dream. My arm had gone pale as wax, the veins underneath no longer blue but a faint red-black, winding in shapes that looked almost deliberate.

Sometimes when I held it to the light, I could swear the lines moved—curling inward, spiraling toward my wrist in slow, steady motion. It didn’t ache anymore. It just pulsed.

I told myself I was imagining it. That shock, stress, and lack of sleep were making me see things. But I couldn’t ignore the feeling that something beneath my skin was learning how to move.

When I brushed my fingertips along the veins, they twitched like tendons, and I thought I heard music faintly beneath the sound of my pulse. The same warped tune from the hill.

I started avoiding mirrors. Every reflection seemed slightly off—the angle of my shoulders, the curve of my mouth. It was subtle, like watching a marionette move just a fraction too late.

By the fourth night, the humming came back. Low and steady, rising from the floorboards like a heartbeat. I followed it to the basement again, though part of me already knew I shouldn’t.

The air down there was heavy, damp with the smell of earth and rot. The spiral mark in the concrete still glowed, faint and red, as though something below was breathing.

When I crouched beside it, the humming changed pitch. It began to form shapes—notes, chords, the slow, dragging melody of a calliope. My vision swam, and for a moment I wasn’t in my basement anymore.

I was standing beneath a black-and-red striped tent. The air rippled with heat, and the walls seemed to sway like they were alive. Beneath my feet, the dirt was warm.

Rows of wooden seats stretched into darkness. Every one was occupied by something motionless—figures too still, too pale, their faces half-hidden beneath masks that looked carved from bone.

In the center stood a man. Or what was left of one. He wore a tailcoat that shimmered faintly when he moved, though the color seemed to bleed in and out of the fabric like smoke.

His face was hidden behind a cracked porcelain mask shaped like a grin, and his hat—tall and tilted—cast a shadow that swallowed everything beneath it. The air trembled when he spoke.

“Welcome back,” he said, voice distorted, layered over itself like a chorus. Each word rippled through the tent, and I felt it in my teeth. “The show’s been waiting for you.”

I tried to speak, but the sound caught in my throat. The Ringmaster tilted his head, the motion smooth and boneless, then took a single step closer. The floor quivered.

“You’ve seen my performers,” he whispered. “Touched their work. It’s inside you now.” His hand—gloved, long-fingered—lifted toward me, and I realized the glove wasn’t fabric. It was skin, sewn tight around his wrist.

I stumbled backward, shaking my head, but the air had thickened like syrup. Behind him, the calliope began to play louder. The masked audience swayed in time, silent, mechanical.

The Ringmaster turned slightly, gesturing toward the crowd with a slow sweep of his arm. The figures raised their heads in unison, masks cracking as mouths opened beneath them.

“Once, they were like you,” he said. “Curious. Faithful to the fire.” His voice seemed to echo inside my skull now, filling it with the sound of bending metal and distant screams.

The tent’s walls pulsed. Each beat sent a shiver through the dirt, and I realized the ground was breathing with us. The Ringmaster’s mask began to fracture, thin lines spreading outward like spiderwebs.

Beneath the porcelain, I saw movement—something wet and gray shifting beneath. The smile widened, stretching past the edge of what should have been skin.

“You came looking for the truth,” he murmured. “And here it is.” His voice dropped to a hiss. “The carnival doesn’t die. It transforms.”

When he reached out, the mark on my wrist flared. The spiral burned through the bandage, glowing red-hot, and the music swelled into something unbearable. The masked crowd began to chant, soft and rhythmic, each voice slightly delayed from the next.

I fell to my knees. The ground beneath me turned soft, damp, like flesh. The Ringmaster crouched down so close I could smell the rot beneath his breath. “You carry our blood,” he said. “You carry her memory.”

Before I could ask what he meant, he pressed his palm to my arm. His hand sank through the skin like it wasn’t there at all. Pain exploded through my body, and I saw flashes—fire, laughter, a woman screaming through smoke.

The Ringmaster’s mask split in half, revealing the hollow beneath. There was no face. Just a mouth, smiling too wide, filled with hundreds of small, glassy eyes.

When he spoke again, it wasn’t words but music—notes that crawled across my mind, rewriting something inside me. I felt my bones tighten, my skin stretch, the infection pulsing faster to the rhythm of his voice.

Then everything went dark.

I woke on the basement floor, gasping, clawing out of the nightmare, covered in dirt and ash. The spiral on the concrete was gone. In its place was a handprint—too large to be mine—pressed deep into the stone.

My arm was different now. The skin smooth as porcelain, the veins gone entirely. When I moved my fingers, they creaked faintly, like wood being flexed.

That night, I heard the calliope again. This time it wasn’t outside. It was in my head.

And somewhere beneath the music, a voice whispered, slow and certain—

“The show must go on.”

The next evening, I told myself I was only going back to prove it wasn’t real. Mason didn’t answer his phone, and by morning his car was gone from the driveway. I told myself he’d just left early, that he had work, but his tools were still in the passenger seat.

The hill looked different this time. The grass had been flattened, the earth smoothed as though a thousand footsteps had trampled it in perfect circles. I could see the carnival from the road before I even reached the gate—the tents upright, their colors richer than before, like new fabric sewn over something old and bruised.

As I walked closer, I could hear faint music playing again. Not from speakers or instruments, but from the air itself—soft, hollow, and human. The calliope tune swayed in uneven rhythm, as if it were being hummed by something trying to remember the melody.

Every light was on. Strings of bulbs glowed along the path, stretching into the distance, their glass trembling faintly as though something behind them was breathing. The Ferris wheel turned without sound. There was no wind, yet the banners rippled like they were underwater.

The smell of burnt sugar and ash returned, thicker now, almost sweet enough to choke on. My arm had gone completely pale, the skin smooth as porcelain from wrist to shoulder. When I touched it, it felt hollow beneath, like the shell of something that had already crawled out.

The main tent stood at the far end of the grounds, the same one from my dreams. Its red stripes had deepened to a color like drying blood, and the seams glistened faintly in the light. The air around it pulsed with a low hum, so deep it made my teeth ache.

A wooden sign leaned in the dirt out front, the paint faded but still legible under a thin coat of dust. It read:

“Merlin’s Collection of the Unexplained and the Unmade.”

The letters shimmered faintly as I read them, like they’d been freshly painted just for me. Beneath the title, a smaller inscription curved in gold script: “All who enter are part of the show.”

I don’t know why I’m writing this now. Maybe I think someone will find it. Maybe I just want to leave something behind before I go in. The tent is moving slightly, as though something inside is shifting from side to side, waiting for me to take the next step.

The air smells like ash and sugar again, and the music is louder now—clear enough that I can hear the words beneath the tune, whispering through the canvas. I think it’s calling my name.

If I don’t come back, don’t try to find me. The show’s already begun.
