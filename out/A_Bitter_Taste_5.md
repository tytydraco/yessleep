The monster looms over me, smiling. Square, human-like teeth line its slobbering jaws. 

“Forgotten again, Alan?” it says, reaching out its clawed hand, taking a step forward. A horrible growling yelp bursts from its jaws, its smile widening.

Instincts take over, and I’m sprinting for my life, pushing through hedges and bolting down turns.  The monster chases me in eerie silence—except for that same growling yelp echoing behind me.

That terrible whining echoes through the courtyard as I run for my life. My blood runs cold as I realize—it’s laughing.

“Alaaaaaan. Come here. I won’t hurt you,” it calls from beyond the hedges, cackling as it speaks. I pivot and drive my legs into the ground with everything I have, desperate to get away.

I come to a clearing in the hedges—a white gazebo stands at its center, surrounded by bushes with long yellow flowers. I’m about to sprint past when something catches my eye.

An envelope is wedged between two of the laths. I snatch it—but a moment later, the monster vaults silently over the hedge, careening toward me.

I roll aside and dive into the gazebo as the beast crashes through the lattice, splinters flying. I lie prone on my back as it rises, unfazed by the impact.

“You have no idea how much I enjoy this,” It growls, its voice warbled and inhuman. “You denied me the kill—but your fear is a worthy consolation.” 

It steps closer, black fur bristling, its blue eyes piercing my soul. Human eyes, full of hate and satisfaction. I scramble back—and hurl the vial at it in desperation.

It explodes into fire on the creature’s chest, flames racing up its body. The beast hits the ground, thrashing and writhing to smother the flames.

I seize the chance and run, the beast roaring and cursing behind me.

“You damn wretch! You deserve the worst of us all!” it cries as I vanish into the maze.

I run. And run. The monster’s pained cries fade behind me as I navigate the maze, hugging the right wall, hoping for the best.

My heart soars—after one last turn, I’m greeted by a distant horizon and rolling green hills. I stop to admire the view—until garbled, warped words remind me I’m not alone.

“Beautiful, isn’t it?” the beast says from behind me, close enough that I feel its breath. I turn—and come face to face with the creature. Its long black mane is gone, burned away. Its grotesque smile stretches from ear to ear.

I scream—but before I can run, its arms wrap around me. I feel the fire’s leftover heat, and the stink of burning hair chokes my nose.

It squeezes tighter, crushing my chest—I can’t draw breath. I hold what breath I have, but it escapes me. The monster’s grip tightens, squeezing the air from my lungs bit by bit.

“Are you scared? Feel like you’re going to die?” it whispers, its voice wrong—warped, hateful. It’s the last thing I hear before everything goes black.

I dream—visions of what could’ve been. An older me, and Marie too, living in the castle. Sharing dinners with my family.

They’ve aged too. My dad’s once-black hair turned silver. My mother, her face lined with age, still wears her platinum blonde hair. Claire—now the spitting image of our mother when she was our age.

Even Rob is there—older, heavier, but still with that same messy brown mop he had as a kid.

I wake up in the bedroom, lying on top of the sheets—thankfully still dressed. There’s a knock. The door opens, and Marie pokes her head in, hesitant.

“Dear? Are you alright?” she asks, stepping in. “I’m sorry—I didn’t mean to yell, I just—“

“What the hell was that?” I ask, all other worries falling to the wayside. She gives me that same false-curious look she wore when I asked about the screaming.

“What are you-“ 

“Marie, stop lying. Tell me what that was.”

Her false curiosity vanishes. She pales, eyes fixed on the floor. Silence swells between us.

“It’s your pet,” she says finally, her voice small and ashamed.

“My what? What even is it? Why the hell would it attack me?”

“It didn’t attack you, dear—it only brought you back. That’s what you trained it for. What you... made it for.”

“Made it? You said I was a chemist!”

“You were, honey. At least, that’s what Alan called it. He said you were a ‘doctor of medicine, first and foremost’... but you dabbled in many fields.”

“Then why bring me back? Why would I make it do that?”

“Because of your amnesia, dear. You knew you were prone to forgetting… so you made something to keep you from leaving. He’s our guard. He keeps us safe. But he only listens to Alan.”

“I’M Alan!”

“Yes, but… you’re not the you who made him. He only listens to the old Alan. The real one. You’d need to become him again.”

“Why was I so desperate to trap myself here? Why go that far? That thing—it hates me. I must’ve been a monster.”

Her face tightens—like she’s about to yell—but she exhales instead. “Because you need to stay here to make our medicine, honey. It’s the most important thing in our lives.”

“That medicine? The one I threw at that thing? The one that exploded when it hit?” Marie gasps, horrified.

“You threw it!? How could you do that!?” she shouts. ‘It’s volatile, yes—but we need it! Every drop counts. Especially now, when you can’t make more! And you need to take some. Now—before it’s too late!”

“I’m not taking anything!” I shout, rising from the bed. But my legs give out beneath me, and a thunderclap of pain explodes in my skull. I collapse to my hands and knees. Through blurred vision, I see blood dripping onto the floor.

Marie screams and bolts from the room. Moments later, she’s back—uncorking a vial and forcing the liquid into my mouth. I’m in too much pain to fight it.

A sweet—yet sour—flavor overwhelms my sense of taste. In a final act of desperation—and trust—I swallow.
