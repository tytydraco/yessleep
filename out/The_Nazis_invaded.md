5:50 AM. The time I woke up. I left the radio on overnight by accident, and I awoke to a sound.

 “Hello, hello! This is Warsaw and all Polish radio stations. This morning at 5:40 AM, German troops crossed the Polish border, breaking the non-aggression pact. A number of cities were bombed. You will hear a special announcement in a moment. So war!… As of today, all matters and issues go to the background. We put all our public and private lines on special tracks. We entered the war period! All the effort of the nation must go in one direction. We are all soldiers! We have to think about only one thing… Fight until victory!”

“No…” I muttered. I rushed to look out of a window and saw smoke in the air. Warsaw was in flames… Bodies burning, guns blazing… I could see the dead. The blood and the organs. It was gory… I ran to the basement, but heard screeching. My ears bled at the screech. I grabbed my rifle and checked inside the basement. Only thing there was a monster. A four armed monster. The monster had sharp talons and claws. It had no eyes, but a mouth that almost surrounded all the bottom half of it’s face. It had 2 legs as well, but these legs had something sharp jutting out of them. It had exposed organs, and crawled. Bodies, piled up in stacks. Each one was gutted in the same way. A pentagram. I shot the thing and then ran out as soon as I could. I got outside, but was repulsed by the stench. It smelled of burning flesh and organs. 

I immediately set my sights on something. Mama and Papa. I ran to their house a few blocks down. I didn’t find anything though. Except for rubble. I knew they were gone, permanently. The two people who loved me. The two people who cared for me. I felt like dying. I felt like surrendering to the Germans myself. I broke down in tears, and cried until something lept at me. The demon I shot before leapt up and tried to attack me. A Polish soldier shot it though, and it got off, giving me enough time to run. I ran until I saw it. The dead. The dead children. The dead adults. It was gruesome. They all had the same marks. A pentagram. I could see the neighbors' lifeless corpses. The children of those neighbors. Even babies were in there! It made me realize. What is there to live for? We will all die either way from the German invasion, or the alien. I took a pistol I had and pointed it at myself. I was about to shoot until the alien found me. It clawed my back open and let the guys spill out. I spent my last words saying, “I’ll see you in Heaven, Mama and Papa..” It wasn’t the Germans who killed me, but the demon who did. Niech żyje Polska!
