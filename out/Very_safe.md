Day 1:

Woke up alone, in a lushy forest, found what seemed to be an abandoned village, or rather a dead one I should say, remember.. The only remaining hint of a pre-existing life was movin- no, no they weren't, they were just rotten corpses, trapped in one of the old houses, poor things, were they moving? It's hard to recall, I wasn't at my mental peak at the time to say the least. I had just woken up from a God knows how long slumber, how did I even get here..?

Thankfully, survival-wise, the village had an abundance of valuable resources, some may consider stealing from a dead village immoral, but I'm ashamed to say morality was the least of my concerns at the time.

Day 2:

Set-up a small base outside the village, the thought never crossed my mind until I took some time to rest, but.. what even happened to this village? It seemed normal to me at first but it shouldn't, what's normal about a ruined, cobweb filled, deserted village that has... newly planted crops..? 

There's no denying it, the disappearance of the inhabitants wasn't natural, it seemed normal at the time but it can't, it can't be. I found a huge cave right next to the village, it goes way too deep to explore with my current equipment, it might be related to whatever is going on so I'll have to explore it eventually.., but for now, base preparations, I didn't want to sleep in these houses longer than I had to, the sounds..

Day 3:

Woke up facing the village, I don't like this, I've had a strange feeling ever since, as if I can.., no, no there's no one.., loneliness is making me imagine things. I still didn't want to approach the village, something unsettling yet, familiar about it..

On a more positive note, I managed to make an axe. It's lumberjack time for me, though I will admit, I feel nervous going into these woods, even during the day, at least the song is nice.

Day 5: 

I can't believe it, am I a moron!? Has being alone on this cursed land made me mad!? I've slept all these past days without walls.. in the open, exposed, defenseless.. what's gotten into me..? Something as simple as one of those wolves.. I.. I don't even want to think about it.

The worst part is, I felt safe.. I still do, I don't even feel the need to build walls, as if nothing in this forest can harm me. I don't even remember what happened yesterday.., I should start documeting all of this, it might be my only defense against insanity, if only I could hear myself thinking over this.. this.. what is that..?

Day 6:

I gathered enough wood.. God I hope it's enough, I don't want to go back out there, wait why don't I want to go out? It's beautiful out there, the forest is beautiful, the river is beautiful, the sky is beautiful, the song is beautiful, the animals are beautiful.., why.. why don't I want to go out?

Day 7:

Dear God I can hear it, it's as clear as the chirping birds, maybe I'm just insane, but.. it's there, it's there singing, ugly song, very ugly, what is it even about? I know that language, I know these words.., I can't understand it.. why can't I understand it..? I've considered peeking my head to take a look, but I decided against it, I'll consider this as a sign of me being sane still. God what if it never leaves? Is it just gonna stay here? It's been hours...

It's almost sunset, she left, oh thank God.. wait, 'she'? Why do I know it's a she, his voice sounded like a woma- what.. wait, 'his' voice?? I meant her voice, yes it was definetly a deep man's voice. I still can't remember the song, I mean, I remember it, I know it, sounded like.., I know it, but I don't remember the words, I know the words, I don't understand them, I don't..

Day 8:

Why.. what does she want from me, oh her voice is so annoying, no, I shouldn't say that, he's just a kid, all kid voices are screechy and annoying, it's not his fault, he's trying her best!

Day 9:

I LOOKED OH DEAR GOD I LOOKED

Day 10:

Can't sleep, it's standing outside, it looks, normal, human, man, woman, child, child, child, child, child, ch

I don't understand, why does it look.. like that? Normal, it shouldn't be, it's just.. maybe I just didn't get a clear look, my mind filled in the gaps, it shouldn't be normal..

It's been appearing ever since I first heard it, only during the day, is it scared of the dark? Does it want to play? All kids want to play, right? That song.. I haven't dared to look a second time.

Day 11:

WOMAN WOMAN WOMA- NO NO CHIL- NOO WOMA- THERE'S THREE THER- WHERE MAN.. MAN!? MAN!? MAN!?

Day 13:

Yesterday what.. what happened yesterday..?

Day 14:

I'm alive, I'm safe, I'm sane, I'm fine. Night, I don't hear at night, I don't hear it.. him.. her..? No song at night, sleep at night, what if, what if cave, cave dark, cave safe, must go to cave, must go at night.

...

Yes, cave safe, very safe, see it.. him.. her..? See it, outside my base, my base? NO. Cave is base, cave is safe.

They stand, yes, they, they.. it.. him.. her..? Ugly song, very ugly.
