[Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1360sbm/people_went_missing_in_our_town_and_i_dont_think/) 

So, something completely unexpected happened that nobody was ready for. After another ten hour search that lasted until sundown, I was sitting in my room petting my cat Misty and on the verge of calling Ryan to see if he wanted to go back out when I got the call from Anthony. Frankie came home and rang the doorbell in the middle of the night covered head to toe in mud. The children all came back home two hours after we finished our searches.

I wanted to jog right over there and be there for my friend but knew they had to take him to the hospital, so I excitedly told my parents about the news. I’m an only child, so I don’t have any siblings to care for and look after. So my friends were an extension of my family and I would do anything for them, even if it meant risking my life. 

The other missing children had all done the same thing and their parents undoubtedly scooped them up and embraced them, immediately going inside then later bringing them to the emergency room. I wanted to go to the hospital and be there for Frankie and the other missing children. With my parents' permission, this was the first time I ever had coffee in my life and it was absolutely delicious. It was probably the only thing that made me happy in this dark time.

Now, let me take things back a bit for a second. Think about the fact that these three four and five year olds were gone from home for almost four full days with seemingly no food, no water and covered head to toe in filth. Yet, the hospital visits yielded no malnutrition and only slight dehydration, but they didn’t lose any significant amount of weight to be alarming or had any infections. Blood work was normal and their hearts were beating. 

The children were alert, knew their names, where they lived and seemed a little spacey, but were otherwise normal. The only thing the doctors determined was that they had some mucus buildup in their lungs, but it seemed like something that would pass and the whole town was baffled. It didn’t matter at the time. The families were just happy to have their babies back.

Some people concluded that the suspect felt guilty and let them go or that the kids themselves escaped, so they found each other and ran home. Police had officers do their best with interrogating the little ones, trying to get any information on whether or not someone took them or why they could have even pulled a stunt like this on their own. They all simply said the same thing: *That they didn’t remember and felt lost in the dark.* 

It was confirmed from the mud they were caked in that they came from the swamp we had just searched. The police seemed to think that the quote unquote shoe print was just a collection of mud from the kids when they came in and out of the houses, but some of us knew better.

No parents really questioned the overlooked absurdity of their sudden return. Undoubtedly just swept away from the emotion and beyond happy of the children's return from danger.

The town Mayor publicly stated on air that if the suspect had any sense left in their brain, they’d skip town and start going to church, because only God may have mercy on them now. But things never turn out quite as planned, do they? After all, it’s said that God works in mysterious ways, though, for what’s happening *here*; I think God may have been on vacation or away from his fucking desk. 

Something was said to me that made me think we were dealing with something much more bizarre than just a regular kidnapping. Anthony told me that Frankie would say he wanted to go back to play with his new friends again and that he wanted us to come along. Us, as in the friend group. What he meant about “new friends”, we didn’t really know, but after the full month of no incidents and no more missing children that we knew of, things seemed to go back to normal other than that, only everyone in the town was on edge now. 

After a day passing while on a drive home with my dad to get some hardware shopping done, Anthony texted me saying that Frankie was really sick and throwing up bile now. He said his brother wasn’t pale or anything, but was more non-verbal than before. 

Again, doctor visits just showed the mucus in his chest, no sign of any infections on their charts and no airborne sickness or infections. Doctors just prescribed medicine to help with nausea and the mucus and that shock from a kidnapping can leave children in a more reclusive and shielded mental state. After a few hours Frankie seemed to be in better spirits and when the doctor asked him if he wanted to go home, the boy simply nodded with a smile. 

So Frankie was discharged with a prescription to stay in bed until this passed. They said if nothing gets better after 24 hours they wanted him to come back and to keep him for testing and extensive treatment. I didn’t hear anything about the other two kids that went missing with Frankie, but I can only assume something happened to them as well. 

Two days would pass after this when Sara called me asking for a favor. Anthony's parents had to go to the courthouse to file for their divorce and would leave Anthony home alone with Frankie. Apparently, even after the return of their youngest, the mother couldn’t find it in her heart to forgive and forget. This made Anthony really upset, as you would expect and wanted to see Sara. I had Sara over the phone one Thursday morning.

“Hey Jake? Look, my parents aren’t taking any chances and don’t want me going over to Anthony’s even if I wear a mask. They don’t want me catching whatever Frankie has despite what the doctors say but I’m really, really worried about them.” She paused on the other end and I heard her dog Marley barking in the background.

“You want me to risk getting sick for you and see if Anthony wants my help?” I asked, half joking.

“You don’t have to put it like that! I just know you like, never get sick and love Frankie like a little brother. You don’t have to, I’m sorry, I feel bad now-”

“Kidding. I’ll give him a call right now.” I interrupted with a soothe in my voice, reassuring my friend I was only teasing. She was right, the last time I got sick was a cold and I was only six. That was ten years ago and I didn’t even care if this sickness got to me anyway, I would put a mask on and tell my body to fight whatever it is for my friends and help. We hung up and I called Anthony right after. 

The conversation went about as expected and I sweet-talked him into letting me come over to be there for him and Frankie. Before he got off the phone he said he left the back door unlocked for me and I rode my bike over and opened the gate to their backyard, placing my bike by the deck and shutting the gate. Opening their back door, I immediately heard the commotion and then screaming. 

“Frankie! Oh my god, what are you doing!?” 

Anthony's voice was filled with a tone that sent goose-pimples straight up from my back to the nape of my neck. Something was wrong and I darted inside, not even shutting the door and didn’t bother taking my backpack off. Making my way towards the screaming, I saw Anthony holding Frankie with both arms in his room. 

**“I NEED TO PLAY WITH THEM!”** Frankie shrieked at his brother.

I stopped advancing in shock as I saw the red bulging eyes of Frankie. The little boy was trying desperately to get free from his brother's grip, yelling, kicking and screaming incoherently like a wild animal. There was what looked like bile and mud all over Frankie's mouth and clothes. Some of it was on the bed and by the floor.

“Jake! Call an ambulance! He’s out of control!” Anthony cried as I stood in the hallway. I got out my phone, hands shaking and dialed 911. 

“Frankie! Ow! What the hell?!” I heard him scream and I saw that Frankie had bitten Anthony in his hand. He was free from his grip and I could see the little teeth marks leave the indents on his bruised hand with mud all over. Speckles of blood began to appear in the area. I went to bend down and grab him but the little boy rushed past me with ferocity and I dropped the phone.

“After him!” Anthony shouted. I turned around and saw Frankies blur as he got out of the house through the back door. I should have shut and locked the damn thing but I was so panicked that I forgot entirely. I saw the phone on the ground and heard a voice. 

“*911, what’s the nature of your emergency?*” I picked it up and ran outside.

“Uh, my friend's little brother, the one that went missing and came back? He just freaked the hell out and ran out of the house! We need your help, I think he’s delirious or something!” I shouted to the dispatcher. “*What is the address and what direction did you see the boy last go?*” He asked and I told him the address  while making my way to Anthony. He was already in the backyard to get his bike and I followed him to go grab mine.

What the dispatcher said was garbled then, because I was trying to focus on my breathing and not panic from this situation. Anthony was already ten paces ahead of me and rode past to open the gate. He looked to the left and right frantically then stopped.

“I see him! He’s running towards the school! Fuck, the swamp!” Anthony shouted, pointing his finger. “What… the… hell?” I heard Anthony mutter slowly and I stared at his little brother as he bolted down the road. I almost dropped the phone then because for a four year old who was just sick and bedridden, this kid was running like a banshee out of hell. Easily running as fast as we would ride on our bikes and maybe even at full speed. This was at the point in the order of things where I was starting to question what was happening around me, like if this was some kind of bad dream or delusion. This wasn’t right, it was downright disturbing me to my very core. I was watching people I cared about deteriorate right in front of me.

“Um, I’m sorry, but did you hear all of that? Little Frankie, the swamp.” I told the dispatcher and he said he heard Anthony's voice. Our town is small, but not *that* small so any units available should be pretty quick to respond. They would inform all units in the area on dispatch. I hung up to join Anthony. He didn’t wait for me and took off to try and get his brother with tears welling in his eyes. With a horrible wave of dread, I peddled like my life depended on it and followed Anthony to chase down his little brother.

“Anthony, don’t wait for me man! Keep going! I’m right behind you!” I shouted to him as I pumped my legs on the bike. 

He was far ahead of me now and desperately heading to the swamp. Frankie had a major head start on us and earlier, how I said his speed was unnatural had me drawing all sorts of strange conclusions in my head. Like he was under some aggressive mania from shock wearing off or the antibiotics, fuck, I don’t even know how to explain it, but I had no sights on him whatsoever at this point. 

Thinking about what Anthony said; his brother and the new friends at the swamp, I did not have a good feeling about this at all. Once I heard sirens in the distance I picked up the pace to try and get to the main entrance quicker. Hopefully I can provide more important details to first responders. I assumed that Anthony would run in there blindly after his brother and I was right because when I got to the entrance he or his brother were nowhere in sight. Spotting Anthony’s bike on the ground by the opening in the field, I quickly hooked a right onto the grass and sped like hell to his bike. There was a police cruiser approaching on the road next to the local swing set and play area and I decided on going to the officer to speak with them. The vehicle stopped on the road and pulled to the side as I got off my bike and ran to the officers as they got out.

“I just followed them here. They went inside already, we have to hurry up and get to them, his older brother's bike is right there!” I said, pointing to it by the entrance of the trails. One of them told me to stay calm and the other began jogging into the forest while speaking into his radio. The other officer approached me and asked me if Frankie was a danger to anyone or himself. I told him that the boy went wild and bit Anthony and he informed everyone over the radio of the situation.

He nodded and told me to stay by the patrol car and I objected. I wanted to help out, but after the officer of law told me again that they’ve got the situation handled I finally gave in and let the man do his job. I wanted to tell them about what we saw the other night, but I didn’t want to risk getting in trouble because we went in there after hours that night. I watched as the officer jogged towards the forest trail that leads into the swamp with a horrible pain in my chest. I started crying then, I couldn’t help it. Snot bubbles and water works were pouring out of me. That poor little boy, why was this happening? Who is Frankie talking about in that fucking swamp?

I shuddered at this and wiped the mess from my face, desperate to make sense of this terrifying situation. Breathing heavily and pacing back and forth, I did the only thing I could do in this situation. I called my mom. She told me she would rush over to the entrance immediately and before I knew it, Frankies family and an entire crowd of people were gathered around me and the entrance of the swamp. The father immediately started sprinting towards the entrance with two officers in front of the police tape sectioning of the fenced gate. 

“Let me in there, my boys, you can’t keep me from my boys!” He shouted hysterically and the officers had to hold him back to calm him down. I had to look away because my emotions were getting the best of me. Anthony or his brother hadn’t come out of the swamp in over an hour at this point. The parents were at the courthouse during this. The two police officers that went in came back with no results or any idea of where the two brothers were. 

My dad was at work and once he was off he came there as well and we all waited for something hopeful to happen, but after the next four hours passed with the two nowhere in sight, we all suspected the worst case scenario. Sara was sobbing on my shoulder as Ryan and his family all stared at the forest with angered expressions. There were a few people in the crowd I didn’t recognize, probably tourists or passersby that noticed all the people and rescue service vehicles.

It was getting dark now and at this point, there was nothing anyone could do. I couldn’t even begin to understand how this made their parents feel. They were just filing for divorce and now their two children have been ripped away from them. It was at this point when something broke inside of me. It was happiness. The only thing left now was anger. Needless to say, I wondered about the other two children that were found on their doorstep. We hadn’t heard anything about them in the news or if they acted out the way Frankie did. This made me wonder about the entirety of this situation. 

So first of all, Frankie was drawn to something in the swamp. We know that *something* is in there but we don’t know what it is. But that *something* obviously affected the children while they were in there and then they came back. 

Secondly, if Frankie had an urge to go back then this should cause the other children to react, right?

Then finally, Anthony is now caught up in this *something* and it’s the same situation as before. Someone goes in, and doesn’t come back out. But is Anthony going to return too?

This caused a shift in my thinking. What the fuck could it mean? There is no way some serial killer is in there, capturing people to the point of, what, causing them to WANT to come back for more after they were either released or ran away? Hell no. This is something completely different. It’s unnatural. 

I am not one for horror movies and only really liked that one Halloween movie and The Thing, but this was drawing all sorts of conclusions in my head like there was some monster in the swamp terrorizing humans, but that couldn’t be what was happening, could it? A wave of fear that I never knew existed hit me like a punch to the face. Something really weird *was* going on when Ryan, Anthony and I snuck in there. That splashing and churning in the water. Ryan firing at something huge. The facts add up, there’s no denying it.

My phone buzzed in my pocket as I was browsing on my computer for something to distract me. It was Ryan.

*i cant stop thinking about this shit man what are we gonna do?*

I thought about telling him what I thought was going on but I didn’t want to seem crazy, then again, this was one of my best friends and I have always opened up to Ryan about pretty much anything. So, I decided on easing into the idea and replied.

*Same. Kinda think something weird is going on. Like not some killer or whatever. Idk.. you should have seen Frankie.*

I sent the message and he didn’t reply at first so I sent another text.

*Something’s not right.* 

About thirty seconds go by and I get his response.

*dude i agree me and my brother think its a forest spirit or something crazy what the hell do we do for something like this? bills got go back to active duty and is leaving in 2 days so he cant help... its just gonna be me and my old man and screw the cops too they arent doing squat anyway*

The cops had to have been realizing this situation was insane because it didn’t seem like they were making much head-way in any kind of investigation. That’s what gave me the idea. If *this* kind of thing isn’t working out for regular police detectives, then we need to reach out to another kind of detective, right? I went online and started typing in private investigators and even paranormal experts for hire but couldn’t really find anyone. My plan, since I didn’t have a lot of money, was that I would pawn a few valuable things I have and maybe ask Ryan’s older brother Bill for help before he left. 

The plan, in short, went pretty rocky, but I got a phone number. Turns out, Bill actually knew an ex-cop who does his own investigations and has been known to handle things “out of the ordinary” (as Bill put it) so I asked him why he hadn’t thought of this sooner.

“It’s not that.” He said. “The guys an expert, but he’s been either missing or out of the game for months now. Haven’t heard from the guy at all since last year. I just thought maybe now wasn’t the best time.” 

When I said I wanted his number anyway, he gave me this look, like I was an idiot. He was hesitant to give me this person's contact information. Ryan then stood up from his seat. 

“Bill are you fucking serious right now? Our friends are out there and in serious danger or dead. What else are we doing? Shit, if you didn’t have to go we could use your help and kill whatever this thing is and-” 

“Enough!” Bill shouted. He sighed and went to his room, coming back with a pocket book in his hand. After turning a few pages, he stopped and then looked over at the two of us. “It’s better I don’t have it anyway. He goes by Dex and only Dex. When you guys call this number, use a pay phone in town and burn the paper.” He locked eyes with Ryan. “It’s that serious, squirt.” He then walked up to me and took another breath. 

“But, I know how this shit is affecting you kids. You’re all a bunch of badasses but be careful, please. Maybe he is still operating and laying low, and maybe hearing a high school kid explain the situation might make him consider his position. From what I’ve heard, he always gains results. Oh, and you didn’t get that number from me, it’s a personal line.” He then ripped out a page from the notebook and handed it to me. 

“Ryan will lose this, and you…” He pointed a finger to me. “You keep an eye on my brother here. You’ve always been a good kid and kept him out of trouble. Please don’t do anything *too* reckless, guys. This kinda shit is FUBAR and Dex will know what to do. Stay out of his way after you give him the details, if he even takes this one, and for the love of all things holy stay out of that swamp, dammit.” He then looked at both of us intently and walked out to his shed. 

I looked over to Ryan then we both decided on going to my house and calling Dex in my room. My parents already told me I could have company over basically whenever I wanted so I didn’t even bother asking. Once we biked our way back to my place, Sara was sitting on the steps to my front porch. Her dyed dark red hair was flailing in the wind as she tried to keep it under control. We put our bikes on the front lawn and approached her. 

“You could have just opened the door and gone in.” I told her. She looked up at me with redness in her eyes. Before I go on, there’s something I didn’t have the chance of bringing up about Sara and her parents. She never went on about it too much but her mom and dad weren’t all that great people to Sara. Despite being the daughter of the highest esteemed people in the medical field, you’d think the parents would pay a little more attention to their only daughter. They focus on work too much. Any time she asked for some kind of affirmation or even love sometimes, she would get a cold shoulder and some lunch money for the day or something to just appease her. She had everything she needed in life except for her parents' love. Because of this, she would easily sneak out and basically did whatever the hell she wanted. Even before she dated Anthony. 

“I know, I just had a hard time standing and needed to sit for a minute. Then you guys showed up.” She said quietly, obviously making an attempt at an excuse. She exhaled and put her head down. I reached my hand out for her to take it and support her up and ushered my friends inside. My mom had some dinner cooking and I asked for a few more plates before shutting the door.

“Mom! Ryan and Sara are here!” I yelled out and she told us she’d have a plate ready for them too as we made our way to my room. We all got comfortable and I spoke out first after we were settled.

“Sara, we don’t think the police can even help in this situation anymore.” I left some space around the word *situation* to solidify the severity..

“What do you mean?” She asked. We then took turns explaining our theories, why it was so strange that the kids returned and how we went into the swamp that night and Ryan shot at something huge in the water.

“We don’t think it's a human that’s taking them.” I said to her, she was sitting on the bed with me as I leaned against my back against the wall.

“Oh my God. Are you guys serious?” She said, visibly upset. “You mean it? It’s some scary swamp monster then? Give me a break, this isn’t some joke you guys. Anthony and his brother are- They are fucking gone!” She was understandably upset and I knew she wasn’t going to take this very well but I continued anyway.

“Yeah, we actually are serious Sara. Do you really think those kids came back on their own? No, something was using them. Toying with their heads like some curse. Even Bill agrees.”

“I don’t think it’s a spirit anymore Jake.” Ryan spoke immediately after I was finished. “Spirits and ghosts can’t swim in the murky water Jake. No, it’s definitely some kind of cryptid. An undocumented creature that slipped through the cracks by surviving extinctions from a time when we weren’t even a thought. I looked ‘em up online.” He pulled out his phone and started scrolling to something while Sara and I remained quiet. He then started showing us pictures of large reptiles, enormous snakes, giant alligators, the list went on. The more I thought about it, the more it seemed to make sense, but there was only one thing stopping me from fully believing this.

“Well, how do you explain the kids’ weird behavior and Frankie said something about wanting to “play” with his new friends in there? Doesn’t that sound a little too *strange* to be some large creature?”

“I wasn’t finished.” He then stared at us from the floor with an expression that I have never seen my friend display before. His visage was that of someone who had quite literally just shit their pants. “What I am about to show you two is going to sound bonkers, but I didn’t tell you the kinds of cryptids there are in the world.” He finished and again went back to looking for something on his phone. “I think we’re dealing with a supernatural entity. Sure, there’s big ass snakes in the world and shit, but I’m talking more out of the box.” He handed the phone to me. “ Did you know that natives in Florida, like back in the Seminole times, spoke of creatures that disemboweled its victims in the middle of the night, but were actually witches and warlocks that wore the skin of its victims during the day?” The website I was looking at showed a decent sized summary of the monster and the artist's description of it made the hairs on my neck stand up. 

“That’s not all.”  He said, reaching for his phone and I handed it to him. As he scrolled on I felt the bed shake a bit and looked over to Sara. She was indeed quivering and she noticed me look over at her. 

“You okay?” I offered and she looked out of the window closest to her. “What else did you find Ryan?” She asked while looking out of the window and he chuckled dryly. I turned my head back to my friend.

“Apparently, those aren’t the only things they could do. They were able to coax their victims into letting them inside or luring weak minded people to do their bidding and get tricked then turned into these things. It has to make sense. 

Now, I don’t know if this is what we're dealing with or what, but if those kids all got taken, somehow transformed, then came back to try and trick us then it would only make sense. But that would mean…” He stopped. I knew why too. We all felt it then. Anthony was gone. Frankie was gone. Those kids, all gone, and if this was what was really happening, they were now some kind of horrible shape-shifted creatures. I didn’t know how to fully react or process any of this. I shuddered as I looked out of the window and pulled the curtain when I saw a person going for a walk. I felt as if unseen eyes were glued to me from out there. I knew it was anxiety and fear, but it was almost physically in the room like an aura after this was all spoken out loud.

“Summer is almost over. Whatever this shit is, we gotta somehow stop it before school starts.” He paused to look at the both of us intently. “That will become its major food source.” He finished.

“Stop, just fucking stop right now.” Sara blurted out. “You have officially creeped me out. I am not sleeping alone or stepping foot on that trail ever again. I don’t even want to look outside or even be out there now. This is all too much, who the hell is going to even believe us if we shared this? I don’t even think I fully believe it. Anthony and his brother couldn’t be-” She stopped and looked over at me as if I had any clue as to what the hell we were dealing with. Then without any indication, she melted away at the face with tears and broke down. It was so loud my parents knocked to see if everything was okay and came in. After some convincing that we were fine, my mother went over to Sara and gave her a little hug then planted a kiss on her forehead and walked away saying that everything was going to be okay. If only they really knew. My parents made their leave and Ryan and I shared a glare for a few seconds and I nodded.

“We do have someone who we think can help stop this.” I said, pulling the P.I.’s number out of my pocket. “Sara, this is a paranormal investigator's number and I’m going to give him a call right now.” She looked up at me with grief in her eyes and shuddered. “What the hell?” She said, and I pulled my phone out to dial the number. It rang four times and I heard an audible sigh.

“*Dex speaking.*” Said the low-toned voice. I crossed my legs and leaned forward then put the phone on speaker and spoke.

“Hello Mr. Dex. Look, I’m going to just get right to the point. I got your number from a trusted source and our town has something fucking crazy going on. Can you help? I will pay you whatever price.”   

“*Don’t need a price.*” It took a moment for the man to reply. “*I saw your area code on the caller ID and debated on even answering. You’re in Florida, right?*” “Um, yeah.” I replied, transfixed that he even answered the phone and for the first try. He continued. “*I just worked a case out there. A case I think may just be connected. Listen, can we meet?*”

Even more stunned than before I decided on meeting him tonight at our spot and hung up the phone.
