 "Hey kid, wake up!"


 I wake up groggy from the loud voice and start to rub my eyes. I look around and see 6 people in front of me. I also notice that I wasn't in my bedroom. 


 "There he is awake." One of the people say out loud. He looked like a bald gruff man. The one that you knew was way into sports and would fight if his favorite team lost. 


 "Calm down Gerald you'll scare him." This was a woman's voice. I look to my left and saw that she looked very pretty. Had a purple like suit and blonde hair. 


 "He will be once he knows the situation he's in". Says Gerald as he lets out a huff. 


 I then hear the sound of a lighter being flicked open and shut. In the front of this new room sits another man on the right corner that looks like one of them teenage punks in them 80's movies. 


 "Sam stop that!" The purple lady yells at him making me jump. 


The boy then flicks his lighter shut and says,"now your the one scaring him Laura". Laura so that's what her name is. She then again looks at me me a kind worried expression. 


 "Don't worry about him, he is just troubled. Now do you know where you are?" 


 Now that I got a chance to look at my surroundings I realized that I am in some little kids room. Stars painted on a night sky background. If I was younger I probably would have liked this room. I was always into counting all the stars outside with my dad at night. 


 Then one of the other people by the wall gets up and whispers into Laura's ear. Laura then shakes her head and looks back at me. "She is going to come in again. When she does make no mention of us ok?" 


 I nod my head but still confused on the situation I'm in. I then hear the rustling of the doorknob as the door slowly creaks open. A woman who obviously hasn't taken care of herself walks in the room. She looked decent but not enough to make me feel comfortable around her. 


 I crawl to the back of the bed. She then looks around and I notice that all the people that were talking weren't there anymore. My heart started beating as she comes closer to the bed. The smell of bad perfume coming off her as her face was by mine. 


 She makes a smile that lets me see some of her bad rotting teeth. The mixture of her breath and perfume makes me want to puke on the bed. I didn't because I didn't know if that will make her angry. 


 "Why hello there Travis". The woman says to me. Which made me freak out that she knew my name. "Are you having fun in mommy's house?" That made my heart start to beat more as I already have a mom. I shake my head at her still terrified to speak. 


 She didn't seem to like it though as she got angry and started banging her fist on the wall and started screaming.


 After a couple of minutes she stopped. She then looks back at me with another rotting grin. "It's ok Travis I know you ain't seen mommy in a while and that you need to get used to me. You will though because your going to be mommy's boy forever!" 


 She then gave me a hug as I tried to pull back. "You ain't my mom." I say back to her. She then gives me this creepy smile and says," Oh I am sweety, you will know for sure once I get daddy on the phone". 


 She doesn't know dad's number. You can tell it in her voice. How does she know you though? Was she a stalker? You then look around the room again. That starry sky wallpaper with various children's toys and a desk with a lamp by the bed. 


 "Don't forget us". 


 You jump as you look to your left at Laura. She smiles and puts her hand on your shoulders. "Don't worry Travis. We are going to protect you". The flick of the lighter makes me jump again as Sam still flicks it open and shut.


 "Hey Laura what's the plan?" One of the 3 people by the right wall. Gerald is on the left with Sam on the corner. "Calm down Mark when we see an opening we will take it". Mark looks like one of those bodyguards you see protecting rich people. 


 He nods his head at her and leans back against the wall. "Who are you people?".


 They all then looked at me with solemn expressions. They were acting so serious my heart felt like it was about to stop. Then Laura coughed a couple of times and said to me," we are your guardians Travis, we protect you from bad things which is why you are here now". 


 Being only 12 at the time I essentially thought that I was going crazy. "How come she can't see you then?" 


 "That's because she is evil," Mark says. "Evil people cannot see guardians," Gerald also says. "We only live and serve to protect you Travis," Sam says while looking at me still flicking the lighter. The other two were only shadow like. "Those are enforcers. They help fight off the evil". Laura tells me. 


 "How did I get into this situation?" I asked. 


  "We don't know. All we know is that we were called here. Gathered to be the correct term." 


 Still confused I just went along with it. "So what is the plan?" 


 Laura then smiles at me. "Next time she comes in here you are going to stall her while the enforcers jump her. Can you be brave for that?" 


 I nod my head yes. Fortunately at that time the doorknob started to move. The woman then walks into the bedroom and gives me that creepy smile. 


 "Seems like I forgot daddy's phone number. Do you remember what it is?" I knew it. She didn't know dads number at all! I look around again but the only people in the room was me and the woman. 


 "You must know your own father's number Travis". I gulped some courage in and said to her, "Stop calling me Travis, you ain't my mom and I want to go home!" 


 She stepped back when I yelled and at that time the two shadowy enforcers went around her. I didn't even see them show up they were just there. They coveted her in their shadowy form and as they did the woman's eyes widened. "What are you!" She yelled as she finally saw them as she started convulsing. 


 The others then appeared as blood seemed to run down her eyes and mouth. Laura held her hand back to cover my eyes but I could still see through them. The woman suddenly screamed, "Travis help me!" That look in her eyes and the fear in her voice made me close my eyes until I heard a thump in the floor. 


 I opened my eyes again to see her limp body sprawled out on the floor. The blood still going down her face as there is now a puddle. 


 I then start to cry as now I didn't know what to do. Then for some reason they all hugged me. "It's ok now Travis, just go back to sleep and you will feel better". I then get laid back down on the bed as I hear Mark, Gerald, Sam, and Laura say "don't forget us!" As I closed my eyes into a deep sleep. 


 *********************************************** 


 It has now been a couple of days since I had that nightmare. I am now 21. I go to the creative writing courses at my college. After I had that nightmare I called my dad asking if anything traumatic happened to me as a kid. 


 He said he recalled when he was late picking me up from school a woman grabbed me while I was asleep on the bench and took me to her house. She was planning on using me for ransom money since my family was in the middle high range. 


 Once the cops traced her car through CCTV footage they busted in. They found me laying still asleep in a makeshift bedroom. That's where they also found her dead on the floor. He also said that they fount traces of opiods in her system that made it seem she overdosed. 


 After he told me that he said that I went through a couple of years of therapy and just simply forgot the whole incident. He then caringly asked me how on earth I remembered and I just simply told him I had a nightmare. 


 I am on my way to see dad now. The fact that no one else saw these "guardians" makes me think they were just in my head. 


 If that was true then why am I on here right? 


 I am on here because I am walking towards the bus stop that takes me to my parents place and I am hearing a quiet flicker of a lighter.


 I just hope nothing happens.
