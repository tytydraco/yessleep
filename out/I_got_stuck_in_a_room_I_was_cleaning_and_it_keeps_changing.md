Part One

I’m your typical 24 year old screw up, I didn’t go to college, I didn’t find the girl next door and I didn’t get a typical blue collar job. Instead I graduated high school and went about the next couple years bouncing from job to job smoking weed and playing video games. I have a couple of good friends, most online, but nevertheless we are close. I landed a gig as a cleaning “maid” contracted through a realty company and I clean houses before they are put on the market. 

Most places are pretty disgusting leaving me a multiple day venture to get the mold out of bathrooms or the kitchen and tediously going over carpets over and over to get the mystery substances out of them. This job was a little different but nothing out of the norm. It was a large house and I was given one week to have it spotless as the minute it hit the market, it would undoubtedly have showings. I showed up in the company van stacked to the brim with cleaning supplies in the back. I sat in awe at the size of the house I was supposed to have done. It was at least three stories and probably had an attic with a wrap around porch and more windows on just the front than I was willing to count. I turned around to look in the back at my cleaning supplies and knew almost immediately thought there’s no way I have enough. 

Nevertheless I put the van in park and threw my earbuds in. I played whatever playlist I was recommended as I wasn’t picky and I only listened as it helped the time go by. I sat for just a moment and stared at my hands on the leather steering wheel. Dry and cracked, maybe as rough as the bark of an old tree, they scraped the steering wheel as I pulled them off to inspect them closer. It took my eyes a second to adjust to them being so close. 

Oh man I thought, the chemicals in the cleaners are definitely starting to wear down the youth of my hands. 

I got out of the van and pulled the cart of preloaded cleaning supplies from the back of the van undoing the straps when wrip my hand caught the edge of a strap causing it to break the skin and make a small cut right on my index fingers. Damn I was definitely wearing gloves now, I didn’t want to risk getting my finger infected or feeling the burn of each cleaner when it hit my finger. I finished pulling the cart out of the van and started pushing it to the double doors of the behemoth house I was expected to have done by Friday. Pulling out the key I was given to the place I put it in the lock and pushed the door open. 

An incredible foyer layered in front of me. Tile floors and carved wood stairing that lead aimlessly to the upper levels of the home. I pulled the cart in and the door closed behind me with a loud  thud. Unusually that made me jump a little, I had been doing this for about a year now and had gotten used to the echo of an empty house or the eerie feeling of it feeling abandoned but this was a much larger house than I was used to. 

The first thing I liked to do when I showed up to a place was do a good walk around and feel the place out, decide where the best place to start is and what places I could knock off the list first. This place was immaculate. I mean that by every sense of the word it was clean and well lit, it had a homey feel to it. Nothing was too extravagant yet it was all worth awe. There were in total 6 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, an office, a kitchen on the main level along with a living space and that foyer in the walkway. The stairs would be a hassle too and always get done backwards which is a nuisance. 

It was about noon when I’d finished mapping the place and I decided i should grab a bite and then head back to at least start with the uppermost floor which had 3 of the bedrooms. I spent the entirety of my lunch thinking about how odd it was that the house was so clean. Don’t get me wrong it needed work but it was nothing like what I was used to. I’m used to family homes that are abused and left for a landlord to take care of, but this place seemed well taken care of and routinely cleaned. I remember my boss not having much information on it except that most of the other local cleaning places had given up on it. I couldn’t imagine why, I mean it was large but relatively clean. I finished my lunch and headed back in. I had checked out the bedrooms beforehand so I was pretty sure all I would need was a duster, vacuum and wall cleaning agent and rags, no windows in that bedroom as it seemed to be more of a walk in space that was turned into a bedroom. 

My cart?

 Where did I leave my cart?

 I hadn’t brought it up the stairs had I?

 I walked back out to the van to check if I had loaded it into the van before my lunch maybe I went into autopilot and threw it back there. Sure enough I hadn’t, the back of the van was empty so I marched back in and found it up against the wall near the staircase. I had just looked around in here, I was standing three feet from where it sat. 

Whatever, I thought and grabbed my cleaning supplies. Heaving my vacuum and spray bottles up to the second story I took quick stop at the landing, glancing down the hallway in either direction. Typically I leave doors open when I finish checking a room out and saw one of the doors was closed. It was the door to the office that was lined with bookcases in two of the walls, a small wall mounted light on the wall with door and a window in the wall adjacent. While most of the rooms were carpeted this had a hardwood floor that had visible usage of chairs or a desk that was moved around periodically. I wandered down the hallway and cracked the door open to see that only one of the walls had a bookcase and the other barren with a dusty outline of what would have been a pretty large painting that hung there at some point in time. Maybe I hadn’t written things down correctly, maybe a trick of the morning light at the time but, I thought there was a bookcase on that wall as well. I stepped into the room to peer out the window which gave way to a beautiful backyard. Perfectly trimmed grass and an ocean blue pool without a speck of debris in it, the concrete walkway lined with flowers of every kind. 

What a house to leave, no will, no kin, nothing? 

No matter the reason if I wanted to be done by the end of the week I had better start cleaning. I opened the door but noted the door didn’t have a swing that would have closed it, as a matter of fact I had to give the rounded door knob a good twist to get it open. I walked to the third floor and finished the smallest of the rooms only having to run downstairs to grab window cleaner for the next room and an extension cord Incase I stayed too far from an outlet I wouldn’t have to stop. I had gotten about halfway done with the final bedroom on that story when the alarm on my phone went off letting me know I was done with my shift. I unplugged my vacuum and set all of my things against the closest wall before making my way downstairs. I pushed the cart back towards the wall I had found it at as it had moved a bit as I got my vacuum off of it and left for the day being sure to lock the door on my way out. 

Thud thud thud 

I wiggled the door to be sure it was locked.
