Hi everyone again. I'm back and I'm back with some more stuff, for lack of a better term. As some of you know I'm a cattle rustler or was. I worked for a ranch for only a few weeks. I was busting broncos, working with a ferrier at one point and fixing fences and so on and so forth. Eventually they moved to a night shift, watching the herd. While working as a night watcher, I experienced some oddities. Two hundred head of cattle were wiped out alongside my horse. The big house with all the other cowpokes and upper management were also gone. All of them were murdered by some creature that I only managed to get a glimpse of.

That was all in my last post. This event happened about four days back and only now have I finally decided to reach out to you guys. I've been to tribes on their reservations, I've been talking with police and even gone to a local university to see if they understand. The cops think it nothing more than a bear or something, the university is in the same boat and not too interested in giving it a look into. The Natives I've spoken to have warned me that this creature is an omen, a bad sign for things to come. They never named it for fear of getting its attention. I thought my last chances of figuring this out were lost. I saw that many of you had experienced odd things and I thought maybe some of you would know. Still hoping one of you can help.

But this post is less about that and more about what occured today. Today I met with a retired cowpoke, one that worked at the ranch I did. From what I found out from him, he was also a cow puncher turned night watcher. He invited me out when I said I had questions. I pulled up in my pick up and found a small property (about twenty acres if I had to guess). It was rough land not good for farming but ranching though no cattle or horses or anything could be found out there grazing. 

All I found instead was a shack made from random pieces of wood and sheet metal. There was a porch with a few rocking chairs, a small table with a book and an ashtray filled with cigarette butts. My eyes however were instead drawn to the symbols that littered the wood. I saw crosses and dream catchers, I saw Greek lettering and words written out in Latin. I saw carvings in the wood, pagan symbols that unfortunately I have no idea where they came from, my guess is maybe Viking runes but that feels wrong.

I stepped on the porch and went to knock on the door but it opened on its own. Before me was an old man, hunched over from years of gravity pulling him back to the Earth, to a grave he belonged in. His hands were incredibly calloused, skin was littered in scars. His patchy white hair stuck out in all directions as though he had been struck by lightning. His teeth were mostly gone, his knowing beady eyes were stuck behind glasses, a mustache was over his upper lip. His clothes were a long sleeve green work shirt and overalls both stained with gunpowder, oil and sweat. His name was George (not his real name since he asked for privacy) and George had a story to tell.

George worked for the ranch I worked at about ten years prior. He said he was like me, said he did all kinds of work in all manner of elements. He said he liked it, enjoyed it till he was pushed to be the next night watcher. He said day one there were already oddities coming out. Said he saw caterpillars tying themselves into knots. Said he saw coyotes running themselves in circles till they died of disease or starvation or dehydration. Said he saw birds following him, trailing him as if keeping tabs on his location.

From there he spoke on how it would be dead silent. No chirps, nothing. Said he heard a charge, a bolt of something massive and like me he would jump up and search but find nothing. He too lost his horse like I had. Same bloodied saddle without a single cut mark. Unlike me however, his events sprawled over a week while mine happened in a day. George said that his beast (He too wouldn't name it) would pick with him. It would slash his truck's tires. It would throw his supplies tens of feet away. It would take a single cow, kill it and leave it in front of him so he'd wake to the smell of blood. Finally it tore through the herd and charged at him.

He said he caught a glimpse of it with the flash of his rifle. The muzzle flash paints the same picture you would expect from a camera. George described the beast exactly as I had. Our stories diverged from there however. For I found the big house filled with bodies, he found it empty, claiming that the monster took a few people away. He said he ran but was tackled by the monster. He wasn't killed however, instead it made him dream. That's how George described it. Said it took him far far away. When he woke from this dream he was in a cavern far off from the big house. He said it had fed off of him somehow. Something about taking a piece of his fear, his soul, his humanity. Said it marked him.

Sure enough it did. George rolled up his left sleeve, showing me his skin, showing the marks that the monster had made to him. It's hard to describe how it looked but the sight stained my mind, I can still see it, smell it. The best way to put it is like a hickey, a hickey that turned to a rash that permanently scarred. From the base of his neck to his shoulder, down his arm and stopping just above the wrist were dozens of small crucifixes. Each spot raised as if irritated, each a bright beaming red color, the area around it extremely pale, giving George's tan complexion an odd polka dot pattern. He claimed the monster did this. Said that this is how it feeds.

I didn't know what to think of it. I didn't really know what to say other than Goodbye. I didn't want to talk about this thing anymore. I didn't want to think of it. I drove home and currently I'm sitting on my couch, writing this out for you guys. Tomorrow I meet with the police, take them out to the property of the ranch, show them everything and identify the bodies. I'll keep everyone posted.

I hear something. Outside my window, now my door. Something's walking around out there.
