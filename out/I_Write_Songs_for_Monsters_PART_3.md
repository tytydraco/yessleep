Concerns? Yeah, I had a few.  


I woke up feeling like death hit me with a stick. My eyes were itchy, my throat was raspy, and my appetite had disappeared. Mostly, I was stone cold paranoid. And for good reason: my life was in danger. Being murdered by monsters is bad enough, but having my head served on a platter? No thanks.  


I didn’t know what to do. Call in sick? In normal circumstances, sure. But these weren’t normal circumstances. I spent all day going over my options, which were few. In truth, I was lucky to be alive.  


By six o’clock, I was delirious. No way I’m going in today, I told myself. No freakin’ way. Tears filled my eyes, and I had the sweats. The worst part was that I had no one to turn to.  


My ex-wife was shacked up with Nick – the Best Man at our wedding. Both of my parents were gone, and I’d lost my work friends, seeing how I was recently let go. I had some musician friends, but did I really want to tell them what was going on? No. They’d think I’d gone insane.  


By seven o’clock – when I was supposed to start my set – I was curled up in bed, petrified. Don’t judge, you do the same thing if you’d witnessed what I saw. Monsters on TV are one thing: they always look fake. But in real life, they’re hideous creatures, prone to violence and murder. Their behaviour is anything but reliable. 


My phone beeped; my heart stopped.  


It was Them. Somehow, I knew this. I checked my phone: UNKNOWN NUMBER. It went to voicemail. 


“Hank!” (The redhead.) “Get your cute lil butt down here. Tony is furious. Love ya lots! Bye.” 


Her voice creeped me out; she sounded more machine than human. Of course, she wasn’t human, she was a witch. Still, I was stubborn, and wasn’t convinced. Yeah, the money was a lifesaver, but money is of no use to me when I’m dead. Right? 


Moments later, my phone beeped again. This time I answered. 


“Hank!” (Tony, the boss.) “Where the hell are ya? You should be here!”  


“I…” Words failed me.  


“Look out your window,” he snapped.  


I did. Idling next to my beat-to-death Honda Civic, was a black SUV; its windows were tinted, so I couldn’t see who was driving. 


“You’ve got one minute,” he shouted. “Don’t waste it!” 


Like a man possessed, I changed into a nice pair of pants, put on a clean shirt, and hopped inside the black SUV. What choice did I have?   


Tony was in the passenger seat looking as mean as an alligator; as usual, he was dressed in fine Italian threads, and his head was gleaming like a finely polished turd. Next to him was a well-muscled demon wearing Terminator-style sunglasses. It had spiky horns on its head and broad shoulders, like a linebacker.  


Nobody spoke.  


We arrived within minutes. As we descended the slippery stairs (no idea why they were slippery, and I wasn’t about to ask), Tony grabbed me by the collar. 


“Play the songs on the list,” he said, coldly. “Or else.” For the second time, he handed me a list of songs I’d never heard of.   


“B-b-but,” I stuttered, “I don’t…” 


Tony lifted me off my feet. “Do as I say,” he spat, “or you ain’t leaving. Not with your head, anyway.” 


He shoved me inside the bar.  


Everyone turned.  


I gulped. The room was bustling; the monsters seemed agitated. And drunk. Not a good combo. 


“Well, well,” a two-headed troll scoffed, with chicken wings splattered across his filthy overalls. “Look what the boss dragged in!” 


“A dead man!” someone else shouted. 


The monsters snickered and sneered. To my left, Ivan was tending bar; he muttered a snide comment, but I ignored him. I was worried sick. All I could think about was the stupid list of stupid songs. This situation was dire. My life flashed before my eyes. I was thirty-six, too young to die. 


As I sat on the piano bench, an idea came to me: improvise. Yes, of course. Six years of jazz study was about to pay off. They’d been asking for Slow Train to Deathsville. Obviously, the song doesn’t exist (at least in this world), so why not make it up?  


The song title is similar to an old Monkeys classic, so I started with that. Except I changed it to G Minor. Dark and eerie. Perfect for monsters. My fingers edged the piano keys, which were bones, and I played an extended intro. The words came quick: 


Take the last train to Deathville 

And I’ll meet you at the station 

I’m leaving right away, 

To my final destination  

It won’t be slow,  

Oh, no, no no. 
 

‘Cause my life is soon relieving  

Itself from constant fear 

Monsters and mayhem 

Bloodshed, brutes and beer 

And I must go, 

Oh no, no no. 

And I don’t think I’m ever coming home 


I repeated the verses and tossed in a piano solo. They seemed to dig it. They danced and cheersed and walloped, while chugging gargantuan amounts of beer. Some of them slammed danced. You haven’t lived until you’ve seen a bar full of monsters slam dancing, lemme tell ya.  


The nightclub was raging. I had to keep the momentum going; the last thing I wanted was to upset them. The next song on the list was Crossroads After Dark. The obvious choice was to do a chilling rendition of Robert Johnson’s classic: Cross Road Blues.  


The song went over well. A pixie started swing dancing with an ogre. This is impossible to describe. My mind could barely comprehend what it was witnessing. 


I performed for over an hour, giving it everything I had (and then some). The louder I played, the rowdier they got. The monsters were sweaty, stinky, and raucous. And extremely intoxicated. They kept hurling food and drink at me. I needed chicken wire for protection, but there’s no way in hell I was gonna ask for it. 


During set break, Ivan handed me a drink; it was dark green and had floaters in it. I didn’t want to drink it, but I was dying of thirst. The drink tasted like vodka and toads. I gagged but gulped it down regardless.  


By now the Inferno was at full capacity. The lights were low. The heat coming from the fireplace was ferocious. Seated in the back corner was a gruesome gang of goliaths. They had their own keg, and huge glasses of beer filled to the brim. They were playing poker. One of them – a seedy character, wearing a feathered fedora – was accused of cheating. He denied their accusations and tried pleading with them. They cut off his head, and mopped the floor with his blood.  


Sitting across from me at the bar, the pixie was chatting with a flutter of brightly colored fairies; they were bickering about a brute named Bronzie (the same brute she was swing dancing with). The pixie claimed they were flirting with him. The fairies, of course, denied such allegations. 


No redhead, as far as I could see. I wondered when she’d show her wicked face.  


I tried my best not to stare. They HATE that. But without phone service, and not daring to step outside for the fresh air, I had nothing to do. The pixie flew over to me; she said she liked the sound of my voice. The fairies nodded. This gave me hope: maybe the monsters were taking a liking to me.  


Ivan was cowering in the corner, whispering to a lounge of creatures with human bodies, and lizard faces. They were sneaking glances at me, licking their lizardly lips, and frowning.  


I didn’t trust the lizard people. Especially after the precious night, when a band of cowboy-clad reptilians shot up the place. Nor did I trust Ivan, the bartender. Anyone who dresses like Dracula cannot be trusted.  


A tribe of ogres were goofing around at the pissing trough. (I’ll spare you those details.) That they were so brutal and childish was terrifying. How did I get myself into this mess? 


The redhead. She was to blame.  


On cue, she barged through the entrance, dressed in a fancy black dress that showcased her sultry figure. On her head was a pointed black hat. I was smitten, and hated myself for it. Especially after seeing her true identity.  


“Hank!” she said, over the general ruckus, “How the heck are ya?”  


I wanted to lash out at her. To tell her how unfair this was. But I didn’t. Instead, she was accosted by an eight-foot Viking dressed in battle armor; the armor was dented and stained with blood. The medieval sword he was carrying did little to calm my nerves.  


I moped towards the piano bench, hoping I’d lived to see another day. Since I’d played the entire list of requested songs in the first set, I launched into Crocodile Rock, by Elton John. To my dismay, the collection of human skulls sang along; naturally, they sang off key.  


“This is crazy,” I complained to no one.  


I was furious and afraid. On a whim, I launched into Spinal Tap’s Stonehenge, a song I’ve played at various parties. They loved it. But this made matters worse. When the song ended, a henchman stole a severed head from the wall, and was running around the bar, causing amok. It took six or seven giants to subdue him, and the head was ripped to shreds. Now there was  a vacant spot on the wall. Perhaps for my head.  


Despite the mayhem, I played on. More beer and food were thrown at me, but I managed to keep my cool. It was life or death. My set was nearly over. I can do this, I told myself. I was about to start another song – Creep, by Radiohead – when a pack of dog-like creatures tore the piano to pieces. I leapt from the bench and ran to safety, narrowly escaping a hapless fate.  


I checked the time: it was nearly nine. Seeing how I arrived late, I didn’t want to end early. But the piano was doomed. The monsters were brawling – gnawing and gnashing and pulling hair. The dance floor stank like vomit. I was noticing a pattern in their behavior: happy monsters = mayhem; unhappy monsters = death and destruction. The gregarious amounts of alcohol they consumed certainly didn’t help matters much.  


Tony appeared out of nowhere; he looked at me and frowned.  


“Hank! What have you done?”  


I couldn’t respond. Nor did I want to. With monsters, it’s best to be safe.  


He regarded the piano. “That’s coming off your pay!” He checked his watch, “You still owe me fifteen minutes.” 


I was gobsmacked. By now the monsters were settled, and chanting for an encore. Without a piano, I was helpless.  


Or was I?  


I tested the mic, and it worked. Phew. I sang Zombie Jamboree, a cappella. My voice was shaky, but fortunately, they knew all the words. They sounded horrible, but it didn’t matter. 


Tony was glaring at me. Ten minutes to go. I needed a song with audience participation, so I ended the set with Don’t Worry be Happy. 


They hated it.  


All hell broke loose. Tables were turned, beer and food were tossed, cuss words were cussed. The sword-wielding Viking chased me out of the nightclub. Terrified, I charged upstairs, not looking back.  


When I reached the front door, my heart was pounding and my face was drenched in sweat. My clothes were in tatters. As I was leaving, someone shouted at me. I figured it was Tony: he hadn’t yet paid me. But it wasn’t. To my surprise, it was Ivan, who’d been eyeballing me all evening.  


“Hank,” he said in his baritone voice, “the Green Ones at the bar want to hire you.”  


At first, I didn’t understand. Green Ones? Then I clued in: he was referring to the lizards.   


“They dug your rendition of Last Train to Deathsville.”  


Why won’t that song leave me alone?  


I shrugged, and checked my phone, acting busy. 


“It would be wise not to disrespect them,” he warned me. 


He reached into his cape and handed me a business card made of human skin. On it was a name and number.  


“Call them first thing tomorrow.” 


He flicked his cape, turned and left.  


I shoved the card into my wallet, and sighed. There’s zero chance I was gonna call that number. A cool breeze rustled through my shaggy hair. The moonless sky was ominous. Wanting to leave immediately, I walked home, wishing I’d never stepped foot inside that miserable monster [bar.](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromStarr/)
