Apparently there is no support for people who have unconventional issues in the social work field. Every time I try to speak to our employment provided support line they tell me my call is inappropriate. When I post to relevant subreddits I get chastised for lying and making light of the field. This is the last place I can turn to.

I believe someone from work has been stalking me the past few nights. During training for the 988 crisis line, they walked us through scenarios: sexual callers, suicidal clients, verbally abusive ones, the drunk and lonely, even the repeat callers. While I understood that some people might develop attachments or feelings, what they never mentioned was someone crossing the line and getting personal. 

I don’t mean personal as in overly familiar. Dangling leading questions to me in the hopes that I might let slip a detail from my personal life. No. After the first week, I became an expert at diverting questions I deemed to be “prying”. Personal as in coming to my home. I’m still not sure as to how someone could get my location from my work line.

Christmas and New Year’s... the season where loneliness festers, and suicidal thoughts find fertile ground. While I hadn’t been with the hotline for long, I am very familiar with the feelings that the most wonderful time of the year brings for some. On the 23th I got up around 9pm, greeted my wife and cats, grabbed a plate of lukewarm dinner and flopped down in my worn out office chair. With about two hours before work I run through my weekly routine; clean my desk of empty mugs, bottles, assorted snack wrappers and attempt to tidy up my home office. When we were house hunting last year, an office was a key feature we searched for. If Kay had known it would become 50% office 50% hazardous trash heap, she probably would have pushed for extra acres instead. 

Logging in to work I see the usual suspects. It's hard to call someone you’ve only seen a still grainy image of on Slack a friend but I had grown fond of a couple coworkers. Mia and Keith were sometimes the only thing keeping me awake in between calls. Officially we would interact once or twice a week. Our snapchat group was a bit different.

I opened snapchat to see that Keith had already fired off the first message tonight “Jesus Christ did you see the queue today? I figured if you were suicidal, you wouldn’t wait 20 minutes to tell someone about it.”

“I know we all get callus but you never fail to be an ass lol” Mia replied

To be fair, there were quite a few calls waiting for our skeleton crew. Nonetheless, we switched our work lines to be available and the flood gates were open.

“This is Eli agent number 54733 with the Suicide Lifeline, how may I help you?”

“Well” the caller on the line began “lets see if you can make sense of this. Why is it every time I try to turn on Fox it never wants to come through? I know they want to keep me from seeing the REAL NEWS.” Off to a running start tonight.

“I've been so lonely ever since my daughter passed.” Nothing I can say will ease the pain but maybe some active listening will help her get some sleep tonight.

“She’s cheating on me. 4 months of my life down the drain. I’ll never find real love.” Hell yeah dude, I remember my first crush. Caught her holding hands with Zach, life’s been downhill since.

The calls continued for the next few hours as the queue dwindled to 0. Calls would cycle through to whoever has been available the longest. Guess I was too efficient because I got the first call after our short breather.

“This is-”

“Look, I really don't care.” The feminine voice on the other end of the line interrupted, “I’m only calling because I want to make sure someone finds my body.” The sober tone of their voice caused the heart to catch. Oh shit, a genuine call. I opened up our workplace messenger to request Keith or Mia start a 911 rescue.

“Are you currently at home or do you know your location?” Subtlety and ease had already been squashed.

“I’m walking from the parking lot at Acker trail into the woods” her voice blank, offering no trace of emotion. “They can find me 100 yards in on the right side.

As I relay the information I freeze trying to find a way to distract and buy some time. The rare suicide calls we do get have some kind of opening. An edge I can use to get them talking. Emotion to play off of. Not this time. The resolve in her choice seeps through the phone with every word she allows me to hear. Maybe an abrupt question.

“What was the last movie you watched?” I croaked.

“Thank you for your help Eli”

The noise. The fucking noise. It was always in the back of my mind. A gamble. $22 an hour with a non zero chance of being the last voice someone hears before the shuffle off this earth. I bust. Initially I wasn’t sure what I had heard. Guns in movies always sound so clear, not over the phone. At first I thought she dropped her phone, then came the second thud as we tumbled together into the dirt. Miles away yet tethered together at the ear.

Autopilot kicked in as the questions flooded the now one way line. “Hello. Are you there? Hello? I cannot hear you. Can you please respond so I know-” the words caught in my throat as I noticed the gurgling. The slow wet rattle of air desperately trying to pass through waterlogged airways answered my line of questioning. Without a single word, she answered every fucking question I had been trained to ask in this situation. My eyes weighed down in guilt glared at the letters beneath my finger tips. Trying to find the answer to death in the jumble of a qwerty keyboard.

Slack brought me back from the abyss. I peel my eyes up to see that the call had just dropped. The raspy whisper now gone, replaced with nothing but joyful blip of incoming notifications.

“03:16 Calling now. Try to keep them on the line.
 03:17 Update?
           Ask if they have any pets
           Do you need me to listen in?
 03:25 PD called. Enroute. Dispatch number 117 for the report.”

What should I say? I wanted to cry, scream, breakdown, curse whatever god there is for making me sit there and listen in. Stuck a silent observer to a private execution. “Thanks” is all I muster.

This has never happened to me before. Hell, I’d have never had to fill out an incident report. I called my manager, waking her up in the middle of the night. Her voice was groggy but after I explained the call somber. “I see. Umm. Open the folder for crisis and just follow the PDF for incident reports then go ahead and take an extra 30 minute break. Do you want me to hop on and debrief?”

“No, it's fine. Sorry to wake you.” 

After a while the alarm on my phone set for punching out physically made me jump. I had to double check the clock. 8:00am. How? An extra 30 minutes surely would make the time go by but not like this. Have you ever driven home after a long day when the curving of the road and the desolate houses speckled throughout the fields almost lulls you into a trance. You don’t realize you have been day dreaming for the last 10 miles until your house comes into view? That's how the night felt.

Kay was pissed when I woke her up while getting in bed. Not from losing out on sleep, but the fact that I didn’t tell her sooner what had happened.

“What an asshole. Calling in just to force someone to listen. That’s fucked up.”

I know it's not right, morally and maybe legally, to share the information about the call but I had no one else I trusted. Mia and Keith had tried reaching me throughout the night but I just wasn’t in the mood to answer inquiries. 

“I’m sorry bug. Just get some sleep, I will do the chippy chores later so you can sleep in.”
Normally collecting the eggs from the coop is a highlight of my day, but I really didn’t mind sleeping off the night. Of course you can’t be depressed when sleeping.

Panic at the Disco woke me up at 8pm sharp. I thought it was so clever using Nine in the Afternoon as an alarm, now I hate that goddamn song. New day, same routine. Greeted my wife and cats, grabbed a plate of lukewarm dinner, and-

“By the way, I think the Blink in the backyard took a shit. I was gonna check the battery but it's up too high.” she informed me. I assured her it was fine. My office looks into the back yard and when a murderer tries breaking in, I will have plenty of time to get the cats and run while they fight with the bedroom slider. 

My office chair gave off its familiar creak; however, something about the office seemed off. Liminal, almost dreamlike. Maybe the call never happened and it was all a dream. I was so paranoid, I checked the calendar twice. January 24th. Damn, I chalked up the unease to the fact I had listened to a stranger aspirating blood less than 24 hours prior.

After dinner and some doom scrolling, it was time to clock in and check the queue. To my shock there was not a single call waiting. It was too quiet. A part of me felt relief—this could be a calm night, a night where nothing goes wrong, a night where I don’t have to navigate through someone’s darkest moment. But another part of me was uneasy. The silence felt too heavy, like the calm before a storm.

2:37 AM was the first call of the night. I’d be lying to say that it didn’t wake me up from a bit of a nap. Through the blurred vision of sleep and without hesitation, I answered. The sound of static violently burned my eardrums. The volume caused me to toss my headphones onto the desk. Sadly agents are not allowed to end a call without at least attempting to make contact, just in case someone is on the phone.

Like easing into a cold pool, I eased the headphones back on. “Hello?” The annoyance in my voice would be present in the recording I’m sure. I listened for a moment and just before I was able to spit my last greeting and end the call, something hit me. Gurgling. It wasn’t fucking static. The volume threw it off but I was sure of it. The labored breath of a dying consciousness hopelessly trying to clear its lungs. I could feel the tears begin to well underneath my eyes. I started to scream, begging it to stop. I tried, I really did. I confessed I had no idea what I was fucking doing working here, but it didn’t stop. It grew louder and clearer. The river of blood flowing freely from her nose and mouth, bubbling like a broken faucet spilling the essence of life was now crystal clear and deafening. My nails began to lift from their bed as my fingers sunk deeper and deeper into the arms of the chair, desperately clinging to anything in reality. Suddenly, silence lingering for only a moment. Reprieve was broken by the sound of wind brushing through trees and the soft crunch of snow.

The software client flashed “Documentation 1:00” as the call dropped. Replaying the call in my head I hear something. A tap at the window. I fumbled for my phone but I must have fallen asleep with it in my hand. I dropped to the ground and scrambled looking in the darkness of the carpet for my phone. The taps became violent. Whoever or whatever was outside was beating on the glass like its life depended on it. With every landing blow I half expected to feel a rain of glass shards coming down on me. Underneath the corner of the desk I found it. In a single motion I turned on the light and swung upwards to the window. The emptiness of the back yard is all I saw. Nothing. No robber, nor monster in sight. I was desperately squinting my eyes to see deeper into the back yard when Kay started screaming from the other side of the house.

I could feel my heart hammering in my chest as I crossed the expanse of the house all the while, her screams never letting up. Entering the bedroom I switched on the light and started reaching for the dresser drawer we keep our pistol in.

“Someone” she cried breathlessly “someone is outside. I saw their hands smacking the window.”

Running to the window, my stomach sank. Nothing. Same as the office window. At least if I was greeted by a face, our fears and experience would have been validated. After a brief check around the house to assure all the windows and doors are locked we sat down and discussed what happened. Deciding the police were likely to do nothing if they bothered to come out this far in the sticks at night, we set the couch up in my office so Kay could sleep and spent the night trying to make sense of the whole ordeal.

Every night this has been happening. I get a single call and it's always the same PTSD inducing sound followed by the barrage on our house. Since the first night, it's moved on to the doors as well. Any time we check, it's an empty yard. The second day, we called the police and they said there were no signs of anyone and to be on the lookout. No one believes us and we are getting desperate. Batteries for the backyard Blink should arrive sometime today but I’m not sure what to do after that.
