I have a story to share with you. Not many people will believe but even if you don’t the world needs to know what happened. I was born in a small town and from a young kid the Old Asylum stood there. No one remembers when it closed or even when it opened but it has always stood there. I was five years old when I met my five friends, Lilly, Ava, Noah, Lucas, and Mia. My name is Evelynn Richardson and here is the TRUE story of the Old Asylum. I refuse to share the name because what has happened to me and my friends should never happen to anyone else. We were 15 when we decided to go into the old asylum. We were dumb teenagers with no fear in the world.



“Come on, guys!” Ava complained, her voice as high-pitched and annoying as it always was. I had a love-hate relationship with Ava. As nice as she could be she could also be the biggest bitch in the world. Some days I just couldn’t tolerate it. 



“We’re going, Ava,” Lilly replied, rolling her eyes and flipping her blonde hair over her shoulder. We moved through the forest, the only sounds being the chirping of birds and the movement of small animals in the undergrowth. A brief wind flew through moving trees older than most of the town’s residents. The Old Asylum, what I will call it for the rest of the story, loomed in front of us. The building was surrounded by an overgrown metal fence. There was a large gap in the side, decayed from age. The Asylum looked more like a prison than a place to help people. As I passed the boundary a somber feeling fell over me. I didn’t say anything as no one else seemed to have noticed anything but I had a bad feeling about this. A terrible feeling. My friends would make fun of me for voicing it though.



The inside of the building was even more eerie, it was dark the windows boarded up but not even a sliver of light came through. We each turned on our flashlights illuminating the cracked floor tiles. Hospital beds and wheelchairs were overturned, and medical supplies and papers spread across the floor. Shadows around the building were too big, too odd, and moved way too weirdly. I felt myself jumping at every noise, my heart hammering in my chest faster than ever before. I was jumpy and I didn’t even know why. I didn’t even know what I knew now but it was like my mind knew. My body knew before I even knew. 



We peered into each room, all of us had fallen silent at this point, perhaps feeling the same paranoia that I had felt. No one wanted to be the one to voice it though. You know the teenager need not to be the first one to voice that you are scared, to face your fears and put on a brave face. Most of the time it is minor, though but it cost us this time. Even me. 



“Woah. What’s that?” Ava asked, pointing at something odd. There was a table with straps all over it, and a light above. The table beside it had a strange, rusty object. In the object's prime, it was clear it was a metallic silver. It was not a rusty brown. A reddish brown dust was surrounded but it was different than the rust. It was on the table, even on the object. It still didn’t hit me what that was. Just that it was an unknown object. I had learned what they used to do to mentally ill patients in the means of “fixing them” but it didn’t click at the time. Perhaps I was too jumpy, or maybe they didn’t want me to realize. 



A strange machine also sat on a table, long unused and most likely didn’t work anymore, or so I thought at the time. Now I wasn’t so certain what gave me that conclusion. My brain feels scrambled all over. Like something stuck its hand in there and whirled around my thoughts. 



We ended up splitting up. There was a brief argument between all of us. Noah didn’t want to go to the second floor, he wanted to leave. Ava wanted to go to the second story. I wanted to leave with Noah too. Lilly wanted to go with Ava. Lucas and Mia wanted to continue exploring the first story, mainly the medical rooms. Ava and Lilly went to the second story. Noah and I went to leave. Lucas and Mia continued forward. It was a stupid idea but I had the worst feeling possible. That if I continued then I would die. I didn’t want to die and the thought of dying terrified me right down to my core. 



Noah started some small talk but neither of us were feeling it. We just wanted out. We were speed walking to the front entrance when we heard something terrifying. A cackle. I’m not talking about the kind of laugh you’ll let out when with a friend. I’m talking about a general honest-to-God crazy cackle. I froze, my legs trembling under my weight.



“Come on! Evelynn!” He said, tugging me onwards. His eyes were wide as he looked into every corner. Every shadow looked like a person, reaching their hands out to grab us. I finally came to my senses and sprinted after him, he kept a firm grip on my arm. Noah was then snatched and yanked away from me. 



“Evelynn, RUN!” Noah told me. I know I may seem like a coward but I ran. I ran like my life depended on it. Even as I saw a shadowy figure drag him to the medical bed I saw the rusty object and saw it eventually shoved through Noah’s eye. I saw him scream and then he went still. I didn’t even know if he was still alive I just kept running. I reached the front door and turned the handle. It was locked. I yanked on it as hard as I could, screaming and crying as I banged on the door, begging pleading to whatever force was behind this to let me live. I begged with all I had, and apologized, feeling I had somehow angered them. That was when Lucas and Mia ran into me, Lucas tugged me into his chest, and Mia wrapped her arms around me.



“What happened?” Mia asked, her voice shaking and breaking.



“S-something killed N-noah. Stuck the metal object through his eye.” I whispered, I felt there was no way he could still be alive after that.



“Come on. We have to keep moving.” Lucas said, taking the place of the brave person for us. I am forever grateful for Lucas. None of us would’ve survived as long as we did if it wasn’t for us. He gave us a fighting chance, or as much of a fighting chance as we had against the forces of the asylum. We weren’t meant to make it out alive and they made sure. The boards wouldn’t come off no matter how much we tugged at them. The back, front, and other doors wouldn’t break open no matter the condition of them. We TRIED. We FOUGHT. 



Ava was next to go, she was dragged to the machine that I was certain didn’t work. We didn’t even think about it. I mean it wasn’t even plugged into the wall AND there was no electricity. We froze as the machine worked, an electrical shock ringing out as she writhed around, her eyes widening as her mouth froze in a silent scream. Lucas was the first to come back, tugging us away. Lilly, Lucas, and I were the only ones left out of the five we had come with. Deep down we all knew we weren’t going to make it out of this alive. Our phones had no service and the battery was quickly draining. Our flashlights were lost sometime in our mad dash and we were all getting tired. 



We were racing around, trying to find some sense of safety, when a shadow appeared in front of us. We froze, waiting to race around when it disappeared just as fast as it had come. Lucas was the first to notice the empty syringe in his leg, filled with some unknown thing. He yanked it out and we continued running. We locked ourselves in one of the rooms, hoping it was safe while we rested. We were tired. Lucas not too long later started shivering, his face burning hot and his eyes glassy. We tried what we could for him but we could do nothing in the old asylum. 



Then it was only Lilly, Mia, and I racing around, still trying the doors. We all had lost hope at that point but none of us wanted to admit it. I wasn’t necessarily the next one but as we crept around the hall I was yanked into a room. The door slammed shut, the lock clicking on the outside. My friends tried to free me but I told them to go. They needed to save themselves. I thought I was free from the pain of death. Lilly and Mia weren’t in here with me. Around an hour later, the screams started. I heard every little thing of my two friends, the sweetest people in the world, screaming in pain and agony. 



After the screams stopped I was sitting there. I was there for days and days. I didn’t know why they kept ME alive. They kept me trapped in here. I didn’t know all the details of asylum treatments around that time. Isolation is the worst pain a person could ever go through. All you are are alone with your own thoughts. It got to the point where I even started scratching numbers into the wall with a piece of concrete—one every minute. 



After an hour, my stomach started growling. I lasted almost 4 days, nearly a day longer than estimated. I tried to make it last until they broke me out but I couldn’t. I couldn’t. My eyes drifted shut as my breaths grew labored. I don’t know when exactly I died but I awoke standing next to my body, my body still. The ghosts of the asylum are clearer now and they are excited to have new recruits. They are lonely here. They want more to come. They were treated oh so terribly here. They are trapped here all alone for eternity. Please come. Find the asylum. Find it.
