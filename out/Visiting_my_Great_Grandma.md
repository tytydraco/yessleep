Hey everyone

 Recently i've been to a therapist to help me with my mental health , so far the experience has been pretty pleasant and my mental health did improve this past month but since we started talking about my childhood i started remembering some questionable things from my childhood.

  These events are something i could never find a logical explanation for , i am a sceptical person ,never believed in the supernatural and i like to think of myself as a woman of science , everything has to have some sort of rational explanation behind it ,now dont get me wrong i do like fantasy ,sci-fi and horror also to be honest life would be more interesting if it had a little bit of fantasy in it at least for me 

   That being said the first "disturbing" memory that comes to mind is that time when me and my grandparents visited my great grandmother for her 78 birthday , i was 12 at the time

The worst part of visiting relatives was the trip to get there , at the time grandpa still had his old dacia(thats an old romanian car that doesn't exist anymore) and everytime he would fill the tank the smell of a disguting gas would always hit me and almost made me throw up 

   Anyways when we arrived at the great grandma house she was waving at us while my dog was the happiest he could be when he saw us wagging his tail and jumping around but that was when i saw it ,there was a person standing behind my grand grandma and i got out of the car to go and hug her , i could see the person in the back better and i stopped in my track , a feeling of overwhelming dread just hit me i was feeling sick to my stomach and my knees got weaker when i saw that the person looked exactly like my great grandma its like it was her twin but the thing that i was terrified about was the fact that the person was holding a knife and before i knew it the person grabbed my great grandma and slashed her neck ,the next second i saw her falling to the ground with a horrified and confused expression on her face while that thing had a horrible and unnatural smile it was like it tried to smile without knowing how to smile if that makes sense , whats even more confusing about this event was that right after i woke up in the car seeing my grandparents in the front sits discussing one of the topic they talked about on the road 

   I didn't knew what to think my mind was completely blank ,after few minutes of gathering my thoughts i thought the whole thing was just a dream since i often sleep in the car while traveling but it felt way to real to be just a dream but not wanting to think more about it i just ignored these feelings 

  This wasn't the only weird thing that happened while i was at my great grandma place .This time was an actual dream and i know dreams can feel really realistic , the human mind is a weird thing but this dream in particular is something that extremely terrifies me to this day 

  The dream is pretty simple and short and some of you would say that its just a dream and im thinking to much about it or im just a scardy cat, dreams are dreams they dont mean anything ,well i agree but the thing is that while i forget about my dreams after few seconds or i just ignore them right after this dream is the only dream i could never get out of my mind , i could never forget it or not feel scared about it

   The dream is about me walking in the hallway of my great grandma house and i see a figure behind the curtains and after seeing it i start to feel more and more anxious , i start approaching the figure ,i grab the curtains to look at it and right then the figure said " dont worry its me" , now i know this is the most ridiculous and silly thing to be scared it might not seem scary at all but let me tell you the moment the figure said "its me" made me feel like the color drained from my face , something about that made me so terrified that i never woke up that scared and sweaty in my life something about that is so uncanny that its making me tremble uncontrolably in fear , now you might think what coud've been so terryfing behind that curtain , a monster, a demon , satan ? no, to me that thing is way more horrible then any of that , the level of hate and sheer malice coming from that thing when it spoke those words made me feel fear like nothing else , im not scared of the concept of demons or satan in fact i feel nothing while thinking about those things but everytime i think about that figure the level of fear i feel simply can't be put into words even now as an adult and whats even more horrifying is that every few often when im alone i hear a faint whisper saying "its me"
