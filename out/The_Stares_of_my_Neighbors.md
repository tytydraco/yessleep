Last night, I caught my neighbor staring at me through the window.

 I just happened to be walking past the living room window, when I noticed the old woman who lived next door, sitting on her couch, just watching me with this horrid look on her face. 

She didn't even pretend to look away in that super awkward way that we humans tend to, when we're caught doing something incredibly rude, or even stupid.

It was like she was in a trance. Her eyes almost buldged from her wrinkled, leathery face, the creases on her features began to slowly tighten until she looked like she would just about fall apart at any moment.

I waved to her, but that only seemed to make things worse. Her eyes opened wide and started tearing up, her teeth began to gnash, and her fists kept clamping shut tight, then releasing.

Yet she wouldn't move an inch. She just sat and stared right into my soul.

I felt my chest tighten, my mind playing out paranoid scenarios at lightning speed. What the hell was wrong with her? Was she going insane? 

I slowly inched forward, trying not to let my anxiety take over. My mind was trying to rationalize what it just saw, to no fucking avail.

That's when I saw her grandson run right up to her. She didn't even blink. He held up a drawing for her to look at, shouting and giggling. 

Slowly, the old woman grabbed his head and turned it out the window. When he had turned and looked at me, his eyes went wide, and he started staring with the same unnatural look that his grandmother had, and pointed at me.

His eyes went numb and twitched wildly as he went still. His gaze would not break from mine. I tried to motion to him, mouthing out "Do you need help?"

The boy's head started to turn sideways, still staring directly at me. His body went limp.

Now I knew for sure something was wrong here. I quickly closed the distance to my window and shut the blinds, trying to shake the feeling of being watched. 

It was like icey needles were slowly piercing the back of my neck. I couldn't breathe, but when I turned around to go grab my inhaler, there was another person staring through my window, this one on the opposite side of the room.

My body felt wobbly as I processed the man and his wife, my other neighbors. They stood in the lawn just outside my house. Both of them were just... Staring. 

The woman's face was twisted up in a look of absolute hysteria, her mouth pursed so tightly that her head was vibrating from the pressure. She looked like she was muttering the same words over and over.

Her husband was next to her, just a few feet from my window. He looked at me with a tightly wound look of absolute disgust. His body kept shivering, his tongue continuously licked his lips, like he was trying to keep them from drying up.

I could feel my lungs trying to collapse in on themselves as I tried to wrap my mind around what was happening. I bolted across the living room, almost tripping on the corner of the couch as I ran faster than I ever had in my life.

I practically tore the blinds down getting them closed as panic started shifting me into auto-pilot. I started to scream as I turned, seeing another set of unblinking eyes looking in through a window in the kitchen. It was the only visible window from where I stood and stared back. 

The mailman usually made late runs, but now he was stood completely still, the mail from his satchel blowing around him in a swirling motion. It was as if he had been walking and just completely froze the moment we locked eyes with each other. 

I started to scream at the top of my lungs, running to close the window. The man was just like the others, unflinchingly gawking at me with this  growing intensity that made me want to curl up and cry.

As I closed the curtain over the kitchen window, I decided enough was enough. I was going to call the police and have these people arrested. Whatever the hell was going on, it couldn't be natural.

When I called, the bored woman on the phone assured me that the police were on their way. I managed to calm down a bit, assuring myself that it might be me who is going crazy, not them. Or maybe this was some elaborate trick, a prank set up by the neighbors.

God, I hoped so.

Not long later, I heard the authoritative knocking that police officers always used to intimidate criminal and civilian alike.

"Police! Open up. We got a call from this residence about a disturbance in the neighborhood."

I sighed, relieved that the people outside must have left. Now I would have to explain to the officers that this was all just a silly misunderstanding. I always was a paranoid person.

I opened the door quickly, happy to receive the help of my tax dollars at work.

I wish I hadn't.

Two young police officers were stood on my porch, one up close and one lingering by the stairs of my porch. 

They both stood motionless, staring at me with the same intensely rigid eyes that everyone else had planted into their skulls that night. The front officer started stammering like a catatonic soldier stuck in combat, his fingers digging at nothing while his arms were stiff as a board. 

The other looked like she was sweating and drooling on her uniform as she shivered, her face trembling from the stretching of her muscles, all tightening rapidly.

I screamed with the force of a jet engine, slamming the door in their faces. I turned to run, no longer trusting the outside world.

The only place I could go where they couldn't spy on me was my basement, so that's where I fled.

I wrenched open the basement door so hard that the hinges practically splintered the door frame, the door knob puncturing dry wall as it slammed out.

My brain kept replaying a kaleidoscope slideshow of their horrible expressions, the glistening eyes that stared at me from body's that no longer belonged to my neighbors. Hell, the whole world could be fucked, for all I know.

I quickly and quietly made my way down the rickety wooden stairs to my basement. The smell of mildew and old concrete made my head feel weak as I descended into the dimly lit room.

I must have left the lights on when I went down there earlier. Eerily enough, I couldn't remember when or why I came back up without the spare kitchen chair. It was the whole reason I went down there in the first place. I knew I had company coming over later tonight and I wanted to be prepared. 

I got about ten steps from the bottom when I stopped, holding my breath as nerve tingling sounds reached my ears.. 

It sounded like someone was down there. A man was whispering to himself, occasionally releasing a low and menacing laugh. He was talking to himself, and I could hear what sounded like a blade slicing into fresh meat. He would slice then laugh, slice then cry out...

I couldn't go back up, so I thought maybe I could sneak by and find a weapon, maybe set up a barricade in the back room. I could stack the washer and dryer and block the door, I thought. 

I slowly creaked down the stairs.  The moment my feet touched cold basement concrete, the man's mumbling and laughter ceased. 

In the deep, dark dampness of my basement, a single lightbulb hung from above. The smell of copper and iron flooded my nose. It took me a long time to process the lunacy that lay before me.

Under the single glowing yellow-orange light of the room, a man stood there. He wore a ragged looking olive colored jacket, a pair of torn and dirty jeans, and had a long, bloodied knife gripped tightly in hand.

He just stood there, staring. His eyes were so wide that they looked like they would tear right open if he sneezed. His chest rose and shrank quickly. It looked like he would reach down and tear his own stomach out at any moment. Blood dotted him in dark speckles from head to toe, and he shuffled just a bit in place with a nervous energy I had yet to see that night.

I could feel his eyes drilling right through my head, like he was stuck here for all eternity.

At his feet, I saw a bloodied and mangled corpse lying face up on it's back, the blood coagulating as it touched the cold concrete floor, steam rising into the air from the warmth leaving it's host.

I wanted to scream. I wanted to run upstairs. Run out the door, and find someone in the shadows of the streets to come and help me sort out the insanity of this night that I fell head first into unknowingly.

Not because there was a killer in my house. Not because everyone was staring into my soul that night. 

It's because the body I saw under that bloodied knife and flickering fluoresent bulb...
