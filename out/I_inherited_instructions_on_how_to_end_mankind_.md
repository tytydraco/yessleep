My father's death came as a bit of a shock to me, up until the last few days before his death my father had been the star image of a healthy man.

Those last few days something changed... I don't know how to describe it but my father seemed drained - like something had stripped all the joy from within him.

So when we received the news that he'd been found dead of an apparent suicide after a night-shift, the news surprised us all.

For days after that, my mother was bombarded with questions, mostly regarding my father's mental health. Occasionally, we'd get a phone call from family, offering their condolences, other days, no one spoke to us at all.

A few days after my father's death, something changed in my mother as well. Originally, I chalked it up to just being grief, after all she had just lost her husband of 30 years, but it gave me a bad feeling... like she knew something I didn't.

A few months passed before the issue of my brother and I's inheritance came into play, my father had willed a large sum of money to each of us, and a few belongings had been gifted to my brother and me as well.

One of the things my father had left me was peculiar - say the least, a scroll of parchment paper, the scroll contained various grotesque and indecipherable drawings and my initial first thoughts were 'this must be a mistake' after all why would my father leave me a scroll of nonsense? More over - why would he even have this thing to begin with?

I threw the scroll into the attic, and for a few years I forgot about it.

It would occasionally come up in conversation between me and a few friends, but other than that, the scroll remained buried in my past.
Of course - this story wouldn't be here if that damn scroll had stayed there.

I was cleaning out the attic of my old belongings - most of it was the usual junk, old toys I never so much as looked at anymore, books I hadn't read in years, a few old plushies left to gather dust - and of course. The scroll.

Now, I don't know why I didn't just throw it away then and there, but I felt curious... that same curiosity I'd felt 3 years ago when I first saw that scroll.

I carefully unrolled it, and I was confused to see familiar words - not those weird symbols and indecipherable letters, but English.

There was a surprisingly huge amount of unnecessary details written on that scroll - so I'll spare you the headache and give you a brief of summary of what it said.

'The means to an end;
destroying mankind.

- prepare for the sacrifice.
remember, preparation must involve your full intent, your devotion must shine through.
- complete the killings, you have each sacrifice killed at exactly 12:00 am, if you do not, you have failed.
- remove the heads off each corpse and line them up, smallest to largest.
- now use the blood, paint the following symbols carefully, once painted, the ritual is complete. He will be with you shortly.'

I sighed and placed the scroll in the bag with the rest of the trash, and continued cleaning.
Maybe if I'd done that first - maybe if I'd never read it, I wouldn't be writing this now.

The first signs something was wrong were the nightmares - I can't even begin to describe them... but for your own sake, just be glad that you don't know.

The hallucinations started the week after, and then came the psychosis. I remember one dream, where a strange figure spoke to me, and it told me of my sins... I shouldn't have degraded the scroll.

I don't know how, but I knew what I needed to do. I knew what it wanted me to do.
So, that night, I prepared for the sacrifice, I lined up all five of my victims, and completed the ritual.

Nothing happened at first - but then the lights began to flicker and a chill ran down my spine, I suddenly felt as if I was being watched. I didn't see anything, but I heard the disembodied whispers... amongst them, I heard my father's voice.

He begged me to set him free, I'm sorry. I really am... if you're reading this, it means it's too late, he will be with you shortly.
