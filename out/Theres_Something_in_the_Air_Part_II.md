“Travis? What the hell brings your dusty ass out this way?” Jack says as he lights a cigarette on his porch.

The words of affection that I’ve been looking forward to whenever I show up unexpectedly at Jack’s old place.

“Just looking to sleep with Debby,” I responded with a smirk.

“Hell, man, you could have at least bought me a six-pack before you came here.”

“On some real shit Jack, I need a favor, may I come inside?”

“Let me finish my square and then we’ll head in and get a drink or something, sit out here and enjoy the breeze, what’s going on, man?”

“The VA screwed me over big time and I’m running out of my happy pills. I have two days and some change until I’m going to be losing my shit, I just want to be near some good company during that time until I get my refill, that’s all”

Jack seems to take a moment and contemplate a response. I could tell that he wasn’t sure what he wanted to say.

“I mean, this is out of the blue man, and you know I don’t give two shits about you being here, I just gotta speak to Debby about this”

“I understand man, I was only looking to stay until next Monday, Id be more than willing to help out around here, even if that means shoveling pig shit”

“Hell, I know *you* would, and I’d love the company man, but Debby…”

Jack takes a deep drag off his cigarette before continuing.

“You know what, fuck it, she’ll be fine, and it’s my place anyways so she’ll have to be fine with it”

“Thanks, Jack, I appreciate it.”

“No worries, man, but this place ain’t a five-star, so you’re gonna have to deal with the mess.”

“Of course, I understand.”

Jack drops his cigarette after finishing it, and we both head inside.

Jack’s place was built early in Colton’s history, and outside of a satellite TV, some lamps here and there, and a landline, it still looks like it never left the Great Depression. The bedroom I’d be staying in was more like a closet with a cot, but I’d slept on worse.

“Want a Coors, or some Tennessee Honey?” Jack asked with a slight smile.

“Just a Coors”

“Hey, have you noticed a strange odor out there?” I asked as I stared at my drink.

“My brother in Christ, I live on a pig farm, I smell shit almost everyday” Jack said with a slight chuckle.

“Nah, I mean a rotten egg smell, kind of faint?”

Jack took a pause and said, “No, I haven’t.”

“Quit bullshittin' man, there’s a rotten egg smell out there, you really can't notice it, but if you focus, you can smell it, go outside,” I said casually.

Jack promptly went back to the porch and came back inside about a minute or two later.

“Nah man, I can’t smell shit out there, well besides pig shit that is.”

“Alright,” I said with a dismissive tone.

“On my way over here, I saw Walt doing some strange shit by his cornfields.”

“Walt? That old ballsack? When doesn’t he do some strange shit?” Jack asked dismissively.

“I mean, some real strange shit man. He was looking up at the sky and yelling about how something was here. I tried to ask him if he was alright, but he jus…”

“JACK! WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON DOWN THERE?!” Debra’s loud and bellowing voice seemed to shake the house.

“Fuck, I thought she’d be asleep” Jack quietly said.

“It's OKAY, hon, Travis is here and he’s staying to visit.”

Debby hurriedly came down the stairs, and her stare at me seemed to sting like a dagger. Her dark brown eyes reflected off the dim lamp with a fury out of hell.

Turning her attention to Jack, Debra asked…

“And why the hell didn’t you let me know earlier?”

“Dammit Debb you know Travis and you know that he’s a good friend of ours” Jack hastily responded.

“Is he?” Debra scoldingly looked back at me.

“Well, if he’s gonna be visiting us for some time, you better work his ass, or I WILL” Debby sternly told Jack.

“He wants to work, hon,” Jack responded.

Upon hearing this, Debby hurriedly went back upstairs and slammed the bedroom door.

“You know how she is, man.” Jack said, ashamedly, “She is in one of her moods today.”

“It's all good, let’s just enjoy the beer,” I said with some ease.

I contemplated continuing to tell Jack my experience with Walt, but he seemed stressed. I couldn’t blame him. Debra was a handful most times. Like me, her brain was wired differently. She took her happy pills too.

Jack and I drank a couple more Coors, exchanged some stories from the past, and I retired to my cot.

It was nearly 11:00 PM when I finally hit the cot.

Before I dozed off to sleep, the smell came back. It was slightly stronger than before. This time, though, it was inside.

Since the walls in his place were flimsy, I could hear most things throughout the house. Floors creaking, the occasional mouse scurrying about, and once Jack returned to his room, I heard Debra ask him what the rotten egg smell was.
