The calm that followed the earthquake was almost as chilling as the event itself. There was nothing soothing or peaceful about it—neither of us dared to move. I bit my lip, slowly turning to face my brother. The look on Casimir's face was completely disturbed, and I was sure mine was the same. Unable to keep his mouth shut for too long, he was the first to speak up again, breaking the silence.

"What the fuck."

"I… I need to see after the others," I choked out, turning towards the woods. 

"I'll come with you," my little brother stated readily, and I took note of the gleam of the handgun tucked into his waistband in haste. Heading into the direction of the treeline, we found a familiar figure hovering beneath the snow-laden branches. Aleksei was in his human form, kneeling on the ground, slumped over and palming his face. His shoulders were trembling, and it was only when I got closer that I realized he was trying not to cry. He looked up at us, eyes big and startled like a deer in the headlights.

"You're here." His voice was a low, anguished growl.

"Of course I'm here." I dropped onto my knees in the snow in front of him. "Why wouldn't I be?"

"I felt the earth shake… and I saw the Evening Redness over the meadow. *Arek…*" Suddenly, his eyes overflowed. He started wiping at them with a fury, turning his head away. 

"Casimir, would you give us a moment?" I asked with a sidelong glance at my brother. 

"Sure. I'll check on the guards," Cas offered, taking off into the thicket and leaving me alone with Aleksei. 

I cautiously crawled up to him and placed a tentative hand on his shoulder. "Uh, okay, big guy… I'm about to hug you. If you have any objections, let me kno—"

He pressed himself against me before I could finish my sentence. The embrace lasted only for a second before he snapped out of it, quickly and forcibly disentangling himself. He awkwardly cleared his throat and rose to his feet. "This… we won't speak of this again."

"Would you mind telling me what exactly just happened?"

"I couldn't say exactly. I… it… there's something…" He faltered, trailing off to take a deep breath. "Beneath the red meadow. It sleeps. It has been sleeping for a long, long time, completely quiet, too. What in the world happened to make it stir?"

"The only thing I can think of is… I did this clairvoyance ritual-thingy with the Bannik and I saw the memories of—" I paused, holding his gaze as I spoke the name I knew meant so much to him. "Arkadiusz."

"Arkadiusz," he repeated, his tone laced with reverence.

"M-hm. You, uh… You were very, very cute as a kid." I raised my index fingers to the sides of my head, indicating the nubby antlers I'd seen on his infant form. "What with the little stickies in your hair and all. You were so tiny. Oh… wrong moment to bring that up?"

He gave me an irritated snort. "It never ceases to astound me how someone so well bred and elegant can be this snarky."

"I'm not being snarky, I just genuinely think you were adorable."

"So change snarky to irreverent and my point still stands." He was visibly trying to hide the smile that was tugging on the corner of his mouth. As much as he claimed to despise my impertinence, it rather seemed to amuse him. 

"Could you tell me about Arkadiusz, then?"

"What do you know so far?"

"Well, my mom always used to say that some ancestor of ours immigrated here from a Western Slavic country. And that he built the house and the sauna and brought all the creatures with him. But I wanna hear it from you."

"Fine. Walk with me?" He offered his arm and I shrugged, stepping closer and folding my hand around its crook. He had to temper the length of his strides for me to be able to keep up.

"It's been several hundred years since I last made an effort to remember Arkadiusz, so please excuse the hesitation. This isn't exactly easy for me. Arek… Arek liked mysteries. He was a bit of one himself—none of us ever found out much about him, who he used to be, where exactly he came from, why he did the things he did… He simply appeared to all those of us who needed him. I assume you bore witness to the state he found me in. I was small, young, alone and completely hopeless. I had no home, no land to call my own. If he hadn't taken me in, I wouldn't have survived. 

"Times were changing back then, you humans were losing their regard for us. When I say us, I'm referring to the collective of beings that I, too, am a part of. Not human, not sacred, not hellish. The church was discouraging you people from respecting us; worse, they were actively pitting them against our kind. They managed to get some of them as far as to try and hunt us down. The ones who had once sought our benevolence and protection now came after us with their pitchforks.

"Obviously, you little folk are no match for most of us, so the only beings they were strong enough to kill were the weak ones. Less powerful creatures, and… youths and children. Admittedly, most of us come into existence not by birth, but as the ghostly remains of humans, but take me for example—I am the result of the union between a Leshy and his wife. I would have spent my infancy sleeping and waiting, one with the forest, until the wood-demon that fathered me died. I would have. If it hadn't been for the saints taking torches to the trees that were my birthright." Aleksei fell silent as his steps slowed. His eyes were downcast, his mouth a stiff line.

I was about to say something when he spoke up again. "Don't pity me. I don't need your pity, wench."

"You have it anyway, *old man.*"

The Leshy sucked in a deep breath. "Forgive me, I meant no offense."

"It's okay. Go on."

"Well… Arek found me in my darkest hour, and he took me in without thinking twice. He had already gathered quite a group around him. They were nomads of sorts. A strange caravan; we were mistaken for the Wild Hunt several times. We never settled down, and Arek liked that. He led us into the north, then across the sea, then back, forming a good deal of alliances wherever he went. Innumerable creatures sought to follow him. He made enemies, too, of course—his way of living was not exactly safe. But Arek was a skilled fighter. Not just that, he also had all of us on his side. Everyone in our party would have gladly given their life to protect him. He was our… our warden. Our father, almost. Mine, at the very least."

I slowly moved my other hand up to pet his arm. "You really loved him, huh?"

Aleksei laughed, quietly and bitterly. "I allowed him to call me by a name. Of course I loved him. But I was always aware of his nature, I knew he would not be with me for long. You humans are mayflies. I've outlived Arek and every one of his heirs yet. I'm aging, yes, but I'm still nowhere near eternal sleep. I've never lost sight of that fact."

"So you're saying you didn't get too attached to him?"

"I'm saying I tried."

I pressed my mouth shut, suddenly feeling the grief he exuded. My hand continued to stroke his shoulder, like it was a separate entity entirely. It was a wonder he hadn't shaken it off yet. 

"Like I said, Arek made quite a few enemies, too, and one of them stood out. It was an entity unlike any other. I believe I used to call it the Evening Redness when I was a boy. It appeared out of nowhere, attaching itself to the wanderer, and it kept turning up wherever we went, even though Arkadiusz never did anything to court its wrath. We tried to figure out what it wanted, but it was futile. We'd see it, and it would see us, but it never communicated any clear intent. But it wanted him. What for, I'll never know. It was toying with him, nearly driving him mad, appearing to us again and again, and every time, it seemed to come closer. Arek was terrified. We all were. Eventually, he packed us all up and we crossed the waters one last time together. He moved us here. We were happy enough to go along with it. It didn't matter to us *where* we went at the time; we'd gotten so used to being a community.

"Either way, we arrived and we found this place. A patch of land, unclaimed, uninhabited. It was ours. So he started building the house, the sauna for the Bannik, the enclosures for the livestock… He gave me the woods; said they were mine now, that I was going to be the one to uphold order." 

He exhaled. "I finally had a forest. My birthright. Mine and that of all those like me. We can't exist without one. So we were happy, and everything was peaceful, even though we scattered. The water spirits took over the lake, the huldufólk started carving out its hiding spots, I began to stake my claim. Everyone was right where they should be. But Arkadiusz' enemies had followed him, as well. The Kikimora would stomp around the house occasionally and had to be dispelled; the giantess Gryla showed up to try and get her hands on the little one Arkadiusz had fathered… and then the other being showed up. The persistent, ancient one."

He paused, and a strange look passed over his face. Then, he shivered. He actually shivered. 
"Nobody knew what to do anymore. Nobody knew how to fight it. Fiona, that entity… it's not like me. Not like us. I don't even know if it's of this world. One night, it all came to a head. The being had been standing in the sky for *days*, lying in wait as Arkadiusz had locked himself up in his house. 

"He was going crazy, muttering to himself, shutting himself off even from his son and the woman he'd gotten with child. His final moments must have been pure agony. I don't even know what he was thinking—all I can tell you for certain is that I was sitting in a tree, watching the house when Arek stormed out in nothing but a shirt with a knife in his hand. He went stumbling to the meadow, right where this entity was hovering, and he yelled into the sky like a frenzied animal. Then, all of a sudden, the Evening Redness… how to describe it? It went inside him. It entered his body, and Arkadiusz cried out, then slit his throat.

"I ran to him when he fell. His blood… his blood was everywhere. It turned all the little flowers red. They've been growing in that same color ever since." He paused, letting go of a long breath. “We laid him to rest knowing the Evening Redness was inside of his body. In the bones that are still rotting down below, or whatever is left of him at this point. I don’t know if the Redness has preserved him as a vessel, but it seems as though it’s still here. It seems to be sleeping, and I think you made it stir. What did you do?” The question was not reproachful. 

“I think I felt Arkadiusz inside me. He was there for just a moment after I viewed his memories, it was like this weird resonance…” I shook my head, chasing away the uncomfortable recollection. “Then the ground started shaking. My bad, I guess.” I tried to keep my voice light, nervously scratching the back of my head. 

“You’re not at fault. I suppose the Redness has become aware of you, then. It was preying on Arek all those years, it makes sense for it to perk up upon sensing his spirit’s presence. I can only make assumptions but it’s possible that it has an interest in your bloodline. Perhaps in its slumber, it has up until now been unaware of any descendants he’s had.”

“But it laid right back down… Is there any chance it’s not going to cause any issues now that I’ve found it?”

“I wish I could give you a definitive answer, my dear lady, but I truly couldn’t say. Who can tell why it followed us in the first place, or why it chose this as its resting place."

"I see. Thank you for telling me all this," I said, gently pulling away from him. 

"Pleasure to help. If indeed that was of any help whatsoever." He bowed his head, taking a step back. "I wish to be alone for some time now."

"I understand," I replied steadily, watching him retreat into the thicket. I made my way back to the house with a heavy heart. I didn't know what to make of it all. I appeared to have located the being Nick was looking for, but I in no way meant to hand it over to him. I owed him, yes, and courting the Devil's wrath was likely not something anyone would ever want to risk. The death of the entity itself would be nothing to mourn. It would rather be like I was avenging the killing of Arkadiusz. But I didn't want to imagine the consequences of the Evening Redness being consumed by the Beast. I didn't want to find out how this would help him "turn the tide".

I made my way back to the sauna where I briefly caught up the (understably confused) kindly old spirit. I thanked him for his efforts and stated that I would surely be back soon. Back home, I ran myself a bath. I just wanted to relax, just a little bit. By then, I should have really known that that'd be too much to ask. I undressed and slid into the tub, leaning back with a long sigh. I had left the window wide open, so the cool air was wafting in, grazing my cheeks as the rest of my body was enveloped in the pleasant heat. The soap I'd used had created soft mounds of glistening foam gliding on the warm water's surface, and I idly popped a few of the bubbles with the tip of my finger. Closing my eyes, I let myself sink in further until I was fully submerged. 

When your head is underwater, everything that's happening outside sounds so strange.

I could hear the water drifting around me, a deep, low droning; outside of the tub, the heater was buzzing, sending the slightest of vibrations to my ears. I could even make out the howling of the wind.

The bathtub felt like a whole other dimension.

I couldn't help but think of Arkadiusz. How strange that this whole dilemma should have started with wannabe cryptid hunters entering my property when my oldest ancestor, the one who first established said property, was *technically* something of a cryptid hunter himself. Feeling myself run out of breath, I moved to emerge from the depths again, only to find that I… couldn't.

It took me only two seconds to realize that a large hand was pressing down on the top of my head, preventing me from bobbing up. The panic set in almost immediately. I pushed back against it, struggling and beginning to thrash around. Memories of the Vodyanoy flooded my mind, images of my soaked wedding dress bearing me down as I flailed helplessly appeared before my inner eye. *No.* These weren't the Twin Lakes, I was in my own home, I was supposed to be safe. I reached out blindly, arms piercing the surface as I tried to grab onto whomever was trying to drown me. My fingers met with very, very warm skin, a lower arm which I grabbed onto and began to pull. The other person wasn't giving in, though.

Down below, the sound of laughter reached my ears, abstracted by the water that was still in the way but nevertheless audible—cruel, genuinely amused, merciless.

My pulse was racing, the need to breathe growing into a sharp sting in my throat. I was growing desperate, nails digging into my assailant's skin to the point where I felt one of them bend and finally break. I screamed in pain, water entering my mouth. *This is it,* I kept thinking, *fuck, this is it—*

And then, all of a sudden, the pressure was gone and I emerged abruptly, sputtering and coughing before gasping for breath. My chest was tighter than ever, and I greedily gulped down as much cold air as I could. Furiously rubbing the water from my eyes, I blinked at the person standing over me. 

Unkempt brown hair. A scarred face. A wide smile.

*Jeremy.*

The shock was enough to send me scrambling away, pressing my back against the faucet. I was too afraid to move, too afraid to scream—I was quite literally frozen in fear.

Then, my little brother's features began to rearrange, his eyes darkening and his face morphing until I found none other than Old *fucking* Nick staring back at me, the grin very much the same. 

"Hey, Miss Novak."

I exhaled loud enough to make him giggle. 

"Scared you there, did I?" He sat down on the side of the tub, seemingly not minding his sweatpants getting wet. He was already drenched from the struggle, foam thinly running down his dark red skin. "You really don't like Jeremy anymore, huh? I thought about doing Casimir instead, you know, just to get that extra kick out of you, but the art of shapeshifting is a subtle one and it is infinitely more difficult to imitate someone *that* handsome." He shrugged. "I'm still very much satisfied with your reaction."

I glowered at him, still panting.

"Anyways, I had a feeling you've been making progress, so I figured I'd come over and check up on things."

"Yeah. Well. I found it," I admitted, chest heaving.

"Excellent!" He leaned in, looking delighted. "How very efficient you are."

"M-hm. You get a lot of things done if you don't waste time creeping into women's bedrooms or torturing your acolytes."

"Are you sassing me, Fiona?" 

"Appear to be, yes."

He narrowed his eyes at me, smirk unfaltering. "Well, I'll be damned, she's getting cocky." He straightened up. "Lucky for you, I'm the forgiving type. And it helps that you're not wearing anything."

Despite the immediate need to cover up, I kept my eyes trained on him, not so much as flinching. I wasn't going to betray any kind of shame in front of this bastard.

"So?" Nick asked.

"So what?"

"You know exactly what I mean. Where is it?"

"I'm sorry, did I agree I'd tell you *right away*? Because you said you wouldn't stress me out."

Nick sighed. "You don't wanna play that game with me, forest bride. I *invented* that game. Where is it?"

My mouth was a thin, short line. I shrugged my shoulders.

"Fucking— okay. *Okay.* I do take care of mine, no one is gonna tell you otherwise."

"Reckon they wouldn't be alive to do so."

Nick tilted his head in consideration. "Yeah, well. Either way. I'm feeling generous. I know you have some stuff that needs sorting out, so I'm actually going to be nice about this and wait until you're ready." He chuckled. "It's funny—I always thought *I* had Daddy issues. Anyways, you take care of that, and I… I'll just be in touch. I *will* be. You can count on that. Meanwhile, I'm just going to have to prove my good will to you, won't I? No harm, no foul. Some folks just need convincing. And I think I've got your number." He tapped me on the shoulder, and then, one second to the next, he'd disappeared. 

I sat in silence for a beat before hearing Cas' voice call out to me. "Fi! Are you in the bathroom? You might wanna come downstairs!"
