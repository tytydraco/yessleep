When I was just a girl, i used to play teacher with my dolls almost every day. I’d lay them in a row on the carpet, dress them in little uniforms, and position their little plastic bodies in studious, ready-to-learn positions. I’d strut around my room with a bedtime story in my grip, pretending like I was teaching them important life lessons. My fantasies could never compare to the real thing, though. *Nothing* compares to the real life fulfillment of feeling like you’re making a difference in a child’s life- seeing the light in their eyes instead of the soulless plastic faces I was used to.  After I started teaching for real, I threw away all of my dolls. Couldn’t stand their plastic faces anymore, it felt blasphemous. 

I want to preface this by clarifying I remember each student I’ve ever had the privilege of meeting. It might take me longer sometimes to get my memory of them going, but eventually I *always* remember. I remember them all. And I loved them all (I still do). I can’t figure out why or how this is happening, and I honestly feel quite humbled. Maybe I don’t know everything and some things are better left unexplained. It seems like there’s nothing I *can do* anyways, so maybe I should just live in a blissful state of blind delusion? It all comes down to one kid, anyways. One singular child who has caused me to question and doubt every basic law of human nature and existence. If i can get rid of him, or forget him, or make someone *believe me* maybe I can find myself again. I don’t know. It’s probably too late for that. 

It was my second year of teaching and my first year at the private school I’m at now. It was such a jarring switch from public school- perfectly wealthy families wrapped up with a pretty bow on top. I was there to teach them skills they’d probably never need beyond their schooling, because daddy’s company would immediately hire them post grad. It felt like my kids were always the sweetest ones. Bright-eyed third graders, ready and eager to learn. The school I teach at is Montessori-esque, basically a fancy word for hands on learning. It was very different from the conventional practice of teaching, but it does allow you to form a stronger bond with your students. 

*He* didn’t show up on meet the teacher day, or the day after. It was on the second real day of school. I thought he was a lost kid at first, and I was prepared to help him find the correct classroom. As the rest of the class played with their toys, I knelt down beside him at the door. 

“Hey buddy. Do you need some help finding your class?” 

He nodded. 

“Let me help you out, sweetie. What’s that piece of paper you have in your hands?” 

He handed it over, eyes never leaving mine. 

It was his class assignment sheet in perfect condition. Sure enough, it had my class listed as where he was supposed to be. It read: 

ROOM 406 FLOOR 4
MS. DEGONIA
RALPH MANHATTAN

I looked it over, confused. I hadn’t seen his name on my roster yesterday, and with a last name like that - I was sure I would’ve caught it. 

“Well, seems like you’re stuck with me then… Ralph! Come on in, we’re just getting started.” 

Ralph stayed close behind me and followed me into the class. I finished my introduction speech and glanced over at my roster again. Huh. I *had* missed his name yesterday, i guess. I made a note to self to email my supervisor about that later.

Ralph’s first year in my class was relatively normal, besides the fact that he had a few quirks. He was extremely shy and quiet, always observing the other kids. He sat in the same chair each class, and would get there early just to have it all to himself. One thing I found fascinating was his big, red scarf he’d wear just about everyday as well. Just regular, loner kid stuff. 

I’d love to skip ahead to the later years, but there are some important things I *must* mention before I move ahead. 

1. Ralph never had any parents listed as contacts in his file. There was only an address and a phone number. When brought to administrative attention in later years, this was often brushed off as parent neglect. 
2. Ralph has blonde hair, green eyes, and a large freckle on his left cheek. 
3. Ralph is an only child, and has no documented siblings. 

After Ralph’s first year, he showed up in my class the next. Under almost the exact same circumstances as the year prior. He came to my room, holding the piece of paper with my class name on it, waiting to be let in. This time, I had called the administration immediately, as there had to have been some kind of mix-up. They assured me that he had gotten held back to re-do the third grade at the request of his family. This was concerning to me, as Ralph never struggled with his studies, and was consistently at the top of his grade. Anytime I tried to push for more information, the answers only got more vague and passive aggressive. So, I dropped it. Maybe it’s his home life, or something religious? I didn’t mind another year with the kid, despite the unjust circumstances. 

Year two was almost identical to his first. He talked a bit more, but only to me and in one word phrases, mostly. Ralph played by himself and chose to nap most recesses. He hadn’t aged a day and was significantly shorter than his old classmates. His old “friends” would wave at him in the halls politely, acknowledging his presence in a friendly manner as they made their way to the fourth grade room. Things were fine. 

Year three was where things began changing. Ralph had transferred schools. I was sad to see him go, until on the first day of my third year- there he was again- outside of my door with that damn class assignment sheet. I was beyond perplexed and called my colleague over to try and clear things up. 

Tyler Capone, the other third grade teacher, was about as much help as you’d expect. 

“I thought Ralph had transferred” I questioned through gritted teeth.
 
“He did” My colleague’s eyebrows twisted into a perplexing expression. Why was he staring at me like *I* was the crazy one? 

“So, why is he standing right here?” 

Ralph looked up at me, blank expression on his face. 

“Oh, that’s Ryan. They look kind of similar” 

I looked at the sheet again. At second glance and in the blink of an eye, the sheet *had* changed. 

ROOM 406 FLOOR 4
MS. DEGONIA
RYAN MANHATTAN 

“They have the same last name, too?” I spat out, eyeing the sheet as hard as I could. 

“They’re probably related or something, I mean come on, you got ‘em mixed up yourself, Brooke!” 

I stared Tyler down, face contorting.   

“Oh, my bad. I mean come on, you got ‘em mixed up yourself, *Ms. Degonia.*” He replied, misreading my expression. 

Taking my silence as an opportunity, Mr. Capone Led Ralph into my classroom. 
 
“Cmon in to Ms. Degonia’s class, kiddo. You’re gonna love it there.” 

I pulled Tyler aside after the kids had settled into their classrooms. 

“Okay, we’re away from the kids now” I whispered to him, becoming very serious. “You can be honest with me, what’s up with that kid?”

Tyler chuckled underneath his breath and placed a comforting hand on my shoulder. 

“Brooke, you gotta relax. Families are weird. *Kids*  are weird. I’ve learned to stop sticking my nose where it doesn’t need to be. No one’s dying. Let’s just do our jobs, okay? It’s probably just some random rich people family drama.” 

I looked up at Tyler and sighed. Maybe I *was* overdoing it. I had family drama. Some stuff is better left alone. 

“Yeah, yeah I’ll drop it. For now” 

I turned back to the kids. They *were* all happy. No one was in danger. This was fine. *I* was fine. 

This year there were a few major developments. From this point on, Ralph came back each year as a different “R” name paired with the last name “Manhattan”.  Year Four, he was Richie, Year Five, he was Roscoe, and so on and so forth. Something would physically change about him every year as well, but it was so small, if you weren’t paying attention- you’d miss it. His hair would be bone straight one year, then a violent afro the next. He had these obnoxious glasses one year. He went through a year where he had a face full of pimples (that one was particularly unsettling). There was ALWAYS something different and no one seemed to care or notice. This was *clearly* a different kid, and I’m being pushy for asking. 

Another change was Ralph’s in-class behavior. Around years three and four, he became very disruptive. He’d bust into tears in the middle of class, begin scratching at his neck so aggressively he’d bleed, he’d shove other kids over in class, things typically classified as “bad kid” behavior. I wasn’t inexperienced with a disrespectful kid or two, and we usually had a rambunctious one in the class anyways so I wasn’t too thrown off. He’d sit in class,
in the back, scarf wrapped around his neck tightly, a grumpy look plastered on his face. He only hung around and talked to me, so I was able to keep him at bay most days. 

But one day- something changed.

Year Five, on the third day of class, he came into class so pitifully exhausted. Head slumped over his shoulders and eyes sunken in. I was immediately concerned and nervously went over to talk to him. Was there abuse going on at home? Where even *was* his home? Who knows what this child is experiencing?

I called Roscoe over to my desk. 
 
“Hey buddy. How we feeling today?” 

He remained silent and held his head even lower. 

“I’m tired of always coming back here, Ms. Degonia.” 

I was confused, but prepared to answer. Clearly, this kid doesn’t like school. I didn’t believe the whole “endless Manhattan relatives” thing, but (for the sake of my job)(and sanity) I had learned to stop asking questions at this point. I had assumed his condition was some kind of taboo learning disability some ultra rich parents wanted to keep away from the public eye. That, or he’s some freakish lab project. 

I had a speech prepared in my mind about the wonders of elementary education, and was reaching over to ruffle the hair on his head. As I placed my hand on top of his scalp, A few things immediately disturbed me. 

He was *absolutely freezing*. He was *wet*. He was *soft.*

Pressing down into his scalp was like sinking into quicksand, slowly delving into a deep and endless pit. He seemed unbothered by my hand, which had sunk several inches deep into his frontal cortex. I quickly lifted my hand out of his mop of hair, and suddenly realized my hand was covered in a black liquid. 


I mumbled curses underneath my breath and wiped off my hand on my blouse. 

“We need to get you to the nurse, *now.*” 

Year Five was a hard one for me. This was my breaking point where I realized the school was absolutely no help. Post nurse visit, Richie was discharged with a severe case of the Flu- Furiously, I rushed to the nurses to protest.

When I brought my unnerving news to the nurses, she simply stared at me for several seconds. The subtle smile faded from her face, and her eyes went glassy. 

“It’s a classic case of the Flu.” 
 
“Do you think I’m stupid? This is some fucked up stuff going on. Have we contacted his parents? Does he have any? Ralph, Richie, Roscoe… whoever this kid is, he’s not, you know, the way a kid is supposed to be!” I felt like the room was spinning. Was I insane? I looked at the black stain on my hand. No, this was real. 

The nurse said nothing. The resting smile returned to her face and she continued on with her day as usual. 

I was yelling at full volume now. 

“I don’t know what the *fuck* is going on, and I’ve tried to keep my damn mouth shut, but I’m not doing this. There is something wrong about that kid, and I don’t want any part of it. Keep your money, I want out. I quit!” 

I had assumed that would work. Despite the fact that I would be losing the job I loved, i felt free that afternoon driving home from work- freer than I had in years, and freer than I would be for years to come. 

The next morning I woke up in my classroom, at my desk. My class was in front of me- faces smiling and ready for the day. My immediate instinct was to stand up, bolt for the door or window, and scream for help. But, I couldn’t. It was like my body was forcing me to get up and step over to the white board. I picked up my pen and began to write the agenda for the day. I gained control of my body for a brief moment and forced my head to turn back around at the class. 


*He* was in the corner, staring back at me. Black, beady eyes burning into my head. His legs were stretched and decomposing, and his arms were almost deconstructed. It looked fake. Like a glitch on a computer game. I thought it might have been my imagination at the time, but his foot was merging with the floor itself .That being said, none of it compared to this face. It was stiff, stretched back, and pale as a sheet of paper. The slits of his eyes peeled open permanently and his mouth hanging slightly ajar. 

He looked downright plastic. 

Evidently Soulless.  

And yet, I couldn’t resist looking at him.
