When my sister Lisa died two years ago, our family changed forever.

We weren’t perfect before—who is?—but Lisa’s death fractured us. My dad barely speaks anymore, my mom busies herself with every charity event she can find, and I… I’ve been stuck. Angry. Looking for someone to blame.

Lisa was the glue that held us together. She was warm, outgoing, always laughing. The kind of person people gravitate to. She loved hiking, photography, and the outdoors. Her death—officially ruled an accident—was almost poetic.

She slipped while hiking and fell into a ravine. At least, that’s what the police report said.

But if that’s true, why does it feel like her ghost never left?

Lisa’s ex-boyfriend, Matt, was never part of our family.

He and Lisa dated for about a year before she broke it off. She said he was controlling, obsessive—constantly texting, showing up unannounced, making passive-aggressive comments when she spent time with her friends. I remember her joking about it once, calling him “my stage-five clinger.”

But it wasn’t funny. Not really.

After the breakup, Matt didn’t take it well. He kept texting her, leaving voicemails, even sending her flowers at work. She brushed it off, said he’d get bored eventually.

I thought she was right. Until the funeral.

Matt didn’t come to the service, thank God. But a week later, he showed up on our doorstep.

It was a rainy Thursday. My mom opened the door and there he was, holding a bouquet of lilies—Lisa’s favorite.

“I just wanted to pay my respects,” he said. His voice was soft, his head tilted like he was trying to look vulnerable.

My mom, who has never been good at saying no, let him in.

Matt sat on our couch, talking about Lisa as if he knew her better than we did. He described her laugh, her smile, the way she always ordered pancakes with extra syrup. My dad stayed silent, his jaw tight.

When Matt finally left, I asked my mom why she let him in.

“He’s grieving too,” she said.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that Matt wasn’t grieving.

He was lurking.

Over the next few months, Matt kept appearing.

He showed up at family barbecues, holiday dinners, even my dad’s birthday party. Always uninvited, always with some excuse. “Your mom said it was okay,” he’d claim, or, “I thought Lisa would’ve wanted me here.”

My parents, blinded by their own grief, let it slide.

“He’s harmless,” my mom said. “He just misses her.”

But it wasn’t harmless. Not when he started asking questions.

Last Christmas, Matt cornered me in the kitchen.

“She was different with me, you know,” he said, leaning against the counter.

I stiffened. “What’s that supposed to mean?”

He smiled, that thin, unsettling smile I’d seen so many times. “She told me things she wouldn’t tell anyone else.”

“Like what?”

His smile widened. “Like how she wasn’t scared to die.”

That night, I went through Lisa’s journals.

She was the type to write everything down—her thoughts, her plans, even little grocery lists. Most of it was normal Lisa stuff: song lyrics, doodles, random observations.

But then I found the entry.

“I think Matt’s been following me. He won’t stop texting. Keeps saying he knows something I don’t. I’m starting to feel like I can’t shake him.”

I showed it to my mom, expecting her to finally see reason.

But she waved it off. “Lisa was dramatic sometimes,” she said. “I’m sure it’s nothing.”

A few days later, I saw Matt’s car parked down the street.

It wasn’t the first time. I’d noticed it before, idling near the corner, but I convinced myself it was a coincidence. This time, though, I knew.

He wasn’t watching our family. He was watching me.

Last week was my dad’s birthday.

Matt showed up, holding a gift he claimed Lisa would’ve bought: a coffee table book about hiking trails.

I couldn’t take it anymore. I confronted him outside, away from my parents.

“What the hell are you doing here?” I snapped.

His smile didn’t falter. “Paying my respects,” he said.

“Lisa broke up with you. She wanted nothing to do with you. Why can’t you let her go?”

His eyes darkened. “She told you that?”

“Yes.”

He took a step closer, his voice dropping to a whisper. “She told me a lot of things too. Things she didn’t tell anyone else.”

Then he said something I’ll never forget:

“I was there, you know. On the trail.”

I felt like the air had been sucked out of my lungs.

“What?”

He smiled again, a cold, empty thing. “She didn’t fall. She looked me in the eyes and asked me to let her go.”

My stomach churned. “You’re lying.”

He tilted his head, studying me. “Am I? Ask yourself this: If she slipped, why didn’t she scream?”

I called the police that night.

I told them everything—the stalking, the journal, his confession.

When they went to his apartment the next morning, it was empty. No furniture, no clothes, no sign he’d ever lived there.

It’s been a week now.

I haven’t told my parents what he said. I don’t know if they’d believe me.

Every night, I double-check the locks. Every night, I sit in my bed, clutching my phone, too scared to sleep.

Last night, I finally decided to look through Lisa’s journals again. I don’t know why. Maybe I thought I missed something. Maybe I was looking for answers.

But this time, there was something new.

The last page, which had been blank before, now had a single sentence scrawled across it in jagged black ink:

“He’s not watching. He’s inside.”
