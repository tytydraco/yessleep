The expression “dead tired” has a new meaning to me.

Literally. Because I’m dead…*ish?*

I don’t really know, but I don’t think I have much time left to explain. Gloria really wants her body back.

I work at a restaurant, right? That means I work weird hours. That also means my sleep schedule is nonexistent, and a fucked up sleep schedule leads to nights like last night.

I was too tired to fall asleep if that makes any sense.

It had been a rough shift with customers yelling at me about things out of my control and management busting my non-existent balls left and right. “Valarie why didn’t you do this? Valarie why didn’t you do that?” Type of bullshit.

Managing to fight the urge to walk out every ten minutes, I finished my shift on a rather dull note. After sidework, I didn’t end up getting home until after two in the morning.

My mind raced as I laid on the bed in my dark bedroom. Despite the suffocating exhaustion and the fan blowing by my side, providing a wonderful white noise, my mind and body were restless.

“I just want to sleep,” I’d cried and mumbled, tossing and turning and flipping my pillow over multiple times.  Peace. I craved a nice, peaceful, sleep.

I hadn’t had a good nights rest in I don’t know how long. Be it night terrors or strange serving dreams, every morning I’d wake up feeling more tired than the last.

Miraculously, after my pitiful pleas, my body granted me the sweet release of sleep. My mind calmed, tense muscles unclenched, and my breathing slowed. I was out like a light in just a couple of minutes.

This morning I woke up surprisingly refreshed. I stretched, yawned, and got out of bed, feeling lighter than usual.

As I finished my routine of cracking the bones in my hands, neck, and lower back, something in my peripheral vision caught my gaze.

I paused in horror. Laying on the bed was… *me.* But I was standing up, not lying in bed. Yet, there my body was.

I needed a mirror. Luckily, there was one in the corner of my room. When I got there, my dark brown complexion appeared to be paler than usual and just a pinch translucent. My eyes were sunken in too.“Ghost” was the first word that came to mind.

“This is not what I meant!” I groaned, panicking. (Can ghosts even panic?!) Frantically, I started pacing around my small room, asking myself the appropriate questions. *How did this happen? How did I die?!*

Did I really croak? Was it a heart attack? It had to have been a heart attack! I knew I needed to lay off all those damn energy drinks and espresso shots!

I couldn’t be dead. I was so young, so full of life. Was this astral projection, maybe? I looked deeper into the mirror, analyzing my ghastly reflection… Nah. I was definitely dead.

And of course, of all days, I had to go and die on my one day off! What would my co-workers think?! Would they cry for me? Come to my funeral? Steal my tips?

My alarm clock went off, causing me to jump. I almost had *another* heart attack. I walked over to the machine and pressed the button to turn the blaring sound off. Apparently my hand was incorporeal because the tip of my finger slipped through the atoms and into the middle of my alarm clock. Strangely, I didn’t feel like anything.

I could stand on solid ground but couldn’t physically touch anything: *noted.*

Just my luck. I died and would have to listen to the incessant beeps of my annoying alarm clock for the rest of eternity!

I went back to the mirror to spiral. *Could this day get any worse?*

Suddenly, a click came from across the room. The alarm clock shut off right after. I paused, then turned around, feeling my third heart attack coming on.

A tired groan came from the bed. The lump under my black satin sheets started to stir. My jaw almost hit the floor when my body sat up, stretching and yawning… like a normal person. Who was alive!

A startled shriek left my mouth, which my body apparently didn’t hear. Instead, she got up and started cracking her bones just like I had. The usual routine.

“Hello?” I asked, cautiously walking up to my body as she got ready to crack her elbows. My body didn’t seem to hear me, continuing with her normal bodily adjustments un-phased. This was all so bizarre.

My body looked, well, like my body. Dark golden skin, long black wavy curls, my soulful blue eyes… except they didn’t have their usual sparkle because I wasn’t in there. I tried to poke her but that went about as well as you’d expect for being a ghost.

She let out a breath when she was done stretching, pivoting on her foot towards the closed bedroom door. I followed suit. “Hello? Anybody in there?!” I asked again, louder this time. My words still fell on deaf ears.

My body opened the door and closed it before I could follow her out. A frustrated grunt escaped from me. This was going to get annoying, fast. I went to hit the door and release some of my pent up aggression, but I accidentally stumbled through it instead. *Also noted.*

So that’s how most of this morning went. I followed my body around and watched as she did what I would do. She spent a good portion of the morning scrolling through my phone, checking up on my social media accounts and laughing at funny compilation videos of cat memes. Around noon, my body dragged itself out of bed and started doing some light cleaning. She made the bed, picked up stray pieces of laundry bringing them down to the laundry room, and even tidied up my kitchen. When that was done, my body took a nice, long, shower.

Meanwhile, I kept yelling and screaming to try and get her attention. If I were in my body my throat would be bloody and raw, my voice hoarse and barely above a whisper. But, as a ghost, you don’t really feel anything. I couldn’t feel temperature or the things I was touching. Couldn’t feel pain either. Just raw emotions apparently.

I even tried to write a message on the steamed up mirror in the bathroom, but it just fogged up instantly. She’d been taking a really *hot* shower.

When she was done, my body got ready and left the house abruptly. I had planned on doing a bit of grocery shopping today so I assumed that’s what she was up to. With the house all to myself, it was time to experiment.

First things first, I couldn’t fly or float no matter how hard I tried. Interestingly enough, if not thinking too hard about it, I could sink through the floor. If I concentrated or got angry enough I could also touch things. I barely managed to open a door and get a glass of water (couldn’t drink it though) all in the time it took for my body to get back.

Spoiler alert: she didn’t just go grocery shopping. No, my body came home with some of my friends and co-workers in tow.

This was the first deviation in what I had planned for the day. While I was known for having a good time, my plan for the day was to catch up on some much needed sleep and just chill all day. I wanted to have as little social interaction as possible, not throw a whole ass party.

My co-workers Jennifer and Alex, and my friends Nicole and Linda helped bring groceries in while my body got the drinks pouring.

“It sure is cold in here,” Jen said after I tried to touch her. Someone needed to know it wasn’t me in there. But, even with all the progress I’d made earlier, my hand still fell through her.

My body made a joke about the margarita she was making warming Jen up in no time. The rest of the girls laughed as they finished prepping snacks to have with their drinks.

In response, I grabbed a pillow off the couch and chucked it.

“Whoops,” my body chuckled nervously, fixing to go grab it. My friends just stared at the pillow awkwardly. Clearly it hadn’t fallen across the room on its own.

For the first time that day, I had grabbed somebody’s attention. It felt good, so I kept doing it.

I tipped Nicole’s glass over onto her shirt. She wasn’t quite happy about that, but my body chalked it up to her being clumsy. Nicole shrugged it off as a random muscle twitch and cleaned herself off.

Darn.

After shouting at them some more, I started playing with the lightbulbs that hung over my kitchen counters. The lights would flicker when my hand would phase through the bulbs. It was absolutely mesmerizing, like a moth drawn to a flame. In this case, a ghost drawn to a light bulb.

My body was starting to look real annoyed at that point. When my friends asked about the lights, she claimed it was just faulty wiring and urged everyone to try the new dip she’d bought to ease their minds.

Honestly? The more I messed with them, the more powerful I felt. Being a ghost was starting to be fun, but it was utterly exhausting.

How had nobody realized it was me behind the strange happening around them? I was doing very Valarie things for peat-sake! I managed to spritz some of my perfume in the living room, turned the tv on to my favorite show, I even slammed my bedroom door just for the fun of it.

But for every little thing I did, my body always had the perfect excuse. She had sprayed some perfume to freshen up the air. She wanted to turn the tv on for background noise as they chatted. A stray draft and faulty hinges were responsible for the door slamming upstairs. And to my dismay, the girl’s seemed to buy these excuses: hook, line, and sinker.

In a fit of rage, I flung a shot glass off the counter. Alcohol misted my cabinets as the glass shattered into a million pieces. I was starting to think of doing some real *Paranormal Activity* type shit and open all my cupboards and just start throwing things.

The girls started whispering amongst themselves then. Hope swelled through my ghostly chest. It looked like they were starting to catch on. Maybe this nightmare of mine would finally end!

Before I could do anything else, Valarie 2 excused herself, telling the girl’s, “Sorry, guys, I need a minute to myself. I’m waiting for some more guests to show up and I just want to check up on them.”

My friends just gave some non-committal noises as they kept drinking, lying to themselves that everything was fine. It wasn’t. I was done playing around. To everyone else, it looked like my barstool moved by itself, but in reality I kicked it as I stormed out of the kitchen, following my body out of the living room.

“I seriously need you guys to get here already,” my body mumbled to herself as she reached my mud room.

Taking the opportunity with just the two of us alone in the room, I got real close and stared into her eyes. They weren’t mine anymore. Those eyes belonged to something dark and evil.

“Who are you!?” I cried, seething at the imposter.

She looked me right in the eyes and gave me a sinister smile.

“I’m Valarie Nuñez,” my body discreetly whispered before opening the front door. She then gave my shoulder a harsh push, which surprisingly connected.  Stunned, I stumbled back, tripping out of the doorway and onto my porch. “Now get out of my house!”

I thought I heard something else come from her mouth, but I couldn’t discern it during the heat of the moment.

The next thing I know, my front door was being slammed in my face. My eyes went wide as I came to a realization. “So you knew I was here all this time? You bitch!”

Losing my composure, I let out a guttural scream as I stomped my foot in frustration. This caused my house’s foundation to shake. The lights flickered and rattled as well. Scared yelps belonging to my friends came from inside. *That was new.*

I tried to phase through the door, but I wasn’t able to. My head banged against the wood, causing it to shake. More startled screams came from inside. I heard that *thing* start to make up excuses to try and comfort them.

Body slamming myself into the wall and windows didn’t work either. It was like a barrier has been put up, keeping me from getting back into my own home.

Giving up due to sheer exhaustion, I sat and cried on the sidewalk. I realized then that I don’t think I’m dead. But *something* is in my body. I need to find out what so I can get my life back.

I *want* to keep working at my shitty serving job. I *want* to spend my days scrolling through social media and laughing at cat memes. I, Valarie Nuñez, *want* to live.

Picking myself up off the ground, and filled with a new sense of determination, I went on an evening stroll around town trying to think of possible remedies for my little problem.

This is when I met Gloria. Or, for lack of a better term, accidentally possessed her. Because, yeah, that’s apparently something I can do.

Now, I didn’t do it on purpose. Gloria just caught me at a bad time. We accidentally bumped into each other while I was angrily stewing in my thoughts. Instead of walking through the middle aged Mexican lady like everyone else, I kinda just latched on? I dunno, but being a ghost is really confusing. And yet, I do have to admit it *has* been nice being corporeal again.

I’m currently back at her place. A cool thing about possession is being able to tap into muscle memory and getting a free place to stay for the night. The only downside is that Gloria’s been yelling Spanish profanities in my ear since taking over. But, as time goes on, it’s getting easier to tune her out (I promise I’m going to give her body back, I just need to finish this first).

Her apartment is nice and cozy though. This place seriously reminds me of my abuela too. She even has a nostalgic McIntosh that I’m using right now to type all this out.

Anyway, the whole reason I’m posting this is because I need *someone* to know that I’m still here. That I’m a ghost.  And whatever is in my body, is not *me*.

On a completely unrelated note, does anyone know how to deal with a haunting? Gloria’s apartment has a [ghost.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpnsAthenaeum/)
