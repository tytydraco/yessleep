Author's Note: Not sure if this really fits here, I'm not sure my brand of horror is creepy in the same way you guys like, but I figured it was worth a shot. At the end of this post is a link to my blog, where this story was originally posted.

I woke up and wished I hadn’t. The white popcorn ceiling of my apartment stared back at me as baleful morning light spilled in through the window, leaving the shadows from my blinds to dance against the wall and floor.

I lay there for what felt like hours, struggling to process, but it couldn’t have been more than a few minutes. Habit pulled me from bed, but the usual morning routine couldn’t pull me from my mental funk.

The warm rhythm of my shower was more oppressive than comforting, breaking the fog only long enough to get me through a breakfast I didn’t taste, and a cup of coffee, which tasted terrible. The caffeine brought with it enough thought for me to call into work, but not so much for me to realize I didn’t need to. They wouldn’t be expecting me.

When my boss picked up the phone on the second ring, I was only mildly suprised. He was the type. “Superior Imprints.” His voice, usually animated and full of enthusiasm, was dead this morning. It told me all I needed to know.

“It’s John. I can’t come in today. Sorry.” My words were stilted. Unbalanced. He should have asked if I were okay. If I was sick. Normally he would have. But this morning, he didn’t ask for an excuse, and I didn’t offer one. Was he fingering the gun he kept in his drawer? If he was, I wondered what he’d use it for.

“That’s fine. Probably going to be slow, anyway.” The response was curt, and stung a little. It wasn’t goodbye. No farwell. Just the click as he hung up.

I stared out the kitchen window, eyes looking at nothing, and taking in everything. It felt like I was watching the world through someone else’s eyes. Like “John” had taken the back seat to his own life. Like he was third person in a first person story. All sense of control was gone. There was only a sinking feeling in my chest, and the vague but powerful fear that the couch might swallow me if I sat down on it.

“Resistance is futile.” The words felt honest, but they broke through my fugue and brought a faint smile to my lips. Star Trek had always held a special place in my heart. Men like Kirk and Picard were men of action. Men of hope…

Before the gloom could overwhelm me again, I moved towards the front closet and and the inevitable tubs of personal history one collects over a lifetime.

Rays of sunlight spilled in from the front window and illuminated the clear plastic boxes, revealing their contents. I’d inherited most of these from my grandmother, who had insisted on keeping every damn homework assignment, science project poster, baseball trophy, and merit badge. ‘you’ll appreciate it when you get older.’ she’d said. At the time I’d believed her, but now, looking over the piles of half-forgotten memories and achievements, all I saw was junk.

I left the pile of memorabilia scattered across the floor instead, pulling out the box of camping equipment. I’d thrown out the tent and sleeping bag years ago, after a raccoon had clawed its way in looking for food. When it hadn’t found any, it left a pile of feces behind, presumably to mark its displeasure. Despite my best attempts, I’d never managed to get the smell out.

The memory brought another faint smile to my face. All I’d been able to articulate then was a series of curses. Now, though, I could see the humor.

I double checked the box’s contents before changing into something appropriate for the outdoors in late October and I didn’t bother to lock the door behind me as I left.

The city was unnaturally quiet as I wove through the streets. Traffic was light, the usual pattern of Tuesday morning gridlock was broken, reduced to a few vehicles slowly meandering between lanes, unmolested by the sounds of police sirens and honking horns.

My old Toyota was the loudest thing on the road, coughing and spluttering the way cars do after a few hundred thousand miles. It was an ancient old lady of a car, more noble of spirit perhaps than its rust and dents would suggest. Frail in a way most cars never got, but with more life inside than most would suspect. Another inheritance from my grandmother, though this one was more welcome.

The gas stations were all closed, so I settled for a small neighborhood market with a fuel pump on the other side of the parking lot. It was open, though a glance at the rows of empty spaces would have suggested otherwise. The only signs of life were a beige Ford Fiesta, and a panhandler slumped in a green camping chair near the front doors.

The vagrant was filthy, his clothes ragged. His long beard and hair gave him the look of a shipwreck survivor, a year or two into his exile. The six-pack of beer at his feet, and the lost, glazed expression on his face, did nothing to help his sloven appearance. A beaten sign over his chest read “THE END IS NIE” in bold sharpie. The irony, and the misspelling, tugged at some dark recess of my soul and I snorted as I walked inside.

The market was empty except for the lone cashier who sat drooping behind her checkout counter, phone clutched to one ear while tears ran unrestrained down her face. I didn’t approach, instead shifting my focus to the aisles of food. Black marks crisscrossed the floor, the graffiti of the inanimate. The closest a shopping cart could come to saying, “I was here.” I followed them, collecting what I needed before making my way back to the clerk.

Her eyes were bloodshot and puffy, but she wasn’t crying anymore. She finished her call with, “I’ve got to let you go, mom. I’ll call you back in a few minutes. Yeah. I love you too.” before sniffling for a moment. “Sorry. Not a good day.”

“Not a good day.” I agreed. It was the understatement of the century.

She began scanning the items in my cart. The mild bleeps interrupted the soft buzz of fluorescent lights.

“Want to talk about it?” I asked.

She shook her head, and I tried not to let relief show on my face.

“Not really.” she said, smiling a fragile, sad sort of smile. “Thanks though.”

“No problem.” We packed the food away into plastic bags, and I offered her a twenty.

“Don’t worry about it. It’s on the house.” she said.

“You sure?”

She nodded and tapped the name tag that marked her as a manager. “You’ve been the only customer this morning. Besides, I needed the distraction.” She tried to smile, but the effort filled her eyes with tears.

“You sure… Cheryl?” I asked, after another glance at her name tag. This time, I wasn’t asking about the items.

Her eyes didn’t meet mine, but she glanced at something beneath the counter. A gun probably. “I’m sure. Just pass it along.”

“I’ll do that.” I placed the bagged items in my cart and turned to leave before hesitating. *What would Picard do?* It was a silly thought, completely irrelevant. But still, I couldn’t bring myself to do nothing.

“Maybe I’m overstepping, but if my family were still alive, I’d be with them right now.” I said. Then I shuffled out the electric doors into the parking lot and told myself it wasn’t my business.

The fresh morning air kissed my face with its chill, though the touch wasn’t invigorating. The panhandler didn’t share my disposition toward the cold. He was more aware now, and his eyes followed me as I walked out. Some hateful and bitter impulse caused me to toss the twenty into his cup. He stared at it for a moment before meeting my gaze, eyes dancing with mirth. Then he began cackling. His choked, wheezing laughter followed me across the parking lot and to the gas pump, only ending as I drove away with a full tank.

The city let me go without further incident, and the hours ticked by in a comfortable haze. As the temperature warmed, I rolled the windows down and breathed in the crisp, clean October air. The forest on either side passed in a hypnotic blur of green, orange, and brown as I made my way down the abandoned highway.

It had been years since my last joyride. Since college at least and the miles upon miles of empty road beckoned me forward like a lover, tempting me to put the pedal to the metal. I didn’t go above seventy. Laws are there for a reason, and I’m not an animal. Besides, my Toyota couldn’t handle those speeds anymore.

I followed the road, turning off at random as the whim took me and mostly obeyed the speed limit. My tank was half empty before I saw anyone else.

She was walking on the shoulder in tired tennis shoes, blue jeans and an olive blouse that neatly contrasted her pale skin and red hair.

She didn’t put her thumb up, but I slowed to a halt a few yards ahead and waited for her to catch up. “You need a ride?”

She stared at me for a moment, then nodded. “I’d appreciate it.” Her soft soprano had the same distant and exhausted quality that Cheryl’s had. That I suspected mine had. I unlocked the doors, and she got in without hesitation.

“Going anywhere specific? Nearest city is about ten miles from here, I think.”

She shook her head. “I’m just wandering. Where are you going?” She didn’t have a bag with her.

“Camping. Can’t bring myself to care where at.”

She smiled, and sunlight glinted off her white teeth. “I haven’t been camping in years.” she said.

“Would you like to come along?”

The smile fell. “I’m not sure. Would it be okay if I just rode with you for a while? I just…” Her voice trailed off.

“Need to get away?” I finished. She nodded. “I won’t mind the company. I’m John.”

“Rachel.” she replied, holding out a semi-calloused hand for me to shake. Her grip was delicate but firm.

“Pleased to meet you, Rachel.”

We rode in silence, letting the afternoon pass in a melancholy kaleidoscope of fall hues. I kept the windows rolled down. Rachel didn’t seem to mind, instead resting her arm there while she stared into nothing; lost in thought. I liked the way her curls danced when the wind ran through them.

Evening was approaching by the time the fuel light came on again. “Do you want me to drop you off somewhere?” I asked. She looked momentarily confused by the question. “I’m not looking to get rid of you, but I think we’re about to run out of gas.”

“Final call, huh?” She smiled, but it seemed weak. “I’m good, if you are.”

We drove the last few miles until at last the Toyota wheezed and died. “End of the road.” I said, pulling over and parking the car on the shoulder. Rachel unbuckled and slid out, stretching her legs to help the circulation.

I opened the back door and removed the box of camping equipment, putting the remaining jerky, trail mix, and a few bottles of water inside. With the plastic tub firmly in hand, I gestured to our surroundings. “Pick a hill.”

There were only two. The last handful of miles had led us onto a stretch of highway and into a gorge. Blue shadows clashed with orange light painting us in contrasting hues. Rachel looked around before settling on the hill facing towards the setting sun. “I hope you don’t mind a hike.” she said.

“I’m the one wearing boots.”

She looked at her feet and made a face, and I laughed. After a few seconds, her face eased into a smile and she laughed too.

My arms ached by the time we reached to top. The hike hadn’t taken long, maybe ten minutes, but the box of equipment was heavy and I was glad to be rid of it.

We settled in a small clearing on the opposite side of the hill from the road. Together, we gathered branches and twigs, dousing them in lighter fluid and setting them alight. With the first match, the flames sprung to life, dancing victoriously over the wood.

She fed the fire bits of the paper plates while I rolled out the blanket. It was a massive red scraggly thing, made of wool and polyesters. I owned more comfortable, softer, and less ragged blankets, but in my stupor I hadn’t thought to bring them.

“God, it’s been years since I’ve done this.” she said.

“Since you’ve done what? Got in a car with a stranger and joined him on his impromptu and ill advised camping trip?”

She snorted. “You are an ass, aren’t you? No, that part is new. I meant camping in general. Last time I went was probably in highschool with my dad. Pass me the trail mix?”

I tossed her the bag, grabbing a bottle of water for myself before sitting with my back to a gnarled oak. “Sorry, I didn’t bring anything else. I figured there wasn’t much need.”

“It’s fine. I didn’t think to bring anything with me when I left home this morning.” Rachel said as she moved to sit next to me. Our humble camp overlooked a valley with a river running through it. In the light, the water resembled Japanese kintsugi, holding the fractured land together.

As she sat down, she rested her head on my shoulder, and with only a moment’s hesitation, I wrapped my arm around her waist. She didn’t mind, instead scooting closer. We watched, eating our jerky and trail mix, as the sun sank behind the distant mountains and painted the sky orange and pink.

I broke our comfortable silence. “When did you know?”

She took a deep breath and let it out. “When I woke up. You?”

“The same. I almost didn’t get out of bed.”

“I couldn’t stay home. I couldn’t process, couldn’t think.”

“First thing I did after breakfast was call into work. My boss was there.”

She laughed, but it was a sad thing, born of pity. “End of the world, and you go to work. At least he’s dedicated.”

“Yeah.” I agreed. “I feel bad for him. His family too. I wonder if he wasn’t in shock. Maybe we all are.” Silence crept in as we watched the sun begin its final descent. The last it would ever have.

“You have any family?” Rachel asked.

I shook my head, not looking away from the sunset. “Mom died when I was young. Dad was never in the picture. Both of my grandparents passed a couple of years ago. You?”

“None I wanted to spend my last day with. Do you miss them?”

“Every day. As a kid, I did this a lot. Mom worked hard, but we never had much money. Camping was a cheap. At least, it was if we could borrow my grandfather’s equipment.”

“How’d she die?”

“Breast cancer. I was twelve.” We didn’t speak for another few minutes. She clearly didn’t want to discuss her family, and I had more tact than to pry. The sun fell behind the horizon, leaving only purple and blue. Even that faded, and stars peeked out, illuminating the night.

“So many stars, I wonder what will happen to them.” she mused.

“No idea.” I replied. The soft current of the wind rustled the leaves and blew the smoke of the campfire away from us. The flames danced and whirled in the breeze, bathing us in an orange glow while the logs hissed and crackled.

“Why did you pick me up?” she asked.

I considered for a few minutes before responding. “There was store manager, Cheryl. This morning she gave me the jerky and trail mix, asked me to pass it on.” I stoked the flames and added another branch. That wasn’t the real reason. “Why did you get in the car with me?”

“I didn’t want to die alone.”

“Yeah. That too.” I turned my head to the sky and watched as the last bits of sunlight surrendered to the night. The trillions of lights in the Milky Way twinkled in silent contrast. “Did you ever come to terms with this? On your walk, I mean. ”

“No. I’m not sure you can process the end of everything.” Her face hid in the shadow of her hair, but there was a wistful, amused quality to her voice. As though she thought the idea of the world ending a kind of sad joke. Maybe it was. “What about you?”

“No. Do you think it’s always been like this?” I asked.

“Like what?”

“So much time wasted. So many things left undone. And then it’s over.”

“Probably. Sad as it is. What do you wish you’d done?” she asked.

“That’s the thing. I don’t know. I guess I just want *more*.” I snorted. “It makes me sound greedy.”

“Not greedy. Just human.”

The moon rose in all its luminescent glory, and we watched as the river in the valley below morphed into a vein of liquid silver. The distant snow-covered peaks appeared crystalline in the light, and I wondered what miracle of physics could have caused such a beautiful scene.

Rachel shifted next to me, snuggling even closer. She was soft and warm. The flickering shadows cast by the flame gave her a mystic quality, and her emerald eyes sparkled as they met mine. My throat tightened, and my heartbeat thumped faster in my chest. I took a deep breath, and asked in a soft low tone, “May I kiss you?”

It was a selfish thing to ask, said as much out of fear, desperation, and loneliness as desire. She didn’t hesitate and kissed me softly. We made love with only the stars as witnesses. When we stopped, I held her close and breathed in the scent of her hair. My back scrapped against the bark as she lay on top of me, facing the sky.

One by one, the stars began vanishing into the black. “I guess that’s what happens to them.” I said into her ear.

“Guess so.”

“Do you think God exists?”

“Someone’s turning off the lights.”

I let out a hollow chuckle.

A few heartbeats later she asked, “I wonder if it was a cruelty or a kindness to let us know the end was coming.”

I didn’t know how to respond to that. It could have been either, or both. “Maybe for us it was a kindness.”

“Oh dear, you’re a romantic.”

I laughed. “It’s the first time anyone has accused me of that before.”

She turned, pressing her body against mine, looking for any comfort I might offer. “Do you think… Do you think we’ll wake up when this is over?”

‘No.’ I thought. But I didn’t say it. Her eyes were desperate, pleading. She wanted to hear the lie, but I couldn’t muster the effort. “I don’t know. I hope so.” A lump settled in my throat.

She shuddered and made a motion that wasn’t quite a nod. I felt my heart beat faster as she grabbed my hand and held it over her bare chest. I could feel her heartbeat beneath my fingers.

A tear rolled down my cheek before being caught in her hair. The stars were disappearing more quickly now, and the inky shadow webbed its way through the night sky, strangling the light it came across. Each vanished pinprick sent another chill down my spine, until I was shaking uncontrollably.

“I wish,” I fumbled over the words. “I wish we’d had a life together. That this wasn’t the last night we had. I want more.” I spoke the last words with a clenched jaw. She placed her hand on mine, fully covering her chest, and I realized how tense, how angry, I was.

“Me too,” Her voice was a calming whisper on the wind. “I wish we had more time, too. Stay with me?”

I felt my anger slip away as my muscles slowly relaxed. “Of course.” I said. “Couldn’t run if I wanted.” She relaxed into my arms as best she could and began to cry. I joined her, and we wept for the time we would never have.

The tears in our eyes briefly caused the stars to duplicate. Then we watched as the darkness choked out even that last bit of hope and the black tendrils stretched over the moon. It was horrifying, even as it was beautiful. Tears rolled in streams down my face as I began sobbing into her hair. Her body curled into mine, and I felt her tears soak my shirt. The writhing shadows devoured the moon before falling upon the crystal peaks and consuming them. We clutched each other in vain, as the shadow smothered the river, and the valley, and the light of our campfire. At last, we were left in the black. The only sound our quiet whimpers, until even that ended.

  
Here's a link to my blog. I don't do much fiction, mostly TTRPG and book reviews, but this has been in the works for awhile and I have a novella releasing next year if all goes well. Thanks for reading, and if you are interested in more let me know.
