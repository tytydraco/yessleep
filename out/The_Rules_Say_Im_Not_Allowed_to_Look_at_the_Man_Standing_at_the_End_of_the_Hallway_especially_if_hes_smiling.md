I’m typing this with my phone at 4% battery, and my thumbs won’t stop shaking. I don’t have much time before the light from this screen is the only thing I have left, and honestly, I don’t know if I want to see what happens when it goes dark. I’m posting this here because I need someone to know. If you ever find yourself in a place that feels wrong—where the silence isn't just quiet, but heavy, like it’s pressing against your eardrums—pay attention. The air here smells like a burnt circuit board, thick with ozone, and the shadows aren't staying where they belong. Living like this, under the constant weight of "The Rules," isn't living at all. It’s a slow, agonizing erosion of your mind. A simple hallway isn't just a hallway anymore; it’s a gauntlet, and every step I take feels like a gamble with my soul. It all started with that damn folder.

I found it tucked into a kitchen drawer, a plain manila folder with a single word scrawled across the tab in shaking script: Inklistrad. Inside was a single sheet of paper, typed but stained with what looked like old coffee—or maybe something darker. It looked so mundane, like a list of apartment complex regulations, but the air in the room curdled the moment I picked it up. I laughed at first. I’m not laughing now.

THE PROTOCOL

1. Do not look directly at the man standing at the end of the hallway.
2. Maintain focus on the floor or the side walls at all times when traversing the space.
3. If you feel eyes on you, do not acknowledge them.
4. MOST CRITICAL: You are never, under any circumstances, allowed to look at him if you perceive that he is smiling.

The arbitrary nature of it is the worst part. There’s no "why," no explanation of who he is or what he wants. It just establishes a hierarchy where you are the prey and the environment is the predator. The moment I finished reading Rule #4, a lightbulb in the corridor popped. In the sudden, jarring dimness, I felt a drop in temperature so sharp it made my skin crawl. I realized then that I wasn't alone.

The hallway has stretched. I know the dimensions of this house, but looking down at my feet, the carpet seems to pull away into an impossible distance, a liminal trap that defies the floor plan. He is always there, right at the edge of the shadows where the hallway meets the bathroom door. I can’t look at him—I can't—but my peripheral vision is a curse. I see a tall, jagged silhouette that seems to drink the light around it.

The physical toll of "not looking" is a torture I wasn't prepared for. My neck is constantly locked, the muscles cramped and screaming from forcing my gaze downward. My eyes burn from staring at the carpet patterns, and there is a primitive, animalistic urge to look up, to confront the threat, that I have to crush every single second. The air around him vibrates with a low-frequency static that makes my teeth ache, and I can hear his breathing—a wet, ragged sound that feels like it’s being whispered directly into my ear canal. He doesn't have to move. His stillness is a weapon. He's just waiting for my willpower to snap.

The shift happened about twenty minutes ago. I was trying to make it to the bedroom, my eyes fixed on a specific cigarette burn in the hallway runner, when the static in the air spiked until I tasted copper. In the corner of my eye, the shadow didn't just move—it unhinged.

The entire silhouette seemed to tilt into a new, sickening shape. I didn't see a face, but I saw the smile. It was a jagged fracture in the darkness, a flash of impossible, tombstone white that suggested way too many teeth. It wasn't a human expression; it was a display of predatory joy. The smell of ozone became a physical weight, a metallic sting that made my lungs seize. The smile is the catalyst. It’s the signal that he’s done watching. He’s hunting now.

And then, I slipped.

A second lightbulb shattered right above my head, and in that split-second of pure, instinctive terror, my gaze flicked upward. I didn't see him clearly, but I saw enough. I broke the primary directive, and reality simply... curdled.

\* Spatial Decay: The hallway didn't just lengthen; it warped. The floral wallpaper patterns began to stretch and twist until they looked like long, thin fingers reaching for my hair.

\* The Needle-Cold: The temperature plummeted so fast that the air turned into needles in my lungs. Every breath I take now comes out in a thick, ghostly mist.

\* The Sound of the Approach: For the first time, I heard a footstep. Not the distant sound of a house settling, but a heavy, wet thud on the carpet. Then another. He’s not at the end of the hall anymore.

By looking, I gave him permission to move. I traded the safety of distance for a moment of curiosity, and now the distance is gone.

I’m in my bedroom now, leaning my back against the door, but it’s a joke. I can feel the wood vibrating. There’s no doorknob turning—not yet—just the weight of something immense and cold leaning back against me from the other side.

The rules weren't there to help me understand. They were there to keep the truth out. Curiosity in this place isn't a virtue; it’s a death sentence, and I just signed mine. I can hear the wood of the door frame beginning to groan.

I’m telling you this because you need to understand: if you’re reading this and you notice your hallway looks a little longer than it did five minutes ago, or if you smell ozone and hear a wet, ragged breath behind you—do not look up.

The man is smiling. And I don’t have to look to know he’s standing right behind me. Though, i’ll be fine. As long as i dont look at him. Even though he’s laughing in my neck.
