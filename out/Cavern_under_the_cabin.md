The Shadow Beneath the Lake

Deep in the forests of Maine, hidden from the eyes of civilization, lay a lake known only to locals as Blackwater Hollow. The lake was a place of whispered stories and dire warnings, a place where fishermen refused to cast their lines and where the bravest of children dared not swim. Its surface was black as pitch, even under the summer sun, and no matter how hard the wind blew, it remained still, like a vast mirror reflecting the emptiness of the sky.

It was on the edge of this lake that a young woman named Evelyn came to escape the chaos of her life. After the sudden loss of her husband, she sought solace in the isolation of a cabin her grandparents had left her. She arrived late in the autumn, the trees a tangle of bare branches clawing at a leaden sky. The cabin was small, modest, and surrounded by an oppressive quiet that made her footsteps echo louder than they should have.

Evelyn was warned by the clerk at the general store to stay away from the lake.

“Nothing good comes out of Blackwater Hollow,” he muttered, sliding her bag of groceries across the counter.

Evelyn smiled politely but didn’t respond. She wasn’t one to believe in superstitions. Besides, the lake was beautiful in its eerie way—a stark, unbroken void amidst the dense forest. She thought it might help her find the peace she desperately needed.

That first night, Evelyn sat by the fireplace, sipping tea and listening to the wind howl through the trees. She had nearly fallen asleep when she heard it: a faint knock at the door.

Her heart quickened. She hadn’t seen another soul since arriving, and the cabin was miles from the nearest house. Clutching her robe around her, she approached the door and opened it a crack.

No one was there.

The cold night air seeped in, carrying with it the scent of pine and something faintly metallic. She stepped out onto the porch, scanning the dark woods, but there was only silence. Shivering, she went back inside and bolted the door.

As she turned away, she thought she saw movement through the window—a ripple across the surface of the lake, though the wind had stilled. Evelyn froze, staring into the blackness, but whatever she thought she saw was gone.

Over the next few days, Evelyn felt the lake’s presence in a way she couldn’t explain. At night, she dreamed of its depths—vast, unending, and filled with shadowy forms that moved too quickly to discern. During the day, she found herself drawn to its edge, where the silence seemed heavier, as though the world were holding its breath.

One morning, she decided to walk the perimeter of the lake. The forest was dense, and the air was thick with the smell of damp earth. As she walked, she noticed strange markings carved into the trees—symbols she didn’t recognize. They were crude, almost primitive, and as she ran her fingers over one, she felt a sudden jolt, like static electricity.

The sensation left her uneasy, but she pressed on. About halfway around the lake, she stumbled upon a small clearing where the ground was covered in bones. Some were animal, others disturbingly human-like. She backed away, her breath quickening, and hurried back to the cabin.

That night, the knocking returned.

Evelyn didn’t answer the door this time. She stayed by the window, peering out into the darkness. The knocking grew louder, more insistent, until it seemed to echo through the entire cabin. And then it stopped.

She stayed awake until dawn, clutching a kitchen knife and jumping at every creak of the cabin’s old timbers. When morning came, she found muddy footprints on the porch—bare, human footprints leading away toward the lake.

Over the next few days, Evelyn’s sanity began to unravel. She heard whispers in the wind, her name carried faintly through the trees. Shadows moved at the edges of her vision, and the lake seemed to pulse, its surface rippling in ways that defied the stillness of the air.

On the fifth night, she was awoken by a sound she couldn’t ignore—a low, resonant hum that seemed to come from beneath the cabin. She grabbed her flashlight and followed the noise to the cellar. The air grew colder as she descended the wooden stairs, and the hum grew louder, more alive.

In the center of the cellar floor was a trapdoor she had never noticed before. It was ancient, its wood rotting and etched with the same symbols she had seen in the forest. Against every instinct, she opened it.

Beneath the trapdoor was a tunnel, the walls slick with moisture and pulsing faintly, as if alive. Evelyn climbed down, the hum now a deafening roar that vibrated through her bones.

The tunnel led to a cavern that opened out beneath the lake. The water above was translucent, a shifting veil that separated her from the surface. In the center of the cavern stood a stone altar, and on it was a figure—human-like but wrong. Its limbs were too long, its face too smooth, and its eyes were empty voids that seemed to pull the light from the room.

The figure turned to her, its mouth stretching into a grotesque approximation of a smile.

“Welcome,” it said, its voice a guttural echo that filled the cavern. “We have been waiting.”

The next morning, the cabin was empty. Evelyn was gone, her belongings left behind as though she had simply vanished. The locals whispered about Blackwater Hollow, about the warnings she had ignored, and about the lake that always seemed just a little darker, a little deeper, than it had been before.

But no one dared to go near it. Not anymore.
