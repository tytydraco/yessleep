TW- Self Harm, Substance abuse

I'm what is known as a pain junkie. Ever since I was a boy, every feeling was dull and muted. Bleeding  didn't make me cry, it was just an irritation, like an itch.

As I got older, the dullness intensified, and I felt an urge to feel something.

Feel something more.

I found out about a community of people just like me. We did crazy things hoping to get hurt. Needles and blades and other things I won't get into. Real hellraiser type crap

Then one day one of my friends came to me shivering with a smile on his face. 

"Yo, you gotta try some of this shit."

It was a syringe filled with some kind of liquid. 

"It makes you really feel shit. Hits hard."

I took it from him but wasn't planning on using it, because I wasn't one to use drugs to supplement my experiences.

But then after a few months even the stuff I used to find extreme was boring again. They didn't excite me anymore.

Then I remembered the syringe. I found it at the bottom of some drawer and jabbed it into my arm before one of my "sessions".

The first time it hit, it washed over me. Every thing I did had its feeling magnified tenfold. The effect lasted an hour, and I collapsed face first into a pillow, soaked in sweat and some of my own blood.

The next day, I woke up and went to the friends house to ask if he had more. 

He didn't answer his door so I picked the lock and found him on the floor, eyes shut, and shuddering on the floor. 

I poked him and then the screaming started.

It was a screech like I was ripping his damn heart out his body. 

He rolled once and then tried to stumble to his feet, only to collapse with another agonised moan. 

"Knife" He said 

I asked him if he had more of that stuff he gave me.

"Knife"

Every time I spoke it was like I shoved a dagger in him or something and he just kept saying knife.

I brought one to him and then summoning some of his last stamina, he threw himself onto the blade, and without opening his mouth, he just fell and bled to death. 

My first instinct was to run the hell out, but before that I saw a few more vials of the stuff on the table.

I grabbed it and ran, before leaving town and going into a motel to try it out.

I got hooked to the feeling. It made everything feel so much more potent. I started taking one twice a day, and before I knew it, they were all finished. 

I hates that. Every time I use it became stronger. Then man knock on door. Say he make them. Said they get better every use. He gave me them.

I started using more. More potent. Then normal thing start hurting. Effect more permanent
