Red and white, with a large lamp rotating at the top, illuminating the path for boats.

I always admired that lighthouse; I felt like I needed something to light up and guide my own path too. I was always a bit lost. When I was younger, my father would sometimes take me with him to the lighthouse. We would bring supplies—fish, meat, salt, milk. I would wait in the truck while my father talked to the lighthouse keeper. A short conversation, never more than thirty minutes.

I never asked why we brought supplies. My father worked at a sawmill near our house. We weren’t a store. Well, I also never asked what they talked about while I was inside the car. It never really mattered to me, only the fact that there was always a new lighthouse keeper.

Not every time we went, of course. But they definitely changed frequently. I don’t think I remember any of them staying for more than six months. Their appearances were similar—always men, old, and with a worn-out look. That, I did ask my father about.

— Why do they change so often, Dad? The lighthouse keepers.

— Well, son. Have you ever thought about living in a lighthouse? Giant waves crashing all night long, living up there? Doesn’t it scare you? Maybe the lighthouse keepers just don’t get used to it...

At least, that’s what I remember from our brief conversation. Since I didn’t really care, that answer satisfied me, and I didn’t question him further. But that night—well, I don’t know if it was exactly the same night, but before going to bed at my usual time—I had a thought: what scared the lighthouse keepers so much? Was what my father said really enough to scare adults?

That night, before sleeping, I imagined what could scare adults. I thought of many things—mermaids, pirates, the Kraken, and other sea monsters... Until something else came to my mind. The sea. Yes, the sea.

I remembered a time when we traveled to my aunt Margarida’s house, my mother’s sister. She lived in a house facing the sea, and since it was the end of the year, we went down to the beach to watch the fireworks from the other side of the shore. When midnight struck, everything was so dark on the beach, only the moonlight shining. At twelve-oh-one, the sky lit up, and we watched the fireworks display. They were beautiful.

But when the colors of the fireworks faded, and everyone was celebrating and popping champagne, I was staring at the sea. The sea, which always seemed pleasant and beautiful during the day, was now dark, infinite. It swallowed me, almost as if it drowned me without me even being in it. I felt so small and insignificant before that particular sea (even though it was the same sea as always) that the sensation of being consumed haunted me every time I remembered.

Well, when I recalled that, it occurred to me that maybe that was what scared the lighthouse keepers—that feeling of powerlessness. I really didn’t want to think about it anymore, so I turned off my bedside lamp and took a while before finally falling asleep that night.

A year later, I was now in seventh grade. My father had been fired from the sawmill and no longer delivered supplies as often. My life remained normal; even though my father had lost his job, my mother had a well-paying one, enough to support us. Well, that didn’t please my father much, who was quickly looking for a new job. Other than that, my days went on as usual. Until the argument.

Two weeks after my birthday, my parents were very impatient with each other. And I knew why. The lighthouse.

At dawn, I think it was around five forty in the morning, I woke up to an argument. It was my parents, but the one who seemed angrier was my mother. I slowly went down the stairs so they wouldn’t hear me and listened to part of their fight.

— You’re still spending money on this, Jhonatan!

— Rosa, you know I have my reasons!

— Do I? Because it doesn’t seem like it! You just disappear and go to that damn lighthouse...

— love...

— Before, I let it slide, but now… Things aren’t easy, Jhonatan… Ben is growing up, and you and this damn town seem more different every day...

After that, things calmed down a bit, and I went back up to my room. After that argument, my father started avoiding taking supplies when my mother was home. I didn’t understand why he kept bringing things to the lighthouse. One time, I asked him about it—he gave me an angry look and didn’t answer. I didn’t ask again.

The days went by, and my father kept taking supplies to the lighthouse. Still unemployed, apparently, the town was changing, and finding a job was getting harder. Before, I didn’t notice, but now it was clear that the nights lasted longer and the cloudy skies were more constant. On my way to school, I noticed the animals were more restless, and vines were taking over buildings, almost as if nature was enraged, reclaiming what was hers.

Things in town were strange, as if something was affecting people and animals—it was all so... eccentric. One day, my biology teacher said we needed to buy boats and inflatable vests because of the rising sea levels. Well, things were weird, but if it had stopped there...

On a Wednesday when school was canceled because a driver had crashed a bus into the building at dawn, I saw my father heading to the truck. I saw the box in his hands and immediately knew where he was going. It was seven in the morning, my mother had just left for work, yet the sky was caught in the twilight between day and night.

I grabbed my jacket and ran to the car, asking if I could come along. He didn’t agree, but he didn’t refuse either. He just stood there, staring at the windshield. So I got in and sat in the back seat. There we were, as always, heading to the lighthouse together. But now, it felt different...

I realized it had been a while since my father and I talked as much as before. And I wasn’t as excited to get to the lighthouse and see if another keeper had taken over.

The road to the lighthouse—a familiar path. It had been part of my routine (or at least it was until a few months ago when I stopped going with my father). But this road was different. It felt different, yet somehow the same.

Then I noticed—the grass had overtaken the sandy soil of the old road, the sky was dark, almost like night. I looked back—it was as if night ended in the town and began at the lighthouse. Unimaginable. And there, at the end of the path, I saw the lighthouse, lit. Its light spinning. That sight filled me with terror.

I looked at my father, shocked—the landscape around us sent chills down my spine. He didn’t react, but he seemed aware of the difference. It even felt like he had sped up, continuing toward the lighthouse. What could I do? Jump out of a moving car? Sure, we weren’t going that fast, but it would still be unpleasant. And besides, I was with my father. Where would I be safer?

But I can’t lie—I was terrified.

We arrived at the lighthouse. Everything was dark, like night, only the lighthouse's beam illuminating us. My father got out of the truck, grabbed the supply box from the passenger seat, and walked to the lighthouse entrance. Minutes passed—he stood still.

Then, in the midst of that horrific scene, I did something I had never done before. I got out of the car.

I stepped out, the trees swayed in the intense wind, and the salty scent of the sea filled my nostrils. My legs trembled as I walked toward my father. When I reached him, he moved. He put the box down and started walking toward the edge of the cliff, as if he had been waiting for me.

I followed him slowly, looking around at the eerie landscape.

My father walked to the edge of the cliff and waited for me, looking back, waiting.

At that moment, I was terrified of my own father.

But I kept going.

Now, standing beside him, I looked at his face. He looked back at me, then gazed forward again. His face seemed tired. Then, he pointed to the sea, staring at it. I couldn’t ignore it, so I looked where he was pointing.

I looked at the sea.

And at that moment, it looked exactly like the sea I had seen at Aunt Margarida’s house. Exactly the same.

The same dark, endless sea.

A sea that even the lighthouse’s beam could not penetrate.

And as I stared at my old enemy, that feeling returned.

I was swallowed by fear.
