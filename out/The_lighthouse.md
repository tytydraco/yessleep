I had known Hugh since childhood, but by this time I hadn’t seen him for several years. You know how it goes—by the time you reach the ninth grade, you promise to be best friends forever, then you go out three times to the pub during high school, and that’s the end of it. But Hugh probably didn’t want it to end that way, and so a few months ago, a letter arrived in my mailbox.

"Dear Denis,

I haven’t seen you in a long time. If you ever want to come see me at the lighthouse, wait for me at Miami Harbor, dock number 608, any even Wednesday at dawn. Or you can make your way here on foot; it’s about thirty miles east of South Beach, though I would strongly advise against it. Hopefully, we’ll see each other soon.

Hugh Colins"

It struck me as strange how he assumed it was obvious that he lived in a lighthouse. One part of me thought the trip was a ridiculous waste of time, while another kept reminding me that there was nothing to do at home anyway. At that time, I was mostly living off my father’s inheritance and the small jobs people occasionally offered me. After my father’s death, I was, on one hand, financially secure, and on the other, bored out of my mind because, although taking care of him had been a real drag, at least it kept me busy enough not to notice the emptiness of my life.

In the end, I realized that I had nothing else to do, so I decided to go. That very day, I went to the Greyhound Lines office and booked a ticket for the next bus to Miami. I packed a small bag, and the next morning, I patiently waited at Port Authority bus terminal until a shabby-looking vessel, which the driver called "Baby," arrived.

When I was young, my parents would punish me by making me kneel on a spoon, and despite that, I can honestly say the hours spent in that bus were the longest I’ve ever experienced. By early Wednesday morning, I arrived in Miami and immediately hurried to the harbor. At dock number 608, a man in shorts, a sailor’s shirt, and a cap was standing. He had short hair and scruffy facial hair.

"Denis, is that you?" he asked. "I’m so glad to see you, old buddy," he smiled and shook my hand warmly. It had been about ten years since I last saw him, but he looked like he had aged about twenty-five years. On our way to the market to buy supplies, we chatted about life and how much everything had changed. I was really curious how someone ends up as a lighthouse keeper.

"It’s simple, my friend. You carefully watch the classifieds in the newspapers. And when they don’t have any ads, you look for articles like ‘Desperate keeper committed suicide by jumping off the lighthouse.’ That usually means they have a job opening. This is the third lighthouse I’ve worked at. The previous two stopped functioning. Nowadays, everything’s transported by airplane, and the lighthouse keepers don’t have much to eat," he sighed, but then laughed again. It turned out that he hadn’t really changed much since I last saw him, around the end of high school.

After a pleasant lunch and the obligatory visit to the liquor store on Twenty-Second Street, we boarded a small boat and embarked on a two-hour journey to the lighthouse. On the island, the warm wind blew, and the sky was a deep azure. It kind of reminded me of the planet of the Little Prince because from one end, where the dock was, you could see all the way to the other end, where a sharp rocky outcrop stood.

"Hey, Hugh, what’s that over there?"  
"That’s a cave. I used to go swimming there, but a few months ago, some stones fell from the ceiling, and now it’s a bit dangerous because of the waves."

I assumed Hugh spoke from experience, because when I asked, a nervous look appeared in his eyes.

It was beginning to get dark, so we started a fire and threw a few steaks on the grill. And since God doesn’t look after us after dark, we had to open the bottle of Wild Turkey we had bought earlier—the whiskey Hugh liked. Maybe it was the fire, or perhaps just the atmosphere, but that steak, straight off the grill, was the best piece of meat that had ever touched my lips.

"Aren’t you ever afraid to be out here? I heard there are some treacherous waves or something, that ships sink and planes crash and so on," I asked as the moon rose directly above us and we moved inside because it was time to signal the Cuban steamer that we were where we were supposed to be.

"Afraid to sail? I’d have to be a real coward to be afraid of these little waves," he replied, gesturing toward the sea, where the reflection of the moon and stars shimmered on the water.  
"But the night here on the island can be eerily quiet, you know. Especially since I’ve been alone here."

"Has anyone been with you? Didn’t something happen, like the thing you told me about from the newspaper?" At that moment, I regretted asking anything. I had driven my host into a very uncomfortable conversation.  
"I didn’t mention it?" He paused. "I used to have a dog named Ronnie and a wife, Isla. One day, Ronnie wandered off somewhere, and Isla..." He stopped again, and it seemed like he was fighting back tears. "Isla got some sort of disease here and died almost overnight. The whole family blames me. I should’ve taken her away from here. I basically killed her." Hugh’s head dropped into his hands, and I didn’t know what to say.

Suddenly, we were interrupted by the sound of crying. At first, I thought it was Hugh, but then he lifted his head and showed no signs of sobbing or sniffing. "What’s that, Hugh?" I asked, though I briefly wondered if it was a product of my tipsy mind. "The Grey Lady. That’s what the locals call her. They say she was a woman who shipwrecked here years ago and died of hunger, and she still cries to this day. The truth, and the scientists have confirmed it, is that it’s some sound the waves make, shifting through the peculiar arch of that cave."

That piqued my curiosity, and I really wanted to go see the cave. Hugh looked at me again with a nervous smile. "If the conditions are good tomorrow morning, I could show you."

  
I tried to get more local ghost stories out of him in the hope that we might at least leave the "dead wife" subject for another night. He told me, he knew  none, except for a tale about a pirate’s ghost from Brickleberry. "Bummer. Want a drink?" I asked. He agreed, and we had a drink. Then, I probably fell asleep; it was already well past two in the morning.

The sound of crying woke me up again. I chuckled under my breath at the story of the Grey Lady and then decided I might as well take a trip to the latrine while I was awake. I opened my eyes and noticed that Hugh was sitting at the end of the bed, his head in his hands again. I was about to say something, to reassure him it wouldn’t be that bad, but somehow, I couldn’t move. God, I was tied up.

Hugh turned toward me, and I noticed the knife in his left hand. He began to scream. It became clear that Hugh wasn’t just a nice guy but also possibly a cannibal. He covered my mouth. "You don’t understand. She’s hungry. She would take me. I can’t go to hell without a fight. Not after what I did. I had to."

He repeated the last sentence over and over as I felt a sharp pain and warm blood somewhere in my stomach. My eyes closed, and I knew the game was over.

The last words I heard were, "It wasn’t your fault. She’s to blame. That monster, that monster." And at the very end, something clicked for me. I didn’t resist. He was right.

He had to.
