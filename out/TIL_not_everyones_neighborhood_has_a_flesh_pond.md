Hey everyone! My family and I just moved, and I figured this might be the right place to ask a few questions my parents, my dad especially, won’t answer. 

I think he honestly feels a little guilty about the whole move. I mean, the  reason we had to move in the first place is because he got in a big fight with the ‘Leader.’ Ok, I might be a little at fault too. I guess I did put the bundle of Marigolds on the altar to try to make the ‘Clandestine’ come out sooner than usual, but that was only because I was not trying to take Ms. Peabody’s midterm. My boyfriend Skylar’s new eye had just grown in, and you know we wanted to give that thing a test drive.

Anyway, I could’ve just taken the lashes and sacrificed some of my essence, but Dad wanted to make it a whole thing. When my brother Brett got caught making desultory souls battle for him and his friend’s little fight club, Dad was eager to dole out the punishments himself. A part of me thinks he had some grandiose vision of fomenting a coup and taking over the leadership role himself. He’d be the first in the family since great-grandpa.

I bet he wishes it were still hereditary, but it's foolish to think rules stay the same after a millennium. Anyway, his little shouting match only got me and my family banished. Took about a week for us to find suitable bodies. Mine is rather snug, especially around the chest. If that area grows any more, I pray there is some sort of molting process or something. We moved to a little suburb in a region called “Texas.” 

It’s been ok so far. A little hot and humid, but not nearly as bad as when we would go and visit grandpa in the retirement reservation. A lot of people have these rat-looking creatures that walk around on ropes. They are so cute! A part of me wonders how tasty they’d be if we let Brett grill them over a fire. My little brother annoys me to no end, but man, can that boy grill. 

I’m adjusting well enough at ‘school.’ The girl I replaced had just finished her 16th rotation around this planet’s sun, meaning when I took her place, I was called a 'junior.' Luckily, it seems that the term isn’t literal, as I have never felt inferior to any of the so-called 'seniors' who walk around. 

One of the Seniors, Aaron, seemed to have been engaged in a relationship with my skin of some sort, as he had cornered me and demanded an apology and a kiss on my third day.

“I don’t know why you seem to be avoiding me, Becca! I told you, she came on to me, it wasn’t my fault, Abby has a thing for me.” He was distressed, he smelled guilty, and his elevated heart rate indicated an aversion to the truth.

“Who are you?” I said a little louder than him, still adjusting to the voice noise. 

He rolled his eyes and snorted, two things I wasn’t aware our bodies were capable of. “Becca, don’t be a bitch!” He spat out in disgust as I searched Becca’s memories to identify the boy in front of me. 

“Aaron,” I had found his identity, “are you seeking an apology?” 

Aaron looked up at me with big eyes. “I won’t hurt you again, baby, please!” His vitals indicated another lie as he approached me, eyes closed, mouth a gap with his tongue hanging out. As he latched onto me in a position I have now learned is referred to as a ‘kiss,’ I found it easy to siphon off his essence.

Aaron must not have been the most capable of people because there was very little essence to take. A 'wide' receiver on the football team, although to me he seemed very fit and skinny, Aaron walked around the rest of his days rather listlessly, not much of a deviation from his past self. 

Brett was doing a little better at adjusting to our new community. Well, his true name was Orion, but his new skin had referred to himself as Brett, so we all figured it would be easier to adapt these new personas to avoid confusion. His body had completed seven fewer rotations than mine, putting him around the age of 9. He was the biggest in his third-grade class and had gained a lot of friends playing ‘basketball’ a game where you throw a sphere into a hoop. My dad scolded Brett when he helped himself to the class guinea pig when no one was looking, and only barely avoided the wrath of the teacher when she thought she had accidentally let the 'pet' out of the cage and swiftly replaced it the next day.

I always wondered what punishments were like here as opposed to our old home. How big was the teacher’s rod? How long did they hang the guilty party upside down? I did witness a fight in the school cafeteria where several food particles were thrown, but instead of a public humiliation, it seemed those kids just missed a few days of school. Perhaps throwing food is some sort of celebration, and those kids were simply being rewarded. 

I had told my parents that I too would take part in these festivities and maybe be rewarded, but my mom told me it's best to keep our presence rather unnoticed. I don’t think my mom was very happy about my dad’s outburst towards the 'Leader.' She was much quieter than she used to be and was taking the 'stay-at-home' moniker her past body had adopted quite literally. I don’t think she has left the house since we started living here three months ago. 

Dad seems to have been the luckiest out of all of us. His body’s previous owner, ‘Big John’ owned two different car dealerships. Dad had absorbed all the books and manuals he could find on cars and had told his workers to stay the course. 

When we had figured out how to finally operate the 'television' and finally confirmed the moving pictures were not only not really there but that they posed no threat, it was always a great laugh when we would see 'Big John' pop up and try to sell us a truck in a big, wide cowboy hat.

School sent Brett and me home for a few days to celebrate 'Thanksgiving' when I first noticed it. A few of the trees that had always been green around our neighborhood had slowly started shifting color to red and orange. At first, I thought my eyes may have been playing a trick. Ever since learning about 'optical illusions' in my psychology elective, I have been on guard for their tricks. 

After two days of continuous color, that’s when I started to panic. We were all sitting around the dining room table sucking out the essence of a few rotisserie chickens’ dad and bought from the supermarket when I blurted out my fear.

“Have you seen the trees? Red and Orange!” I looked over at Brett, his finger placed deep in a chicken, a look of satisfaction painted on his face. He wasn’t around when ‘Bedlam’ raided our old home. My parents did their best to shield me, but I remember everything turning a hue of red and orange when he came.

My mom scowled, shooting me a look of disgust. “Why do you ask, Becca?” She looked over at my dad, who nodded in approval before also pointing a dirty look my way.

“Back home, when things turned red, and orange-”

“We are not back home anymore, Becca!” Dad raised his voice. After three months, he had mastered the booming inflections of ‘Big John’. “Our home is here in Texas, sweetie. The trees are fine.”

Brett looked at all of us in confusion. “What’s wrong with the trees?”

“Nothing, honey,” Mom replied. “Your sister is just responding poorly to her surroundings, is all.” 

“Mom!” I raised my voice. “This is just like ‘Bedlam’ and there is no Lead-”

“Becca, enough!” Dad yelled. “There is no ‘Bedlam’ here. And I will not have you mention-,” Dad gulped, his face barely containing his rage towards the old ‘Leader’, “HIM, in my house. Now, if you are going to continue being a problem, you can finish your chicken in your room.” He smiled before nodding up towards the stairs.

I smirked before picking up my plate, placing my entire hand on the chicken breast, sucking every last bit of essence into my skin, and stomping up the stairs, depositing the used carcass on the floor. 

I’d have to solve the problem on my own. When ‘Belam’ arrived when I was younger, I knew the Leader had been forced to give up our entire flesh pond to him to bribe him to go away. This new community was large; I’m sure their flesh pond would be more than sufficient for Bedlam this time. I have finally started to master the internet and figured I could just Google where the flesh pond was around here and drive over there before school. 

That’s when the results came up empty. Only one girl who had been friends with Becca before I occupied her body had remained friends with me up to this point, Heather. The next day, I asked her where our community kept its flesh pond. 

“The what?” She looked at me with awe. “You mean like the pond and creek?” 

“No, not with water, you know, with flesh.” 

“Becca, you always crack me up. I’ll see you at lunch.”

So I turn to you guys. Do you know where most neighborhoods keep their flesh pond? If we need more flesh, there are a few girls I would love to add from school, but I just really don’t know where to start. 

I don’t know how much you guys have dealt with ‘Bedlam’ in the past, but I am terrified, and my parents don’t seem to be taking the threat as seriously as me!
