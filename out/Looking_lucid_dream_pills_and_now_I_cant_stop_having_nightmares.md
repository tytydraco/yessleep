I bought these Lucid dream enhancing pills for fun and giggles and realized that their not that fun at all. Start off I’m 6’6 240 pounds a big guy and never really had a “lucid dream” I thought that was more of a spiritual thing people have. I took these pills double the amount  and for the first two weeks nothing at all so I went to get a refund but realized it was non refundable lol. I stopped taking the pills but Then two days later I started having these dreams , nothing crazy at first but to me it was something different, so I took them again. Fast forward these pills eventually started to work. I don’t remember the last 3 nights but they all been terrifying to the point I’m like do I need a pastor.  But today at 6am I just had the worst one.

It started like this. 
I’m at the gas station no reason at all showing off my old school challenger to some people by the gas pump. I went inside and met 3 people who were extremely cool 2 girls and this guy. We chatted for a minute and talked about music and festivals. The guy in the group , let’s call him chad, Chad had a bike out side and wanted me to try it with him for shits and giggles and I did. I got on ,then he got on the back bar and we took off to do a circle around the building just being boys lol. I take off and notice this guy in front of us. To dodge him I go to the left and soon as I do a car pulls up up to the side I am going on and that random guy pulls out a gun and shoots at the car. I slide to the bike to dodge the crossfire and run for my life in the other direction . I see chad runs into the gas station and I follow. We told the girls what happen and while telling the story the shooter comes in , he looks at us, buys a snack and says what are the points of guns if you not going use them and leaves.   We just starred at each other and 10 minutes later we was on a different topic. Dreams be skipping around randomly but then later on the dream

This the creepy part- part 2
After that experience I felt close with chad as a new bro, we almost died together and I felt we both like the same things cars, parties whatever….Chad recently had a grandfather died and the funeral was that day and he asked me to come, I said okay. Dream skipped to the park where I pulled up to the funeral which was in front of the house outside in the middle of nowhere. I get out my car and park, which was about 1000 feet from the ceremony in front of the house. I see chad and the two girls. We all hugged and what not . I sat next to chad cousins and brothers. This is the weird part, nobody is talking to me chad didn’t introduce me to his cousins that are sitting next to me, there’s like 8 of them. The girls are acting like I don’t exist. The guy cousins have formed a little group and we’re talking chatting but it didn’t sound like English. One guy cousins is doing most of the talking when he randomly stops and  but when he looks at me he just stares and grins…. I look away…The ceremony starts. Here’s an idea of the layout …We are sitting in the front lawn under this big willow tree. There are about 300 people sitting on white chairs. 1200 feet in front of us there is the main road where I can see my car .  Back to the ceremony.

I’m sitting bothered still that chad hasn’t said anything to me after I sat down and hasn’t introduced me and the girls were in front of me and never once looked back to say anything. It got quiet, very quiet, the pastor is started talking. Everyone looked at him with intense stares. He reads and preaches. While he’s preaching I’m zoning in my head and started looking around and eventually got to the willow tree. I follow the branches with my eyes and came across a doll without a head, I turned to tell chad and realized he was starring right at me with this face and says pay attention to the pastor. I did. The pastor started preaching again and I went back to the tree. I continue to gazed the tree and I notice these legs hanging .  I look up and there are people hanging by their neck but their heads are fully twisted so the neck has bones stick out from fractures ..I freak out and I turn back to Chad and notice everyone starring at me. The pastor continues talking and everyone heads goes in a 360 bones started popping out and bloods squirting everywhere. I bolted for my car. I look behind me and at this point they have all have gotten up and we’re chasing me. I run towards the high way and realized they are very fast and grabbing my arms to stop me , wrapping flesh off my arms and then I got woken up my by my girl sweating . And realized 7 hours has gone by. Yeeep there was more details but that was so intense in my dream it seems like I am dying. Hopefully they stop


There dreams are getting worst and worst . I don’t like it at all. Lol not taking anymore pills
