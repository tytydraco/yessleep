Most people say that time heals all wounds– but that’s bullshit. From my experience time can be the knife that makes those wounds. Time is more than a clock on a wall; time is the *tick tick tick* that twists our stomachs, reminding us just how short life is.

Worst of all, time doesn’t give a shit who you are. You can’t go back, and you can’t change anything. Maybe I’m a cynic, but I’ve learned that what most people say is bullshit. In fact, most things we are taught and believe are simply bullshit.

Knowing what I know now, I would have done things differently. Like most moms, I was burnt out, and I fantasized about time alone without my kids or husband. It makes me sick now just thinking about how much I wanted to get away from them. While I always loved my family, I used to feel so suffocated. I had no idea that the thing that suffocated me would be the only thing that would eventually keep me alive.

For context, my husband and I had 3 beautiful children together. We got together when we were teenagers and what went from two kids just exploring and experimenting turned into us growing up faster than we expected. I became pregnant our senior year of high school. We didn't get married right away, instead I took time off of school to raise the baby while Scott went to college. I never felt insecure about missing out on "the college experience". I knew I was smart (and I tended to have more "street smarts" than my husband). Plus, he was a hard worker and provided for us and our son, Peter. After we were married, we ended up having 2 more kids: Abby and Beaux. Abby was born when Peter was 7, and Beaux followed 3 years after her. It wasn't until our kids were older that I began to feel the twinge of resentment. I had spent the last 16 years of my life living for others, and all I wanted was freedom. My home had become like a prison. If only I knew what that word truly meant.

Looking back on that fateful day, I wish I could change everything I had said and done. I wish I could go back and hold my kids in my arms and never let go... How could I have known that it would be 9 years until I would see them again? I wish I had an answer for what happened to me almost a decade ago, but despite my sleepless nights and obsessive search for a reason, all I have are memories of events so unbelievable that I’m left with the horrifying reality: there doesn’t need to be a reason for anything because the scariest answer to anything is *no answer at all*.

9 years ago when my nightmare started, I had been in the middle of chores and griping at one of my kids for making a mess when I heard the doorbell ring. Sadie, my oversized German Shepherd, was frantically barking at the door. She growled and blocked me from opening it. In hindsight, I should have trusted her instinct, but I was so distracted with getting back to whatever I was doing, I just called my oldest son to take her so I could figure out who was there.

When I opened the door, I saw two clean cut men dressed in the local police uniforms. I felt on edge upon seeing policemen. I had always had anxiety when it came to getting in trouble with the law. There was no reason in particular; it was simply the natural fear of doing something wrong.



“Hi, I’m sorry, can you give me a minute to put my dog up?” I asked nervously.



Both men assured me that it was fine but to be quick. That response made me more uneasy. I kick myself thinking about how stupid I was.



I told my oldest son to go watch his brother and sister in the other room and I would be right back. 



“What’s going on, mom?” Peter asked. 



I shrugged, “I don’t know, but it’s two cops and they don’t seem happy. Just watch your siblings and I’ll be back.” I assumed they had a complaint about a dog or noise. We had two other yapping dogs that liked to run around in the backyard and one of them had a knack for escaping. It wouldn’t have been the first time we had a noise complaint about them. 



Once I got the kids settled, I went back to the door and stepped outside. As I was shutting the door, I began apologizing for my dogs but was quickly cut off when my vision went black. 



I felt my entire body get yanked and hoisted up so quickly it felt like I would get whiplash. They had put a bag over my head. It was a dark material that felt like burlap as it scratched my face. One of the men, I assume the one with the bag, grabbed my arms from behind and pulled them back while the other grabbed my legs so fast I fell on the man behind me. I could feel his chest heaving and heard his breath while they ran with me in their arms. 



I used to watch true crime shows and movies thinking “*Why didn’t she scream? Why didn’t she fight?”* I look back on my ignorance with the last bit of self pity that I have. I couldn’t think, so all my brain could muster was a small cry and a confused gasp. 



What followed is now a blur, but when I sleep I relive those moments over like a clip on repeat. The feeling of my head hitting the door, my legs falling off of the seat and the frantic voices of the men telling each other to “be cool”. I like to think that they were criminal masterminds who had chloroformed that sack over my head, and that was the reason for my confusion. However, knowing what I know now, that’s not true. They weren’t criminal masterminds, and I wasn’t drugged. I had never truly experienced real fear, and my brain decided it was too much to remember. 



Halfway through the car ride I stopped disassociating and tried desperately to move. I realized that during the struggle, one of the men had put handcuffs on me. I could move my legs, and I tried to sit up to shake the bag off of my head. Even though the bag wasn’t tightened around my neck, it was impossible to shake off. The car ride became bumpy and felt off-road, and without the use of my arms, I flailed around in the back seat praying for smooth terrain. I felt hopeless and closed my eyes, praying that whatever nightmare I was experiencing would end.



After what felt like an eternity in darkness I once again felt the jolt of being grabbed. The men pulled me out of the car and walked me through what felt like wet grass and rocks. I tried to focus my mind on what I could hear and feel. The walk was so fast I didn't have time to analyze what was around me. The sound of the cicadas screamed in my ears as I concentrated on what sounded like water. 



Suddenly I was pulled back. I heard a sharp creak like old hinges, and I felt the cool rush of air conditioning. The man holding me gently pushed me through the threshold, and I felt the jarring smoothness of concrete. The door behind me closed with a slam and I stood shaking while one of the men fumbled with the handcuffs. I felt a small whimper escape my lips as a hand gently touched my arm like a soft apology. I didn’t understand the compassion from my captors, but nothing made sense. The bag was finally removed giving me the satisfaction of a cool air while a hand moved my hair from my eyes. The room was dimly lit and resembled a large garage, big enough to fit more than one car. Additionally the air was pungent with the smell of gasoline and sweat. The room was lit by a single bulb that hung on the ceiling and every wall and door with a window was painted over with black paint. 



Once the men had fully freed me, they left without a word. It was nothing like in the movies; they didn’t ask for anything or make demands of me, they simply took me and left me. I had been imagining in my mind how I would survive an assault, I worried that they would cut me, hit me, or worse. They did nothing more than take me. They took me and left me in this room without a word. The confusion was dizzying, and I felt the world around me begin to spin. In my delirium I heard a faint “hello” and watched as a shadowy figure walked towards me. As she stepped underneath the single light bulb that hung in the room, I saw a woman. She was hispanic and slightly older than me. She was petite with short hair and tired eyes. I reached out to touch her arm as if I was questioning whether or not she was real. 



I tried to speak but I didn’t know what to say. 



She broke the silence and said to someone behind her, “Help me make a bed for her.” my head snapped to the right as I heard footsteps approaching. I couldn’t see him, but I heard a low voice say, “ok”. He grabbed some blankets and a sack of something that could barely pass as a pillow and shaped something of a bed for me. The mystery woman guided me to the floor and told me to relax. I couldn’t grasp what was happening and my mind was so focused on understanding the room around me. Unable to get a grip on reality, my body simply moved down as she gently laid me on the makeshift bed. I heard the two muttering something to me, but it sounded garbled. Shaking, and praying for this to be a dream, I closed my eyes and everything went dark.
