People always say you need to learn to enjoy being alone with yourself—to be your own best friend and whatnot. I’ve always adhered to this, and being alone in my solitude was never a problem, that is, until I saw myself.

It started out in a way that made it hard for anyone to notice what was going on. I would check my closet for a change of clothes before going out and notice that there seemed to be fewer clothes than usual, not a large amount or anything outrageous, but two or three shirts would be gone that I swear I had just put there the last time I did the laundry. I would simply shrug this off, thinking I must've misplaced them somewhere along the way to hanging them up, though no matter how hard I looked, they were nowhere to be seen. I’ve even somehow misplaced my favorite out of the bunch. 

Then there were the drinks. When I wake up, I always make sure to feed the caffeine addiction as soon as possible, practically still being asleep when I make my coffee. I would always sip from my mug for a bit, then set it down to start looking at my groggy self and messy black hair in the mirror before getting my outfit ready for the day. Of course, I would always return to finish the mug I left on the counter, though I would hate to waste something I brought. This time, the mug felt much lighter than it should have. Strange I thought, bummed out thinking I had more left in the mug, it was practically empty. I should have had half left, damn near even more. Though these thoughts wouldn't stay for too long, and the entire thing got shrugged off entirely, I must have just misjudged how much I had in my sleep-induced stupor. What I couldn't keep shrugging off, however, was what started happening next. 
I was hanging out with Leo, one of my better friends, when I mentioned going to the nearby Burger King to grab something to eat.  

"Can’t we at least go somewhere else this time?" Leo replied. 

"What...?" Leo and I hadn’t gone out to eat in at least a month. 

"We literally just went there like three days ago. We could at least do Taco Bell or something." 

"Sure, man. Whatever you say," I told him. I liked Taco Bell more, and it's not like I would be the one driving us. But I had no clue what the hell he was talking about 3 days ago. I was in my apartment the whole day. Honestly, I was just thinking it was his weed brain acting up again, and he was just confusing me with another friend.  

A few days later, still unable to find my shirt, I noticed that there was a large cut going down my left forearm, thin and surface level like a cat scratch. Honestly, this wasn't much of anything to note. It’s easy to ding yourself on something jagged when you live in the apartment that I do. I went back to digging for the damn shirt, even moving my whole mattress to look under it when I got a text. It was my boss from the paint shop where I worked. It wasn't a place I loved all too much, but it was close to me, and the pay was enough to get by. Mostly, I clocked in, avoided crowds (yes, crowds—paint selling is chaos), did the bare minimum, and clocked out. ‘James (Boss)’ glowed on my screen, that red (1) like a warning. Great. Time to job hunt. Though opening it, to my surprise—it was positive? 

*“Hey, Alan, it was a great meeting. I want you to know you've been given the position. Your work has been very much noticed.”* I looked up from my phone in bewilderment but quickly went back to text  

*“What meeting?”*

*“Yeah, right! A guy like you probably had a few, anyway, congrats. I am still blown away at how you were keeping track of this quarter's sales; even I don't take the time to do that.”*

If I could do an ounce of math—with all due respect, I probably wouldn’t be working at a stupid ass paint shop just to get by. There was no meeting I attended; all I had been doing was looking for the same god. damn. shirt. 
In my state of panic and confusion, I was wildly pacing until I reached the kitchen. Neatly folded on my counter, it sat with a note right next to it. “Hey Alan, thanks for letting me borrow it! Maybe it was even the reason we—or, well, I was able to land the promotion. I think it's my new favorite shirt.” -Allen

It was three days after the note and shirt appeared, I couldn't be surer, since there was exactly two sleepless nights I had following it, and now I was on my third.  I’ve tried to sleep, but the knowledge of there being something out there like me—a better me, made it impossible. Listen, science is my damn rock. I've always thought that. Shit like this isn’t out there. But it's all that my brain could say to make sense of it all. 

Then came the noise. My forever drooped eyelids seized completely open as my head shot around my room looking for the source. I would have almost assumed it was just the pounding of my heart if it didn’t happen again. From the living room came a muffled sound I couldn’t place, almost like something dragging. I had to get closer; I just needed to prove that there was just something wrong with me—that I was simply making this all up. I Stagger my way into the entrance of the living room until I became paralyzed. They say the choices are fight or flight, but my legs chose to keep me right where I was planted. What stood before me… was me—but something nothing like me at the same time. My face was discolored, looking ashen with the structure of it grossly exaggerated, the nose too long and bent. My eyes looked sunken and dried resembling a pair of white raisins more than anything from the human anatomy. The jaw was far past unhinged and went all the way down to the things center. Its limbs were too long for its own frame; its knees were buckling in on themselves, looking as if the leg bones were internally twisted. Hanging low to the ground were both of its hands; fingers seemingly mashed onto them jutting out in various directions with long curled nails on the end of them. In my horror all I could do was take in what I was seeing, that was until my strained eyes were forced to blink. In an instant it was gone from my sight and just as quickly the curse on my legs were lifted. I was able to finally choose flight. I thanked every piece of my soul for leaving my keys in my bedroom as I went out my bedside window towards my car. I knew I had to get far away from where I lived —where it lived.

I wish I was crazy. I wish I could just return to my mediocre position at the paint shop where I could just do some mediocre work and get my mediocre paycheck. It's been around a year since I first saw him; after leaving I stayed at a couple of motels, i've distancing myself as I thought of what to do. Im in a city a few states away now instead of a town, I knew I needed to be around more people, I couldn’t be alone anymore—my old life exists still in that town, just without *me* in it. I was scared of what would happen there with people who knew me but yet nothing has happened to them, they just don’t know that’s not me. It seems it's only me that can see what that thing really looks like. I still get pay from the shop, it’s seem’s to have even become the stores manager since the time I’ve been gone. I still get messages from Leo, and it includes full blown conversations, but I can’t see anything I say to him, it’s almost like he’s just talking to a wall; he seems to enjoy me more.

I stay I’n public as much as I possibly can. Sitting on my laptop in cafes or eateries in the day and going to clubs when it gets darker. Sleep has taken a large toll on me. I stay up for long periods until I can’t take it then ill sleep on a park bench during the day in busier hours. I swear I see it sometimes. Glancing up to a mirror after washing my hands Ill see its cocked neck looking at me. The paranoia and sleeplessness come together like that sometimes. I don’t know how much longer a person is supposed to live like this, I’m always looking over my shoulder, scanning crowds, and staying in the light.

 I have no one to tell this to, with my general unease at everything and the absolute insanity behind this story I would be either mocked or institutionalized effective immediately. But I needed this out there somewhere so I’m posting this on social media because I need help.


 I just went to this café for the first time; they asked if I wanted my usual.
