Hey guys. I’m posting this here because I am so genuinely scared and concerned about what just happened to me yesterday. I am currently under the covers in my bed frantically typing this on my phone because i’m too scared to get up and check up on my mother.

For the past two weeks, my mother was away on a business trip. Since I’m 18 and working, she allowed me to stay at the house alone to do some housekeeping. My mother and I live in a pretty big house in middle-of-nowhere Texas, so two weeks alone in the house gets lonely. We are new to the area as we just moved in a couple of months ago so for the past fourteen days, I've been cooped up in our giant home alone and have been waiting for my mother to come home. 

So yesterday night when i heard the familiar jingle of her keys and front door open, i was excited to see my mother. I got up from my bed and ran down to the kitchen to ask her about the trip. Thats when i noticed my mother just standing at the kitchen counter not acknowledging me at all. She didn’t say hi to me, or tell me that she missed me. She didn’t even look up at me.

My mother grew up through the Vietnam war. She has lived through seeing people killed in front of her. She spent her teenage years hopping from refugee camp to refugee camp. Basically, my mother has seen the worst of the worst in humanity. Despite her difficult upbringing, my mother has always been extremely loving and talkative and our relationship is extremely close.

So I was confused about what could have shaken her up so bad that she wouldn’t acknowledge me. She simply returned home, placed her bags on the kitchen floor, and headed straight to her bedroom. I didnt want to pry my mother about what happened on the trip, so i headed back to my room without a word to give her time to herself. I was going to ask her about it the next day. 

This morning i woke up to a facetime from my mom. This was strange since my mother is the type of person to come upstairs to wish me a good morning. I answered regardless and that’s when my heart dropped.

My mother was still at the airport. She said something along the lines of, “Sorry baby, I’m running a bit late since my flight is delayed. I will be home by dinner.”

If my mom was still at the airport, then who the hell came home last night? I just stared at my mom over the facetime for a while until i finally answered back, “Mama, if you are still at the airport, then who came home last night?”

My mom’s face dropped and she told me to hang up the call and hide under the covers. She sounded genuinely frightened and i have never seen my mother like that for the past eighteen years she has raised me. That obviously scared the shit out of me, so i did as she said and hung up immediately. After i hung up, my mother texted me, “If whoever is in the house asks you to leave your room, do not listen to them. Stay in your room Con. I’m calling Co Ba.”
Thats when I heard my fake mother from the bottom of the stairs go, “Con, i have breakfast ready. Come down baby”

I literally dont know what to do and im scared shitless. I'm currently waiting for my uncle Co Ba to arrive.
