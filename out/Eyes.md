Putting contacts in for the first time was a huge accomplishment. My thick framed glasses had subjected me to bullying when I was young. I’ve had glasses for as long as I can remember, even before kindergarten. All of my pictures as a child feature those thick blue glasses strapped around my head making my baby-face-proportions even more uncanny. After years of trying at the optometrist, I got over my fear and discomfort around contacts. The thought of touching my eyes was crippling and every time I’d make an attempt, the tears would blur my vision making it that much harder to complete the task at hand. This also created a love/hate relationship with my eyelashes as they presented a barrier but also protected my eyes from the foreign objects trying to find their way in.

After that first success it became easier each time. But the feeling of my finger pressed against my cornea, the slight squish as the soft silicon layers adhered to my eye, still gives me chills everytime.

This leads me to my current issue. A few days ago, I noticed my vision becoming more blurred even with the assistance of the contacts. I pushed up my yearly optometrist check up thinking my prescription was changing again. But after the puff of air, reading those letters, and even dilation of my pupils the doctor found that nothing had changed. I assured her that my vision was blurrier than usual. I told her I had found myself squinting at the tv and at road signs. She suggested that the contacts were drying out over the day and gave me some eye drops.

I went home and the next day, woke up with an itch on my back. I felt a firm bump above my shoulder blade. My brain went wild with possible scenarios. Maybe a bug bite or a cyst? *God forbid it’s a tumor*. I pushed my speculation away and went to check the area in the mirror. When I craned my neck to look over my shoulder, I saw something that made me freeze. There was a fleshy bump covered with a thin layer of skin. A thin line crested the bulge and I could just barely make out some small hairs growing from the seam. I probed the area with my finger, stunned. As I pulled lightly at what I would now call the eyelid, the skin parted and I felt the cold air sting the area. Under the skin was a bloodshot, fleshy ball with veins akin to what you see when you strain your eyeball in any direction. At the time it had no iris or pupil.

I’m going to the emergency room first thing in the morning. I cannot go now because it is raining hard and with my already faulty eyesight I don’t feel safe to drive.

I know I’m likely overreacting but even now as I write this, I can feel that extra set of eyelashes brushing against my shirt. If anyone has heard of something like this, please let me know. I’ll update as soon as I know more.
