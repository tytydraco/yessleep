I have already posted this in another reddit community. I do not use reddit. I only wanted to make this one post as I want some possible explanations which I did not get before in my other community post, here goes nothing:

Hello. First of all I would like to say most of the stories here I am very skeptical about as I do not actually believe in the paranormal. I would like to think of myself as a very rational person, who always figured stuff out with just pure logic and reason, and so I managed to logically explain most of the "paranormal" encounters I have initially thought to experience in my life.

However, there is this one experience that I seemingly just cannot really shake off nor explain with logic and reason. I assure you all of this is real in terms of my personal experience. Whether it incentivized by my creativity or autosuggestion, I cannot really tell you guys.

I am currently 20 years old and this happened to me when I was about 13 years old, so bear with me, as I do not remember all the details perfectly. I remember it well enough to rewrite it in this format. It was a normal day. I was meeting with my cousin. On my way there, we suddenly started talking about scary encounters that each of us experienced, which is when my mother told me about the encounter that my cousin swore to experience. My cousin claimed to have seen two big, orange eyes from behind her television, weirdly glowing, open, yet not moving or doing anything, just watching. She is now 26 and to this day, she still claims to have experienced this and she is totally confident in it. I brushed it off, even as a child, I did not believe in the paranormal or ghosts. Throughout the day, nothing interesting happened. It started to get really odd when I went to sleep though. As I was falling asleep, I saw the same set of eyes, except they had different colour. I do not remember perfectly but I believe they were red, instead of orange, looking at me, from the exact place where my cousin was supposed to witness the eyes herself. I was scared, very scared during the night. I somehow managed to fall asleep while trying to suppress what I just saw. Throughout the rest of the night, I never actually looked back to see whether the eyes are still there. I was staring at them for about 5 seconds before deciding to completely ignore them, to not show any weaknesses, which is basically my coping mechanism ever since I was little. Nothing else happened that night and when I woke up, the eyes were not there anymore and I have never seen them once again in my entire life.

Is there anybody with a similar experience? If not, any theories what might have been caused this? I believe it was just a matter of subconscious autosuggestion, though what is weird is that throughout the entire day, I never actually thought about the eyes my mom told me about once, and yet, they still appeared, which is not really typical for instances of autosuggestion.
