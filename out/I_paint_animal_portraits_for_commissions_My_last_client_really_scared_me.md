I paint animal portraits for commissions. 
My last client really scared me.

Firstly, I've always enjoyed art. Putting paint to paper and creating something, if only just for a few hours, is a pleasure that cannot be replicated. It was my escape from reality, and it didn't hurt I was paid handsomely for my work, either.

Secondly, ever since I started painting.. I see things.. memories.. while painting my subject. It's hard to describe but basically I get point of view flashes of memories that the person I was painting had experienced. It was terrifying.

When I was 13 I did my first ever painting of my aunt and saw my uncle, her husband, raising fists and smashing glass, holding the jagged edge against my throat. I remember being too upset to finish the portrait, and the hushed voices of my parents later that night after my aunt had gone home.

At 13 was too young to really put two and two together, and I experienced a similar thing for every other person I drew over the years.
I never told anyone about it, but once I painted a neighbours horse and saw nothing but green grass and cute little Foles, I figured out I could still indulge in my love of art without the trauma associated with it.

That's honestly why I stuck to painting pets. Dogs and cats had much less running through their mind than their human counterparts. A dogs memories were usually a run at the dog park, chasing the ball in the backyard, pats off their human. 


Dave emailed me last week to book in a portrait for his dog, Barney. 
Barney was a saint Bernard, 5 years old, recently adopted. 
He had been found wandering the streets, lost and scruffy, before Dave had rescued him, taking him home for a much needed groom and big bowl of dog food. They'd been inseparable ever since.
I loved stories like this, and felt myself drawn to Dave's kindness and compassion. 

Dave was just as sweet in person, and so was Barney. I'd had plenty of experience with strays and usually found them to be skittish, so I was prepared, but big Barney sauntered in and lumbered up on the pet sofa and sat up straight, as if posing for his portrait. 

Dave asked if I would like a coffee from the cafe down the road, and left to let me get started on the portrait. I waited for him to tell Barney to stay, but he didn't, and there wasn't really any need because Barney watched him go with bored eyes and then turned to me, to my art supplies and canvas, as if waiting.

I chucked to myself and got to work.

The first scene that flashed through my mind was not a dog park.
It was a simple concrete room, with a dirty, blood stained floor. A single mattress was on the floor, along with a bucket of water. 
It wasn't my memory, but I could feel the painful emptiness of hunger.

My heart lurched at the thought of Barney tied up in some cold shed, all alone and starving.

I took a deep breath and continued painting.

Heavy boots, a light scent of ammonia. A whimper escapes Barney/me.
A bunch of keys rattle in the distance, and the boots keep getting closer.
The door moans when it opens. 
A man in Gumboots walk slowly, thump thump thump. In his hands is a metal bowl, filled with a beige sludge that faintly smells like weetbix mixed with something sour.
The bowl clatters to the floor.
"Eat."

The memory is broken by the sound of Dave returning. 
I am grateful for the break, the distraction.
I take the cup of coffee with a smile but Dave frowned and asked why I had been crying?
I felt to my face to find it wet and realised I hadn't realised.
I played it off by making a joke about loving dogs that much it made me teary. 
We chatted for a bit longer and Barney had a toilet break, before resuming our positions.

The same room, but this time the bowl is empty. 
I'm seeing things through Barney's eyes, feeling what he was feeling, and at that moment, I'm dizzy and disorientated. I feel sick. The metal bowl is empty of the beige sludge, but there's gritty white residue left. I can feel Barney's eyes growing heavy, and his body start to relax. Eyes are closing, and Barney's/my head lurches forward as we drift off, when a flash of long blonde hair comes into my peripheral, before sleep takes us.

Dave's voice brought me back to reality. He asks if I'm okay?
It's not a good look, I think numbly to myself whilst also not really caring, for your paying client to keep asking if you are alright.
I forced a smile and said absolutely, when I'm painting I just totally get into the zone. 

I already know something's wrong but I don't know what exactly. 
I dont know what else to do, so I keep painting. 

The room is different. It's still old, cold and concrete but this one has a long metal table and bright lights up ahead. 
The man is mumbling to himself, humming some sort of tune as he arranges cords and medical equipment that looks as if it's from the 1800's.
Barney/I struggle against the metal but we are tied down, a sinking feeling says it's futile to bother escaping. 

The man moves closer and smiles down sadly.
Barney recognises and know him, I can feel the hurt of the truth this brings, but I have never seen the man before. He looks evil, crazy. Bloodshot eyes, the stale stench of sweat.

My heart lurches even more, when the man brings down a dirt streaked hand held mirror, holding it up over Barney/me to reveal the imagine of a young woman with long blonde hair and green eyes. Duct tape is over her mouth, and her eyes are bruised and swollen. Despite that, you could tell she was beautiful.
As quickly as the mirror appears it is thrust away, and the man waves a finger and says if she can't be a good wife, maybe she can be a loyal dog.
Fear takes over. Everything goes black.

When I put down my brush, my hands are shaking so violently I spill the paint. 
I stare at Barney, or whoever she was before she was turned into Barney, and I can see that they know that I know.
I opened  my mouth to say something but nothing came out. I told Dave I wasn't feeling well and I'd send him the art work out when I finished. I told him wouldn't charge him.

He was confused and I don't think he really believed me but would could he say? He left without much issue, Barney close and faithful by his side as he walked out. 

I've tried to put Barney out of my mind.
I've tried to forget about the man who did this. 
I've even stopped painting.

But last night I got another email from Dave.
He told me that Barney had gone missing, that he must've run off when someone left the gate open.


I didn't reply. I deleted the message right away.


What could I say? Barney's been at my back door, sleeping on the porch for the last 2 hours. I've put water out, and food. I'm too scared to let him in.. I know how loyal dogs are to their owners, that's all. A

nd I can't escape the thought that perhaps the loyal dog might be wanting to find their real owner another 'good wife'.
