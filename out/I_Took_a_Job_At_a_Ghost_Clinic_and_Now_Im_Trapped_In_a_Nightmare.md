VitaNova Health Solutions is a corrupt and sinister organization that has kept me hostage to their sick and twisted clinic for months. They are an evil harbinger of death and commit atrocities worse than the human imagination could fathom. My whistle blowing will surely bring me a fate worse than that, but I no longer care. I am finally ready to break the silence.¬†

I graduated with a degree in public health a while ago, but was finding it difficult to actually get a job. The market was atrocious, and from what I have been hearing, it still is. It doesn‚Äôt matter anyways since I can‚Äôt leave this burning hell pit of a ‚Äújob‚Äù.¬†

I was mindlessly scrolling through Indeed, basically drooling on my desk with nothing else better to do and low and behold the perfect opportunity presented itself. A posting for a ‚ÄúPatient Screening Assistant‚Äù.¬†

I know, I know. You probably think this post looks like a huge red flag, but my desperate and naive brain thought this was the most badass thing I could apply to in the sea of average and criminally underpaid positions I was forced to skim over on a day to day basis. The thought of being at the verge of scientific innovation while also being a hybrid worker was so enticing. Not to mention the pay! I mean you have to see it through my eyes, this was by far the best opportunity listed anywhere for a new grad like me. So, I submitted my application and waited.¬†

I began to feel suspicious as soon as I got my offer of acceptance. Before I could do my on-boarding, they wanted me to sign the aforementioned NDA from the initial job posting. Another thing I have to mention is that in every email they sent me, there was never a supervisor mentioned or even a single name. It was all confidential, and never once since I have started to work here have I seen a single person other than the patients that shamble through the front door.¬†

They sent me a fingerprint scanner through the mail that I had to plug into my desktop, then open a portal to their ‚Äúbio-metric scan‚Äù system that lagged the hell out of my PC. It glitched a few times before I could even open the system, but it essentially scanned my face and both thumbs simultaneously. The fingerprint scanner burnt like hell and when I released my thumb, the skin of it peeled off the thin membrane and became wet, like I just dipped my hand in water for hours and the skin pruned. There were mechanisms under the membrane that heated up and undulated like squirming maggots. The face scanner flashed violently and burned an image of my face into my retinas for a couple of minutes afterward, which really freaked me out when I leaned back and closed my eyes from the headache, only to see my own face staring back at me.¬†

Once completed, the page rerouted me to their NDA. Which, I‚Äôm not going to lie, I didn‚Äôt read at all. The thing was massive, like a whole legal textbook that was hundreds of pages long. I‚Äôm not ashamed to admit it, and let‚Äôs be real, none of us have read every legal paper ever handed to us by our employers. I mean, yes it was stupid to not even skim something so legally binding, but again, desperation and excitement did terrible things to my mental state. I don‚Äôt have the NDA on me since after I signed it, they locked me out of it. But, I do have the initial on-boarding email still saved.¬†

After those two pieces of correspondence I just shared with you, I do not have any evidence of me working at the clinic. Every further correspondence sent to me was through a secure company owned flip phone and PC at the site.¬†

From here on out, things get ugly. It pains me to even think about this place. The vestiges of memory I am clinging onto leave me like leaves in the wind. I‚Äôm trying desperately to grab every one, but they singe my insides and toss my guts on a frying pan.¬†

The clinic is an unmarked building located on the outskirt of my town. It‚Äôs a brick square painted beige, with five steps leading up to a monumental steel door. There is one large window to the right of the door, but it has been covered in a sheet of metal bolted to the frame and painted to match the brick. A fence with barbed wire stretches to the right side and behind the building, keeping nothing but dirt safe from the outside world. Two cameras are pointed down from the top corners of the front door, giving a view of the front entrance, which when I look at them, the door unlocks and I can come inside. I don‚Äôt know if someone is manning the cameras to verify identity, or if my bio-metric scan is somehow linked to the cameras and opens the door for me. But, I am inclined to believe that someone is always watching me while I am on site.

I had to do the graveyard shift. So, from midnight until 8AM, I am locked in what is essentially a prison holding cell with a front desk and examination room. As malnourished as the outside of the place is, the inside is reflectively pristine and sterile. The only notable signs of use were on the arm chairs in the waiting room, bearing the scars of scratching on their rests and cracked leather seats.

On my first couple of days, I noticed that although our operating hours are at night, the medical equipment used for evaluations are constantly replaced or moved around. The arm cuffs still felt warm to the touch on a couple of occasions I was setting up the evaluation room. I also could not be allowed access to the clinic if I were even a minute early for my shift. The door just wouldn‚Äôt open until exactly midnight.¬†

The storeroom containing the classified vials of drugs I was to administer to patients after screening never seemed to reduce in number, but are definitely moved around between shifts. Like someone was treating patients, but they restocked the vials to full capacity before I came in. With how recent the equipment had to have been used, there were a couple of occasions that whoever was there would have just left, but I never saw anyone else walk out that door whenever I waited outside.

I have no clue what the drugs are, and I am not supposed to know. The vials in the stock room are filled with a viscous fluid that resembles olive oil, but when touched by artificial light, the fluid begins to shimmer and wriggle as if it were filled with small parasites incubating in agar. The first time I pulled a vial out and inspected it at my desk, I got a notification to take it back to the stockroom immediately, and to never expose the drug to light again. I did as I was told.

No one came into the clinic for weeks. I was getting paid, but not doing any work, so I was alone in this creepy place with nothing to do and cameras watching my every movement. I thought a lot about quitting, but it occurred to me that I may never get a job where I was paid so well to do nothing again. Not to mention this place would look good on my resume, so I hunkered down and kept busy with books and puzzles until my notification to clock out flashed on screen. It was strange, but it worked for me and I could handle the absurd secrecy of it all. That was until my first patient arrived.¬†

The door shrieked and startled me so bad I dropped the book I was reading. An old man shuffled past the door that automatically shut behind him and the gears inside locked it with a metallic resonance.¬†

His gait was a trembling mess, where his left leg was dragged along by the right side of his body and his other one shivered from the weight it was burdened with. His pale face was gaunt, with deep pockets for cheeks and wrinkles lining his forehead up to where his hairline should have been.¬†

When he approached the desk, he leaned on it for support and his back arched to get up close and eye level with me. His eyes were dilated, like deep pools of misery filled his soul and the effects cursed his terrible body. I could tell from that angle his veins were bulging and pulsating in shifting patterns of green and blue, squirming when he spoke.

‚ÄúDennis Thompson, for my 2:30,‚Äù he said with a breath reeking of sour apple rot.

His grotesque demeanor and prying eyes made me more uncomfortable. His eyes lingered on me for too long, and he made some remarks on how soft my skin must be, or how my boyfriend (who doesn‚Äôt exist) must be so lucky.¬†

I checked him in, and followed the instructions given to me on how to conduct Dennis‚Äô evaluation. It was a normal preliminary screening. Blood pressure, oxygen, temp, heart rate, respiratory rate. Of course, he continued to be a scumbag throughout the process. Moaning a little when I had to reach under his shirt to hear his popping lungs.¬†

It‚Äôs a maddening thing to be put in a situation like this, because your brain is screaming at you to say something, to turn the man away and reject this encounter. Face the consequences from the boss later. But, I wasn‚Äôt allowed to. Part of the rules for seeing patients at the clinic is that you cannot turn them away because the drug we have is necessary for them. Regardless of how terrible they can be, I have to treat them. So, I endured the sexual harassment and finished his screening. It‚Äôs not like there was a man here with me working at the clinic who could replace me. I am all alone, but I am strong. I thought I could handle dirty old Dennis for a little while longer.¬†

I cleared him for his telehealth appointment with the doctor, and left the room. There is a TV in there that I turn on and notify the doctor that the patient is ready to be seen from the computer at the front desk. It was like a zoom call, but I couldn‚Äôt see what was going on in there as I had to shut the door before I left, for confidentiality reasons. However, I could hear some muffled words.

"‚Ä¶cranial density exceeds‚Ä¶ but the growth‚Ä¶ still accelerating."

"‚Ä¶spinal misalignment... no, it's not a rejection. It's adapting."

"*Please‚Ä¶ it hurts‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt see well‚Ä¶*"

"‚Ä¶his vitals are‚Ä¶ Maintain observation. We can't risk..."

"*They‚Äôre still inside me. Can‚Äôt you see them?*"

I was hexed. What on Earth were they talking about in there? Thirty minutes later, I got a notification that the patient was done, and to go ahead and administer his medication.¬†

I turned the lights off, as instructed. The viscous fluid inside the syringe tinged a sickly, iridescent yellow. The label had no name, just a series of numbers, printed in black ink that had started to smudge. My gloved hands trembled slightly as I held it, my pulse quickening. Dennis sat motionless in the examination chair, his eyes wide and distant, barely registering my presence. His doctor visit left him a sorry sack of bones that only answered me with guttural utterances of ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù‚Äôs.¬†

‚ÄúJust a routine dose,‚Äù I murmured, more to myself than to him. The on-boarding had said nothing about the contents, just that the injections were ‚Äúpart of the assessment.‚Äù No questions, no refusals.

I pressed the needle to the thick vein bulging against his pale skin. The rubbery texture was off, too taut, like the flesh was resisting. But with a steady hand, I punctured through. The needle slid in far too easily. Like his body was welcoming it.

The liquid forced its way inside, and the moment it did, Dennis let out a low, trembling groan. His fingers twitched. Beads of sweat erupted along his forehead. I tried to pull the syringe away, but the vein pulsed and constricted, clinging to the needle like a thirsty parasite. It took a harsh tug to free it.

‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù I whispered, but Dennis didn't respond.

The first sign was the trembling. Not subtle, but violent, like something within him was struggling to escape. His hands seized the sides of the chair, his nails scraping against the worn leather. Veins began to bulge along his forearms, inky black lines twisting and writhing like snakes beneath his skin.

I was speechless, slowly backing away. Dennis' breathing hitched, each gasp sharp and ragged. Then came the sound. A low, wet popping. Like meat splitting open.

His neck thickened, veins bulging beneath the skin. His jaw clenched as his teeth gnashed together, the muscles visibly straining, and molars cracking with the force. Then the jawbone shifted. Stretched. The skin at the corners of his mouth tore with a series of grotesque snaps, forcing a grin that split his face in half. The blood gushed from every orifice, pooling on him and on the floor.

I was frozen.

His eyes rolled back, the sclera darkening to a milky gray. His fingers convulsed, the knuckles protruding unnaturally as the bones beneath seemed to swell and crack. The nails blackened, curling like claws. His breathing turned to guttural snarls, wet and labored.

The skin along his forearm began to ripple. I watched in horror as something beneath the flesh twitched and writhed. A sickening bulge traced along the bone, it was a parasite seeking escape. Finally, with a nauseating squelch, he exploded. The ribs couldn‚Äôt handle the pressure building in the torso, and suddenly the whole room was misted with his warm insides, fogging the windows. I wiped my eyes and slipped on something that popped under my foot.

On the floor in front of Dennis‚Äô contorted corpse, was what looked like a child.¬†

It got on all fours, and met my gaze. It was an abortion. A face full of gnawing teeth like molars, mouth splitting the face, large blue eyes that encompassed the forehead, leaving no room for a nose. It was covered in blood and fluids, resembling a newborn.¬†

It stood up, and began to grow.

‚ÄúSo pretty. You‚Äôre‚Ä¶ so pretty.‚Äù

But the words were lost in the midst of a ragged choke. Its spine contorted, vertebrae cracking audibly as the body jerked toward me, shifting through the phases of adolescence. A second spine-like ridge began to protrude along the back, thin and sharp like bone shards splitting free.¬†

I scooted back, still on my ass from slipping earlier. Bile was rising in my throat, the acidity burning my screams and cries for help.¬†

It reached me in an adult form, still wet from infancy. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ smooth‚Ä¶ I want‚Ä¶ you.‚Äù

The thing slipped a crooked hand over my mouth and reached for my pants, when the lights turned on.

It revolted and wailed, flesh burning in the light. Alarms went off in the building, echoing and resonating with one another. The speakers from the TV were blaring.¬†

‚ÄúNON VIABLE CANDIDATE. DISPOSAL REQUIRED.‚Äù

That was my first patient. I wish I could tell you it was my last.¬†

I left that place as the mess it was, being notified that my shift would end early, and I earned a bonus for treating a patient that week.

After showering the chunks out of my hair and throwing away my clothes, I thought about calling the police, but I didn‚Äôt know where to start, or what to say. Would they even do anything? Would they believe me? Do they already know, and can‚Äôt do anything about it? I was in total shock. I honestly still am. I feel empty. Like a husk that once held humanity.

I didn‚Äôt go back to work the following day. I messaged my superiors that I quit. I couldn‚Äôt do the sick and twisted shit that they wanted me to. All I got back was a cold and automated email that I‚Äôll transcribe for you.¬†

I‚Äôve been forced to treat patients ever since.

I am still here, though I am no longer whole. Forced to create nightmares I never imagined, I fight to keep my mind intact. VitaHealth Solutions are engineering monsters, and I am one of their unwilling instruments.
