I’m not sure how this is going to be perceived, but it is extremely vital that I get the word out to someone. So far, no one has listened to me. No cops, no DA’s, no therapists, no psychiatrist, absolutely no one. I need someone to believe me. I am not losing my mind.



I had a friend group consisting of five guys. Big Thom, Darryl, Robbie, Lawrence and Gill, with myself making up the sixth of the group. All of us had been friends since high school and hung out through college. It was known even in high school and more in college, that even though all of us were a group, Lawerence and Gill were best friends first. If a party was on the agenda for the night, they always arrived together and left together. Both went to the same college, majored in computer science, and both graduated top of the class. Having two friends like that led to so many jokes about sexuality or dependence, but within the group, it was normal. Kind of like having twins as friends, I always thought. Hell, they even looked alike, both being small, nerdy types. Cut to us at 26, and we all lived in the same city, Chicago. Thom and I had a house all to ourselves out in the suburbs, which was where the incident took place.



We had a once a month poker night that all of us showed up to religiously. Big Thom and I held the poker night in the basement, which was decorated like you would expect college graduates without prospective dating partners would decorate the house like. It was an open concept basement, with just one length of a wall being taken up by the bathroom and the laundry room.  We had posters along the walls along with Thom’s trophies. He had many and they were large, seeing as he used to be a top wrestling prospect at university until he messed up his shoulder. Thom had always been big, but after the shoulder injury he had ballooned up to 350 pounds. Giving the nickname Big Thom some serious truth behind it.



Darryl and Robbie showed up around 9 that night. Poker night didn’t start until 10, but Robbie never turned down a beer and Darryl liked having a buddy to ride with on the Metro. We were casually waiting around the table when Robbie started talking about Lawrence and Gill.



“What do you think they got up to in Thailand? Just some fun times or something better. Like a you know…” he said as he killed his beer with a wink.



“C’mon man. Don’t be like that. They went to look at some temples or something. Don’t be rude about it,” Thom said, giving Robbie his patented look of disdain.



“I’m just saying man, those two have been getting weirder and weirder. I caught lunch with them in the city before the trip and they were super excited. Like kids on Christmas morning excited. And two days ago, I saw them on Lower Wacker at night, just walking among the slums. No smiles, no expressions. I honked my horn and flipped the bird out the window, and they just stared like I was a stranger. Now, tell me that ain’t some weird shit,” Robbie said.



It was a bit strange, because even though Lawrence and Gill were tight, they were always friendly and quick to say hello. And it wouldn’t be like they missed seeing Robbie, he was the only asshat in Chicago to drive a bright blue, jacked up Jeep. It stood out, making it easy to spot him randomly out and about the city.



“Yeah, well, who knows man. Maybe you pissed them off recently. Did you do anything extremely dickheaded to them lately?” I asked, knowing just how easy it was to be pissed at Robbie. He had a way of getting under your skin, but was good about recognizing when he goes too far.



“That’s just it, I haven’t done anything. I’ve practically been a choir boy,” Robbie said excitedly, sensing I was grasping his meaning with our two friends. We then heard the garage door open, something that was not shocking as we had given each of our friends the passcode, allowing them to come in whenever they wanted.



“Well I think they just arrived, so drop it. We’ll see how the night goes and if it’s still weird at the end of it, we’ll say something as a group. Fair?” Darryl proposed, quickly agreed upon by Thom and myself. Just then we heard the door to the basement open and down came Lawrence and Gill, both looking stoned faced and stiff with their movements.



“Boys, about time. Let’s do this!” Big Thom shouted as we made our way around the poker table. Lawrence and Gill looked at each other, and then sat down across from each other. The other four of us just stared in amazement. They never sat apart from one another. They had always sat next to each other, Gill on the right and Lawrence on the left. Robbie gave me a wide eyed face, and motioned with his eyes at the pair, in a “Are you seeing this shit” kind of way.

.

I sat down with the others, not exactly ignoring Robbie, but not giving in to his skepticism just yet. Darryl grabbed the cards and started shuffling as Thom pulled out the chips from under the table and started dividing them up between us. We played as normal, but there were problems with Gill and Lawrence, like the way they were placing bets or the fact that they never once cracked a smile or a joke during the time we played. They would never increase a bet, but always called one, regardless of if they had a good hand or not. They didn’t drink anything either: no beer, no water, no sodas, nothing. It wasn’t making any sense. And then there were their eyes. I would catch them staring, leering at us as the night wore on. Gill was staring at me and Thom, while Lawrence’s eyes lingered on Darryl and Robbie. Robbie finally stood and said he was going for a smoke, gesturing upstairs and looking at me.



“Yeah, I’ll burn one,” I said, heading towards the stairs with him.



“I’m going to use the toilet, “ Lawrence said suddenly, standing up and looking at Gill with such an intense stare.



“I’ll stay here,” Gill said, peering down at Lawrence intently.

“Are you two hooking up or something? Jesus, you two are so weird tonight,” Robbie said as we went upstairs. I didn’t even have it in me to tell him off for making fun of them, because I was getting a bit weirded out by them as well.



Outside the garage, Robbie had already lit a cigarette and passed me the butt. He took a deep drag, and sighed, “Dude, we have to say something. This is beyond weird man.”



“Yeah, I know. I keep getting the feeling that they are staring at us, like they are watching our moves or something,” I said, exhaling smoke and looking at the stars. I was trying to keep my cool, and not let Robbie make me even more nervous.



“Dude, EXACTLY! Lawrence is looking at me like I’m a steak man. Did you see how his eyes are dark, like the eye itself and the skin around it? It’s giving me the creeps. I don’t like this. I know Darryl and Thom are going to try and keep it civil and chill, but we have to find out what's going on. That means getting a bit tough with them and getting them to tell us the truth about what has changed them so much,” Robbie said, almost pleading with me. He flicked his butt into my yard, drawing a stern gaze from me. But he was right, this was beyond normal for Lawrence and Gill, and we needed to say something to get them back to normal.



“Ok, you're right. Let’s go down and…”



BAM!



We looked at each other. It sounded like a truck had crashed in my house.



BAM! 



BAM!



Two more crashes. I could then tell it was from my basement.



“What the hell?” Robbie said, pushing past me and as he ran towards the door. I was right on his heels. He led the way through the house to the basement stairs, taking them in leaps. We landed at the bottom of the stairs and came upon the scene of a horror movie.



Gill was atop Thom’s back, with both of them turned away from us. It looked like Gill was trying to choke out Thom, which was a ridiculous assumption considering Thom was twice his size and had years of training on his side. The basement was littered with the broken table and chairs, trophies strewn among the floor with the walls smashed in. Slowly, the two turned around and we could see the true savagery that was taking place.



Gill had a knife and was plunging it into Thom’s chest and neck. Blood was flowing down Thom’s shirt, almost pouring down the floor. Thom had a glazed look in his eyes and was making hand gestures towards us, like grabbing towards us or motioning us to go away. Thom’s legs gave out, with him dropping to his knees. It was then that I looked at Gill. Gill was grinning from ear to ear, breathing heavily but still able to laugh in a wheezing manner. It was as if he was getting joy out of murdering one of his closest friends. It was a sound that would have been unsettling even without the look on his face and the knife he was plunging into his friend’s body. I then saw his eyes, pure black, with black veins surrounding them. His gaze was focused clearly on Thom’s and I could hear him say words to Thom, “ *Una magis anima pro domino, Una magis anima pro domino, Una magis*...” Gill kept repeating the words until Thom fell face first onto the floor.



Robbie and I hadn’t moved. We were frozen in terror as we saw a friend murder another friend. I couldn’t make my legs move nor could I seem to take a breath. I broke through the fear when I heard Robbie cry, “What’s happening?”



“THOM!” I screamed as I ran towards Thom's body, as adrenaline pumped through me now. Gill looked up from Thom’s back still smiling, tilting his head to one side.



“One more for the Master,” he whispered before launching himself at me from the floor. I saw the knife in his hand but could do nothing to stop it as he quickly closed the space between us and plunged the knife into the side of my knee. I screamed in pain and collapsed on the ruined leg. When I collapsed, I fell on the knife, trapping it between my body and the floor. Gill was tugging at the handle, causing pain to keep shooting up my leg with each pull, causing my scream to falter and crack as my body started to sputter, my heart was beating out of my chest and I was losing my ability to breathe. Pain was controlling me, but fear was heightening the pain to the max. I had never seen my own blood come out like that, in such a spurting manner. 



“Oh my God! Oh my God!” I screamed, hyperventilating as I looked at Gill and his smile. I don’t wanna die, I began to repeat in my head over and over. The pain and fear caused the thought to go faster in my mind as I watched Gill wrench at the knife. I was looking around wildly as Gill finally gave up on the knife, and grabbed something off the floor.



Robbie jumped over me then and tackled Gill to the floor. Robbie burst up and immediately started kicking Gill. I tried to crawl away from the carnage, scared for my life, yet still watching over my shoulder as Robbie attacked Gill. Robbie looked to be getting the upper hand when the door to the bathroom burst open. I turned forward and saw Lawrence standing there. With a knife in his hand, blood dripped from the blade onto the floor. I looked at his face, and saw the same black eyes and black starburst veins leading from his eyes into his cheeks and forehead. He began to make his way towards Robbie and Gill. He walked past me, his target being Robbie alone. I fought through the fear and made my move. I rolled over and grabbed ahold of Lawrence’s leg, yelling to Robbie, “Robbie!! Run now!”



Lawrence slashed down with his knife and I reached up with my left arm to protect my face. Lawrence slashed my arm, and I felt another flair of pain. Lawrence reared back to slash again, and I found a reserve of energy and pushed up with all my might to tip Lawrence backwards and off balance. He went down hard, falling on the arm without the knife. There was a loud crack, as Lawrence landed. The knife he had previously been holding flew across the floor, into the debris caused by the fight between Thom and Gill. I thought he would be done for, so I didn’t expect Lawrence’s foot to connect with my chin. I had a sense of shock and then the lights went out.



I came to, slowly rising up, seeing Lawrence and Gill towering over a now beaten down Robbie. It looked like Robbie had given them all he had, but the two close friends seemed to feel no pain. Lawrence’s left hand was dripping blood and I noticed the bone was sticking out of the forearm. That was his only injury as I looked over at Gill and saw that Robbie had tuned him up good. One eye was almost completely swollen shut and blood was dripping down off his chin at a steady rate from multiple facial wounds. But regardless of their wounds, both men were standing still and stared down at the prone, yet still alive Robbie. They began to chant, the same line that Gill had said before taking down Thom. 



“*Una magis anima pro domino, Una Magis Anima Pro Domino, UNA MAGIS ANIMA PRO DOMINO*!” they were shouting. I saw that both now held some of Thom’s large wrestling trophies in hand. I could sense the moment coming to a head, and knew that Robbie would be on the receiving end of that moment.



Robbie then came to life, and he kicked up with his leg at Gill, trying to knock him down. But Robbie had been beaten too badly, and his strength was too far gone. Lawrence and Gill then both looked at each other and smiled. They raised their makeshift weapons and I turned my head before I could see another friend perish under their blows.



I covered my ears and waited for the screaming to stop, followed by the thuds. When I opened my eyes and uncovered my ears, my two former friends were now standing above me. Both sets of eyes were blacker than before, the veins of black spreading further into their faces. Whatever they were doing, it seemed to be consuming their very faces.



“Our master requires payment,” Gill said, tilting his head from side to side. He was studying me, I realized, like a scientist would when they study a worm in the ground. I could feel hatred and evilness emit from his face. There was also an alien feeling, like something from out of this world was trying to break free from the blackness that was his eyes.



“We are close to glory. You are close to glory. You shall witness HIS rise, even after you fall,” Lawrence whispered. “We are close now. Three more payments, and the master shall grace us.”



I waited as they began their chant again, knowing I would only have a few seconds to do what I needed to do. I had to time it right, there would only be one chance. Fear had me in its grip, but 



I had to overcome it. They looked down as they spoke, smiles so large that it cracked their faces in half.



“*Una magis anima pro domino, una magis anima pro domino*…” they chanted, raising the trophies in the air again. Their eyes, black pits now, with no distinction between the skin and eye. Their faces were sucking in all light in the world, drinking in my fear and my soul itself.



“Stop! Just stop!” I yelled as I reached both hands up to fend off the coming blows. I knew this was the end, but my body was still fighting on. I grabbed Gill’s weapon as it came down. I had hope for just a second, until I heard Lawrence’s grunt behind me. I don’t remember what happened after that, because Lawrence brought his trophy down on my head. One, two, three times he struck. And again, I lost consciousness.



A cop explained the next moments to me when I was fully conscious again and could answer questions. That was a week after the incident, seeing as I was in a coma for a while. A neighbor had heard the commotion, since Robbie and I had failed to shut the garage door or the door leading to the basement. The screams scared the neighbor so much, they had called the police. 



Right when Lawrence brought the trophy down on my head for the third time, the cops burst downstairs with tasers and guns drawn and took down both Lawrence and Gill. Lawrence was on the receiving end of the guns and they had done too much damage for the paramedics to save him. Lawrence’s final moments consisted of him laughing and chanting, that same line being repeated over and over. *Una magis anima pro domino*. Gill though, lived, as he was the lucky one to catch the prongs from the tasers. He was taken to jail immediately after being fixed up at the hospital, although I heard he was telling a different version of what I had of the night.



The police found Darryl in the bathroom, in the tub to be exact. They believe that Lawrence had lured him in somehow, before doing the deed. I think that Lawrence and Gill had chosen between us who would be whose victim, which is why they attacked us at different intervals.



I found out later in the hospital and from the subsequent criminal investigation what had happened to cause them to become murderous beings. Lawrence and Gill had made it to Thailand, but witnesses had seen them get into a car with three Englishmen, dressed all fancy apparently, the first night in Bangkok. The next time any CCTV or witnesses caught any sight of the friends were when they were dropped off at the airport by the same car. They left all their luggage at the hotel along with all their money. They had 13 days of unaccounted for time. The authorities believe that this is all unrelated. I have pleaded with them to take it seriously and to investigate it, but they ignore me. I have tried telling my doctors or anyone who comes to see me, that there is something more to this situation than men going crazy.



The cops had searched their apartments, finding that Gill had actually been staying at Lawrence’s place since their return. The walls were covered in Latin, with phrases mentioning a master and the payments that were required. It was discovered the chant that Gil and Lawrence were saying, una magis anima pro domino, was in fact “One more soul for the master.” The police also found out that the two had taken to walking the streets of Chicago at night, but haven’t investigated that matter any further.  The cops and detectives all believe that Gill and Lawrence were lovers, whose strain of hiding their relationship caused Lawrence to snap and force Gill into the crimes, that murdering us friends was the only way to keep their relationship a secret. The police refuse to investigate any unsolved murders, and tell me that Lawrence had just gone crazy and while Gill was complicit in the crimes, he was a victim just as well. Gill had apparently admitted all this, crying and breaking down how he did not want to hurt anyone. It was all Lawrence. Gill claimed that he was actually trying to protect me after Lawrence had attacked the others. He was trying to hit Lawrence with a trophy, not me. Gill claims that Lawrence had committed all the murders and that he was the "master". The police seem to believe him, because I heard that he is only being charged with battery and kidnapping.



It’s all a lie or the authorities are just grasping at straws. They were not lovers, nor did they go crazy. Gill was just as guilty as Lawrence for those atrocities. There was something different about them that night. Gill’s eyes are apparently normal now, because the police believed I was hallucinating and misremembering facts due to the head trauma. When I explained the blackness and the spreading evil in the veins, they said that Gill said I would be saying that. That I had been screaming about blackness and eyes while Lawrence attacked me. I sit here in the hospital, assured by the police that Gill is in jail and is not intent on harming me. That is a lie.



I have been here at the hospital for 14 days, dealing with brain swelling and some terrible damage to my knee. While I was told I’d never walk without a limp and had a chance of continued symptoms from the brain damage, it was not injuries that caused me to begin to worry. I have begun to notice things. Certain hospital staff members have a darkness about their eyes. I feel myself staring at the orderly’s who watch me too much as they enter the room and listening to the door after the RN’s leave the room, whispering to themselves. Doctors say this is the brain swelling causing me to hallucinate. The police believe that my injuries are to blame for my beliefs as well. I swear I can hear “*una magis anima pro domino*” or “one more for the master,” if I listen closely at night. My family thinks the blows to my head have caused me to become unhinged, seeing danger at every turn. But I know the staff are listening to me and staring at me, but they make no move against me.



Gill is in jail, but I don’t think he will stay there. The news has kept the whole situation on the downlow. Nothing has been mentioned on any of the major networks or newspapers nor have any of the tabloids mentioned the incident. I think I can make it out the window and onto the ground without anyone seeing me, if I have to make a move. I still have one good leg, and could make it to at least somewhere with a car and get out of town. The police are in on the lie as well. At least the ones I have been talking to are. They say I am not allowed to leave the hospital at all, for my own safety. It’s all a lie, that I know.  
  


I can make a run, but I don’t know how long. I may have a brain injury, I know that but I am not crazy. I know what I saw and what actually happened that night. I know the truth. 



I have to go now. I hear a commotion down the hall. It sounds like someone singing. Or maybe chanting. 

*Una magis anima pro domino*. That is all I hear now. *One more for the master*.
