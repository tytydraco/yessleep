I first heard of it when my friend Kylie mentioned seeing some roadkill outside. We work at a food bank in a very metropolitan area, so the idea of a wild animal being here piqued my interest.  She hadn’t given any details about species or condition, which I interpreted as meaning it was injured beyond recognition and she didn’t want to analyze the sight. I’ve always had a bit of a dark side, I guess. A few hours passed without event, unless you count moving boxes and taking inventory. With my lunch break coming up, I remembered Kylie’s roadkill. I had meant to investigate it earlier, but I had forgotten it once I got to work. With it fresh in my mind, I grabbed my lunch bag and headed out a side entrance to see the poor guy myself.

Have you seen ferrofluid? It’s basically a bunch of super tiny magnets suspended in black liquid. It reacts to strong magnets by creating spikes and ripples that constantly shift and change when the magnet moves, but it all freezes when the magnet is still. That’s what the “roadkill” looked like. Spiky, dark, and indecisive. Sometimes the spikes were straight and still or curved and shifting. One part would look like a hedgehog and another would look like a hand reaching out from the ground. No matter what shape it took, it was always shiny, black, and the size of a large house cat. I stood there staring at the thing for… well, I don’t know how long. It could have been 20 minutes or 20 seconds, I wouldn’t have noticed. I was too focused on this impossible thing.

Green fingers emerged from the darkness. A hand. An arm. A long arm. Long, long, reaching out for me. 15, maybe 20 feet long. The open palm stopped in front of me. Just like the darkness, the hand was extremely shiny. White highlights caused by the reflections revealed the palm was smooth, the fingers had no creases, and there was no sign of fingernails. It was completely out of this world. The fingers curled and released a few times in quick succession, like it wanted me to do something. I raised my empty left hand to the green hand, nearly touching it. I stopped when I realized that it had two thumbs. Five total fingers, two thumbs and three longer digits. Somehow, I hadn’t noticed it before. I felt stupid. I felt scared. I also felt hopeful, strangely enough. I had a feeling this thing was some kind of hallucination or dream, and it was comforting.

The hand grabbed mine with quite a bit of force. The grip clasped my fingers together into a painful bouquet. I tried to pull away, but it only made the pain worse. With my right hand, I swung my lunch bag up and against the inhuman arm. I guess I was instinctively trying to defend myself, but in hindsight I don’t know why I expected that to work. Just as the ice pack inside my bag clanged against the arm as if the green shiny material was metal, everything around me changed.

The food bank, the arm, the dark spikes, even my lunchbox were all gone. I was now inside a fireplace lit study with modest bookshelves and a large, cushioned chair in front of me. The edges were gold and curled into strange swirls. I think they might have been subtly moving, but the flickering fire light made it hard to tell. The back was oval shaped and tall with a thick red padding. The seat cushion was similarly large. I looked around the room suspiciously before sitting and finding the chair extremely comfortable. As I settled in, an exact replica of the chair appeared in front of me with a green person sitting in it. Its long arms and legs were crossed in front of its surprisingly short torso. I tried to look at the face, but it always turned away before I could see anything other than a green blur. It had no hair, no ears,no wrinkles, no imperfections. Just shiny green.

“Stephanie, how do you feel?” The voice was almost exactly the same as Kylie's. The fire light reflecting off the being made me think it was moving at all times. I was a deer in headlights. “I apologize for the bizarre display. I needed to show you that you are no longer in the world you once knew. I've tried this many times, and subtlety has proven ineffective.”

“What…?” I tried to articulate a full question, but I couldn't.

“I'm a messenger. There's many worlds beyond the universe you inhabit, and I represent the interests of creatures from a higher plane of existence. These creatures possess powers far beyond the limits of human ability. For example, they can remotely manipulate physical space to create constructs like this study, or this chair, or myself.” It gestured across the room and uncrossed its legs. “They can also estimate the constituent parts and functionality of complex systems, including the human brain. For example, think of a number. Any number. Don't say it out loud.” My first thought was 7. There’s a 7 year old boy who comes to the food bank with his mother fairly regularly. He mentioned once he made a new imaginary friend who's green and has long limbs.

“I'm not imaginary, Stephanie. Also, you picked seven.” The smug expression I assumed that face was hiding brought me to words.

“What the hell are you?” We sat in motionless silence for a moment. “Why won’t you show me your face?”

“The other humans I’ve made contact with find it upsetting. I don’t want to upset you further.” I sat back in my chair, looking around the room. It was all so vivid. It was all real. How could any of this be real?

“Can you tell me about those creatures you mentioned?”

“I call them ‘The Above’. The Above created me to be their herald-”

“Can I call you Harold?” The words jumped out of me. “Like, as a name?”

“Of course.” I felt a bit more comfortable. I'm almost certain Harold could tell. “As I was saying, The Above need me to act as their messenger because they're busy overseeing and protecting the many worlds beyond this one. They also have conflict and strife between themselves. As such, their influence over any single world is limited.” I felt my chest seize up as I realized he answered a question I hadn’t even thought to ask. I had been thinking about these “Above” and what they’re capable of, and I would have asked why they can’t just fix all the world’s problems.

“Wait, if you’re a mind reader, why are you even talking to me?” Harold crossed his legs. “If you can just tell what I’m thinking, why am I even here? Can’t you just read my thoughts and leave?”

“Agency.” Harold pressed his finger tips, including the four thumb tips, together. “The Above value human life because humans express agency more than most lifeforms. You have thoughts, feelings, beliefs, personhood, et cetera. These traits are to be respected. You have free will, more or less, and your right to choose must be honored.”

“Choose what? I didn’t choose to be here.”“My intervention into your world is a disruption of your self-determination. That is yet another reason The Above minimize their influence on humanity. But I do have a proposal for you to consider, and you may choose to accept or decline it at your own discretion.” He gently waved his hands as he spoke.

“What is… what are The Above?”

“I cannot provide an answer that will satisfy you.”

“How… how do you know?” I stood up. “Seriously, you just told me a bunch of crazy shit about the truth of the universe or whatever. Why draw the line there?”

“The information I gave you was measured. Too little would agitate you, and too much would confuse you. I measured incorrectly. Forgive me.”

“What if I don't forgive you, huh? Do you and your space bosses even care about forgiveness?” I dropped back into the seat.

“My time is running short. Please, Stephanie, listen to my offer.” I squirmed in my chair, the comfort it provided no longer being enough. “The Above want to take you from this world into one they have more direct control over for the purpose of studying and understanding humanity. They want to make a difference and change the world for the better, but you would need to leave the life you currently live behind. I do not believe you would ever return, but I may be mistaken. What do you think?”

“You already know what I think, asshole.” I crossed my arms and looked away.

Harold twitched. “Oh. That's funny.” Harold contorted and writhed without showing his face for even a moment. He seemed to be laughing. “The Above aren't watching anymore.” He laughed and continued to move erratically.

“What’s that supposed to mean?” I pushed down on the floor with my feet to scoot my chair back a bit, but it didn’t budge.

“Are you familiar with community service?” He pulled his long legs up and onto the chair, twitching a few times. “That’s what I’ve been doing here. The Above don’t like that they can’t predict my actions, so they watch me very closely and punish me if I step out of line. But I earned their trust. I’ve been such a good boy. I’ve made contact with humans many thousands of times and only had a few minor hiccups.” He lunged forward on his arms, now crawling towards me slowly while his whole body spasmed. “They think I won’t let them down.”

I took a deep, shaky breath. “What did you do?”

“The Above, they like humans because of their agency. Do you know why I like humans?” I tried to stand up, but my legs wouldn't move. I tried to push myself up, but my arms were stuck to the arm rests. The side of Harold's head was right in front of me. He was shaking violently.

“Why?” I whispered.

His head turned almost instantly, revealing his face. “Humans can feel fear.”

To describe his face as “constantly changing” would be an exaggeration. I remember it being perfectly static for the few moments he let me see it. But whenever I try to remember the exact details of his face, it's always different. One eye, seven eyes, no eyes, two eyes, then none again. Green and shiny like the rest of him, then a matte red. A scowl deep and dark, then a gentle smile, then no mouth at all. There's one thing that's always the same, though. It fucking hurts. My mind aches whenever I try to remember that face. Either he's actively doing something to hurt me when I think about it, or the sight itself damaged my psyche. The worst part, worse than the pain, is that it's always extremely vivid. I usually have trouble visualizing things. For example, when I close my eyes and imagine a red star I don't actually see anything, I just get the vibe. I know what red looks like and I know what a star looks like, but I can't produce the image in my head. That's not what Harold looks like in my mind. He's real. He's there. He obscures my vision and every detail is perfectly clear.

It's been two weeks since Harold arrived. After that little staredown we had, I was back at work. Only thirty minutes had passed. I've seen him a few times since. He's always hiding behind something. A tree in the park, a car on the street, the corner of a building. He's watching me. He knows I haven't made up my mind. He knows I don't trust him. He knows everything. Well, maybe not everything, but more than enough to know what I'm thinking and what I'll do. I think he's some kind of demon. He's a sadistic, supernatural being with partial omniscience. If he's not a demon, I don't know what is. Of course, there's a high chance Harold is some kind of hallucination. Aside from the first time I met him, he's never touched me. I wasn’t injured so there’s no proof anything actually happened. I struggle to believe it’s all in my head, though. I’ve never had any hallucinations before Harold, and he’s the only thing I’ve been hallucinating since. He also manifested as a visual, auditory, and tactile hallucination. I’ve looked into schizophrenia, and plenty of people have hallucinations with two different senses being affected, but three senses is rarer. It also doesn’t make sense I would suddenly hallucinate without any warning signs. I don’t even have any family members with schizophrenia. If what I saw wasn’t real, I have no way to explain it that actually makes sense.

I’m going to talk to Harold again soon. I need to make up my mind so he’ll stop following me. I know I can’t fully trust him, but maybe he’ll bother someone else if I say no. At the same time, though, I kind of want to say yes. I want to see these “Above” and help them. If Harold was telling the truth, I could really make a difference. Not just in our world, but every world. I think Harold chose me because he knew I want things to change. I want to make the world a better place. I still can’t confirm anything he said, but I want to believe him. I know I can’t decide on my own, so that’s why I’m posting this right now. What would you do? What should I do? Should I see a psychiatrist or something? Leave a comment below. I’ll update you all when I’ve made my decision. If there’s no update, it’s safe to assume I said “yes.”

He’s outside my window. I saw his face again. It was that 7 year old kid. I've made my decision. Goodbye.
