I’ll make this bit short and sweet. I doubt you folks want to hear my life story, so I’ll just cut to the chase. 

I’ve spent the past nearly 30 years - oh hell, it’ll be 30 years next year, working as a caretaker for an old abandoned sanatorium. Technically we’d call it a psychiatric hospital here, but it’s about a 45 minute drive from a mid-size city here in the UK. 

I won’t tell you which one or its exact location, but chances are you might have come across it on one of those paranormal ghost hunting shows that are so popular, although God only knows why. 

Charlie - that’s my nephew - tells me that people on this forum love to hear all about the unexplained and creepy shit and I’ve stockpiled plenty of those over the past 3 decades of slaving my life away for barely any pension worth a damn. 

You might be wondering what the point of a caretaker is if the sanatorium is already shut down? You’d be right to ask, since it’s not been operational since about the 1950s. It opened in the 1790s and throughout the 19th century, it was used to treat things like tuberculosis, the clinically insane were kept here for safety and far away from the public and some unfortunate women were treated for what was then known as “hysteria”.

I wouldn’t be surprised with the current administration across the pond if that’s the direction things might be headed again. 

Anyway, I’m getting sidetracked. 

Several years after it closed, the sanatorium was originally meant to be turned into one of those haunted house attractions, but it was soon found out that the renovation would be too expensive and so those plans were abandoned. 

For a brief point in time, the local council decided it could be used as a museum and that lasted a couple of years or so before they realised that there wasn’t enough interest from the public due its location and some individuals had voiced health and safety concerns. 

Given that it’s a historically listed building, it’s basically a criminal offense to demolish it and the council figured they might as well keep it and let mother nature do its job. Not wanting to get in trouble for neglect or making it easy for other people to damage, it was decided that a caretaker was needed. 

Enter yours truly. 

Now, you might be asking yourself - why on earth would you choose to do a job like that? Doesn’t it get lonely? Don’t you get scared? The honest answer is - no - I don’t. If I had to spend the rest of my days working in an office hearing about what Nicki did on the weekend with her kids or that Alan’s wife has taken up painting and she’s actually rather good and I should come around for tea, I’d sooner rather die early. 



Gosh, I promised to make it short didn’t I? 

Anyway, that just about covers it, though. My  job is to make sure nothing or nobody unwanted gets in.  

Where do I start with the weird stuff? The thing is, after a while, you get so used to it that it becomes normal and sometimes it’s hard to distinguish the normal-weird to the “what-the-fuck-is-happening.” weird, but I’ll do my best. 



\- I’d only been working at the sanatorium about a week or so when I had my first, I guess “supernatural” encounter. It still feels weird calling it that, because I’ve always been a skeptic. After all, I did my degree in biomedical sciences and always firmly believed what I can see and what I can touch. My shifts are usually a mix between night shifts and day shifts, but as you can imagine, not a lot of people tend to break into places in broad daylight. 

Night shifts typically start around 10PM and finish in the wee hours and it’s usually a steady patrol around the property, starting on the ground floor, working my way to the basement, then up to the first and second floor.  Rinse and repeat and it makes for a very boring 8 hours, so I usually pack a book, some crosswords. A couple of Christmases ago, my sister’s family gifted me one of those Nintendo switches because I rather like those farming games and it’s an easy way to kill time.

I was about 4 hours into my shift and ready for my second cup of coffee to stay awake. The little office I sat in was maybe one of the few rooms in the entire building not deteriorating at quite the same rate as the rest of the place. It had everything I needed; a relatively comfy chair to snooze on, some decrepit, very of their time WWII propaganda booklets to read and my digital farm. 

I must have nodded off at some point because I woke up to what felt like someone tugging at my trouser pockets. When I looked up, there was nobody there and the room got really chilly, as if I’d stepped into one of those industrial freezer rooms. Against my better judgement I decided to ignore it, but a few seconds later I heard laughter. 

Children’s laughter. 

“Hello? Anyone there?” I called out as if anyone would reply. 

I got up and investigated the source of the sound and as I walked out into the main foyer, I saw what looked like a small child running up the stairs to the first floor and then it stopped. I ran after it, but once I got up to the first floor there was nobody there. Believe me, I checked every bloody room. 

I brushed that first encounter off as being just a bit sleep deprived and not yet used to night shift work, but those children’s laughter and running footsteps became almost a recurring phenomenon. These days, I don’t even give it a second thought because there are far worse things lurking within the walls of that place. 



\- When I started working in the mid to late 90s, YouTube didn’t exist. However, once in a while film crews making documentaries on the paranormal wanted to come and spend a few hours looking around the sanatorium. 

I never understood why the owners agreed to it, but I think it was an easy way to get a bit of money. These film crews were all the same, just in it for the sake of entertainment and not because they actually believed in ghosts. They always brought with them those fake mediums, always putting on a show for the camera.  

I was tasked with showing them around the building and the medium that worked for this particular crew was different from the others I’d met. She seemed more level-headed and a bit withdrawn. She’d said nothing throughout the tour, but when we got to the second floor, she stopped in the doorway to what was the old nurses’ sleeping quarters. 

She stayed there for a while, just silent and as one of her colleagues was about to see if she was okay, she spoke. 

“He’ll never stop coming.” she said, her voice low and perfectly calm, “He’ll never stop coming.” 

And then just like that, she snapped out of it. I’ll never forget the look in her eyes when we asked her who she was talking about and I wouldn’t understand it myself until much later.   


\- It’s not uncommon for people - especially kids - to go missing around here. As you can imagine, abandoned buildings like this are popular amongst not only urban explorers, but teenagers messing around. 

In the early 2000s, maybe around 2003, I got a call from the local police station saying a kid was missing and asked if I could help find him. It’s usually always the same, a group of kids break in, see who can last the longest before they get spooked and one of them gets left behind. 

This wasn’t one of those times. Apparently, a family was camping in the campground not far from the hospital and when the parents woke up to see their son missing, they called the police.   
I found the kid, pressed up against the wall in the basement scared out of his mind and when I asked what had happened, he told me the man in the Tweed said to come meet his friends and when they got here, he’d been left alone, except for the company of a little boy who’d run around laughing. 



\- Now, the Man in Tweed….just thinking about him sends shivers down my spine. The first time I met him was about a few years into my contract. I’d parked up my car as I always did and unloaded my stuff when I noticed someone standing on the front porch of the building. 

He was an odd bloke; wearing a pair of brown tweed trousers and a matching suit, with a pocket watch hanging out from his right pocket and a cigar in the other. 

“You alright, mate?” I called out, “Can I help you?” 

“You must be Alan?” said the stranger confidently, “Your boss told me I’d find you here. I’m the surveyor.”

I immediately knew it was bullshit, because if there’s one thing my boss is good at, it’s keeping me in the loop with what’s going on. Not to mention that I sure as hell know there is no surveying being done of the property. 

“At this time of night?” I asked

“Oh right, yeah.” the stranger scratched his head, “This is really embarrassing, but I was here earlier with your boss and left my bag inside and I need it for work so if you could just let me in so that I can grab it real quick and be out of your hair?” 

Something about the way he smiled as he looked at me seemed…almost uncanny and every inch of my body told me this was a bad idea. 

“I’m really sorry, but if anything was left in there my boss would have told me. I’ll have a look on my shift and if I find something I can hand it into the office and you can pick it up from there. Unfortunately I can’t let anyone inside as we have rules to follow and I’m sure you’ll appreciate that.”

A silence lingered between us and the expression in the stranger’s face shifted to something between annoyed and amused. 



“Man of principle” he chuckled, “I respect that. Alright, I’ll be on my way. Let me know if you find something.”

“Will do.” I promised

“I’ll be seeing you very soon, Alan.” 

The man lifted his hat and walked off into the woods. I realised then that there was no other car parked and no conceivable way that he could have easily gotten here. I rang my boss not long afterwards and he confirmed my fears. He’d never scheduled an appointment with a surveyor and hadn’t been to the property for a few days. He told me to let him know if this stranger showed up again and I said I would. The moment I hung up my phone I suddenly recalled what that psychic medium had said. 

“He’ll never stop coming.”



Oh shit, is that the time? I got a bit carried away, but I hope you’ve enjoyed reading some of these stories. It’s actually nice getting them off my chest. If you have any questions or want me to share some more let me know. I wish we’d have had the internet and forums like this back when I first started.
