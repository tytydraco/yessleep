A lot has happened these last few days, that’s for sure. The strings of this, haunting, are starting to come undone, and I think in coming to a conclusion on what’s happening with my own home.

The rain pelted the windshield of my truck like a million microscopic machine gun rounds, drumming their own dreary beat as we carefully climbed the road up to the cabin. We reached the last curve, and as we rounded the climb, we began to see the house come into view.

I pulled us up into the gravel spot where I had parked us before, and opened my door to hop out. The silver cross around my neck felt cold against my skin in the wet summer air. My rain coat made slick plastic sounds as the material rubbed together whenever I took a step. Samantha followed behind me, eyes wide and observant. She carried a plastic box of various spices, herbs, candles, and blessings to set up around the house.

I came to the door, but stopped in my tracks before opening it. Nailed to our door with a small project nail was an envelope. There was an ornate purple seal on the front, bearing a knight carrying a blazing sword, with some, what I can only imagine is a prayer language, or maybe Latin, written around the rim of the seal.

“Hey, Samantha, you recognize where that’s from?” I turn around and ask her.

“Uh, no, I don’t recognize that seal. I didn’t know anyone still sent letters?”

“Glad to see all hope isn’t lost yet.” I said, pulling the envelope off the nail, ripping it slightly. I pocketed it for later.

The black stuff was still on the doorknob, now dryer but somehow more sticky. I used a rag from my coat pocket to turn the doorknob.

The door creaked open, and the house was silent. I took a step through the threshold, into the still air.

I remember checking the house as throughly as I could, but I don’t think I ever saw anything out of the ordinary.

Once I was sure the house was safe, I went over to the kitchen table, and pulled out a seat. I sat down, sighed, and ripped open the letter. Besides when I tripped down the stairs of our old house while moving some boxes last month, that might have been the least graceful thing I’ve done.

The letter was written in Latin. I can’t read it,  but after going back through some of the facts of the situation, I remembered the locks on the chest. I almost started to get up to go out and look at the chest, before remembering it had been swallowed by the earth itself. I don’t know what any of this says, and Google translate won’t translate from the picture I scanned in. I’d paste it here for you guys if I knew how to type this stuff.

The rest of that evening carried on without any issues. We blessed the house before sundown, pulled down the shutters on all the windows, and went through the house to check that everything was locked at least three times.

The sun disappeared behind the horizon at around 7:15, and by 8, we were already locked up in the upstairs guest room. The guest room only has a door, no windows or access to the outside besides the door. I tried to fall asleep, but it took a while. I was thinking about the shed, and the bottomless pit now dug into the earth, that happens to set your blood on fire and force it out your head. At the time, I didn’t understand the implications of that. Of my never ending thoughts of the shed and the chest.

I drifted off around 9, while thinking about the hole.

I was woken up by Samantha at about 4 AM the next morning. 

“Hey, Thomas, Tommy, wake up,” she shook my arm.

“What’s up, I’m awake,” I said, half asleep.

“Someone’s outside the house.” She said, eyes wide open in a stern tone into my ear.

I was wide awake.

I craned my head towards the door, listening to the sounds downstairs. The fog of sleep began to pull back from my ears, and I almost wish that they hadn’t in that moment.

“Tommy, honey, come back to bed!” I whipped my head around, placing my hand on Samantha, she was deathly still. I didn’t say a word, and when she went to speak, I shook my head.

“Tommy, where,” a break in the voice, it got deeper and steelier “did you go! Did you go! Damnit.” The voice was a man, with a Yukon accent, not dissimilar to the one I heard from the voice.

“You’ll die, you dumb son of a bitch! I’m going to kill you!” 

“Tommy,” I felt Samanthas cold hand on my shoulder, “I’m scared..” She was fighting back tears.

There were no words I had to comfort her.

“Let me in the house, Daddy, please!” 

My entire body froze. A little girls voice. Young, less than 7 years old.

It was after that small voice erupted that I started asking myself, how could we hear those voices so clearly from our room. As the thought ran through my head, literally as my neurons fired to form that thought, a knock rang from my window. I ripped around towards the back wall, but as I did, I realized I was staring at a flat wall. 

Another knock, and my ears told me the sound came from higher. The roof. Someone, or, something, was on our roof.

I prayed. It’s all I could think to do.

We listened in horror as disembodied voices sang from our roof until around 7 AM, when the sun finally came up. We sat locked in the guest room for another hour. We spent as much of our time on Wednesday outside of the house as we could.

In the afternoon, we picked up some snacks from the grocer in town, and then hit the road to head to a bigger town about 70 miles away.

When we got there, we met with the priest Laura, Samantha’s mom, had called to help us. He was a pretty cheerful, and was excited to see the situation. Neither me nor Samantha shared his excitement.

He walked us into his office at the back of the church. He gestured for us to take a seat, and he sat down behind a wide walnut desk. It had detailed swirls and patterns along its edges.

“Alright, uh, welcome Mr. and Mrs. (Not a chance, internet) God bless. I’ve heard some about your situation, and I have to be honest, I’m intrigued. I’ve never seen or heard of anything like this.”

“Well, we are glad you’re interested in helping us solve this.” I wasn’t too happy about someone being excited about our stress.

“So, let’s start from the beginning, with what I’ve found. Yes?” I nodded. “Good, well. Grant was founded as Oliver Post in 1872,  and renamed to Grant Post in 1879. Apparently it was a little family feud between Oliver Murphys family and the current mayor, Killian Grant. Grant ended up spreading a rumor to the town that the Murphy family were all practicians of witch craft and black magic. Local legend claims that after Oliver was found dead in the woods not too far from where you live now, his son Josiah got into talks with the Utes, and had the land cursed. The Murphy family packed up and ran north and west, with the last known records of them being letters sent back to the town of Grant in 1910, all written in what was then considered the tongues of the devil, and is now deciphered as Ute. Where they learned it is still a mystery.”

I thought for a moment to absorb what I had heard, before speaking up.

“So, what does the Rules forum I emailed you about have to do with this?” The priest, whose name was Percy, fixed his round glasses on his nose, and rubbed his chin in thought.

“I’m not sure,” he began, “but most of it seems to me as though the author was trying to create a set of guidelines for repelling whatever curse the Utes and Murphys left on the region.” He asked for me to read them to him again, which I did, and he simply confirmed what he had said before.

“Yes, all those rules are good practices for holding this at bay.”

“Alright, but what can we do to get rid of this, permanently?”

He sighed,

“There’s not much I can imagine besides nailing a crucifix to every tree in the woods. Or, at least in the areas you want to protect. Demons that prey on fear like this are often hard to remove, as any attempt to get rid of them that isn’t done purely out of honor and bravery will only aid them.”

“What about the hole?”

“Ah, yes,” he thought for a moment, “that’s something interesting in and of itself. The hole, by all accounts, doesn’t seem to be related to the demon or demons present at your property. The pit is something unholy itself.”

We ended up talking with him a bit longer, but ultimately decided to accept his blessing and the items he sent back with us, which were 2 crosses and a few letters drenched with holy water that held prayers on them. He said to pray those prayers every day, and sent us dry copies of them too.

We got back to Grant just after midnight on Thursday. As we rode up the road in the dark, I continuously checked the roadside, not for deer, but for anything surveying us, watching us. 

We pulled into the driveway, my trucks lights falling over the house and yard.

What happened next happened almost too swiftly to describe.

As the lights fell across the yard, casting long and deep shadows across the ground, my eyes paused on one spot.

Behind the house, about 80 yards away from the truck, stood a man. He was naked, but had no, features. Just a mouth. His limbs were horribly disfigured, with scars and tight or ripped skin covering a gaunt form. He had a large mop of black, dirty hair. He was staring, despite having no eyes, at the shed. I kept the truck still for a moment, just watching him. Samantha started to cry, like genuinely break down and cry, in the passenger seat. I placed a hand over her mouth, and put the truck into park.

I reached between my seat, and pulled the Shadow Systems from in between the seat. I was looking down during this. As I turned around to grab one of the crucifixes from the back seat, Samantha, her own hand on her mouth, whimpered and shook me,

“Ho-honey. Tommy. Thomas. There’s more.”

I was sitting on my knees, turned backwards in the seat. I sat back down, so swiftly it hurt my tail bone, and looked down the path of the lights. There was 2 more of those things on all fours, crawling out of the underbrush towards the shed. Then 4 more behind them. 

Eventually, before us stood 15 or so of these things. All staring at the shed. I clutched my pistol in my hand, not sure what good I thought it would do. 

We sat silently, but both almost screamed when on unison, 4 of them turned towards us. They crept around the house, their bodies close to the earth, like ungodly panthers. 

They started to sniff the air.

One of them stopped onto their knees, and put the head up in the air. His (I’m assuming they are he’s) mouth hung open, like an opera singer, before a sound cut across the yard.

“Gross.” It was my voice, but louder.

That’s what I said when I opened the cellar. I’ve been watched since that day. And I didn’t even know.

“Oh come on.” The voice coming from its mouth was a young kid, maybe Clays age.

“If they come to open the doors, I want you to run for the door to the house, alright?” I said to Samantha, trying to be quiet. She nodded, wiping her eyes. I took a deep breath, and then unlocked the doors. My blood was pounding in my head.

I pushed open the door, and shot the closest one in the head.

The gunshot echoed over the mountain. It dropped dead.

The others all raised their heads, and started speaking. All at once. 

I couldn’t remember everything they said. Some spoke in women’s voices, in men’s, in kids. Some in other languages. It sounded similar to a swamp full of frogs singing their midnight nothings.

I immediately turned around to Samantha, and yelled over the sound, “INSIDE!”.

She through the door open and bolted, I followed closely behind. 

About halfway to the door, I heard hands pounding on the ground. I kept running for the door. 

A hand grabbed onto my leg with unnatural strength, and pulled.

In slow motion, I was heaved into the air, and thrown.

I saw a blur of pale flesh writhing towards the door of my home below me.

I saw Samantha running to the door, and looking back for me. She didn’t close it in time.

My back slammed into the hood of the truck. I sat dazed for a second, before, by the grace of God, I slide myself off the hood, landing on the ground. I got up on my knees, then forced myself up. I was about 20 yards away from the door, set all the way back to the truck. I could hear the cacophony of voices yelling in my house, and needed to do something. I ran up the porch, and picked up the pistol on the way in. I grabbed a flower vase from the kitchen island as I ran through the kitchen. I hit the first step, and was met with one of them at the top. I put two rounds into its upper chest, I was working under my new found knowledge that these things die like men. I ran up the stairs, nearly slipping on the monsters blood running down the steps. As I reached the top of the steps, I was hit with the weight of one of them launching itself through the air at me. I hit the hardwoods, the gun sliding across the floor. I turned back from the gun, and focused my attention at the now 4 threats on hand, as one from downstairs had ran up them, and was climbing along the banisters like a twisted cat. The other three were gnawing at me as I kicked and shouted at them.

“GET BACK, NOW!”

“GET BACK,” my own voice, mockingly called back to me, “or I’ll kill you! I’ll kill you!”

I kicked it in the teeth as it held its maw open. It stumbled back, nearly knocking one of its pack mates down with it. I used this second to turn on my back, and scramble for the gun. 

Their hands sunk into my back as I did. I yelped in pain, but still reached for the gun. I swung it around, firing towards the banister. I didn’t see the thing fall, but I heard a heavy thud below me. I fired at the one I had kicked, but it bit towards my leg, and I pulled my body back, shanking the shot into its shoulder, grazing it. Angered, it pounced towards me, and I squeezed off a round before it landed on me. The weight of a full grown man, and then some, crushed against my chest. The 2 now stood over me, making hisses and groans from their mouths. I heard the gallops of the rest of them swarming from other areas of the house.

I’ve been scared before in my life, even convinced I was good as dead. But with these things, staring down at me with blank faces, mouths full of teeth. I didn’t imagine I’d survive. 

As the floor below me gave away, those feelings of dread were only suspended for enough time for me to descend.

I hit the bathroom tile below, my left side landing first, followed by my head dinging off the porcelain of the tub. One of the bodies slid down after me, tearing the pink shower curtain off with it. Its body crumpled into the tub. 

The bathroom was dark, with only the minimal light from the mirror light that ran on a clock. Looking up into the hole in the floor, I saw nothing. No more faces, no more monsters. I didn’t hear them either.

In fact, “their” voices had fallen silent.

Only one sound rose above the crickets outside. Something burning.

I laid on the floor for a few more seconds, before the darkness of the roof above me was broken by a red light. 

I heard footsteps above me, and then they stopped.

Samantha peered her head over the hole. She had one of the emergency flares from the blizzard kit she had bought, paranoid we’d be snowed in one day with a category 5 avalanche on the way, or however you guys in the avalanche biz must grade them.

Besides the point, I sighed when I saw her, before I saw that despite the tears on her face, and her smeared make up, she was grinning.

A few minutes later, we had locked the front door back and burned the herbs we had bought back when we had stayed the night at the motel.

I was sitting on the couch with ice on my back, and Samantha was sitting across from me, pouring hydrogen peroxide on her cuts, and bandaging them. She winced every time any of the peroxide touched the wounds, and she did this for about 10 minutes, before she had rinsed and bandaged everything. We both had a gun near us.

I don’t remember falling asleep that night, but I remember waking up.

Upon waking up, we had our first normal morning in a long time. I was up first, and made coffee and brought it back upstairs to Fort Grant, which was just the guest bedroom, now with a pitfall trap included just next door.

I handed Samantha her cup, then I sat down on the chair in the corner of the room. 

The rest of the day carried on normally, besides the whole dragging the bodies of supernatural creatures out to the burn pit and reducing them to unholy ash, until about 3 in the afternoon.

I decided I needed to go look out at the shed again, so I went to the master bedroom for the first time since the night the chest was swallowed into the abyss. I retrieved my AR15, not wanting to chance it with stopping power. I brought with me a bigger and better light, plus the one on my gun, and a lot of good climbing rope. Plus, I had on long sleeves and pants, and tried to cover all my skin with rag, gloves, a painting respirator, and a pair of goggles.

I went down into the hole.

It wasn’t as deep as I thought it was, only about 25 feet, and it sloped out where it wasn’t a flat drop.

The depth wasn’t my concern. It was the tunnel that connected to the hole.

As the hole opened up into a tunnel at the bottom, I noticed that the walls were covered in vein-like growths covered in the same black blood I’ve seen everywhere since moving into the house.

As I continued walking down the tunnel, I reached parts I had to crawl through. As I did, I felt my body squish into the walls and floor, popping the vessels as I did. It was like crawling down the mouth of an animal and waiting for it to swallow you whole. 

I continue for as far as I could before I ran out of rope to find my way back, and so I turned back to follow the rope back to the exit. 

About halfway back, I know because my rope has different colors each 50 feet, I started hearing the voices. At first, it was just the Yukon lady. Then, after probably another 30 feet, a man joined in. Every 20 or 30 feet, another voice joined the chorus.

By the time I reached the exit, I could hardly hear myself think. 

I tugged on the rope, preparing to climb,

And it fell at my feet. The hole was covered with dirt.

I crawled up the side of the tunnel, bracing my legs against the walls, and started hitting and digging as hard as I could. As the dirt gave way, so did the wood above me.

The floor of the shed caved in on me, and behind the floor came the chest. 

It landed on the dirt below me. I slowly lowered myself down, and tied rope to one of the handles on the sides. I climbed back up, and pulled myself just barely out of the hole. With just my head and hands above the hole, I looked around. 

In front of me, almost blending into the dark of the night, stood a dark shape. It was vaguely humanoid, but I wasn’t sure about what it was beyond that. The edges of its form were grainy and loose, floating around in the air like they were weightless. The figure got closer, and peered over the hole. Out of the ether of the night and the figures face, a bright light burned my eyes. I heard the figure mumble, before I heard a screech. The light vanished as soon as it had arrived, and I was left clueless of what I had witnessed. I crawled all the way out as fast as I could, and looked around outside the shed. Without me noticing instantly, the moon had rapidly set and the sun had swiftly rose. It was the same over cast afternoon as I had climbed into the hole during, just a while ago. I scratched my head, then turned back to the hole. 

I tied the rope to a tree about 10 yards away from the shed, and used it as a brace to pull the chest up. When I saw it firmly and securely set on the ground, I let go of the rope.

Samantha met me at the door, and helped me carry it out to the concrete pad beside the house, where we park the truck.

I went to the tool box in the bed of my truck, found some bolt cutters, and decided to open the chest once and for all.

Once I pulled the dusty wooden lid open, I was disappointed when I found,

Ashes. Nothing but grey ashes.

I sighed, and turned away from the lid. Samantha was standing behind me.

“Wow. That whole chest and for what? Some charcoal?”

“Yeah, I suppose. There’s gotta be more to this. Why else would they lock it behind these chains and hide it in the cellar?”

“Yeah, I’m not sure.”

We found out this morning, we found out exactly why the chest had those ashes in it.

When I walked out to check on the shed again this morning, AR in hand, I noticed the burn pit on my way around. The ashes of the monsters were now covered in wriggling white strings. At first I thought they were maggots.

In curiosity, I took a few steps closer.

In further study, I noticed small strings of red ran across the surface of the pile.

And then I noticed a solid white chunk, about the size of my finger nail. It was half of a tooth. 

The things were regrowing, like bacteria.

I called Samantha out to look at it, and we decided to burn the ashes again.

A few hours after the fire died down, Samantha had the idea to compare the ashes in the chest to the ashes in the burn pit.

Near identical match. 

We spent the rest of today shoveling through the ashes, which was easier said than done, and then burned them down one more time in the chest, making sure not to burn the outside too much. It seems like the inside has some kind of fireproof coating.

Last night, so far, was one of the most terrifying thus far. 

Around 8PM, we heard the copy cat voices from outside, but they were muffled. A few of them had regrown enough inside the chest that they could moan and speak again, and I could only imagine that they were pissed.

At this point, we’ve become so accustomed to it, that we just fell back asleep.

Around 10PM, Samantha woke me up.

“Tommy, honey, I think they are trying to get out.”

As I woke up, I listened, and sure enough, heard banging and scratching coming from the chest. I sighed, and sat up on the side of the bed.

“Grab the shotgun.” I instructed her. She nodded, and got up and crossed the room. She put on her sneakers when she got them, and I got my boots from the rack by the front door. I walked out first, with my headlamp shining through the night. I walked with the AR in Indian carry, which for those who don’t know, is a way of carrying your rifle on criss-crossed arms so you can bring it up and have standing support easier.

Samantha walked out behind me, but she was holding a flashlight.

We walked around the side of the house, and to the concrete pad.

The chest rattled, but as we got closer, as if the chest could tell we were there, it stopped its movement.

And from inside came a voice. That same little girls voice from before.

“Dad, please, let me inside!”

“No, not today,” I walked over to the chest, took a deep breath, and opened it. 

Inside lay a pile of assorted gore and viscera. A jaw here, half a brain here, a puddle of blood in the corner. Just a mess. I put my hand towards Samantha, asking for the lighter.

“Here.” She handed it to me.

I remembered I forgot the gasoline, and walked back to the porch to get it.

When I got back around the side of the house, Samantha wasn’t there. I debated whether I should give my voice to the things again, and chose that it was my only option, but I had an idea.

“SAMMY!” A nickname I’ve never used before. “SAMMY!” I turned and shouted into the wood line now.

Nothing. 

I decided that I had to finish what I had started either way, and hastily poured the gasoline while looking over my shoulder as often as I could. 

I placed the ignited lighter against a stick, and let the stick catch a significant fire to it. I dropped the burning stick into the chest and slammed the lid shut, locking it back.

With my flashlight still on, I panned around the yard, and called out again, 

“SAMMY!”

No response from the woods.

I decided to walk around the back of the house, making sure to watch my back as I did.

The light fell across the backyard, and I saw Samantha standing in front of the shed.

Her hand was placed out, a black figure standing in front of her. It was reaching for her hand, to shake it.

I ran over to her, as I did, I called out to her,

“SAMANTHA! WHAT ARE YOU DOING!”

She didn’t turn to look at me. She clasped her hand in the figures and shook.

The figure vanished as I reached her, pulling her towards the house. She screamed, and yelled for me before realizing I was already pulling on her wrist.

“We have to burn the shed!” She said, in between her tears.

“What?”

“We have to get rid of it,”

I stopped, and turned back to the shed. I looked where the figure once stood, and thought about what she had said.

“Ok, we will, tomorrow. Just head up to the house.”

She vomited the black blood when she got in the door. It sparked and burned on our kitchen tile. 

When the sun came up the next day, we took her to the town doctor’s office. They said that, by all accounts and tests, she just had a bad stomach bug. I didn’t try to explain the black blood to them, and left it at “a little bit of blood in the vomit”.

Probably my worst mistake, 

She’s spent all day today in bed. Every second she’s in the house she’s been throwing up, more and more of that black, corrupt bile. 

I got into contact with the priest, again, and he’s coming up to the house as soon as he can, with some Ute medicine men to try and bless the house with everything they’ve got.

The blisters on my face, by the way, have stopped getting worse, but have left nasty scar tissue behind their wake. I’m worried sick about Samantha, and I know that I have to get to the bottom of this. 

I’m going to the tunnel again. I’m going deeper
