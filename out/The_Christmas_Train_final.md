Part 3

I spun around, the conductor’s hand still gripping my shoulder. His face loomed close, his eyes now pits of blackness that seemed to swallow the dim light. His grin was wider than ever, too wide, his teeth sharp like shards of broken candy canes.  

“You think you can leave?” he hissed, his voice a guttural growl that vibrated in my chest. “You’ve tasted the spirit of the Noelium. You’re part of it now.”  

“No!” I shouted, wrenching free from his grasp. My shoulder ached, but I didn’t stop to think. I shoved the door open and leapt through, slamming it shut behind me.  

The golden light enveloped me, momentarily blinding. When my vision cleared, I found myself standing on the narrow platform between two train cars. The foggy world outside rushed past, dark and featureless, but the icy wind that whipped at my face was real. I looked down and saw the tracks below, stretching into nothingness.  

The train jolted, nearly throwing me off balance. I turned back to the door, half expecting the conductor to burst through, but it remained closed. My breath came in short, frantic gasps, forming clouds in the frigid air.  

“This isn’t real,” I whispered to myself, clutching the icy railing for support. “It can’t be real.”  

But the cold metal beneath my fingers and the relentless roar of the train told me otherwise.  

I turned to the next car, where the golden light still shone faintly through the windows. With no other choice, I stepped forward and opened the door.  

The car was different from the others—clean, warm, and quiet. A Christmas tree stood in the center, its ornaments glimmering softly, its lights casting a comforting glow. A single chair sat beside the tree, and on it was a gift-wrapped box tied with a crimson bow.  

For a moment, I hesitated. Everything about the room felt… normal. Inviting, even.  

But the memory of the conductor’s grin lingered in my mind.  

I crept closer, my steps cautious, my eyes darting around the room for any sign of movement. The box sat still, its ribbon perfectly tied. A small card was attached, and though I didn’t touch it, I could read the words from where I stood:  

**“To You, From the Spirit of Christmas.”**  

My instincts screamed at me to leave, but curiosity gnawed at the edges of my fear. Trembling, I reached for the box.  

“Don’t open it.”  

The voice came from behind me—soft, but unmistakable. I whirled around and saw one of the other children standing in the doorway. It was the boy I had noticed earlier, the one who had barely spoken. His face was pale, his eyes wide with terror.  

“It’s a trap,” he whispered. “If you open it, you’ll never leave.”  

“What is this place?” I asked, my voice shaking.  

He hesitated, glancing over his shoulder as if expecting someone to appear. “It’s not what it seems. The Noelium isn’t Christmas—it’s something else, something ancient. It lures children with promises of joy, but it feeds on us. It keeps us here forever.”  

The weight of his words settled over me like a suffocating blanket. My legs felt weak, and I staggered back from the box. “How do we escape?”  

His gaze darkened. “I don’t know. No one ever has.”  

The train jolted again, and the lights flickered. The boy’s head snapped toward the door, his face twisting in fear.  

“He’s coming,” he said. “Run!”  

Without another word, he bolted, disappearing into the next car.  

I didn’t hesitate. I followed him, my heart pounding, the golden room vanishing behind me as I plunged deeper into the train. The cars grew darker and colder, the air thick with the scent of rust and decay.  

“Come back!” the conductor’s voice boomed, echoing through the walls. “You belong here!”  

I ran faster, my breath coming in ragged gasps, my boots slipping on the icy floor. The boy was nowhere in sight, but I didn’t stop. Ahead of me, a faint light flickered—a glimmer of hope in the darkness.  

I reached the final car, its walls warped and broken. The light came from an open door at the end, leading to the outside world. The train was slowing, its wheels screeching against the tracks.  

The conductor’s voice was closer now, his footsteps pounding behind me.  

“You can’t escape,” he growled. “You’ll never leave the Noelium!”  

I threw myself toward the open door, my hands grasping the edges of the frame. The ground outside was a blur of snow and fog, but I didn’t care. I leapt.  

The cold air tore at me as I tumbled into the snow, the train roaring past. For a moment, I lay still, my body trembling, my breath clouding the air.  

When I looked up, the train was gone. The tracks stretched into the distance, empty and silent, as if it had never been there.  

I pulled myself to my feet, my legs weak, my mind reeling. The world around me was still and quiet, the snow glittering beneath a pale moon.  

But as I turned away, I heard a faint sound in the distance—the haunting whistle of a train.  

It was then that I understood: the Noelium was always searching, always waiting.  

And though I had escaped, I knew it would find others.
