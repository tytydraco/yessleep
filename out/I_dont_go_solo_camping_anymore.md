The reason I don't want to go solo camping anymore. 

I (M23) have been a long time lurker on this subreddit but have never had a scary encounter I could tell about on here. Until now… 

Today I just got back from a weekend trip solo camping/bushcrafting in the Belgium Ardennes. I am no stranger to the outdoors, I have worked as outdoor activities instructor for multiple businesses, I am a scouts leader, I've done a part time  2-years during bushcraft education and last year I got myself a job as a ranger in a big forest nearby where I live. Needless to say I have spent quite some time in the sticks and I'm familiar with the sounds of the forest and wildlife. 

I also love camping off the trails. Officially it's illegal but I just can't find the same peace and quiet at an official campsite plus I feel like camping should be free anyway… 
So sometimes I like to pack my back and just venture out into some thick forest, go off the trails and just wander around till I feel like I'm far enough into the wilderness to not get disturbed by hikers and of course not get spotted by local authorities. 

There is some inherent risk about going about my camping trips this way, because I deliberately try to go as far away from civilization as possible, there would be no help nearby if I were to fall or injure myself. I also don't have an exact idea of where I will be camping so I can't tell my family any specific details of where I will be spending the night, only the general area. I'm very aware of the risk this brings and therefore I'm always extra careful when I'm out by myself. 

Now that the winter season is noticeably coming to an end and the days get more spring-like and sunnier. I figured it was the perfect time to go out for some solo camping. I packed my backpack with the things I needed, loaded everything into my car, and set off for the 3-hour drive on Saturday morning around 9:00 am. 

It was around 12 when I got to my destination, I got out of my car and breathed in the fresh morning air. It smelled like pinewood and fresh morning dew. I love that smell. 

I started hiking in a general west-ish direction, keeping the morning sun on my back. After some time I figured I had walked far enough and decided to leave the path going into the forest. 
Now before I got off the path I took out my knife and cut off some flakes of some of the tree branches , exposing the white underlayer of the bark. 
I did this because I knew it could be hard finding the path again when coming back out of the thicker forest, this way I'd know when I'd be back on the path that would lead to my car. 
It's one of the safety precautions I take when I'm going out alone on a camping trip. 

After walking for a bit I noticed I couldn't see the white spots behind me anymore through the thick bushes meaning I'd also be invisible for any hikers on the path. I was approximately 500 meters away from the track and decided this would be a good place to set up camp. I was in sort of an open spot with thicker bushes and trees around me, mostly holly bushes, some birch trees and pine trees. 

I set up my tarp between two trees in a simple A shape. Keeping the sides a bit above the ground. That way when I would be laying under it I could keep an eye on my surroundings. If the wind would pick up I could simply lower it a bit to keep me sheltered. 

The next thing I did was dig a small hole before my tarp where I planned to be cooking. I had brought some simple warm up meal that only needed some boiling water and for that I had brought a gas stove with me.
I'd prefer to build a fire especially because I knew the night would still be quite cold but I didn't want to risk a local ranger seeing or smelling the smoke and maybe discovering my illegal camping activity. Keep in mind that I'm a ranger myself and I don't know how my manager would react if he found out I did the very thing I had to kick others out for at my own forest. For me that added to the thrill of it. 

It was about 3pm when I was done with all of this and now I could look for something to keep me busy. I decided to spend some time whittling so called "tree spirits" out of branches I found on the forest floor. They're basically little bearded faces you carve into a stick and make for a fun little project. After a while I had about 7 of them (not all as nice as I'd hoped) 

All this time I had listened to the birds singing, I saw a squirrel run up a tree and there were more clouds setting in. However I had not heard a single human on the path that I knew wasn't too far away. 
It didn't worry me but I did notice it, especially because on earlier camping trips similar to this one I'd always hear some folks whistling to their dogs or chatting with each other. 

I started to boil some water in a pot I brought with me and not much later I had made myself a simple meal of pasta. 

After dinner I layed down my sleeping mat and sleeping bag under my tarp and explored a little further around my camp site. This is also a habit of mine because I like to make sure there is nothing near my camp spot that I don't know about. I'm looking for big tracks of wildlife like cows or deer, signs of homeless people who I don't want to encounter while I sleep ofcourse and other things out of the ordinary. 

I found nothing that peaked my interest but as I walked back to my tarp I noticed all the birds had stopped singing. 
That was kind of odd but I wrote it off to it getting late and some birds actually start going to their nests then, and indeed become a lot quieter. 

The wind had also picked up so I decided to lower my tarp on the windward side so I'd be sheltered from the cold wind tonight. When I was done with that side I thought of the possibility of the wind changing direction and so I also lowered the other side of my tarp.

Before I went to bed I got a trail cam out my backpack and looked for a spot to set it up aimed at my tarp. It's a thing I do before I go to sleep since the first night I went solo camping. I was a lot less experienced then and all the sounds from the forest kept me up almost all night. Now I can rewatch the footage in the morning and see if there had been anything near my tent that I had or hadn't been aware of during the night. 
I looked at the battery percentage of the camera and saw it was at about 50%. That wasn't much but it would be enough for a single night.

I got into my sleeping bag and set off for the night… 

- - - - - - 

It was 01:00am when I woke up. I kept lying still, listening to my surroundings to try and figure out what woke me up. 

I listened to the soft clicking and cracking noises forests make at night. Nothing out of the ordinary, just the wind blowing through the branches or insects crawling through dry leaves. I heard an owl hoot its signature call and wondered if that was what woke me up.. 

But then I heared it again… a soft crackling noise. It made the hair on my neck stand up.
I kept laying still and listened more. It was quiet for a moment, but there I was again. Like someone, or something stepped very carefully on some dry leaves on the ground. It was barely noticeable but when you know the sounds of a forest as good as all the little squeaks and cracks of your house it stands out like a big bright red flag. This sound didn't belong here. 

A cold feeling got into my chest. This thing.. Whatever made this noise was probably not human. Nobody walked this slowly through a forest at this time of night. 

Then I heard it again. A little farther away this time, whatever it was was very slowly walking around my tarp. It was moving behind my head. 
My tarp was set up in a way that I could look out of both entrances but to see the part it was moving towards I'd have to look up, as I was laying on my back. 
I tilted my head but couldn't get a good view on what was outside. I didn't dare to move my body more in fear I'd make more noise and somehow attract what was outside to come look inside. 

I tried tilting my head looking up over my other shoulder but as I turned my head I heard the sound again, this time from the other side of my tarp. I had missed the moment of it moving past the opening!

My heart was beating down my chest and I didn't know what to do. In fact. All I could do was lay still and listen to “it” walking around me. I felt frozen. 
The steps continued without any pattern. Sometimes I'd hear nothing for a minute, then two steps with only 5 seconds between them. 

I told myself it was just a curious animal sniffing around my tent. Maybe a dog or a raccoon, although deep down I knew an animal like that would have sounded different. 

I kept listening, but suddenly the noises of soft footsteps seemed to have stopped. I lied still and listened for 3 minutes but I could hear nothing but the sounds of the forest. Until… there was the unmistakable sound of a Robin singing. The sound was so crisp and loud compared to the silence from before it made my heart jump up in my chest and my whole body shocked. It was still 1:30am and there was no way a Robin would be singing this early/late at night. 

I kept listening to the joyful sound cutting like a knife through the silence of the wood…
It was off, I couldn't put my finger on it but something in the song was not quite right. 
Every now and then a barely noticeable rasping noise could be heard during the song. 

This continued for some time. Honestly I lost track of all time as I waited in my bed and just wanted it to stop. 
And it did stop.. After a while. I hoped that whatever was out there making these noises would have finally left, but just as I thought it was done, I heared a cry coming from far away in the forest. It sent shivers down my spine and I knew for sure I wasn't about to go investigate. I heared it again and again, a cry like a child who lost its mother, or someone who was desperate for help. 

Maybe I should have gone out my sleeping back and just ran to my car, but I couldn't. Something inside me told me to keep quiet and in my tarp and DEFINITELY not go outside. I don't know why but I waited the night out until dawn. Of course I didn't close an eye for the rest of that night. Even when the crying had stopped and the forest was silent again. 

When I saw the early sunlight making shadows on the side of my tarp I finally dared to get out and investigate the surroundings of my tarp. There was nothing that indicated something had walked around my tent that night! No footprints nothing. All I found were the tree spirits I carved earlier during the day. I had left them laying in front of my tent. 

Then I remembered my trail cam! Sure it would have captured what was walking around my tent right?
I got it off the tree I strapped it to and got out the SD card and put it in my phone using a SD card reader. I scrolled through the pictures it had taken. There were some of a bird and a squirrel hipping and running through the frame but when I got to around 1am there was no picture that could explain what I heard that night. What ever had walked around my tent hadn't set off the motion detection of my camera. 

I packed up my stuff and got back to the trail I had come from. I found it easily because of the marks I made yesterday. As I walked back in the direction of my car I walked past someone walking their dog. They gave me a weird look as I passed them, I probably looked like shit because of staying up all night. I didn't care much and headed directly to my car and drove straight home. Not even stopping for some breakfast on my way. 

Needless to say I won't be camping any time soon again, especially not alone and off grid.
