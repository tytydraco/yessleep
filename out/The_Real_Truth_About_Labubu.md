A month or two ago, I bought a Labubu for my girlfriend’s little sister. That damn thing ruined my life.

We were at a convention, weaving through crowded aisles of overpriced merch when she spotted them... a wall of little monsters with toothy grins and glassy eyes. She froze, transfixed.

Wanting boyfriend points, I bought three. One for each of us.

She squealed when I handed them over, clutching hers like treasure. The smile on her face made it worth every penny. It was wholesome. Cute even.

For a while, I was into it too. Ads started following me everywhere: Collector editions, glow in the dark variants, holiday exclusives. I bought a few more. They made me feel… happy. I clipped a different one to my backpack each day. It sounds stupid, but looking at them gave me comfort. Like they were smiling for me.

One afternoon, while walking to a cafe with my girlfriend, a homeless man lunged at us from nowhere. Filthy clothes, wild eyes. He grabbed my arm and screamed about angels and demons, spit hitting my face. Then... he saw the Labubu hanging from my backpack.

He ripped it off with shocking strength, holding it away like it burned him. His voice dropped low, muttering in tongues before his body convulsed and foamed at the mouth. People screamed. I slipped in, grabbed my Labubu, and ran.

The moment it touched my hand, calm washed over me. My heart slowed. The warmth returned.

After that, something felt wrong. When I looked at it I felt a quick flash of nausea, then the warmth again... Stronger, smothering it. I started to hate that homeless man. Hate him for touching it, for ruining something pure. The anger didn’t feel like mine, but it lived in me anyway.

My sister called a few days later. When I told her what happened, she said I sounded crazy. “It’s just a toy,” she said. “You’re acting like it’s your child.”

She didn’t understand. She couldn’t.

Still, hearing her say that shook me. She’s always been my anchor. If she thought I sounded insane, maybe I was.

I hung up and looked at the shelf lined with Labubus. A dozen identical faces smiled back at me from the dark. The warmth was gone. What I felt instead was cold and heavy.

That’s when I decided to throw them away.

I grabbed a trash bag, but the moment I reached for one, my body froze. Half of me screamed to toss it, the other half begged to protect it. Pain split my skull. I laughed and sobbed all at once. Then something snapped.

When I came to, I was standing on the roof of my apartment building.

I don’t know how I got there.

I've been avoiding my bedroom for days now, Shielding my eyes when I pass the door. I'm scared of what will happen if I look at them again. I’ve searched online: “Labubu nightmares,” “Labubu hallucinations,” but everyone just says get help.

I haven’t slept in thirty hours. I can feel them whispering behind my eyes, telling me to smile.

I'm not crazy. I was blind like everyone else, but now I see. They’re not toys. They’re totems. They plant joy to make you trust them. When you resist, they punish you.

I’m going back in to face them.

One way or another, this ends tonight.
