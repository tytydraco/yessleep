“Get it together, [Henry!](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15agr55/i_can_see_peoples_ages_tonight_i_met_a_woman_who/)” I said to myself, slapping some sense back into me. “Remember the [mission!](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15gmn2t/i_can_see_peoples_ages_today_i_kinda_killed_a_man/) Fight now, think later!”

I checked my surroundings for more vamps. I quickly pressed myself against the wall as another set of footsteps descended from the end of the adjacent corridor. Sneaking a peak, I found an orderly carrying a metal platter with a small styrofoam cup, some pills, and a sandwich on it.

The girl's age read only 20, but I was on edge. She still could’ve been a fledgling vampire for all I know. Technically anybody in the double digits could be a vampire. They just aren’t super mega old like most I’ve encountered so far were. I couldn’t trust *anyone*.

She looked friendly enough with her long brown hair tied back into two French braids and eyes which radiated kindness. She continued walking, staring down the activities room doors absentmindedly. I could only guess who the pills and food were for.

Taking a gamble with what little essence of a plan my brain had cooked up, I revealed myself right as the orderly stopped in front of the double doors that led into the most important room in the building. “… Hey there!”

She stared at me with wide doe eyes, pressing her lips into a small line. Obviously I’d caught her off guard and startled her.

“C-can I help you, sir?” She stuttered out. “How did you get in here?”

I shot her a nervous, toothy, smile. “Listen, I’m reaaaal sorry to do this. You look like a nice lassy, you really do, but-“

I wound my fist back, getting ready to knock her lights out, when I noticed the scared look on her face. A few thoughts crossed my mind. How many punches to the face would it actually take for her to go down? How much pain and damage had to be done before she was knocked unconscious? I was already hesitant to hit the woman in the first place, but it was necessary to my plan. 

Quickly, I changed my plan to what I thought was a slightly less brutal one. 

“-Hey what’s that over there?” I asked as I pointed behind her.

Following my lead, the orderly twisted her head to look at the empty corridor behind her. 

As much as I didn’t want to get violent, especially with a woman, I needed her out of the picture. And her clothes.

While she was still turned away from me, I lunged forward and took the tray out of her hand and set it haphazardly on the floor. Then in her stunned confusion, I grabbed her shoulder and twisted her so her back was to my front, then put her in a chokehold. I felt dirty as I covered her mouth with my hand to keep her screams muffled. She squirmed in my grasp and clawed at my arms, desperately trying to get me off her. 

Unfortunately for her, I was stronger and within a minute or two she was out. I didn’t put enough pressure on her throat to do too much damage, but she would be out for a little bit and wake up with a sore throat and a nasty looking bruise.

Looking around to make sure the coast was still clear, my eyes landed on the only other door in the hallway. I grabbed the orderly’s wrists and quickly dragged her, surprisingly heavy body, closer to the door. I crossed my fingers and toes, praying that this door to whatever room laid behind it was unlocked. Mara blessed me with some good luck as after a quick jiggle of the doorknob, the door popped open, revealing a small janitorial closet. 

I gently disrobed the nurse out of her scrubs- not looking at or touching anything because I’m not a perv- and set my delivery driver costume neatly on her torso. If she woke up in there at least there’d be something for her to change into.

I did a quick costume change then grabbed a broomstick and stuck it under the doorknob after gingerly kicking the orderly’s legs inside the closet.

The white scrubs the orderlies had to wear must’ve been unisex or something because they fit surprisingly well. They felt light and breathable, like silk pajamas. My only problem was that I had two feet on the other girl, so the pants went up a little past my ankles. Anything, though, was better compared to the tightness of the delivery driver costume.

Collecting myself, I swept some hair out of my face and ran my hand through my hair. Hopefully I won’t need to do anymore evil deeds for the rest of the day.

I scooped the metal tray off the ground and walked towards the Activities Room doors. The small golden plaque mantled above the wooden double doors that read “Activities Room” only confirmed I was in the right place

I hadn’t gotten close enough to the doors before to see that plaque, so it was nice to know I hadn’t royally fucked up and I was actually worthy of being on Nate’s team. Now all I had to do was go in there and rescue the last Chosen so our team could go and kick some vampire ass!

Taking a deep breath in, I shifted my left hand under the middle of the tray and knocked softly on the door three times with my other hand. 

“Hello?” I asked softly, not wanting to startle whoever was in the room. “Is anyone in there?”

I was about to knock again after not hearing anything but I paused when an even softer voice said from the other side of the door, “Come in.” 

I opened the door and realized why they sent human orderlies in there instead of vampires. The activities room was a huge open space with one wall basically being floor to ceiling windows. In contrast to the dark corridor on the other side of the large oak double doors, bright light from the early afternoon sun lit the activities room up like a Christmas tree. 

There was a brown leather couch set and coffee table in the middle of the room. A large pool table was in the back left corner, adjacent to a ping pong table in the back right corner.

In front of the wall of windows was a large wooden easel and half painted canvas. Next to it was a plastic foldable table full of art supplies. Paint brushes, colorful tubes of acrylic paint, oil paints, and a watercolor palette were littered all over the surface of the table. A stack of empty canvases of all different shapes and sizes laid in the corner. Next to it was another stack of paintings all with similar compositions, but they were facing the ceiling so I didn’t get a real good look at them. 

The canvas itself was full of different vibrant shades of greens, yellows, pinks, and purples. Even though it wasn’t finished I could tell it was a painting of a garden. A garden that I’d visited before. The Garden of Mara. It was then that I noticed all the paintings hanging around the room. They were all almost identical, except that put together the canvases showed a greater painting all together. It was almost a full panorama of the pavilion that sat in the middle of the garden. 

Emily grabbed an apron with a million paint splatters covering it and tied it around her front. A little name tag reading “Emily”  was pinned to it. Emily picked up a white plastic palette and started to paint again.

“You’re not Gloria.” She said in a slow, monotone voice.

I set the tray I was carrying down on the glass coffee table then went back and locked the doors. I couldn’t risk any vampiric interruptions.“Gloria is feeling a bit under the weather at the moment, so they sent me.” I lied.

Something felt… off about this whole situation. As I got a better look at Emily, I had a sneaking suspicion why.

She wore a light gray sweatsuit under her apron. Her blonde hair was tied back into a messy bun. A million freckles were speckled all over her rosy cheeks and nose. Her eyes were glassy and gray with a far off look in them. Immediately I could tell she wasn’t fully there.

I grabbed the pill cup that sat in between the styrofoam cup of water and sandwich on the tray I’d brought in. The cup contained four small white round tablets and one long light blue pill. None of them had the standard imprint codes that identified what the medicine contained. Just what kind of drugs were they giving her?

When I looked back up after concluding my examination of the pills, Emily was standing in front of me, her palm held out to me expectantly. 

“My pills?” She asked with a raised eyebrow as she stared at the small cup in my hands. 

My eyes darted between the pills and her glassy gray eyes. “Why don’t we try something different today?”

I offered her the sandwich and cup of water instead. She shrugged her shoulders, indifferent to the change of routine, and graciously took the water and chugged it. She ignored the sandwich and went back to her easel.

“Do you know your name?” I asked after dumping the pills in the sink that was used to wash the paint brushes. I turned the faucet on and watched the drugs dissolve in the water and flow down the drain.

“Mhm.” Emily said absentmindedly as she continued to stroke her paint brush against the canvas. She paused and then turned to me and pointed at her nametag. “This thing says my name is Emily. Who else would I be, silly?”

She then continued to paint the canvas, ignoring my existence as she got in the zone.

I took another look at all the paintings around the room. “What are you painting?” I asked, already knowing the answer.

It took Emily a minute to formulate an answer, like she was trying to find the right words to say. “*Home*… I think. I know I felt safe there. Warm and loved. I felt at home there.”

Home? That’s an odd way to look at The Garden of Mara. But then again, when I think back to when I visited in my dreams it could be described similarly to how Emily saw it. It definitely was a safe and comfortable space. No wonder Wesson, the God of Death, wanted back in so badly.

Emily waved her brush around a large blank spot in the middle of the canvas. “You see right here? This is where M’lady will go. I’m not so good at painting people so I’m going to do her last.”

After hearing Emily’s explanation the once white blob in the middle of the canvas resembled the outline of a woman. By the outline and with deductive reasoning, I concluded that Emily was talking about the Goddess of Life, Mara. It seems like she didn’t know her name either since she referred to her as “M’lady.”

“You’re a good artist.” I said, marveling at all the artwork Emily had created. “Your paintings are beautiful.”

Emily continued stroking her paintbrush along the canvas. Currently she was touching up a section of pink flowers I couldn’t place the name of. Instead of thanking me for the compliment, Emily started airing her grievances to me. “They won’t let me paint a mural on the walls and only let me use the canvases. Those only let me create windows. If I could paint my mural it would be like I was back there.”

I nodded my head and made a non-committal “hm” to show I was listening to her. Emily then pointed to the stack of painted canvases. “Those are my failures, too ugly to even be seen. The only good thing about them is the practice I got. One day though, despite them, I’ll paint my perfect mural on the walls. One day I’ll go back home.” 

Even though she was drugged out of her mind, I admired Emily’s determination and outlook on life. She had this indescribable aura about her that made me realize why Mara chose her. I could sense it would be even greater if she was at full mental capacity.  

I asked her one final set of questions before I determined it was high time we got out of there. “Emily, do you remember anything other than The Garden? Do you know where you are right now? Why you’re here?”

She set her paintbrush down and turned to face me again. Emily looked up to the ceiling as she tried to remember. The glossy look in her eyes deepened as she seemed to be looking beyond the ceiling at something incredibly far away. 

“I-” It looked like she was about to cry as she breathed in a pained gasp of air. “I need to finish my painting.”

“Emily,” I said as I got off the couch and grabbed her shoulder. She shrugged me off and went into a trance-like state. She wouldn’t answer any more of my questions and just continued to paint.

Suddenly, a loud bang came from the locked double doors. Emily didn’t seem to mind it, but I readied myself for another vampire attack. Another loud bang came from the door. I grabbed one of Emily’s spare paint brushes and broke the wooden tip handle off, making a makeshift wooden stake. If earlier had been a fluke, and I really couldn’t control vampires, I didn’t want to be empty handed when facing another fanged bloodsucker.

One third and final bang came from the doors before they burst open. I put myself in a fighting stance, bracing for the vampiric army I expected to storm through those doors and rip me to shreds. Instead, a disheveled Nate stood out of breath holding his side.

“Nate!” I shouted in relief, throwing the makeshift stake across the room and enveloping him in a tight hug. I thought he might’ve become vampire chow by now. Boy was I glad to see he was alright. The memories of my previous vampire encounter and the implications that came with it got pushed to the back burner with how excited I was to not be alone again. Still, a feeling of unease coursed through me. Something was telling me to air on the side of caution. I decided not to divulge the new developments of my abilities to Nate.

“Oh, hello.” Emily said in that same quiet and mousy tone when she first let me in the Activities Room, addressing Nate. She then went back to painting as if nothing ever happened.

He had this complete look of surprise and awe on his face as he looked me dead in the eyes and pushed me off of him. He analyzed the situation and kept looking between Emily, me, and the paintings all over the walls. Nate quickly broke through his shock and looked behind his shoulder. He then closed the double doors he’d kicked open.

“Quick, help me push the sectional over here!” He ordered as he raced towards the largest and heaviest couch in the room.

Following Nate’s orders, I grabbed one end of the heavy sectional and helped him carry it to the doors. We pushed it right under the door handles so it would be difficult to open the door from the other end. Just then a bang came from the other side. Then another.

“Care to explain?” I said as I grabbed my makeshift stake again and eyed the doors like they were going to explode open any minute. 

“Pissed off a couple of vampires. They followed me here. They probably brought reinforcements as well.”

A sarcastic, “Great,” slipped out of my mouth as I rolled my eyes.

“What’s with her?” Nate asked, gesturing to Emily. 

“Drugged to high hell. I doubt she even knows she’s a Chosen, much less how to use her ability in the state she’s in.’

“Great.” Nate said, copying my sarcastic tone from earlier. “Are those-”

“Paintings of The Garden? Yes. She thinks it's home.” I answered. 

“It will be home to all of us if we don’t do something!” Nate shouted.

I had an epiphany. “We can’t take them all, just me and you. We need Emily and her ability to get rid of them for good. If I can somehow get her lucid then we might have a fighting chance.”

Nate took a cautious step back from the door and started looking for an alternative escape route. “How do you plan to do that?” 

“Uh,” I said, thinking out loud as I patted myself down, trying to find something that would do just what I needed it to. My hand landed on my pocket and a crazy idea popped into my head. It was crazy enough it might just work. “With this,” I said as I pulled my Epipen out of my pocket and held it up like it was our saving grace.

 Remember when I said I carry it with me in my pocket everywhere I go?

Just as I announced my plan, Nate’s eyes landed on the wall of windows. “I dunno, Henry. Don’t you think maybe she’s been drugged for a reason? Let’s just break the window, get to the van, and let her detox on the way back to the motel.”

“Yes, I do think she was drugged for a reason,” I answered, looking at Emily. “That reason is what is going to get us out of here alive.” I dismissed Nate’s plan and readied the Epipen. A boost of adrenaline was hopefully just the thing to break Emily out of her drug induced trance.

“Do whatever it is you think will work then,” Nate said, annoyed as he punched one of the window panes, trying to break it. “ Meanwhile, I’ll be over here waiting and ready to save your ass again.”  When his punch didn’t break the glass, Nate tried to kick it.

“Hey, what are you doing?” Emily yelled in protest as I took the paintbrush out of her hand and spun her around. My one hand was wrapped around her waist and the other was at the ready with my Epipen.

“Don’t worry, Emily. It’ll pinch and sting for a little bit, but then everything will be just fine.” I said, reassuringly.

She looked me deep in the eyes, seemingly understanding what I was telling her, right as I jabbed the epipen in her thigh. She didn’t even flinch or register that she’d just been stabbed with a tiny needle. I stuck the empty pen cartridge back in my pocket.

I waited for something, anything, to happen to Emily. She just stood there, like some kind of zombie statue.  A minute passed and her eyes still remained just as cloudy as before. An intense bang came from the window behind us. Nate had picked up a love seat and was currently attempting to use the legs to break the windows. It was a little effective as a small crack in the glass had formed.

“A little help here?” Nate grunted in frustration as he threw the chair at the window. 

“Give me a minute!” I yelled, desperately. Emily still had that long far off look in her eyes. I looked between her and Nate, who was still assaulting the windows with living room furniture. 
Another idea popped into my mind. It was a long shot, but it could work. If it didn’t, then I’d help Nate finish breaking the window which now had multiple cracks in its glass.

Still holding Emily’s waist, I pulled her even closer to mine. Our faces were mere inches apart and I could feel the air coming out of her nose on my cheek. I looked into her gorgeous gray eyes one more time, before I shut mine and pushed my lips into hers. It was a short and sweet kiss, but at the same time it felt electric. Like a million lightning bolts danced across my skin.

I felt a sudden change in her body language as I pulled myself off of her and opened my eyes. The aura she emitted earlier had increased tenfold, and the look on her face was a scary one.

Her once glassy eyes were clear as day with heavily dilated pupils. They were somehow a darker, more alive shade of gray than before. Her cheeks were blushed a deep red and a nasty frown was on her lips. Emily scowled at me. A sudden spark flashed in her eyes as her anger increased and she slapped me across the face. I took a surprised step back and rubbed my sore cheek. 

“What the hell is wrong with you?” She turned around and rested her hands on the easel. She looked back at me with a menacing look as she wiped my kiss residue off of her lips with her sleeve. I stepped forward to try and explain myself, but another spark lit in her eyes and her palms glowed an amazing hue of red. Then suddenly the easel erupted into flames. Emily screamed as she lurched back, accidentally falling into me. She pushed me off of her as she looked at the big flaming easel in the corner. Emily’s scream grabbed Nate’s attention off the window and over to us.

“Holy shit!” He said, dropping the chair in his hands.

Her halfway completed painting burst and sent hot embers flying throughout the room. One landed on the back of my hand. Instead of an intense burning pain shooting through my skin, I felt… nothing. I watched in awe as the ember burned brightly on my hand before eventually dying out and crumbling to ash.

Emily looked in awe as I scraped the ash off my hand and whipped the debris off on my white scrubs.

“That didn’t hurt.” I said, amazed.

“We’re immune to each other's abilities.” Nate said as he gestured to a bunch of embers that landed on his own skin and clothes. They all fizzled out and crumbled to ash. Even Emily was immune, but that was a given since she is the one who caused the fire to begin with. Nate looked over at the sectional which had small flames littered throughout its upholstery as if to prove his point even more. 

“What the hell is going on?” She screamed as she looked down at her hands, scared of herself. That glassy look from earlier returned as she seemed to remember something. “Mom?! Dad?! What did I do?”

I grabbed Emily’s shoulder and rubbed it gently. This seemed to break her out of her trance and she looked up at me. “Hey, it’s okay. See? We’re fine. Let’s all calm down and focus on getting out of here.” 

She wiped a tear out of her eye and a determined look crossed her face as she nodded in agreement. 

“This window is about to crumble. Just one more hit and we’re out of here!” Nate yelled as he picked up the same love seat from earlier.

“NO!” Emily and I shouted at the same time lunging for Nate, trying to stop him.

The one thing you never want to do, especially in a house fire, is open any windows or doors to the room that's on fire. It’s called the fire triangle since there are three things needed for a raging fire to start. Heat, fuel, and oxygen. There was plenty of fuel in the room with the wooden easel, all the canvases, and various wooden brushes and furniture littered throughout the room. The heat from the first fire was already going. If Nate managed to break the window then the over abundance of oxygen that would flow into the room would tip the scales and cause the fire to burn more and potentially cause an explosion.

Emily and I were too late in our warning as Nate had already thrown the chair with all his might. First the sound of cracking glass filled the room, before the glass shattered completely. Nate braced himself and I grabbed Emily and shielded her in my arms. The sound of hot wind rushing next to me rang in my ears as a loud explosion echoed through the room. Something large crashed into my back, causing a rippling pain throughout my entire body. Emily fell out of my grasp due to the hard impact. The wind got knocked out of me, but I would be fine.
I looked up and everything was covered in flames. 

It was weird standing in the middle of a burning blaze and not dying. I managed to find Emily again and Nate joined back up with us. Nate let me use him as a crutch and the three of us left the Activities Room for the last time. The couch we used to block the door had been blown to smithereens.

The vampires that had been piled against the back side of the door didn’t stand a chance. As we left, one vampire who had their lower half torn off in the blast scrawled down the hall for help, his organs leaking out and leaving a black blood trail behind him. He reached out for us, hissing and baring his teeth, but he was too weak to do anything. His skin started glowing brightly before he disappeared all together. He was only 102 years old.

“Gnarly.” Nate said.

“What was that thing?” Emily gulped. I forgot for a second that she was out of the loop. 

I then remembered the orderly from earlier and raced over to the closet I’d locked her in. I removed the broomstick and her body fell out when I opened the door. She must’ve regained consciousness and put the delivery driver outfit on but passed out again after the explosion. It looked like the force of the blast caused a whole bunch of cleaning supplies to fall off the shelves and on to her. I checked her pulse. She was alive, but barely. I grabbed who I think Emily called Gloria and slung her over my shoulder. Another roar of fire shot out of the Activities Room door, singing the hair off of Gloria’s arm as I just managed to dodge it. 

Two things became apparent at that moment. One, humans could be affected by Emily’s flames. Two, the fire was now spreading out of the Activities Room and spreading down the corridor to the rest of the hospital

“Human?” Nate asked as I hurriedly hobbled back over to the group.

I nodded my head. “We need to get the other humans here to safety. There’s at least another one here somewhere. Nate, do you know where the others are?”

He nodded his head. “When we didn’t go back to the van, the vamps figured we were up to no good. They gathered all the humans as hostages in the cafeteria. There were six of them, but as far as I know, two of them were drained and turned.”

"Wait, they can turn other humans?” I asked, bewildered at such a possibility.

“Vamps? As in vampires?” Emily added in, incredulously. 

“Yes.” Nate answered both of our questions at the same time.

“Just who the hell are you guys?” She asked, looking for answers, trying to make sense of everything.

Nate and I shot each other a look before answering her question in unison.

“We’re Mara’s Chosen Few.”
