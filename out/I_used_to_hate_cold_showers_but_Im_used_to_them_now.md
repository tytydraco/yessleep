Moving back to my hometown wasn’t exactly my post-graduate plan, but halfway through senior year I became an orphan and a homeowner in one fell swoop. I bought one ticket for graduation and crossed the stage knowing one of the empty seats I couldn’t make out from the podium was my mother’s. The next day my fiancé Jeremy and I drove for eleven hours straight, back to the small farming town in Washington that I hadn’t called home in years.

  
Jeremy did make an effort to be there for me, I think I can see that now. It was a lot for him, being there with me, away from the city, friends, his career. My mom’s house was not the downtown loft we had toured that spring, but he told me he thought it was adorable anyway.  


The house was built in the 60s and bought by my grandparents in the 70s. I can still remember the way the house looked when my grandma lived in it. Paisley wallpaper and potted plants behind the sink, Simon & Garfunkel’s “I Am a Rock” playing from a cassette tape. When my grandma died, my mom painted over the wallpaper and threw out her tapes. I saved the album with that song on it, Sounds of Silence. I’ve never played it.  


After a few months that wallpaper from my childhood decided it’s time being glued was over and it was taking mom’s beige paint job with it. Jeremy wanted to fix it himself, I didn’t want anyone other than my mother painting her walls. I ended up tearing the wallpaper down and painting on the bare walls myself. I felt like I was a corpse splashing ‘Mallard Green’ paint on the inside of my coffin. I wondered how my mother felt doing the same actions a decade earlier. Jeremy didn’t talk to me until I was done with the bedroom. He said it looked terrible and I told him to eat shit.  


I was scrubbing the paint flecks out of my hair when the water temperature started to fluctuate. I preferred my showers as hot as possible, and for the first few months the ancient water heater obliged. Jeremy complained about lukewarm water but kept forgetting he needed to shower until the exact second after I headed to the bathroom with a towel. I told him if he wanted a hot shower he could go to his parent’s house, and say hi to them both. That usually shut him up.  


The hot water would usually last long enough for me to sing along to five songs, sometimes as many as eight. So, when the water started turning cold during the middle of song number three, I was suspicious. Jeremy said he hadn’t showered recently, but I didn’t believe him. I finished rinsing conditioner out of my hair with the cold water and tried to ignore my chattering teeth. Somehow sitting on the bed in a towel after felt even colder. I shortened my showers to four songs after that.  


The next week, Jeremy drove out to see a friend from college who had moved to a city near us over the summer. That day he actually remembered to shower without the pavlovian prompting of me getting a clean towel. I heard him yelp at how hot the water was and he got pissed at me laughing at him. He said he didn’t know it could get so hot because he’d never ‘been allowed’ to shower with a full water heater. Like it was my fault I was the only person who remembered to bathe regularly.  


I was determined to not give him an inch, so I bit my tongue when the water in the sink burned my hands the next day. The day after that my shower oscillated from ice cold to scalding hot, bringing actual tears to my eyes. I didn’t say anything about that, either.  


Jeremy didn’t like the neighbors, the new paint color, or the way the floors creaked at night. When I asked him what he did like, he said the house has ‘good bones.’ I didn’t know what that was supposed to mean and I didn’t ask. He explained anyway. Apparently ‘has good bones’ is code for ‘needs to be torn down to the frame and rebuilt.’ He had been thinking about it for a while, and an open floor plan would really liven the place up. I reminded him that the house was mine, and he was technically my guest since we weren’t married yet. I didn’t want any remodeling, that was final. I said if we ended up having kids maybe I would reconsider then. I guess that bruised his ego, because he slept on the couch for a few nights after that. He spent the weekend with his old friend doing god knows what. Girlfriends weren't invited. I spent the weekend scraping wallpaper off the kitchen walls and replacing it with a pale yellow color called ‘Grapefruit.’  


I was forced to break my silence about the water heater when Jeremy came back from his weekend out. That morning I got out of an especially volatile shower, wiped the fog off the mirror, and saw that my shoulders and neck were deep red. I had gotten as used as you can be to ignoring my nerves while showering, taking the hot and cold mostly in stride. This was different, worse than any sunburn I’d ever had. Even the towel touching my skin was too painful. I let myself air dry, laying gingerly on the bedsheets. Jeremy wouldn’t be home for hours, and I knew we didn’t have any aloe. I couldn’t stop myself from crying, and the salt made the burns worse. I was in my own house, my mother’s house, my grandmother’s house, and I felt completely alone. I am a rock, I am an island, Paul Simon sings on that song on my grandmother’s cassette in my memory.  


Jeremy came back late, refreshed and ready to be angry at me again. How can time apart make someone so much more bitter? He probably thought I was pitiful, feeling like a lobster boiled alive and looking the part.  


I told him we needed to fix the water heater, and he laughed.  


“So, once it’s something you want changed it’s allowed?” he said.  


I didn’t respond.  


“That tracks, since it’s all about you isn’t it. Your mom, your house, blah blah blah. No thought for me, my needs, my fucking life.”

  
I still didn’t respond.

  
“What, nothing to say? Nothing about how you dragged me out to the middle of fucking nowhere to live in this shit-hole of a house?”  


I couldn’t get any words out past the anger, so I just stood clenching and unclenching my fist. He stared at me for a minute then went to the kitchen for a drink.

  
“Jesus Christ. This color is fucking hideous,” he said from the other room. I got up, red skin cracking as I walked to the bedroom door.

  
“Get the water heater fixed or leave,” I said. He scoffed at me and raised an eyebrow to say really? I didn’t blink and stood my ground.

  
He rolled his eyes, shut the fridge, and said “Fine, whatever.”

  
“Okay, good.” I shut the bedroom door and locked him out.

  
I put in headphones to tune out the noises coming from the living room TV and tried to sleep. I was exhausted but the pain of my burns kept me up. I put some washcloths in the sink and tepidly turned the handle to the coldest setting. When the water appeared to not be steaming hot, I grabbed the damp fabric and held it to my neck to ease the pain. I swallowed some Tylenol and held the cold glass to my skin. It helped some.

  
When I finally did pass out, I had awful dreams. I dreamt I was peeling back the burned skin on my shoulder and finding not pink flesh underneath but dried paint, the green color I used in the bedroom. The layers kept going, my mother’s dovetail paint, my grandmother’s paisley wallpaper, a pastel floral pattern I didn’t recognize. I was frantically digging into myself, scraping back the layers until I hit a layer of rough wood and had to stop. I stared at the gash I had made in disgust, the layers of paint and wallpaper looking like the cross-section of a jawbreaker.

  
I jolted awake. I inspected my body and didn’t see any injuries other than the burns which looked slightly less red-hot. The pain came back, of course, but it was improving with the meds and sleep.

  
I got up and almost started making a pot of coffee but decided I’d better not tempt my fate with more hot water so soon after my burns. I was halfway through a bowl of cereal when I realized Jeremy wasn’t around. Had he actually left, I wondered? I felt like I should feel sad at that thought, but I just felt hollow. Hollow at the thought of him leaving, worse at the thought of him coming back. I pushed the feelings down and checked my phone, surprised to see a text from him saying he was looking at the water heater.

  
I finished my cereal and headed to the door in the kitchen that opened to the garage. The garage light was on. I called out to Jeremy but didn’t get a response, so I walked down the steps and around the corner to where the water heater was.

  
He was kneeling in front of the water heater, his hands outstretched, touching the sides of it. I called his name again, but he didn’t move. I took a step towards him and noticed the concrete was slick with water, pooling out from under Jeremy’s legs. My heart dropped.

  
As I got closer I saw that his hands weren’t just touching the metal. They were fused to it. The skin was bubbled and popped like crispy pork rinds. The weight of his hands was pulling at the skin attached to the water heater and it was starting to tear apart, revealing the red meat underneath. I gagged, my stomach screaming at me to vomit.

  
I didn’t want to look at his face, but I forced myself to. I had to know what had happened. It was scalded to the bone, a drooping bloody wax candle of fat and muscle. His jaw was frozen half open in a death mask of surprise.

  
I observed myself from a distance as my hands felt his arms and—once I could tell his body wouldn’t burn me—pulled his hands off the water heater. They came free with a nauseating sucking sound. Some chunks of his fingers stayed glued to the metal. I lowered him backwards to the wet concrete floor in a pose somehow more unnatural than how I found him.

  
I found his phone in his pants pocket, still functioning. I deleted the most recent text he sent me and texted myself a nasty, hateful text that summed up his feelings for me. I went through his contacts, texting them goodbyes and fuck-you’s as I saw fit. I turned the phone off before anyone could call. Nothing they could say would help him.

  
I put the phone in a ziplock bag to contain the glass and hammered it into sand. Jeremy went into two overlapping garbage bags since he was too big for only one. I drove off in Jeremy’s truck, leaving my phone at home just in case my location was being watched. I pinned my hair up into a baseball cap to hide its length and drove through the small downtown fast enough to be remembered.

  
I buried Jeremy in the forest a few miles outside of town. His truck went over a cliff a few more miles down the road. It took me four hours to walk back. The fresh air was delicious.

  
When I made it back to my mom’s house I scraped the rest of Jeremy off of the water heater. I couldn’t identify any leaks, cracks, or broken valves. I’m no plumber, though. I threw away the final bag in the regular trash. It was unidentifiable.

  
I took a shower that night in the coldest water the tap could manage. The temperature stayed steady and the frigid water on my burns felt like heaven.
