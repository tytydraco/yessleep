I am Josea Marshall. Born June sixteenth, nineteen eighty-nine.  

An heir to a lucky break.  

The recipient of some small fortune to pick me up and pull me out of this tiresome over exhausting life I've lived so far.  

A dream only dreamt during late night spells of agonizing insomnia. A letter I received, a tether to another dimension, answering my pleas for help, ripping me free of my own disgusting, ruminating mind. 

I was told my great uncle passed. He was a well-off man, a businessman. A surly, reserved, self-centered man. I’d met him all but one time at some award/acknowledgement ceremony he was attending. Didn’t give two shits that I was family. That’s the behavior I was expecting, based on all the garbage my father had told me about him. 

He was the proud and respected owner of Marshall Farms and the Marshall Hotel. His farm was said to be one of the most profitable farms in the state at its peak. I was instructed to travel to his hometown of Burgundy Illinois, for I was the sole inheritor of a life altering amount of money.  

Burgundy was a very popular mining town back in its day. It used to house about four thousand residents while the mine was in operation. In the spring of 1948, a great and terrible fire erupted and engulfed the mine, taking one hundred and sixty souls with it. It was a devastation that affected almost every family that was housed there. Not too many people hung around after the disaster. Most businesses picked up and left. A small nostalgic downtown area that never quite made it out of nineteen sixty was all that was left of this place. Faded signs and boarded up buildings poked out on every corner. The Burgundy Town Hall stood between a withered Pharmacy and my uncle’s Hotel. Some locals were holding an auction in the town hall, so I decided to check it out, seeing that I had all this newly acquired cash to throw away. 

There was a Lot up for auction. It was sized at about one hundred twenty acres. It bordered a small state park, so it was mainly made up of undisturbed forest. Lot 802 it was called. I had an opportunity to bid, so I threw out a surprisingly low number, hoping for the best. Pages upon pages of ideas flooded my head as I daydreamed about it. I could do so much with it if I won. 

Honestly, this all couldn’t have come at a better time. My long-time long-distance girlfriend admitted that she was seeing someone else, and I had just been let go from my job at the hospital, so I desperately needed this. My mental state was deteriorating as it was. I moved out to the city to try to escape the place I grew up in. To try to escape a former version of myself. I wanted to grow into something more. Something meaningful. Someone with a purpose. But who was that person? I was still searching for my real self even after making the “crazy” (as my friends put it) decision to leave the rest of my life behind. I just needed that personal reset button. I really did put everything I had into that hospital job though. I liked helping people, but I got burnt out. I was burnt out of everything. Thirty years on this earth, a total environmental refresh and you’d think I would’ve figured it all out by now. But now, I could really start focusing on myself. Focusing on who I am and who I am to be. This was the restart that I really, really needed. 

After little to no enthusiasm from the townsfolk, I was granted the property. I was then approached by a tall, dark eyed dark-haired man. He was in his late sixties with a salt and pepper mustache, and he had a face of sincerity and hard work. He wore a “U.S. NAVY” hat on his head with a tattered black leather jacket. He pulled out a menthol cigarette and lit it upon introducing himself to me.  

“Mr. Walker,” he said shaking my hand, “you’ll call me Jim. I'll be walking you through the properties and get you acquainted with the town. Locals aren't very welcoming either, but you’ll understand soon enough. Nice meeting ya kid.” He shook my hand with an iron grip and gave me a firm pat on the shoulder. He flicked his cigarette into a metal garbage can near the front door and adjusted his hat before stepping outside.  

Jim, the retired owner of James Walker County Realty, Property Management and Contracting, told me that this property had been unowned since the town was at its height of production. That’s eighty years! Eighty years of God knows what’s gone on in those woods. So much discovery, so many hours of exploration ahead of me. I could find absolutely nothing, and id still be happy. This is the first property I’ve ever officially owned. 

After showing me to the property lines, Jim let me on my own for a while. He gave me his number and told me to call if I get lost. 

I step out of my car and zip my jacket to my neck. I close my eyes and take a sharp breath as waves of pin-like air push through the top layers of my clothes. Sounds of tumbling leaves and rattling tree branches are echoed all around me. The wind passing through the tree line beside me was bitter and invasive. The grove ahead was overgrown, littered with sun-bleached garbage and dead weeds. I could barely hear any sound of birds or insects over the wind. My feet were the first to touch this ground in many years. Every step I took was accompanied with a burst of excitement and anxiety. 

I had a backpack with a bandana, flashlight, hunting knife and some food, as well as a couple bottles of water, matches, and a compass. Jim gave me an old map of the Lot and told me it was the only copy. The map looked like a rough sketch made by someone who did a bare minimum survey of the bordering land. Not much was labelled, other than a rough estimate of the property size and the Grundy State Park west trail entrance. I didn’t expect to make it too far in at my first run, but who knows what I'd find in here.  

I had plenty of daylight to spare while I was here, so I was sure to find something today. I had been walking through thick patches of dead grass and weeds in between trees for about fifteen minutes before I finally found what appeared to be a trail entrance. It was far east from the State Park border, sheltered within a thick tree line. It was old, bare and abnormally wide. There were two thick wheel indents set into each side of the trail. One could tell that this trail was heavily used at some point. It was way out of view from the road, so I doubted anyone had been here recently, seeing that you’d have to do a considerable amount of walking to find it. As I walked further, I started to notice the trail leading towards what looked like an old wooden covered bridge going over a small creek. 

It was in mint condition. Not a flake of paint had fallen, nor a speck of dirt had taken to its walls. I was absolutely stunned. As the wind came through, I could hear the creaking of the wood structure as it moved with each gust. There was a small wooden sign nailed to the left support beam at the entrance of the bridge. It read “802” in smooth black, rustic calligraphy. It was immaculate craftsmanship. The strange part was this shouldn’t be here. I took out my phone and took a picture, as I was told this whole property was vacant of any structures. I sent the picture to Jim and asked him who had recently been building on the property before I purchased it. I tied my bandana to a small tree near the trail’s entrance to mark the bridge location. He replied just a few seconds later. 

“Yeah there’s nothin there Bud. Nothin built there and nothin in the photo.” 

I couldn’t believe it. 

I closely examined the picture I sent, and my heart went into my stomach. Nothing. Just trees. No trail, no bridge, nothing but trees and a broken beer bottle in the distance. I got goosebumps. I immediately asked Jim to meet me out here so he can see what I was talking about for himself.  

He met me at the properties edge right where we split earlier in the day. He sat in his dark green 1986 GMC smoking a cigarette and listening to conservative talk radio. 

“Thanks for trekking back out Jim. You gotta get a look at this.” 

He slumped out of his SUV, dusting off his faded jeans as he closed the door. We made our way along the outer property lines toward the direction of the trail entrance. It was a long walk, and Jim was complaining of his knee bothering him most of the time. I didn’t have much to say to his ramblings about “got it so good city life” or his body aches, so we had a few spells of awkward silence. 

We finally came to the trail entrance and there waving us down was my bandana, tied to the small birch sapling I left it on. I felt a sigh of relief come out of me. I untied it from the tree and put it in my back pocket. 

“That’s the trail marker.” I told him as I looked at his annoyed facial expressions.  

“How far till we get to this Bridge son, you didn’t tell me it was this far out.” 

“It shouldn’t be too far! I'll buy you a beer for your troubles man.” I assured him. He waved a hand at me. 

We both kept walking further down the trail. We felt a flash of cold wind push through us, as I put my hood up and he put his hands in his pockets. He stopped walking, let out a deep exhale and pointed forward. There in front of us both was the Bridge. Perfectly preserved, each nail a shiny silver in the sunlight. The paint perfectly filling the cracks of the wooden planks that made up its walls. 

“Well kid you weren’t lying…” 

“You wanna snap a pic on your phone real quick? That way you don’t have to rely on me next time.” I joked. 

“Well kid you weren't lying…” he spoke in exactly the same tone as before. I felt a strange shift in the atmosphere around me, like that pressure feeling you get in your gut before the rain starts on a cloudy day.  

“You uh, you want to head back man?” 

I looked up from my phone, and he was gone.  

Nowhere in sight. 

I looked back down the trail where we had previously been, but he wasn’t there either. I turned around and looked up towards the entrance of the Bridge and there he was, standing there with his back to me. He’d made it twenty-five feet in a matter of seconds. 

“How in the hell did you do that…?” I nervously cackled. 

No reply. He stood there with his hands in his pockets, just casually rocking side to side. 

“You ever see woodwork like this boy?” He said aloud. 

“Do you know who did it? It looks new...” 

No reply.  

He just, stood there.  

Still not facing me. 

He began to cough, slow and deep. Each cough ended with a louder, fuller cough taking its place. He put his hand to his side and started wheezing breaths that had barely any air. 

“Hey are you alright?” I said with some concern. 

He turned and faced me. His mouth lay wide open and began emitting a cloud of thick opaque smoke. His eyes were wide open and also emitting thick pillars of dark grey smoke. His nostrils began spouting smoke as he coughed harder and harder. His eyes began glowing a deep orange beneath the smoke. His mouth fell open even farther, like a marionette with a broken jaw as it unhinged before it broke off. He screamed; 

“OPEN THE SEAL!”
