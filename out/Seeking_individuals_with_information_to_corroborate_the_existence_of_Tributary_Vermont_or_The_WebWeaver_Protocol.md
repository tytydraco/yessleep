First and foremost, don't bother searching for the definitive location of Tributary, Vermont. Most of you will be wasting your time. Unless you have a paper map that was published before the Spring of 1992, you won't find anything. 

I'm transcribing and publishing these journal entries because I'm at a loss of what to do instead. My usual information channels have run dry. As a Hail Mary, I'm attempting more of a "shot gun" approach. 

If you know anything, please have the balls required to reach out.

**April 10th, 2012 - AM**

I could tell that Yvette’s replacement would not live more than a few nights in Tributary.

*“And…what, we’re just supposed to stare at it?”* Reggie muttered, each syllable dripping with a childish irritation.

I tried not to let the newcomer disturb my own focus on the maypole. By my estimation, the speaker system that ran the perimeter of the town had chimed only two minutes ago. At the very least, we had another fifty-eight minutes before the next chime would sound and signal that we should break our gaze. As a restless whistle streamed from Reggie’s lips, I got the distinct feeling that he wouldn’t be able to put in more than five minutes with the maypole. That being said, Reggie was under no obligation to watch it. The chimes, the reverie, the maypole - they all simply represented a strong recommendation from The Bureau, but they weren’t a demand. No pistol-totting enforcers would arrive on scene if he went twiddle his thumbs somewhere else. They could mine useful data about the convergence no matter what Reggie did. He was free to do as he pleased.

It was for his own safety, though. I can say that from experience, having spent the last four years within the confines of Tributary.

*”Yes. Think of it like meditation, but with your eyes open,”*  I responded curtly, hoping that my standoffishness would quiet Reggie.

After a microscopic pause, though, he continued: ”*I mean for how long, though*?”, underhand tossing a rock the size of stopwatch at the base of the maypole as he said it.

Lacy physically grimaced as it thudded loudly against the wood and the plastic. Out of the five of us currently living in Tributary, she had been here the second longest, about half as long as me. In my experience, there was a definite correlation between total time spent here and respect for The Bureau’s guidelines. Given that, Lacy and I had a very short fuse when it came to disrupting the morning reverie.

”*For at least an hour, kid,*” Lacy snapped venomously, her face contorted into a gaunt snarl like a starving mountain lion. She stood next to me in the semi-circle we had formed around the maypole, on the end of the group and the farthest from Reggie. This struck me as an intentional choice. The four of us—Lacy, Alexis, Harmony, and I—remained shaken and on edge after Yvette’s accident. Lacy, having found Yvette’s overlapping cadavers, was the most shaken, and likely not ready for someone to come in and replace her.

”*Longer if you’re smart,*” Alexis added, with her twin, Harmony, nodding silently in agreement.

She had followed all the recommendations to the letter, never missed a dose of medication despite the side effects, and she was always on time and present for the reverie. Despite that, Yvette still amalgamated. Horribly, too. Worst instance of it I’ve seen since being here.

When she wasn’t at the maypole five minutes after the first morning chime, Lacy took it upon herself to check on Yvette. When thirty minutes had passed and Lacy hadn’t returned from Yvette’s cottage, which was approximately a three-minute walk from the maypole, I then reluctantly left to find Lacy. Call it experience or intuition, I knew she was gone long before I found Lacy kneeling over what remained of our Yvette.

If you survive long enough at Tributary, you get plenty desensitized to the tangled, sanguine aftermath of spontaneous amalgamation. Something about Yvette’s death stood out—maybe it was Lacy’s long blonde curls, bloodstained from being draped over the overlapping, repeating viscera, or maybe it was the entire spectrum of terror present on Yvette’s intersecting faces. Whatever it was, I felt fear form a heavy cannonball in my stomach like it had the first month I was here, the weight of the feeling making movement and thought difficult.

Showcasing his boredom proudly like it was a badge of honor akin to a Purple Heart, Reggie began trotting around the twenty-foot tall totem, speaking loudly as he did: *”Help me out here Ted - you look old as sin, so I’m supposing you’ve been here awhile and will know the answer. I get paid no matter what I do, correct?”* 

I took a moment to pause and consider my response. Finding the words I wanted proved difficult at. Before I could respond, Tributary’s profound baseline silence drew my attention away.

The town lay nestled between two large, forested hills, but natural white noise was absent—no birdsong, no wind through the trees, no distant car horns. Most of the silence was likely because of seclusion from civilization. The lack of birdsong, however, has always been a little less naturally explainable.

Somehow, I think The Bureau keeps animals out of Tributary. Despite being in Vermont, I’ve only ever seen one animal in my tenure here - a deer, or what remained of it. One part of it was dead, its head resting limply on the ground under a pine tree at the periphery of town. The other part of it was in the process of dying, with its head visibly writhing and twisting from inside the first’s over-expanded jaw. As I turned away, stunned and retching, I witnessed various minute but unnatural looking movements coming from inside the original’s abdomen and limbs. I imagine these movements represented the superimposed copy of the deer being strangled and exsanguinated from within the restrictive confines of the original.

After a prolonged silence, I responded,

”*That’s correct, Reggie, but they must have mentioned the impor-*“ cutting me off before I could say more, the brown-haired, blue-eyed boy resumed his self-important pontification:

*”Great, as advertised. Excuse me then if I don’t erotically gawk at this second-rate modern art piece, like the rest of you sheep. Don’t want to see myself featured on some Japanese prank show a few years down the line with whatever footage they’re currently recording”* he decreed, gesturing broadly at the many, many video cameras fixed on our position in the dead-center of Tributary, Reggie still obnoxiously treading circles around us and the maypole.

Seemingly, every inch of the town was under surveillance. Not that there was *that* much space to cover. Tributary was essentially one street lined by abandoned buildings with a small park in the center, where the maypole was erected after the disappearance of the people who used to live here. I don’t know what this place looked like in its heyday; someone removed all the business signage from the weathered establishments before I arrived here four years ago. The only structure that looked relatively new was the maypole, but even that was showing some age and erosion.

Despite his infuriating pretension, Reggie was right about one thing - “modern art piece” would be a very reasonable description for the maypole.

At its center was a wooden cylinder with a diameter about the size of a frisbee. It stood approximately two-stories tall in a small patch of grass that interrupted the asphalt at the half-way point of Tributary’s one street. Thick plastic, dramatically shifting in color every few inches, adorned the post chaotically; its protrusion from the wood was asymmetrical depending on the perspective. Closer to the ground, the plastic looked like dragon scales, oblong and rough. As the material wrapped around the pole and spiraled upwards, however, it transmuted to look more like spikes or stalactites, poking a few feet out from the core. Then, it transmuted again to a glossy sheet with a few thin, centimeter-long tendrils sticking straight up here and there. Next, it looked like ocean waves, and then like stick figures holding hands, so on and so on - innumerable shapes seemingly without coherency or intent in design, from top to bottom.

Or, alternatively, maybe the disorder *was* the design - no matter where you looked, and at whatever angle you looked, the maypole offered a wholly unique image. When I was briefed by The Bureau before arriving at Tributary, the welcome coordinator had mentioned that the maypole was theorized to “counteract the surrounding convergent leyline through its nearly unreplicatable uniqueness, grounding subjects in our current thread through focused perception”, whatever that means. The coordinator, muscular and decked in camo like a drill sergeant, implied that this measure may have saved the original inhabitants of Tributary if they had access to it.

Me and my initial group were not told *what* had happened to those original inhabitants. That being said, I’m not sure any of us explicitly asked.

Although, sometimes I’m not so sure I’m recalling the words or phrases from the briefing correctly anymore. It’s just been so long. Not only that, but every newcomer I’ve talked to in the last year denies having had a formal briefing before arriving at Tributary, unlike me. Enticed by the ludicrous financial compensation, they did not want the offer to be revoked by asking any prying questions - no briefing required.

Part of me believes The Bureau stopped briefing people altogether - perhaps it was effecting the data in a way they didn’t expect.

Or maybe there was never any briefing and I’m housing a false memory - some retroactive revision of my internal narrative to make what happens at Tributary even remotely digestible.

”*I’m just here to get quick cash to pay-up on a gambling debt. Once I have enough, I’m out. I’m going for a walk. Enjoy your shared psychosis.*”

With that proclamation, Reggie walked away from the maypole. I heard Lacy take a monstrous inhalation, clearly planning on chewing out the young man. Before she could unleash her tirade, I placed a soft palm on Lacy’s shoulder and numbly shook my head side-to-side, which extinguished her fury. Reggie turned back to us when he heard Lacy’s colossal sigh, but only for a fraction of a second.

Implicitly, Lacy, Alex, and Harmony understood - Reggie would not be with us long, and arguing with him was not worth the risk. Strong emotion is destabilizing and can make you vulnerable to spontaneous amalgamation.

They promised all of us release once the experiment, referred to in my briefing as the *WebWeaver Protocol*, was completed. Attempts at voluntary early discharge from Tributary, before the completion of the experiment, were met with rifle-fire and death. Four years into this, I’ve believe that The Bureau has no intention of ending the experiment. Whatever they are gleaning from us, it’s clearly valuable - hundreds of spontaneous amalgamations later. The experiment still presses on.

Maybe his replacement will be better.

**April 12th, 2012 - PM**

”*Love you, sweetheart. I’ll give you another call in a month or so. Say hi to your mother for me”* and with that, I heard the call disconnect before I even put the phone back onto the receiver. After confirming my granddaughter, Remi, was no longer on the line with a few pathetic “*hellos?*”, I let the phone slide out of my hand to its normal resting place on the end table. I closed my eyes and leaned back in my recliner, letting the crackling embers in my cottage fireplace soothe me.

The first of each month, we’re granted ten minutes of uninterrupted phone time. A privilege that The Bureau certainly doesn’t *need* to provide, but it helps everyone keep their heads on straight. I use it mostly to confirm that Remi is still getting the deposits from my bank account, coordinated by The Bureau. Originally, I signed up for this to help her pay for college. Now, the compensation is helping fund her wedding. Breaks my heart that I haven’t met her fiancé, and that I have to lie to her about my absence. The salary given for my continued, honest participation is the only thing giving my life purpose, though. No reason to lose my grip now.

Feeling sleep coming on, I make myself vertical, fighting through the warm vertigo caused by the rum still sloshing around in my gut. Lumbering over to the bathroom, I start performing my nightly inspection. Staring at myself in the mirror, I smile for about half a minute and watch for discrepancies in my mirror image. Once I’m convinced it is only me in the mirror, I do the same with a neutral expression. Then the same with a frown.

Breathing a sigh of relief, I turn on the faucet, allowing me to splash cold water on my face to help relieve the tension inherent to that inspection.

There was a moment, years ago, when I thought I might be about to amalgamate. I woke up in the middle of the night due to my entire body throbbing with an intense, searing pressure. It was like tiny grenades were exploding in my limbs, clawing into my muscles with microscopic shrapnel. I passed the bathroom mirror on the way to the maypole, momentarily petrified by the crowd of different reflections staring back at me. The images weren’t spread out across the mirror. They all inhabited the same position I did, but I could see all of them separately. It was like seeing double, but with complete visual clarity. There were at least ten, each taking a turn to become the most prominent reflection. The more I watched, the more alarmed my reflections became - which, of course, only served to alarm me further.

My recollection of that night was shattered by manic pounding on my front door.

*”TED. HELP ME - PLEASE HELP ME. SOMETHING…SOMETHING IS...”*

Reggie’s voice, bellowing and coarse with strain, started to permeate the inside of my living room. Panic sparked like a live-wire through my chest and down into my legs, mobilizing me.

Without saying a word, I frantically pushed my recliner against the door like a barricade. Then, I used a small bookshelf to block the only window present on the front of my house, in case he tried to break it and enter the living room. Judging by the sounds coming from outside my home, I could tell he was destabilizing and too far gone for my help.

At least, that’s what I told myself. Trying to assist Reggie was a risk I wasn’t willing to take. Spontaneous amalgamation is a brushfire - if I got too close, it could just spread to me as well.

As I stepped away from the makeshift palisade, Reggie’s pleas intensified and degenerated from sentences, to singular words, and finally to guttural noise. His screams were eventually joined by other, nearly identical screams. Some of them started muffled, as if they were vocalized from some place deep underwater. But when the pulpy sound of tearing flesh layered into the cacophony, the extra voices became clearer - more audible. By the time his one scream had grown into an unbearable, hellish choir, I had managed to close the bedroom door behind me. As I did, the screams grew fainter and fainter, until they became mercifully absent, replaced by Tributary’s uncanny, baseline silence.

\------------------------------------------------

**April 13th, 2012 - AM**

In the morning, I wearily pushed the recliner away from the front door, dreading the scene that was undoubtedly waiting for me on the other side. To my relief, however, I found evidence that someone from The Bureau had visited my home under the cover of darkness. There were no bodies propped against the cottage, only a few patches of barely perceptible, recently cleaned blood-stains.

As I approached the maypole, I noticed Reggie had already been replaced by another young man. He eventually introduced himself as Matt, only doing so after the second chime had sounded, indicating our protective morning reverie had come to an end, choosing to forgo a formal introduction until *after* spending that hour intently focusing on the prophylactic totem.

I smiled weakly at Matt’s compliance with the recommendations, feeling a flicker of hope as I did. Maybe we would all be afforded some peace, for however briefly that could be possible.

My smile waned as my thoughts drifted back to Yvette - someone who followed every guideline but had still spontaneously amalgamated. Before anxiety captured me completely, I steadied myself with an imaginary photo-collage of Remi’s wedding playing through my mind. She’ll be married by the first of next month, and I need to be alive to hear about it.

*“One day at a time”,* I whispered to my reflection in the mirror that night.

For a second, I thought I saw the barbed curves of a grin overlap my neutral expression, a macabre cosmic friction heralding something even worse than spontaneous amalgamation.

But as soon as it had come, if it had been there at all, it was gone again.
