The Vanishing

He stumbled into the apartment, the weight of another fruitless day settling into his bones like lead. The air inside was thick and stale, the silence deafening. He shrugged off his jacket, the familiar leather cool against his skin, and headed towards the bathroom. A hot shower. That's all he needed. Just a few minutes of scalding water to wash away the grime of the day.
He turned the faucet, the sudden blast of heat a welcome assault on his senses. As the steam began to rise, he started to undress. And then, it began. A cold dread, sharp as shattered glass, pierced through him. His hands trembled as he fumbled with his belt, a primal fear clawing its way up his spine. Then, he looked down.
At first, he thought it was a trick of the light, a cruel joke played by the distorted reflection in the steam-fogged mirror. But it wasn't. His... his manhood... it was shrinking. Not subtly, not imperceptibly, but visibly, undeniably diminishing before his very eyes. He gasped, stumbling back, instinctively clutching at himself as if trying to hold on to what remained.
It didn't stop.

"Mama!" The word escaped his lips before he could even register the sound, raw and desperate.
His mother burst into the bathroom, her face a mask of alarm. She froze at the sight of him – half-naked, pale as death, clutching himself like a man teetering on the edge of a precipice.
"What is it, darling? What's wrong?"
He couldn't answer. Couldn't form the words. He just stared at her, his eyes wide with a terror he hadn't felt since childhood. Without a word, she crossed the room and took his hands in hers.

"Pray," she said, her voice firm and steady.
And so, they knelt there on the cold tiles, mother and son, their voices a fragile counterpoint to the pounding of his heart. But nothing changed. The panic wouldn't subside, and the... the thing... continued its relentless assault. Hours crawled by in agonizing silence until, as the first rays of dawn pierced through the gloom, the sensation finally receded. He felt hollow, a gaping void where his confidence used to reside.

The Aftermath
The next day, he tried to convince himself it had been a hallucination, a fever dream brought on by exhaustion. But a chilling certainty settled deep within him. It wasn't a dream.
It happened again. And again. Every few days, like a relentless tide, the same horror would descend upon him. The same paralyzing fear, the same agonizing retreat, the same desperate pleas whispered into the void. Soon, it wasn't just his body that was under siege – his mind began to unravel. He became a prisoner in his own apartment, terrified of the next attack, of the inevitable exposure. He clung to his routines like a drowning man to a piece of driftwood, praying for deliverance, desperately clinging to the remnants of his sanity.
His girlfriend tried to help, but her concern was tinged with a growing doubt.
"Maybe it's all in your head," she suggested one evening, her voice gentle but laced with uncertainty.
He wanted to believe her. Desperately. But how could he, when the sensations were so vivid, the terror so real? And then there were the noises.

The Neighbors
At first, he dismissed them as figments of his overactive imagination. A faint thud on the roof as he prayed. The scrape of a chair from the apartment next door, perfectly timed to coincide with the final verse of his mantra. An acrid, smoky smell seeping through the vents as he lit a candle for solace.
Coincidence, he told himself. It had to be. But the patterns were too precise, too deliberate. His neighbors... they were watching him. Listening to him. Why? For what purpose?
One evening, as he sat on the edge of the bed, his head in his hands, his girlfriend approached him cautiously.
"You're not sleeping," she said. "You're becoming paranoid, and... this isn't healthy. You need help."
"Help?" he snapped, his voice raw. "From who? A doctor? A priest? You think anyone would believe me? You don't even believe me."
She didn't respond, the look in her eyes a stark betrayal. She was afraid. Not of what was happening to him, but of him.

A Desperate Gamble
That night, he made a decision. If he was going to die – if this was meant to destroy him – he wouldn't go down without a fight. He turned to the only weapons he had: faith, rituals, and sheer willpower.
He adorned every wall with crucifixes, their cold metal a stark contrast to the warmth of his dwindling hope. He dipped his fingers into bowls of holy water, the icy liquid a stark reminder of his own mortality. He drew intricate pentacles on scraps of paper, tucking them beneath his mattress like desperate talismans. The air in the apartment grew thick with the scent of burning sage and incense, a desperate attempt to cleanse the invisible miasma that seemed to cling to him. At first, it seemed to help. The attacks became less frequent, less intense. But they never ceased entirely.
And then, the neighbors escalated their campaign. Doors slammed in the dead of night. Objects clattered against the walls, their rhythmic beat mimicking the pounding of his own heart. Whispers slithered through the vents, too low to decipher but loud enough to shatter his fragile sanity. It was as if they were trying to... provoke him.
Was it real? Or was his mind finally succumbing to the abyss?

Elsewhere...
(What follows is only what he learned years later, if it can be believed at all.)
Somewhere in the hidden recesses of the astral plane, his soul cried out for help. And someone – something – answered. He was told that these entities, beings of immense power and compassion, had intervened on his behalf. They claimed to have woven a protective web around him, subtly manipulating the world around him to shield him from harm.
But if that were true... why did it feel like things were only getting worse?

The Vanishing Continues
By the end of the month, he no longer trusted his own senses. The noises, the smells, the whispers – they weren't coincidences. They were signs. Of what, he didn't know.
One evening, as he lit a candle and began to pray, he heard the neighbors again. A soft knock against the wall, almost apologetic. He froze, his breath catching in his throat. Then, slowly, deliberately, they knocked again. Three times.
He blew out the candle, plunging the room into darkness.
And in the suffocating silence, he whispered to himself, "It's not in my head. It can't be."
But even as he uttered the words, a chilling doubt gnawed at him. Was he already too far gone to know the difference between reality and the abyss?
