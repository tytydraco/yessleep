I don’t know when I first noticed him. 

Maybe I was ten, maybe a bit older. But he was always there. A speck in the distance, far enough away that I could barely make out his twisted form—a hunched, decrepit man with long, greasy hair hanging over a face so sinister it made my skin prickle. His presence was like a black hole in my vision, a stain in the fabric of reality that nobody else seemed to see.

He never moved. Never got closer. At least…
not until I turned left.

It took me years to figure it out. At first, he just felt like a bad dream, a lingering shadow in the periphery of my life. Then, one day, I noticed it—every time I turned left, he edged just a little closer. Just a step. Just a breath. At first, I could ignore it. But as the years passed, as I aged from a clueless teenager into a deeply paranoid adult, the distance between us dwindled.

By the time I was twenty-five, he was across the street. By twenty-eight, I could see the yellow rot of his teeth when he grinned. And now, at thirty-two…

He’s pressed against me.

I stopped turning left years ago. Trained myself to only take right turns, even if it meant going in ridiculous loops just to get where I needed to go. But there’s something I can’t control: my sleep.

Every night, I toss. I turn. And every morning, I wake up with him closer.

At first, he was just by my bedside, his reeking breath warming my face. Then, he lay beside me. Then, on top of me.

Now, he is smudged into my right side, so tight, so agonizingly close, that I can barely breathe. His skin is cold and wet, like raw meat, pressing into mine with unnatural force. When I move, even the slightest twitch, his bones grind against mine, his limbs twisting to match my shape. I can feel his ribs shifting against my ribs, his knees locked with my knees, his teeth clacking against my own.

My girlfriend left months ago. She never saw him, but she knew something was wrong. How could she not? It’s hard to maintain a relationship when your body is permanently entwined with an invisible old man who smells like spoiled milk and wet mud.

But she wasn’t the only one.

Before I learned to keep my mouth shut, I told people. Friends, family, even a doctor once. I tried to explain it—that something was following me, getting closer every time I turned left. That I had to stop, had to find a way to keep him away. They thought I was losing it. They told me it was paranoia, stress, maybe even schizophrenia.

And he was there for all of it.

When my parents sat me down, their voices low and careful, asking if I had “been feeling okay lately,” he stood just behind them, grinning. Closer.

When my friends drifted away, their texts growing less frequent, I saw him in the distance at the bar, standing just outside the light, watching. Closer.

When my boss pulled me aside, concern laced in his tone as he asked if I needed time off, I spotted him in the glass reflection of the office window, just behind my shoulder. Closer.

The worst part was the doctor. The way he nodded, scribbling something in his little notepad. The way he asked me if I’d ever had “delusions” before. The word hit me like a sledgehammer. And just beyond the desk, sitting in the chair meant for family members, was him. Legs crossed, hands folded in his lap. Closer.

I realized then that if I kept talking, they’d lock me up. Medicate me. Institutionalize me.

That thought scared me more than the man himself.

So I stopped. I nodded along. I agreed that maybe it was all stress. Maybe I just needed sleep. I told everyone I was fine, and they believed it. Or at least, they pretended to.

But the damage was done. My family saw me differently. My friends saw me differently. I lost everything. My gym routine, my social life—gone. It was too exhausting to explain why I couldn’t run on the treadmill properly, why I had to take absurd routes to get anywhere. Why I looked so haunted all the time.

And all the while, with every conversation, every lost relationship, every turned back…

He got closer.

So now it’s just me. And him. And I think, very soon… it will only be him.

I tried everything. Strapping myself down at night, surrounding myself with pillows like a fortress. I even considered amputating my ability to turn left entirely. But the truth is… it wouldn’t matter. Because I still move in my sleep. I still shift. And each time, he takes the opportunity.

Each morning, he is pressing harder. I feel like a tube of toothpaste being squeezed from the side, my organs shifting under the relentless pressure of his form. My bones creak. My lungs barely inflate.

The worst part?

Sometimes, the pressure is so unbearable that I have to turn left.

Just a little. Just to relieve it.

And every time I do…

He gets even closer.

I can feel it now. A final shift. A last moment before the inevitable. His cheek is pressed against mine, his fingers interlaced with mine. I can taste the filth of his breath in my mouth, because our lips are now sealed together.

I don’t know what happens when he finally merges with me completely. But I think I’m about to find out.

I’m writing this now because I don’t know how much longer I have. It’s taken everything in me to force my fingers to move, to reach my phone, to even breathe. He’s pressing into me so hard that I can barely see the screen—his forehead is mashed against mine, his eye half-swallowed by my own socket. 

But I need someone to know. I tried everything. If you see someone acting strangely, refusing to turn left, making ridiculous loops just to walk down a street—ask them. Ask them if they see him too. Would be nice to know I’m not alone.

I keep telling myself this post is pointless. That nobody will believe me. That even if they do, it won’t change anything. But I have to try. Maybe someone out there has seen him too. Maybe someone knows how to stop this.

Because I can’t keep living like this.

I don’t know what happens when there’s no space left between us. But the pressure is unbearable now, like my own body is trying to fold in on itself. My ribs feel ready to snap. My jaw aches from clenching against his. My heartbeat is slowing, like there’s no room left in my chest for it to beat.

And I can’t stop thinking about one thing.

What happens if I turn left… just one more time?
