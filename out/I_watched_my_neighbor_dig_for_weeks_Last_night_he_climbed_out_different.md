I don’t usually pay attention to my neighbors. I’ve lived here for years and I barely know their names. A couple months ago the guy two doors down started digging in his backyard, and it was hard not to notice.

At first it looked normal. A square cut out of the grass, the sort of thing you’d do for a tree or a planter box. By the end of the week it had stretched wider, deeper, until it looked more like the start of a construction site than a backyard project.

He was out there every night under a buzzing floodlight, shirt plastered to his back, shovel working steady. Sometimes his wife came out with a glass of water. She’d hand it to him, stand there for a while, and then go back inside without a word.

I told myself it was none of my business. Still, the sound carried.

One night the scrape of the shovel cut off, and something else carried across the yards. It came in slow, uneven bursts, deep enough I felt it through the walls. The best way I can explain it is like standing too close to someone and feeling their breath. I thought maybe he had a pump down there, but when I looked over the fence it was just him and the pit.

The hole kept growing. He started bringing down a ladder and disappearing for longer stretches. When he came back up his clothes were streaked with dirt, like he’d been crawling instead of digging.

After a while I noticed the shadows. His floodlight threw him long across the grass, but sometimes the shape twitched when he didn’t. Once I saw him leaning on the shovel, catching his breath, and his shadow leaned the other way, toward the pit.

I kept watching. Couldn’t help it.

A week or so later he started screaming. He’d drop to his knees at the rim, plant both hands on the dirt, and lean over as he let it out. Not words, not anything like talking. Just raw sound that cracked until his voice gave out.

It always ended the same way. The scream would cut off, and the yard would go silent in a way that felt wrong. Not peaceful. Heavy.

Another night he dragged a box across the patio, heavy enough that I heard it scrape. He shoved it in and it landed with a dull thud, muffled fast. A thin mist rolled back up, spilling over the edge and across the grass until it thinned in the air.

After that I stopped sleeping much. I’d pace the house and end up at the window again, lights off, waiting.

Sometime after three one morning, he set the ladder aside. Then he stepped over the edge and kept going down. Smooth, steady, like the ground had shaped a path for him. The floodlight reached a few feet, then nothing. He was gone.

I stood there a long time. He didn’t come back up. Minutes kept passing. The silence pressed in harder, until I started to feel like I shouldn’t even be watching.

When he finally climbed out, his hands were empty. His face caught the light in long streaks that ran down from his eyes to his chin. Mud smeared his shirt and dripped from his elbows, even though the dirt all around the pit was dry. He just stood there at the edge, chest rising and falling, like he was breathing in something the rest of us couldn’t.

The next morning the pit was gone. Grass stretched smooth, patio furniture back in place, like nothing had been touched. His wife was out front watering flowers. She smiled and waved like it was any other morning. He sat on the porch with his eyes closed, sun on his face, calm in a way I had never seen.

I wanted to ask, but what would I even say.

Sometimes at night I still hear it. That uneven breath pressing through the walls, as if the ground hasn’t forgotten.
