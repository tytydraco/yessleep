For every single company I have either worked for or read about, a change in leadership always leads to employee layoffs. I remember the first time it happened to me—the shock and betrayal as I packed up my desk. That feeling never truly left me. Whether it’s the CEO, CTO, president, or even the senior manager, it always results in people being let go. It’s as if they decided the old, experienced team wasn’t good enough and chose to hire people based on their preferences. Or maybe they wanted to show progress right off the bat by implementing cost-cutting measures and removing 'unnecessary' staff to prove they’re improving the company. Sometimes, I even think they have a God complex and enjoy playing with people’s lives because they have the power to do it.

If I ever met a company that went through a leadership change without ruining my life, I would be loyal to that company forever.

However, Interstellar Bytes, the company I work for, underwent a CEO change two weeks ago. Now, they are announcing cost-cutting measures, including layoffs. Figures. I’ve only worked here for one year, and now they decide to let people go. Why can’t luck ever be on my side?

The new CEO, Sayuri, is overseeing the layoffs personally. The office is awfully quiet today, the usual hustle and bustle replaced by a tense silence. Fear is evident in my colleagues' eyes as they wait for their names to be called. The manager, Dakari, is calling out names from the piece of paper he’s holding. He’s sweating bullets, probably because he has no stomach for this. Nice guy, though. It’s a shame he’s been assigned to this task.

“Kimberly?” Dakari called out. “Sayuri wants to speak to you.”

I see Kimberly stand up nervously from her chair. She slowly walks into the boardroom where the layoffs are being conducted. Poor lady. She was always nice and liked cracking jokes all the time.

I look at the clock. Twenty minutes have passed, and I haven’t seen Kimberly leave the boardroom. That’s weird. There’s only one entrance, so how did she leave? In fact, I didn’t notice Cedric, Kim, or the others leave the office after being called in. What’s going on here?

My thoughts are interrupted when I see Dakari signaling me. I must have missed him calling my name. He points me towards the boardroom. I stand up nervously and walk towards it. I know what’s going to happen, but it seems like it always gets harder each time.

I knocked on the door and heard a woman’s voice reply, “Please, come in.”

I opened the door and slowly entered the boardroom. I saw a beautiful yet intimidating woman sitting at the table opposite me. She didn’t say a word when I entered, just kept staring at me. Finally, after a minute or so, I sat down.

“Nervous? Well, I think it is warranted. I see that you know what is happening in the company,” Sayuri said to me grimly.

“I’m not surprised,” I replied. “It happens every time there’s a leadership change.”

“Correct,” she said. “Only this time, it is a little different. See, the difference is, I am the closest thing you will see or experience as a God. And your life now depends on me.”

“Pfft. Yeah, right,” I scoffed at her, recognizing her behavior as typical God-complex nonsense.

“Based on your profile and your thoughts, I see that you have worked in three companies excluding this one, only to be let go because of a change in the CEO, senior manager, and CFO,” she said, locking her gaze with mine, making me uncomfortable for some reason.

“You also have problems with your personal life,” she added.

“Wait, wha—” I interrupted.

“You have been single your entire life,” Sayuri continued, ignoring my interruption. “You have no real friends. Your entire immediate family has passed away. And you have never had a significant other before. By empirical evidence, you are quite the loner.”

I gaped in silence for a bit, shocked by how someone could say such awful things. “So you invaded my privacy by looking at my social media profiles. I’m not surprised by this. But to use this against a fellow human being? That’s just low.”

“On top of that,” she continued, “you have become quite accustomed to bad luck. You have tried to date people or make friends, but your personality and coincidences get in the way. I see that your latest conquest, if you can even call it that, was with a beautiful woman named Erica. I see that she ghosted you. Although you treated her to a nice meal at your favorite Italian restaurant and did everything correctly, she did not seem at all interested in you. Perhaps it is because you are not exciting to her?”

I got up, furious at Sayuri. “What the hell?! Are you spying on me? That’s my own private life that has nothing to do with this company.”

“What were her words precisely?” she said, smiling and pretending to ponder. “Ah yes.”

*I need someone in my life who’s more exciting. More outgoing.*

I sat back down in shock. She had said those words exactly in Erica’s voice. My mind raced, trying to comprehend how she could know those words, let alone how she could mimic Erica’s voice so perfectly.

“What about your mother?” Sayuri continued. “Remember how she wanted you to marry someone nice? Someone special? Before she passed away. Too bad her and your father’s deaths were premature. In a car accident no less, right?”

She opened her mouth, and I heard the sounds of screeching tires and then a large crashing sound. The horrifyingly familiar noises echoed in my ears, transporting me back to that fateful day. I heard my mother and father crying and screaming, their voices filled with pain and terror, before a large explosion silenced them forever. My heart pounded in my chest, and I felt a cold sweat break out on my forehead.

“That was one of the worst collisions in this region in a decade or so. Such unfortunate luck,” Sayuri continued, seemingly enjoying my torment and anguish. “And worst of all, you bore witness to it when you were 19, watching them die as they dropped you off at the university. They were so proud of you.”

I continued gazing at her, shocked into silence by everything she said and the sounds she mimicked. My mind was a whirlwind of emotions—grief, anger, and disbelief. How could she know such intimate details of my life? The memory of that day flooded back, the screeching tires, the deafening crash, and the sight of my parents' lifeless bodies. I felt a lump in my throat and my eyes stung with unshed tears. Sayuri's gaze never wavered, her eyes boring into mine as if she could see straight into my soul. The weight of her words pressed down on me, making it hard to breathe. I wanted to scream, to lash out, but I was paralyzed by fear and confusion.

“Well, I do enjoy playing with my food for a bit. It has been fun. But the fun is over now,” Sayuri said to me with a grimace. Her expression hardened, and a chilling smile spread across her face. “Oh, and by the way, no one can hear you scream. You cannot escape.”

Suddenly, a brilliant white light flooded the entire room, so intense it felt like it was burning through my eyelids. I was blinded by it for what felt like seconds, maybe minutes. My eyes stung, and I could feel the heat from the light on my skin. I closed my eyes tightly and tried to feel around for anything familiar, like the door or the table, but I felt nothing. My fingers brushed through empty air. I reached for the handles on the chair I was sitting on. Nothing. Panic set in as I felt for the chair again. Still nothing. My heart pounded in my chest, and I shrieked, standing up at once. I used my feet to check for my chair, thinking I had gone crazy. But again, nothing.

Before I had time to contemplate what to do, the room plunged into darkness. Pitch black. I opened my eyes and couldn’t see a thing. Maybe I was permanently blind from that brilliant light. I looked all around me and saw nothing. I put my hands in front of me and couldn’t even see their outlines. I used all my appendages to feel around for something, anything. Again, I was met with nothing. 

However, I felt a slight gust of air hit the back of my neck. It was very cold, sending a shiver down my spine. Then, I heard a whooshing sound, like someone or something was moving around me, watching me, observing me. My breath quickened, and I could feel my pulse racing.

Then, I saw an outline of something that looked human in the void. That told me that I wasn’t blind. I could see. And this was real. And it was moving towards me. My legs felt like lead, and I was rooted to the spot, unable to move. The figure grew clearer, its presence filling me with a sense of dread. It was tall and slender, with an almost ethereal glow. Its movements were slow and deliberate, as if it was savoring my fear.

I wanted to run, but then all of my thoughts and memories came flooding into my mind. I realized that she was right. I was alone. Truly alone. No friends. No family. No one to go home to or share the joys of life with. No one who would lean on my shoulder or let me lean on theirs. Nothing awaited me in the future. Ending my existence now would probably save me a lot of pain in the future. My heart ached with the weight of this realization, and tears welled up in my eyes.

So I stood still, closed my eyes, accepted my soon-to-be non-existence, and waited. 

I waited for a while, but felt nothing, heard nothing. Then I opened my eyes and saw myself back in the same boardroom, sitting in the same chair. The room was eerily quiet, and everything seemed unchanged.

However, a foot away from me stood something human-like, almost womanly, but made of clear glass. Though the face was perfectly smooth with no defining features like eyes, nose, or mouth, I felt its gaze. The figure stood motionless, its presence both mesmerizing and terrifying.

The figure then turned and walked towards the chair that Sayuri had been sitting in, and sat down. As it moved, its form shifted and morphed, the glassy surface rippling like water. Slowly, it transformed into a grim-faced Sayuri, her eyes locking onto mine with an intense, almost predatory gaze.

“Interesting. You are not food. I will not get the same pleasure from consuming you as I did with the others. You could be useful,” she said, her voice cold and calculating. She paused, appearing to contemplate what to do next, her fingers tapping rhythmically on the table.

“Hmmm. I can tell that you despise this world for what it is worth. If you serve me forever, I could give you purpose in life. Something to look forward to. To escape your pitiful human existence and become something more divine,” she said, her words dripping with a twisted allure. “What say you? If you do not accept, your life will remain the same, as pathetic as it is. But you will not die. Not yet, anyway.”

My heart pounded in my chest, and my mind raced. Maybe I was vulnerable at that moment. Maybe I was so weak-willed from everything I had experienced, everything that had been taken away from me, that I figured accepting a deal from the devil was better than suffering in life as an honorable man. 

I gazed back at her, my voice trembling as I said, “Yes. I accept your offer.”

“Good.” Sayuri smiled while keeping a cold and calculating aura. “I see a bright future ahead of you. I promote you to senior financial manager, which includes a much larger salary as well as a substantial immediate bonus. This is from all the people I have laid off today. Spend it as you see fit.”

She paused for a minute, her lips moving as if muttering something to herself quietly, then continued. “But know this: you cannot and will not make any friends ever again. You will remain completely devoid of any meaningful human contact or relationships. Doing so will violate our contract. And you must serve me whenever I call. No complaints. No questions asked.”

Suddenly, a document and pen materialized right in front of me. The contract was written in an elegant, almost archaic script, with intricate designs along the borders. I realized now that it was a contract for my new promotion, plus everything she said about relationships and serving her.

My hands trembled as I picked up the pen. I signed the contract, feeling the pen's weight drag across the paper. A strange calm settled over me. I slid the contract back to her.

She looked at it, signed it, and handed it back to me.

“Keep this. It is now for your records,” she said, her voice dripping with satisfaction. “Right, I should mention that you will lose your emotions, your pleasures, your pains as you continue to serve me. Well, the human parts that is. I do not think this is a problem for you, right?”

I nodded in agreement, feeling a cold numbness settle over me.

“Good,” she continued. “Now, can you call Dakari for me? He is next on my list.”

I stood up, shook hands with her, and exited the boardroom. I approached Dakari and spoke to him with a smile. “Hey buddy, you’re next. Good luck. You’ll need it.”

Dakari seemed to be in complete shock when I uttered those words to him. He approached the boardroom slowly, hesitated, then entered it. Somehow, I reveled in it, which is not something I have done before. As I watched him disappear behind the door, a strange sense of satisfaction washed over me. I realized that I had crossed a line, becoming part of the very system I once despised.

I returned to my desk, the contract still clutched in my hand. The office was still eerily quiet, but now it felt different. I felt different. The weight of my decision settled over me, and I knew there was no turning back. I had made my choice, and now I had to live with it.

As I sat down, I glanced at the contract one more time. The elegant script and intricate designs seemed to mock me. I tucked it away in my drawer, knowing that my life had irrevocably changed. The future was uncertain, but one thing was clear: I was no longer the same person who had walked into that boardroom.
