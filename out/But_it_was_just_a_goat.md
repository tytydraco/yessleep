I woke up late that morning to a sharp knock at my attic door. The sound rattled through the wooden frame, jolting me out of a dream I couldn’t remember. My mom’s voice followed, tight with that mix of annoyance and urgency she gets when the goats are out. Again. I groaned, my body heavy with sleep, and fumbled for my jacket. It was one of those mornings where the cold bit right through your clothes, and the sky hung low and gray, like it couldn’t decide whether to rain or just brood.

I stepped outside, the damp grass squelching under my boots. The goats were scattered across the yard, their usual chaos. Most of them were easy enough to herd back into the barn—they knew the drill. But the brown one, the one with the crooked ear and the stupidly happy face, wasn’t having it. He was bouncing around like a kid on a sugar high, chasing after a bird that had flown into the woods. I remember thinking, *Why today?* But I followed him anyway, because that’s what you do when you live on a farm. You chase the damn goats.

The woods were different that morning. I can’t explain it, but they felt... heavier. The trees seemed closer together, their branches twisting like they were trying to block out the light. The air smelled damp, like rotting leaves and wet earth, and the only sound was the crunch of my boots and the occasional distant bleat of the goat. I kept telling myself it was fine, just another chore, but the deeper I went, the more my skin prickled. It was too quiet. Even the birds had stopped singing.

I finally spotted him—the brown goat—standing perfectly still in a patch of sunlight. He was staring at a branch, his head tilted like he was listening to something. For a second, I just watched him, confused. He looked so... peaceful. But then I stepped closer, and that’s when I heard my brother’s voice, sharp and clear from somewhere behind me.

“I got him! You can come back!”

I turned toward his voice, relief flooding me for just a second. But then it hit me—if my brother had the goat, then what the hell was I looking at?

My stomach dropped. I didn’t turn back. I didn’t dare. Something primal in me screamed *don’t,* and I listened. I backed away, step by step, my eyes locked on my brother in the distance. I could feel it behind me—the thing that looked like the goat but wasn’t. Its presence was heavy, wrong, like the air itself was pressing down on me. And then, just as I turned to run, I swear I heard it—a sound that wasn’t a bleat, wasn’t a voice, but something in between. Something wrong.

I ran. I didn’t stop until I was back at the barn, my chest heaving, my hands shaking. My brother was there, holding the real goat, looking at me like I’d lost my mind. Maybe I had. But I knew what I’d seen. Or at least, I knew I’d seen something.

In the weeks that followed, I kept hearing it—the calls. Soft, distant, and unmistakably goat-like. I’d rush to the barn every time, only to find all the goats asleep, their sides rising and falling in the moonlight. The calls weren’t coming from them. They were coming from the woods. From whatever I’d seen that day. And whatever it was, it was still out there, waiting, calling.

I don’t go near those woods anymore. But sometimes, late at night, when the wind is just right, I hear the calls again. And I can’t help but wonder... if I had looked back, what would I have seen?
