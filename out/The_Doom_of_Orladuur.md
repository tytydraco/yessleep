The city of Orladu'ur lies upon a vast plain, bounded on the west by the sea, on the north by the dark blightwater marshes, and on the south by the desert of seven deserts, the arid span of whose sands no mortal has ever known, but to the east, Orladu'ur lies exposed, for to the east no sea or swamp or desert stands guard. 

What has for generations defended Orladu'ur has been its fighting men, its honourable heavy cavalry, and it is to these men-at-arms that the king of Orladu'ur has paid respect by refusing to take, in his city's name, a god of protection. *For it is in the noble hearts of men we place our faith,* is written above the city's only, eastern, gate, and it is upon this gate, and thus upon the east itself, that the greatroom of the king looks out, so that it may be always on his mind: the direction from which the ultimate whelming of Orladu'ur must come.

But the times that pass are to the mortal mind immense, and the city, godless, stands, and though, from time to time, an enemy to the east appears, never has such enemy imperiled Orladu'ur, the rumble of whose sunlit, charging men-at-arms does even in the bravest foe cause trepidation, and always this cavalry returns victorious, wet with the blood of its enemies, and the city remains unvanquished. And it is with ease that men deceive themselves to think that all which they remember is all that ever was, and all that ever was is all that ever can be.

But long now have the years been good, and the seaborne trade fortuitous, conditions under which the very hardth of Orladu'ur has weathered, and although its men-at-arms still return triumphant, welcomed by the eastern gate, the margin of their victories is slimmer, and even they forget that all the foes which they heretofore have faced have been foes of flesh and bone.

Yet there are scourges of another nature, and in the east now stirs a doom of a different kind, whose warriors do not ride orderly with coloured standards but are chaos, ripped from the very essence of the night, and it is in these days, when the sea is restless, and the marshland thick with gases, and the sands of the desert lie heavily upon the land, that the king of Orladu'ur has died and his firstborn son has taken the throne.

Urdelac, he is called, and this is his legend, the legend of the myriad shadows, the weeping mountain, and the doom of Orladu'ur.

When he ascended the throne, Urdelac was forty years old, with a beautiful wife, whom he loved above all, and who had given him five children, four daughters and a son, Hosan. He was, by all accounts, a wise man, and had tested his bravery many times alongside his father’s men-at-arms. And, for a time, Urdelac ruled in peace.

It was in the fourth year of his reign, the year of the comet, that there came galloping into Orladu'ur a lone horserider. He came out of the desert of seven deserts, rode along the city’s wall and entered, nearly dead, by the eastern gate. He requested an audience with the king, which, on Urdelac’s command, was granted. “I come out of the east,” the horserider said, and explained that he was a mercenary, one who had fought, and been defeated, at Orladu'ur many moons ago, “and bring to you a warning, honour-bound as one who was fought against one, that there approaches Orladu'ur an army such as has never been seen, comprised not of men but of shadows, shadows borne by the very edge of darkness.”

Urdelac did not know of what the mercenary spoke, but ordered that the dying man be given food and water and a place to rest, and he convened a council of elders to discuss the mercenary’s warning. “He is wounded and delirious,” the elders agreed. “Whatever he believes he has seen, he has not seen, for what he describes could never be, and whatever is is and, as always, Orladu'ur must keep putting its faith in the noble hearts of its men.” And so, nothing was done, and the mercenary died, and his warnings were forgotten.

But less than four seasons had gone when what had been summer turned prematurely to fall, and a westward wind swept across the vast plain upon which Orladu'ur stood, and as it passed, the wind seemed to some to whisper that all who loved life should accompany it out to the sea, because an evilness approached, an evilness of which even the wind was afraid. But Urdelac, on the advice of his council of elders, stood fast and closed the port, and did not let any man leave the city, and those who tried were caught and executed and their heads were hanged on the eastern gate. But the wind continued to howl, and Urdelac spent many hours alone in his greatroom, gazing out into the east and wondering what could make a thing as great as the wind scream with such perturbation.

Then, one day, in the far distance it appeared, just as the mercenary had foretold, a sheet of night stretched across the width of the plain, and from its unseeable depth were birthed hideousnesses as cannot be named, armed with weapons made of the same unnature as they themselves, and when the people of Orladu'ur saw the sheet and the figures, they were filled with panic, and when Urdelac called to assembly his council of elders, none appeared, for all, in cowardice, had boarded a ship and sailed into the sea. And, for a time, Urdelac, in his wisdom and his bravery, was lost and alone.

Until there spoke to him a voice, saying, “Urdelac, king of Orladu'ur, hear these, the words of Qarlath. Bless your city in my name and pledge your faith to me, and I shall be your salvation.”

But Urdelac answered not Qarlath, and called together instead his men-at-arms, and in the hour of uncertainty, sparked in them a brotherhood stronger than fear, and after saying farewell to their families, the men-at-arms, with Urdelac at their head, thundered out the eastern gate of Orladu'ur to meet in battle the approaching darkness. In their eyes was bloodlust but in their hearts was love, and upon the vast plain of Orladu'ur they fought valiantly. And, valiantly, they were lost.

What remained of the cavalry of Orladu'ur retreated to the safety of the city walls, bathed not in the blood of its enemies but in the blood of fallen brothers. The eastern gate was closed, and preparations were made to defend the city against the impending doom. In his greatroom, Urdelac brooded, staring towards the east so intently not even his wife could lift his spirits. And in the quarters where the wounded warriors lay, and on the field of battle, and everywhere where there was any man who had been touched by the enemy’s blade, once-human bodies blackened, and parts thereof detached, and, slithering, they sped toward the depthless black suspended above the eastern horizon like snakes returning to a nest, and all living men thus marked were put to death in mercy.

Now, in the harsh light of disaster, Urdelac again heard the voice: “Urdelac, king of Orladu'ur, hear these, the words of Qarlath. Bless your city in my name and pledge your faith to me, and I shall be your salvation.” And, this time, Urdelac agreed. And there, in the greatroom beside Urdelac, was Qarlath, god-manifest of the blightwater and protector of the city of Orladu'ur. He loomed above Urdelac, and three times asked him, “Do you, Urdelac, king of Orladu'ur, believe in me?” And, three times, Urdelac said yes. Then Qarlath said: “If truly you believe in me, do as I command: send out, at dawn, a force of thirty men, and at their head let ride your son, Hosan. If you do this, Orladu'ur shall be saved.” But Urdelac refused, arguing with Qarlath that a force of thirty could not hope to defeat an enemy that had already destroyed a force of thousands, to which Qarlath responded, “Do as I command and Orladu'ur shall exist for a thousand years, and then a thousand thousand more, but do else and the city shall fall and be overrun, and all its people consumed and all its buildings ground into dust, and if you shall be remembered, it shall be as Urdelac the Last, king of a city called Orladu'ur, which once stood on a vast plain, between the sea, the marshes and the desert.”

And when he spoke his intention to her, Urdelac’s wife wept.

And, at dawn, when thirty men had been armed and armored and when Urdelac had bid his son goodbye, the thirty rode under Hosan’s command, thundering out the eastern gate, onto the plain, where valiantly they fought against the enemy. And, valiantly, they were lost.

“You have lied to me!” Urdelac cried at Qarlath, but the god-manifest of the blightwater, protector of Orladu'ur, was silent. “I have sacrificed my only son for nothing!” For seven hours, Urdelac raged thus, and for seven hours Qarlath was silent. Then, Urdelac heard soft footfalls approaching, and when he looked, he saw his wife standing in the doorway to the greatroom. Her breath was laboured and her eyes filled with sorrow. Without speaking, she crossed the shadowed length of the greatroom, until she was silhouetted against the window looking out over the east, through which the darkness could be seen, and upon the window sill she laid herself, and thereupon died, the empty bottle of poison slipping from her lifeless hand and falling to the floor.

Urdelac wept.

Upon the window sill, his wife’s dead body appeared strangely dark against the grey sky behind it, dark and peacefully still, and as he gazed upon it, it began to recede, as if through the window, towards the horizon. But even as it did, its absolute size did not change, so that as it moved further away from Urdelac it also grew, until it was the size of the eastern gate, and then the size of the city, and then of the plain, and then it was the size and shape of a mountain, *and it was a mountain,* and the mountain blocked out the sheet of darkness, standing between it and Orladu'ur, so that Urdelac could no more see the approaching doom, and he knew that the mountain was unconquerable and that Orladu'ur was therefore saved.

“It is done,” said Qarlath, appearing behind Urdelac, and all within the city emerged from hiding and climbed to the highest points they could, to, together, gaze upon the newborn mountain that was their salvation.

But even as Urdelac, too, felt their relief, his heart was pain and his soul was empty. His beloved wife and his only son, Hosan, were gone, never to be of the mortal world again. He turned his back on the window, and Qarlath said to him, “You come now upon the experience of power and rule,” and Urdelac detested both. Down, in the city, the people chaunted: “To Urdelac, king of Orladu'ur. Long may he reign! Long may be reign!”

The city of Orladu'ur lies upon a vast plain, bounded on the west by the sea, on the north by the dark blightwater marshes, on the south by the desert of seven deserts, the arid span of whose sands no mortal has ever known, and on the east by the weeping mountain, whose broken peaks nothing shall pass. Its protector god is Qarlath, and many temples have been raised in his name, in which many blood sacrifices are made. On the throne sits Urdelac, a wise and brave man. It is said that when Urdelac remembers what once was, storm clouds appear above the weeping mountain, and their waters rush down the mountainside, through the city and toward the sea. No longer may a man, friend or foe, approach Orladu'ur, except from the west. And then, it is said, a sheet of darkness will sweep down from the House of Qarlath, and swallow the ships [whole.](https://www.reddit.com/r/normancrane)
