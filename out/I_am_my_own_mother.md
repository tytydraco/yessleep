The year's 2021. My name is Lisa and I'm 21 years old. I'm named after my mother Lisa. I was at home doing my work as ussual when I suddenly felt really sick. I went to the bathroom and threw up. I stopped when I suddenly saw a pregnancy test laying on the floor. It was positive. It wasn't mine. I called my husband and started raging at him. He said he knew nothing of it and immediately came home. We had a party earlier that week so maybe it was one of our friends. But we would've found it by now, wouldn't we? Although it seemed odd, we went with that anyway. I wish we hadn't. 

After a few weeks I started to feel sick again, and I haven't had my period yet. A week later, still sick, still no period. I decided to take a pregnancy test and was shocked. It was positive. I called my husband again but this time happy. I called my mom too but she didn't anwser. A few hours later and again, straight to voice mail. This was odd as she always replied to me. 

The next day I called again and still no answer. I went by her house as it was only a few minutes away. Her door was open and the lights were all out. I was scared but still ran inside. I searched everywhere but no one was home. I did notice her phone laying on her bed. I opened it and I was very confused after I read "Enjoy these days Lisa, xx you". It was on her background, and the only thing you could read on any app. It looked very creepy. I walked to her bathroom to wash my face but what I saw made everything worse. Another pregnancy test. I ran out of that house, not even looking if it was positive or not and locked the door. I told my husband and we both went back to my moms house. 

We searched everything up until my husband found something. An old picture of him, but it wasn't old. It was very dusty and dirty, but he looked like it was just taken today. The whole house felt weird and we didn't know what to do. We notified the police of my missing mother as we still had no clue to where she might be. 

8 months later. We have sinds sold our house and moved to my mothers house. I gave birth to a baby girl. Still missing my mom we decided to name her after my mother, Lisa. My daughter was born on July 14th, the same as me at exactly 12am. Only the year wasn't right. It was not 2021. The year was 2000. I only realised the day after. Shocked, creeped, and freaked out I yelled for my husband, but he wasn't there. I had no phone, no identification and no where to go with a new born daughter but home. In my moms car in a city that I knew, but also didn't knew. Everything looked diffrent, but the same. Like it would look 21 years ago. I went home hoping for my husband to be there, but no one. Only an old phone with that same picture of my husband. But now clean, like it was taken not so long ago. I picked up the phone and read an unsent message from my mom, "do you get it now?". 

It has now been 5 years since. I still don't know what happend but it doesn't matter anymore. I love my daughter more than anything and I will do anything to protect her. No matter what.
