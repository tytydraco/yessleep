The road stretched endlessly, dissolving into the horizon like an old memory trying to fade. By the time we reached the outskirts, dusk had already swallowed most of the sky. What lay ahead wasn’t exactly a village anymore — not the kind my parents remembered. It had grown into something in-between; not a city, not the countryside. A place caught halfway through becoming something else, yet never quite arriving.

We were visiting a distant relative, someone my father used to know before time and silence replaced letters. The air felt strange the moment I stepped out of the car — dense, unmoving, as if it had been waiting for us. Children played nearby, their laughter thin, distant, like it came from somewhere else entirely.

Their house stood at the end of a narrow lane, pale and ordinary in the fading light. Yet as soon as I walked in, my breath caught.

It was our house.

The same.
Every corner. Every misplaced chair. Even the faint scrape on the dining table leg — exactly where ours had been.

I laughed nervously, glancing at my parents. “Looks like we’ve been cloned.”

They smiled, but I could tell they felt it too — that quiet unease hiding beneath the absurdity of coincidence.
My father brushed it off saying "Maybe all modern houses look alike these days."

Upon reaching the terrace. The view stretched wide — fields melting into shadow, the faint hum of insects rising like prayer. But the people there — our hosts — spoke strangely. Not wrong, just… delayed, like they were translating thoughts that didn’t quite fit inside their mouths.

Something was wrong.

I said I’d go find my parents downstairs. My cousin, who had come along, followed me for a while before halting midway.

“I need to go back up,” he said quietly.

“What for?”

He didn’t answer, just turned, disappearing up the dim staircase.

When he came down again, a few minutes later, his face had changed. He looked serene. Tranquil in a way that felt unnatural — as if all thought had drained from him.

I tried not to look too long.

Downstairs, everything mirrored home again — the layout, the smell, the framed photo on the wall, the way the light pooled against the curtains. It was like walking through a dream stitched together from memory.

I made my way to what would have been my room.

The moment I stepped inside, something twisted in my chest. It was right, but it wasn’t. The furniture, the arrangement — perfect replicas — but the air was heavier, the colors wrong. The walls seemed dimmer, as if light itself refused to stay.

I stepped out for a second, calling to my parents — and when I turned back, the walls had changed shade entirely.

I froze.

The more I remembered my real room — its blue walls, its window, its faint smell of old books — the more this place seemed to imitate it, reshaping itself according to my thoughts.

That’s when I noticed the corner.

In my actual room, that’s where a small wooden shelf stood — a candle, a cross, my mother’s Bible resting beneath. It was here too. Exactly the same.

I moved closer, the candle flickering faintly in the half-dark. Only it wasn’t a flame. It shimmered — like a memory of fire trapped behind glass. And the cross… it wasn’t wood at all. It seemed to have grown out of the wall, its shape slightly distorted, curved at the edges, as though carved by someone who had only heard what a cross should look like.

A Bible lay beneath it, untouched.
I picked it up.

The cover was perfect — smooth, clean. But when I opened it, the pages were wrong. The words twisted on the paper, shifting shapes that didn’t belong to any language I knew. The longer I stared, the more they writhed, like they were alive.

At the bottom of one page, a line had been scratched in something dark and metallic, something that smelled faintly of rust:

“Faith binds what memory forgets.”

A whisper brushed against my ear — too soft to understand, too close to ignore. The candle flared once, and for a single instant, the cross moved.

That’s when I knew.
This house wasn’t copying ours.
It was worshipping it.
Or us.

I stumbled out, heart hammering, found my cousin — the one who’d come with me — and told him we needed to leave, now. He didn’t question it. We gathered whoever would listen, ignoring the calm, smiling faces that told us it was “peaceful” here, that it “felt right.”

We ran to the car.

As we drove off, the headlights slicing through the mist, I looked back once. The house stood perfectly still. Then, slowly, it began to fade — not vanish, but dissolve, like paint washing off glass.

For a moment, I tried to remember its exact shape. The door, the terrace, the color of the walls. But the more I tried, the less I could recall.

It slipped from memory — piece by piece — until I wasn’t sure if we’d ever been there at all.

That night, when I reached home, I hesitated before unlocking the door.

Because for just one, unbearable second, I couldn’t remember
—if this was the real house.
