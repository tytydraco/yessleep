My memories of the Mounds have been covered in a thick haze. It's a good thing I wrote down everything that I could while it was still fresh. Now, my visit feels more like a surreal nightmare than something I experienced myself. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U)
 
At first, it was small details that went missing, like the shape of those flower petals that shielded me from those traveling along the road. Then after a while  bigger things started to fade away. For example, I'd almost completely forgotten about that funeral procession I'd witnessed, as well as the corpses hanging on the tree. But how could I forget about either of those events? Those are the types of things that should stick with you. 

That being said, there are some aspects of my misadventure that are still vivid. My encounter with the White Son of Mist is one of them. It may sound like I'm speaking out of paranoia when I say this, but I don't think Gwyn would *allow* me to forget a single detail of my interaction with him. The other thing I can't get out of my head is that snake, which has begun to slither about in my dreams. Grinding me and my loved ones up from between its scales like a living meat processor until we're all jumbled together, unable to discern whose pieces belong to who.

I'm only human; so, in that regard, maybe it would be better if I let the memories fade as much as I can. It's not unheard of for those who are fortunate enough to survive the Mounds to lose all traces of their sanity, after all. For my own well-being, I'm not going to fight to keep what I encountered down there in the forefront of my mind. 

The silver lining is that Orion has an official record of the otherworld. Going forward, the plan is to distribute my testimony to the other specialty pest control companies that we have contact with simply because we think that information may be helpful. However, looking back, the post reads like the ramblings of a mad woman. I wouldn't  blame anyone for not taking it seriously.  

After all of that, I found myself longing for my sword. It’s funny. I’d seen it as burdensome when it was first given to me, now I feel vulnerable without it. Not having its weight at my hip actually fills me with a flutter of panic, as if I’d lost a limb.

Is that strange? Is it weird to become so attached to a *weapon*, of all things?

Some good news is that the banjo bastard did not waste any time fixing it up and returning it to me not too long after I was recovered from *that* place. 

For a multitude of reasons, I made sure to show up to my first training session back with a couple of offerings. One of those reasons was to thank him for repairing Ratcatcher. However, my primary motive was to reward him for not only volunteering to lead me out of the Mounds, but also because he managed to refrain from being openly hostile towards Deirdre for once. Maybe some positive reinforcement will Pavlov a conscience into him. 

As such, I arrived with a bottle of wine and a reindeer skull that I’d procured from an oddities store a few towns over. I even went the extra mile and made the skull festive by taping a round, red ornament to where the animal’s nose would have been. 
On the surface, the reindeer skull may appear to be a strange choice for a gift, but if his cabin is anything to go off of, the mechanic’s preferred interior design styles seems to be a mixture of mid century vintage and vulture culture, best described as ‘Ed Geincore.’ Bet *that* aesthetic won’t trend online anytime soon.

While I ventured through the winter, there was what sounded like the groans of a deer. As of writing this, it’s rutting season, and bucks are known to call out while searching for does to mate with. If you aren’t familiar with what their vocalizations sound like, they can be a bit unnerving to hear. It can best be described as a deep, gurgling grunt, or a belch. If you ever hear something like that in the woods, more than likely it’s just a horny buck trying to shoot his shot rather than anything atypical.

However, this eligible bachelor sounded more high pitched than usual. Not wanting to find trouble or risk pissing off the mechanic by being late, I pushed it to the back of my mind for the time being. 

Thankfully, the mechanic seemed to get a kick out of his gifts, snickering, “Ya went and killed yourself a Rudolph. Oughta be ashamed of yourself, ruinin’ Christmas like this!”

“Santa can get headlights like a normal person.” I replied mildly. “That’s for leading me out of the Mounds. The wine’s for the sword repair. Are they acceptable?”

He pulled the fake Rudolph nose off, examining the skull’s teeth as he commented. “This your way of tryin’ to keep yourself outta debt?”

I was afraid he’d say something like that. 

“They’re tokens of my appreciation.” I assured him before adding. “And if we’re trying to build goodwill between our organizations, one of us indebting the other would definitely *not* be the way to do it.”

He set the skull down gingerly, taking more care of those bones than he ever would a living thing before smirking at me. “Don’t worry, Fiona. I’m just fuckin’ with you.”


*Prick.*

Before I could say anything, Iolo had produced Ratcatcher. This may sound odd, but tears pricked in my eyes when I saw that its blade had been repaired. When I accepted the sword from him, I felt the same aching relief that is normally reserved for finding out that a loved one had made a miraculous recovery after a bad accident. 

Don’t ask me to explain why I reacted so strongly. I can’t either. Maybe I am losing my mind, despite my best efforts. All I can say is that it’s nice not to feel naked anymore.

While I slid Ratcatcher back into its rightful place on my belt, Iolo began poking at the fire he’d started before I got there, trying to build it large enough to keep the clearing somewhat tolerable to be in on that frigid night. With it getting colder, training has been even more unpleasant than usual. There are times where it feels like Ratcatcher’s hilt will be permanently frozen to my palm, or like the joints in my hand will seize and simply stop moving all together, even while wearing gloves. The fire helps, but with how low temperatures have been getting and how bitter that wind is, it only goes so far. 

While searching through the contents of his coat’s pockets, of all things, he pulled out a [spindle of thread with a needle stuck into its top.](https://www.reddit.com/r/atypicalpests/s/X3MgpXOo78) That was unexpected. Maybe he has some hobbies besides maiming, music, and murder. 

Thinking that I was being funny, I commented, “You're a grandma, you know that?”

He narrowed his eyes at me, “Come again?”

“Sewing, old-timey music, being impatient with young people.” I explained, watching as his exasperation grew with each word I spoke. “Bonus points if you store the thread in an old cookie tin. Just need some grandkids and the transformation will be complete.”

Abruptly, the annoyance gave way to mischief as the corner of the bastard’s mouth lifted, “You offerin’ to help me start that process, Fiona?”  

Maybe I should've spared myself the discomfort and embarrassment by dying in the Mounds.

“I have no interest in being your granddaughter.” I said flatly, preferring to play dumb rather than engage with the true meaning behind his words. 

Judging by the way he guffawed after my response, it wasn't a genuine pass at me. His motive, most likely, had been the same thing as it always was: wanting to get under my skin. 

Even so, I fought the urge to punch him when he winked at me, “Suit yourself.”

While he fed more kindling into the firepit, Iolo casually asked me what I remembered about my time in the Mounds. I pretty much told him the exact same thing I told yinz at the beginning of this update. No use repeating the same information twice. 

After I was done giving my fractured recollection, I mused, “I can't believe I was really gone for three days.” 

“Believe it.” He replied, staring into the flames, his expression unreadable. “Woulda been longer if your *friend* hadn’t gotten me.”

Something I’d forgotten to mention in my last update was that Deirdre had sought Iolo out when Vic couldn’t get anything out of the Replacement himself. In my defense, I was still trying to process everything I’d seen and was focused primarily on writing out as much as I could before I lost everything. It had simply slipped my mind. 

Regardless, even though this wasn’t new information for me, it still was jarring to hear it come from him. 

“Do I want to know what you did to the imposter?” I asked cautiously.

Iolo’s smile told me that I probably made a mistake by inquiring about it. 

He simply said, “Listen.”

Dread crawled from my gut and up into my throat as it dawned on me that the grunts I'd mentioned earlier and had been hearing consistently since I entered the woods weren't from a deer after all. 

The Replacement was *still alive.* 

“I’ll let it die when it’s been three days.” Iolo informed me, his voice even colder than the eight degree windchill we were standing in. “Only fair, since that’s how long you were down there.”

For reference, when I had this conversation with the mechanic, only two days had passed since my rescue. 

I don’t know what he did to the Replacement to make it sound like that, and I wasn’t masochistic enough to go looking for it or to question him any further. There was the chance it was still wearing my face. After what I’d been through, I didn’t think my ptsd could handle seeing a copy of myself mutilated like that, despite knowing that it had callously left me in the Mounds for dead.

Seemingly out of the blue, he casually changed the subject as he told me, “Still don’t like that keening woman. Too condescendin’ for my likin’. And that waif act drives me up the fuckin’ wall. But after this, I’ll admit that I find her *slightly* less insufferable than I did before.”

I stared at him in disbelief, wondering if I'd somehow misheard him. That was an astonishing statement coming from him. It was damn near close to a compliment. An extremely back-handed one, granted, but it was still in the ballpark of being favorable. 

“Careful, mechanic. You keep talking and you might make the mistake of saying something that could be misconstrued as nice.” I quipped as I did my best to ignore the ongoing sounds of the Not Nessa’s anguish. 

He snorted, shaking his head at me, “Alright, we best get started. For one, it's colder than the ninth circle o’ hell out here. For another, you're about to get on my nerves.”

“No Briar or Houndmaster?” I questioned. 

Iolo gave me a smile, “Nope. Mother said I was fit to fly again. Why, you ain't missin’ ‘em, are ya?”

*Not the thorny boi.*

Maybe I was a little too honest, “I'll decide that when I see how well you're moving.”

At that, the grin turned devious, “Well, maybe this'll help you make up your mind: no clover. You're gonna be dealin’ with the illusion tonight.”

“Is that because of the changeling?” I asked apprehensively. 

“Nope. Just couldn't find one.” Iolo replied lightly, though his expression sobered. “But since you brought it up, I want you to tell me *exactly* how that lil’ shit got one over on you. Guessin’ those spores got to you?”

I nodded as I confirmed that there had been a fungal scent in the air that made me dizzy. 

Suddenly, an alarming thought occurred to me, “Hold on, you're not going to drug me, are you?”

“Not this time,” Was his concerning answer. “But I do wanna get you inoculated against ‘em. Over time, you can build up resistance. That'll come later. For now, I wanna see what you can do against somethin’ you ain't really seein’.”

It may sound hard to believe, but fighting Iolo when he's pretending to be human is a lot more challenging than dealing with the Dragonfly. It's more difficult to gauge his reach, and along with that, he is a smaller target. Not being able to go for his wings also took away his most accessible weak spots. 

To top it off, the mechanic was moving a lot better than he had in a long time; the best I’d seen since the night the cookie hag tore his wings off. He still wasn't quite as quick and agile as he had been before the injury, but all in all, it seems like he’s starting to get more used to his prosthetics. 

And, of course, he was being a total dick about it. Popping up behind me to tap on my shoulder, only to disappear again. I didn't take the bait. Instead, I waited, keeping Ratcatcher in front of my chest, its point facing up to the sky, knowing that he'd get bored of messing with me eventually. 

In the corner of my right eye, there was movement. However, I knew better, so I slashed towards my left instead. 

The mechanic blocked it with the wooden sword, snickering, “Not fallin’ for that anymore!”

“You're getting predictable.” I spat out before pirouetting away from him, avoiding his retaliation. 

Unfortunately, he took that as a challenge. He had a dark look in his eye, staying on me, making me deflect blow after blow. 

*I shouldn't have said anything!*

I couldn't let him keep pushing me. If I got cornered, he'd *really* give me trouble. Everywhere I went, he cut me off, not relenting or giving me any opportunities to get somewhere more fortuitous. 

If an opportunity wasn't going to present itself, I was going to have to make one. 

I parried him, exactly like how the Houndmaster had taught me. Afterwards, I kicked him square in the chest. He fell back slightly, quickly regaining his senses before I could slash the sword across his torso. 

His laugh almost sounded genuine, “Gettin’ better! You're startin’ to look like ya know what you're doin'.”

I knew what that edge in his voice meant. He was up to something. But what else is new? It's *Iolo.* 

I feigned high, then went low, fully prepared to deal with whatever bullshit he was going to throw at me. At least, I *thought* I was prepared. However, when he parried my strike, he maneuvered his blade in a way that twisted my wrist and wrenched Ratcatcher from my grasp. 

*Shit!* I ducked away, trying to circle around him so that I could get the sword back. Without anything to block him with, I had no other option but to avoid him if I didn't want to get bludgeoned. He began herding me, not letting me anywhere near Ratcatcher. With how quick he is, he didn't give me any chances to get out of the path he was forcing me onto. 

My back hit a tree. The dull blade of the wooden sword touched my throat as the bastard smirked at me, “How's that for predictable?”

While he was gloating, I kicked, aiming for his instep. He was on me in a second, inches away, the side of the blade pressing against me slightly harder than before. I'd expected him to be angry, but instead, he seemed to find this all funny. 

“You yield?” Iolo asked, grinning like the jagoff he is. 

This time, I tried kneeing him. He flinched, but didn't let me out from between him and the tree, shaking his head slowly at me as he snickered softly. 

For the duration of that training session, the Replacement’s grunts remained in the background of our sparring. But while pinned, I heard them as if they were right next to me. 

“So damn stubborn.” Iolo remarked. “Pain in the arse, is what you are.”

Silently promising that I'd nick him with the iron blade as revenge, I glared at him. “I yield.”

Iolo stepped back, letting me pick my sword off the ground. With that, we were going again. 

And yes, I did graze him. Just on the hand, but even small victories count. 

When it comes to the inoculation talk, I'm not looking forward to whatever that process entails. After witnessing those seeds being planted in Iolo’s back, I already knew that the Neighbors had their own types of medical treatments, so the concept of otherworldly vaccinations wasn't too outlandish. But if it keeps more incidents like that from occurring, I'm willing to suck it up. Might even be something for my coworkers to look into, since I doubt I'm going to be the only employee to get exposed to such spores. 

On another subject, I do have a few major updates regarding Deirdre. 

She has been experiencing some changes since she broke her curse. We discovered one of them during one of the rare, coveted slow days for Orion. Believe it or not, we do get those sometimes. 

Since we didn’t have much better to do, the boss enlisted Deirdre’s help in fixing up the wound on his neck. Before she could get started on that, she first had to remove the clumsy stitches that he’d done himself. Despite trying to be as gentle as possible, I could see Victor gripping the arms of his desk chair with white knuckles. 

On one hand, slow days are nice. Gives us a chance to catch our breath, especially with the workload we've had over the past year. On the other hand, Reyna and I both tend to get bored very quickly, and when that happens, the only way to resolve that is to annoy our coworkers about it. 

Considering that the boss was busy, Wes was our target this time.

He was updating our computer records, head down diligently as he trudged through reports with one hand propping his chin up. Reyna smirked at me as if to say, ‘watch this!’ then strode to his desk to loom over our colleague with a dead-eyed stare. 

Wes didn't acknowledge her at first. She simply continued staring at him, remaining completely motionless. 

Eventually, without looking up, he asked with his tone dripping in condescension, “May I *help* you?”

Without a word, Reyna reached forward and knocked over the cup that he used to hold pens on his desk, causing every writing utensil to cascade across his keyboard, then walked away. I bit my lip to keep from laughing as Wes’ eyes slid up to glower at her. 

Completely deadpan, he asked, “Really?”

Without glancing back at the vampire, Reyna darted back to her own station. However, I knew her well enough to recognize that it was taking all of her willpower to keep from cracking up. Wes kept watching her like a hawk, shining eyes intense. Waiting for her to break. She ended up having to lower her chair so that he couldn't see her sputtering like a balloon that had sprung a leak. 

Deirdre, momentarily distracted by our antics, looked over to see what the fuss was about. As she did so, the needle slipped and she ended up pricking herself. To everyone’s bewilderment, she *flinched.* 

As she stared at her bleeding finger in amazement, Victor questioned, “Did you feel that?” 

Still staring wide-eyed at the bead of blood on her fingertip, she stammered, “It didn't- it didn't hurt, but *yes.*”

I rushed over with one of my spare bandaids in hand as I asked with equal curiosity and concern, “If it didn't hurt, then what did it feel like?”

While I gently dressed the small wound for her, she explained in wide-eyed shock, “There was… pressure. Or perhaps a pull is the best way to describe it. I felt the needle tugging at my skin.”

“Can you feel the bandaid?” I asked, grimacing at her description before delicately cradling her hand in mine. 

*Or that? I hope you can.*

Her brows furrowed as she shook her head, “I'm afraid not. It was just the needle.”

“It’s something,” Victor supplied as the needle in question hung from the thread that was partially woven through his neck, swaying like a pendulum. “You might regain more sensation over time. Makes sense it would start out small.”

Experimentally, Deirdre pinched her forearm. I cringed when I saw her skin tent, eventually turning stark white from her effort. Eventually, she let out a soft hum of disappointment, then released her arm. There was already a dark bruise forming. 

“It must be extremes,” She remarked. “At least starting out. The pressure wasn't tangible until I used all of my strength.”

That made me frown, “It seems cruel that the first thing that can get through is something that hurts you.” 

She shrugged, her nonchalant answer making my heart break a bit, “Even pain is preferable to nothing.”

With that, she went back to finishing up her draugr flesh quilt. That was a brand new sentence, by the way. Glad we all got to experience it together. 

Another noteworthy development in her condition came about while she was on a call with Reyna. Once they returned, I was informed that Deirdre had gotten some salt on her by accident when they were working on securing a house located by the crossroads that had been affected by some snow people-related disturbances. Apparently, the salt only gave her hives as opposed to the typical lesions that Neighbors experience. 

As of right now, we're not sure if the end result of this transition will be that she’ll become human, or if she’s transforming into something else entirely. All that we can conclude at the moment is that Deirdre is definitely not a Weeper anymore. And as far as I or my coworkers are aware of, she is the only one of her kind to undergo this process. 

Deirdre admitted the other day, “I almost feel like a walking experiment.” 

Naturally, that worried me, “What makes you say that?” 

“I'm not necessarily saying that as a bad thing,” Deirdre assured me quickly, then took a deep breath before confessing. “It's just a bit daunting to be the first. To not know what lies ahead.”

That made sense. A lot of sense. There were numerous terrifying unknowns that she was faced with, especially in regards to the way her body was being altered. 

“I imagine it would be intimidating.” I acknowledged gently. 

She then gave me a small smile as she said, “At least I’m not alone through this.”

She wanted to be held then. I readily obliged, squeezing her tightly, savoring the scent of the rosy shampoo she’s been favoring as I cradled her head against my chest. I've always found the smell of roses comforting. They remind me of Grandma's garden. 

As I embraced her, Deirdre’s hands traced my back as if she were willing the nerves in her fingertips to break through the atrophy they’ve been held in for what had to have been centuries. After some time of basking in each other's presence, she raised her head, tilting her chin up to kiss me. I wish I could say that we had a fairy tale moment and that this kiss had magically granted her the ability to feel again, but sadly, this is real life.

When we pulled apart, she whispered, “I want to feel you *so* badly. More than anything.”	

That makes two of us. Even something as innocent as holding hands brings me guilt for the simple fact that only one of us can indulge in it. It seems unjust that I can feel her warmth, yet she can’t take in mine.

On a more immediately distressing note, one of my worst fears in regards to work has been confirmed: there is Hunger Grass somewhere in town. 

We learned of it when a client called us in a panic. It was difficult to hear her over the sound of someone pounding on her door. 

She shrieked, “He bit me! Oh god, *he bit me!* Am I going to become like him?!”

Oh God, *what* bit her? But identifying her attacker had to wait; the first thing that needed to happen was to make sure that whatever was after her couldn't reach her. 

“Ma'am, the first thing you need to do is to place salt in a straight, uninterrupted line across the threshold of your door. That should stop ‘him’ from coming in.” I told her, balancing my tone between sounding authoritative enough that she'd feel compelled to listen to me, and remaining compassionate so that she'd know I was making an honest effort to help her. 

There was rustling from the other end of the phone as the assault on her door continued. 

“It’s going to break the door down!” The client sobbed shakily. 

“Not if you can get the salt there in time,” I assured her urgently. “I know you're scared, but I need you to trust me, alright? It *will* work.”

To tell the truth, without knowing what was pursuing her, I couldn't be certain of that. However, the last thing the client needed in her situation was uncertainty; she needed to have faith that the salt would be enough to save her. 

The client yelped, but since I could still hear her heavy, shaking breath from the other line, I could be assured that she was still alive. Thankfully, the banging on her door sounded as if it had lightened up until it was gradually reduced to weakened knocks. Eventually, she calmed down enough to confirm to me that the salt line was in place. 

I let out a sigh of relief, thankful for possibly the millionth time in my life that salt is such a reliable tool. Then I asked her to recount what happened. 

The client had received a knock on her door. Since she'd been expecting a delivery for a Christmas gift that she'd been wanting to hide before her kids came home, she hurriedly opened it without question. Suffice to say, it wasn't a FedEx driver that she found on her doorstep. Instead, she found what appeared to be an emaciated man on her front porch, holding a clay bowl in one quivering hand. Shocked by his appearance, she asked him if he needed help, thinking at first that he must've been sick.  

All that her visitor had said before taking a chunk out of her arm was: “*Hungry.*”

Luckily, she'd been able to push him off of her long enough to slam the door in his face, calling us soon after. 

“Oh *God,* he's talking to me again!” She whimpered. 

Quickly, I questioned, “What's he saying?”

“He just… he keeps telling me he's hungry.”

This wasn’t just any type of revenant. This was something that needed to be handled with the utmost delicacy. I'm not exaggerating when I say that a wrong move could have jeopardized not only our client's safety, but the overall well-being of our operating area. 

“Ma'am, this is going to sound strange, but do you happen to have any bread in the house?”

She confirmed that she did, and I explained what she needed to do. And then she began to overthink. “Does it matter if it's multigrain, or Italian, or do you think he would prefer Naan? I have tortillas…”

“Uh, it doesn't matter.” I told her. “As long as it's bread, he'll be satisfied.”

However, this time, the client hesitated. When I patiently asked her what was the matter, she confessed to me fearfully, yet honestly that she couldn't do it. For this, she apologized over and over. Waving Deirdre over, I assured the client that it was okay and that if she was willing to wait, I could go over there to offer her guest some bread on her behalf. 

While I set off to do that, Deirdre stayed on the line with her, intending to keep her calm while I rushed to the client's address. 

During the drive, I hoped that the Hungry Man wouldn't mind that the bread I was offering him had peanut butter and jelly on it. According to our records, it shouldn't, but Neighbors can be finicky. The last thing anyone needed was for him to become even more aggressive. If he didn't like it, I could potentially convince the client to hand me some bread out her window, if need be. 

When I pulled into the client’s driveway, I saw why she'd initially felt sorry for him.

The Hungry Man was gaunt, his green-gray skin stretched tightly over his frail, angular frame. His cheeks were hollow, his dark eyes seeming to be swallowed by the ridges of his skull. Tattered rags that had served as clothing at one point hung from his pointed shoulders, revealing the prominent curves of his ribs. Like the client had described, he clutched a stained clay bowl with spindly fingers. As that hand trembled, it fell from his grip, clattering to the porch without breaking, the sound like a gunshot. 

The Hungry Man's glittering eyes honed in on me, as ravenous as a wild dog. The client's blood stained his mouth. 

Keeping my voice even, I announced, “On behalf of this homeowner, I have brought food for you.” 

The Hungry Man bent down to retrieve his bowl, shuffling towards me on stiff legs. His gait was uneven as his entire body shook from weakness. I met him halfway, holding the sandwich out to him cautiously, keeping the other hand on Ratcatcher’s hilt in case the Hungry Man decided he'd prefer to take the phrase about ‘biting the hand that feeds you’ a bit too literally. 

Those eyes watched eagerly as I delicately set the sandwich into his bowl. Mouth watering, he seized it just as the bread touched the unglazed clay surface. I barely had enough time to retrieve my hand before he'd inhaled it. 

I darted back, hand gripping the sword even harder as I feared that I'd be dessert. Licking the remaining blood and jelly off of his cracked lips, the Hungry Man offered me a smile, showing off perfect white teeth. A dentist's dream. 

“The homeowner is most gracious,” The Hungry Man said. “In the approaching troubles, she and all others under her roof will be cared for.”

Naturally, that statement made me uneasy. “Troubles?”

Instead of answering, he turned to leave, his grip on the clay bowl still just as fragile as it had been before. As much as I wanted answers, I couldn't focus on his ominous words, at the moment. I had to check on the client. 

She was still on the phone with Deirdre when she apprehensively answered the door. Blood coated her plump forearm from a swollen, jagged dent left by the Hungry Man's peculiarly pristine teeth. The sight of it made me shudder. It definitely needed stitches. 

The client was understandably shaken up and her arm looked like something straight out of a zombie movie, but otherwise, she was alright. I assisted her in dressing the wound to staunch the bleeding before offering to drive her to the emergency room.

The entire time, Deirdre stayed on the phone with her. I overheard them talking about choir, of all things. They apparently had bonded over both being mezzos (I have no idea what that means.) The client was trying to encourage Deirdre to join. 

Upon reflection, that seems to be where Deirdre’s strength at Orion has been: client relations. It may not seem like much, but when it comes to making a client feel safe, or trying to keep them level-headed enough that they'll listen to our advice, it's a useful thing. A big part of this job *is* customer service, after all. 

In regards to the prevention of any further incidents, the client has been advised to leave an offering of bread out on her porch nightly. Even something small will be appreciated by the Hungry Man. Or covered in peanut butter, apparently. 

As a victim of the Hunger Grass, no matter how much the Hungry Man eats, his belly will remain forever empty. Have you ever been so ravenous that your stomach begins to cramp? Every movement is hindered by shakes. You're light-headed and exhausted. All you want is to *eat.* Now, imagine feeling that way for an eternity. *That* is the curse of the Hunger Grass.  

That all being said, these Neighbors are much more powerful than they appear. They have single-handedly caused the ruin of kings and, in turn, granted unimaginable prosperity to paupers. Those who are generous enough to offer the Hungry Man a meal, even a small one, will be blessed with good luck for the rest of their lives. On the flip side, mocking or attempting to harm the starving Neighbor causes one to share in their dreadful starvation until they eventually wither away from malnutrition. 

As frightening as this has been for the client, she and her family will be rewarded as long as they keep up on offerings. From what I hear around the village, they've already begun to reap the benefits. 

Case in point, there was a lot of hubbub amongst the townies about how the client’s husband was unexpectedly granted an incredible settlement upon winning a *decades* long court battle after experiencing a disabling injury at one of the oil refineries. Along with that, their daughter apparently received a full scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania.

When it comes to the thing the Hungry Man had said about impending ‘troubles,’ I also should mention that these Neighbors have been known to appear during times of hardship and famine. His very presence is a bad omen, not just because of his association to Hunger Grass, but because of what may lie ahead for Orion's operating area.

In general, some of the counties we work in tend to be home to struggling areas. Dying industrial towns left to rot after the populations’ jobs were shipped overseas. Local farms busting their asses to keep up with huge industrial farms across the country. There are some middle class and upper middle class suburban developments here and there, but broadly speaking, many people have been hit by hard times. Food insecurity is an unfortunate reality for many of these places. 

To summarize, I can't say I'm surprised that a Hungry Man has ended up here.

It is said that one can protect themselves against the Hunger Grass’ influence by carrying a crust of bread in a pocket. However, it isn't an airtight method of prevention; depending on the severity of the curse on the area, the bread may not be enough to save someone who's found themselves in contact with it. That, and imagine just having dry, crumbly bread in your pocket all the time. You'd be a walking anthill. 

As of right now, we're trying to find where the Hunger Grass could be, and along with that, what could've even *caused* its growth. I've mentioned previously that one of the hypotheses surrounding its occurrence is that the Neighbors may plant it out of spite. Deirdre had confirmed this for us when we all got together to discuss what had happened. However, since its appearance was so recent, she didn't know where the Hunger Grass could've taken root. 

Lucky me, I know three Neighbors who are well-versed in the art of torturing mortals. To be clear. I don't believe the Hunters were responsible for planting it. For one, none of them seem like they'd be much into gardening (not even Grandma Iolo), and for another, they appear to prefer to be more direct when it comes to their methods. However, they could give us a lead on either where to find it or what brought it here.
