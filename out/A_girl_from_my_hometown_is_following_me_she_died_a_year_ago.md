Hello reddit people. Something has been happening to me, but I can’t tell anyone in my life. Nobody would believe me. But I have a feeling it's getting worse. 

My name is Reagan Matthews. I am 16 years old. I live in a small town in Nebraska. About a year ago, a young woman in our community died from a sudden brain aneurysm. She was 16, and collapsed at a highschool football game. Something to note about me, I have a brain aneurysm, I’ve known since I was 6. It has never been much of a concern, but always something in the back of my thoughts. The girl's name was Margot. She had shoulder length dark ringlet curls and green eyes. She was head of the student council, and a pretty popular girl all around. 

It started about a month and a half ago. I was riding my bike down my street to a babysitting job. It was a warm, light, early summer evening. Down the street I saw a young woman walking in my direction about 30 yards away. Nothing out of the ordinary. I couldn’t get a clear look at her features, but to be fair, I wasn’t really looking. From afar she appeared to be rubbing her head. I looked down for a second to scratch my knee, and when I looked up again she was gone. Again, I didn't think twice about it, but looking back on it after recent events, this doesn't make any rational sense. There is no street parking, and the houses lining the street have somewhat large yards with scarce trees. There is no way to just vanish in the split second I looked down. 

A few weeks later I was driving with my mom on the way to a doctor's appointment. I had started getting headaches, nothing too bad, but I had never gotten them before. As we pulled into the parking lot, a teen walked out of the building. She had shoulder length dark curly hair, and was wearing a pink shirt, and jean shorts. I only spotted her from the corner of my eye, and didn't really see her that well, as she was about 20 yards away. When I looked up to get a better view, she was gone. Again, I thought “weird, but whatever”. I tucked the moment away, and did not mention it, although I somewhat subconsciously connected the two events. 

About a week ago I got a ride to the pharmacy to get medication for my headaches. They were steadily getting worse. As my mom talked to the pharmacist, I browsed the aisles looking for a twix bar. As I turned to the candy aisle, I saw her again. Dark curly hair, tall, pink shirt, jean shorts. I got a sudden  pang of pain, and grabbed my face. When I pulled my hand away, she was gone. But this time I was sure that this was the same person. The same person, same clothes, from the bike ride, and doctors visit. But who was she? It's a small town. Just a coincidence.  

But today as I was walking to a friend's house I saw her. Her whole face. She passed me. We made eye contact. Green eyes, coily hair, tan skin. I’m sure. 

Why is she following me? Why is she getting closer? I need help guys. I'll update in the morning, but I can't write anymore. My head is pounding. This might be the worst headache I've ever had.
