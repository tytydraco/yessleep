The Owl Above the Door

It started with the door creaking open in the dead of night. No breeze stirred the room, yet the door swung lazily on its hinges. I’d lock it before bed, and by morning, it would be ajar. At first, I blamed the humidity, the warped wood of an old house. But then I noticed the scratches.

Tiny, deliberate scratches around the doorframe, like something had been climbing.

One evening, as I closed the door and secured the latch, I glanced up. That’s when I saw it—perched above the door like a grotesque gargoyle. An owl. Its eyes gleamed faintly in the dim light, twin coins of molten gold. Its feathers were matted and dark, blending into the shadows of the ceiling. It didn’t move, didn’t blink. It just stared.

“Hoot,” it murmured, but the sound was sharp, mocking.

I laughed nervously and waved it off. “Shoo! Go on!”

It tilted its head, impossibly far, as if pondering my command. Then it leaped, spreading its wings—massive wings that seemed too big for such a small creature. It vanished into the hallway with a rustle of feathers, leaving only a faint draft and the unsettling feeling that it hadn’t really left.

The small inconveniences began the next day. My keys disappeared from the hook by the door, turning up hours later in the freezer. My phone battery drained inexplicably overnight, though I had plugged it in. I’d find drawers half-open, contents slightly rearranged. At first, I thought I was losing my mind. Then I found the feather.

A black, greasy feather lying on my keyboard.

The owl was back that night. I saw it sitting on the bookshelf, talons curling around the edges of my books. It stared at me with those luminous eyes, unblinking. This time, it didn’t hoot. It just watched as I tried to focus on my work. Every time I glanced up, it was still there. Watching.

I tried to get rid of it. I opened windows, left food outside, even bought an ultrasonic bird repellent. The owl didn’t care. It was always there—perched on the top of my monitor, or the edge of the coffee table, or, worst of all, above the door. Its favorite spot.

And then it got bolder.

One night, as I lay in bed, I felt a weight on my chest. My eyes shot open, and there it was—sitting on me, its talons lightly pressing into my skin. Its eyes burned with cruel intelligence. “Hoo,” it whispered, and for the first time, I swore it smiled.

“You’re not real,” I whispered, my voice trembling.

The owl tilted its head and hopped off me, gliding silently out of the room. But before it disappeared, it knocked over a glass of water on my nightstand with a flick of its wing, spilling it onto my phone.

I began to realize it wasn’t just an owl. It was something more. It wasn’t here to hurt me—not physically. No, its purpose was far worse. It was here to annoy me into madness.

It deleted my saved files seconds before I submitted them. It turned off the coffee maker after I’d left the room. It unplugged my Wi-Fi router at the most inconvenient times. And no matter how many times I changed the passwords on my devices, it somehow got in.

One morning, I opened my laptop to find a new folder on my desktop titled “>:}”. Inside were hundreds of images of the owl, all taken from my webcam.

I smashed the laptop with a hammer.

Desperation turned to fury. “What do you want?” I screamed one night, clutching a broom like a weapon.

The owl, perched as always above the door, stared at me with those glowing eyes. Then, for the first time, it spoke in a voice that wasn’t a hoot.

“You left the window open.”

“What?”

“It’s my house now.”

I don’t sleep anymore. The owl won’t let me. It taps on the walls, scratches at the furniture, whispers nonsense into my ears. I tried to leave, but the car wouldn’t start. The bus station was closed. Every time I step outside, I see it in the distance, perched on a power line or a lamppost, its golden eyes never leaving me.

Now, it’s not just an owl. I see it in the shadows, in the corners of my vision, in the static of my television. It’s everywhere, always watching, always waiting. I don’t know what it wants, but I know I’ll never escape.

Because it’s not just an owl.

It’s malice incarnate.

And it’s never leaving.
