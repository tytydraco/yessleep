I’ll try to keep it to the point and not drift off to much, but I swear on everything this is a true story of my own experience.

When I was 12 and 13 I lived with my aunt for a few years with my younger cousin. We lived in a little house on a dead end road in a small town of about 500 people… we’re technically considered a village. 
My aunt was an odd soul, everyone has their own rhythm and hers was a different rhythm for sure. She had a fascination with the odd and the strange. From a musical dancing miniature jester figurine to old newspapers from the 20’s. Then enter her collection of porcelain masks of which she had more than 30 of. All different sizes and styles and she had them all over her bedroom walls. 

The house we lived in was small but cozy, but this house had other paranormal events happen in it before and after the events of this story take place. So it was no big deal when small stuff would happen because we were odd so some stuff being harmless was fine by us. None of what happened before or after was harmful, this was the only event I was actually stricken with pure fear. 

It was my 13th birthday and for my birthday I wanted us all to watch a horror movie together cause those are my favorite kind still to this day. We watched “A haunting in Connecticut” as the chosen movie. It was my aunt and uncle, their 3 kids, my two friends and myself there to watch it! After the movie. We all just kinda crashed so I went to my aunts room to sleep cause it was the only other room with a tv, one of those old box tvs that would go full static every now and again. 

I get in there and put something on quietly and go to sleep but I wake up a couple hours later and the room is pitch black other than the light from the static on the tv which if you know is not very much, it’s basically a straight low beam the makes some stuff visible but anything outside that vicinity gets harder and harder to see, but I can see all her masks clearly. I went to get up to change the channel and I noticed I couldn’t move. It was like some sort of sleep paralysis, my eyes could move but my body couldn’t. 

So I just laid there briefly trying to wait for my body to realize, when I heard a sound like someone taping their nails on the closet door.. just like a little 4 tap I’m sure we all do when we’re bored. But it caught my attention and I fix my eyes on the closet door waiting to hear it again. Within about a minute I had glance to the wall that the closet was on at my aunts masks when I noticed one was missing, and l knew because it was the one I had gotten her for Mother’s Day. 

I did a double take cause I knew where it was always hung. I didn’t pay too much mind to it till I had look back at the tv and could barely see the missing mask that was missing off the wall now barely out of light behind the tv. I knew it was the mask by the little pink flower pattern on the left cheek. At first I thought my aunt had moved it. But no longer than I had that thought, the mask started to raise very, very slowly. 

Raising to the ceiling and slowly making with way to direct over my face in the bed where it stayed for a couple seconds before slowly descending to what felt like right over my face. I tried to close my eyes but it didn’t help, I couldn’t scream it was just like the enormous pressure being pushed at me. I could feel it looking at me and could practically see it doing it with my eyes closed. 

Then out of nowhere the pressure lifted and I heard the mask break from falling. It fell directly about where it originally hung by the closet. I laid there practically in tears not able to do anything about it. Then it sounded like someone shaking the bedroom door as hard as possible trying to get in but it wasn’t locked. My aunt and uncle woke up to the sound of the door shaking and came to see what they thought I was doing till they got in front of the door and it swung open on its own. 

As soon as the door opened it was like my body woke up and I sat up and screamed as loud as possible and pushed to the corner in the bed crying, that’s when I told them what happened. They knew by the way I was acting that I wasn’t kidding and they would’ve probably doubted it a bit had it not been for the door opening on its own.. but that’s the end of this one. I have many more others than this one.
