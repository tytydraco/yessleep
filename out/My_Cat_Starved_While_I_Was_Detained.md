Last week I was arrested. No, it was two weeks ago, I've lost my sense of time. I wasn't even involved in any of the so-called civil unrest. I was just walking home from work, hungry and tired and I couldn't wait to see my little Lucy Fur. She was an adorable black kitten, with white socks and a paintbrush tail. She was perfect, and I loved her very much.

It was early evening, and there was this weird crow following me and cawing at me obnoxiously. I hate crows, they are so gross and annoying. I would never do anything to hurt an animal, but it wouldn't leave me alone, so I kinda swung my backpack up in the air under the branch it was on. I wasn't trying to hit it, and it flew away, somehow getting the message that I was tired of its nonsense. But it seemed the little fricker got me in trouble. It was bad luck, either the crow or me driving it away.

Two female police stopped and got out of their car and ran over and tackled me. They pushed a nightstick against my neck and held me down and roughly handcuffed me. Then they told me I was under arrest and one of them said, "And those are your rights, bitch" without actually giving me any rights or anything, just "You're arrested" and that.

I was in the back of their squad car, and it smelled really gross, like vomit and body odor and alcohol. I could see my kitten in the window of my studio as we drove past my home, on the way to the substation. They stopped there and another police officer came outside, holding a coldpack over the side of his temple, and he pointed at me and said I was the one.

I'm pretty sure they had the wrong person, since I was at work all day. I straight up told them that, and they said: "No, you weren't. You're lucky we're only taking you to jail, after his partner."

I found out when we got to the county lockup that the officer who had identified me had lost his partner earlier, during the so-called civil unrest. While dealing with some looters who were using the nearby so-called civil unrest as an opportunity to smash and grab and commit vulgar acts of vandalism that destroyed the lives of families that worked hard to build their small businesses, he was lost. And by lost, I mean some bricks got thrown and he was killed.

They were certain I was the one who killed the cop. Suddenly, aspects of my arrest became clearly terrifying. They had considered just taking me out somewhere and executing me, that's what they had meant. I wasn't safe in jail either.

I was told that I should get myself into the infirmary, because several police were planning to take me into a room without a camera and beat me and abuse me. I did as I was instructed to do by the trustee and made myself throw up so I could go to the infirmary. I wasn't safe there either, but at least I had delayed whatever they had in-store for me.

Shaking with fear, I didn't sleep at all that first night.

When I was put back into the holding area with the bunks, I was assaulted by other prisoners while the guards looked away, pretending nothing was happening. That sort of thing continued the whole time I was in there. I was repeatedly attacked and terrorized and harrassed.

Somehow, the harassment was the worst, because it came at a personal cost. It was like everyone I met was just a skin for some demonic thing that was my master tormenter. Whatever it was, it knew my kitten was home by herself, helpless, in a hot apartment with no food or water. It would meow at me or use my voice, echoing my calls for my cat.

I lay shivering in dread at her survival in my apartment, all alone, trapped. She was waiting for me, I knew she would be, and wondering why Momma hadn't come home to feed her and play with her and cuddle with her. As the days went by, I began crying myself to sleep.

Lights out and a chorus of meowing from the other prisoners. Like a bad dream.

When my arraignment finally arrived, five days after I was arrested, I was accused of:

"Assault on a police officer leading to death, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and murder in the second degree."

I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life in prison. Then they promptly dropped all charges and let me go. I was standing seventeen miles from home with no fare, no phone and it was a hundred degrees outside.

I started walking, but it took me all day to get to my apartment. It was dark out when I got home. All the way home I had time to contemplate that they must have realized I was the wrong person, which meant that they caught whoever I looked like.

In a way, as I limped, with sores on my feet and bruises on every part of my body, I hoped whoever she was got treated worse than me. It didn't make me feel better to wish that on her, but I did anyway, because I considered it to be her fault - everything.

I glanced down the road, seeing the top of the sign where I work. Where I used to work. Jail doesn't make the no-call-no-show thing go away. I pay my rent month-to-month and barely have enough for groceries.

Maybe I couldn't afford a cat, you might say? No, sorry, I have a lot of really bad emotions going on, I don't mean to be rude to you. You're right, I can't afford a cat, but I need her, she is my friend and she makes all this life I am struggling through worthwhile.

When I opened the door, it felt like I was still climbing the stairs, like there was just an empty void where my apartment should be. Everything felt like it was sinking. I don't know how to explain, it was just this awful, gut-wrenching hollow feeling.

I was walking slowly, carefully turning on lights and looking around. I saw myself in the mirror, my face bruised, a black eye, a scab on my lip, a raw patch where some of my hair was torn out. I wanted to cry at my appearance, but somehow, the tears wouldn't start.

I had to find Lucy Fur.

Her bowls were cleaned to a polish, she'd licked them over and over, no food, no water. It was still very hot in the apartment, although I'd left the back window open. I hoped she had escaped, clawing her way through the screen and jumping down into the bushes.

The screen had no claw marks. I realized she wouldn't be able to claw through the mesh. It wouldn't have sustained any damage even if she had tried.

The search was perilous because at any moment it would end.

That is when I found her. That is when I cried.

I cannot describe the hell I descended into, but when I got back up, I was different. I was determined to resume my old life, at any cost, starting with my cat. They'd taken everything from me, and soon I'd be out on the streets again, homeless.

I knew how to get it back. At first, I was not afraid. I soon learned to be.

The old way I knew about was to talk to the demon who had stolen from me. It would be waiting, willing to make a bargain, and give me back what is mine. I called it to me, and when it repeatedly asked me what I wanted, I tested its eternal patience.

I performed the ritual, as I had seen it done when I was a little girl. I was not supposed to see, it was supposed to be done in secret. I'd seen the demon that slaughtered everyone. I don't know if they were my real family. I doubt they were, they probably kidnapped me when I was even younger and raised me among them.

I don't think my real family would have done the things to me that they did.

**"Are you stupid or something? Just ask me for what you want."** The whispering thing spoke audibly.

I shivered in preternatural dread, knowing this was my demon. I should not speak to it, but I wanted my cat back. I held up nine fingers and then put one down.

**"You want your cat back."** The demon hissed. I said nothing, gave no indication I was agreeing.

Fear prickled at the base of my spine and beaded as sweat. If I made even the simplest of mistakes, I would suffer far worse than what I had already endured. I might even die horribly, and I had no doubt my demon would love to see me die in a uniquely awful way. It might even kill me, itself, personally. I'd already seen what that looks like, and I can think of nothing worse.

The way demons kill is indescribably grotesque, and there's no end to all the ways to describe the torture, and when it ends it isn't just the body that splatters. I don't wish to meditate on what I've seen, and it wouldn't be right for me to cause a disturbance with such details. Such facts are potentially harmful.

I will let my fear speak for itself. I wasn't afraid to bargain with the demon, only that if I failed to follow protocol, if I gave it even an instant to react, I would suffer the same fate that I had already seen. While I was deathly afraid of the worst way to die, at the hands of my demon, I wanted my cat back, and the rest of my life as well.

**"You were so gorgeous, and now, when the swelling subsides, you'll always see how the flesh is clay."** The demon tried to distract me, to get me to interrupt it. It had played this game a thousand times, for thousands of years, and darker and wiser summoners had fallen for its tricks.

I said nothing. I kept my eyes shut. I tried to stay focused, but every time it said something, my concentration was being sapped. I almost uttered responses, but my swollen face made it easy not to talk, not before it gave me the key I was waiting for.

**"What about the injustice you have suffered? Set me loose upon them this night, and I shall show you a miracle. Set me upon them - I shall teach them my name."** The demon's voice had shifted, and was more drawn out, a deeper, more ominous whisper. It was offering to slaughter all the police I'd met. I wondered if it really could, and then still I waited.

I trembled, the limits of my tolerance for its presence was gone. I could smell the creature; it was beginning to manifest. I worried the demon might touch me or worse. Fear made it hard for me to sit still, like I wanted to get up and run away, or open my eyes and see it (I definitely did not want to see it) or speak to it, opening my mouth for it.

I must explain something I know, at least about my demon. When someone begins to speak to it, they have opened their mouth, and it is like some kind of portal for the demon. It will pour out of their mouth and take form, and the form it will take will mirror the evil in Man's will. It needs a word, a word or human volition, and it needs it to be evil, that is the source of its nourishment. I say nourishment, but for a demon, saying 'yes' when it is offering infernal vengeance is more like a drug that makes it go totally berserk.

It must first be restrained, properly. No chalk circle or crucifix or bottle can actually contain a demon, not before it is already restrained. There is only one thing that can actually bind a demon to fulfill its contract and not harm its summoner. Few ever acquire this one thing first, because the demon is smarter than we are, and has done this countless times. You cannot trick the demon, you cannot cheat the demon and you cannot invoke the name of whatever you happen to believe in to protect you from the demon.

You can do the 'invoke the name', but there is only one name that any demon must abide. That is the demon's own name, if it has one. Some demons supposedly have never given their name, and it cannot be discovered otherwise.

I knew all of this, and I also knew I was no match for the demon. If I failed, I was going to die or worse. I was absolutely terrified, but I continued, for once the interview begins, it must continue until it is over. The demon isn't going anywhere.

**"I shall make your old life restored. Your work, your apartment, your body and face, the sores on your feet. Those restorations I will grant you. I shall do that for you, as a token of my power."** The demon said, its voice like the echo of an echo, and forming those words.

Somehow, even knowing I would be killed, I almost nodded to that, but noticed it hadn't mentioned my cat. I also noted it hadn't given me anything yet, just false offerings.

**"What do you wish for? Say it and I shall make it yours."** The demon then touched me. I don't know where it touched me, I just felt it, somehow.

It at once filled me with panic. I worried it was crawling all around me, that if I looked at it, no I fought down the panic. I wasn't going to look at it. I slowed my breathing, trying to hold still, trying to control my panic. I wanted to scream so badly, I wanted to scream, but my head was underwater, and by that I mean that drowning would be the demon's immediate reprisal.

**"You wish for me, you lust for the great Melfaest, you've wanted to ride the maroon carpet since you first saw this perfect creation in glory."** Melfaest uttered its key - its name for itself, and this is not voluntary, the demon cannot resist saying certain things. I had only to wait and be careful. I was lucky, I remember summoning rituals taking many hours when I was young.

"Melfaest." I tied the demon to its contract, by making its name my voice. I was still scared, but at least I knew it would be over soon. Somehow the anxiety of not knowing when it would end had made the waiting almost unbearable.

**"What will you take, and let me be undone?"** The demon asked in its diabolical voice.

I held up my hand again, showing nine fingers up, and lowered one. I wasn't going to fall for the oldest trick in the book. There was nothing stopping the demon from tricking me with its name, I didn't know exactly how, but I was taking no chances.

**"You want your cat? All this for little Lucy Fur?"** The demon sounded annoyed. **"I could stain the jails with the corpses of your oppressors by the stroke of midnight, a horror like the world has never seen, and you bind me for your cat?"**

I nodded, I just wanted my cat.

**"It is not enough. Melfaest will sweeten the deal. You will take a new job, you will keep this apartment. You will be shaped the way your creator originally made you, instead of the gargoyle they beat you into. Then you will unsay Melfaest, and that is your bargain."** The demon negotiated.

For a moment, I was too scared to agree, but then I felt it touching me again and I nodded.

Then the demon was, well, everywhere, but it was also nowhere. It had work to do, to honor the contract. If it did what it said, it would be unbound, that's how I understand it. I shuddered after the ordeal.

I touched my face, and I realized that the demon had already touched me, and I couldn't find any bruises. My body too, and my feet I'd walked home on. It had touched me before we had a contract. I had goosebumps, at the thought of it moving over me, erasing the evil done to me.

My phone rang and it was an offer from my old boss, for a new job. She'd quit working there quite abruptly, due to a dispute with the owner. She'd already had a second job and she was the hiring manager there. She wanted me to come work with her, and the pay was fantastic.

I hung up. None of it meant anything to me. Just work so I could pay the rent. Just my looks, which would fade anyway. I only cared about one thing, and it seemed the demon had cheated me after-all. I should have spoken, I should have insisted that I specifically wanted my cat, above all.

I was crying again, and that is when I heard her little bell. She meowed and I opened my eyes and Lucy Fur was there, running across the floor in a mad dash into my arms. She's still got eight lives to go, thank God.
