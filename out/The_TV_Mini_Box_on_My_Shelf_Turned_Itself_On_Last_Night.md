I don’t know how long it’s been there. Maybe years. I never questioned the small, palm-sized box sitting on the shelf in the living room. It wasn’t anything special—just a sleek, black rectangle with a tiny screen. When I moved into this house, it was already here, tucked in the back of an old bookshelf that had been left behind by the previous tenants. The more I looked at it, the less I cared. It was harmless, after all. Just a weird relic of the past.

I’ve always been the kind of person who doesn’t let strange things bother me. Sure, the box looked like an old-fashioned TV, but it wasn’t plugged in, and it didn’t have any visible buttons. It sat there, dormant, almost like a forgotten ornament in the corner of the room. I figured it was broken—or maybe just a novelty piece.

But one night, everything changed.

It was around 3 a.m., the house was silent except for the faint hum of the fridge in the kitchen. I was in bed, scrolling through my phone, trying to wind down for sleep. That’s when I heard it. A faint static noise, like a TV turning on. It was barely audible at first, but the sound grew louder with each passing second.

I froze, unsure of what to make of it. Slowly, I turned toward the living room. The little box on the shelf was glowing—its screen flickering to life. I had no idea how it turned on, since I was certain it wasn’t plugged in. I hesitated, then got up to check on it.

As I approached, the static cleared, revealing a face on the screen. It was blurry at first, like the image was still adjusting. But then, it sharpened, and I saw it clearly. The face was… familiar. It was me. But not quite. The eyes on the screen were wide, unnaturally so. The mouth moved as if it was trying to speak, but no sound came through.

Suddenly, the distorted face grinned—a cold, unsettling smile that stretched too wide. It felt wrong. The screen flickered again, and before I knew it, words appeared in glowing letters:

"Come closer."

I stepped back, heart pounding in my chest. The voice, faint and almost too soft to hear, came again:
“You let us in.”

I didn’t know what that meant. Was it a joke? Was someone messing with me? But the room felt colder, the shadows deeper. The house began to shake, almost imperceptibly at first, but then stronger. The flickering of the box became erratic, the static now accompanied by eerie whispers.

Then, without warning, the screen went black. The room returned to normal, as if nothing had happened. The coldness in the air faded, and the shaking stopped. I stood there, frozen, my heart still racing. The little box was off again, but I could still feel its presence, like it was watching me.

I thought it was over, but the next morning, when I woke up, I saw the message on the screen again. It was still glowing faintly in the dark:

“New occupant added.”

I don’t know what it means. All I know is that something is watching me now, something that wasn’t there before. And I can’t shake the feeling that whatever it is, it’s waiting for me to come closer again.
