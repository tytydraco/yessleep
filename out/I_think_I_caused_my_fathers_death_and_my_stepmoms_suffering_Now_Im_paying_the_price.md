I think I caused my dad’s death and my stepmom’s suffering. Now I’m paying for it.

I first got into spells when I was 14. I had no idea what I was doing. (A little background, my father married a woman who absolutely hated me and did many horrible things to. My father chose to ignore it and believe her over me when I would bring it up) the first thing I ever did was entirely out of anger. I looked up spells of revealing and revenge on Pinterest of all places. I took everything I found online and mashed it up into some sort of spell soup. I lit a bunch of black candles in the shape of a circle(I associated black candles with black magic from tv shows 🤦‍♀️), then in the center I placed a mirror with a taped picture on it of my stepmom and father separated by a tear down the middle, I had a black candle infront of me, I used a white sheet to cover the mirror while I wrote on a peice of paper along something along the lines of “the world will see who she is and she will pay for everything she has done. he will come to regret the things he let happen” folded it up, then I uncovered the the mirror and stuck the folded up message in the flame of the candle infront of me. 

All was fine and nothing happened for a month, then I turned 15 and my dad got sick. It didn’t take long for him to go either, he passed exactly 1 month after getting sick. The last thing he said to me was “I’m sorry… I hope you know love I love you”. As for my stepmom, she didn’t hesitate to sell off all of his stuff, refused to give his ashes to my family, openly admitted the way she felt about me on Facebook… everyone finally believed me. Then it got worse, it started out small and then became huge. She didn’t get her passport in time to go on a $4,000 non refundable trip, the pipes in her house broke, her car caught on fire, and had her identity stolen. At first it was funny and it made me feel a sense of joy. But then she was mugged, got diagnosed with cancer, lost her adult son to a car accident, her house was pretty much destroyed in a tornado. It’s to much to be a coincidence. 

As for me, weird things started to happen after my father passed and my step mom’s “incidents”. The only way I know how to describe it is to say it’s like I can “sense death”. Before it happens and after. About 2 months after the unfolding of the previously mentioned events, I noticed that everythime I walked past the certain part of wooded are by the path I walk my dog on, I’d to get this uncomfortable feeling in my gut, not like painful or anything, just uncomfortable, and the hairs on my arms would stand up. It lasted a week, and then it all of a sudden stopped. Come to find out while watching the news after I got home, there was a b0dy found within that patch of wooded area earlier in the day.

The fee became more frequent. When I walk past a stranger(not everyone), or if I go to the doctor, or if I drive past this one corn field. 
And then, 4 months ago, I got the feeling while driving. Then as I came to stop behind other car at an intersection I watched a car speed past me into, running a red light into the intersection and t-boning another car. It was bad, I chose to leave as there were other people infront of me who had witnessed the accident clearer than I had and would be of more help to the police. The feeling didn’t go away until I was about a mile away from the accident. 

I got curious later that day and searched the internet to see if the were any news stations that may have cover it due to the severity. All 5 of the local news stations covered it. They all covered it because the accident claimed the lives of 5 people, The person in the car that ran the light, who had a seizure while driving and I’m assuming it caused him to step the gas petal to the ground idk, and a family of four that was in the other car. 
This isn’t it though, those are just the most severe cases of what’s happened since I started to get that feeling. The most recent development however is now I’ve started to hear a voice call out my name in a hushed tone, I have no idea if it is related to everything else or not. It’s not like the movies me or anything, it mainly consists of sounding like someone trying to descretly get my attention from far away. It happens when I’m alone, at the store, at school, etc. 

What is happening? What did I do when I was 14? I’ve tried searching the internet but I’m not finding anything useful. Could what I did at 14 be causing this stuff now? How do I stop it? I wanted my stepmom to pay but not this extent. I’ve already lost my dad. I’m almost 17, and all of this has happened, will it stop?
