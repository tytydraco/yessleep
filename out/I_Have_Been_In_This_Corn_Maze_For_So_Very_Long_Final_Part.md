[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i1hrm7/i_have_been_in_this_corn_maze_so_long_part_2/)

It took me quite a while to decide what to do.

I was out of the corn maze, but clearly not back in the real world. The first thing after the wall of corn, what I was sitting on, was a dirt road. Then came a green lawn, sprawling and idyllic. Lastly, at the end of a little dirt path, was the farmhouse. 

The night was still oppressively dark. I could hardly see the building through the gloom, and couldn’t make out any other features that might be around it. It didn’t matter though. I knew where I was supposed to go. 

I walked up to the house. From afar, it looked like a pretty typical farmhouse. As I got closer though, it began to appear more like the haunted house that you would expect in that place. White walls that looked clean from far away revealed cobwebs crisscrossing them. What I had thought were unbroken windows were actually empty frames. 

I entered the house. I would say carefully, but I had been in that place far too long to feel any need for caution. I just wanted it to end. 

The front door opened into a shadowy living room to my left, and stairs leading up to my right. Straight ahead was a cramped hall that looked to head to a kitchen. 

I had no idea where to go, so I just decided to take a circuit around the house and see what would happen. The house was dark, eerie, and mostly empty. Crumbling furniture and fallen junk only infrequently blocked my path. Morbid creaking sounds and faint whistling left me looking over my shoulder every few seconds. 

I reached the dilapidated kitchen and looked around. The collapsing cupboards held only crumbled and faded remains of tin cans. A half-broken table sat in the middle of the room, and a badly battered icebox against the right wall. Having seen nothing of any threat to me, I, for some reason, felt safe to open the fridge. 

“Agh! Ah! Ah!” A fleshy mass fell out of the icebox. It was a skinned body, still alive, or at least writhing and screaming. 

The shock was enough to make me stumble backward. I tripped over one of the fallen legs from the table and fell on the collapsed counters. Rotten wood splintered beneath me as what structure remained of the cupboards gave way with scant resistance. 

A swarm of cockroaches poured out of the pile of rotting wood onto my body. I have always had an intense phobia of insects, so I immediately freaked out. 

“Shit! Shit!” I spent the next minute swatting bloated insects off of myself as I manically ran out of the room. I fumbled to the stairs as I beat insects—real and imagined—off of myself. By the time I had calmed down enough to function, I had reached a landing halfway up the stairs. Due to how dark it was, I could not see anything below or above, just thick shadow at either end. 

After taking a moment to catch my breath, I continued up the short stairs.

I found myself on another landing with another turn in the stairs.

Obviously, this was impossible. This squat building couldn’t accommodate stairs that wrap around twice. 

I was trapped again. But not even in a corn maze. No, I was stuck on a single bloody stair landing.

I tried going back down a few times. Each time I found myself on the same shadowy landing.

My body slumped to the ground. Unlike in the maze, there was nothing to walk to, no point trodding onward. I was just too tired to see if it would let me go just by playing its game any longer. 

More strange sounds and flickering shadows tried their best to rattle me, but it couldn’t break the numb shell that hopeless place had formed around me. I don’t know how long I lay there, only that eventually I heard a very different sound and smelled something new. 

The farmhouse was burning. Even then I wasn’t roused to action. None of the performers or traps had hurt me yet. They no longer had the same effect. 

Well, except for the bugs.

The fire cut through the shadows revealing the bottom floor to me again. Unfortunately, but predictably, by the time I could see the world beyond the stairs again, my escape was cut off by fire. 

I forced my tired body to run up the stairwell again. Smoke was beginning to choke out my vision. I think I ran up four or more flights of stairs. Just as I was about to give up again, I burst through a rotting door. 

On the other side, I found myself in a bedroom. It was just as dim and decrepit as the rest of the house. Only one thing stood out. 

A door at the back of the room with a glowing red exit sign hanging above it.

With an exhausted sigh, I began to trudge towards it. 

As I did though, an anger built within me. It was the first feeling other than pain and exhaustion I had felt in weeks. Even if this exit was real, why should I be forced to endure this much pain without reason nor explanation?

“Why are you doing this?” I hoarsely screamed into the air. “What is this place?! “

I received no answer.

Something inside of me snapped. I grabbed a withered old wooden chair in front of a faded end table and threw it across the room. 

The feeling was cathartic. I overcame my exhaustion and continued to destroy the room. The fire never reached me. It had never been real anyway after all. 

Finally, after several minutes of carnage, I fell down in a pile of rubble. 

“You finished?” A raspy old voice spoke from seemingly nowhere.

I tried to move and look for the source, but my body wouldn’t respond. 

“Well, I fig’rd I’d tell yah ‘bout my little maze since yah done won it.” The voice had a strong country accent, it seemed to come from all directions at once. “I ran the spookiest, scariest haunted maze you ever did see fer nearly fifty-five years. Started as a way to spook a girl I liked, and ended up scaring’ and delightin’ the town’s kids, and their kids, and then those kid’s kids. When I done passed away it ended up sitting there for a good many years spookin’ ‘em just the same when they showed up to see the old haunted field.”

There was a pause. 

“The place burned down one day. Buncha teens had a party in the old barn. Found by then I didn’t need the old place though. I could jus’ make the scares misself. Even used the stuff people dropped to catch up with the times!” He chuckled. “Y’know, it’s just kinda a joke there.” 

“Anyway, you guys got scared good! Glad to see one of ya’ll make it through! Happy Halloween!” 

I slowly found my body able to move again. By the time I pushed myself back to my feet, I was in an empty hall. The only thing that remained was the exit door.

I stumbled out to find myself standing in the tamped-down field right by my parked car. 

I drove home in a daze. I only thought to check the date and time after arriving. 

I had only been in that field for thirty minutes. 

Over the next few weeks, while readjusting to the world and relearning to talk to people and do basic chores again instead of just mindlessly trudging in an endless field to survive I spent my spare time tracking down the others. It wasn’t hard with a first name and a college to track down Brad and Darius. 

They were alive and well. I managed to contact them. They had woken up the same way I did, but back in their own state. They still remember everything. 

It’s still difficult. I wake up from nightmares more often than not. Being alone, afraid, hunted, hungry, and thirsty all for that long, that seemingly endless march, it sticks with you. 

I’ll be okay though. Still, if you find yourself driving just a little too long to find the world’s largest corn maze, turn around.

It’ll be bigger than you think.
