"Okay, fine buddy, I hear you," I said, looking down at my stomach. It was a long day at work and I had only eaten oats for breakfast. I was running on coffee the whole day and now I was hungry.

"I said I hear you, just a few minutes," I said, looking for a food shop or restaurant.

Far into the distance I saw a signboard with bold glowing letters. "BURGER FEELS." I read out the name. "Look, we found something!"

I parked my car and made my way to the main entrance. A giant glowing burger above the door flickered to welcome me.

"Jeez," I said before opening the door and found a table. Which wasn’t hard because the restaurant was mostly empty. A family with two kids sat not too far from me and were already picking up their things to leave.

"What would you like today, sir?" a waiter said, handing me the menu. There were all sorts of burgers—different flavours, vegan, different meat options. I rolled the pages to find one at the very end: Burger Feels Special – Burger so good you will feel like one.

"Haha, what!" I chuckled. It was a weird claim—who feels like a burger?

"I'll have this one," I said, handing back the menu.

"Are you sure?" the waiter asked with a concerned look.

"Yes, I'm having the special today." He nodded and went back to the counter. The person at the counter shot me a look.

"Weird people," I said, waiting for my special burger.

The waiter brought the burger. It looked awfully simple for a special burger—cheese, tomatoes, lettuce and a patty.

"We hope the wait was worth it, sir," the waiter said before putting the plate down and left.

"Oh, God," a moan left my mouth as I took the first bite. It was really that good.

"They weren't lying," I said before taking another bite.

"Well I do feel like a burger," I said jokingly with a laugh. But that laughter faded the very next moment.

My chest throbbed with pain, I couldn't breathe. I tried to get up but collapsed on the floor with my knees bent.

My legs started expanding. The chest pain was getting unbearable. I, in a hurry, opened up my shirt and bam—huge green leaves of lettuce sprung out of my chest.

"No... what is happening, help!" I screamed. But the waiter looked at me once and looked away.

I opened my shirt further. Dark grill lines started appearing on my stomach, the colour turning a dark brown. My legs were now merged into one and were expanding into a big round blob. I tried moving my arms but they were red and melting. I couldn't even look down. My neck was expanding into a giant tomato slice.

I tried to look away but my head felt too heavy. Something soft and white was making its way out of it—like bread.

"No!" I opened my mouth to scream but a lot of cheese came out of it. I could no longer move. There was no going back. I accepted my fate.

In the end, I felt like a burger.
