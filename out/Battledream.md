I wish I had known. This is not how my story ended. It's how it began.


It all started three years ago, like something straight out of a horror book. I was looking forward to my new home, to finally be independent. My girlfiends helped me move into a beautiful Queen Ann Victorian house. And at first, it was great. I had beautiful views from every window, a gorgeous wood burning fireplace and a kitchen from a dream.

The first few weeks were a dream, full of house parties and my friends helping me decorate. It was lovely by the time my house was fully furnished. It felt like home.

One night, after my friends went home, I was curled up on the couch sipping some red wine when I noticed that the crucifix that my friend had given me had inverted. I corrected it, turning it right side up. I shrugged it off, and went to bed.

That night, I had a nightmare. There were five warriors dressed in fur clothes, chanting in a strange tongue. A priestess dressed in a bloody robe with a raven on her shoulder was standing before an altar. A young girl dressed in a simple white gown was lying on the altar. The priestess picked up a steel dagger and plunged it into the girl's heart. 

I woke up in a cold sweat.

Every night following I would have that dream. My friends noticed that I was not myself. Realizing I needed help I confided in them. They looked taken a back by what I had told them. Then, instead of abandoning me, my girls threw themselves into research. And I looked up the history on my property. And what I found horrified me.

200 years ago, a cult had had used the land as there personal property. They sacrificed young girls, virgins, to their god Baal. In return, they were given power. What type of power I never found out. Well, the cult was exterminated by an Indian tribe. They sent their warriors and a shaman to destroy the cult in it's entirety.

But there was a problem. Because of how powerful the priestess was, the shaman could only kill her body. Her soul remained bound to the land, a permanent curse. The shaman was able to contain her power to a small part of the land. The land that my house was on.

After all we had researched, I went to the tribe that had vanquished the cult to begin with. I spoke to the descendant of the shaman, John Riverwolf. He told me that the priestess was too powerfull to completely vanquish, but there were ways that I could subdue her influence.

He gave me sage to bless my house, and put up strong defenses around my home. He told me that unless I moved, I would be her jailer. And she would be my prisoner. I thought about moving. But only for a moment. I told him I don't run from a fight. 

That night, the dream began again, but this time I was ready. I stopped her by grabbing the dagger and plunging it into the priestess heart. Then I freed the girl. I spoke to John on the phone and he said that what I had done was fighting back. He told me it was a good thing. But that it would necessarily drive her to the afterlife.

She fought back during the day time. Pots and pans would be thrown at me, I wake up with scratches all over me. But I take satisfaction in denying her her sacrifice every night. It is a never ending battle. A battle that has no victor at the moment.

It's been three years since this started, and I believe she is growing weaker. But I know she is far from defeated. I am worn out, too.I will be her jailer and she my prisoner until the battle is decided, one way or the other.

And I intend to win.
