Department Barrows

Charles works the night shift at Department Barrows.  It’s an unassuming department store located off of Welton Street on the Northwest corner of town.  He has worked there for three weeks.  They stock wholesale items for cheap, in a much smaller store than a typical Costco.  Mind you, the scaffolding all looks similar, ranging straight and narrow red metal shelving forming sequestered isles filled with a variety of consumer products.  

Charles has had three different coworkers be replaced during these three weeks of employment.  The most recent change was to a twenty year old man named Graham, from a thirty-five year old man named Julio.  

There are three problems with night shift, and one will always exacerbate another.  The first, is the length of the aisles.  They stream for lengths longer and longer the more you look down them. As if space fractures between red metal shelving and white, clean tile.  In the daytime, they’re your typical department store isles, but at night they form a straight labyrinth leading into an unimaginative oblivion.   Second, is the lighting.  The lighting will stop working in sections of the aisle.  Instead of a muddled shadowy part of the isle, it’s as if light ceases to exist in these sections.  Like a box of see-through mud devours any rays from the humming ceiling lights on either side.  You can always see the continuation of the aisle afterwards, and the bitter beginning of the aisle before, but in between it is a nether.  The third and final problem is that Charles and his coworkers' sole job is to restock the shelves.  

Charles saw Julio be attacked and swallowed by four demonic entities on Monday night. He was restocking protein bar boxes when they swarmed him. Their forms weren’t creative, they didn’t hold any mystique or majesty like demons in works of fiction.  They were unassuming, made of shadow, with long ligaments that draped and threshed at Julio as he was stripped away into the darkness of an unlit part of aisle four.  Julio screamed and scratched at them, but his hands impotently waved through ethereal evil and he was dragged into a section of the dark.  

“Shit.”  Charles muttered, and he went to stock aisle seven which thankfully, was fully lit that evening.  

The next few shifts during the week were uneventful for Charles, save for meeting young Graham.  He greeted the new hire with a gentle lift of his coffee mug in the staff room, then left to stock his shelves.  The white board in the staff room said he was to stock aisle seven today.  That, and there have been a proud 3 days without incidence.  

On the next day, the current Friday evening, Charles finds he is now tasked with restocking the hardware section, aisle nine.  He began his shift by patrolling to the stock room, filling up his cart with a new yield and walking to the associated work area. 

There is a section of aisle nine with a light out.  The truth is, Charles doesn’t care.  Charles has spent too long around those boring demons, and it’s now a reflex of his attitude.  He’s seen them, heard them, felt them. He’s dealt with them long before the Barrows department store.  Upon his first few encounters, he laid with the trauma of the moment, boorishly holding his knees to his chest wondering if what he saw was real.  Now, he hates them.  Charles isn’t scared. He’s indignant and angry.  

Upon reaching closer and closer to the dark section, Charles is tasked with refilling a section of nails when he feels darkness watching him.  Eight, no ten sets of eyes boring into him from all angles.  Charles finishes that section and sighs.  He puts two hands on his cart and propels it towards the dark.  As the tip of his cart hits the darkness, Charles’ body is flung over the handlebars into the cart itself and the wheels propel into nothingness.  The strange thing he initially notices as he stares into nothingness,, as light is lost to blackness, is that those evil figures don’t exist.  It’s just one dark, formless energy.  A shadow-like mist envelops the cart, and almost like it’s propelled by wind the shadow begins tearing past him, like he’s riding a bike through the smoke of a burning building.  All that he can hear is a chorus of ghastly whispers that speak no words, but combine into a deafening, sinister hiss as heavy and obscuring clouds cascade over him.  That’s when he starts to feel his eyes bulge out of his head, just to resocket.  His ears pull the flesh on his face until it’s akin to a rubber mask, only to be snapped back in place.  His legs and arms are left unfeelingly numb. 

Charles isn’t scared, he’s fed up with this circumstance already.  He just wants to finish aisle nine and go home.  As the wind, shadows and clouds pass over him they begin to press into his body, his back still situated on the products of the cart. He can’t feel anything underneath him but he can feel the sensation of suffocation nonetheless. He sees shimmers of eyes that open and watch above the pressure.  They appear as glum yellow orbs then disappear as quickly as they came.  The squeeze is now turning from uncomfortable to drastic, and the speed of the cart becomes faster and faster simultaneously moving nowhere. His face, which still has feeling, is now a discombobulated mess like each of his features is separated into different planes of time only to snap back to the present.  The matter of his eyelids corrode, then reshape as they widen.  They begin to water, and then the trickling liquid is sucked back into his tear ducts.  There is no rhythm to his mutilation, it’s simply chaos.  His cheeks are like plaster being pushed through small spaces, to only spread and fill large spaces afterwards.  Charles starts to scream. Only a millisecond of sound comes out, and then the clouds twist into his open mouth.  He can’t breathe, but he keeps screaming regardless in hopes to maybe break through and hear something.  He doesn’t.  

Somehow, to Charles, It’s not a scream of fear.  He feels strangely confident that he’ll be leaving this plight soon. It’s a bellow of his frustration, reminiscent of a parent holding back the arms of an angry toddler.  In this state, the demonic whispers surrounding Charles turn into a cacophony of subdued sound. It reminds him of swimming underwater. 

The pressure lets up for just a moment, and he lifts his head to see the light on the other side of the darkened aisle. 

“FUCK…. YOU!” 

He now is declaring a war, his cry is twin chimes clanging against one another in a hurricane.  The demons are playing with him, as they let him say the first half of his roar, but as he yelled “YOU,” the shadows reapplied their weight and propelled themselves into his lungs.  In his stubbornness he holds the syllable in a torrent of anger but the more he screams, the more he drowns in his inability to hear it.   The cart begins to move faster and faster, the clouds become heavier and heavier, all the while subduing every sense that made Charles a sentient being. Only to let him up for air, to then be crushed, pulled, stretched, and clawed at again. In a dark eternity, to feel fear and anger, pain, hope, then discouragement. 

Charles was the fourth employee to be replaced at Department Barrows.  The manager in the morning shift erased the whiteboard in the staffroom.

“0 days without incident.”
