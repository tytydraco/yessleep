The first thing Cullen was told, before even walking into Ron's office, was that he could only use nicknames. They even had him sign a short waiver that, more or less, said it was his responsibility if his real name got out and nobody in Society could be held liable for the consequences that would potentially occur Outside. He found the little pictograph of someone being dragged off into a dark alley after writing a full name, middle initials included, to be quite... Illustrative.

He almost slipped up despite it when he introduced himself, when he went to meet with the communications officer of this section of the wall. Far as he knew, communication was important enough out here they, more or less, were the gods of diplomacy between the in and out. Ron sipped fruit juice from his coffee mug, loudly and somehow pointedly, as a way of cutting Cullen off mid-sentence. He came up with Cullen on the spot. He'd heard it meant 'wolfhound', or something similar, so it felt appropriate enough.

The office was cramped, but not because it was small. In fact, it was fairly large. It had to be, to accommodate the many, many lights, buzzers, switches, buttons, and monitors that loomed over him and whoever was on the other side of his desk at all times. It was like the cold, unfeeling eye of the government was in the room with you, waiting for mistakes. But it wasn’t you they were watching, it was all the things that weren’t inside their walls.

“So... I see you guys like pictures."

“Not everyone can read. Don't want anyone dying because they can't read.” Ron was at least twice his age. His skin was dark and weathered, and his eyes were invariably examining, like he didn’t need to know you to know you: he just needed a quick glance, and everything in your head was bared for his interpretation. He was of an older generation, and Cullen was told he’d had firsthand experience from the start of the Change.

“Is it really that dangerous?"

“Names have power, kid. People can find you, and things that aren't quite people, pretty quickly if they have your full name. It's why authors are legally required to have pennames now." He sounded like he ate nails, his voice was so scarred, or smoked the whole pack when he got cigarettes.

“I'll keep that in mind if I ever write a book."

“And when you do paperwork. I must stress I am absolutely not kidding."

Cullen just stared at him. And Ron just moved on.

“So. You want to be a border boy. Why? Honest answers only. Nobody likes liars around here.”

“Is this really-”

“Yes.”

Cullen sighed. “Okay. My… Friends. Friendly friends. Fits. I want to make sure everyone gets through alright.”

“And?” Ron waited. Waited just long enough, sipping fruit juice out of his coffee mug like it was his god given mission to defy its intended use, that Cullen grudged out an answer.

“My dad.”

“Files say you were raised by a stranger.”

“Don’t call him that.” Cullen had to keep himself from clenching his fists.

“Okay. Continue.”

Cullen paused. He debated getting up and leaving, but he looked out the window. Ron had a full bird’s eye view of the Outside, and Society. To Cullen’s left, endless dark trees, with hints of other things on the horizon. Mountains that didn’t quite make sense with where they were placed on the board. Patchworks of landscape that obviously didn’t belong where they were, but blatantly defied logic. Somewhere, over all that, an unknown nobody had ever seen. No matter where you were in the Outside, three directions led to Society. One led to a place nobody ever went, and the people who tried to make the number less negligible never came back, or they wouldn’t tell you what they saw. Couldn’t.

At least, never in a way that made the picture full: you were only allowed glimpses.

If Cullen looked right, there it was. A familiar landscape, with a familiar series of roads, leading to a familiar city where everyone was normal, no matter where they came from. Nothing out of order, nothing out of place.

He cleared his throat, turned back to Ron’s patient gaze. “I’ve heard a lot of people tell me my dad wasn’t real because of where he came from. That some of my friends, my neighbors, coworkers… Weren’t real. That they were just pretending.”

“And how does that make you feel?”

“...This isn’t therapy.” His correction got no reaction, so he just kept on. “I don’t like it. I don’t like that, if some of them just disappeared, nobody would bat an eye or ask where they went.”

“And your father…”

“I know what you’re going to say. Yes. Part of me hopes maybe I’ll just see him walk up to the checkpoint one day. But… It’s both.”

“Does any part of you want to know what’s at the far end of the road? Before you say you don’t know what I mean, no, you do. And it’s important.”

Cullen didn’t answer right away. But he did, and he did it honestly. “I do. But I don’t want to know where I’ll go, if I don’t come back.”

Ron studied him. Cullen felt like he was thinking about something more than just professional interview etiquette and job safety. Cullen watched him turn his thoughtful blue eyes towards the Outside. He leaned back in his big black arm chair, all dark leather and comfort. Cullen wondered if he got the good chair because he was important here, or if he’d just brought it up here and nobody cared enough to question it.

“I gotta ask some really specific questions. They might be off-putting, but again, honest answers.”

“Okay.”

“Are you comfortable with repeating phrases, with little variation? Are you comfortable with being called in to replace other staff in an emergency? Are you comfortable with strange gifts? Are you comfortable with interacting through barriers? Are you comfortable with staring something in the eye at the risk of varying side effects?”

Cullen answered yes to every question, with increasing discomfort. He fidgeted a bit in his chair. His was old wood, beaten and weathered, with strange phrases carved into it.

“Quick answers, kid. You sure?”

“I know they have to do weird things at the border already. Half of it’s the same stuff we do back home every day, isn’t it? Just-”

“With more consequences.” Ron looked towards him again, turned to face him. He put down his mug, and he clasped his hands together. He smiled. Stared Cullen right in the eye. “Tell me, what makes you think I’m human?”

“I’m sorry?”

“I’m looking you in the eye. You can see all my little appendages.” He wriggled his hands. Opened his mouth, briefly, stuck out his tongue in an almost child-like gesture. It was almost insulting. “But if you looked past the desk and saw I didn’t have feet, how would you feel?”

“Uh… Like you need to go to the hospital.”

Ron paused. His eyes flashed with a bit of good humor, but it dropped just as quick. “Okay, take away one of my eyes. Hell, both of them. Pull out my teeth, my tongue, or maybe I don’t have a mouth. Maybe I’ve got no hands.”

“Where is this going?”

“Would you feel uncomfortable? Maybe afraid?”

“Depends on-”

“Now what if I had all these things, but I was lying to you? Maybe there’s eyes on the back of my head, and I’m actually blind right now.” Ron stood up, did a little twist. He had gray hair, and if there was some secret third eye, Cullen wasn’t seeing it.

“Oh.”

“Oh is right, kid.” Ron sat down. There was a bit of weight to it, like he was suddenly tired. “Now here’s another, and a lot of this is off-script, but bear with me: what if I got into an awful accident. I don’t know, maybe I got run over by a milk truck, and some of that stuff was gone. Am I someone else, or am I Ron?”

Cullen thought about it. It seemed like a trick question. Yes was obvious, no was also obvious. No, because he was supposed to watch for discrepancies at this job. “I don’t know.”

“Exactly.” Ron smiled again, but he looked like he was almost uncomfortable doing it. “People and strangers are basically the same thing, unless they’re not. Some of us keep our skin the same on both sides of the wall. Others try to fit in.” And he leaned close again, looked at Cullen like he was trying to figure out if he, sitting right here in the sectional communications officer’s own den, was a trickster himself. “Do you know why I’m rambling right now, about this?”

“Because it’s important to the job.”

“Because it’s important to the job, and keeping the job from becoming too professional.” He leaned back, finished off his fruit juice, dropped every bit of humor from his voice. It contrasted sharply with his relaxed posture. “Here’s what this job actually is. They don’t want me to bring you in this way, since it turns away candidates, but they also know damn well it’s the truth, so they never stop me. You’re not here to turn people away or let them in. You’re here to bear the burden of feeling out which side of the wall they belong on.”

There was a period of quiet. Maybe it was to let the old man’s words sink in, maybe Ron just wanted him to process. “Can I ask something?” Cullen’s voice was lower, a bit tentative.

“Always.”

“You’re talking about our job - your job - like it doesn’t matter. So… What’s the point, then?”

“Formality.” There was another silence, one where Cullen waited for Ron to follow up with some more long-winded explanation. He got one, in a way. Ron adjusted his position, rested his head on his hand as he looked out at Society. “If I picked up my mug and tried to break your nose, what would happen?”

“What?” Cullen pursed his lips. “I’d hit back.”

“And?”

“One of us, or both of us, would go to jail.”

“The point is to keep that making sense. If I walked all the way to the ends of the earth, out into that great unknown, maybe I’d come back with all the answers. Maybe I’d find none. Maybe, there’d be someone sitting at a desk over there, with a bunch of lights-” Ron gestured to the alert boards. “-With someone in a box telling them what to do about me.” He pulled out a cigarette, lit it right in front of Cullen.

Cullen didn’t bother pointing out the lack of professionalism. It didn’t seem like it mattered.

The old man continued. “I’m going to tell them to hire you now. I’m going to hand you some pamphlets, when you come back. You seem like a reasonable kid, who will listen when I tell you to do something, and maybe you’ll listen to the other people who I rotate with. But-”

“But?”

“-I need you to remember that we don’t know much. I can’t tell you where they came from, or why they came now. But I can tell you a few things: the more like us they seem, the less they have to learn, the more you should walk on eggshells. There will always be rules, and they will invariably be mostly bullshit. But they’ll be rules, so they’ll need to be followed.” He pulled an ashtray out of his desk, like putting out the cigarette was his equivalent to pulling out the bottle, not pulling out the bottle itself. “Nobody likes rule breakers. Not even them.”

Cullen wanted to ask if he meant them or the strangers, but it clicked: it didn’t matter.

Cullen was asked another series of questions. He was asked if he was comfortable working with strangers. He said yes. He was asked if he could be trusted to follow instructions, and he said yes. He was asked if he had any useful skills, and he gave them. He was asked if he had any mementos he wanted to bring in, and only hesitated when asked if he’d give them up if necessary. Finally, he was asked if he understood he was putting his life at risk, of his own volition, and if he understood that he would be severely punished if he intentionally neglected his duties and put others at risk.

He said yes.  
\---

When Ron returned from his authorized vacation days, Cullen did not ask to be let into Ron’s office. He did not ask for permission to put the note and the photo from the tube on his desk, sit down, and ask him what the hell it meant.

“It means we’re getting an inspection.” Ron answered, smoothly despite his half-burnt tone.

“From who?” Cullen asked. His voice was not smooth. It was not calm, in either sense.

“I don’t know. But be on your best behavior.”

“Excuse me?” Cullen’s muscles tensed as he felt himself quickly losing his cool. He took a deep breath, looked Ron in the eye as he was about to say something, then tossed the photo onto his desk. Ron stared at it. He blinked, briefly off-balanced, before fully focusing his attention on Cullen. Facing him in full now.

“Do you remember when I said I don’t know what’s on the other side?” Ron didn’t wait to follow up. He started to pull out a cigarette, paused, and put the pack back. The gesture was enough to get Cullen to hold off for a moment. “I think I used to. I’m pretty sure I used to remember what the actual name of the place we walled up was, too. I’m pretty sure I could place a name on every town out in that hellscape-” And he flicked his eyes to the Outside. “But I can’t now.”

“And why not? What is making you - making everyone - forget, Ron?”

“I don’t know. But what I know is that, the ones who are meant to come inside act like they belong, and the ones that aren’t… They take things. Sometimes, they take each other. Sometimes, its places. The things we really want to keep, we stop naming. There’s special ones. Ones that like to keep things… Proper, who come around sometimes. More proper than normal.”

“Why doesn’t anyone else know about the extra rules? Why’d I learn half this shit going out to the walls?”

“You know how people leave their coat, and their shoes, at the entrance? You don’t have to wear your shoes past the door. If someone tracks mud in anyways, nobody wants them in the house.”

“Come on, Ron. Cut the dance-around shit.”

“You don’t need them inside. You just need them outside. And nobody wants there to be nowhere to go, so my guess is there’s someone who wants to do our job, their way.”

“What do I do, Ron? Advise me. It’s your job.”

Cullen expected Ron to look angry. Instead, he just looked… Hollow. He slumped into his big fancy chair. Now he took out the cigarette, now he lit it. “You follow the rules, so that they keep making sense to everyone inside. I’ll do the best I can to help, and Tommy will too, and so will Lupe.” There was a pause. A tension. Ron leaned forward, looked Cullen in the eye like he always did when he really wanted to communicate something’s importance. “Cullen.”

Cullen didn’t say a word, looked slightly aside. Out the window, towards Outside. Ron spoke anyway.

“The ones who we let in. The ones we were supposed to let in. There’s no… Conspiracy. If you’re meant to be inside, you’re meant to be inside. That’s all there is to it. Don’t look at ‘where from’, but ‘who is’.” Ron closed his eyes briefly. Cullen almost let that be all there was to it. The conversation was over and all that was left to do was quietly return to work. But there was one last thing.

“Why did you take this job, Ron?”

Ron blinked, caught off guard. He laughed, shook his head. “I’m waiting for someone to come back, too.” His voice didn’t have any humor in it, just… Other things. The humor faded from his face with the next sentence. “I want there to be something for them to come back to. That’s all.”

Cullen left his office. He was not stopped by security, and it dawned on him that maybe Ron had known he’d be storming up to his office and just did not care. Or, he’d already known what was going to happen, with the ‘inspector’ and their ‘notice’ or warning or whatever it had been. Either someone called him before he got back, or…

It didn’t matter, either way. For all he knew they just didn’t have leftover staff for it. And it wasn’t Ron’s job to let people in, it was his.

When he returned to the checkpoint booth area, he sat down. Flexed his fingers, picked up his mug. He didn’t drink from it, it was empty right now. He stared at it, instead. Even after all these years, it still made sense to him that he hadn’t been left behind on purpose. And it still made sense to do his job. What didn’t make sense anymore was all the little lines in the sand, which ones were real and which ones weren’t.

He looked over at Lupe. Let himself actually look at her, for the first time in days. He knew what she was, everyone did. They showed each other on the first day, to diffuse the tension of knowing but not seeing it. Her hair was short clipped, her face was completely in line with the exact image you’d have in your head if you only thought of a stranger as someone you didn’t quite get a good look at going down the street: plain, pleasant if you cared, nothing important if you didn’t.

But he didn’t think she was hiding what she hid because she was trying to lie to anyone. If she were trying to hide anything, she wouldn’t be shaking right now. Cullen followed her eyes towards the second window of the security checkpoint, watched her skim over every single monitor and alert system. He became uneasy because she was uneasy, his shoulders tensed because hers did.

He was afraid because he knew what she was, but she was never fully at ease when she went Outside. And he’d never seen her watch the window like that before.

Cullen pulled out the photo. He’d taken it back off Ron’s desk on the way out. He needed it in front of him so he knew it was real.

It was customary to have photos taken, when you did anything with strangers. It made the ones you wanted around feel normal, and it proved to the people you thought were normal that they showed up on camera still. It was also said that, sometimes, unfits would not show up, or you could catch them in the hidden corners of photos, and you’d know they were nearby. It was even said, if something was off about someone in a photo, it was because they were not meant to be there.

Ron was supposed to be there. So was Tommy, and Lupe, in all her strangeness, her real self. The Moss Man was meant to be there, too, having been caught in the background not long before he showed up properly and earned passage through the gates. There’d been a few others: some security officers, the ones that made double triple sure the people coming in were supposed to and that they hadn’t learned human tactics, like concealed firearms. Some of the comm aids, the other shifts… It was supposed to have at least two dozen people in it.

Only Cullen was there. And, if he looked, he could see people who he had never met, who did not look quite right, in the shadows between the trees. Cullen was slightly distorted in the photo, and he had no idea if that was an omen or not. This was a copy, the original was still in a scrapbook type folder somewhere, so could’ve just been a shitty print that got edited. But what he knew, for certain fact, was that he did not like that he was alone in it.

He liked it even less when he compared it to the apartment complex photo, from when he'd moved into the place he lived now, and noticed most of the other people who lived with him were still in it, except one specific individual. He’d seen him disappear on the monitor, into that closet, but he’d only seen his hand then. Cullen wondered if he was alone, wherever he was, and also wondered if that was good or bad. Part of him, selfishly, hoped he never found out. If he found out, he might also discover, for certain, that he was the reason he was gone.

He looked at Lupe again. He wanted to ask what she was afraid of. Almost opened his mouth and said the words. Then he decided he did not want to know. Instead, he wanted to make sure none of them found out.
