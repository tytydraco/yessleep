I was a high school dropout. I tried hard to get good grades, but it was impossible. I shouldn’t have had any problems passing, but unfortunately I couldn’t get much homework or studying done. Why? Well, because I had a terrible home life. I ended up developing a terrible drug addiction after I failed three of my final exams at the end of 10^(th) grade. That was the end of it. I couldn’t recover and ultimately had to drop out that next year.

Word ended up getting out to my parents. They did their best to support me… eh who am I kidding, they were pissed. When they read the letter, they spent hours screaming at me, calling me a drug lord. Said I was a failure and an embarrassment to the family. They wanted me out of the house, but I was only 17 at the time and they didn’t want to face any legal bullshit. A few months after that was my 18^(th) birthday, so they probably thought they could deal with me for a bit longer.

The day of my birthday, I went downstairs, and my parents were waiting for me at the dining room table, a big envelope in front of them. I sat down across from them as they slid the envelope over to me. Inside was a $2,000 check and a note:  ‘*Don’t get overly excited at the check, this is your official notice that you have one month to find a place and move out. Save the money for that time, or you will be screwed. DO NOT USE IT TO BUY DRUGS!*’

I stared at my parents. My father simply said “what are you just sitting there for? The clock is ticking!” And that was it… I spent the next 10 days extensively looking for a new place to live, plus a job so I didn’t end up broke.

I finally found a place. It sucked, but it was cheap and livable. After about two months, I was starting to run dangerously low on money. I was recovering from my addiction, but only because I had almost no more money to spend on them.

I kid you not, only five days before rent was due, I finally found what I thought was a break. A part time gig had been recently posted at the bottom of my search results on indeed.com. An office building nearby was hiring a night guard. No experience required, but they specifically stated that this was a challenging position. I had nothing to lose at that point, so I applied. I was shocked to get a call from them later that day wanting an interview.

The interview was strange. When I got there, I noticed that it was surrounded by dozens of trees, like it was secluding itself from the rest of the town. The building looked a bit worn down from the outside. Only one company owned the entire 3-story building: ‘*Sertain Goods*’. The interviewer, who I learned was the boss of the place, was a nice guy. His name was Chad Kirkwood. The interview was strangely short; it was basically just verifying my name, showing him an ID, and confirming I was interested in the position. Before I had a chance to ask any in depth questions, he offered me the job on the spot. I stuttered for a second but quickly accepted it and he said to be back there at 9PM sharp on Monday. I shook his hand, and he hurried me out of the room. I should’ve taken that as a warning sign of what was to come, but I naively just went home with a huge smile on my face.

The day came for my first shift. I wasn’t told what to wear, so I just wore a plain polo shirt and jeans. When I got there, the entire place seemed eerily different than before. The trees completely hid the building this time. Heck, even the road to the parking lot was barely visible. If I hadn’t known about the road, I would’ve probably missed it. Passing by the trees, I noticed the building and parking lot were barely lit. I struggled for a bit to even find the front entrance. When I found it, I went into the lobby. A single worker was at the reception desk. She seemed almost relieved to see me. Before I could ask her name, she said “oh you must be the new security guy! Welcome to Sertain Goods! Your uniform is on the table in the breakroom (far down the hall and to the right) along with a descriptive set of rules, policies, and procedures that you will need to follow while here.” After that, she unhooked the building keys from her waist, handed them over to me, and quickly left the building.

‘*Odd…*’ I said to myself, looking at the dozens of keys now in my hand. After a second, I shrugged it off and went way down the hall into the breakroom. I saw a clean and folded security guard shirt. I put it on and noticed the paper that the woman was referring to and picked it up. I began reading…

‘*Welcome to Sertain Goods: Providing the Best Goods and Services Around! Your position as our new part-time Night Security Guard will be anything but boring. You agreed that you were up for the challenge, and we hope you are fully prepared. Please adhere to the following rules. Trust us, these are super important.*

*1.*     *Your shift will begin at 10PM sharp and end at 6AM, every Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Do not show up late. If you are late, call the emergency number, listed at the end of this document, and stay away from the office. You will not be paid for that shift. If you are sick, call the same number and we will negotiate your pay for that shift at a later date.*

*2.*     *Make sure to be in the security office before 10PM sharp. Close the door as you enter the room. You will not be permitted to leave the office until 10:30PM. If you need to use the restroom, please use the one in the office. If you are not in the security office at 10PM sharp, find the closest room, turn the lights off, and hide until 6AM. This rule is crucial for your job.*

*3.*     *During your time in the office, monitor the cameras. If you see anything out of the ordinary, shut off the camera in that room. You will hear a clicking noise, which should ‘fix’ whatever is wrong. After a few seconds, turn the camera back on. If the ‘anomaly’ is still there, repeat the process until things return to normal.*

*4.*     *You will need to make three rounds during the night: 10:30, 2:30, and 5:30. During this time you will need to search all three floors. Quickly turn on each room’s light, check the room, and turn them off. If you see anything out of the ordinary, or if the lights are already on in an office, immediately turn off the light, shut the door, and lock it. The keys you have are all numbered appropriately, so this task should be no issue. Any locked doors from your previous rounds should stay locked for the remainder of the night. Leave all ‘normal’ rooms’ doors open.*

*5.*     *At 12:00 exactly, you may hear various sounds coming from the large conference room on the 1*^(st) *floor (Room 110). If you do, sneak up to the door and lock it. Do not open the door under any circumstance. If the door is already open, immediately return to the office WITHOUT looking in the room and lock your door. For extra security, you have a key with a star imprinted on it that can be used on the door too. This is a secondary lock that only works from the inside of the room in case any intruders are trying to get in.*

*6.*     *If at any time the lights suddenly shut off in any of the hallways, turn off all cameras on that floor for 15-20 minutes and then turn them back on. If this event interferes with one of your rounds, skip that floor. If the lights shut off on the floor you are on, get out of there, or hide in the closest room until the end of your shift. You will not have much time!*

*7.*     *The breakroom has coffee and snacks that you are free to take throughout your shift after 10:30. However, if you notice the coffee pot is empty, or if you empty it yourself, brew a new pot immediately. The breakroom will be safe otherwise, but just remember to follow the other rules!*

*8.*     *At 4:44AM, the doorbell from the visitor access area may ring. Press & hold the intercom on your desk to talk. Simply say ‘yes?’ If you hear no response, ignore it. If you hear ‘I am here with a new shipment of supplies!’, respond with ‘please leave them in the lobby, thank you!’ and unlock the door with the appropriate button. Once the visitor leaves, lock the door with the other button. If you hear any other response whatsoever, say ‘sorry I cannot let you in’. And no matter what happens next, do not respond.*

*9.*     *Cell phones are forbidden during your shift. You may bring books, puzzles, etc. during down periods, but you must keep your phone* *\~shut off completely\~*\*. If you forget, or ignore, this rule, you may hear a loud noise quickly approaching the security office. Immediately lock the door, turn off the lights, and hide under your desk until the sound goes away.\*

*10.*  *During your patrols, if you see any intruders, direct them to the exit and threaten to call the police.* *\~However\~*\*, if the intruder is wearing a lavishing red dress, avoid eye contact and walk slowly (and calmly) back to the office. If you hear an echoing giggle, run and hide.\*

*11.*  *This is the most important rule: Do NOT try to leave the building in the middle of your shift, even if you think it’s safe. You must stay in the building until the end of your shift, or you might have bigger problems, other than getting fired, to worry about.*

*Again, thank you so much for your interest in this job and we hope you enjoy your first shift! Remember, follow the rules and you will be just fine!*

I’ve been pranked enough times to know when I’m getting my leg pulled. But there was something eerie about this set of rules. The entire creepy atmosphere, interview, and the interaction with my coworker helped me not simply brush the rules off. Could this be a clever prank set up by my new boss? Yes. But I’ve been in enough situations before that I understand playing it safe is much better. I was obviously desperate to keep this job anyway. If I make an ass out of myself by following these rules, then whatever.

Looking at the time, I saw it was only 9:15. So I grabbed some coffee and reread the rules several times. These were complicated as hell, but I made sure I kept them close by… just in case.

At 9:55 I made my way into the security office and got set up for my shift. Out of habit, I closed the door behind me. At exactly 10:00, I nearly crapped my pants as a loud bang was heard in the hallway. It almost sounded like a gunshot. ‘*What in the world was THAT?’*, I thought. I sat stunned, staring wide-eyed at the hallway, not knowing what to do. I then found myself slowly leaning towards the doorway to look outside. It almost felt like I was doing it automatically. I stopped quickly and realized how stupid of an idea that would’ve been and sat back in my chair.

After a moment, I remembered the rules and realized I almost made a stupid mistake. My first shift and I almost broke a rule in the first minute.

I contemplated calling the police and reporting an armed intruder in the office. However, I hesitated. I don’t remember why. For some reason I decided not to call them. Two minutes of awkward silence later, I heard a really creepy moaning sound coming from the hallway. It almost sounded like pipes or wind in a tunnel. Nothing made sense to me at that point… Another few minutes later, the hallway lights started dimming and the sound got louder. I jolted up and backed up against the wall. The office began to gently shake. *An earthquake?* I thought. I shifted over to the doorway between the office and bathroom. One of the few things I remembered learning in school was that being a safe spot.

As I prepared to crouch down for safety, I saw something odd. There was a small window in my office that looked into the hallway. A weird shadow seemed to slide past quickly. The hallway completely darkened as the moaning sound got even louder. A split second later, the hall began to get lighter again. The lights stopped dimming and the sound disappeared. With that the office also stopped shaking.

I was baffled. Was I being pranked? What the hell? I was stuck just staring at the window, wondering what just happened. Was that real, or were my withdrawal symptoms worsening? My head was running wild. ‘*What is happening to me? Am I tired? Are these related to withdrawal? Am I just hallucinating because of stress? Or… are the rules actually real?*’ I snapped out of it and splashed some water on my face from my bottle. I slowly turned on the cameras and was slightly relieved to see that nothing was out of place. I continued to monitor things, but my heart was pounding. The eerie silence, except the hum of the monitors in front of me, kept me on edge.

‘*I’ve been pranked before, but never in a way that felt so… real. And it was so complex. There’s no way that was a prank, right?*’ I pulled out the rules and re-read them again. I knew at that point that I made the right call following them. I had been creeped out earlier in life, but nothing topped that night. The dread I felt was enough to make the hairs stand on the back of my neck. But thankfully, things stayed normal until it was time for my first round.

10:30 slowly flashed across my watch. I sighed. I slowly creaked the door open and peered into the hallway. Nothing. Grabbing the flashlight and ring of keys, I made my way down the hallway. I passed the lobby and turned the corner. I was met with the sight of the first-floor office doors. Breathing slowly, I proceeded.

The lights in the hallway stayed on, but the uneasy silence made me doubt my safety. I reached the first office door. Room 101. I noticed the door was open. Slowly reaching in and turning on the lights, I saw a small room with a desk, computer, and some pictures. Everything was normal. I turned the light off and proceeded.

There was a nice mix of conference rooms, large office spaces, and single offices on the floor. Things were looking good. Suddenly, I heard a faint thump down the hall. I jumped but saw nothing. I felt paranoid. What would my parents or friends say if they had seen me at that point? Oh, I know the words they would’ve used, but I’m not going to share them here. Continuing through, I saw the rooms were still normal. But then, I reached room 117. The thumping noise came back suddenly. Right in front of me in the dark room. Panicking, I flipped the light on. The room was absolutely trashed. A broken computer was on the ground. The desk was overturned and covered in… claw marks? Both chairs flipped over. Crumpled papers and broken picture frames were scattered all over the floor. And the walls… the walls were covered in a layer of, something dark. Was it dirt? Blood? I had no idea. Rule 4 flashed in my head: *If you see anything out of the ordinary, or if the lights are already on in an office, immediately turn off the light, shut the door, and lock it*. I reached inside for the door, shut the lights off, and slammed it shut. Fumbling with the keys, I found the one with a ‘117’ imprinted on it and shoved it in the lock. Right as I heard the lock click, a sudden scratching noise came from the other side of the door. I jumped back and began running back to the security office. When I reached the corner, I stopped and saw nothing behind me.

Rule 11 reminded me I was stuck there until the morning. I was now fully convinced I was not getting pranked. This shit was serious. They would not trash an entire office room just to prank a new part-time security guard. ‘*Come on, grow a pair!*’ I thought and started going back down the hall. I quickly passed by room 117. Nothing seemed wrong at that point. I quickly finished checking the remaining rooms on the floor. The second floor was also completely clear, which was a relief.

Entering the third floor, I was greeted with the lights dimming. I froze. ‘*Did the rules mention the lights dimming, or was it them going out? Dammit I don’t remember!*’ I thought to myself, biting my bottom lip. I contemplated running back to the security room. But before I convinced myself to bolt, the lights stopped dimming. I stalled for as long as I could, taking deep breaths before proceeding. The thought of the cameras being unmonitored sent me into a brief panic, but I swallowed it and pushed through the floor. Room 301, normal. 302, normal. 303, normal… things were fine. But then I paused. The lights in room 313 were on. I skipped the other doors and snuck over to the room. Before I could reach inside to turn the lights off, I saw it. A tall, black mannequin. Just standing there motionless in the room. This thing was tall, like it almost was too tall for the doorway. I was frozen in fear immediately, like prey trying to hide from a wild predator.

The mannequin looked like it was facing the desk, its shiny plastic body reflecting the light all around it. But if that wasn’t disturbing enough, it also was one of those headless mannequins. No freaking head. A seven-foot tall, shiny, black, headless mannequin… only about five feet in front of me. I probably stood motionless for a minute, but then suddenly the mannequin fell. Its front unnaturally fell towards the desk. I hadn’t touched it, breathed on it, nothing. A second later the lights in the room flicked off. I panicked and quickly pulled the door shut. I fished around for the key for room 313, but I struggled. I pulled on the handle as hard as I could so the door wouldn’t open. Loud pounding came from the door that made me drop my keys. I picked them up, sweating non stop trying to find the damn key. Finally, I found it. I crammed it into the lock and twisted it until I heard the clicking sound. The door suddenly became motionless, and the knocking stopped. It then became silent again.

Not knowing if this counted as ‘turning the lights off’, I took my chance and moved on. I went back and quickly finished going through the remaining rooms. Thankfully, everything else was normal. I hurried back to the security room and slammed the door shut. I fell into my chair and broke down. Tears formed in my eyes, and I couldn’t stop shaking. I pulled out the rules and reviewed Rule 4: *If you see anything out of the ordinary, or if the lights are already on in an office, immediately turn off the light, shut the door, and lock it*. I cursed myself out, thinking I must’ve been standing there motionless for too long.

This was real. If it hadn’t been obvious before, it was at that moment. I understood why that woman looked relieved when I first arrived and got the heck out of that place. My goals changed immediately. Money? Hell no, I would’ve rather been homeless than stay there. Survive? Yes. I wanted to get to the morning and get out. I could tell that my mental health was diminishing, but I didn’t care. Screw it, I’d rather go insane if that meant I could survive the night.

Around 11:30, I was monitoring the cams when I began to feel exhausted. I didn’t realize until then that I had gone through my entire cup of coffee. That stuff barely did anything to me, so I knew I needed more to avoid drifting off. I peeked into the hallway and quickly made my way to the break room. Going inside, I immediately felt calm. It felt like an unusually relaxing aura just filled the room.

However, the calmer I got, the drowsier I got. I filled my cup with coffee and began walking out. That was, until I stopped dead in my tracks. Rule 7… I turned back. The coffee pot was empty. My vision then began to get blurry and I got dizzy. Something wasn’t right, but I knew right away I had screwed up again. ‘*Oh shit, oh no…*’ I thought as I stumbled forward to the pot. I replaced the coffee filter, but before I could reach for the coffee grounds, I heard a whisper. I jumped back and turned. My vision was much blurrier, and I thought I saw a shadow in the distance. I turned back muttering some curse words again, causing me to tumble forward. I grabbed the closest chair, pushed up to the countertop, and opened a cabinet. Before I could reach inside, I heard another whisper. Turning back, again there was nothing. I turned around quickly and accidentally slammed my head into the cabinet door and ended up falling to the ground. Things were getting worse. I pushed myself up and lunged for the grounds. I took a handful, slammed them into the machine, and hit ‘brew’. Almost instantly, the whispers faded. My vision came back, but my head hurt from where I bumped it. After the coffee finished brewing, I stumbled to the security office, coffee in hand, and yelled out in frustration. I pounded on the office chair several times before slumping down and continued monitoring the cameras.

The rage had started. I was so sick of that place at that point. If I ever saw my ‘boss’ after that point, I seriously considered slugging him in the face. I did not care one bit. I thought that jail could’ve been even better than a homeless shelter. I was thinking irrationally. I was pissed. Even when I had anger issues on drugs, I never felt that furious. Hell, I almost scared myself.

I continued monitoring the cameras. I started to calm down and focus, but my hands were gripping my coffee cup tightly and my teeth clenched. I could tell that I would lose it on someone… or something if things kept going that way. Midnight eventually rolled around. As soon as my watch beeped at 12:00 AM, I began to hear something. It was different than before; it was like chattering at a social event of some sort. Confused, I slowly approached the door and opened it. In the hallway, the sounds were louder. They were coming down the hallway. I made my way into the lobby. It was empty as expected, but the noises were still there. Unfortunately, that was when my anger started rising again. I was not in the mood for anyone’s bullshit after the stuff I had gone through. ‘*Damn teenagers got into this place? Or some stupid boozehounds thinking they could hide out for the night… What is wrong with people? They are about to hear it from me!*’

I turned the corner into the first-floor hallway. As I moved along, the noises got louder still. It did not sound like drunk teenagers, but I still assumed it was some morons trying to throw some type of ‘secret party’. ‘*They need to leave, NOW!!!*’ I angrily thought as I stormed through the hallway. As I got closer to the source, I saw a little bit of light coming from the room. I thought that these bozos thought keeping the lights low wouldn’t bring any attention to them. They were mistaken!

Fuming at that point, I noticed the noises were coming from room 110. I remember earlier seeing it was a large conference, or lunch, room. I knew I was probably outnumbered but hoped those people would see me and flee without any problems. When I was about two feet away from the door, a thought crossed my mind ‘*Wasn’t there a rule about this? Oh, I should stop and check before I-’.* Too late.

I reached the doorway. My entire body was in the frame as I looked into the room. My anger suddenly disappeared, and my eyes grew wide. The sound in the room stopped abruptly. As soon as I saw what was inside, my mind blared Rule 5 in my head. ‘*RULE 5! RULE 5! DO NOT LOOK INTO ROOM 110 AT MIDNIGHT!*’ I understood immediately why Rule 5 had been so specific and detailed… In the room, only a few dim lights showed me the 10 or so figures standing around the room. They looked human. But they were abnormally thin and lanky. There was not a single hair on any of them. They were extremely pale and had no clothing whatsoever. The worst part was when they all suddenly turned around to face me. Their… oh shit their faces. There were no eyes, no ears, no nose… all they had were very large mouths that basically stretched across their entire face. Sharp teeth in their large mouths, impossibly sharp…

No one moved. The creatures were still. I was still. I couldn’t move. I was paralyzed with fear. I could feel them looking at me even though they had no eyes. Without warning, one of them suddenly let out an ear-piercing scream. It was a horrific sound, almost like a blood curdling scream mixed with the roar of a vicious animal. Saliva and shreds of… who knows what, went flying out of its mouth. The inside of its mouth looked to have more and more rows of those damn teeth. Like it was horrifying. Its limbs suddenly revealed long, sharp claws.. My ears started ringing, but instantly my body started working again. I bolted down the hallway back towards the security office.

I heard them begin bursting into the hallway, chasing after me. I could tell some were on all fours and some were standing. Every single one of those things started screaming at once. The once quiet hallways were now full of the worst sound I had ever heard in my life. They were relentless. The sounds did not stop. My ears were starting to hurt.

I veered around the corner of the hallway towards the lobby. The creatures slammed into the wall before they quickly began chasing me again. The chipping, scraping sounds of floor tiles being ripped apart were present as the creatures began gaining on me. Once I got through the lobby, I felt the wind of one’s claws miss my back and neck. A few feet from the security door, one of them got me. Its claws ripped into my security shirt. I felt something hit my skin. I cursed and dove into the security office. Thankfully, a few of them overshot the door, causing a slight jam of creatures trying to get to the door. That bought me enough time to slam the door shut. I locked the door as extremely forceful pounding began on the door. The door and its hinges sounded like they started breaking. Thankfully, Rule 5 was stuck in my mind, and I remembered the star key. I located the second lock on the door, old and blended in. Ripping the keys out of my pocket, I fumbled for the star key. The star imprint felt like gold in my hand. I shoved the key in and locked it. A few moments later the pounding stopped. One of them let out a howl and then they all tore back down the hallway, leaving me alone. They left behind a severely damaged door, trashed hallway, and remnants of its disgusting breath.

How could I have been so stupid… my fury had almost cost me my life. All I needed to do was close and lock the door and return to the security office. That was it. And I screwed it up. Suddenly, all my fear and frustration became too much for me. I rushed into the bathroom and vomited into the toilet. My nausea skyrocketed. My body was practically breaking down at that point and screaming at me to find a way out. I knew the rules said I couldn’t, but I was getting desperate.

Tears started rolling down my face in the bathroom. ‘*F\*ck this place. F\*ck the cameras. I need to get out.*’ I slowly relaxed and took deep breaths as I washed my hands. I turned around at the mirror and sure enough, my uniform was absolutely mangled. My polo also took damage. I could see my skin, but it looked like the creature avoided cutting into me, which was a huge relief. I finished washing up, grabbed my bottle of water, and rinsed my mouth out. Returning to the chair, I grabbed my coffee and began taking some slow sips. I was wide awake now, but I was trying to stay calm and alert for absolutely anything. Everything was calm, so I finally began to settle down. I was taking advantage of that period of peace and quiet.
