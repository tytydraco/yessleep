hi, I'm Ben 29 male, my wife(melissa) is 27 fm.
We have a child, henry.


it is currently 11:30 at night.


me and my wife has had a really good relationship,but some nights we would get into arguments, we would usually apologize to eachother the next morning but, last morning she just got up and left. i thought she was still mad at me so i went to the shop to buy some flowers, i was going to my car and i saw my co-worker Ashley, she was so dreamy. brunette with bright blue eyes that always shined. i walked up to her and gave her the flowers,even tho they were for my wife.

i felt like i was being watched.

I invited Ashley to come with me to the bar for a few drinks,She accepted. we met up at the exact adress i sent her, we went to the bar and had a few drinks, thats when i realized how much i loved her..i tried to kiss her and she kissed me back,it felt like Heaven.but then i saw a shadow in the corner of my eye. i checked and there was nothing.i looked back at where ashley shouldve been but, she wasn't there. i checked everywhere but couldn't find her.

i woke up at 12(night) because i got a call, i picked it up Quickly and realised it was just Ashley. I said "Why'd you ditch me last night??" Ashley-"I'm sorry,i had to go because my husband needed me" I knew she didn't have a husband which only meant one thing.

its not Ashley.

I looked at the bed where my wife shouldve been, she wasnt there. Then she comes through the door with a coffee,that was strange because she doesn't like coffee.and she definitely shouldn't be awake at that time considering she had an important interview. Me-"Honey, why are you awake at this time?" Missa(nickname)- Im getting ready for my interview, you should go to sleep" Then Ash said "Is that your wife??" When missa heard Ash's voice she looked literally pissed,I didn't really care tho because I'm much stronger than her. She yelled "WHY ARE YOU STILL TALKING TO THAT GIRL?!" Me-"Chill, its 12am and,She called me." She took my phone and hung up the call. I was really mad but then i just suddenly blacked out..


I woke up again at 1pm In bed like normal,I looked over on my wifes side of the bed and i see her asleep. She must've Missed the interview!! i wake her up but she looks a bit...different.she looked pale and she had big eyebags under her eyes, i asked her whats wrong and she said "Nothing, dear, i better go to my interview now" I knew she wasn't going to an interview because it was done a while ago,but this was an opportunity to get with Ash again. Me-"Okay, bye honey! love you." She then leaves.


I call ash but she doesnt answer,I go to her house, shes not there. so i just sit down on my bed wondering where my wife and ash is.i have nothing to do so i just play on my game. 

10pm

my wife comes home covered in dirt and scars. she doesn't bother to talk but just drops all her things and goes to the shower...(part 2? maybe if im motivated to do it)
