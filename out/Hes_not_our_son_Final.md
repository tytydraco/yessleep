There is the end of alive. [There is the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/117rh26/hes_not_our_son_part_1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) of dead. In the middle there is Nameis. There is me. And Music. 

—

We didn’t want him to hear, so we told him to play his music loud. It seemed sickening.  His bounding children’s song would be ruined afterwards, forever linked with the memory of a dead little girl and a plastic hospital bag and a blue hoodie with a cut left sleeve. 

…And the contents of a pocket. 

“Paul, what does it mean?”

“I don’t know.”

“Why did he have these?”

I didn’t want to answer Rachel. I couldn’t. Not yet. 

She grimaced.  “They cut the hoodie off of him at the hospital and put it in the bag, which means he had them at the playground.”

“Yeah.”

“Well—maybe it’s not something bad. Right? It’s not necessarily something bad. Maybe someone at school—or—maybe he found them. Why would he keep them though?” She paused and nervously chewed a nail. “Any thoughts Paul? Because if I’m being crazy I need you to tell me.”

My hand shook. I swallowed. 

“I—I think they were hers.”

“Her—oh fuck—*Tansy*? Why would—“

Rachel had opened the hospital bag. She said that she just felt like she needed to. I finally told her about the night I found Eddie standing in the corner of our room. I hadn’t wanted to. I didn’t want her to fear our son as I did. But I suppose *I* felt like I needed to. 

Our son wasn’t normal. He had killed a little girl and I told Rachel the rest. Before that, Tansy had been crying and before that, standing next to the castle where Eddie had smirked from a narrow window. I wasn’t watching him closely enough. But I’d watched Rachel, sullen, pulling Eddie’s hoodie from the bag. Then Rachel, confused, pulling a little pair of pink underwear from the pocket. Now, she stared at those underwear on the verge of tears. 

“Paul—what did our little boy do?”

I couldn’t answer her with certainty. I hadn’t seen. No one had. And no one knew the truth except for the one who’d gotten away with it all. They treated him like a victim, and I’d let them, because he was my son. 

“I don’t think he’ll get better, Rachel. I think he’ll get worse.”

She wept and Cooper napped in his bassinet and the muffled sound of music filled the hall as I went downstairs to the kitchen for a drink. 

—

He grew thirsty, hungry, but never tired as he built their church of bones. It was their god’s wish that the boy should do the work alone. Lieutenant Nameis was merely the engineer. 

Their god would be pleased. He would reward their sacrifice with peace—an end to the war that had consumed everything, including the reason for its existence. Its beginnings seemed so distant now, its first blood faded into obscurity upon the field of cloth where so many had since bled and died. But the past was unimportant. Nameis knew that. He repeated it to himself like a prayer. 

The soldiers he had commanded had been his brothers once. But the past was unimportant. They had fought for an ideal once. But the past was unimportant. They had skirmished and routed and retreated and rallied to keep each other safe once. But the past was unimportant. They had been alive once. But the past was unimportant. Now the boy stacked their bones in artful ranks and files and built a future atop a foundation of death. 

Nameis had run out of enemies some time before. The last vestiges of their populace, scattered and hidden, shaking the air in fear just enough for a musician to find their whispering notes. In his constant practise, the boy had become a crimson virtuoso. But he had played every song the enemy had to offer, so he sought his music elsewhere. 

Nameis’ men had screamed too. Their music resonated with the psychology of betrayal—pure notes that left Nameis absolutely breathless. The silence that followed was a kind of music of its own. A final rest awaiting the applause of their patient god. 

It wouldn’t be long now. The church was high and pale, sturdy and beautiful. Inside, the boy would build an altar and their god would give them one last song. 

“It’s nearly done, Lieutenant Nameis.”

“You have done wonderful work, Eddie, my boy.”

—

Eddie had done terrible things, in the light of day, surrounded by people. He hadn’t looked hesitant or concerned, he looked at ease. He had a facility for manipulation beyond his age, a comfort with cruelty, but he didn’t kill animals, he didn’t set fires, he didn’t wet the bed and we hadn’t neglected him. Had we? 

I browsed warning signs of psychopathy in children on my phone as I sat alone in our kitchen with a bottle of bourbon that hadn’t wanted a glass. He’d gotten sympathy from the parents of a girl he murdered, he’d tricked a fucking psychiatrist; what if he had killed animals and set fires? What if he just hadn’t gotten caught? What if he’d looked at ease that day because Tansy wasn’t the f—no.  *No*. 

I took a pull from the bottle, tried to focus on the burn. My thumbs opened a new search on my phone, typed, ‘Missing children near’—no. He was my boy. He couldn’t be—*fuck*—another swig of whiskey, long and stupefying.

I set the phone down and started at the bottle, then at the kitchen knives I sometimes counted out of fear. They were all there. They always were. And Eddie had been so good recently. 

“Share a swig?”

Rachel slumped onto my shoulder and reached for the bottle before I could answer. 

“Sure.” 

“This is the third time Baby Shark has played. He’s too old for this song. Why does he like it?”

“I dunno.”

She settled into the stool beside me and melted onto the island’s countertop. 

“I’m a bad mom, Paul. Fuck. There were so many things I wanted to do as a mom. Good things, but now—“

“You’re not a bad mom.”

“Our fourth grader scares the shit out of me. A child I raised. Fuck honey, he *killed* a girl. Took her from a mother who was probably so much better than me, so much more patient and attentive and nice. How does that not make me bad?”

She wore her tears like makeup as she spoke, present but barely noticeable. I didn’t want this. 

“You love him.”

“I don’t know if I do. I used to love him, when he was sweet and he needed me, and for the past couple weeks, he’s been good and every now and then I *think* I love him. But then I see his eyes, and I realize that all I love is the peace of this fucking act.”  She paused and drank a finger from the bottle. “When I see his eyes, I don’t feel love. I feel dread, because I know that the act will end.”

“So what do we do? What *can* we do? Everyone—Doctor Foster included—think that he’s normal.”

“Doctor Foster.” She sighed. “I’ve spent the past ten minutes with his little journal, writing my feelings. Horrible fucking angry things about Eddie. And I don’t feel better. I feel like a bad mom. But maybe I’ll be tipsy enough in a few to forget that.”

I didn’t want this. I wanted her to be okay. “I love you, Rache.”

“You too.”

The music rose as she left me alone in the kitchen. Eddie had opened his door. Perhaps he would come downstairs and tell me how beautifully I drank with a big plastic smile and his dull black eyes. It would be best to earn the compliment, right?  I gulped miserably, swallowed, and the whiskey washed away my cynicism for a moment. 

I didn’t want to resent his kindness. I had agreed to take him to therapy and he had managed to tell Doctor Foster the truth after suggesting that I had hurt him. Was that remorse? Whatever the reason, he had changed afterwards. It might have been an act, but I acted happy sometimes until I actually was. If he could change, if he could learn to be good, then this is what it would look like I supposed. Eddie smiling. Eddie being—

“PAUL!”

Rachel didn’t yell my name, she shrieked it. 

“HELP ME!”

I ran up the stairs imagining horrible things, stumbling, sobered by adrenaline as my body lagged behind. 

“Rachel?!”

I passed Eddie in the hall, smirking, hands bloody. 

“What did you—“

“PAUL! PLEASE!”

I pushed passed him, into my bedroom. Something crunched underfoot as I entered. Rachel was screaming. Crying. Covered in blood. Standing on her side of the bed. 

Looking down into the bassinet. 

“Paul! Call 911! Oh god, what did he do?”

I dialed. 

“Cooper! Wake up baby. Wake up. Please fucking wake up!”

“Hello? Yes this is an emergency. Fuck! Um—my son has been stabbed. There’s a lot of blood and—he’s one and a half, and—no—he’s not conscious.”

“I’m so sorry, baby, please just be okay. Please just—“

“Yeah, that’s right, Fernhill *Lane*.  Fuck. Fuck!—honey, she says to apply pressure to the wound.”

“Just be okay. Just be okay.”

“Rachel! Pressure!”

“Which wound?! Jesus fucking Christ—my poor little guy—just be okay. Please!”

“Yes. Still in the house. It’s my—Rachel, I’m gonna lock the bedroom door, okay? I’m still here.”

“What do I do, Paul?  There’s too much blood. Paul—what do I do?”

“They’re on their way, honey—Hurry. Please. Please just fucking—“

“What do I do, Paul?  Baby, just be okay. Just wake up. Wake up. Wake up Cooper, Please. It’s mommy. Please! What do I fucking do? PAUL! TELL ME WHAT TO DO!  Please. What do I do?”

There was nothing to do. Our baby was dead. 

Eddie had cut Cooper’s neck and left a shard of wine glass in Cooper’s belly. He’d scattered others across the floor; he must’ve pulled them from the trash and waited. And as Rachel wept, cradling the limp body of our boy, Baby Shark screamed from the hall and Eddie thumped against the bedroom door. 

I feared what I would do if I opened it. I would not speak to him. Couldn’t. But he stopped and spoke to us. 

“Mommy! Awww…Poor cry-bitch-baby Rachel lost her little Leftenant Nameis! Waahhh, Mommy! Waaahhhhh!”

“Eddie! Shut your fucking mo—“

He thumped again, hard enough to rattle knob. 

“Scream, Paul! Waahhh! Make your pretty music for the boy!”

“Stop it Eddie! Why are you doing this?!” Rachel sobbed her words and Eddie thumped. 

“Naaaameis! Leftenant Nameis, bleeding art! Poor brother baby bitch!” Thump. “He sang a song!” Thump. “For no one but his patient god of death!”

The sirens crept up thinly from the din of sharks and thumps and the blood coursing through my temples. The police arrived first. Eddie was quiet by the time I heard them pounding on the front door. When I unlocked our bedroom door, they were already in the hall. One officer had his gun drawn, held low. The other knelt down, consoling Eddie as he whimpered on the floor. And in an instant, I realized that I knew nothing about my child. 

His hands were clean. Washed. Free of the blood he’d spilled. And his face—he hadn’t been banging on the door. He had been collecting bruises. 

“Step back, sir. Hands away from your waist.”

The officer with the pistol was young, tight shouldered, wary eyes roving. 

“I called you.” As firm as I could manage. “My son—“

“He’s in there?” He gestured with his chin at the bedroom door; still holding his gun. What had Eddie told him?

I nodded and he pushed past me. His manner faltered as he stepped through the door and saw. 

“Shit.”  

He radioed something just as a pair of EMTs appeared in the hall. I watched them enter our bedroom as I itched to go back in. 

“You getting a pulse?”

“Sir, stay in the hall.”

“I wanna be with my wife!”

“Ma’am, you have to let them do their job. They’re trying to—Sir! Stay in the hall. Buckner, could you—“

“Yeah, I got it. Sir, I’m Officer Buckner. What’s your name?”

“Paul.”

“I’m still getting nothing with the AED.”

“What—what does that mean?”

“I’m really sorry, ma’am.”

“This is Baker-Five. You got anyone in homicide near Fernhill Lane?”

Two different officers listened to my story before they let me see Rachel. The first, Buckner, didn’t hide his disbelief well. The second—a detective—glad-handed and commiserated vacantly. Another stood officiously beside the door as Rachel and I finally talked. 

“They don’t believe me, Paul.”

Our chaperone made no secret of eavesdropping. I didn’t feel like talking. I tried not to think of anything and hugged Rachel who, like me, now wore different clothes. The clothes we’d had were now in evidence bags. 

More and more people swarmed our house, some busy, some bored, some simply occupying space, and I wanted desperately to be somewhere else. Mercifully, the grief over Cooper hadn’t fully hit me and I supposed the frenetic atmosphere and the noise of a dozen different people was good for that at least. 

There hadn’t been time to grieve. And they weren’t treating us like we’d earned it. 

“You can go ahead and bag those.”

“Dennis, you mind taking a look at this?”

The pieces of conversation were all entirety grim and entirely innocuous. But we hadn’t done anything. 

“The front door was locked.”

“You check the back?”

“PC?”

“This and everything else? Yeah.”

We waited. Together. Rachel staring at the floor as I watched the officer by the door thumbing at his phone screen. They’d taken Cooper. Rachel didn’t want to let him go. But Eddie we hadn’t seen. We hadn’t heard him either.  I didn’t ask about him as the detective entered, and whispered to the officer on the door. 

“Mrs. George, could you go ahead and stand up for me? Mr. George, you can stay seated.”

“W-what’s happening? Rachel, you don’t have to—“

“Turn around and put your palms together behind your back, ma’am.”

The detective stood lazily in the doorframe. He was holding a plastic bag in his hand.  I recognized Rachel’s little journal inside. She was crying as the door officer read Miranda Rights from a card he’d had in his shirt pocket. And—

I remembered what Rachel had told me in the kitchen. Fuck. She’d been writing horrible things about Eddie. He was covered in bruises and our baby was dead and she was the only one covered in blood. 

“Detective, listen to me. Eddie is *not* what he seems* He is a fucking psychopath! He killed our boy! And he killed Tansy Whitman!”

“Sir, you need to calm down.” I saw the Mirana officer’s hand move toward his belt. 

“He fucking set this up—I’m telling you. He’s a conniving little—“

—Nine year old. This was all insane. A nightmare. And he was still their victim. Because I’d said nothing when it mattered. Because he was my son. 

—

“You look poorly, Paul. Have you been sleeping?”

“Not well, Doc. My wife’s in prison and my son is dead and Eddie is a serial killer.”

“You’ve been drinking…”

“Fucking hell. They teach you everything at Oxford, don’t they?”

“Paul. I understand you’re going through a traumatic event, that this is all very difficult on you and Eddie—“

“There is no me and Eddie. My only son is dead. And when CPS finishes their investigation or whatever, I don’t want the other one back.”

“Now Paul, that is—“

“Nah. I don’t care. I just want your notes from Eddie’s sessions. He must’ve said something—done something—and right now my wife needs that.”

Doctor Foster sighed, eased his posture into a patronizing silent ‘no.’  He was like everyone else—dismissive of the crazy notion that a child could kill. But I’d been reading. I had nothing but time between my conversations with liquor bottles. Eddie wasn’t the youngest killer out there, he was just more controlled than the others. He lied better. Fit in better. But perhaps with Doctor Foster he had been more candid. Less guarded with a man who he knew would keep his secrets. 

“Did he tell you something, Doc?” I tried to read him. My eyes, full of bleary, trackless scorn against his—piteous and measured. “Huh? Some little fucked confession? Something?”

“Paul, I cannot comment on my conversations with Eddie or any of my patients. You know that. But it might help you to talk about your other son. Cooper.”

I would not cry in front of this man. 

“Fuck that.”

“Untended grief can be a cancer, Paul.”

“Eddie is a cancer! And *you*—you were supposed to fucking diagnose him! But you fucking failed and now, my son’s blood is on your hands too!”

Another sigh to match my untethered rage. Prick. 

“Perhaps if you journaled your true feelings. It might—“

“Your journals put my wife in a cell. What about Eddie’s journal? I didn’t find it. He hides it. Why would he do that? Why? What do you fucking know?”

He had a pack of fresh journals on his desk. Another in front of him among his tidy collection of pompous little trinkets. I’d brought mine with me out of habit. It was almost empty. And a moment later, I pulled it out and tossed it onto the desk. 

“You wanna read mine, doc? Maybe you can see how I feel. We could have a heart to heart. Grab a beer. And you can tell me how it’s not so fucking bad.”  

He sat motionless. I wanted him to cower. To feel my anger. I had felt like pummeling him so many times, just because I didn’t like him. Now, I might’ve hated him. I hated Eddie. I hated myself. I needed Rachel. I missed my son. 

“He’ll kill again. You know that right?”

“Paul, why do you think it is that you are the only one who demonizes your son?”

“What?”

“You talk about his behavior issues, but does anyone else see them?  His teachers? His friends’ parents? Anyone?”

“He’s good at hiding it. He’s a pathological liar. An actor.”

“How has he been recently?”

“Nice. Fake.”

“You see that as a ruse, but it was only after we began to discuss abuse—only after confronting that subject—that Eddie changed.”

What the fuck was he getting at? I wasn’t the problem. 

“You love your wife, Paul?”

“Yes.”

“It can be…difficult to reconcile a love of someone with the things they do, particularly where their actions seem unthinkable. Perception can sometimes find a path of least resistance to separate that love from the reality we observe.”

“*No*.” Eddie was the monster. Rachel never touched him. She would never hurt her children. 

“Paul, the reason we have therapists isn’t solely expertise. We are remarkably poor at viewing ourselves objectively.”

“Stop.”

“I really wanted to address this issue more organically than this. Delusional thought processes are such a fragile—“

“SHUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH!”

I was standing, but I hadn’t remembered rising to my feet. My fists clenched, fingernails stinging my palms as my hands vibrated. And all I could think of was Rachel in her navy blue jumpsuit and her orange plastic sandals, staring at me from across a table that was bolted to the floor. She deserved none of it, and I felt like Doctor Foster deserved a broken face, but I didn’t hit him. I snatched my stupid fucking journal off of his desk and I seethed. 

“Fuck you, Doctor. I won’t be back.”

He stared as I left. I slammed the door and swept his happy pamphlets onto the ground. 

—

Crybaby mommy. Quiet daddy for ever. Soft like pillows full of fethers. Pick them one by one. CRY CRY CRY. 

—

Alone, I felt everything that anger tends to hide. Our house was quiet. Rachel’s wind chimes outside, the hiss of a toilet I’d meant to fix, the scrape of a bottle against the coffee table. For so long, quiet is all I’d wanted. But not like this. 

The house still had the imprint of a crime scene investigation. Books and papers askew, a set of muddy footprints across the carpet. I hadn’t been back upstairs except to look for Eddie’s journal. He’d taken down the pillow fort on his bed, stripped off the sheets and shredded each one of his stuffed animals. He’d piled fur and fluff on the center of his mattress. And however many people had gone into his room on the day Cooper died, not one had thought the scene strange enough to second guess Eddie’s traumatized little act. 

I’d been sleeping on the sofa. My work told me to take time. They understood. Hollow words. Fake like Eddie. 

And Cooper…

I just felt empty when I thought of him. I missed his smallness, the way he looked around, wondrous and happy. He died before he could walk. He’d never held my hand to steady his little steps. He would never beg me to chase him around the playground. Eddie took all of that. Rachel had lost that and Eddie took her too. But me—he left. He could’ve told them that I had hit him. But he didn’t. I’m convinced that he left me because he knew that my solitude would be cruelest. 

I didn’t feel like drinking anymore. I was too drunk already and it didn’t help except to pass out and wake miserably just to do it all again. In spite of my feelings about Doctor Foster, my mocking little journal felt like something to try, if only to fill the time. So I searched the mess that my drunken grief had made and found the little blue book between the sofa cushions. It opened at its little red bookmark as I set it down. And I saw a page full of writing. It wasn’t my journal. 

It was Eddie’s. I had missed it. How?

No. Unimportant. 

It was Eddie’s sloppy child’s scrawl I saw and I could finally read the thoughts he’d tried to hide. 

The journal started with a war. It ended with—

&nbsp;

He’d dressed the walls with flesh and clotted blood, carpeted the floor with entrails, bound the bones as beams with sinew and lengths of silky hair. The church’s facade he’d left bare—skeletal white tapering to a pointed spire. Amidst the bloody blankets, it looked almost like a tooth. 

Nameis gazed upon it with awe. He had known beauty of all sorts. He had seen it in the red carnage of war. He had heard it in the screams of his godless captives. But he had never known its perfection until now. 

Nameis the Divine. Eddie the Blessed. Brothers who had beckoned their holy parentage through rites of savagery and devotion, loveliness and pain. Their work was at an end. 

Eddie laid the final pieces of the altar as Nameis watched. He’d chosen skulls and ribs and fingers bones—a many faced idol with curving wings that once held hearts and lovers’ hands. Nameis didn’t need to understand it all to know its worth. He knew the important parts. The altar would bring a sacrifice. The sacrifice would end the war. Their peace would please their god. 

When it was finished, Eddie rested and Nameis waited. 

And waited. And waited. 

Where was their sacrifice? he wondered. Their god?

“Both are already here,” Eddie answered.

But Nameis hadn’t spoken his thought aloud. 

“No thought is as quiet as death, Lieutenant Nameis. Death hears all. The beat of your heart, the flow of your veins, the tick of the time you have left.”

But they were brothers…

“Death stood beside the firstborn of this world. Waiting. Patient. What brother could death have when none were born outside his gaze?”

Nameis thought he understood. The god he awaited was death. And death was Eddie. And Nameis was…

“Both are already here.” Eddie repeated. God and sacrifice. Eddie and Nameis.

And then Nameis saw. The church wasn’t a church. It was a tomb. 

“Yes.”

“But what of the war, Eddie?” Nameis asked aloud. “How does it end?”

“The war remains un-won til only one remains.”

Solemnly, Nameis nodded. There were no more soldiers left to fight the war but he. His death would bring an everlasting peace. He understood that, but he was frightened.

“Will there be pain?” 

“There will be an end.” Eddie answered. “And everything that came before will fade.”

Nameis knew what his faith demanded. He knelt before the altar, before Eddie—his first disciple, his last companion. And as those blessed hands began their final work of artistry, he sang a song for no one but his patient god of 

—

“Paul?”

The voice scared the absolute shit out of me. 

“Wha-what the fuck are you doing in my house?!”

My words slurred as I peeled myself off of the sofa. It took me a moment to get my bearings.

“I’ve been knocking, Paul. You didn’t answer so I tried the door. It was unlocked.”

Doctor Foster stood, hands clasped behind his back, patient prickish concern across his face. He looked fastidious as ever in his camel coat and pressed blue trousers and I knew I looked like shit without needing the comparison. I must have passed out again. I had been drinking. Reading something… *Eddie’s journal*.  

“Where is it?”

“Where is what?” 

“The journal. Nameis and Eddie the god of death and—and the war. It was right—“

I found it on the floor. “Here.”

“God of death?” Incredulous. “Paul…”

“He must have told you, Doc!  You’re so fucking professional. Keeping secrets that killed my—“

I opened the book.  A folded bundle of pages fell from between the blank ones and back onto the floor. *My* writing filled half of a page with half of a thought. It was *my journal*.  But where was—

“*By mid-winter the war was already lost. The soldiers mustered rank and file*—Paul. Is *this* your war? Leftenant Nameis and…Captain Casco?”

He held the creased pages in his hands. 

“That is Eddie’s story! Not mine!”

He looked at the pages for a moment more and then handed them back to me. They were *typed*? But they couldn’t be.  I had seen Eddie’s writing. I had. 

“Paul, Eddie is a bright boy, but he’s nine years old. Look at the writing. It’s beyond his skill.”

No. He was wrong. “Eddie, he—he tricked me, the police. He tricked you too. About the arm. The girl—Tansy. He’s not what he seems, Doc. ”

“I will concede that Eddie’s behavior in our sessions seems a touch…forced.”

“Yes!”

“But he knows that you are taking him to me because there’s a problem. And it’s not unusual for difficult children to be less so in the presence of an outsider. Our relationships are very different things to him.”

No. Why did they always fucking take his side? He was a murderer; he killed my son. I’d seen—I’d seen him walking away with blood on his hands. But that was enough. Rachel wouldn’t hurt Cooper. She wouldn’t. His death had destroyed her. And she—if I had her with me I could confirm the worst parts. If I had her with me I could feel normal. Sane. 

I slumped back onto the sofa. I wanted her. I didn’t want Doctor Foster. Why was he here?”

“Why are you here, Doc?  Why did you come?”

“You’re alone. And your family is broken and believe it or not Paul, I care about your outcome.”  He glanced at the bottle on the table. He wasn’t subtle. “Water might be a good place to start. I’ll get you a glass.”

I murmured my acceptance as he left for the back of our house. 

I wasn’t okay. I knew that. But I didn’t see how okay was going to happen for me. Either my son was a murderer or I was crazy and…my wife was. I unfolded the pages and read again. I barely knew the story. How the fuck could it be mine?  Captain Casco. Lieu—

*Lef*tenant. 

Doctor Foster had pronounced it like a Brit. And the day that Cooper died, as we hid in our room and Eddie pounded on the door, Eddie had pronounced it that way too. *Leftenant* Nameis. He’d screamed it through the door and I thought nothing of it because I was trying not to think at all. I stared blankly at the first page of the story, read idly as I parsed the coincidence. 

*Captain Casco had fallen three nights prior but the fighting hadn’t ebbed long enough for an official change in command. If Nameis had stopped for his moment of self congratulatory pomp, it would have been for his honour alone.* 

Honour. 

Like a Brit. I hadn’t written it… Doctor Foster had, and Eddie—Eddie must’ve copied it down. *Leftenant*. Eddie couldn’t have read a pronunciation on a page. Had Doctor Foster read it to him? A story about the beauty of violence and a boy named Eddie who became a god of death. Where was Foster?

“Doc?”

He didn’t answer. I stood and stumbled toward the kitchen. 

“Doctor Foster?”

He wasn’t there. The glass of water was. Sitting next to the sink. Where would he have gone?  The backdoor was locked. Perhaps the bathroom? The pantry?  My eyes roved toward the bathroom door first, brushed over the kitchen island, followed a habit, counted the knives. 

One too few. *Fuck*.

“Paul?”

I spun around at the sound of his voice and the creak of the pantry door, I saw the metal in his hand. He stepped, I reacted, reached for his hand, missed and grabbed the blade as he lurched toward me. I expected pain—something sharp. I winced reflexively. But as my hand squeezed, I felt *a handle*.  Doctor Foster had been holding the blade. 

And his blood now coated it as I pulled back the knife.

“Paul—you—“

He stumbled back. Reached in his pocket for his phone. 

But—No. 

“Hello? I need help. I’ve been stabbed by a patient.”

He was holding the blade. He wrote the story. He—

“—Fernhill Lane. His name is Paul George.”

Not me. I didn’t do anything wrong. He planned it; made me stab him. 

Each truthful word I thought to say echoed like a lie. They wouldn’t believe me. I knew that. And they didn’t. And they still don’t. 

The doctors at Clinton Mental Health Corrections Center, the orderlies, the patients. None of them believe a word of it. But I know the truth now. Eddie is a psychopath. He’s just good at hiding it because session after session he sat in a side room of an office and learned to lie from a man just like him. A psychiatrist who recognized his reflection in Eddie’s eyes and then groomed him to kill. I know that’s right. It’s the simplest explanation. 

Doctor Foster was the one who convinced them to let me keep the story of Lieutenant Nameis and the boy. (Complete with Eddie’s psychotic ramblings in the margins). He said it would help me distinguish between the written fantasy and reality. Prick. 

He took my son, my wife, our freedom. Everything. And he left me with a shitty computer and limited online time in the aging library of a loony bin. And he left me a story because it was always about him—Nameis who taught a boy how to kill. Nameis whose task was only ever to destroy. 

Well, I used the computer to write, to remember as much as I can about the truth. I posted it here hoping that someone would believe me. Rachel believes me. She tells me during our phone calls and I tell her that I still love her, that I need her like she needs me. But I don’t tell her about the fear. I don’t tell her about the visits. I keep quiet about my Saturdays, when in the afternoons, I look out the window and see them standing in the shade of a maple tree, looking back at me. Smiling. 

Foster and Eddie.
