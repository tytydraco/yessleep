There are sometimes bizarre events in a person’s life which forever go unexplained. They tend to linger in the mind as sort of hunger, or an unscratchable itch. For the past 30 years, there has been an incident which has been gnawing at me; one that to this day, I have not been able to put to rest. I’ve had temporary moments of escape, as well as times which I have not thought about the incident, but the memories always find a way to reach me. I wanted to share my story with all of you, out of the hopes that someone will be able to give me any kind of information as to what I may have encountered all those years ago. My name is Lucas Anderson.

I grew up in the small town of Westbridge, located in the western most part of Massachusetts. My whole childhood was overall, uneventful, as I didn’t have too many neighbors around me and there was nothing interesting within about an hours drive from the town. The whole place seemed sort of stuck in time, and I doubt it's changed much since I left. There were a good amount of farms in the area alongside a vast expanse of woods which covered the gentle slopes of the neighboring mountains.  As for its history, Westbridge first started out as a small settlement, whose population was mainly Catholic, European immigrants that weren’t welcomed by the puritans of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. We had only one major church in the town that was constructed around the year 1900, close to Mount Burlock; one of the largest mountains in the area. There were earlier churches built in the area, but they had been previously destroyed.  

My parents made sure that we went to church every Sunday and got me and my siblings involved in every parish event possible. As a child, I  hated having to wake up early on Sundays, but I had some fun helping out at events because my closest friend, Adam, would always be there. I spent a lot of my early childhood with him going around town on our bikes, sometimes for hours, pretending that we were knights or wizards embarking on dangerous quests. We basically just went to the local convenience stores to buy junk food. Adam and I would sometimes lie and say that we were just going to ride around the neighborhoods, when we would actually venture out a lot further, going so far as to the secluded woods near mount Burlock. For us, there was no greater adventure than navigating and unfamiliar wood, where even our forefathers never dared lay any road or trail. One day however, we got an adventure that was much more than we originally bargained for. 

Adam and I were both ten years old. He was visiting my house when I got the idea to take our bikes down to the woods. He was hesitant at first, but I eventually convinced him. My mom was busy trying to clean the kitchen so it didn’t take much to convince her. 

“Hey where are you two going?” She asked peeking her head around the kitchen door 

"We’re just gonna ride our bikes for a while!” I shouted, already with one step out the front door 

“Alright, but don’t go too far and be back before 7.” 

Adam and I chuckled quietly to ourselves as we peddled down my street, racing to see who can get to the end the fastest. When we got onto the main road we were met with a sign that read: “mount Burlock, 3 miles.” 

When Adam and I reached the dense tree line, we decided to bring our bikes along, since neither of us owned a bike lock, and rested them against a tree with a noticeable chip in its bark. We played the same games that we usually did, mostly seeing who can climb the tallest tree, and sword fighting with the largest sticks we could find. When Adam and I were lucky enough to come across a small brook, we would throw stones into it and see who could make the largest splash. Before we knew it, the sun was starting to set and my digital watch read 6:30 pm. I told Adam we should leave, and he just said “alright.” We looked at each other for a little bit, both puzzled. 

“Well. Lead the way” I said, waving my hands at Adam.

“What do you mean? I thought you were keeping track of direction”

“No, that was your job, you brought that compass with you right?”

“Wasn’t it  *you*  that called the compass stupid?”

This exchange went on for some time, until we both just gave up. Adam and I agreed which direction we were mostly likely to have come from and started our long way back. The minutes ticked by and there was still no sign of the road or even our bikes. I began to panic a little when I glanced at my watch and saw that it was now 7 pm. I could hear the bell of our church ring out five times, as it did every hour. The noise was soft and muffled by the dense surroundings of the forest. I looked at Adam.

“Do you hear that? We must have been going the wrong way! The Church bell sounds like it's miles away.\`\` He yelled at me 

“ Just trust me for once. This has to be the right direction.”

And so, we walked on. As the light shining through the trees began to dissipate we picked up our pace and began to jog. Soon, all of our surroundings became shrouded in darkness and the forest became even more foreign to us. The beautiful maple trees now loomed over us as pitch black giants reaching out with heavy limbs to cover us from even the smallest shred of moonlight. Adam stopped for a moment. As we tried to catch our breaths, he pulled out a small flashlight from his backpack and turned it on. It gave off a tiny bit of light, but it was almost completely useless. As he motioned the light around, the tiny beam landed on a tree. I recognized it, the large piece of bark was missing from its side. Adam and I ran towards the tree. I was almost able to let out a laugh, but it was cut short by what I saw. The bikes weren’t there. We both wildly spun around in different directions, frantically checking to see if we had the wrong tree by mistake. There was no mistaking it. It had to be that tree. In my frantic search, Adam stopped me. 

 “What time is it?” He asked partially, still out of breath. 

 “8:50” I responded, surprised with the words that came out of my own mouth.

“8:50?! Why didn’t we hear the  bell when it struck 8? How far away are we?”

 I tried to keep my composure, but I could hardly hear what Adam was saying over the pounding of my heart.

“L… Let's just wait until 9.” I responded. “I bet we just didn’t notice the bell strike before. At 9, we’ll listen for the sound, and  head in that direction until we reach the church.” 

Adam turned off his flashlight and the next few minutes were agonizing, as we waited in the pitch black forest. I hadn’t noticed before, but it was completely still, there was barely any draft, and I couldn’t make out so much as a cricket’s chirp. The piercing silence was broken by a metallic thud. Adam and I rejoiced for a moment, realizing that we can’t be too far from the Church. Looking back, there was something off about the sound. The church bell is low with a few seconds of silence in between each of its strikes. This sound was much higher in pitch and the time between strikes was inconsistent. Adam and I didn’t care, we ran towards the noise, trying to cover as much distance as we could before losing it. When the noise stopped, I decided to climb a tree to see if I could find the church steeple peeking out from the dark canopy. Adam helped give me a boost, and I was able to find my way up the tree by feeling around for the sturdiest branches. I finally reached the top, and to my dismay, the church steeple was nowhere in sight. There was nothing besides the ever present shadow of mount burlock, which now stood in front of me as the figure of a looming giant. 

“Are we close?” Whispered Adam from the base of the tree. 

“N….No.” I responded hesitantly. “ I don’t see anything. The church must be on the other side of the mountain.” 

“What?! That’s impossible! We couldn’t have gone that far!” 

“ Wait…I think I see something.” 

 In the distance, I could make out at least twelve or fourteen lights peeking out through the trees. Dim, and flickering, they were slowly ascending up the mountain.

“What is it?” asked Adam 

“I think it’s the police, or someone from town looking for us. Our parents are gonna be so pissed dude.” 

We tried getting their attention with the flashlight, but that didn’t seem to be working. The lights were still moving up the mountain. Adam and I started to yell in desperation, praying that our cries could be loud enough for our rescuers to hear. For a minute, It looked to be working. But then we noticed something that took us by surprise. One by one, the lights went out; all of them. We both stood in silence again trying to make sense of our situation. 

The stillness of the forest was suddenly broken by a strange noise. It was a soft rustling. I could tell it wasn’t close, so I figured it was just the wind brushing through the leaves. It was then I remembered that there hasn’t been even the slightest breeze since we first entered the forest. The noise was growing louder, as was the beating of my heart. Standing at the tallest point of the tree, I could see in the distance that bushes and small trees were bending and breaking, as some figure was tearing its way toward us.

 I screamed for Adam to run without even considering how I would get myself down. I tried to make my way down the branches as fast as possible, but I knew it was hopeless as the rustling of branches turned into what sounded like a heavy, uneven gallop. I stayed in the tree, pressing my face against the rough bark, praying that whatever was making its way towards me would just move along. The gallop came to an immediate halt. It was right beneath the tree and I dared not look down. For about a minute, there was complete stillness, as I held my breath and desperately recited prayers in my head. Eventually, whatever was beneath me began to shuffle its way back into the brush. I just hoped Adam was able to get far enough away that the thing couldn’t find him. After a few more agonizing minutes, I made my way down the tree. Then, without a thought in my head, I ran past the point of exhaustion. I ran as fast as my legs could carry me, scraping my skin on all of the sharp sticks and thorns that protruded from every direction. I ran without any aim, just hoping that somehow, I would make it out of this labyrinth. 

I don’t know how long I was in those woods, but eventually, I made it out onto a road, but that didn’t slow me down. Neither did the flashing of police cruisers nor the faces of concerned bystanders. I only stopped because one of the officers grabbed me. I don’t remember any of this, but I am told that I passed out from exhaustion and landed myself in the hospital. 

When I awoke, both of my parents were sitting next to me. They were just happy that I was mostly unscathed, save for a few nasty cuts and bruises. Thankfully, Adam was safe as well. The police had found him not long after me. In the following years, this story became a sort of urban legend that Adam and I fueled. We would tell the other kids in the town about the strange lumbering beast that lived near the mountain. For the first month however, this experience deeply shook me, and it was a long time before I could get a full night's sleep. Sometimes I could feel my eyelids getting heavy, and just as I was drifting off, I heard the odd gallop thundering in my ears, and I was always shot awake with the church bell ringing through my window.
