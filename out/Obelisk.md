I live in a nothing town, or rather, I used to. Days would pass by without so much as a hint of extravagance and would barely pass the mundane.

My days would be enveloped in tedium, not monotony, as that implies there is content within the repetition, no, I loathed the wash, the rinse, and then the repeat of each day that was always destined to remain the same. I would wake up and get ready for my day, shower, eat, then leave for my daily walk to work.

I would pass several houses and small businesses, then come to an array of fields, each one as empty as the last, not even livestock nor a hay-bale in sight. But that day the air felt different, before it felt as if the air I was breathing was the exact same as yesterday’s, devoid of pressure change or any semblance of a scent to carry across the wind, but today it wasn’t the same, today my lungs filled and felt as if they twice as heavy.

It became laborious to walk that day, I wasn’t breathless, on the contrary I felt too full of air, it just felt like I was wading through water, or cautiously through a dense fog, and once I got to the fields, I knew why.

Over the hedging and across the almost barren land I’d become all too familiar with stood something, frankly, outstanding. A giant, jagged, ominous structure seemed to be piercing through the ground, as ever present as a splinter from rotten wood, it emanated an energy that I connected to my unsettling morning, not that I understood how, or why, but it was the fault of this thing.

It wasn’t long before the powers that be descended onto the object, armed with humvee’s and military presence to contain it and bring along the brightest minds to work on it, that’s what I would guess anyway.

I would be lying if I said I wasn’t curious about it, who wouldn’t be? But I was more annoyed because of both the attention it brought to my otherwise unsightly town and because of its disruption to my life, I couldn’t walk to work how I normally do so I had to leave earlier to make sure I wasn’t late, my boss didn’t even care about my extenuating circumstance which only fuelled my distain, but I bit my tongue in hopes of some sort of revelation.

And along it came.

Without much update for a while, the government had finally revealed that the ‘Obelisk’, as they called it, did not have any supernatural properties besides a low and barely registrable hum which explained away my feelings that day it arrived. It all felt too simple in the end but I didn’t mind because as fast as they arrived, all the crowds had dispersed.

Naturally there were skeptics and religious nutcases alike, but I didn’t care, they never got in my way, so why should I? Life went on.

Then one day on my way to work, I saw one of the worshippers stood almost as if they were guarding something, it didn’t do much good in an open field but as I stepped up to investigate I was met with a figure in my line of sight and a stern word to keep back. I didn’t want a fuss before I had to start a shift so I did as instructed and chose to watch from afar, obviously I didn’t see much but as I turned to leave I felt… something. Like a small part of my soul went cold and all of a sudden had ceased to exist, there wasn’t any pain, but instead a sinking feeling beyond true description. It was then that I decided to go back later and investigate myself.

That night after work I went back to the Obelisk long after the borderline cultists had left, I needed to see if there was anything that would tell me what they were up to. I sauntered over the coarse ground near the structure and with each step felt a growing pressure inside me, but I couldn’t tell if it was pushing in, or out. I suppose this is what those lunatics mistook for the divine.

I got increasingly more uncomfortable the closer I got, and yet I couldn’t resist extending my hand to the thing, something akin to static electricity building between my fingertips and its craggy surface, and once I pressed down, all at once I felt relief, my problems washed away, all sense of pain was gone, I didn’t want or need anything, I just…was.

I found myself face down in my kitchen moments later. Nothing was amiss, not a spoon or a leftover crumb out of place, my keys were where they always were and there wasn’t so much as a bruise on my body, and it left me with so many questions.

How did I get here?

Did anyone bring me home?

If I clearly wasn’t hurt, then what was this ache?

I chose to ignore what had happened, or maybe my mind didn’t want me to remember, but it was difficult with the constant reminder that was left across my chest, the ache. I got up and left for work as normal, passed all the houses and the locally owned corner shops on my usual route to work, nothing was out of the ordinary, except there was a crowd of cultists waiting at the edge of the field instead of worshipping the Obelisk, like they were waiting for me.

They didn’t speak to me, nor did I say anything to them, but they were almost inspecting me, for what reason, I wasn’t sure.

I went about my day as usual until my break, I grabbed my food, and went to buy a drink from the vending machine when one of my coworkers tapped my on the shoulder asking if I was okay with a hint of concern in their voice, I didn’t know what they meant until I realised it was almost time to leave and I was facing the wall, where I had supposedly been for hours.

This wasn’t real right? I can’t be losing that much time in an instant? What is going on with me? Why me?

All questions that were buzzing around in my head as I left for home, my head was a cluster of curiosity and fear until it just went away, it took me aback so I stopped dead in my tracks, and before I could begin to puzzle why my mind was suddenly so clear, I realised, I was now stood right next to the Obelisk, with a cultist gently guiding me closer to it, I was filled with panic and screamed for them to let me go.

I ran home, hoping and praying that I wasn’t followed as I barged into my front door. After a brief moment to compose myself I made sure to eat something because I wasn’t sure if I had eaten my lunch at all, despite not feeling hungry, and went to bed.

I almost hoped I lost more time then and there because this ache became more prevalent, I was restless and uncomfortable, not knowing what to do in the pitch black of my room until I was blinded by light, as I was attempting to adjust and get a grip of my surroundings it dawned on me that I no longer felt the ache, I felt empowered and ironically well rested despite my previous insomnia and as I came to, I looked around to see I was in an empty field surrounded only by dry grass and a slight breeze.

Then all at once, the ground ruptured beneath me, splitting like glass after being struck, cracking in all directions that was seemingly arbitrary but came to settle in a beautiful symmetry leaving me awestruck, and in the centre of it all was…that thing, an obnoxious juxtaposition to the certainty of its surroundings, the mysterious and unnatural Obelisk claiming to be of this Earth.

And yet in all my anger and confusion, I wanted to know what it was, I inched closer feeling the weight slowly be lifted from my chest yet again and the dread being seeped from my pores until all that remained was one burning question in my mind.

What are you?

I got my answer as I finally placed my hand on it once again and felt this massively dense object give way to my palm, and I fell. I saw it all, my past, what choices led to what outcomes in my life, and finally what was yet to come for me. I saw what it wanted, and I saw what it needed of me. I didn’t intend to be, but I was ready, I was chosen, I was next in line, it was me who was to be its vessel, I felt complete.

So I woke up in my bed, nothing was amiss, not a crumb out of place and not a noise that was new or unheard of. I got ready for my day, I showered, ate and left my house like any other day, breathing in the same air that I had every day, and that’s when I ran into you, you with your inquisitive mind and curious nature.

Take my hand, I have something to show you.
