It wasn’t unusual that I’d found myself stumbling down an alleyway at 3am with no recollection of the last four hours.

After all, it was the night of my work’s Christmas party. So, clearly I had a little too much to drink.

It was unusual, however, that I didn’t feel drunk. My head wasn’t spinning. I didn’t feel sick or dizzy, and I couldn’t taste barf in the back of my throat. I just felt…. Fuzzy. Like I was dreaming. In fact, I’d came to sort of dancing, leaping across cracks in the sidewalk, the sound of my click-clacking heels fully bringing me to fruition.

Maybe I was so drunk I was sober. And that was a thing. My 21st had been one of the rare times I’d somehow drunk myself sober. Not a good time. I spent most of the next day with my head grossly stuck down the toilet. But again, in this instance, I didn’t feel drunk. I felt weirdly happy. Which didn’t make sense because I had no idea what the fuck I had been doing for the last 4 hours.

That is what I told my housemate —who I was sure was half asleep. I could faintly hear the video game he was playing in the background.

“So, you’re not drunk,” Nick mumbled. His Aussie accent dripped from every word, far more defined when he was dozing off. “But you’re also not sober.”

“Exactly.” I said.  “So, how’d I get here, huh? The party was halfway across the city.”

“Dunno.” Nick yawned. “Maybe you like… sleep walked? I mean, you’re drunk.”

“No, that’s what I’m trying to say,” I said. “I didn’t drink anything.”

“Huh.” Nick paused. “Well, that’s kinda fucked up.”

“Right?” I kicked a pebble, sucking in a breath. “Hey, can you—”

“No.”

He was suddenly wide awake.

“But I…”

God, it was cold. Biting my lip against a hiss, I wrapped my jacket tighter around myself.

“You were going to ask me to pick you up,” Nick sighed. “And after last time, it’s a solid no. My seats still smell like barfy taco bell.”

I knew he was going to bring up The Taco Bell Incident at some point. That was dangerous territory since Nick was a sucker for his car. I had lost count of how many times I had apologized to him, and then to his stupid car—even the seats themselves.  But no such luck. The damn thing had happened nearly five months ago, and it was almost Christmas. 

The guy could hold one hell of a grudge.  In that particular mood, I had no filter. I could have brought up the fact that it was Kit who had bought me the taco, so technically, it was his fault. And adding more salt, I could have added that Rory’s projectile vomiting out of the window had triggered me too. There were many things I could have said about our first experience with insane food poisoning. But every time I mentioned it, Nick reverted to having the mind of a five year old.

So, I changed the subject.

“It’s cold.” I said, when I couldn’t think of anything else to say.

He hummed in response. “Please tell me you’re wearing a jacket. Rory freaked out earlier when she realised you’d left your scarf.”

I smiled a little. “She acts like our mom.”

“You weren’t here earlier,” he chuckled. “I thought she was possessed. Seriously. Are you wearing a proper coat?”

Almost home. “Relax.” I said, “I’m wearing my fluffy parka.” That was a lie. Instead, I had stupidly opted for my sherpa. It was cute in the summer and useless in the winter.  Opening my mouth to try and protest my innocence when I could practically hear his eyes rolling, I came to an abrupt stop, the breath catching in my throat. I don’t know why I suddenly felt on edge. Like I was being watched from every direction. The feeling came thick and fast, a wave of confusion mixed with fear slamming into me, chasing away delirium. 

I glimpsed a man a few feet ahead, and for a moment it looked like he was standing still, his gaze glued to me. The guy looked to be in his late thirties, maybe forties. 

He was dressed casually and held a phone to his ear. I found myself unable to tear my eyes from his face half in shadow. Because I knew him. Somehow. It was vague, just a splinter of something brewing, nothing concrete.

I watched him for a moment hearing his voice in a low grumble. “Are the kids awake?” The man said before turning away from me, continuing in long strides. He must have been talking to his wife. Still though, it had looked like he’d been staring at me for a moment. He hadn’t been looking past me, or maybe checking the road for cars.  

No, that couldn’t have been it.  Because there were no cars. It was the middle of the night, and I was the only person besides him.

“Ally, are you still there?”

Nick snapped me out of it, his sleepy murmur a welcome distraction. I choked on my reply, thoughts caught in a whirlwind, replaying what I had seen over and over again in my head.  

The man had been looking directly at me. But I wasn’t sure. The more I thought about it, had he been looking behind me, maybe? That could have been it. If he was meeting someone…. My thoughts trailed off. It was 3am. Who would he be waiting for?  I was paranoid, I thought. Surely. Shaking away bad thoughts which started to blossom in the back of my head, I quickened my steps. I was suddenly glad I’d rang Nick. 

Even if he was barely awake, my housemate provided that much needed comfort. In the distance, I watched the man cross the road, his silhouette disappearing behind a street corner. Blowing out a relieved breath, I pressed my phone to my ear. “Yeah?” Keeping my focus on the road ahead, I didn’t dare look back. “Sorry. I had a brain blank. What were we talking about?”

“Your coat.” Nick said, completely oblivious as usual. “I said you’ve left your parka here. It’s the pink one, right? I did the laundry earlier.”

He paused for dramatic effect. “Which is your only warm coat. Soo…”

Well, shit.

“You’re dead tomorrow morning,” he murmured, “My condolences.”

“Not if I can escape before she gets up,” I countered. I could tell Nick was ready to argue like always, so I volleyed the subject again.

“I don’t suppose you could keep me company.”

My housemate yawned again. “Not to be a buzzkill, but weren’t we supposed to… you know… as a four?”

I knew what he meant automatically, my cheeks heating up. “I mean now! While I’m walking home.”

“Oh.”

“So, what game are you playing?”

“Uh, Modern Warfare.”

“The one with the zombies?”

That got a spluttered laugh out of him. “Don’t they all have zombies?”

Instantly, I changed my mind. 

Nick was insufferable. 

"Are the others around?”

A loud groan in the background suspiciously sounded like Kit. Nick cleared his throat. “Sort of.”

“Passed out?”

“Almost. I feel like we’re in the afterglow of the night, you know? A few beers, and now we’re chilling.”

Shivering, I wrapped one arm around myself. “And you’re not going to fall asleep?”

“Nah,” he said. “I’m fully awake. You have my complete, undivided attention.”

Ironically, Nick fell asleep after several attempted conversations which faded out. I pretended to be interested in Call of Duty, but I didn’t know the lore like him. I didn’t know why there were so many games, and why they were all practically a copy and paste. All I knew was that he and Kit were smitten with the franchise.

Which was a weird hyper fixation for two guys in their mid-20’s, though I did enjoy competing against them on games night. They were just first-person shooters to me. I listened to Nick mutter to himself, slamming buttons on his controller, until his grumbles and half threats to opponents on-screen bled into soft snores. 

My phone died ten minutes into listening to his snores getting increasingly louder. I could tell he’d fallen asleep with his head tipped back. Without my phone to settle the knot in my gut, I thought about anything which wasn’t the man I'd encountered, or time I’d lost. I thought about class next morning. I thought about how insanely fucking bright the holiday decorations were, illuminating empty streets. 

The more time I had to think, however, my mind started to question why my dress was split down the leg, and the strange sensation that something was on my hands. I didn’t know what it was--except I wanted to scrub them until my skin was pink. Thoughts grew like a brewing hurricane, and I noticed more and more things which I didn’t want to question. Finally, I reached the end of our road--and I forced myself to think clearly. 

Our house was tucked into a cul-de-sac. It was the cheapest place we could find. Three bedrooms, one bathroom, and a view of the city. Not bad for what we were paying. The neighbors sucked. All of them were middle aged mom’s with kids who asked invasive questions (“Why are two women living with two men? Is that what your generation do these days, Allison? Do you mix it up? Well, when I was your age…”)  I usually shut them up by praising their kids.

Despite annoying neighbours, and not the greatest living conditions, I loved our shared house. 

Like a second family, you know?

It was an awkward Victorian build closed off and private. No garden, so we planted our own.

Rounding the edge of our neighbourhood, I sprung into a run, eager to get out of the cold. When I was running up our steps, a thin layer of frost had gathered on the handrail--and I wondered just how the fuck had I survived for four hours in the bitter cold with barely a jacket. Windows filled with golden light greeted me, and the knot in my gut loosened. The holiday decorations we had spent a whole weekend stringing around our little garden glistened in flashes of blue and red. 

I wanted to spray fake snow on the window, but we had all agreed after contemplating, that it would probably ruin the glass. When I walked through our front door, warmth slammed into me. Not just the heat from the furnace. It was the feeling of being home, basking in lingering smells of burning food from lunch mixed with beer and takeout pizza. Home was the pile of shoes I had to kick through to get through the hallway, and the shoddy carpet leading upstairs—the string of holiday lights taped to battered walls. 

My mom almost had a heart attack when she saw the state of our place. But it was cosy. As long as we took care of the rat problem in the fall—and remembered to wear socks when walking up the stairs. Kicking off my shoes, I headed into the downstairs lounge. Just as I thought, Nick was passed out in probably the most uncomfortable position ever, curled into our ratty couch, his head hanging over the edge. The TV was still on, bathing my housemate in an almost heavenly-like light from the game’s menu screen.

Grabbing the remote, I switched it off, poking him in the forehead. “What happened to not falling asleep?”

He groaned in response, and I pulled off my jacket, flicking on the light.

Nick’s groan deepened into an almost guttural snarl, and he stretched out like a cat. “Can you… not do that."

Ignoring him, I grabbed a half empty coffee mug from the table, wincing at the mess of pizza boxes, books and comics piled on top of each other. Leaning closer to Nick, I blew in my housemate’s face. “What are you doing? Also, can you like, clean up your takeout boxes please?”

Nick didn’t open his eyes. “I’m sleeping.”

“Do you want coffee?”

“Sleeping, Ally.”

“Soda?”

He stuffed his face into the armrest, his words muffling. "I will throw up on you.”

“That’s a threat,” I sang, surveying beer cans in odd places all over the room. “You haven’t drank that much.”

“Uh-huh.” Nick mumbled. “But we did have a jalapeno pizza.” He made a dramatic pause. “And Gochujang sauce.”

I leaned back, pulling a face. The last time Kit used his mother’s special Korean sauce on a meal, I almost died.

Backing down and leaving Nick alone, I tripped over a lump on the floor. And that lump turned out to be a Kit curled up on the rug.

Speaking of….

“Hey.” Gently, I kicked him. We couldn’t afford a carpet so most of our rooms had hardwood floors. Kit must have been freezing.

“Get up,” I said. “Dude, go to bed.”

Kit didn’t respond. So, I grabbed a blanket and threw it over him, prayed he didn’t throw up all over the beaded rug his mom had gotten us, and headed upstairs.

Once I was comfy in bed with the latest Netflix series ready to fall asleep to, there was a loud bang from downstairs, slicing into otherwise peaceful silence. 

It sounded like the door was flying open. Several thoughts hit me at once, and I was out of bed and grasping hold of the nearest thing I could grab--a hardback book--as a weapon. As far as I knew, my three housemates were all inside. So… who had managed to unlock the door? The only ones who knew about the key nestled into a hollow wall near the door were the four of us.

Making sure not to make a sound, I crept down the upstairs hallway.

I could hear footsteps. Muffled voices.

Slowly, I made my way downstairs, my heart trying to catapult out of my chest. I made the stupid mistake of leaving my phone in my room. It was too late to turn back. When I pushed my way into the lounge, I glimpsed a silhouette standing near the bookcase. It was Nick.

But it wasn't my Nick. This Nick was pale and malnourished, practically doubled over in pain, a scowl twisted on his lips. His face was thinner, cheeks gaunt, hollow eyes glued to the couch where my housemate—the real Nick--  was sitting bolt upright, his arms half raised in surrender. For a moment, I thought I was dreaming. My head spun. I was seeing double. I could blame seeing double on a lot of things-- tiredness, maybe psychosis.  

But the two weren't completely identical, no. Because one of them was holding a weapon. It was uncanny valley, like watching a fucking Adult Swim cartoon. 

Two Nicholas Caine’s. Two versions of my housemate. One standing in the corner of the room, something sleek and metal moulded into his hands-- a gun-- and the other blinking rapidly at his own double, his expression unreadable. I had never seen Nick look so… blank. His eyes were wide, but there was nothing there. Like he was completely paralysed both mentally and physically.

The only thing which separated the two was hygiene and clothes. While my Nick wore crumpled t-shirt and jeans, his denim Sherpa awkwardly hanging off his shoulders, the intruder with his face bore a thin, pale blue hospital gown clinging to a wiry frame, his bare feet sinking into the rug. My Nick slowly turned to me, life bleeding into his eyes. While his hair was ruffled, his copy's was overgrown, filthy streaks hanging in dark eyes pinpointed on the two of us. His cheeks were smeared with dirt, a scar cutting through his upper lip. The intruder with Nick’s face spat on the floor, his gaze flicking to me, and then Nick. "I'm not dreaming, right?" My housemate whispered in a hiss. 

I took one shaky step forwards, and the intruder seemed to stiffen up, his finger dancing on the trigger. From the look on his face, the way the weapon melded into his flesh, he knew exactly how to use it. My Nick slowly got to his feet. "Are you seeing this too?” He spoke in a splutter.

“Because I’m seeing double, man. I think… I think I’ve gone fucking crazy.”

Intruder Nick kept the gun trained on us. He lifted his head, his gaze finding something--- or someone—behind me.

“Get a chair.” I don’t know why I was surprised the intruder had my housemate’s voice too. He was a perfect imitation, and yet I could also see splinters in where pieces of this inhuman entity which had stolen my housemate's face shined through. There was a jelly like substance coating his forehead. And when I was slowly drinking him in, I glimpsed strange marks on his arms, raw lacerations on his wrists. His voice, while still perfectly mimicking Nick’s tone and accent, I noticed a robotic-like drone. 

The same went for his expression. There was a certain lack of emotion he was trying to hide. As if he had read my mind, the intruder cleared his throat loudly.  “Four chairs. We need ‘em tied up.”

Real Nick’s voice was the complete opposite, a breathy hiss. He slowly lowered his hands. 

“We… we didn’t do anything.”

He blinked, like he was accepting reality. Accepting his gun-wielding replica.

“Shut up.” Intruder Nick clicked the safety off, and my housemate’s arms shot up once again.

With a simple flick of his wrist, the gun was pointing at me, and I raised my arms too. The replica gestured to the kitchen with his gun.

“Chairs.” He said. “Now.”

“Right.”

Rory’s voice came from behind me, icy cold breath tickling the nape of my neck. But when I risked turning around, I was met with a replica of her. Like Nick, she looked like Aurora James. I mean, sort of. 

The girl perfectly mimicked her face, but everything else was... wrong. 

She wore the same hospital gown which was practically drowning an almost skeletal figure. Her arms were battered and bruised, those same cutting lacerations on her wrists. 

The Intruder wearing my best friend’s face peered at me through thick strands of familiar dark hair glued to pasty cheeks, which clearly hadn’t been washed in a while. While my housemate's smile was always bright and smiley, her copy’s lips were twisted into an almost maniacal grin. I didn't notice the copy was holding a knife to Kit's throat until she shoved him violently forwards.

“What’s going on?”

His eyes were wide with almost childlike fright, hands shaking at his sides. “I don’t… I don’t understand what’s happening.”

Kit was the baby of our household. Even if he was only one year younger than Nick, Rory, and I.

I guess you could call him the quiet but level-headed one.

“We’re okay.” Nick reassured him in a disbelieving laugh. “We’re just… tripping right now,” he nodded to himself. “Yeah. Tripping.”

Kit and I were forced to our knees by Replica Rory, before she headed into the kitchen to grab four chairs. The copy placed them in the middle of the lounge, back to back before tearing off the Christmas lights on our tree, entangling them around her own wrists and pulling them, a knot between her brows. She was assessing their strength. I really didn’t like where this was going. While Replica Rory hunted for makeshift restraints, another shadow stepped into the doorway. 

At this point, I wasn’t surprised when I glimpsed Kit’s doppelganger. I was half expecting it after already coming face-to-face with two perfect mimics of my housemates. Kit’s was just like the others. His handsome face was bruised and battered, striking asian American features half-hidden behind a mane of dark red curls. Somehow, his face was more defined on the copy. Like I was looking at a clearer version of my housemate. 

Standing in the same hospital gown which was split at the shoulders and splattered in crimson stains, Intruder Kit looked significantly worse than the others. The same emotionless eyes held mine, a twisted smile on his lips, but there was something clumsily wrapped around his head. It looked like a bandage. All three of them had that same goo-like coating glistening over their skin. I thought the Nick lookalike was the leader, but from the look on his face, and the way the other two reacted to him, it was in fact Kit. “Alright,” He spun a pen-blade between his fingers, mouth edging into a scowl.  “Where’s Rory?”

Unlike Kit, his replica was in complete control. When none of us answered, he said it again. Louder. “Where the fuck is Rory?”

“We don’t know,” Kit said, hissing when Replica Rory jabbed the handle of her knife into the back of his throat. “I don’t think she came home.”

I caught Nick’s expression twitch. We were thinking the same thing. Kit was lying, of course he was. He wanted Rory to get away, to get help.

Nick’s double strolled forwards. “Last Summer, there was a storm,” he said. “Rory is scared of lightning, so if I’m not mistaken…”

He disappeared into the kitchen, and a familiar squeak sounded out, followed by a cry.

Rory.

The real Rory.

But my housemate being caught wasn’t what sent slivers of ice sliding down my spine. This thing didn’t just have Nick’s face. It had his memories. I remembered that day in clarity. After a long summer of intense heat scorching my back, a storm had finally hit-- complete with lightning. Rory was terrified, and she'd disappeared for hours. Kit found her curled up under the kitchen table like a cat. Except cats don’t fall asleep with their Nintendo switch, halfway through an intense Pokémon battle. 

It didn’t make sense to me that this replica had been fitted with my housemate’s life. Everything he had known from birth to present. The copy had seen it too. I wanted to know how exactly a man-made copy of a person could also retain its memories, splinters of its consciousness. 

But I stayed quiet. Knowing that this was a twisted version of Nick, I kept my mouth shut. Rory, who was paralysed with fear, was dragged into the lounge. While Rory’s double’s eyes were shining with manic glee, my friend was barely responsive, almost trancelike. The two Rory’s were easy to tell apart. The intruder looked like she had been dragged through a bush, while the real version wore bright pink pyjamas, her dark hair in tangled plaits. Replica Kit took centre stage. He waved his knife at us, his eyes challenging us to fight back. The copy pointed to the chairs. “Sit down, or Nick blows your fucking brains out.”

This Kit seemed a lot more energetic than the other two. I eyed the bandage spattered red, still wrapped around the back of his skull. Or maybe he had a head injury. He grabbed a slice of pizza from the table and bit into it. “I’m not playing around!” The thing sputtered through a mouthful. He came to kneel in front of his original, reaching out and sliding the knife of his blade across my housemate's cheek. I caught a certain mania, a glitter of insanity, in eyes which were different to the others. Intruder Kit seemed a little more… unhinged than his partners.

“Kit.” Replica Nick shot him a look. “Too much.”

“Agreed.” Replica Rory grabbed a cookie and took a bite, spraying crumbs. She made a face, spitting out the cookie. “You’ve seen too many movies.”

“And in those movies, threats work.” Replica Kit rolled his eyes. He straightened up.  “Sit.” He pointed at the four chairs. “Now.”

To my surprise, Nick nodded. He lowered his hands before plonking himself down in a chair. After a disorienting second, I followed, forcing my legs to move. I sat down stiffly. 

Kit hesitated before jumping to his feet and dragging Rory along, the two of them taking the final two seats. I let Replica Rory pin my arms behind my back, restraining my wrists with tinsel and Christmas lights. When Rory’s double knelt in front of me, I spat out the question which had been driving me crazy, tangled on my tongue. “Is there…” I stammered over my words, biting back a cry when she tightened the restraints around my wrists, blinding me to the chair, before ducking and doing the same to my ankles.

“Is there one of you?” Replica Rory finished for me, her hands moving in twitching movements. She raised her head with a smile.

“Of course there is one of you, Ally.” Her eyes glittered. “Why wouldn’t there be?”

Her words confirmed the existence of a copy of me—but the way she said it. I could almost mistake her tone for sad.

Before I could open my mouth, she was jumping up and moving onto Kit.

“I had a dream similar to this,” Nick said in a sharp breath, knocking his head against mine. “Except… we were all like.. really naked.”

“Nick.” Kit hissed, as his replica pinned his wrists to the chair’s armrests. “Shut up.”

I think Nick was in shock. He tipped his head back, chuckling. “Wait, are you blushing, Kit? Jesus, man. You’re blushing aren’t cha?”

“Our replicas are holding us at gun point,” Kit spoke through his teeth, struggling in his chair. “Can you please try take this more seriously?”

Nick laughed in response. “You’re blushing. I knew it.”

“I know what this is,” Rory said. “I sent my saliva to 23 And Me a few years ago. This is the result of that, right? They cloned me.”

“But there’s three of us.” Nick said. “Four, if Ally’s is lurking around. How did they get all of our DNA?”

“It’s not 23 and Me.” Kit said softly. “It’s… something else.” He gestured to his own replica. “Look at them. They’re… faulty.”

He was right. The more I looked at the copies, they looked like they were running out of battery. Rory’s kept stumbling, and Kit was self-explanatory. My gaze kept going to him—to the bloody bandage wrapped around his head. I wondered if the injury was a result of something going wrong during his… creation. Questions started to buzz in my mind once again. These things had our faces, our memories. Everything.

What else did they have? Was there anything else left of us to take?

Nick’s replica clapped his hands in front of our faces. He held up a roll of duct tape. “Shut up. The next person who talks gets taped up.”

“Can I just…” Kit spoke up. “Please. Can you tell us what’s going on?”

Nick’s counterpart responded by slapping a strip of duct tape over his mouth.

“Anyone else?” Replica Nick held up the tape. “Seriously, I’ve got a whole roll.”

“Allison.” Kit’s counterpart was tapping his foot impatiently, his gaze on the kitchen door.  “Did you manage to get in?”

And there it was.

My name. Finally.

I know I should have freaked out. And I did. I felt physically sick, fight or flight trying to vault me from the chair.

"Not yet! Michael is a private man.”

My own voice trilled from the kitchen, that same emotionless drone clinging to an otherwise completely normal tone. Before I could register the sound of my own voice, she stepped into the room. Allison Delacroix. Me. My own replica had thrown one of my sweater's over what was left of a hospital scrub-like gown clinging to her. 

My own dark-red hair poked from the hood. Allison took her place with the others. There was something in her expression which I couldn't read. I understood her eyes, hollow, practically derelict. She was an empty shell force fed my memories. Of course she was confused. But there was something else. Allison had emotion. Probably the most out of all of them. Instead of smiling maniacally like Rory, my own copy looked… sad. Like she was going to cry. And I knew exactly how my copy felt.

I knew that knot of pain inside of her chest, that sickening sensation gripping her gut. It was like looking into a mirror. But looking closer at her and really taking in my own copy, I realised she resembled me more than me. Maybe I had been in denial when I had first seen my housemate’s replica’s—but looking at my own, I couldn’t say she didn’t have human emotion.

I couldn’t say that Kit’s replica freaking out wasn’t feeling anger and pain and frustration, Rory’s replica traumatised by her own agony. Whatever they had been through had clearly affected them. These things weren’t aliens or man-made creatures with human faces. They were us. No matter how hard I tried to deny it.

“What do you want?” I found myself asking, directing my question to myself. I couldn’t stand it anymore. I needed answers.

“What do we want?” Kit’s replica rolled his eyes. “Isn’t it obvious?” He nudged the other two. “Are they serious?”

“No.” Kit mumbled through duct tape, glaring at his doppelganger. “No, it’s really not fucking obvious.”

Allison shrugged, her eyes on me. “Don’t blame them,” the girl murmured. “they’ve got no idea.” She turned to Replica Kit and shoved him playfully. I did that a lot. I knew exactly where to hit him on his funny bone to get a reaction out of him. “So, let’s go easy on them, alright?”

“Easy on them?”  Replica Nick scoffed. “They want to know what’s going on? I’ll fuckin’ show ‘em.”

Again, I was seeing it. Human emotion. But it was being suppressed by something, turning his voice into a robotic drone.

Nick’s replica dragged a startled looking Nick to his feet. His wrists were still behind his back, and he stumbled, struggling.

“Get off me!”

Ignoring my housemate, Replica Nick held up the boy’s flailing arm, and yanked up the sleeve of his shirt.

Nick was growing progressively more panicked. “What are you doing? Let me go, asshole!”

“What are you doing to him?” Rory demanded.

Rory’s replica rolled her eyes. “Just watch.” She said. “Jeez, you’re like cockroaches. You won’t sit still and listen.”

“You broke into our house and tied us up,” Rory gritted out. “What do you expect?”

“Well, yeah.” Her replica shrugged. “It was the only way we were going to make you listen.”

I should have had my attention on my housemate managing to untangle his wrists with brute strength. But I wasn’t looking at Nick.

No, I was looking at his replica, who was waving my housemate’s arm in the air like a trophy. There was something black printed under Nick’s elbow. I had never seen it before. At first I thought it was a tattoo, but then I realised I was staring at what looked like the infinity symbol. “Property of Genesis,” The replica read out, unfazed when Nick stopped manically struggling. “Please DO NOT copy. 08/23/21.”

I think it was those words which shattered something inside of me—and questions I didn’t want to ask were finally being answered.

Why did looking at my replica make me feel… wrong? Like it wasn’t her who was mimicking me. My voice, feelings and emotions…

I was the one copying her.

I’m sure you’ll know. It takes a while to fully come to terms with a reality like that. And I wasn’t ready to leave fantasy just yet.

“No.” Nick said in a spluttered laugh. “No, no, no, no, no.”

My heart dove into my throat when my housemate slipped to his knees, peering at his arm with unseeing eyes.  

“Can’t you understand?”  Nick’s replica knelt in front of Nick, prodding him in the forehead. “We’re not you.” He hissed out. “You’re us!”

And just like that my would was splitting open.

Everything I had ever known.

“Don’t pity them.” Kit’s replica snapped. Leaning against the wall, he stabbed at his bandaged head.

“Your existence is draining us. The longer you’re alive, we’re growing weaker without the shit they submerged us in to keep us alive.”

Replica Nick nodded. “You’ve stolen our voices too.” He gestured to Kit. “He doesn’t have long left with half a brain.”

Rory’s copy cleared her throat. 

“I’ll handle this,” she said stiffly. “Eight months ago we were on our way back from the movies, and what we didn’t know is that we were targets. They attacked us, threw us into the back of a van, and took us to a facility in the middle of nowhere.”

Kit continued, pushing off of the wall. “Project Spearhead, an illegal and inhuman experiment trying to replica human DNA. We were the only ones who survived the initial process. So, we became their guinea pigs. If cloning worked on us, what else would? That was their motto.”

“And they struck gold.” Allison joined in. Her eyes found me. “After creating multiple models, which were all faulty, either brain dead or alive without a proper consciousness, they made you.” 

Allison’s lips curved into the slightest of smiles. “You were not perfect at first. They had to drill into you and force you to become us. That stuff you’re made of is sentient flesh. It thinks and feels like a human, but it wasn’t enough for them. They wanted you to think and feel, and essentially become us.  They wanted you to have our memories. Everything we’ve been and will be. And you tried to fight back. This was something they had never seen before—and they didn’t expect you to want to live your own lives and reject their programming.”  

Allison lost her smile. 

“So they used certain methods to make sure you didn’t go back to default."

Replica Nick jutted his chin. “And sold you to an organization run by people who do baaaad things.”

He came to kneel in front of me.

“Are you losing time by any chance?”

My breath caught in my throat, and his smile widened. Like it thrilled him to be right—shattering what I thought was my reality.

He cocked a brow. “Do you want me to tell you what you were doing at 1am?”

I shook my head, pain slicing into the back of my head. I knew exactly what I had been doing at 1am. I was drunk, right?

I was at a party!

“Stop.” Rory’s voice cracked.

My housemate didn’t run. Instead, she lunged for her replica’s throat. Her attack wasn’t clumsy. It wasn’t desperate. Instead, it was like a switch had been pulled. Rory grabbed her copy by the throat, her teeth gritted, tears glistening in her eyes. “Stop talking.” Rory whispered.

Her replica spluttered. “See?” She choked out, her fingernail’s grappling with Rory’s strength. “Just a bad copy.”

Time seemed to slow down, and within those precious seconds when I was trying to gather my breath, trying to breathe, the world exploded around me. Nick was on his feet suddenly, attacking his counterpart. Rory was on the ground, wrapping her arms around her knees, rocking backwards and forwards. 

My housemates were in denial.  And while I wanted to join them, wanted to prove that what these people were saying wasn't true-- I couldn't. A dull pain bloomed at the back of my head, striking in my temples. Their voices grew faded, and I closed my eyes when my vision feathered around the edges. I am not sure how human memories work. They have always come naturally to me without really thinking about them. I already knew about my father—no, Allison’s father’s brain tumour. She had lost him at the age of twelve.

I knew about her dog called PJ, and her graduation ceremony which had ended in tears when Mia Blake called out everyone and their parents for being bullies. Allison had been there, lived through these memories. She had tasted the salty tears on her lips crying for her father and laughed incredulously at her 21st birthday party when her friends had thrown her into Danny Watson's pool. But while I knew about these memories, and knew the backbones of her emotions feeling them... 

I had never felt them for myself. 

So, when my own memories began to surface, it was like coming up for air. 

At first, they were Allison's. I felt her panic, as rough hands grasped hold of her and threw her into the dark, tying her down, needles slicing into her flesh. I waded through her memories until I found my own. They were deep down, suppressed to the very back of my head. But reachable. I was born suffocating in a strange substance streaked with my own blood. I was born with something-- a mask? Strapped to my face. I was born staring through a glass tank at Allison Delacroix's motionless body being carried down a long white corridor. The girl looked dead. But she didn't mean anything to me. I was my own person. I had my own life. 

I remember slamming my fists into the glass, struggling in a prison of slime which tasted and smelled like barf. I didn't stay there long. 

My first word was a name. 

I was going to name myself-- and I was happy with that name. But the look's on their faces, my creators' faces, told me I wasn't allowed my own name. I was going to be Allison.  

They made me into Allison, by strapping me down and slicing into my skull, cutting my brain into pieces, and making sure I felt everything. Making sure I felt their gloved fingers poking and prodding me until her name was forced from my lips. Her consciousness became mine, entangled and suffocating my own until I could no longer feel myself. I could not feel my plastic flesh made to look and feel human. I could only be her. I could only think and act and feel like her. 

I was standing in front of a mirror, and a pretty and petite woman dressed me in a simple black dress. She called me Allison. 

A man came to stand in front of me at my work Christmas party. The same man who had been standing on the street, staring at me. "I've got a job for you," he said. "Don't worry, it won't take long." His gaze flicked to my colleagues doing a clumsy macarena. I wanted to stay with them.

I was having fun.

“I’m sure you won’t be missing anything,” he said. “It’s a simple job. It won’t take a minute. And you’ll have help as always." 

I shook my head.

“I want to stay here.”

His expression contorted, a wide smile twisting into a frown.

“652. Allison Delacroix. you are now activated.”

My world blurred, and I was standing under disco lights. Another party. I had vague memories of moments before. Under their control, I was blending in, talking to party goers, and sipping from holiday cocktails. The voice slammed into me, igniting what was rooted deep inside my skull. At the corner of my eye, Kit stood from where he had been flirting with a girl. 

He started forwards, one hand going under his shirt where a gun was strapped to his jeans, the other slicing the girl's throat with one swift flick of his wrist. Screams erupted. I twisted around, scanning for targets. The names and profiles I had seen during the briefing.  

At the corner of my eye, Nick killed two guards at point black range from where he was standing near the door. “The target is fifty six year old Michael Shriven, who is causing quite some damage right now," The man's voice repeated in my head. "We need him taken care of quickly and quietly,” he said, as I watched the others slaughter the rest of the party goers.  “These people need to disappear overnight with a cover up. Michael Shriven is rumoured to be a whistleblower on the Genesis Project. Check his right pocket.”

“Right pocket?”

Nick was speaking out loud, answering the voice inside our heads. He snapped a struggling man’s neck. “What’s in it?”

“It’s a key-card. Stop asking questions."

Lucky for me, Rory already had Michael in a stranglehold, wrapping his tie around his neck. I reached to my leg where a knife was strapped, my fingers easily twining around the handle. Kit and Nick took care of the rest, while I knelt in front of Michael Shriven, and reached into the left pocket of his blazer. Sure enough, a small blue card was sandwiched inside a leather wallet. 

Once I had obtained the card, I cut the man's throat open via order. I knew which arteries to sever—and how to perfectly kill without making a mess. His blood stained my hands, and I could feel myself squirming, but pushed my own feelings down. Clean up came quickly, and the others left. Probably going back home.

I was told to go back to the party, but I didn't really feel like partying. I was standing in the freezing cold, trying to scrub the blood off my hands with my own spit, when the man stepped in front of me again. His smile was triumphant after another job well done.  "Relax." His voice was soothing, almost fatherly. "I've told you. If you would like to forget, just relax your body and mind. Imagine yourself in a much happier place."

So, I did as I was told. I closed my eyes and imagined what made Allison happy. 

And minutes later, I was standing on an unfamiliar alleyway filled with unbridled delirium that I didn't understand. 

Time lost.

“Ally!”

The memory splintered apart, and snapped back to fruition on my knees, blood dripping from my nose, pain like lightning in my temples.

Kit was next to me. “You’re okay.” He pulled me to my feet.

“Are we?” Nick spluttered, dropping down next to us, dragging Rory with him. “Did you hear what these crazies are saying?!”

“We don’t want any trouble,” Kit whispered. My housemate rubbed his nose, his fingers coming back red. Just like mine. “Fuck.”

“It’s already starting.” Nick’s replica pointed out. “That symbol on your arm isn’t just a branding. It’s an expiration date.”

“Thanks for pointing that out, asshole.” Nick spat at his double. “So are you.”

The four of them seemed to stiffen up, and I noticed that yes— without their weapons, they wouldn’t manage with their strength.

Ignoring them, I focused on my breathing. The realisation was like ice cold water coming over me, suffocating my lungs. I had remembered everything they forced me to forget. I wasn’t Allison Delacroix. I was a cheap copy, a shell with her memories fashioned into a psycho killer.

The real Allison hovered over the four of us, her eyes set in determination.

“The key card,” she said softly, an edge to her tone. “Where is it?”
