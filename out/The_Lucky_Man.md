The Mississippi moved like a slow beast under the January sky, its surface rippling with the memory of the recent storm. It was 1989 in New Orleans, and the city carried its age in the lines of its streets and the sagging balconies of Royal Street.

Audubon Park’s cypress trees loomed dark, their moss draped like cautious curtains against a world that always seemed to be watching.

I was eleven then. My name’s Eddy Roarke, and I was the kind of kid who couldn’t sit still. I spent my days tinkering with radios and taking apart anything with wires.

But back then, my life was simpler. I didn’t know the city’s shadows could move or that whispers could follow you home.

But I do now. And it started with Lucky Lou.

Lou wasn’t like anyone else on the corner of Dauphine and Dumaine. He wore a crumpled suit that might’ve been sharp a decade ago, walked like gravity was something he played dice with, and carried himself like he didn’t belong anywhere. Most grown-ups muttered about him, crossing the street when he came near, calling him trouble or worse.

I didn’t see trouble. I saw something else. I’d caught glimpses of him doing strange things—like whispering to the Mississippi late at night and watching as the water seemed to rise and fall in rhythm with his voice.

One January afternoon, I saw him sitting on the curb, rolling a cigarette with steady fingers. His dark eyes flicked up to meet mine like he’d been expecting me. I don’t know why I did it, but I crossed the street. My half-built radio was in my pocket.

“Eddy Roarke,” Lou said before I could speak. His voice was calm, low, like the first note of a blues song. He didn’t smile, but he didn’t frown either. “Curiosity got you again, I see.”

I froze. “How do you know my name?”

“Names got a way of introducin’ themselves,” Lou said, tapping his chest. “Especially when the folks carryin’ ‘em can’t sit still. Now, what is it you’re after?”

I tried to match his calm. “I’ve seen you. At the levee. At the corner store. Talking to… no one. What’re you doing?”

“Some folks talk to themselves,” Lou said, a playful edge to his tone. “Others talk to things folks don’t see. You ever seen something you couldn’t explain, Eddy?”

I hesitated. “Once. At the old cemetery. I saw... lights. Blue ones. Thought it was fireflies, but it wasn’t. It moved... funny.”

His expression shifted, just for a second, like a shadow on water. “Blue lights. And you followed ‘em, didn’t you?”

“I wasn’t scared,” I said, a little too quickly.

Lou lit his cigarette, the flame flickering in the dusk. “Not bein’ scared don’t mean you’re safe. You wanna see what’s behind those lights, don’t you?”

I didn’t answer right away, but I didn’t need to. He could see it in me.

“Well,” Lou said, almost to himself, “guess that’s the kind of boy you are. But curiosity’s got a price.”

That night, I couldn’t sleep. Lou’s words played over and over in my mind. By midnight, I’d made up my mind. Quietly, I slipped out of bed and padded out the back door. The streets felt different under the moonlight—empty, like the city was holding its breath.

The cemetery’s gate creaked when I pushed it open. I didn’t need a flashlight; the moonlight was enough. The blue light wasn’t hard to find. It was faint, spilling out from a cracked mausoleum door deep in the older section of the cemetery.

I crept closer, my breath shallow. When I peeked inside, I froze. Lou was there, standing with his back to me, hands raised like he was caught mid-gesture. In front of him, something moved. It wasn’t light or shadow—it shifted and shimmered, its edges blurring as though it couldn’t decide what it wanted to be.

Lou didn’t turn, but he spoke, his voice low and sharp. “Don’t come any closer, Eddy.”

I flinched, but I didn’t move. “What is that?”

Lou turned then. His face was pale, lined with something I couldn’t name. “It’s old,” he said. “Older than this city. And it’s hungry.”

Before I could respond, the thing shifted. It didn’t have eyes, but I felt it look at me. Then it surged forward—faster than anything I’d ever seen. Lou moved in a flash, grabbing me and shoving me back out the door. 

The mausoleum slammed shut, the blue light disappearing.

When I woke, I was back in my bed. My head throbbed, and my body felt heavy. I didn’t remember getting home. I only remembered the mausoleum, the blue light, and Lou’s pale face.

Over the next few days, I searched for him, but he was gone. No one on the corner of Dauphine and Dumaine had seen him, and no one seemed to care.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something had changed. Sometimes, when I was alone, I’d hear whispers—faint, fleeting, like words spoken underwater. And when I looked at the river, it felt like it looked back.

I never told anyone about that night. But I haven’t forgotten. And though I don’t understand the words I hear, I know what they mean:

**"Not yet."**
