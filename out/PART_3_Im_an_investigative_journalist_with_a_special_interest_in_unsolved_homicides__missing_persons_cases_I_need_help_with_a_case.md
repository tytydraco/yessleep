Hey NoSleep. You might remember me from the above posts, the murder case in Massachusetts I was investigating. If you don't, a quick refresher: I'm an investigative journalist on a true crime podcast, and I started looking into this bizarre murder that I got an email about, from one of the responding officers to the original 911 call. I started posting here hoping for some help with the case, because things really didn't make any fucking sense, but after I posted that second part, everything completely fell apart.

I was so scared, I got in my car in the middle of the night and left. I deleted that Reddit account, which I thought would delete the posts too. I didn't want anything to do with that place or this case or being a journalist any more. I'll explain what happened in a minute. But it was like that place couldn't leave me alone. I started having these recurrent nightmares, where I'd be in the woods where the bodies were found, standing over the bodies, mangled and mutilated as they were, but the victims weren't dead. They were talking to me. Sometimes the kid, Victor, who was accused of the crime, was there too, and sometimes his sister, Haley, who had killed herself months before the murder happened.

It got to be where hiding in my apartment two hours away was worse than being in Kent had been, and I decided to go back. I thought, maybe if I figure this out, this will all go away. Maybe I was being haunted by these poor kids, and they would leave me alone if I brought them justice.

I don't know. It sounds crazy. The whole thing has been crazy. I'm so scared, but I'm back in Kent now, and, I don't know, I guess I just want to tell someone what's going on.

The morning after I wrote and posted part two, after that weird lightning, I decided I needed to talk to the Knights. I had no idea where to find them, just that after Victor was acquitted, they moved away. I thought maybe Haley had been buried in the town cemetery, since she died before they moved, so I started there.

I don't actually know why, now that I think about it. What was I going to find at the grave of a girl who killed herself months before this crime actually happened? But I went, and I spent hours pacing through this graveyard, looking for Haley.

And I found her. She had one of those fancy gravestones with a photograph on it, an impressive laser etching of her laughing. It was a beautiful photo, and I stood over it, kind of, I guess, saying a prayer? I don't know. Being respectful, I guess. I closed my eyes for second, folded my hands, very reverent, and then I felt the slightest touch on my shoulder.

I screamed and turned, but there was no one there. I stood there for a few minutes, looking around, hoping for some creepy old groundskeeper to appear or something. Some explanation of what the fuck just happened. And then I looked back at the gravestone and I swear -- I *swear* I am not bullshitting you -- the photograph *looked* at me.

I swear to whatever fucking god you believe in that Haley made eye contact with me, and the look on her face was so afraid that I backed away, like I thought her body would rise out of the ground underneath me, and then I started to run.

I ran wildly towards the gates until until I struck something with my foot and hit the ground. It was one of those small gravestones, the flat ones that are usually temporary. For a second I thought I broke my ankle and the pain took me out of the fear. I sat there, gripping my ankle, sweating, cold with fear and pain, until I heard footsteps and someone stopped in front of me.

"Are you okay?"

I looked up, and there was no mistaking it. She couldn't have looked more like her daughter if she were her twin sister. Haley Knight's mom was standing over me.

I stumbled to my feet, wobbling as I tried to stand without putting any weight on my sprained ankle.

"You're Haley Knight's mom," I said, stupidly.

"Yes...?"

I introduced myself. "I'm a journalist, I've been asked to report on--"

"The murders." It wasn't a question.

"Yes."

"And what have you concluded?" Her voice was icy.

"Nothing," I promised. "I don't like to draw conclusions before I have all the information. That's what I'm doing. I'm looking for information."

"Very well. If you'll excuse me, I'm visiting my daughter." She stepped past me, and even though she was clearly uninterested in further conversation, I couldn't help myself.

"Can I ask you a question?"

She stopped, still facing away from me. Her hands curled into little fists and she looked up at the sky a little, in a way that reminded me of my mom saying "Lord, give me strength" when my brother or I were really pissing her off.

"Fine." She turned around.

"You said, in the police report, you said that Haley had been depressed for a long time before she...died. You said, you said you tried to get her help, but it was like she was afraid."

She looked at me with half-raised eyebrows, waiting for the question.

"What was she afraid of?"

Mrs. Knight looked at me, preternaturally calm, and took a few slow breaths. 

"If I knew," she said. "We wouldn't be here."

I nodded, a little disappointed, and started to go. "Thank you. I'm sorry for your loss."

"Wait."

I turned back, and Mrs. Knight was staring at me, this intense gaze that was both fear and grief all at once.

"Those three kids who were killed on Halloween," she said. "They were not the first victims."

"The first victims of what? A serial killer?"

She shook her head minutely. And then she pointed, over my shoulder, towards the neighborhood across the street from the cemetery.

"You'll have to ask them."
