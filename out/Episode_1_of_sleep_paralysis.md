Many people actually don't believe in sleep paralysis and i had my doubts on it too . As I read through articals and watched videos about sleep paralysis i wondered how it felt being in that state of mind not able to speak or move and being frightened. 

What exactly is sleep paralysis? 
A temporary inability to move or speak while falling asleep or upon waking.

I am a fan of horror movies . I like to read and listen to horror tails alot and is my favourite pastime . I am addicted to listening to people tell there own experience of hauntings they've been through. It's fascinating in its own way. 

I don't get scared easily i really don't. But that afternoon it all changed. 

We all love a good afternoon nap. I like to take a quick powernap so that I can be more productive in the evenings. That day was normal . Nothing unusual happened. In the morning i did saw some videos about people experiencing paranormal activities in there lives and it was normal for me to watch these videos. 
I ate lunch with my family and the i studied a bit. After that I was really tired so I decided to take a nap.


I don't know what happened. If it was a dream or i was actually there but it happened. I was laying chest down on my bed sleeping and suddenly i woke up. 
My back was heavy like someone put weights on my back and normal weights 500kg or even more. 

I slowly turned my head back to see and saw a black figure sitting on my back holding me down. I was terrified. I was trying to shout or maybe i was shouting. 
I was trying to move my hands and my legs so that I could get up but nothing was working

Only my eyes were able to move. My brother and mother were in another room right next to my room. I was trying to call our there names but no sound came . The black figure was just staring at me while  pinning me down. 

I looked at him and he was like a void of nothingness.
It was like i was almost able to see through him. I thought to myself this is how I die . Alot of things were going through my head . I was trying to move my hands and legs . I was trying to scream but nothing worked . 

It felt like forever . Every second seemed to be as long as an hour and every minute was as long as a day . That's how it felt to me . You may think I'm exaggerating this whole thing but you don't know how it feels until you have that experience yourself. 

It was just 3-4 mins of me trying my best not to die . The black figure didn't hurt me he was just sitting on my back staring at me. He had no eyes or mouth or a face to be exact . But somehow I still felt it staring down at me. 

After 3-4 minutes finally my hand moved and i as slamming my hand against the bed to make noise . I still wasn't able to scream . I was just trying to make sound with my hand so that my mother or my brother would here it and come help me . I thought it was real. And at some context it is real i felt it . Every second every min it felt it . 

Suddenly i woke up . My eyes were wet from crying and i was laying on my bed in the same position . I was laying on chest down on the bed . I slowly turned my head thinking the black figure is still sitting on my back but it was gone. I felt lighter . 

I was not able to process what just happened to me. Was i really dying ?  What was that Black figure ? 
Was i dreaming? Or was it sleep paralysis? 

This isn't just the one incident that happened to me . There are many more incidents that's happened and all of them happened in the afternoon when i use to take a nap . Not at night but in afternoon around 4ish every single time.  It's weird but i cannot rap my head around what happenes every single time .
