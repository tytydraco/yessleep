Obviously you know that these creatures of the night are real right? But like I said it’s not how the movies and stories portray. No the job that I have is nightmarish and gruelling, you have to be extremely fit and well, your mental health should be above everyone you know, I’ve known people who have thought stupidly that they could easily do this job and have been consumed of darkness inside their own head to the point where they cut their life of with their own hands.

Enough of that foreboding shit. I hunt nightmares. 

Here’s some rules that you should follow if you wish to do this job as stupid as you are safely and fairly smart:

1. Cut all ties with family and friends, don’t own any social media. It’s a lot easier to go out without having anything like that holding you back, yes that means no love but it also means that others will not suffer should you fail to kill these nightmares and die.

2. This is probably the most important carry something that can kill you quickly a lot of these horrors of the night will torture you should you lose in a battle.
This could be a gun or some pills like cyanide or something of that sort, the gun should be small and lightweight it’s hard to lift the likes of a revolver when your arms or fingers have been ripped from your body. I personally do not care for a gun for that reason so I carry a small pill placed inside my mouth inside a packet which I take with me on every hunt the packet can be dissolved fast inside your stomach acid it’s only a small cyanide pill but I guarantee it would do the job should it ever come to that.
It’s just easier to walk about knowing you have a means of quick escape saving you from the agony and pain.

3. Go to the gym. Learn some martial arts get stronger your mental health will become better anyway through means of exercise as your brain releases these thing called endorphins which make you feel good like when you eat a chocolate bar or something. Doing this and learning things on the way is beneficial to you if it ends in hand to hand combat you need to be fast, strong, accurate and have technique. Just do it trust me I have had some close calls myself.

4. Choose a gun over everything I’m not gonna lie I’d rather shoot these fucks from a distance than go in with a blade. Choose a long range weapon like a rifle it should carry enough power to kill the beasts in one shot. You will need training I recommend before any of this you join your countries military, learn your weapon and be taught write everything down and keep it. Also bring along a second weapon and a third just in case things get tight because trust me that shit happens.

5. Clean your fucking weapons, don’t be fucking stupid. Imagine your sat there prone in the grass in a woods around midnight with your gun staring through the sights at one of these fucks your finger slides over the cold trigger and your exhale your last breath before you squeeze the trigger and the shot hits the creature but doesn’t kill it, it knows where you are now you pull the bolt back for a quick second shot only to find the bolt jams.
Yeah yer fucking idiot clean your weapons.

6. Eat and drink whilst hunting keep your energy up. These hunts can last weeks so bring a lot of food and water and some purification tablets in case of emergencies just pack your normal survival kit, and don’t be a dumbass. It’s always best to be able to fall back on a second hand plan.

7. Remember why your doing this, everyone has their reasons for doing this though there aren’t many of us. I have my reasons, you have yours. Maybe something inexplicable ended one of your close ones lives and your a vengeful spirit hunting these fucks down, or maybe you had a personal experience with one of these things and vow in your own head to hunt them down so it doesn’t happen to anyone else. I have my scars and you have yours, it doesn’t make us the same the only thing you have in common with me is you’re decision to hunt them down.- 

8. Read up on some of these beings if you can  and speak to other more experienced hunters because like I said these things aren’t how the movies and legends portray them sometimes you will be paired with others and that’s how you join the community. They truly are monsters, killers of sorts. And each and everyone of them has its own nightmarish properties and weaknesses learn them.

This shit it’s gonna be hard the government knows about these things they will pay you to do the deed of keeping the general population safe and let me tell you it’s a pretty penny and a life of luxury if your good at it. I will share some of my stories and I’m not like all those stupid writers who don’t tell the whereabouts of the places I’ve been I don’t care if your stupid enough not to believe in me and walk into the likes of wales at night alone with nothing but your phone, I’ll find your body don’t worry and I’ll do you the honours of taking it back to your family wether that is in one part, six parts or just your head, I’m nice like that. If you wish to do what I do take caution and choose if you actually want to do this because once your in you can never leave if the government don’t get you, you best believe that we humans aren’t the only hunters out there no these creatures are smart and will learn what you smell or look like or even taste like. You will be hunted and found by something wether that be in a day or month or years to come. Something will find you wether that’s a gun or a nightmare. I’ll tell you my first experience as a hunter in the next part for now goodbye be safe and don’t be stupid.
And I suppose good luck haha your gonna fucking need it.
