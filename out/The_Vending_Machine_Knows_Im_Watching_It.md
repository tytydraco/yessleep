This is a quick post to update you all on my findings about the vending machine's network. I did spoof the admin to get more info, but I keep hitting nothing but dead ends. Thanks to everyone who commented on my first post, I'll link it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l7pmoa/its_just_a_vending_machine_right/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) for people just seeing this. I would like to say to the guy who asked if I could get it to vend beer, I'm not sure that's how it works. Anyway, here's everything that happened since my last post; It got worse when I started digging:

I successfully spoofed the admin credentials using a universal default most machines ship with to get more info. So I ran scans: MAC address sweeps, signal tracing, passive network detection. Nothing. It’s not broadcasting Bluetooth or Wi-Fi like I thought, not on our LAN. No registered vendor tag. No RFID trail. I couldn't figure out why it was transmitting if it wasn't transmitting to anyone. I tried to brute-force a query through the access panel at the back; old keypad behind a metal plate. No luck. No response. Not even a rejection.

It’s like the machine isn’t on any system. Not ours. Not anyone’s.

I opened the IT inventory records; nothing recent about a vending upgrade. Even the maintenance logs were weird. The last recorded service was six months ago, but the timestamp was an identical copy-paste from another unrelated ticket. Like someone wanted it to look updated but didn’t bother to make it believable. I decided at that point to do some more testing with the machine itself while i let some longer lasting data-mining programs run. I'll post the results of those when I have them.

I stopped avoiding the break room and started watching again. Not buying, not even pretending to choose, just standing there, arms crossed, like I was waiting for it to slip up.

it did.

The first time I gave it a full two minutes. I stood in front of a granola bar in the middle row, C4 I think, and just stared. No blinking. No movement. But suddenly, the blue-wrapped almond bar swapped for a seaweed snack I’d never seen before. Nothing mechanical. Just… different. I couldn't register how it changed, it didn't morph, it didn't stretch or contort, it just was something else. I've had dreams like that. I'm in one place doing something and then in less than a second in another doing something else. My subconscious mind registers the seam between the two events but because it's subconscious it just as if it was as normal as breathing and my mind just keeps going. But I'm not asleep here. I'm awake, I think.

Five minutes later, it was back. I thought maybe I’d imagined it. But I hadn’t. So I started keeping logs:

7:12 AM: nothing changed.

7:15: trail mix replaced by a different brand.

7:22: one item missing from an otherwise full row.

7:27: item reappears. No one came in or out. I checked the cameras. They showed nothing.

It wasn’t random. It always happened when I focused. Not always the same timing, but always when I lingered. When I hovered.

So I tested it. I stared at a specific slot, C1, for five straight minutes. Didn’t blink. Didn’t move. Nothing happened. Then I glanced toward the sink for maybe a second, and when I looked back, C1 had changed. A mint chocolate bar I hadn’t seen since college. Discontinued for years. I don’t think the machine wants to be seen changing. But it does want me to see what it changes to. I told myself I was doing this just to prove it was a glitch, or a prank. That maybe someone was screwing with me. But the further I dig, the less sense it makes. And it keeps responding. Keeps changing things when I’m watching. Or more disturbingly,when I’m not.

I haven’t bought anything from it. Not yet. But the more I watch it, the more it seems to... notice. Every time I walk into the room now, the light inside flickers just slightly like it’s aware. Like it’s bracing. The items? They’re not random. They’re personal. Tailored. And I think it’s learning from how long I look. What I choose not to touch. What I hesitate over.

It’s watching me back. I’m not done testing. But I’m starting to think I’m not the one running the test anymore.
