Not sure if this is the best place to talk about this or not, but I need to get some stuff off my chest. 

To say that things have been getting weird in my life as of late might not sound like much. However, you must understand my life has always been weird. For as long as I can remember I’ve been sleepwalking nearly every night. There has maybe been a dozen or so nights, as far as I can recall, that I didn’t. 

This put a great deal of stress upon my parents, as you might expect. They did their best to give me a shot at a normal life, but ultimately, they couldn’t succeed. My nightly activities were always quite intense; I would sneak out of the house and wonder off to who-knows-where, returning in the early hours of the morning.  

Whenever my parents would try to do anything to prevent this, I would cry and scream, bash my fists on the door, and do anything I could to either be let out or break out. There was, unfortunately, no stopping me. 

I don’t remember anything about those nights. I only remember the impact it had on both myself and my family. I struggled to keep my grades up, to make friends, have fun, and even to just be aware of my surroundings.  

Most of the kids my age would avoid me after the single time another child stayed over at my place during the first grade. No one knows exactly happened, but whatever it was, it caused me to be labelled a freak. After I barely graduated, I went out and got my first and only job. It wasn’t much, just flipping burgers at a fast-food joint in town. It didn’t pay much either, but by the time I was twenty I had saved enough for an apartment and a newer muscle car. Neither of which lasted long.  

By my third month on my own I was thrown out by my landlord. Apparently, I had been scaring my neighbors in the night with my sleepwalking activities. This led to me sleeping in my car for a night. However, after I woke up in the driver seat of my car in a different place than where I fell asleep, I quickly realized I needed to get rid of it fast. Sold it for ten grand to the first person who would buy it for a decent price, even though I didn’t have the title. 

This might not have been so bad had my parents not skipped town shortly after I moved out. Hell, they even changed their phone numbers. Cutting me out of their lives came across as a little bit extreme to me, but I guess I understand. Nearly twenty years of putting up with my moonlight excursions will probably cause someone to do that. My grandmother couldn’t even do a single night of it. 

I was sixteen when my parents tried having me stay with my her and her cats for a while. It was barely six in the morning by the time my father woke me up to pack my things. I still remember my grandmother crying into my mother’s shoulder as I left. I never asked what happened, but I don’t think I would want to know anyways. Never saw her again after that day. 

It’s been seven weeks since I first became homeless. It probably shouldn’t come as a surprise that my sudden lack of anything to tie me down has only given more power to my nightly habit. However, I have made my way far from my home in Mississippi, and all the way to New York City.  

I didn’t do any of that traveling during daylight hours. In fact, I don’t have the slightest clue how I got here so quickly at all. My best guess is that I was sleep-hitchhiking. All I do know is that every day I would wake up in a different city instead of the one I drifted off in. Yet still, this is the least of my concern. I actually grew quite fond of exploring new surroundings every day. Travelling has always been something I wanted to do. 

So now, you might be asking, what’s the problem then? Well, there’s two major ones. First, ever since getting to New York two weeks ago, I haven’t left. I’ve still been sleepwalking, I know that for sure by how groggy I am throughout the day, and the fact that I fall asleep in one part of the city only to wake up in another. Secondly, I’ve been finding things in my backpack that don’t belong to me.  

Now I know, I am homeless and without income, but I wouldn’t turn to theft. It just isn’t me. Would I pick up a twenty-dollar bill if I found it laying on the sidewalk? Sure, of course I would, but that’s not what has been happening.  

It started small; a cig here, a magazine there. Little stuff like that. Lately it’s been more valuable items; smart phones, watches, you name it. Today, however, I found a wallet. It definitely wasn’t mine; it was all pink with little plastic beads and it had a driver's license belonging to some blond hair, blue eyed, eighteen-year-old girl named Chelsey in it. 

This, of course, raised red flags in my mind. Did I mug this poor girl in my sleep, or did I just stumble upon it during my witching hour adventures? Either way, I’ve decided it best that I return the wallet somehow. Not sure if I should just take it to the police station in her neighborhood or just follow the address on the license. I’m leaning more so towards the latter, as I am curious about the weird note that I found with it.  

The letters on the small piece of paper look completely alien to me. Honestly, they look more like random shapes as opposed to any actual human language. Still though, I can’t help but feel as though they do mean something. Hopefully, speaking to its rightful owner might shed some light on what it means. 

Also, one last thing. Is the taste of copper in one’s mouth a normal symptom of long-term sleep deprivation or should I be worried that I have been swallowing coins during the night?
