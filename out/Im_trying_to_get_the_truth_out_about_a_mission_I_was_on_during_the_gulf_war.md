Hi friends. I’m happy to see people are still interested in the truth. I’m picking up from right where I left off last night.

The sand shifted under us with every move making the crawl even longer and more strenuous. When we finally reached the top of the ridge a few minutes later, Royce was the first to peak his head over. When he signaled it was safe we all moved into position to see over the top.

I pulled out my binoculars as did the rest of the squad and we went to work formulating our plan of attack.

The compound was in what you could call the village center of the ruins. Two of the buildings were mostly intact still. The layout of the out was as follows.

There was a single dirt road bisecting the compound and leading the bunker at the rear of the outpost.

There was a guard shack to the far front of the base and to the right hand side of the road. Next to it stood a checkpoint-style wooden gate that blocked the road until the guard in the shack moved it by hand.

To  the left hand side of the road, close to the middle of the outpost. Stood a two story adobe structure that the compounds’ radio and antenna stuck out of. 

The other building still in use was a single story, one room hut that was being used as an ammo storage building. It stood to the left and rear of the radio tower. And was the closest structure to our position.

There were a few tents and canopies set up closer to the bunker on the right side of the road. Presumably the guards slept, ate, and worked out these.

Directly across from tents sat 2 empty lorries and UAZ-469. (The Soviet version of a Jeep.)

Scanning the perimeter I discovered the two biggest threats to us. 

Number 1. The front guard shack had two sets of cables running out of it. One to the huge blast doors of the bunker. And the other to a metal pole with 4 large loudspeakers at the top. The guard in that shack could simultaneously shut our only path into the bunker and alert the entire facility at the same time.

Number 2. Soviet T55 main battle tank parked between a canopy to its left and a large stack of ammo crates on n its right. About 10 meters from Cluster of tents mentioned above. Thankfully the tank’s crew were all outside the tank performing maintenance when we arrived.

The last of the base’s defenses consisted of 8 roaming guards packing AK’s and hand grenades and aguard tower with a single soldier armed with a PKM machine gun and a pair of binoculars. Overall, counting the 4 crewmen of the tank and the sentry in the guardhouse we had 14 hostiles to deal with.

Royce keyed his radio and started quietly forming a strategy with us.

“Alright lads we need to be quick and precise with this one. Mills, I want you to sight in on the sentry in the shack. You’ll kick us off by dropping him. 

“Yes sir.” Mills responded.

“Sir? Wouldn’t an unsuppressed shot alert the guards inside the bunker too?” I interjected.

“Those blast doors are hermetically sealed to prevent chemical or bio weapons from escaping. That should also make them fairly sound proof.” The sergeant replied.

“Now back to it. Lang I know you’re pretty good too so you’ll be responsible for taking out the man in the tower before he dials us in.”

“Copy sergeant” said lang

“Lee I want you to start with the patrol nearest our position and work your way back till nothing is left standing”

“Sir yes sir,” Lee replied while unfolding the bipod of his L86 and moving into a comfortable firing position.

“Dexter, Harris, you’ll be moving forward together. Harris, you’ll be clearing the ammo storage and the radio building. Dexter will be covering your 6 and taking out the crew of the tank when things get loud.”

Me and Harris shot a look and a grin at each other acknowledging our unmatched luck in squad operations. 

“Alright, are we all on the same page? Good, let’s get going.”

“Wait sergeant. I’ve got vehicles inbound from the north” mills calmly cut in.

We all turned to see the headlights of 4 vehicles headed down the one lane dirt road to the compound. We all dug in and got as low as possible while still having eyes on the compound below.

As the vehicles came close to the front gate we could identify the convoy consisting of 2 lorries in the front half. Followed by a black sedan with Iraqi flags on the hood, and one last lorry bringing up the rear.

As the convoy pulled in and came to stop a few yards from the blast doors of the bunker the vehicle doors started flying open.

 The Lead and rear lorries were full of more republican guards who filed out of the back and lined up neatly on either side of the blast doors.

 The second truck in line held scientists in lab coats carrying various sizes of suitcases and crates of other equipment, presumably for chemical weapons inside.

The front passenger door of the sedan then swung open. A sharply dressed officer stepped and then hurried to the back door of the sedan. Opening it while giving a salute, out-stepped the big fish. General Soleman.

But he wasn’t alone. A hunched over, balding man dressed like a college professor in a brown suit with a white shirt and plaid tie stepped out behind him. 

He followed the general as they walked towards the bunker. The blast doors opened as the general approached and the men standing at attention on either side saluted as the general and the professor walked down the staircase into the facility. The scientists filed in behind them followed by the 20 plus soldiers standing guard. And the drivers after they parked their vehicles in the same flat area as the lorries and the UAZ.

The blast doors then shut behind them and the guards resumed their normal patrols.

“Can we move now sir?” Harris asked.

“Go for it Harris but STAY QUIET” Royce ordered in the same quiet yet aggressive tone as the day Lee and Harris had the quarrel in the kill house.

Harris and I crawled over the top of the ridge. We almost lost our footing and took an unfortunate tumble on the steep inner wall of the dune.

Once at the bottom we crouch-walked into the perimeter of the outpost. We timed our advance with when the guard in the tower had his back to us.

Our closest target was the ammo cache. Harris and I stacked up on either side of the door. Harris then slowly turned the knob to open the door. Slowly but surely he pushed the door open while keeping his rifle to his shoulder with his free hand.

He entered the dark room and I stood rear guard watching his six. Creeping slowly in it was evident most of the ammo had been redistributed to troops closer to the front line. Thankfully for us, Most of the crates were empty. No guards hiding in here as well.
 
Harris pulled out one of the blocks of C4 and cut it in half with his combat knife. One side he then attached his spare detonator to and placed it at the bottom of a box of RPG rockets. 

“If things get loud. They're gonna get REAL loud.” He whispered to me.

After creeping back out of the building, we checked our surroundings and advanced to the next target. The radio building was about 15 meters to the front of the ammo cache. We waited for the guard in the tower to turn away again and we sprinted to the shadows on backside of the building.

“We’re going to have to split up for this one.” I whispered to Harris.

Dexter: “you’ll have to clear the radio room solo while I keep eyes on the tank crew. When this kicks off I cannot let them get buttoned up in that thing.”

Harris: “no problem mate I got this. Just like the kill house right?”

He winked at me and I rolled my eyes in return. “Just stay focused and be careful Jimmy.”

Harris used the noise from the radio’s diesel generator to cover his entry into the building. I crept along the left side of the building and peaked in a window about halfway down the wall. It was the only window in the radio room. I got there just in time to see Harris tip toeing in. The room was again empty besides the chair and desk that the radio’s receiver sat on.

I turned away and continued my slow-walk to just behind the front left corner of the building. I could see the tank and its crew on the other side of the road. I then dropped to one knee and got ready to take them out. 

That's when things went sideways. 

As I peered through the SUSAT sight on my SA80, lining up the tank crew for a quick dismissal. I felt the presence of someone, or something, behind me. I spun around, rifle still to my shoulder to see. Nothing in front of me. 

But atop the sand dune just about 3 meters to the right of my other squad mates. Stood a thin, black figure. He was looking at me and not them so instead of immediately engaging it, I started to key my mic and warn them. But in the blink between my left hand leaving my rifle and hitting the push-to-talk but on my radio. It disappeared. 

As I stood there wondering if I was losing it. A very real threat made itself known. Harris was gathering the logs and code books from the desk and let his situational awareness laps. Out of the shadows of the doorway crept an Iraqi soldier.

He drew his pistol and pointed it directly to the back of Harris’s head. I had no choice but to fire a single shot, right through the republican guardsman’s forehead. This, of course, threw the entire order of operations off for the attack.

I heard mill’s shot come no more than a second after mine. Turning back around to cover my assignment I got confirmation mills did not miss. No guard in sight in the shack and a red stain painting the opposite window.

Not a half second later I heard a second crack. Followed by the thud of guard in the tower hitting the earth 20 feet down. Lang did his job.

Back on target now, the tank crew realized what was happening and started scurrying up the side of the tank. I pulled the trigger twice on the bloke with one leg in the commander's hatch first. He threw his arms up and rolled back out of the hatch and off the tank.

Next was the driver. He was grabbing his hatch to close it when I relieved him of some grey matter.

The two others were fighting over the loaders hatch. I tapped the trigger 5 times to make sure they were both done.

Now that my job was done, the sort of tunnel I had in that moment subsided and the fuselade of noise that surrounded me became clear, and deafening. 

Lee was heavy on the trigger on that LSW. Loosely following the rule of firing in bursts long enough to say the words “die motherfucker die” to yourself.

He had cut down 2 guards already and I witnessed the third collapse as a dozen rounds of 5.56 ripped through his lower torso and thighs. 

That left 5 guards still in the fight. Coming around the front of the building. Harris had moved up and kicked open the front door beside me. He came out firing on full auto like a cockney Rambo. He hit nothing of significance of course.

That’s when two guards charged around the side of a tent to our front. We engaged swiftly and both guards hit the ground at almost precisely the same time.

One of the remaining guards made a dash to the guard shack while the two others covered. Presumably to trigger the alarm. The two guards covering his sprint were in defilade from our position behind the large stack of ammo crates. They had dialed in the squads position on the ridge as well, suppressing it.

Thats when Harris made a dash across the outpost towards the bunker to draw their fire. Him and his damn heroics….

The guards, seeing an easier target. Started firing at Harris. Kicking up dust right behind his boot heels. Right before Harris would have to try to run through those blast doors. Royce and lang sighted in on the two guards and riddled them from the top of the ridge.

 At that same moment I turned and drew a bead on the guard as he was attempting to close the guard shack door behind him. I squeezed the trigger about a dozen times and watched ghe wooden door shudder as it splintered. At least a few of my rounds connected given there were no sirens or clacks of locking black doors.

I ran over to guard shack and slung the door open to confirm my suspicions. Seeing someone up close that you just killed is a different kind of terror. In that moment you’re the monster in your own horror movie. But this was war and he could, and would, have gotten us all killed.

Now that the short, but fearsome firefight was over. The rest of the squad filed off the top of the ridge and we all regrouped in the center of the outpost.

“Well we sorted that out but who fired that first shot without permission?” Royce asked slightly irritated.

“I did sir.” I said, stepping forward.

Royce: “Corporal that move could have destroyed this opera-“

Harris: “sir, he saved my life!”

Royce: “what?”

Harris: “I lost focus gathering intel and a hostile got the drop on me. If not for corporal Dexter I’d have a new hole in my head.”

Royce: “that was a critical failure on your part Lance corporal… but that was an impressive response by corporal Dexter. I’ll forgo recommending a reprimand for you Harris. However I expect to see you in the kill house and running PT every day until our next deployment, is that clear?”

Harris: “Sir yes Sir.”

Royce: “Now then. Harris, Lang, get to work figuring out those blast door conttols. Mills, Lee, get in that guard tower and watch our perimeter. Dexter, you’re with me. We’ll be the first two through those doors when they open.”

“Yes sir” the squad and I responded as we received our orders. We split up and ran to our positions. Royce and I took up positions on either side of the road, about 5 meters apart, with interlocking fields of fire on the doors.

Lee and Mills hurried up the ladder to the tower. Lee set up his L86’s bipod near the front left Corner of the tower. Mills rested the fore end of his SA80 on the rear right corner.

Lang and Harris stepped over the two guards in the shack. Stepped up the door controls on the desk. And pulled out their “Arabic to English phrases” translation books. A few seconds later Harris grabbed the lever on the control panel and yanked it down two positions. The doors then slowly started to open.

Royce and I kept the doors covered until they completely opened. Then we ran up to the huge threshold and sighted in on the staircase leading into the bunker. 

Dexter: “Clear.”

Royce: “Clear.”

The wide staircase heading down to a concrete wall with a single door was empty. Beyond that door would be the true entrance into the facility. Royce and I held our positions as we waited for the rest of the squad to form back up around us.

As Lang and Harris made their way back to the group Lang asked:

“You translated it that fast?”

Harris grinned and turned to him. 

“Not really, I just noticed that particular phrase was color coded green. Green means go, right mate?”

“Jesus Christ mate.” Lang giggled as they made their way back to the group.

We all took up positions at the edge of the staircase to watch the door for about a minute and a half. Just to make sure no curious republican guardsman came out to see who was at the door.

Royce: “Alright, before we go any further, let’s suit up in the NBC gear.”

We then pulled off our backpacks. Pulled out our NBC smocks, gloves, and gas masks. We removed our helmets, web gear, and boots and pulled the smocks over our standard uniforms. Then sealed up the suits, slid on the gloves, and refitted all our kit.

We looked like we were about to restart the battle of the Somme in all this kit.

We then made our way slowly down the stairs and stacked up around the door.

Royce: “We breach on 3. 1, 2, 3, breaching, breaching, breaching!”

I grabbed the door and swung it open. Royce and Mills were first through the door. Followed by Lee, Harris, Lang, and myself. I was surprised by the lack of gunshots as I took my turn through the door. I took my position on the far right to notice that the first room was empty.

A good sized lobby-like area with a large circle desk in the center. Presumably where the Republican guard receptionist would sit. There were doors on each of the other 3 walls to our front. Above each door was a stainless steel sign with Arabic lettering.

Time to get the translation books back out. This time it was my turn to play telephone with the signs. We were looking for anything pointing to chemical weapons, so I turned to the C section of the book. Found the word chemical. And started trying to watch the lettering on the signs to the one in the book.

The door on the left wall was a pretty close match so we decided to give it a shot. We stacked up again. Breached again. And yet again, no resistance. The other side of the door opened up to a straight, concrete hallway. With a few doors and windows on each side. At the very end of the hallway stood a large, vault-like, door. I’d bet money that’s where the weapons were stored.

We made our way down the hall. Peeking in windows and covering the side doors as we went. The smaller rooms were research labs. Empty and lights out. They hadn’t been used in at least a few days. The cages along thr back wall where animals were presumably held as test subjects were empty as well. (Thank God)

The second to last door on the left didn’t have any windows though so we breached it. The room was the storage area for the artillery shells that would be charged with chemical agents when it was time to deploy them.
 
“Well. Can’t let these slip away.” Royce said as he armed his C4 charge for remote detonation, and tossed into the center of the room we pulled back out of the room and resumed our sweep.

We reached the large door in the back. It was sealed by a large lever placed in the area where a traditional door knob would be. No keyed lock or combination lock though. Frighteningly lax security for a chemical weapons storage room.

Royce: “Dexter, get the door.” 

I graves the lever and turned it counterclockwise from the 12, to the 9 o’clock position. The locks audibly receded and I pulled the door open. Thank God this room was deserted too as I shutter at the idea of firing a rifle in here.

The room held 4 large, metallic cylinders sitting horizontally, resembling giant welding tanks. “Bingo. Target number one.” I thought to myself.

“Alright, get to planting that C4 boys.” Royce said. Grinning for the first time tonight.

We spread out and started planting our charges. As I passed close to the tank Harris was rigging up. I noticed something peculiar. The pressure gauge on the right end of the tank was reading zero.

“Wait a sec Harris. Don’t waste your charge on this one. It looks empty.” I turned towards the other guys. “Hey, check the pressure gauge on your tank before planting your charge.”

Lang: “Mine’s reading zero.”

Lee: “So is mine.”

Mills: “Zero here too.”

“The tanks were empty. 

“The hell?”

“Were we too late?” 

These were some of the thoughts we vocalized as we looked at Royce.

Royce: “Looks like they moved the weapons. Fuck! Okay, we can still finish this. Set charges on the ceiling here. And along the hallway headed back to the lobby. If we can’t destroy the weapons. We’ll destroy their means to store them.”

“Yes sir!” The squad and I responded as we got to work rigging this entire wing. We had to step jump off of squadmates hands like cheerleaders to reach the ceiling and plant the C4. That gave us some much needed levity.

We entered back into the lobby area and found it empty again. “Where the hell is everybody?” 

Royce: “Okay, let’s get Soleman. Dexter, find out which of these doors leads to the staff quarters.”

I reopened my book and flipped to the S section. Sure enough, the lettering on the right side door matched up. 

At this point we had all but assumed we’d find no one in this area either. Suspicion confirmed. Another long, empty hallway with doors on either side. We did search all the offices anyway and came up with some valuable documents, maps, and manuals. 

The last office down the straight Hall was Soleman’s. We kicked it open, hoping to find him writing his memoirs or some such BS. But no luck. His office was rather strange though. It was adorned with lots of old paintings and relics. I’m talking about BC era stuff. Framed tablets, scrolls, ancient weapons. This guy was a real aficionado of antiquity. 

The thing that really unsettled me though was the ancient drawing that hung, framed behind his desk. It depicted a circle of stick figure people surrounding a little alter. Floating just above the altar was another stick figure. This one was much more detailed and just felt. Out of proportion. in relation to the others. Its limbs were much longer and ended in visible fingers. They had colored the figures' eyes with purple dye. And the top of its head had small nubs protruding out.

The painting looked to be the oldest in the room by aesthetics. But was also in the best shape. The whole squad was feeling my eeriness at this point.

Mills: “this guy is seriously unbalanced.”

Harris: “too right mate.”

Royce: “well we’re going to get him back in balance with a few ounces of lead. Let's move out.”

We headed back down the hallway and back into the lobby. 

Only one door to go. 

We stacked up and got ready to breach, when something hit me like a train. A high pitched scream echoed through my head and let out an audible gasp. 

“What corporal?” Sergeant Royce spun around and looked at me.

“Did- did you not hear that?” I asked, perplexed.

“Hear what son?” He asked genuinely.

“I- it was nothing I guess. Probably just air ducts acting up.” I tried to make sense to myself.

“I know this has been a slog but I need you to keep it together for the rest of squad dex.” Royce said, laying a hand on my shoulder.

“Yes sir. Won’t happen again.” I responded as I readied myself to breach. 

We kicked in the door and flooded into the next room. This one was very different. It was a metal catwalk surrounded by a cylinder of canvas material. The far end of the walkway ended in a T with a sealed door. The right of the door was a staircase that led down to a second landing with another door in the same position.

We walked to the other end and made the decision that we should definitely take the high ground. We would make entry through the top door.

I volunteered to be the first through the door while Royce held it open for the rest of us.

“1, 2, 3, breaching, breaching. Breaching!” I was through the door and immediately blinded by some bright lights. After a few moments of dreadful uncertainty my vision came back. 

The other side of the door opened up into a massive archaeological dig sight. The tall spotlights they used to illuminate the area made it clear the entire dig site was located inside the walls of some huge ancient building.
 
The 20 foot adobe walls were full of cracks that trickles of sand slowly slid through. The vaulted ceiling had ornate chandeliers still hanging centuries later. The cobble stone floor was lined with pews on either side of a carpeted walkway that led up to a small altar. This was a temple.
 
That’s when I noticed the men standing at the Altar. I quickly took cover behind the railing of the catwalk. Followed closely by the rest of the squad.

Royce was the last one in and scooted himself in next to me. We peered over the edge of the railing, watching the spectacle beneath us. 

There were 10 or Soleman’s men standing along the outside edge of the altar. Facing away from us and the pews. A few meters in from them stood the scientists. They were now wearing scarlet red robes with gold threading and ornate designs across the back and arms. Handcuffed and on their knees sat the other 10 of Soleman’s men. They were arranged in a circle around the center of the altar. “The fuck?”

I heard the squeaky clamor of one of the old doors inside the temple open. To the left and right below our position. Out walked Soleman and the Professor. Soleman was still in uniform but the professor was now wearing a purple robe in the same style as the other scientists. Under his left arm he carried a large, black book with gold engravings.

We froze, praying that they wouldn’t look up as they made their way over to the walkway and down the carpeted aisle.

Stepping up to the altar. The professor pulled the hood of his robe over his head. The rest of the scientists turned, bowed, pulled the hoods of their robes over their heads, and then walked over to form a circle directly behind the restrained men. “Oh no.”

The professor opened the book and then began loudly reciting stansa’s in some ancient, dead language. After each one the rest of the scientists recited it back in unison. 

After 4 or 5 of these repetitions. The scientists drew long, ceremonial daggers from their robes and put them against the soldiers' necks. After one final recitation, they drug their knives slowly across the soldiers throats.

The blood spewed from their necks, colliding in midair and dropping straight down to the circular divot in the center of the Altar. The divot was filled with sand that turned a deep red as it filled with the sacrificial liquid.

After the bodies had been mostly drained. The scientists pet the poor soldiers bodies fall backward and the remaining guards drug them away.

As soon as they were moved. The scientists took their place and dropped to their knees, raised their hands to the sky. And began chanting loudly again.

I was about to vomit. “What the fuck have we found!? How long has this been going on?! Those poor men. They looked to be the youngest of the group from the trucks.” My mind was racing as fast as my heart.

Then the horror really began. The crimson sand turned black as coal and started to shake as if a tremor was confined to under the small divot.

“What the fuck?”

The liquid then began to ascend from the divot, carrying the black sand with it.

“No way.”

“No.”

“No, no, no.” 

“It can’t be.”

My mind. And likely the minds of the rest of the squad, we’re pulled back to the drawing in Soleman’s office. It was real. It was all real!

The shape twisted and formed into the horrid caricature illuminated in the drawing. Pitch black skin, long spindly limbs, long, clawed fingers, the emaciated figure, the purple eyes, the small, blunt horns, they all came to life before our eyes.

I couldn’t take my eyes away from the horror. But if I did, I know the rest of the squad was as horrified and speechless as me. Shaking and on the verge of vomiting.

The scientists continue to sing loud praises to the entity. The professor, the sick fuck. Walked up and dropped to his knees in front of the entity. Reaching out like he wanted to touch the hands of a messiah.

The entity reached out one hand. And said a short sentence in the same language the scientists were using. Its voice was deafening and echoed off the walls of the temple. At that moment sand started pouring in from the cracks in the walls and ceiling. It gravitated to the altar, around the creature. Blowing in an impossible wind like a tiny sandstorm around the entity.

“This. This can’t be real.”

I could hear Mills mutter to himself. This is the only time I’ve ever heard his voice raise above a cool monotone. And it was shaking in terror.

Royce was stunned. Standing perfectly still. Mouth agape.

Lee kept sighted in on the beast with his L86. I could see his arms trembling slightly and beads of sweat running down his cheek.

Lang was on the verge of tears. Breathing rapidly and letting out short whimpers. 

Harris just looked at me. Waiting for me to come up with a plan.

The entity then rested its hand on the professor's bald head. Laughing maniacally like an echo out of hell itself. The professor began laughing. Enraptured by it. 

Then the beast gripped the top of the professor's head. His laughs turned to pained shrieks but before he could actually scream. The beast rotated his head 90 degrees and twisted off like a soda cap.

The professor's blood showered the beast. It extended its long, black tongue, to catch the red mist. Then raising the severed head into the air. It drank the blood that flowed down from its severed neck.

The other scientists then began to chant in a panic. Obviously begging for mercy. That’s when the beast’s other hand raised. It pulled sand up from the ground and formed it into jagged spikes in mid air. And with a flick of his wrists. The spike flew through the faces of all 10 scientists.

That's when Soleman drew his gun and commanded his men to fire. Soleman got 3 shots off before the beast formed a scimitar-like blade in its hand and bisected the general at the waist. 

Some of the guards broke and ran. While others let loose on full auto. Spraying the beast with 7.62mm bullets. The beast absorbed the rounds just like a sandbag. Cackling again as it went one by one cleaving the terrified soldiers.

This was truly hell come to earth.

The soldiers attempting to escape found the bottom door locked from the other side. They begged, screamed. And tried to push, charge, and shoot the door open. But to no avail.

The beast was now hovering off the edge of the altar and moving towards our position. That’s when I finally found the will to speak. 

I turned to Royce “sir your orders!”

Royce still sat motionless.

“Sir! Your orders.”

Royce just shook his head in disbelief.

“Goddamnit sergeant what do we do!!!”

I screamed as loud as I could.

Royce’s lips finally started to move.

“Ehm uhm mmm w- we-……”

“WEAPONS FREE, WEAPONS FREE, WEAPONS FREE!!!!!!!”


…….


They’re trying to dial me in again. I’ll have to go radio silent for a bit. The conclusion will be out tomorrow. God willing.
