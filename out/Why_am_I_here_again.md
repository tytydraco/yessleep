I woke up at 7:00 today. I flailed my arms for my dream journal. I grabbed my pen and started to write about the dream I had, but after a few minutes, I realized that i had the same dream last night. I scribbled out the first few sentences and added a tally mark to the bottom of my last dreams page.

I got out of bed and went to the bathroom. I put in some contacts like I usually do, and made myself some coffee. I went into my room and turned on my old laptop, a 10 year old Lenovo Y7000. I booted up google and checked my gmail, but nothing new besides adverts about how people are going to give me free sound sample packs.

I realized that I had not seen my cat that morning so I went into the dining room to check up on him. he was peacefully sleeping in his bed. Cuddles was such a fantastic buddy, so I filled up his bowl with his favorite snack and left him be.

I booted up my project and started working on it, coding in new features. Today I made a counter that counted the amount of times you clicked you mouse. Perfect for showing off at school tomorrow. As I sat there with a piece of toast in my hand, I had thought about how unusually pristine today was. It seemed picture perfect. Oh how I would love to live like this forever.

I played games and chilled out for the rest of the day like the hermit I am, waiting for nighttime so I could play a chaotic round of shooter games and listen to my friends trash talk one another. I was satisfied for the day and went to bed. I dozed off for the night, destined to dream about the most nonsensical of things

I woke up at 7:00 today. I shuffled over to my night stand to grab my journal. I thought about writing about my dream, but after a few minutes, I realized that I had the same dream last night. I added another tally mark to the bottom of my last dreams page. I now had dreamed about that twice, and wait a minute why did I wake up so early again? It's summer, I usually wake up at 9. I shrugged it off and got out of bed

I went to the bathroom and grabbed my contacts. I put them in and went to make myself coffee. Wait, didn't i do the same thing yesterday?  I laughed and chuckled to myself about how i was making things bigger than they were. I went over to Cuddles and saw him sleeping again. Filled up his bowl with food, and went back into my room.

Booted up my project and coded in new features. I made a... wait a minute didn't i code in a click counter yesterday? it's not here. Well, might as well do it again. It looked and felt the same. No.. somethings not right. I checked my calendar, it was the same day as yesterday. Must be a stupid glitch, but... no, the calendars are coded to calculate the date without fail. How is it the same day again?

I went into the bathroom and calmed myself down but I was in a panic. I tried fruitlessly to pinch myself out of the "dream", but this was real life.

it was real life

it was real life

was it real life?

what is real life?

I wake up again to the cold uncaring buzzing of my alarm clock again. I got up from my bed and tiredly went to the bathroom to grab my contacts again. I saw a bug, a big bug. I let it be. It will do something today. I put in the contacts. It singed my eyes having not washed them, but I will take anything I can get to feel something new, anything new. Why am I here again? Back in this nightmare again? 

It hurts

I am in a Sisyphean nightmare

Everyday I have the same nightmare and it goes something like this :

I woke up at 7:00 today.
