Ancient hunter gatherers predominately built circular buildings. True 90 degree angles rarely exist in nature. As civilisation developed we abandoned these buildings to worship the right angle. We wished to  develop and optimise our cities and as our cities spread across the planet like a cancer so too did the corners. Maybe these ancient people had long forgotten lore or knowledge for their circular structures. Maybe we welcomed something into our homes to feed and grow fat off us when we forgot.

Have you ever caught yourself staring into the corner of a room? Have you ever seen something there in the corner of your eye but when you’ve looked there’s nothing, or ever felt watched in an empty room? That’s him. Whether it be him or his eight-legged children, they are always watching from the infinite space between intersecting walls, floors, and ceilings. Intersecting planes don’t simply end, the space shrinks smaller and smaller infinitely like a black hole to form infinite space and in that infinite space lives a hungry god.

The corner had always soothed me in times of distress. Where some retreat to the bottle, I retire to the corner of my bed. Whether it be arguments or scoldings, I would find comfort in the corner. This was the case when I lost my mother. We knew it was coming but it was still unexpected when it happened. The feeling of losing a loved one is indescribable. It felt like every pain in the world and numbness all at once and even after 6 months the grief hadn’t subsided. One particularly bad day I had returned home to agonise about the state of my life and all of its misfortunes, thinking about my regrets and all the cherished memories I never made before retreating to my bed to ruminate. I closed my eyes and shoved my face into the corner on my bed, my tears soaking the pillows which engulfed my face. Upon opening my eyes I was met with a sight I could have never expected. I was in an impossible space. 

A deep black void looking down upon an endless plane of flowing kaleidoscopic tendrils pulsing rhythmically like parasitic worms in the eyes of a snail. The tendrils shifted between vibrant colours like a mating display of a cuttlefish and its hypnotic colours and movements had me entranced in an instant. It was mesmerising. I don’t know how long I was staring into the mass of tentacles but it felt like an instant and a millennium all at once. Then my eyes were drawn to something foreign to the monotony. A distant blob which began to grow as it approached.

As it drew nearer the dance of the tendrils below began to speed up and I was able to make out a distinct arachnidian form. A black and brown mess of legs flailing as if lacking any bodily control. As it closed the distance I could finally identify it as something wholly unnatural to this plane. A children’s stick puppet. It looked as though it was hastily coloured in with black and brown crayon and pencil and its shape continued to morph with a billion red eyes shifting around and interchanging positions. The only consistency in its form was its eight legs pinned onto its paper body. Its legs moved stiffly as it approached me from across the field. Its pinned joints being its only form of articulation yet despite this it glided unnaturally fast towards me. The terror I felt released me from my daze and I tried to escape but in that instant I realised I was stuck, the tendrils forming a crystalline web. Before I knew it, it had arrived. I could only watch in horror as its 2D form lay before me. Its body flickered like tv static, as if my mind was shielding me from its true indescribable form. It revealed a pair of paper mandibles pinned to its body before they closed down upon my head. 

The pain wasn’t instant. I felt a growing burning sensation in my head turning into a deep searing pain as I felt it tear my mind. The jagged spikes of the paper mandibles locking themselves around my brain as it stretched and tore my thoughts. It was euphoric. I felt every negative thought being ripped from my mind. Doubts, struggles, grief. None were protected from the purge. I should have felt relieved being released from the burden of these feelings… but then why did it hurt? The pain of my mind being stretched and shredded was nothing to the hurt I was feeling. Memories began to flood my ravaged mind. A lullaby to sleep. A story book. A kiss on the cheek. An embarrassing photo. An argument. Many arguments. A delicious homemade dinner. A dinner refused. Trips to the aquarium. Tears of joy and sadness. Countless memories. Cherished memories. If I let go would she go too? Would these memories go. I couldn’t let that be taken from me.I squeezed my eyes tight as the pain reached its apex. I refused to let them go. I refuse to let this abomination take anything. These are mine and no matter the pain or sorrow they give me the strength to remember. And like that the pain was gone. 

I opened my eyes to nothing. I lifted my head and I was back in my bed. The back of my head throbbed slightly but my mind was still intact. I looked around. Nothing felt real. I rolled onto my back to look at the ceiling noticing a spider had built a web in the corner. I can’t stand spiders anymore. I used to love them but now I can’t even look at them without feeling a lump rise in my throat. Everything still doesn’t feel real and to this day I doubt whether anything I saw was truly real although I know it was. I know because in the edge of my vision I catch glimpses of glowing red eyes from the corners.
