Am I the only one who has a deep detestation for criminals? It appears that way because they live comfortable lives, and it really, really bothers me.

I'm not talking about your explicit criminals, ie rapists, murderers, etc. I mean obviously fuck them..

Specifically white-collar criminals / organized crime syndicates. On paper they're great people, but in reality they are worthless piles of garbage who are speeding up the degradation of a functioning society.

There is no denying it...is it because it appears to be a victimless crime that they get a pass? If society put the same focus on hating money launderers, embezzlers, bankrcupty fraud perpetrators, Etc. The world would be a better place.

For example, I know of an individual who made brief headlines in a worthless operation they ran, they were arrested. You know what changed for them? absolutely fucking nothing. How and why is that possible..and if this small time nobody gets away with it, imagine big corps..makes me absolutely sick.

You can't even trust the police because they're either powerless to these groups, affiliated with them, or simply in their pockets.

Hollywood glamorizes most of them, and one of the most infuriating things I hear is "they have respect" like WHAT?

People have also told me "don't focus on them focus on yourself" well sorry but slaving away, having nothing, whilst criminals live a life of luxury is bullshit. 

Not to mention there is no point in going at it yourself because literally every market is propped up by criminals..and we all elect to ignore it, even deny it.

Good luck starting a construction company without having to deal with rotten criminals. Jewelry Finance Restaurants Garbage Media

MEDICIAL ESTABLISHMENT

Literally every facet of everything is utterly polluted, even the government. Sure you can start some Mickey Mouse business and never expand, but if you ever try to reach the big leagues you either have to play by the rules; rules set by the criminals at the top, or literally be killed. You could have the most brilliant idea and strategy to execute a business, but once you are in the spotlight you have no choice but to submit or die at the hands of criminals, especially if your profits cut into theirs.

What am I missing in this equation ? What am I not seeing. What are possible solutions to circumvent this dilemma.

I'm very tired of living among scumbags masquerading as good people. And there is nothing noble about keeping a low profile, not getting involved, whilst allowing society to crumble. Doing nothing in and of itself is arguably criminal. I refuse to work for anyone but myself because I do not want blood money, no matter the payout.

When people think white collar they think of bernie madoff, but there are thousands(conservatively) of madoffs around on a smaller scale who have families, nice lives. I hope they suffer. Some of them are religious, they use their religion and their children as cannon fodder, their only loyalty is to their rackets and their criminal friends. Criminals need to suffer, and people need to start wanting criminals to suffer

Police know who the big players are, why can't they broadcast their names and photographs and all other details to the general public. detail their crimes, let the general population rightfully foam from their mouths
