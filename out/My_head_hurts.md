“My head hurts.” My son said, as he stared directly into my eyes holding his forehead. I started back, blankly. I tried speaking but no words came out.

Like any other concerned parent, I tried to make my son feel better. I tucked him in on the couch, two pillows to raise his head and a light fuzzy blanket. I turned on the TV so my son could relax and fall asleep. I dialed my work. “My son isn’t feeling well, I need to take the day off.” I said. My boss replied “Lexi,” he paused for a moment. “Most of our workers called out sick, and I need someone to manage cashier #5.” I put the phone down. “I’ll be there.” I said angrily. I hung up as I walked around in circles, calling Lance, my husband. “Lance,” I sighed. “Rowan is sick, and my work needs a worker.” I said. “Okay.” He said. “Thank you, babe.” I said, sighing with relief. “Rowan, your daddy is going to be here in a little, mommy has to go to work.” I heard a groan, followed with a thudding noise. 

“Rowan?!” I shouted. I ran upstairs to our old white couch. “I’m okay.” He said. He stood up slowly and lied back down on the couch. Lance walked in the door. I rushed out the door. 10:32 AM is when I arrived at my work. “Glad you could make it, Lex.” My boss chuckled. I didn’t make a sound and went over to cashier #5. I looked over to cashier #3 to see a lousy worker, half asleep on his keyboard. “God damnit.” My boss yelled. “Get up Nolan!” He shouted. His head rose up as he began to stand shakily. My boss went to his office while stomping. 

My store phone rang. “Hello, Lexi Chavez speaking at Safeway.” “You need to get home.” Lance said as the phone suddenly lost signal. I sneaked out of the store, worried. In about 10 minutes I made it home. “Lance, Rowan, Is everything okay?!” I said almost in tears. “Rowan is passed out. We need to go, now!” I let out a tear while I saw lance picking up Rowan’s body. I rushed outside and quickly started driving to the nearest hospital. “My son has fainted!” I screamed. A worker quickly took Rowan on a hospital bed into a room. Me and Lance followed behind. We waited in the waiting room for hours. “Lexi, may I speak to you privately?” A doctor said to me. “Of course.” My voice shook and it became hard to swallow. We sat down in the doctors office. “Your son.” She paused slowly. “His head is bleeding.” “Like a nose bleed?” I asked many questions before she could respond such as “Is it serious?” She slowed me down. 

“Your sons disease is deadly, we’re not sure he will make it.” I sobbed quietly. “Please.” I said quietly “Tell me more about this.. disease..” I sobbed. “His head is bleeding, causing internal damage to the brain cells and head. If it spreads to quickly, it can pop open veins all over the body, causing him to loose enough blood to potentially die.” I sobbed in my arm. “He needs to stay here for a few days.” The doctor looked into my eyes as if I were her kid. She put her hand on my shoulder. “We’re trying our best.” Lance tapped me on the shoulder. “Lexi, why are you twitching so much in your sleep?” I got up. “Is Rowan okay?” “He’s fine.” I went to the bathroom. “My head hurts, Lance.” I fainted
