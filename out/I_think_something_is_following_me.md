I am what some people would call a “painfully average Joe”. I wake up, brush my teeth, eat my breakfast (usually chosen from a breakfast menu from a fast food joint), go to work, eat lunch (always some kind of ramen or slapped-together sandwich made by yours truly), work some more, ride a bus home, take a shower, eat dinner, watch some trash television on Netflix or something, and finally go to bed. What I listed just now is my everyday life. I follow the same routine every day from the moment I wake up to the moment I eventually go to sleep. Nothing in my life has any excitement or thrill to it. I have no hobbies, I don’t have a spouse or anyone to go home to, and I have no friends outside of work. Not to imply that I have work friends. Every time I go into the office I feel invisible. Most conversations I have with my co-workers usually last ten to thirty seconds and it’s always some sort of awkward small talk. It’s my fault really, I’ve always tended to lean towards the socially inept side of things.

My name is Mitch by the way and I’m an office clerk, in case any of you are curious enough to care. Now I didn’t come on here to bore you to death with the dullness of my everyday life. I came here to ask for some advice. Right now, I’m writing this on my personal laptop at 4 am on a Wednesday. I should be sleeping right now. I don’t get up for two hours but I’m too scared to death to sleep because I’m afraid if I do, it’ll get me.

 It’s outside right now. I see it out my window. And I think it’s following me.

Scratch that, not think, I KNOW it’s following me. I’ve been seeing it everywhere lately. At first, it was just in the corner of my eye but I think it’s been getting more bold lately. The reason I keep calling the thing an “it” is because I know it’s not a person. From a distance, it looks like a British businessman ripped straight from the 1950s. It looks like a guy with a grey French suit, a thin black tie, and a black bowler hat. Its face is…off-putting to say the least. Its eyes are way too small and way too spaced apart. They’re like little black beads on either side of its skull. Its mouth and lips are huge compared to the rest of its face and are way below its eyes and nose. It has broad shoulders and a stockier build compared to the average person. And, to top it all off, it has a thin, minuscule mustache over its mouth. It would be funny-looking if it weren’t so ominous.

Looking over what I’ve just written so far, I think I should name this thing. I’m starting to get tired of calling this thing an “it” or “the thing”. From now on, I’m just gonna call it “Mr. Blank”. Now that we’ve gotten that out of the way, I think I first started seeing Mr. Blank roughly a couple of months back (I think it was in early February) when I was waiting at a bus stop for a smart bus. I don’t have a car because I don’t have my driver's license despite being a fully grown man. Plus, since I live in an urban area, I never really saw the use of a car when there was free public transportation. Anyway, when I was waiting at the bus stop, I was scrolling on my phone to pass the time. I don’t remember what exactly it was that I invested all my attention to (it was most likely cute dog videos). It was about 7:30-ish in the morning when I saw a black, amorphous blob at the corner of my eye. When I turned my head to see what it was, it was gone. I looked around for a bit before I shrugged it off and went about my day. After that, things only escalated from there.  I thought I was just seeing things and needed to get more sleep. But, as the days went on, I started seeing it more. I started seeing more shapeless masses around me more frequently and eventually, those blobs started to become what I now call Mr. Blank. I saw him outside the restaurant where I was eating lunch a couple of days ago, the sidewalk across the street where I would usually walk, I passed him while reading the bus to work on a few occasions, and (just recently) I saw it staring at me through the window in the office building I work at.

And now I’m here, furiously clacking away at my laptop in the middle of the night. I don’t know what else to do. I’m genuinely afraid for my life here. The only reason I’m even awake right now is because I was looking over some extra work from the office yesterday and I just noticed this bastard out my apartment window.

He’s just standing there, LOOKING at me, JUDGING me.

It won’t leave me alone. I can’t go confront him because he looks way stronger than me (and I’m not exactly in peak physical form myself). I can’t ask for help because I don’t think anyone else can see him besides me. Most times he’s by himself but there were few occasions where he’d just be in a crowd and people would just pass by him like he were just another guy on the sidewalk.

I need help. Please, give me some suggestions on what to do. I’m at my wit's end here.

I don’t know what this thing will do if I don’t figure something out.
