There really isn’t a way for me to say this without sounding crazy, but I promise you I am completely sane. Everyone I’ve told so far thinks I’m either insane, or need a “psych ward visit.” Let’s start from the beginning, I had gotten a letter in the mail that my father had died. In that letter it clearly stated he was leaving his cabin to me, but honestly I had no clue he even had a cabin. To be honest, my family was actually estranged from me. I had been no contact for years, and there was absolutely no reason I should have gotten this. I had no clue how to react, but I chalked it up to some sick joke someone decided to play on me. When I showed my fiancé the letter he snatched it out of my hand, and instantly told me that we had to go to the cabin for Christmas. I obviously didn’t want to go to some random cabin for Christmas, especially since I had absolutely no clue what could be in there. For all I knew, it was absolutely rundown. I was standing firm on my answer, “no.” 

Well, that absolutely lasted all about maybe a week. My fiancé is absolutely stubborn, and there was no way he was going to back down from this. He loved nature, and he kept begging to go so he could finally hunt. We live in the city, and it’s been a while since he’d actually been back out into the country/woods. A good maybe four weeks went by it was finally time to go, but again I definitely did not want to. I decided to take a nap on the ride there, because it was about six hours from where we lived. As soon as we got there I got a very creepy vibe, and a very unsettled stomach. Don’t get me wrong, it was a very beautiful cabin just didn’t give the best vibes I guess. Nothing was really happening, and I was finally settling into the couch as I read my book. Fast forward may be about two hours, and I’m halfway through my book when I see something running out of the corner of my eye. Of course though, as soon as I look up it’s gone. My fiancé was out setting up his blind so he could hunt later, and this honestly just fueled more fuel to the paranoia fire going on inside my brain. I am a very petite woman, and I have never in my life ever had to defend myself. I really don’t know what got into me, because even looking back now it still makes me cringe at my choices. 

Stupidly, I decided to get up and walk towards the direction the shadow figure ran. After this it was all a blur, I have no clue what happened in the hours after that. All I remember is my fiancé, Alan, shaking me awake while crying and begging me to not be dead. When my eyes finally decide to refocus, I saw why he was crying. Everything in the cabin was completely and utterly smashed, or destroyed to the point there was no fixing. Even weirder though, my entire body was filled with scratches and bruises. I couldn’t stand the thought of staying there even one more second, I was leaving with or without my fiancé. Although when I tried to stand I couldn’t, I almost fell right back on my face if it weren’t for my fiancé I would have. He carried me out to the car and placed me in the passenger seat, going back in to grab everything we brought. When he came back he said he would be right back, just had to grab everything he set up for his morning hunt. Those words terrified me, and I had no clue why they sounded like he was leaving me to the wolves. As soon as he left I locked the doors, and decided to turn on some music to try and calm myself down. Again though, out of the corner of my eye I saw the shadow figure. It made me jump while my entire body filled up with goosebumps, but it vanished again just like last time. My fiancé eventually got back to the car, and I unlocked it for him to get in as soon as he did I told him we needed to get out of there now. I couldn’t bring myself to sleep in the car ride home, but as soon as my body hit my bed at home I crashed. 

Fast forward a couple of weeks everything was normal, and I was finally getting back into the groove of my life without being afraid. Without seeing that stupid shadow thing, but that did not last for long. I started seeing it again, but I refused to admit that I did. In hindsight, I can see how this only angered whatever it is. When I started to ignore it everything got so much worse, not only was I seeing it now but I was feeling it. I could feel it touched me, but it wasn’t a welcoming touch it was a burning hot sensation. It simply felt like my skin was going to burn off, and if it wasn’t that it was scratches or bruises again. My fiancé started seeing the bruises and scratches, and I had no choice but to tell him that I started seeing it again. He instantly told me that I needed to make a therapist appointment, and that if I wouldn’t he would. To him, this was me slipping into insanity. It’s only drove a wedge between us, and eventually led to me calling off the engagement while simultaneously kicking him out of my condo. I think that’s what it wanted though, because now there is no one else in the way. I’m seeing it more frequent, and it’s touch has began to actually leave welts. I’m scared.. any advice?
