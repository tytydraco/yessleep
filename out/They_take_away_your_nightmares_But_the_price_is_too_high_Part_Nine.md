**** 

The burbling laughter began to subside, like a deep geyser that was spent, if only for a short while.  The Hyena stared at me silently for several seconds, its burning eyes fluttering and flickering before suddenly shifting from a pale yellow to a verdant green.  Behind me, the Sheriff stifled an uncomfortable chuckle even as the voice of the creature before me filled my brain.

**Do you know what I am?**

The voice was not overly loud in my head, but the strength of it pushing into my mind still caused me to wince and shudder as I tried to formulate a response.  My first instinct was to say no, but I realized that wasn’t true, and to lie in this place might be deadly.  So, eyes watering, I forced myself to look back at the creature and give the answer I somehow had to give, even if it was not my own.

“You are the Hyena.”

A small bubbling laugh as its eyes passed to yellow and back to green.

**Yes.  I suppose that is an apt name.  But names are not what we are.  They are what others use to define us.  Confine us.  Control us.**  It paused a moment and then added.  **Who controls you, Clint?**

I felt a fresh stab of fear at it using my name, but I pushed past it, trying to respond to everything out of instinct rather than overthinking it or giving what I hoped might be a pleasing answer.  “I…I don’t really know.  I guess it would be the thing that I work…that I serve.  But I don’t really know what that thing is.  It could be like you, for all I know.”

**It could, couldn’t it?  And if that were so, knowing more about me would help you to understand it, correct?  Help you to know what holds your leash?**

I tried to not look irritated as I nodded.  “Maybe, yeah.”

**I like you, Clint.  I haven’t decided if I’m going to kill you yet or not, but I do like you so far.  Very reasonable and polite.  So I will tell you a small story.  If you survive this, it might even be of use to you down the line.**

Swallowing, I croaked out a soft “thank you”, but if the Hyena heard it, it gave no sign.  Instead, it began telling me where dreams come from.

**** 

**You are familiar with your world, and it may not surprise you to learn that there is a nearly infinite variety of this existence, each with its own variations on what has and will happen here.  What you may not know is that these realities sit between other planes of existence known as The Seven Realms.  And among those seven realms is the one I come from.**

**Incarnata.**
 
**Incarnata is one of the largest and most powerful realms, as it is home to so much of what you might call ideas and beliefs.  It is ever-changing, always growing, and in some ways it has stronger ties to this reality than any other Realm, as things here shape Incarnata.  In fact, some would say that Incarnata exists because the hearts and minds of this infinite terrestrial plane think it and wish it into being, or at least give it form and structure.**

It let out a small giggle.

**This is, of course, foolish untruth.  I think you are familiar with the maxim that “The Dream dreams the dreamer” or something similar, and while unrefined and simplistic, that statement is largely true.  This world and others like it partially exist because of Incarnata, and the symbiotic relationship between my world and yours is a vital connection underpinning the continued existence of both.  This has been true since the beginning, when the first of us were formed and began to dream, filling this place we had never visited with new ideas and emotions and life.**

**You call me the Hyena, and that is an apt name.  I am the progenitor, the Form, the idea for many things, including that child, Imago, animal that you call by the name hyena.  If I didn’t exist, neither would it, not just in its physical form, but all it represents.  But again, it is not truly reciprocal, and the hyena in flesh or thought here does not represent me.  I have given birth to many wonderful and terrible things in this world and dreamed many dreamers to life.**

Its lips curled back in what might have been its horrific version of a smile as it ruminated a moment before going on, its eyes flaring brighter.

**The weavers do much of the work now, but I and my kind are much older, and the foundations of much that exists here and in Incarnata rests on what we brought into being.  If we are lost or subjugated, the suffering in both this reality and mine would be unimaginable…haha…pun intended.**

**Which is one reason why, when Incarnata began to be taken over, many of us started to flee here.  Or at least try.  Some of us, especially the oldest and most powerful, have very little ability to survive here, as the stronger our ties to our Realm, the harder it is to exist outside of it.  A weaker, younger Incarnata might come here temporarily or even permanently if they’re clever enough.  They find thin places or open doors.  Cracks they can crawl through.  You’ve seen plenty of those, haven’t you?  They sometimes call them Nightmares, don’t they?**

I nodded, tongue thick in my throat.

**They’re coming from Incarnata, but that method would not work for those of us with real power there.  We have to find other methods.  Ways of gathering strength and making the full transition into this world.**

Feeling a new surge of anger, I interrupted him.  “By taking over a town and driving them all crazy so they kill each other?”

The Hyena’s eyes flared again as it crossed its paws in front of it.  **Yes.  I waited patiently, an aspect of myself in this hole for all these years, laying in the dark and listening for their approach.  I knew it would work, but not how long it would take.  And I did it, not out of cruelty, but out of necessity.  This was my way to escape the Mark, or so I thought.**

I frowned at him.  “I don’t know what ‘the Mark’ is.”

**Not a what, but a who.  A woman who spent decades slowly taking over large portions of Incarnata.  She is trapped for now, but it will not last.  She will escape and conquer again, and you’ll be sending me back to her.**

I blinked.  He was right.  I wasn’t there to kill him.  I was supposed to…what…Give him the Elixir and expel him back to Incarnata.  

I shuddered at the alien thoughts in my head, somehow worse than the voice of the Hyena.  Whatever we were working for, it had its hooks buried so deep that it was telling me what to do now.  Not words, exactly, but the ideas were clear enough.  What the fuck was I doing here?

I held up my hands.  “I don’t know what’s going on.  So how about this?  Fuck it.  I don’t think you’re lying to me…though why I feel that way, who the fuck knows.  But you’ve told me more in ten minutes than anyone else.  So I’ll let you go.  Or you let me go.  Or whatever.  And I fucking quit.  And whoever I *was* working for can suck my dick and I hope if they come down here for you, you beat their fucking ass.  Just let us go and do whatever weird shit you’re going to do.  How does that sound?”

A fresh eruption of laughter from the Hyena as his eyes danced between yellow and green before settling into a dark, cool blue.  **I knew I liked you.  I won’t eat you.  And I appreciate the sentiment, but it’s too late for all of that.  Your master has already won.**

“What do you mean?”

The Hyena let out a small, tired sigh.  **I am so tired.  Doing all of this…pushing myself slightly into this reality, building enough influence to do what I’ve done here…It has all been done within the smallest of margins, and your work undoing that has undone me as well.  I cannot win here, and fighting further will only weaken my chances of survival and freedom back on the other side.**

I found myself wanting to argue, as though I should be working to convince this monster who had killed or enslaved God knew how many that he should keep at it.  It was insane, but then everything was insane now, wasn’t it?  I was so lost and terrified that it became easy to just follow the steady current flowing through my head, pushing me to finish the job I had already begun.

“So you’ll drink the Elixir?”

The Hyena snickered.  **Elixir.  It’s blood, you know.  Or what passes for it.  A more clever way out than mine, it seems.**  It stood up suddenly, towering over me as it padded a couple of steps closer.  *But yes, I’ll drink it.**  The creature looked past me to the Sheriff.  **Sleep.**

I turned and saw the man slump to the floor, unconscious.

**I’ve told all of them to sleep, and they won’t wake again until I’m gone.  My influence will be gone too, but I can’t speak for how they will act after so long and all they have done in my name.  You would do well to leave quickly once this is done.**

Breath tight in my chest, I nodded.  “Okay.  Um, thank you.  I…”  My words faded out as I pulled out the satchel and withdrew the…Elixir from it.  “Should I just…”  I was going to say *pour it on the ground for you to lick up* but I stopped myself.  Whatever this thing was, it wasn’t an animal really, and however horrified I was at what it had done, I couldn’t help but find myself in awe of it as well.  It spoke up in my head.

**Just pour it onto my tongue.  That should work fine.**

It lowered its head, tongue lolling out of a mouth big enough to swallow me whole.  I heard its liquid laugh in my head as I recoiled a little.  **Don’t be scared.  I said I won’t eat you, and I don’t lie.  Let’s just get it done.**

I gave him a shaky nod and poured out the flask’s contents onto his tongue.  I had the thought it might be a trick—that he’d spit it out or that the Elixir would do something different than my ma…my gut said it would.  But the Hyena was true to his word, curling his tongue back and swallowing without sparing a drop.  As soon as he sat back, I felt another wave of confusing sadness.  Had I done the right thing?  I didn’t know.  Tears in the corners of my eyes, I looked up at the creature before me.

“I…I’m sorry.”

The Hyena’s eyes were still glowing a soft blue as it regarded me.

**Me too.  You know, it’s funn…**

Suddenly, its eyes fell dark as its fur and skin turned to grey stone.  I stood there for several seconds, staring at the enormous statute left behind as I waited for some sign of new life or movement.  There was none.  Wiping my cheeks, I turned to the Sheriff and took his gun from its holster before grabbing him under the armpits to begin the long process of dragging him back toward the elevator.

**** 

I didn’t say much to Holliman and Graves when I reached them outside.  Told them it was done and that we needed to leave now before people started waking up crazy or looking for someone to blame.  They didn’t argue, and despite our exhaustion and Mrs. Graves’ arm, we nearly ran back to where we’d left the car downtown.  Ten minutes later we were past the city limits sign and on our way to a hospital far enough away to not be affected by what had gone on in Braxton.

We spent the next four hours waiting for them to treat Mrs. Graves, and when they finally came out to give us an update, they said that she was doing fine, but they needed to keep her overnight.  We went back to see her before they carried her up to her new room, and she did look a little better, if still pale and exhausted.  She smiled at us when we both offered to stay.

“No.  You two go get some sleep.  That’s what I’m going to do too.  Come back in the morning.  I’ll be fine.”

We didn’t argue, and a few minutes later, we were getting back in the car for Mr. Holliman to take me home.  Cranking the car, Holliman paused before putting it in reverse.  I looked over and he was staring at the steering wheel, his face unreadable.

“Clint…I…I just want to say that I’m very proud of you.  You’re a much braver man that I am, I think.  And I don’t know what we would have done without you back there.”

There was a time when I would have gloried in his praise, but too much had happened since then.  Too much bullshit under the bridge, or whatever the saying would be.  I was too exhausted to be clever, but in some ways I felt crystal clear.

“Take me to it.”

Holliman raised an eyebrow at me.  “Take you to what?  You want to get something to eat or…”

“Stop the bullshit.  You know what I mean.  Take me to your boss.  Our boss.  Show me what exactly it is we’re serving.”

He puffed out a long breath as his face grew red.  “Clint, now is not the time or the place for this conversa…”  His words trailed off as he saw me pull the Sheriff’s revolver from my jacket pocket.
