I am now locked in the toilet as my left eye furiously bangs on the door. I am beyond terrified, and I don't think I'll survive much longer,  but if I will, my most important wish is to document the happenings of today.

The day started as normal until something at the back of my mind told me there was a wrong thing. My sight wasn't as full as it usually was. It wasn't as if one of my eyes was closed, but that some of my sights had disappeared entirely.

I lightly grazed the spot my left eye was supposed to be, but instead of touching eyelashes, there was only bare skin. I ran to the mirror and saw with absolute horror, that there was only skin where my eye was supposed to be. I looked absolutely hideous. 

My appearance was my main worry. Without my good looks, my lover wouldn't love me anymore. I would go home, and onto the bed alone. That, I couldn't stand.

I ran and grabbed my phone, dialling my left eye. The wretched creature wouldn't answer her phone. (I was a male, but my left eye liked the look of men, which either meant that it was gay or female, and since I believe that I am straight and that I share that aspect with my whole body, it must be female.)

After the tenth ring, it finally connected. I spat: "Where are you?" 

"With my lover. I believe it is time for you and me to separate. I have left you for another man!"

She hung up on me before I could get another word in. I couldn't blame her, I was absolutely speechless. It would have taken me another three minutes before I'd be able to formulate a sentence, and that sentence would be: *What?* 

Perhaps I'd be fine if my left eye only took the eyeball, but the damn thing took my eyelids, eyelashes, and eyebrows. I realize now that perhaps it believed it had a right to them, as they were named after her. But I was hideous! 

I ran to my closet and swung open the doors, I quickly put on clothes. I would find that little piece of shit, and I would force her to come back before I had my first date with my new lover. First impressions were important, and I wasn't going to show up one-eyed.

I leapt and ran down the stairs out of the apartment, out of the door, and onto the bus. I sat there, simmering with fury, for nearly ten minutes, before I glanced backwards. It was eerily silent on the bus, and I wondered if somebody was there with me. Just as I looked, the bus stopped and the doors swung open.

It was my eye! She sat there, trying to look inconspicuous by browsing her phone . She was staring at that thing. I stood up and made my way towards her, "you little shit!"

"Stop!" She shrieked and ran out of the bus. I followed behind her. She kept screaming: "Help me, anybody:"

I was tackled. A short man with a bald head jerked his shoulder into my stomach. It was painful, forcing my body to freeze, making me grunt, and sending me toppling down into the ground. The man mounted me and said: 

"You're a perv!" He said. 

"She's mine!" I said.

"Women aren't property," he stated, disgusted.

"But she is!" 

"This is unacceptable," he said. "I am calling the cops."

"Look at what you've done," I cried to my eye. She had been standing on my left side, and for obvious reasons, I could not see her. When I shifted my head towards her direction, I saw that the damned rascal had abandoned me. 

When the cops came, I was given a stern talking-to, a couple of warnings, and a bunch of bad stares. I would have done the same back to them, but that would only have been half as effective. Deciding to stay silent, I waited for them to leave.

Without a clue where my eye had gone, I wandered around the town, hoping to spot her walking around. Then, I saw her! She was on the palm under a soft cloth tissue of a man. He and his friends stared at it with curiosity.

"That is my eye!" I said.

"I am sorry to inform you, " he said, "but I found it on the floor, As I was the one to find it, it is from now on mine!"

"False!" I said. "Eyes are the property of the body, and my body wants my eye back."

"No, no, I think I'm fine," my body whispered.

"Traitor!" I spat.

"Aha," the man said, putting my eye in his pocket, and entering a car with the rest of his friends. They were a cocky bunch. But, I had nothing to say. They simply wouldn't hand over my eye, and I thought it was lost when they drove away.

It was only ten minutes left until my first date with my love, with who I had communicated for over a whole month. But, just as I was about to enter the restaurant I saw my eye approaching the same place. I decided at that moment, that she was certainly mocking me!

"Oh please," she said, as I cornered her. "I am here to meet my date. Please let me. He is the love of my life."

Her words struck a chord with me. That was exactly what I was going to do! I simply couldn't rob her of this opportunity, then I'd be no better than her. She would be better than me, and how could a part be better than a hole? It was simply illogical.

"Fine," I said. "But, then you come back to me.

"Thank you so much!" She said eagerly.

I walked into the restaurant, my eye walking behind me. Then, I took a seat, expectedly waiting for the love of my life to enter. She was a beauty, rich with complexity, and just looking at her told you she was intelligent. She was something I felt could open a whole new world for me.   


And then my eye sat across me. 

"Get away," I said. "She's about to come."

"I am her," she said. "But you are not him!"

"What? You can't be Martha! Martha's a human name."

"And you can't be Jack, that is the name of a handsome man, of which you are not. Furthermore, your name is Eric."

"It is you! I said my name was Eric because I thought Jack was too simplistic."

"Oh please, how could you miss that they're both as simplistic."

"I guess you could hall me half-sighted."

The comment enraged her, and she jumped forward at my throat. I quickly stood up as she smashed against the floor. I turned out and ran away. She tried to chase me, but the optic nerve was stuck in the chair.

And that was how I got into my situation.  I am unsure what to do now, but I don't think I will survive.
