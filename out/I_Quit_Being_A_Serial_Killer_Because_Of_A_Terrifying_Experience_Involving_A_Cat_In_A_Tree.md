I used to be a screenwriter—well, I suppose I still am, technically, but I don’t write anymore. I can’t. It’s been months since I dropped everything and walked away from that project, and I haven’t touched a script since. That show… *Being a Serial Killer*. It was supposed to be a breakthrough. A high-concept, dark drama. At first, the ideas were exciting. The potential, endless. But then… everything changed.

I was halfway through a rewrite for the pilot episode when it happened. I can’t bring myself to say what, not yet. Not until I’m sure. But what I saw, what I *felt*… I can still hear it, sometimes, in the silence.

Now I’m back to searching for work, pretending things are normal. But it’s hard to ignore the weight of the trauma, the *nightmare* that follows me, and the nagging feeling that I didn’t just leave the show behind. Something followed me out.

I used to *relish* every moment of it. You know, "being a serial killer"—it was *in my veins*, like I was born for it. It was *cutting-edge*, the way I’d craft each kill, shaping my own signature with *precision*. Some people collect stamps, others hoard antiques; me? I collected lives. And I was damn good at it. I didn’t just *slaughter*—I *created*. Each victim, carefully selected, was a canvas waiting for my *bloody brushstrokes*.

I was *ruthless*, sure, but that was the *point*. There was a rhythm, a flow to it. Like a perfectly composed symphony of terror, where every note had to be hit just right. The *chase* with the detectives? *Delicious*. It wasn’t just about the killing anymore—it was the *game*, the back and forth, the thrill of watching them think they had me cornered, only for me to *slip away* like a shadow. And when they thought they understood my pattern, when they thought they were one step ahead? I’d throw in a *twist*, keep them on their toes. It was a real *killer instinct*.

You can’t really call it a “hobby,” though, can you? It’s more than that. It was my *craft*. The way I meticulously planned every *slice*, every *cut* of the knife—it wasn’t just murder, it was art. And as for the gore? Well, I didn’t just *spill it*, I *painted with it*. Each drop, each splash—it was part of the *masterpiece*.

Being a serial killer wasn’t just what I did. It wasn't just another writing gig I had become completely immersed in and obsessed with. It was who I *was*.

Behind the scenes of *Being a Serial Killer*, it wasn’t the creative process that consumed me—it was the grind. The *endless grind*.

Hours spent brainstorming, writing, rewriting, refining. It was all for *nothing*, really. At least, that’s how it felt. The pay barely covered rent, let alone the therapy sessions I was already starting to need. But, of course, no one cared. Being a writer on a show was nothing more than a joke to the showrunners, who spent more time puffing up their egos than actually considering what went into making the thing. You were just a cog in the machine, your ideas ground down into dust by the relentless, soulless demands of the industry.

Every meeting was an exercise in humiliation. They’d ignore everything I said, dismiss my suggestions without a second thought, while fawning over some intern who couldn’t even spell “serial killer” correctly, let alone understand the depths of a character's motivations. Meanwhile, I was stuck fixing dialogue for characters who were barely more than caricatures of the twisted art I wanted to create.

But the worst part? The *title*. The one thing I had fought to keep authentic. "Being a Serial Killer" was *my vision*, raw and unapologetic. But they hated it. The execs, the showrunners, the suits—whatever you want to call them—they couldn't care less about the soul of the show. No, they wanted something marketable. Something more *mainstream*. And so, it was changed. *"Living With a Killer."*

What a joke. A stupid, sanitized version of what was supposed to be a *gritty*, psychological horror series about a man who lived with the blood on his hands every day, suffocating under the weight of his own darkness. Instead, they wanted *lighthearted* moments. Maybe the protagonist would even have a kid! Or, a pet cat! A *cat*.

I should've seen the writing on the wall then. The *shadow* hanging over everything, thick and cold. The producers wanted a cat. *A cat.*

The whole damn world felt like it was against me, but none more so than this *cat*. Ms. Informal, as they called her. Or *Snuggles* in the script, whatever the hell that meant. I had a creeping suspicion that her name was the least of my problems.

Animal handlers were rushing past me, their faces flushed with urgency. They were frantic, searching high and low, whispering *her* name, but all I could hear in the background was the dull hum of the coffee maker as I neared the breakroom and my own bitter thoughts. I should’ve let it go, but I couldn’t.

I was in the breakroom, staring at the coffee machine, trying to ignore the growing weight in my chest.

I ordered my coffee—black, of course—and stood there, feeling the heat of the machine, the sound of the steam pressing against my skull. *Focus*, I told myself. Focus on anything but the cat.

That’s when I saw it. A tail.

No one else was around, and the place felt oddly still.

In a moment of sheer *stupidity*, I reached out and lifted the tablecloth. Just to get a glimpse. Just to see if I could finally put an end to this stupid, persistent feeling of tension the cat had caused.

I didn’t mean to do it. Really, I didn’t. But something in me snapped—something deep in the pit of my stomach. I lifted the cloth, and *there she was*. Her wide, glossy eyes fixed on mine, a flash of fear darting across her face.

I swear I didn’t mean to scare her. But when she bolted, when she shot out from under the table like a bolt of lightning, my gut twisted. *I* had made her do that.

She ran, straight for the window. My heart raced as she leapt up onto the sill, and in that single, terrifying moment, I could only watch in horror as she launched herself into the air.

My breath caught. I’d startled her so badly, I thought—*I thought*—I’d killed her.

I was *sick* to my stomach, my mind spinning as I rushed to the window. My hands trembled as I looked down, expecting to see a lifeless, mangled body sprawled out below.

But instead, the coffee burned my chest as I spilled it, the sudden pain of the hot liquid shocking me into a harsh, involuntary yell.

And then—I heard her.

The cat’s cry—a sharp, panicked meow.

She hadn’t hit the ground. She’d landed on a tree branch, and now she was stuck, too scared to move.

For a brief moment, I stood frozen there, chest searing with pain, the burning of the coffee mingling with the crushing weight of guilt. And yet, it was almost like something else was taking over. A strange, protective feeling rose inside me, a deep urge to make things right—to save her.

Without thinking, I pushed the window open further, the cool air rushing in. My head spun with confusion, guilt, and fear, but none of it stopped me.

I crawled out onto the windowsill, ignoring the stinging heat on my chest, and reached for the branch. My hand shook, but I climbed out further, inching closer to where she was stuck. The tree was low enough for me to reach, but she seemed so helpless, so *fragile*.

I could hear her cries, soft and terrified. And it was then, as my fingertips brushed the bark, that I realized something: I was trying to save a cat—*a cat*—after everything I had done.

Maybe I wasn’t the villain in this story after all.

I had to get her down.

I was almost there. The burning in my chest, the searing pain from the coffee spill, was fading now, replaced by something colder, something more urgent. Ms. Informal was perched on the branch, her eyes fixed on me. Her fur looked strange in the moonlight, darker, almost oily. She didn’t move when I crawled closer, not an inch. Her eyes never left me, as if she were *waiting*.

I stretched out my hand, trembling, heart hammering in my chest. I had to help her. I couldn’t leave her here, stuck on this branch.

But as my fingers brushed her fur, something was wrong.

It wasn’t the softness I expected. No, this was slick, too slick. Cold, like rubber. My skin crawled. I pulled my hand back, but before I could react, I heard it.

*The meow.*

But it wasn’t right. The sound was *off*, too high-pitched, distorted. Like it was coming from the wrong throat, the wrong creature. And then—before I could even make sense of it—*she* made a sound that didn’t belong.

A shriek.

It wasn’t a meow. It wasn’t anything I’d ever heard from a cat. It was a jagged, bone-shaking wail that vibrated deep in my chest. My vision blurred with the sound, the world around me trembling.

And that’s when it happened.

The fur *split open*.

It wasn’t gradual. It wasn’t a slow transformation. One moment, she was a cat. The next, she was *ripping open* like a cheap costume. A seam ran down her back, a line of darkness, and then—*she split apart*.

I froze. My hand was still stuck in the mess, sinking deeper into the writhing thing that *wasn’t* a cat. It was worse than any nightmare. Beneath the fur—beneath the mask of normality—was *something*... *wrong*.

It was like spaghetti. No—worse. Like *spaghetti* and *meatballs*, if they were made of maggots and gore. A wet, glistening mass of wriggling, slimy tendrils. It oozed and *squirmed*, pulsing with unnatural life. The texture was all wrong—slick and sticky under my fingers, like I was touching something *alive* but not alive, something that should not exist.

I tried to pull my hand back. I *wanted to* pull away, but it was as if my fingers were glued to it, sucked into the mass of writhing filth.

And then—*it shrieked again.*

Not a meow, not a scream—this was a *scream*. A wail that vibrated through my skull, rattling my brain, clawing into my mind. The thing inside *her* was *alive*, something alien, something wrong.

I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t move.

My vision blurred. The tree tilted. The world around me cracked, splintering, breaking into pieces.

I felt myself falling.

It wasn’t slow. It wasn’t graceful.

I plummeted, the ground rushing up at me in a terrifying blur. My limbs flailed, my chest tight from the burning pain, but it didn’t matter. Nothing mattered. My screams mixed with the thing’s wails. And then—*crash*.

When I woke, I was in a hospital room.

It was so quiet.

Too quiet.

The white walls, the sterile air—it all felt *wrong*. My body ached, but there was a strange detachment, as if I wasn’t fully present in it. It was like waking up from a nightmare, but instead of relief, I felt... *empty*.

I blinked, confused. The room was too clean, too peaceful. I didn’t know how I got here.

My chest was still burning from the coffee, but it didn’t feel like it was mine anymore. My head spun.

And then, it hit me.

The tree.

*Her*.

*That thing*.

I gasped, my breath catching in my throat. I bolted upright, panic flooding me. The memory of what I had touched, what I had *felt*, slammed into me like a freight train. My stomach lurched.

I screamed. It came out of me, raw, desperate, the sound scratching at my throat.

I tried to stand, but my limbs weren’t cooperating. My arms were weak, my body unsteady. I thrashed in the bed, the sheets tangling around my legs as the terror surged through me.

“Get off me!” I screamed, my voice shaking. “I can’t—I can’t—”

The door swung open. Two men stepped inside, their faces blank, expressionless. One of them was the producer, the other was a lawyer. They didn’t seem surprised to see me like this. Not the way I was, thrashing in panic.

They didn’t even blink.

“Are you… okay?” the producer asked, his voice flat, like he was reading from a script.

The lawyer didn’t even look at me, his eyes glued to his clipboard. “We need to know when you’ll be able to finish the script. Or if we need to replace you.”

*Replace me?*

I froze. Replace me? They wanted to replace me?

The horror surged back in a flood of nausea. The cat—the thing—I could still feel it, the cold wetness of it, the shriek ringing in my ears.

I snapped. The laugh bubbled out of me, manic, wild.

“Replace me!” I yelled, my voice rising. “Yeah, replace me. I’m *done*. I’m *finished*. I won’t be coming back.”

The laughter was bubbling up like a broken dam, spilling from my mouth in a cracked, deranged sound.

Their eyes were wide now, but they didn’t understand. They couldn’t understand.

I leaned forward, my eyes wild. “You *got a cat*!” I shouted, pointing at them, my words slurring into madness. “She’s some *cat*, you—”

I cackled. It wasn’t a laugh. It was a howl, a cry of madness, of terror, of *freedom*. They didn’t get it. They didn’t *see* it.

“She’s some *cat*,” I shouted, louder and louder, the sound echoing in the sterile room. “You got a cat! You don’t know what’s in there, but I do!”

Later I felt much better and I made a full recovery. I went home, and thought about how I might enjoy a job as a trash collector, or a pool boy, or perhaps as a bartender. I don't think I'll ever write anything, ever again, though, and that might be the worst of it.

I just don't know if I'll ever be able to go back to doing what I loved. I don't think about "being a serial killer" anymore, I'm well cured of all that gorenography and nightmare fuel. In fact, I doubt I'll ever write again.
