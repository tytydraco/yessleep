[[[Hello readers, this is my first time posting in this Reddit. I am a college student and have been working on a story called “the secret that can kill” at its point right now, it’s very much a concept piece and less than a first draft.

This story is poorly written, but will develop over time the more chances I have to work on the story. Right now chapter one is in a plot point writing and will be more fledged out when I’m finished with it. I just need motivation to continue.

So with that being said, I’ll let you get to it. Welcome to the first concept chapter of…]]]


The Secret that Can Kill
 
 
In the beginning, there was nothing. No lights, sounds, nor matter anywhere. Though when stricken with the blinding light, the endless noise, and the awful stench there was a voice. As quiet as the silence that once was, a voice that was persistent in the background of the newly formed nervous system of the stars. 

Echoes of a time that forever once, was, and will be. Something before man, before the noise and the light. Watching, waiting… following. Man will never be able to understand the voice in the background of their minds. For if they ever will, endless torment of an understanding unable to be understood will bleed into their consciousness metaphorically until it becomes a physical bleed. 

Whether through means of self or through another. How do you avoid that of which you know not? How do you ignore the understanding without understanding to avoid that understanding? Few accidently lift the veil of which they can’t understand. Their stories, from afar seem to be disconnected but are very much not. 

Some have tried to write, speak, scream the words they wish to use to portray the description of what lays beyond the veil. But nothing goes through the ignorance of man. But is this ignorance willing? In order to know that you must avoid knowing the unknown, you must first know that of which should never be known. An impossible and trivial task of ignorance to a secret that can kill.
 
​This story is one of the recounting of a mad man who wishes to not die alone. So, reader, this is your first and final warning for the effects this story will have on your soul. For anyone who bears witness to the descriptions of which shall not be known in any form of the knowledge, will suffer the consequences of such knowledge. 

Consequences that, if you wish to accept them by reading the following story, you will soon understand. By the end of this story, I hope you realize that this is a confession of the sins brought upon me by a calculated insanity that infected me. A disease easily transmitted through words or images. That of which you will be afflicted by upon reading further into this story.
 
​With that, my warning is complete. You as a functional human being have made your choice of either continuing your endless suffering with me or stay blissfully blind and ignorant to the truth of this universe and the vastness beyond it. Welcome, to the final book you will ever read.

 
Chapter 1
Denial

Most stories start at the beginning. But there is no beginning here, at least one that is comprehendible and able to be shared through words. The cold office walls stare at me as their cousins’ flicker light in my direction. The swivel chair creaks every time I move back and forth between my computer and adjacent file cabinet, lightly pushing myself off of the walls of my cubical with the souls of my feet. 

I never felt complete and comfortable here, every day I find myself watching the clock until my temporary imprisonment is over and I am able to wander my small contained earth and observe the same mundane things as yesterday and tomorrow. *Ding* my computer screams at me, unwillingly, my attention drifts back to my job as the email appears on the cracked screen of my desktop. 

It’s from my boss, asking for a meeting with me in a couple days to discuss my “work ethic”. I can’t be mad at him, lately it feels like I’ve just been sitting around waiting for something to happen. Like a computer program that missed its start code. I know there are things that I can do and become but I’m missing that event that starts my code.
 
​How can I function like a normal human being if I’m not one. The sounds of everyone packing their things brings my consciousness back to my body. “Closing time, open all the doors and let you out into the world!” I hear Jeffery sing as he struts his way towards my desk. “Heyyyyy Gaaaarrry” He says to me in that voice that means ‘Please do something for me and not make me feel like an asshole for asking it’. 

“What do you need, Jeff?” I ask giving in to the societal pressure to follow along with this bond of tones. “So, everyone at the office hates that you sulk everywhere. It really brings the mood down. And yeah, sure, we know it’s because of-“ Jeff says before I cut him off with a sighed “Jeffery” through clenched teeth. “Okay, okay. Anyways, I figured you need something to brighten your days up. So, we are going to the club tonight” Jeff says holding up two tickets to an underground night club I’ve never heard of before. 

“No” I say, getting slight enjoyment from watching the smile wipe off Jeff’s face. “Well, too damn bad. You’re going with me and we are going to have a good night.” Knowing that fighting was futile, I begin my drive home with an unexpected guest in my passenger seat. ‘This can’t be happening’, I think to myself.
 
Dressed in a gray colored hoodie, black baggy sweat pants, and my favorite beanie, I step out into the living room where my barely invited guest waits in silence for my reveal. “Really?” Jeff says disappointingly. “What? It’s comfortable” I try to defend myself before Jeff mockingly replies “ItS cOmFoRtAbLe. Come on, this is a prestigious club. You’ll find girls, guys, they’s or whatever you’re into. 

They’re not going to talk to low budget Dahmer over here.” Ouch. “Come on, let me take a look at what you’ve got going on in your wardrobe.” Jeffery says making his way over to my room. He opens the closet, and says “Damn, you really put the War in wardrobe, don’t you.” He fumbles with all of my piles of clothes before he finally decides on an outfit.
 
​Standing outside of a random door underneath the bridge outside of the office, I say to Jeff “Wow, I never knew this was here. But I guess it wouldn’t be underground if it wasn’t… well… underground.” Jeff looks at me with an actual smile this time, not one of those shit eating grins he does when mischievous acts are afoot. It warms me. I’ve never noticed before how much he lifts my day. Like a beautiful view from atop a mountain side, overlooking the palmy beaches of a crystal-clear ocean. Holy shit, do I have feelings for Jeff? No, this can’t be happening.
 
​Jeff knocks on the door and a small latch immediately opens on the door. Like a cartoon, two eyes peer at us from the newly formed hole in the door. They look us up, down, and then ask us for our names. Upon this information, the eyes let us through the door. As Jeff and I walk down the stairs together, I feel comfort knowing that it was just a guy and not floating eyeballs. 

The room we walk into his huge, with purple and red lights emitting from almost every crevasse yet somehow it is still dark. My ears are stricken with a very loud Russian woman screaming over an extreme bass beat. People are dancing along yet how they are feeling a joyful flow from this angry music I cannot understand. Many different faces fill the crowd of fists unsuccessfully attempting to punch the ceiling. Jeff takes my hand and I feel myself being pulled toward the crowd. 

Now in the middle of it, Jeff and I dance together in the symphony of this music. I am now able to find the joy in this angry woman’s voice. For she doesn’t come off as angry anymore, instead a happiness is heard within her words. Why I feel like this, I will never understand. This place isn’t my scene, but I think I may have found my new scene. At least, one to look forward to. A vision not once visible before, of me and jeff together atop that mountain side.
 
 
​Just as quickly as it came, that vision dissipates as jeff starts walking away. How selfish of me to think the feeling was mutual. This new found obsession helps me think away from the thought of the endless despair of.. I don’t even know. The endless despair of despair. Some moment away from the boringness of life, and im already high off of the feeling of adventure. I don’t even know where I am. So when a man came up to me, and offered me a strange little black pill, I took it. I don’t know why, to get out of this scary feeling I’m drowning in. Or maybe it was to stop these obsessive thoughts for a man who only brought me here to get me to stop being shut in. Though hitting on him would be a success to his efforts, I don’t think going from quiet freak to I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU is such a good idea. To be honest I can’t even tell if I really do have feelings for him, or if im in love with the feeling of an adventure. Those tv shows where the protagonist figures out that there is a hidden world behind the veil of their eyes are my… the room is spinning.
 
​With one last look around, I fall on my ass. A dull sharp pain fills my lower back quickly subsided with a different feeling. One I have never felt in such full force before. Dread fills me as I realize there is no escaping the next few hours, or however long this shit is going to last. Sitting on the floor, seconds feel like days, time to process everything I’ve done in my life so far. Is this it? Is this all I am? When I was growing up, the other kids wanted to be astronauts, police officers, and firemen. But I wanted to be a space ranger. I know, stupid right? The want for something impossible has been weighing on me my whole life. So much so that its ruined opportunities for me. That feeling of waiting for something to happen. It’s like that allegory for God sending a ship to help that drowning man. Someone reaches for my hands and pulls me to my feet, but I don’t break from my thoughts. Half in and half out of the light I watch myself be led through the maze of people. Am I a good person? If I were to die right now, like I probably will, would I be happy with my decisions? Would I go to an afterlife? Hallway. Is there an afterlife? Is God real? Is he judging me? Red door. Did I leave my oven on? “You don’t have an oven” a voice creeps into the back of my head. Empty room. “Who said that?” no response. Fluorescent light.
 
​
 
 
 
Minutes pass, no wait hours, days? God how long have I been here. I snap out of my own head into the shifting wallpaper on the blank walls. That… wait… what? The wallpaper on these blank walls is moving? When I look directly at the blank wall there is nothing but an off-white wall. I turn my eyes to the floor and the walls show me their truths. Like looking into the eyes of a psychopath, this room stares me down like food. Something on the walls is moving, eyes, fingers, words? I can’t tell what it is, every time I try to get a better look, the wall hides itself behind that blank white mask. After a few more minutes of losing my mind, I realize that there is no door in this room. How did I get in here? Where is here? I spin in place, afraid to touch the walls so I stick to the middle of the room. No doors, windows, nothing. “Blank” walls illuminated by a single fluorescent bulb in the middle of the room. This can’t be happening.
 
​With every spin something changes. Spin, there’s a chair in the corner. Spin, chair is gone but now there is a lamp in its stead. Spin, table. Spin, window! I try to open the window, but my hand slams into the wall when I reach for the glass. The paint smudged on my fingertips. The pain begins to swell through my fingers while I spin around again, desperately trying to find my way out. Minutes, Hours, Days, I have no way to track time in this place. 

After I fell on my ass, dizzy, looking up I notice a red door on the roof. I jump, to no avail, I was always taller than my cohorts but this time its no help to me. Curiously, I spin, the door is still there. Spin, lamp, spin, window, spin, light disappears, spin, lights back, spin, chair. Perfect, I place the chair underneath the red door and stand atop it. WHAM, as soon as I stand on the chair, my body slams against the wall as if the room rotated. The room did rotate, the chair once on the wall is now on the newly made floor, the fake window at my feet, and the door staring at me stuck on the floor.
 
​Finally, a way out, I get back up on my feet and head towards the red door. Dread fills me as I reach for the doorknob. I’ve studied this room for as long as I can remember, I know how it works, isn’t this what you wanted? Whatever is beyond this door is new, different, a new learning curve. It could be dangerous. I should stay. I need to stay. 

This room is all there is. Everything I need. Comfort. Safety. I let go of the doorknob, making my decision. What? I’ve got to get out of here, what am I talking about? I grab the doorknob again, that feeling returning in full force. DANGER, FEAR, ANGER, SADNESS, every emotion filling my mind until it bursts. Like a water balloon filling up to the point of popping. I feel my brain scream in terror as it splits apart unable to intake all these different thoughts. 

I let go of the doorknob after what feels like forever. Peace, serenity, silence fills the room again. Trapped or lost, the concept beckons to me as I stare at this door so smugly standing in front of me. The offering of an escape from a place so unknown and foreign, it’s a poison apple looking so sweet and enticing. After trying everything I could think of, I finally accept my situation. 

No matter what I do whether grabbing the doorknob through fabric, with my foot, my teeth nothing worked. I look around at my solitude, my mind telling me it’s been a few hours, but my stomach says it’s been weeks. How did I get here? What did I do wrong? I finally opened up and tried out life’s excitement and its only put me more into my isolation. 

Some would say this is exactly what I wanted, that feeling of the danger and adventure. But this isn’t adventure “IT’S A GOD DAMN ROOM” I scream out, smashing the fluorescent bulb on the wall. It shatters into a cloud of dust, and I pull my shirt over my face as a temporary mask. As the dust settles, I notice a doorknob on the wall in the empty spot where the fluorescent bulb used to be.
 
​I reach for the doorknob, the cold metal embracing my hand. Nothing, just me in here this time. Twisting the doorknob, I hear a *click* *clack* *crack*. The doorknob slips from my hand as the wall falls forward. Instantly I’m back in my body, in a room I don’t recognize. 

Laying on a couch, I notice the same lights and music as the club before. I get up, feeling the stretch of a thousand-year slumber. According to the clock on the wall, I’ve only been in here for five minutes. That can’t be right? A quick study of my surroundings shows no one in sight. A mini bar is planted across the room from me with a door sitting heavily next to it. 

Gathering my bearings, I place my hand on the doorknob. The floor opens up and I fall backwards into that same bland room. “FUCK!”. The missing wall is still there, but this time I actually get the chance to see through it. Carefully walking up making sure not to slip or stumble, I look over the edge of the floor. Nothing. Not nothing as in there was nothing there, there was something. 

And that something was pure unaltered nothing. A darkness so dark my eyes hurt looking at it. I slowly reach out my hand, my fingers touch something wet, and I recoil away from the wall. Looking down at my fingers reveal an inky black oil that’s recoiled with me. Out of the corner of my eye I swear I saw something move in this substance. 

I look around, but as I do each wall behind me not in my field of view disappears. Replaced by the ink or whatever it is. Nothing is left but the floor. The ink begins to ripple slowly at first and then all at once. Whatever thing I tainted the home of with my hand is not happy. “This cant be happening!”

​Suddenly, hands burst out of the ink. Then legs, and then suddenly full humanoid creatures walk out of the ink. Backing away, I realize they are coming from all sides when one grabs my shoulder. The ink burns its way into my skin with a hot chemical feeling. I punch the creatures’ stomach only for my hand to give way and pass through it, leaving more burns on my arm. 

With my one free hand, I swing for the creature’s temple. My fist makes contact with a hard substance, throwing the creature off balance. Finally broken free, I back up closer into the middle of the room. They come from all sides, their melting faces with a mix of ink and a deep red blood spilling down their heads fills my vision as they get closer. 

I look around for something, anything I can use to escape. Theres nothing but ceiling and floor and 20 to 30 of these things coming at me. As they get closer, I fight, my fist connects with a couple sculls before they overwhelm me. Grabbing at my clothes, hair, skin, dragging me towards the ink wall with each touch burning more than the last. No matter the pain, my instinctual need to live keeps me punching and kicking.
 
​With useless spasms, I kick all the way to the ink wall. Each blow going right through each creature. I feel my lower body become engulfed with the ink wall, burning and then completely numb. I try to grab onto anything flailing my last free arm wildly with no purchase until my vision disappears and the only feeling I have is in my fingertips. 

As soon as my fingers breach the ink I wake up. Blinking my confusion away, I find myself on the floor in front of a door in a pink and blue LED room. The minibar sitting next to me. Using the minibar as a crutch, I pick myself up off the floor and study my surroundings. Still in the club. This cant be happening.
