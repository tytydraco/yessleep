Hi lovely folks of r/medical_advice,

I know this is a long shot, but my mom went missing last night after posting in this sub. If you know anything about her whereabouts, could you please get in touch? My dad and I are worried that she might have suffered a mental break.

Here’s her post from last night:

**Papercuts that stop bleeding?**

\*Don’t stop bleeding, sorry!!

I feel sort of silly asking about this, but I got a papercut this morning, and it isn’t closing up. I had to put a bandaid over it when making DD her lunch so I wouldn’t get red smears on the bread. LOL! Has this happened to anyone else?

Edit: To answer a few questions:

* The cut is across the first knuckle of my right pointer finger. It’s about 1cm long.
* No, I don’t know how I got it.
* DD = Dear Daughter. Thank you to the few commenters who asked about this without being RUDE :)

Edit: I just noticed another cut. I was cooking dinner, so maybe I got myself with the knife? This one runs along one of the lines on my palm. The heart line, I think. I can see a few droplets of blood along it.

Edit: Actually, I think those of you who said that my skin is cracking due to the dry air are right. I got a third cut, across my wrist. This time I KNOW I didn’t do anything, because it appeared out of nowhere while I was watching TV. I had to wrap my wrist in a towel because it was starting to drip blood onto the couch.

Edit: Stop telling me to go to the ER!! I’m not letting them pump me full of poison for a few papercuts. LOL!

Edit: I’m sorry to anyone who felt my last edit was rude. Not everyone gets my humor, ok? But please, can someone give me a NATURAL, HOME remedy for this??

Edit: This is getting weird. I felt something wet on my face, so I went to look at myself in the mirror. More cuts have opened up at the outer corners of my eyes, and blood is running down my cheeks.

But the weirdest part was DD’s reaction. She’s only seven, and a very gentle soul, so I was worried that she’d be scared. Instead, she laughed when she saw me. Then she said in this singsong voice that didn’t even sound like her, “Deeper, deeper cuts the knife. Naught can stop the press of time.” Now she’s sitting in the corner, giggling and repeating that freaky rhyme over and over again.

Edit: Haha, guys, stop scaring me with that crap about all of the cuts being along creases in my skin. I have creases everywhere, even on my neck. LOL!

That’s the end of the post.

Again, if you know anything, please, please message me. It’s important that we find my mom quickly, given her clearly deteriorating mental state. I don’t have a sister.
