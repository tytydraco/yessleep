this is a reupload of something i posted on r/creepypasta 

I remember when i younger about 11-12 I used to go to the park ever 1–2 weeks with my parents. And for clarity, I'm a single child with my cousins living abroad I won't specify my name as this story is very personal, and I don't want someone to trace it back to me as this only happened a couple of years ago (I am now 15 years old) I lived in northern California, and as I previously stated I went to the park 1-2 a week with my parents and I didn't have many friends nor brother's though I still had a passion for soccer which we all played in PE class so once when I was practicing playing alone some older kids 13–14 years old approached me and said something along the lines of “Yo wanna play with us? One of our players, who was a striker, moved away to Idaho, so can you fill in for him?” Of course as the loner I was i accepted. But i soon realized there was something Odd about these kids, first and foremost they were massive for their age about 6 feet (1.83 m) the shortest one and the tallest about 6'5 (2 m) which I guess i could've rounded up to genes or something.

 Second of all, they were extremely strong, and that isn't even an exaggeration because i remember once a kid kicked a ball so hard that the net broke, And also when i asked for their names they always told me weird names not to judge, but their names were something like Joe Bob or Billy Mike or something to that equivalent of that. And that also i could've summed up to a prank or some twisted shit like that, but what happened next no one could've explained. One day in October i it was about evening, i was playing again and stole the ball and scored a goal and said some dumb shit to the goalie like “Damn your trash“ or something like that and he stared at me point blank and i dont know if i was imagining it but his eyes turned pure black i managed a nervous giggle and looked around and all of their eyes were black

(By this point it was about night) so i ran, I ran like i never did before but as i mentioned before they were strong so while i was running i dared to look back and say them chasing me, their legs were becoming longer they were becoming faster but still i ran i ran back to my home and locked the door i looked through the peep hole and they were not their i didnt go to the park the next week or the next in fear of seeing them but finally my parents forced me to come along i was in constant fear but i never saw them again. After about an year we moved away due to unrelated reasons and i never quite over the fear of them finding me
