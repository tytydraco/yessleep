 

She had just finished her shift at the local diner and was walking home. It was a dark and stormy night, her umbrella barely keeping the rain off of her. She always hated walking home at night, especially when the weather was bad, but she needed the money and couldn't afford a car for the time.

As she walked, she noticed a figure in the distance, standing under a streetlight. It looked like a man, but she couldn't make out any details through the rain. She tried to ignore him and quickened her pace, but as she got closer, she realized that he was staring directly at her soul, not just her eyes.

She felt a chill run down her spine as she walked past him, and she was sure that he was following her. She turned around, but the figure was gone.

Suddenly, She heard footsteps behind her, and she broke into a run. She could hear the man getting closer and closer, his footsteps pounding on the pavement. Her heart was racing, and she was almost out of breath when she finally made it to her front door.

She fumbled with her keys, trying to get the door open as quickly as possible, but the strange man was almost upon her. She finally managed to get the door open and slammed it shut behind her, leaning against it as something was scratching the door as a desperate dog was trying to get inside its house.

But as she caught her breath, she realized that something else was wrong. After the scratching stopped the house suddenly became too quiet. Too still. And then she heard it: a faint whispering sound, coming from somewhere deep within the house.

She tried to convince herself that she was just imagining things, but the whispers continued, growing louder and more insistent. She slowly made her way through the house, searching for the source of the sound.

As she approached the basement door, the whispers grew louder and more frantic. She hesitated, but curiosity got the better of her, and she slowly opened the door and creeped inside.

What she saw inside the basement was beyond her worst nightmares. It was a dark, twisted world of horror and despair, nothing her simple human brain could even imagine. A world populated by shadowy figures and grotesque monsters. And at the center of it all was the figure of the man from the street, watching her with his cold expresion, and dead eyes just like before right into the soul.

She tried to run, but the figure was too fast. He caught her, dragging her back into this hell of a place that nothing but demons could escape. She screamed and fought, but it was no use. The power of the devil was too strong for her to stand up for herself, and so the darkness consumed her, and she was lost forever.

And so, to this day, the whispers can still be heard, echoing through the night. The figure still lurks in the shadows, waiting for his next victim. And her fate serves as a warning to all those who dare to walk alone at night.
