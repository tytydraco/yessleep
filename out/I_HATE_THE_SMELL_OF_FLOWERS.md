Have you ever been afraid? Not like hearing noises in the kitchen afraid, but like real fear, palpitations, cold sweat running down your spine, every single hair in your body standing up telling you that something is wrong, telling you to run as fast as you can and never look back. Well I thought I´d felt it, I was wrong, I´d never felt real fear, that is until I met her.

To put you in context I´m a nurse, I work PICU in a big hospital in mi city, you could say I´m fairly new, a little bit under 3 years working my first job, one could say it has been a good experience overall, I mean every job has its ups and downs but to me at least it's been more ups than downs. I´d say I was happy with my life, just got my own apartment, nice boyfriend, cool friends, everything was going great.  

Sara was what you could call a little bit of an odd one, that didn´t bother me, I´ve always thought of myself as someone who is awkward, it´s never been easy for me to make friends, so when the new girl needed to be oriented I was the first one to offer to show her around. The first few shifts were pretty standard, a few kids with the flu, one or two convulsions, nothing out of the ordinary, Sara seemed to be doing good, she learned fast, and was very sweet with the children, I really thought she was a good person and a more than competent nurse.

It was during night shift, everything was quiet, the smell of bleach and isopropyl alcohol filled the nurse´s station, the 4 patients we had were stable and sleeping, the cleaning lady was mopping the floor and Sara and I were just talking about life, thinking of going out for a drink or something on our day off. That’s when the phone started to ring and it happened, it's really hard for me to describe it because I've never seen anything quite like it, Sara´s eyes widened, and the look on her face, it was just wrong, you know that uncanny valley thing? Like something looks human but your brain knows it's not, well in a matter of seconds her face went from normal to completely wrong, her whole demeanor changed, it was as if she knew something was bad coming, and she was excited, like she was waiting for it, she had this, this evil grim, her smile seemed so big, like abnormally big, her teeth extremely white, inhuman even, her breathing started to get louder and faster, it was this awful sound, more like a growling, I was so scared, but I couldn’t move, I knew I had to run but it was like I was bolted to my chair, in that moment she picked up the phone, and her face went back to normal. 

She handed it to me “It's for you”, it was the ER nurse telling me there was a patient that was coming up, that she was stabilized but still in bad condition. We got everything ready as fast as we could and then she arrived, her name was Katie, she was 6 years old, she´d been sick for days, nausea, vomiting and fever which lead to a bad case of dehydration which made her start convulsing, that’s when her grandmother called the ambulance. 

She arrived and everything was quite standard, and even though she was acting like nothing happened  I couldn’t stop thinking about Sara´s face, the look of pure evil she had, a part of me thought I had imagined it, everything happened so fast and the lack of sleep may do things to your brain, but I knew it was real, I knew there was something wrong. 

We were done with Katie and called for her family member to come in.  The first thing I noticed was the smell, I could only describe it as death.  There´s this phenomenon that occurs when a patient dies, a sudden smell of flowers fills the room and you just know that the person is no longer with us, that was how it smelled  when she came in, like flowers but in the worst possible way you can imagine. Then I saw her, at this time of the night you would expect her to be a mess, maybe crying, scared, filled with anguish, messy hair and pajamas, but she looked completely fine, almost happy, it felt so wrong. She looked young, like weirdly young to be a grandmother, she was dressed in all black, high hills, full face of makeup, and her blonde hair seemed like it had just come out of the salon, it was so weird, I mean who looks like that in the middle of the night when your granddaughter had just had a seizure. I explained to her that Katie was stable but still very delicate,  told her she could stay with her the whole time Katie was hospitalized and asked if she had any questions, she just gave me a look that left me paralyzed, as if  I wasn’t allowed to move until she said so, it was like time sat still and all I could do was just stare at her eyes, those dead eyes, then she nodded and took a seat next to her granddaughter. 

I went to the bathroom and washed my face, I had to compose myself and go back to work, but I couldn’t, I was so scared, I felt so alone.  I started to cry, I tried to call my mom but there was no service. How? Just a few hours ago I was texting my boyfriend about our plans for the next morning, I knew there was good signal, what was going on? I looked at the time, how the hell was is still 4am, I remember looking at the time when the phone rang at it was just 5 minutes past 4 , I knew at least an hour had gone by since then, but it was still 4:05, what the fuck. That’s when I started hyperventilating, my hands were shaking and I could feel my heart beating faster and faster, I was trapped and knew something was very very wrong. I couldn’t escape, tears rolling down my face, all I wanted to do was just shut my eyes and wait until everything passed, that´s when Sara started knocking on the bathroom door, not like normal knocking, but like hard thumping on the door “Are you okay Jade? Do you need any help?” she was mocking me, she knew I was scared of her and whatever the other woman was, I didn’t answer, but that just made her angry, she started kicking the door harder and harder, the lights went out and Sara just kept yelling “JADE WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, OPEN THIS DOOR NOW!” I just covered my ears and hoped that the door would stand her kicking, then it stopped. 

Silence, pure silence, not a single sound, I couldn’t even hear my own breathing, had I gone deaf? Was I having some kind of manic episode? Was all this just my imagination? Was I dead? It was all darkness and silence for what felt like an eternity, and suddenly the lights came back and everything seemed to go back to “normal”. I looked myself in the mirror, I was a fucking mess I washed my face and looked at my phone, still 4:05 and no signal, shit. 

I had to make a choice, either stay here until this crazy bitch decided to star kicking the door again or go out and try to escape. I chose the second one. I broke the mirror trying not to hurt myself while doing it and hid a piece of glass in my pocket, I opened the door as slow as I could thinking Sara was waiting for me outside, but she wasn’t, I felt a sense of relief that lasted for 5 seconds, then it hit me, if she isn’t here then were the fuck is she…
