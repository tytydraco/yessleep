I can't believe I'm typing this. 


Yes. A magic 8-ball. An literal toy.


It all started three days ago. Randy and Sarah had come over to help me unload all my stuff to the new apartment. It's been a difficult process, I'm not gonna lie. This was my first big step, first time walking down Independence Avenue, and the guys have been my rock through all this, since I lost my family...


What a great start to adulthood.


We somehow found ourselves rummaging through a box labeled "Memories", things from my past I didn't feel like throwing away. That's where we found it. 


"Yo, what is that?" Randy lifted the eightball out of the box and started examining it with his fingers.


"I think it's that thing, what do you call it, where you ask questions and you shake it and then it answers, I think."


"An eight ball Sarah, Geez", I cackled, "that thing... it's some toy garbage, not a genie in a bottle."


"But it can be".


My heart skipped a beat. I didn't know what he meant, but I had a bad feeling about it, "let's try it".


"Try what?". Sarah and I glared at each other equally confused.


Randy smirked. He cleared his throat and took up a serious expression, as if he was preparing to announce something big.


"O Grant Eightball, thou who knowest all, when is my birthday?"


The room fell silent. Then Sarah and I fell to the floor, tears welling up from laughter. 


Randy's expression changed from smug to confused in seconds. His cheeks took a warm, reddish tone the more he tried to understand what happened.


"You absolute idiot!", Sarah managed to mutter between cackles, wiping tears from her eyes, while I was still trying to catch a breath.


"What?", Randy was still confused as hell.


"You're supposed to ask yes or no questions only, bro...", I said when I finally got my shit together, "it's not a physic medium".


Before I could finish, Sarah grabbed the ball from his hands. 


"Is it October 26, 2025 today?"


She shook it a couple of times and left it on the floor. Then, she turned to Randy, eyes big and a smile bigger, almost stretching to her ears, "See? That's how its done."


"Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's see what it said now."


We all gathered in a circle, our heads hovering above the blue light the little screen emitted. The silence was so loud I could hear the beat of my own heat. Finally, an answer formed.


Y E S


We stared at each other for a while. An uneasy knot started to form in my stomach, a subtle nudge that something was off. 


"HA!", Sarah exclaimed, throwing her hands in the air. 


She was having a blast with that thing. She kept on asking questions for the next five minutes. Things like her phone number, about her family, her sister... 


Not a single wrong answer.


However, one conversation made my skin crawl.


"Is there life after death?"


Y O U   M A Y   R E L Y   O N   I T


"So," she turned to me with a wholesome smile, "does this mean your mom watching over you from somewhere?"


A knot formed in my throat and the seconds felt like hours.


D E F I N A T E L Y   N O T


Sarah's face immediately dropped. All the color drained from her face as she continued,


"What do you mean, you said there's life after death!"


D E F I N I T E L Y   S O


"So ghosts are real?"


V E R Y   D O U B T F U L


"Is there anything other than ghosts?"


Y E S


"Worse?"


W I T H O U T   A    D O U B T 


We sat in silence for a long while. The atmosphere grew heavier and thicker. Cold sweat dripped down my forehead, and I felt a pair of eyes burning at the back of my neck. 


"Right, yeah, gimme that, my turn", I quickly snapped out of whatever got into me.


I closed my eyes and asked, "Is my TV on right now?"


Y E S


I felt my heart sink to my stomach for a second. I didn't remember. Did I really leave it on?

I stood up and went to check. Black screen.


"See? I told you guys, this is bullshit.", I sighed, tossing the ball on the floor.


Then I heard a clicking sound.


I held my breath, frozen, staring at Randy and Sarah with my eyes wide, too afraid to move a finger.


The TV static echoed in the silent house.


As I reached for the remote to turn it off, I heard Sarah exclaim from the other room:


"Okay okay, last question, let's see what happens. Eightball, when am I going to die?"


My fight or flight told me to run, run as fast as i can, but I stayed there, paralyzed, unable to move or scream. 


B E T T E R    N O T    A N S W E R    N O W


"I mean, I wasn't expecting anything better. Oh well... Well, time to get out of here, no sense in dragging this any more". She said it so casually, so calmly, so...


So naturally.


Sarah was found dead in her home the next day. The cops said it's nothing like they'd ever seen. Sat on the couch, in front of a TV turned to static, with a huge grin on her face, almost maniac. There was blood kn her hands and a note crumbled up:


O U T L O O K    N O T    S O    G O O D


I never opened that box again after that day. Nor did I ever hear from Randy again. 


Only sometimes, when I sit alone in my apartment, I can hear the TV static from the other room, and a faint, blue glow is coming from the closet..."
