She was small, about five years old. Long, straight blonde hair. Skin so pale that the sun instantly left marks on it, and those cheeks that blushed with an ease that always touched me. His eyes... green like wet glass. Brilliant. Innocents I loved her more than I know how to express.

I lost her in an instant. It vanished as if the world had decided to rip it away from me without explanation. From then on I was the only one left, despair and a frozen town where every street seemed to repeat my misfortune. Breathing hurt. Thinking hurt more.

Then Donato called me. He said he knew where it was.
"Don't tell the police," he warned me. The woman who has it… is not from here. It is not of this world.
His voice was hollow. It sounded like someone who had already decided to give myself over to something I didn't want to name.

I went without waiting. Fear didn't stop me; He pushed me.

The house was on the outskirts, where not even the crows perch. A dark wooden mansion, cracked, sunk in years of mold. The garden seemed alive, full of weeds that writhed like sick snakes. Everything smelled of damp wood and something older… something rancid, ancestral, that had not been born from anything human.

She lived there.

A woman—or what was left of one—with black hair stuck to her body like a slimy shadow. His face was a mask of wrinkles that did not mark age, but condemnation. But the worst thing was his eyes: hollow, ancient, as if a nameless animal lived inside.

He didn't talk to me. He didn't even look at me like an enemy. He looked at me like an object. Like something already used.

I didn't see who he called. I only felt hands, silhouettes, bodies that had no shape or weight. They blew dust on my face. It entered my lungs like a burning swarm. They didn't kill me. Worse: they emptied me. They left me conscious, a prisoner in myself, without voice or will.

And while I became a living doll, the witch sold my daughter.

The man who came had an expensive suit, cold hands, and an even colder soul.
—Any health problem? -asked.
"Just a little asthma," she lied, smiling cruelly.

He handed my daughter… and a small jar. “Medicine,” he called it. But I knew what it was. It was what had turned me into a servant without a will. Which would turn it into an obedient, silent body, perfect for disappearing.

I couldn't move. Nor scream. Nor die.

Since then I have taken care of the garden. There are no bars or chains, but I don't need any to stay here. I pull weeds over and over again. They grow back in a few hours, thicker, harder, as if they were feeding on something that should not exist. Sometimes they creak, as if they contain small bones.

She is no longer there. I don't know if he left, or if he just changed his form. But the garden continues to grow.
And every now and then, when the sun goes down, I feel the roots move.

I believe…I believe that when a new grass is born, a new soul has been planted.
I think there are parents who never knew where to look.

I know this because, every so often, I hear Donato's voice on the other side of the rusty fence.
Whisper my name.

And bring another father.
