I held the phone up to my head with the arm that was not as injured and heard a panicked voice call out on the line.

“Help, there is a fire here and we are stuck in the building.” A brief coughing fit interrupted the caller, no doubt due to smoke inhalation. I could hear an inferno in the background and they continued.

“My name is Kylie Burke and I am a secretary at the Hope for the Future research center on 311 Lang street. We don’t know what happened but a fire broke out and someone blocked the exits. We are stuck in here, we tried breaking the door down but we can’t and it is getting hot to the touch. Help us! We are going to die unless you send the fire department now, please help!”

I was not sure how I was going to stop a fire, but I would have to do something to prevent it in the first place. It sounded like details were scarce and I was trying to think of what else to ask, to see if any more info could be gleaned when I heard the static and the panicked,

“Hell...o......plea.....hel.....us” A loud crash signaled the end of the call and the line was dead again. I had to find that building and do something to stop that fire, I did not know how many people were in that building besides Kylie but it could be dozens or even hundreds and they were likely all stuck and would be burned alive. My mind raced, lots of things could start a fire, but I considered the blocked doors and the situation stank of some malicious influence. It might even be the same person who has been committing all of the other future crimes, so far, he has been at every event and my gut convinced me that he would be there and he would likely be the one starting the fire.

I pocketed my phone and tried to rise but my whole body ached from being beaten almost lifeless. The shock and adrenaline of the fight and answering another call was starting to subside and I was finally feeling just how injured I really was. As I tried to stand up, I fell back down with a shock that made my body writhe in pain. Just then the woman I had saved from the attack earlier came back in and tried to help me. Her initial concern must have abated when she saw me try and defend her, though she still had a somewhat doubtful look on her face when dealing with me. She did seem to want to help now and said,

“I am sorry, I can't get a hold of anyone, this place became a dead zone all of the sudden and I can't get the police or an ambulance here. It seems like you really need some medical attention. Thank you for stopping that man, but who was he and how did you know he was coming for me?”

The question was a good one and I struggled to come up with an answer that she would believe since I couldn't exactly tell her I got a call from the future where she was likely dead.

“Oh I don’t know who he was, but I saw him creeping around and thought he might be up to something when I saw him come in here. I am sorry for scaring you earlier.”

I introduced myself and she did the same. I learned her name was Bianca Sinclair and she was a researcher at the Hope for the Future. That name was cropping up a lot, I wondered if maybe M was targeting people who worked there for some reason. This many employees being potential victims, it couldn't be a coincidence. I remembered what M said about how I should, “consider who you are really saving and why?” I needed to get more information about what these people were doing and why they might be targeted.

We moved out of the restroom and to a bench where we could await some help. The whole rest stop seemed to have no traffic today so no one else came through to assist. The emergency line was still out and Bianca was unable to call out to any other lines. We had been waiting so long it had been almost an hour and we finally flagged someone else down. As soon as the woman approached us and she spoke I recognized the voice as the one from the call and I knew I had met Stacy Thomas. After introducing ourselves, Stacy had offered to go get help for us, but I did not have time to spend at the hospital despite my injuries so I declined. I did ask her why she was heading into town and apparently, she had been coming this way to visit her family. It turned out her brother had just been killed and she was going to be with her family to mourn his loss.

I realized my hunch was likely confirmed but just to make sure I asked what his name was and when she told me I felt a wave of realization and despair. His name was Calvin Thomas and he had been struck by a car and killed while cycling at night yesterday. As I was mulling in my own sense of sadness and defeat at the memory of how my actions had inadvertently led to his death, Bianca perked up at the mention of the name.

“Calvin Thomas? You are his sister?” Stacy nodded and confirmed,

“Yes, why?”

“Well, your brother and I work together, or worked I should say, I am so sorry that is terrible what happened.”

My ears perked up and I listened to them speak more about Calvin. Now to find out he worked for the Hope for the Future foundation as well? It was all too much. Everyone I have met during this entire debacle has had some connection to this foundation, what were they anyway? I was in a unique position to find out more since some workers were here with me now. I could glean more info and maybe see what was going on. Then I could follow up tomorrow at their facility, assuming I could keep it from burning to the ground.

I tried to inquire about what sort of work the foundation did, but Bianca was tight lipped about it and Stacy indicated her brother was never forthcoming in the sort of research they did there either. Just vague statements about research and development into new technologies and some renewable energy solutions but few specifics. In the end I did not know why someone would want to kill the people who worked there. I had some suspicions that Bianca was not telling me everything though. I did not blame her; it was her work and it was private. I could not tell her what I really knew about why I thought she might be in danger, but something happened there that has made them a target for whoever, or whatever M is. I had to make do with the knowledge I had, since I had another incident to stop tomorrow.

Stacy departed as she had to get back on the road and said goodbye. Before Bianca could leave I tried to ply her with some questions about her work.

“I did have a question about the foundation, how many people worked at the Lang ave building? and is it open tomorrow?” Bianca regarded the question furtively and asked,

“Why do you want to know?” I told her,

“Well I just wanted to visit and see what sort of work is done there I am really interested in new technologies and innovation.” I was not lying at least not completely, but she had a doubtful look on her face. She tried to discourage me but I was persistent,

“Please, I am very curious and it could be a personal favor for me if you wanted to repay me for the help.” I smiled and the motion hurt my face after getting stomped recently. I could tell she felt sorry for me and relented.

“Alright I can take you on the investor tour and if anyone asks you are a new shareholder, its not open to public tourists.”

“Thank you so much! I promise I won't be any trouble.” It was sincere since if things went the right way, I would be saving her and all her coworkers from a fiery fate. I had my way in now, I just needed to ensure I could evacuate those people on time or stop the first in the first place. Since I couldn't bring a fire engine to the site, I would have to make due with a visit at around the time shortly before the call. I needed to stop the fire before it happened.

The next morning Bianca and I set out to the foundation. She spoke a little more on what they did and the answers were not something I suspected. It sounded like some sort of sci fi movie premise, but the Hope for Future foundation was actually trying to research Tachyons and the potential to send things forward or backward in time. I thought she was joking with me but when I started to laugh, I saw the look of genuine sincerity and my jaw almost hit the floor. I wondered just then if I should tell her about the phone? If she knew maybe she could figure out how it's happening and why to me? It could not be a coincidence I get embroiled with some futuristic foundation that can send things through time and I just so happen to start receiving calls from the future. I decided to ask her something , trying not to give away too much,

“I know you probably could not confirm to the public but, has anyone really done it? I mean sent an object back in time?” She looked uncomfortable and responded with a curt,

“That is classified and why do you ask?”

“Just curious. I was also wondering if something like a phone or computer could be used to send a message from a different time to now using that method. Would that be possible?” Her eyes narrowed and I was afraid a said too much.

“That is a very specific suggestion, why would you think that is something we could do?” I just mumbled a feigned excuse under my breath and then pointed to the building we were approaching like an impatient child and asked,

“Is that it?” Hoping it would change the subject from my all too specific question. She nodded and looked away, clearly not fully trusting my distraction but too polite to grill me on it. We had indeed made it to the foundation. Bianca parked and we got out and headed for the entrance. The building and attached grounds were massive and I thought there might be around one hundred or so staff members. I had to find a way to stop that fire. She led us through the main doors and got me a visitor pass and I attached the card to my shirt. She told me upfront that over two thirds of the complex were off limits to visitors and we would mostly be viewing office space and some of the nearly complete energy projects. She also insisted in no uncertain terms to,

“Not bring up any of the tachyon research or time travel in general.” She said it could get her in big trouble if they found out she told someone outside the company. I promised to keep that information to myself and thanked her again for taking me to visit. I stayed vigilant about the time and where we were. I saw fire suppression sprinklers and wondered if somehow the arsonist had tampered with them and that is how it failed to put the fire out before it spread. More and more I felt I would need to try and stop this before it happened, if it spread, I did not know how I would keep everyone safe.

We were walking down a corridor to the next section of the tour when a group of researchers in hazmat suits walked past us. I wouldn't have thought anything of it but I felt a strong static discharge around me as one of them passed by. My phone was vibrating too and an all too familiar unsettling buzz was in the air. I looked back and I saw one of the hazmat suit wearing scientists break off from the group and I saw the glimmer of a strange hazy aura around their covered face.

My heart sank, he was here. I stopped walking and Bianca looked back, wondering why I had paused.

“What is it, what’s wrong?” I did not know what to do or say, I could not explain it but I somehow knew that was him, that was M. I couldn't tell Bianca yet but I had to come up with something. I decided I would have to lie for the greater good.

“I, I think I smell smoke, I think there’s a fire!” She looked around and back at me and said,

“I don’t smell anything, what are you doing, don’t make a scene you are going to get me in trouble.” It was too late to go back now, I screamed, “Fire!” at the top of my lungs and to my fortune I found a discreetly placed fire alarm on the wall and with one apologetic look back to Bianca whose face had turned red with embarrassment on my behalf, I threw the switch and the building came alive with the blaring of the fire alarm.

An automated evacuation PA system informed us how to affect the buildings evacuation in a timely and orderly fashion. Maintenance and security officers were running through the halls trying to find the source of the fire. When we got outside Bianca pulled me off to the side away from the larger groups of employees evacuating and half scream, half whispered,

“What the hell was that? Did you seriously have me take you here just to pull a prank on my entire workplace? Why did you do that? If they find out it was you and I let you in I could be fired” She was fuming and understandably so, I realized I would have to tell her the truth and hopefully, considering her unique perspective she would believe me.

“I promise I had a good reason, there was a fire, or rather there was going to be a fire. I know because I received an emergency phone call from the office's secretary Kylie Burke about a huge fire breaking out and the staff being locked inside somehow.

I saw Bianca eyes flash with recognition when I mentioned the name, but she still looked incredulous.

“Why would she call you, a stranger about an emergency and not the fire department? And also there is clearly no fire here now, so how and why would anyone think there was?”

I steeled myself to reveal the full truth and tried my best to not look as crazy as I felt.

“Because it has not happened yet, and I think I may have just stopped it. I think I did because the call about the fire came yesterday shortly after we met. Just like a call warning me you would be attacked in that bathroom, it came a day before it happened. I know it sounds crazy but,” I pulled out my broken phone to illustrate the point,

“I have been getting 911 calls from people for emergencies that will happen exactly twenty four hours after the call.” I saw a mixture of emotions on her face, she clearly considered this and what I had said earlier about devices traveling through time. Then there was the nature of research they were doing there, she paused while processing all of this bizarre story. As she was about to respond to my insane confession the phone vibrated and right on time always after the dust had settled, a message had arrived in the inbox of my phone. I told Bianca to stand close and look at the message before it disappeared.

“Well then, good job you finally got the jump on me. Nice work with the alarm, threw this place into a preemptive fire panic. I could still get a few of them if I went through with it but not as effective now. I bet you are feeling proud of yourself aren't you? Think you saved so many people? You bought them time, that’s all. If you knew the true scope of what they have done here you might not be so quick to play the role of savior. Nevertheless, well played, no collateral even. You are almost there, keep your eyes open and be ready for what happens next. -M”

I felt anxiety bubbling at the threat of what happens next, but I looked at Bianca whose was scrutinizing the message and then watched in confusion as the message vanished shortly afterward leaving no trace and no UI on screen to even attempt to look for it again, just dead black. I tried to break the ice on her confused state of bewilderment by stating that,

“That person messages me after every event, they seem to be setting this all up like some weird test but I don’t know to what end. The victims have almost been exclusively people who work at this foundation, do you have any idea who might be targeting researchers here at your work?” Bianca considered the question and then as if mulling over the message in her mind a bit more I heard her mumble,

“M, no it couldn't be.” She turned back to me and flatly stated,

“We need to talk, I think I know what could be happening and if he is still alive no one here is safe anymore.”

My mind raced and my heart rose, she knew something and maybe we could put a stop to this insanity after all. I leaned forward and eagerly said,

“Tell me everything.”
