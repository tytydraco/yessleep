My wife says it happens to everyone. She jokes it's the ghosts of the ants we've stepped on when walking, the beetles and cockroaches we've thrown slippers at in our bathrooms. I've read about it on forums too, many people experience it.

Sometimes, we get this weird tingly feeling that there's an insect on us but there really isn't.

I'm not a believer of anything unworldly. I don't believe in the paranormal, in heaven or hell, or even in God. I don't believe in fate, and I don't believe in luck.

But it is no longer a matter of belief. I can't deny what I feel. I wish I knew why I felt it, why I can feel them constantly, running up and down, up and down. All over my body. My hair, my face, my torso, legs... everything. Every single inch of my skin feels as if covered with them.

It started off easy. I was on the brink of sleep, tired from work that day and exhausted at the thought of work the day after.

That was when I felt it.

It felt like a small insect crawling on my left hand's little finger. I tried using my other hand to swat it away, still half asleep, but it still kept crawling. Annoyed, I switched on the light, bringing up my hand to look at it properly.

There was nothing.

I could feel it crawling, only from the tip of my finger to the base, never leaving those bounds. I stared at my hand, blinking rapidly. Nothing was there. I shook my wife awake, who upon hearing my words (half asleep herself) brushed it off tell me it was nothing and to go back to bed.

But I couldn't just ignore it. I tried laying back down, but it wouldn't stop. Throughout the night, I could not sleep. I had hoped it would stop eventually, maybe once I got to work...

But when it didn't leave for a week, I got worried. I called up my brother, who though not a doctor, had studied to be one a few years ago. He assured me it was nothing and that human bodies were weird in that way.

I tried, I really did try to ignore it and go about my life. I went to another doctor when I couldn't take it anymore, but when even they said I was fine, I refused to let it go on.

I cut off my finger.

It was only a finger; I was a construction worker, I'd faced worse injuries.

It was peaceful. So very peaceful.

I should've known, it wouldn't stop there. The next day I felt them on my right pinkie, then every single one of my fingers, my hands, my arms, my legs. No matter how hard I try, what I cut or what I amputate, they're always there. Up and down, Up and down.

I feel them running up and down my neck now. My wife holds onto my arm, the one that still remains, begging through her tears for me to stop, to seek help.

I push her away. They can't help. Nobody can help. They'll keep crawling, always.

Up and down, Up and down.

I bring the knife to my throat; maybe now they will finally stop.
