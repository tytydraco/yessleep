I’ve always measured myself in numbers. Scores, rankings, test results, simulations—the cold arithmetic of performance. Spaceflight was my language. I hit the top of my class in orbital mechanics, EVA procedures, life-support diagnostics, and thermal suit endurance. They told me I was ready—though “ready” is a relative term when you’re about to leave Earth behind.

The launch facility smelled of jet fuel and antiseptic, oddly comforting. I adjusted my gloves, feeling the tension in the fabric, the subtle hum of the life-support systems. Joseph—Joey—stood at the pre-flight bay, arms crossed, a grin tugging at his lips.

“Relax, Mark,” he said, casual, though the tight line in his jaw betrayed him. “You’re in. Nerves don’t break now.” “I’m not scared,” I said. He sighed. “Fourth person to say that. Somehow, it always gets heavier once you’re up there. Remember that.”

I scanned the crew. Randall, our engineer, hunched over a tablet, muttering specs. Sarah, the medical officer, brushed the Greek navy insignia on her chest, eyes flicking toward the cabin doors. Burke scribbled frantically. Nancy tapped at her console, confirming channels. Mr. Walter hovered near prototype gear, adjusting straps like his life depended on it—which, frankly, it did.

“Extreme caution,” he warned, pressing a hand against my suit. “Even a centimeter misaligned compromises the seals. One false move, and this is useless. Understand?” “I understand,” I said, squaring my shoulders.

Joey patted me on the back. “Let’s board and get you to orbit. Captain’s waiting at the station. Docking’s on us—you focus on not flinching when the engines rumble.” He raised his voice to the crew: “Let’s roll out!”

The countdown was procedural—three hours strapped in while systems were checked and rechecked.

“Space center, mission control. Nancy Bunch. Do you copy?” “Copy. All good down here.”

I settled in as cockpit switches clicked into place. Nerves trickled in despite my calm face. The orbital hatch sealed; pressure tests hissed in my ears. The others seemed unfazed, as if this were a long car ride.

The crew sat, suits pressurized, breathing shallowly. The cabin was dim except for the glow of flight displays.

“T-minus ten minutes,” Joey crackled. “Fuel cells conditioned, power-up complete, guidance and nav aligned. All systems green.”

Heart thrumming. Burke scribbled one last note. Sarah brushed the chest patch. Randall muttered a checklist item.

“T-minus one minute. Range go. Weather go.”

The vehicle hummed, alive. My gloved hands clenched.

“Ten… nine… three, two, one—ignition.”

Fire and sound consumed the world. The seat shoved me into the back as if the rocket wanted to crush me flat.

The violence of ascent pinned me. The roar outside wasn’t sound—it was pressure, a thunder that rattled through bone and blood. Visor fogged at the edges. Cabin shook. Load climbed—two, three, four times normal. Every breath a struggle. Every muscle screamed.

At two minutes, the sharp crack of separation jolted us. Solid rocket boosters peeled away, tumbling in the plasma glow. The ride smoothed slightly. Main engines clawed higher, faster.

Joey: “Booster sep confirmed. Engines up.” Randall: “Main engines holding. External tank pressure nominal.”

The sky shifted from cobalt to black. Stars stabbed the void. At eight and a half minutes, engines throttled down, then cut. Silence. Weight vanished. Arms drifted in straps. External tank released, sliding to burn in the upper atmosphere. Earth rolled beneath us, a curved horizon of oceans and clouds.

Joey broke the spell. “Rookie, welcome to orbit. Don’t get dreamy.”

RCS thrusters online. Guidance confirmed for insertion trajectory. Sarah: “Life support steady. Vitals within limits.” Mr. Walter hovered. “Suit integrity clean. Don’t slack.” “Copy,” I said. Silence of space heavier than launch’s roar. Beneath procedure, one thought pressed: we had made it off Earth. The real test awaited.

⸻

Descent was nothing like launch. Liftoff was fire and violence; landing was silence and calculation. The orbiter drifted into lunar orbit. Earth shrank to a pale coin. Randall and Joey armed descent engines.

“Guidance locked. Descent initiation in three… two…” Main engine pulsed, slowing orbital speed. Moon’s gravity gripped us.

Altitude ticked down. At fifteen kilometers, lander separated, thrusters nudging position. Burke muttered corrections. Randall trimmed controls. Dust plumes scattered as descent engine throttled.

“Three hundred meters… two-fifty… two hundred,” Nancy relayed. Final flare brought us onto the regolith, pads settling with a muted crunch. We were no longer falling.

Landing checks began immediately. Joey powered down propulsion. Randall ran sweeps. Sarah checked oxygen and med kit. Mr. Walter hovered, double-checking my prototype suit.

“This isn’t just gear,” he said, tugging the wrist joint. “This is your lifeline. No move without confirming every seal.”

He ran diagnostics: dual-sensor array, thermal imaging, low-frequency acoustic pickup. Tear-mitigation polymer lining. HUD guidance overlay pointing to the anomaly crater. Emergency anomaly protocol switch.

“You’re first wearing this for a reason. Log everything. Hit the switch if something actively anomalous shows. Extraction routine will engage. Don’t hesitate.”

“Copy,” I said. My voice cracked, but firm enough. I knew what I signed up for—where exploration met sacrifice.

⸻

Descent to the far side was rougher than expected. Corrections rattled bones. Instruments flickered. Breath fogged helmet. Skids touched down; silence heavy, absolute.

I stepped out, boots crunching dark regolith. Floodlight cut a thin slice. Shadow swallowed the rest.

I stumbled over something half-buried. Not rock. A helmet cam. ID legible. Stowed it and pressed on.

Then I saw it. A silhouette at the crater lip. Upright. Full EVA suit. Hands at its sides. Visor dark.

No thermal reading. No life trace. Just standing.

Badge number different from the cam’s. Whoever this was, it wasn’t her.

Comms crackled. Crew voices tense. Sarah breathing quick. Randall cursing. Burke demanding I secure the suit.

Dragging it was brutal. Far heavier than it should be. Stiff, unyielding, brittle beneath fabric. Sweat streamed. Muscles screamed. Arms felt wrong. A faint “poking” resistance beneath the surface, like hardened blood separated from flesh.

By the lander, the body was secured in cargo. Yet its presence lingered, a shadow inside the cabin. Every engine shudder vibrated through it, through me.

Docking. Crew waiting. Burke already suited, sterilized equipment laid out. Body wheeled into isolation, glass and locks sealing it.

Captain John exhaled. “Well… looks like we’ve got a lead. Not the kind you want to shake hands with, but progress.”

Nervous chuckles. Recording queued. Screen alive. Static cleared. Helmet cam: astronaut walking regolith.

“Anomaly reader spiking. Large thermal presence… wall. Full spread.” Pause. “I hear it. A rumble… beneath me.”

Telemetry showed nothing. Only her voice against the void.

After, I hear her speak this sequence of words—Greek: “Tha eínai entáxei. Tha eínai entáxei.” “Oi treis peripatún.” “S’akóo.”

Camera lowered to the ground—exactly where I later found it. She walked forward, speaking until audio fractured, image froze.

Long silence.

Sarah rose, fists clenched, left.

“What… did she say?” I asked.

Nancy, pale: “Greek. Kate’s camera. ID confirms. But the body isn’t hers. Different number.”

My neck pricked. “Then whose—”

Nancy cut me off, voice tight. “First lines… Sarah taught her. It means: It’ll be all right. I’ll be all right. Last two? Kate never learned them. Nobody did.”

Words hung in the room like a fracture.

⸻

We went to check on Sarah. She looked shaken, almost pale behind the med console.

“The last two lines…” she whispered. “They’re… an invocation. A warning. Something Kate didn’t understand. Something I only realized when I heard them in context with the anomaly readings.”

Before I could ask more, the first thud came from above.

Thud. Thud.

A pause.

Thud.

Another pair of thuds followed, then a final lone thud.

Three footsteps, but not normal—two consistent, one extra after each step. Slow, deliberate, unmistakably paced. My pulse spiked. Nothing should be up there. Nothing should move with such rhythm.

“Randall… check the top-level scan. Thermal,” I hissed.

His hands flew across the interface. Panels lit up, numbers and heat maps dancing across the display.

“Got it,” he muttered, voice tight. “There’s… something. Humanoid. Heat signature like flesh. And… extra limb.”

My stomach dropped. I could see it on the screen—an impossible shape moving across the roof, pacing, deliberate. The slow, impossible rhythm, repeating, mocking the laws of physics and space.

Panic clawed at my chest. My mind raced, thinking of the hatch and the lab. Whoever—or whatever—was up there, it was moving independently, violating everything that should be impossible. Risk. Contamination. We couldn’t send anyone out.

I turned to the observation wall. Burke’s handwriting sprawled across the whiteboard, scrawled in red marker, chaotic and frantic. Notes, telemetry readings, body measurements—all meticulous. One line stood out:

“…is the very error of the moon…”

My stomach lurched. The words felt like a warning. A message written into the chaos, a hint at the madness this place could breed. And as I stared, the lab hatch shifted slightly, a faint gap where the body should have been.

Burke. The suit. Gone.

And that weight hit me. The dark side of the Moon had claimed something—or someone—again.
