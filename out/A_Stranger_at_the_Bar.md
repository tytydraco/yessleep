He walked in five minutes before eleven.

A good-looking older guy—though not well kept. Hefty shadow of stubble, a wrinkled shirt. His eyes roved wildly around the room before settling on a bar stool right in front of me.

“What can I get you?” I asked.

“Whiskey, neat.”

I set the glass down with a *clink*. He barely paid attention, eyes scanning the bar. “Waiting for someone?” I finally asked.

“Just this girl I’ve been talking to online.”

He sat on that stool for a good hour, jumping every time the bell jingled. But she never came. He’d burned through four more whiskeys by the time one AM rolled around. That’s when I walked to the front, turned off the neon *OPEN* sign, and clicked the locks. “It’s closing time, but I don’t mind if you stay a bit. I’ll be cleaning up for the next hour anyway.”

He muttered something, but I didn’t quite catch it.

“What was that?”

He laughed. “I’m slurring already, huh?”

“No, I have a hearing impairment.” I gestured to my left ear. “Hard for me to hear on this side, at a distance.”

“Oh, how did that happen?”

“Just something when I was a baby.” The emotions rushed down on me. I suddenly felt hot. Anxious. Trapped. I quickly changed the subject. “So what happened to your date?” 

“I don’t know. Stood me up, I guess.”

I quickly poured him another shot and slid it across the table. He took a sip, staring at the polished wood with a faraway look. As if he could see the stars in the twisting patterns.

“Aw, hell,” he said finally, his voice slurred. “Serves me right. I shouldn’t have made a *date* on the anniversary.”

“The anniversary… with your ex-wife?” I ventured.

“No.” His face was suddenly grim, still, as if carved in stone. Exuding something far worse, far more serious. “The anniversary of the day… I killed someone.”

His words hung in the air like smoke.

My eyes flicked over the empty room, to the engaged locks. The silence rung in my ears. “The anniversary of the day you killed someone?” I repeated.

“Yes, ma’am,” he replied.

He pushed his empty glass towards me, silently asking me to refill it. I obliged, heart pounding.

*You can do this. Just stay calm.*

*Don’t let your emotions get to you.*

My hand patted the front of my jeans. I found the leather of my phone wallet, and slowly slipped it out, keeping my eyes glued to his. 

“I killed someone on this day, twenty-three years ago,” he said, his voice sloshing through the air like waves. “I was only nineteen. Young and stupid. How I wish I could go back…”

I flipped the wallet open under the shadow of the bar. My finger slid over a square of plastic poking from one of the compartments, and a crinkling sound reached my ears. I winced, waiting one beat, two...

He didn’t notice.

I let out a breath. *That’s it. Stay calm. Don’t give yourself away. Just keep your eyes on his, and everything will be okay.*

*He’s drunk. He won’t notice…*

“This woman, she lived in a big house. Real big, with all the extras. Columns and a fountain and fancy shit.” His words grew more sloppy, more slurred, and my heart pounded faster. “One of my friends did some plumbing work for her. Casually mentioned she was separated from her husband, because he wanted to make a move on her. I saw a different opportunity.”

I reached for his empty glass. This time, instead of bringing the whiskey to him, I snatched it and turned my back to him. My fingers fiddled with the wallet as I pulled at the compartments. After several terrifying seconds, my phone was in my hand, and the full glass of whiskey was set in front of him. 

“I wanted to rob her. I needed the money. Creditors on my back. About to get evicted from my apartment…” He shook his head. “I made a mistake, though. I brought my gun.”

Those words sent a shockwave through my body. I took a deep breath. My fingers tapped at the screen of my phone under the bar. 9… 1…

“I thought she was gone that night. I watched the house for a few days, you know, and she *always* parked in the driveway. Never the garage. So when I saw a dark house, no cars, I figured she was out,” he drunkenly continued. “I was *so* sure of it. This was going to be easy, I told myself.”

I nodded, pretending to listen.

“But I was wrong.” He took another sip of whiskey and let out a long, drawling sigh. “She caught me with the jewelry box upstairs. Phone in her hand, calling the police.”

My own finger hovered over the call button.

“I freaked out. I was nineteen. Getting caught wasn’t part of the plan! I—I—shot her. Just took out my gun and shot her in the chest.” His voice crumbled, and he took in a shuddering breath. “And then the crying started.”

Horror crashed through me. I already knew what came next, in the pit of my stomach; but I asked anyway. “The… crying?”

“She was a mother. A fucking *mother!* I didn’t know that! There she was, in the next room. A little baby, a few months old, crying at the top of her lungs. Her mother lying dead not ten feet away. *Because I killed her.*” His eyes finally met mine. “Everything crashed down and I—I just ran. Then I drove all night, across state lines, and hid out for a while.”

“They didn’t catch you?”

“No. I was wearing gloves, and the only witness was dead.” He paused, staring into the depths of the mirror behind me. “Well, I guess there was the baby. But she didn’t remember, of course.”

“You didn’t confess?” I asked, in a small voice.

“No. I sure as hell wasn’t going to give myself up.”

“Why not?”

“Because I had my whole life ahead of me. I was only nineteen…” He trailed off again, staring at the empty glass. “But if I’m being honest, even now, I couldn’t do it. I know I did a terrible thing, but prison, no, I can’t. I just can’t.”

“Can’t,” I ventured, “or won’t?”

He ignored the question and rubbed his head, leaning heavily against the bar. “Wow. I must be drunker than I thought. I’ve never told anyone that…”

I watched his eyelids droop as he swayed slightly.

“You’re not just drunk,” I said.

He cocked his head at me curiously.

“You’re drugged.”

“… What?”

“That little baby,” I said, my voice shaking. “You remember her.”

“Of course…”

I leaned across the wood, lowering my voice to a whisper.

“That baby was *me.”*

His eyes jittered in front of me, his stare dazed, as the drug took effect.

“After all this time, I finally found you. Took a several years of research, of piecing it together, but I finally got you. And now you’ll pay for what you did to my mother.”

My fingernails dug into the wood. My voice was trembling, with fear and adrenaline, but I pushed forward.

“Don’t you get it? No girl was going to meet you here tonight. That was me, luring you out here with a fake photo. Funny what a little flirting will do to a man.” I paused. “And funny what one gunshot will do to a baby’s hearing, too.”

But he was already gone. Eyes closed, face still, slumped against the wood.

I finally hit the call button on my phone. “This is McCauley’s on 4th,” I said, my voice hurried. “One of the patrons—he just slumped over. I think he might have been on drugs, I don’t know. Please, get here as fast as you can.”

I picked up the tiny plastic bag that I’d been storing in my phone wallet. It was now empty, a fine residue of white powder coating the inside. Stuffing it in my pocket, I grabbed his empty glass.

*Crash.* Upon hitting the bottom of the sink, it shattered into a thousand tiny pieces. I turned on the water, watching the evidence swirl down the drain.

Then I waited for the sirens to pierce the [air.](http://www.reddit.com/r/blairdaniels)
