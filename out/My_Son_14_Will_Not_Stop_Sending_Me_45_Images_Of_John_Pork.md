I live in a libertarian town.
My wife died exactly two months ago.
I don’t like talking about the specifics, but because I want as much help as possible, I’ll admit that she died from a car crash.
Because of the area I live in, I got no justice for the crime.
I have been depressed, drinking until I can’t  move, watching TV and browsing reddit.
My son hasn’t  been the same either.
He’s locked himself in his room, with no connection to other people.
I slide food under his door if I get enough strength to do so.
He doesn’t eat it.
I love my son, but I don’t have enough in me to cater to him like my wife did.
I then realized how much my wife did.
How nothing would be the same.
My son has resorted to starving himself.
His only source of consumption is the feed from his internet home pages.
But If I could stop it, I would.
He has become obsessed with an internet character known as “John Pork”.
I first found out about him through images my son sent me.
They were all creepy pictures of a pig-man hybrid.
The only bit of communication I had gotten through my son for the past week have been images of John Pork.
On march 22nd, days after the crash, I decided to do something about my son.
I couldn’t call for help, as I live in a libertarian area.
I needed to get in his room.
My first attempt at getting to his room was unsuccessful. 
I tried gently coaxing him to open the door.
He made noises that I can’t describe.
It was a quiet screeching kind of noise, a squeal, you could say.
I tried for 3 hours straight.
I then went downstairs to my garage to retrieve a screwdriver to manually take off the door.
I placed the tip of the screwdriver on the hinge of the door, and twisted as hard as I could. I just have tried for 20 minutes, but it never moved.
My son had placed some kind of paste on the door hinges, making it impossible for me to open the door.
I was left with no other choice.
I stomped back up the stairs with a sledgehammer in my hand.
I was going to break through.
I held up the Hammer above my head and smashed it through to the other side of the wall.
My son was still squealing, screaming, and crying.
I was able to make a hole into the door big enough for me to fit through.
I shined my flashlight through the room, and saw everything.
His room was as dirty as a pigsty.
Torn up pages of books were scattered across his room, in the right corner, a mound of feces and urination oozed across the floorboards, molding and growing.
In the back of the room, my pale, naked, starving son was squatting there, squealing and crying, yelling things that I couldn’t comprehend.
I could see his skeleton poking through his skin.
His bones were weak, and his body was shivering.
He had gashes in his body, like he tried eating himself.
He was completely naked, seeming to have used book pages and his clothes to wipe himself. I assume he ran out of clothes and pages, as he was dripping from his back.
He was having a screaming fit, crying and thrashing. I was horrified.
I needed to have access to his phone.
I’m not proud of this now, but this was my only option…
I ran up to the side of his room. It smelled horrible, and I could barely breathe.
My ears were in pain from his screaming.
As I reached for the phone, he slammed his bony, cold hand onto it and squealed.
I tore it from his weak, frail arm and slammed the door shut behind me.
I opened the phone.
I knew his password, as he was required to tell me.
I opened it up, and was horrified.
His wallpaper was John Pork, his apps were edited to look like John Pork.
His contacts were all named to John pork…
Everything was John Pork.
I bawled my eyes out.
How could I lose my son to something this ridiculous?
How is this a coping mechanism?
My “son” was still screaming.
I opened his browser…
His search history had to be the most horrifying thing on his phone.
3 days after the crash, he went to discord. 
He joined a server at 9:24 pm.
The server was called “John Pork”.
I believe this is when his obsession started.
After 9 whole days on the server, he researched John Pork.
He wanted to know everything.
That was all he did throughout the entire month.
After he was certain he knew everything, at 2:58 AM, he simply searched “John Pork”.
At 2:59 AM, he searched “John Pork”.
At 3:00 AM, he searched “John Pork”.
Every minute for the last 5 weeks was search “John Pork”.
I slowly went down the history.
The John Pork search seemed to get slightly more distorted as it went on.
I started not understanding what the text could say.
It became a grisly jumble of symbols and words, all leading to John Pork.
I was shaking, mortified, ruined.
I set down the phone…
But I heard a ringing.
I sat there for two minutes before picking up the phone.
John Pork is calling.
I’m going to accept.
