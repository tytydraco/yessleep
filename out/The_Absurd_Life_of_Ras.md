IT'S QUITE FUNNY HOW little of our lives we control. The mere fact that we are born is out of our control. Perhaps, in the absence of plight, there lies a sense of security left unthreatened in the comfort of slumber. But when that security reveals itself as false, it hits like a bucket of ice water dumped on a sleep-induced coma patient.

However, the efficacy of such a realization is subject to context. The body will, of course, react instinctively to the ice water, but it is the mind that formulates the false sense of security, preventing our wake. Absurdity is a primary agent of chaos; and I've found that to have a fighting chance at controlling chaos, one must first acknowledge and respect the absurd. 

The absurd is anomalous, something that cannot be forecasted. Acceptance of it comes only when we concede that it is both unforeseeable and intermittently constant, which is, in itself, absurd.

In layman terms, and from a logical standpoint: when shit hits the fan, there are a finite amount of outcomes, and it's important to understand the various control archetypes.

Archetype One tries to prevent the shit from hitting the fan entirely. Keep in mind, we are talking about literal shit hitting a ceiling fan, which differs from preventing catastrophe.
When involving literal shit, this is not a smart approach. We only make it smart when we contextualize why we're trying to prevent the shit from hitting the fan. Archetype Two
tries to control the situation through planning and speculation, and shit ends up hitting the fan anyway. Archetype Three removes themselves from the area entirely. Archetype Four
turns the fan off, and allows for shit to hit the fan. The logic is simple: the shit hitting the fan is inevitable, but if the fan is stationary, everyone avoids being splattered when it happens.

Chaos is chaos because it functions as a force multiplier—meaning that by the time chaos arrives, it is already unfathomable. Before chaos becomes unfathomable, it is absurd; and before it becomes absurd, it is a force multiplier. Remove the force multiplier and chaos will never reach you.

Or so I thought.

MONDAY – was like any other Monday. Grey tones lit up my room, the dew found therapy in sobbing on my window pane, a weak stomach seemingly exacerbated by the unnervingly cool air that sits median of night and day, and Apple's PTSD trigger for an alarm that is set an hour before I actually need to wake up - I blame it on my inner child.

For some odd reason this morning the dew stood out to me more than others. Perhaps it was the angle, but there was a single tear-like dew that beckoned me to draw closer. As I approached the teardrop, it was kaleidoscope like. It was a split image of the diamond I chose to be placed in my wife's ring 16 years ago. Upon this realization, I noticed the angle in which I've examined the dew was positioned in direct alignment to where my wife was sleeping along with the nightstand nearest to her – where she has kept her ring since we started marriage counseling 2 years ago.

There was a sense of absurdity to it all, I began to question whether this dewdrop was a reflection or a projection of my marriage's current state. I moved slightly, and the
kaleidoscope vanished. It was at that moment I concluded it was my position as a husband and my wife's position as a wife that caused the sorrow. I began to see the tear on my
window pane as a tear, and the kaleidoscope within it as a reflection of past purities. Reminiscent of a time where the absence of structure yielded gentle fluidity, whereas the
present yields harsh rigidity.

"You see?! How are we ever going to fix our marriage if you never fucking listen to a word I say? Damn it! All I ever wanted was for you to be gentle with me and considerate of
my feelings but you always feel the need to control everything. Even now I bet you're looking at the damn rain on the windows and twisting it into some philosophical bullshit, it's just water Ras!" said Joanne.

"Joanne" I said with calm frustration, "You want me to be gentle, and water is fluid...maybe what our relationship is missing is gentle fluidity?"

"What the fuck is wrong with you Ras? I swear, it's as if EVERYTHING has to be psycho-analyzed. You spend so much time overanalyzing every grain of sand while never being able to step back and see the castle. Do you even remember what initiated us to go to marriage counseling in the first place? Do you know what my favorite color is? Do you remember how we met or what I like to do? Do you even know what I do for work?! You're pathetic Ras, everything is all about logic to you – you are too smart for your own good." Joanne said in a torrent before she turned over and went back to sleep.

Instantly, I was reminded of present impurities – no wonder the kaleidoscope had vanished. I slipped my feet into the slippers that sat beside my bed to prevent my feet from touching the ice-cold hardwood floor, and walked toward the bathroom to shower and get ready for work. It's always best to turn the heater on first so the water is hot by the time I step in. My Monday, was like any other Monday.

As I approach the bathroom entrance, I turn 180°, remove my slippers, and back into the room where a rug is perfectly placed so my feet never touch the cold tile. I take my night clothes off, fold them and wrap my arm around the outside wall to place them in my basket specifically for this use. Opening the shower door, I walk in and turn on the hot water; the method of turning on the heater before a shower never fails. I turned the cold steel lever with my head tilted downward at a 45° angle. Soon, long and intermittently fragmented Jetstreams of hot water came for my neck in a scalding fashion and I couldn't help but feel as though every Jetstream was a personification of Joanne's earlier tangent.

So blazingly sharp, vicious, fluid, scalding, opaque, and so disorientingly everywhere that it was impossible to trace. Every targeted word of hers became nothing more than a splash – breaking into micro pieces in a failed attempt to reach me, before pooling at my feet as the byproduct of an inefficient drain. Or is it the simple fact that in standing still, chaos is bound to surround me?

Suddenly I heard a torrent of lightning. "RAS! You've been in the shower for an hour now, you have 30 minutes before you need to be at work." Said Joanne frantically. "Joanne, is it thundering outside?" I said from the inside of the shower. "No genius, it's just that you've been in that damn shower for an hour and probably started daydreaming." Said Joanne, in a concerning yet annoyed tone. I soon realized that the rain represented every memory of her that has been lost, and the thunder, which were her knocks on the shower door, was merely the rain dramatically and hopelessly communicating to climatologists the dangers of global warming. The root of Joanne's frustration...

Once my shower ended, I brushed my teeth, wrapped my arm around the outside wall to grab the basket and proceeded to put my clothes on. After slipping on my slippers, I walk to my closet to put a suit on and head out to work. I have worked at my company for sixteen years, right around the time I got married. So far, the job has provided a much greater sense of structure in my life. That morning, my boss stopped by my desk to inform me there would be yet another round of layoffs, and that he would need me to walk the employees in our department out on his behalf. My boss always feared the worst. He was a cautious and pretentious man, the kind who would go to Vegas with a Bible in his suitcase to stabilize his carnal desires with a voice of reason. Personally, I always questioned the entire point of going to Vegas if you need to bring a Bible with you every time.

That day I had to walk 7 people out, 3 of which I had grown a liking to during my
tenure here. I gave them my number and told them I'd always be there if needed, with no real intention of being there - I just figured in that moment, a gesture like that meant more than the delivery since they were all acting as if their world had ended. Things have
changed since 2008 and finding a job really isn't as hard as people make it seem. I've got my master's and am well connected - people tend to just overlook the importance of credibility and networking.

I came home that night and Joanne was gone. These past 2 years her boss switched her to graveyard shifts so she works when I'm asleep and vice versa, I think it's pretty inconsiderate to make such a change on short notice but I suppose that's life. I told her she doesn't need to work anyway. As I got in bed, I decided to finally read the book our marriage counselor gave me: "The Great Divorce" by C.S Lewis. Our marriage counselor has a master's degree and is the best of the best, but I made sure to interview her as I've known her to have worked with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian. Though that marriage has failed, she had a lot of data that proved her guidance was effective and the cause of the
divorce was due to undiagnosed self-destructive traits from Mr. West. Soon after, I began to entrust her with $3500 per session.

Upon reading this book, I began to realize it had nothing to do with marriage or divorce and I immediately felt scammed. It seemed the theme of the book was along the lines of "hell is us" and "heaven can be us if we let go of that." I closed the book and looked over at the ring on the nightstand by my wife's bedside, and turned the nightlamp off feeling scammed by the marriage counselor. C.S Lewis didn't seem too bad though. I woke up the next morning with everything but my wife, maybe she had to stay overtime? There was no dew for me to stare at, but everything else was left unchanged. I figured I'd read a few pages of this book; I no longer fear it now that I know it's not about marriage or divorce. Upon opening the book, I noticed all of the pages were empty – what a shame. I closed the book and began to put my slippers on. 

As I began to slide my left foot in the slipper, I suddenly ended back laying on my bed and staring at the ceiling. I must have tried again 16 times to no avail, and thought it was logical to see what would happen if I didn't put my slippers on this morning. I tested the theory by touching the hardwood floor with my big toe, the cool sensation's unwanted transfer from the hardwood to my toe was akin to drawing a square circle. My bare feet have not touched a cold surface since my childhood – this sensation was like an old man with Alzheimer's discovering porn for the
second first time as it was exhilarating, familiar, wrong, and contrarily I didn't enjoy it. If it
means I can continue my day as usual, I suppose I can make an exception just this once.

I SOON BEGAN TO WALK towards the shower with each looming step feeling as if my foot was at war with frostbite, and the floor was the war general. As I approached the inflection of my bedroom's hardwood floor and my bathroom, I turned the heater on. There was a loud yet muted and muffled buzz that kicked in. Wait actually, I believe this sound has been ongoing since I woke up. Looking up at the vents in which heat flowed out of, I reached my hands towards it to see if the heater was doing its job – I did not feel any air. If the heater is broken, why is it that the noise I heard was active before I turned the heater on? I turned the heater off to see if that buzzing sound would go away – it did not. So, I figured I'd check to see if there were a plumbing issue as it seemed the sound was near. I did a 180 degree turn, and backed onto my rug. 

The rug felt cold and hard, as I looked down, I realized I'm still in my bedroom, standing on the hardwood floor. I must have turned a total of 2,880 degrees before I realized what sorcery was upon me – it was the same shit that occurred when I tried to put my slippers on, thank GOD for logic. Enticed, I removed the rug from the bathroom into my bedroom – it severely bothered me seeing the rug laying in my bedroom out of place, but the curiosity behind where this damn sound is coming from was the exception. I took a step forward, and the floor general decided to initiate the cold war being that world war one didn't pan out in his favor. My hand gripped the steel bar that bound that frosted shower door glass, and as soon as the door creaked everything went black.

In the dead silence, all I could hear was my heartbeat – which was quite irregular due to bradycardia. In one heartbeat, light entered my sight for a fraction of a fraction of a millisecond, it was far too fast for me to recognize what I saw because by the next heartbeat we returned to darkness. By the third heartbeat, the lights stayed on and I tried to make sense out of what was in front of me. There was nothing but stillness, dead silence and a nightmare...


AMIDST THE CLOUDS I was inside of an airplane. 42 seats. 21 Joanne's on the left, 21 Joanne's on the right and what looked like a reflection of myself in the middle of the plane with tears flowing down so much to the point where my feet were invading some sort of watery, salty and mucus-like composition. The stillness continued; but the dead silence was replaced with the sound of all 42 Joanne's tears splashing against their own amalgamation – reminiscent of the shower I took yesterday. So violent, so sporadic, so everywhere. As I looked down, I noticed the floor of this plane mirrored the floor of my shower, this was such an oddity – what sort of plane had a slippery floor? 

As I looked up, I paid attention to all 42 Joanne's to contextualize this spectacle. I don't know how, but each Joanne's head was turned a complete 180 degrees facing me, though I'm sure their bodies were facing frontward. Each Joanne had a frantic and somewhat grimacing expression. Every line in their faces looked forced, impressions around the eyes looked exaggerated and dark, tears were flowing from all of their faces, and the smile they all possessed were unfamiliarly haunting to me – Joanne's face, in essence, took the accord of duplicity. This makes sense, because there was no way the Ras in front of me could have produced enough tears to slightly flood this plane.

"What the hell is-" I said in my mind, before the permanently crying Ras cut me off and said without breaking its creepy smile or stream of tears "Ras. Soul." I responded, "I beg your pardon?" The other Ras repeated "Ras. Soul." I wasn't sure what to make of all of this , and I surely don't know how the fake Ras cut my train of thought off – how the hell did he or rather, it, know what I was going to say without me saying it? "So, you're telling me what? That all of this is my soul?" I asked. The other Ras had a slight twitch occur near its left upper cheekbone and said "Does not compute. System error. Unfit for artificial intelligence. Mind. Soul. Equal Syntax. Syntax finite in verbose." "This isn't making any sense, if you're supposed to be my soul how the hell is it so hard for you to listen to me? You're MY soul, what the hell do you mean Syntax finite? Speak in plain English." I responded in a fit of rage. The other Ras said "This. Ras language. Like mud for chocolate." Suddenly, I had an intense urge to piss which was somewhat relieving given the fact that I didn't want to listen to this nonsense any further. 'Like mud for chocolate' The hell does it think it is, a cyborg Laura Esquivel?  I turned 180 degrees and went back into the bathroom. It wasn't the bathroom of a plane; it was my bathroom. I felt at ease, and I walked toward my toilet to urinate.

As I finished, I looked up at the mirror, I couldn't believe what I saw.

I don't know what compelled me to look in the mirror – nothing more dramatic than the urge to piss, I suppose. When I lifted my eyes to the glass reflection, my breath left my body.

My reflection wasn't mine. Or rather, it was me... except outlined by her. A faint silhouette of Joanne clung to the perimeter of my body like a second skin. Hazy, mosaic, trembling, absurd in that it seemed my essence was comprised of Joanne. Every detail was there. Her hair – the exact way it frays at the ends. The slope of her shoulders. The faint asymmetry in her upper lip. The soft curve of her breasts. Her stomach. Her tiger-striped legs. Her entire nakedness – mapped around me like the image of her I once saw through the frosted glass shower door. 

Guilt weighed heavily on me in that the only reason I'm paying attention to Joanne now is because I am marveled within the altered and unfamiliar sight of myself. Is this Joanne that I'm seeing? Is this the female version of myself? Wait a minute... I spoke to Cyborg Ras with the same frustration that Joanne would speak to me with – it feels as if I'm getting somewhere but it's hard to forge the connection within these series of strange events... When my mind was separate but faced with my true soul, did I... become-

The outline of Joanne began to shriek. This long, visceral, primal and mythic shriek clawed its way out of the mirror. The sound didn't vibrate the air, it vibrated me. It felt like the scream was happening or better yet originating from the inside my rib. I tried to step back, but the moment my foot moved I snapped back to where I stood. Again, I tried – one step back and I was back staring at this abysmal chimera like reflection. The mirror, no, she wanted me here – whoever she truly was. Her outline screamed louder, and the ringing in my ear began to produce this resonant feedback effect in response to the screaming until i felt a syrup alien stream trickle down my cheekbone. My ears began to bleed. Every time I tried to speak; her voice shot through mine like lightning through wet sycamore. Futile. Pointless. She grew impossibly louder. She had always been louder, but never impossibly loud.

The sound began to build pressure in the room, and a thin fracture cracked across the mirror, slicing disproportionately between our faces –the disproportionate split bothered me. Another crack, then another – eventually I was looking at a cheap imitation of a kaleidoscope and her outline combined with the continuous screaming expression acted as a parallax of my perception. Screaming, accusing, pleading, confusing – all simultaneously positioned across the fragmented mosaic. Then a hole tore itself through the glass, widening with a sickening hum. Climbing in pitch until it pierced the back of my skull, and suddenly the entire bathroom went slave to the vortex. Shampoo shot past my head and disappeared. A towel followed. Then the rug. Then my breath. The suction grabbed me, and outside of my control – I traversed like a leaf in the wind.

I CLAWED FROM THE OUTSIDE EDGE of... my own mirror of us, with the broken shards of glass that sat on the bottom brim bloodily forcing its impression unto me like a die cast. Eventually, I too fell victim to the vortex and found myself falling in reverse in a space where there was no space. Through the clouds. Through nothing, through everything I couldn't stop. The outline of Joanne was in front of me, taking on the appearance of an out of body experience yet still mimicking my movements. She was no longer screaming, but her outlines began to dissipate with the gusts of the wind. I then noticed the plane from the outside – I noticed that it was a plane in the shape of a heart, or a heart in the shape of a plane, or just a flying fucking heart whatever it was. 

This massive, pulsing heart suspended in the sky, with its wings more like arteries stretching outward, and windows embedded in its vascular walls. With each pulse, it showered blood infused with light and fragmented memory. It had a distinct heartbeat, and I recognized that it was in sync with my own irregular heartbeat – which only meant one thing. I can't come to understand how I didn't notice earlier that there was this massive monstrosity or, my own heart floating in the sky or rather... sinking? I feel like I'm rising, but this... my heart looks like it's sinking or falling into something and it's bleeding is gradually intensifying with each beat. Somehow, the blood is also falling in reverse but has not yet reached me. From my perspective, it looked like bloody rain that stood still despite the contrasting motion.

Suddenly, I heard a static and disorienting voice say "Ras. Unable. Save self. Ras. Con-t-trollillu-sio-oonn. Lack modesty 2 pride fall". Cyborg Ras. Even as I fall through the sky, or rise or whatever I still managed to scowl "That's not even good poetry." But his words began to burrow. Unable save self. Control illusion. Lack Modesty. Two Pride Fall? A diagnosis disguised as a malfunction. The outline of Joanne drifted closer, her shape flickering between something otherworldly. "Joanne" I said nervously reaching toward her even as we fell in reverse, the sky spiraling around us like a drain with the heart's shower pouring hopelessly into it increasingly more profuse. "Help me help you." She froze, turned 180 degrees and dove toward me like a rocket. She extended her arm, I extended mine and in the faintest touch of our fingertips there was a thunderclap, the blood from my own heart splattered on the both of us like splashing paint on the thinnest sheet of ice gently enough so not to break it, and in the exact moment the blood of my heart blanketed our fragile exteriors, and just like magic I was back inside of the plane.

I MUST SPEAK to the Pilot of this plane; somebody has to have some sort of control over this situation. I ignored all of the visually disturbing and depressed Joanne's and though I was walking through a puddle of tears I heard creaks as if I were walking on an old hardwood floor. Yes, the Joanne's necks were on a swivel and the creaking sound came from their heads following my every moment – eyes peeled on me, tears flowing, and that disturbing smile hadn't missed a beat. I noticed Cyborg Ras was missing from this scenario. 

As I journeyed into the cockpit, I noticed it was awkwardly shaped, there was only room for one pilot and I saw Cyborg Ras clutching the controls repeating "Control. Illusion." It felt claustrophobic in here, to the absolute right of me there was this massive slab of wall with this realistic impression of a heart recessed into it with a freakishly realistic size. I understood that beyond this wall is typically where the copilot on a plane would sit. "What the hell is this Cyborg Ras?" I said curiously. Cyborg Ras responded "Control. Illusion. Key-K-Key 2 Heart. Heart 2 Key. Fuel depleted 70%. Reserve with co-par- co-pilot.". "Well, aren't you chatty today, Cyborg Ras, I was beginning to like you. Just tell me what I need to do. Surely, I cannot stay on this plane forever – especially since there is seemingly no destination and there's no way to access the fuel reserves on the other side of this wall."

"Ras. Oblivious." The voice came from Cyborg Ras, but it carried into the weight of something older – something that bad been waiting for me to ease into stepping back. "What does that even mean?" I snapped at Cyborg Ras. "Explain use your words!". Cyborg Ras's Jaw clicked, recalibrated and then said "Ras. Revelation. Key 2 Copilot. Not Microsoft. Gentle fluidity. Ras fall or rise. Ras find waldo, ignore picture. Ignore castle house waldo." The incoherency from this robot was inconveniently indelible, and I stared at the robot as if the blank pages in C.S Lewis' The Great Divorce would have stared at me if it could. 

Either the thing was malfunctioning or – no, on the contrary I've been malfunctioning this whole time. I responded, "I don't know what the hell you're talking about.". Cyborg Ras in contrarian fashion tilted its head in static yet masked disappointment due to the permanent smile mismatched with tears – but I suppose the tears made sense in this current scenario. It followed with "Not control. Until understand fall order." Fall order... the words hit harder than the vortex that had pulled me through the mirror, harder than the sight of the – my own bleeding heart, harder than Joanne, no, my wife's outline screaming over my shell. Fall. Order.

I replayed the sequence from the sky in my mind and memoirs of the positioning, the strange choreography of the sky began to permeate a section of my thought process that dispelled logic and skated around the concaves of my soul. It was me, my wife beneath me, and beneath my wife was my heart. The order of it wasn't random, it was a map – a diagnosis even. I was furthest from my own heart; my wife was the closest in proximity to it. Somewhere along the line, I had convinced her to climb up to where I was – into the altitude of detachment, control, routine, rigidity. I had pulled her away from the heart she once guarded, and neither of us noticed the distance until it became a canyon. My marriage didn't break because she drifted. It broke because I drifted first – farther from my own heart than from hers. What's worse? I made her join me.

"Partial truth." Said Cyborg Ras. It continued saying "Ras not rise. Heart not sink. Illusion. Ras Sink. Heart Fly. No matter. Wife position static. No mat-ter. Ras control context. Emotional failsafe. Avoidance." I stood there in disbelief that a robot, better yet the extension of my soul had an ever-evolving prose. For whatever reason, Cyborg Ras's sentences became easier for me to understand, my soul is becoming easier to understand, and the overbearing weight of this – I mean, my heart no longer seems to be – "Ras. Shut up. Key." Cyborg Ras interrupted and pointed at my chest. As I looked down, I noticed Joanne's specter returned as an outline to my body, with an animate and pure heart completely absolved from blood and pain sifting slightly above the proximity of where my own heart would rest. I looked up at Cyborg Ras, grabbed Joanne's heart and placed it in the recess of the wall that held the copilot area. Waiting for the door of love without handles to open, soon I found myself teleported into the copilot's cockpit. What I saw, was my own skeleton, with Joanne's heart inside of it. I didn't have the time to decipher what that meant, I was focused on finding the fuel reserves and returning to my world, my wife. As I began to search for the fuel reserves, I was teleported back to Cyborg Ras.

"What the hell? Am I not supposed to get off this plane?" Cyborg Ras stood up, the smile vanished, and the tears stopped – There was a complete shift in not just Cyborg Ras, but the entire plane. "You were never meant to get 'off' this plane, at least not in the traditional sense. You can't escape from yourself, you can't escape from your soul, you can't escape from chaos, you can't escape from absurdity and as a result you cannot escape from the byproduct of this concoction – fate. All your life you've engaged in preventative maintenance, living everyday with a false sense of security deeply guised in habit, 'structure', logic, philosophy, analysis and yet you ended up here inside the very thing you voluntarily refused to comprehend. You dressed dogma in the same veil of GOD, failing to understand that GOD cannot be bound by the image of their own image. But man, but you, are not the same, you are bound by the image of your soul's watermark, your mind. Your time here, is coming to an end, and you must now face the final test. You have one; you have ten minutes before you reach the course of inevitability. Death." Said Cyborg Ras, before it, or he, disappeared.

Ras froze. Not because Cyborg Ras spoke so eloquently, not because moments before Ras saw the marriage counselor flicker across Cyborg Ras's exoskeleton, not from anything except for the realization that Cyborg Ras was never a Cyborg. Cyborg Ras was Ras, and Ras was Cyborg Ras. Upon its disappearance, Ras's irregular heartbeat became regular, and the passion partially caressed his spirit with a sweet, teasing taste that would leave him longing for more. Ras began to walk back into the area with the 42 Joanne's, and as he slid the door open there was a Joanne standing there with a smile as creepy as before and tears that never stopped weeping. "Commencing finality, you will be asked 40 questions about Joanne. For every question you answer correctly, one Joanne will disappear. Once you get to the final two, you will have to follow your heart and pick the right Joanne. The right Joanne, is the Joanne you need in order to release yourself from yourself. The right Joanne, is not the Joanne you know the most, but the Joanne that knows you the most. 6 Minutes remain." Joanne said to Ras.

Ras began to tremble, this, was probably one of the first times Ras voluntarily lost control in all aspects. He is unable to speak for himself, or even think for himself. Ras, is no longer the narrator of his own story – he understands that he is a character, and that he has always been just a character. A figment, an echo in a labyrinth of conspiracy, dogma, and all that lacked objective truth. The Joanne in front of Ras asked "Ras, do you love Joanne?" Ras responded "Yes, with all my heart." with no hesitation. Immediately after, Ras watched her transform into the mirror from his bathroom and he saw the skeleton from the copilot's cockpit beginning to grow flesh, starting around the rib. 

The remaining Joanne's began to line up behind the mirror which now obstructed Ras's view of them. They began to ask questions all related to Joanne. Ras did not know Joanne's favorite color, he did not know what she did for work, he did not know what triggered the need to go to marriage counseling, he did not remember what her passion was, he did not remember how they had met. This discouraged Ras, but he was now down to two Joanne's and had short of 1 minute left. By this point, the skeleton in the mirror revealed itself as a nude, female version of Ras with the heart still exposed. It was now time for Ras to select the Joanne that knew them the most. It took them 30 seconds to decide, and the second to last Joanne disappeared.

Ras's Soul, formerly known as Cyborg Ras, seemed to have spoken from the abyss when it said "Fuel critically low, death imminent." Ras, without hesitation, dove through the mirror in front of him and it did not crack despite its fragility. Ras dove through the glass, the kaleidoscope, with gentle fluidity to capture his wife and shield her from his heart's tragic fate. Ras, finally understood. Ras understood that this was pre-written, Ras understood that he would die. He understood what this meant. Joanne, still holding a creepy smile and a face full of tears seemed unchanged by Ras's actions – but the two distant lovers were now proximal and submerged in tears. Joanne in a fetal position, and Ras mimicking the silhouette. Ras's heart was nearing its end, nearing its fate. This was the end.

LIGHTS OUT. Darkness. Stillness. Nothingness.The rule that was followed, brought Ras to this point and the rule was uselessif this point, this nothing was the result of everything.  There's a throbbing and fuzzy sound with an unpleasant timber. What was once darkness, became a blurred vision, then my senses started to come into play one by one. I could hear clearly now, thatdistinct Apple alarm. I could see clearly now, I was holding an angel, but whatlooked to be my wife. I could feel intensely, as if I've been reborn with theability not only to see life in a different light, but interact with itdifferently. The angel I was holding in a fetal position began to speak. "Ras,I have been cheating on you ever since we started marriage counseling – I'msorry, I hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me." I never heard my wife speak so apologetically, so raw – possibly because I never transcribed her words in that fashion. I responded "You are my heart, if you can forgive yourself then you can learn to love yourself and subsequently love me. What good is a heart that bleeds from the inside out?". "Ras..." she responded somberly.

I got out of bed, stretched, and walked into my shower, unfazed by the cold floor, unbothered by the pretense of habit. I realized I forgot to turn the heater on after I got out the shower, but didn't notice the difference. The day was Tuesday, it seems only one day has passed since all of that absurdity transpired. I chose not to wear a suit today, just a polo and some khakis. I decided to take the bus to work, I work 5 minutes from the house, and I've been an office assistant for 16 years. I liked to wear suits in hopes that my boss would promote me. He told me for the past 16 years "If you don't take yourself seriously, no one will!". I suppose I gave up on all of that today. It was just another Tuesday, and I had just got settled in at my desk. 

My boss came up to me, with a smile that signaled wealth, a lack of care, and glutton. He says "Ras, the company has initiated yet another round of layoffs." Initially I responded "Sounds good, let me know what you'd like me to do." 

My boss repeated "Ras, the company has initiated yet another round of layoffs." I said "Yeah, that's fine – just let me know what you'd like me to do." 

My boss repeated "Ras, the company has initiated yet another round of layoffs." 

I paused and realized that the time on my screensaver was frozen. I know this feeling far too well, but I don't understand – what is the right answer? This is what I always respond to him with... I'm starting to get worried. 

I respond "Again? Didn't we just have one yesterday?" "Well, that's the thing ole Ras, I will have to walk you out today. This decision was out of my control, it came from the man upstairs. Listen, if you ever need anything give me a call." Said Tim, who is now just 'Tim' to me as he slid me one of his new business cards. He walked me out, and the first thing I saw when the doors opened was my wife, with the same creepy smile and face full of tears that resembled all 42 Joanne's from that wretched plane.
