Hey everyone, I’m new to this, but I figured it’s a good place to talk about something that happened recently. I recently moved into my significant other’s place. She doesn’t much care for this whole online thing, so I’ll just refer to her as my SO because “girlfriend” sounds childish. 

Anyway, we live in a small apartment. Small enough that we used to have neighbors who would argue all the time. Eventually, I think they moved out I realized that because they haven’t woken me up in over a month with their domestic disputes (thank God). Other than that, the place is cozy. We’re on the second floor, and it’s nice because our AC has a shared line, so we don’t have to worry about it clogging up here. 

She has a cat named Ducks. Ducks is warming up to me slowly, though he’s skittish. Skittish and jumpy are two different things in a cat. When I first got here, he was extremely jumpy, always creeping around corners and then flying three feet into the air whenever I moved even slightly. Poor dude was so bad about it, I convinced her to take him to the vet. Now we have to feed him meds twice daily for high blood pressure. He likes it because he gets treats every time. Gluttony at its finest. Since I am getting on here to air this out, that should have been my first big red flag. 

My SO and I watch YouTube together every evening while we eat dinner. I started noticing our security system lighting up during those times. It was weird but not alarming, so I asked her about it. She said it was strange but that it had always done that, probably because of the motion sensor and how Ducks runs past it. We check the locks ritualistically every night before bed. Well, at least she does. I grew up in a house where someone was always awake or out doing something, so we never really locked the doors. It wasn’t until I moved in with her that I realized how unsafe that really was. 

I have trouble sleeping. I was in the Army, and I spent a good amount of time going back and forth between South Korea and Texas. Before that, I slept easily. I miss those days. These days I watch Creep Cast on YouTube late at night. Something about being spooked helps me sleep. One night, I was walking to the kitchen for a snack when I saw something downstairs moving outside, through the sliding glass doors. My SO says people can’t see inside from down there, and I believe her, but I can’t help thinking they can if they try hard enough. I was admittedly a little paranoid because of the podcast. I chalked it up to that and assumed it was someone walking by. I shouldn’t have. 

There’s a comfort that comes with living close to others. It’s not likely anything could happen without someone overhearing and calling 911. That’s balanced by the thought that the people nearby might be lunatics, like the couple next door. 

It was maybe eleven p.m., and I had just finished a project. As I lay in bed about to sleep, there were suddenly three loud bangs. It startled the hell out of me and woke her up. She had no clue what was going on. I told her, “I think someone just pounded on our front door.” Let me preface this by saying I’m a vet, and I know having a gun is important for home defense. Up to that point, I’d never needed one. It’s always just been me defending myself. But in that moment, I became painfully aware of how vulnerable she was without one. 

I told her to grab her knife in case she needed it. I grabbed a long flathead screwdriver. I know you’re at an advantage if someone breaks in because you know the layout, and it’s mostly dark. Still, I found myself thinking how brutal it would be to have to stab someone to death with a screwdriver. Shooting someone isn’t pleasant, but it seems like a better option than stabbing them in the neck. 

I held a corner and waited for any sound from the main room. After a minute, fairly certain they hadn’t breached the door, I began walking down the hallway. I told her to ready her phone and stay behind cover unless I said otherwise. She didn’t listen, she was worried about me. I cleared the house; no one was in it. However, the security system was lit up. I quietly checked the deadbolt through the slit in the door. It was still engaged. So was the doorknob. 

I had her call my dad to see if anyone in the family had stopped by, but he was half asleep and confirmed my suspicion: no one had. I stayed up the rest of the night while she went back to bed. When she woke up for work, I made sure she had her mom on the phone before she left. Then I finally crashed. I dead bolted the door and passed out in bed. 

The next day I went online and found the perfect stainless 1911. I promised myself it would be my first personal gun since childhood. I had to brave the next few nights without it because of shipping and background checks, but eventually, I had it. I took it for a spin, then kept it in the cupboard next to the bed for quick access. I felt a lot safer. Ducks stopped slinking around the house all the time, and things became mundane again. 

A couple months later, I was alone late at night watching Creep Cast when something caught my attention. My front door is just behind the living room TV. The peepholes in the door were black. I keep the light on outside, so that shouldn’t happen. I thought I was overreacting until I noticed the light switch was still flipped on. Two thoughts hit me: either the bulb had gone out, or something was standing outside looking in, blocking it. 

I got up without pausing the TV and tried to stay calm. I started walking as if I were heading to the bathroom. That’s when I heard the dreadful sound of our automatic deadbolt unlocking itself. I hurried to our room. My snoring SO was still passed out. I thought about waking her but didn’t. She would have panicked, and I didn’t have time. I grabbed my 1911, racked it, and took aim. Crouched low, aiming down the hallway, I waited. 

A figure stepped into the hallway. I can’t describe it, but if you’re imagining something, you’re probably close. I thought, if I’m hallucinating right now, I’m going to end up in a white room for a while. Then I pulled the trigger seven times. I know I hit it. 

It made a sound, or more like the absence of one. I’ve never heard anything like it and probably never will again. The only way I can describe it is if you’ve ever inverted the colors of a picture, except this was vocal. My SO woke up and started screaming, but I couldn’t hear her. The gunshots were deafening, and the intruder was louder still. It took off. My SO called the police without me even saying a word. 

Afterward, the bullets must have lodged in it because there were no holes in the walls, just blood. Blood that, of course, had no matches in any DNA database according to officer Dick. It also left a strong scent of pine. If you've ever rubbed pine resin into your palm, you'd know it. I didn’t say much to the cops other than, “I feared for my life.” 

She didn’t see the intruder. I wish I hadn’t. I’ve heard nothing from the police. We’re moving to a house soon. I’m praying it doesn’t follow us. Writing this here has been therapeutic in a way. I know what I saw wasn’t normal. I wonder what else could be lurking.
