Before I start, you need to know that this text is your death sentence. They will know you’re reading this, and they’ll be coming after you just like they’re coming after me.
Prepare yourself — they see everything. Good luck.

My name is Escribar.
If you’re reading this message now, then they probably are too.
I’m speaking from Brazil, but if this conspiracy goes as far as I think it does, the world map has probably been manipulated to keep you and me under control. And if you still don’t understand what I’m talking about, then my message has reached the right person.

Have you ever felt like you were excluded from social circles where everyone else fits in?
I have. I’ve always been treated like I was different. People used to say I had mental health issues — but now I know those people were just bad actors.

I was hired as the night guard of my city’s government building.
They told me my job was to patrol the building interior and the backyard, because drug dealers and addicts were using the place to smoke and sell narcotics (very dumb place for that, by the way) — and especially because of vandals that had been causing trouble.
I’m tall and relatively strong, so a few rebellious teenagers shouldn’t be a big deal.

After four months on the job, the afternoon shift guard called me to say he had forgotten the security camera key hanging on the door.
We usually bring all the keys to the staff room and put them in the key drawer, so he told me to grab the camera key and drop it off there when I finished my shift.
I usually didn’t even remember that key existed, since I never used it during my shift — only the main key and the backyard key.
I had only been instructed to patrol the main rooms and the backyard, and I had access to the key drawer.
The only rule I had was: do not patrol the second floor.
And honestly, things had gotten boring these past few weeks — just walking back and forth.
So I decided to supervise the building using the cameras.
That was my worst mistake.

An hour had passed since I turned on the monitor — 1:23 AM.
There are 32 cameras in total, but only 14 are on the ground floor: the halls, the front of the building, the meeting rooms, the staff room, and the main office.
I always found it strange that I was hired to protect the building but was only allowed to watch specific places.

While sipping my sugar-free coffee, I noticed a small rope sticking out from the monitor.
Thinking it was just a loose screen wire, I tried to push it back in, but it simply fell out.
It was tied to a small plastic rectangle that had been covering part of the back of the screen.
I checked the back to see if I had broken something.
Fortunately (or unfortunately), I hadn’t.
All I found was a small tablet-like screen hidden behind the plastic piece.

Without thinking too much, I turned it on.
It didn’t even have a menu — it just instantly opened four additional cameras, probably used by the morning shift guard.
Only one of them worked: Camera 3.
It showed the management room on the second floor — a place I wasn’t allowed to go.

Before I even had time to think, "Wait, I wasn’t supposed to be monitoring this place," the camera detected movement.

It was... Pietra?!
The popular girl I went to school with.
She had always treated me badly.
She was wearing an elegant, expensive all-black outfit, with a skirt that reached just below her knees.
I snapped back to my role as the security guard, and questions flooded my mind:
How did she get in? Why is she here? What is she doing?

I watched her for a while.
She moved her finger carefully across the manager’s desk — which caused it to... move and open a hidden hole in the floor?
“Maybe it’s a secret safe for the manager’s valuables,” I thought.

I rushed to the key drawer, grabbed the management room keys, and ran to the second floor.
Getting the keys was pointless — the door was already unlocked and opened just by pushing it.

No one was there.
The manager’s desk was in place as always.
I looked to the corner where the camera should’ve been, but all I saw was concrete.
Am I going crazy?

For the first time on this job, I felt fear.
I had never dealt with a possible break-in before — everything had always been calm.

I reached for my radio to call the authorities.
I don’t know why I hadn’t done it earlier, but with my hands shaking, I dropped the radio, and it shattered on the ground.

“SH*T!” I had never said that word with so much emotion.

I looked at the manager’s desk again, curious.
If she had gone somewhere, it had to be through that hole.
Or — best case — I was hallucinating.

I rubbed the desk’s surface with my fingers, trying to mimic what I saw her doing.
In certain spots, the surface dented slightly and made a clicking sound.
After pressing three of them, the desk shifted and revealed an opening with a long staircase.

I entered.

At the bottom of the stairs was an elegant, elevator-like room — empty.
I saw a floor panel on the wall.
At that point, I was beyond questioning anything.
I just wanted to find out where she had gone, report it to the police, and get out.

I touched the only button available, and the platform started to descend.
The whole place had a very baroque feel — elegant, detailed.

"You’ve come! It was about time. I have such sights to show you," said a clear, feminine voice from the walls.
Was it Pietra?

The floor stopped. The walls opened.

A massive underground structure revealed itself — like an infinite palace beneath the earth, entirely styled like the 1600s.
There were classical paintings, and some I couldn’t even recognize. The place had a strange but pleasant whiskey scent.
Millions of people walked around, dressed in smoky-colored suits and dresses, all wearing gold and blue masks.
They were walking, sitting, dancing, drinking, eating — it looked like an eternal masquerade. Beautiful. Surreal.

I stepped carefully onto a red and gold carpet. The masked people were in the other rooms, almost twice the size of the one I stood in.
I was probably in the lobby — the entrance.
Either way, I didn’t want anyone to see me.

I’m not an investigator. I’m not a police officer.
Whatever this is, it’s not written in my contract.

I turned around, ready to run to the nearest police department, only to find that the door had closed on its own.
I was at the entrance. Now I had to find an exit.

I felt fear crawl over me again.
I started looking around.

Some of the masked people — probably the “employees” — wore longer robes and masks, preserving their identities.
I wasn’t in a restaurant or a market. If there was an “employees only” area, it wouldn’t be labeled.

I found a modest little door — unlike the huge palace-like ones that connected the lobby to the rest.
Inside was a large room filled with lockers, probably where the masked ones changed.
They were all locked — except one.
An open locker with a long blue tunic and a golden mask — like a Catholic priest’s robe.
The key was missing. Its owner would probably be coming back soon.

I put on the beautiful blue tunic — it smelled nice and felt good on my skin.
The golden mask had a neutral face and fit me almost perfectly.
After finishing my disguise, I approached the door to the lobby again, determined to find a way out.
But then I heard footsteps — heavy shoes, just like the ones I was wearing now.
They were coming from outside the door.

Seeing no way out, I figured talking was my only option.

Before the person could enter, I opened the door myself — and realized I had been holding my breath only when I started shoking.

A familiar face. So young, so pretty.
Pietra — the mayor’s daughter.

"I apologize for my late arrival. I had some trouble upstairs — the night guard found the other cameras. We will punish the guard of the other shift for his mistake with the keys.
Now, identify yourself."

I remembered the lockers had engraved names — not real ones, just false labels. Including the one on the open locker.

“Nyimdock. Locker 48.
What’s going to happen to the guard who saw the confidential cameras?”

"Such a pleasure to meet you, Nyimdock. It’s my first day as a servicer of the New Society, and I’ve heard good things about your work.
Now, to answer your question: Neutralization. His body will be placed with the others, to strengthen our blessing. The executioners are already going up."

I felt my vision go dark. The tunic’s pleasant scent faded, replaced by the cold metal of the mask.
My breathing got louder.

What the hell have I gotten myself into?

I need to get out of here — fast.

“Understandable. I hope you enjoy your first day of service. I… I must be going now.”

I walked past her, not waiting for a reply.
In my peripheral vision, I saw her and another man entering the room — probably the rightful owner of the outfit I were wearing.

I walked as quickly as I could, trying to mimic the same posture as everyone else.
I kept close to the walls. The place was huge — bigger than the city itself.
It’s impossible to know how far it extended — beneath the city, the state, the country… or the whole world.
I didn’t know how many entrances or exits there were.
I just wandered and hoped I’d find something.

And I did — but not only the exit.

I had walked for about 5 minutes, probably covering three city blocks worth of distance.
I passed by endless rooms: banquet halls, drink bars with everything from vodka to vintage wines, museums with every object imaginable.

And then… the strangest room yet.

Massive scriptures carved into the ground and walls.
In the center — a large white symbol painted on the floor, with five smaller ones surrounding it.
And the worst of all: four people kneeling on top of them — and one empty spot.

Standing there, I saw horrific visions flashing through my mind like my soul was being teared into pieces, hearing demonic screams echoing inside my ears
I staggered and fell to my knees. 

This place… there was something terrible here.

That’s what Pietra was talking about.

They have some kind of “new society” — one that only specific people are worthy of joining.
I don’t know how long it’s existed or how many are involved, but they’re doing something unspeakable, to receive a "bless".

They’re making sacrifices — for something or someone — something monstrous.
And I’m one of the sacrificial lambs.

The good news?
One of the exits is in that room.

I stumbled to the elevator, clutching my head, trying to silence that demonic noise in my mind.

I slammed the button.
And through all the chaos stabbing at my thoughts, I saw four tall men enter the room, holding golden daggers, just as the doors closed.

I collapsed on the floor. The madness slowly faded.
But I didn’t have time to process anything — the doors opened again.

It lead to inside the police station — just a few blocks from the government building.
But it was… quiet.

Empty. Completely empty.
No officers. No civilians.
The government is involved.
I triggered a red alert — and to stop me from spreading what I saw, they cleared everyone out temporally.
I’m all alone in this. For now.

I’ve been hiding here for 30 minutes. I’ve armed myself.
But I know they have total control.

They could kill me any second, a bullet could have penetrated one of the walls and through my head anytime. 
I don’t know why they haven’t done it yet.
Maybe they’re just playing with their food.

Anyway, now you know.
You’re involved too. Don’t trust anyone.
They could be part of it.
The police probably don’t know. If they did, they probably would not have been taken until the new society were done with me.
Probably because the good cops would interfere.

Go to the nearest police station.
They might not believe you — but if you stay around a big crowd, you’ll probably be safe.
At least until this text escalates globally.

I wish you a good night — and good luck.
