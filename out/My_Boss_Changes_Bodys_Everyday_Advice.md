I think this might be the only place that people will actually believe me about this. I recently got a job at this contracting company. I saw the pay and immediately tried to get an interview. When I got it I was elated, the interviewer when I got there was the boss herself. I don't care about her privacy, she's a freak. Her name is Iris, she was an old childhood friend who moved away because she killed birds and a neighborhood cat. I didn't even want the job when she tried to get a date with me *during* my interview. I stormed out when she commented on my chest, but...she was already outside smoking a cigarette near my car.

"Are you *sure* you don't want one date?" She unbuttoned her blouse like that did anything. She was weird and the pay wasn't worth this bizarre bullshit.

That was until I couldn't land another job for another three months, my savings were running out, and...I got another call from that company offering a hefty starting bonus. I thought it was going to be fine, but shit. What is up with this...*thing?*

Every day since I got the job it changes. On my first day, I noticed it, instead of long hair it was cut short. Not too out of the ordinary, yeah, but her body was different. She was flat-chested now, skinnier, and a skirt that was certainly not up to code. I tried mentioning it to the person who was training me, but she looked at me funny. After I clocked out, she was near my car with a vape. She blew it in my face, iImention this because it smelled like bananas. I *love* bananas.

"Wanna come over to my place?" I said *no.*

\*"\*Aw poo...better luck next time." Then went off.

Over the past week, it's subtle...but she knows my favorite things. It had pink hair the next day, my favorite color. Along with being 4 inches taller than me now.

And a *Man.* I couldn't help but confront him, my co-workers were no help.

"You don't like men?" That's not the damn point! I asked...it. What *it* was. But he just shrugged and told me to get back to work. I tried taking a picture of him but it came out in a smudge of light. I went to HR that day and tried to explain the situation to them. They offered me mental health services. Then I tried to claim sexual harassment but they just told me I could quit.

This past week has been so confusing...It was a fem-boy on Wednesday. Then a damn dominatrix on Thursday! Today she was in uniform thankfully....just an abnormally large chest. The only thing that hasn't changed is the two moles under her right eye. Along with her waiting near my car with a different type of drug/alcohol. This time when she was waiting outside she had a fruity seltzer, when she offered me one she blatantly poured a powder in it???

Any Advice? Will Update.
