The following letter was found on an abandoned research boat by a rescue team, after the father of two of the researchers reported the group missing. He claimed they had been gone almost a month longer than the team planned. When the rescue team finally managed to locate the missing vessel there was no sign of its crew, say for this single letter.

Fear is an inevitability that comes in almost endless forms. It can take the form of any person, place or thing depending on its target. Some people have many fears, and are likely to jump at their own shadow. Others believe they are completely immune to the idea of fear, until they are met with something that proves them to be completely wrong. Then there’s those who are enticed by their very fears, driven by them. Those who feel that cold shiver of the spine like a shot of adrenaline, and chase that high like a street junkie chasing down that last hit. I was always the third type of person, specifically the fear of the ocean. Ever since I could crawl, the deep blue unknown, along with the things that live beneath it, has been both my biggest fear, and truest love. This love quickly led me down the path of marine biology, specifically in the field of deep sea exploration. I even became quite adept at scuba diving, however my Thalassophobia prevented me from ever going too deep before the irrational thought of a 400 ft Leviathan emerging from below to swallow me whole, or the much more rational thought of a failed oxygen tank suddenly cutting off my air supply while half a mile underwater filled my mind and forced me to return to the surface.

Luckily it didn’t take me long to find a team that greatly complimented my shortcomings in the field. A small group of six including myself, who all met halfway through our second years of college. All extremely different, and likely would’ve never come together if it weren’t for one key similarity between us all, our love for the deep unknown. Even in this department our love for the ocean came from many different reasons. Marco and Malcolm were a set of twins born to a world renowned prize fisherman, and as a result spent the majority of their lives on the waters of the world, wrangling the largest and rarest fish the seven seas could offer. It didn’t take long until the two realized the challenge of fishing from the deck of a boat was too easy, and if they wanted a real challenge they would have to look deeper, much deeper. Rounding out our divers was Julia, who many including myself would say was born to spend her life under the ocean waters. This was a bit more than an expression too, seeing as how she was quite literally born on the waters, to a mother and father who had been a part of the U.S navy at the time.

The other half of our team consisted of those who preferred to study the ocean’s beauty and mystery from dryer views. Aside from myself who acted as the team's lead aquatic life researcher, there was Drew, our team's Horticulturist, or plant life expert, specifically studying how these underwater plants could be used to benefit humanity mainly in the field of medicine. Ironically he never intended to lead a career in marine biology rather botany. To be frank his real intentions were Marco, but after a few dates with him and his old man's fishing boat, the very boat that would become our traveling research station, he fell in love with the ocean, arguably more than Marco himself. Then last but not least we had Alexa who was the team’s technician, making sure all our tools and equipment ran at top shape. Much like me, Alexa had a fearful love of the ocean, specifically the fear of drowning due to not being a great swimmer. Despite her lack of swimming abilities, she never once turned down a chance to adventure the oceans, and with the six of us together, there was plenty of adventuring to be done. For well over a decade our little band sailed as far as the eye could see, studying and recording everything the seven seas could offer. From the depths of the Mariana Trench to the Twilight zone reefs of the Chagos Islands, if there was exploration to be done, we would be there. This thirst for exploration and discovery would eventually lead us to our most current expedition, studying the depths of Point Nemo, the furthest point a person could possibly get from civilization.

To study what kind of activity went on in a place so rarely visited by mankind was a dream to us all. The location was as natural as you could get, almost a completely other world, untouched by humans, and our minds raced at the possible discoveries to be found in such a place. The plan was simple enough. Sail out and anchor down in the Point for a week, two at the very most. The Diving crew would go under twice daily, once in the morning and once. They’d be equipped with both radios, and cameras directly linked to the boat's computer, so that any pictures or video may be viewed instantly by the research crew. For the first three days things were going great. We were able to study a vast array of fish, hydroids and invertebrates. Some of which I had never seen before in my life. We would all joke that this expedition would be the one to get our names in the history books…however our tones quickly changed during the first dive of day four.

Things started just as smoothly as the previous days, however no more than about 30 minutes in all three of our divers' cameras cut off simultaneously. Figuring it to be nothing more than some simple technical difficulties, we radioed them back up to the boat to hopefully fix the issue, and once they resurfaced our greatest fears since forming our little team had come true…we had lost a diver. The fact One less person had come up than the amount of people sent down was blatantly obvious. Far less obvious however, and far more concerning was the remaining two diver’s reactions, or rather lack thereof. It wasn’t 100% clear who for sure who was lost, as when we first met the returning divers on deck they were still completely covered in their gear. However based on the height and figure of the two it was clear that it was one of the twins who had gone missing. They quickly began to remove their masks and goggles to reveal it was in fact Malcolm to disappear, yet Marco and Julia had been acting like everything was normal.

The three of us who had remained on the boat desperately began asking what happened, and where Malcolm went. Asking if they had split up at any point, or if they saw him diverge from the group. Our desperate line of questioning was only met with confused looks from the two, before Marco said something that left all of us in complete silence. “Who the hell is Malcolm?” He asked in genuine confusion, the look on Julia’s face said she was wondering the same exact thing. We had spent what felt like hours trying to show them proof of Malcolm's existence, but no matter how many pictures we showed them, or how many stories we tried retelling, neither of them had even the slightest memory of him. They remembered every other detail about their lives, except for Malcolm. It was as if he had been completely wiped from their minds, like he never existed in the first place. What was even more concerning was the fact neither Marco or Julia seemed to care they had just lost their memories, even after being given undeniable proof. In fact the only thing they were concerned about was going back under. All they would say was how they needed to go back, and given the fact we had just lost a member of our team we probably would’ve let them in hopes of finding him, but they already made it obvious all their knowledge of our friend had disappeared with him, and even if we sent them down to look for Malcolm it was highly doubtful they’d even attempt searching. Along with that they…they just weren’t right. Their need to return to the ocean, and demands to send them back down were bordering on the lines of obsession and madness.  We always tried to stay as logical as possible when out on these waters, but it was clear that whatever it was they found down there, it did something to them. So with great debate and a few yelling matches, we decided to refuse their request.

Instead we Opted to attempt and bring the cameras back up. Seeing as how they ran on a live feed, we figured getting it back up would lead us a step closer to finding Malcolm before it was too late. When the divers went down they all had full tanks of Oxygen. good for about 14 hours, but with how much time had already passed from them going under to the long argument over what the hell happened in the first place, we had to act quickly. Fortunately, Alexa was able to get the cameras running rather easily once we managed to get to work, Unfortunately…the sight it showed crushed any hope of saving Malcolm. Even with the camera's night vision it was extremely dark, but still gave off enough light to show it had been lying motionless on the ocean floor…Malcolm standing in front of it even more motionless than the camera filming him. He was stripped completely nude with his back facing the camera, just standing there without the slightest twitch. The sight was just as gut wrenching as it was mind boggling. It didn’t take a genius to realize he was dead, but how? How was he managing to still stand, let alone at the bottom of the ocean, and how did he manage to remove all his gear. While there were many unanswered questions, there was one fact we were aware of. His body was far too deep down to retrieve with any of the equipment we had, and even if we did have the proper equipment for such a dive, it’s not like the people trained to dive that deep were in a rush to find him in the first place. So after another long dispute we finally decided it was time to call off the expedition, and do our best to tell Marco and Malcolm's father about his sons passing as well as try our best to explain his remaining sons sudden acute memory loss…However we’d never get the chance to.

Shortly after finally deciding it was time to leave, we made the horrifying discovery that our engine was no longer running, In fact none of the boat's equipment was…including our radio. We were little more than a giant plant of driftwood, stuck floating in complete isolation with no our only connection to the outside world now severed. What made the situation worse was that while Drew, Alexa and I were sent into a reasonable panic over this new development, Marco and Julia had slipped farther into whatever madness had taken hold of them. They were absolutely elated, claiming this was a sign. That “it” was calling them back. That “it” needed them. They rather quickly got violent with us when we refused to let them suit back up, it got to the point we eventually had to restrain the two and lock them in the closest storage closet we could manage to force them into, only for them to immediately start banging and clawing at the door in desperation. Repeating “It needs us!”. Just over and over again.

After managing to get the situation under control, the three of us who’s sanity were still relatively intact gathered our bearings as best we could, and began trying to formulate a plan to fix the boat.

Eventually Drew said he would go under and check to see if perhaps something had got caught in the motor. At first Alexa and I strongly objected to that, or any other plan involving going into the water, but he was quick to point out we had very little options. He also pointed out that out of the three of us, he was the one who knew the boat best. He was used to helping Marco with maintenance, along with taking it out with him far more frequently than either Alexa or I did. He also reassured us that he was going no more than four feet deep, and the waters were more than clear enough to see him at all times.  Eventually we gave in and agreed to the plan. While still very on edge his points were valid and logical, and that’s where we messed up, giving into logic. After everything we’ve seen we should have known logic didn’t apply to this place. By all accounts Drew should’ve been right. With how deep he said he’d be going coupled with how clear the water was we should have been able to see him at all times, but we couldn’t. Hell he didn’t even reach the depth he said he’d be going, because the moment, the very moment his head went under and he was fully submerged…gone. Vanished within a blink of an eye and lost to the sea like his brother in law before him. It was so sudden I didn’t even know how to react. I wanted to scream, or panic, but my brain was too busy trying to process what I had just seen that I simply locked up, frozen in a stasis bubble of confusion and fear. Alexa didn’t say anything either, and judging by her lack of reaction I could only assume she was in a similar state, which meant neither of us could react in time for what happened next.

Losing another friend, this one right before our eyes, caused us to neglect the fact we had two others locked away. Two others who have been desperately trying to get out. Only for a moment, but that was all they needed, as I was brought back to reality by the sounds of snapping wood followed by a large crash. I quickly turned around to see Marco and Julia had busted down the storage door, and were quickly making a break to the side of the boat, both yelling out how “it’s” calling them in near unison. They didn’t even bother to grab their scuba gear still laying out in the middle of the deck, only wanting to return to the depths. By the time I fully came to they were already well past halfway to going overboard, but it seemed Alexa had regained control of herself before myself, as I saw her make a break towards them just moments before I could follow. She jumped in front of the two pleading for them to stop, yelling how Drew was gone, but the divers didn’t slow for a second, treating her like nothing more than a bug on the windshield and…dear god…they took her with them.

I reached out in an attempt to pull Alexa back, only to graze her fingertips while she was sent careening back as Julia and Marco sent her overboard along with themselves. I slowly looked over the rail of the boat to see more friends lost to the seas, swallowed by a splash of rippling water and down into the cold dark depths. I slowly began to break down, curling into a ball as I began to sob. My whole team, my closest friends all taken from me by the very thing we dedicated our lives to. I was completely alone now, with no way of contacting civilization. After an unclear amount of time I finally managed to pull myself together and get back to my feet. I quickly got to work on attempting to repair the radio in hopes of finding rescue. Despite the vast array of emotions flooding through me I stayed focused on survival, reasoning to myself that the worst had already happened, but I was so wrong, because the worst came with the nightfall.

I was sitting in the captain’s quarters still trying to revive the radio when I finally heard another voice. It didn’t come from the radio, in fact it wasn’t clear where it came from, almost as if it was echoing around me from all directions. One thing was clear though, and that’s whose voice it was speaking to me…Malcolm. He was calling to me, beckoning me to enter the waters. Soon after him another voice followed to beckon me into the depths, this one belonging to Julia, followed by Marco, then Drew, and finally Alex. All five called out to me, pleading for me to join them. Not long after the voices of my lost friends began bombarding me, the room was filled with a dim glow. I slowly turned around to see the computer linked to Malcolm’s camera had suddenly booted back up, however it displayed a much different Scene this time. Malcolm was now facing the camera, his dead eyes staring down the lens with a large cartoonish smile painted across his face. This time…this time however he wasn’t alone. Now he was joined by his brother, along with the other three members of our team, all standing hand in hand as they look into the camera, a similar twisted grin as Malcolm's spread across their faces, as if they were watching me. Their voices continued to fill the room as they watched me through the camera, their uncanny smiles never wavering.

This continued until sunrise, when their voices left with the moon, and the computer abruptly turned itself back off. At first I had convinced myself it was a nightmare, or a stress induced hallucination, but that was soon proven false once night time returned, and my friends returned with it. That was 12 days ago, and they haven’t stopped. Every night, the moment the sunlight fades they come back like clockwork, begging me to join them. I’ve now officially run out of clean water, food, and any hope that rescue will ever come. The sun is setting now, and I know they are soon to come. I don’t think I can handle another night, so I’ve decided to write this, as a warning to whoever may be unfortunate to find this boat, and then, when the moon rises, I’ll accept their offer, and I’ll embrace the ocean’s depths.
