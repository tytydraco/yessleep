I have been noticing strange behavior in my family the last few days. 

They seem to be constantly avoiding me. Like I was some sort of plague. So lately I've been finding comfort in my dog Charley. 

Charley is a pureblooded German Shepherd. My dad says they can hunt anything once you train them too. But lately our favorite game to play is Hide and Seek. 

Charley is amazing when it comes to hide and seek. I guess it's how I mom says that a dogs hearing is 10x better than human ears. 

I'm getting ahead of myself. 

So my family made a rule to never invite friends over at the house. I made countless arguments over how not fair that is because my older sister Sarah got to bring her friends. But whenever she does I wasn't aloud to come out of my room until they leave. 

I've always thought it was strange especially since I was homeschooled. My parents said I have a brain that needs to be nurtered and public schools don't have the resources. 

My sister Sarah she's a jerk. Well sometimes when she ain't within earshot I would mumble "bitch" under my breath. She would spend every waking minute torturing me. My parents also said that's brothers and sisters do. 

Charley… I really love Charley. He's my only friend that i have. We would sometimes go for long walks in the woods surrounding our house. 

Sometimes we would eventually pass hikers who would give us the odd look as something that didn't belong. I guess that makes since as my father didn't want to live near urban civilization. 

One day i got real mad at my parents. I guess it was because of all the isolation that got to me. "Why am i the only one here that doesn't get to have friends over?!" My parents tried their best to calm me down but i wouldn't listen. "No! I'm not staying here any longer!" I yelled as I ran out the front door before slamming it. 

I quickly got on my bike and raced off with Charley who was right behind me barking. 

I wasn't going far. I mean I'm only a kid, teenager even, where was I going to go Detroit? No i have a better place in mind. As I race along with Charley on my bike we finally made it to a cave that my parents don't know about. I even made sure they didn't based on the trails we would hike. 

The cave is about as tall as a truck. With a solid rock formation around it. I don't mind how cold it is. The dripping of the cold water actually relaxes me. As i was sitting there with Charley who was looking around the cave I heard a voice. It sounded dry and raspy. 

"Hey… hey kid, help". Sounded like the person wanted to shout it but couldn't. I nearly jumped out of my seat as i quickly looked around for the voice. 

That's when i noticed how Charley was reacting. 

Whenever someone would speak with ill intention Charley would bark at them. But at this moment Charley was sniffing the ground heading towards the voice. So I took a chance with it evwethogh I was scared.  

"Where are you?! Speak again that way I know where you are!" 

But no more sound ever came up. Charley started whimpering ao i took this as a sign to get the heck out of dodge. I got back on my bike and raced towards back to my house. 

As soon as I got home my parents were upset with me for being gone this long but were glad that i was alright. The next day they eventually agreed to let me do more things outside like bringing my friends from the park over. 

I still couldn't get that voice from the cave out of my head though. 

So the next day me and Charley went back to the cave. I yelled and yelled for the voice to speak again but came up with nothing. 

As I was about to leave the cave Charley brought me a torn piece of paper from the cave. I grabbed it and opened my eyes on shock. On the front page it said, 

Anniversary of the death of hiker who got lost in cave. 

The thing that shocked me was that the dead hiker had [MY](https://reddit.com/r/lingeringshadows/s/EOc5LeuIKQ) last name.
