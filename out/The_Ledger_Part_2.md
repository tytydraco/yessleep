The Baalzephon collection took three weeks and ended with a payment plan that involved garnishing wages from a demon's investments in three different stock markets across two dimensions. After that came collections that made Baalzephon look simple.

Six months into the job, I stopped collecting from humans entirely.

Now I collected from things that shouldn't owe debts. Things that existed before debt was a concept. Things that had been gods when humanity was still learning to make fire.

A djinn who owed for services rendered during the Crusades. A minor deity of forgotten rivers who'd borrowed power and never returned it. A thing that lived in the spaces between mirrors and owed rent for occupying reflective surfaces across seventeen major cities. An angel—fallen or risen, I couldn't tell—who'd defaulted on a contract so old the paper had turned to dust and the terms existed only in Ashmedai's memory.

I collected from all of them.

And I survived.

I shouldn't have. By every law of probability and supernatural hierarchy, I should have died a dozen times over. The djinn should have burned me to ash. The river god should have drowned me in waters that existed in no physical space. The mirror-thing should have pulled me into the glass and left me trapped in reflection forever.

But I didn't die.

I learned. I adapted. I became very, very good at not dying.

And something inside me changed.

The insomnia came first. I'd lie in bed watching shadows move across my ceiling in patterns that spelled words in languages I didn't know but somehow understood. The words were contracts. Terms and conditions. Debts and payments. My ceiling had become a ledger, and I was reading it in my sleep.

When I did sleep, I dreamed in other people's memories. Other things' memories. I dreamed I was a creature of living flame negotiating with a merchant in ancient Babylon. I dreamed I was something with too many eyes watching the birth of the first ocean. I dreamed I was Ashmedai, young and human and desperate, signing a contract in blood that wasn't entirely his own.

I woke from these dreams with words on my tongue that tasted like copper and ozone and the moment before lightning strikes.

My apartment developed cold spots that moved. I'd be making coffee in the kitchen and walk through a pocket of air so cold my breath fogged, and then it would drift into the living room like it was following me. Searching for me. Learning me.

Things appeared in my peripheral vision. Not the shadows and monsters I'd learned to see through the veil—those were constant now, unavoidable, just part of how I perceived the world. These were different. These were things that existed in the corner of my eye and vanished when I turned to look. Shapes that were almost familiar. Faces that were almost mine.

My reflection started arriving late.

I'd look in the bathroom mirror and see the empty room behind me for a fraction of a second before my reflection appeared, stepping into frame like an actor who'd missed their cue. And when it did appear, it didn't always match my movements exactly. Sometimes it smiled when I didn't. Sometimes it moved its lips like it was speaking words I couldn't hear.

I stopped looking in mirrors when I could avoid it.

My hands changed. The skin grew tougher, less sensitive. I could touch hot pans without flinching, hold ice until it melted, press my palm against the blade of a knife and feel only distant pressure. I was becoming harder. Less breakable. Less human.

And I could see them now. All of them. All the time.

The woman on the subway whose shadow had wings. The man at the coffee shop whose reflection showed something with antlers and too many fingers. The child in the park who turned to look at me with eyes that were windows into somewhere else, somewhere vast and dark and full of watching things.

I saw the world as it really was. Layered. Thin. A membrane stretched over something much larger and much older and much hungrier than the human world pretended to be.

I mentioned it to Ashmedai once.

"You're developing the sight," he said, not looking up from his paperwork. "It's natural. The more you collect from them, the more you become like them. The more you see what they see."

"And the dreams? The cold spots? The reflection?"

"Side effects. Your consciousness is expanding. You're existing in multiple states simultaneously. The human part of you is still anchored to your body, but the rest—" He gestured vaguely. "The rest is learning to exist elsewhere."

"I don't want to exist elsewhere. I want to exist here. In my body. As a human."

He looked up then. His eyes were patient, ancient, and utterly without sympathy. "Then you chose the wrong job."

The collection that should have killed me came on a Tuesday.

The debtor's name was unpronounceable—the Ledger entry showed a symbol that hurt to look at, something that twisted in on itself like a Möbius strip made of angles that shouldn't exist. Ashmedai had written a phonetic approximation below it: "Yth'naal."

"What is it?" I asked.

"Old," Ashmedai said. "Older than most gods. Older than the concept of gods. It existed before worship, before belief, before humans had the cognitive capacity to imagine something greater than themselves."

"What does it owe?"

"A favor. Rendered in 3200 BCE. Payment was deferred at the time, with interest accruing at standard rates."

I calculated the interest on a debt that old. The number was astronomical. Literally—it was measured in stellar cycles and the lifespan of galaxies.

"What could something that old possibly give us as payment?"

"That's between it and me. Your job is to collect. To make contact, present the debt, and secure acknowledgment of payment terms."

"Where is it?"

Ashmedai wrote an address. Not a street address. A set of coordinates. Latitude, longitude, and a third number I didn't recognize.

"What's the third coordinate?"

"Depth," he said. "You'll need to go down."

The coordinates led me to an abandoned subway station in the oldest part of the city. The entrance had been sealed decades ago, the stairs blocked with concrete and rebar. But someone—something—had broken through. The concrete was cracked, the rebar bent outward like it had been pushed from below.

I descended.

The stairs went down farther than they should have. Farther than the subway system extended. Farther than the bedrock. I counted steps until I lost count, until the numbers stopped meaning anything, until I realized I'd been walking down for an hour and the stairs showed no sign of ending.

The air changed as I descended. It grew thick, heavy, like breathing through wet cloth. It tasted old. Not stale—old. Like I was inhaling air that had been trapped since the formation of the earth, air that had never touched the surface, air that had existed in darkness so complete it had become a physical thing.

The stairs finally ended at a tunnel. Not a subway tunnel—this was older, rougher, carved from stone by something that didn't use tools. The walls were covered in marks that might have been writing or might have been the tracks of something dragging itself through the dark.

I had a flashlight. It barely penetrated the darkness. The beam seemed to stop after a few feet, absorbed by the air itself.

I walked.

The tunnel sloped downward. The marks on the walls grew more frequent, more frantic. They overlapped, layered on top of each other, like whatever made them had been trying to write the same message over and over, trying to get it right, trying to make itself understood.

I tried not to look at them too closely. When I did, they moved. Rearranged themselves. Spelled words in languages that predated language.

The tunnel opened into a chamber.

It was vast. My flashlight couldn't find the walls or ceiling. The darkness here was absolute, total, the kind of darkness that existed before light was invented. The kind of darkness that light was created to push back against.

And in that darkness, something breathed.

Not air moving in and out of lungs. This was deeper. Slower. The breathing of something so large that each breath took minutes. Each exhalation moved the air in the chamber like wind, carrying with it a smell that made my hindbrain scream.

It smelled like the bottom of the ocean. Like the space between stars. Like the moment before the universe began, when there was nothing but potential and hunger and the terrible patience of things that could wait forever.

"Yth'naal," I said. My voice was small, swallowed by the dark. "I'm here about a debt."

The breathing stopped.

For a moment, there was only silence. Perfect, complete, suffocating silence.

Then something moved in the darkness.

I couldn't see it. My flashlight showed nothing. But I could feel it moving, could sense the displacement of air, could hear the sound of something massive shifting position. Stone grinding. Water dripping. The wet sound of flesh sliding against itself.

And then it spoke.

It didn't use words. It didn't use sound. It spoke directly into my mind, bypassing my ears entirely, and the sensation was like having my skull opened and something poured directly into my brain.

*DEBT.*

The word carried weight. History. Meaning that went beyond definition. I understood, in that moment, what debt meant to something like this. Not money. Not obligation. Not even payment.

Debt was connection. Debt was relationship. Debt was the acknowledgment that something had been given and something was owed and that exchange created a bond that transcended time and space and the death of universes.

*I REMEMBER.*

Images flooded my mind. Not memories—I was experiencing something else's memories, seeing through eyes that weren't eyes, perceiving time in a way that made my human consciousness scream.

I saw the world when it was young. When the continents were different shapes. When things that would become gods were still learning what they were. When Ashmedai was—

The image cut off. Blocked. Like something had reached into my mind and closed a door.

*THE DEBT IS ACKNOWLEDGED.*

"Payment," I managed to say. My voice was shaking. My hands were shaking. Everything was shaking. "Payment terms need to be established."

*PAYMENT.*

The word was different this time. Heavier. Darker. It carried implications that made my stomach turn.

*WHAT DOES THE COLLECTOR OFFER?*

"I'm not offering anything. You owe—"

*ALL DEBTS ARE EXCHANGES. YOU COME TO COLLECT. WHAT DO YOU OFFER IN RETURN FOR PAYMENT?*

I didn't understand. That's not how debt collection worked. The debtor paid. The collector collected. There was no exchange, no offering, no—

And then I understood.

This thing was old enough that it existed before the concept of one-sided transactions. Before the idea that debt could be extracted without exchange. In its understanding of reality, everything was trade. Everything was balance. If it gave payment, it received something in return.

And it wanted to know what I was offering.

"Information," I said, thinking fast. "I offer information about the current state of the world. About what's changed since you last walked the surface."

*INSUFFICIENT.*

"Knowledge. I offer knowledge of—"

*INSUFFICIENT.*

"Then what do you want?"

The darkness moved closer. I could feel it pressing against me, surrounding me, seeping into my pores like water.

*I WANT TO SEE THROUGH YOUR EYES.*

"What?"

*YOU ARE YOUNG. NEW. YOU SEE THE WORLD AS IT IS NOW. I HAVE BEEN HERE TOO LONG. I HAVE FORGOTTEN WHAT THE SURFACE LOOKS LIKE. WHAT LIGHT LOOKS LIKE. WHAT TIME LOOKS LIKE WHEN IT MOVES FORWARD INSTEAD OF CIRCLING.*

*LET ME SEE THROUGH YOUR EYES. LET ME REMEMBER WHAT IT IS TO MOVE THROUGH THE WORLD. AND I WILL PAY THE DEBT.*

Every instinct I had screamed no. Letting something like this into my head, into my perception, into my experience of reality—that was worse than death. That was contamination. That was losing myself in something so vast and old and alien that I'd never find my way back.

But I thought about the debt. About the astronomical number in the Ledger. About what Ashmedai would do if I came back empty-handed.

About the fact that I'd survived this long by being smart, by being adaptable, by being willing to do what needed to be done.

"How long?" I asked.

*ONE DAY. ONE ROTATION OF YOUR WORLD. I WILL SEE THROUGH YOUR EYES, AND THEN I WILL WITHDRAW, AND THE DEBT WILL BE PAID.*

"You can't control me. You can't make me do anything. You just observe."

*AGREED.*

"And after one day, you leave. Completely. No residue, no connection, no—"

*AGREED.*

I should have said no. Should have walked away. Should have told Ashmedai this debt was uncollectable.

But I didn't.

"Agreed," I said.

The darkness rushed into me.

It felt like drowning. Like being buried alive. Like having my skull filled with cold water and ancient stone and the weight of millennia. I felt Yth'naal pour into my consciousness, spreading through my neural pathways like ink in water, touching every memory, every thought, every sensation.

And then it settled. Became still. Became a presence in the back of my mind, watching through my eyes, experiencing my experience, remembering what it was to exist in time that moved forward.

I could feel its satisfaction. Its relief. Its terrible, patient joy.

*THE DEBT WILL BE PAID AT SUNSET TOMORROW. GO. SHOW ME THE WORLD.*

I walked back through the tunnel. Up the endless stairs. Out into the city.

And for the next twenty-four hours, I was not alone in my own head.

Yth'naal watched everything. The sunlight—it had forgotten sunlight, and feeling it through my skin made it shudder with something like pleasure. The people on the street—it studied their faces, their movements, their small human concerns with the fascination of an entomologist examining insects. The sky—it stared at the sky through my eyes for an hour, watching clouds move, watching birds fly, watching the blue expanse that it hadn't seen in thousands of years.

It didn't speak. Didn't interfere. Just watched.

But I could feel it. Feel its presence. Feel its thoughts brushing against mine like cobwebs. Feel its ancient, inhuman consciousness trying to understand the world through my limited, human perception.

I didn't sleep that night. Couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I felt Yth'naal pressing closer, curious about dreams, about the human unconscious, about what happened when awareness dimmed.

I kept my eyes open until sunrise.

At sunset the next day, exactly twenty-four hours after our agreement, Yth'naal withdrew.

It pulled out of my mind like a tide receding, leaving behind a residue of itself—memories that weren't mine, knowledge I shouldn't have, an understanding of time and space and existence that my human brain wasn't designed to contain.

And in my bank account, a deposit appeared. Not money. Something else. A credit in the Ledger, marked as payment received, worth more than any currency.

I went back to the office. Ashmedai was waiting.

"You let it into your head," he said. Not a question.

"It was the only way to collect."

"That was dangerous. Stupid. You could have lost yourself completely."

"But I didn't."

He studied me for a long moment. "No. You didn't. You're stronger than I thought. Or more foolish. I haven't decided which."

"The debt is paid."

"Yes. It is." He made a note in the Ledger. "You should rest. You look—" He paused. "Different."

I did feel different. Like something inside me had been rearranged. Like Yth'naal's presence had changed the architecture of my consciousness, leaving rooms and corridors that hadn't been there before.

"I'm fine," I said.

"No," Ashmedai said. "You're not. But you will be. Eventually. After you adjust."

"Adjust to what?"

"To what you're becoming."

He didn't elaborate.

I went home. Looked in the mirror.

My reflection looked back at me with eyes that were darker than they should be. Deeper. Like they went back farther than my skull should allow.

I looked away quickly.

The next day, Miriam Ashford called.

"You need to come see me," she said. "Now. Ashmedai told me about the Yth'naal collection. You shouldn't have survived that. The fact that you did means something. Something important. Something we need to discuss."

I drove to her house. She was waiting on the porch, her face grim.

"Come inside," she said. "And take off your shoes. You're tracking something."

I looked down. My shoes looked clean.

"Not dirt," she said. "Essence. You've got something clinging to you. Something old. Take them off."

I took off my shoes.

Inside, her house smelled like sage and old paper and ozone. She led me to a room I hadn't seen before—a study lined with books, the walls covered in symbols drawn in what looked like silver paint.

"Sit," she said, pointing to a chair inside a circle drawn on the floor.

I sat.

She sat across from me, outside the circle, and studied my face for a long moment.

"You let it in," she said. "You let something that old, that powerful, into your consciousness. Do you have any idea what you've done?"

"I collected the debt. That's my job."

"Your job is to survive. And you just did something that should have killed you or driven you insane or turned you into something that isn't human anymore." She leaned forward. "Why aren't you dead?"

"I don't know."

"That's what we need to find out." She stood, walked to a shelf, and pulled down a book. Old leather, no title, pages that looked like they'd been hand-written centuries ago. "I've been researching. Ever since Ashmedai hired you, I've been researching. Because he doesn't hire normal people. He doesn't hire people who can just collect debts. He hires people who can survive collecting debts from things that should kill them."

"What are you saying?"

"I'm saying there's something about you. Something that makes you resistant to contamination. Something that lets you touch the divine and the demonic and the ancient without being destroyed by it." She opened the book, turned pages covered in dense text and diagrams. "I think you're a conduit."

"A what?"

"A conduit. A person who can channel power without being consumed by it. It's rare. Very rare. Most people who try to interact with entities like Yth'naal are destroyed—their consciousness is overwhelmed, their body burns out, their soul is shredded. But conduits can hold that power. Temporarily. They can let it flow through them without being destroyed."

"I've never heard of that."

"Most people haven't. Because most conduits don't survive long enough to be documented. They're found by things like Ashmedai, used until they burn out, and then discarded." She looked at me with something that might have been pity. "You're not his employee. You're his tool. And he's using you to collect debts from entities that no normal person could approach."

I thought about the collections. About the djinn, the river god, the mirror-thing, the angel. About how I'd survived encounters that should have killed me.

About how Ashmedai had known I would survive.

"If I'm a conduit," I said slowly, "what happens when I burn out?"

"You die. Or worse—you become a hollow. A shell. Something that looks human but isn't anymore. Something that exists only to channel power for whoever owns you."

"Ashmedai doesn't own me."

"Doesn't he?" She closed the book. "You signed a contract. You work for him. You collect debts that benefit him. You're changing, becoming less human, more like the things you collect from. How is that different from ownership?"

I didn't have an answer.

"That's why I'm going to teach you," Miriam said. "Not just protection magic. Not just how to survive. I'm going to teach you how to stay yourself. How to maintain your humanity even when you're channeling things that are fundamentally inhuman. How to be a conduit without becoming a hollow."

"Can that be done?"

"I don't know. But we're going to try."
