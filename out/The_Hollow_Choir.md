Log 1: “The Tapes”
Case 041: Subject – Eleanor Brigs, Mother of missing/deceased minor, Adalyn Brigs (7).

⸻

DAY 1 – INTERVIEW ROOM 3A

Detective Mara Keller (Audio Log):

We watched the tapes.

We shouldn’t have, but we did. Not all of them. Not the full length of any. Just… seconds. Enough.

There’s no music. Not really. Just a tone. It rises when the girl screams. Drops when she whimpers. Every sound she makes is followed by something mechanical in the background—like someone shifting gears or pulling a lever. And then you hear a click. Like someone was marking it. Cataloguing it.

Eleanor Brigs hasn’t spoken a word in 96 hours.

She won’t eat. Won’t sleep unless sedated. Her arms are wrapped in gauze from elbow to palm—five inches of clean, even stab wounds, likely self-inflicted. She used a steak knife from her kitchen drawer. If the dog hadn’t barked and the neighbor hadn’t knocked, she would’ve bled out on the laminate floor.

This is the first time we’re allowed to talk to her.

DAY 2 – INTERVIEW ROOM 3A (Extended)
Detectives Keller and Reese present. Subject: Eleanor Brigs.

Detective Mara Keller (Audio Log):
She still won’t look at us.

She stares at the corner of the room like something’s perched there. Not afraid. Just… watching. She hasn’t spoken in days. But this time, she opened her mouth. And the first thing she said wasn’t about the case.

It was about the moment she tried to die.

⸻

Eleanor Brigs (Transcript Excerpt):
It wasn’t like in the movies.

There was no dramatic piano. No rain. No tears on the mirror as I stared into my own face. I didn’t even cry.

I had just taken the trash out. The bag was leaking—egg yolk and cat food and whatever else. I remember the drip pattern on the pavement.

I stood in the kitchen for twenty-seven minutes. I counted the seconds. I kept opening and closing the drawer like I was waiting for it to change what was inside.

It didn’t. Just the same steak knives. Set of six. I picked the one with the smoothest handle.

You’d think it’d be fast. Like in those true crime shows. But it’s not. You hesitate, even after deciding. Your body tries to save itself. Even when your brain says “no more,” your hands shake.

I sat down on the floor. Cold linoleum. I made sure the dog was locked in the bathroom. I didn’t want her to see.

Then I pressed it in, slow. Not a jab. A press. Like trying to open a tight jar. You have to commit. If you don’t go deep enough, it just tears skin and leaves you screaming.

So I committed.

Felt the pop when it went through the muscle wall.

I couldn’t breathe. It wasn’t the pain—it was the shock. Your mind blanks. You forget your own name. I remember thinking, “Why is it warm?” Like I didn’t know blood would be warm.

I laid back. I saw the kitchen light bulb above me flickering.

I thought, This is what she saw. Maybe in that place. Maybe in that room. She laid there under some bulb just like this, and maybe she thought of me.

I wanted to die where she couldn’t see me. So she’d never know what I did. How I let her go. How I lost her.

But the dog wouldn’t stop barking.

Scratching the door. Howling. I think… I think she knew.

Then I heard the knocking. Neighbor. Mr. Garrison. I heard his key in the lock. I wanted to yell “don’t come in,” but I couldn’t speak. I was choking on my own blood.

Next thing I remember was white light. And someone yelling “We’ve got a bleeder.”

I wanted to tell them to let me go.

But they didn’t.

And now I’m here.

Detective Reese (Softly):
You were found in time, Eleanor. You survived.

Eleanor:
I wasn’t supposed to.
Not after what I saw on the tape.
Not after what I remembered  

DAY 3 – INTERVIEW ROOM 3A
Detective Mara Keller and Detective Colin Reese present.

Mara:
Can you hear me, Eleanor?

(Pause. She’s staring through us.)

Reese:
You’re safe now. No one here’s going to hurt you.

(She finally blinks. Her eyes twitch like she’s seeing something flickering just out of frame.)

Mara:
We just want to know what happened. Anything you can remember.

(Long silence. Then:)

Eleanor (softly):
She liked grape popsicles. I never… I never bought them. Too sticky. But she used her own quarters one time from the change jar. You remember little things like that. You forget birthdays, but you remember that she sat on the porch in that purple shirt, holding a melting popsicle with two missing front teeth.

(Silence.)

Mara:
Was that the last time you saw her?

Eleanor:
No. The last time was… worse.

⸻

DAY 4 – INTERVIEW ROOM 3A
Subject sedated the night before due to violent self-harm episode. Interview resumed after medical clearance.

Eleanor:
I saw her… on the tape.

She wasn’t dead. Not yet.

I didn’t even know they had her. I thought she ran away. I was so angry, Mara. I yelled at her that morning for forgetting her homework. Told her she’d never get anywhere acting like a child.

She looked me in the eye and said, “I won’t ever be a child again.” And I laughed. I laughed.

The tape didn’t have any laughing.

It had… the drain.

They put her somewhere—somewhere underground. You could hear the water gurgling, like old pipes. And this buzzing—constant buzzing, like a dentist’s drill but lower, slower. You could feel it under your skin.

She didn’t scream at first. She just… asked for me. “Mommy?” Over and over. Like it was a prayer.

And then something opened. A hatch? A door? I don’t know. You couldn’t see anything. Just her face tilting toward the sound. And then she started to cry.

DAY 7 – INTERVIEW ROOM 3A
Subject provided food under surveillance. Broke down after watching 5 seconds of recovered footage.

Reese:
We can stop, Eleanor. We don’t need to go any further.

Eleanor:
No. You do.

Because I know who it was.

(Pause.)

Mara:
Okay. We’re listening.

Eleanor:
It was the man from the funeral.

He wore a gray suit. Cheap. Wrinkled like he pulled it out of a drawer. But he brought flowers—her flowers. The same lilies she used to pick from the neighbor’s yard when I wasn’t looking. That’s how I knew. Nobody knew that.

He handed them to me and said, “She’s in a better place.” But he didn’t look sad.

He looked full. Like he’d eaten.

⸻

DAY 9 – FIELD NOTE ADDENDUM
Based on Eleanor’s description, search warrant executed at Brigs residence. Evidence collected from basement laundry room.

Mara (Recording):
We searched the laundry room. Found DNA behind the detergent bottles—on the back corner of the shelf, like someone was pressing their head into it. Hair follicles. Male. Matched to—

An 81-year-old man from a nursing home three miles away.

Arthur Langley. Eleanor’s great uncle. No visitors in years. No access to a vehicle. Diagnosed with Alzheimer’s.

When we brought him in, he said:

⸻

ARTHUR LANGLEY – AUDIO EXCERPT

“She told me to do it. She said the choir needed to practice. I just opened the door.”

⸻

DAY 12 – INTERVIEW ROOM 3A

Eleanor:
I’d leave the house sometimes. I didn’t think twice. Grocery store. Hair appointments. I’d be gone an hour or two.

I thought the doors were locked.

But the tape showed her crying in the laundry room. And I saw my green umbrella leaning by the wall.

I hadn’t used that umbrella in years.

⸻

DAY 30 – CLOSING INTERVIEW, LOG 1
Detectives Keller and Reese debriefing.

Mara:
So far, seven children. All connected by DNA to Arthur Langley’s fingerprints. All within a five-mile radius. But Eleanor’s daughter was the only one filmed. The only one whose tape was sent back.

That means something.

The team’s calling it “The Hollow Choir”—not just because of what Langley said, but because of what’s in the tapes.

The tone beneath the footage? It’s voices. A blend of different pitches. Audio forensics says it’s actually children singing—but the recordings were slowed, stretched, reversed, and layered. An audio collage of agony. Some of them are still missing.

We still don’t know why.

But we’re going to keep asking.
