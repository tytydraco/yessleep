Twenty years ago, I lived in a small, remote village in the outskirts of Sindh, Pakistan. A village so isolated that it seemed untouched by time and the people clung to old stories, passed down through generations. Life was simple there, quieter than the bustle of the cities, and at times, it felt almost magical.

We had festivals every month or so—grand carnivals that brought Sufi singers, folk storytellers, and wandering traders. It was a celebration of life, community, and heritage. We would laugh and sing and play the traditional games that our ancestors had taught us. And at night, beneath a sky full of stars, the village elders would tell stories—tales of old Sindhi folklore, tales of love, religion, and bravery.

I grew up with only one other kid of my age and her name was Sahar. Our village was so remote that we spent nearly every moment together. We’d walk to school, a long trek that took us over dry hills and across narrow, winding paths. Sometimes we’d talk about the stories we heard from the elders, imagining we were the heroes or heroines of old, facing off against jinn and otherworldly forces.

But there was only one thing the elders warned us about more than anything else: *The Woods.*

The woods that stretched beyond the village were forbidden. They were thick and gnarled, tangled with roots and shadows that seemed to grow darker the deeper you went. There was an old woman who lived there, they said, a woman no one had seen in years. The elders would look at each other, their faces tightening with a fear they rarely showed, and they’d say, *"Stay away from the woods. She keeps to herself, but her presence is a bad omen, and if by chance you see her; don’t let her touch you.”*

We were children of course, so we obeyed our elders but there is only so much you can do in a village that doesn’t have any other entertainment available. We tried our best to avoid the woods even after coming home from school. We would end up playing ludo outside in the Otaq all night long as our elders played Sufi music together.

“Would you like to check it out?” Sahar asked me innocently

“No, Baba had forbidden us”

“Don’t be such a scaredy cat”

Suddenly, it had started raining and we all were forced to come inside our homes. We said our goodbyes and went to sleep.

The next morning, the sky was clear but it was a windy day. I had decided to not go to the school but the sound of Sahar outside my house had tempted me to give in. When we walked to the school, we found out that the school had been closed due to the heavy rain of last night and we had to walk back home.  

The sky had gotten a lot darker; I think there was a storm coming, most of the paths leading up to our village had been flooded and we couldn’t take the way back home easily. That’s when I felt my arm being pulled “I think we have to go through the woods”

“No way, you know Babajan would get mad”

“Well, it’s either that or we end up dying here. What do you suppose?”

She was annoying but she was right. I figured, Babajan would understand right?

The sky hung heavy with an oppressive darkness, clouds roiling and swirling like a tempestuous sea. The air was thick and laden with the earthy scent of wet soil, as if the very ground was exhaling its last breath. Each gust of wind sent shivers down my spine. The coldness settled in my bones, an unsettling chill that seeped deep, making me feel as if the very essence of life was being sucked out of me.

As we went deeper into the woods, the trees loomed over us, their twisted branches clawing at the air.

“What if we see her?”, I asked

“Don’t let her touch you or she’ll curse you” she teased;

The leaves rustled restlessly beneath our feet, and the shadows crowded us. We heard a branch snapped in the distance, and we saw her.

*The old woman*

She was standing by the path, a bent, withered figure draped in tattered robes. Her skin hung off her bones, gray and cracked like ancient parchment, and her eyes— they were…. *milky white*, like she’d been blind for centuries. She looked right at us. No…she saw us, in a way that pierced through flesh and bone, straight into our souls.

“*Are you from the village?*” she asked, her voice as dry as the desert wind. I remember my throat closing up, the words sticking there like glue. Sahar nodded, too scared to speak.

The woman’s cracked lips twisted into something resembling a smile. “Be careful,” she rasped. “A plague is coming to your village. Stay away from the water.”

I tried to brush her off, laugh it away like the foolish child I was. But when I glanced at Sahar, her face had gone pale—white as a ghost. Her lips trembled, and before I could even say a word, she grabbed my arm and bolted. We ran, the sound of our footsteps and the rain splashing through the mud, until we reached the safety of the village.

“What happened?” I asked Sahar; “Why did we run?”

“That old woman, she is supposed to be dead…. dead for centuries…. she shouldn’t exist”

“It must have been someone playing a prank on us, we shouldn’t have run.”

“Do not speak of this to anyone; promise me?”

“Do not be a fool”

“I said, promise me!”; She yelled

“I promise” I replied

We never spoke of it again, not for a long time. But things began to change after that. Strange things. The air around the village felt heavier, thicker. Sahar was the first to shut herself away. She stopped coming to school, stopped leaving her house altogether. When I asked her why, all she would say was, “I saw her. I felt her. She touched me, she has cursed me.”

I didn’t believe her. I refused to believe her. But then, *she fell ill*.

It started with fever, then boils—dark, festering sores that erupted across her skin, she had a terrible fever for days until one day, she vomited blood, stood up and collapsed right on the floor.

It didn’t stop with her. It spread. First, it was a few people, then a few more. Soon, the entire village was stricken. No one could explain it—no doctor, no healer. The elders whispered that the old woman had returned to bring a curse, to punish us for trespassing into her woods. I heard them speak of it in hushed tones, but it wasn’t just talk anymore. It was real. The plague consumed the village, took everyone it could, including my parents.

The village was nothing but a graveyard now, the grounds was scattered with blood and disease-ridden bodies, I was the only one left alone, *why was I left alone?* I had to leave, I had to run away…I had no choice.

When I finally left, the land had turned sour. And eventually, the village itself faded from memory, swallowed by time and the sands of the desert. I didn’t dare go back, no one could. It was a cursed place. A place that didn’t exist to me anymore.

I moved to the city, made a life for myself—something I never thought I’d be able to do after everything I’d seen. I got married, started a family. My wife, my children—they became my world. And the village became a distant, shadowy dream. I told myself the curse had stayed behind, buried with the dead. The old woman had touched Sahar; she might have saved me from her curse; maybe that’s why I was spared.

*But last night, she came back.*

It started with a dream. At least, I think it was a dream. I woke to find Sahar standing in my bedroom, her figure barely visible in the dark, just a shadow against the wall. My heart raced, my mind screaming that it couldn’t be real—she was dead, long gone, buried in that forsaken village. But there she was. And I knew, deep down, that it wasn’t a dream.

She whispered; *"You survived before…but not anymore."*

“Please don’t touch me!” I wanted to yell on top of my lungs but I couldn’t. I couldn’t move. My body was paralyzed with fear. I wanted to scream, to wake my wife, but I couldn’t.....

I woke up with a cold sweat the next morning, thanking God that it had all been nothing but a dream. I brewed my coffee and told my kids that they can skip the school today. I would be taking them to the zoo.

“Why?”

“Every day is a blessing, don’t forget darling”

The kids roared in excitement and we smiled from ear to ear. I had decided I would go into work today and take an early leave. I had some unfinished work to do.

I clocked into work and went straight to my desk to pick up some papers…. that’s when I heard my phone ring…it was…….my wife….

*“Baby…please come home quickly…. it’s our daughter…she’s puking blood….”*
