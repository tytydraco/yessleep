Relying on my internal approximation of time and understanding of daylight and its derivative, I must conclude that I woke up in what seemed to be the morning. The “sun” which shone above me, radiating particles alien to what my porous flesh had become accustomed to, produced sensations of pain across my rough, parched skin. Upon internalizing the uncomfortability of my prone position, where I appeared to have been left undisturbed for the totality of the quiet hours, I slowly stood erect. Jolts of pain evoked from the visible bruises and cuts across my skin, which was merely shielded by my unkempt, filthy attire. Needles pierced into my kneecaps, as like my earliest forefather, I stood upon two legs for what I would soon discover to be my punishment: rebirth.

Before me laid a four lane highway positioned within a mighty forest. I, myself, awoke to find that I was within a slim, grassy subdivider. “I-85” noted the impeccably sterile highway sign. “Roanoke 15” noted another, equally starved of dirt and rust. I must confess that in hindsight, the sterile signs and lack of vehicular activity along the highway around me was quite odd, though I beg you to understand that this was not my first instinct upon seeing this new world. My unfamiliar position of slumber remained the most immediate task, as I did not sleep in between two highway roads by choice. In fact, I distinctly recall falling asleep in my Roanoke apartment, approximately fifteen miles away. This was my most pressing concern.

Leaping across the roadway and waiting for a passing car yielded minimal results. I wasn’t able to receive the pleasure of being judged as a junkie vagrant or tramp, as there simply was no one to do so. I waited for what seemed like hours, though the “sun” retained its position directly above me the entire time. As such, it was my duty to walk back home, despite my initial protests.

My homeland, once populated by billions and billions of creatures, both desirable and undesirable in nature, now stood still. If I had known that the previous evening, before I awoke on the highway in possibly another plane, was the last time I’d hear the melody of earth, a harmony of birds, cars, and the ocean singing in unison, perhaps I would have abandoned my temporary concerns in favor of what I now miss most. Along the highway, I stumbled until the skyline of Roanoke stood before me. Right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot. It’s incredible how acute one’s brain becomes upon recognizing that oneself is one’s only source of noise. Right, left, right, left.

Right as I was about to enter the city limits past the surgically clean “Welcome to Roanoke” signage, the “earth” went dark. This is not to say that I fainted or fell unconscious, but rather, the once bright noon-o’clock daylight was converted into moonlight in merely an instant. Akin to the careless flicking of a lightswitch, it was now night time on “earth.”

Darkness invited the lands behind me to recede their oaths to order in a feat of defiance with great extremity. The tree branches, now the arms of masterful martial artists, swung purposefully, reaching towards me with malice. Their supporting trunks, now possessing the elasticity of elite gymnasts, bended towards me, only to be constrained to their position by loathsome roots. To my great horror, they lashed at me for hours and hours, perhaps aiming to purge me from “earth,” constantly pleading to their own deities to release them of their shackled position in the ground. It is unnerving to face your own extermination, lashing out upon you merely yards away. Despite its stationary nature, its silent, yet persistent grasping for its own vermin, continued until, akin to a light switch, it was once again noon-o’clock. A fever dream perhaps, or a premonition of what was to come, the essence and inhabitants of this foreign land aimed to intimidate me; release me from my leech-like grasp on its sickened body. Perhaps, akin to a leech, I should consider my lifespan to be halved, or at least numbered in a certain regard.

I write to you from the confines of my Roanoke apartment, isolated from the plane or realm or planet for what I consider to be my home. I faced little opposition in my trek following the midnight horrors, as there simply was no one to stand before me. The streets of Roanoke, and the businesses and homes which lined them, possessed no indication of life. Instead, they stood erect, still and staunch, and spotless in their span. Perhaps I should be concerned of the menacing preparations of the sterile lands around me, though I am afraid such luxury has not been afforded to me. The midnight switch approaches, and I wish to be shielded from the horrors before me. Goodbye for now. I will update if I survive the midnight chaos of my alien new home.
