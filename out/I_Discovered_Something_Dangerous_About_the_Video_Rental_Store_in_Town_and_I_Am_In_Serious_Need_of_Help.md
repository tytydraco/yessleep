Before I get into what happened next, if you haven’t seen my post about the first tape I watched from Final Cut Video, you might want to read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/4ZFVNA9VZq). It’ll help you understand everything that’s happened up to this point.


I told myself I’d return the tape and be done with it, but I couldn’t shake what I’d seen on the film and in real life. 

The entirety of last night played on a loop, from the tape’s final scene to the silent crowd standing outside my house. 

No matter how hard I tried to rationalize it, those gruesome images gnawed at me. 

My thoughts churned with a question I didn’t have an answer to, “Who were those people and what did they want from me?”.  I couldn’t just sit at home pretending it hadn’t happened, the unease had become unbearable. 

I needed to see them again to understand if what I’d witnessed was real.

After work earlier tonight, I drove back to Final Cut Video.

I thought about the phone call from the night before with Fulci and the way his voice had been unnervingly calm about everything. 

A part of me wanted to storm behind the counter and demand answers, but I knew that wouldn’t get me anywhere besides a jail cell with charges pressed against me.

I wanted desperately to know why he called, but I knew deep down I’d have to approach this another way.

I listened to the voice of reason inside me that advised against going in guns blazing. 

I couldn’t risk revealing that I was coming back to get another tape to investigate, not when every fiber of my being screamed that everything about this place wasn’t exactly ordinary. 

I took a deep breath, shoved the questions back into the deepest corners of my mind, and pushed the door open with a casualness that I didn’t feel.

When I walked in, I did my best to pretend like all I had come in for was another rental. 

I noticed Hooper and Roth were nowhere to be found. In fact, the store was completely empty minus Fulci who greeted me from behind the counter while he organized a small pile of tapes. 

“Hey, friend,” he spoke with a knowing smile. “Did you watch it?” 

His words made me slightly wince due to last night’s experience.

“Yeah,” I admitted, rubbing the back of my neck. “You weren’t kidding, it was a rough watch. It took me a bit to actually get through it.”

“Rough’s just another word for real.” His eyes twinkled with curiosity as I handed him the tape to return.

“Was that... found footage or like, a re-creation or what? It seemed pretty real.” I tried to sound calm, but Fulci probably saw right through me. 

He didn’t answer my question; he just watched me for a moment, as if deciding how much I was ready to hear. Then, without a word, he ducked behind the counter and retrieved a cardboard box full of more beat-up VHS tapes. 

One by one, he sifted through them, the reels clacking softly inside their cases before he stopped and handed me one he decided upon.

“I think you will enjoy this one a lot. I’ve watched this one probably a handful of times now and it gets better with every viewing.”

He handed me a VHS case that had no art, a single phrase scrawled in shaky, black Sharpie on a mustard yellow sticker:

*Followed Home then Killed*

I nodded and stared at the tape in my hands, feeling like I was carrying something that wasn’t meant to be viewed. 

Fulci didn’t say anything, he just stood there watching me behind the counter with his hands folded, similar to how someone waits in line at a grocery store. 

I handed it back to Fulci and a moment later, the brown paper bag he slid across the counter confirmed my rental and I turned to leave. 

As I walked toward the door, I could feel his eyes on me the whole way like he was waiting to see what my reaction would be. Despite him giving me the creeps, I maintained a calm demeanor as I got into my car and drove out of the parking lot.

On the drive home, I couldn’t help but notice a van following a few cars behind me in my rear view mirror. 

It was old and dented all to hell with white paint reminiscent of dandruff flaking off both sides. I tried my best not to give it much thought until I turned onto my street and it did the same.

I knew not to panic, I had heard in the past that the best thing to do was to never go to your house but drive to the police station. I decided to test the van behind me to see if it actually was following me. 

I turned left onto a random road in my neighborhood and a moment later, the van did too. I turned right by the ice cream shop, it made the same right turn. 

Every movement I made, the van‘s headlights stayed locked behind me.

I pressed the gas, speeding down a residential street to lose the van. But it sped up, determined not to lose me.

I kept sneaking glances of the van in my rear view mirror as I drove towards the police station.

The engine of the van roared as it surged forward, closing the distance and nailing my back bumper.

BANG.

The force of the impact caused my car to jolt violently forward, my head slamming down onto the steering wheel. 

Blood dripped slowly down my chin from the split bottom lip I had received from the impact. 

The taste of iron filled my mouth as I stomped on the gas, desperately trying to get out of the driver’s sight. 

The van pursued me for maybe another four blocks before it suddenly pulled off and vanished down a random side road.

When I finally reached the police station, I threw my car in park and pulled my phone out to type the van’s license plate in the notes of my phone. 

I sat there and pretended to check my phone afterwards, convinced the van would show up at any moment to finish what they started. 

Thankfully, it never came back. 

When the cold unease festering in my stomach decided to finally leave, I made the drive home. I decided I would take care of the damage at a later date.

I felt calm enough to drive, but my eyes never left the rearview mirror the whole way home.

My body was still shaking from adrenaline when I eventually pulled back into my driveway. I sat in the driver’s seat for a long while before I finally worked up the nerve to finally go inside.

I double-checked the locks and shut every curtain before sitting down to watch the next tape.

I popped it into the VHS player and sat in front of the TV. Like last time, this movie began with no credits or music, it instead focused on a girl walking on a sidewalk at night. 

The person holding the camera was trailing behind at a considerable distance. He commented on how beautiful she looked and said, “she would be fun to play with” as she let herself inside.

Strange choice of dialogue, I thought as I watched the camera wielder hide behind some bushes outside the girl’s house.

The voyeuristic nature of the film was unsettling and it only got stranger as the camera zoomed in on the girl through her bedroom window. 

She had her back turned, folding laundry under the glow of a bedside lamp. I couldn’t shake the feeling I’d seen her before — the hair, the cardigan, it was all so familiar. Then she turned around and made eye contact with the camera. 

The girl let out a terrified screech…it was Hooper.

The camera lurched as Hooper’s sharp screams pierced through the speakers, making me flinch in surprise. 

The man behind the camera didn’t run or shout; he just whispered something I couldn’t make out over the hiss of the tape.

The footage went haywire after that with the sound of doors slamming, hurried footsteps pounding through the house, and the camera shaking violently in pursuit. 

When the cameraperson caught up to Hooper, she begged for her life as a knife was pressed to her throat. 

Tears streamed from her face as the camera tilted, catching only fragments of the struggle before the frame settled on her body being dragged across the hardwood floor by her hair.

Then, the footage cut again, and the camera steadied as it focused on Hooper’s living room. Her parents sat on the couch, arms and legs bound tightly with rope as the cameraman walked into frame. 

He was tall, but his face was hidden well within the shadows of the dark. 

In his right hand, he held a hunting knife, and he pointed with his left, saying something to the camera operator offscreen. The sound was muffled and distorted by the grain, but it sounded like:

“Get this part and God damn it, make it clean this time.”

Then came a brief struggle that caught glimpses of thrashing limbs and furniture scraping against the floor in the struggle. 

The camera rocked back and forth before tumbling sideways, the man and woman crying out in desperation before both were silenced by the knife plunging deep into their throats.

The living room was quiet apart from the rhythmic sound of a knife plunging into flesh. 

The image of the tape began to bleed, the colors changing from a light red to a storm-cloud gray before abruptly cutting to static.

I sat there staring at the flickering screen long after it ended, waiting for something, anything, to tell me that what I’d seen had been staged. 

What the hell was Hooper doing in that film?

I pressed rewind on the VHS player. The VCR whirred and clicked as the film rolled back and as it did, I leaned closer to the screen. 

My heart pounded in my chest as I replayed the living room scene frame by frame, studying every last blurry detail.

I did this maybe two dozen times before I finally saw something that stood out to me. 

I froze the frame and stared. 

I thought my mind was playing tricks on me, but the camera doesn’t lie. 

It was a quick flash of skin on the knife wielder’s neck as he leaned forward to adjust the camera. 

I could see a circular shape in black ink…it was an eyeball tattoo.

My blood turned to ice as the realization settled in.

Fulci.

For the next hour, I combed through the film again, desperate to disprove what I had just seen. 

Maybe it was a recreation of some kind, a weird ARG, or an experimental film. I told myself anything to make the reality feel like fiction. 

The more I analyzed, the more undeniable it felt that I had stumbled onto something more than I had bargained for. 

I’m not sure how long I went over the footage, but eventually I switched off the TV and pulled out my laptop. 

My hands shook as I typed “Final Cut Video” into the Google search bar, but nothing popped up. I couldn’t find any listings, website, or business registrations tied to that name. 

I decided to try different name variations to see what results I could find. I typed in, “Fulci video store,” “Final Cut Clerk,” even “Hooper: *Followed Home Then Killed* Movie”. 

Still…nothing. 

Every result of mine led to a dead end.

Fulci had been right. I wasn’t going to find these on IMDb or the internet.

I thought back to the first tape I had viewed, *The Incident in Summerbrook Forest* and discovered that there had been a mass murder in an area of the same name over in Wisconsin about seven years ago.

I pulled up news articles and forum posts from years past, scrolling through the grainy photographs and police statements. 

Most of the coverage was vague and full of conjecture about a camping trip turned “ritualistic annihilation”, but as I dug deeper, I noticed something. 

According to the reports, only one of the bodies had never been discovered. Despite the reward for any information leading to their discovery, they were never to be seen again.

My stomach twisted at the missing persons picture that was provided of the teenager who had vanished that night.

He was presumed dead, but I knew he was alive because I saw him last night.

It was Roth. 

The more I stared at his photo, the colder I felt, like I had found a piece to a puzzle that I wasn’t sure I wanted to see completed.

My phone buzzed on the table nearby. 

I checked the phone and didn’t recognize the number, but a single video file had been sent. 

I tapped it open and watched the grainy footage shot from outside my house in confusion. At first, I thought it was just someone walking past, but then the camera angle shifted, revealing the front door, the living room, and finally, me on my laptop. 

I felt myself grow rooted to the spot in fear as the lens slowly panned closer, tracking my every movement just as the tape I’d watched had tracked Hooper. 

I ran to the window, determined to see who had been filming me. In the shadow of the oak tree near my house, I could see three figures each holding what looked like handheld cameras that were pointed directly towards my window.

I closed the blinds shut and pulled myself away from the window. I sat in silence and stared at the screen of my phone, dreading a notification from an unknown number that never came.

As the evening went on, the feeling of paranoia persisted as I checked the front window and peeked outside the windows every few minutes. 

I didn’t see anything out of place or anyone in my yard but still, I was deathly anxious. 

I must’ve dozed off on the couch, because the next thing I remember was bolting awake to the sound of glass exploding.

A heavy object fell to the floor amid a hail of glass shards that rained upon me. 

Out of natural reflex, I ducked behind the couch, but my movement wasn’t fast enough to prevent the tiny, bleeding cuts to open my skin. 

The stinging sensation from the glass burned across my arms and neck like a fire from their impact. I groaned in pain as I heard a loud, mechanical thunk, like a car door shutting. 

I peeked up from behind the couch cautiously, feeling cold wind on my face. I walked towards the broken window and watched the van disappear around a street corner down the block.

It was the same one that had followed me earlier.

I turned my attention to the carpet and saw a black VHS case that was taped to a brick. Written in thick, red marker on a white label with yesterday’s date:

**10/26**

I went against my better judgment and put the tape in the VCR, the screen morphed from black, to static, to a faded in shot of the interior of my house.

I shivered as the camera panned slowly through the living room. I realized everything matched exactly the way I had it now: the blanket half-folded on the couch, the empty Dr. Pepper cans I’d left next to the sink, and the various pieces of junk mail still in their envelopes resting on the table.

The footage moved down the hallway before it cut to my bedroom, the camera POV hovering in the doorway. 

I could see myself asleep on the bed, the breathing on the audio grew heavier as it synced with the faint rise and fall of my own chest beneath the sheets. 

For a moment, the frame held perfectly still and focused. But then, without warning, the camera moved closer. 

So close in fact, that the camera was practically pressed up against my face. 

Before anything else could happen, the film cut to black.

The TV screen glowed gray in the dark and my pale, wide-eyed, reflection stared back at me in disbelief at what I had witnessed.

By the time I eventually crawled back into bed, the sky was turning gray, signaling the beginning of a new day. 

I didn’t bother setting an alarm because there wasn’t a chance in hell I was going to sleep anyway.

When I opened the door to go to work this morning, I was expecting maybe a newspaper or a package to be on my doorstep. Instead, there was a single, fresh video rental receipt from Final Cut Video.

This one didn’t have my name on it, but what it did have was tomorrow’s date and a note:

**“Will you join us?”**

I’m completely on my own on this one and I’m in desperate need of help.

I’m in possession of an alleged snuff film; that’s a federal crime and my ass will be in jail in no time if they saw a single frame of what I have in my possession.

I can’t go to the cops, but doing nothing isn’t an option either.

The people running this store…I think they’re sick people who get off on showing this stuff to people.

If I’m right about what’s happening, this might be the last time that I post.

I’ll provide updates when I can, but I fully intend on going back to the store to return this tape and put an end to this.
