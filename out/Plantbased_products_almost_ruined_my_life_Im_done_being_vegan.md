Accepting the challenge of my best friend Lexi, I decided to “go vegan” for a week, with the caveat that she’d pay for all the plant-based meat substitutes. She happily agreed, promising that I’d realize all the things I loved about meat could be easily produced with near-complete verisimilitude in properly spiced & flavored vegan dishes. I was, naturally, doubtful; I explained to her that a big part of meat’s appeal – at least for me – was the texture, something I couldn’t imagine tofu or soy or cauliflower being able to adequately mimic. She replied to this with a sarcastic, vaguely sexual remark, and insisted that I’d leave it all behind once I embraced the world of veganism.  

With a fridge and pantry decently stocked with grains, oats, fruits, veggies, and all varieties of fake cheese and meat-mimicking substances, I whole-heartedly began my week as a vegan. To my surprise, the first few days sped by. I had figured that I’d always be hungry, perpetually unsatisfied by the less-than-cleverly named imitators of beef, chicken, and pork; but with my diet being more fibrous than usual, I found myself getting fuller, faster. I wasn’t necessarily *enjoying* the meat-bereft meals, but with even the most egregious carbs still technically counting as being vegan, I didn’t hate them, either. The surplus of fruits and veggies in my diet was pretty nice, too; I realized just how nutritionally deficient I’d been before, when meat had constituted the bulk of my portions. 

It had all been going so well, until Friday, when it all spiraled out of control. I couldn’t have ever imagined the wholesale chaos that occurred; couldn’t have predicted with any reasonable degree of forethought the events of that disastrous, terrifying morning.  

I woke up feeling unusually hungry, *surprisingly hungry,* since I’d figured that my body had already acclimated to the sudden dietary shift. I hadn’t felt that hungry the previous few days, so I figured that I’d somehow slipped up in getting enough calories the previous day. I got out of bed, headed straight to the kitchen, and with an audibly growling stomach began making myself some berry-mixed cereal; with almond milk and a banana on the side. As I sat at my kitchen table eating, my stomach continued to growl; even as I fed it spoonful after hefty spoonful of cereal. 

There was no accompanying pain, no feelings of indigestion or gastrointestinal unrest; and yet, for some inexplicable reason, it continued to growl. The tummy tumult sounded like a train rumbling along, with my intestines the ill-maintained tracks. I finished up breakfast and did what any reasonable person would do – Google'd my symptoms. After gravely accepting and then promptly dismissing several terminal diagnoses, I decided to see if I could just *walk it off.*  

My “walk” promptly ended after I’d taken about six steps from my sink. I tried to grab ahold of the counter before falling, but my hand slipped, and my face caught the fall. Ordinarily, I would’ve been pretty pissed at my uncharacteristic lack of dexterity; but the flare of pain in my face distracted me somewhat from the sudden and rapidly intensifying agony in my stomach.  

As I lay there on the tile, it felt as if something was pressing against the interior of my stomach, trying to push itself through my gut. There aren’t words – not any that I’ve learned –which could accurately paint a picture of how much excruciating pain I was in. On some cell-deep, sub-primal level, I sensed a force beyond flesh tugging at - or pressing upon - my stomach, manipulating it in some peripheral way. It was as awful as it was perplexing. 

In what I’d hardly describe as my proudest moment, I vomited onto the floor – right near my face. And, as if my body desperately wanted to make me look as pathetic as possible, I went into a spasming fit. For nearly a full minute I writhed around in my vomit; the rank stench of molten bile bringing hot tears to my eyes.  

Unfortunately, I’d left my phone in my room, and couldn’t call the paramedics or poison control. For a few merciful seconds the cataclysmic maelstrom in my stomach let up, and in that short-lived interim I managed to roll away from the smeared pool of esophageal gunk; but then the pain was reignited by some unknown trigger, and I again found myself convulsing uncontrollably.  

For a moment I actually believed that I would die; that I had unwittingly ingested something inimical to human life; some insidious, digestively malignant toxin. I thought back on all I’d eaten, and while some of it had been unsavory, I couldn’t recall anything that had been noticeably unpalatable. No cyanide capsules, no arsenic. Just *Beyond* this, plant-based that, Vegan-friendly and meat-free. Largely harmless stuff millions of people ate without issue every day.  

When a knock sounded at the door, my first thought was that someone had heard my agonized shrieks and come to help. Wretchedly, I crawled from my kitchen to the foyer, leaving a disgusting trail of lumpy slime in my wake. Shuddering, having spent a considerable amount of energy in my deathly paroxysms, I pulled myself up and answered the door.  

There was a man standing there, wearing what appeared to be some kind of hazmat suit. The green, shimmering outfit was like an armor of reflective plastic, with the broad visor the only break in the visually disconcerting monotony. As if I’d called him, he silently nodded and walked past me into my home. He gave the trail of slime a wide berth as he entered my kitchen. Baffled – but also too delirious to try and stop him – I closed the door and followed him into the kitchen, lacking the energy to even vocally protest his unceremonious entry.  

I entered to find him going through my fridge, occasionally setting items on the counter behind him. Feeling immensely woozy, and fearing that I’d again fall right onto my face, I headed over to the table and sat down. From here, I called out to him, asking with a vomit-roughed voice, “Who are you, and why are you going through my fridge?”  

He withdrew his head from the depths of my fridge and turned to me in a manner that seemed to say, *Why would you ask such a ridiculous question?*  

When I simply stared in disbelief, he closed the fridge and came over to me, bearing a few items in hand. One by one he set them on the table as if they were prized possessions, like how a jeweler might set out an assortment of precious gems for a collector’s scrutiny. As my eyes languidly passed over the products, I finally realized that he’d been selecting all the plant-based, pseudo-meat products. With my mental clarity diminishing by the second, I only managed to mutter a, “What?” in response. Luckily, he understood my confusion and said, “Ah, I see. I am the first of my kind to have visited you. Well, I’ve come for your *plant meat.*”  

The way he worded it – and the apparent reverence with which he spoke – creeped me out. The unsettling nature of his speech also served to wake me up a bit, as the fine hairs on my body came to stand on end. I couldn’t exactly make out his face through the breath-enshrouded visor, but I could see his eyes, and they held a strange, frightful intensity in their gaze. The animal subroutines of my mind awoke from their dormancy, wanting to seize control and steer me away from the darkly eyed intruder. 

Not wanting to test a man who’d brazenly walk into someone’s home and plunder their fridge, I weakly motioned toward the items with a gesture that he could go ahead and take them. He nodded with boisterous gratitude, and began unwrapping one of the plant patties. Before I could tell him that he’d still need to cook it first, he loosened his hood at the neck, lifted it up to his mouth, and tossed the patty in. His chewing was loud, drawn out, and repulsing.  

He then spat the mouth-ground mess back onto the table.  

“I tried to warn you, man.”  

His eyes flashed to me, and I recoiled in my chair at the acrid intensity in them.   

“What is this?” His voice had deepened considerably, modulated by a sudden fury. As calmly as I could manage – fearing that the wrong response could bring about physical violence - I explained to him what he’d eaten, and how he probably should’ve cooked it first. As if only just then understanding, he picked up the packaging and read over the ingredients. He then did the same for the other, unopened items; and after closely examining these, he gave the others still in the fridge the same bizarre scrutiny.  

After checking all that my friend had bought me, he came storming back to the table. He threw back his hood and I saw a face that couldn’t have been anything but artificial; the obvious expression thereon being rage, but oddly, uncannily articulated by misaligned – or simply absent – facial muscles. It was pale and glossy, slick with what I could only guess was sweat; as if he’d been burning up in the suit.  

That unnaturally ordered and curiously slimy face alone would’ve given me nightmares for weeks...*but then he just had to go and take it off.*  

The “face” beneath was just plain eldritch; somehow being outright monstrous despite having very little features and parts to it. There was depth, form, and color - gravestone grey - but not much else; and the texture....they say your tongue knows how any surface you look at might feel. And, in my disoriented and hunger-addled state, I found myself imagining what his inhuman face would taste like. 

And I retched, again and again.  

He spoke once more, and the manner in which he accomplished this was so abominable that I had to close my eyes in the middle of his question: “So you mean to tell me that these substances are artificially constructed? That they were neither born nor grown? But....manufactured?”  

With bile rising in my throat, I only managed a self-nauseating nod in affirmation.  

As if I had just told him some terrible, life-destroying news, he – mercifully – replaced his unwholesome face and pulled on his hood, with an air of deep, almost melodramatic sorrow. He glanced at the mess he’d left on the table and shook his head disappointedly. Terrified, but curious, I asked what he’d expected, and he solemnly responded:  

**“This may come as a surprise to you: I hail not from Earth, but from the far-flung planets of an uncharted star system - unreachably remote by terrestrial means - whereon grew, in former cycles, the savory bounties of** ***xeno-flora*****; that's right - meat of t*****he seed and root.*** **But now, naught grows upon those desolate, unsunned spheres, for their local stars have long-since plunged into the very nadir of space; rendering the planets of that system cold and lifeless.  Now, I travel the cosmos, searching for that olden delicacy in other worlds. I thought I'd find it here, on this flourishing planet, where you have plant and animal life in abundance.**  

**I sensed a great quantity of what I had hoped would be the meat-vegetation I desired, here in this home. I made gastro-contact, my stomach communing with yours. I’m sure you felt it, our bile-bonding. Anyway, I realize now that there is not a third option between the two; those two distinct forms of life have not successfully intermixed in this biosphere. Meat does not sprout from your soil; flesh does not drape from your trees. My search must continue. I must move on.”**  

And with that, as briskly and brusquely as he’d entered, he left my home.  

I fainted a few moments later. Unfortunately, the nerve-frying stench of sunbaked vomit aroused me from my impromptu rest. I closed the blinds to all the windows, washed my mouth out in the kitchen sink, and got started on cleaning up the mess I and *my guest* had left throughout the kitchen.  

When my friend called to ask what I’d be having for the weekend, I told her I was ordering a pizza with as much meat as I could fit onto the order.
