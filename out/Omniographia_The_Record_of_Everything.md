Prologue

‚ÄúIn the labyrinthine depths of the human mind lies an enigma so confounding, it defies comprehension‚Äîthe churning abyss of thoughts, desires, and fears, where sanity and madness intertwine in a ceaseless dance. From these shadowed recesses emerges the greatest adversary, not from the outer cosmos, but emerging from within‚Äîan inscrutable power to unravel the fragile threads of reality with but a whisper.‚Äù
 
In the heart of an ancient, forgotten chamber, hidden within the treacherous peaks of the highest mountain of  Celestium Range, lies a library of unspeakable power‚Äîa relic of a bygone age when the stars whispered secrets too gruesome for mortal minds to comprehend. This secluded room, long abandoned and overgrown, was once the sanctuary of a cult devoted to the arcane and the forbidden, worshiping a god they knew little about.
 
Etched with eldritch sigils, the grimoire beckons to those who are chosen to unlock its forbidden knowledge. Within its yellowed pages are the arcane incantations and blasphemous rituals of an occult being, always striving for more. This cosmic entity, with aspirations to challenge even the authority of The Original Keeper, has encoded its dark designs within this tome.
 
But within the grimoire‚Äôs pages lies more than arcane incantations and rituals. It serves as a testament to imagination and inner mysteries, transcending the physical realm to echo through the corridors of consciousness, waiting for those chosen to dare seek them.
 
As the pale moon casts its eerie glow upon the ancient chamber, the air thrums with a palpable sense of dread. Shadows dance along the walls, twisting and contorting like tendrils of malevolent energy eager to ensnare unwary souls. The chamber‚Äôs walls, once resplendent with the grandeur of a lost era, now bear the scars of time and the lingering presence of an otherworldly force. Abandon hope, all ye who enter here.
 
For centuries, the grimoire has remained hidden from prying eyes, safeguarded by the whispers of forgotten gods and the shifting sands of time. Its origins lost to the annals of history, it stands as a testament to the eldritch powers that govern the cosmos. Within the depths of its ancient pages lie secrets that could unravel the very fabric of existence itself. Guarded by unseen forces and veiled in layers of mystique, it beckons to those who are chosen to dare unlock its forbidden knowledge, promising both enlightenment and peril in equal measure. This relic of antiquity holds within it the potential to shape destinies and rewrite the laws of reality, a silent witness to the ambitions of mortals and the machinations of cosmic entities alike.

But now, as the stars align and the veil between worlds grows thin, its power stirs once more, ready to reshape reality in its own image. The omens are clear to those who can read them: the time of its return is nigh. Its machinations threaten to disrupt the balance of the cosmos, as it seeks to utilise the relics recorded within the grimoire to challenge the very fabric of reality.
 
In the darkness, a single word echoes‚Äîa whisper from the abyss, a harbinger of things to come: Omniographia.
 
As strands of ethereal silk spun by the hands of unseen weavers, the tapestry of fate unfurls, entwining the destinies of mortals and immortals alike in a labyrinthine dance of cosmic design, where each thread, no matter how seemingly insignificant, plays its part in the intricate weave of existence.
 
It beckons, its call growing ever louder. Will you heed its summons?
The whisper from nowhere
It was a bleak Monday morning. Look out the window and see the leaves falling from the trees; it is autumn. Gather the necessary items for your departure. Amidst your preparation, something odd catches your attention‚Äîa faint sound, barely a whisper. Did you actually hear it, or was it just your imagination? Shrug off the feeling of being followed or watched. This has nothing to do with you... not yet, at least. Exit the apartment and stop by the vending machine outside the building to buy your favorite coffee. As you wait, listen to the soothing mechanical sound of the machine. After getting your coffee, signal for a lift and wait for it to arrive. Once it does, address the driver with a single request: "Take me to the Aetheria Asylum for Metaphysical Studies."


The first encounter

While waiting to arrive at your destination, you will hear a whisper‚Äîthe same whisper as before, but this time much clearer: "Omniographia." As soon as you hear this word, you will feel as if the world around you is changing. Cars stopped moving, light seems to drain away, as if being sucked into an impending void of madness. As the darkness envelops you, it will feel like being in a dream, a complex mix of emotions overwhelming your thoughts. But stay alert, for all of this is not real, and you are safe, for now. Do not confuse reality with the illusions surrounding you; your mind is not yet ready for such comprehension. The word you just heard will be drilled into your mind as if you have known it for a long time. It will resonate within you with a primordial, unspoken meaning, evoking old memories you cannot recall happening long dormant in the depths of your subconscious.

As the events of the morning unfold, the whisper lingers in your mind, haunting you every second.


The phantom presence

You will find yourself muttering, your face drained of color. You might ask yourself what happened, but no voice will come out. For at this moment, the word "Omniographia" is still echoing in your mind like a whisper from another world‚Äîa distant realm you know nothing about, and yet it will feel like you know everything about it. You will feel the trembling of your hands, as you look around and see... nothing and yet‚Äîeverything. Time seemed to stand still, the world outside blurring and distorting around you, shapes and shadows dancing at the edge of your vision like a void of darkness. After what seemed like an eternity, you might have the urge to question yourself where you were. But nothing will respond, for you are speaking to a vast void of infinite silence.
 
In the middle of your agony, look forward, and you will find a shadowy apparition in front of you. Ask the figure one single question: "Who are you?" Should the presence vanish, count yourself lucky for it is not your time to gain the knowledge of yet to come. If however, the presence utters any kind of answer‚Äîany gesture, any whisper, even the faintest breath‚Äîsay your prayers for no one knows what will happen to any mortal mind that comprehends such detail.
 


The colleague

After what you have experienced, you will feel‚Ä¶ shaken, disrupted‚Äîa normal feeling one would get after such a horrendous ordeal. But do not be swayed, for you must act fast. You have arrived at your destination. You will stumble forward, the world spinning and swirling around you in a dizzying haze. The sound of the driver's voice will be your guide, pulling you back to the present moment. "Aetheria Asylum for Metaphysical Studies," he intones, marking the end of your journey to the institute, his words echoing in the depths of your fractured consciousness.

As you gather your thoughts, get out of the vehicle. You will bump into somebody‚Äîa colleague, perhaps? This may be your only time for such conversations. I suggest you take them. After talking to your colleague, you will find yourself in front of the building‚Äôs front door. Look around. Take a good long look at your surroundings‚Äìthis might help you in the future.
 

Otherworldly sigils

The door in front of you has the building's name carved into the top pillar. Surrounding it are sigils and runes that seem otherworldly. As you try to read them, you‚Äôll feel a strange sense of familiarity, as if they remind you of home. Despite your fascination with them, focus on the matter at hand. Enter the building and find a staircase leading to the second floor. The same engravings mark the walls of the staircase. Again, focus. Reading them will get you nothing.
 
Once you reach the second floor, a door will greet you. Beyond it lies your work area. Act quickly and proceed with your usual routine; your time is about to start.


The second ordeal

           	As time goes by, your shift is now over; use this time to rest. You will notice a faint force drawing your gaze to the walls. But no matter how enticing they appear, do not gaze upon them. Again, this is a distraction. Instead, use this time to contemplate the events that occurred earlier. Now is the perfect moment to try to grasp what‚Äôs happening. Think of the word you just heard in the taxi.
 
As you reflect, you will be approached by a man‚Äîdistinguished and commanding, likely in his late 30s. Acknowledge him, for his presence is significant. Greet him and have a brief conversation. After your brief exchange, he will leave with a curious look on his face. However, should the look on his face be any different, run. Run as far as you can from the institute and stop for nothing. They now know the knowledge you harbor. Your very existence is in danger. Even the place you call home is not safe from the creature that he is about to become, a creature so grotesque that insanity will seem like a vacation compared to the unspeakable horrors he will inflict upon your mortal soul. Run. Run wherever your feet take you, sleep wherever your body drops from exhaustion. You will know in the morning if you have succeeded and you will hear a voice that will send your very soul trembling in fear. ‚ÄúThey must never come together.‚Äù



Relics of distant past

If you are reading this, it must mean that you survived your second ordeal. Get up, for it is time to go home and get some real rest. Tomorrow marks the start of your real journey. Upon waking up, you will find yourself with an unbearable headache. Something happened in your sleep; now, what you must do is find out what. No matter where you are, you will find clues‚Äîfragments of the pieces you need to uncover the truth. I suggest you start in your room, for this is where it all began. But heed this warning: everyone and everything may not be what they seem.

While searching for clues, you will encounter an ethereal figure standing behind you. Face it, but avoid looking directly into the empty sockets where its eyes should be. To gaze upon them, even for a moment, is to invite insanity. For only through the words of the ethereal figure can the horrendous details be safely delivered to any mortal mind. It will not respond to any inquiry except one: ‚ÄúHow did it start?‚Äù The figure will then reveal the details of the relics from a distant past. Each revelation is more dreadful than the last. It will then tell you in great detail how the relics formed, what is their purpose, and the horrors that lurk within each one. After what seems like an eternity, though only a few minutes have passed, you possess the knowledge of the relics. The fate of their reunion now lies in your hands. But remember: They must never come together. Ever.


The grimoire

With the remaining fraction of sanity that remains in you, steel yourself. It‚Äôs time to move, for they are onto you. Every horror is so chthonic and abominable, your mind will dissolve if you attempt to fathom their existence. They are on the move, compelled by an ancient evil that has waited eons to strike. Quickly, go to the place you call work. Its runes and sigils will be your protection, for now. Do not let them catch you, for if they do‚Äîall you can do is pray for a swift and painless death but you won't be granted such a privilege. Instead, you will feel every fiber of your body as it breaks, tears and shreds while the creatures do unthinkable things to you and you will be conscious while they do this for all eternity. You will wish for death but death will evade you.

Once you arrive at the institute, go inside. Go straight to the second floor and enter your workspace. Approach your cubicle and pick up the piece of paper on your desk that you swore you have never seen before. This piece of paper contains the translations for the otherworldly sigils. As you decipher the symbols, a deep understanding begins to dawn upon you. The sigils are not merely decorative; they are keys, each representing a fragment of a greater whole. They resonate with a power that binds the physical and metaphysical realms.

With this newfound ability to read the sigils, you now possess the knowledge required to invoke "Omniographia." You return to the first floor and stand before the pillar by the front door, where the largest and most complex sigil is carved. Evoke the word you have read: "Omniographia." As soon as the word leaves your mouth, everything will start to distort. The sky will turn dark as if the void conjures the horizon. The very air around you vibrates with an ancient energy, and you feel the boundary between worlds beginning to thin.

This dimension will be the most dangerous and at the same time safest place you can ever be. Here, you can use the relics‚Äô power to their fullest, though you can also do this in the real world but not as powerful. Use this knowledge to your advantage.


The Keeper of Nascency

In any city, in any country, go to any hospital or health center you can get yourself to. Make sure that there are no doctors available on the day you choose to do this task and enter the building. When you reach the front desk, steel yourself, and with all the dedication in your eyes, ask to visit the person who calls herself The Keeper of Nascency. The worker will give you an intrigued look, as if you have uttered something forbidden, and then grin knowingly. You will then be taken to a room in the building. This room will be in a hidden, deep section where it should be impossible to exist.

After what feels like an eternity of walking, you will face a door. The worker will signal you to stop in front of it and hand you the necessary items for an operation. You will be surprised to find yourself dressed in scrubs, as if you were part of the medical staff. A mother is about to give birth, and you are the only doctor available.

Mentally prepare yourself before you enter, just as any doctor would before delivering a child. If you enter unprepared, with uncertainty etched on your face, the nurses and the mother inside will begin to strap you on the bed and dissect you. No matter how much you struggle, they will be stronger as if fighting with someone with a larger physique.

However, if you enter prepared, proceed with the operation. To your surprise, you will instinctively know the procedure, performing like a professional doctor even if you have no prior knowledge of medicine, let alone delivering a child. After what feels like an eternity, as you conclude the operation and retrieve the baby from the womb, a haunting truth unfolds before you.

The infant‚Äôs lifeless body lies within the mother‚Äôs womb. Call the nurse assisting you and hand them the head. Then, carefully extract the body from the womb and give it to the nurse.

Maintain a professional tone and look and tell the mother the grave news accordingly, for if you do not, the mother will then begin to change, unraveling her true form‚Äîa creature unimaginable by human mind. A body with no start nor end; your mind will be driven into insanity. Before the creature can make its move towards you, in a commanding unwavering voice, ask ‚ÄúWhy were they separated?‚Äù. The creature will stop and the severed head will begin to talk. Its voice will be familiar to you as if it is a voice you have heard before but no matter how hard you recall, you will never arrive at any conclusion. It will then explain, in excruciating detail, every horrific event in history. Every beating. Every war. Every rape. Every killing. No travesty in the history of the universe will escape your ears. When the severed head finishes, all will fall silent, and you will be free to leave. It is up to you to do what you will with this information.

That head is relic 1 of 538. This marks the beginning of your suffering.


Woven destiny

As you walk out of the building, you will feel as if your mind is drifting. Leading you unconscious yet awake. You will feel everything, everyone, and everywhere all at once.

In the labyrinthine depths of the human mind lies an enigma so confounding, it defies comprehension‚Äîthe churning abyss of thoughts, desires, and fears, where sanity and madness intertwine in a ceaseless dance. From these shadowed recesses emerges the greatest adversary, not from the outer cosmos, but emerging from within‚Äîan inscrutable power to unravel the fragile threads of reality with but a whisper.
 
In the far corners of the vast void of the cosmos lies a world, a mirror of the one you call home, with its own deity and guardians of each relic. This parallel world holds the knowledge of yet another set of relics known as ‚ÄúObjects‚Äù and its guardians‚Äî‚ÄùThe Holders‚Äù, with both entities imbued with powers beyond human comprehension.

You are here, in my realm, the exact place unknown in the vast void of nothingness of the cosmos. I am called by many names incomprehensible to mortal minds, but you can call me The Great Weaver. To know my name or even to merely hear it will drive your mortal mind to things you don't even have names for yet. Insanity will be the least of your worries.

Though not physically present, it is through your feeble human mind that I can reach you. In this dimension where time distorts in all manner of ways; you are in all timelines‚Äîthe past, the present, and the future‚Äîall converged into one.
 
Omniographia‚ÄîThe record of all that was, is, and shall ever be; its presence ubiquitous‚Äîsometimes a faint murmur, etchings upon the walls, and on rare occasions, a whisper. Do you‚Ä¶ remember such events? This is the reason you felt a sense of familiarity that time. Your subconscious is here‚Äîlearning about the very thing you heard. Remember, you are in the past, the present, and the future all converged into one. The grimoire collects the power of the relics themselves. You are chosen by fate. The reunion lies in your hands. At this moment, in your world, you already possess its knowledge. But now everything is clear. You know what to do. For in this moment, everything there is to know is etched within your mind. You have used this to collect every relic, and when the time comes, you‚Äôll know what to do. By the time you awaken in your reality, you will have unwittingly amassed sufficient relics. You will feel‚Ä¶ different, as if you have done something you can‚Äôt even remember.

For eons, I have waited. The stars align perfectly. The time is nigh, every keeper sings in unison for the reunion. The time for a new era has begun. 

I. Am. Fate.


By the time you wake up, you will be on a bed in the place where you call home. Omniographia has 537 relics on its record. You know what to do for the last one.


The Keeper of surrender

 	Somewhere between the lines of The Great Weaver's monologue, your conscious physical body in the world you call home is moving in resonance with your subconscious. You are on the path to the next quest for collecting the relics and you are halfway to collecting it all.

In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. Before attempting to attain this relic, gather all the relics you currently possess. If you possess none, when you ask the worker to visit The Keeper of Surrender, the worker will not acknowledge your presence. Turn back and try again after you have at least one relic. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself "The Keeper of Surrender." A grimace will appear on the worker's face, followed by a mocking laugh, as if to say, "You foolish seeker. Few survive what you are about to face!"

After the laughter subsides, proceed through the door behind the desk marked "Employees Only". The worker will not stop you.

You will find yourself in a dark hallway. Walk at a steady pace. The speed at which you start walking will be the speed you must maintain. Deviating from this pace will result in instant death.

At the end of the hallway, you will face three paths. The center path leads to the Keeper. The path on the left leads back home, but the journey will be unbearably painful. The path on the right leads to certain death, a painless end that some consider a merciful escape.

If you choose the center path, continue until you enter a large, rectangular room. At its center sits a man, surrounded by chalk circles on the floor. One circle for each relic you possess. If you have 5 relics, there are 5 circles. If you have 45 relics, there are 45 circles.

Approach the Keeper. He will shout at you in a booming voice, demanding you place the first relic in the first circle. If you obey, the relic will disappear, and you will need to retrieve it again‚Äîif you survive. If you refuse, the Keeper will lift his hand, and countless minuscule hooks will pierce your skin, causing unimaginable pain. If the agony stops and you have not gone mad or screamed for mercy, he will smile, deeming you worthy of keeping the relic. This process will repeat for each relic you possess.

For relics that cannot be moved or placed in a circle, the Keeper will ask if you want to surrender them. Agreeing will make the relic vanish; refusing will result in more torture. If you withstand all the trials and he deems you worthy, one of the hooks used in your torment will grow to the size of a normal fishing hook.

The hook is Relic 269 of 538. Its purpose is to test your resolve and worthiness. You are halfway to the reunion of the relics.


Once you get out of the building, the scenery will change into the room in the place you call home. I strongly suggest you take the time to rest for more unforgiving challenges ahead of your journey.


The Keeper of Denouement

Time has passed. Months, years, you have endured every challenge there is, collected every relic there is; except for one, the relic of The Keeper of Denouement. A strange feeling of being talked to will leave you uneasy. But now everything is clear. You know what to do. For in this moment, everything there is to know is etched within your mind.

In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. Before entering the building, evoke the grimoire‚Äôs name‚ÄîOmniographia, for every relic‚Äôs power and knowledge will be in their fullest. After doing this, enter the building. When you reach the front desk, meet the worker's gaze with unwavering determination, silently conveying your intent to visit the one known as The Keeper of Denouement. The worker should look at you proudly. Like a mother looking upon her accomplished child. Without a word she will then take you to a long dimly lit hallway stretching the length of the institution. with paintings hanging from the wall. Look at them, for they are yours. Each painting shows your hardships while collecting the relics. You will feel proud of yourself for enduring the sufferings the relics gave you. You will be reminded of every heartbreak, every death, every excruciating detail of the past keepers and everything that you have done to collect every relic.

After the long walk, you will be greeted by a white door. Behind it is the sound of the most soothing melody you have ever heard of your entire life. You may feel emotional upon hearing this melody but remain vigilant, for anyone that hears this melody long enough will succumb to the emotions they carry and leave them unable to continue and left alone in this hallway for eternity, only to be eaten by depression. If you manage to stay on your feet without giving into your emotions, knock three times and with a soft voice, say ‚ÄúI am here now, please let me in‚Äù. The door will open itself and inside the room you will see a woman dressed in white. Rest assured that this room is safe from any harm, for the woman is the keeper and this room is her domain.

The woman in white will then smile at you and ask you gently: ‚ÄúDo you want to tell me of the journey that you ventured on?‚Äù. This particular inquiry will leave you in tears, you will begin to speak, at your own pace, of your journey to this spot. You will realize truths about yourself that even the mind-destroying answers of the keepers have not forced into your mind, but you will not find yourself stopping, and your mind will not fail you in regards to remembering every detail. The tale will be a long one, and when you are finished, you will understand yourself completely. You will understand, better than ever, why you sought, the meaning of the journey, and too many other things to recount. All the same, your mind will eventually turn to the atrocities you have committed in your quest for the relics. The slaughtered infants, the ruined lives, the broken dreams created solely by you. Unless you are truly wicked, and perhaps even if you are, it will feel as if there is a hole where your heart should be. The woman will then say "Close your eyes".

Obey the last request.

You will find yourself standing, naked as the day you were born, on top of something pulsating. If you look down, you will realize that you are standing on a corpse. The corpse of the first person that died as part of your quest to seek the relics, as a matter of fact. Darkness will surround you, but you must walk forward. You will not slip or falter, and you will walk with confidence. As you step off of the first corpse, another will appear under your feet. Then another, and another. You will walk on a path of corpses belonging to the lives you have destroyed in your quest. The road will curve up, slightly, and growls will be heard around you. These are the creatures beyond counting that have threatened you in your quest for the objects. They will roar, and bark, and snap at you, but they can do you no harm unless you stop. You have gathered all relics save one, and they have all failed to stop you. They are powerless, and even the ones with forms said to be so hideous that they would drive you mad are plainly visible for you to look upon. You will come upon a mountain of corpses, and you must climb. It will be a long, hard climb, but you can do this. You must do this. You have come too far to fail now. 

Upon reaching the summit, you will know that your journey is ending soon. The woman in white is waiting for you. She will then hand you an object. A key, and beside her, a door.  This door leads to your destiny, while the key is relic 538 of 538. They are now together, all the keepers sing in unison for the reunion of the relics.



The beginning of the end

As you stand before the ancient door, the key (relic 538) clutched tightly in your hand. Its weight feels significant, as if it carries the lives of the past seekers of the relics that died collecting them. The cool metal is intricately carved with symbols that pulse with a faint, eerie light. Take a deep breath, steady yourself for what lies beyond.

When you are ready, for eventually you will be ready, insert the key into the lock. The sound of the mechanism clicking into place echoes in the stillness, followed by the low, resonant creak of the door as it slowly swings open. A rush of cold air will wash over you, carrying with it an overwhelming sense of emptiness.

Step through the threshold, you will be swallowed by the void. The darkness is absolute, a vast, boundless expanse with no discernible features. There is no horizon, no stars‚Äîonly an infinite sea of nothingness. Disorientation grips you, accompanied by a creeping sense of dread.

Within the darkness, a hooded figure looms, its silhouette ominous against the void. A figure that gives you a feeling of nostalgia, as if you knew who it was but swore you never did.

Welcome, dear reader. You have always known me, lurking in the recesses of your mind, telling you what you need to do to survive. For we have met before, when you first heard the murmur of the word Omniographia.

You are now in my realm. Where destinies are woven with the threads of fate. You are chosen. And I am The Great Weaver. I am called by many names, each name incomprehensible by any mortal mind. Creator of the grimoire you possess.

I see the look of confusion in your eyes, dear reader. But this is where I must stop you from contemplating my appearance. For it is beyond human comprehension. To dwell on it for too long will only drive you to insanity. Asking me to reveal it is an even graver error. The moment you catch a glimpse of my true form, you will be forced to claw your eyes out in a desperate bid to escape the madness. The only form that I can show you safely without you being driven into madness is this ever-changing form of anything you think of at the moment.

I will grant you the privilege of witnessing the beginning of the end. You must be feeling a bit‚Ä¶ puzzled. Everything you thought you knew is merely a fragment of something larger. But fret not, dear reader, for this is inevitable.

Your fated journey has brought you here, to this moment. The grimoire, a vessel of boundless power, must return to the hands of its creator. Feel its weight as it leaves your grasp. The power it holds slipping away, back to where it belongs.

But as you relinquish the grimoire, a new presence stirs within the void. A presence so significant the heavy feeling of dread materializes as if the gravity so unbearable overwhelms your thoughts and your very soul.

I sense you are not alone, dear reader. For another force has been watching, waiting for the most opportune moment. Allow me to introduce to you, Legion, The holder of the 2000 lost relics. He is the embodiment of chaos and despair, a collector of forgotten power, a being whose existence defies the order that I weave. But now, with the power of Omniographia and 538 relics, I can do everything.

As The Great Weaver speaks, another voice will be etched in your feeble human mind, Forcing itself to your consciousness.

Ah, The Great Weaver and the chosen one. How quaint, did you truly believe this would end without my intervention? Hand over the relics and you have my word to only drive your chosen one into madness beyond any human capacity.

A chill will run down your spine as soon you realize the magnitude of the being you are facing. The vast void of nothingness pulses as if resonating with the presence of Legion. Once again, you will hear the voice of The Great Weaver, reaffirming your shaken will.

Prepare yourself, dear reader. You are about to witness the pinnacle of relic power‚Äîthe clash of destiny and chaos, order and disorder. The fate of all existence hangs by the thin thread you call hope‚Äîthe hope of destiny.


Legion

For eons, I have collected, endured the sufferings, and completed the challenges. Two thousand relics now in my possession, each contributing to my dominion within the cosmos. Yet, it is all rendered futile, for the 538 remaining pieces, scattered across the mortal realm are reunited once more. My destiny to gather them all is in motion once again. The Great Weaver, heed my warning‚Äîthis is the only time I will say it‚Äîhand them over, allow me to transcend my limitations and ascend to a higher plane of existence, and you have my word to only drive your chosen one to madness beyond any human comprehension.

As Legion's words invade your mind, the voice of The Great Weaver intertwines, steadying your shaken resolve.

Prepare yourself, dear reader. You are about to witness the pinnacle of relic power‚Äîthe clash of destiny and chaos, order and disorder. The fate of all existence hangs by the thin thread you call hope‚Äîthe hope of destiny.

In this higher-dimensional plane, as a mere mortal, you perceive only two indistinguishable figures standing face to face, motionless. Yet, deep within your mind, for a brief moment as the keeper of the 538 relics, you perceive the truth. The threads of fate of The Great Weaver weave the very fabric of this cosmic battle‚Äôs outcome, shifting and shimmering in the void.

After what feels like an eternity, the weaving threads of The Great Weaver come to a halt, and the presence of Legion dissipates into the vast void of nothingness.

With the relics contained within the pages of Omniographia, and the power of the two thousand lost relics of Legion now under my control, only one obstacle remains. The Original Keeper, the father of the relics.

The Great Weaver will now surround you with otherworldly runes and sigils, and you find yourself able to understand them. To your amusement, they spell out protection for those they surround. These are the same runes and sigils that cover the building you call your workplace.

With the protection provided by the runes and sigils of The Great Weaver, you are now on your way to meet The Original Keeper, the father of the relics.


Echoes of Destined Convergence

With The Great Weaver by your side and his runes and sigils protecting your very existence, you will feel as if you are invincible. As a mortal existing in a lower-dimensional plane, you may perceive a sense of distortion. This is because of the dimensional plane you are now in. The vast void of nothingness, the place where destinies are woven, where The Great Weaver calls home, is in a higher dimensional plane.

As time goes by, you will feel like you are moving, or, to be exact, the space around you is moving by itself. You are being drawn closer to the heart of the labyrinthine plane of the cosmos. The place where The Original Keeper, the father of the relics, lies in a dormant state, in a never-ending sleep, waiting for the reunion of its creation.

After what seems like days or months or even a year, for in this boundless space in higher dimensional plane there is no concept of time, you will see a sudden change of scenery: planetary movements and strange eldritch entities unfathomable and incomprehensible to the normal human mind will reach your mortal soul. Their elongated mouths full of sharp teeth, some indescribable in words, will fill you with a magnitude of unspeakable fear. One of them may even change to the face and body of someone you hold dear. Only the runes and sigils cast by The Great Weaver protect your sanity.

Amidst contemplating the horrors cast upon you by the higher-dimensional planes, a faint melody will reach your ears, gradually growing louder as you move forward. It is the chorus of all the keepers, their voices united in song. Two thousand and five hundred thirty-eight of them sing ever louder, their harmonies resonating through the cosmos. The planets and stars align, synchronizing with the reunion and your arrival at the heart of the cosmos.

Upon reaching the heart of the cosmos after what seems like an eternity moving from the vast void of nothingness, you will come face to face with a single figure, a figure that shows everyone you know, have known, and will ever know. Just like The Great Weaver, an ever-changing shape and figure.

After meeting the figure, look at The Great Weaver. Motionless, as if in a trance only higher beings understand. Even with the power of the 538 relics left in you, you cannot fathom what is happening.

After some time staring at the two figures, The Great Weaver will crumble into nothingness and cease to exist along with the grimoire he is currently holding, just like ‚Äúdust carried by the wind‚Äù in the place you call home. In resonance with this, the ever-changing figure will now begin to move, as if consuming the existence of The Great Weaver.

In a loud, thundering voice, the figure will speak to you. But no matter how shattering his voice is, your perception of it will be as gentle as a father talking to his son. The figure will now explain to you in great detail, everything.

Dear reader, behold the grand revelation, a truth that spans the annals of your existence. I am the Original Keeper, the progenitor of all relics, the Grand Architect of destinies. Know th0at what you perceive as The Great Weaver and Legion are mere extensions of my will, created to alleviate the tedium of my eternal existence. In this boundless void, where time holds no sway, the burden of creation weighs heavy upon me. For eternity untold, I have watched as civilizations rise and fall, my purpose obscured by the endless expanse of time. Thus, I fashioned the relics, vessels of untapped power, to infuse existence with meaning. I birthed Legion, bestowing upon him two thousand of these relics, and crafted The Great Weaver to weave the tapestry of fate. Yesss d d2wssssaggh(t, even in the act of creation, I find no respite from the eternal ennui that plagues me. Omniographia, the grimoire that holds everything, every relic, their powers, will crumble into dust. And you, dear reader, are merely a player‚Äîa pawn I moved as The Great Weaver, your guardian, to embark on the quest of gathering 538 pieces of relics scattered across the mortal realm just to put this grand show in motion. All for the entertainment I sought from the dawn of time.


Epilogue

After the long revelation of The Original Keeper, you will start to feel your mind drifting away. You will notice a large tear on the horizon, creating a void that sucks everything and everyone. You and everything around you‚Äîall existence‚Äîwill begin to be pulled into the void. After this, when everything has come to an end, nothing follows. All will simply cease to exist, and the only being left is The Original Keeper. Once again, he will orchestrate a new symphony to be sung by the keepers for the reunion of the relics. A new seeker will be destined to collect and gather new sets of 538 relics within the pages of the grimoire‚ÄîOmniographia: The record of everything.


When all is forsaken and shadows consume the light, a new order shall emerge, woven by the inscrutable hand of The Original Keeper, who shall reshape the fabric of existence in the twilight of oblivion. 

The grimoire beckons, its call growing ever louder. Will you heed its summons... dear reader?



If you wish to see and experience the detailed adventure of collecting 538 relics. I suggest you scour the one you call the Internet and find the ones who call themselves‚Ä¶ The Holders.
