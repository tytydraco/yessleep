last week I went out with my best friend Skye with the plans of going to have a few drinks and going to a concert. were both students studying different subjects at different colleges so we don't see each other as often as we used to and usually when we do it is to go to a concert. we are both in the alternative scene and like supporting local bands, so when we saw an Instagram advert for a local band called Redacted (an eerily ironic name in hindsight), we decided to make it a plan. both myself and skye had never heard of this band, and there wasn't much to go off of online, which isn't weird as usually, the small shows we go to, the bands are relatively unknown and have little online presence, but we didn't care as it was a good excuse to go out and the entry fee was only £10. I'm writing this now as this was the last time I saw Skye. He has been missing since, and no one can find him; today, I received an email from him.

I'll give you a quick rundown of everything that happened up until I last saw him to give you some context Last Wednesday rolled around, and I had a class in the morning, so I got up, went to class and then went home and started to get ready before Skye came by, and we got an uber into the city. we went to a local bar that had their student night on for a few cheap drinks, and then i got my phone out to Google Maps the venue. it was in an old warehouse a 15 min walk from the bar which wasn't weird at the time but when we got there the unsettling feeling started to set in. I could tell Skye was picking up the same vibes when he turned to me and said "Do you think we should just call it a night this place looks dead" I thought about what he said for a few seconds and looked around, but I saw another group of people at the entrance pay their fee and go in. "nah we should check it out we are out anyway". we paid the entrance fee and went in and it surprisingly was nice inside. not like most warehouse shows it had a little bar set up with some stools and a decent sound system set up with a small but sturdy stage. 

The lighting was dull, but the turnout was decent about 40 or so people mostly groups and couples chatting, and there was music playing before the band came on. We waited a bit impatiently for redacted to come on for what felt like hours as we talked drunk incoherent nonsense with the people around us. The group beside us were really friendly and like us had seen a flyer for the concert on a notice board in a bar. 

When redacted came on I put in my earplugs as im pretty sound sensitive and get bad tinnitus if I do some people think it's pointless to go to a concert with earplugs, but to that, I say fuck you I want to be able to listen to music than go deaf after one show. Skye laughed at me when I put them in because in his words “ your such an only woman when you do this shit you remind me of my mum” We both laughed. The band or rather a two-man project came on. Both said nothing just waved and set up their mics and guitars. Everyone cheered. 

Then it started. I say it because I don't even know how to describe the noise. If I were to call the agonising screams and the screech of the guitars a noise project, I would be severely downplaying it. The guitar was making a really high frequency a noise I didn't think could come out of a guitar or an amp, and it had a really awful reverb. The vocals if you could call them vocals consisted of violently screaming the words fear and power over and over. The type of scream you hear in those true crime shows where the victim is using every last breath grasping at the chance of being helped. It was physically painful, and I grabbed Skye's arm and signalled to leave. But he shrugged me off. The noise stopped with the vocalist saying “follow” before rushing off stage. I let go of my head and wiped the tears that had started streaming from my eyes. And I grabbed Skye and left. 



We got outside and said to Skye “that was AWFUL that has to be the worst gig we have been to” to which Skye replied “Right it wasn't that bad” I asked if we had been in the same room just there and laughed and Skye laughed too. Now looking back on it the laugh unsettles me it was weak and dismissive like he was just trying to change the conversation. We phoned an Uber and headed back to mine as it was getting late, and I had a class in the morning. Skye got picked up from mine as the Uber would have been too much to get to his place and we had spent a bit more than we planned to. 

I chugged a glass of vitamin water to help with the head when I woke up and went to sleep. As per usual I slept in for my class and woke up in a rush to get up and get the train into college not having time to message Skye to see how he was, I got to class where I was met with an unpleased lecturer and a list of notes to take for my context art history class and the day dragged one of my classmates asked about my night.  I told her that it wasn't great and tried to pull up the Instagram account to show her photos assuming the band would have uploaded photos and videos to their empty account, but the account was gone. It was odd, but I thought I mistyped the username or something so I messaged Skye to ask for it, but he wasn't awake. We both just kinda left the conversation at that. I finished my notes, and it was time to head home. 

I got home, and Skye hadn't got back to my text i shrugged it off thinking he was hungover and probably still not out of his bed as usual. I made something to eat took my dog out for a walk and watched some South Park. That's when my phone rang. It was Skye's dad. “Hey is Skye there?” “uhh no sorry I've not seen him since he got picked up last night” “Picked up last night he messaged me saying he was staying at yours last night … who picked him up?” he said sounding alarmed.” James? I didn't really ask he said that he was getting a lift so I just assumed it was you or James” I said starting to worry a little myself. James is Skye's boyfriend they have been seeing each other for around 3 years now, usually when he gets picked up from my house it's James or Skye's dad, and this is why I didn't think to question it. Sykes dad replied sounding a little relieved as if he had almost forgotten about James completely in a state of panic “Oh okay he probably just stayed over last night, but I'll give James a call, thanks” “No problem ill message as well his phone might have died or something I'm sure he is fine” followed by “keep me updated” and hung up. 

I called James and when we knew that something was wrong. He also hadn't heard from Skye, and that's when we all panicked and phoned the police. 

It's been a week everyone has been searching non-stop for Skye and whoever picked him up and so far … nothing. Nothing except the email I received this morning from Skye's Gmail account. No subject and no context just a bunch of numbers which after a while I realised were coordinates, coordinates that were for the warehouse the concert was at. 

I told skyes boyfriend James, and he's gonna pick me up so we can go check it out in about an hour i will try to keep you all updated and let you know if we find him when we get back,
