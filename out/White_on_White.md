I've learned to tell people I photograph wildlife because it's easier than explaining I photograph absence. It's easier than explaining why I left Seattle, why I sold almost everything I owned to rent a cabin in this remote mountain town where cell service is as rare as summer sunshine.

Mrs. Winters, the elderly woman who owns the general store, calls this place Echo Ridge. "Though there aren't many pines left," she told me when I arrived three days ago, her rheumy eyes fixed on something beyond my shoulder. "Just the white birch now.”

I didn't ask what she meant. I've gotten good at not asking questions.

The cabin sits at the edge of town, if you can call five streets and a handful of weather-beaten buildings a town. My closest neighbor is half a mile away, and the forest starts right at my back door. Perfect. The silence here is thick like fresh snow, broken only by the occasional cry of a raven.

Today marks my first real attempt at photography since I arrived. The winter afternoon light is already fading, but I've spotted promising tracks in the snow – small, delicate prints that could belong to a fox. I follow them with my camera ready.

The tracks lead me deeper into the birch forest. White bark peels from the trees like curls of paper. I should turn back. I know this.

That's when I see it.

Through my viewfinder, at first – a flash of white against white. I lower my camera, and there it stands, thirty feet away: a fox with fur as pale as moonlight. But wrong. All wrong. It's too large, its proportions slightly off in ways my mind can't quite process. And its eyes...

I raise my camera again, hands shaking. Through the lens, I see what I couldn't with my naked eye: the fox has too many tails. They spread behind it like a fan of smoke, translucent in the dying light. I count one, two, three...

The shutter clicks.

The sound echoes through the silent forest like a gunshot, and the fox – if that's what it is – turns its head to look directly into my lens. Its eyes are the color of old coins, and they hold something that makes my breath catch in my throat. Recognition. It knows me.

"Alice," it says, in a voice like wind through dead leaves.

I drop my camera. It lands in the snow with a muffled thud, but I barely notice. Because the fox spoke my name. My full name, which I haven't given to anyone in town.

When I look up again, it's gone. But in the snow where it stood, I find a single white feather, impossibly warm to the touch.

I run back to my cabin, leaving my camera behind. The sun has set completely now, and the moon is rising – full and white as a fox's eye. Inside, I lock every door, every window. I tell myself I imagined it. The isolation, the grief, the guilt – they're playing tricks on my mind. They have to be.

But when I finally work up the courage to look in the mirror, I understand why the fox's gaze held recognition. My eyes, which have been dark brown all my life, now shine with a metallic gleam in the bathroom's fluorescent light.

I blink, and they're normal again. Brown. Human. But I know what I saw.

Later that night, Mrs. Winters calls. I haven't given her my number. I haven't given anyone my number.

"Did you see it?" she asks without preamble. Her voice crackles with static.

"See what?"

"Don't play dumb, girl. The White Fox chose you. Just like it chose your grandmother."

My grandmother died in this town sixty years ago. I never met her. More importantly, I never told anyone here about her.

"How did you—"

"Come to the store tomorrow," Mrs. Winters interrupts. "There are things you need to know. Things about your grandmother. About what happens to women in your family during the winter moons."

She hangs up before I can respond.

I sit in the dark for a long time after that, listening to the wind. It sounds different now, more like words just beyond my understanding. When I finally go to bed, I dream of running through snow on four legs, my multiple tails streaming behind me like banners of smoke.

I wake to find white fur on my pillow, and my camera sitting on the kitchen table – cleaned of snow, lens cap carefully in place. Next to it lies the warm white feather, and beneath both items, a note written in elegant, unfamiliar script:

"The change has begun. "
