I don’t know if anyone will end up reading this. Fuck I don't even know if there's anyone left outside this damn building. The last time I looked out the window everything was dark, but not in the usual way one would expect the early hours of the morning to be. It was oppressive…. It was unnatural. No matter how much I strained my eyes and begged a god, that would shun me as a heretic, for mercy there was no denying the abyss that pressed against the windowpane. It was as if I was floating in the deepest reaches of a space devoid of stars and here I stood, nothing but a vacuous pit of questions.

Completely and utterly alone. 

I'm writing this solely because I don’t know what else to do. I’m Hoping someone is still out there, no… needing there to be someone out there to tell me this is some kind of fucked up joke or that maybe I’m in the midst of some kind of breakdown. Anything to help me understand. 


Let me explain from the beginning, maybe recounting the last two days will help me get a better grasp on the reality I'm facing.  The funny thing is, it started exactly the same as every other day. Same monotonous routine; wake up at 5:10 each morning, adorn my high vis and steel toe boots, catch the 6:10 train only to find myself at the locked gates of my place of work not even forty minutes after rolling out of bed.

Same route, same times and even the same faces passed me by on my commute. It had been dark out, a little cold and a little damp but everything was… normal… 

I was the first to arrive at work most days which granted me access to a set of the building's keys shortly after my employment. So it wasn't unusual to be the only one squinting under the dim flicker of an overhead lamp post with the cold biting at my fingertips, as I struggled to pry the stubborn metal of the gates open as quickly as possible in hopes of finding reprieve from the winter air. I didn't even have an inkling anything was wrong until a good thirty minutes after I had arrived. 

I work in a fairly small warehouse for an independent enterprise in a small non descript town. Just your average location for any average joe. The building has a small office space above the warehouse and the day to day workload was never that intense. In fact most days were a slow slog to 3:30, but the small team of people I grew to know helped the time pass. 

Normally within ten to twenty minutes of my arrival other members of staff would start to trickle in, accompanied by the general groan of sleepiness and resentment for being stuck in what was essentially a fucking ice box all day instead of wrapped up in bed with a warm cup of coffee. 

The one shitty heater the company provided us smelt as though it was ready to catch fire at any moment and yet we would all huddle round it desperately whenever we got the chance. So even the temperature hadn't seemed strange at the time. I can feel it now though… how it's slowly creeping under my skin and nesting in my bones. 

I’m concerned about how much colder it’s going to get the longer I’m trapped here. 

After I had deactivated the alarm and made my first cup of coffee for the day I made my way toward the door, the large windows overseeing the warehouse loomed in my peripheral, which always did a great job at freaking me the fuck out. You see, the lights for the warehouse itself are automated and will only come on when it senses movement, so whenever I make my way toward the door in the mornings I refuse to look through those damn windows. Call it an overactive imagination or watching too many horror films in my spare time but I didn't like looking into a pit of darkness especially when no one else was in the building.  An irrational part of my mind would always supply that someone could be watching me on the other side of the glass. Stupid right? Now I kind of wish there was. I haven't seen a single soul in 42 hours which is fucking insane. 

This whole situation is making me feel insane. 

I remember the confusion that I had felt when no one had shown up after I had assumed a good thirty minutes had passed. I had glanced around the space for a while, pacing around the staff room and warehouse office wondering if I could see any signs of a new arrival and when I had finally begun to drive myself a little crazy doing so I fished my phone from my pocket and stared down in a detached kind of shock when my phone flashed the numbers 6:30am back at me. The time I had first arrived at work. There was no way. I had been here for at least twenty to thirty minutes. So the time staring back at me must have been wrong. Now as much as this had sent a tiny shiver of unease through my spine It wasn't unexplainable and so I didn't ponder on it much, still too perplexed as to why no one else was here yet. 

It wasn't a bank holiday, it was the middle of the week and there was no indication as to why no one else had shown up. Perhaps there had been an accident and people were stuck in traffic?. 

So I waited for roughly another thirty minutes. Idly staring at my phone screen in mild fascination. Time unchanging. It was at this point I really started to feel antsy, fingers dancing along the sides of my phone, unable to refrain from fidgeting where I sat. Maybe I should just leave? No one was answering their phones and the longer I sat there, the more on edge I had become. I felt silly for feeling so spooked at the time, telling myself that if anything it was a day off from work and that I had probably missed an email about the place being shut for the day. 

The low melody of changes by Black Sabbath danced in the otherwise still space between the walls of this place, offering a small salvation from the eerie feeling that accompanied me as I logged into my work email on the laptop at my makeshift desk, that sat in the corner of the warehouse. The red laser of the scanner hummed quietly as it projected its dim light across the white walls opposite the computer. 

There had been no email. The calls I had tried to make had gone from ringing out to not going through at all from my end. It was as if the entire place became a deadzone. No signal and no wifi connection. 

The open space that sat oppressively against my back felt almost suffocating the longer I swivelled nervously in the desk chair. Fuck this right? Something didn't feel right and the longer I stewed in that feeling the heavier it got. So with a shaky exhale I pushed myself back abruptly from the laptop and gathered my bag and headphones from under the desk. If no one was coming then what was I doing here?  I knew the address of my work friend Natalie, I could swing by and see what was going on at a more reasonable hour of the day. There must have been some kind of announcement I missed and whilst everyone else was at home I was here like a complete fucking idiot waiting around. 

There was still a part of me that hesitated at the prospect of leaving. What if I got in trouble? What if after I leave people do start to show up and then I'm the one that gets questioned about my impromptu absence? 

Well it turns out that none of that mattered because when my eyes landed on the glass door of the entrance all I could see was a thick blanket of obsidian. I stood there for a good few minutes wondering if this was all just a stupidly vivid dream and I was about to wake up drenched in sweat. Nothing felt grounded in the realms of reality anymore. There was no light from the dim lamp post outside, nor the car I had walked past to get into the building. I couldn't even see the fucking pavement! 

There was something niggling at the back of my mind, telling me not to open that door. But that wasn't rational, none of this was. All I wanted to do was go home. Go back to a place where things felt normal. 

So against my better judgement I strode forward, hand reaching out and curling round the handle, a buzz of anticipation thrumming under my clammy palm. I yanked once, twice and then erratically until it left me breathless. 

The door wouldn't budge and the longer I stood opposite the cavernous pit of absence, gazing into the darkness the more concerned I grew that something was staring back.  Repressing a shudder I took a few steps back, breath rattling in my chest, the thump of primal fear cracking against my ribcage rhythmically. 

I was at a loss. And when my brain couldn't land on any reasonable conclusion I made the decision to run up the stairs and look through a window in the office. Perhaps someone had put a black sheet over the doorframe, maybe someone was in the building with me. Either to fuck with me for some stupid joke or maybe more sinister purposes. I didn't know. But if that was the case then I would be able to see the car park from one of the upstairs windows. 

I honestly can't put into words the feeling I got when I was met with the same sight. I remember going extremely cold, yet despite that a fevered sweat perspirated my upper brow. My heart sinking like stone into my gut. 

In a rushed panic I had fled back down the stairs, a frenzy unlike I had ever known overtaking my movements and I pulled hard on the glass door again. I even thought about trying to smash the window pane in my desperation to get out of whatever situation I had found myself in but a small and more rational part of my brain whispered soft reassurances. That I was overacting and would most definitely get sacked if I broke company property on purpose with no real justifiable excuse  other than that I was scared? Yeah…  no. 

Forcing myself to take a steadying breath I evaluated my options. This situation was weird and I was potentially in danger. The most logically explanation is that someone is fucking with me right? And potentially in a very malicious way. So upon second thought smashing the door open was not a bad idea… it would alert whoever was here to where I was but that wouldn't matter if I was quick enough. Ultimately this job wasn't worth my life. Never before had I changed my mind so quickly. 


As you can probably guess… it didn't work… 

The glass refused to shatter, the upstairs office space was locked when I made a dash up there to hide. Worry pulling taut at my muscles at the prospect of someone hearing my failed attempts at escape. I huddled by that door for a while. Chest heaving painfully the entire time. 

Fast forward a lot of painful time spent staring at the top of the stairs, waiting for someone brandishing a knife or something akin to one to slowly encroach upon my safety. It never did happen. 

Most of the first day was spent inspecting all of the windows and exits to the building and after much internal encouragement I found myself back in the vast and mostly empty space, bar the racking, of the warehouse. I had frantically and repeatedly pushed the button to the shutter in hope of it opening it in another fruitless attempt at escape. 

 
I'm lucky that I have access to food and water. 


This was a thought that rattled around my brain as more and more hours passed me by. It turned out that the only clock in this whole place that didn't stop at 6:30 this morning is the one on the laptop i'm using to write this on. The first day of being stuck here was coming to an end and I was still no closer to understanding what was going on. 

When the weight of sleep began to pull at my eyelids a good many hours after my arrival. I was reluctant to succumb to the feeling. On edge and paranoid about my safety had me sat upright, rigid in my chair. 

I knew that I would have to sleep eventually but the thought of being in such a vulnerable state sent a painfully sharp sensation of anxiety through my veins. 

Little did I know that when the dredges of sleep finally took me, I would be waking up to a new nightmare entirely.  


It was a sound that woke me. 

The speaker I had used to keep me feeling somewhat sane must have died when I was asleep and instead of waking to the comforting lull of music I instead awoke in a blanket of darkness and a harrowing silence. I was still for a moment, head buried amongst my folded arms.  Pupils rolling in their sockets as I struggled to pull myself from the tendrils of sleep that beckoned me to stay. The first thing I noticed was how my hands ached, fingers stiff and curled inwards almost as if the moisture from my body had been sucked dry, leaving me nothing more than a shrivelled flesh sack. In an attempt to get the blood flowing into my extremities I tried to pry myself from the desk. But to my growing concern, I was unable to. It felt like there was a pressure on my neck, pushing down on the bone and pinning me there. The tiny hairs that littered my skin rising to meet a gentle exhale that danced across my flesh momentarily. It was soft, but deliberate. Almost as if someone had been standing over me. As the thought entered my sleep-addled mind my muscles seized. I bolted upright in my seat, joints popping and grinding at the sudden movement that I forced upon them. My head cracked to the side, gaze sliding across the space behind me and when my eyes landed on nothing more than emptiness my shoulders sagged at the notion that there was nothing there. 

I must have sat ramrod straight in my chair  for at least five minutes before the adrenaline began to seep from my pours, leaving me a boneless heap. With a clearer head I could reason that what I had just experienced was probably just an unfortunately timed bout of sleep paralysis. I sighed at the thought, clenching and uncleanching my fingers in an attempt to get ahold of my frayed nerves. I had experienced sleep paralysis far too regularly as a child and was unfortunately no stranger to it. Didn't make it any less stressful, especially under the circumstances I find myself currently in. There was only a slight reprieve until something new caught my attention.

I didn't register it at first. The gentle tap… tap… tapping echoing quietly from one of the aisles somewhere to the left of me. Instead I had realised in abject horror that the lights were still off  which had me jumping from my seat in panic, arms waving above my head in an attempt to trip the motion sensors.

I always did hate the dark.

To my dismay not even a flicker of light shone down from the many decrepit bulbs littering the ceiling, and when I finally ceased my flailing. Heavy breaths pushing between parted lips. I heard it again. The noise that had stirred me from a restless sleep. A noise I had believed to have come from a dream but was now making itself known in space I couldn't deny. 

There was a sickening churn of dread that twisted my insides at the thought that I could be dead. What else explains this level of fucking bat shit insane? So what, my life comes to an end one random Wednesday on my way to work? Just splat and I'm gone? Did I fall on the tracks? Get shanked on my way in? If so why can’t I remember it and why please god why am I left here? Haunting my own workplace? What kind of fucked up joke is this? 

And how cliche is that? 

But what if I wasn't dead… What then… I'm not equipped to deal with this shit. All I wanted was a nice easy life, get my paycheck at the end of every month and rot in front of my TV. Was that too much to ask? 

Tap…. Tap…..Tap….

It was coming from the furthest reaches of the warehouse, louder this time as if purposefully trying to steal my attention away from my ever spiralling thoughts. It wasn’t mice. It was too loud, too forceful and way too slow. So now I was left posed with two options. Either ignore the creepy sound, sit back at my desk and pretend it didn't exist or walk towards whatever it was with my crappy phone torch and investigate. 

As much as I loved sitting here in my own misery, I couldn't do that forever, and ultimately I was either going to 

A) find out that I am actually dead 
or 
B) eventually die here anyway. 


So I gathered what little courage I had left floating around inside of me and pulled my phone off charge. Like I had previously stated, the warehouse itself wasn’t all that big, especially in comparison to large corporations like Amazon. I liked it on any normal day  but as I proceeded down the longest aisle of the building to reach the back end of the space it began to feel as though I was getting nowhere. The weak shine of my phone's torch only aiding in illuminating just a few feet in front of me. 

I’ve worked here a little over a year and I can tell you with utmost certainty that it takes only about two minutes to walk the length of the building at a brisk pace. Sure, I had been trepidatious to find the source of the sound so I may have been moving slower than I usually would but it was getting ridiculous. 

I pushed on even when every fibre of my being told me to stop. 

Time moved weirdly now, every movement I made felt slow and muted like wading through a thick marsh and no matter how long I walked, I never seemed to grow any closer to the back of the warehouse. In fact the space ahead of me felt distorted and elongated, thinning almost to a point in the far distance. It continued on like this for what felt like a lifetime. Each footfall bouncing off the walls adding to the pressure I could feel clutching at my skull. I began to regret my decision and when I had all but convinced myself it was no longer worth it to keep going, a green hue sputtered and buzzed to life, beams splaying out across a wall that was not there moments ago. I glanced up, eyes fixating on a fire exit sign hanging atop a freshly materialised back door. The light coming from the sign felt unnaturally bright in contrast to the rest of the room. The glow hummed in an almost nauseating way, twisting my stomach up in knots every time the electricity pulsed. 

It felt like I was being taunted. In some weird fucked up way but at least now I could see the back wall. Which meant I was surely closer to the final aisle that branched off to the right of me. 

The scratching had been a persistent cacophony that grated on my eardrums but now there was yet another noise. 

It sounded like someone was snivelling. As if they were desperately trying to hold back tears. I stopped dead in my tracks, muscles seizing in alarm at the very human sound emanating from somewhere above me. Isn't this what I had wanted? Some proof that I wasn't the only fucker left on the planet?  but in that moment I felt no relief. My skin grew clammy, a cold sweat building upon petrified skin. The grip I had on my phone tightened until I could feel the edges digging red divots in vulnerable skin and with the best will in the world I could not keep the stream of light from bouncing in trepidation as I lifted the torch higher. 

Above me was an endless tower of twisted metal. What was once an aligned and sturdy pallet rack was now looming over me, a mass of concave shelving that  folded over itself again and again, reaching impossible heights as though no ceiling existed anymore to prevent its growth as it stretched into the abyss. 

It groaned under its own weight, unstable and twitching as the crying grew louder. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. My jaw swung open from the absurdity I was bearing witness to. Unsure I reached a tentative hand out, fingers dancing along the rusted metal. Its orange rot flaked off gently at my touch, dancing momentarily in the air before descending slowly onto the ground in front of me. So different from when I had last locked eyes on the shelves, how new they had looked then and how old they were now. 

Any stock that had been placed on the shelving was seemingly gone and I watched on in disbelief as the tower in front of me swayed dangerously the further my gaze wandered up and somewhere up there was a lone box, a large one that would typically be used to store large quantities of items. It was the only thing left on the racking and the longer I stared the quicker I realised that the low moans and watery breath were coming from inside of it. Whatever was in there moved slightly, its body dragging against the thin material that confined it. 

The box was too high up for even the reach truck. There was also a very real chance that the vehicle wouldn't even work in the crazy ass pocket dimension I found myself in. If I wanted to know what was up there, I was going to have to climb… 

Fuck that. 

No, I refused then and I refuse now as I sit here writing this. Climbing up that contorted pile of metal was exactly how I was going to die here if I tried and who knows what fucking monstrosity is up there?. So I ran. I had run as fast as my legs would carry me away from the sound and obtrusive mass that bent unnaturally higher and higher into what was now just a stretch of nothingness above me. This place was unravelling. Each passing hour seemed to distort different parts of the warehouse and on my mad dash back toward the only place I felt any sort of comfort, my desk, it had taken me twice as long to clear the winding pathway back. 

…and yet the wailing only grew louder. 

And my already dwindling sense of safety was slipping through my fingers yet again. 

So now here we are. 42 hours in and I have no idea what to do. The wifi keeps dipping in and out. So I don’t know if this will upload at all. 

…. I don't even know if there is anyone out there.
