The following is based on true events. 

In the summer of 2009 a string of domestic homicides struck a small town in *REDACTED*. The events went mostly unreported due to most major media outlets being focused on the death of pop icon Micheal Jackson. The following is a copy of case number 3489 also known as “The Hysteria Incident”. We would like to thank the Federal Bureau Of Investigation and the families of the victims for this contribution.

*CASE # 36667*
*AKA “The Hysteria Incident”*
*REPORT BY: Detective Charles Whitlock*
*DATE June 27th 2009*
*Subject: Multiple domestic homicides in a small town. Unknown cause. 

*REPORT*
I arrived in *REDACTED* on the 25th. Local police called because they couldn’t make heads or tales of what was going on. In one night 3 men killed there wives and children, all in brutal ways, yet none were connected. One man stabbed his wife in his stomach. She was 7 months pregnant. Once he finished her off he went to his daughter who was hiding in the bathroom and lured her out by telling her it was just a game. The daughter was found decapicated. Father was found swinging from the tree in the backyard. 
No note was left. Neighbors said that the father was acting strange in the days leading up to the murders. One witness claimed they heard the father chanting a series of numbers in a loud voice as if he was chanting some strange spell.

The next was a family of 5. The father tied his wife and 3 children, the oldest being 12 the youngest just 3, to chairs and shot them all in the head at point blank range before turning the gun on himself. Just like the previous victim the father was said to be acting strangely up to the murders, also chanting strange numbers. 

The last family was a young one. The wife and husband high school sweethearts just 24 years old, with an 8 month old baby. The mother was found decapitated. The 8 month old was found in the microwave. The father just like the others then slit his own throat. And you guessed it, father was chanting numbers in the days before the attack. 

I cant make heads or tails of it. Each victim was said to be completely normal up to a few days before the murders. All began saying these numbers. I thought maybe there was a secret cult going on in this community, I mean I’ve seen stranger. I soon find out not only did these men not interact they weren’t even aware of each others existence. 

But I did find one striking similarity. Each father spent many hours in a vehicle. One was a long road trucker, another a beat cop, and the last a driver for a popular car service. But what does this have to do with anything. I began asking around, I interviewed distant family of the victims. Most said they could never see this coming, how each father was a model citizen. That was until the mother of father number three. She said that her son had called her 3 days before the murders saying on his way to pick somebody up the radio turned to static and a voice begain saying random numbers. She said however he didn’t seem affected by it and was calling more to tell her how weird it was. But there is no way that was a coincidence right? The number chanting now i have a perp stating they heard numbers on the radio. So I looked into it. And this gets weird. 6 months ago *REDACTED* a well known technology company installed a radio tower in this town. Many thought nothing of it even welcoming it expecting to get better service. But I drove over to take a look. This tower is locked up like fort knox. I couldn’t even get close before I was stopped. I said I was a detective investigating murders in the area but then get this, a US soldier approached me telling me I didn’t have clearance and to leave. Absolutely bizarre. This just peaked my curiosity more. So I went back to HQ and spoke with the captain. You know what he tells me? Drop it. What the fuck is going on? Im gonna attempt to go in after hours tonight. Yeah maybe I shouldn’t write down how I’m attempting to break the law in my report but at this point I don’t even know who I’m working for. I will continue the report when I get back. 

*REPORT CONTINUED* 
This goes deeper then I ever imagined. The government is using this tech company to develop radio waves to *END OF REPORT* 

*SUPERIORS NOTE*
We were way to close to this whole thing getting revealed. If we want to use this to control these soldiers we should probably learn how to keep it quiet first. The Number Project is on hold until further notice.
