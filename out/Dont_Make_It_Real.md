Day seven. Or maybe eight. It’s hard to say. It’s always night here — the kind of night that never ends, no matter how long you keep your eyes open. I can only guess at the time by how heavy my body feels. I write this to keep track, or to keep sane, or maybe just because there’s nothing else left to do.

I wasn’t supposed to be here. I wasn’t chosen, not really. The third man — the one who was supposed to come — collapsed the day of departure. Fever, delirium, unfit for service. I was pulled in last minute. No briefing. No training. Just a seat on the shuttle and two men who didn’t want me there.

They told me almost nothing. They said the mission was simple: land, plant the device, wait for calibration, retrieve the data, and leave. That’s all. Routine. Harmless.

But there was one rule, and they gave it to me in whispers as if it were a secret they barely dared to speak:

Deny whatever you see. Whatever you hear. If you do that, nothing will touch you. Nothing can.

I thought they were joking.

I don’t think that anymore.

We landed on a remote abandoned planet referred to as P26 on an automated drop ship issued by the Global Reconnaissance and Interplanetary Defense. No pilot, no crew — it followed the landing protocol exactly, bringing us here like clockwork. I still don’t understand how the higher-ups trusted three people with a mission on a remote planet, but I didn’t argue. After gathering our equipment we stepped off the ship.

Jonas Hale, leader of our surveillance team, was a gruff-looking man who seemed annoyed by my mere presence. But I could tell he was a veteran. Tall, short dark hair, weathered face. From my brief time with him, he didn’t seem particularly fond of talking.

The second member of our team — Mark Mercer — was a stark contrast. Short, brown hair, bright eyes. He liked to joke and make light of the situation, which Jonas didn’t find very amusing, but at least it gave me someone to talk to. Because of him, the journey here wasn’t just awkward silence and tension.

I was the last to step off the ship — unprepared, untested, and aware I wasn’t meant to be here. I was a novice in a field I barely understood, not long since I joined G.R.I.D. I wanted to be a writer once. Stories, characters, worlds — that was my life. Now, for some reason I don’t understand, writing is the only thing that seems real, the only thing I still control.

The air was still. Too still. No wind, no animals, nothing, even though the oxygen levels suggested life should still exist. But that wasn’t the unsettling part. While landing, I’d noticed the lights still worked, electricity running through everything. P26 was abandoned hundreds of years ago. How could everything still be working?

When I asked, Jonas didn’t answer, though I caught him squinting at the spectacle, clearly as surprised as I was. Mark glanced at me, his expression silently saying: Don’t look at me — I’m as confused as you are. Everything was running, perfect, as if someone had just walked away. It should have been impossible — and yet it wasn’t. Something about it felt… wrong.

We walked slowly toward the target point. Nobody spoke. I was too busy taking in the place. We passed what looked like an old food shop, the kind I’d only seen in pictures. Shelves stocked with every imaginable product, yet untouched. By how fresh everything looked, you’d expect a clerk behind the counter — but of course, no one was there.

After a few more steps, Mark broke the quiet.

“Always liked this part,” he said, swinging his pack. “First step on a dead world — feels legit cinematic, you know? Maybe we’ll get a nice log entry out of this.”

Jonas didn’t smile. He scanned the buildings, jaw tight.

“Quiet,” he said flatly. “Keep it down. We don’t want to attract attention.”

I glanced between them. “Attract what?”

Jonas stopped and turned his head, voice low and urgent. “Whatever’s here. Don’t talk about it. Don’t point it out. Don’t—” He cut himself off and looked at me directly. “—don’t make it real.”

Mark laughed quietly, a nervous edge to it. “He makes it sound like a haunted house rule. ‘Don’t make it real.’ Classic Jonas.”

“I was at the briefing too,” Mark continued. “They said this is routine. Device goes in, calibrates, we grab the data, and we’re gone. Target’s under a kilometer from here. Short walk. If something goes sideways, we sprint to the ship and we’re airborne in no time.”

“So why the secrecy?” I asked. “If it’s that simple, why the whispers?”

Jonas shrugged. “Words matter. Keep your head. Deny whatever you see or hear. Don’t even indulge a thought about it. That’s the command. That’s all you need.”

“That’s… vague,” I muttered.

“It’s deliberate,” Jonas replied. “You’ll understand. Just remember the rule.”

Mark clapped me on the shoulder as we continued. “Relax, rookie. Chances of seeing anything that’ll ruin your day are slim. We’re in and out. Think of it as a walk through a museum that’s been closed for three centuries — quiet, controlled, nothing to worry about.”

I nodded, but a small chill ran down my spine.

We continued down the street, my eyes sweeping over every detail — cracked windows, faded paint, a stray chair overturned here and there — all frozen in time.

Then I noticed it.

A shadow. Just for a moment, sliding across the side of a building. At first, I thought it was my imagination. The angle of the light from the streetlamps, maybe a flicker of my own movement.

“Did you see that?” I whispered, glancing at Mark and Jonas.

Jonas’s head snapped toward me, expression unreadable. “See what?” he said quietly.

“I… I think I saw something. Something moving.”

Mark gave me a nervous grin. “Maybe it’s a stray drone from G.R.I.D. Or a raccoon. You’ve seen the old pictures, right? Ridiculous little creatures. I heard they move in packs and eat humans. So, you know — stay on guard.”

“I’ve seen raccoons,” I muttered. “Wait… they eat humans?”

Jonas stepped closer, his voice low and tight. “Don’t. Don’t acknowledge it. Whatever it is, it doesn’t exist unless you let it. Deny it. That’s the rule.”

I swallowed hard, forcing my mind to obey. Nothing there. Just an empty street. My heart thumped louder than usual, and as we walked I couldn’t shake the feeling that whatever had cast that shadow had noticed me first.

The street opened up into a small clearing. The faint sound of the planet’s electrical grid vibrated beneath our boots, oddly comforting and yet unnerving. The target point was marked by a simple metal plate embedded in the ground — the spot where the device was supposed to go.

Jonas crouched first, inspecting the plate. “Looks intact. Nothing tampered with. Good.”

Mark set down his pack and started unpacking the device, his fingers moving quickly but carefully. “You’d think a planet abandoned for centuries would have more dust, more decay,” he muttered. “Everything’s… pristine. It’s weird, isn’t it?”

“It’s not weird,” Jonas said. “It’s expected. That’s why we’re here.”

I kneeled beside them, looking at the box-shaped device. My hands hovered over it for a moment before touching it. “So… once we plant it, it just calibrates automatically?”

Mark nodded. “Yep. Stand back, watch it run. Less than ten minutes, and we’re done. Then back to the ship.”

Jonas’s gaze swept the perimeter. “Stay alert. Don’t acknowledge anything unusual. Follow the rule. Understand?”

I swallowed. “Yeah… I understand.”

I pressed the device onto the metal plate. It clicked into place with a satisfying hum, lights blinking in a pattern that made it feel almost alive.

“Calibrating,” Mark said. “Almost done.”

I stepped back, looking at the surrounding buildings again. Everything seemed normal. Too normal. I shook the thought away. Nothing unusual. Just a street.

Jonas’s voice cut through my thinking. “Good. Keep it that way. Don’t let your mind wander. Deny it.”

I nodded, forcing my eyes back on the device. And somewhere at the edge of my vision, I thought I saw movement again — just a flicker, gone before I could focus. My stomach tightened.

“Almost done,” Mark said again, though his grin had faded slightly. “Then we’re clear.”

Jonas didn’t speak. He simply watched.

And then I realized — something flickered in the corner of my eye. But this time, it didn’t vanish. Every instinct screamed to look directly at it, but I resisted. I whispered in my mind: It’s not real. Deny it. Don’t acknowledge it.

Still, the shape in the corner of my vision kept growing. No — not growing. Moving. Slowly. Deliberately. Closer.

My curiosity, my need to understand, overpowered what little rationality I had left. I couldn’t stop myself. I turned my head. I looked.

At first, I couldn’t tell what I was looking at. The streetlights were dim and patchy, but beyond the haze, standing near the edge of the square, there it was — the tallest figure I’d ever seen. Humanoid, yes, but stretched, elongated.

It wore a hat — a wide, old-fashioned brim — and something like a trench coat, pale yellow and almost luminous under the streetlights. The rest of it was lost in shadow, but even at this distance I knew: this wasn’t a person.

“I…” My voice cracked. “I see something. There’s something there.”

Mark’s grin flickered out like a dying lightbulb. “What do you mean ‘something’?”

“It’s—” I stammered, my mouth dry. “It’s tall. Really tall. Wearing a hat. A coat. It’s just… standing there.”

For the first time, Jonas’s mask broke. He whipped toward me, eyes hard and burning. “Stop,” he hissed. “Don’t describe it.”

“But it’s—”

“Shut up!” Jonas snapped. His voice was still low, but it carried a raw edge, a kind of fear I hadn’t heard from him before. “You’re making it worse.”

Mark swallowed, glancing around. His voice had lost its playfulness. “Two minutes left on the calibration,” he muttered. “Then we’re out.”

Two minutes. My stomach twisted. Two minutes suddenly felt like a lifetime.

Jonas grabbed my arm, his fingers digging in hard. “Look at me. Breathe. Close your eyes. Say it isn’t real. You hear me? It’s not real unless you make it real.”

I tried. God, I tried. I squeezed my eyes shut, whispered under my breath: It’s not real. It’s not real. It’s not real. My heartbeat drummed against my skull.

But something shifted. A prickle at the back of my neck. The air felt heavier. Against my better judgment, I opened my eyes.

It was closer.

Not a lot — but enough. Maybe twenty meters now. Its silhouette loomed larger, details sharper. The coat rippled as if in a breeze that didn’t exist. It moved, but not like moving should look. My eyes said it was stepping, but my brain couldn’t find the steps. It simply was closer than before. Every blink, every heartbeat, it closed the distance.

My throat locked up. “It’s— it’s moving—”

Mark’s voice cracked. “Is it here? Is it coming closer?”

Jonas spun and slammed his fist into Mark’s chest, knocking the wind out of him. “What are you doing?” he hissed, teeth bared. “Don’t say that! Don’t acknowledge it! Close your eyes, now. Deny it. Deny it!”

Mark staggered back, clutching his chest, eyes wide and wet. “This is insane,” he whispered. “Why does this thing take so fucking long?” His head turned sideways and whipped back in an instant. His voice wavered. “God damn it, I think I can see him now too. Let’s just leave. Who cares about the survey.”

Jonas stood frozen for a beat, breathing hard. His hands trembled. Then he said, hurried, “Alright. We’ll leave. We’ll circle around the street and—”

The words hung in the air and then… nothing.

Silence. Thick, suffocating. No footsteps, no movement, no voices. My chest tightened and I opened my eyes just a fraction.

“Jonas? Mark?” I whispered, voice trembling. “Are you… are you there?”

Nothing.

I froze, heart hammering, willing myself to believe it was a trick of the shadows. Maybe they were just hiding, messing with me — my imagination. My rational mind tried to convince me: They’re fine. It’s the stress. The calibration is almost done. It’s nothing.

I lowered my head, pressing my forehead against my knees. My eyes closed again, desperate, whispering the mantra over and over: It’s not real. It doesn’t exist. Deny it. Deny it. My breath came in ragged gasps.

And then — I fully opened my eyes. I dared not lift my head, could barely even focus. Just feet. Black shoes. Standing so close that I could feel the space they occupied in my mind even before seeing them fully.

I couldn’t. I couldn’t look up. My whole body screamed against it. Jonas and Mark… dead. Or worse. Their absence was a void I could feel. My hands shook uncontrollably.

“It’s my fault,” I whispered, choking on the words. “It’s all my fault. And now… now I’m next.”

I forced my eyes shut again, praying for the sweet release of the end, for sleep or unconsciousness, anything to take me away. But nothing came. The pounding of my heart, the ragged hiss of my breath, the deafening silence — it was all I had.

A minute passed, or maybe ten. Time had no meaning here. Hesitantly, trembling, I opened my eyes. Nothing. No Mark. No Jonas. No tall figure. Just the empty street.

Panic took me over. I scrambled to my feet and ran, directionless at first, pure instinct driving me toward the ship. My legs burned. My lungs screamed. The low sound of the automated drop ship was a siren of salvation. I threw myself into it, slamming the hatch shut behind me.

Relief hit briefly — and then terror returned.

The controls didn’t respond. Communication systems were dead. The console blinked, but no signals, no routing, no escape. I was trapped. Every emergency protocol was inaccessible. I was utterly alone.

The ship had supplies. Food and water — enough for days, barely. I stayed inside, trembling, writing everything down, trying to keep my mind together. Days passed. The darkness never lifted. No one came to rescue.

I had to leave eventually. Supplies were running low. Hunger gnawed at me. Thirst made my throat raw. And the presence… I could feel it, somewhere outside. Watching. Waiting. Patient.

I write this now as my last entry inside the ship. Perhaps no one will ever read it. Perhaps I won’t survive what I have to do next.

I don’t understand. Why was I spared? Where are Jonas and Mark? They weren’t killed. They didn’t leave. They vanished. The device is calibrated. And yet… I remain.

I have no choice. I have to step outside. I have to find food, water… maybe answers.

And somewhere, somewhere in the darkness, I know it is still there.
