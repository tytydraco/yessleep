Hello it seems that my mother accepted you and i to have a sleepover at their house. Mine is relatively easy so dont worry. If you follow the rules found on this piece of paper you will be safe (Atleast i think so)

Rule 1: Be here before 7pm. Because after 7pm is when they are the most active. If you end up not being here before 7 call me dont just disappear.

Rule 2: Dont go to my parents room. In under any circumstances you should never go there. If you do it then it wont be long before they will get you

Rule 3: Me and my siblings are all named after greek gods and goddesses you should introduce yourself with a fake greek god/goddesses name it will intimedate the things. If you dont then refer to rule 4a and 4b

Rule 4a: Kill yourself.

Rule 4b: You will say your kidding and introduce yourself with the fake name name. If your fail to do so refer to rule 4a.

Rule 5a: My oldest brothers Castor and Cadmus are twins both are 20. If start talking to you. Curse them and walk away. Cursing them and not walking away will result in a fate worse than death.

Rule 5b: If my brothers are casually talking with my dad run and hide. My brothers has different father than the rest of my siblings. Thus they despise eachother.

Rule 5c: If one of my brothers call you to talk feel free to do whatever you want to do. Reject their offer or accept. They dont care. Its the real them

Rule 6: We have a dance studio and workout room inside the house. They are on the 2nd floor. Also there is only one bedroom there that happens to be mine. So if you cant find a workout room or dance studio on the 2nd floor. Leave immedietly before you have time. 

Rule 7a: I have an infant sister Alecto. Do not say her name boyish. Although she is an infant be afraid of her. The things are very fond of her.

Rule 7b: Dont go to inside the nursery. Especially if Alecto is inside. The things are very protective of her.

Rule 8: My dad is from Germany. So he speaks German from time to time ignore it. Even if you know German he is from Bavaria you wont understand his accent. Put on your earmuff

Rule 9a: We have a cat, a dog and rabbits. But the rabbit is always inside the backyard. We never let them in. However if you see rabbits inside the house. Pray that my dog or my cat is near. If you fail to do so refer to rule 4a.

Rule 9b: Dont go to the backyard. The rabbits and the things dont like people.

Rule 10: We have a mealplan stuck up on the frigde for the day. If the food is anything other whats on the mealplan. Dont eat it. Give it to my dog. He knows what to do.

Rule 11a: Before going to sleep, you should have an earmuff and sleep mask its crucial for survival. If you dont have it refer to rule 4a.

Rule 11b: Be up before 9a.m

Rule 11c: Be asleep before 12p.m. If you arent then refer to rule 4a.

Rule 11d: Say "I shall be protected by whoever wants to protect me" my dog likes having things to do especially during the night.

Rule 12: Your parents should pick you up at exactly at 11:00. Not 10:59 not 11:01 just 11:00. And always have track of time.

Ok i think you read all the rules. I hope we will have a fun time! Bye see you tommorow

As i read this paper left by my classmate Athena. I wondered if she was crazy. I mean i had heard some crazy stuff about her. About how people went missing after having sleepovers with her or her brothers being prisoners who escaped i didnt believe any of them. They were just crazy. I decided to go what could happen. I didnt had to convince my parents. They quickly accepted. Odd. But whatever. 

As they dropped me off at her place. It was 6:36. One rule followed. As she opened the door her house looked super nice. The furniture, decor. Everything just screamed expensive there were animal heads everywhere and fur carpets. I dont understand why people dont like her. I introduced myself as Hera. Again one rule followed. I saw both Cadmus and Castor walk towards me. I said "Fuck you two" and quickly walked away. One rule followed. It was dinnertime. And i looked at their fridge an lo-and-behold there was the mealplanner. It was lasagna for dinner. I dont have any problem. They served me steak. I gave it to the dog. Again one rule followed. She dragged me to see her sister Alecto. I didnt say anything about her name and left. One rule followed. I put in my earmuff and my sleep mask. And as i said "I shall be protected by anyone who wants to protect" her dog came at me. It was a mastiff too big to be inside but he was protecting me i dont care. One rule followed. But the day after. My head was hurting super bad i wanted to cry. When i woke up it was almost 11 a.m."Shoot i must've overslept".  My parents were here to pick me up as Ms.Gorey (Athena''s mother) said i excitedly hurried to the front door. When i saw my parents car outside. I almost cried. After i got inside my parents asked what time did i wake up at. I told them "I dont know". They once again asked me when did i wake up.
