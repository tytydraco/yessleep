“It’s senseless! Goddamn bloody senseless!” 

Antoine had gotten loud and red-faced. He’d missed the return again, his backhand increasingly sloppy as his bottle of brandy grew decreasingly full. 

“You’ve said. You’re too drunk to play.”

“Imbeciles, all! Children whose parents—mothers and fathers and the other thing—never taught them any goddamn sense! It’s just so…”

“Senseless, Antoine?”

“Quite right. What’s the score then?”

“Um, 80-Love now. You’re too drunk to play.”

“Nonsense. I’m ripening is all. Service, if you would, G’zrad.”

Antoine had read the Express that morning and took the news personally. Another new religious movement had taken hold on Earth, something frivolous; spread by telegram evangelists and idling tastemakers, like so many other trends that had come out of the giddy bustle of the nineteen-twenties. Antoine was offended by the newness of it all. He was a traditionalist, an aristocratic scion of the *Old Mars* and *Old Earth* and as ever, with the bloom of change, he blustered.  

I called the score, served. Another ace. Another asymptotic matchpoint. Antoine was oblivious to both his failings on the court and my courtesy. 

“The Hahamenites! Honestly, G’zrad. If I have to remember another goddamned litany of canonical whatsits, I’ll throw myself from Olympus bloody Mons!”

“The Thesians might take exception to that. And the Grumaal. Both forbid acts of theatricality on the Mons. 100 serving Love.”

“Thesians are all space gypsies.” He paused, seeming to consider the rough edge of his statement. The ball flew by him unchallenged. “I know that’s an unpopular sentiment, but it’s true.”

“My wife is a Thesian, Antoine.” I smiled pleasantly.  Something I’d learned from the Italian diplomats that occasionally gathered in the smoking lounge of Hooker & Thistle to discuss silent film and Tharsisian consular scandal. “Shall we continue with the game, or shall we call it a wash?”

Antoine let his racket dangle as he slumped, dejected. Ire was a tiring business, and Antione was far too wealthy to have developed a constitution for exertion. I felt sorry for him—after a fashion. His crisis was existential, one born of privilege and boredom and a fruitless search for importance. And even sober, he was a terrible tennis player. That handicap would see him relegated to some modest post in the embassy—a file clerk, a stamp man.  There was no prestige there. But on Mars, especially in Tharsis, one simply could not advance in society without an aptitude for tennis. It had been that way for a millennium. 

I shouldered my racket and kept a polite distance from Antione’s dismay.  Then in his misery, he let slip a small truth. He slurred it, possibly to himself. 

“They look like you, Annabelle. Don’t they? Those Hahamenite devils.”

He had only spoken of *Annabelle* once, weeping over a portly Spanish doxy at some brothel or another. He’d been miserable then too if only slightly less drunk. I let him wallow for a while. 

——

Milling the street outside of Hooker & Thistle, there was the usual crowd of tidy toffs and blood-eyed cut purses and stray porters. The criminal element of Tharsis knew better than to linger in the open sun. They were opportunists, alley cats, and for a price, exceedingly useful. 

I clocked Pennylick Pete at once in his thuggish flat cap and preposterous mustard-colored silk jabot. He gestured for me as I met his eye. I nodded discreetly. 

“Antoine, do consider a glass of water when you make it back home. It might save you for the Expo tonight.”

“You’re a lousy drinking buddy G’zrad.”

“On a Tuesday morning, I’m as good as you’ll find.”

He scoffed, then made eyes at the remainder of his bottle and waved me off. There was a chance he’d be sober by the Grand Exposition that night, but just as likely he’d drag himself in stinking of spirits, glassy and slurring about Hahamenites and Martian Tariffs and the price of wine. Pete watched him leave curiously, tasting our discord, smirking from the shadow beneath one of the thousand great red arches that permeated the city, swollen up from the ferrous dust below. 

“Good day Peter.” I gave him an Italian smile. 

“Grumaal save that tongue of yours for someone else’s ass, Gizz. Peter makes me sound like a fucking Saint.”

“I was under the impression that you were well on your way.”

“You’re not as funny as you think, Moon man.”

“Perhaps. What have you got for me?”

He drew a thin cigarette from his waistcoat pocket and lit it as we settled down onto a cloistered little bench beside a statue of someone unremarkable. He looked uneasy but tried to look aloof. Pete was from Earth, the nephew or second cousin of some gangster who had packed up his viciousness and fled 140 million miles to a place that didn’t know his infamy. It was a common enough story. One that made the well-to-do of Mars bristle with isolationist fancies. 

The rat-faced dandy surveyed me the way a farmer might an unsturdy ram. 

“You first.”

Pennylick Pete’s information came relatively cheaply. Or at least cheaply for me. I made my living as an artist and Pete was blessedly a pervert. 

I’ll explain. 

I had studied with Dumahl and Ka’rrare in neo-realism and post-theistic baroque. I was on my way to some significance if not greatness. But Dumahl had made an appointment with the gallows some years back and Ka’rrare had flown off to Earth chasing the busty daughter of a shipping tycoon. Both had succumbed in their own ways to nag of success and left me adrift in the world of Martian fine art. 

It was in poverty and anonymity afterwards that I found myself hiring out as the third-man, the artful creeper, in the exhibitionist sexual dalliances of a Baroness and her menagerie of boy lovers. I sketched from time to time, most of my work being confined to leering from behind parlor palms and occasionally moaning gruffly. The baroness noticed my distraction. The sketching lost me my job as a professional voyeur and thrust me into another.  At the Baroness’s insistence. And so I became a society pornographer. 

I still sketched, though many of those works were secondary to the immense oil paintings on which my debauched clientele spent small fortunes. Pennylick Pete was a collector of the secondary, and this day, I had a rather lurid sketch of a skinny aristocrat doing something inventive with the knob of a riding saddle. I handed it over. Pete grinned out a puff of smoke. 

“Well, Saint Peter?  If you have holy water, spill it.”

“Ooh, disgusting, Gizzy—you beautiful man.”  He savored the image for a moment. “You have heard of the Hahamenites, I’d wager?”

“I’ve read the print. A vexing group for an acquaintance of mine.”

“Antoine Stuckley? I saw you two. Seen you before as well.”

“Hmm.”

“He’s a god awful tennis player I’ve heard.”

“He’s ripening. And the slosh of brandy puts him off balance.”

“Well he’s part of it. In a way. And the port workers say that artillery is finding its way into Tharsis by way of the Thesian fundamentalists and…other elements.”  Pete folded the sketch delicately and tucked it into his jacket. 

“Other elements—your relations, I take it?”

He answered with a smug, chiding smile. 

“War then?  With whom?”

“Earth. The whole fucking rock.”

“Why?”

“Why else? Religion. Power. Senator G’starum has an issue with koalas apparently. They’re a kind of tree bear. A bit like a cat that thinks it’s an infant. Anyway, the whole government is seething.”

“And what does it have to do with the Hahamenites? And Stuckley?”

Pennylick Pete suddenly took on a serious look, which read as menacing on his sharp little face. 

“They’re growing in influence, some say they’ve spread halfway around the planet and fast. It would be a matter for Earth to sort out I guess, but they’ve been hopping ships to this dust ball, and…” Pete paused as if gathering his next words.  “They believe that tennis is a sin.”

“Impossible.”

“They say it’s not a funny sport.”  The way he looked down at the burning tip of his cigarette—I could almost mistake his mood for sympathy. “Your man Stuckley’s sister—she’s their painted fucking Messiah apparently. A prophetess. She’ll put an end to tennis if she isn’t stopped. And with it…”

“Us.  Thesiah’s hypercube, that is bad news.”  

He shrugged and stubbed out the cigarette. “We’ll be enemies soon. In theory. I’ll miss your bawdy eye.”  He spat as if to dismiss the sentimentality of the past few moments. “You might wanna distance yourself from the Brit. Find another rich friend.”

Antoine Stuckley was intolerably self-involved at times, but he, like Pennylick Pete, was usefully well informed on certain matters. Moreover he was a drinking companion of half of Earth’s Western diplomatic mission. And he could be persuaded to cajole his fellows when he was in his cups. I couldn’t bear to think of making yet another sloppy influential drunkard into a friend. 

“Stuckley has nothing to do with these Hahamenites, I shouldn’t think. He seemed livid that they should exist at all.”

“If that’s true, Gizz, then you care, but I can’t imagine anyone else will.  They’ll string him up just to be safe and if you’re anywhere near the poor boy…”

He was right, of course. I stood, feeling grim. “I have a client soon. As always, Peter, it has been a delight.”

——

In Lord and Lady Yrala’s sunniest parlor there was a tapestry that spanned an entire wall. It was nearly intact but complete enough to tell a story of tennis: 

In dreary dun and russet there was the beginning—over a thousand years into the past and all the time before, a pack of Martian mothers huddled together and wrapped in unruly hides and cloth. In the soil, the wind blew little yellow-green velvet circles to and fro, tracing ink black satin tracks across the dust flats. 

It is no secret that Martian eggs—those circles—are in want of jostling in order to incubate. In our planet’s savage past, the caprice of nature would do the work. The eggs would develop imprecisely, hatching dullards and half-wits to hide in the Martian soil and sculpt faces out of rock and crush beetles for sport. 

Our forebears—theirs was a trajectory of mediocrity. Until one day, a pair of young mothers took to swatting an egg back and forth, allowing it to bounce in the interim. They were the first to jostle with finesse. The tapestry bloomed into a riot of color by the end. Our recent past. An unrelenting epoch of Martian progress. 

Lady Yrala was the student of history. Her husband was pretty and a famous bore. He had become a senator, as was the way of the irredeemably unskilled, but at Hooker & Thistle and a half-dozen other gentleman’s clubs around Tharsis, he was widely, if quietly, mocked as ‘unvolleyed’—a simpleton. 

He was no different as I worked. 

In the midst of marital congress, he plodded away as an ungainly automaton might, and Lady Yrala fiddled with the tassel of a plump cushion beneath her, occasionally sighing out a perfunctory moan. He had taken her from behind as he had during our past three sessions. 

I marked the undertones of periwinkle and olive green in Lord Yrala’s mostly bare flank, as I spoke:

“Senator Yrala, if you would permit it, I should like to know your opinion on these Hahamenites people are speaking of.”

He continued thrusting mechanically as he mused—or as he seemed to. Lord Yrala wasn’t one for reading the paper or anything else, but it was a courtesy in the business of pornography to address a gentleman first when a gentleman was at the easel. 

“Umm. The *Ha-hamen-ites*. Well, certainly they have left an impression. A rather, some would say, remarkable group. Misunderstood—and yet understood too well. Aren’t they?”  For the first time since he’d begun to thrust, there was a shade of cyan creeping into his face—exertion. 

Lady Yrala came to his rescue. Her Italian smile was perhaps better than mine. 

“They are a threat to everything we are. Ridiculous that they should dress themselves as they do, being such vicious creatures that they are.”

“Quite so?” I probed. 

Lord Yrala seemed relieved not to be burdened with thought. His emptied expression might be useful depending on the final direction the painting took, I noted it. Lady Yrala expounded:

“You know, they’re meant to look like clowns—the Hahamenites. A vestige of the Italian Commedia dell'Arte.”

“I’m unfamiliar.”

“It doesn’t matter that you are. Suffice it to say, they’re meant to be funny. But many humans find them off putting for some reason. No wonder they’ve embraced a billion clowns on Earth—“ Lady Yrala flinched. “I’m coming, my love. Well met.”  She took a moment to moan. Lord Yrala seemed demurely satisfied. “Anyway, G’zrad, I think you’ll find that Humankind is self-destructive as a rule. Fitting really.”

*Fitting*. She must’ve been aware of the gathering of arms, of the plans to move toward war with Earth. Perhaps she had a hand in it. Her family was an influential one, wealthy and well connected to the Martian Navy through a long line of Admirals and courageous young martyrs.  Her tone, post orgasmic though it might’ve been, was resolute to the point of sounding glib. 

“Surely their doom isn’t so inevitable, Your Grace.”

She narrowed her eyes.

“Do you make a habit of interrogating your clients, pornographer?”  

I’d spoken out of turn. She’d caught me being overly knowledgeable. Lord Yrala seemed to be spasmodically huffing his way into a climax of his own, but Lady Yrala was unfazed, so I parried:

“Only the interesting ones, Your Grace.”

She smirked slyly and pulled away from her husband. 

“Tell me, G’zrad. You’re married aren’t you? Are you charming with your wife?”

“I wasn’t aware that I was charming at all.”

“Charming men always say things like that. Do you paint her?”

“With every brush stroke. They’re just arranged inconspicuously.”

“You have a poet’s soul, pornographer.”  She dabbed at her 𝕢𝕦𝕚𝕧𝕖𝕣𝕚𝕟𝕘 𝕄𝕒𝕣𝕥𝕚𝕒𝕟 𝕤𝕝𝕚𝕔𝕜𝕟𝕖𝕤𝕤 with a blanket. “And you’re handsome. I think I’d like to bed you. Just to see.”

I shifted on my stool and as if by the timing of Thesiah’s own infinite celestial clockwork, a servant boy entered and spared me the discomfort of responding. 

He was dressed queerly, garishly, his face painted bone white with little flourishes of plum to accent his bulbous red nose. I gasped, not in horror, but in bewilderment. Lady Yrala had never been so flamboyant with the uniforms of her staff and—

“*No*.  NOT IN THIS HOUSE, YOU SUDDENLY JOBLESS WRETCH!”

Lady Yrala had grown immeasurably more attractive in her rage. I shouldn’t have thought of her that way. It was unprofessional and she seemed apt to indulge my wandering fancy. 

“What’s he done—oh, good gracious.” Lord Yrala looked as though he’d sucked something outwardly flavorless to its sour core.

“He’s one of…*them*.” Full of contempt, a curl of disgust. 

The no-longer-servant boy frowned, then grinned (unsettlingly, but not horrifically) wide. Lord Yrala was once more erect. Lady Yrala was too irate to notice. As the clown boy scampered out a tight jig, she seethed. 

“GET OUT!”

Then I too found myself 𝕖𝕟𝕘𝕠𝕣𝕘𝕖𝕕. Unprofessional. 

“I shall see myself out as well, Your Graces. Perhaps I shall see you both at the Expo?”

Lord Yrala smiled congenially and I wondered if he hadn’t noticed his wife’s unmistakable advance or didn’t care. 

——

The crowd buzzed at the Grand Exposition of Martian Scientific Arts and fully one-third of those attending were clowns or clown-ish. Some seemed confused about the finer points of the presentation. Silk top hats yawned open at the cap, shading half-painted faces. Every here and there a waistcoat was a violent shade of green or orange polka dot and oversized shoes peeked out from otherwise elegant gowns. At the usually well-attended *Advancements in Practical Tennistry* stall, two women scuffled with a man in ruffles and motley and the energy tightened like a fist. 

I found Antoine drunk and brooding beside a cagily shrouded exhibit promising **SOMETHING NEW IN GAY OLD NEW YORK**.  The banner luffed and Antoine looked small beneath it. 

“Antoine. Feeling well?”

He sobbed briefly. “She’s done it again.”

“Who?”

“My sister.”

“Ah.”

“She was always so bloody funny. My favorite uncle said she should be on stage. He said I should do something safe. The old bastard was a soothsayer.”

Antoine tugged passively at the Gay Old New York shroud. “She used to look up to me, you know?  I liked that. Made me feel like I might grow up to be worthy of a child’s admiration. One day.” He chuckled. “Maybe I still could.”

“You’re being morose. And your sister’s followers are trouble.”  

I looked around and spotted five painted faces in the vicinity—Martians. One was dripping with what looked like pie.  The rest looked hungry, vacant, or both. Their human counterparts would court their own Armageddon were they not careful and I had a suspicion that the announcement beginning hostilities would occur this night. I felt bad for Antoine. And a little bit for myself. 

“You know Antoine, I think there’s meant to be a homeopathic gin stall somewhere around here that—“  

I cut myself mid-comfort and stared in disbelief as a regiment of Martian troops intruded upon a gathering of Hahamenites. At the rear of their tidy ranks was Lord Yrala and two other Senators. Each dressed in the pompous regalia of military commanders, high hats with enormous red plumes, sweeping sabres with gilded hilts. Yrala was festooned with medals as though he’d ever seen anything more than an honorary commendation. The martians he pretended at marshaling were all young, their faces fully of stiff-jawed pride or hints of venom. The Expo was going to be a mess. 

“Antoine, dear boy. You might find the festivities a bit…murderous soon. I’m sure we could find you a bar or a club somewhere…”

Antoine was plainly blind to the growing tension and the precarious peace. He slumped dramatically and tossed an edge of the New York shroud around his neck like a pashmina. It suited him.

“Maybe I’d do better in America,” he groaned. “New York perhaps. Apparently they’re doing new things. I don’t remember where I heard that, G’zrad, but it sounds *safe* doesn’t it?  A friendly consular post?”

“A splendid notion.”

The shroud swelled up around him as his eyes panned the nearby stalls and passing Martian boots.

“Or maybe I could be a writer? Memoirs or Horror fiction?”

“An implausible notion...”

His gaze flirted with a small booth, its marquee hastily assembled. The thin promise it boasted wasn’t altogether helpful: **Find self-affirmation through literary folly!**

“I could be the next Mary Shelley or—or Blair Daniels.”

He was delusional, spiraling, too drunk or not drunk enough. At the head of the military column, a Hahamenite basted a soldier with water from a boutineer on his lapel. He lost half his teeth a moment later and the column broke into a fierce melee. Antoine sighed. 

“Or maybe I’m good enough as a diplomat. What do you think?”

I was preempted by a familiar voice. 

“Clearly you are a singular peacemaker, Human.” Lady Yrala had emerged from a throng of identically dressed gentlemen. She hooked her arm around mine and gazed upon the fray. “I had a feeling something like this might happen. What do you think, pornographer?  Bellicose enough?”

“Your Grace. I assume this is some sort of prelude?”

“I’m sure I don’t know what you mean. Unless you’re flirting, in which case, most certainly.”

“I mean the troops.”

“Shame. Well we must have a reason, mustn’t we?  It would seem impolite to invade our neighbor without just cause.”

“Invade? I assume you only meant to attack.”

Lady Yrala brushed a hand against my chest and whatever was beneath the New York shroud seemed to move. Something new indeed. An army of invaders, a parade of un-volleyed missiles. Earth had just concluded their *Great War*.  They were far from prepared to sally forth into another. Yrala’s husband now hacked wildly about with his saber and the self-affirming writers cowered beneath an insubstantial table and the thing beneath the shroud was definitely moving. 

Yrala sighed wistfully. “Tell me, pornographer. What is your game?”

“Tennis, of course.”

“Clever. But I mean all of the interloping and shoulder grazing. I’ve asked around about you, and you seem to be everyone’s confidant. How is that? And why?”

“It chases away the boredom—acting like a spy. That and I happen to be quite nosey.”

She pulled away to regard my face deliberately. She was quite a pretty thing so close. 

“I don’t believe you.”

“I don’t care. Your Grace.”

A senator named Rimaan shouted anti-Earth epithets from a dais and a pack of gowned Aristocrats beat a Hahamenite mercilessly with their handbags and a child made off with a gilded bust of some emperor and the ground ran pink with blood and makeup. War was upon us and I stood inches from one provocateuse and the retching brother of another. It was farcical. 

“If I kissed you, pornographer, would you be so bold as to take advantage?” Yrala’s tone was hopeful, prodding, dangerous. 

“Umm—“

But once again I was saved by something improbable. A man in an emerald green tailcoat sulked out from behind the New York shroud and the massive shifting thing it hid. He shouted into the din:

“I am a humble knickerbocker, but I bring exciting news from the jewel of America’s eastern shore! Behold!”

He yanked at the shroud and Antoine was swallowed beneath it. The hidden thing was…

“Marvelous…” Yrala’s eyes were seduced away from me and toward the behemoth winged pig that the shroud had concealed. 

The rabble quieted almost at an instant, the consuming silence punctuated by occasional gasps and breathy exclamations.

“Beautiful..”

“Stupendous..”

“Thesiah’s menagerie, they’ve done it again.”

The emerald barker filled the quiet with a booming bit of showmanship. He called a command to the beast and it took off into the red sky above. 

“Transportation, reimagined!  As we sit here, I have received word that this elegant creature has replaced tram, train, automobile, and buggy as the preferred method of transportation in New York City!  Think of what they could do for Mars!”

My mind filled with possibilities. Endlessly, rapturously.  Above, the hulking slab flitted about. It lifted my spirits with it—a joyous creature. I turned to Yrala who was weeping with glee. 

“Your Grace. Let’s have a baby. Today.”

“Yes.  But no—your wife…”

“She’s been dead for thirty years.”

“I’ve seen her at parties.”

“A ghost, I’m afraid (but not *afraid* like that).

“How modern… Then yes. Right now.”

We were, in our sudden wild lust, the spark that lit a conflagration of sex—the Grand Orgy of 1926. The pig had made it so, I think, a jovial beacon of appetite and excess.  The event persisted thereafter—an erotic celebration of unity and the potential of keen minds and novel ideas. 

In the months that followed, the giant flying pig overtook the trend of Hahamenitism as de rigeur on Earth. Such is the fickle whimsy of our neighbor amongst the stars. But for once, their drifting attention was one I could fully comprehend. 

The rest, I try and fail to understand. Humans are a silly people. They scare themselves intentionally with literature when their existence is frightening enough, they view pornography as filth when it is clearly an art form, and they think that tennis is a game rather than a means to societal greatness. 

Lady Yrala understands a bit more now, I should think. She smiles. Antoine sits beside the incubation court on a little bench, deep in his cups, as ever. He’s writing a memoir between the doses of spirit, and he’s learning. Lord Yrala is still oblivious—a cuckold, but a happy one. And as I lift an egg, I summon a bit of charm for Lady Yrala and for everyone else. 

“Love all.”

A score yes, but [a decent start to any endeavor](https://reddit.com/r/decogent/s/bfe1DKFddR)
