In 1997, I lived in the type of vintage-y multi-room clusterfuck. From the creaky, 10 inch wide, no-rail stairway leading downward, to where the garage was placed at the outsiders bottom of the hill. Barely any vision was possible outside the garage windows due to the aging, foggy glass. Beyond this, if you turned around and looked at the 25 feet in total length behind the stairs, it stretched a bit far back—I’m not sure how long. It wasn’t far, but it was creepy when the bulb’s string wasn’t pulled. Even then, the light was dim, mentally draining, and took a toll. There was a washing machine and dryer with a vintage scooper.

My grandma was dying and never cared to come down. However, she probably used it about four years ago. I just let it sit in place since it was already rusted back then. Some of the grandchildren’s (I think) toys were scattered a bit behind the stairs. Other things, like an old, broken-down wooden swing set, were right there. There were some of those old smock-and-plastic Halloween costumes in an industrial cabinet, along with out-of-place personal cards from work friends and some dead relatives—most likely, based on the dates. For whatever reason, what stood out most of everything...

Looking from the last stair, there was the '70s-style, somewhat livable living room, and that was all I had. It was 20 feet long and 15 feet wide. Old shag carpet, an old, nasty-looking, dusty-feeling TV—just a TV that sat on the rug, no stand—was against the right wall. Across from that, there was a somewhat long couch. The couch was hardened, with ugly, textured leather. Beyond that, I can’t recall much of the room. At the far end, I think there were either old unsleeved records or something similar. Across from there was a hallway, which was bare and even emotionless.

I wish I could remember what was in there. The way I got through it was with my dying grandma throwing down two blankets, maybe three towels. That was all I had. I rarely had friends over—just two, years ago, when she wasn’t near dying. Phones didn’t exist for us, mostly. At least I could shower for a bit in room-temperature water. Outside the room, closer to the garage door, toward the right, was a non-spacious mini bathroom. It had no door and barely a sink.

The sink was moldy, just like the shower, but I knew the water wouldn’t always be enough. I just wanted to stay down there. I never felt like trying to go upstairs. She was ill and had most likely forgotten who I was or that I even existed.

By the second week, I tried to open the garage door. It was too heavy, probably from all the years of plastering itself into the concrete. In some places, it was black and stained with 1950s dirt. The shower was almost just human-sized, I guess. I wish, in the long run, I had some sort of full, clear reflection of what I looked like living in that occasionally cobwebbed hellhole.
