My cat was named Spiderman. He was a little cuddly jerk of a black cat, who hated everyone and everything except for me, my wife, my daughter, and my son. Even my son he was only just starting to warm up to.

Any cat owner knows that cats get up to all sorts of hi-jinks at night. Ours was no different: Spiderman would run around chasing imaginary mice, would jump onto high places just to leer at us, would rustle in any paper bags he found and would try to find cords to bite on if he could wake us up to tell us he was hungry or thirsty.

A few months back he started to "blep" constantly. By that, I mean he had his tongue sticking out all the time. We thought it was an issue breathing, but then found he had really bad periodontal disease that was hidden from view. The vet handled what they could, removing several teeth and amputating part of his jaw, but even after weeks of recovery, he only seemed to get worse.

By early May, he was spending most of his time just sitting still drooling into whatever surface he was laying on. It was clear he was in pain, but cats can't tell you what's going on, can they? The only time he ever seemed active was at night, when we'd find him suddenly energetic and back to his old habits, rustling things in the other room, even knocking over a plate onto the ground.

One day we found he just didn't want to eat anymore. After he went a full 24 hours not touching his food, we went back to the vet and they got him into an xray, finding a mass in his throat.

The mass would be more or less inoperable. While they could conceivably remove it, it would be expensive. And what's more, the operation could leave damage that they would need to address, but would need to talk to the patient to gather info about. Back to the problem of communication.

Ultimately, we had to take him to the vet to put him to rest. Now his ashes are in a little wooden box in his old cat house, up on a high place he liked to hang out.

The first few nights were the worst. I kept expecting to hear the sounds of him pitter-pattering around the hallway, maybe the sound of a glass of water being knocked over. Sometimes I could swear I was hearing those sounds again.

Last night was the worst. I just couldn't sleep. I kept on hearing those same old indications that he was around. A cardboard box being scooted around the floor. The sounds of scratching at our door.

I thought it must be just my imagination. I nudged my wife awake, she heard it too.

My next thought was that surely one of my kids must be up out of bed playing with stuff. I got up, ready to tell whichever kid to get back to bed.

Nothing could have prepared me for what I saw. It wasn't one of my kids.

I got up just in time to see a short, thin old man rifling through a trashcan in the kitchen. I audibly gasped and it startled him. He looked at me, then ran, incredibly quickly, and escaped through the front door... locking the door behind him.

He had a key.

I have a single camera set up to record in my house. It's pointed at the sliding back door, but I can see the reflection of the entry way in the glass, just a little. I pulled up the footage and I found places where the camera detected motion and recorded, but I couldn't see what had triggered it. I had written these incidents off, but now I realize that the motion they saw was a small bit of reflection from the light outside my apartment spilling in as this man walked in and out almost every single night. For as far back as the recordings went.

Suddenly it hit me that I had various unexplained disappearances of household groceries for the past year. A can of corn here. A loaf of bread there.

This man had been entering my place with a key he had somehow acquired, wandering my home, where my kids sleep, and had been stealing food. Never anything valuable. Not my xbox. Not my laptop or tablet. Just food.

And all this time, I had assumed all the sounds I heard at night were my cat, running around and playing. All those times my cat woke me up meowing, and I would tell him to shut up, before eventually waking up cursing. All those times that he had food in his bowl, water in his dish, but was still meowing his head off.

I had assumed he was just an asshole of a cat. But cats can't tell you what's going on, can they?
