This won't make any sense until you've read [my first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ky68d7/gamesmanship/), but I'll pick right back up where I left off. Sorry for the abrupt ending—I had to get some rest. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

I took the dice, cringing at how they left my hands streaked in blood as I shook them. I won't lie, even after what happened to Trev, I still considered using that trick shuffle. But, thank God, I decided against it. I rolled a 4 and a 1 and drew the corresponding card, still trying to get my breath back. I couldn't look to my right, couldn't look at Trev's slumped-over frame.

"*Whose money did you steal?*" I read out, then squinted in confusion at the card. As far as I knew, I hadn't stolen any money from anyone, let alone the people in the room. I opened my mouth to object, but Sophie cut in first.

"Don't lie, Landon," she urged.

My mind was racing. In a panic, not knowing if there was some sort of timer, I guessed.

"Prakash?"

Dread hung heavy in the air as I moved my apple token and clenched my hands into fists, waiting—but nothing happened. We let out a collective sigh of relief, then Prakash turned around to face me.

"You stole my money, man?"

"I don't," I gasped, clutching at my chest, "Jesus, that was fucking terrifying. I don't remember? Genuinely, I don't, I guess- oh."

He shook his head at me, waiting for an explanation.

"We played that game of Texas hold'em," I recalled, "It was for like, five bucks. I dealt myself pocket rockets. I'm sorry, man."

"Shit," he let out a low whistle, "It's fine, man. It's fuckin' fine."

I took a beat to compose myself, trying to stop hyperventilating, and then passed him the dice. He answered his question; I don't even remember what it was anymore. The next answer I remember was Sophie's.

"*Who do you find least attractive in this room*?" she read out.

After a short pause, she said, almost under her breath, "Lila."

We had agreed not to take anything personally after my turn. We had to play this game, for whatever reason, and we all just wanted to make it out alive, even if that meant with hurt feelings. So we all just grimaced to ourselves as Sophie handed the dice to Lila, not being able to look her in the eye, when another piercing scream rang out.

This time, it was Sophie's scream. I wish I could tell you how whoever- whatever- was orchestrating this game chose what the consequences were, but I can't. Maybe they were arbitrary. Maybe Trev's hand served as a warning, since it was the first one.

But Sophie's hand wasn't ripped off. There was no warning. One second she had her hand extended toward Lila, dice resting in her palm, and the next, the inside of her head was no longer on the inside.

Lila started sobbing again. Beside me, Prakash was also losing it.

"Why, why, why," he kept repeating, over and over again, "Why, why, why?"

At the time, I had no idea how Sophie had lied, or if she had, why she would have. It was only much later that I realized the question never specified if the person in the room had to be *alive*.

Trev. Trev was still *in the room*, even if a decent amount of him was coating the walls. I laughed for a full thirty minutes straight when I realized that. I had to be sedated, if I recall. But here I am, getting ahead of myself again.

Eventually, Lila played her turn, though it took a decent amount of coaxing from Carmen. I felt for Lila, the only one who was bookended by two dead bodies, one of her friend and one of her unrequited crush, though that was of no fault of her own.

We managed a few rounds without any more deaths, though the atmosphere was no less tense. It was as if time had stopped, and maybe it had, for all we knew. Despite the noise of our repeated screams, Andre had yet to emerge from his room. No one from campus PD had come to check on us or follow up on a noise complaint. It was impossible to tell if time was passing from the inky-black night sky outside.

The questions were getting harder, as advertised. They were also getting even more specific, engineered precisely to make us confess things that it somehow already knew. I fessed up to fantasizing about Carmen's breasts. Carmen admitted that she had let Lila's cat, who I had learned earlier had been tragically hit by a car, out by accident.

As most of our tokens approached the mid-point of the board, we were all extremely upset with at least one person at the table.

It was Prakash's turn again.

"*Where were you the night of June 17th, 2022, from the hours of 9 to 10pm?"*

He trailed off, breath catching in his throat. I looked around the table, catching Lila's similarly confused gaze.

"What is that, summer before freshman- no, sophomore year?" I mused, trying to make sense of the queston.

Lila nodded. "Yeah, I think so, but that's- that's so specific. I have no idea what I was doing that night."

"Yeah, that's.... that's not fair!" I shouted to whoever was listening, shaking the sides of my chair, "How can you expect him to remember something that happened almost three fucking years ago?!"

No response. It was then that I caught Carmen's eye, saw the look of abject horror and hurt plastered all over her face. At that same moment, I realized that Prakash, who always had something to say, had fallen conspicuously silent.

"Prakash," Carmen said, voice quivering, "Where were you that night?"

"What the fuck happened that night?" I asked, feeling woefully out of the loop. I was struck with a mounting sense of dread. There was something bad happening, bad outside of the context of the game and even worse within it, and the knowledge that I had absolutely no idea what was going on was bone-chilling.

Prakash's head was hanging down, black curls covering his eyes. 

"Please just answer, man," I pleaded with him, but he just shook his head. I felt so helpless in that moment. It was like watching a horror movie and begging for the characters to not enter the dark, mysterious room, even though you had a sinking feeling they were going to go in anyway. Just like those characters, it didn't seem like Prakash could hear me.

"Prakash..." Carmen was crying now, too. Her voice hitched into a sob.

"I was," Prakash started, "I was... I was at home."

Carmen closed her eyes before blood and viscera could get into them. Lila and I weren't so lucky.

Later, I'd look up that date and learn that Peter, Carmen's younger brother, had died that night in a one-vehicle car crash. He had driven his parents' car into a tree. He had been intoxicated, but he was only 15 at the time and his parents swore up and down that they had no idea who had given him the alcohol. Peter was attending the same high school Carmen attended, the same highschool where Carmen and Prakash met, where they graduated together before committing to the same state school.

The police had thought that, because of the way the branches had gone into the car, there had been someone in the passenger seat. Carmen had been at a sleepaway camp at the time of the crash, so they knew it couldn't have been her, but they never did find out who that passenger was. In the news article I found about the crash, the authorities had issued a call for any information surrounding the accident, because apparently, Peter hadn't died on impact.

He had stayed suffering in that car, which according to the GPS, had crashed at 9:03pm, for hours. Waiting. Hoping for a rescue that never came.

I know I'm jumping around a lot. I'm sorry. It's hard to keep everything straight. I should get some more rest, come back with a clear head.

But, before I go, I just want to say— I know that there's a large part of me that just doesn't want to believe that Prakash would do something like that to anyone, much less a kid, much less his best friend's kid brother. *Especially* now that he's gone, it just feels like such a desecration of him. It's such a departure from the friend I knew that I think my brain just can't piece it together. But I also can't think of any other reason why he would lie unless that was true, and that terrifies me.
