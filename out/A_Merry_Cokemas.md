So, my girlfriend and I went skiing for Christmas, and something seriously messed up happened. We rented this little cabin up in the mountains—total getaway vibe. Everything was fine until I noticed this dude in a full-on Santa suit skiing behind us. At first, I thought it was funny, like, sure, people get into the holiday spirit, right? But this guy kept following us. Not close enough to be weird, but always... there. Watching. Red suit, alone, like he had nothing better to do.

We tried to shake it off, thinking maybe it was a coincidence, but every time we moved to a different slope or trail, he was there, always hanging back, keeping his distance. I even pointed him out to my girlfriend a few times. She laughed it off, but I could tell it was getting to her too.

Fast forward to that night. We’re back at the cabin, totally wiped from the day, and decided to sleep by the fireplace. It was one of those cozy setups—small place, just the two of us. I’m drifting off when I hear something on the roof. I mean, it’s an old cabin, so creaks and stuff aren’t uncommon, but these were *heavy* footsteps. Like, someone walking up there.

Before I can even react, there’s this loud thud from the chimney, and something drops down. It’s a freaking duffel bag. Black. Covered in soot. And then, boom—this white powder explodes out of it, like it’s snowing *inside* the cabin. Except it’s not snow. It’s coke. A lot of coke. My girlfriend freaks out, I’m coughing and choking, and then we’re both... high. I don’t even know how it happened, but everything’s spinning, and then we hear banging on the window.

Santa. That same guy from the slopes, face pressed against the glass, eyes wild, grinning like a psycho. He starts screaming “Merry Christmas!” and slamming the glass. We were so out of it, just standing there, watching him, until he ran off into the snow. I saw him get into a sleigh—yes, a sleigh—barely lit up, with reindeer, and fly off.

We thought we were hallucinating from the coke, but the next morning, the bag was still there. We didn’t know what to do, so we stashed it under the floorboards, figuring we’d deal with it later. But here’s the thing—we *used* some of it before that. At first, we thought maybe it was some twisted joke, like, “Merry Christmas, here’s your present motherfuckers,” right? But now we’re starting to realize how deep we’ve messed up.

Since then, the news has reported about a guy dressed as Santa, involved in some major drug trafficking, and he's still on the run. It hit us hard. That bag? It wasn’t a prank. And now, we’ve used enough of it that if we go to the cops, we’re screwed. If we do nothing, we’re sitting ducks waiting for like, Santa mafia(?!) to return.

I’m terrified every time I hear a car pull up or someone walking by. We’re stuck here for another week, and I can’t stop thinking—what happens when he realizes some of it’s gone? There’s no going back.

We’re laying low, but if he shows up before we leave and realizes we dipped into his stash... I guess we’re at the top of his ”naughty list.”
