This happened 3 years ago when I was still in high school. My school is very far from my home so I ride the train. Sometimes a friend would go with me. We would usually encounter our classmate along with her boyfriend in front of us, we never really spoke with each other. But we know it's them because of their size differences, HER HEIGHT. Our classmate is a girl and she's very small, smaller than the average small height. I think she's around my chest level and I'm just around 156cm. She also has curly hair, which is rare in my country. Her boyfriend is tall and big. My friend and I would always try and walk past them on the way to the train. We never greet them because we're too shy.


One day, we had a group project over at another classmates' house. That girl classmate was also invited. We started getting to know each other and she told me that she thinks I'm cool and wants to be friends with me and that she would always see me entering the school at around 9am but she's too shy to approach me....... I went silent... Because as far as I know I'm always late for class. I would be at the school at around 12pm-12:30pm, NEVER too early. I told her that it wasn't me. But she told me that it REALLY was me, she told me the details of how I would get off my ride and cross the highway running like a penguin. Well, she's actually right, everyone tells me that I ran like a penguin when I have a backpack on me. She continued explaining-- I wore a blue hoodie, black/yellow addidas bag and a huge black headphones so it would be easy to identify me. Our country has a hot weather and no one would wear stupid hoodies during daytime except me. 


I then told her about how my friend and I also saw her and her boyfriend every after school on the way to the train station. She looked at me weirdly and told us that it wasn't them and that they actually go the opposite way.  They don't have anything to do on the way to the train station..... CHILLS.... I defended what I said and told her that it's them. I know that her boyfriend wears white glasses and that's also rare because I haven't seen a guy at our school who wears the same glasses.

We started exchanging weird looks and I asked her if she's messing with me. She then texted her boyfriend and asked him about how she would always point out to him that she sees me during 9am entering the school grounds. She asked her boyfriend what I wore and he explained clearly--- blue hoodie, black headphone, black/yellow bag, running like a penguin across the street...


So... They would see me at 9am entering the school and I would see them walking to the train station at around 7pm.... It doesn't make sense. After our conversation happened, "those" never showed up again. 


I still think about that incident everyday after years. It was a bizarre situation. It continued to happen until we noticed it. It just stopped after we found out about it. I've been with different classmates on the way to the train so I have other witnesses. We never know why it happened. Was it dopple gangers???? What would've happened to us if we approached "those" things??? I think we were lucky that we did not approach them. Who knows what those things are.
