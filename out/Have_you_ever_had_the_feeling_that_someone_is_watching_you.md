Have you ever had the feeling that someone is watching you?
I'm sure you have.

It’s an unsettling feeling. You know there’s something—or, even worse, someone—that’s it’s watching you, not knowing what it might do to you or when.
That’s exactly what I’m feeling too.

It all started on a Monday. I left work around 5:30 p.m. I wasn’t feeling up to it. I wasn’t in a very good mood; I was stressed from the heavy workload, so I decided to take a walk a while in the park that’s two blocks from my house.

Sometimes I like to walk for an hour to clear my head. It also serves as some exercise, since I spend almost all day sitting in front of the computer. That
That routine has turned me into a sedentary, grumpy person with little energy.

One of my office colleagues, Shaun—whom I hardly ever talk to—was the one who he recommended that I establish a walking routine at least three times a week after work.
I don’t know much about him. His desk is two rows beyond mine, and he’s been working there for five years, but I’ve always found him to be a strange guy.

He rarely talks to anyone. During lunchtime, he’s alone. He never joins in.
When we go play pool or to gatherings at one of our homes. It seems he takes that “there are no friends at work” thing very seriously.
That’s why I found it unusual that he came up to talk to me.

Although there was something even weirder about him.
One day, during my shift, I went to the bathroom on the ground floor. There’s almost no light there, Just three empty offices and a silent hallway. When I opened the bathroom door, I was startled to see him: Shaun was standing in front of the mirror, completely motionless, with the light off.
At that moment, he turned around, flipped the switch, and pretended to comb his hair.
I left immediately, confused by that strange scene.

That Monday, already at the park, I parked next to the sidewalk, put on my sneakers, and I started stretching to warm up. The sun was still beating down hard; it was summer, so that the sky was slow to darken. Teenagers, young people, and adults arrived with their children to spend the afternoon. I started walking normally, trying to clear my thoughts.

Nothing seemed out of place... until I reached the section of the park surrounded by enormous trees, where sunlight barely filtered thru.
Suddenly, I realized I was the only one walking along that stretch. Something felt off. Something felt out of place. I could have sworn I saw someone behind me out of the corner of my eye a second ago, but when I stopped and turned around, there was no one there. The trees cast shadows across my path. The noise of the cars died down. The footsteps and laughter of the children faded away. A thick calm settled over the atmosphere was thick, a peace you could cut with a knife.

An invisible heaviness began to settle on my skin. No one was coming. No one was laughing. The Branches were creaking. My senses were on high alert, waiting for something to jump out at me. Something could jump into my face at any moment.

I stood still for a minute. When nothing happened, I resumed walking with quick steps accelerated. As I left that section, people reappeared in the distance; the hustle and bustle.
The noise grew, the sunset was dying, but the light calmed me. I sketched a faint smile... until I heard a rustling behind me.

I turned around on instinct, only to see a pile of leaves floating near the ground, as if something—or someone—had emerged from them and sped away.

When I got to my car, it was already dark. I was exhausted, eager to get home. But as I drew closer, I once again felt that heaviness from afar. The vertigo, the darkness, the movement of the treetops... it all made me think:
What the hell is going on now?

I turned around once more. 
Nothing.

I thot I was losing my mind, that it was all just stress. Even so, I hurried, started the car, and drove off.

The next morning I had already forgotten the incident. 
Tuesday. 

The same old routine.

However, just as I was about to get into my car, a blow to the chest stopped me:
there was a dirt-stained hand on the driver’s side mirror that made my blood run cold.
I didn’t want to let fear get the better of me. I tried to think logically: it was surely a
Some neighbor’s prank. I forced myself to believe it.
And I went to work.

The day went by normally until 4:57 p.m.
With my shift almost over, I went down to the bathroom. Two coworkers were waiting at the door, ready to leave when five o’clock struck. When I returned to my desk to gather my things, I saw it: three dry leaves on my keyboard.
I moved closer. There was no message, just leaves with some dirt staining the keys.
I looked up, ready to confront the prankster who had played the joke on me,
But something stopped me. An invisible force paralyzed my throat. 
I couldn’t say anything.
I just picked up the papers and threw them in the trash.
That feeling came back, if only for an instant.

When I got to my car, I was afraid I’d find another scratch, but there was nothing. I let out a laugh.
Nervously, I tried to laugh at my own fear.
The rest of the day passed without incident.

Wednesday.

I was more alert, more withdrawn. I felt like a fool under the curious gazes of my co-workers, but I couldn’t help it. That nite I had to walk in the park again.
park.

I arrived shortly after six. The air was warm and still; I thot everything what had come before had been an exaggeration of my mind.
I did four full laps, enjoying the freedom, the wind, and the sun slowly setting. I still had energy for one more.

Then I came back to the path of the great trees.
The air suddenly grew cold. A shiver ran down my spine. I slowed down walking cautiously so as not to trip.
And I felt it again.
That look.
That presence.
This time I didn’t stop.
I kept walking, refusing to look back... but when I stepped out of the shadows and the headlights’ light enveloped me, and I couldn’t resist.
I turned around.

In the distance, among the shadows, a dark figure was watching me.
Standing. Motionless.
His face was expressionless.
I opened my eyes wide.
“Fuck it,” I whispered.
And I ran home.

Hours later, trapped in my thoughts, panic gripped me again.
I locked the doors and windows. I was determined to call the police if necessary.
I spent the nite on watch, waiting to see that figure again.
Sleep began to overcome me, but before going to bed I went over to close the
the blind... and I saw her.

There it was.
That thing was standing outside my door, motionless, just like in the park.
My heart raced. My breathing became choppy. I closed the blinds trying to calm myself.
When I mustered the courage to look again, the figure had moved closer.
Closer.
Now I could make out its shape.

My mind went blank.
That mysterious man seemed familiar to me.
I ran to the door, looked thru the peephole...

And there it was.
Standing. Motionless.
Shaun.
He smiled slightly.

But that wasn’t what scared me the most.
What completely froze me was the glint of the huge knife he was holding in his hand.
