"Hear what?" I asked. Lainne in the other hand told me the most humorless, dull story I've ever heard. "The Iphone alarm! Don't you hear that?" an Iphone alarm? Seriously? I'm not a kindergartner. "What Iphone alarm? I don't hear anything." I said, breezily. "Here. Take this, Read this and Run away onto this direction before it's too late." She gave me a notebook page and ran away from the opposite direction. What's this note? Why do I have to run to the north? My house is near anyways so I went there instead rather than heading northern.

I was infront of my door until I heard a buzzing sound from far away. "Buzz buzz. . . Buzz Buzz. . ." It kept repeating. I went inside my house and head onto my room to rest; What was happening? Why do I suddenly hear faint alarm noises? I remembered the note Lainne gave me before she ran. I might aswell read it, I folded up the paper and read the first paragraph. "Read this in a room with no windows or second entrance. PLEASE." The last word, being in bond letters gave me chills. I headed to my bathroom until I heard more buzzing noises. "Buzz buzz. . . Buzz buzz. . ." It sounded more closer yet so far, so I brushed it off. I went inside my bathroom and sat on my tub. The note had a small list of rules attached to it and a letter that reads "Apologies for my bad english, I'm a french man whose been targetted by those we shouldn't speak. I've studied and learned my tricks with these things so I made a list on things you should do to survive them. I hope this helps" signed with his signature on the bottom "Good luck, Made By Leonardo" The buzzing started again, but it wasn't the only thing I heard. Buzzing noises continued with some faint iphone alarm sounds; "What the f*k" I exclaimed. I read it whilst I had the time, the noises we're faint and gone anyways so It won't bother me. 

1) Listen for Vibrating or Buzzing sounds
It means they're nearby

Who's nearby? Buzzing? I've been hearing that.

2) Beware, They can take the voices of others but not apperance.
But it'll be much deeper than their usual pitch.

3) Iphone alarms are annoying, they know so.
They know that we are annoyed by the alarm so we have this human urge to stop the alarm. DON'T. It's not an actual phone making those sounds, They're much closer now.

Closer? What is that supposed to mean?
I heard a knock on my door. "Kristopher? are you there?" I kept quiet. It's not Lainne, her voice is more angelic and sweeter while this sounds like a trumpet horn that had a bun stuck inside of it. "Oh cmon, you really thought that note was true? You're too gullible" I was raged, but I wanted to survive whatever Leonardo was indicating about. "Cmon Please open the do...." she stopped. it stopped. did I survive? F*k yeah! I was about to open the door until I heard the buzzing iphone sound. "Buzz buzz. . ." That Noise is so annoying. My ears are tired, My brain is juiced out. I want to stop the phone so bad. Please save me, I can't take this anymore. I noticed the back of the paper had a note, did Mr Leonardo forget to add something? No, He did not. It was intended. "I hope you listened to the no other entrance policy, now you have no where to run. :)"
