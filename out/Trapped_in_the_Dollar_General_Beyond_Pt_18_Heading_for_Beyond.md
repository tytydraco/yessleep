Pt 17- https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/17vmtt0/trapped_in_the_dollar_general_beyond_pt_17_escape/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3


I'd like to say that today I got the closest I had ever been to a Miasma, but for you guys who have been reading this for a while you know I've been way closer.


I was nervous as I saw the thing come sliding out of the ceiling, looking around as if confused by the lack of prey.


We were all hiding in the breakroom, Gale, Celene, Buddy, and me, and just watching as it stomped around and looked for us.


"Get ready," Gale whispered, hitting a button and tossing the collection of lights and duct tape. 


Gale had rigged them all together somehow and they glared out at the Miasma as it roared and turned to try and find the source of its discomfort. We were all strapped with reflectors and little blinking bike lights, including Buddy who clicked and jounced with all the lights he wore. We were hoping it would protect us from the creature, but there was only one way to really test the theory.


When it turned to look for us, we all charged, brandishing our lights and hoping for the best. 


We had planned to run if it appeared to be going badly, and when the thing turned and took a swipe at Gale, I prepared to flee. We could always go get him again if it decided to snatch him, but it appeared our luck was on the upswing. When the Miasma reached for him, his hand slipped right through him and I saw Gale shudder as it passed harmlessly out of the older man again.


The Miasma seemed as confused as we were, but it couldn't seem to find a hold on any of us, not even Buddy.


"Okay, time for the real test," Gale said, turning off his lights and he grabbed a blanket off the floor.


Pulling it around himself, he blotted out the lights attached to him and stood by as he waited for the coming swipe.


The Miasma lunged at him, grabbing him with shadowy fingers as it prepared to slip back into the ceiling.


"Do it!" Gale yelled, sounding the least bit concerned now that the time had come.


Celene and I swiveled the beams of our lights and suddenly Gale dropped back to his feet.


The hand that had gripped him lost purchase, the fingers losing density, and Gale was free once more.


We laughed and danced around it, shining our flashlights and shaking our blinkers. We had done it! We had won a real victory over this boogyman who had haunted all of us in different ways, and it felt good to show the monster in our closet that we were no longer afraid of it. 


Then the Miasma loosed a loud roar that shook the rafters and quenched some of our excitement. Suddenly there was a lot of weird movement from the darkness overhead. The ceiling was mostly gone up there, and the shadows were moving like an old man trying to catch his breath. There would be no rescue attempt if more than one Miasma came out to get us, and I grabbed ahold of Buddy's harness as we made our escape. 


They had started taking shape as we stepped into the bathroom, and we were all glad when we stepped out into the fluorescent lights of Celene's safe house.


"Excellent!" Celene said, "Now we know that we can fight them."


"If," Gale said ominously, "It works wherever it is we're going."


Celene gave him a stony look, huffing loudly, "I can't think of any reason why we couldn't. Must you always be so gloomy?"


Gale gave her a look, but I thought it might have been more sad than angry, "You haven't been to the ceiling. Things work differently there. If this end of the line is anything like that, then we could be in for some trouble."


"Then let's go there," Celene said, "We tested Jasper's theory and it worked. Let's go see what we're dealing with now that we have a weapon."


Gale opened his mouth to say something but closed it again when he realized there was nothing to say.


Celene was right. We could escape right now, so why were we hesitating? I wondered if maybe it was hesitancy to throw ourselves in without thought, but if we could be back in the real world, then why not jump? The worst that could happen is that we failed, and I was no longer sure that was such a bad thing. The thought of just existing here for the next however many years sounded like hell to me. What would happen if I stepped out like Celene and Gale were preparing to do, to find that over twenty years had passed? What if I stepped out to find that fifty or even a hundred years had passed? 


Could I reintegrate into such a world?


I didn't want to find out. 


"We need to be ready when we come there," Gale said, "We need to save our trick until it's absolutely necessary. I've got an idea," he said, walking over to the shelves as he looked for something only he was aware of, "If we cover our lights then we can move relatively unseen, I think. Imagine their surprise when we take our cover off and bombard them in the hated lights."


He tossed a throw blanket at me, giving Celene another, and told me to secure a third around Buddy.


"He might need some help when the time comes. You'll need to help him, but it should keep him safe. We might find them looking for us before we get to where we're going anyway. If they know we can fight them, they might try to harvest us before we can escape."


He tied his own blanket on like a cloak, looking like some kind of low-budget Lord of the Rings character.


"Get whatever you're taking with you and let's get to it, then."


"Do we know where the store is that he's talking about in his journal?" I asked, looking at Celene for some clarification.


"No," she said, "but I think I can get us fairly close. I know the store he's talking about before that, the one that has snow in it, and I think if we travel from there we can find the place he's talking about. That store was as far as I'd ever gone, but it should get us going in the right direction."


So, we packed a few things, food, fresh clothes, and some weapons to go along with our lights, and stepped towards the bathroom for what I hoped would be the last time. I had found a harness for Buddy that made me think of the ones worn by service dogs, and I hoped that the handle on it would help me hold him if he got spooked. Celene reached for my free hand, taking Gales with her other, and before she stepped through, she looked back as if to take in her home away from home one last time. 


The store had been her sanctuary and her respite for a long time, and though she hoped to never see it again, she also looked thankful for the comfort it had brought her.


We gave her the moment she needed, and when she turned back to the door, I could already see the snow building up on the other side.


We stepped into a winter wonderland and I smiled as the wet flakes hit my face.


Everything here was made of snow, and from the shelves to the products, to the workforce, everything was nothing but glistening white. The Hermit hadn't been wrong, and I could see several androgenous-looking snowmen with red vests that had turned to look in our direction. The effect wasn't altogether inviting, and their dead-eyed faces reminded me of a horror movie I had seen as a kid about a creepy-looking snowman that hadn't been terribly friendly.


Buddy clearly didn't share my trepidation, and I had to hold his harness to keep him from running off to play in the snow.


We stepped through again, and this time we were in a perfectly normal-looking store set for St Patrick's Day.


We traveled for a while, going through about twenty stores before stopping to take a break. We found Jasper's underwater store, a store made of concrete, and the store where Celene had found Jasper's prescription back when he was still semi-sane. We found a store covered in thick fog, a store that was a Pet Supermarket, and then we finally came to rest in a store that resembled a park.


Buddy facilitated our rest more than any desire to stop, and as he ran and sniffed, we took a seat and talked.


"How many more do think before we get there?"


"Who's to say?" Celene said, "Jasper wasn't very clear on how far he traveled before he got there, and really just named stores he saw at random."


Gale had his knees up against his chest, and he looked broody. This was abnormal for him, Gale usually being so gregarious, and Celene slid over next to him and put an arm around him as she leaned against him. He smiled, clearly appreciating the closeness, but some of that melancholy persisted. 


I rolled a diet soda at him and another to Celene, and as it bumped his foot he smiled and reached down to get it.


"What's the first thing you'll do when you get back?" I asked, trying to steer the conversation towards something more upbeat.


"I want a nice long bath in a real tub," Celene said, "If I never take another camp shower again in my life, it will be too soon."


"I want to eat food that I don't heat from a can or take out of a package," I said wistfully, "There's a Japanese steak house down the road from my apartment, and I feel like I could easily spend the rest of my savings in there eating sushi and eel and still not get enough."


That got a laugh from both of them, but only until Gale really thought about the question.


"I don't know," he said after a long moment of thought, " You told me that you stepped into that bathroom in 2023." he said, turning to me as if accusing me, "and if that's true, it means that twenty-five years have passed since Celene and I came in through the bathroom. When I stepped out of reality, Bill Clinton was in his second term. The internet was still kind of a fad, and the cell phone I had was about the same size as my wallet. I've seen that thing you plink around on when you have downtime, and by the sound of it, that thing is more powerful than any computer I've ever seen. I still had five payments left on the Camry I left sitting in the parking lot. By now, it's probably been towed along with your little Gemini, Celene. My apartment has long since been leased, and my bank account and my house likely went to my ex-wife when I was declared dead after being missing for so long. Let's face it, kid. While you might have something to go back to, Celene and I are likely looking at bleak prospects."


I wanted to refute this, but I really couldn't find any evidence to the contrary. How did I know that twenty-five years hadn't passed while I was in here too? I could be stepping out into the future as well, like Fry stepping out of his cryotube. The thought of all three of us, four, I guess, if you counted Buddy, stepping into an uncertain future was more than a little scary, but I knew it was the right choice.


"What's the alternative, then?" I asked Gale seriously, "Stay in here and wait to be scooped up by a Miasma? Live every day wondering if you're going to wake up being fused into a crystal? I can't live like that, Gale, and I don't think you can either." 


He started to get angry, you could see it on his face, but he settled as the weight of the statement settled over him.


"As to where you'll stay," I said, "All of you will stay with me for as long as you need to. You'll have to sleep on the floor, most likely, but I can guarantee there is less of a chance that a shadow monster will come out of the ceiling and try to get you."


Gale laughed, but he looked like he might be trying not to cry as well.


Some of the old Gale, the one who had rescued me from the Miasma and taught me how to navigate the landscape of the Dollar General Beyond, came out in that laugh and I was glad to see some of the darkness that had surrounded him since I'd pulled him out of the ceiling dissipate.


"You know, until you came into my life, I always just assumed I would die in here. I never wanted to believe that escape was an option. How would one escape from a place like this anyway? Now it almost feels like there might be something out there for an old guy like me."


He raised his can in salute and Celene did the same, "Here's to you, Alphabet Man. No matter what happens, I'm glad I found your message on my bulletin board."


We all drank deeply, and as Buddy came back for pets, Gale got back on his feet and brushed the grass from his pants.


"Let's get this over with then," he said, taking Celene's hand and smiling at her, "None of us are getting any younger."


We stepped out into a perfectly normal Dollar General Store.


Perfectly normal except for the strange language that everything was written in.


Gale nodded, "This is it, then. No matter what happens in there, I'm glad I don't have to do this alone."


Celene gripped my hand tightly, "I hope your couch is comfy, because I think I could sleep for a week straight."


"There's only one way you'll ever find out," I said, grinning as we took traveled one final time.


We all grasped hands tightly and stepped into the dark space that we hoped would take us home.
