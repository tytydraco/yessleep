So I'm gonna recount everything I can and post it here since quite frankly I'm not a praying kind of bloke and I used to read the weirdest stuff on here.

First things first, I have absolutely no idea how I got where I was when this recounting starts. I am telling you as much as I remember. I have my memories of my life, I'm not some full amnesiac. Nothing special about me except perhaps I'm a little unluckier than most. My friends, my girlfriend and I like to joke that I'm cursed. I grew up near Pendle, a big witchy spot in the north of England. I once scared some birds in an old woman's garden while on a paper round, and that's what I tell people the 'root of the curse' is, but honestly, I'm just unlucky. It's like coincidences just gravitate towards me.

Anyway, doesn't matter. Point is, last memory I have before what I'm about to recount is meeting a strange man on my way home from a shitty job interview. I knew immediately that they weren't really hiring from the way they were so very friendly and open about things every employer tries to be coy about to new starters. I walked away angry, headed for the nearest bus stop when it started raining suddenly and heavily. I dived into a tiny shop and bought a Snickers bar as a gesture of thanks for being able to hide from the sudden downpour. I remember the owner being very friendly. He was from Kurdistan, and we joked about British summer.

When the rain stopped and I saw an opportunity, I started speed walking to the bus stop, but unfortunately I slipped and got my jeans soaked in a puddle. I remember the fury I felt, just pure frustration and a desire to tear the very concept of 'puddle' into pieces. I'm autistic, and I have an adrenaline problem that I'm medicated for. I meditate often, but sometimes the stupidest things can make me so angry. Unfortunately, there are far too many things in the world for which I can actually justify getting adrenaline-surging anger, just read the news. Hence the medication.

When I stood up and let out a much needed groan to stop myself from screaming at the pure absurdity of how my life was a twisted mix of bland white bread and rancid manure, I was face to face with a man. He looked a little too much like me, not in genetics but in general aura. His 'interview-ready' button shirt and trousers were at least one size too big, puffing out where the shirt was tucked in. He had a book in his hands.

"Hey, I think you might be the one I've been looking for," he said to me. I remember turning around thinking he was talking to someone behind me, but when I turned back his eyes were locked on mine.

"Mate, not a good time," I told him. I'm usually pretty generous and willing to hear people out, but right then I just wanted to be home with my cats.

He didn't reply. He just shoved the book into my chest, forcing me to grab it, and started walking away rapidly. I remember seeing a tag bouncing about at the back of the shirt, like he'd forgotten to cut it off or stolen it in a hurry.

I've got two English degrees. Useless, I know. Even so, I was intrigued enough to look at the book, but that's all I remember. Opening the book and then lights out. And so we come to where I found myself next. The real fucking weird shit.

I awoke to the harsh sound of a heavy-duty flashlight tapping against the car window. I blinked quickly, rubbing my eyes so I might quicker assess the disturbance and figure out what was going on.

"Fella, mind telling me what you're doing out here?," came the voice of the police officer at the window, thick with an accent I knew but couldn't place. He gestured to the space between the car I was in and a large pickup nearby.

"I'm sorry officer. Must have stopped for a kip and let it go on too long."

Of course, I had no idea where I was. I don't even drive.

"Well I think you picked an unfortunate time to visit us. Wait here please." He began to walk over to the pickup while talking quietly to himself.

I looked around the vehicle I'd woken up in. It appeared as if I'd also been living in it for some time. Assorted canned foods, clothing and blankets.

The officer came back. I took my first real look at him then. His uniform, despite looking legitimate, was dishevelled and in some places even bloody. I shivered a little.

"If there's nothing else sir, I can just be on my way," I said gently.

"Oh really? You wanna drive off?" He chuckled, and it made my skin crawl. I noticed then that he had a holster on his thigh. In it sat a pistol. This wasn't an ordinary police officer.

I wasn't going to wait to die. I grabbed the keys and turned... and nothing happened.

"Now that... is weird." The officer leaned down, and his face had a look of genuine concerned responsibility on it, the look someone gives a confused child. "Did you drive this car here sir?"

I looked him dead in the eye. He seemed truly inquisitive and suddenly much less threatening, so I admitted it.

"I have no idea how I got here."

"Right. Okay. That's okay."

He opened the door slowly. "You should come get in my truck. I can take you and your stuff somewhere safe. This car ain't no use to you now."

Without other options, I got out of the car and began to assist as he helped himself to what were presumably my belongings and loaded them onto the tarp-covered flatbed of his truck. 

When we were done, I hopped in the cab with him. He started up the car and picked up a portable radio from the dashboard.

"Hey Tommy, you there? Over."

A young voice with the same accent fizzled back over. "Hear ya loud and crackly, sir. What's the report? Over."

"I found the car they told us about. Full of food and shit, but there's somethin' else." He took a long pause. "The man is alive. Gonna bring him back, get him set up with us. Over."

"Damn Dom, no joke? Over."

"No joke. Heading back now. Call everyone in, I wanna lock up early tonight. Over."

"Sure thing boss. Out."

The drive from where I'd woken up was mostly silent, and I simply watched the red sunset through the driver side window. It was gorgeous, like a painting of an agrarian idyll landscape rather than the real thing. There were fields and hills for miles, with smatterings of trees and bushlands.

Dom kept looking at the sun out of the corner of his eye, like it was a dog he didn't want to startle into bolting too soon.

After a while, we pulled up to a service station. It had all the amenities you could need, almost like a small town condensed into a courtyard. There was a surprisingly tall hotel in the far corner of the areas. Dom waved some guys over to grab my stuff and told them to keep it where I was going to be sleeping for now. They made faces but listened to him. They began lugging my things into the hotel, and I followed.

We made our way without delay up to the top floor. On the landing below, I got my first real sign of just how weird things were.

The whole landing had been reinforced into a steel wall, where pieces of cars and fridges and any other sturdy metal had been welded together in a thick, completely impenetrable barrier. The only opening was at the bottom, and we had to pass our things through and then crouch beneath to get by. When we were in, a huge piece of iron was placed over the gap, and I looked around at the ragged group gathered at the room doors before me. 

"Follow me," said Dom, leading me to an unoccupied room. "This is you. Get settled in. Starting curfew now. I know you were asleep before, but if you don't know what's going on, which I know you don't, heed ny advice and heed it well. Sleep through the night. Don't go near the windows. Plug your ears if you can. And do not make any noise. That last part ain't advice." He fingered a large knife on his belt that I hadn't noticed before. "Do we understand each other?"

"Completely." I nodded emphatically. He seemed a kind man, but clearly he was dealing with a mess. "May I just ask, how is it you knew my car wouldn't work?"

He frowned. "You really don't have a clue do you? Jammy bastard." He pointed to the bed. "Sleep. We can have a discussion in the morning."

I wasn't sleepy at all, and I spent a while looking through 'my' stuff, but half of the boxes were combination locked and the other half were key locked. After a while trying combinations I'd used in the past and searching for keys, I looked out of the window absent mindedly for the first time, out to the courtyard.

There were hundreds, thousands, of people stood out there, lit by the light of the moon. They all were stood still, staring at the hotel. I'm not sure if I imagined it, but for the second I glanced, it seemed like there were looking specifically at my room.

I nearly fell over backwards but caught myself just in time. I ended up laying in bed with my ears plugged by tissues, unable to sleep.

Not long after the first rays of light started coming through the window, Dom knocked on my door. I went out to greet him groggily.

"So, did you look?" He asked me without preamble.

I nodded. "Thought you might. Wanted to see the truth of your reaction, and I see it."

"Who are they? Why were they all staring at me?"

"I'm sorry, they stared at you? They were looking at the hotel?"

I nodded. "Who are they?" I asked again.

"We don't know." Dom was looking as concerned as he did when I tried to start the car. "Without them, though, we'd never have found you."

"What on earth does that mean?" I asked him. A small measure of panic made me blurt out more. "I don't even have a driver's license. I have no idea what's going on, truly." I wanted to make it clear I wasn't a part of whatever those people were doing.

Dom waved his hand. "No need to be defensive, I believe you. But they *did* lead us to you. They do that chanting you surely heard most of the time, but every so often, they'll scream. In the morning, we go to where the screams came from we usually find something. Banshees, we've been calling them."

I tried to wrap my head around it. People chanting and screaming in the night, and I just so happened to be here. I thought about my girlfriend, my cats... did they think I was missing?

"So where am I? I'd like to know, and I need to let my family know..."

Dom laughed at that. "This sort of stuff happen to you often then mate? You just wanna call your family? You think we all haven't tried that? You saw that fuckin barrier we made didn't you? You fuckin crawled under it didn't you? Are you fuckin stupid or something?"

I had to admit, he was right. Despite thinking fairly logically, I was applying rules from normal life in a situation obviously not normal.
"Well, tell me everything then," I said plainly.

Dom nodded, satisfied I'd understood his meaning. "Twelve days ago, this whole place went to utter shite. The people just started being, well weird. Then they quickly got much, much worse than weird. We tried to contact the outside, and we just get told they're 'working on it'."

"By 'this whole fuckin place', where do you mean?" I asked. 

"The moors. Dartmoor in fact. You're not that far from it, and it's basically all we can access at the moment."

I frowned. "What does that mean?"

"We can't leave. I sent an officer of mine on the road towards Plymouth. She's dead now. They got her." His voice cracked a little then. "Those things, they got her."

"You mean the people?" I asked.

"They ain't people no more. Honestly, when we heard about you, I thought it'd be best to just kill you, but if you came from outside, you might be our only hope."

"What do you mean outside? You mean outside the moor?"

Dom nodded. "There's a line, we've painted it, on the roads at least. The people in the towns and villages around here, they've changed. Maybe I'll show you later, but what you've got to know is, when you get closer to leaving, they follow you. When you cross that invisible line, they come for you. And if they decide throwing you back over it is too much trouble..." He trailed off, taking a moment to gather himself. "Anyway, you were parked right inside that line. And they screamed to let us know you were there."

"So they're helping you? They want something?"

He nodded. "That's been the theory so far. Not mine, but someone who supposedly knows about this kind of thing." I looked at him confused at how someone could be familiar with this and he raised his eyebrows in shared scepticism. "Yep, I know, but I haven't been delivered an abundance of alternatives. Also she does have a badge. Not any badge I've ever seen or heard of, but it looks official. I would know," he said with a chuckle, tapping his own badge. "She's the highest ranking person here if she's telling the truth, and we can't get outside help. Official channels, like I said, say they're 'working on it.' Unofficially..." 

He trailed off again, but I waved my hand to encourage him to finish. "Well, unofficially we're all fucking nuts. One of the men here messaged a workmate, texted him to say what was happening. Workmate messaged him back from the construction site. Which is within the invisible line. We went to check, nobody there. So either we're all on some Derren Brown shit or we're really, God's honest truth, fucked royally." He let out a long sigh, staring into the distance.

Snapping himself out of it, he began speaking and walking backwards. "I can't tarry. I'm in charge of keeping this lot in line, so we'll talk later. If you don't mind, we're gonna share out your food. Since we've taken you in and everything. If you could try and get into those boxes too, I'd be interested to know what you managed to bring over the line with you." With that, he turned away, greeting some other members of the group whom I assumed were also holing up here as he headed for the stairs.

One man in particular caught my eye. He looked like he had a fever, and when he saw me looking at him, he quickly dived into his room and slammed the door. 

"Don't mind him," came a small voice from behind me. I turned to see a youngish girl, maybe late teens, looking at me. "He's nice, just a little sick. I'm Freja." She held out a hand to me, and I shook it. "Nice to see a new face. Well, a non-chanting, non-screaming, non-creepy staring new face," she said with a smirk.

"Yeah, I bet," I replied. "I wish I knew more. The police officer seemed to hope I was here to save you all, but I really have no idea what's going on."

"That's alright," she said quietly. "You brought some food, which is definitely a boost. We only have a couple of cars that work, and they can only haul so much in one day. Apparently the Banshees get mad if you do things wrong, so they have to take their time."

"You're saying they're particular about how you gather food and supplies? Seriously?" I was so confused. "Are we sure this is some kind of horror situation and not just really, really crazy locals?"

She looked at me with a frown. "So really, really crazy locals isn't a horror situation?" I shook my head and grimaced.

"I suppose you're right. It just feels weird when you're in it, you know?"

She nodded. "Yeah, I suppose it's like being sick. It becomes the new normal so quickly, you feel like you took being healthy for granted." 

She was pretty wise for a teenager. "So how come you've ended up here?" I asked. I was wondering about her parents but didn't want to be blunt.

"I'm here with my mum. She's always leaving me at somewhere or another while she saves the world. It's really great," she said with a lashing of sarcasm. "If you have any questions, you can come and ask me. I wouldn't bother some of the other guests. Most of them are pretty petrified. One guy even threatened Dom when he suggested bringing you back here." She pondered for a moment before finishing. "Honestly I'd stay in your room until we have our group meeting tonight. Dom will vouch for you then."

With that, she walked away, and I was left with even more questions. And so I've come here, to the place where the weird meets the logical. Someone tell me what you think I should do? My gut tells me to slip away and reach an authority figure who doesn't look like they've been dragged through a rosebush, but a deeper part of my gut tells me that's the worst idea.

Please, tell me your thoughts. I'm going to try and open some of these boxes in the meantime.
