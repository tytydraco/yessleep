This log contains all incident reports, experiments, and small happenings with experiment A-1 The Eidolon Woman

&#x200B;

The experiment takes place: 

The human genome is spliced with the DNA of the Cicada, Mosquito, Jerboa, Stick bug, Leaf bug, Leafcutter ant, Army ant, one undisclosed species of forest-dwelling ant, and several undisclosed species of fungus. The subject was a 5'4", 130lb Congolese Woman, 34 years of age.

The subject was unwilling to participate, however was forced

Her DNA is then spliced with aforementioned DNA, with a serum, proved to be able to add foreign DNA to another organism, and even isolate certain traits.

The incubation period, it lasted ten months, two weeks, 6 days, 21 hours, 43 minutes, and 26 seconds.

 The incubation tube was made of soft, clear rubber for the subject to break out of.

The rabbit is eaten a day later after its blood has seeped into the nearby water source of A-1's habitat.  The water is drained and refilled. A-1 is confused by the occurrence.s morphed into that of an army ant, however with three large claws. The woman's back had contorted into a shell, which looks like a mix of leaves and twigs, X-ray examination reveals this is an extension of the rib cage. Her belly has transformed into a thin-walled hollow, later examination proves this is where food is fully digested and absorbed, leaving only inedible parts, which are then flushed out. Her brain became smaller and more animal-like, leading to more animal-like behavior. A-1 did not appear to have a conscience.

&#x200B;

A-1's Habitat includes three trees of varying sizes, two fallen logs, a field of grass, a sandy area, and a rocky shore-like area. The subject prefers to stay in the sandy and rocky shore areas.

A-1 was docile for one day until live prey was introduced via a small door into her habitat.

The subject expelled a sort of acid from the proboscis, which stunned the live prey. Prey was a trio of Hercules beetles.

Proboscis is discovered to be covered in rings of teeth on the inside. A-1 used said teeth to shred and eat the beetles alive.

After eating, A-1 became docile again.

&#x200B;

No further information was provided for one week

&#x200B;

One live rabbit, and one live chicken are introduced into the habitat. A-1 immediately shoots acid to stun. She shreds the rabbit first, then the chicken. However, she consumes the chicken first and leaves the rabbit.

Rabbit is eaten a day later after its blood has seeped into the nearby water source of A-1's habitat.  The water is drained and refilled. A-1 is confused by the occurrence.

&#x200B;

Two days after feeding, A-1 is sedated and removed from her habitat.

Habitat is reconfigured to include a large hollow log, large enough for A-1 to crawl in and out of, being about 3x  larger than A-1. A log is placed onto a very large plane of sand, about 10 meters thick to simulate a desert. Habitat is also moved to a larger room, 50 meters by 50 meters. numerous plants, rocks, and pieces of metal are set about, and a large number of rocks, twigs, fibers, bits of rope, string, and pieces of metal, some sharp, and some dull are buried under the sand at different heights. there is an irregularly shaped area, no more than 6 square meters made from salt. On the opposite side of her habitat, is a large pool of water with 2 pipes leading to and from it through the sand, to drain and refill it. Around the pool, there are two coconut trees and reeds growing in small patches.

the door is located lower than in the other room, however, is covered by numerous plants. The room has two cameras, as opposed to the previous one. The room has a speaker in the center of the ceiling.

Remodeling took 3 days.

The Subject is gently placed onto the sand in the middle of her new habitat whilst sedated.

The subject wakes up in three hours and twenty-four minutes.

&#x200B;

A-1 appears to be in a delirium for thirty-eight minutes after waking up

When A-1 comes too, she begins to explore her new habitat, in what Dr. \[REDACTED\] said was a state of glee or happiness.

Her exploration was timed to 43 hours.

After the period was up, she began to claw at the wall of her habitat, a sign of her hunger.

One coyote was introduced to the habitat. A-1 immediately gets to work, the acid is not enough to stun the coyote. A-1 begins to run at the coyote, and the coyote tries to flee. She regurgitates acid onto the coyote, which is 5 meters away. coyote stops for 3 seconds, long enough for A-1 to jump onto it. She rips out its eyes, shredding them in her proboscis. She then violently rips apart the coyote in a show of strength. 

After 5 hours of leaving the coyote in the sand, she begins to eat it. Her meal lasted 1 hour and 43 minutes.

She moves to the log, and begins to crawl in. After fully crawling into the log, she turns around inside so she is facing the outside. She falls asleep at 10:57 PM.

&#x200B;

She wakes up at 04:23 AM.

&#x200B;

\[ A-1 is officially classified as -SAFE-\]

\[ A-1 has a list of animals to cycle through for feeding : Wolf, Beetle, Rabbit, Lizard, Dog \]

&#x200B;

Ants are introduced to Habitat - Three colonies (inserted via robotic assistants)

&#x200B;

Bees are introduced to Habitat - Two hives (inserted via robotic assistants)

A-1 is curious about bees - approaches hive

Host turns out to be allergic to bees

Bees are removed from habitat

&#x200B;

A-1 is sedated and given allergy medication, after an Epi-pen is applied

A-1 is re-introduced to habitat, after many changes have been done, mainly, new trees have grown, with fruit and berries, numerous plants that grow fruit, or flowers are now growing in added substrate

&#x200B;

A-1 does not mind the new plants

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A-1 appears to have discovered the door, appears to not mind the door

&#x200B;

A-1 power outage causes cameras and lights to go out in the habitat for 30 minutes

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A-1 escapes. 5 personnel killed, 10 injured, 34 unaccounted for. A-1 is heavily sedated and placed in a new containment room. In a life-support pod

Door appears to have been scratched through. Door is made of 6 inches solid steel without oxidization

&#x200B;

2/5 of killed personnel were dissolved into a slush. 

2/5 of killed personnel were ripped apart, typically with the head caved in, or chest caved in

1/5 of killed personnel appears to have exploded. Brain matter or blood coating most surrounding objects and room

3/10 of injured personnel were lightly injured, with bruises, or scratches

5/10 of injured personnel were heavily injured, with chemical burns, internal bleeding, deep cuts, 

2/10 of injured personnel were in critical condition, with one or more of the following: collapsed lung, chemical burns, internal bleeding, disemboweled, degloved, and 1 or more body parts removed

&#x200B;

\[A-1 is to be kept sedated until further notice\]

&#x200B;

Habitat door is repaired. Sedative dart turrets are placed outside of the habitat. Pods of sedative gas are placed inside of habitat, able to be activated remotely to burst. All introduced wildlife have nanobots, able to be triggered remotely, causing animals to become aggressive. 

&#x200B;

\[A-1 is now classified as SAVAGE\]

\[A-1 now has nanobots in blood, causes cognitive functions to dull, can be activated remotely\]

&#x200B;

A-1 is placed in habitat, unsedated

A-1 is to be kept under constant servailence, cameras are connected to a backup generator, as are all defenses.

A-1 has escaped. This tablet was on a table, which have just so happened to take, to write this on. Please leave, wherever you are, its too late, three people escaped from A-1, and she is relentless. For reference, over 900 people worked in this facility, now it's just me, and me alone. Power was restored three days ago, I've been hiding for a month. All I see her through is the cameras, but she isn't the same as what we created. 

If you're reading this im probably dead, I'm just here to tell you what she's like now.

A-1's head has now transformed into something closer to a wasp. Her arms have elongated, about two meters long, her amount of claws has doubled, from three on each wrist to six. She has gone from 5'8", to 8'11". She now has large emu-like claws on each leg. Her tail is covered in spikes of bone and teeth. Her stomach is now full of acidic water, her lungs are larger, her blood is acidic. 

I saw so many of my friends and peers murdered. She's gotten so many new abilities, so many new, horrible abilities.

For starters, her proboscis has gotten enlargened, basically turned into a funnel. She uses this to her advantage, her large lung allow her to scream for long periods of time, the funnel mouth makes it louder. And she just so happens to scream att he resonant frequency of human bone.

I can hear her approaching, I fear for my life.
