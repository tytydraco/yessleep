Lately, I’ve spent all my spare time digging for information about the San Gabriel Racetrack.  It’s a century-old horse track out in the LA suburbs, where I grew up.  It’s not exactly the money-maker it was back during the good old days of horse racing.  But it’s our history.  So the county’s kept it safe from the dozens of development companies who’ve been circling like vultures for decades, eager to get their talons on the valuable land the San Gabriel Racetrack sits on top of.  

For now.

But that protectiveness for the racetrack has waned in recent years.  Everyone I ask thinks horse racing is mildly morally gross at best, grotesquely abusive at worst.  And I believe it wouldn’t take much to convince the powers-that-be to give up and close the track for good.  One disaster would do it.  A cheating scandal, or collapsed bleachers, or a drunken brawl, or really any incident that harms fans or horses.  The racetrack would be inundated with hostile press coverage, public goodwill would fester, and in the end, the track would be sold to the highest bidder to be razed and turned into luxury condos.  

Don’t take your family to the San Gabriel Racetrack.  It’s about to go up in flames.

All bartenders like to talk.  Bartenders who work at the theme bars and small clubs of Hollywood Boulevard like to talk, specifically, about all the weird crap they’ve seen.  And if you’ve ever been to Hollywood Boulevard on a Saturday night, you’d know “weird crap” there is a very deep hole. 

I used to be one of them.  I rimmed rocks glasses with black salt and drizzled grenadine to look like blood at Kruger & Meyers, a horror-themed nerd bar between Ivar and Cahuenga.  I told myself when I got hired, a week after college graduation, that bartending at the K&M was a placeholder job, a gap year, a monetary band-aid while I studied for the LSAT and/or applied to business school.  But I liked the job.  I liked the work and my co-workers, and I made great money.  My professional life became an endless stream of costume parties, classic monster movie screenings, and 80’s slasher trivia nights.  In other words - my wildest childhood fantasy made real.  Halloween, every day.  

Next year, I’d promise my parents.  Next year was the year I’d pick a real profession.  Year N+1, to infinity.  

Monday nights, O’Rourke’s Pub threw Industry Nights, specifically for the city’s waiters and dancers and Uber drivers - those of us who hustled all weekend while the rest of the city partied.  I used to attend with my clique of Hollywood Boulevard bartenders, drink Jamo and Ginger, and talk about all the weird crap we’d seen that week. 

Dark nights mid-fall, we’d kick around local urban legends.  Like The Gatsby Clown.  Supposedly, a young blonde thing with a bob and flapper dress used to pace up and down Hollywood Boulevard in flawless, intricately-detailed clown makeup.  Sightings of her occurred between three and five in the morning, after the bars closed and all but the bravest urban wanderers had found their way home.  If you crossed paths with The Gatsby Clown, and you asked politely, she’d describe - in gross, grisly detail - your pending death.  She wouldn’t tell you *when* you’d die.  But, since those who spoke with her tended to vanish shortly afterward, I’d assume the answer to *when* was *soon*. 

There’s also the one about the Beast of Cahuenga: a six-foot-long, purple, eight-legged cryptid that looks like a cross between a Gila monster and a cockroach leviathan, sighted in dumpsters on quiet nights.  Or, if you like your bar stories good and bloody, the Vaca Verde Taco Truck.  It’s said to be a front operation for an organ harvesting ring that snatches lone drunks off side streets, chops them up for parts, and grinds the un-sellable organs into taco meat.  

And then, there were the rumors about The Butterfly’s Wrist.  Those were different.  Because The Butterfly’s Wrist was real.

At first glance, The Butterfly’s Wrist didn’t warrant a second.  It was a nondescript little dive bar a couple blocks west of mine, sandwiched between La Cantina Flora (famous for its bottomless frozen margaritas) and Checkers Piano Bar (famous for jazz bands and 25-buck espresso martinis).  The Butterfly’s Wrist didn’t have a theme of its own.  Just a red lamp over the door, tinted windows, and a dirty grey awning, which displayed its name in faded white letters.  The place was never busy, never advertised - no posters, not even a menu board out front - and seemed to exist solely to catch spillover from the cooler, more interesting bars that surrounded it.  

It remained open for nine months, total, from mid-2019 to early 2020. The bartenders at The Butterfly’s Wrist, if they even existed, never socialized with the rest of us.  

The place was just creepy.  So of course, again and again, we found ourselves talking about it.

“Cody said the bathroom there didn’t even have electricity,” Diego told the rest of us.  “He flicked his lighter so he could see what he was doing, and pitch-black hands reached for him out of the mirror.”  Diego took a long sip of his Johnny and soda.  He and Cody were both bartenders at Petal, a little club on Vine that hosted burlesque performances.

“I know Cody,” said Stephanie, who danced at The Pink Cat.  “He microdoses.  I’m a hundred percent sure anything that comes out of his mouth is bullshit.”

“I heard there’s a basement,” Gillian cut in.  “My manager told me they’ve got a sex dungeon down there.”

“He’s right,” said Diego.  “They do the sickest crap you can’t find other places… pup play, piss and shit stuff, girls who’ll drug you and stick needles into your balls…”

Stephanie rolled her eyes.  “Sure.”

Paul, a cook at Checkers Piano Bar, frowned.  “I think they keep animals.  Dogs.  A couple times, I heard dogs barking and going crazy.”

“Didn’t some dude die in that bar?” Floyd asked.  “It was on the news.”

“I think it was outside, on the sidewalk.  Two drunk tourists got into a fight.”

“No, that was a different story,” Floyd insisted.  “Some local rando - an accountant, I think - died inside the bar.  He was shot.”

“I heard he was poisoned!”

“I met a guy who used to work there,” said Matt.  

We shut up and listened.  Matt managed the bar at Stella’s Library; he’d never mentioned knowing a bartender from The Butterfly’s Wrist before.

“It was a couple months ago,” Matt explained.  “Right after The Butterfly’s Wrist opened.  Young guy… his name was Grant, we used to buy cigs from the same liquor store.  He told me they’d had a Bartender Wanted sign in the window.  So he walked in, and whadd’ya know?  The owner was there.  Middle-aged guy with a European accent.  Grant said he lit up a cigarette right in front of him, but he also gave him the job.”

“Is there a basement?” Diego asked.  Stephanie shook her head.

Matt shrugged.  “If there was, Grant never saw it.  He also never saw the owner again.  No manager, no security, he usually worked alone, and he told me he could’ve got away with anything.  Underaged kids, drinking on the job, whatever.  No one there gave a shit what he did.”

Paul raised his glass.  “Perfect gig.”

“I doubt it,” Matt said.  “Grant lasted three weeks.  The tips were crap - the only customers the place attracted were weird loners or drunk frat boys who’d gotten thrown out of the other bars.  But that wasn’t all.  Grant said the bar didn’t feel right.  Like, it had some real twisted juju.”

\*\*\*\*\*

Now, I’d never actually been inside The Butterfly’s Wrist.  The dingy little bar became like wallpaper to me; I’d never been inspired to walk in and check out their tequila selection.  Plenty of better, more welcoming places around for that.

The day before Thanksgiving 2019, I found street parking on Cherokee.  Hours later, after work, I sat in the driver’s seat and texted my wife, Lucy.  We were set to fly to Pittsburgh that night.  My brother attended veterinary school in Pennsylvania; my mom had decided we needed to bring Thanksgiving to him.  

Lucy texted back.  She was tied up at the office and wouldn’t be home for another hour.  I stared up from my phone - and right through the tinted windows of The Butterfly’s Wrist.  A homeless man, dirty and mumbling to himself, crossed the street in front of me.  

I leaned back and closed my eyes.  I’d taken what I thought would be a dead-slow afternoon shift.  But, as it turned out, a lot of people had come into town for the holiday - and those out-of-towners all needed a drink before a long weekend with their families.  I opened my eyes and watched the front of The Butterfly’s Wrist.  Our flight didn’t leave until one in the morning.  I had time to kill.  

Back when I was a naive little lambling in college, I majored in journalism.  I’d buried that career path years before - and the vanishing opportunities, shit pay, and long hours chasing stories around the country with it.  But I’d kept the bordering-on-obsessive curiosity that had drawn me to journalism in the first place. 

With that last Industry Night conversation fresh on my mind, I decided to go for a drink at The Butterfly’s Wrist.

A mechanical bell tinkled as I stepped through the door.  

The Butterfly’s Wrist looked like a stock photo labeled Crappy Dive.  There were a few round, black cocktail tables and high chairs.  A pockmarked wooden bar top surrounded by red stools.  A standard display of liquor: mid-range, nothing too flashy.  One customer sitting at the bar, one bartender behind it.  An average bar, just like a million other bars in Los Angeles.

Well, maybe not.  I looked at the sole customer, blinked, and looked again.  Yep.  It really was him: the homeless guy I’d just seen wandering across the street outside.  Now, he sat at the farthest stool from the door, sipping brown liquor, face obscured by stringy hair and a filthy, oversized camouflage jacket.  

The bartender - a black girl who didn’t look old enough to drink - wore a pink t-shirt and fuzzy pajama bottoms with little red hearts.  When I’d walked in, she was pouring Bailey’s and butterscotch schnapps into a rocks glass.  I assumed the drink was for the homeless guy.  But the bartender replaced the bottles and took a sip herself.  

I sat down on a stool.  The bartender eyed me as though I were an an overly-friendly squirrel.

“Um, can I get a coke?” I asked. 

The girl nodded and, wordlessly, procured a can of coke.  My eyes were drawn to something on a shelf, between bottles of Frangelico and Goldschlager.  

A small, bizarre porcelain figurine.  A woman all in white with a blue skirt, arms raised in a ballerina pose, head cocked.  She had no eyes or nose.  Just comically-oversized pink lips.  A third arm extended from her flank, and wings poked out of her back.  The wings were thin, fragile and lavender, the texture of stained glass.

I stared at the figurine.  The bartender noticed me staring.  She took another sip of her drink.

“It keeps me numb,” she said, indicating her glass.  “I feel it less when I’m a little buzzed.”

The homeless man, suddenly and violently, slammed his fists on the counter.  “Stupid Obama!”  He screamed.  “Obama took my pension!”

I stiffened and jerked towards the door.  The bartender didn’t flinch.

“The pigs took my car!” The man announced.  “They drugged me, and I passed out, and bam!  Pigs all over it, stealing all my clothes, throwing my food on the ground.”

I took a swig of my coke.  The sickly-yellow hanging lights caught the ballerina figurine’s purple glass wing.  

My grip tightened on my can.  

*Screw Pennsylvania,* I thought.  *I’m about to give up a Black Friday shift and a weekend because my mom wants all her children together for Thanksgiving.  Who cares that I have rent to pay and, ya know, responsibilities at work?  It’s not like my job’s* serious *or anything.*

“They’re jealous, because of their limits!  I’m gonna… I’m gonna make a billion dollars, because my mind is limitless!”

I felt my heartbeat quicken, blood pounding in my temples.  *I mean, sure, it would make more sense for Kyle to come home for Thanksgiving.  We all live in LA, he’s the only one out of town.  But he can’t, because he’s in veterinary school, so we’ve all got to go to him.  Because he’s the special little star.  He’s the good one.  Mommy’s favorite.  And I’m the family screw-up*

“I’ve got a brilliant idea… I can’t tell you yet, but it’s gonna make me rich.  Then I’m gonna get my car back, and my pension back!”

The bartender picked up the handle of Bailey’s and poured a couple more shots into her cup.

Thin aluminum crinkled in my grasp.  *I’m not going!  I bet I could make a thousand bucks in tips over the weekend.  Screw my family.  Is my family gonna give me a thousand bucks?* 

I slammed my coke onto the bar.  Cold, fizzy droplets of soda flew into my face.  

“Fuck you!” The homeless guy railed. 

The three-armed ballerina figurine pouted at me, taunting with her puckered lips. 

*I had to get out of there.*  

I dropped a ten onto the bar top, left my destroyed soda can, and ran back to my car.  I threw myself into the driver’s seat.  I closed my eyes.  I breathed.  The virulent rage I’d felt seconds before, sitting by the bar at The Butterfly’s Wrist, dissipated into nothing.  

I had no idea where the intense hostility had come from.  I *wanted* to go to Pennsylvania.  I wanted to spend Thanksgiving with my family, *especially* Kyle.  I was proud of Kyle. 

My phone chirped.  Lucy.  Back at our apartment, packed, and ready to leave for the airport.  

I drove away.  I never entered The Butterfly’s Wrist again.

\*\*\*\*\*

Months after my one and only drink at The Butterfly’s Wrist, Coronavirus washed up stateside.  The state shut down.  The bars shut down.  Lucy and I holed up in our Koreatown apartment: her, working from home; me, baking sourdough and bringing my lady coffee, like the good little sugar baby I’d become.  I collected unemployment.  We didn’t stay six feet apart.

In June, Lucy came down with nausea and flu-like symptoms, freaked out, and high-tailed it to the nearest drive-through Covid testing center.  She tested negative.  We both quarantined for two weeks anyway.  When that was done, I bought her the over-the-counter test we probably should’ve considered in the first place.  That test came up positive.  Lucy was pregnant.  

Those two pink lines accomplished what nearly a decade of my mother’s nagging never could: they ended my infinite gap year.  

It was time.  I’d just turned thirty; my Halloween t-shirt wearing, Bruce Campbell quoting, manic horror dream boy behind the bar schtick was getting stale.  Impending fatherhood became the impetus I needed to leave the late nights, heavy lifting, and pukey drunk-wrangling behind.  I’d long since realized I had no desire to be a lawyer or a finance bro.  Instead, I applied to graduate programs in special education, and decided to attend San Luis Obispo.  Lucy still worked remotely; we were both ready for a change of scenery, so we sublet our apartment and moved north.   

I lost touch with my Hollywood Boulevard bartending buddies.  We still liked each other’s photos on Instagram but, with classes and Lucy’s pre-natal appointments, I barely had time to scroll.  I knew, after Covid, not all the bars re-opened.  One that closed forever: The Butterfly’s Wrist.

We couldn’t blame Covid for that one.

It was a local news item most people missed.  In late February of 2020, with a viral pandemic quickly closing in on the West Coast, it had been easy to scroll right past the LA Times article about the Hollywood dive bar that burned down.

I remember that morning - one of my last days of work, before we shuttered indefinitely.  Flakes of ash settled on my windshield; a grey haze snaked around cars and trees and buildings.  I had to pull a U-turn on Cherokee; two giant LAFD trucks barricaded the intersection, cop cars lined the block, and the sidewalk was cordoned off with yellow police tape.  

I learned, later, the most suspicious of my bartender friends were right: The Butterfly’s Wrist had a basement, accessible via trapdoor, out of which the petty criminal owners ran an illegal gambling parlor and dog-fighting ring.  (Side note: massively screw anyone who engages in dog fighting, no lube.)  That night, a game of blackjack ended with one player… let’s say, displeased by how things went down.  A fight commenced, and that fight became a brawl, and that brawl moved upstairs, and in the metastasizing chaos an electrical heater was knocked over, setting the wallpaper ablaze.  

Four patrons died.  Eight were hospitalized.  At least five men were arrested.  And The Butterfly’s Wrist was a total loss.  

I looked online and found pictures of the wreckage: the charred and splintered bar top and exploded liquor bottles.  I saw - I definitely saw - small bits of white porcelain littered across the floor, and melted purple glass.  

\*\*\*\*\*

Fall semester of 2021, my school reverted to in-person classes.  That was a blessing.  I enjoy sweat pants as much as the next guy, but as anyone who’s ever taken care of a newborn can attest, when you’ve got no reason to leave the apartment, that bubble gets pretty tight. Shaving is the first casualty, then bathing, and from there it’s a downward spiral to vermin-infested oblivion.  

My point is, I was grateful to slide on pants with a zipper, drive to an actual college campus, and have conversations about anything besides breast milk.  I liked my cohort.  Most of them were like me: late twenties or early thirties working schlubs, some with kids, looking for career stability after years spent being *interesting*.  

The most interesting out of all of my classmates was a girl named Greta.  She was about my age, and she worked as a ghost hunter.  Not a ghost hunter like those douchebags with a cable reality show; the way Greta described it, she was more of a ghost therapist.  She’d come in with her bag of crystals and sage and protection spells, make psychic contact with the spirit, and convince it to go into the bright white light.  I asked her how much ghost hunting paid.  She said she didn’t do it for the money, and I translated that as ghost hunting doesn’t pay jack.  

Greta and I weren’t friends.  Our relationship was limited to smiles and small talk.  So I was surprised when, a couple days before Thanksgiving break, she offered to pay for half my gas to LA if she could tag along.  It sounded like a great deal to me.  I’d planned on driving to my parents’ house with little Raven on Wednesday; Lucy had a huge project due for work and desperately needed a quiet night in our apartment alone.  If Greta didn’t mind sharing the backseat with a baby, I told her I’d take her as far as she wanted to go.  

“Hollywood,” she said.  “I have a job there.”

We set off the day before Thanksgiving.  Greta came armed with strange luggage: a knapsack, a rolled-up sleeping bag, and an incredibly creepy figurine in the shape of an old-timey jockey.  The doll was bigger than Raven, and it looked older than Greta and me.  It was made of thick plastic: a little boy with a massively oversized head, a blue jacket and ball cap, pants that had once been white and boots that had once been black.  The color in its eyes had washed out, leaving empty white circles.  Featherlike mildew stains covered its blue jacket and discolored skin.  

I raised my eyebrows at the jockey boy.  Greta didn’t offer an explanation, but she shoved the disturbing thing under the seat and covered hit with her hoodie.  

The first two hours of the three-hour drive were quiet; Raven slept in her carseat, Greta and I stared out our respective windows and appreciated the scenery.  But eventually, I bored of the silence.  And I got curious. 

“This job in Hollywood,” I asked Greta, “what is it?  Like, what sort of spirit are you exorcising?  Little Victorian girl?  Bruce Willis, who doesn’t know he’s dead?”

Greta smiled.  “That reference is, like, twenty years old, dude.”  Her smile faded.  “Actually, I don’t know what exactly I’m doing.”

“Well, who hired you?”

She scrunched her face.  “A guy.  He said his name was Tim.  Our age, maybe, wearing a suit.  He just emailed me out of the blue and asked to meet at Starbucks.”

“And what did he say?”  I pressed.  “Did Tim the Suit inherit a haunted house?”

Greta looked uncomfortable, like she really didn’t want to be having this conversation.  “A haunted business, I think.  Tim said he was working on behalf of a client… he didn’t really specify… he gave me ten thousand dollars.”

That shut me up.

“Ten thousand dollars,” she continued, “and he promised me another ten grand once the job’s done.  I’ve never made so much money in my life.”

“Yeah,” I warned, “but that’s what sex workers say right before they drive out to the boonies to meet the serial killer.”

“It’s not like that!” Greta snapped.  

I didn’t respond.  I got the impression she was trying to convince herself more than me.  

She sighed.  “Okay fine, it’s kind of unsettling.  I’m supposed to go to this abandoned building and spend the night.  Tim said I can do whatever I want… smudging, crystal work, Wicca… so long as I follow two rules.  One: every hour, I need to write a diary entry in a notebook.  And two: I have to bring an old-fashioned lawn jockey.”  

“Hence, Boy Annabelle?” I indicated the creepy figurine under the seat.

She nodded.  “I found him in my grandmother’s garage.”

Greta’s ghost-hunting gig sounded like How To End Up on a True Crime Podcast 101.  But she was an adult, and she swore she was a professional, and well… I had nothing to offer that could compete with twenty grand.  So I kept on driving.  I got off the 101 at Cahuenga.  I turned onto Hollywood Boulevard and stopped at the address Greta had given me.  Then, I realized what that address actually was.  

The burned-out husk between La Cantina Flora and Checkers Piano Bar.  The abandoned wreck that had once been The Butterfly’s Wrist.  

Numbing cold trickled down my spine and my arms and legs.  My fingers tingled.  I felt a warning surge of adrenalin curdle in my veins.  I remembered that night, years before, I’d sat on a barstool, staring at that disturbing ballerina figurine with three arms and purple wings, Hulk-smashing a Coke can while seething in anger.  I turned to Greta, who was gathering her sleeping bag and lawn jockey. 

“Listen…” I started.  “I… I used to work around here.  This place is…weird,” I finished weakly.  

Greta smiled reassuringly.  “Serious.  I’ve slept in a house where a father murdered his whole family.  I’ll be fine.”

I couldn’t think of anything else to say.  And I still didn’t know how to put into words what I’d felt that night, how The Butterfly’s Wrist had invaded my thoughts, twisting and warping them into something grotesque.  So I told her to call me if she needed anything and wished her luck, then watched as she opened the padlocked door with a key and disappeared behind the tinted windows.  

\*\*\*\*\*

Initially, Greta seemed fine.  I texted her Thanksgiving morning; she responded with “job went fine, brother picked me up.”  

Cool.  

She returned to class with the rest of us the following Tuesday.  Her hand was bandaged but, besides that, she appeared no worse for wear.  I didn’t get the impression she was intentionally ignoring me, but she also made no effort to follow up on our conversation in the car, and I didn’t push it.  I hadn’t seen The Butterfly’s Wrist in over two years; bartending on Hollywood Boulevard felt like a distant fever dream, and I’d realized I harbored no desire to relive that part of my life. 

Christmas came and passed.  Final semester began.  I twisted in a hurricane of research papers and projects and student-teaching, and then I was graduating.  We relocated back to Los Angeles.  Lucy got promoted; I found a job at an elementary school in Sylmar.  Raven said her first words and took her first steps.  We discussed a down payment on a house and another baby.  

Then, two weeks ago, Greta called.  She needed to talk.

\*\*\*\*\*

I meet Greta at a Starbucks in Santa Clarita.  I had no idea what was so important she couldn’t just tell me over the phone, let alone required a hike halfway across the state from the North Bay, where she’d moved after graduation.  We made small talk for awhile: she liked her job at a middle school in Santa Rosa; I liked mine with LAUSD.  Finally, I set down my coffee cup, leaned back in my metal chair, and straight-up told her I doubted she’d come all that way to compare notes on IEPs.  

She took a deep breath.  “You remember that place in Hollywood, right?  The one you drove me to on Thanksgiving, a couple years ago?”

I nodded.  The hairs on the back of my neck quivered, but didn’t stand on end. 

“Do you remember that lawn jockey I brought?  And… the guy in the suit?  Tim?  The rules?  I think… what do you know about that place?  The bar?  Because something went into the statue, and they took it out, and…”

“You’re not making sense,” I cut in.  “Yeah, I remember that creepy little lawn jockey.  What about it?”

She sighed.  She tapped at her phone, then handed it to me.  

I stared at a news article about the San Gabriel Racetrack.  They’d done some remodeling and improved the grounds.  The photo showed a little paved road leading to a new VIP betting parlor, lined with mismatched lawn jockeys.  The closest jockey boy figurine to the camera had a mildew-stained blue jacket, an oversized head with fading white eyes, a hairline crack across its cheek, and a jagged hole where its nose should have been.  

“That’s it!” Greta exclaimed.  “That’s the lawn jockey I took to that burned-out bar in Hollywood!”

An uncomfortable warm unease crisscrossed my chest.  But objectively, it was a ridiculous thing for Greta to say.

“Dude, I’m sure there’s a million plastic jockeys like that,” I told her, shaking my head.

“No, it’s the same one!  I’m sure about it.  The nose… the crack…” She fell silent, cocked her head.  “I never told you what happened to me in that place, did I?”

She hadn’t.

\*\*\*\*\*

She said they’d swept the ashes and broken glass out of The Butterfly’s Wrist; cleared the broken furniture.  Other than that, though, the place had barely been touched since the night of the fire.  It was empty, save charred walls and the splintered, blackened bar top.  

Greta had spent the night in dirtier places.  She unrolled her sleeping bag, placed the jockey figurine on the bar top, and drew her personal protection circle with black salt and lavender oil.  She smudged with sage.  She put crystal displays at the four corners of both the bar and the empty, moldy basement below it.  Every hour, as she’d promised Tim the Suit, she wrote a diary entry in her spiral notebook.  She meditated, read her Tarot cards, and smudged again before curling up and falling asleep.

The little girl woke her in the early morning.  She was about ten years old, with short, curly brown hair and a knit, collared button-down dress.  Greta immediately recognized the girl as a spirit, because the cooked white rice she’d placed at her Buddhist altar shriveled up and turned black.  But Greta wasn’t afraid.  She smiled kindly at the ghost-girl and asked her name.

Justyna.  Justyna Mazur, who died in 1943.  

Her father operated a small grocery store in that very spot - the place that would one day become The Butterfly’s Wrist.  Their little two-person family lived in an apartment above the shop.  Her father saved his money.  He didn’t trust banks, so he kept it in a bag.  He saved and saved; he intended to use his accumulated fortune to bring his brothers and their families to California from Nazi-occupied Poland.  

But a group of greedy men heard about Justyna’s father and the bag of money he supposedly kept hidden somewhere in his business.  One night, they forced their way into the store and upstairs to the apartment.  They grabbed Justyna from her bed and put a gun to her head; if her father didn’t hand over the loot, they threatened to kill her.  The gun went off accidentally.  Justyna crumpled to the ground.  Her father, overcome with grief, lunged at the men and wrestled the gun away from them.  He declared they’d never find the treasure they sought.  Then, he fired a bullet into his own temple.  

Greta should’ve kept talking to the girl, she admitted.  She should’ve led her towards that bright white light.  Guided her into eternity.  

But she didn’t.  Because all she could think about was that big bag of money.  She intended to find it for herself.  

In the backyard, she found a shovel and a sharp brick.  She tore apart the walls, pulling off charred wood and digging through the foamy insulation.  She pried up the floorboards.  She beat holes into the walls of the basement and jammed the shovel into the ground until it shattered. 

*It’s all my father’s fault*, she thought.  He’d died of cancer when Greta was nine and left the family with nothing.  *My mother is a worthless idiot*.  Her mother had wasted what little money they did have on alcohol, cigarettes, and falling for a pyramid scheme.  *I’ll show my brother.  When I find that money, I won’t share with him.* 

She tore and smashed and destroyed.  Her muscles ached and her fingers bled.  But she didn’t care.

*My friends are all broke, stupid idiots.  I’m paying too much money for that lousy school.  I know my landlord is going to make up lies to keep my deposit.  The money will be mine, and I’m going to laugh at them all.*  

Tim the Suit arrived at eight o’clock the next morning.  He found Greta in the basement, sifting through shards of shattered concrete flooring.  

Greta regained enough control over herself to feel embarrassed.  Hours earlier, in a fit of rage, she’d tossed the lawn jockey at a wall, cracking its cheek and breaking off its nose.  She’d kept to the rules - she’d written in the spiral notebook once per hour - but her later entries were chickenscratch grievances against her family, friends and classmates, then an unhinged list of all the things she’d buy once she found that money.  

Tim, however, appeared quite pleased.  He thanked Greta, handed her a fat envelope, and asked if she needed him to call her a cab home.  

Greta sat on the curb across the street and waited for her brother to pick her up.  Bits of char and insulation stuck to her hair, she was sweaty and filthy and smelled like must and fire, and her fingers were shredded and oozing and covered in splinters.  But what bothered her the most was the dark, obsessive hole she’d fallen into.  She couldn’t understand.  Outside the burned-out bar, in the bright morning sun, those overwhelming feelings of greed and anger and vengeance seemed alien.

“I’m not like that,” she insisted.  “I don’t make decisions for money… I’m a teacher, for Godsakes.”

“I know what you mean,” I said.

I remembered the night I’d sat in The Butterfly’s Wrist, sipping a coke.  I’d felt what she felt - the fury over losing out on a couple nights’ tips, the rush of ultra-competitiveness, the resentment towards my mom and my brother Kyle.  I recalled the stories I’d heard; all the deaths, rumored and confirmed.  

“I did some research,” Greta continued.  “There was never a grocery store there.  And I couldn’t find a record of any child named Justyna Mazur dying by gunshot.  But… I don’t think that’s the point.”

I didn’t think so, either.  I knew exactly what Greta was trying to say.  I *believed* what Greta was saying.  I just couldn’t put it into words myself.  

“A spirit lived there,” she said.  “I think the spirit… inspires greed and anger and the need to win.  I think I was sent there as a canary.  Or a guinea pig.  I was supposed to rile up the spirit and prove to… whoever it was who hired me… that the spirit worked as advertised.  And I think I trapped the spirit in the lawn jockey.”

I recalled another detail about The Butterfly’s Wrist.  The figurine above the bar: a porcelain dancing girl with three arms, purple wings, and pouting lips.  Smashed to bits the night of the fire.

“You made the spirit portable,” I said to Greta.  “Whoever paid you, they bought themselves a… a haunting to-go.”

Greed, obsession, and hyper-competitiveness.  Desirable traits for customers when you’re running an illegal casino.  Or trying to destroy a race track.

I did some research into the 2020 fire at The Butterfly’s Wrist.  Four men died that night.  One was found in the basement, lying in a pit of his own vomit, eyes bulging and lips blue.  He’d been poisoned with cyanide.  The second had been stabbed through both eyes with glass from two separate beer bottles.  The third succumbed to a traumatic brain injury on the floor of the bar.  A fourth man beat him to death with his fists.  He kept on punching after his victim stopped moving, when his knuckles embedded into brain matter, as the bar filled with black smoke.  He’d punched until he keeled over and died.  

The Butterfly’s Wrist was only open for nine months, yet at least six other deaths could be tied to it.  Two tourists from Arizona, who’d mortally injured each other and bled out on the sidewalk.  A bartender shot an accountant in the face after the customer accused him of watering down the vodka. Three TV crewbies, out for a quick beer after work, were admitted to the hospital with hair loss, vomiting, and chest pain a week later.  Within six months, all were dead.  Thallium poisoning.  It was suspected - but never proved - they’d been dosed by jealous co-workers at The Butterfly’s Wrist bar.  

I obsessively Google’d the San Gabriel Racetrack.  An important race is scheduled November 29th.  I also searched for conglomerates that have expressed interest in buying the property.  The largest, and most dogged, is called The Angel City Group: the big doll in a nesting-doll series of shell corporations.  If I were a betting man, I’d bet money Tim the Suit works for them.

Greta and I agreed there wasn’t much we could do.  What were our options?  Call the police?  Report a greed ghost masquerading as a little girl, trapped in a moldy old lawn jockey on the San Gabriel Racetrack grounds?

Well, I need another option.  Desperately.

Because my brother Kyle, the veterinary resident, called last week.  He’s been offered the coolest opportunity ever: a chance to look after the horses at the San Gabriel Racetrack. Better yet, he got our whole family tickets to watch the race.  Lucy’s excited.  And Raven can’t wait to see the ponies.
