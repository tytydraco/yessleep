What am I doing? There is no medal for being this diligent of an archivist.

I should have left it alone, stopped reading. I should have gone home, cracked open a beer, and watched the Knicks suck some more. I know now that some stories are meant to be forgotten, sealed away in folders to gather dust. But I am curious, too curious, and I kept digging.

At first, I told myself it was just research, an old habit. I’ve always had a thing for the little inconsistencies in official reports, or files buried so deep it felt like someone wanted them lost. Sometimes it’s nothing, a clerical error, a typo, or someone just got a little too high. But then there are the other cases. The ones that don’t make sense no matter which way you look at them. Have you ever seen a report where every witness’ statement contradicts itself? One report claimed it was pouring rain; another swore the pavement was dry. In a recording, the same witness described being followed by a tall, well-dressed man, then by a short woman in a Jets jersey. Reports that change every time I read them… as if someone was live editing. I thought I was losing my mind.

The first time I found one of those, I laughed it off. A hoax, maybe. A weird oversight. I threw it on my discard pile. Then I found another. And another. Different cities, different years, different circumstances but the same kind of changes and inconsistencies—like pieces of something bigger.

I should’ve stopped. I see that now.

It wasn’t until things started happening to me that I realized I wasn’t just looking at the files. Someone, something was looking back.

I started noticing small things at first. A blueish glow under the front door to the hallway, the clacking of my old typewriter in the closet, a flicker on my laptop screen—not the usual glitch, but something more intentional, like a frame skipping in a movie. The kind that makes you wonder if you actually saw something or if your brain filled in the blanks.

Then came the phone calls. I’d answer, and the line would be dead for a moment before a faint clicking sound started, rhythmic, deliberate. Once, I swear I heard breathing before the call disconnected.

I barely sleep anymore. Yesterday, my apartment door was locked from the inside when I knew I left it open. My neighbor, an older guy who barely notices anything, told me someone was standing outside my door last night.

Then today, I got myself a coffee and when I got back to my desk my laptop flickered again. A message typed itself.

*"Are you really ready to see?"*

I didn’t type that. It creeped me out and I don’t feel safe anymore.

I shut the laptop. Left my apartment. Walked three blocks in the rain just to convince myself the world was still normal. It’s not.

I don’t know what’s coming next, but I think I’ve already gone too far.

I need to know—has anyone else seen things like this? Not stories—real things. Patterns that don’t make sense. Files that shouldn’t exist. People who vanish in ways that don’t fit the reports.

If you have, tell me. Because I don’t want to be alone anymore.
