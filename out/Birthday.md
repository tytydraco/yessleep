The long finger of Time twisted out ahead of me, pointing to an unreachable destination. My legs sluggishly trudged forwards, plumes of ancient dust, remnants of all who’ve walked before me, billowed up to greet my lungs, with its flavour of bone. In a laboured sigh, I marched on, taking in my surroundings as I picked up the pace. The air was tasteless, aside from the odd drift of dust that fell from the void above, tumbling down like marine snow to the salt and pepper landscape below.

It was hard to tell where light was coming from; the greying trees that lined fields ahead of me were perfectly visible, as were the hills beyond that, with a pale cottage defying its endless black backdrop of the sky above, it felt lunar to me. I noticed the silence about an hour into my walk; hopping creaky fences, snapping branches, the pad of my feet against dust smothered grass, all of that was audible and fine… It was when I started humming, I could feel my throat vibrate, and the air leave my lungs, but I heard nothing. I screamed and cried out silently until exhaustion, left weeping into my hands. I didn’t ask to be here; I didn’t want to be here, I didn’t know where I was, or how I came to be here.

Wiping the tears from my face, I took a look around my immediate area, a dull pain in my head throbbed from the screaming. The dust flurried up across the hills in the distance, and I imagined a cool breeze rushing down those hills to whisk me up into the starless sky, carrying me away like a snowflake. Then I heard the humming, my humming, that same mirthful tune I had tried to accompany myself with. Looking back upon my lonely footprints and towards the treeline that coiled the field, a cold primal fear gripped my being, as the humming grew ever apparent and closer, my blood curdling screams suddenly erupted, warped and strained over the sound of the continuous hum.

My bones shook into action; my legs tugged against gravity’s pull, the blood engine in my chest firing on all cylinders. I ran frantic across the field without looking back, falling dust caressing my frightened skin as it whipped past.

“Help!” Crept my exhausted pleading voice from across the dead field and into my ear, “Someone please help me.”

I dove over the fence at the edge of the field and tumbled into the treeline. Scrambling through the dust in a panic, I blindly reached for roots to brace my accent to my feet. A silent wince escaped my lungs, as my hand fell through the roots like they were made of sand; the dust billowed up as I stumbled, revealing the bones that hid beneath the dust. The musty damp smell of marrow perforated my sinuses, and reality collapsed in on me. I was running again, the snap and crunch of bone popping beneath my feet, meandering my way through the treeline between the fields. My desperate mangled screams were muffled by the distance, and all I knew was that I was heading for the hills, for the cottage perched atop them; the thought of four walls gave me peace.

Eventually my body protested, my legs and lungs ached, and it had been long since I had heard anything. I felt it’d be wiser to trek through a couple fields, to hopefully shake off the chance of any more nightmarish experiences. Through shaky rattled breaths, I slowly moved myself out of the treeline, my eyes surveying the edges of the open dust kissed field, each one as still and as quiet as the last. I turned to a nearby tree and grabbed hold of a thin leafy, tensing nervously as I began to bend and twist it. The sound of healthy wood cracking pierced the dead air like a deep splinter; I hesitated, but then continued to rend the branch from the tree. It did not seem odd to me that there was no green inside, only grey.

With branch in hand I gingerly swept up my trail leading out of the treeline, and carefully navigated my way over the wooden fence into the field. Now on the other side, I pressed on, taking precious time to bury my foot prints behind me, with my head on a swivel, and my ears alert. Anxiety breathed down the back of my neck as I drew closer to the centre of the field, the treeline watching silently from all sides, their branches reaching up towards the abyss above.

“Can anyone hear me!” I heard my voice again, so faint and dry, it could have been three fields away from me, but the sinking pit in my gut told me otherwise.

I abandoned the branch and forced my legs into motion once more, practically dragging my tired body towards the unwelcome embrace of the treeline. Another fence scaled, followed by another, and another, putting as much distance behind me as my body would allow. My stomach folded in on itself as I leaned against the next fence, a disjointed black mass was aborted from inside me; it fell limply from my mouth, creating a grotesque stringy Rorschach in the bone dust. Slack jawed and panting, the corners of my vision grew darker as I silently observed the mass. It gasped a gentle breath against the dust, so I crushed it with a rock.

The hills were closer now, and I fixed my gaze upon the lone cottage, to see if I could make out any new details, its lifeless windows peered back down at me from under their thatch work brim. Daunting as the task was to the energy sapped husk I called my body, the thought of sitting and waiting to recuperate terrified my being, so I began the slow crawl up. Every fiber of my body screamed in agony as I willed myself further and further, like a lethargic maggot inching its way towards softer flesh. I did stop half way up to expel a dusty white mucus from my lungs, retching and coughing silently as I watched over the fields. Endless. Endless fields of various greys and whites, like a grand patchwork checker board, woven together by the treeline that spilled out through the seams. It was peaceful for a moment, dust bunnies fluttered to the ground around me, and the quiet that blanketed the land swaddled me in a bliss I could not explain.

A door slam reverberated down the hill, startling me from my trance, and a hot wind blew the all too familiar smell of marrow my way. I pulled myself up hurriedly and limped the rest of the way up the hill, suppressing fear as the hope of salvation surged through my veins. My legs buckled under me as I reached the peak of the hill, the pale cottage greeted me with its glassy stare, and I flung myself forwards through its open maw.

I blinked up, my eyes adjusting to the light of the bare naked interior, aside from the rustic looking table and chairs that neatly stood in the centre of the room. I could count all four walls from where I lay in the threshold of the door, and as my eyes fell upon the furthest wall they met the gaze of another face.

“Took you long enough.” The figure bitterly chuckled as he stepped forwards from the wall. A tall elderly man approached from the corner of the room, his nude skin shedding layers of built up dust with each step. He reached down to me as I weakly tried and failed to pick myself up off the floor; as his wrinkled dry skin brushed my face, all I could do was scream, but it only made him laugh.

“Ah, so you're a newbie.”  He clapped a hand against back and then attempted to lift me further through the door, “I haven’t come across one of you in a long time.” The small talk wasn’t doing much to lift my mood nor my body, as I made feeble attempts to wriggle from his grasp. It took him a short while, but he eventually had me propped up on a wooden chair sat across the table from him. He looked at me with curious amusement -he hadn’t tried to hurt me yet, I thought while peering at the open door, the smell from outside had intruded on our one sided conversation.

The old man slapped his hand down on the table and my gaze jolted towards him, “I know what you’re thinking, who’s this crazy guy sitting across from me? Where am I? Where’s my voice? Who am I? ” He began, each question more pressing than the last. I slumped back in my seat and pondered the questions presented; I could guestimate as to whereabouts my voice might be by now if it were still following me, but I didn’t like the intrusive thought of looking back outside and having some unknown horror lock eyes with me from just beyond the curve of the hill… So I derailed that thought and swiftly moved onto the other question that mattered to me, who am I?

I wrote the question in the dust on the table, and the man blew it all onto my lap. “You are someone who is not supposed to be here, but you will be doing us a favour.” His chair scraped across the wooden floor as he stood up, and I followed him with my eyes over to the door. He closed it quietly, and slid a large deadbolt in place, my world had been reduced to the inky black sky that I could still see through the two windows on the face of the cottage. At that moment, I wished that the sinking feeling in my gut would pull me through the floor and away from this place. I struggled to get to my feet, and I had managed to brace myself against the table by the time the man had walked over to me. “Sit down and let it happen.”

His leathery hands pressed down on my shoulders, trying to force me back into my seat. Brittle nails dug into me, but I stood frozen in place by the icy adrenaline that buzzed around my bones. “I deserve this.” The old man wheezed behind me. Suddenly my body jerked into motion. I threw my left arm up as I sharply turned, my elbow connecting with his jaw. He stumbled back; I heard a dull thud as his head collided with the wall. With all the grace of a newborn lamb staggered towards the door, reaching for the deadbolt. A haggard wet cough spluttered on the other side, and man’s eyes flashed white with fear.

“Your voice? You have one? How? You’re a newbie.” He pressed himself against the wall, slowly backing away from the door. I watched on with curious amusement, as the man eventually curled himself into the fetal position, a deep look of confusion twisting his face. “I was looking forward to going back.” Dejected, the man fell to his side, and I unbolted the door.

Stepping out of the cottage, I surveyed the area. The sky was still void, and the land was still grey, but that did not seem odd to me. The cries from the cottage behind me were almost deceased, and I felt a familiar warmth lay upon my shoulder.

“Time was stolen from you before you knew time. You will not know suffering, you will not know comfort. Everything you could have been, never was, and everything you are now, is just.”

The words chimed in my ear like a forgotten melody, and as I lifted my gaze to meet the speaker, the long finger of Time twisted out ahead of me, pointing to an unreachable destination.
