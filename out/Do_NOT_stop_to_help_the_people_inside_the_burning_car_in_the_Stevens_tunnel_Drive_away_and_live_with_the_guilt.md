I know what you're thinking. What kind of sick, emotionless person is this guy? He wants us to pass a burning car and potentially leave people to die? Yes, I do. Perhaps you can take solace in the fact that these....*things* in the car are already dead. Hell, I don't even think they are even *human.* And now, they've claimed my girlfriend.

It started off as a normal trip. We loaded up my truck Friday morning and we headed due west. We would drive to Cali, spend a few days on the beach and drive back.

Around 10pm we entered a tunnel. All of a sudden, in the left lane, a small red sedan sped past going *way* too fast for the curvy tunnel road. Within seconds of it disappearing from sight, there was a loud terrifying bang. My girlfriend Sarah woke up from her nap instantly. "What was that" she asked. "Call 911" I said, accelerating to try and get to the crash site "Someone just got into a horrible accident".

We pulled up to a horrifying scene that is now the beginning of my nightmares. The car was horribly smashed, debris scattered all around the tunnel, a tire still rolling away. But the biggest concern was the car itself which was already engulfed in flames. Sarah, ever the hero, was out of the truck immediately, sprinting towards the burning wreckage. "Wait" I shouted, grabbing her phone from the dash which had connected to 911.

As I got closer to the car, I saw hands pressed against the passenger side window. There was a woman's  face behind those hands but it....was not human. Her face was white, too white. She didn't seem to be panicking. In fact, she was....smiling. "Sarah" I shouted. "Somethings not right"

"Obviously" she yelled back, "the damn car is on fire"

I tore my eyes away from the hellish scene in front of me. Sarah was trying to get into the rear seat, which was not engulfed yet. "Sarah" I shouted, feeling even more uneasy about this whole thing. Something was truly wrong, and it *definitely* wasn't that people were stuck in a burning car.

"Just stay on the phone with 911, Sam" she yelled back. "I got this". At this point, the 911 dispatcher was trying to figure out how many people were in the car. When I looked back at the passenger side seat, the woman from hell was.....gone. My first thought was that she passed out and had slumped over in the seat, so, despite my instincts telling me to run away, I sprinted closer to the back door to join Sarah.

"Sarah" I said, catching up to her, "Do you see the woman in there"

"I....don't know" she said, turning back. "You're right, somethings off here".

"Help is 5 minutes out" I said. "It's too late now to go in without protective gear and hoses, we have to wait for the fire department".

Suddenly, a scream erupted from the flames. In the instant that my beautiful girlfriend turned back, a hand grabbed her by the throat and yanked her back. I yelled and ran towards the flames but she was nowhere to be found. Then, all of a sudden, the hands appeared on the window again. Except this time, they were not some random woman's....

They were my girlfriend's.
