This happened a few years ago. Having typed it all out, it doesn't sound that scary when I read it back to myself. I had a lot of adrenaline at the time, so it's difficult to recall everything perfectly.   


I live on the outskirts of town, and my property backs up to the edge of a forest. There's pretty much nothing back there except trees and a small dirt service road which goes back about 200 yards and opens up to a small clearing.   


I have really bad insomnia and my medication wasn't working, so I decided to walk my dog a second time, this time a bit further than usual in hopes that some exercise could help balance me out. I was walking him along the road/treeline when I heard a man in the woods scream in agony. There was just enough echo in his voice to sound like he was about 200 yards into the woods, placing him in about the same location as that clearing. I stood still for a moment to listen, and I heard him again. This was the type of blood curdling scream I knew couldn't be faked. It sounded like he was being tortured or was gravely injured. He wasn't making any words, just an agonizing, almost braindead scream every few minutes. I don't know why he wasn't making any words.    


I was near the service road and thought about walking down it to get a better look at what was going on. My CCW is still pending, so in the meantime I always walk my dogs while wearing my Rawlings baseball bat backpack, so I can carry a bat(the crime in my city has been seeping into my remote neighborhood). But having a small dog with me put me in a bad position. I cut the walk short and turned around and brought my dog home.   


Once my dog was safe at home, curiosity got the better of me, and I walked back to the service road. I almost made it to the end of the road when the sound of his screams really unnerved me and made me realize that I might actually be walking into a bad situation and witness something I shouldn't have witnessed. Possibly a murder. Having a baseball bat wasn't really going to cut it in this situation.    


At this point I heard one of my neighbors from far away yell "ARE YOU OKAY? GONNA CALL THE POLICE!" so I decided yet again to head back home.  


As I got home saw a patrol car drive by, drive down the road, then turn down the service road. My neighbor had indeed called the cops. I'm glad my timing and decisions didn't lead to the officers seeing me walking away from the area with a baseball batðŸ¤”. 

I read in the local news a few days later that the guy they found was taken to the hospital with blunt force trauma. I knew the guy too, a real son of a bitch. He probably did something to deserve it. Apparently my neighbor who yelled about the police ended up saving his life by scaring the attacker off.

Yikes. Hopefully I will get my CCW soon. My neighborhood is really going to shit.
