If I hadn’t been pressured, I wouldn’t have gotten to writing this…

Hello, I’m Reymond. I was an orphan for as long as I can remember, and there’s nothing worth mentioning about my childhood in particular. The only thing that is truly worth mentioning, however, is my life recently.

I’ve lived a hard life and had a tough start, I won’t deny that. But my life began to take a turn when I met my now wife, Emily, and my best man and best friend Jason. I met my friend at work, around when I was working four jobs to secure an income. And I met my wife when I was out for some drinks with my colleagues.

Life was pretty good, better than I could describe. I’ve had a private wedding that not many attended, and now living a good life with my wife by my side. However, as of late, my boss at work has been getting… superstitious, per se.

Nobody knows why, and most of my colleagues have been complaining about the same thing. He has been forcing us to go on fully-funded therapy sessions. Ironic, since he’s the one who needed it most. He didn’t give a proper reasoning, and HR sufficed by just telling us to be patient and go along with it since it’s an ‘obligation’ to make sure our mental health was in check.

Of course, I was no different. For seven long, very long months, I went to therapy, with two sessions per week. I was used to it, up to a certain point, until the last day of therapy.

“So, Reymond.” My psychiatrist, Christine, said. “When did you first meet your wife?”

“Again, really?” I sipped on a can of diet Coke, “I can’t go over that again. I told you, I saw her at a joint with my work buddies, end of story.”

“And what about Jason?”

“At work, that’s all.”

“I see,” She began writing notes, seeming more frustrated with my answers than she usually was. “Reymond, what do you remember about your parents?”

“Nothing, only that they died when I was young.”

“No one told you more?”

“Not that I remember, no.”

“Well…” She removed her glasses and massaged her temples. “Look, Reymond. I think we’re done with therapy, for good.”

“Wait, what?”

“You know…Ah, fuck it.” She leaned back on her chair, “Your boss has been trying to see if you’re sick with schizophrenia or some other shit.”

“What?!” I couldn’t believe what she said. I knew something was up, but this was insane. “Christine, elaborate!”

“To put it shortly, your boss and your colleagues set up this elaborate scheme to see if you’re really sick with schizophrenia or some other illness. Your boss didn’t provide me with enough details, but he gave me the rundown on your behavior. Honestly, it all seems fine to me, I don’t see what’s wrong with him. Seems like he’s the one that needs it.”

“I know, right?” I said, “What’s his problem? What’s their problem?! Why do they suspect me of being ill?”

“From what I was told, it’s probably because you ‘hallucinate’ people that aren’t there. But the way I see it, your wife and Jason are real people, there’s no mistaking that. And you display no oddities whatsoever.  Meaning, in short, that even this hallucination business could just be attributed to stress and overwork, or consumption of alcohol. Either way, I’m done, you’re not sick.”

“Wow, way to fucking deliver the news.” I sighed, sipping on the Coke. “Thanks for letting me know, regardless.”

“Yeah, yeah, whatever.” She stood up, “I’m not usually inviting, but I wouldn’t mind having you stay over for some drinks, just so I can have someone to complain to.”

“Thanks for the offer, but I have a wife.” I said, “And you should be mindful too, your husband was upstairs a few hours earlier.”

As soon as I said that, her eyes nearly popped out of her sockets, as if she saw a murder before her eyes. I gazed at her, chuckling nervously at first, thinking she didn’t know her husband was home. But then…I felt something terribly wrong.

“What did you just say?”

“Your husband was home.” I stuttered, “Did I say something wrong?”

“Reymond, I’m not married. I don’t even have a boyfriend.”

Those words made me feel sick, I nearly threw up on her carpet at that instant. I swallowed back the vomit and gazed at her dead in the eyes before speaking.

“Christine, I’m not sick. I swear, I’m not sick.” I pleaded, “Please, believe me.”

“I know you’re not.” She gasped and fell back on her chair as her knees shook uncontrollably. “Just…tell me, what did you see? Describe it in the utmost detai–”

Then, a masculine voice interrupted her, coming from upstairs. “Hey, honey!” the voice said, followed by the bedroom door slamming so hard it shook the house like an earthquake. She screamed in fright, but I rushed towards the upstairs, carrying a coat rack. I thought it was a burglar or an intruder of some kind, so I prepared for a fight.

But room, after room, after room…I searched every nook and cranny, I flipped the house over on its head, but there wasn’t the slightest clue of an intrusion, or any other person in the house other than me and Christine.

I couldn’t deny that I myself nearly shat bricks trying to make sense of the ordeal. Christine was curled into a corner, hugging her knees and crying. “It won’t stop…it’s in my head…it won’t stop,” she said, over and over.

I tried to approach her, to comfort her, but she slapped my hand away and entered a state of hysteria, screaming and shouting at the top of her lungs as she said “Get away! Get away from me!”

I ran away, not wanting to cause a scene or let the neighbors think I was doing something to her. I got back home late that night, I drank until my head felt numb. Yet even then, I couldn’t shake off the feeling that I was being watched, that something was following me.

I got back home, and the only comfort that I found was in my wife’s soft embrace. I recounted everything that had happened, even the things regarding my mental illness and Christine’s reaction, but she only laughed in response, telling me that the psychiatrist was some hysteric, thirty-year-old virgin and that she probably would be fine and that I shouldn’t bother with her.

I only nodded my head in response, agreeing with what she said, having heard what I wanted to hear. Subsequently, I had a message from Jason, and he told me that he had a ticket to a concert. I didn’t know how he got his hands on a ticket, but I was overjoyed at the moment. I loved concerts, and he knew that I did, and I couldn’t believe he got me a ticket all so suddenly.

I told him that I was down, and we got ready to go there at the end of the week. However, I wanted to drop by Christine’s house and apologize about what had happened, and see if she was doing well. She was either hallucinating, or I was. Probably stressed from pulling an all-nighter after the other, but I figured that it was the right thing to do regardless.

I got to her house, and I knocked on the door. Usually, she would answer right away, but at times she would be asleep. I knocked again, I knocked louder and louder, but no response. I then called her on her private phone which she kept on her 24/7, but there wasn’t a response either.

I felt that something was bad, to say the least, or that she was so fed up with me she decided to block my number. I thought about going away at first, but then I saw a drop of red paint on the window, and that’s when I felt a lump in my throat.

I tried to knock again and open the door, and that is when I realized that the door was left unlocked. I barged into the house, and that’s when my life changed, shattered into a billion, billion pieces.

Christine, my psychiatrist, was hung in the air by two cords pinned to the wall, in the middle of her house. There was so much blood, such an incomprehensible amount that I couldn’t believe it. Under her was practically a pool, and the walls near her were completely repainted.

Her body was completely naked and covered in blood. Her throat was cut deeply, her head pushed back and nearly dropping. Her face was eyeless, toothless, earless, and noseless. Her body was nearly torn apart from the torso, and that’s when I realized that the cords hanging her in the air were her intestines.

Behind her, there was a sentence written on the only spotless wall, in bold blood letters: ‘SHE KNEW TOO MUCH’. I threw up at the sight, and immediately closed the door and made a run for it.

I couldn’t think of anything rational at that moment, not even calling the police. My mind was fixated on going back home, to my wife’s embrace, and hope that it was all a dream. But as I was driving, I heard a voice echo in my head, a voice so deep and disturbing it nearly made me crash the car.

“Don’t do it, Rey.”

But I shook off the dismay and floored it back to my home. I barged into our home, and thankfully my wife was there, greeting me ever so happily.

“What’s wrong, honey?”

I broke down trying to explain to her, I couldn’t even form coherent sentences except for: “She’s dead.” But, as I was expecting a question in response, I was greeted by her giggles. Her laugh, as sweet as it was, never sounded the more disturbing.

“She deserved it, she knew too much.”

I didn’t understand what she meant by it, but before I could question her, I saw a grotesque blob of flesh, with a myriad of mouths spread across its body, crawl out from the wall as if it were a swimming pool. The blob of flesh looked at me for a moment, and proceeded to open its biggest mouth, half the size of a healthy adult, and take a chomp out of my wife.

He bit the entire upper half of her body away. Her guts spilled onto the ground as what remained of her fell flat. Her blood sprayed everywhere, and I couldn’t understand just what the hell had happened as I held my head in shock. My eyes couldn’t even close as my focus shifted from my wife’s remains towards the blob of flesh.

“I told you to not do it, Rey.” It said, in that deep and terrible voice.”

“W-who the fuck are you?!” I screamed so loud my voice nearly went sore.

“I am your protector, Rey.” It said, “Don’t go out if you don’t want anyone else to die.”

I couldn’t reply, I couldn’t sound another word, I simply collapsed onto the ground, and went unconscious, as far as I could remember. The moment I opened my eyes, everything was gone. I was sitting on my own, in the middle of my apartment alone and cold as I sat in pitch-black darkness.

Nothing from what I remember was still there. No blood, no guts, no blob, nothing. Not a single trace of that grotesque scenery remained, and the first thing I did to check if I was insane was grab my phone and check my contacts.

Christine and Emily were no longer there, nor was anyone else. In fact, nothing remained of the phone, as if it were factory reset.

“Be not afraid, Rey.” The voice spoke from behind me, “I will always take care of you.”

I jolted and turned behind me, and there it was, the blob of flesh. It looked at me and extended a skinless, fleshy arm from inside its body to pat my head.

“What the fuck are you?!” I ran to the door and turned the knob before pulling it with all my power. But it didn’t budge, not by even a millimeter.

“I wouldn’t do it if I were you.” It said, “I can’t guarantee your safety outside, away from me.”

My back was flat on the door, eyes locked onto the blob.

“W-who are you?”

“I’m the Caretaker. I provided for you since you were young.”

“Since when?”

“Since your parents gave birth to you.”

Then it clicked…my parents didn’t just die. The Caretaker is the one who did it.

“What happened to my wife, to Christine?”

“I can’t let others know about me. I can’t guarantee your safety then.” It said before it pointed at my crotch, “Emily was good, but she was too much of a pain to keep her docile. You don’t need her anymore, don’t worry, I took care of your needs.”

I hesitantly reached down to my crotch and then felt something weird. I pulled down my pants, and then I saw I before my eyes. Multiple layers of bandages covered my crotch, with a faint red patch of blood staining them from the inside.

“Oh my god! What the fuck?! What the fuck!”

“It won’t hurt after long. Now there’s no need for you to sleep with anyone, you’re castrated.” It said, “I took care of Jason too, he was a pain to control as well. Now it’s just you and me, I can keep you safe here.”

For days, if not months, I tried every way to escape from its grasp. It’s trapping me, most likely for all my life, in my apartment. It’s feeding me and treating me worse than cattle, far worse than a slave. I no longer am keeping track of time, and the days seem to pass ever so slowly yet so unfathomably fast.

I’m in hell, and I cannot even escape if I want because it would kill me. I know it will, it won’t let me escape from it. It also wouldn’t let anyone else know about it except for me, or else they’d meet a fate worse than death before dying.

Forget that you ever read this, but remember. I know it sounds insane, but that’s the only way that you could survive. It will find you no matter where you are, it will violate you in ways worse than anyone could possibly imagine before it butchers you in the worst ways known to man. Forget it exists, there’s no such thing as the Caretaker, there’s no such thing as Reymond, Christine, Jason, or Emily.

However, please, I beg you, save me. I know you can find me, I believe in this website and that someone could someday free me from this. Maybe SWAT forces, fucking military, anything. Bomb my fucking apartment, just please do something about it…

It’s glaring at me from down the hall…
