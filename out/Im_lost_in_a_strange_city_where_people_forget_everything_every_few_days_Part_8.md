Well, I’m sure if the time stamps on my last posts are an indication of anything at all, and not just a glitch of Reddit or this device somehow that happens to be terrifying me out of my wits at the moment, you’re all very surprised to see me posting again, but I really hope that that’s wrong. I don’t think I can take more bad news right now, and seeing “1y ago” written at the top of my last post isn’t helping  me shake this sick feeling that’s forming in the pit of my stomach.

Something went horribly wrong yesterday, and it’s all my fault. I don’t know if I can fix it.

And now I don’t even know if it really *was* yesterday. I *think* it was. It *feels* like it, but in a place like this, how can anyone really be sure of anything? What if it really *has* been a year somehow, and the resets have been taking my memory away this entire time? What if I’ve ended up like the others? That couldn’t have happened, could it? It seems impossible; my posts are right here, so I’d have them to remind me even if I did forget something, wouldn’t I? I’d still be making posts, writing down what happened as it happened. It doesn’t make sense. I don’t know. I’m sure it’s just Reddit being strange, having some sort of internal error.

At least until I can confirm anything else, that’s what I’m going to go with.

For now, for my own sanity, I suppose I should just try my best to calm down and focus on telling you about everything that I *know* has happened since my last post on Thursday. I’d already started writing up a draft yesterday, like usual, to do that, but in light of everything that happened, I think I should just start over at this point. Nothing I wrote about planning to do then even happened, anyway.

Maybe I’ll leave a few paragraphs from it in here, if I end up feeling like any of it’s important enough, but right now, I’m having trouble seeing it that way. I don’t think I’ll be doing any of that today. I don’t think I can.

Yesterday, I somehow managed to pull myself together enough by the early afternoon to have the rest of the day planned out; there were places I planned for us to go, leads I wanted to follow up on, questions I wanted to ask. I knew it could be a reset day, but I was hopeful that we could at least get a few of those things done before that happened — if it was going to happen at all.

I went to look for him at the Archive so I could tell him about the plans I’d made and see if he’d help, but he wasn’t there. I wasn’t really sure how long he’d taken off of work when we arranged to travel to Hortens, but I suppose that when I told him I was going to take the week off, he decided to do the same thing.

So, I went to his house. He was really quiet when I was sharing my plans, and he just seemed *off*, so I asked him what was wrong.

That was when he confronted me.

He said he knew I was the one who broke into that woman’s shop the other night, and he couldn’t believe that I was really trying to keep that from him —  that I even risked myself like that without at least discussing it first, when I knew full well that I had no way of predicting what would happen when I went inside. He laid out all the ways he’d figured it out, said that I should’ve known better than to think I could just lie to him like that and get away with it, that I should have at least given him the option to go with me if he couldn’t talk me out of it, or to go in my place, that if something happened to me and he didn’t realize it before the next reset, we both could’ve been trapped here forever with no way out and no way to reach each other, even if my mind was still in tact.

And he was right. I know that now. Looking back, I can see how stupid I’d been, how I let my desire to protect him from losing his sanity blind me to the even worse risk I was putting both of us in. I don’t even know why I thought I could just keep it from him like that. Of *course* he’d figured it out. Like he said, I was acting so out of character the past few days; yes, that was mostly for a different reason  — one that had nothing to do with *any* of this — but still, I should’ve realized that me splitting up with him that night after all of that and telling him to take my device that I refused to ever part with would’ve read as suspicious, even if I did come up with an excuse for not wanting it on me then. I should’ve thought about the fact that back when I showed him all of you and some of the things I’d written a few posts ago, he might‘ve run into the comments where I talked about possibly breaking in somewhere one night. He’s one of the smartest people I’ve ever met, and I was treating him like an absolute idiot, on top of being one myself.

And the worst part is, I never even said I was sorry for doing it to him. I should’ve apologized, should’ve told him the truth, told him everything, but I was so overwhelmed by everything, and even though I understand now that I didn’t have the right to be, I was frustrated. Frustrated that my actions were being held against me, that it seemed like he was accusing me of not considering either of our well-being, when I’d only done it that way for his sake — frustrated that…he was *right*. And that I knew that he was.

I told him I didn’t want to talk about it with him, harsher than I should’ve, and I think I’ll regret that for the rest of my life. I should’ve told him I just needed time, because deep down, that’s what I meant. I never meant I wanted to shut him out forever. Or even at all. I just wasn’t prepared to tell him what I’d seen; it felt hard enough just trying to stay sane about it *myself*. I think all of you could tell that from my last post.

He didn’t know that, though. I don’t really want to talk about most of the things that were said after that; it‘s not that he yelled, or cussed, or even said anything particularly cruel or uncalled for. A lot of it was just hard to hear, in a variety of ways.

In the end, he asked me to leave. I tried to convince him to let me stay, but by then he wasn’t having anything I said; he told me he needed time to think on his own for the day, and, that if that night turned out to be a reset night, it wasn’t like he’d remember any of this anyway, so maybe I’d get lucky, and I could “use his memory loss to keep him in the dark this time”.

I wish I could say that those words spurred me into action to clear things up with him before he could shut the door in my face, but honestly, it only made me more angry at the time. I didn’t understand how he could ever assume that about me, that I’d manipulate him like that. I was upset, and I let that get the better of me.

So, I just went to the theatre, and begged my boss to let me work off the frustration for awhile instead.

It wasn’t the best distraction in the world, but it helped — enough that by the end of my shift, as we were closing up, I’d actually come to my senses for the most part, and I started to think about going back to apologize, to try and tell him the truth, no matter how hard it was, or how much I worried about how it would effect him.

I suppose I can at least say I had good intentions.

The problem was, I was too late for it to matter anymore.

While I was walking in the direction of where he lived, I came across a shop with a window smashed in. I can’t even recall which one it was, I just remember seeing Clay’s umbrella laying on the ground nearby. I recognized the little symbol carved into the handle; I’m not sure what it’s of, but I‘d seen it once or twice, while I was assisting another employee at the coat check at my job.

I knew right away what had happened. It wasn’t hard to put two and two together.

I climbed inside as fast as I could, but I don’t think I was even anywhere close to stopping him. By the time I found him, he was already just standing there, staring at the shopkeeper, just as stiff and still as he was.

I don’t really remember much after that for a little while — just the most basic details: that I tried getting him out of there, that I ended up dragging him out, that it somehow felt harder than it should’ve to do it, and that when I finally did get him out the window, he felt lighter again, and then he instantly just went limp.

At first, I almost thought he was dead. When I checked him, though, he was breathing, so I did the only thing I could: I grabbed the umbrella, and then I rushed him to the hotel, before I risked anyone finding us at the scene.

After that, he just laid there on my couch. He looked exactly like that woman did — eyes open, blinking, breathing, but saying nothing, not even watching me with his eyes if I moved. Just laying there. I can’t get the image out of my head, no matter how hard I try. I tried to snap him out of it every way I could, but nothing worked. 

And then the exhaustion set in. I tried to fight it, to fight the reset, but it was useless just like always, and I woke up in my bed this morning, and when I went to look for him on the couch, he was gone. Of course.

I’m still in my room. I know where he is, or at least where he should be. I know where to find him. I’m just afraid of what he‘ll be like when I do. What if he’s just like those other people who saw too much? What if he’s lost his mind, or worse — what if he isn’t even in there anymore? What if he’s still in that state he was in when I last saw him, and he’s never coming back out of it?

What if I just killed the only real friend I had in this world?

I’ve feel like I’ve replayed the conversation we had in my head a million times — all the things I could’ve, *should’ve*, said, all the ways it could’ve gone different if I’d just been a little gentler, more honest, less stuck in my own head thinking about myself and *my* feelings. Less bitter about something that was my own fault.

It’s almost noon. I really shouldn’t be posting now, but I feel like I need to get this out there. One day I’ll just have to combine days of my writing again so I can get my allowed submission time a little earlier in the day.

I know this post isn’t like most of the others; it’s not as well written, it’s not as detailed, and it’s not as organized, and I’m sorry about that. I know a lot of people here probably look forward to that in my posts, but I can’t focus right now— not enough to do things the way I usually do. As it is, I’ve had to rewrite this at least four times just to try to make it more coherent. I’m worried. I’m scared, and even though I know what I need to do, I don’t know how I’ll live with myself if it turns out that he isn’t alright anymore — if I don’t get the chance to tell him I’m sorry.
