My name is Jim.
In the summer of 1983, I was thirty two and running the local Cinema in a small town tucked into the foothills of Colorado. 

It was an old three screen theater that smelled of butter and mildew. I kept it going generally alone. Refilling popcorn machines, fixing jammed projectors, locking up after midnight. All dependent on the day, it was a simple job though mind numbingly boring. 

It was meant to be a temporary gig. My real work was teaching high school history. But the district had made cuts, and this was what helped pay the bills until I was called back in.



One Thursday, near closing, I was sweeping popcorn out of Screen Two when the projector clicked on by itself.
No one else was there.

The film canister turning above me was unlabeled, an old silver reel I didn’t remember unpacking. In face I don’t remember ever seeing it. I was the only one on shift anyway, I didn’t know who could have played it. 

I looked over to see the house lights had dimmed.

On the screen, clouds rolled across a black sky. Thunder cracked, lightning split the horizon and four riders appeared. Shapes on horses, half human, half storm.

They galloped toward the camera, closer,  and closer until they filled the frame.

One rode a pale horse at the front, its skin stretched over bones, eyes burning like cold fire. A sword beside him glinted white.

He leaned forward, raising it toward me, laughing manically and looking seemingly into my soul. 

I stumbled back screaming, tripped over a seat, hit the sticky floor. The blade came down

Then everything went black.

When I opened my eyes, the screen was blank.
The projector was silent.

Dust hung in the beam of my flashlight.

I ran.

I burst through the doors leading to the halls/lobby and froze.

The carpet was gone.
Posters hung in tatters.
The concession stand was rotted wood and broken glass.

The whole building looked decades older, as if time had skipped ahead fifty years and taken everyone with it.

Everything that wasn’t in total ruin, was otherwise in a state of complete and utter decay. Nothing was recognizable, I whipped my head around terrified.   


Outside, the parking lot was cracked and overgrown. My car sat under a layer of dust thick as ash. All the other cars donning a similar appearance, it looked as though the whole area was destroyed. 


I drove home anyway, heart pounding.

When I walked in, the house looked normal again. My wife Laurie was on the couch watching the news.

“You’re pale,” she said. “Rough night?”

“Just… a long day at work,” I told her. 

I didn’t know what else to say, was I going crazy? Hallucinating? I didn’t do any form of drugs and barely drank, let alone ever at work. 
After a bit I convinced even myself it truly was just a long day at work…


The next morning, I awoke to the television on.

News anchors murmuring about rising tensions with the USSR, troop movements, possible escalation. Laurie had already left for work.

I made eggs, half listening. The tone of the broadcast wavered, full of static.

I switched off the stove just as the reporter’s voice changed flattened, metallic.

As I was already more than halfway out the door, I could have swore I heard him say

“You will join us, Jim”. 


Work was normal that day.
I made the popcorn. Tore and handed out tickets, teenagers clearly skipping either went to the arcade or went to a movie. 

I spent the evening reviewing security footage from the night before

Nothing. 

The projector had never turned on. The reel didn’t exist.

I told myself I was exhausted.


When I got home, Laurie and I made dinner, watched an old movie on VHS, talked about how things would be better when I got my teaching job back. For a while, it felt like ordinary life again.

We went to bed early.


Something woke me a pressure in my chest, then the sudden need to use the bathroom.

The house was dark except for the dim sliver of streetlight through the blinds.

In the bathroom, I heard footsteps in the hall. Slow, dragging.

“Laurie?” I called.

No answer.

When I opened the door, the hallway wasn’t our hallway anymore. 

Wallpaper peeled like old skin. 

Ceiling lights flickered behind clouds of smoke.

At the far end stood a man in silver armor, eyes like coals, bow drawn  

He laughed as he shot an arrow directed straight to my chest-

I woke up screaming.

Sweat soaked the sheets. Laurie stirred beside me, confused.

“What the hell Jim, are you okay?”

“Just a dream.”

I skipped work that morning and drove straight to the high school.
No one was there, summer break kept the place empty.

In my old classroom, dust covered the desks. I went to the bookshelf, searching for anything that made sense. I don’t know what i expected to find, but I needed answers to impossible questions. 

A world cultures history compendium fell open near the back

The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

Conquest. War. Famine. Death.

Harbingers of catastrophe, riding before great wars and disasters.

My hands shook.

Id seen two of the figures in that picture before. 
One at the theater, the other in my home. 

Then a television I didn’t remember being in the room flickered on in the corner. 

The same news anchor as that morning, voice distorted. 

He spoke rapidly of nuclear tensions, Soviet missiles, “end of days.”

I slammed the door and ran out. 



The hallway reeked intensely of rot.
Flies buzzed in thick clouds.

From the darkness ahead, a horse’s hoof struck the tile, another figure stepped into view.
I recognized him from the picture I had just seen,

“Famine”. 


He was skeletal, skin drawn tight over bones that jutted through in splintered angles.

Sores crawled up his neck, oozing dark almost black fluid.

His eyes were milky white, mouth split in a grin full of cracked, rotted teeth.

Around him swarmed flies, so intensely dense they moved thickly like smoke. 

Every breath he took clattered, like a death rattle amplified through an empty chest cavity.

I ran, faster than I even knew possible for myself. It felt as though my feet were levitated off of the floor, and I was flying  to the parking lot. 

He followed, each hoofbeat shaking the floor.


I burst into sunlight, into my car, into immediate motion without looking back. 

Behind me, three riders appeared on the ridge 
Conquest, Famine, Death. 

All charging through the heat haze, their laughter carrying over the wind.

The sky turned a deep black. 
Lightning flared purple, striking the ground all around the three horsemen. 

I pressed the pedal to the floor, engine screaming, eyes stinging from sweat.

Then I saw him ahead on the road-

War. 

Perched upon a red horse, sword blazing like molten iron.

He raised it as I violently swerved.

The car spun off the asphalt, tumbling multiple times until finally landing in a ditch.

Metal crunched. 
Glass shattered. 
I could feel the hot, thick, oozing blood running down my face. Beginning to blur my vision. 
My ears rang so loud, it felt as though I was in front of church bells. 
All I could taste was iron. 

Through the wreckage I saw them closing in.

War dismounted, his armor glowing like embers.

He knelt beside the broken window, smiled. 

I could read his lips perfectly. 

“Too late, James.”


Then complete darkness. 


When I woke, I was lying on cold metal.

I was in a room I had never seen before, or had I?

It didn’t look recognizable, though I couldn’t remember anything. My mind was a complete blank slate. 

I wandered through narrow corridors. 

After about twenty minutes, I had found an exit hatch half buried in debris. 

I climbed out to sunlight that didn’t feel real.

The town was gone.

Buildings collapsed, streets melted. 

Cars twisted into rusted sculptures. 

Decomposing bones lay where people once stood.

The mountains smoked on the horizon.

I walked for hours, calling Laurie’s name, until I reached our house.

Inside, everything was ash or rot. 

Her side of the bed was empty.

I sat on the couch and cried until I couldn’t breathe.

When I looked up, the television was sitting on the coffee table, still intact.

Next to it lay the same history book from my classroom, open to the page about the Horsemen.

I read the line twice, tracing it with a shaking finger

“They appear as warning before great destruction before humanity’s own undoing.”

Then it all came back to me. 

The crash, the horseman, everything. 

I read over that passage again, then stared at the tv. 

I remembered the news reports. “Russians”, “War”, “Nuclear Bombs”. 

Outside, the wind picked up, carrying the sound of hoofbeats.

And laughter...
