I’m not really a big believer in supernatural things. I’d rather said I’m more of a skeptic guy. But at the same time, I’m not saying that I strongly deny an existence of supernatural. Anyway, I have always found mystic and scary stuff fascinating and interesting, and occasionally, I love reading or watching something related to it. 

So, it happened 10 years ago. I was 13 then. It was a usual evening. I came back from my school, got a rest, a dinner, did some homework for tomorrow classes and chilled after in a video-game some time. Nothing special, 90% of my evenings used to be like that back in the day. Towards the end of a day, I did everything for tomorrow, took a shower, prepared for a night and lied down on the bed in my room. I loved reading a book some time before I fall asleep. And exactly during that process it happened to me.

It was around 10:30-11 pm. I used to live with my mom, and she usually went to sleep earlier than me, a bit. At that moment she was already sleeping, I knew it exactly. No chance it was her. She also loves to read before falling asleep, and I could know when she finishes it. Because the thing is, my mom doesn’t fully close the room door for a night, so it has a slight gap, and you could hear the switch and comprehend when she turns off the light in her room. And the same I used to do, didn’t close the room door entirely, so I could sleep with a light in the corridor (I had nyctophobia then). Not only that, my room and mom’s one are very close to each other, separated only with one wall. And when you go out from any of them, you get straightly to the corridor. Secondly, we used to have a rabbit, but we always made sure we locked it in its cage in the kitchen for a night. Hence, it’s also couldn’t be a rabbit. So, what happened? 

I was reading a book and felt like it would be the time to finally turn off the light and fall asleep in a couple of minutes. (Now, I remind you, my mom’s door and mine are slightly open and not closed fully). Suddenly, I heard a strange noise coming out of the corridor. It was fairly clear noise and I could hear it pretty well as it was total silence in the flat. It was like… Like somebody was very slowly walking away from my room door, going to the third room in the end of the corridor. But it didn’t sound like a usual walking. The noise was something like if someone put on slippers on their legs, but one of them is broken or injured, thereby making it drag it on the floor.

And it sounded like IT made a slow step with his healthy leg, and after made a second one, pulling his injured leg on the floor in slippers. And in that god-damn moment, after a couple of seconds since it started, I realized everything in my head. 

Like, there are only my mom and I here at the flat. Mom is sleeping, and if she awakened, I would surely understand it. My rabbit is locked in its cage in the kitchen. Neighbors, you might say? Well, our house is older than 100 years, and it has solid brick walls with high ceilings. Very rarely it could be some noise going out from the neighbors, but god-damn NOT LIKE THAT AND NOT SO CLEARLY AND CLOSELY RIGHT TO MY ROOM. Thus, I rapidly excluded every possible reason of the sound which I thought may hypothetically be in a couple of moments. 

As I could understand, it was slowly moving away from my room to the last one of the corridor, as I mentioned before. The sound lasted for maybe just about 6–8 seconds and… just disappeared. It didn’t get quieter, it didn’t change itself. It was continuously the same noise with the same volume for 6–8 seconds going away from my door. And after that time has passed, it just vanished. Like it has never been any of it there. And while the noise was occurring, and when I understood that I totally have no idea what could do such sounds, I became numbed as fuck and felt like my body grew up roots into my bed. I couldn’t move, I was scared to death even trying to breathe. My heart rate was so fast that I thought my heart will either drop out of my chest or either just stopped. I felt such a feral, ice-cold horror. And it just paralyzed me so much that I remained in the same posture I was when the noise appeared. I was so scared, but at the same time, I really wanted to know what or who was making those sounds. But the fear was stronger than my curiosity, and it didn’t let me stand up and check out what was going on in the corridor. 

I have no idea how much time I spent being in one posture without any movement and trying not to breathe. I really don’t know how much time has passed since the noise ended, and I could finally stand up from my bed and check out the corridor because in such situation while being afraid to death feeling of the time changes. It’s like it ceases to make any sense of what time is and for what it’s needed. But, it seemed to me it has passed approximately 20 minutes since the sound ended, but it also could be longer or shorter in fact. Finally, breaking the shackles of a terror and regaining the ability to move, I stood up and opened the door. 

Sure thing, I didn't notice anything special. Like absolutely nothing, just my corridor lightened with lamps. My mom's door was in the same position in the way it always used to be. I had a thought to come in that third room towards where IT was moving and check it. But I decided it won't be a really cool and clever idea, I still was very frightened. I came back to my room, closed the door and additionally locked it. I returned to my bed with total mind chaos in my head, overthinking what or who was making that noise. And I don't remember how I fell asleep and how much time it took me to do that. 

In the morning, when I woke up, I asked my mom whether she heard anything last night or not. She said she didn't, and I told her that story. But I don't remember what she replied to me to this and what was her reaction. 

So, that's it. It was the first time I have ever encountered with something unusual like that. Nowadays, I still have no clue what those noises were and whom did they belong. 

Any thoughts what it could be?
