"I Don’t Feel Safe With My Coworker.”

I hated working there.

I think that most people can say night shifts suck. Being a college student doesn’t help either; I missed most of the good parts of my freshman year because of my job, leading me to develop a case of FOMO. My shift at the warehouse started at midnight, and I got off at 8 am to go immediately to class, then back to my dorm to crash, waking up just before work. Now it wasn’t every day, but I worked there a lot, which meant I didn’t make a ton of connections with people at college. It didn’t bug me too much, but I also wanted to have a good college experience, so it always stayed in the back of my mind.

Now I know the obvious question of why I didn’t quit and get a job somewhere else with more flexible hours. Well, it paid too much, as simple as that. Any other place is less than half of what I got paid at the warehouse. My job consisted of inventory. The company had a weird motto, too. They were a freelance warehouse kinda for renting primarily advertising twords businesses. And being the inventory guy, I kept stock of weird stuff, as you can imagine. An adult store rented a portion of the place out for the longest time; that's all I have to say. Now I didn’t just take inventory and leave, I also was a general “hands on deck” man too for whatever needed to get done. Constantly, I would come home with back pain and aches.

It was a month ago when I quit. I never want to go back. Working at a warehouse, there were some characters that I would be associated with. Most were just middle-aged men with a wife and kids at home, but there was one other person who stood out among the rest. I don’t remember his name, or I guess I didn’t care to. He started working a couple of days before I quit, and I think the first day, my coworkers got the same feeling I did.

For one, his appearance. He looked malnourished, really tall and lengthy, 6’4 or 5, I’d have to say. His skin was suction-sealed to his facial bones, showing off his cheekbone definition. His skin was the same consistency as your fingers when you swim for more than 2 hours. He didn’t give off any smell at all, like not even a deodorant or cologne. He could have been anywhere from early 20s to late 40s. His clothing choice was the Walmart special. The few times I saw him, he had dirty pajamas with a shirt usually with some sort of cartoon character on it. The first time talking to him, he gave me the impression that he was very socially disabled. I wouldn’t say awkward, I would say he just lacked social awareness and social cues. He was a new loading guy, but everyone here kinda did the same thing.

Before each night, we have a briefing on what needs to get done and who’s working with whom on what. The previously mentioned lengthy guy was tagged with me on clearing out an old section of a bankrupt laundry mat. I would prefer that this warehouse be massive with several different sections. The building could usually hold up to 20 business storage slots at a time, each one varying in size. This was a smaller one located approximately a 5-minute walk from our break room, a pretty long way from everyone else. I didn’t care that I was with the new guy, this had been his third day, and judging by him walking next to me, he hadn’t done anything bad yet. We reach the room with a big garage door, a truck backed into it, where we are loading the rest of the forgotten business. Cardboard and wooden boxes lined up with image prints of laundry machines, carpets, computers, and desks on the outside, each box varying in size, unorganized. 

I brought my headphones with me, but I think my coworker had another plan. He reminds me of an annoying guy on a plane talking when you are trying to sleep.

“So, how long have you been working here for?”. It caught me off guard. I didn’t expect him to make small talk, but even more, his voice caught me off guard. Not so much his voice but the way he said his sentence. It’s like if someone read the entire dictionary but didn’t know how to spit out a sentence properly.

“It’s been a couple of years for me.” I lied. I’m not sure why, maybe because I wanted to seem more intimidating.

He didn’t respond, followed by a very awkward silence you’d find at a reunion. It continued for a minute as we separately picked up the small items, placed them next to the truck, and prepared the bigger items to go into the back.

I couldn’t help but notice the sound of his creaking bones, like an old door hinge in dire need of WD-40. I kept catching him looking at me. He would stare at me, and when I noticed in the corner of my eye, I looked over as he looked away. I didn’t mind it, he is new after all, I thought he was just looking at me of what to do.

“So, where do you live?”

“In town”. Trying to give the least information possible to this guy for my own safety.

“No, like where do you live?” The tone of his voice is still creeping me out.

“I don’t know, West of town?” I phrased my answer like a question, wondering if it was enough to make him happy. This is when I truly started to see the social disability. I was a little creeped, but more just annoyed than anything. There was another moment of silence as I continued minding my own portion of the work.

“Do you know people?” Weird question.

“Sure.” I think he got the message from my dry response and my seeming inability to look over at him. I don’t care if I was being an asshole I just didn’t want to make small talk.

After a long, painfully quiet couple of hours, when we got finished, I had a slight feeling of sympathy for the guy. I didn’t do anything about it, just kept it in my mind. I clocked out and walked outside to the sweet relive of fresh air in our comically large parking lot for how few people work here actively. I always loved it, walking out and seeing the sun rise, complemented by the cool air taking over my lungs. Quickly, I noticed that parked directly next to my 1991 Honda Civic effectively named “Shit box”, was a truck not much nicer than mine. I didn’t recognize the car, but I assumed it was the new guys, because no one parks next to me. I looked into the driver's seat of the black early 90s Highlander to see him sitting there. He wasn’t fumbling with his keys or checking in on his phone. No, he was writing down in a notebook placed on his dashboard. He looked up and looked like he had just gotten caught with his pants down. I saw him through the notebook onto his passenger seat, and the roaring sound of the car came to life, headlights effectively blinding me. He reverses out of the spot and drives off, going much faster than anyone should in a parking lot.

Immediately, I became suspicious. Sure, none of my business what he was writing down and why he bolted when he saw me, but I made a mental note and continued with getting in my car.

I got to my apartment and decided to skip my classes for some extra rest. It was a flip of the coin most of the time whether I would go to school or not. 

It was 4 PM, my normal waking time. My head was dazed, my eyes were blurry, and the most dreadful feeling of thirst. It doesn’t happen often, but my roommate and I, who don’t see each other much because of my work, decided to get breakfast. It was the same every time for us, broke college students. Denny's, $6 all-you-can-eat pancakes. We were sitting in a booth overlooking the parking lot through the window. As my roommate and I were having a competition of “Who’s ex is the biggest prick?” A familiar car pulls into the Denny’s parking lot. I don’t believe in coincidences, so I immediately knew who it was. The same black Toyota Highlander from earlier this morning, my co-worker. I didn’t point it out and continued our conversation.

“Remember when she tried to steal my dog?” My co-worker spat.

“Oh shit, yeah.” My mind was in two places at once. Reminiscing about a situation months prior, as well as watching the car outside, wondering what he was doing. The car pulled into the parking space right next to mine, and I seemed to make a facial expression because my roommate picked up on it.

“What?” He also turned to the window.

“That car.” I pointed. “That’s my new co-worker.”

“Oh, sick.”

“No, not sick, he’s weird. I think he wrote down my licence plate earlier.” That was my only explanation to myself of why he would be here now.

“That black one?”

“Yeah.”

He must have seen us looking or pointing, because as quickly as he did this morning. He did it again, skirting out of the parking lot, making a scene.

“What the fuck was that?” My roommate was as confused as I was.

“Whatever, I’ll deal with it later.” While trying to act cool, I was freaking out on the inside. Was he following me? Was he planning to do something to my car if he didn’t see us watching him? Safe to say I did not want to go to work tonight, contemplating calling in sick.

It was 10 PM, 2 hours before I had to clock in. Dreading every moment of existing. Since Denny’s, I had kept a small box cutter on me, hoping I didn’t have to use it. I tried to call my boss, but it appears I had already had enough “sick days”. Fuck.

I was pulling into the parking lot, and from far away, I saw his car, parked in the same spot as yesterday. I had my box cutters in the right pocket of my cargo pants as a sense of false safety. My mind was racing. I didn’t know how to fight, he was much taller than me. I had to calm myself down and remember that there would be other people. I just hoped I wasn’t put with him to clear out the laundry mat section again. We made some progress, but we still had 3 shelves to go. I walked into the breakroom filled with small amounts of chatter and stale room temperature coffee. I saw the guy. He was just sitting on his phone in the corner.

I looked over and saw that we were still working together. My heart sank so far into my chest, I felt like I could never get it back out. Midnight hit, and we made the quiet walk over to the furthest storage unit. We didn’t speak, we didn’t look at each other. We just walked the 6 minutes in silence. What terrifies me the most is that the entire time, he had a grin on his face, which I saw from the corner of my eye. We made it in. I was always so alert, keeping tabs on where he was in the storage unit.

He knew. He saw me shaking, constantly dropping boxes out of my hand from the moisture on my palms. He started approaching me.

“Are you okay?” He sounded even more robotic than yesterday.

“Yea- yeah, I’m good.” I was so fucked. I was trying to hide the fear, but it seeped through into my voice. He stepped closer

“Let me help you with that.” Instead of him picking up the box like I thought he would, he grabbed onto my wrist. His touch was like ice, his hands freezing.

“Don’t fucking touch me!” I screamed. I didn’t know what to do. Was I overreacting? I need to get out.

He stepped back. I looked at his face, and my heart filled with horror and dread. He didn’t react. No, “Oh, I’m Sorry” or “Oops, my bad”. He just stared like the most uninteresting thing was happening. He wasn’t even looking at me, just looking head-on.

I couldn’t be in the room with him anymore. I ran to the lockers grabbed my shit and bolted. I ran to the emergency exit, sounding the alarm in the building. I ran. As fast as I could through the parking lot. I heard him running behind me, trying to catch up, but as tall as he was, I was able to outrun him. I got into my car, fumbling with my keys. I was crying. I saw him, he was there right next to the driver's side window. Tapping on the glass.

“Let me in.” He had no emotion. A husk.

I stepped on the gas so hard that rocks kicked up behind my back tires on the gravel ground. I skitted out of the parking lot and onto the road. Looking back to see if he followed me, banging on the steering wheel and screaming to myself. I’ve never been this terrified in my life. I got home and called my boss. I’m done.

I didn’t go to class for the next few days. All I could do was sit in my bed and effectively overdose myself on melatonin. What would have happened if I didn’t run?

It was a week later. I saw him again. I was leaving my dorm room and looked down at the very end of the hall. It was him. He knows where I live. He didn’t move, the same lifeless emotion on his face as earlier. I went back inside and crumbled to my knees

It’s been a week since then. I don’t know who else to tell this to. So I’m telling it here. I could call the police, but legally, the guy did nothing wrong. I mean, at the best, he could go to jail for stalking, but I don’t know if there would be enough evidence for that. I heard from one of my co-workers that he got fired. They saw the camera feed and got fired for misconduct. I guess it wasn’t harassment because it appeared to be an accident that only happened once.

I’ve been going to class this last week, always keeping some sort of weapon to protect myself.

I just hope I never see that black Highlander again.
