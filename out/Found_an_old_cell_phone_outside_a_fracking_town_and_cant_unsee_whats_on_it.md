*A few days ago I got lost on back roads near Fox Creek, Alberta. Reception is bad out there, so no Google maps. I stopped to pee and found a dead cell phone. Took it home to charge it and found the following memo . I’m really scared. What should I do about this?*

  
\-----

  
This whole thing started when I heard rumblings that something was not right in Fox Creek.  
Across the Athabasca River in Central Alberta lies the Duvernay formation, an area of land with countless tonnes of valuable oil. The only problem is, it’s locked up in shale and sandstone.

  
Enter the miracle of induced hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” as we call it in the media. Instead of just drilling down to pump the black gold from vast reservoirs underground, they fire off explosives down there to shatter the rock and release the oil.

  
Environmentalists have always objected to fracking, citing a laundry list of potential harm – earthquakes, contamination of ground-water, you name it. And the oil industry has always ignored them.

  
But I haven’t. Over the years I have overseen some excellent journalism about the impact fracking has on small towns. Our story exposing the harm to communities near the Spirit River formation even won a CAJ Award.

  
So when I caught wind of strange stories coming from Fox Creek, I was like a hound with a scent. Reports of odd seismic activity, farmers complaining of missing cattle. Whole families up and disappeared. It was hard to see the connection, but I know a story when I smell one.

  
I’ve worked at the Winnipeg Tribune for 16 years, these last five as editor-in-chief. We’ve always leaned left, and with the paper industry locked in a death struggle with internet click bait, I thought that this kind of story would be catnip for our readers.

  
I decided to get some boots on the ground and assigned my best investigative reporter, Bill Heisey to spend a week at Fox Creek and get a lay of the land. Talk to the locals, try to score a couple juicy pull quotes from drunk, off-duty riggers. Worst case scenario, he’d come back empty-handed and we’d be out the cost of a dingy motel room and some gas money.

  
Bill was only there a couple of days and already he was sending back extremely interesting photos. Giant sinkholes on the outskirts of town, talk of bigger ones at the fracking site. Great gashes ripped open in the earth, who knows how deep.

  
Bill wrote to me of the smell of methane that hung over the town like rotten eggs. Grocery stores nearly empty, a thin layer of grease over the slowly rotting produce. I asked him to grin and bear it for a few more days.

  
But then, nothing. Total radio silence from Bill. I tried calling and emailing, even reached out to his wife, but she hadn’t heard anything either. I tried to file a missing person report, but was told we had to wait 48 hours. The Fox Creek Sheriff’s department informed me that no one had seen a person matching Bill’s description in town. I found that hard to swallow - Fox Creek is not exactly a bustling metropolis. I tried to convince myself that Bill was pulling some kind of stunt and chasing a story off the grid, but after a tearful call from Maria, I promised that I would go have a look.

  
It was a 15 hour drive from the city. I had passed dozens of pit stops along the way, each a dimly glowing oasis in the inky blackness of the road. I approached the final pit stop before Fox Creek proper. Bill was right about the smell. Even with the windows shut tight, the stench was horrendous. As I drew closer, my eyes went wide as I saw something that stopped me cold.

  
Bill’s car.

  
Parked right outside the diner.

  
I pulled into the parking lot beside the car. Bill drove a hybrid, which was what made me so confident it was his. Hard to imagine folks in an oil town driving electric. The vehicle stuck out like a sore thumb next to the two Ford 350s parked alongside. Just to be sure, I examined the plate. Yep, Saskatchewan-issued.

  
I studied the diner. Not much bigger than a couple of shipping containers welded together. Even the restroom was separate from the main building, a stand-alone structure made of brick and concrete, more of an outhouse than a restroom.

  
I entered the diner and grimaced as the smell from outside somehow got worse. The baseline heavy methane aroma was now flavoured with something sharp and metallic that made my stomach turn.  
I sat down at the counter and glanced at the only other patron, a hulking man hunched over a plate of steak. Resting in a pool of pink liquid, the meat was so undercooked it would be more apt to call it raw than rare.

  
I looked around at the booths to see if Bill might be tucked away in one of them, but the rest of the diner was empty. I waited for a server, trying not to gag at the sound of the man’s serrated knife tearing through the flesh of the steak, the juicy sound of his open-mouthed chewing.  
Finally, I cleared my throat and called through the swinging door into the kitchen.  
“Anybody working the counter?” I called.

  
A squat, squinty-eyed fellow emerged, more hairy arms than man. He wore heavy rubber gloves up to his elbows that were caked with grease and stained a dark brown. He sweated profusely and wiped his forehead with the glove.

  
“We’re closed,” he said gruffly.

  
“I’m looking for an employee of mine,” I said.

  
“Haven’t seen him.”

  
“His car is in your parking lot,” I pushed. “Can I show you a picture?”

  
From the kitchen, a bell dinged and he turned from me, ignoring the phone.

  
“Get lost,” he said.

  
I looked over at the man beside me, showing him the screen, but he just stared at his plate, breathing heavily.

  
“Bill Heisey. You haven’t seen this man?”

  
“Nuh,” he grunted.

  
The hairy guy returned from the kitchen, carrying a stack of milk crates. In each one was a thick plastic bag filled to bursting with cuts of raw meat. Juice was dripping from the bottom crate, but he ignored it and rested the stack on the counter.

  
The man next to me choked down the last big bite of his steak. His throat bulged as he swallowed. He picked up the crates and disappeared out the door. The hairy guy returned to the kitchen, then returned with a similar stack. He emerged from behind the counter and followed his friend.  
“Don’t be here when I get back,” he said over his shoulder.

  
I’d like to say my finely honed journalistic instincts for sniffing out a story took in the situation and started asking questions. If the diner was closed, what was it being used for? Where was all that meat going, if not to a restaurant?

  
But something else had grabbed my attention. As the kitchen door swung closed, I saw for a brief moment a familiar face.

  
Bill.

  
Dressed in an apron, soaked and grimy with blood. I jumped to my feet.

  
“Bill!”

  
There was no response from the kitchen, so I moved around the counter and pushed open the kitchen door.

  
Inside was the most gruesome sight I’ve ever seen. Hunks of meat draped everywhere, cow skulls piled in the corner. I gagged as I spotted a trashcan overflowing with intestines and other viscera.

  
And there, in the centre of it, was Bill, carving hunks of meat from a huge slab of beef. He was ankle-deep in chunks of fat and offal, his sneakers soaked through with thick, coagulated gore.

  
“Bill!” I said again. He looked up and blinked. His eyes were scarlet and bloodshot, like he’d been crying for hours.

  
“What do you want?” he said.

  
I stared at him for a moment, my mouth open.

  
“What do I--?! Where have you been?” I nearly shouted.

  
He continued to stare at me, like he’d never seen me before.

  
“We’ve been looking for you for days,” I said. “Everyone thought you were dead, or kidnapped, or...”

  
He shook his head. “I’m fine.”

  
I looked around at the makeshift slaughterhouse we were both standing in, at a loss for words. “You’re obviously not fine. I came to take you home.”

  
I jumped as the hairy guy grabbed my shoulder from behind.

  
As he shoved me out of the kitchen, I had an idea. I turned back to Bill. “What should I tell Katie?”  
“Tell her I’m not coming back.”

  
My heart raced as he failed the test. His wife’s name is Maria. Something was definitely going on here. Was he on drugs? Or maybe this was his way of giving me a message? Was he trying to tell me he was being held against his will?

  
As the kitchen door swung closed, I heard Bill call after, in a small, halting voice.

  
“The restroom... It’s just outside.”

  
He WAS trying to tell me something! I struggled against the hairy guy, who dragged me out from behind the counter. As we passed by the register, I quietly grabbed the restroom key. It was chained to a soup ladle, caked with something sticky and slick. I held it between two fingers behind my back as the hairy guy shoved me outside and slammed the diner door.

  
Out front of the diner, one of the trucks pulled away, its bed completely filled with the crates of the stinking meat. I considered just getting the hell out of there. But you don’t get to be editor-in-chief by dropping a story when it heats up.

  
I unlocked the restroom door, bracing myself for something somehow worse than the kitchen, but it was a pretty regular bathroom. A simple sink, urinal, and walled-in bathroom stall. Even the cracked tile of the floor looked clean.

  
Opening the stall door, I saw that the toilet was missing, just a hole that went deep into the ground, surrounded by jagged tile. And of course, that stench, worse than ever. I checked the stall walls for a message from Bill, but just found regular graffiti.

  
It wasn’t until I exited the stall and turned to leave that I saw it. The inside of the restroom door, unseen until now, was covered with writing. Big, block letters, etched by a black sharpie. The letters looked written in a hurry, running together, but legible. Near the top of the door:

  
MY NAME IS BILL HEISEY

  
Then below:  
LOCKED IN

  
DARK FOR HOURS

  
SOMETHING IN HERE

  
FRACKING OPENED SOMETHING

  
DOWN THERE

  
HOLES ALL OVER FOX CREEK

  
NOT PEOPLE NOW

  
SOMETHING

  
ELSE

  
My heart raced as I took a photo with my phone and continued reading:

  
CAN HEAR IT

  
FROM THE STALL

  
DOWN THERE

  
SO TIRED

  
CAN’T SLEEP

  
CRAWL INSIDE

  
BEHIND MY EYES

  
KILLED ONE

  
BUT MORE

  
I looked at the floor near the hinges of the door and saw the squashed remains of something in the corner, maroon and oily, almost a puddle. I could see what looked like a broken, spindly leg sticking out.

  
Near the floor, almost illegible:

  
SO TIRED

  
CONTACT MARIA HEISEY OR TYLER GRAHAM

  
DESTROY TOWN

  
BEFORE SPREAD

  
I HEAR IT

  
I stopped reading, startled by the sound of the restroom door latch slamming shut outside. I grabbed the handle and shoved, but it wouldn’t budge.

  
Then the lights went out.

  
Been sitting here for hours in the dark, my back to the door, just like Bill. The thing that wore him wasn’t trying to give me a clue. It trapped me in here.

  
Used to the smell now. Listening for sounds. Writing this. No reception, but need to get this down. Tell the story.

  
Listening and shining the flashlight on my phone, keeping it on the stall door as I type. Something is in there.

  
Flashlight is dead now, phone screen not far behind.

  
The smell.

  
I hear it now.

  
In the dark.

  
We have to tell someone.

  
Something is not right in Fox Cr-
