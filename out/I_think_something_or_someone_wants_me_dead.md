TW: Gore, animal mutilation, death, car accident, supernatural phenomenon

Hi there, I’ve never done this before but decided I needed guidance, not some shitty google search. Advice from REAL people, something isn’t right and I feel as if my days are limited, I feel as though I received only a warning. A gentle warning if anything.

So for starters regarding the story for some background info I have a five year old dog named Luna, she's the sweetest girl. Honestly she only really hates men and children(trauma). She's all black apart from her belly/chest area which involves a blond sort of color and the smallest patch of white on her chest as well and the blond sort of color is also on her paws. Another thing regarding the story includes my brother who we’ll call Edward for privacy reasons who in October of this year passed away in a car accident, and very often since the accident I dream with him. Another thing of info is actually about me personally, now I have dreams where it feels absolutely real, meaning I experience pain, have all five human senses and can talk about everything as though it were a memory, these dreams feel so real that most of the time during reality I talk about my dreams as if it were a memory not knowing it was a dream. I don’t dream of flying cars and shit or like talking animals. No. I dream about a regular day at school, and like a trip to the grocery store. Anyway it's pretty trippy and I think it's called “Lucid dreaming’ but I'm not sure. The bottom line is that they feel so real and I have moments of confusion during the day trying to recall if it was a dream or reality before I start speaking nonsense. But another thing about my dreams also they tend to be graphic which i've grown used to but another thing they have never bothered me so much so to the point I’m genuinely scared in real life. Now let me explain the dumb dream already.

While sleeping last night I had a dream. A dream that even now I am left disturbed and paranoid. I feel like something is incredibly wrong, the world seems sideways and I keep hearing whispering and high pitch screeching.

Anyway back to what I was talking about, as I explained I was in bed asleep and I had a dream, I dreamt that I was asleep and I was woken up at 4 in the morning to Luna barking her head off, barking in a manner that I had never her do before apart from when I man got incredibly close to me and was being creepy a few years back. I recognized the bark, a warning, viscous and angry. Luna is a sweet girl, she only goes crazy like that when it's something bad, something very bad.

As she kept getting crazier and crazier I got concerned and decided to go outside to go see what on Earth she was barking about and quiet her down. Just as I took the covers off of myself I heard a man's voice booming in my head, in my skull, I knew only I could hear him, and he said to me:

“Don’t open that door to go outside, or you will die.”

I couldn’t tell if it was Edward or God, but whoever it was definitely wasn’t fucking around, so I kept my ass put and stayed in bed, my spine tingled, whatever it was outside driving Luna nuts was bad, I felt it, it was sinister, and I knew what it wanted, it wanted me. But I knew that it was only taunting Luna to draw me out, it wouldn’t hurt her. She continued to growl and bark like crazy.

Then next thing you know I woke up, not sure if it was reality or a dream, and I looked at my mother and had an instinct to tell her immediately. Normally I would never even THINK about telling her shit, but I told her about the dream, she only gasped and asked about Edward. Me and mother are not close at all so that's what left me in awe but like reality she discouraged everything I said and only questioned me about my deceased older brother. Then I fell back asleep.

I woke up again to sunlight shining through the small window in my room, and as I stood up onto the cold floor I had a gut feeling to look up, so I did. What I saw was anything but normal or even natural, the ceiling was rotting, like something from outside was trying to come in.

I said fuck it and headed for the door to head outside, I felt every instinct to not open the door but I just HAD to check on Luna. And there she was, swaying gently in the wind, she was hung up by her cord that she has on when she's outside, it wrapped around her neck, it had ripped into her neck revealing the meat underneath her soft bloody fur, her bottom jaw along with her tongue was ripped off leaving blood still trickling down her chest, covering the little piece of white fur on her chest turning it red, a deep disgusting red. And I can’t forget her eyes, her poor eyes, her little paws were just relaxed, blood dripping onto the concrete floor below her. After seeing her all I did was put my hand over my mouth and did my best not to scream while my eyes filled with tears. What the fuck, what the actual fuck happened to Luna.

I turned right back around because I knew that was just a slight warning, as much as I wanted to get her down and bury her, I knew it was a trap, for me to take time to stay outside and whoever or actually whatever the hell the thing was that was trying to get me was watching and waiting.

I laid back in my bed and fell asleep once again, and I woke up to Luna barking like crazy, I didn’t get up or move, but this time I absolutely knew it was reality, when I woke up it was dark out, it's still almost completely dark and im scared to go outside because Luna stopped barking completely and suddenly not to long ago.

When I finally got out of bed I ran to check on Luna I had a gut feeling to not to open the door but did, and there she was wagging her tail as she came to greet me, I held her and cried, cause dude who the fuck wouldn’t its scary as shit. Once I got my ass to school even when I got out of bed I kept hearing screeching and whispering, I feel like I'm being watched an feel as though im going crazy, I also feel as though as my days are numbered I feel as if I'm gonna die any day, I'm scared, Im posting this to seek advice, I don’t know what to do.
