I’m a good dad.

My son’s a good boy.

So when [I found myself at the bottom of a shallow grave, looking at the quickly rotting corpse of a child, reflecting on the facts that I’d helped bury it, that my son had ostensibly murdered him, and that I had been tricked into going along with the whole thing by believing in zombies](https://redd.it/15p1cme), I couldn’t help but wonder:

Had I made some poor parenting choices?

Given the circumstances, it was an open question. 

Then my son pulled a pistol from his waistband. I have no idea where he got the thing. “It will be easier if you go along with this, Daddy,” he explained in a soft voice. 

A trail of fear prickled along my back and toward my neck as all the moisture from my palate transferred to the crotch of my underpants. “No,” I whispered. I suddenly felt more grounded than I ever had in my life: the blue sky looked down from above as I felt the soil beneath my feet, and for a moment, that was the only important thing in the world. “We may have made our mistakes, son, but I have faith. I’m not afraid of you.” I extended my hand. “No matter what choices you regret, I’ll stand by you. That’s what it means to be a father: nothing can ever reduce how much I love you, and I trust the man you’ll become on the educated side of your bad decisions. I know, in my heart of hearts, that we won’t hurt each other.”

Then he shot me.

Movies sometimes show people taking a bullet without realizing it before cartwheeling back in a graceful death arc. Movies are full of shit. That hurt like a thousand bees trying to escape my rectum with nothing but stingers and Tabasco Sauce as digging tools. I looked down and vomited.

“YOU SHOT THE KNEECAP OFF MY LEG!” I screamed. “IT BELONGS ON THE LEG, NOT OFF OF IT!”

He sighed. “It’s not like you’ll need it to walk away from here, Dad.”

I slammed tremoring hands onto the wound, trying unsuccessfully to stop the spurting blood. “FUCK!”

My son cocked his head. “Will you take me seriously now?”

I looked up at his exasperated face, and my world ended. He was serious. My son was planning to kill me. 

I stared back and forth between dead Reverse Pizza Kid and my boy. “H-h-how could you do this?” I stuttered.

He rolled his eyes. “You didn’t even believe it was a dead body at first. Then, when you found out the truth, you *immediately* believed it was a zombie attack.” My son folded his arms and glared at me in disappointment. “Honestly, you were so gullible that it wasn’t even fun. Your Reddit followers are just as bad. They accepted the zombie explanation with *zero* convincing.”

My mind spun. “So – so there were no zombies?”

He wasn’t angry or vindictive. No, when my eleven-year-old son stared down at me, only disappointment was etched in his face. “Zombies aren’t real, Dad.”

I sat back down in the hole, getting the willies as my skin brushed up against the room temperature body of the child I’d been duped into burying. I gasped like a fish, reaching for a breath that ran far beyond my reach. “You’ll grow up without a father, spending the rest of your life lacking the guidance, financial support, income security, and love of a parent.” I shook my head. “*Why?*”

He looked up at the sky as though expecting to see an answer written in the trees. Then he shrugged. “I thought it could be cool.”

And that’s the reason all of my hopes and dreams ended. My son is a homicidal psychopath, and I was too dumb to see the evidence even when it was violently shoved in my face. 

Then he tossed a phone to me. “You should leave one final message to your 1,913 idiot followers on Reddit. I’ll read it and post after you’re dead. I think that’s the most important thing right now.”

“Well, at least we agree on one thing,” I answered before typing this up. 

And so my life’s journey ends. I really wanted to see the Pyramids, to hold my baby grandchild, to laugh on a front porch at ninety years old while telling stories from an unexpected life. Instead, I’ll die in a hole before middle age and no one will ever find my body as it slowly rots. 

He’s eying his gun, but seems *very* interested in the shovel. I don’t know if it will be worse to die of a bullet to the bladder or a dozen shovel blows to the skull from a child far too weak to finish the job in one go. 

Either way, I wish I’d never been born.

I’ll update on the extremely unlikely chance that I live until tomorrow.

Please look for my body at (ha, you really think I’d let my dad post that part?)
