I always read the reviews before going anywhere. The Gladry Hotel had high ratings, and it was in walking distance to the studio I’d contracted to work for. It seemed like an easy choice, so I ignored the most recent one-star rating.

“Clean rooms. Friendly staff. Always a smiling face…”

The review itself seemed positive, so I assumed the rating was just a user error. I booked my room and started packing.

\*\*\*

I arrived for check-in just before 3 p.m. The Gladry was gorgeous on the outside, an Art Deco masterpiece rising eight stories over a bustling downtown. I made a note to step out that evening to take a few photos of the exterior all lit up at night.

A doorman greeted me with a warm smile and loaded my bags onto a cart. The front desk staff was just as polite. Cheery faces all around. They explained all the fine amenities, the hotel restaurant, and the local treasures I shouldn’t miss. Then they handed me the key to my room.

I’d be staying on the top floor. Before I hopped on the elevator, the concierge stopped me.

“Remember, the pool and fitness center close at 8 p.m.,” she said. “Room service ends at 11:30 p.m.”

“No problem,” I said. “I might have some long days ahead of me. Are there any late-night restaurants open around here?”

She hesitated to answer, but never lost her chipper tone.

“Yes, uh, there are a few,” she said. “We only ask that you remember our quiet hours at night. This is an old building, and sound carries. It would be best if you could be in your room by midnight.”

“I’ll keep that in mind,” I smiled, then she rang the elevator for me and returned to the lobby.

A bellhop accompanied me to my room. He appeared to be much older than the rest of the staff, and his deep-lined face didn’t wear the same pleasant expression I’d seen all around the lobby. I figured he must’ve been working this same job for a very long time. He didn’t speak as the brass-lined elevator slowly climbed to the top.

I thought I understood. Customer service jobs are uniquely exhausting. It takes a lot of endurance and self-denial to crank up that smile for every stranger that comes your way. I didn’t blame him for letting the mask slip a bit during the ride up.

The brass doors parted with a charming little ding, then we padded down the plush carpeted hall to my door. The bellhop followed me in with the cart and helped me unload my luggage.

I hung my jacket up in the closet, then turned to the door and froze.

The bellhop stood in the doorway, staring at me with a wide, straining grin.

It wasn’t an unnatural smile, but it was entirely uncanny. He hadn’t shown a shade of emotion since I met him downstairs—not a hint of the professional pleasantry that you’d expect in the hospitality industry—and now he was grinning with an intensity that didn’t suit the job at all.

A petrifying chill came over me. I nearly shouted in surprise, and even as I tried to regain my composure, my heart pounded so frantically, I wondered if he could hear it. For the life of me, I couldn’t understand what brought on this mad glare.

I racked my brain for anything I could have said to offend him. Then I carefully reached a hand into my back pocket.

“Sorry,” I said. “I almost forgot your tip.”

I plucked a few bills from my wallet and handed them over with a nervous smile.

The splitting grin fell from his face like someone had cut the strings holding it up. He glanced down at the cash and stashed it away.

“Oh, thanks,” he said. Then he wheeled the luggage cart out into the hall, once again wearing a near-sullen expression. “Just ring if you need anything.”

I closed the door behind him and made sure it was locked.

The flight in was exhausting, and I desperately wanted to clear my head. I tried to take a nap, but I couldn’t fall asleep.

\*\*\*

Once the sun had set, I grabbed my camera and went back down to shoot the hotel exterior. Arrivals had slowed down for the night, and the lobby was nearly empty. Outside, the doorman that greeted me had already clocked out.

I crossed the driveway to get the whole building in frame. It looked great with the façade lighting. Tall pillars of warm light shone from the ground up. Giant fixtures and architectural flourishes cast dramatic shadows like someone shining a flashlight under their face to tell scary stories.

I zoomed in to capture the detail on a statue at the top of the tower. It was stunning, a golden Hestia holding a flowering branch. I adjusted for a wider shot of her and felt a creeping dread crawl up my spine when the shutter snapped.

It wasn’t the statue. Her gleaming face was completely without expression. There was nothing menacing about it, but a hard-wired alarm was sounding in my mind. Something was watching me.

I checked the photo.

Just below the statue in a top-floor window was a face peeking from the curtains. She wore a big, rictus grin. I looked back up to the window, but the face was gone. I put the lens cap back on and started across the driveway back to the hotel. I must have looked like a fool trying to hurry on trembling legs.

I sat in the lobby to calm down. I didn’t head for the elevators just yet. The face was in the window of my room.

\*\*\*

I had no appetite, but I decided to pass some time at the hotel restaurant. I had read some enthusiastic reviews about the place, so I checked my phone to see if there were any good menu recommendations. The hotel had a fresh review from the previous night.

“This place gives me the creeps. Where is everybody?”

I looked around the packed restaurant. Maybe they reviewed the wrong place.

My server was polite, and I’m sure she would’ve been more attentive if she weren’t so busy. She had a problem guest not far from me­—a four-top table with one very loud, very impatient man giving her a hard time.

*The wine was too warm*. *The steak was too small*. Whatever. His companions looked to be workmates, all turning shades of red as other guests looked their way. Nobody shut him up, though, so he must have been the boss.

When she finally made it back to me with my check, I tried to show some solidarity.

“Sorry you’ve got that guy in your section,” I said. “I get picky clients, too.”

“It’s fine,” she said with a shrug. “Guys like that come through sometimes.”

“I hope he’s not staying long,” I said.

“We probably won’t see him again,” she said. “Only the nice ones come back.”

I made sure to tip well, then went up to my room.

I switched all the lights on before I closed the door. It didn’t look like anyone had been in there today. I supposed that the face in the window must have been housekeeping, but I didn’t want to check my camera to see that photo again.

I’d be on my feet for hours at the studio the next day, so I tried to sleep. I kept dreaming about the man in the doorway.

\*\*\*

I stayed in my room all morning, and didn’t head down until it was time for my afternoon session at the studio. As I crossed the lobby, I noticed the three embarrassed coworkers from the restaurant. They were speaking with the receptionist.

“Don’t you have cameras?” one of them asked. “Surely you have surveillance footage of the parking lot.”

“We’ll certainly check, sir,” the receptionist answered. “When was the last time you saw him?”

“He stepped outside to smoke after dinner,” the man said. “He hasn’t answered his phone since. He wasn’t in his room this morning.”

I hate to admit it, but I didn’t really worry that much about the missing man. I was sure he’d show up eventually, and his buddies should enjoy the peace and quiet until then.  

There was enough on my plate, anyway. My client had a bad habit of changing his mind mid-shoot, and I had to break down and rearrange the set, lighting, and camera setup over and over while he reviewed footage for the slightest nit to pick.

\*\*\*

The shoot went late, and I hung around downtown with a few crewmembers to blow off some steam.

We did more drinking than eating, and my appetite finally kicked in on the walk back. I checked my watch just to see that I would miss room-service hours. I’d have to raid the minibar.

I made it back to the hotel with a gnawing in my stomach. The doors closed behind me and the noise of the nightlife was hushed by the absolute stillness of the lobby. The doormen and front-desk team were nowhere to be seen, while I’m sure all the other guests were safe and snug in their rooms. It was quiet hours, after all.

I had the place to myself, so I took the opportunity to take some quick photos of the lobby in this deserted state. The empty chairs, the dusty piano, the glossy marble cocktail bar, all suspended in time. Maybe it was my buzz catching up to me, but I started to get the creeps. With each snap of the camera, I recalled the face in the window of my room. The fun was over.

I put my camera away and headed toward the elevators. I thought about that last review I saw at the restaurant last night.

“This place gives me the creeps. Where is everybody?”

*You said it*. I should have saved some money and booked a different hotel.

I checked my phone to see if anyone else had spoken up since then. There was a new review posted while I was out.   

“Smile back and you’ll be ok!”

Thankfully, there were no smiling faces around me, and I wasn’t really in a smiling mood. My stomach was starting to growl, so I called down an elevator.

The doors opened and a server from the restaurant was leaning absently on an empty room-service cart. We made eye contact and he flashed an obligatory smile. I didn’t return it. I just stepped aside to let him off, but he stayed on the elevator.

Fine. I stepped aboard and we started climbing to floor eight. The elevator couldn’t move fast enough. My stomach was in knots and I just wanted to dig into to those pricey little snacks in my room, not caring what my bill would be at check-out.

“No more room service tonight?” I asked the server without looking at him.

“No more,” he answered. His voice had an off-putting lilt to it.

I didn’t want to turn my head, but I could tell from the reflection in the brass doors that he was still smiling at me. The floors ticked up slowly, two, three, four… taking longer and longer before each number.

I thought it was strange, so I turned to him for his reaction. I shouldn’t have looked.

He was staring straight at me with wide and bloodshot eyes, and the corners of his lips continued to rise. They were soon past anything that resembled a friendly smile. There was an unsettling urgency to it, closer to a cry for help. Or a warning.

I wanted off this ride, so I pressed the Open button. It did nothing. Then I realized we were no longer traveling up. The numbers were bouncing all over the place. Six, four, seven, two, nine... Nine? Twelve, ten, thirteen...

I looked back to the server to see tears stream from his unblinking eyes. The grin was as wide as it could be at this point. He leaned uncomfortably close, drooling, teeth chattering like he was eager to bite.

With my back to the door, my mind raced. I needed a way out, a way to calm him down. I thought of the bellhop, so I reached for my wallet. Empty. I had spent all my cash at the bar.

“I don’t have any cash for a tip,” I said. Then I tried to crack an apologetic smile.

He blinked. The chattering subsided, the lips slowly fell from their wide grin, and the server eased away from my face.

With a chipper ding, the doors opened behind me. We had reached the eighth floor. I left the elevator without looking back.

“Have a good night,” the server said. Then the doors closed and I was alone in the hall.

I was almost to my door when the lights went out.

Even though I’d just seen the hall empty, I had this awful feeling like there was someone else with me in the dark. As I fumbled for my key, I realized that I was being watched. I looked over my shoulder.

Down the hall, the darkness smiled. I couldn’t see anything but a glinting pair of eyes and a wide, toothy grin. It was moving closer. I dropped my key and pawed for it in the dark. I couldn’t take my eyes off the disembodied smile.

I couldn’t find the key, so I stood on trembling legs. If I tried to run, I wouldn’t make it to the elevator. It was nearly over me, and I could see every detail of its long, sharp teeth. It was the same manic expression that came over the bellhop, the woman in the window, the server. I knew what it wanted.

I looked it in the eye and smiled. The face stopped. Its grin shrank from an aggressive extreme to a softer countenance, as if it were pleased. The lights flickered back to life, and I was alone in the hall again. I found the key at my feet and stumbled into my room.

I had lost my appetite for the minibar.  

\*\*\*

I left The Gladry early this morning and checked into a motel. The reviews here are mixed, and the staff is far from cheerful. That’s fine.

I’m so tired, nothing will stop me from sleeping through the night. First, though, I want to offer some advice.  

If you’re planning to travel, don’t book a room at The Gladry Hotel. No matter where you go, just be nice to the staff. There’s no telling what they’re dealing with behind the scenes.

And if someone smiles at you, play it safe. Be polite and smile back.
