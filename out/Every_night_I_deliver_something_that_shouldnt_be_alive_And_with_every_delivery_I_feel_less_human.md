Nocturnal. Those that are primarily active in the night, and sleep during the day. A lifestyle shaped by the road after dark.

My orders were always the same. Clear. They would sometimes come in a fancy envelope, sometimes in a crumpled parking ticket. I would read them the first few gigs—they had a way of chilling me to my core—but now I just simply toss them out.

I was a creature of the night. Nocturnal. Modern times had their own myths and legends too, it’s just that the magic was removed from them. Science is the act of making the extraordinary ordinary and I could feel myself being one of them. Humans used to be magic too. Those who never tired. Top of the food chain. Now corporate slaves.

It was cruel to remember that we once used to be hunters.

1. You start when others shut down. My night shift begins at exactly 9pm, when I can no longer stave off the excitement with mundane tasks like sleeping, or forcing the washing machine to eat scraps. I’ve done this before, I don’t need laundry for another week. But I can’t stop this restlessness inside of me—this need for the calm of the cool night.

It goes without saying I would never leave my cramped, one-room apartment—my apartment was less of a home than my truck was. The sun didn’t burn my eyes really, but it would burn my cargo, so I still had to be careful.

2. Sunlight is your “Do Not Disturb” sign. My cargo was always a bit sketchy, my job wouldn’t pay the amounts it did otherwise. It always had to be kept in cool, clean conditions, it was never to be exposed during the light, and I would never need to collect it—it would just appear under the tarp of my load. 

3. You are to NEVER open the cargo. One time I flashed my light on it, and it showed the lines and crosses of what looked like a cage. I could sense breathing—of something—but it didn’t feel like life. It wasn’t dead either. After taking my Benadryl, I usually feel calm enough to tell myself that it’s some kind of exotic animal.

I believe myself.

4. You never ask for directions. The routes are the only thing from the orders that change. They’re not obvious what they are, just a printout of a few lines and turns. Only another driver could perceive them and understand them to be what they really are—an overlay of our city’s road system.

But asking for directions is pretty tempting. After a few hours of driving, an intense wave of tiredness rushes over me. I’ve learned that it does not matter how much sleep I’ve had to take over the day, because at night it will always feel the same. It was my frail human body telling me I’m messing with forces beyond my control. The universe needs to set right these things, and I never belonged to this world. I was never born nocturnal.

The people on the road seemed to know this. They’d offer for directions to a place they had no idea about. They’d beg me to come rest at their hotel. Then they’d smile ever so widely when I refuse. 

Their teeth are too white.

Now I’m used to it, I just prick myself on the small crack of my wheel. I should repair it, but the sight of the blood stimulates me. I’d feel brighter. Stronger. I had more power.

5. You only stop when the road tells you to. I remembered why I chose this job. People would look at me and guess I’m a waitress in a hotel of some kind—the wrong ones. My sister complained that I was getting paler and paler every time she saw me. My parents were horrified to learn I was working the night shift—“the horrors you’re putting yourself through, no woman should!”—and I’d just emptily smile.

They didn’t understand what the night gave me. Peace from the world’s noise. Where everyone slept, no one could be an annoyance. The last 12 hours of my day were my favorite. I wasn’t just a cog in the machine, a girl with a nice smile.

My truck knew me, understood me. Protected me, responded to my every touch. Wherever I’d go, I knew I’d always be safe with it. It made me bigger. Rarely I’d see a small Corolla driving through—a cheater returning home to his wife with his dirty hands. Or maybe a pregnant couple rushing to the ER. It could be anyone in there.
But all I could think about was driving. Driving, faster and faster till the Corolla driver would look around—half-expectant that I’d stop, half-scared for his life—and I’d just crush it. Listen to the metal crunching and meat and bones being pulverized. The pungent rusty flavor of blood staining the air.

This bloodlust was so foreign to me, but it grew stronger and stronger the more gigs I went. It stopped being cars, and it became the pedestrians who had once offered directions. I see them everyday now, and on first-name basis with some of them. 

I could almost feel my hand reach out as it latches onto the neck, and with the scary efficiency of my truck, it would crush and twist all meat and bone in there. I could feel the blood on my hands, seeping slowly to my forearms. The mark of power. Of control. Of holding human life.

6. You’re not supposed to feel anything for the cargo. One time, it laughed. It was a harrowing sound that reverberated through the air of the night. I reminded myself it was alive—just not the way I am. I couldn’t stop myself from laughing back; perhaps it was the absurdity of the situation finally weighing on me, or an ancient desire of kinship with someone. The nights were indeed getting lonely. 

I thought I was used to being alone, I never had much friends and family.  But recently the loneliness was starting to make its head visible. I had a small suspicion that it wasn’t about my lack of company, but rather a deep need to talk to my cargo. Maybe even make friends. 

The dreams are getting worse now. Sometimes I would see my cargo being burned down. I would feel a chasmic wave of grief, like my own blood was being wrenched out of me. This scared me. I think the grief wasn’t meant for my truck, but rather the cargo it carries.

7. You can only stay parked for 23 minutes. Don’t hit 24. Never hit 24. Even if you’re sleeping. Especially if you’re sleeping. 

Yesterday I woke up to a tap on the window—and nothing was there. Just the exact temperature of my breath on the glass. Panicked, I quickly checked my phone and it had been 37 minutes. There were no cars on the road, no beeps to warn me that I had dangerously stopped driving in the middle of the road. 

I quickly looked back to check my cargo—it now had life rights more important than my own—and the tarp had been pulled open. Shaking, I got off my truck and headed to the back to see what had happened.

The cage had been grotesquely pried off. The steel lines bent at such odd and horrible angles—and I couldn’t help but imagine my own bones twisted in this manner. For the first time since my gigs, I felt unsafe. Out of control. The controlled haze of the drugs has worn off. Paranoia was creeping in to take its place.

There was a kind of horror in hearing something move before you see it. I slowly turned around in the direction of the footsteps and saw them. Creatures of the night. My feet fought every ounce of self-preservation and instead started compelling me towards them. I wanted this, I realized. 

My soul had wanted to understand them for so long. And I’m ashamed to say this, but I felt understood. Back. 
One of them approached to greet me. It smiled widely—too widely with too perfect teeth. I anxiously smiled back as it reached out to caress my cheek. It all clicked, this primal sense of understanding. I could no longer hear my sister’s annoying voice as it complained about my night shift. How my complexion could suffer seemed so irrelevant. It all faded away into the void. 

I had felt oddly fulfilled when it all cut to black.

8. You don’t keep souvenirs. Now it was 5am in the morning and the sun’s unfamiliar rays have started to creep in. I was in my truck, and my truck was at my apartment’s parking lot. How I drove myself here I had no idea. I just knew that the job promised that I’d always come home in the mornings. 

No matter what had happened to me.

I felt radiant and fresh. Cleansed. Reborn as if I had not died rotting the last night. Maybe this was the whole point, why I never got a normal job. My family was wrong, I wasn’t wasting my life.

Maybe I had to die to feel alive.

There was another note on the mirror. Today it was a sticky note, but the contents weren’t the same. I flicked it off the car mirror. Before I read it, I noticed the two evenly placed dots on my neck. Perfect for a set of sharp teeth. A souvenir of the perfect night.

Doors open both ways, it read.

They let me go because I was one of them now. Cargo delivered. Human no longer.
