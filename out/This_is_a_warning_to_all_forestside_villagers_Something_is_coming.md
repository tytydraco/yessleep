I've worked as fire lookout since I was in my early twenties, I always loved the woods. My father was the one who taught me everything I know, I think that's why I still find comfort in the woods, even after everything I've seen - everything that is yet to be seen, those woods are all I have left of him.

It always starts off small, you notice something just out of the corner of your eye, things seem to move on their own - it's the little things that get to you. The paranoia sets in, and before long, you're a madman. They say isolation will do that to a person, when you're all alone out in the woods like that - they say the isolation is what gets you, but I know that's not true.

When my father died, I truly had no one. My mother had left when I was a baby, and I never had any siblings - I was completely and utterly alone for the first time in my life. That's when Mr. Snowfield found me, he took me in under his wing - taught me how to be a good lookout, he even helped me get my first job. I owe that man a lot, but it's a shame I'll never get a chance to pay him back.

I think that's enough foreshadowing, wouldn't you agree? I'm sure by this point you're asking yourself one of two questions, and I hope I can answer them in due course.

Now - like I said, as fire watch guards, people rarely take you seriously. Isolation is a scary thing - it does all sorts to the human mind. I think that's what makes it all the more challenging to make this story believable. I swear to you what I'm about to tell you is the truth - but whether you believe me or not is completely out of my hands.

I remember it started with a sound - it's not like anything I've ever heard before. It's something that I couldn't describe even if I wanted to, and frankly, I think it's better off never being described. It's the kind of thing that instills a primal fear within you, it triggers a phobia in you that you didn't even know you had.

Every night when I returned to the tower, I heard it - picture the most horrific, blood-curdling and inhuman sound you can think of - it's not quite a scream, but it's leaning in the same direction. The sound was so loud that, even if it was getting closer I don't think I could've known.

Part of my job involved keeping campers and hikers safe - so when I started to see those tracks, I wasn't sure what to make of them.

The woods are no stranger to large predators - bears and wolves alike. This was different, it wasn't natural. It was too big - unnaturally big, these footprints alone where about the size of my head, and I knew that whatever animal had made them was much larger than anything else that roamed these woods.

You'd think that due to the creature's size - it would be easy to spot. You'd think I would know it was there, but until finding those footprints sunk deep into the mud - I didn't know anything even half the size of this thing called these woods home.

The prints themselves were hooved, very similiar to the prints left by a deer except - much larger than any deer prints.

On numerous occasions I tried following the tracks, but they always lead me back to where I started - it was almost like whatever had made these tracks knew I would find them, it knew I would follow them - and whatever it was it didn't want me to find it.

I don't remember exactly when it started following me - all I remember is the sheer panic of being woken up in the middle of the night to something outside trying persistently - almost successfully - to get inside.

One of those nights, I was woken up to the familiar sound of the door being thrashed mercilessly - and that night I knew the door was on the verge of giving in. Not knowing what else to do I slid under the bed, praying to whatever god may be listening that it wouldn't find me.

Almost as soon as I was under the bed, the door finally gave way. I saw hooves - but whatever beast they belonged to, it was not supposed to be here - it wasn't supposed to exist.

It stood upright on it's hind legs, moving around the tower searching for me. Clearly frustrated the creature let out a low gutteral growl - and then it let out an ear-piercing screech, remember that sound I kept hearing? Now I finally knew the source, but to my horror, another screech answered from further away in the forest.

Realising there were two of them, my heart-dropped, just... how many of these creatures are there?

Seemingly satisfied with its search of the tower, the creature left, but I remained frozen in place until the sun rose.

I immediately left the tower as soon as the sunlight was visible, I didn't know who to contact - nobody would believe me, or if they did, they'd be almost as powerless as me against whatever these things were.

I still haven't returned to the tower, I haven't even contacted my employer to let them know I quit - but I know they've got their hands full already. After all god knows how many more of those creatures are out there - those deafening screeches could've been made by hundreds, even thousands of beasts.

I've already heard reports of campers and hikers going missing in those woods, and last week the first villagers started to disappear. I don't know how long we have left before they attack bigger cities - but I know we have to prepare ourselves. Whatever these things are - they're hungry.
